  <p>This project started from the presumption that I could use the
  far-flung resource called the Internet to give students of Mark
  Twain access to the particular and often rare resources of the
  Barrett Collection of American Literature at the University of
  Virginia Library. Many of Mark Twain's works still speak directly
  to modern readers, but the larger story of his career -- as
  best-selling writer, live performer, celebrity and American icon
  -- can be more fully appreciated when those works are located in
  the context of his times. By means of the Web, for example,
  students around the world can flip through <a href=
  "../huckfinn/hucprohp.html">the sales prospectus of <i>Huck
  Finn</i></a> and see for themselves how this classic American
  novel was described and sold to its original readers in 1885 --
  and since the copy they are using is a virtual one, the real
  prospectus isn't being worn out.</p>

  <p>I began naively, thinking only about my own expectations. My
  original ambition was to digitize and organize as much primary
  material as possible. As I have built the site, however, I have
  learned from the reactions of my own students about the
  expectations people bring with them to the Internet. It quickly
  became obvious that when my students sat in front of a computer,
  they were looking for pictures, not words, and for a more
  interactive experience than just reading a text. The desire to
  take real advantage of the Internet and the computer as resources
  has led me to look for ways to <i>re</i>-present the story of
  Mark Twain in his times.</p>

  <p>At present, then, this site aspires to be both a permanent
  electronic archive and an evolving virtual exhibition. As an
  archive, it contains a growing number of searchable primary
  texts: of Mark Twain's works, of contemporary reviews, of
  advertisements, and so on. As an ongoing experiment in ways of
  using the capabilities of computers to help people explore the
  meaning of a writer's achievement, it contains several different
  kinds of interactive displays:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Since Net users are looking for graphic images, what parts of
    the story can pictures tell? Can the issue of <i>Huck Finn</i>
    and racism be articulated by <a href=
    "../huckfinn/jiminpix.html">the various American illustrations
    of Jim</a>?
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    The display of <a href="../sc_as_mt/yrstruly.html">Mark Twain's
    various signatures</a> also attempts visually to articulate a
    specific interpretive issue -- Clemens, Twain and identity --
    but in addition tries to give users more interactive control.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    Translating <i>Innocents Abroad</i> into <a href=
    "../innocent/iamaphp.html">a hypertext map</a> explores what is
    gained and lost when a narrative text is reconceptualized in
    graphic (and geographic) terms that allow readers to move into
    and out of it in non-linear ways.
  </blockquote>

  <p>As both archive and experiment the site remains very much in
  progress. I've already had the benefit of a lot of help (see
  Acknowledgements), but I will be grateful for all the additional
  help I can get. If you have either a contemporary newspaper
  review or an idea about a new way to display as aspect of Mark
  Twain's career in this electronic medium, I hope you'll send it
  along. I'm also interested in your reactions to what is already
  here. The great and terrible thing about an electronic project is
  that it never has to be finished.</p>
