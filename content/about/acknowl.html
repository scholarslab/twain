        <p>It's easy to see the part machines play in a project
        like this one, but if "Mark Twain in His Times" works at
        all, it's because of the many people who've contributed to
        it.</p>

        <p>The staff of Special Collections at the University of
        Virginia Library have been consistently cooperative and
        helpful. I'd like especially to thank Mike Plunkett, Ned
        Berkeley, Christina Deane and George Riser. Special credit
        goes to the people who've taken the digital pictures of
        most of the materials displayed here.  The first round of images were captured by Edward Gaynor, Felicia
        Johnson, Brad Cupp and Becca Yokum.  In the Fall, 2007, many of those images were re-shot by the staff of the Library's Digitization Services.  In particular I'd like to acknowledge the work of Andrew Curley, Soo Byon, Westley Knight, Jimmy Ko, Ann Lynch and Meredith Hulley.</p>

        <p>Throughout the first decade of this project I received a steady supply of help from the staff at
        the Library's E-Text Center, besides the people listed on the
        "titlepage" of this site. I'd like especially to thank
        Stephen Ramsay and Matthew Kirschenbaum.  Since then the project has been upgraded and maintained by the Library's Scholars' Lab, under the leadership of Bethany Nowviskie.</p>

        <p>Most of the reviews included in the site and a number of
        other exhibits were collected with the unfailing help of
        the staff of Alderman Library's Interlibrary Services,
        especially Lew Purifoy. For his own website on MT's lecture tour with Cable, Scott Holmes did a great job establishing the exact dates of the performances, and finding over a dozen additional reviews -- all of which he has generously shared.  Scott Holmes Tom Cole, of Worcester,
        Massachusetts, digitized and passed along the
        <i>Gazette</i>'s review of Mark Twain's 1871 lecture
        there.</p>

        <p>For help with the digital maps in the site, I need to
        thank the staff at the Library's Geospatial &amp;
        Statistical Data Center, including Michael Furlough, Peter
        Kessler -- and especially Blair Tinker and Robert
        Griffin.</p>

        <p>The examples of Mark Twain's voice were made possible by
        the assistance of Perry Roland, in the Digital Media and
        Music Center, at U.Va's Clemons (but not Clemens)
        Library.</p>

        <p>I'm particularly grateful to John Raynor and John F.
        Kingsley, of the Library Technical Services, for installing
        the Webinator program that made my aging hope for a
        searchable site a reality.</p>

        <p>Friends and colleagues in the English Department have
        provided support, assistance, encouragement and advice. I'd
        like especially to thank Peter Baker, Alan Howard, and
        Barbara Smith. I'm also indebted to my students, especially
        the group of beta testers in ENAM 358 Spring 1996 and ENAM
        981 Fall 1996. I appreciated their openness, patience and
        interest -- and their lack of interest was valuable too.
        Special thanks to undergraduates Michael McFarland and Amy
        Tarasovic, and graduate students Angel Price, Maureen Riedy
        and Adriana Rissetto, and JoAnn Schambier and Robert Brown,
        and former student Brady Earnhart.</p>

        <p>Robert Hirst, of the Mark Twain Project at the
        University of California, has generously shared both
        material in the MT Papers and the impressive fund of
        knowledge he carries with him. I also need to acknowledge
        the encouragement and help of Barbara Schmidt, Taylor
        Roberts, Terrell Dempsey, and Dave Thomson, all of whom I
        met, virtually, through the online Mark Twain Forum, and Robert E. Stewart, 
whom Barbara sent my way. And
        thanks to Rhio H. Barnhart for sharing the images of his
        copy of <i>The Boy's King Arthur</i>.</p>

        <p>I'm especially grateful to Kevin Mac Donnell, of Mac
        Donnell Rare Books, Austin, Texas, for contributing to the
        archive not only items from his wonderful MT collection,
        but also his expertise and his enthusiasm. You can see his
        contribution in the <font size="-1">SAM CLEMENS AS MARK
        TWAIN</font> section of the site.</p>

        <p>The State of Missouri Department of Natural Resources
        generously gave permission to use two examples from the
        manuscript of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>. I want particularly to
        thank John Josef Huffman, Administrator of the Mark Twain
        Birthplace State Historic Site, for providing the images.
        The Boston Public Library generously provided examples of
        Edward Abbey's Arthurian murals for the <i>Connecticut
        Yankee</i> section of this archive.</p>

        <p>I'd like to dedicate my work on the site to Ben and
        Annie. You were the ones who led me to computers, and made
        learning what they could do a labor of love.</p>
