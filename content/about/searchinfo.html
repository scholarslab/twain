        The search engine can look through dozens of texts,
        including all five full-length MT texts featured in this
        site, and report results in an incredibly short period of
        time. I've found a lot of ways to use this capability in
        teaching these texts, and students have found textual
        searches a good early step in the development of an idea
        into an essay. But when doing a search it's important to
        remember how literally a computer follows orders. If you
        ask it to look for the word "innocence" in <i>Innocents
        Abroad</i> it will report that the word appears one time
        (and take you to the line in which it appears). It won't,
        however, look for any other forms of the word, so that if
        you want to know about "innocent" and "innocents" as well,
        you should search for "innocen" -- which will capture all
        three words.

        <p>The reviews can be searched in the same fashion. It's
        revealing to compare the number of times the word "slavery"
        appears in the reviews of <i>Huck Finn</i>, for example,
        with the number of appearances made by the word "humor." In
        addition the reviews of MT's books can be organized and/or
        searched by various descriptive categories -- Favorable or
        Unfavorable, for example, or the date or place they
        appeared -- and the reviews of his live performances can be
        sorted and searched according to similar kinds of
        categories. The full range of these options can be seen
        from the "Search the Reviews" page.</p>
