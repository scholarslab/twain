especially to add that in my belief nothing will work more powerfully f for the special interests of the colored people than for such men to make themselves felt in terse, brief, pointed utterances upon current topics of general public interest,-upon interests common to all. This will be to utilize that `touch of nature' that `makes the whole world akin.'
When colored men get to writing for white men's newspapers from the standpoint of common citizenship and mutual interests, then we shall see not one or two or half a dozen white men writing in behalf of freedmen's rights, but whole communities yielding those rights.
In short, let all colored men patiently, persistently and with all possible intellectual skill ignore their African origin and do, say and seek everything purely, only and entirely as American citizens, equally interested with all other American citizens in all the rights of all. I do not, by any means, imply that they should overlook colored men's interests and rights, but that the part of wisdom is to let the greater-at least the larger -include the less. Let colored men show such sagacious, active interest in the rights and interests of all men, that all men, shall gradually be won to regard them as valuable accessions to the community, and most valuable when most free.
Pardon me if my deep interest in the advancement of colored men has led me to speak too freely, and believe me Yours truly, G. W. Cable.
