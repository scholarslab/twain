vate business, that was. It is true that by the letter of my contract I was, under no circumstances to be required to travel much or little or any part of Sunday. What I might have chosen to concede in case of emergency is also my own private affair. It is false that I ever declined to argue the moral propriety of writing novels. That I ever this last season disappointed an audience in the matter of time or attendance is false. It is true that I have been poor. It is false that I am unwilling to help others. It is even false that I "have resolved to make my future secure." How could you suppose your correspondent got that from good authority? It is true that I spend little on myself, and that I would rather not be so poor as I have been; but I give you my word for what it is worth, I would sooner starve than get my living-as your correspondent seems willing to get his-by slandering unoffending gentlemen.
I have written you thus mainly to facilitate you in exacting from him that full explanation and amends which you have so promptly promised. I shall await it with anxiety.
The motives of my public utterances have been impugned all over one half of this country; but the charges were the hot words of people who believed themselves aggrieved, and such as public men are generally subject to. They are false & injurious, yet they spring from a wounded pride in those who make them and I cannot find it in my heart to resent them or do anything but wait patiently for time to disprove them. But it has been reserved, my dear sir, for your correspondent to print in the Boston Herald the first careful slander upon my private character that I have ever known.
Be assured I shall be grateful for all the expedition you may be able to give this distressing affair, and that I hope to remain ever
Yours respectfully
G. W. Cable.
