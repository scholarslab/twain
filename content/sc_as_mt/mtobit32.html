  <p>There is an old man in Russia who is a very great man of
  letters. Last week it was a matter for discussion whether the
  greatest living writer belonged to Russia or the United States.
  This week it will be conceded that that distinction belongs to
  Russia, for M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN</font> is dead.</p>

  <p>He had the great advantage of living his life fully out. Not
  only his years, but his energies were prolonged, until we may
  feel that he pretty well worked out what was in him. There will
  be few to question that he was the greatest American writer of
  his generation. What may be discussed is whether we have ever had
  his equal. We have had no one at all like him. If we must
  compare, we consider H<font size="-1">AWTHORNE</font> and
  W<font size="-1">HITMAN</font>. There is nobody else to put in
  the scales with M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size=
  "-1">WAIN</font>.</p>

  <p>It may be a platitude to say that he was a great writer
  because he was born with the necessary gifts. No one not so born
  ever became great in letters. What is interesting is that powers
  so remarkable should have been packed into the frame of a child
  born in a obscure village in Missouri, and should have developed
  in a life entirely dissociated from what we are used to think of
  as literary influences. From the start he went to school to life;
  learned boys first, then men, and books at his convenience. When
  boys who have what are called "advantages" are studying Latin
  grammar, M<font size="-1">ARK</font> was studying Tom Sawyer,
  Huck Finn, and the Mississippi River. He learned them, and in due
  time handed them down to be the heritage of American boys, and
  indeed of all American readers. That is his great achievement,
  that he grasped a great mindful of American life, rough, joyous,
  and picturesque, and put it where it must stay, vital and
  permanent, but convenient for examination. There is no sign yet
  of a time when it will cease to be examined by crowds of
  searchers rejoicing in what they have found.</p>

  <p>He was irreverent as R<font size="-1">ABELAIS</font> was
  irreverent. He never revered shams, and since the sham and the
  true are much mixed up in this world, he scared timid folk at
  times because of his handling of the sham part of things that had
  truth in them. Respectability never got a gyve on him, and yet in
  his essence he was a man profoundly respectable. He loved truth,
  justice, and honor, his integrity was nobly justified in the
  gravest difficulties, his affections were deep and constant, his
  sympathies were ready; to the end of his days he was master of
  himself, equal to his task, faithful to his obligations, and
  honorable and helpful man.</p>
