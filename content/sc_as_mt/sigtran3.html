  <p>[London, 7 July 1873]</p>

  <p>Friend Bliss:</p>

  <p>Finally concluded not to go to Paris. So you can take the
  Herald letters &amp; put them in a pamphlet along with the
  enclosed article about the Jumping Frog in French, (which is
  entirely new) &amp; then add enough [<u>along side of paper:</u>
  I enclose prefatory remarks, "To the Reader." You can mention, if
  you choose, that the Frog article has not been printed before] of
  my old sketches to make <u>a good fat 25 cent pamphlet</u> &amp;
  let it slide -- but don't charge <u>more</u> than 25 c[ents] nor
  less. If you haven't a Routledge edition of my sketches to select
  from you will find one at my house or Warner's.</p>

  <p>I don't expect to write any more Herald letters at
  present.</p>

  <p>Yrs Truly<br />
  SL. Clemens</p>
