    <h3>Editorial Points</h3>
  </center>People who speak of Mark Twain simply as a humorist do
  not realize how much serious work he did. He had securely held
  the place of the leading American author for a long time before
  he died.

  <p>Mark Twain was a natural, not a forced nor a mere verbal,
  humorist. He was also the first great American humorist and had
  no professional predecessor among all the laugh-provokers of the
  ages. As American as Franklin or Lincoln, his worth, like theirs,
  is appreciated in every land where newspapers or books are
  read.</p>

  <p>The court jester of old had special privileges, and the
  obsequious and sycophantic paid homage to his drolleries in order
  to curry favor with the king.</p>

  <p>The jester of democracy has no license from a sovereign to
  "blow on whom he pleases," nor no patent whereby flatterers are
  led to pay homage to his mirth. The fierce light that beats upon
  a throne is moonlight unto sunlight compared with the glaring
  lime blaze in which the words of the popular humorist are
  tested.</p>

  <p>To withstand that test was a great achievement. Mark Twain did
  that, and more; for he never allowed his fun to fossilize into
  the somber platitudes with which some old men try to erase their
  reputations as laugh-makers and obtain standing in the ranks of
  the solemnly wise. He was a humorist to the last. His title was
  never disputed.</p>

  <p>Endowed with abilities which might have enabled him to win
  fame as an interpreter of life by means of serious language, he
  chose for his patroness the comic muse, and was loyal to his
  choice. Hence he was always young and his humor always new, "Age
  could not wither, nor custom stale, his infinite variety." Even
  amid sorrows that in most cases wring the heart till not even
  hope is left in it, he showered his mellow sunshine on the
  world.</p>

  <p>American in humor, he was also American in character. Beneath
  his radiant playfulness with kings and worlds and deep
  philosophies the chords of life responded to the touch of high
  ideals. His written and his spoken words were entertainers of
  peoples, presidents and princes. His unrecorded prayers were
  deeds.</p>

  <p>He had experience of life in all its salient ways yet found no
  road, however rough, that did not have a flower along its marge.
  Whether wanderer, wage earner, author, capitalist or insolvent,
  or wearing an academic crown, whether lover, husband, father,
  neighbor or friend, his private joys or griefs could not raise a
  bar between him and the millions that were gladdened by his
  smile.</p>

  <p>Nor can death come between him and the world. He will live in
  his works.</p>

  <p>Hail, then, thou weaver of lingering laughter, but not
  farewell.</p>
