    <h3>Mark Twain, World-Servant</h3>
  </center>Wherever in the civilized world men and women and little
  children love humor and cleanliness, sweetness and far-reaching
  insight into the universal human nature, there will be genuine
  mourning over the death of Samuel L. Clemens, "Mark Twain."

  <p>Rarely has a single figure in our national literature towered
  with such unique and encyclopaedic distinction.</p>

  <p>Mark Twain was a profound humorist, paradoxical as that
  statement may seem. The shallow merry-maker with his quips and
  turns and cheaper puns and mental acrobatics is common enough in
  the story of the race. His is a faculty that barely scratches the
  surface of flesh and blood, lacking the ability to penetrate to
  the quick and touch the eternal humanities, whether they reside
  in the soul of the hyper-cultured product of the twentieth
  century, or the semi-barbarian on the outposts of
  civilization.</p>

  <p>And this is what Mark Twain accomplished, not spasmodically,
  but virtually in all of his written endeavors. Always he sounded
  the human note. It is true that his brand of humor and humorous
  philosophy, sometimes deftly screening a far more serious motif,
  was reflective of American thought and genius. But in America is
  a conglomerate of the world's races, an amalgam from the melting
  pot of the best and the worst of the old world, so that what
  civilization reverenced in Twain was the glimpse he gave it of a
  blend of itself, as typified in the universal American.</p>

  <p>Little of the slap-stick of the element of boisterousness may
  be found in the work of this master craftsman. Drollery there is
  in abundance, quaintness and charm of style abides alway,
  sustained and intuitive humor is never far absent from his elbow.
  But the cruder and more vulgar effects he avoided instinctively,
  bringing to bear a delicacy tempered with breadth.</p>

  <p>Men loved him not only for the fact that he gave them cheer,
  but that his quiet and unfailing courage gave them inspiration.
  He mocked at adversity. He combatted desolation with a smile and
  a sweet stubbornness that never acknowledged itself beaten.</p>

  <p>He was truly a world-servant. And world-wide is the wish that
  his sleep may be sound, broken only by those pleasant dreams that
  lighten the face of slumbering innocence with chastened
  smiles.</p>
