    <font size="+1">MARK TWAIN.</font>
  </center>

  <p>Mark Twain did not come to Hartford to live until he was
  nearly forty years old and he lived here only about twenty years,
  spending a good deal of those years abroad; and yet we of
  Hartford think of him always as a Hartford man, though in fact he
  was a man of all the world. No other citizen of the United
  States, not General Grant nor Theodore Roosevelt, was more
  universally known and no other American author was ever so
  generally read. We of Hartford base our claim to him on the fact
  that he identified himself with this community as he did with no
  other, and on the other and still more welcome fact that here he
  spent the happiest and the most useful of his nearly four score
  years. Although he made his home for some time in New York and
  later settled down in Redding, the feeling has never died out
  here that he belonged to Hartford, and this has been intensified
  by the fact that wherever any Hartford traveler went the first
  question asked of him was whether he knew Mark Twain.</p>

  <p>The man was original in everything, not least in insisting on
  being referred to as Mark Twain and not as Mr. Clemens. The
  essence of wit is said by those who undertake to analyze it to be
  the unexpected, and it was the unexpected that Mark Twain was
  always doing, even to building a house with its kitchen to the
  street and the bricks laid at angles, and his humor was inborn
  and inevitable; it was of the man himself. Like others of
  literary fame, he was slow in being discovered, but, once found
  out, he among all our distinctive humorists lasted through. His
  vein was never worked out. From the publication of the "Jumping
  Frog" he was a man of note, and as we have said already, for many
  years he was the most universally read of the authors of his day
  or any other day.</p>

  <p>He enjoyed this as any author would, and he enjoyed it so much
  that it stood in the way very probably of better work from his
  wonderful brain and heart. If we are not mistaken, the readers of
  this paragraph will generally agree that his finest book was the
  "Prince and Pauper," but it sold the least, and he has been
  quoted as giving that fact as his reason for not following that
  line any further. If it sold the least, it was presumably desired
  by the fewest number of people. It would be difficult to
  determine his most popular work, but a first guess would name the
  "Innocents Abroad," though you can go on from this to a dozen
  others and smile as each title comes to mind. How entertaining
  they were, and how keen he was in his knowledge of human
  nature!</p>

  <p>But with all that he wrote it was true of him, as it was of
  his old-time associate here, Mr. Warner, that in private
  conversation at the dinner table, about the billiard table, at
  club meetings and every-day accidental meetings, his delightful,
  spontaneous outpourings were more delicious than anything he
  wrote; they were said and forgotten for lack of a Boswell. Mark
  Twain enjoyed his success from all points of view. The money that
  he made was mighty welcome to a man who had known poverty down to
  the hunger line, but much of the pleasure of his wealth was in
  the opportunity it gave him for helping others; his charity was
  broad and abundant. He was singularly companionable and his
  friends were among those whose friendship was a treasure. In his
  hospitable home he entertained for years almost everybody of
  literary prominence in the country, native or passing traveler.
  But, with all his fame, he was democratic through and through. He
  would receive a friend's call in the morning as he lay in bed
  smoking, for he usually smoked several cigars before getting up,
  and he would go down town without a hat and in his slippers and
  dressing gown. He was a world celebrity and yet as approachable
  and easy as the least known among those he passed on the
  street.</p>

  <p>Here he came and went day by day, and we all felt that he
  belonged to us; here his family grew up, here his best work was
  done, here many of his choicest friendships were formed, and
  after he left here his troubles began. The first thought in
  writing of Mark Twain is to quote one after another of his
  whimsical and philosophical sayings and anecdotes. But there is
  something about his last days that forbids all that. The lights
  went out for him before life did. His wife died abroad; two of
  his daughters died tragic deaths. He himself fell sick in far
  Bermuda, and came back to an empty home to die. It is all so far
  from the spirit of his earlier years -- from the time of his
  twinkling eye and contagious smile and hearty laugh -- that one
  can only say "The pity of it, the pity of it!" He is gone now. He
  brightened life in that earlier, happier time, for a lot of us;
  he will continue to brighten life as long as people know how to
  read.</p>
