  <p>Dear Folks--</p>

  <p>I need not have hurried here so fast, but I didn't know
  <u>that</u>. All passages had to be secured &amp; the Twelve
  hundred &amp; fifty dollars fare paid in to-day, the 15th, for
  the Holy Land Excursion, &amp; so I <u>had</u> to be here I
  thought -- but the first man I met this morning was the chief of
  the Alta bureau with a check for $1,250 in his hand &amp; a
  telegraphic dispatch from the proprietors of the Alta say "Ship
  Mark Twain in the Holy Land Pleasure Excursion &amp; pay his
  passage." So we just went down &amp; attended to the matter. We
  had to wait awhile, because the chief manager was not in &amp; we
  did not make ourselves known. A newspaper man came in &amp; asked
  how many names were booked &amp; what notabilities were going,
  &amp; a fellow (I don't know who he was, but he seemed to be
  connected with the concern,) said "Lt. Gen. Sherman, Henry Ward
  Beecher &amp; Mark Twain are going, &amp; probably Gen. Banks!" I
  thought that was very good -- an exceedingly good joke for a poor
  ignorant clerk.</p>

  <p>When my jolly old Captain came in, we squared accounts &amp;
  then went down to look at the ship (steamer Quaker City.) She is
  a right stately-looking vessel.</p>

  <p>My book will probably be in the booksellers' hands in about
  two weeks. After that I shall lecture. Since I have been gone,
  the boys have gotten up a "call" on me, signed by about 200
  Californians.</p>

  <p>Don't forget to remember me to Essie, &amp; "Lou," &amp; all
  the folks at 1312, -- &amp; tell my pet, Annie, that I will write
  her just as soon as the press of business is over. I will write
  Katie Lampton, too.</p>

  <p>Send letters to Metropolitan Hotel till further
  instructions.</p>

  <p>Yrs affictin<br />
  Sam.</p>

  <p>Scrap-book my letters in Alta.</p>
