<p>General Garfield --<br />
Dr Sir:</p>

<p>Several times since your election, people wanting office have asked me to "use my influence" with you in their behalf.  To word it that way was such a pleasant compliment to me that I never complied.  I <u>could</u> not, without exposing the fact that I hadn't any influence with you; &amp; that was a thing which I had no mind to do.  It seems to me that it is better to have a good man's flattering estimate of my influence&mdash;&amp; keep it&mdash;than to fool it away with trying to get him an office.</p>

<p>But when my brother on my wife's side&mdash;Mr. Charles J. Langdon, late of the Chicago Convention&mdash;desires me to speak a word for Mr. Fred. Douglas, I am not asked to "use my influence": consequently I am not risking anything.</p>

<p>So I am writing this as a simple citizen&mdash;I am not drawing on my fund of influence at all.  A simple citizen may express a desire, with all propriety, in the matter of a recommendation to office; &amp; so I beg permission to hope that you will retain Mr. Douglas in his present office of Marshal of Washington, if such a course will not clash with your own preferences, or with the expediences &amp; interests of your administration.  I offer this petition with peculiar pleasure &amp; strong desire, because I so honor this man's high &amp; blemishless character &amp; so admire his brave long crusade for the liberties &amp; elevation of his race.  He is a personal friend of mine, but that is nothing to the point&mdash;his history would move me to say these things, without that.  And to feel them, too.</p>

<p>With great respect,<br />
I am, General,<br />
Truly Yours<br />
S.L. Clemens.</p>
