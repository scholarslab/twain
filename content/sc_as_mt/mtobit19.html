  <p>The millions who have laughed over the writings of the
  gentle-hearted Mark Twain will grieve over his death. His life
  was used in bringing sunshine and happiness into the lives of
  others. He was a great and vivid writer and he will be remembered
  for ages. His tenderness and true manhood was perceptible beneath
  his humor. It is gratifying that this great writer was
  appreciated, honored and rewarded, as was his due, by the
  American people, and that his closing years, aside from his
  bereavements caused by the ruthless hand of death, have been
  years of ease and happiness.</p>
