    <font size="+1">CLEMENS IS DEAD BUT MARK TWAIN LIVES</font>
  </center>

  <p>His name "of record" was Samuel Langhorne Clemens, but he
  lives in the affections of the world as Mark Twain. Through many
  years, he made the world laugh in pure healthful enjoyment. He
  made it chuckle and he made it think sane thoughts when it might
  have become gloomy or morose. In dying he caused grief for the
  first time.</p>

  <p>Perhaps one reason why Mark Twain gained so large a place in
  the hearts of his fellow men, was that men understood, or thought
  they understood him. Few writers have taken the public into their
  confidence in more pleasing and, at times, in more touching
  manner. Those who know most of the man's history are nowise
  surprised to hear the verdict of his physician, that he died of a
  broken heart.</p>

  <p>Americans at least, realize that underneath the bubbling
  humor, the gentle searching satire that are the most apparent
  characteristics of his later and better work, mere craftmanship
  aside, there is a solid foundation of solid good sense, broad
  sympathy, keen perception, quick, accurate observation, which
  drag from their hiding places false pretense, poor logic,
  counterfeit charity. Critics he had and will always have, because
  some natures seem unable to appreciate his genius. Mark Twain was
  never, even at the beginning a mere juggler of words. His quips
  were never aimless. His funny stories were funny for what there
  was in them. His "Prince and Pauper" has satire on the social
  order clothed in sobriety of style. His "Connecticut Yankee in
  King Arthur's Court," displays that satire in its more playful
  but no less effective aspect.</p>

  <p>It was in large part his ability to interpret and portray
  character and the condition of humanity that gave Mark Twain his
  great strength as a humorist. His philosophical outlook was by no
  means to be despised. How delightfully, how lightly he could
  pillory the villain, the fakir and the cheat! Mark Twain was one
  of the giants of American literature along with Irving, Hawthorne
  and Poe. His humor was less gentle than that of Irving, but it
  meant infinitely more, because it probed farther into the world
  soul. This perhaps was in part because the world dealt less
  gently with him, but chiefly because his perceptions were more
  rapier like.</p>

  <p>Mark Twain had his joys and his sorrows. He was acquainted
  with grief, and his fellow countrymen rejoiced with him and
  mourned with him because they recognized him as one of
  themselves. They envied him his pipe, his reprehensible habit of
  writing and smoking in bed, his disregard of the rules of mere
  convention, his affectations, which, perhaps after all were only
  acted satires. They admired the manhood that would not permit him
  the refuge of the bankruptcy court, but forced him into years of
  privation. They loved him for his ideal beautiful home life, his
  deep affection for and tender tributes to his wife and children.
  They will cherish his memory.</p>
