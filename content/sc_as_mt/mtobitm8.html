    <font size="+1">MARK TWAIN AS OUR EMMISSARY</font>
  </center>

  <p>Mark Twain had a large following of admirers who came to
  regard themselves as his personal friends. Many of them he never
  met. Most of them never saw him. All of them felt a certain
  relationship and were flattered by it. Men and women in all parts
  of our outspread domain, the men especially, cherished a private
  affection for him. They called him by his first name, which is
  the surest proof of abiding fondness. Andrew Jackson was known as
  "Andy"; Abraham Lincoln was simply "Abe" to every soldier boy;
  and as a later instance, we have "Teddy." Some men settle down to
  a kinship with the shirt-sleeve contingent, even when they seem
  indifferent to the favor of the plain multitude.</p>

  <p>Mark Twain never practised any of the wiles of the politician
  in order to be cheered at railway stations and have Chautauquas
  send for him. He did not seem over-anxious to meet the reporters,
  and he had a fine contempt for most of the orthodox traditions
  cherished by the people who loved him. Probably no other American
  could have lived abroad for so many years without being
  editorially branded as an expatriate. In some sections of our
  country it is safer to be an accomplice in homicide, or a
  stand-patter in politics, than it is to be an "expatriate." When
  Mr. Clemens chose to take up his residence in Vienna he incurred
  none of the criticism visited upon Mr. William Waldorf Astor.
  Every one hoped he would have a good time and learn the German
  language. Then when the word came back that he made his loafing
  headquarters in a place up an alley known as a <i>stube</i> or a
  <i>rathskeller</i>, or something like that, all the women of the
  literary clubs, who kept his picture on the high pedestal with
  the candles burning in front of it, decided that <i>stube</i>
  meant "shrine." You may be sure that if they can find the place
  they will sink a bronze memorial tablet immediately above the
  main faucet.</p>

  <p>Of course, the early books, such as "Innocents Abroad,"
  "Roughing It," and "The Gilded Age" gave him an enormous vogue in
  every remote community visited by book-agents. The fact that
  people enjoyed reading these cheering volumes and preserved them
  in the bookcase and moved some of the classics by E. P. Roe and
  Mrs. Southworth in order to make room for "Tom Sawyer" and
  "Huckleberry Finn," does not fully account for the evident and
  accepted popularity of Mark Twain. Other men wrote books that
  went into the bookcase but what one of them ever earned the
  special privilege being hailed by his first name?</p>

  <p>When a man has done his work for many years more or less under
  the supervising eye of the public, the public learns a good many
  facts about him that are in no way associated with his set and
  regular duties as a servant of the public. Out of the
  thousand-and-one newspaper mentions and private bits of gossip
  and whispered words of inside information, even the man in the
  street comes to put an estimate on the real human qualities of
  each personage, and sometimes these estimates are surprisingly
  accurate, just as they are often sadly out of focus.</p>

  <p>Joseph Jefferson had a place in the public esteem quite apart
  from that demanded by his skill as an actor. Players and readers
  of newspapers came to know in time that he was a kind and cheery
  old gentleman of blameless life, charitable in his estimates of
  professional associates, a modest devotee of the fine arts, a
  outdoor sportsman with the enthusiasm of a boy, and the chosen
  associate of a good many eminent citizens. When they spoke of
  "Joe" Jefferson in warmth and kindness, it was not because he
  played "Rip Van Winkle" so beautifully, but because the light of
  his private goodness had filtered through the mystery surrounding
  every popular actor. William H. Crane is another veteran of the
  stage who holds the regard of the public. It knows him as the
  kind of man we should like to invite up to our house to meet the
  "folks." The sororities throb with a feeling of sisterhood for
  Miss Maude Adams because the girls feel sure that she is gracious
  and charming and altogether "nice."</p>

  <p>Mark Twain would have stood very well with the assorted grades
  making up what is generally known as the "great public" even if
  he had done his work in a box and passed it out through a
  knot-hole. Any one who knew our homely neighbors as he knew them
  and could tell about them in loving candor, so that we laughed at
  them and warmed up to them at the same time, simply had to be
  "all right." Being prejudiced in his favor, we knew that if he
  wanted to wear his hair in a mop and adopt white clothing and
  talk with a drawl, no one would dare to suggest that he was
  affecting the picturesque. He was big enough to be different. Any
  special privilege was his without the asking. Having earned 100
  per cent. of our homage he did n't have to strain for new
  effects.</p>

  <p>His devotion to the members of his family and the heroic
  performance in connection with the debts of the publishing house
  undoubtedly helped to strengthen the general regard for him.
  Also, the older generation, having heard him lecture, could say
  that they had "met" him. Every one who sat within the soothing
  presence of the drawl, waiting to be shirked up on every second
  sentence with a half-concealed stroke of drollery, was for all
  time a witness to the inimitable charm of the man and the
  story-teller.</p>

  <p>The knowledge of his unaffected democracy became general. No
  doubt the housewives loved him for his outspoken devotion to
  home-cooking. Has any one told in public the anecdote of his
  tribute to an humble item in the bill of fare? It was at a dinner
  party in Washington. Senator Hearst was giving the dinner, and
  Mark Twain was the guest of honor. Here were two transplanted
  westerners who knew more about roughing it than ever appeared in
  a book. As the high-priced food was being served to them, they
  talked longingly of the old-fashioned cookery of Missouri. The
  Senator wondered if there was any real corned beef and cabbage
  left in the world. Mark Twain spoke up in praise of the many
  old-time dishes, reaching his climax when he declared that, in
  his opinion, "Bacon would improve the flavor of an angel!"</p>

  <p>Furthermore is it not possible that much of the tremendous
  liking for Mark Twain grew out of his success in establishing our
  credit abroad? Any American who can invade Europe and command
  respectful attention is entitled to triumphal arches when he
  arrives home. Our dread and fear of foreign criticism are still
  most acute. Mrs. Trollope and Captain Maryat lacerated our
  feelings long ago. Dickens came over to have our choicest wild
  flowers strewn in his pathway and then went home to scourge us
  until we shrieked with pain. Kipling had fun with us, and for
  years after that we trembled at his approach. George Bernard Shaw
  peppers away at long range and the "London Spectator" grows
  peevish every time it looks out of the window and sees a drove of
  Cook tourists madly spending their money.</p>

  <p>It is a terrible shock to the simple inlander, who has fed
  upon Congessional oratory and provincial editorials, when he
  discovers that in certain European capitals the name "American"
  is almost a term of reproach. The first-time-over citizen from
  Spudville or Alfalfa Center indicates his protest by wearing a
  flag on his coat and inviting those who sit in darkness to comes
  over and see what kind of trams are run on the Burlington. The
  lady, whose voice comes from a point directly between the eyes,
  seeks to correct all the erroneous impressions by going to the
  table d'hote with fewer clothes and more jewels than any one had
  reason to expect. These two are not as frequently to be seen as
  they were twenty years ago but they are still gleefully held up
  by our critics as being "typical."</p>

  <p>Probably they are outnumbered nowadays by the apologetic
  kind,--those who approach the English accent with trembling
  determination and who, after ordering in French, put a finger on
  the line so that the waiter may be in on the secret.</p>

  <p>There are Americans who live abroad and speak of their native
  land in shameful whispers. Another kind is an explainer. He
  becomes fretful and involved in the attempt to make it clear to
  some Englishman with a cold and fish-like eye that, as a matter
  of fact, the lynchings are scattered over a large territory, and
  Tammany has nothing whatever to do with the United States Senate,
  and the millionaire does not crawl into the presence of his wife
  and daughters, and Morgan never can be King, and citizens of St.
  Louis are not in danger of being hooked by moose. After he gets
  through the Englishman says "Really?" and the painful incident is
  closed.</p>

  <p>Every man is handicapped and hobbled when he gets out of his
  own bailiwick. The American is at a special disadvantage in
  Europe. If he cannot adapt himself to strange customs and social
  regulations, he thinks that he will be set down as an ignoramus.
  If he tries to nullify or override them he may be regarded as a
  boor or a barbarian. Once in a while an American, finding himself
  beset by unfamiliar conditions, follows the simple policy of not
  trying to assimilate new rules or oppose them, and merely goes
  ahead in his own way, conducting himself as a human being
  possessed of the usual number of faculties. This odd performance
  may be counted upon to excite wonder and admiration. Benjamin
  Franklin tried it out long ago and became the sensation of
  Europe. General Grant and Colonel Roosevelt got along comfortably
  in all sorts of foreign complications merely by refusing to put
  on disguises and to be play-acting. But Mark Twain was probably
  the best of our emissaries. He never waved the starry banner and
  at the same time he never went around begging forgiveness. He
  knew the faults of his home people and he understood intimately
  and with a family knowledge all of their good qualities and
  groping intentions and half-formed plans for big things in the
  future; but apparently he did not think it necessary to justify
  all of his private beliefs to men who lived five thousand miles
  away from Hannibal, Missouri. He had been in all parts of the
  world and had made a calm and unbiased estimate of the relative
  values of men and institutions. Probably he came to know that all
  had been cut from one piece and then trimmed variously. He
  carried with him the same placid habit of life that sufficed him
  in Connecticut, and because he was what he pretended to be, the
  hypercritical foreigners doted upon him and the Americans at
  home, glad to flatter themselves, said, "Why certainly he's one
  of us."</p>
