<p>Dear heart, I hope you are getting along nicely.  I want to send you a couple of reminders of that quaint darling, Marjorie Fleming, written when she was 6 years old.  One, a poem on the cold indifference of a mother-turkey who had lost 2 chicks by a tragic death:</p>

<p>"A direful death indeed they had,<br />
As wad put any parent mad;<br />
But she was more than usual calm,<br />
She did not give a single dam."</p>

<p>From her diary:</p>

<p>"To-day I pronounced a word which should never come out of a lady's lips it was that I called John a Impudent Bitch."</p>

<p>Then explains how she came to do such a thing.</p>

<p>Sleep sound, dearest!</p>

<p>Y</p>
