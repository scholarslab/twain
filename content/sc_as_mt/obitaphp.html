<p>Below are the main AP stories about MT's final illness
  and death. In most cases I've put them together from several
  papers; as is still the case today, local editors regularly cut
  and rephrased different parts of a story for their own paper. No
  one text could represent the way all Americans read about MT's
  passing. The versions below, however, are meant to be
  representative.</p>

  <p>On the day of his death the AP also sent out (for use as a
  sidebar) a sampling of some of MT's best-known or most
  characteristic aphorisms. Many papers printed the sayings,
  usually in a box that ran beside the story of his death. The
  dramatic way <i>The Denver Post</i> chose to display the
  one-liners is shown above. The AP also prepared <a href=
  "obitbio.html">a 1200-word biography</a> of Clemens' life and
  career as MT; although factually unreliable, it is a good guide
  to the way his times had come to see the shape, and thus the
  American meaning, <a name="a" id="a">of his</a> story.</p>
