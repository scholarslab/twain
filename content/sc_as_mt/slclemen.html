    <h2>MT as SL Clemens</h2>
  </center>

  <p>"SL. Clemens," or "S.L. Clemens," is probably the way MT most
  often signed himself, though I don't think anyone else called him
  that. This is a letter to Bliss, dated 7 July 1873, covering the
  manuscript of "The Jumping Frog, in English, then in French, then
  Clawed Back into English," and suggesting Bliss use the piece as
  the basis for a new, inexpensive pamphlet edition of previously
  published sketches. MT began writing to Bliss in 1867. At first
  he was "Sam. L. Clemens" at the end of the letters, then he
  became "Mark," "Mark Twain" and "Saml. L. Clemens." By August,
  1869, he was also signing as "Clemens," which was probably the
  most common way he identified himself to Bliss from that point
    on.</p>
