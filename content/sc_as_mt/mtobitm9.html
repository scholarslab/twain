    <font size="+1">Mark Twain, Artist</font>
  </center>

  <p>If necessity is the mother of invention, misfortune is the
  mother of literature. When Nathaniel Hawthorne was ejected from
  the Custom-House at Salem he went home in a despondent frame of
  mind, only to be greeted by his wonderful wife's pertinent
  remark, "Now you can write your book." He responded to this
  stimulus by writing the best book ever written in the Western
  Hemisphere, "The Scarlet Letter." We learn from a famous chapter
  in "Roughing It" that if Samuel Clemens had not gone to help a
  sick friend, or if his partner had received the note he left for
  him before starting on this charitable expedition, Samuel L.
  Clemens would have been a millionaire. This episode has since his
  death been printed in a list of the misfortunes that marked his
  romantic and tragic career. But if at that time Mr. Clemens had
  become a millionaire, and he missed it by the narrowest possible
  margin, he never would have become Mark Twain. He struggled
  against his destiny with all the physical and mental force he
  possessed. He tried to make a living by every means except
  literature, and nothing but steady misfortune and dire necessity
  made him walk in the foreordained path. Mark Twain always
  regarded himself as the plaything of chance; professing no belief
  in God, he never thanked Him for his amazing successes, nor
  rebelled against Him for his sufferings. But is ever there was a
  man whose times were in His hand, that man was Mark Twain.</p>

  <p>Mark Twain was a greater artist than he was humorist; a
  greater humorist than he was philosopher; a greater philosopher
  than he was thinker. Goethe's well-known remark about Byron, "The
  moment he thinks, he is a child," would in some respects be
  applicable to Mark Twain. The least valuable part of his work is
  found among his efforts to rewrite history, his critical essays
  on men and on institutions, and his contributions to
  introspective thought. His long book on Joan of Arc is valuable
  only for its style; his short book on the Shakespeare-Bacon
  controversy shows appalling ignorance; his defense of Harriet
  Shelley is praiseworthy only in its chivalry; his attack on
  Fenimore Cooper is of no consequence except as a humorous
  document; his labored volume on Christian Science has little
  significance; and when his posthumous essay on the "Meaning of
  Life" is published, as I am afraid it will be before long, it
  will surprise and depress more readers than it will convince.</p>

  <p>As a philosopher, Mark Twain was a pessimist as to the value
  of the individual life and an optimist concerning human progress.
  He agreed with Schopenhauer that non-existence was preferable to
  existence; that sorrow was out of all proportion to happiness. On
  the other hand, he had absolutely nothing of Carlyle's peculiar
  pessimism, who regarded the human soul as something noble and
  divine, but insisted that modern progress was entirely in the
  wrong direction, and that things in general were steadily growing
  worse. Carlyle believed in God and man, but he hated democracy as
  a political principle; Mark Twain apparently believed in neither
  God nor man, but his faith in democracy was so great that he
  almost made a religion out of it. He was never tired of exposing
  the tyranny of superstition and of unmasking the romantic
  splendor of medieval life.</p>

  <p>Mark Twain was one of the foremost humorists of modern times;
  and there are not wanting good critics who already dare to place
  him with Rabelais, Cervantes, and Moliere. Others would regard
  such an estimate as mere hyperbole, born of transient enthusiasm.
  But we all know now that he was more than a funmaker; we know
  that his humor, while purely American, had the note of
  universality. He tested historical institutions, the social life
  of past ages, political and religious creeds, and the future
  abode of saints by the practical touchstone of humor. Nothing
  sharpens the eyes of a traveler more than a sense of humor;
  nothing enables him better to make the subsequent story of his
  journey pictorially impressive. "The Innocents Abroad" is a great
  book, because it represents the wonders of Europe as seen by an
  unawed Philistine with no background; he has his limitations, but
  at any rate his opinions of things are formed <i>after</i> he
  sees them, and not before. He looks with his own eyes, not
  through the colored spectacles of convention. "Roughing It" is
  still a greater book, because in the writing of that no
  background was necessary, no limitations are felt; we know that
  his testimony is true. The humor of Mark Twain is American in its
  point of view, in its love of the incongruous, in its fondness
  for colossal exaggeration; but it is universal in that it deals
  not with passing phenomena, or with matters of temporary
  interest, but with essential and permanent aspects of human
  nature.</p>

  <p>As an artist Mark Twain already seems great. The funniest man
  in the world, he was at the same time a profoundly serious
  artist, a faithful servant of his literary ideals. The
  environment, the characterization, and the humanity in "Tom
  Sawyer" remind us of the great novelists, whose characters remain
  in our memory as sharply defined individuals simply because they
  have the touch of nature that makes the whole world kin. In other
  words, "Tom Sawyer" resembles the masterpieces of fiction in
  being intensely local and at the same time universal. Tom Sawyer
  is a definite personality, but he is also eternal boyhood. In
  "Huckleberry Finn" we have three characters who are so different
  that they live in different worlds, and really speak different
  languages, Tom, Huck, and Jim; we have an amazingly clear
  presentation of life in the days of slavery; we have a marvelous
  moving picture of the Father of Waters; but, above all, we have a
  vital drama of humanity, in its nobility and baseness, its
  strength and weakness, its love of truth and its love of fraud,
  its utter pathos and its side-splitting mirth. Like nearly all
  faithful pictures of the world, it is a vast tragi-comedy. What
  does it matter if our great American had his limitations and his
  excrescences? To borrow his own phrase, "There is that about the
  sun that makes us forget its spots."</p>
