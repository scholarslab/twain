    <font size="+1">Mark Twain -- An Appreciation</font>
  </center>

  <p>When it is a matter not of chance but of choice, it is
  interesting to note what book a great writer turns to in his last
  hours--what Eminence of that vast company to which he belongs he,
  about to die, salutes.</p>

  <p>Tennyson breathed his last with Shakespeare's <i>Cymbeline</i>
  in his hand, open at the place of that spritely dirge beginning
  with the stanza:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Fear not thou the heat o' the sun,<br />
    Nor the furious winter's rages;<br />
    Thou thy worldly task hast done,<br />
    Homer hast gone and ta'en they wages.<br />
    Golden lads and girls all must,<br />
    As chimney sweeps, come to dust.
  </blockquote>

  <p>It was this, we feel sure, rather than the drama itself, which
  especially engaged his dying eyes--this lyric, with its strangely
  playful solemnity and with a touch of quaintness that he, the
  Master of lyrics, had somehow missed and therefore wistfully
  regarded, accepting its novel illumination of his final vision.
  The lighter play of fancy commends itself to the old in their
  waning days, however seriously they may have taken themselves at
  their full strength; it gives vivacity and grace, even gaiety, to
  the lengthening shadows. Isaac, the name Sara gave the child of
  her barren years, means laughter.</p>

  <p>Now Mark Twain, for forty years, personally and in letters,
  the chief provoker of the world's laughter, when he was about to
  die, turned to Carlyle's <i>French Revolution</i>, not by way of
  reaction, but straightforwardly following the course of a passion
  that had ruled his life. He loved to regard men and women in the
  open, in action prompted by strong impulses. The characters which
  most strongly appealed to him were developed in this large
  atmosphere, and Carlyle was a master in the portrayal of such
  characters--the inside as well as the outside of them. Doubtless,
  too, Mark admired the master's vivid and picturesque description
  and narration as well as the complexity of expression which was
  so foreign to his own.</p>

  <p>But my object in alluding to the books selected by authors for
  reading in their last hours is to call attention to another
  instance which seems very significant. All my mature readers will
  easily recall the stories written for boys and girls by Juliana
  Horatio Ewing, some thirty years ago, showing a rarely delicate
  sense of humour and pathos. This author, in the face of death,
  turned to Mark Twain's <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> for delight and
  satisfaction. That is enough, it seems to me, to define Mark
  Twain's place in our modern humanism. The spiritual kinship which
  determined this selection is an infallible test, in the case of
  such a woman and at such a time, as to certain essential quality
  in this man's work that is of everlasting value. <i>Huckleberry
  Finn</i> appealed to Mrs. Ewing's sensibility as <i>Tom
  Sawyer</i> and <i>Life on the Mississippi</i> would have done,
  because it was a creative illumination of frank, genuine,
  red-blooded boyhood. It was a quality as native as Nature,
  spontaneous, expansive, with Nature's excesses; but it was
  humanly embodied, mightily self-conscious, imperatively demanding
  attention, after the haughty manner of buoyant youth. We are
  reminded of Rabelais's Gargantua entering Paris for his
  university course, on a mare as big as six elephants, the
  whisking of whose tail laid low a whole forest.</p>

  <p>The effectiveness of this quality of Mark Twain's imagination
  does not always depend upon external grandeurs and striking
  surprises. He wrote out of a living experience--that of a boyhood
  nourished in open spaces and stimulated by rough adventure, and
  of a manhood which, in all its contacts and world-wide
  wanderings, kept alive that boyhood. But he had also mental
  adventure, not subtly or complexly, yet widely, speculative.</p>

  <p>There was the same directness and openness here as in his
  regard of external things. He relished the autobiography of men
  who, like Benvenuto Cellini and Montaigne, frankly and boldly
  disclosed their most intimate dispositions and tempers, and he
  undertook one himself on so expansive a scheme that it could
  never have been completed, since the longer he lived the less
  were the chances of any conclusion of the ever-widening
  vista.</p>

  <p>The art which premeditatively determines the scope of its
  venture so that one sees at every step the curvature of its
  rounding up--in a word the literary art--was foreign to Mark
  Twain's nature. Some stories are self-limited and wind up
  themselves. Mark sometimes told such stories, but generally we
  note no conscious organisation of the material he has in hand, no
  literary method. Whatever art of expression was developed in his
  maturer work was an art which Nature made, not the result of
  syntatic discipline. In his <i>Joan of Arc</i>--the ripest fruit
  of his genius--the historic sequence gave him a constructive plan
  not apparent in work of his that was wholly inventive. He could
  not have written a play depending wholly upon invention, meeting
  the requirements of the art, to save his life, but he would have
  contributed to one made by an expert playwright out of his
  material just those features which would be indispensable to a
  great popular success.</p>

  <p>He always wanted room--the whole open sky--for his action. The
  requirement of literary and of the specially dramatic art, as
  generally understood, because of the concentration demanded,
  imposed a constraint he could not tolerate. But he was master of
  the eccentric drama, with limitless expansion and projection</p>

  <p>In his early career he drove hard and with Icarian boldness.
  So gigantic were some of his practical journalistic jokes when he
  was connected with the Virginia City <i>Enterprise</i> that he
  fled temporarily from the scene of his exploits to escape their
  reaction upon himself. There was much in his <i>Innocents
  Abroad</i> which appealed to only crude taste; but the book
  promised richer vintages of humour, and it won for him a
  world-wide popularity, which stimulated him to greater
  earnestness in a more natural use of experiences which were real,
  with however much of grotesquery and extravagance he invested
  them. It may seem strange to use such a word as "earnestness" in
  connection with a humorist's writings, as it would not be in the
  case of Charles Lamb. Mark Twain was not a humorist in the sense
  that Lamb was--the two were at antipodes. Mark inherited from
  nobody, but, if not as purposeful, he was as masterful as
  Rabelais, Cervantes, and Swift were. He was not learned or
  literary as those men, and had not their kind of conscious
  purpose, but there was a strain of earnestness in all his work--a
  Western strain. Walt Whitman got one year's big whiff of the West
  and it transformed him, made him vastly panoramic and megaphonic.
  Mark Twain, like Lincoln, was a native of the West, and, like
  him, though in so different a vein, was gigantically in earnest.
  What stern stuff was in him was shown in the wreck of his
  personal fortunes, like that shown in Lincoln when the fortunes
  of the nation were at stake.</p>

  <p>Lincoln passed away before Mark Twain became famous. He found
  his greatest relaxation and relief from the stress of grave
  responsibilities during the war in the writings of professional
  humourists like Artemus Ward and Petroleum Nasby. Did he miss
  something in not having Mark Twain's humour? For the purposes
  served by those other writers, possibly not. Mark, with all his
  drollery, might have borne down too heavily upon him at such a
  time, however much he might have enjoyed him at another. The two
  men had too much in common, in their natural mood and strain.</p>

  <p>If in the main course of his writings--those which have had
  the widest appreciation--he so far retained boyhood himself, and
  embodied it in his characters, regardless of age or sex, for
  Colonel Sellers was a boy in one way and Joan of Arc in
  another--yet his was not a case of arrested development. He did a
  man's work manfully. The mature attitude toward life became
  apparent in his own maturity--a deepened spiritual sensibility;
  and a considerable proportion of his work is the outcome of this
  riper growth.</p>

  <p>In his maturer work, Mark Twain showed a finer and gentler
  touch, grotesquery yielding to grace. This was apparent in his
  personality as well as in his work. Misfortune, though repaired,
  did its work in him.</p>

  <p>His griefs, which were irreparable, subdued his spirit. His
  loneliness after the death of his wife was inconsolable, but the
  absent sweetness dwelt in his nature to the end. What the
  loneliness meant for him I could see, on a well-remembered
  occasion, when, at a luncheon given to a friend and his wife on
  their departure for Europe, Mark "toasted" them, expressing the
  hope that if either should be drowned in shipwreck that fate
  might be shared by the other!</p>

  <p>It is not likely that the future estimate of Mark Twain's work
  will very greatly differ from that put upon it now by his most
  thoughtful readers, the products of his maturer genius--I do not
  thereby mean his latest, but those in which his earnestness
  counts most for human meaning and value--may come to have their
  just place in the general popular esteem.</p>
