<p><u>Private</u> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New York, Nov. 28, 1868.</p>
<p>My Dear J. H.:</p>

<p>Sound the loud timbrel!--&amp; let yourself out to your most prodigious capacity--for I have fought the good fight &amp; lo! I have won!  Refused three times--warned to <u>quit</u>, once--accepted at last!--&amp; beloved!--Great Caesar's ghost, if there were a Church in town with a steeple high enough to make it an object, I would go out &amp; jump over it!  And I persecuted her parents for 48 hours &amp; at last they couldn't stand the siege any longer &amp; so they made a <u>conditional</u> surrender:--which  is to say, if <u>she</u> makes up her mind thoroughly &amp; eternally, &amp; I prove that I have done nothing criminal or particularly shameful in the past, &amp; establish a good character in the future &amp; <u>settle down</u>, I may take the sun out of their domestic firmament, the angel out of their fireside heaven.  (Thunders of applause.)  She felt the first symptoms last Sunday--my lecture, Monday night, brought the disease to the surface--Tuesday &amp; Tuesday night she avoided me &amp; could not do more than be simply polite to me because her parents said <u>NO</u> absolutely (almost,)--Wednesday they capitulated &amp; marched out with their side-arms--Wednesday night--she said over &amp; over &amp; over again that she loved me but was sorry she did &amp; hoped it would yet pass away--Thursday I was telling her what a <u>splendid magnificent</u> fellow you &amp; your wife were, &amp; when my enthusiasm got the best of me &amp; the tears sprang to my eyes, she just jumped up &amp; said she was <u>glad</u> &amp; <u>proud</u> she loved me!--&amp; Friday night I left (to save her sacred name from the tongues of the gossips--&amp; the last thing she said was: "Write <u>immediately</u> &amp; just as often as you can!"  Hurra!  (Hurricanes of applause.)  There's the history of it.</p>

<p>Oh, no--there isn't any persistence about <u>me</u>--certainly not.  But I am so happy I want to scalp somebody.</p>

<p>My fervent love to you both.  Write me, now--address 121 Williams Street.</p>

<p>I walk in the clouds again.  I bow my reverent head--thy blessing!</p>

<p>Mark.</p>
