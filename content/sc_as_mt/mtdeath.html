  <h3>Boston Daily Globe, Friday, April 22</h3>from Editorial Page,
  Editorial Points:

  <p>People who speak of Mark Twain simply as a humorist do not
  realize how much serious work he did. He had securely held the
  place of the leading American author for a long time before he
  died.</p>

  <p><b>Saturday, April 23</b><br />
  Mark Twain was a natural, not a forced nor a mere verbal,
  humorist. He was also the first great American humorist and had
  no professional predecessor among all the laugh-provokers of the
  ages. As American as Franklin or Lincoln, his worth, like theirs,
  is appreciated in every land where newspapers or books are
  read.</p>

  <p>The court jester of old had special privileges, and the
  obsequious and sycophantic paid homage to his drolleries in order
  to curry favor with the king.</p>

  <p>The jester of democracy has no license from a sovereign to
  "blow on whom he pleases," nor no patent whereby flatterers are
  led to pay homage to his mirth. The fierce light that beats upon
  a throne is moonlight unto sunlight compared with the glaring
  lime blaze in which the words of the popular humorist are
  tested.</p>

  <p>To withstand that test was a great achievement. Mark Twain did
  that, and more; for he never allowed his fun to fossilize into
  the somber platitudes with which some old men try to erase their
  reputations as laugh-makers and obtain standing in the ranks of
  the solemnly wise. He was a humorist to the last. His title was
  never disputed.</p>

  <p>Endowed with abilities which might have enabled him to win
  fame as an interpreter of life by means of serious language, he
  chose for his patroness the comic muse, and was loyal to his
  choice. Hence he was always young and his humor always new, "Age
  could not wither, nor custom stale, his infinite variety." Even
  amid sorrows that in most cases wring the heart till not even
  hope is left in it, he showered his mellow sunshine on the
  world.</p>

  <p>American in humor, he was also American in character. Beneath
  his radiant playfulness with kings and worlds and deep
  philosophies the chords of life responded to the touch of high
  ideals. His written and his spoken words were entertainers of
  peoples, presidents and princes. His unrecorded prayers were
  deeds.</p>

  <p>He had experience of life in all its salient ways yet found no
  road, however rough, that did not have a flower along its marge.
  Whether wanderer, wage earner, author, capitalist or insolvent,
  or wearing an academic crown, whether lover, husband, father,
  neighbor or friend, his private joys or griefs could not raise a
  bar between him and the millions that were gladdened by his
  smile.</p>

  <p>Nor can death come between him and the world. He will live in
  his works.</p>

  <p>Hail, then, thou weaver of lingering laughter, but not
  farewell.</p>

  <h3>The New York Times, Friday, April 22</h3>That Samuel L.
  Clemens was the greatest American humorist of his age nobody will
  deny. Posterity will be left to decide his relative position, in
  letters among the humorists of English literature. It is certain
  that his contemporary fame abroad was equal to his fame at home.
  All Europe recognized his genius, the English people appreciated
  him at his own worth, and the University of Oxford honored him
  with a degree. His writings commanded a higher price in the
  market than those of any other contemporary whose career was
  solely devoted to literature. His "public" was of enormous
  extent. From "The Jumping Frog" to the "Diary of Adam" everything
  that came from his pen was eagerly read and heartily enjoyed by
  multitudes.

  <p>Much that he wrote has already been forgotten, inevitably, and
  in spite of definitive editions and the admirably practical
  management of his business in the later years of his career. But
  nearly all that Jonathan Swift, Fielding, Sterne, and Smollett
  wrote has been forgotten, though their fame, resting on a few
  books, still lives. Artemus Ward, Mark Twain's greatest
  predecessor as a National jester, is now little more than a name.
  Nasby belonged exclusively to the Reconstruction period. For any
  American humorous writer it would be fit to compare with Mark
  Twain we must go back to Washington Irving. But the author of
  Knickerbocker's ironical history and the Sleepy Hollow legend did
  not surpass, in those denotements of the humorous genius, the
  author of "The Adventures of a Cub Pilot on the Mississippi" and
  "Huckleberry Finn." Indeed, it is hard to say that Irving ever
  surpassed Clemens. Without belittling the first great American
  prose writer we are compelled to doubt if posterity will name him
  in the same breath with the humorist who has just passed
  away.</p>

  <p>The "Innocents Abroad" and "A Tramp Abroad" are likely to be
  remembered among the great travel books of all time. Full of the
  audacity, the wild exaggeration and violent contrasts which
  distinguish the National humor, they are equally remarkable as
  the veracious record of fresh impressions on a fertile and
  responsive mind. Mr. Clemens's more serious works, such as "The
  Prince and the Pauper," an incursion into the field of historical
  romance. "A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur," and "Joan of
  Arc," have been read by multitudes with great delight. He has
  been quoted in common conversation oftener, perhaps, than any of
  his fellow-countrymen, including Benjamin Franklin and Lincoln.
  He has been honored by misquotations, too, and the humorous
  sayings of the ancients have been attributed to him, though he
  never borrowed. His wit was his own, and so was his extravagance,
  and his powers of observation never failed him.</p>

  <p>We have called him the greatest American humorist. We may
  leave it an open question whether he was not also the greatest
  American writer of fiction. The creator of Mulberry Sellers and
  Pudd'nhead Wilson, the inventor of that Southwestern feud in
  "Huckleberry Finn," which, with all its wildly imaginative
  details, is still infused with rare pathos, has certainly an
  undying vitality. An emotional and quite unconventional sort of
  man, Clemens was, whose early life was a hard struggle for
  existence. He obtained his education where he could get it.
  Presumably his faults were as large as his merits. Intellectually
  he was of Herculean proportions. His death will be mourned,
  everywhere, and smiles will break through the tears as
  remembrance of the man's rich gift to his era comes to the
  mourners' minds. However his work may be judged by impartial and
  unprejudiced generations his fame is imperishable.</p>

  <h3>The Atlanta Constitution, Saturday, April 23</h3><b>Mark
  Twain, World-Servant.</b>

  <p>Wherever in the civilized world men and women and little
  children love humor and cleanliness, sweetness and far-reaching
  insight into the universal human nature, there will be genuine
  mourning over the death of Samuel L. Clemens, "Mark Twain."</p>

  <p>Rarely has a single figure in our national literature towered
  with such unique and encyclopaedic distinction.</p>

  <p>Mark Twain was a profound humorist, paradoxical as that
  statement may seem. The shallow merry-maker with his quips and
  turns and cheaper puns and mental acrobatics is common enough in
  the story of the race. His is a faculty that barely scratches the
  surface of flesh and blood, lacking the ability to penetrate to
  the quick and touch the eternal humanities, whether they reside
  in the soul of the hyper-cultured product of the twentieth
  century, or the semi-barbarian on the outposts of
  civilization.</p>

  <p>And this is what Mark Twain accomplished, not spasmodically,
  but virtually in all of his written endeavors. Always he sounded
  the human note. It is true that his brand of humor and humorous
  philosophy, sometimes deftly screening a far more serious motif,
  was reflective of American thought and genius. But in America is
  a conglomerate of the world's races, an amalgam from the melting
  pot of the best and the worst of the old world, so that what
  civilization reverenced in Twain was the glimpse he gave it of a
  blend of itself, as typified in the universal American.</p>

  <p>Little of the slap-stick of the element of boisterousness may
  be found in the work of this master craftsman. Drollery there is
  in abundance, quaintness and charm of style abides alway,
  sustained and intuitive humor is never far absent from his elbow.
  But the cruder and more vulgar effects he avoided instinctively,
  bringing to bear a delicacy tempered with breadth.</p>

  <p>Men loved him not only for the fact that he gave them cheer,
  but that his quiet and unfailing courage gave them inspiration.
  He mocked at adversity. He combatted desolation with a smile and
  a sweet stubbornness that never acknowledged itself beaten.</p>

  <p>He was truly a world-servant. And world-wide is the wish that
  his sleep may be sound, broken only by those pleasant dreams that
  lighten the face of slumbering innocence with chastened
  smiles.</p>

  <h3>The Chicago Daily Tribune, Friday, April 23</h3>Alas, we can
  no longer smile at Mark Twain's celebrated jest that the reports
  of his death were "greatly exaggerated." The laugh which for
  years has rippled around the world has vanished, and on the
  coffin of Samuel Langhorne Clemens the nations of earth drop the
  tribute of their tears.

  <p>But it is not a mere farceur who lies dead today. He was,
  indeed, a fellow of infinite jest and peculiar fancy; he was far
  more than that, however. He could engulf the whole world in a
  tidal wave of mirth with "The Jumping Frog" or "Innocents
  Abroad," but he could also move it to tears with the pathos of
  "The Prince and the Pauper," sting it with the irony of "The Man
  Who Corrupted Hadleyburg," or freeze its blood with horror at the
  recitals of what Leopold did in the Congo. It is true that there
  are coarse pages in "Roughing It," but where is there a more
  lifelike transcript from nature than "Tom Sawyer" or "Huckleberry
  Finn"? So if the cap and bells lie on his bier today there are
  plenty of tributes to his other qualities to cover them from
  sight.</p>

  <p>Yet it was as a humorist that he made his reputation and place
  in American letters, and as such he will no doubt earn
  recognition from those who come to study his achievements in the
  future. Taste in humor is at best a fickle thing and not to be
  too much depended upon. Our fathers roared at Josh Billings,
  Artemus Ward, Seba Smith, and Orpheus C. Kerr, as they and we
  older ones have done at Mark Twain's earlier efforts. It remains
  to be seen whether our children will find "Innocents Abroad" and
  "Roughing It" as funny as we thought they were. Ward's humor in
  its evanescent qualities was much like the best of Twain, but the
  present generation finds "The Genial Showman" a trifle caviar
  today.</p>

  <p>It is not unlikely that Twain realized the shifting and
  uncertain reputation represented by the jester's bauble, and that
  this accounts for the varied nature of his literary output. It is
  certain that he set much more store on what he produced after
  1885 than on what he had done before, and that he not only
  dropped the Gargantuan laugh of "Roughing It" in his later years,
  but also confined much of his more glancing wit to after dinner
  speeches and interviews.</p>

  <p>This would account in part for his attempts at more serious
  things, his excursion into biography in his "Joan of Arc," his
  satires of society and politics, his melodrama, his
  identification with various civic movements, his delineation of
  boy life in "Tom Sawyer" and its companion book, and his serious
  effort at producing real fictional character divorced entirely
  from the element of laughter.</p>

  <p>At any rate, his humor, however it may be criticised, had a
  strongly native quality. This was as true of his finer as of his
  coarser moods. Andrew Lang speaks of Twain's "almost
  Mephistophelean coolness, an unwearying search after the comic
  side of serious subjects, after the mean possibilities of the
  sublime--these with a native sense of incongruities and a
  glorious vein of exaggeration, make up his stock in trade." This
  was certainly true of his earlier days, but for years he had
  substituted for those qualities a fine vein of wit which denies
  analysis as a soap bubble would. With added years his sense of
  humor took on, as he might have said, a more serious phase, and
  he used it valiantly as a weapon against corruption, hypocrisy,
  and cant.</p>

  <p>Well, whatever he was--jester, satirist, novelist, or
  reformer--he has left us the memory of many pleasant hours, of a
  life honestly and usefully lived, and of a most genial and
  lovable personality.</p>

  <h3>The Los Angeles Times, Friday, April 22</h3><b>Fresh May His
  Memory Remain.</b><br />
  It is the decree of fate that Mark Twain return to heaven, which
  loaned the genial humorist to us for a while. He has been
  intellectual sunshine to mankind for two generations.

  <p>[biographical summary]</p>

  <p>Samuel Clemens was a humorist philosopher. He was as
  philosophic as humorous. His humor dealt almost altogether with
  human nature in its everyday phases, almost in its crude forms.
  He was born one of the common people, and all his life in its
  formative stages was spent among plain people. There is not much
  edge to his jests. They play around their objects as sheet
  lightning flashes over the sky. They do not harm and never cause
  any fear of danger. But they go to the very heart of human nature
  and sound the depths of its aspirations, aims and hopes. In jest
  Clemens is what Dickens is in story. There is not the pathos that
  marks the "death of Little Nell," but there is as rollicking fun
  as in any page of the "Pickwick Papers."</p>

  <p>Sam Clemens was an American humorist. His jokes are broad and
  good-natured. There is the crudeness in them that is found in
  western life of fifty years ago. They lack the subtlety of French
  wit. The delicate touch, the fine point, are not there. It is the
  thought of the plain and of the mining camp whose color is
  caught, whose essence is distilled--not that of the drawing-room
  or boulevard.</p>

  <p>But that the soul of human nature is preserved in the writings
  of Mark Twain is shown by their popularity wherever the language
  is understood. A Boston audience laughed at Twain with as much
  glee as one in San Francisco. London enjoyed "Pudd'nhead Wilson"
  as much as New York. And in the Antipodes the Melbourne Larrigans
  laughed with as much abandon as a New York Bowery boy or a San
  Francisco hoodlum. Moreover, Oxford undergraduates and university
  dons sat side by side with the common herd of the street,
  "Townies" and "Gownies" both in uproar at Mark Twain's quaint
  jokes.</p>
