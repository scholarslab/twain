<p>P.S. -- I suspect that I have unsettled Mrs. Fairbanks' mind, somewhat, concerning her Elmira visit, by telling her how much more prostrated in health I found Mr. Langdon than I had expected, &amp; how inopportune I feared my late visit was, for that reason -- for I could not be blind to the truth that he needed quiet &amp; repose more than anything else, &amp; I don't carry much quiet among my baggage. And so you must mend this matter if you have i[t in your powe]r. You must write her that Mr. Langdon is a great deal better -- that is, if you can do it &amp; still approximate to the truth. -- Of course you needn't go &amp; tell the <i>whole</i> truth, as I have done, my dear contrary, obstinate, wilful, but always just &amp; generous sister -- I can't <i>help</i> telling the whole truth, (being similar to young George Washington,) but you <i>must</i>. Otherwise I will muss your hair again. I am afraid to write any more, because you were just a little severe the other day, you know. Good-bye, &amp; God give you His peace.</p>
