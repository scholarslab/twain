    <font size="+1">A GREAT MAN PASSES</font>
  </center><br />
  <br />
  Few men in American will be more missed than Mark Twain, for few
  were more beloved. Whether in the Middle West, where he was born
  and where he learned so much of men, or in the East where he
  lived in later life, Mr. Clemens was easily the first of American
  characters. Everybody knew of him and everybody felt that he was
  one writer whose touch was true and whose merit was real.

  <p>Mark Twain did what perhaps no other American has ever done.
  He created a distinct literature. There had been humorists before
  his time -- humorists who had been as original, as daring, and as
  successful as was he, but there had been no man who had succeeded
  in making literature of humor. All that went before was
  fragmentary, scattered and disjointed. He made it consistent,
  definite and wholesome.</p>

  <p>It is hard to dissect the qualities which made Mark Twain such
  a great literary figure. There is humor in all he wrote, except
  when he turned aside to write a children's story or a serious
  essay, but there is much more. He had all the powers of
  description which belong to one who knew the Book of Nature. He
  loved the river, he loved the fields, and he loved those flats
  along the Mississippi where the sun shines on the yellow sand and
  the cranes drowsily flap their dipping wings. He had, too, a deep
  knowledge of human nature, which made every character that he
  described live and breathe. He knew men, through and through.</p>

  <p>Mark Twain the man was as interesting as Mark Twain the
  humorist. The two, in fact, were one. The books were the man, and
  the man was the books. His view of life was sunny, and his nature
  was kindly, even when he had business adversity and domestic
  trouble which would have broken a less fortunate spirit. He had
  too a high sense of honor and a deep integrity and a true
  charity, shown in a hundred little incidents which he always
  tried to conceal. In 1895 the firm of C. L. Webster and Company,
  in which he was interested as a silent partner, went to the wall.
  Mr. Clemens was not responsible for the company's debts, but he
  assumed them, and began a long, exhausting lecture tour in order
  that he might return to the firm's creditors every dollar he
  thought himself in honor bound to pay. He did it, though his
  health was bad and the season was most oppressive. Then again, on
  the last day before he was finally stricken down, he signed his
  check for $6,000 to build a library in his town.</p>

  <p>These things showed the man, and for these things the American
  people loved him. They knew he was true and generous and kindly,
  and they saw in him that spirit which makes a man great.</p>
