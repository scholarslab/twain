  <p>Dear Captain:</p>

  <p>You must run down next voyage &amp; see us, if you can.
  Telegraph me what hour you will arrive &amp; I'll go to the
  station &amp; fetch you home. Mr. Wood stayed all night with us
  &amp; then joined the General in New York &amp; they went West
  together. I wanted the General to stop with us, too, but his
  business made it impossible.</p>

  <p>The American papers say the Royal Humane Society ought to give
  me a medal for "standing around on deck without any umbrella,"
  &amp;c. I suspect they mean a leather one.</p>

  <p>My wife is anxious that you should be put in command of the
  biggest Cunarder afloat, &amp; then she thinks the sea-sickness
  will deal less harshly by her. I hope also that you'll have a
  particularly big ship next May, for I <i>am</i> afraid my wife is
  going to have a hard time with sea-sickness.</p>

  <p>Yrs Faithfully<br />
  Sam.l L. Clemens</p>

  Capt. Mouland (forgot the initials -- as usual.)</p>
