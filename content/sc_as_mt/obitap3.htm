  </center>New York, April 23 -- Mark Twain paused today on the way
  to the grave that thousands whose lives he had made happy might
  look upon his placid face.

  <p>Most of those who gazed at the dead humorist in his coffin had
  never before seen the creator of "Tom Sawyer" and "Huckleberry
  Finn," but they felt that they knew Mark Twain intimately because
  of the humor and wisdom of his simple philosophy of life.</p>

  <p>The sentiment of the immense crowd of mourners -- they were
  sincere mourners -- was expressed in one of the few floral pieces
  that lay about the casket in the quaint old brick Presbyterian
  church. It bore no name. Instead, it carred the simple legend,
  "From one who has read 'Pudd'nhead Wilson.'"</p>

  <p>It was the tribute of the world to a man it knew most by his
  written words.</p>

  <p>The body reached New York shortly before noon in a private
  car, in which rode Mrs. Ossip Gabrilowitsch, Samuel Clemens' only
  surviving daughter, and her husband; Dan Beard, the artist,
  Twain's lifelong friend; James Langdon of Elmira; Katie Leary,
  for thirty years the housekeeper at Stormfield, and other house
  servants. At the head of the coffin stood Claude Benzollete, for
  many years Twain's valet, who refused to move from the side of
  his dead master.</p>

  <p>Only a handful of people met the body at Grand Central
  Station. No loving hands lifted it from the car to the hearse.
  That task was delegated to the undertaker and his assistants.</p>

  <p>Slowly the cortege drove to the old brick church, where the
  body remained until the funeral services began at 3 o'clock. The
  church filled quickly. Holders of tickets were admitted first.
  Millionaires and paupers rubbed elbows in the vast crowd that
  stood outside. The body, clad in the immaculate white serge suit
  which marked Twain in his old age, lay coffined in front of the
  altar. The only floral piece was a wreath garlanded by the hand
  of Dan Beard.</p>

  <p>At 3 o'clock the immediate family seated themselves in front
  of the coffin. Rev. Dr. Henry Van Dyke of Princeton and Rev.
  Joseph H. Twitchell of Hartford, Twain's old chums, robed in
  their vestments, took their places in the chancel. For a quarter
  of an hour the two ministers sat silent, their heads bowed in
  prayer.</p>

  <p>No sound was heard through the dark old edifice save a muffled
  sob. Dr. Twitchell, Twain's oldest and dearest friend, was
  convulsed with tears. His massive frame shook as he brushed the
  white locks from his forehead and gazed down into the face of his
  dead friend.</p>

  <p>Then Dr. Van Dyke rose and read the beautiful funeral service
  of the Presbyterian faith. At its conclusion he spoke briefly of
  Samuel L. Clemens, his friend, not Mark Twain, the author.</p>

  <p>"I shall speak no eulogy for our dead friend," he said simply.
  There was no trace of oratory in his voice. "The friends of
  Samuel Langhorne Clemens, whom all the world knew as Mark Twain,
  meet in the quaint place for a moment to look upon his face in
  tenderness and gratitude before his body is carried to rest in
  God's acre by those he loved so truly. Our friend would
  sympathize with our sentiments if he knew we were here, not to
  grieve for him, but to help the living to have braver, truer,
  sweeter sentiments in the presence of God's mystery.</p>

  <p>"This is not the time nor the place for eulogy for the famous
  writer, the honored representative of American letters in the
  world of literature. We are here reminded of the frailty of
  mortal flesh and the brevity of our way on earth. We think of
  Mark Twain not as a celebrity, but as a man whom we loved. We
  remember the reality that made his life worth living -- his
  laughing emnity of all sham; his love for the truth; his honesty;
  his honor.</p>

  <p>"We know how he met with adversity, toiling years to pay a
  debt of conscience, following the injunction to do all things
  honorably as well as all things honestly. We know how he loved
  his family and his fellow men. We knew Mark Twain and we loved
  him.</p>

  <p>"Nothing is more false than to think that the presence of
  humor means the absence of seriousness. It was the showing up of
  the unreal sham, the untruth, that made Mark Twain's humor. He
  was serious in his real humor. But we know that Mark Twain never
  laughed at the frail, the weak, the poor and the humble. He used
  his humor, but for things good and wholesome. He made fun without
  hatred. He laughed many of the world's false claimants out of
  court. Under all his humor he made us feel the pathos of life's
  realities, for he exposed the sham.</p>

  <p>"Now that he is gone, we who loved him -- and we all loved him
  who knew him -- will miss him. We are glad to give thanks that he
  left such an honorable name. We are glad he won such fame in the
  world of letters. We are glad, after so many shocks in his life,
  that he has gone into rest and a fullness of the enjoyment that
  is due to his honorable life."</p>

  <p>As Mr. Van Dyke took his seat, Dr. Twitchell walked to the
  altar, from which he might gaze down at Mark Twain's face. His
  voice was inaudible, and the tears poured down his cheeks as he
  asked God's blessing upon his friend, and the world's friend. He
  clasped the altar rail and seemed to be speaking to his old chum
  as he brokenly sobbed out a prayer.</p>

  <p>"Let not our sorrow prevent us from giving thanks for the gift
  of his love, his friendship, and his fellowship, which will be
  our chiefest memories of our dead friend and brother who has gone
  before us," was his supplication.</p>

  <p>"We thank God He has given the world to know of his tender
  love and friendship, the example of which has helped us all."</p>

  <p>He could say no more. There seemed to come over him the
  realization that his happy hours with his old chum would be no
  more. His lips faltered in a silent prayer as he fell back in his
  chair and buried his face in his hands. Dr. Van Dyke clasped his
  hand in the grasp of understanding.</p>

  <p>The funeral service of Mark Twain was at an end.</p>

  <p>Slowly the great crowd filed past the coffin in silent tribute
  to the dead.</p>

  <p>Until 10 o'clock tonight the body lay in state in the church,
  while throngs came off gay Fifth avenue and with bowed heads
  passed the form of the man who had lightened life's gloom with
  his humor.</p>

  <p>Later the body was conveyed to the private car of E. E.
  Loomis, vice president of the Lackawanna railroad, and started at
  2 a.m. for Elmira, where the burial will take place in the
  afternoon. The services there will be simple.</p>

  <p>Dr. Twitchell, who was to have conducted the services at
  Elmira, was recalled to the bedside of his sick wife in Hartford
  tonight, and the ceremony will be conducted by a local
  pastor.</p>

  <p>Mr. Clemens' body will be laid beside the bodies of his wife
  and children.</p>

  <p>Among the distinguished friends of the dead humorist in the
  church this afternoon were Will Carlton, Brander Matthews,
  William Dean Howells, Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Carnegie, Mr. and Mrs.
  Joseph Choate, James Lane Allen, Peter Finley Dunne, Sidney
  Porter, John B. Stanchfield of Elmira, Robert Underwood Johnson,
  H. H. Rogers, Jr., son of Twain's dearest friend; Col. Henry J.
  Harper of Harper &amp; Bros., Twain's publishers; Robert Bridges,
  and delegations from the Players', Authors', Century and Lotus
  clubs, as well as representatives from the Pilgrims' Society of
  New York and the Pilgrims' Society of London.</p>
