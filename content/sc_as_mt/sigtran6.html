  <p>Dear Mr. Hall:</p>

  <p>I don't believe Whitford. Webster was too big a coward to
  bring a suit when advised against it. The real mistake was in
  trusting law business to an ignorant, blethering gas-pipe like
  Whitford. I am not saying this in hatred, for I do not dislike
  Whitford. He is simply a damned fool -- in Court -- &amp; will
  infallibly lose every suit you put into his hands. If you are
  going to have any lawsuits with Gill, I beg that you will either
  compromise or have some other law conduct the thing.</p>

  <p>I am mighty sorry for you, but this result was to be expected.
  If I were you I would ask Whitford to present a modified bill --
  or better still, present it to the parties he won the case
  for.</p>

  <p>Merry Xmas to you! -- &amp; I wish to God I could have one
  myself before I die.</p>

  <p>Ys Ever<br />
  SLC</p>
