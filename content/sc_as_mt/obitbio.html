        New York, April 21 -- The mere chronology of Mark Twain's
        life is soon told. Like most dwellers in the imagination
        his significance to posterity lies, not as with men of
        action, in how he wrought upon events, but in how events
        wrought upon him, for from such actions resulted his
        imaginative output -- one of the most considerable of his
        time, and as it now seems, one of the most secure.

        <p>Briefly, then, Mark Twain was born Samuel Langhorne
        Clemens, in Florida, Mo., November 30, 1835.</p>

        <p>"My parents," he writes in his own burlesque
        autobiography, "were neither very poor nor conspicuously
        honest. The earliest ancestor the Twains have any
        recollection of was a friend of the family by the name of
        Higgins."</p>

        <p>The county chronicles have it that the elder Clemens
        failed in business and died, leaving his son the ample
        world to make his fortune in.</p>

        <p>Accordingly, Mark Twain's acquaintance with literature
        began with putting words into type, not ideas into words.
        Educated only in public schools, he was apprenticed to a
        printer at 13, and worked at his trade in St. Louis,
        Cincinnati, Philadelphia and New York, until at 18 he could
        gratify a boyish ambition to become a cub to a Mississippi
        River pilot.</p>

        <p>Both these happenings reacted profoundly in his later
        life. His knowledge of river life, acquired when he was a
        pilot, took form in "Tom Sawyer," "Huckleberry Finn," and
        "Life on the Mississippi," regarded abroad as his first
        title to fame.</p>

        <p>It even suggested his pseudonym, for "Mark Twain" is a
        leadsman's cry to the pilot in shallow stages.</p>

        <p>And his familiarity with printing turned him naturally
        first into newspaper work, then into creative writing, and
        finally into the publishing business wherein, like Sir
        Walter Scott, he suffered a bankruptcy disastrous to
        everything but his honor, and like Sir Walter again paid
        off with his pen debts not of his own making.</p>

        <p>In due time Mark Twain became a full-fledged pilot. He
        tells the rest of it himself in a chapter of "Life on the
        Mississippi." "By and by the war came, commerce was
        suspended, my occupation was gone.</p>

        <p>"I had to seek another livelihood, so I became a silver
        miner in Nevada, a gold miner in California, next a
        reporter in San Francisco, next a special correspondent in
        the Sandwich Islands; next a roving correspondent in Europe
        and the East; next an instructional torch-bearer on the
        platform, and finally I became a scribbler of books and an
        immovable fixture among the other rocks of New
        England."</p>

        <p>This was in 1872, two years after he had married Olivia
        L. Langdon of Elmira, N.Y., who brought him an independent
        fortune. At that time his writings were in great demand, he
        had an assured income, his own home, and seemed
        independent. But in 1876 his popularity as an author and
        his acquaintance with the mechanics of the publishing trade
        -- besides being a practical printer, he had been part
        owner of the Buffalo Press, before his marriage -- drew him
        into the firm of C. L. Webster &amp; Co., publishers.</p>

        <p>The firm brought out the memoirs of Gen. Grant and paid
        his widow $350,000, but its prosperity was short lived, and
        it failed with liabilities of $96,000. The failure had
        already taken $65,000 of Mark Twain's cash, but he
        determined also to shoulder the debts and to pay them off
        undertook in 1895-96 a lecture trip around the world.</p>

        <p>Mark Twain was an inveterate smoker and one of the most
        leisurely men in the world. An old pressman who was
        printer's devil in an office where Mark was an editorial
        writer tells this anecdote of his habits of work:</p>

        <p>"One of my duties was to sweep the room where editors
        worked. Every day Mark would give me a nickel to get away
        from him. He would rather die in the dust than uncross his
        legs. One day he gave me a nickel to dot an "I" in his copy
        for him. He certainly did enjoy life, that man did."</p>

        <p>Yet this easy going scribbler acquitted himself of a
        prodigious deal of work in his life and bound himself
        voluntarily to pay off debts that he could have discharged
        without hurt to his good name by passing through
        bankruptcy. He did not practice as he preached.</p>

        <p>"It don't make no difference," he had Huck Finn say,
        "whether you do right or wrong; a person's conscience just
        ain't got no sense and just goes for him anyway. If I had a
        yaller dog that didn't know no more than a person's
        conscience did, I'd pizen him. It takes up more room than
        all the rest of a person's insides, and yet ain't no good
        nohow."</p>

        <p>With Mark Twain's lecture trip around the world begins
        his international celebrity and his gradual rise into a
        figure taken in some sense to typify the American. From
        humorist he became the kindly, but mocking philosopher and
        moralist of "Pudd'nhead" Wilson. His literature output
        became more occasional and although written with more
        finesse, it was more critical and less creative. His public
        appearances became more frequent, his whimsical utterances
        gained greater currency, and a whole literature of
        anecdotes grew up behind him.</p>

        <p>Yale gave him the degree of M.A., and later of LL.D. in
        1901; the University of Missouri, his native State,
        followed with LL.D. in 1902; and in 1907 the University of
        Oxford with great ceremony made him Litt.D.</p>

        <p>Indeed, serious appreciation of Mark Twain, and as an
        artist and not a mere jokesmith, began abroad, but his true
        worth has long been recognized in this country.</p>

        <p>"Mark Twain's humor," said William Dean Howells, "will
        live forever. He portrays and interprets real types, not
        only with exquisite appreciation and sympathy, but with a
        force and truth of drawing that makes them permanent. He
        had the true humorist's tender heart and deep seriousness.
        Like Bret Harte, with whom he worked, like the great West
        that bred him, his most audacious sallies were terse and
        strongly grave. As a moralist, love of humanity, hatred of
        sham and the sense of duty formed his most ironic and
        debonair preachments."</p>

        <p>Four children were born to Mark Twain, of whom two, a
        son and a daughter, died early. One other daughter, Jeane,
        who had been an invalid for life, was found dead in her
        bath tub last fall at her home at Redding, Ct. Her tragic
        death greatly saddened her father, who declined in health
        from that moment. A third daughter, Clara, is Mrs. Ossip
        Gabrilowitsch, wife of the pianist, whom she married last
        year.</p>

        <p>Mark Twain's first book was "The Jumping Frog." His best
        known in this country possibly was "Innocents Abroad." His
        surest title to fame is generally believed to be "Tom
        Sawyer," and its companion volume, "The Adventures of
        Huckleberry Finn."</p>

        <p>In all his books had a sale of more than 500,000 copies,
        and were translated into six languages. Others among the
        better known are "A Tramp Abroad," "The Prince and the
        Pauper," "A Yankee in King Arthur's Court," "Pudd'nhead
        Wilson" (dramatized), "Joan of Arc," "A Double-Barrelled
        Detective Story," and "Eve's Diary."</p>

        <p>He left an unfinished autobiography, portions of which
        have appeared serially.</p>
