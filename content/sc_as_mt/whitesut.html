        <p>"...and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt
        and a full suit from head to toe made out of linen so white
        it hurt your eyes to look at it."</p><img src=

        <p>So wrote Huck Finn, in a passage MT wrote around 1880,
        about the "aristocratic" Colonel Grangerford (<i>left</i>, as drawn by E. W. Kemble). It wasn't
        until December, 1906, that MT himself started dressing this
        way (<i>right</i>). But it seemed so perfect a costume for him that most
        readers today invariably picture "Mark Twain" in white.
        When he wrote about the costume in his autobiography, MT
        gave hygiene as his reason for wearing white. It seemed to
        appeal to reporters and others mainly as a dramatic
        instance of his unconventionality. It's not clear whether
        anyone, including MT, associated the look with the Southern
        planters whom Samuel Clemens grew up envying and whom MT
        satirized in figures like Col. Grangerford.</p>

        <p>He first displayed himself in white at a Congressional
        hearing on copyright. He insisted on calling attention to
        the garb, but the reporters present were obviously
        delighted to publicize the event, to treat MT wearing white
        as a story the whole nation would be interested in.</p>
