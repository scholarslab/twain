<body background="../bkgrnd2.gif">
  <p>again. I have given Mrs. Fairbanks the little ring, &amp; she will have the engagement ring made. It seems unnatural not to see you this morning, you precious girl -- &amp; it seems odd not to find Mrs Langdon's [face] among the faces about me, or hear the pleasant cackle of that absurd cousin of yours -- I send her my very kindest regards. Give Mr. Langdon my love, please -- he is at home by this time.</p>

<p>With a fervent blessing, &amp; a prayer for you, &amp; many &amp; many a kiss, my dear Livy,</p>

<p>Sam[l. L. C.]</p>
