        <font size="-1">ELMIRA, N.Y.</font> April 24 -- Under a
        tent on the grassy slopeof the Langdon plot in Woodlawn
        cemetery, with rain beating fiercely against the canvas
        cover, a little group of mourners silently watched today as
        the body of Samuel L. Clemens was lowered into an
        evergreen-lined grave beside the bodies of his wife and
        children.

        <p>The Rev. Samuel E. Eastman, pastor of Park Church, and a
        close friend of the late humorist, conducted a brief and
        simple service, and Mark Twain's final pilgrimage was at an
        end. Tonight he lies sleeping under a grave piled high with
        flowers, the tribute of friends from far and near.</p>

        <p>There were present at the grave only members of the
        family party who came from New York today with the body, a
        former governess of the Clemens family, two of her friends,
        a sexton, and half a dozen newspaper men.</p>

        <p>Services had previously been held at the residence of
        Gen. Charles J. Langdon, where forty years ago Mark Twain
        married the general's sister.</p>

        <p>In keeping with Mr. Clemens' wish, the ceremony was
        simple. There was no music, no honorary pallbearers -- just
        the brief address and prayer of Dr. Eastman.</p>

        <p>The body lay in state in the very parlor where forty
        years ago the marriage took place, and some of those who
        attended the wedding were there today to look for the last
        time upon the face of their friend.</p>

        <p>Neither the Rev. Thomas K. Beecher, nor the Rev. Joseph
        Twitchell, who performed the wedding ceremony, was present,
        however. Mr. Beecher died several years ago, and Mr.
        Twitchell was called to Hartford by the serious illness of
        his wife, who died this morning.</p>

        <p>Among the floral gifts was a beautiful wreath bearing
        this inscription:</p>

        <p>"From five hundred boys of the Louisville Male High
        School, in remembrance of Mr. Clemens, who has brightened
        their lives with innocent laughter and taught them
        squareness and grit and compassion to the weak."</p>

        <p>The services at the house were public, but the
        attendance was not large. Besides the funeral party that
        accompanied the body from Redding, the little gathering
        included only a few relatives and old friends.</p>

        <p>Dr. Eastman said in part:</p>

        <p>"We are not here at this time to speak of the great man
        whose going hence the whole world mourns, nor to claim for
        him that place in the halls of fame which time only can
        give. We are here to weep with those that weep, to give
        thanks whose own he was in sacred bond of kinship and
        family affection."</p>

        <p>After the little group had looked for the last time upon
        the features of the dead, the coffin was closed and was
        borne to a waiting hearse. Outside a few curious onlookers
        stood in the rain as the procession started on its way to
        the cemetery, a mile or more away.</p>

        <p>Citizens of Elmira cherish fond memories of Mark Twain.
        With Mrs. Clemens and the children he had spent many happy
        summers at Quarry Farm, on East Hill, overlooking the city,
        at the home of Mrs. Susan L. Crane, Mrs. Clemens' sister. A
        path from the Crane house winds through the wooded grounds
        to the summer lodge which was Mark Twain's workshop. He he
        wrote "Roughing It," "A Tramp Abroad," and other works.</p>

        <p>Below this lodge, a short way down in the woods, is
        another rustic structure with barked roof, which the author
        built for his children. Here may still be seen many of the
        undisturbed playthings of the little ones.</p>

        <p>It was during the Quaker City expedition in 1867, which
        Mark Twain has immortalized in "The Innocents Abroad," the
        humorist met Gen. Langdon, then a young man, the son of
        Jervis Langdon, a distinguished and wealthy Elmiran.
        Langdon took kindly to young Clemens and the intimacy which
        grew out of the meeting led to the marriage of the author
        with Olivia Langdon.</p>

        <p>"I saw her first," wrote Twain of his wife in his
        autobiography, "in the form of an ivory miniature in her
        brother Charles' stateroom, in the steamer Quaker City, in
        the bay of Smyrna, in the summer of 1867, when she was in
        her twenty-second year.</p>

        <p>"I saw her in the flesh for the first time in New York
        in the following December. She was slender and beautiful
        and girlish and she was both girl and woman. She remained
        both girl and woman to the last of her life."</p>

        <p>Over Mrs. Clemens' grave, alongside the fresh one made
        today, stands a stone engraved with this epitaph:</p>

        <blockquote>
          "Warm summer sun, shine kindly here;<br />
          Warm southern winds, blow softly here;<br />
          Green sod above, lie light, lie light;<br />
          Good night, dear heart, good night, good night."
        </blockquote>
