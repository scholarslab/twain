  <p>That Samuel L. Clemens was the greatest American humorist of
  his age nobody will deny. Posterity will be left to decide his
  relative position, in letters among the humorists of English
  literature. It is certain that his contemporary fame abroad was
  equal to his fame at home. All Europe recognized his genius, the
  English people appreciated him at his own worth, and the
  University of Oxford honored him with a degree. His writings
  commanded a higher price in the market than those of any other
  contemporary whose career was solely devoted to literature. His
  "public" was of enormous extent. From "The Jumping Frog" to the
  "Diary of Adam" everything that came from his pen was eagerly
  read and heartily enjoyed by multitudes.</p>

  <p>Much that he wrote has already been forgotten, inevitably, and
  in spite of definitive editions and the admirably practical
  management of his business in the later years of his career. But
  nearly all that Jonathan Swift, Fielding, Sterne, and Smollett
  wrote has been forgotten, though their fame, resting on a few
  books, still lives. Artemus Ward, Mark Twain's greatest
  predecessor as a National jester, is now little more than a name.
  Nasby belonged exclusively to the Reconstruction period. For any
  American humorous writer it would be fit to compare with Mark
  Twain we must go back to Washington Irving. But the author of
  Knickerbocker's ironical history and the Sleepy Hollow legend did
  not surpass, in those denotements of the humorous genius, the
  author of "The Adventures of a Cub Pilot on the Mississippi" and
  "Huckleberry Finn." Indeed, it is hard to say that Irving ever
  surpassed Clemens. Without belittling the first great American
  prose writer we are compelled to doubt if posterity will name him
  in the same breath with the humorist who has just passed
  away.</p>

  <p>The "Innocents Abroad" and "A Tramp Abroad" are likely to be
  remembered among the great travel books of all time. Full of the
  audacity, the wild exaggeration and violent contrasts which
  distinguish the National humor, they are equally remarkable as
  the veracious record of fresh impressions on a fertile and
  responsive mind. Mr. Clemens's more serious works, such as "The
  Prince and the Pauper," an incursion into the field of historical
  romance, "A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur," and "Joan of
  Arc," have been read by multitudes with great delight. He has
  been quoted in common conversation oftener, perhaps, than any of
  his fellow-countrymen, including Benjamin Franklin and Lincoln.
  He has been honored by misquotations, too, and the humorous
  sayings of the ancients have been attributed to him, though he
  never borrowed. His wit was his own, and so was his extravagance,
  and his powers of observation never failed him.</p>

  <p>We have called him the greatest American humorist. We may
  leave it an open question whether he was not also the greatest
  American writer of fiction. The creator of Mulberry Sellers and
  Pudd'nhead Wilson, the inventor of that Southwestern feud in
  "Huckleberry Finn," which, with all its wildly imaginative
  details, is still infused with rare pathos, has certainly an
  undying vitality. An emotional and quite unconventional sort of
  man, Clemens was, whose early life was a hard struggle for
  existence. He obtained his education where he could get it.
  Presumably his faults were as large as his merits. Intellectually
  he was of Herculean proportions. His death will be mourned,
  everywhere, and smiles will break through the tears as
  remembrance of the man's rich gift to his era comes to the
  mourners' minds. However his work may be judged by impartial and
  unprejudiced generations his fame is imperishable.</p>
