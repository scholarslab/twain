  <title>Transcript, Letter to Livy</title>
</head>

<body background="../bkgrnd2.gif">
  <p><p>[<i>The first two sentences and three words below are from the previous page of the letter.</i>]</p>

  <p>[The other enclosed letter is from a most estimable young lady whose friendship I acquired in St Louis two years ago. She is a thorough Christian. She was a]
near neighbor of ours, &amp; my mother &amp; sister are very fond of her, &amp; of all her family. The letter won't interest you, but I thought I would send it because it would be such a good hint to you to send me all the letters which young gentlemen may chance to write to you, Livy -- (&amp; then I will go &amp; break their necks for them!)</p>

<p>I am going to bed, now, for I am in a hurry to get to Monmouth, where I know I shall get a letter from you. Leaving you in the loving protection of the Savior, &amp; the gentle guardianship of the angels, I bid you good-bye, &amp; kiss you good-night, my darling Livy.</p>

<p>Devotedly & always,</p>

<p>Saml. L. C.</p>
