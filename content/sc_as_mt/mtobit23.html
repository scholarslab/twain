  <p>The announcement of the death of Mark Twain yesterday will be
  received with sorrow all over the world. His kindly humor won for
  him a unique place in American life. Aside from his literary work
  he was known and appreciated. Domestic sorrow weighed heavily on
  him, and the recent death of his close friend, Mr. H. H. Rogers,
  accentuated his burden of sorrows. Even so, Mark Twain was
  cheerful to the end, his optimism being present to the last. He
  will be greatly missed. There is no other to take his place.</p>

  <p>We are now told by one of Mark Twain's publishers that the
  author probably left a fortune of more than a million dollars. It
  is estimated that over 5,000,000 of the humorist's books have
  been published in America, and abroad he was the best known and
  most widely read of all contemporaneous American authors, his
  works having been translated into many tongues. The publisher
  quoted says that the books of no other author, living or dead,
  are selling more rapidly to-day and he also tells us that no
  other author received more per work for his stories or was paid
  higher royalties for them in book form.</p>

  <p>Acceptable information this, not only because all of us loved
  Mark Twain and rejoice to know that his labors were substantially
  rewarded, but because it is gratifying to discover that it is
  possible for a man to make a million dollars honestly, and with a
  pen! It may be just as well to note, however, that it was not the
  desire to make money which caused Mark Twain to adopt literature
  as a career.</p>
