    <font size="+1">MARK TWAIN, HUMANIST</font>
  </center>

  <p>The news of Mark Twain's death will bring, to an extraordinary
  degree, a sense of personal loss to millions of his countrymen.
  For his writings, grotesque, humorous, serious, always revealed
  the vivid personality behind them. No other man of his time was
  so well known to the public in all his moods. Occasionally you
  find someone -- Alexander Butts of The Star was a conspicuous
  example in Kansas City -- who is so broadly human and has such an
  intense interest in every side of life that instinctively you
  feel acquainted after the briefest sort of meeting. Mark Twain
  was a man of this class. To him, as to the ancient philosopher,
  nothing human was foreign.</p>

  <p>The great inventor, the great statesman, the great writer, is
  the man who above all his fellows sees the importance of the
  obvious. His achievements seem so simple that people say, "Why
  didn't I think of that?" Theodore Roosevelt has been constantly
  charged with uttering platitudes. Louis Blanc complained that
  when Thiers spoke every fool in France exclaimed, "Why, that's
  just what I have been thinking!" In this universal human quality
  was the power of Mark Twain. He was much more than a humorist. He
  was a humanist. His writings were constantly illumined by flashes
  of the keenest insight into human nature. He knew what all of us
  feel and think, but what we are deterred from various reasons
  from saying. Consider, for instance, the characterization of the
  old fashioned Sunday which he imputed to Adam in his "Diary":</p>

  <blockquote>
    Sunday -- pulled through.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Which was the way all young people of a generation ago felt,
  but didn't say. His "Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs's Court,"
  "Tom Sawyer," "Pudd'nhead Wilson," and his travel books abound in
  observations of this sort. When he wrote of the Congo atrocities
  in a magazine article a few years ago he adopted the expedient of
  stripping King Leopold and standing him in front of a mirror to
  reflect on the futility of existence -- for after all a sovereign
  was only a bandy-legged, scrawny-armed creature, with nothing to
  distinguish him from the meanest of his subjects when once the
  trappings of royalty were removed.</p>

  <p>After the death of a daughter a dozen years ago Mr. Clemens
  wrote a moving bit of verse for one of the magazines. An
  editorial comment on it was printed in The Star and a copy of the
  paper sent him. His reply was so characteristic that it is worth
  printing:</p>

  <blockquote>
    I suppose we are all poets when we are under the stress of deep
    feeling, and that when the stress comes often we devote
    ourselves to poetry instead of prose, but are not moved to this
    when intervals of years supervene between the powerful
    impulses. I realize that my intervals are of the widest, and
    that consequently I am distinctly condemned to prose. Still, I
    am satisfied, for I was born indolent, and even the indolent
    can dig prose and get recreation and entertainment out of it.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Always beneath the humor was the deep feeling that belongs to
  the rich personality. Indeed, with Mark Twain, his humor was
  little more than the evidence of his sense of values. He had
  suffered deeply, but he never lost his sense of proportion and he
  found life worthwhile up to the very beginning of the end.</p>
