  <p>Friend Bliss:</p>

  <p>Yrs rec'd enclosing check for $703.35. The old "Innocents"
  holds out handsomely.</p>

  <p>I feel confident that House will make a most readable book.
  Shall write him what you say.</p>

  <p>I have MS. enough on hand now, to make (allowing for
  engravings) about 400 pages of the book -- consequently am
  two-thirds done. I intended to run up to Hartford about the
  middle of the week &amp; take it along; because it has chapters
  in it that ought by all means to be in the prospectus; but I find
  myself so thoroughly interested in my work, now (a thing I have
  not experienced for months) that I can't bear to lose a single
  moment of the inspiration. So I will stay here &amp; peg away as
  long as it lasts. My present idea is to write as much more as I
  have already written, &amp; then cull from the mass the very best
  chapters &amp; discard the rest. I am not half as well satisfied
  with the first part of the book as I am with what I am writing
  now. When I get it done I want to see the man who will begin to
  read it and not finish it. If it falls short of the Innocents in
  any respect I shall lose my guess.</p>

  <p>When I was writing the Innocents my daily "stent" was 30 pages
  of MS &amp; I hardly ever got beyond it; but I have gone over
  that nearly every day for the last ten. That shows that I am
  writing with a red-hot interest. Nothing grieves me now --
  nothing troubles me, bothers me or gets my attention -- I don't
  think of anything but the book, &amp; don't have an hour's
  unhappiness about anything &amp; don't care two cents whether
  school keeps or not. If I keep up my present lick three weeks
  more I shall be able &amp; willing to scratch out half of the
  chapters of the Overland narrative -- &amp; shall do it.</p>

  <p>You do not mention having received my second batch of MS, sent
  a week or two ago -- about 100 pages.</p>

  <p>If you want to issue a prospectus &amp; go right to
  canvassing, say the word &amp; I will forward some more MS -- or
  send it by hand -- special messenger. Whatever chapters you think
  are unquestionably good, we will retain of course, &amp; so they
  can go into a prospectus as well one time as another. The book
  will be done soon, now. I have 1200 pages of MS already written,
  &amp; am now writing 200 a week -- more than that, in fact;
  during past week wrote 23 one day, then 30, 33, 35, 52, &amp; 65.
  -- How's that?</p>

  <p>It will be a starchy book, &amp; should be full of snappy
  pictures -- especially pictures woked in with the letter-press.
  The dedication will be worth the price of the volume -- thus:</p>

  <p>[double underlined:]To the Late Cain;<br />
  This Book is Dedicated:<br />
  Not on account of respect for his memory, for it merits little
  respect; not on account of sympathy with him, for his bloody deed
  placed him without the pale of sympathy, strictly speaking: but
  out of a mere humane commiseration for him in that it was his
  misfortune to live in a dark age that knew not the beneficent
  Insanity Plea.</p>

  <p>I think it will do.<br />
  Ys Clemens.</p>
