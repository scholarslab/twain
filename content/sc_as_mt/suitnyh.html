        <p>Washington, D.C. Friday--Samuel L. Clemens, resplendent
        in a white flannel suit that smacked of the balmy breezes
        of a warmer clime, invaded the House of Representatives
        to-day and created a sensation. In defence of his clothes
        Mr. Clemens said that he had on plenty of underclothing and
        that he preferred brilliant and striking colors to the
        "dark and sombre clothes men usually wore and which had a
        melancholy and depressing effect" on him.</p>

        <p>"Besides," he added, "I am the president, vice
        president, secretary and treasurer and the only eligible
        man in the United States of the Ancient and Honorable
        Society of Purity and Perfection."</p>

        <p>"When a man gets to be seventy-one years old, as I am,"
        he continued, "he can wear the clothes he likes best
        without suffering that criticism which may come to him in
        his youth. The best clothes I ever saw anywhere were down
        in the Sandwich Islands, where when they dressed up for a
        state occasion nobody wore anything more than a pair of
        spectacles. Next to that I think I prefer the clothes of
        the middle ages, which were resplendent with colors, plumes
        and trapping of a brilliant hue.</p>

        <p>"Whenever I go to a theatre and see a lot of men rigged
        out in that abomination of all clothing, a dress suit, they
        remind me of a flock of crows. I like the peek-a-boo waist
        and the short sleeves and the low necked gowns of the
        women, for they are usually backed up by clothing of bright
        colors which relieve the eye. There is no reason why men
        should not wear brighter colored clothing, especially in
        these dark winter months.</p>

        <p>"Whenever I see a man wearing a plug hat I always
        suspect him. I remember W.D. Howells showed up in one not
        long ago. Howells was not made to be ridiculous, but he
        certainly had his opportunity on that occasion. Did I
        suspect him? Yes. I suspected him of being an ass and I
        didn't have to inquire about it either, for I knew he was
        one in wearing that hat. Howells is over there in the
        library now sweating it out with the committee in charge of
        the Copyright bill. He has no business there to-day, but he
        is too diffident to come away. You couldn't get him out of
        there with an offer of a week's wages. He won't hear
        anything that will do him any good or that he will want to
        remember next week."</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens declined to give his views of Congress
        because he said he was there on business before Congress,
        but after he got through he might have something to say. He
        told how, through the breaking of a house rule by Sunset
        Cox, he had been enabled to get on the floor and assist in
        the passage of the International Copyright law many years
        ago. To-day Speaker Cannon told him that he was prohibited
        by the rules of the house from even putting such a question
        to a vote, "although," said "Uncle Joe," "if I asked the
        house to admit Mark Twain to the floor I am sure the vote
        would be unanimous."</p>

        <p>The Speaker tendered him the use of his private office,
        where Mr. Clemens labored with members all afternoon to get
        their support for the Copyright bill now pending.</p>
