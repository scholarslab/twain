  <p> &#x00A0; "A good house" can mean "a lot of people in the audience."  That kind of "good house" certainly meant a lot to "Mark Twain," who spent much of his career performing in front of live audiences.</p>

<p> &#x00A0; For Sam Clemens, the phrase's literal meaning was also extremely important.  He grew up in the little house at the <i>left, below</i> (the postcard here shows a photo taken on his 1902 return to Hannibal).  After the success of Mark Twain's first books, Clemens moved his family to Hartford's exclusive Nook Farm neighborhood into the big house on the <i>right</i> (as shown in another postcard).</p>

  <p> &#x00A0; Fans of MT's Tom Sawyer like to remember him running away from home, or
  sneaking out of Aunt Polly's house for an adventure with Huck.
  But when Becky Thatcher asks Tom to draw her a picture, he
  produces the tribute to American middle class aspirations <i>at left</i>. The
 evidence suggests the real "artist" was not
  Treat Williams, who drew the other illustrations in <i>Tom
  Sawyer</i>, but MT himself. Despite the comic flavor of Tom's
  drawing, there's no question that Sam Clemens shared Tom's belief
  that a big house could make a man feel big too. At the very moment he was writing
  <i>Tom Sawyer</i>, he was mortgaging his future as a literary performer to
  the expense of constructing and maintaining that mansion in Hartford.  One good house was going to depend upon the other.</p>
