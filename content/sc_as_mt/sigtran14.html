<p>Farmington Avenue, Hartford.<br />
Dec. 1./74.</p>
<p>My Dear Miss Street:</p>

<p>I remember your father very well indeed.  His courtesies to us in Salt Lake City were of so pleasant a nature that even the fourteen years that have rolled by since have not sufficed to obliterate the memory of them.</p>

<p>And now after all this time I am to repay that debt with the base coin of an assumed name!  But you have asked it, &amp; so--as the Persians say--on your head be it!</p>

<p>Very Truly Yours<br />Sam.l L. Clemens<br />(<u>alias</u>) Mark Twain</p>
