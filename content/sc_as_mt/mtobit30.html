    <font size="+1">America Mourns for Mark Twain</font>
  </center>

  <p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN</font> -- to call him by the name
  held in affectionate regard by all Americans -- was a genuine
  product of the west and more particularly of the mining
  population of the Pacific slope. The broad, liberal spirit of
  humanity characteristic of "the early days" of California and
  Nevada found at the same time humorous and philosophical
  expression in his works. Nothing that was human was alien to his
  spirit and temperament. Although he pricked the follies of the
  time, his humor carried no sting and left no heart burnings.</p>

  <p>Mr. Clemens was easily the premier of the illustrious school
  of California humorists and writers of fiction that includes Bret
  Harte, Samuel L. Clemens, Ambrose Bierce and others of less note.
  He may be said to have learned his trade in the newspaper offices
  of San Francisco and Virginia City.</p>

  <p>It is an interesting and suggestive fact that California
  alone, of all the states, has produced a considerable body of
  literature racy of the soil. Other commonwealths and communities
  on this continent have produced writers of poetry, fiction and
  humor, but their product might have happened anywhere and is for
  the most part not rooted in the soil.</p>

  <p>Mark Twain was even more philosopher than humorist. His work
  is everywhere inspired by a hatred of shams and he took a real
  pleasure in exposing the solemn humbug. No man in America has
  contributed more to the sane outlook upon life.</p>
