    <font size="+1">A Great Author;<br />
    A True American</font>
  </center>

  <p>M<font size="-1">ARK TWAIN</font> is dead! In those four words
  America announces to a weeping world the loss of her foremost
  literary man. Assuredly of all our authors he was "first in the
  hearts of his countrymen."</p>

  <p>He was really the chief of our writers, by the only valid
  test. He could touch the emotional center of more lives than any
  other.</p>

  <p>He was curiously and intimately American. No other author has
  such a tang of the soil -- such a flavor of the average national
  mind.</p>

  <p>Europeans who complained that we denied Walt Whitman,
  misunderstood Emerson and admired only those who write in old
  world fashions should be satisfied, at least, with Mark Twain,
  and our unwavering taste for him.</p>

  <p>He was our very own, and we gathered him to our hearts.</p>

  <p>In ages to come, if historians and archaeologists would know
  the thoughts, the temper, the characteristic psychology of the
  American of the later nineteenth century he would only need to
  read "Innocents Abroad," "Tom Sawyer," and "Huckleberry
  Finn."</p>

  <p>Mr. Clemens' books were the transcript of his life. And that
  life was the kind of life that the average American man of his
  time has believed in and admired.</p>

  <p>He was the man that hated dogmas and philosophies and loved a
  flash of intellectual light.</p>

  <p>He was the man that cared much to get rich, yet will sweat
  blood to pay his debts. A man of boundless optimism, who has
  never troubled to understand the great tragedies of nations.</p>

  <p>To the superficial view he was merely a humorist -- a humorist
  of international fame, to be sure -- but just a humorist. But
  there was far more than jocularity in his writing. If Cervantes
  "laughed away the chivalry of Spain," Mark Twain laughed away a
  hundred silly foibles of his somewhat too ebullient American
  friends and admirers.</p>

  <p>He had, too, that greatest of all elements in the humorist,
  the power of pathos. With the twist of a few words he could lift
  the applauding hand to dash away a tear. And often, just between
  the laugh and the cry, there was a place where he drove home a
  truth in a way that no philosopher or moralizing theorist could
  hope to equal.</p>

  <p>He portrayed the life of the lands he knew and loved in his
  youth -- the wide, unfettered lands of the Mississippi and the
  farthest West -- in a way to make that life appreciated and loved
  around the world. Foreign critics likened him to Le Sage and gave
  him an even prouder place in the temple of fame.</p>

  <p>Sham disgusted Mark Twain, but he did not attack it with
  fierce intensity. He merely made it ridiculous, and so banished
  it. He set men to laughing at their own folly and brought them
  unconsciously to the paths of common sense. He would have
  chuckled had anyone called him a great reformer with a serious
  mission in life, yet in his graceful way he worked out reform
  after reform in manners and customs, and would not pose for
  applause.</p>

  <p>He made his place as a man as well as an author, and he gave
  to the youth of the land an example of rugged honesty well worth
  their emulation. When financial disaster whelmed his publishing
  house it would have been easy for him to have evaded his debts
  and escaped his creditors. But he was not run in that sort of
  mold. Like Walter Scott before him, and our own William T.
  Coleman in a narrower field, he buckled down to work, tossed away
  all legal technicalities and paid off every dollar of his debts
  so he could face the world with a clear eye, even if in a
  threadbare coat. And fortune came to him again as a reward for
  his honest toil, so his later years were spent in comparitive
  ease and affluence.</p>

  <p>In his home life he was genial and in his friendships a true
  comrade. His hand was ready to help those in need, and his
  optimism was an inspiration for all who yearned for faith to see
  through the clouds of to-day the sunshine of tomorrow. Ever the
  friend and counselor of the children, he got from his little
  friends the insight into their lives that enabled him to write
  two books that, had he written nothing else, would have made his
  name immortal.</p>

  <p>California and Nevada are especially proud and unusually fond
  of this great hearted gentleman; for it was in this far West that
  he began his career and found his first inspiration. Many will
  take down the well-thumbed volumes from the shelves and go over
  again lovingly the passages that made Samuel L. Clemens a
  fireside friend and a boon companion of the men and women,
  cultured or homely, in all the Western land.</p>
