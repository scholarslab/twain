    <font size="+2">Mark Twain</font>
  </center><br />
  <br />
  When Samuel L. Clemens, better known as "Mark Twain," died, there
  passed from this earth a world character. Wherever civilization
  was, or touched, his pen name, at least, was known. Mr. George
  Kennan found in an obscure Siberian village but two things to
  remind him of home, one a sackful of peanuts and the other a
  dilapidated copy of "Innocents Abroad." The natives knew not how
  to eat the peanuts, nor, in all probability, had one of them the
  slightest inkling as to the contents of the book. Yet both were
  there, sure precursors of a better day to come.

  <p>When one of its members dies, Congress adjourns in respect to
  his memory. Now that Mark Twain has passed away, the world will
  pause, if but for a moment, in its work and its play, its
  planning, and money-getting, to honor him. For thousands that
  never saw him felt that they knew him, and knew that they loved
  him.</p>

  <p>It has been said of Emerson that he lifted the idols of men
  from their pedestals and placed them reverently on the ground.
  Mark simply poked the false gods in the ribs, and they came down
  of their own accord. Herein lay his great work, that he
  mercifully emancipated human beings from their foolish prejudices
  and their foolish selves. His was not the cynicism of the world
  weary, but the sturdy irreverence of eternal boyhood, and his
  never failed to embody something of his nature in his works, or
  to impart it to his readers.</p>

  <p>We have wept with him at the grave of Adam, gathered "dornics"
  with him in the Holy Land; we have stayed behind and counted the
  silver spoons with the czar after this irrepressible had passed,
  and then hastened on to join him again. We have traveled up and
  down the Mississippi with him and Huck Finn and the Dolphin, and
  together have hobnobbed with real royalty. We have studied art
  with him, to much profit, and have come to know, under his
  guidance, that a good way to tell a St. Sebastian was by the
  arrows, and that it was a man's inalienable right to say that
  Turner's pirate ship looked like a "yellow tomcat expiring in a
  platter of stewed tomatoes," if we thought that way.</p>

  <p>Now that he has gone, the world will seemingly go on as
  before. None knew this better than he. And yet there is a
  conviction that the scheme of life has altered for his having
  lived here; that sham and pretense can never rule as fully again
  as before he came laughing along.</p>

  <p>And how sympathetic he was! How quickly responsive to the true
  nobility in man, wherever found, in high or low! He never
  ridiculed the right.</p>

  <p>Tears and smiles for loved Mark Twain! Tears for the passing
  of such a soul from earth, and smiles in memory of his work and
  in the assurance of his happiness beyond.</p>

    <dt>Old Innocence has gone abroad, and</dt>

    <dd>the sea is wide between.</dd>

    <dt>I saw his hand on the misty wheel as</dt>

    <dd>he steered for the darkened main</dd>

    <dt>He took his laugh and he took his pipe</dt>

    <dd>and the place where his heart had been,</dd>

    <dt>And he crossed the bar where the</dt>

    <dd>waters gulped the plumb-line below mark twain.</dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
    <dt>He has steered from the flats and the</dt>

    <dd>yellow flood that he knows from bed to brim</dd>

    <dt>To the greenish gush of a stranger</dt>

    <dd>wave that bathes every western star;</dd>

    <dt>And "Give me my glasses," I heard him</dt>

    <dd>say--for the night of the Lord is dim,</dd>

    <dt>And the salt spray blinds and the</dt>

    <dd>wind cuts cold as the ship sails out by the bar.</dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
    <dt>'Twould be time to weep for the good</dt>

    <dd>gray head that is lost in the driving spray</dd>

    <dt>Were there not in my study window</dt>

    <dd>here a boy with a puckered lip,</dd>

    <dt>And he whistles shrill, "Oh, Buff'lo</dt>

    <dd>gals, ain't you coming out today?"</dd>

    <dt>So I know tonight that he'll join</dt>

    <dd>Huck Finn and go for a pirate trip.</dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
    <dt>'Twould be time to weep for the one</dt>

    <dd>that's gone did the boys he loved go, too,</dd>

    <dt>But Tom and Joe and Sid and Huck</dt>

    <dd>on my study shelves I spy.</dd>

    <dt>So good-by, Mark Twain, may you steer</dt>

    <dd>far out; may the wheel at your helm turn true;</dd>

    <dt>And I'll keep Tom straight while</dt>

    <dd>you're off to sea, and for Huck--well, Mark, I'll try.</dd>
