<p>Huck Finn "don't take no stock in dead people," but the
  death of Samuel Clemens was treated in all parts of the country
  as a major event in America's history. It also provided an
  occasion for writers and readers, journalists and critics, to
  assess the significance and achievement of "Mark Twain" -- in his
  times and for all time.</p>

  By the time he died in 1910, Mark Twain was perhaps the
  best-known national celebrity. His final illness, death and
  funeral were treated as front page news across the country. Most
  papers relied on the Associated Press reports of these final
  events; by clicking on the paper at left, you can see how the AP
  covered the story.</p></td>

<td><p>  Clemens' funeral was a small gathering in Elmira, where his wife
  and daughters were already buried. But to allow his public a
  chance to pay their respects, his body was first taken to New
  York City, where thousands saw it in the Presbyterian Brick
  Church. The viewing was open to the public, but if you had a
  ticket like the one at left you could be admitted first. By
  clicking on it here, you can see a series of photographs of this
  final "performance."</p></td>

<p>Most newspapers also ran their own obituary
  editorials reflecting on MT's life and work. This archive
  contains 28 editorials. You can access them geographically by
  clicking on the map at left. Exploring the editorials this way
  helps see how, although writers talked about MT as an "American" figure,  
different regions tended to emphasize different
  aspects of his character and career, treating him as a
  midwesterner, a westerner, and so on. (It's curious that I
  haven't yet found a southern paper that showed any interest in
  discussing him as a southerner.)</p></td>

  Many newspapers commissioned their staff cartoonists to create
  drawings to give graphic significance to the occasion. Twelve
  cartoons from around the country are gathered into a portfolio
  you can open by clicking at left. These drawings provide another
  way to see how "Mark Twain's" legacy was summed up.</p>

  Between the end of April and the end of 1910, many American
  magazines published their own appraisals, recollections and
  tributes to MT. These pieces are longer, and intended to be more
  thoughtful and definitive, than the newspaper notices. Many were
  written by MT's friends and acquaintances. Twelve such essays,
  from eleven magazines, are available at present here.</p>

<p>Thanks to the virtual properties of an electronic archive, you
  can also do a computer search of all the obituary notices to look
  for specific words, and so check for specific patterns and
  features in the way his times valued MT. It's interesting, for
  example, to see whether "Tom" or "Huck" is mentioned the most --
  and what other characters and novels are singled out. Given MT's
  antipathy to Walter Scott, it's noteworthy how often he is used
  as a point of reference. You can search for words like "west" or
  "race," "humorist" or "novelist," "debt" or "wealth," or . . .</p></td>
