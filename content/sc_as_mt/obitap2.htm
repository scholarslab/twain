  </center>New York, April 22 -- The funeral of Samuel L. Clemens
  (Mark Twain), who died at his home outside of Redding, Conn.,
  last evening, will be held at 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon at the
  Brick Presbyterian Church, at Fifth avenue and Thirty-seventh
  street. The Reverend Dr. Henry Van Dyke, of Princeton, who was a
  close friend of the humorist for many years, will conduct a very
  simple service, after which the body will be taken to Elmira for
  interment.

  <p>The second service, at the home of Gen. Langdon of Elmira on
  Sunday afternoon, will be as simple as the first. The Rev. Joseph
  Twitchell, of Hartford, to whom Mark Twain used to refer as the
  only pastor he ever had, will conduct the service, at which only
  Mrs. Ossip Gabrilovitsch, the sole surviving member of Mark
  Twain's family; her husband, members of the Langdon family, and
  the closest friends of the dead writer will be present. The
  interment will be in the Clemens lot, where Mrs. Clemens and the
  children of Mark Twain are buried.</p>

  <p>Beside the simple service at the Brick church, there will be,
  some time within the next ten days, a memorial service held by
  the many prominent men in all walks of life who desire to show
  their respect for the dead writer. Arrangements for this memorial
  service had not taken form today, but those in charge said that
  the design was to have the meeting public and in some auditorium
  that would accommodate the large number of people who would
  desire to attend. The meeting's program will be one of music and
  short addresses by admirers of the work of the philospher and
  humorist.</p>
