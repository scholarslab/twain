    <h3>Mark Twain</h3>
  </center>The report of Mark Twain's death on the 21st of April,
  this time not "greatly exaggerated" but sadly and literally true,
  was the occasion of heart-felt grief to the entire nation, we may
  almost say to the whole world. No American of our time was more
  widely known; no other American writer lately among the living
  had endeared himself to so large and cosmopolitan an audience.
  His life, ended midway in its seventy-fifth year, had been rich
  in human experience, had fulfilled the season of mellow
  fruitfulness, and had given literary expression, as few other
  lives have done, to the qualities of buoyancy and independence so
  characteristic of the typical American temperament. It was also a
  life which, in its personal aspects, revealed the qualities of
  manliness and sympathy, was admirable in its public and private
  relations, and bore with fortitude the buffets of ill-fortune.
  These are tests of character which few men can suffer without
  some show of weakness; his character they served only to sweeten
  and strengthen.

  <p>Mark Twain's life may be divided into two nearly equal parts.
  Of the first part, which includes his boyhood days, his
  experiences as a journeyman printer and editor, his brief career
  as a Mississippi pilot, his briefer career as a Confederate
  soldier, and his adventures in the mining-camps and rude
  settlements of the West, we have the most vivid of records in his
  books--in "Tom Sawyer" and "Huckleberry Finn" and "Roughing It,"
  and in the countless short stories and sketches which began with
  "The Jumping Frog" and are probably not yet at an end, for only a
  part of the work which he humorously styles his "Autobiography"
  has been put into print. Those early days left him with a fund of
  recollections upon which his drafts were honored--as was
  similarly the case with Bret Harte--for long years after the
  experiences themselves had become old (although not unhappy) far
  off things. As the recorder of these phases of pioneer life which
  he knew at first hand, and of which he almost alone has preserved
  for us the very form and pressure, we are immeasurably in his
  debt. There are few things that we know as well as what it was to
  be a bay in a Missouri country town, a futile skirmisher in the
  early days of the Civil War, and a traveller on the lower
  Mississippi, few bygone types that are as real to us as the
  miners and stage-coach drivers and politicians and barroom
  loafers of the untutored West of the midcentury. The writings in
  which these things have been preserved for us are Mark Twain's
  best, because they are his raciest and least self-conscious.</p>

  <p>The next best group of his books is provided by "The Innocents
  Abroad," "A Tramp Abroad," and "Following the Equator," the three
  extensive records of unconventional travel. Yet in these the
  touch of sophistication is seen, and becomes progressively
  pronounced with each succeeding narrative. The second is not as
  good as the first, and the third is distinctly weaker than the
  second, more artificial in its conception and more forced in its
  humor. When the author transplanted himself to the East for
  permanent residence in the seventies, he abandoned the primal
  sources of his inspiration, and never developed others of
  comparable importance. Going farther and farther afield in search
  of fresh material, he illustrated anew the myth of Antaeus, and
  displayed a pitiable weakness. Over some of his later
  flounderings in the alien elements of literary criticism,
  history, and metaphysics, it were best discreetly to draw a veil.
  There was in him a streak of the Philistine which might have
  remained undetected had he "kept to his last," but which was
  sharply revealed when he infringed upon the domain of
  intellectual and scholarly concerns.</p>

  <p>The present is not, however, the best occasion for dwelling
  upon Mark Twain's limitations, or for emphasizing the ephemeral
  character of a considerable part of his work. A fair share of
  that work, at least, stands upon a level so high as to be in no
  danger of passing out of sight. Up to an advanced point in his
  career, he grew steadily in power and wisdom; his sympathies
  became ever broader and deeper, and his expressive faculty kept
  pace with the larger demands that were made upon it. From the
  exuberant journalist who gave us entertainment in his earlier
  days he developed into something like a sage to whom we came to
  look no less for counsel than for amusement. We learned to detect
  in his homely speech the movings of a fine spirit, instinct with
  the nobler promptings of democracy, hating shams and ostentatious
  vulgarity, gentle and gracious in its quieter moods, but fanned
  to burning indignation when facing some monstrous wickedness,
  such as the corruption of our political life, or the dastardly
  act of the American soldier in the Philippines who betrayed his
  rescuer and shamelessly boasted of the shameful deed, or the
  infamy of the royal libertine who distilled a fortune from the
  blood of the miserable natives of the Congo. Even more than by
  his strictly literary work, he earned our gratitude for the brave
  words which he spoke upon such themes as these, words that
  cleared the moral atmosphere and made us see things in the light
  of naked truth.</p>

  <p>Nor should we, in our tribute to the man, forget the silent
  heroism with which he endured loss of fortune in his advancing
  years, and shouldered the burden of a debt incurred by the
  rascality of his associates, a debt for which he was only
  indirectly responsible, and which he might have evaded without
  serious impairment of his reputation. The strenuous labors of the
  years of lecturing and writing which enabled him to discharge in
  full the shadowy obligations which he then assumed took their
  toll of his vitality, but won for him an esteem higher than is
  ever the reward of the artist alone. This action ranks with the
  similar examples set by Scott and Curtis; it is one of those
  shining deeds that reveal the man himself, in contradistinction
  to the works by which most men of creative genius are contented
  to be known.</p>

  <p>The attitude of criticism toward Mark Twain as a writer has
  undergone a slow but complete change during the past thirty
  years. From being thought of simply as a "funny man," of the kin
  of Josh Billings and Artemus Ward, he has gradually come to be
  recognized as one of our foremost men of letters. This is a
  profoundly significant transformation of opinion, and to account
  for it fully would require a more careful analysis than we here
  have space to undertake. The recognition has been unduly delayed,
  partly because so much of his output has been utterly unworthy of
  his best self, and partly because his work in its totality is of
  so nondescript a character. The conventional way to distinction
  in literature is by the fourfold path of the poem, the play, the
  novel, and the essay. Occasionally, also, an historian compels
  literary recognition. But Mark Twain was neither a poet nor a
  playwright nor an historian. he was hardly a novelist, either,
  for his share in "The Gilded Age" does not seriously count, and
  his work in the form of fiction is not remarkable as
  story-telling pure and simple. If we are to group him at all, it
  must be with the essayists, using that term elastically enough to
  include with him our own Irving, and such Englishmen as Swift and
  Carlyle. We must either do this, of fall back upon the <i>sui
  generis</i> solution of the problem. Again, if we make a
  subdivision of the essayist class for the humorists alone, we
  encounter the difficulty offered by our obstinate association of
  that term with mere fun-making and the appeal to the lighter
  interests of human nature. Obviously, our subdivision must take
  yet another step, and admit that, on the one hand, there are
  humorists who make us laugh and have hardly any other influence
  over us, and humorists who are also creative artists, and critics
  of life in the deeper sense, and social philosophers whose
  judgments are of weight and import. If we are to classify Mark
  Twain at all, it must be with the latter distinguished company;
  and his title to kinship with the three English writers above
  mentioned, and even with such alien prototypes as Aristophanes
  and Rabelais and Cervantes, is at least not scornfully to be put
  aside.</p>
