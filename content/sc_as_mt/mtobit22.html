    <font size="+1">Mark Twain.</font>
  </center>

  <p>The world has had three colossal laughers: Aristophanes of
  Greece, Rabelais of France and Mark Twain of America; and it is
  not impossible that the last will finally be ranked first.</p>

  <p>For greatness in humorous literature is as much a matter of
  variety and range of subject as of power and art; and in the
  scope and richness of his subject-matter Clemens, the
  nineteenth-century American, surpassed the sixteenth-century
  Frenchman and the Greek of the fifth century before Christ. The
  world of the Athenian was the Mediterranean world, that of the
  Parisian the European world, but that of the Yankee was the whole
  world; and the modern materials of humor and wit are far more
  numerous and far richer than those of medieval and ancient
  days.</p>

  <p>Mark Twain was an American of such sort as only western
  pioneer American could create, and his humor was American to the
  core. Living the rough life of the Mississippi pilot and the
  western miner and reporter, he accumulated funds of hard but
  humorous experience that he, like Cervantes, turned to literary
  account. Out of it came "Roughing It," which made the country
  laugh till its sides were sore, to be followed by such stories or
  novels of humor as "Innocents Abroad," "Tom Sawyer," "Huckleberry
  Finn" and "Pudd'nhead Wilson." There were other works, sixteen or
  more of them, but those named best reveal his genius for
  humorously exaggerated description and sarcastic wit. No other
  writer so vividly portrayed the irresponsible American boy or so
  adequately expressed the big-hearted, homespun, violent life of
  the wild west.</p>

  <p>Twain's character had its serious side, to which Joseph
  Twitchell, his pastor at Hartford, Conn., paid public tribute;
  and when the failure of his publishers ruined him he played the
  hero as nobly as Scott and Grant and redeemed his fortunes. But
  he will be remembered as America's colossal laugher; and
  Huckleberry Finn, Pudd'nhead Wilson and Tom Sawyer will live with
  Falstaff, Gargantua and Sancho Panza.</p>
