        <p>Mark Twain (Samuel L. Clemens) has had made for him a
        suit of white evening clothes of white broadcloth, as
        immaculate as newly fallen snow. The buttons are covered
        with the same material. When he arrays himself he will
        undoubtedly wear with the suit white enameled leather
        shoes. The genial humorist has long been in rebellion
        against the sombre clawhammer effects borrowed from the
        court of France.</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens has decided that his new evening wear shall
        be supplemented by a long Spanish cloak which can be thrown
        over the shoulder. Such garments were worn by grandees and
        cavaliers.</p>

        <p>This broadcloth is of a soft finish. The suit was cut in
        strict accordance with the prevailing mode. The coat is
        lined throughout with white silk, and the lapels are faced
        with the same material. The collar is of cloth, for it was
        thought that white velvet, which was permissible, would
        easily become soiled. The coat is adorned with three white
        buttons in front and two at the back. The waistcoat, which
        has three buttons, is of the same material as the coat. Its
        only ornamentation is a white zig zag embroidery around the
        edges. The trousers have a white silk braid down the
        outside seams.</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens was not fond of black silk hats, and with
        his new white suit he will probably wear a gray Fedora. He
        has also a new light gray overcoat.</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens announced a year ago that he would
        henceforth wear white because it corresponded to the
        original costume mentioned in "Adam's Diary." After
        publicly pleading guilty to a seventieth birthday not long
        ago, he said he considered himself about old enough now to
        wear what he pleased.</p>

        <p>Care of all his white wardrobe, which consists of
        fifteen suits, is no easy task for the humorist. He is
        obliged to send two of them to the cleaner every week. He
        sent word yesterday evening that he was too busy to discuss
        from an aesthetical point of view the reasons for his
        sartorial innovation.</p>

        <p>News of the new style spread rapidly among builders of
        clothes. Several of them said they were glad to know Mr.
        Clemens had had the courage to break away from the usage
        that made uncompromising black the only wear for men after
        six o'clock in the evening. They also said the Spanish
        cloak was a great improvement over the usual type of cape
        overcoat. Young's tailors said they had the suit fashioned
        for Mr. Clemens and that it was the first of the kind.</p>
