  <p>The world today is voicing the thought which seems
  simultaneously to have come to call, that Samuel Clemens (Mark
  Twain), the report of whose death at his home in Redding, Conn.,
  this time is not "exaggerated," was the foremost figure in an
  important field of literature -- the American school of
  letters.</p>

  <p>In estimating Mark Twain's place in English literature, the
  dead humorist today is most frequently mentioned in connection
  with another great American, Abraham Lincoln, for the significant
  reason that both expressed so characteristically the pure
  American spirit.</p>

  <center>
    <b>Europe Praises Twain</b>
  </center>From abroad comes praise of Twain. From England, from
  France, Germany and Italy, the abiding places of the world's
  great literary past, is heard appreciation of the position he has
  gained, not through imitation of the literary wealth that
  preceeded him, but through writing that is distinctly American
  and completely original.

  <p>"The American Chaucer" is the London Evening Standard's
  estimate of Twain's position in literature.</p>

  <p>"Like Chaucer," it says, "he kept a hospitable heart for what
  was good and healthy. Since the death of Charles Dickens no
  writer of English has been so universally read, and at the moment
  of his death Mark Twain was known as only one other living writer
  was known. Mark Twain and Count Tolstoi are inheritors of
  world-wide fame."</p>

  <center>
    <b>A German Estimate of Twain</b>
  </center>The Berliner Zeitung am Mittag, during a two-column
  estimate of Mr. Clemens' work, expresses the opinion that the
  American writer was loved in Germany more than is the whole body
  of French and English humorists, because his humor turned
  fundamentally upon serious and earnest conceptions of life. The
  paper says that the American works most widely read in Germany
  are probably those of Emerson and Mark Twain.

  <center>
    <b>T. R. Had His Books in Africa</b>
  </center>"It is with sincere regret that I learned of the death
  of this great American author," said Roosevelt in Paris. "His
  position, like that of Joel Chandler Harris, was unique not only
  in American letters, but in the literature of the world."

  <p>"He was not only a great humorist, but a great philosopher,
  and his writings form one of the assets in America's contribution
  to the world of achievement of which we have a right as a nation
  to be genuinely proud."</p>

  <p>In the pigskin library which Mr. Roosevelt carried through the
  jungles of Africa were two of the late author's books,
  "Huckleberry Finn" and "Tom Sawyer," and Mr. Roosevelt says that
  he read both of them several times and always with the greatest
  interest.</p>
