  <p>Dear House --</p>

  <p>I have come up to the study to answer you. Mrs. C. &amp; I had
  just read your (no, Koto's) letter. As I left, I said "What shall
  I say for you?"</p>

  <p>"That I am on my knees."</p>

  <p>It doesn't wholly express her shame &amp; sorrow &amp;
  humiliation for forgetting to send those measurements, but it
  helps. Blamed if we don't forget <i>every-</i>thing, it seems to
  me. We <i>live</i> in shame; &amp; yet are not hardened. We feel
  as sharply &amp; blush as red as we used to do in our earlier
  days when we did remember something now &amp; then. Koto is a
  saint -- but we knew that before; &amp; don't expect anything but
  saintliness out of her; she is built that way, &amp; it probably
  comes in a manner easy to her: but how is it <i>you</i> don't fly
  out? Is the whole family laying for canonization?</p>

  <p>Indeed it was a shame &amp; a pity; but Mrs. Clemens always
  has her hands so full that I always think her excusable when she
  forgets a thing. She is the only one in the tribe who ever does
  remember.</p>

  <p>We are hoping the dress will get here in time, to-day.</p>

  <p>I didn't forget to send that lingo-letter; I merely
  misunderstood Mrs. Clemens; I thought she had concluded to send
  it herself. I must explain that "Tom" is a girl -- Daisy Warner
  -- who plays "Tom Canty" when the children do the Prince &amp;
  Pauper private theatricals. Susy is rather gushy, but I suppose
  it's the natural thing for 14-year-olders. They seem to run a
  good deal to italics &amp; double adjectives; &amp; even then
  they appear to think they have but coldly expressed
  themselves.</p>

  <p>Here is love to you both, from us all, &amp; thanking you for
  your fine leniency --</p>
