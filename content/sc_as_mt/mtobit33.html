    <font size="+1">"MARK TWAIN."</font>
  </center>

  <p>There is scarcely in this wide land a person of any
  acquaintance with contemporaneous literature who does not mourn
  sincerely the passing of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, known more
  frequently by his pen name of "Mark Twain." Among his admirers,
  also, we may freely reckon those who do not ordinarily read much
  and may never have enjoyed a book or story by this gifted author.
  Mark Twain had become in his later years a national character,
  famed for his broad philosophy, his interviews on public
  questions and his great kindness of heart and his sweetness of
  disposition. His frequently expressed his humorous and apt
  opinions at a time when humor and liberality were needed, so that
  his outpourings acted upon the troubled public temper much as oil
  upon the raging waters. He could at times be terribly severe, as
  in his strictures upon Leopold and the Congo maladministration,
  but his customary view of life and its incidents was tolerant,
  though often whimsical. The subtle sense of humor and its
  companion justice never departed from him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Clemens was first of all a jester, just as some writers
  are satirists and others have gifts of poetic expression. He
  belonged to a school which developed a dozen or so of notable
  associates half a century ago. In pure genius as a humorist of
  the American type Mark Twain was little if any inferior to
  Artemus Ward, who was the father of them all. He had the same
  gift of seeing unerringly beneath the surface, of saying the
  totally unperceived, of adducing grotesque similarities and
  associations, and the same splendid humanness and optimism. His
  humor was not entirely "funny," it was not wit in the common
  sense, but was the produce of a mind working along unconventional
  and unique lines in delightful and refreshing ways. His point of
  view was ever surprising, but not the less readily grasped and
  after a little experience "reading Mark Twain" was as easy and
  restful as listening to the strains of a sweet and simple melody.
  We all remember how all the world burst into a simultaneous laugh
  when it learned that Clemens had shed pious tears at the grave of
  his ancestor Adam and when it read how he expressed ignorance of
  that celebrity to the guide who showed him the relics of
  Columbus. The western miner "Scott's" interview with the minister
  whose services were desired at a funeral was as rich and
  mirth-provoking as Artemus Ward's brief encounter with a maiden
  lady whom he disturbed when he went up onto his rooftop with a
  gun to celebrate the arrival of a new member in his family.</p>

  <p>In his more mature years, however, Mr. Clemens made frequent
  incursions into soberer literature, or fiction, and here such
  troubles as he ever had with the critics began. It has always
  seemed to us that some of these gentry were influenced by
  resentment because a humorist had dared to attempt novelism. His
  most famous work, "Pudd'nhead Wilson," "A Connecticut Yankee at
  King Arthur's Court," "Joan of Arc," "The Gilded Age," which he
  wrote in connection with Charles Dudley Warner, and several other
  pretentious compositions certainly to our mind entitle him to a
  real place in English literature. His humorous instinct often
  forced him from more magnificent construction, but not always,
  and in his really serious moments he showed another side to his
  literary powers that will be recognized when his detractor's lips
  are shut.</p>

  <p>Mr. Clemens was an usually [gentle?] and companionable man. He
  was an inveterate hater of fraud and hypocrisy, as his writings
  in and out of season testified. His private integrity, as in the
  case of Sir Walter Scott, impelled him in his old age to return
  to the lecture platform that he might repay a heavy obligation
  incurred by the collapse of a publishing venture in which he was
  interested. He made restitution to the last penny, although his
  health even then had begun to fail. It is particularly saddening
  in reflecting upon the life and character of this fine American
  to recall the poignant sorrows which fell to his lot in his
  latter years and probably shortened his days. But these he bore
  with a patient resignation that endeared him further to his
  fellow men.</p>
