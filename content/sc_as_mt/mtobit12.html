    <h3>Fresh May His Memory Remain.</h3>
  </center>It is the decree of fate that Mark Twain return to
  heaven, which loaned the genial humorist to us for a while. He
  has been intellectual sunshine to mankind for two generations.

    <b>[<font size="-1">OMITTED BIOGRAPHICAL SUMMARY</font>]</b>
  </center>

  <p>Samuel Clemens was a humorist philosopher. He was as
  philosophic as humorous. His humor dealt almost altogether with
  human nature in its everyday phases, almost in its crude forms.
  He was born one of the common people, and all his life in its
  formative stages was spent among plain people. There is not much
  edge to his jests. They play around their objects as sheet
  lightning flashes over the sky. They do not harm and never cause
  any fear of danger. But they go to the very heart of human nature
  and sound the depths of its aspirations, aims and hopes. In jest
  Clemens is what Dickens is in story. There is not the pathos that
  marks the "death of Little Nell," but there is as rollicking fun
  as in any page of the "Pickwick Papers."</p>

  <p>Sam Clemens was an American humorist. His jokes are broad and
  good-natured. There is the crudeness in them that is found in
  western life of fifty years ago. They lack the subtlety of French
  wit. The delicate touch, the fine point, are not there. It is the
  thought of the plain and of the mining camp whose color is
  caught, whose essence is distilled--not that of the drawing-room
  or boulevard.</p>

  <p>But that the soul of human nature is preserved in the writings
  of Mark Twain is shown by their popularity wherever the language
  is understood. A Boston audience laughed at Twain with as much
  glee as one in San Francisco. London enjoyed "Pudd'nhead Wilson"
  as much as New York. And in the Antipodes the Melbourne Larrigans
  laughed with as much abandon as a New York Bowery boy or a San
  Francisco hoodlum. Moreover, Oxford undergraduates and university
  dons sat side by side with the common herd of the street,
  "Townies" and "Gownies" both in uproar at Mark Twain's quaint
  jokes.</p>
