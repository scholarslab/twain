  <p>[I saw an old friend of mine at breakfast a while ago, (ex-Gov. Fuller,) &amp; he gave me a lot of notices of my New York lecture delivered 18 months ago. I inflict them on you, -- for why <i>shouldn't</i> I? The house was crowded, on that occasion, but it was not my popularity that crowded it. The exertions of my friends did <i>that</i>. They got up the whole thing] -- suggested it, engineered it, &amp; carried it through successfully. If any man has a right to be proud of his friends, it is I, thy servant. The <i>Tribune</i> notice is by Ned House, who ranks as the most eminent dramatic critic in the Union.</p>

<p><i>Good</i>-bye, Livy. All this time I have felt just as if you were here with me, almost -- &amp; part of the time as if I could <i>see</i> you standing by me. But you are vanished! I miss a gracious presence -- a glory is gone from about me. I listen for a dear voice, I look for a darling face, I caress the empty air! God bless you, my idol. Good-bye -- &amp; I send a thousand kisses -- pray send <i>me</i> some.</p>

<p>Most lovingly, Yours</p>

<p>Forever -- [Mark] Samuel.</p>

<p>P.S. I do <i>love</i> you, Livy!</p>
