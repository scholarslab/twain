        Redding, April 20 -- In a statement given out tonight by
        Dr. Robert Halsey, the attending physician, Samuel L.
        Clemens, who is ill at his home, Stormfield, is weaker than
        he was when the afternoon bulletin was issued. Tonight's
        statement was as follows:

        <p>"Mr. Clemens is weaker tonight than he was at the last
        statement, but he is resting perfectly quietly."</p>

        <p>In the afternoon he was perceptibly weaker than
        twenty-four hours previous. As to his present condition Dr.
        Halsey said that Mr. Clemens has cardiac asthma with angina
        pectoris.</p>

        <p>According to information late tonight it seems evident
        that Mr. Clemens is slowly but surely approaching the end.
        The physicians and family do not anticipate any change for
        the worse during the night.</p>

        <p>Dr. Edward Quintard of New York came to Stormfield late
        today and after spending some time with Mr. Clemens
        returned. He would make no statement regarding the
        condition of the patient.</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens has an occasional difficulty with his
        breathing, accompanied by severe pain, but between these
        spells he sleeps considerably and rests well.</p>

        <p>It has been learned within a day or two at Redding that
        through his personal check Mr. Clemens has made a gift of
        $6,000 to the Redding Public Library. This library is one
        of Mr. Clemens' pet schemes. It was founded by him a little
        over a year ago and is located at the present time in an
        old schoolhouse not far from his home. He gave a number of
        books and a few of his author friends made gifts to the
        library. He handed his check, personally, to Albert Bigelow
        Paine, one of the Redding literary colony, who is one of
        the trustees of the library. Harry Lounsbury and William E.
        Hazen are the other trustees.</p>
