  <b>From the <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i><br />
  22 April 1910<br />

  <p>[<i>Instead of an editorial, the paper reprinted this poem,
  which seems to have been written by Clark McAdams, who edited the
  column "Just a Minute," although that isn't explicitly
  established by the layout of the feature. It isn't a very good
  poem, but it's worth reading. Of all the accounts of where the
  name "Mark Twain" came from, this is the only one I know that
  acknowledges that the leadsmen who sang out "Mark Twain" on the
  Mississippi when Clemens was a pilot would all have been African
  American.</i>]</p>

  <blockquote>
    "M<font size="-1">ARK TWAIN</font>!" What a monument -- better
    than granite!<br />
    Better than marble, though master should plan it.<br />
    Simply "Mark Twain!" for a life of endeavor,<br />
    Sung on the old Mississippi forever!

  <blockquote>
    His and no other's -- and how everlasting!<br />
    Think of the darky his sounding line casting<br />
    Out from the bow till the heavens shall totter,<br />
    Singing "Mark Twain!" for his twelve feet of water.

  <blockquote>
    Years in their trooping and nights in their glory<br />
    Guarding forever that beautiful story --<br />
    Silvery bells, and the darkies the while at<br />
    Singing their water-marks up to the pilot.

  <blockquote>
    Sung when the humorist long has departed --<br />
    When the new channels for old ones are charted --<br />
    While the great river sings soft as a child could,<br />
    And the sweet echo resounds in the wildwood.

  <blockquote>
    Sung when the hoot-owl calls out of the bottom --<br />
    When the night air has the crispness of Autumn --<br />
    When are new captains in old places whereon<br />
    Stood the old boatman gone boating with Charon.

  <blockquote>
    Sung while the river by blest hills is flowing --<br />
    Out where the whistles are moltenly blowing --<br />
    Out where the paddles are hollowly pounding,<br />
    And the black stevedore sings at his sounding.
