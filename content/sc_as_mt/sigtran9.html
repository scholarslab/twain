<p>Bermuda, Mch 6/10.</p>

<p>Clara dear, Yours of Feb. 16 is just received.</p>
<p>Am I well?  Yes--plenty well enough.  I have had bronchitis for 2 or 3 weeks, with the proper cough, but it kept me in bed only about 3 days, instead of the customary 5 weeks.  Therefore it has not been an inconvenience.  I go &amp; come as I please, &amp; bark hardly any.</p>

<p>Concerning your suggestions to Paine about reducing the live stock &amp; saving expense, I am writing him to stick to his own plans in that matter, as lately laid before me.  He has probably laid the same before you by this time.</p>

<p>You see, I don't feel so cramped now, as I've been feeling for some years past.  Paine's February report it in, &amp; it changes the complexion of things.  He has suddenly reduced monthly expenses to less than a third of what they have been for the past 5 years.  He thinks he can run Stormfield for $10,000 a year, even when <u>we</u> are there.</p>

<p>I did not take any notice of K[?]aithwaite's letter, &amp; stopped Paine from doing it.</p>

<p>You say "I wasn't so far off in my guess about Miss Lyon, was I?"</p>

<p>Do you mean a <u>recent</u> guess?  In your guess of a year ago you were unquestionably &amp; unqualifiedly right, the severalties of that guess being that she was a liar, a forger, a thief, a hypocrite, a drunkard, a sneak, a humbug, a traitor, a conspirator, a filthy-minded &amp; salacious slut pining for seduction &amp; always getting disappointed, poor child.</p>

<p>Oh, by George I <u>am</u> glad to know of the success of Miss Jones's book, &amp; proud to remember that it was your plucky &amp; persistent fight for her &amp; her rights that secured the book's birth when otherwise it would have perished in the womb.  Yes indeed I am glad for Miss Jones, &amp; very very proud &amp; fond of her sweet champion my Clara.</p>

<p>Marcus.</p>
