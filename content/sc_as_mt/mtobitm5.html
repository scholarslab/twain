    <font size="+1">MARK TWAIN</font>
  </center>

  <p>The tributes called forth by Mark Twain's death show him to
  have been regarded not only as an American of the Americans, but
  as one of the foremost citizens of the world. "With the exception
  of Tolstoy," says <i>The Morning Leader</i> (London), "probably
  there is no writer whose death would rouse more universal
  emotions of respect and regret." Mr. Hamlin Garland is reported
  through the press as saying that he was "as distinctly American
  as Walt Whitman." "The work of most writers could be produced in
  any country," he adds, "but I think we, as well as everybody in
  foreign lands, will look upon Twain's work as being as closely
  related to this county as the Mississippi River itself."</p>

  <p>Indeed, the Mississippi seems somehow to symbolize him and he
  it. A dispatch from Paris voices one of the most poignant
  expressions of personal loss among the many that now fill the
  papers. Mr. C. B. M. Farthing, friend and schoolmate of Mark
  Twain, and the original Huckleberry Finn, said when told of his
  loss:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "The old days are passing. The men who made them are gone, and
    even the long sweep of the majestic yellow river seems to have
    dwindled and lessened. The noise of its traffic, the music of
    its many deep-throated voices are practically no more. The man
    who caught them and froze them into human words for the delight
    of the world is dead."
  </blockquote>

  <p>One of those upon whom the mantle of humor which we call
  "American" has fallen, George Ade says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "I read every line Twain wrote, for he was a kind of literary
    god to me. His influence has already worked itself into the
    literature of our day. We owe much of our cheerfulness,
    simplicity, and hope to him. Most of all, Twain grew old
    beautifully, showing his simple, childlike faith for ultimate
    success throughout all his adversities."
  </blockquote>

  <p>Among the tributes of personal affection that of President
  Woodrow Wilson, of Princeton, is especially appealing:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "All the world knows that in Mark Twain it has lost a
    delightful humorist, a man able to interpret human life with a
    flavor all his own; but only those who had the privilege of
    knowing him personally can feel the loss to the full-the loss
    of a man of high and lovely character, a friend quick to excite
    and give affection; a citizen of the world, who loved every
    wholesome adventure of the mind or heart; an American who spoke
    much of the spirit of America in speaking his native thoughts."
  </blockquote>

  <p>"He was one of the most ethical of humorist," says <i>The
  Daily News</i> (London), to which <i>The Daily Chronicle</i>
  (London) adds: "His aspect of things is in reality serious and
  his judgment often peculiarly wise." It is further noted that he
  had "the ironic gift of puzzling people and leaving them divided
  between seriousness and laughter." <i>The Daily Express</i>
  (London) thinks "Huckleberry Finn" his best work.</p>

  <p>Samuel Langhorne Clemens was born November 30, 1835, in the
  little town of Florida, Monroe County, Mo. His father was
  accounted a man of "education and social importance" in the
  frontier town of that early day. Three years after the son's
  birth the family moved to Hannibal on the Mississippi, where
  Samuel at twelve years of age first touched printer's ink. His
  young life was somewhat adventurous, as the obituary in the New
  York <i>Sun</i> recounts:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "He determined that if he must be a printer he would be a tramp
    printer, and before he was sixteen he had worked in the
    composing-rooms of newspapers in St. Louis, Cincinnati,
    Philadelphia, and New York. The river called him back. In 1851
    he returned to Hannibal determined to become a pilot, or as it
    was called, 'to learn the river.' This was not an inexpensive
    matter. Master pilots demanded $500 to take a cadet and
    thoroughly instruct him in the business. Young Clemens could
    not then pay any premium, but he worked for several years with
    the sole end in view, making money as a printer at times, at
    times working as a clerk on river-boats. In 1857 he was able to
    satisfy a master pilot of his ability to pay the $500 fee, and
    two years later he had a pilot's license, his first boat being
    the <i>Alonso Child</i> under Captain De Haven.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    "In 1862 he enlisted in the Confederate Army of Gen. Sterling
    Price, but after a few months he returned to St. Louis to join
    his brother Orrin, who had been appointed Secretary of the
    Territory of Nevada as his clerk to Carson City.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    "Up in Esmeralda County, Nev., near the present Goldfield
    mines, in a camp called Aurora, men were finding rich gold
    quartz in surface outcroppings, and the excitement of this
    'rush' drew Clemens from his desk in Carson City. The romance
    of a new mining-camp near the very peak of the Sierra Nevada
    addrest the sympathies of the young adventurer more than the
    hard work of prospecting for pay rock.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    "He made no discoveries of importance in mining, but he made
    many acquaintances with stage-drivers, gamblers, and 'bad' men,
    all of whom appear in 'Roughing It.'"
  </blockquote>

  <p>After a year of mining-camp life he returned to newspaper work
  on the staff of <i>The Enterprise</i> in Virginia City, Nev. It
  was here that some of his broadly humorous articles appeared over
  the signature "Mark Twain," and were copied widely by papers of
  the Pacific Coast. Then:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "The San Francisco <i>Call</i> made an offer to the writer of
    the Mark Twain stories, and Clemens in 1865 went on <i>The
    Call</i> staff, but he remained there only six months, for the
    mining-camp called again. In Calaveras County, Cal., he found
    little gold dust, but he did find material for stories which
    gave him his first fame east of the Rockies, the stories in the
    book 'The Jumping Frog of Calaveras County.'
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    "In 1866 Clemens went to the Sandwich Islands and wrote from
    there some sketches for the Sacramento <i>Union</i>, which
    sketches were the basis for his first lectures delivered in San
    Francisco after his return from Honolulu.
  </blockquote>

  <p>In the following year the stories of the 'Jumping Frog' book
  were published, and Mark Twain became known in the Eastern States
  as a writer of exaggerated humor. It was the reputation these
  stories gained for him that prompted some newspapers editors to
  select Mr. Clemens to go with a party of tourists on a journey
  abroad and write for his employers what would now be called a
  'syndicate' letter. This trip resulted (1869) in the publication
  of 'Innocents Abroad,' an extended revision of the letters, and
  with the instant success of that book the writer became famous in
  this country and most of the countries of Europe.</p>

  <blockquote>
    "In spite of the very profitable sales of the book, which would
    have warranted the author in devoting all his time to
    book-writing, he soon after his return from that now famous
    trip became editor of the Buffalo <i>Express</i>. This was
    probably in pursuance of a contract entered into before the
    trip to Europe. He remained in Buffalo only two years, marrying
    there Miss Olivia Langdon, whose acquaintance he had made on
    the ocean voyage.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    "Mr. Clemens went to Hartford to live, and at once began work
    the material he had gathered while he was not gathering other
    pay ore in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and out of that
    material came the book 'Roughing It.' This fixt his reputation
    as a story-teller and humorist, and his work was urgently
    demanded by editors on both sides of the ocean. Contributing
    frequently to magazines, he wrote also in the following year,
    collaborating with Charles Dudley Warner, 'The Gilded Age,'
    which was soon successfully dramatized.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    "Next came from his pen what many Americans and nearly all
    English critics consider his best work of fiction, 'The
    Adventures of Tom Sawyer.' (1876).
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    "After writing several other books Mr. Clemens in 1884 invested
    largely in the publishing enterprise of the Charles L. Webster
    Company, which had contracted to pay Mrs. Grant $500,000 for
    the copyright of General Grant's autobiography. Ten years later
    the failure of this firm left Mr. Clemens in debt far beyond
    his resources.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    "It was believed by his friends and advisers that a
    round-the-world lecture tour would help to recoup Mr. Clemens,
    and the tour was undertaken. Its success was vastly beyond the
    most hopeful expectations; the author was received everywhere
    with high social and sometimes with civic honors; his lectures
    were everywhere attended by delighted crowds and frequently
    delivered under the 'patronage' of the most distinguished
    people. The profits of the tour enabled Mr. Clemens to pay
    every cent he owed and left him a considerable balance."
  </blockquote>

  Arthur," 1889; "The American Claimant," 1892; "The
  &oelig;1,000,000 Bank Note," 1893; "Pudd'nhead Wilson," 1894;
  "Tom Sawyer Abroad," 1894; "Joan of Arc," 1896; "More Tramps
