        <p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 7--Mark Twain spent a busy afternoon at
        the Capitol today, and for half an hour entertained the
        newspaper correspondents with a characteristic talk.
        Despite the blustering wind which swept down Pennsylvania
        Avenue, the author wore a suit of white flannels. In the
        members' gallery, which he first visited to watch the
        proceedings of the House, he attracted general
        attention.</p>

        <p>Later Mr. Clemens visited the Speaker's room, and, while
        awaiting the arrival of "Uncle Joe," entertained a dozen
        Congressmen, including Grosvenor, Payne, Dalzell, and
        Foster, who hastened to pay him their respects. With the
        Speaker Mr. Clemens discussed briefly the pending Copyright
        bill. With William Dean Howells and a party of other
        authors and publishers, Mr. Clemens came here to be present
        at the hearings on this bill, which are now being conducted
        in the Senate reading room at the Congressional Library by
        the Committee on Patents of the Senate and the House.</p>

        <p>With Mr. Howells, Edward Everett Hale, Thomas Nelson
        Page, and a number of other authors, he appeared before the
        committee this afternoon. The new Copyright bill extends
        the authors' copyright for the term of his life and for
        fifty years thereafter. It is also for the benefit of
        artists, musicians, and others, but the authors did most of
        the talking. F.D. Millet made a speech for the artists, and
        John Philip Sousa for the musicians.</p>

        </center>

        <p>Mr. Clemens was the last speaker of the day, and its
        chief feature. He made a speech the serious parts of which
        created a strong impression, and the humorous parts set the
        Senators and Representatives in roars of laughter.</p>

        <p>"I am interested particularly and especially in the part
        of the bill which concerns my trade. I like the extension
        of copyright life to the author's life and fifty years
        afterward. I think that would satisfy any reasonable
        author, because it would take care of his children. Let the
        grandchildren take care of themselves. That would take care
        of my daughters, and after that I am not particular. I
        shall then have long been out of this struggle, independent
        of it, indifferent to it.". . .</p>

          <b>An Advocate of Dress Reform</b>
        </center>

        <p>While waiting to appear before the committee Mr. Clemens
        talked to the reporters.</p>

        <p>"Why don't you ask why I am wearing such apparently
        unseasonable cloths? I'll tell you. I have found that when
        a man reaches the advanced age of 71 years as I have, the
        continual sight of dark clothing is likely to have a
        depressing effect upon him. Light-colored clothing is more
        pleasing to the eye and enlivens the spirit. Now, of
        course, I cannot compel every one to wear such clothing
        just for my especial benefit, so I do the next best thing
        and wear it myself.</p>

        <p>"Of course, before a man reaches my years, the fear of
        criticism might prevent him from indulging his fancy. I am
        not afraid of that. I am decidedly for pleasing color
        combinations in dress. I like to see the women's clothes,
        say, at the opera. What can be more depressing than the
        sombre black which custom requires men to wear upon state
        occasions. A group of men in evening clothes looks like a
        flock of crows, and is just about as inspiring.</p>

        <p>"After all, what is the purpose of clothing? Are not
        clothes intended primarily to preserve dignity and also to
        afford comfort to their wearer? Now I know of nothing more
        uncomfortable than the present day clothes of men. The
        finest clothing made is a person's own skin, but, of
        course, society demands something more than this.</p>

        <p>"The best-dressed man I have ever seen, however, was a
        native of the Sandwich Islands, who attracted my attention
        thirty years ago. Now, when that man wanted to don especial
        dress to honor a public occasion or a holiday, why he
        occasionally put on a pair of spectacles. Otherwise the
        clothing with which God had provided him sufficed.</p>

        <p>"Of course, I have ideas of dress reform. For one thing,
        why not adopt some of the women's styles? Goodness knows,
        they adopt enough of ours. Take the peek-a-boo waist, for
        instance. It has the obvious advantages of being cool and
        comfortable, and in addition it is almost always made up in
        pleasing colors, which cheer and do not depress.</p>

        <p>"It is true that I dressed the Connecticut Yankee at
        King Arthur's Court in a plug hat, but let's see, that was
        twenty-five years ago. Then no man was considered fully
        dressed until he donned a plug hat. Nowadays I think that
        no man is dressed until he leaves it home. Why, when I left
        home yesterday they trotted out a plug hat for me to
        wear.</p>

        <p>" 'You must wear it,' they told me: 'why, just think of
        going to Washington without a plug hat!' But I said no; I
        would wear a derby or nothing. Why, I believe I could walk
        along the streets of New York--I never do--but still I
        think I could--and I should never see a well-dressed man
        wearing a plug hat. If I did I should suspect him of
        something. I don't know just what, but I would suspect
        him.</p>

        <p>"Why, when I got up on the second story of that
        Pennsylvania ferryboat coming down here yesterday, I saw
        Howells coming along. He was the only man on the boat with
        a plug hat, and I tell you he felt ashamed of himself. He
        said he had been persuaded to wear it against his better
        sense, but just think of a man nearly 70 years old who has
        not a mind of his own on such matters!"</p>
