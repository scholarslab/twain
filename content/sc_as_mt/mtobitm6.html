  <p>It is well within the literal truth to say that no American
  writer of our day has given so large a number of people so great
  an amount of innocent entertainment as Samuel Langhorne Clemens.
  This is obviously a matter quite apart from the question of the
  fineness of literary quality in his work. On that point critical
  opinions differ; there are those who consider that Mr. Clemens
  "Joan of Arc" may claim high place among seriously imaginative
  works of literature, and that in other writings he showed at
  times far more than the talent of the whimsical humorist.
  Certainly in those delightful boys, Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry
  Finn, and in such tales as "The Prince and the Pauper," he did
  leave in his reader's memory-gallery distinct and individual
  character creations. It is really a tribute to his variety of
  interest that readers of many degrees of culture and taste are
  champions of half a dozen different specimens of his art as
  entitled to be called favorite and best: one, for instance,
  thinks the "Jumping Frog" inimitable; another deems it immensely
  overrated and prefers the keen irony of "A Connecticut Yankee at
  King Arthur's Court"; others select as deliciously humorous
  certain sketches of Mark Twain's experiences abroad or even bits
  of his longer books like "Roughing It" and "The Gilded Age";
  while almost all enjoy "Tom Sawyer" and "Huckleberry Finn"
  because, as one critic has said, "the author has here surpassed
  in that he has vividly portrayed the American boy" and given his
  readers "an adequate impression of the large, homely, spontaneous
  life led by native Americans in the great valley of the
  Mississippi."</p>

  <p>Mr. Clemens was half way through his seventy-fifth year when
  he died at "Stormfield," on Thursday of last week. His early life
  in Missouri, his rambling experiences in mining, steamboat
  piloting, and newspaper work, his first book-success with
  "Innocents Abroad," the long list of romances, stories, and
  sketches that followed, together with later eventful incidents,
  notable among which was the bestowal of his doctor's degree at
  Oxford three years ago--all this is familiar to most Americans,
  and much of the story has been told discursively and oddly in
  Mark Twain's own purposely inconsecutive autobiographical papers.
  One of many tributes to his memory from fellow writers may be
  quoted-that of James Whitcomb Riley: "The world has lost not only
  a genius, but a man of striking character, of influence, and of
  boundless resources. He knew the human heart, and he was sincere.
  He knew children, and this knowledge made him tender."</p>

  <p>In personal friendships and family life Mr. Clemens was
  peculiarly fortunate. He was in certain ways also a national
  figure. Repeatedly his force and wit were used to strengthen
  public causes and to encourage right doing and right thinking. No
  advocacy of public nature, however, could have more lasting power
  than the private example he gave of scrupulous honor. He
  voluntarily bore for years the burden of financial liability
  incurred in his name through the publishing business in which he
  had been unwise enough to become a partner. Refusing to accept
  the legal benefits of bankruptcy, he set to work, like Walter
  Scott, to pay his debtors by his pen; and that he not only
  succeeded but re-established his own fortunes, was a general
  cause for felicitation and rejoicing.</p>

  <p>Mark Twain's humor had not only the element of exaggeration
  which is said to be more especially characteristic of American
  writers of this class; it had also drollery and unexpected turns,
  as unlike Artemus Ward on the one had as they were distant from
  Thackeray on the other. In common with most other professed
  humorists, his flint did not always strike fire; there were
  undoubtedly commonplace and even tedious passages; he did not
  often deal successfully with plot, and sometime he mistook the
  melodramatic for the dramatic. But his best was so very good that
  his popularity has become fixed and general, and there is no
  doubt that he will continue to be read both here and abroad for
  many years to come.</p>

  <p>That Mark Twain more often then not had serious purpose in his
  writing could easily be shown; sometimes that purpose was to hold
  up to contempt despicable or sordid actions or traits of
  character; sometimes that purpose wit was to teach affirmatively
  and aggressively principles of fairness, truth, kindness, and
  generosity. Mark Twain's influence never tended toward meanness,
  snobbery, ostentation. More also than most writers with a popular
  following, he established in his books and sketches a feeling of
  personal friendliness, almost intimacy, with men of all sorts;
  his works are on the shelf of professor and mechanic. The fact
  that thousands with whom "Mark Twin" is a household word, as the
  name not only of a writer but of an individual, might have to
  think twice before recalling the name Samuel L. Clemens is
  perhaps unique in the history of pseudonyms, and has a
  significance of its own.</p>
