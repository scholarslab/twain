        R<font size="-1">EDDING</font> (Ct.) April 21. -- Samuel
        Langhorne Clemens (Mark Twain) died painlessly at 6:30
        tonight of angina pectoris. He lapsed into coma at 3
        o'clock this afternoon and never recovered consciousness.

        <p>It was the end of a man outworn by grief and acute agony
        of body. He was 74 years old. The breakdown which brought
        on the end is attributed to disheartenment following the
        death of his invalid daughter Jean. The death of his
        friends H. H. Rogers, W. M. Laffan, and R. W. Gilder, also
        affected him.</p>

        <p>Yesterday was a bad day for the little knot of anxious
        watchers at the bedside. For long hours the gray, aquiline
        features lay moulded in the inertia of death, while the
        pulse sunk steadily, but at night he passed from stupor
        into the first natural sleep he had known since he returned
        from Bermuda, and then he woke refreshed, even faintly
        cheerful, and in full possession of his faculties.</p>

        <p>He recognized his daughter, Clara (Mrs. Ossip
        Gabrilowitsch,) spoke a rational word or two, and feeling
        himself unequal to conversation, wrote out in pencil:</p>

        <center>
          "Give me my glasses."
        </center>

        <p>These were his last words. Laying them aside, he sank
        first into reverie and later into final
        unconsciousness.</p>

        <p>There was no thought at the time, however, that the end
        was so near. At 5 o'clock Dr. Robert Halsey, who had been
        continuously in attendance, said:</p>

        <p>"Mr. Clemens is not so strong at this hour as he was at
        the corresponding hour yesterday, but he has wonderful
        vitality and he may rally again."</p>

        <p>Albert Bigelow Paine, Mark Twain's biographer and
        literary executor, said to a caller who had desired to
        inquire for Mr. Clemens: "I do not think you will have to
        call often again."</p>

        <p>Nevertheless Mr. and Mrs. E. E. Loomis, who had come up
        from New York to give their love in person, left
        "Stormfield" without seeing Mr. Clemens and only heard of
        his death as they were taking the train to New York again.
        Mrs. Loomis was Clemens' favorite niece. Mr. Loomis is vice
        president of the Lackawanna Railroad.</p>

        <p>Similarly, Jarvis Langdon, a nephew, who had run up for
        the day, left even earlier and wholly uninformed.</p>

        <p>At the deathbed were only Mrs. Gabrilowitsch and her
        husband, Dr. Robert Halsey, Dr. Quintard, Albert Bigelow
        Paine, who will write Mark Twain's biography and is his
        literary executor, and the two trained nurses. Restoratives
        -- digitalis, strychnine, and camphor -- were administered,
        but the patient failed to respond.</p>

        <p>A tank of oxygen still stands uncalled for at Redding
        station. Oxygen was tried yesterday, and the physicians
        explained that it was of no value, because the valvular
        action of the heart was not disordered. The was only an
        extreme and increasing debility, accompanied by labored
        respiration.</p>

        <p>Angina pectoris is a paroxysmal affection of the chest,
        of baffling and obscure origin, characterized by severe
        pain, faintness, and deep depression of the spirits. The
        pain is severe, and of an oppressive, crushing, or stabbing
        character. The attacks progress in frequency and severity
        with uncertain intermissions, sometimes of long duration,
        to a fatal termination.</p>

        <p>Mark Twain did not die in anguish. Sedatives soothed his
        pain, but in his moments of consciousness the mental
        depression persisted. On the way up from Bermuda he said to
        Albert Bigelow Paine, who had been his constant companion
        in illness:</p>

        <p>"This is a bad job; we'll never pull through with
        it."</p>

        <p>On shore once more, and longing for the serenity of the
        New England hills, he took heart, and said to those who
        sorrowfully noted his enfeeblement:</p>

        <p>"Give me a breath of Redding air once more and this will
        pass." But it did not pass, and, tired of body and weary of
        spirit, the old warrior against shams and snobs finally
        said faintly to his nurses:</p>

        <p>"Why do you fight to keep me alive? Two days of life are
        as good to me as four."</p>

        <p>It is certain to be recalled that Mark Twain was for
        more than fifty years an inveterate smoker, and the first
        conjecture of the layman would be that he had weakened his
        heart by overindulgence in tobacco.</p>

        <p>Dr. Halsey said tonight that he was unable to predicate
        that the angina pectoris from which Mark Twain died was in
        any way a sequel of nicotine poisoning. Some constitutions,
        he said, seem immune from the effects of tobacco. This was
        one of them. Yet it is true that since his illness began
        the doctors had cut down Mark Twain's daily allowance of
        twenty cigars and countless pipes to four cigars a day.</p>

        <p>No deprivation was a greater sorrow to him. He tried to
        smoke on the steamer while returning from Bermuda, and only
        gave it up because he was too feeble to draw on his pipe.
        Even on his deathbed, when he had passed the point of
        speech and it was no longer certain that his ideas were
        lucid, he would make the motion of waving a cigar, and,
        smiling, would expel empty air from under the mustache
        still stained with smoke.</p>

        <p>This city, where Mark Twain chose to spend his declining
        years, was the first outpost of Methodism in New England,
        and it was among the hills of Redding that General Putnam
        of Revolutionary fame mustered his sparse ranks. Putnam
        Park now encloses the memory of his camp.</p>

        <p>Mark Twain first heard of it at the dinner given him on
        his 70th birthday, when a fellow guest who lived there
        mentioned its beauties, and added that there was a vacant
        house adjoining his own.</p>

        <p>"I think I may buy that old house for me," said Mark
        Twain.</p>

        <p>"Sherwood Place" was the delectable name of that old
        house, and where it had stood Mark Twain reared the white
        walls of the Italian villa he first named "Innocence at
        Home," but a first experience of what a New England winter
        storm could be in its whitest fury, quickly caused him to
        christen it anew, "Stormfield."</p>

        <p>The house has been described thus by Albert Bigelow
        Paine:</p>

        <p>"Set on a fair hillside, with such a green slope below,
        such a view outspread across the valley as made one catch
        his breath a little when he first turned to look at it. A
        trout stream flows through one of the meadows. There are
        apple trees and gray stone walls. The entrance to that is a
        winding leafy lane."</p>

        <p>Through these leafy lanes the innocent at home loved to
        wander in his white flannels for homely gossip with his
        neighbors. They remember him best as one who loved above
        all things a good listener, for Mark Twain was a good
        talker, stored with fairy tales for the little maids he
        adored, and racier, ruder speech for more accustomed
        masculine ears. It is a legend that he was vastly proud of
        his famous mop of white hair and used to spend the pains of
        a court lady in getting it to just the proper stage of
        artistic disarray.</p>

        <p>Last summer the walks began to falter, last fall they
        ceased for good. The death of H. H. Rogers, a close friend,
        was a severe blow. The death of his daughter Jean, who was
        seized with an attack of epilepsy last fall while in her
        bath, was an added blow from which he never recovered. It
        was then that the stabbing pains in the heart began. Mark
        Twain died as truly as it can be said of any man of a
        broken heart.</p>

        <p>The last bit of literary work he did was a chapter of
        his unfinished autobiography describing his daughter Jean's
        death. He sought diversion in Bermuda, where he was the
        guest of the American vice consul, William H. Allen, whose
        young daughter, Helen, acted as amanuensis for what few
        letters he cared to dictate. His winter was gay, but not
        happy.</p>

        <p>When he heard of the successive deaths of his two
        friends, William M. Laffan of the Sun, and Richard Watson
        Gilder, editor of The Century, he said sadly:</p>

        <p>"How fortunate they are; no good fortune of that kind
        ever comes to me."</p>

        <p>Life had no further allurements for him. Mr. Paine said
        tonight that the book Mark Twain took up from the coverlet
        beside him when he asked for his glasses was Carlyle's
        "History of the French Revolution," his inseparable
        companion and greatest favorite.</p>

        <p>The burial will be in the family plot at Elmira, N.Y,
        where lie already his wife, his two daughters Susan and
        Jean, and his infant son Langhorne. No date has yet been
        set, as the family still is undecided whether or not there
        shall be a public funeral first in New York City.</p>

        <p>It is probable that "Stormfield" will be kept as a
        summer place by Mrs. Gabrilowitsch, who is fond both of the
        house and of the country, although her husband's musical
        engagements make it necessary for her to spend a part of
        each year abroad.</p>

        <p>Mr. Paine said tonight that Mark Twain had put his
        affairs in perfect order, and that he died well off, though
        by no means a rich man.</p>

        <p>He leaves a considerable number of unfinished
        manuscripts, in all stages of completion and of all
        characters, many of them begun years ago and put aside as
        unsatisfactory. Mrs. Gabrilowitsch shall aid Mr. Paine in
        the final decision as to what use shall be made of
        these.</p>

          <b>PRESIDENT PAYS TRIBUTE TO TWAIN.</b>
        </center>

        <p><font size="-1">WASHINGTON (D.C.)</font> April 21. --
        President Taft, who has expressed the keenest interest in
        the condition of Samuel L. Clemens, since the report of his
        serious illness, when informed of the death of Mr. Clemens
        tonight, wrote personally this statement:</p>

        <p>"Mark Twain gave pleasure -- real intellectual
        enjoyment -- to millions, and his works will continue to
        give such pleasure to millions yet to come. He never wrote
        a line that a father could not read to a daughter. His
        humor was American, but he was nearly as much appreciated
        by Englishmen and people of other countries as by his own
        countrymen. He has made an enduring part of American
        literature."</p>
