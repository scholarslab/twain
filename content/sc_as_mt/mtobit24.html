    At Ripe Old Age.</font>
  </center>

  <p>Redding, Conn., April 21 -- Samuel Clemens, known to the
  people generally as Mark Twain, died this evening after an
  illness of some weeks.<br /></p>
  <hr width="20%" />
  Mark Twain began his literary career on the Enterprise, where he
  was employed in the early sixties as a reporter and some of the
  improbable stories he then wrote afterwards made him famous.
  Before coming to the Comstock he resided for many years at the
  old mining camp of Aurora. He took first rank as a humorist and
  there is hardly a person in the civilized world who has not read
  some of his stories. Twain came to Nevada as private secretary to
  his brother, who had been appointed Secretary of Nevada
  Territory, and experienced the ups and downs of the early
  settlers. His story, "Roughing It," attracted great attention and
  the sales were great, which put Twain on Easy street and life
  with him had since been easy.
