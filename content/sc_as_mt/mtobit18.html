  </center>

  <p>Even in dying Samuel Langhorne Clemens bequeathed to the
  literature of the moment a touch of unconscious humor. Estimates
  of his career as a citizen and of his standing as an author were
  purveyed simultaneously with the announcement of his death. Most
  of those <i>critiques</i> -- that's how they spelt them -- were
  unanimous in the opening sentence, "Mark Twain is Dead," and were
  common in choosing as their final peroration, "Hail and
  Farewell." It was all very affecting and prompt and self-reliant.
  As an example of "red hot" writing it was inspiring, but as a
  contribution to literary criticism it was worthless.</p>

  <p>For it is not criticism, but the crucible of time, that must
  test the writings of Mark Twain and give them their place in
  permanent fame, while comparing him with the other makers of
  books, for men or boys, is a futile and unenlightening endeavor.
  He cannot be classed with Cervantes, or Stevenson, or LeSage, or
  Dickens, or any of the other numberless authors chosen for his
  compeers. His stories conform to none of the canons of fiction.
  His essays in biography were altogether lacking in any evidence
  of the historical sense. In his Joan of Arc there is a complete
  absence of comparative values. Eve's Diary is funny in spots and
  both dull and vulgar where it is not funny. His attack on
  Christian Science and Mrs. Eddy has already been mercifully
  forgotten. His polemic against the harmless travel book of M.
  Paul Bourget was in poor taste. And yet both the man in his own
  personality and in his earlier writings was essentially great; as
  typical and original in the democracy of literature as was
  Lincoln in the statesmanship of democracy.</p>

  <p>Both Lincoln and Mark Twain were the children of poor parents.
  Both were self-educated. They were both the intellectual products
  of a conception of humanity that had no respect for tradition and
  no patience with ritual. They both viewed life from a shrewd,
  individual standpoint, and they will both endure as much for
  their personality as their achievements.</p>

  <p>Had the Confederacy succeeded Lincoln would have lost none of
  his glory. Had Mark Twain written nothing but Huckleberry Finn,
  or Tom Sawyer, or Roughing It, he would have earned an abiding
  place in human affection and left a permanent record of one
  passing phase of American life. For Mark Twain, above all else,
  was a historian, and no history that has yet been written of his
  country contains such records of life and character as those
  books which made him so well beloved of the boyhood of the world.
  In England, in all the British colonies, in some of the countries
  of Europe, as well as in American, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn have
  enjoyed, and will continue to enjoy, a popularity equal to that
  of Tom Browne and Gil Blas and Robinson Crusoe; while Life on the
  Mississippi has an attraction for the soul of youthful adventure
  that runs parallel with the boys of Ballantyne and the hero of
  Treasure Island.</p>

  <p>Yet Mark Twain was no master of style, as were Stevenson, or
  Cervantes, or LeSage. His language had, in itself, no particular
  charm. You do not marvel at the mere wizardry of his words as you
  do at the delicate craftsmanship of <i>Catriona</i>. He gets his
  effects by obvious methods; he goes after his story in a
  downright fashion; his University was life at large; and, when
  thousands of his contemporaries were getting whipped into shape
  in the class room and on the campus, Mark Twain was taking a
  post-graduate course on the river boats of the Mississippi. And,
  had he gone to Yale or Harvard he would have been lost to
  literature.</p>

  <p>For, the higher education is essentially aristocratic. Culture
  is an anesthetic to the broader sense of humor. Academic thought
  smiles, but never laughs. Mark Twain as a Bachelor of Arts of
  Harvard would have made an excellent banker, or a first rate
  Managing Editor; but the life that he sucked in with every breath
  during his crude and youthful days would have gone unnoticed, and
  that Iliad of the West of which he was the Homer would have
  passed away unsung. For Mark Twain proved in his later years that
  he was an excellent business man. He died wealthy. Wealthier than
  Stevenson, or Dickens, or Thackeray, or any of our own American
  authors. And he succeeded in leaving that wealth in spite of many
  financial reverses, and many intimate family sorrows that would
  have denuded men with the "artistic temperament" of whatever
  "money sense" they might have started with.</p>

  <p>Also, it is noticeable, that his genius did not strengthen,
  but decreased, as his affluence increased and contact with the
  sophisticated world made his thoughts and observations more
  conventional. The quality of his literary product fell off just
  as it fell off Kipling when prosperity came to scorch his
  inspiration. "Roughing It" was written forty years ago. "Tom
  Sawyer" was published thirty-five years ago. "Huckleberry Finn"
  was published twenty-four years ago. Thereafter came books, many
  books, but the freshness that made the earlier stories so
  delightful was absent; the certainty of a large income had
  sterilized his imagination. Mark Twain was Mark Twain still; a
  loveable companion; a humorous commentator on men and things; one
  of the conspicuous figures of the world; but he was "written
  out," and his fame must rest on the work that he did whilst the
  glamor of the old West still possessed his soul and he must needs
  write and he wished to live.</p>

  <p>As a literary craftsman, then, and not as a financially
  successful author, we must go back thirty years for the fountain
  of Mark Twain's immortality, and it is rich enough in its flow to
  keep his memory green as long as boys are boys. For Mark Twain
  was essentially a boys' writer. When he wrote for men, as he did
  in his later work, he became dull, didactical, polemical; his
  humor smelt of the lamp. But when he wrote for boys, or for the
  boy that is in some men to the last -- for which they may thank
  Heaven -- he lined his gallery with characters that stand the
  peers of Tartarin and Jourdan, and Sancho Panza, and Tam
  O'Shanter, and Don Quixote, and Sam Weller. But to compare him
  with the creators of those other inventions of literary genius is
  gauche and unnecessary; a dull and unilluminating exercise.
  Indeed, no comparison could be more odious. For, Mark Twain in
  literature was a law unto himself. He made his own canons of art.
  Ignoring the methods of the schools, he worked in the clay of
  life with the firm, strong hands of a journeyman delving in
  immediate things, and what he moulded in those leaner years will
  shine firm and clear when his later efforts are forgotten.</p>
