    <font size="+1">MARK TWAIN.</font>
  </center>

  <p>A Gentle Man, if that abused title may have any significance
  restored to it, was Mark Twain. Good and ill fortune made trial
  of his finely tempered spirit, and success could not spoil nor
  adversity embitter him. His humor might play like summer
  lightning over the range of human weakness, but his compassion
  was warm and universal as the rain. America has lost as much in
  the man as in the writer.</p>

  <p>His pen knew neither fear nor reverence, yet he dipped it
  tenderly in the heart of childhood. He asked for no exceptions
  from human hardship, and he gave out in the last year of his
  life, when a great sorrow came to him, a glow as of a spirit
  about to be released.</p>

  <p>To call Mark Twain a humorist merely would be to describe
  Shakespeare as a strolling player. More than one generation has
  drunk at the well-head of his tonic and sane philosophy.</p>

  <p>A letter written a few weeks before his death showed him
  notwithstanding his courage to have felt that darkness was
  closing in. He wrote from Bermuda: "There is not another orphan
  who is so wrecked, so ruined, so forsaken, as I am. Just a
  battered old derelict washing about the wastes of the great seas,
  with nobody on the bridge."</p>

  <p>America is poorer, in Mr. Clemen's death, by the loss of great
  and gracious personality: there is a void, not to be filled, in
  the hearts of those whom he surrounded with his friendship: but
  who shall say he has not earned that honorable and anxiously
  awaited resting-place beside Jean and Susie and their mother? He
  has left to those he loved a stainless memory and to this nation
  a lasting heritage of smiles and tears.</p>

    <h3>Mark Twain: An American Pioneer in Man's Oldest Art,<br />
    Whose Death Is Mourned by the World at Large</h3>
  </center>Happy among creative artists is the humorist. He strikes
  as deep into life as his neglected brothers who deal in pain and
  tragedy. But he alone carries the people with him. He has their
  good will, while he interprets their life to them. And only at
  his death is there sadness because of him. The more he made them
  merry, the richer the grief. And there are few peoples to-day on
  the earth where there is no sense of loss because MARK TWAIN
  died. He would have been seventy-five years old in November, and
  in the final months had suffered much pain.

  <p>Printer's devil and Mississippi pilot, cub reporter, pioneer,
  miner, and tramp royal, he knew life, and got the rough stuff out
  of which to spin his cloth of gold from reality itself. He had
  lived the life from nocessity, and then wrote it out.</p>

  <p>His sense of the vast innate humor of things was beaten into
  the fiber of him by the Nevada years, when he was territorial
  secretary in the State of Nevada. Those were great days. It was a
  life that couldn't stand the swiftest theatrical show for ten
  minutes running, but in its panting restlessness clamored for
  poker and drink and dancing and barbaric music. Partly a
  glorified picnic, full of easy nuggets and dramatic high lights,
  and then again tragic and bitter, where sweat and blood dropped
  free.</p>

  <p>A Western man has said of him: "A good many people think MARK
  TWAIN is a natural-born humorist. He isn't. He simply described
  the things he saw in Nevada and got the habit."</p>

  <p>The tumult of that life never forsook him. It passed into the
  color and startling suddenness of his prose. A land that was
  unexpected and vast, and men who were irreverent, ironic,
  fearless and sincere, what was left to do but hive the honey from
  those unreaped fields?</p>

  <p>In the teeth of the schools, he broke away from the gentle
  reminiscent New England tradition, and struck out a trail as new
  and sure as that of ABRAHAM LINCOLN in statecraft. He was an
  American in every line of his mirthful copy, and it was a
  generation before the critics caught up and knew it for
  literature, and ANDREW LANG called it Homeric.</p>

  <p>Leaping into the public eye with the overburdened life of the
  Calaveras frog who couldn't jump because of his meal of buckshot,
  he hit his public yet harder with "Innocents Abroad," which
  showed the ignorant and unashamed American tourist thrust upon
  the shrines of Europe, who forthwith dramatizes his own
  innocence, and is unaware of COLUMBUS, but weeps at the grave of
  ADAM. He finds the old masters a clutter of paint, and refuses to
  be moved by the cant of embryo Cookists. He turns a fresh,
  untroubled face on Europe, and asks that it make its own
  impression sincerely and first-hand.</p>

  <p>That manhandling of the holy places and hoar traditions was
  the key to MARK TWAIN, who faced life itself in the same naked
  way. Background, and atmosphere and the accumulations of
  convention were nonexistent for him, who asked them only to give
  up their reality and what of vital spark they still possessed for
  him. This trait of the unabashed accounted for some of his more
  doubtful ventures, as when he entered the lists of the
  Shakespeare controversy.</p>

  <p>The books which will safeguard his fame longer than a library
  of solemn and academic tomes are "Tom Sawyer" and its greater
  sequel "Huckleberry Finn," wherein the boy in literature is first
  discovered and celebrated. All the Boytowns and Bad Boys since
  owe a goodly debt to the clean sweep of those adventures, where
  boys whitewash fences, run away from home, and exhibit their
  naked souls in a leaping narrative, brimmed with undying
  laughter, and poignant with such touches of pathos as the
  unsuspected deafness of poor black Jim's little girl. The humor
  of those early books persists through many languages, and is
  little time-worn by forty years.</p>

  <p>To see things with fresh eyes, and find nothing sacred simply
  because other men had removed their shoes--it was in this spirit
  that he invaded the medieval realm, and plucked the comic out of
  the forest rides of knights and ladies and the renowned jousts.
  He called it "A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur." He had
  already written "The Prince and the Pauper" to show that
  tenderness and reverence could be accorded.</p>

  <p>In his "Joan of Arc" he dealt tenderly with the lovely lady in
  proof that he knew how to kneel as well as strike.</p>

  <p>He made a few swift sorties into literary criticism in the
  same masculine, forthright way--notably in his bitter attack on
  SHELLEY for the treatment of the poor drowned HARRIET, and in the
  paper on COOPER, whom he pilloried for committing the 57
  varieties of literary sin in plot construction and style.</p>

  <p>He did not flinch from facing the popular good will, which was
  so largely his, and attacked the national policy of imperialism
  in his eloquent "To Them That Sit in Darkness," and the acrid
  drive at General FUNSTON. FUNSTON thought of replying, and the
  author in the pride of conscious power, advised him to beware or
  he would hand him out some "man-talk."</p>

  <p>He was free of prejudices, and wrote a fine, strong article on
  the Jews, where the unfailing sympathy of it included some
  earnest criticism.</p>

  <p>The external facts are few after the early hard years which
  grounded him in reality. The books sold like "The Pilgrim's
  Progress." His lectures were always thronged.</p>

  <p>In old age he met a sudden financial loss to himself--and to
  those who had invested with him in a publishing house of his
  founding--by a recurrence of energy on the lecture platform,
  which cleared every cent of the indebtedness. He exactly repeated
  the intrepid and honorable feat of WALTER SCOTT, which had
  enriched literary history for a hundred years.</p>

  <p>In his later years he was moved by the pathos of life--the
  ceaseless striving game. His manner was affectionate and playful,
  and the impression of him on the spirit was tender and pathetic.
  He was simple and offhand, never forcing the note. His
  conversation was made up of short, easy words, never aiming at
  wit or cleverness. Sometimes, too, there was music on his lips,
  as when, on his birthday celebration, he spoke of Pier 70, and
  the laughter and songs of the young men in the streets at
  midnight, no more to be heard.</p>

  <p>With the fearless poise of the head of white hair, he would be
  watched by a theater audience more closely than the star actor on
  the stage. Ten thousand men rose to their feet when he entered
  the open-air auditorium at the Yale bicentennial.</p>
