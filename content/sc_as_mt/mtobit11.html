  <p>Alas, we can no longer smile at Mark Twain's celebrated jest
  that the reports of his death were "greatly exaggerated." The
  laugh which for years has rippled around the world has vanished,
  and on the coffin of Samuel Langhorne Clemens the nations of
  earth drop the tribute of their tears.</p>

  <p>But it is not a mere farceur who lies dead today. He was,
  indeed, a fellow of infinite jest and peculiar fancy; he was far
  more than that, however. He could engulf the whole world in a
  tidal wave of mirth with "The Jumping Frog" or "Innocents
  Abroad," but he could also move it to tears with the pathos of
  "The Prince and the Pauper," sting it with the irony of "The Man
  Who Corrupted Hadleyburg," or freeze its blood with horror at the
  recitals of what Leopold did in the Congo. It is true that there
  are coarse pages in "Roughing It," but where is there a more
  lifelike transcript from nature than "Tom Sawyer" or "Huckleberry
  Finn"? So if the cap and bells lie on his bier today there are
  plenty of tributes to his other qualities to cover them from
  sight.</p>

  <p>Yet it was as a humorist that he made his reputation and place
  in American letters, and as such he will no doubt earn
  recognition from those who come to study his achievements in the
  future. Taste in humor is at best a fickle thing and not to be
  too much depended upon. Our fathers roared at Josh Billings,
  Artemus Ward, Seba Smith, and Orpheus C. Kerr, as they and we
  older ones have done at Mark Twain's earlier efforts. It remains
  to be seen whether our children will find "Innocents Abroad" and
  "Roughing It" as funny as we thought they were. Ward's humor in
  its evanescent qualities was much like the best of Twain, but the
  present generation finds "The Genial Showman" a trifle caviar
  today.</p>

  <p>It is not unlikely that Twain realized the shifting and
  uncertain reputation represented by the jester's bauble, and that
  this accounts for the varied nature of his literary output. It is
  certain that he set much more store on what he produced after
  1885 than on what he had done before, and that he not only
  dropped the Gargantuan laugh of "Roughing It" in his later years,
  but also confined much of his more glancing wit to after dinner
  speeches and interviews.</p>

  <p>This would account in part for his attempts at more serious
  things, his excursion into biography in his "Joan of Arc," his
  satires of society and politics, his melodrama, his
  identification with various civic movements, his delineation of
  boy life in "Tom Sawyer" and its companion book, and his serious
  effort at producing real fictional character divorced entirely
  from the element of laughter.</p>

  <p>At any rate, his humor, however it may be criticised, had a
  strongly native quality. This was as true of his finer as of his
  coarser moods. Andrew Lang speaks of Twain's "almost
  Mephistophelean coolness, an unwearying search after the comic
  side of serious subjects, after the mean possibilities of the
  sublime--these with a native sense of incongruities and a
  glorious vein of exaggeration, make up his stock in trade." This
  was certainly true of his earlier days, but for years he had
  substituted for those qualities a fine vein of wit which denies
  analysis as a soap bubble would. With added years his sense of
  humor took on, as he might have said, a more serious phase, and
  he used it valiantly as a weapon against corruption, hypocrisy,
  and cant.</p>

  <p>Well, whatever he was--jester, satirist, novelist, or
  reformer--he has left us the memory of many pleasant hours, of a
  life honestly and usefully lived, and of a most genial and
  lovable personality.</p>
