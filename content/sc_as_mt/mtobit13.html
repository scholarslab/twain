    <font size="+1">MARK TWAIN ABROAD</font>
  </center><br />
  <br />
  The obituary notices and appreciations of Mark Twain in the
  foreign press reveal an acquaintance with his works and an
  intimate interest in his personality such as it has been the lot
  of no other American author to deserve. From the comments of the
  London journals it might be inferred that a favorite British
  writer had passed away, and the tributes of the German and
  Italian press indicate that his death is regarded in Berlin and
  Rome as a personal loss.

  <p>One reason of his popularity abroad is no doubt to be found in
  the universality of the sense of humor which makes what New York
  is laughing at laughable in Berlin. But it was chiefly the very
  difference of the quality of Mark Twain's humor from anything in
  British or Continental humorous literature which appealed to
  foreign readers. It was as characteristically American as negro
  minstrelsy or the Wild West, as Dan Rice or Buffalo Bill, and was
  relished accordingly by virtue of its originality and
  contrast.</p>

  <p>Foreign and particularly British appreciation of our native
  authors has been largely based on their distinctive Americanism,
  as in the case of Cooper, Walt Whitman, and Bret Harte. These
  attributes Mark Twain possessed in an unusual degree. His was a
  new and racy humor, more representatively American than that of
  any of his predecessors and with its roots deeper down in
  national traits -- more democratic than Lowell's and with more
  substance than that of his early contemporaries. To Europe, Mark
  Twain was the American character personified -- Uncle Sam himself
  in his drollest mood masking a shrewd philosophy with a jest.</p>
