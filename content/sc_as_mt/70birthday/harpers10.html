        <b>AGNES REPPLIER said:</b><br />
        <br />
        L<font size="-1">ADIES</font> and Gentlemen, I dare say you
        all know what it is to remember one or two lines of verse;
        I am not speaking now of anything grand enough to become
        poetry, but lines that linger always in your memory and
        give you renewed pleasure when you recall them. Two such
        lines I have at home in some verses written by Mr. Andrew
        Lang in honor of Mr. Clemen's Jubilee twenty years ago. Mr.
        Lang complains that<br />

        <blockquote>
          "He hears it held with pain<br />
          That fifty years have passed and gone<br />
          That dawns the morrow star<br />
          Which passed above the wain,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Mark Twain."
        </blockquote>Seventy years have gone now. He has told us
        what an infant he was, -- but seventy years make a great
        difference in age, in the love of life. We are all trying
        to live as morally as we can. There is no corner of England
        or the United States where Mark Twain's name fails to
        awaken some response. There is not a remote book-store in
        Great Britain -- and I have made many a long and loving
        study of book-stores -- where I have not found American
        literature represented by <i>Innocents Abroad</i> and
        <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> and it seems as though our ignorant
        foreigners are our local guides, as indeed I have been to a
        courteous Englishwoman who thought I lived in a town not
        destitute of inhabitants and associated closely with
        English history -- that is, she did when I told her -- and
        then to have her ask me sweetly: "Do you have all the
        comforts of life in Philadelphia?" A famous English artist
        once said to me: "Philadelphia, -- that word has a familiar
        sound to me. Oh, I have seen it on two of our tombstones at
        Wells."<br />
        <br />
        Well, I have found one or two names which are open sesames
        to the foreign intelligence -- Chicago and Mark Twain;
        Chicago, because it gave a fair, a village fair, and every
        one likes to read a writer of merry tales. Mark Twain cast
        his fame across the seas. Why, even the very donkey-boys on
        the Nile asked me if I lived in Chicago. And the Arabs on
        the Pyramids offered to do for me a Mark Twain act, and
        skip up and down those monuments, as they had been
        encouraged by Mr. Clemens in the hope, doubtless, that they
        would break their necks, forty years ago. That is a
        masterpiece that he has taught them. To have one's name
        linked with the Pyramids is what I call fame; and when to
        this laurel crown is added the loyal love of friends and
        the gratitude of many a tired heart helped on its way by
        the words of mirthful comfort, what can one wish for more?
        We know that honest mirth cures many a care and that a
        merry companion is the one we love, and that from the early
        times down to the present there is nothing worth the wear
        of winter save laughter and the love of friends.
        (Applause.)
