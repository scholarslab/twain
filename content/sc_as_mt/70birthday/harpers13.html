      and Ladies and Gentlemen: I have listened with very great
      pleasure to-night to a great many speeches that have been
      made on this floor. I have heard an honorable professor from
      Columbia speak of Mark Twain as the man who used the best
      English language of any of our men who write; I have heard
      Mr. Gilder speak of him as in his manhood, Mr. Carnegie
      indulging in that same line of talk. All men love the man. A
      number of our people here have indulged in the fact that he
      is the greatest humorist living. Now, do you know that Mark
      Twain has never struck me as being a humorist. (Laughter.)
      There is something infinitely greater than making you laugh,
      and that is, if you will permit me, making you shed tears. I
      remember the day, a great many years ago, when the first
      thing I ever read of Mark's came on those lines; I have no
      doubt he has forgotten it; I don't know that he has ever
      thought sufficient of it to put it in his published works; if
      it is there, I don't remember having seen it. But just as
      Charles Dickens will live in the history of the world and the
      hearts of the people because of Little Nell, because of the
      sorrows of Peggoty, and others of that character, so will
      Mark Twain live in all the things he has written. It is late,
      and most of you want to go home, but I am going to tell you a
      story in which an old colored woman told him, and which he,
      in his inimitable way, has told me. This old woman lived in
      New Haven, and came in every day, in the morning, and Mark
      said to her one day: "Aunt Rachel, have you ever had any
      trouble?" And she said: "Marse Clem, have I ever had any
      trouble? Now, I going to tell you. Now, Marse Clem, I was
      born in Maryland and my old mammy and I used to have plenty
      of trouble, and I just growed up with the hens and the
      chickens; and I had my own little teeney Henery, and he fell
      down once and had a great scar on his wrist. Well, just 'fore
      the war I was down with my massa, that was in North Carolina,
      and along came the time when they sell all the animals on the
      place and all the niggers on the place, and they knocked us
      all down in Richmond; they sold my old man and they sold my
      Maria and then they sell my little Henery; but when they came
      to my little Henery I say to the man, 'Go 'way,' and I beat
      him over the head with a chain. Fourteen years ago, Marse
      Clem, and from that time to this I never seen my little
      Henery, and when the war broke out everybody went away and
      left us on the place; and then the Union soldiers came in,
      and I was in that old kitchen garden, where you was, Marse
      Clem, and then one day down come the colonel, and I had heard
      about it, and I went up to him and I said to him: 'I want to
      tell you, boss,' I says, 'I had a little boy once,' and I
      tole him about that, and he says, 'How long ago is that
      fact?' I says, 'Fourteen years,' and he says, 'Why he
      wouldn't be little any more.' I said, 'I didn't 'member
      that.' Pretty soon after that I had a boiling in the kitchen,
      and they came in with a nigger man. You know I could never
      get along with niggers that blow on a horn, and this fellow
      had a horn, a black fellow, and I said, 'Get 'way, rubbish;
      don' wan' you.' That young man stopped, and I said, 'I wan'
      you to understand I don't want my place filled with tramps; I
      want them for blue hen chickens'; and I see that young man
      stop and he told them to tell the colonel. He went back till
      morning. Well, I was getting breakfast when a black face bent
      over mind and my hand began to tremble, and I say, 'Boy, if
      you ain't my Henery what are you doing with that scar on your
      wrist?' The Lord be praised, Marse Clem, I got my own again."
