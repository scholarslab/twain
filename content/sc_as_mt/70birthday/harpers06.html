      <b>RICHARD WATSON GILDER said:</b><br />
      <br />
      I <font size="-1">THOUGHT</font>, Colonel Harvey, you knew it
      had been decided by the Court of Appeals in this State and by
      the Legislature assembled at Albany that I was not a poet.
      The argument was made by my enemies that I was, and the
      decision went the other way. To be called upon as a poet
      to-night, with so many other poets here, is exceedingly
      embarrassing. I thought I was called upon because I was a
      novelist. I published a serial novel forty-five years ago,
      and as yet the book rights have not been spoken for. Colonel
      Harvey asked me once to write a serial novel, and he did not
      know I had already done it.<br />
      <br />
      Mr. Chairman, ladies, and gentlemen, I have looked about for
      some phase of the distinguished subject before us which
      perhaps might not occur to the other speakers, and one, also,
      which might be treated with becoming brevity. The phase of
      the subject finally selected was, of course, not Mark Twain
      as a philosopher, moralist, satirist, historian, poet,
      preacher, patriot, pilot, portrait-draughtsman, traveler,
      lecturer, general kicker, and sham-smasher; nor Mark Twain in
      his early military character; nor Mark Twain, as he is
      sometimes called, the humorist, it may safely be claimed in
      the Fifth Assembly District, where we both reside; -- not any
      one of these, but Mark Twain simply the human being.<br />
      <br />
      It is in his capacity as a human being that I am particularly
      interested in him; and I may say, being a neighbor,
      particularly well posted. As a human being, in fact, Mark
      Twain is supremely interesting. Of course, he can tell
      stories, write stories, sing hymns, tell the truth, and do
      all sorts of strange and interesting things in an expert and
      fetching way; and yet to my mind he is chiefly remarkable as,
      for instance, his friends the President and the Emperor are
      remarkable for the power of his personality; for his dynamic
      force; for the strength of his convictions, the energy and
      spontaneity of his expression; for his strenuous and scornful
      hates and intense afflictions; and for his lightning-like
      vision of the shifting scenes in the tremendous tragi-comedy
      of life. In Massachusetts they call this sort of personal
      force "jasm," or they did in Dr. Holland's day. There is
      "jasm" behind and in Mark Twain's literary art; "jasm" in his
      ironically venerable front; "jasm" in his international,
      intercontinental jokes.<br />
      <br />
      There is nothing so seizing or so important in this world as
      personality, and the personality of the cheerful subject of
      these inadequate remarks is, to me, his particular point.
      H<font size="-1">E</font> is reeking with personality. It is,
      as I have intimated, precisely as a person, as a human being,
      that he is most entertaining. I found, however, that to do
      full justice to Mark Twain as a human being would require a
      thesis so detailed, learned and spacious that there is no
      time for it to-night.<br />
      <br />
      He and you will rejoice in this, I am sure, for thus is, at
      least temporarily, averted that fatal result which was
      intimated in a recent English school examination where it was
      distinctly stated by one of the contestants that "in the
      United States people are put to death by elocution."
