        <b>IRVING BACHELLER said:</b><br />
        <br />
        I<font size="-1">F</font> the world's a stage in which
        every one has a part, there are all too many of us among
        the supers. Sometimes I have wondered why Mark Twain is
        permitted to hold the centre of the stage and talk with
        kings and princes, and delight or dismay them with fine
        wit, while our business is only to laugh and clap our hands
        and do the small, inglorious errands of the play. He has no
        uncommon talent as a player. Most any of us, had we his
        lines, had we his make-up, and especially, his wig, could
        win applause. (Laughter.)<br />
        <br />
        I knew a man who saw the stage before he began to play a
        part -- when he stood waiting in the crowded wings for his
        cue. I am going to consider for a moment that scene upon
        which he entered. New England and the South were on one
        side of the stage; on the other was a new West, and between
        them one could see growing towns and cities, and ploughs
        breaking the virgin prairies, and caravans crossing them
        going West. The play, since the martial scenes of 1814, had
        grown dull and wearisome. Slowly it was moving toward a
        tragic climax. In one corner of the stage was a race in
        chains -- in another, a stern-faced people claiming to be
        free and yet the slaves of a cruel and inveterate tyranny.
        In this bondage birth was a crime, life a penalty, toil a
        cure, leisure a peril, and earth a desert with all main
        roads leading to the torrid zone of eternity. One learned
        first that he was to blame for the sins of Adam, and next
        that he was more to blame for doubting it. This puzzling
        situation destroyed his sense of justice, while toil wore
        away his strength, and beans and pork and pie fell upon his
        liver. (Laughter.) He often quarrelled with his neighbor,
        and his neighbor, having provocation, if not deeper
        trouble, quarrelled back. A boy was punished by his father
        and set upon by the devil and scared by the minister and
        bled by the doctor and deprived of youth by discipline.
        This last was the greatest offence of all, for a boy
        without boyhood is apt to be a man without manhood. Later
        his soul was mortgaged to Satan, his land to the rich man,
        his body to a large and increasing family. He feared a
        score of enemies, including himself. He feared everything
        but riches, knowing, possibly, by some dep and truthful
        intuition, that the needle's eye would be broad enough for
        him. Those days religion was a bit like modern
        life-insurance -- the elect increased their salaries while
        the general policy-holder had only a dwindling hope.
        (Laughter.) The devil sat in the House of Mirth and
        corrupted the Legislature. (Laughter.) But, thank God,
        while we may call it life-insurance for the policy-holder,
        it has proved to be death-insurance for the devil and his
        friends. (Laughter.) Therein the analogy still holds. In
        time the people rose against their oppressors. As we see
        the play in our memories we do not wonder that such a
        situation of injustice and despair must have its end. The
        great scene-shifter had as if he were moving the old hell
        out of the future toward the past, -- that ample storeroom
        of worn-out properties -- and as if, then, it were passing
        the present. It may be he thought it had served its purpose
        and was occupying too much room. The ponderous thing seemed
        to have stuck in the centre of the stage, and the devil and
        his allies were doing their best to hold it down. Many of
        the supers began to smile. It may be they were the least
        bit amused -- it may be they were a little weary and
        longing for more cheerful scenes. Be that as it may, the
        manager had already found his great comedian.<br />
        <br />
        In the next act we see the son of the Puritans leave their
        gloomy home and join the many caravans that are going West.
        We see them delve and build; we see them forget their
        kinship to the worm; we seem them find gold and something
        better -- happiness -- for it is a fact that real American
        happiness was first discovered in the West. In the open air
        and the frolic of the camp they enjoyed the belated,
        careless boyhood of a man. For better or worse they threw
        off the yoke of the devil's tyranny and declared themselves
        free and independent. It was a time of great discoveries,
        and the greatest was this: on the lonely plain and mountain
        they discovered God in their own hearts, and He spoke to
        them with a singular and loving authority. Then and there
        an historic thing happened -- every man became his own
        preacher. If the sermon were not so he didn't have to
        believe it. We see men learning that, instead of being to
        blame for Adam's sin, Adam was at least partly to blame for
        theirs; that toil is not a curse, but a blessing; that
        every-day religion is seven times more important than
        Sunday religion; that fear makes a coward of a man. "God
        hates a coward" became one of their maxims.<br />
        <br />
        Suddenly a wave of laughter sweeps over the stage from the
        far left. A young man has come in view, and is telling a
        story. The saddened spirit of the crowd finds relief and
        joy in it. They call him to the centre of the stage, and
        there he has remained, shooting folly as it flew, and
        filling all hearts with the immeasurable bounty of his own.
        The crowd began to hustle Satan towards the wings. He
        voluntarily gave them the considerable benefit of half his
        salary for two weeks and then resigned. Our comedian
        scattered the bread of happiness, and dark shadows grew
        less in the light of his good cheer. Many kept up their
        policies in the old insurance company, and read Mark Twain
        for consolation, and wisdom came with humor and courage
        with cheerfulness. Now who has not discovered the moral of
        the great play that heaven may be extended so as to fill
        the future and the present and leave no room for hell save
        in the past?<br />
        <br />
        Mark Twain, exorciser of demons, leader in the conquest of
        the great upper world of fancy, discoverer of eternal
        youth-- when I think of you and of that you have done I am
        reminded of two lines from Pindar:<br />

        <blockquote>
          "The divinity that dwelleth in these things groweth not
          old,<br />
          Nor can oblivion drown them in sleep."
        </blockquote>(Applause.)
