        the dinner held to celebrate the seventieth birthday of
        Mark Twain--it is difficult to write of him by his real
        name instead of by that name which has become a household
        word wherever the English language is spoken. He is one of
        the citizens whom all Americans should delight to honor,
        for he has rendered a great and peculiar service to
        America, and his writings, though such as no one but an
        American could have written, yet emphatically come within
        that small list which are written for no particular
        country, but for all countries, and which are not merely
        written for the time being, but have an abiding and
        permanent value. May he live long, and year by year may he
        add to the sum of admirable work that he has done.<br />

        inability to accept your invitation to dine with Mr.
        Clemens. I am the more sorry because this is the second,
        indeed I think the third, occasion when I have had to
        decline a like invitation.<br />
        <br />
        I owe to Mr. Clemens many hours of agreeable recreation,
        and to take the census of the honest laughs he has given me
        is beyond my arithmetical capacity, and really nowadays,
        although many people may be able to interest you with what
        they write and a few be competent to generally amuse, a
        man, the music of whose mirth covered the whole gamut of
        the comic from the most delicate humor to side-shaking fun,
        is very, very rare.<br />
        <br />
        Your guest has been for many years a tremendous
        contribution to the gayety of nations, but, beyond that, he
        has given us such an ideal example of manly honor in the
        conduct of life that we have doubly to thank the man who, I
        hope, enjoys his own capacity to produce a laugh as much as
        does the world which shares with him the joy of what he has
        given so freely.<br />

          TO MARK TWAIN ON HIS SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY

        <blockquote>
          Back of the New, with its filmy veil,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; (You'll find him somewhere, still)<br />
          There's a barefoot boy with a stone-bruised heel,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; And a bird-note in his trill.<br />
          <br />
          He knew how poverty built her nest,--<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Where sorrow had dwelt with pain;<br />
          He had felt the cry of a broken heart,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; And the sunshine after the rain.<br />
          <br />
          And it came to his heart as a prayer might come,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Or the dew that the flowers quaff,--<br />
          That the drudging old world was poor and sad,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; For the simple boon of a laugh.<br />
          <br />
          Men passed him by in the maddened race<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; For glory and fame and gold;<br />
          But the barefoot boy with the stone-bruised hell,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Went whistling, as of old.<br />
          <br />
          Back of the New are the graves of the Past,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; That are lost in regret and tears;<br />
          And the men that sought fame and the men that sought
          gold<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Are hid by the dust of the years.<br />
          <br />
          But the barefoot boy with the stone-bruised heel,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Who whistled and dreamed the while,--<br />
          He has girdled the earth with his name and fame,--<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Made the whole of the wide world
          smile.<br />
          <br />
          So here's to him now, in his merriest mood, --<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; A wizard of joy to men;<br />
          To the sunshine he chased in the corners of life,
          --<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; And here's to his threescore and ten!

        kind invitation to the Mark Twain dinner in the hope that I
        might find it convenient to attend, but conditions have so
        unexpectedly arrayed themselves against my desires that it
        will be impossible for me to be a guest.<br />

        There is no man in the world that has won in a worthier way
        the right to be honored in all ways. Having no purpose to
        do so, he has written the great American novel; without at
        all intending it, he has set for the young men in this age
        of commercialism, greed, and graft, a far-reaching example
        of simple, old-fashioned honesty; and following the
        suggestions of a heart almost too big for one body, he is
        the friend and champion of all who are poor and oppressed,
        and especially of those who have no voice to speak in their
        own behalf. Shams shrivel before him, and friendship takes
        on a new color -- a new meaning -- when he is concerned in
        it. Just give him the love of an old Georgia cracker, and
        say that I should like to be there.<br />

        If there's any way to do it, if there's any way to
        find<br />
        Any trail that leads to Boyland and its fancies, would you
        mind<br />
        Going back to where Tom Sawyer is with Huckleberry
        Finn,<br />
        And reminding them we're waiting for more trouble to
        begin?<br />
        If there's any way to find them, with their laughter and
        their song,<br />
        Will you go, -- and, while you're going, take a lot of us
        along?<br />
        <br />
        You must know where they are staying. Can't you let the
        nations slide<br />
        And get up a big excursion to the place where they
        abide?<br />
        Let us quiver with the purest, unadulterated joy<br />
        Of another introduction to a sure-for-certain boy.<br />
        If there's any way to find them, we are all prepared to
        grin<br />
        When Tom Sawyer comes to greet us, leading Huckleberry
        Finn.<br />
        <br />
        If there's any way to find them at their old familiar
        pranks,<br />
        There's a million of us ready to declare a vote of
        thanks;<br />
        There's another million ready to be tickled through and
        through<br />
        At the thought of once more knowing what those youngsters
        say and do.<br />
        If there's any way to reach them! You know where they've
        always been --<br />
        Won't you go and find Tom Sawyer, and call Huckleberry
        Finn?<br />
        <br />
        We'd be mighty glad to see them; we should count it
        splendid luck,<br />
        Could we find another volume introducing Tom and
        Huck,<br />
        With their fishing, and their fighting, and their freckles,
        and their fun, --<br />
        And we'd chuckle through the pages, and we'd sigh when it
        was done!<br />
        Can't you let the nations ramble in their blindness and
        their sin<br />
        And renew our old acquaintance with Tom Sawyer and Huck
        Finn?<br />

        <blockquote>
          Mirth is forever young, and laughters leap<br />
          From the fair lips of gods immortal too;<br />
          And tenderness and truth know naught of age.<br />
          Nor can the soul's capacity for rage<br />
          At dark injustice ever know decay: --<br />
          You, of these deathless qualities compact,<br />
          Must needs escape the fate dull mortals reap, --<br />
          Life proves her fairest promises in you,<br />
          In every written word and fearless act<br />
          Sees her high dreams of chivalry come true.<br />
          <br />
          How shine at times the brow of honest men! --<br />
          Rare as the stars upon a clouded night,<br />
          That gleam with richer lustre in despite<br />
          Of darkness all around them, and again<br />
          Inspire our hope and shame away our pain, --<br />
          So do you shine and cheer us on, Mark Twain!<br />
          How we have laughed with you! How you have laughed<br />
          With us -- and sometimes we have wept together,<br />
          For there is every kind of storm to weather<br />
          In Life's long voyage, every kind of craft<br />
          To sail in, and each sailor can but do<br />
          The best that in him lies: so, if he drown,<br />
          We still can say, Well, there a Man went down.<br />
          And what we like is this, Mark Twain, in you,<br />
          That you were ever cheerful at the wheel<br />
          Whether in rain or sun, and no man knew<br />
          From what you wrought, what sorrow you might feel.<br />
          <br />
          And now, as on your head these seventy years<br />
          Have whitened, and you wear the varied crown<br />
          Of Life, full-gemmed with laughter and with tears,<br />
          We greet you and we bless you. May no frown<br />
          Of churlish fate have power to haul down<br />
          The standard you have flung upon the air<br />
          Of our American, and may it there,<br />
          The symbol of manhood fearless, free,<br />
          Forever float for all the world to see!
