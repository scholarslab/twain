        <br />
        W<font size="-1">HO</font> are these thy servants, the
        feminine contingent, that they are asked to add a soprano
        note to the paean of praise wafted to our distinguished
        guest? Does it mean that our host believes there is no sex
        in literature? I hope not, for when a male author assures
        me that such is his belief I always feels that he is
        delivering an oblique compliment to himself, and at the
        same time assuring me that if we persevere we may
        ultimately reach his level.<br />
        <br />
        Flattering as is this assurance I always feel moved to deny
        its validity. There is sex in literature, and, to my mind,
        the book of a woman, <i>when</i> it achieves the highest
        point of excellence -- in subtlety, finish, grace,
        delicacy, insight, even strength -- reaches it by those
        qualities of mind and heart that are distinctly her
        own.<br />
        <br />
        There is no use in depressing women by reminding them that
        they haven't produced a humorist, and there could never be
        a feminine Mark Twain! Of course not! And, if it were
        possible, how she would dislike to have her seventieth
        birthday blazoned to a carping universe when she didn't
        look a day over sixty-nine!<br />
        <br />
        When, then, I repeat, have the ordinary usages of American
        banquets been abandoned, and why is the voice of woman
        heard to-night at Delmonico's?<br />
        <br />
        In a very old book, written by a Baptist minister, I found
        the other day this artless remark, "In order to understand
        the sphere of woman we must first consider the needs of
        man," but frankly, though we may often have been needed as
        after-dinner speakers, we have hitherto never been
        asked.<br />
        <br />
        In the siege of Nottingham, two or three centuries ago, the
        women used to go about in bands of forty to put out the
        smouldering fires lighted by the enemy. Perhaps we are
        called upon tonight, by virtue of the well-known absence of
        humor in women, to quench the flames of masculine wit, and
        to give our brothers a moment's rest from their own
        pyrotechnic brilliancy. I only wish that the old siege
        customs still prevailed, so that my maiden speech might be
        made in chorus, by a Nottingham "band of forty," for my
        unaccustomed position reminds me of an argument I once
        heard on the terrors of shyness. "It is like the madness of
        a wild animal tamed," said the man. "No," said the lady
        with feeling, "It is like a tame thing driven wild."<br />
        <br />
        But, above all, I must not even seem to be humorous, or
        wave my minnow's fin when there is a Triton at table. A
        camel walking by the river's brink thinks his own hump a
        respectable size until he spies the reflection of the
        mountain just beside it. Then the elevation of his own
        person, which seemed to be so striking a moment before,
        dwindles into insignificance. The Dean of humorists is our
        guest of honor; his heart and his work as full of sap and
        salt and savor as when he and <i>Tom Sawyer</i> first
        dawned upon us, immortal and twin born. Nature was in an
        extravagant mood when Mark Twain was ushered into this
        workaday world. She must have created him just for pure
        joy, -- in a spasm of irrepressible prodigality for which I
        imagine thousands of stupid boy babies born on the same day
        had to suffer, so that the balance might be kept even. He
        has done his work as Nature did hers, flinging it off in a
        kind of joyous recklessness, charming the English-speaking
        world, and captivating the rest of the universe even when
        undone into French or German or Italian. As I scribbled on
        his dinner-card once long ago:<br />

        <blockquote>
          The most of us can manage, just<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; In scrambling though this vale of
          tears,<br />
          To make what critics call our "mark,"<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; And nail it down with hopes and
          fears,<br />
          Then comes along a man, who does<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; With ease what we have done in pain;<br />
          He makes at first <i>one</i> shining mark,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; And then he goes and makes Mark
          <i>Twain</i> !
        </blockquote>Those of us here who are native to the soil
        look back with pride to a little group who blazed the trail
        of American literature -- Washington Irving, Hawthorne,
        Emerson, Holmes, Whittier, Longfellow, and Lowell. We may
        well be proud of them, for they were all true artists, true
        Americans, and, what the gods to not always stop to bother
        about -- true men. Into this goodly company by direct line
        of descent walks, on his seventieth birthday, Mark Twain --
        Mark, monarch of mirth-makers!<br />
        <br />
        The "mirth cure," recently advocated by a French physician,
        is really not so novel a thing, for it is thousands of
        years since the great king of Israel declared that a merry
        heart doeth good like a medicine, while Shakespeare speaks
        of that "merriment which bars a thousand harms and
        lengthens life"-- not the life of the mirth-maker alone,
        but of all who brush his garments. Dryden was right when he
        said:<br />

        <blockquote>
          "Nature, in zeal for human amity,<br />
          Denies or damps an undivided joy;<br />
          Joy is an import; joy is an exchange;<br />
          Joy flies monopolies; joy calls for two."
        </blockquote>Think of the joys Mark Twain has divided with
        the world! oh, thrice fortunate man to make tired, sad,
        weary, dreary people smile and laugh, and only at wholesome
        things and thoughts! Think of being brother to a skylark
        caroling above the morning mist, the fireglow on a rainy
        day, or the sunny glance of a child. How much more there is
        in this merrymaking than meets the superficial eye. The
        best jester may so easily be the teacher, the preacher, the
        magician, the philosopher.<br />
        <br />
        Once upon a time, says a twelfth-century church legend,
        there dwelt in France a strolling player, juggler, dancer,
        tumbler, what you will, who made his living by the exercise
        of his art. He was a merry fellow, who danced and tumbled
        for pure joy of life, and wherever he went a trail of
        laughter followed him! Youngsters shrieked with glee and
        toddled into the streets, clapping their fat hands at his
        approach; staid fathers stopped their work, and busy
        mothers ran to the door with their babes in their arms that
        they might catch the sparkle of his eyes and the gleam of
        the white teeth behind the laughing lips. His merry heart
        made a cheerful countenance in all who saw him; his
        presence was a continual feast, and the coppers men threw
        him would have been well spent had they been gold
        pieces.<br />
        <br />
        Now this merry tumbler had a heart full of faith and
        reverence, and seeing how valuable men deemed the talents
        God had given him, he resolved to offer them up in
        thanksgiving to the source from whence they came. So he
        sought out a monastery, and being admitted as one of the
        ministering brothers, resolved to spend the remainder of
        his life in worship of the Queen of Heaven.<br />
        <br />
        But, alas, while learned priests and deacons might engage
        in the religious services, he had no part among them. He
        wandered disconsolate through the old gray building, and at
        last in a desolate crypt found a forgotten altar with a
        dusty image of the Virgin set upon it.<br />
        <br />
        Here was an opportunity for service, alone and unseen. What
        could he do here to pleasure the Blessed Lady? Ah, he knew
        nothing so well as the merry pranks that had made him
        famous and beloved; would the holy Mother accept them, if
        he but performed them with the full perfection of his art?
        So he threw his robe upon the damp stones, and in the dusk,
        before the deserted altar, began his songs, his quaint
        dances, his daring leaps and falls, with all the ardor of
        religious enthusiasm.<br />
        <br />
        Day after day the strange service was continued, until the
        poor tumbler, overcome by fatigue and emotion, sank into a
        swoon, and, being missed by the monks, was finally tracked
        to the lonely altar. They entered eagerly, tapers in hand,
        but their lights were dimmed by the radiance that suffused
        the crypt, for, as they stood in awe and wonder, above
        their prostrate brother hovered the Queen of Heaven herself
        with a sky full of attendant angels.<br />
        <br />
        Behold, the tumbler (but in a deeper, truer sense the
        eternal mirth-maker) canonized!<br />
        <br />
        Hail, Saint Tumbler! and hail, too, Mark Twain! Mark,
        Monarch of Mirth-makers, good artist, good friend, good
        American, good man! Long may you hold the place given you
        by the fairies when you first laughed in your mother's arms
        and she laughed back again, -- first and highest place in
        the American brotherhood of the ever-blessed Saint Tumbler!
