        <b>WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS said:</b><br />
        <br />
        These cheers, Mr. President, and ladies and gentlemen, are
        more terrifying to me than the dead silence of which I
        would gladly be a part. Since you have thought me fit, I
        could not wish a greater pleasure than that which you have
        proffered to me. I have written something prefatory to the
        toast I shall propose, and I wish before reading it to
        offer you what I believe ought to be a biographical
        explanation. Mr. Clemens has always had the effect on me of
        throwing me into a poetic ecstasy. (Laughter.) I know it is
        very uncommon. Most people speak of him in prose, and I
        dare say there will be a deal of prosing about him
        to-night; but for myself, I am obliged to resort to metre
        whenever I think of him. I fancy there is some strong
        undercurrent of poetry in the man which drags me down and
        sweeps me along with him. I remember three years ago, when
        he was a comparative youth of sixty-seven, I was called
        upon to respond to some sort of toast, and I instantly fell
        into rhyme. I don't know that I shall quite be able to
        scramble out of it to-night. At that time I praised him in
        what I ventured to call a double barreled sonnet; it was a
        sonnet of twenty-eight lines instead of fourteen. To-night,
        as he has the Psalmist's age limit, I thought perhaps a
        psalm would be more fitting; the psalm of David, if we
        could not get anything better. (Laughter.) But I found
        myself quite helpless when it came to the matter of
        preparation, and I fell back on the Shakespearean sonnet. I
        found myself, however, obliged to write a Shakespearean
        sonnet of extraordinary length. Shakespeare wrote sonnets
        of fourteen lines, mine is of twenty-eight. But you will
        find Shakespeare again has been improved upon since he
        died. Mr. Bernard Shaw now writes plays twice as good as
        Shakespeare, -- and I write sonnets twice of long as
        Shakespeare. (Laughter and applause.) I don't know that I
        need delay you longer from the pleasure before you, but
        such as my sonnet is I will read it. This is a sonnet to
        Mark Twain.<br />

          SONNET TO MARK TWAIN

        <blockquote>
          A traveler from the Old World just escaped<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Our customs with his life, had found
          his way<br />
          To a place up-town, where a Colossus shaped<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Itself, sky-scraper high, against
          the day.<br />
          A vast smile, dawning from its mighty lips,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Like sunshine on its visage seemed
          to brood;<br />
          One eye winked in perpetual eclipse,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; In the other a huge tear of pity
          stood.<br />
          Wisdom in chunks about its temples shone;<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Its measureless bulk grotesque,
          exultant, rose;<br />
          And while Titanic puissance clothed it on,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Patience with foreigners was in its
          pose.<br />
          So that, "What art though?" the emboldened traveler
          spoke,<br />
          And it replies, "I am the American joke.<br />
          <br />
          I am the joke that laughs the proud to scorn;<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; I mock at cruelty, I banish
          care,<br />
          I cheer the lowly, chipper the forlorn,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; I bid the oppressor and hypocrite
          beware.<br />
          I tell the tale that makes men cry for joy;<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; I bring the laugh that has no hate
          in it;<br />
          In the heart of age I wake the undying boy;<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; My big stick blossoms with a
          thornless wit,<br />
          The lame dance with delight in me, my mirth<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Reaches the deaf untrumpeted; the
          blind<br />
          My point can see. I jolly the whole earth,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; But most I love to jolly my own
          kind,<br />
          Joke of a people great, gay, bold, and free,<br />
          I type their master-mood. Mark Twain made me."
        </blockquote>Now, ladies and gentlemen, and Colonel Harvey,
        I will try not to be greedy on your behalf in wishing the
        health of our honored and, in view of his great age, our
        revered guest. I will not say, "Oh King, live forever," but
        "Oh King, live as long as you like!" (Amid great applause
        and waving of napkins all rise and drink to Mark Twain.)
