        A Prince was born in Florida, Mo.;<br />
        And though he came <i>incognito</i>,<br />
        With just the usual yells of woe,<br />
        The watchful fairies seemed to know<br />
        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Precisely what the row meant.<br />
        For when he was but five days old<br />
        (December fifth, as I've been told),<br />
        They pattered through the snow-drifts cold,<br />
        And came around his crib to hold<br />
        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; A council of endowment.<br />

        <blockquote>
          "I give him Wit," the Eldest said:<br />
          And stooped above the little bed<br />
          To touch his forehead round and red.<br />
          "Within this bald, unfurnished head,<br />
          Where wild, luxuriant locks shall spread<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; And float in years hereafter,<br />
          I kindle now the lively spark<br />
          That still shall flash by day and ark,<br />
          And wheresoe'er he goes shall mark<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; His way with light and laughter."

        <blockquote>
          The fairies laughed to think of it,--<br />
          That such a round and wrinkled bit<br />
          Of flesh should be endowed with Wit!<br />
          But something serious seemed to hit<br />
          The mind of one, as if a fit<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Of fear had come upon her.<br />
          "I give him Truth," she quickly cried, --<br />
          "That laughter may not lead aside<br />
          To ways where scorn and falsehood hide, --<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; I give him Truth and Honor!"

        <blockquote>
          "I give him Love," exclaimed the third:<br />
          And as she breathed a mystic word,<br />
          I know not if the baby heard,<br />
          But softly in his sleep he stirred,<br />
          And twittered like a little bird,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; And stretched his hands above him.<br />
          The fairy's gift was sealed and signed<br />
          With kisses twain, the deed to bind:<br />
          "A heart of love to human kind,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; And human kind to love him!"

        <blockquote>
          "Now stay your giving!" cried the Queen.<br />
          "These gifts are passing rich, I ween;<br />
          And if reporters should be mean<br />
          Enough to spy upon this scene<br />
          'Twould make all other babies green<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; With envy at the rumor.<br />
          Yet since I love this child forsooth<br />
          I'll mix your gifts, Love, Wit, and Truth,<br />
          With Spirit of Immortal Youth,<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; And call the mixture Humor!"
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          The fairies vanished with their glittering train;<br />
          But here's the Prince with all their gifts:<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; <i>Mark
          Twain</i>.
