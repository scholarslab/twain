      <b>REX E. BEACH said:</b><br />
      <br />
      Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies, and Gentlemen: This is a remarkable
      occasion for me on more than one account. In part, because it
      is the first literary banquet I ever attended where I did not
      have to look up the names of the books written by the guest
      of honor. I had planned a speech for this evening showing to
      Mr. Clemens the remarkable improvement and refinement which
      has occurred in American humor since the day in which he
      wrote <i>Tom Sawyer</i> and <i>Innocents Abroad</i>, but I
      will be unable to deliver it, because the man who was to
      bring the slapsticks and the bladder has not yet
      arrived.<br />
      <br />
      I once tried this modern American ten, twent', thirt' Keith
      circuit brand humor at a bohemian dinner in South Bend. I had
      a large assortment of near-jokes of my own making, and
      arranged for the gentleman who sat next to me to rise up and
      swat me in the jowl with a folded newspaper at the end of
      each one. I had just finished explaining "Why the chicken
      crossed --" which I consider one of my best jokes -- perhaps
      some of you have never heard it? -- when he found that he had
      forgotten his newspaper. Therefore, he laid violent hands
      upon the only thing convenient, which happened to be a loaf
      of French bread, hard-baked, and with a bark as thick as the
      shell of a lobster. I never suspicioned until some time the
      next day that his man held the highest batting average of any
      man on the South Bend Baseball team.<br />
      <br />
      Perhaps the perusal at an early age of Mr. Clemen's
      <i>Roughing It</i> had much to do with my inclination to see
      the West -- that is, the West of his and Bret Harte's day. At
      any rate, I went in search of it, but it had moved. In my
      quest of the frontier, I followed it on and on, up into the
      arctics, where it had paused long enough for me to catch up.
      It was the same frontier of Buck Fanshawe and Hank Monk, only
      now it had chilblains, and, in place of a stage-coach, Hank
      drove a dog team. Its heart was as warm and its humor as
      keen, however.<br />
      <br />
      I shall not forget the first mining-camp I struck. It
      consisted of about 1500 souls -- and nineteen saloon-keepers.
      Outside of these nineteen well-to-do people, the rest were
      broke, and comprised the floating population, so called
      because alcohol is lighter than water. It was not a bad camp,
      however, on the whole -- one got two drinks for $1, and the
      bartender supplied a horse-blanket to throw a fit on.<br />
      <br />
      One day a stranger approached me with an air of great mystery
      and said:<br />
      <br />
      "Young fellow, I ben watchin' you, an I like your style.
      You're a hustler."<br />
      <br />
      There is no greater compliment that can be paid to a man in
      Alaska than to say that he is a hustler, and, inasmuch as I
      had never gazed at close range into the disgusting visage of
      hard work at that time, I was pleased.<br />
      <br />
      "I am organizin' a secret expedition, and I want jest one
      more man to fill out the number. You're on."<br />
      <br />
      "What's the layout?" said I.<br />
      <br />
      "Well, I'm takin' a few of the best men I can find up the
      river, to bring down a raft of saw-logs. I can't say no more,
      or else every man in camp will want to go along, and I figger
      I've told you too much now, only you look like a man who can
      keep his mouth shut."<br />
      <br />
      I assured him that I was the human hunting-case watch, and
      never opened my face until I was pressed. Then I asked him
      what wages he paid.<br />
      <br />
      "Five dollars a day and board." said he.<br />
      <br />
      "I won't go for less than ten," said I; "five dollars is too
      small," whereupon we argued, and after considerable haggling,
      finally compromised on five dollars a day and board.<br />
      <br />
      So one rainy night I took my roll of blankets and crept onto
      a river steamer, thankful for the honor conferred upon one so
      young.<br />
      <br />
      Now in this desperate band there were the boss, whom I now
      entitle a humorist, six tall unkempt Oregon woodsmen skulking
      behind heavy growths of whiskers, also three young men of
      about my own age and inexperience. Of these latter on was an
      ex-football hero with legs like iron pillars, another had
      captained a Yale crew, and did not know how strong he really
      was, while the third had even a smaller cranial development
      than any of us, which I now consider truly remarkable. He was
      a monster, physically, however, so large that if he ever
      stood still on a street corner a policeman would tap him on
      the shoulder and say, "No groups, please." He had the biceps
      of a blacksmith, and was named Fagan-- not the Fagan who
      afterwards owned <i>Collier's Magazine</i>. I asked him what
      business he had been engaged in before coming north and he
      said,<br />
      <br />
      "Rubber."<br />
      <br />
      "Indeed," said I; "Peru or Brazil?"<br />
      <br />
      "Neither," said he; "Turkish bath."<br />
      <br />
      That is where he got his muscular development, and he needed
      it too, because, instead of being sent to the forest to sing
      and slash our way through the stately timber to the music of
      ringing steel and clashing tree trunks, we were assigned to a
      shameful task.<br />
      <br />
      We had no sooner pitched our camp in the heart of the
      wilderness and many miles up a strange river, than this
      comedian boss of ours sent the six Oregonian woodsmen out
      into the forest with their axes, and for us clean-shaven,
      intellectual youths he unpacked four strange, unmannerly, and
      clanking tools, the like of which we had never seen before.
      He called them peaveys, or cant-hooks, and said that although
      they might seem awkward at first, in a week we would be able
      to eat soup with them. Then he told us what to do. It was
      work which in the early days had been performed by ox teams,
      but in later years had been done by donkey-engines and steel
      cables. It consisted of seizing logs as they were felled with
      our cant-hooks, carrying them to the river bank, and dropping
      them in. Now these logs weighed thousands of tons apiece, and
      grew at immense distances back from the river. Dense clouds
      of mosquitoes feasted luxuriously on our white meat, while,
      added to our other troubles, we were so far north that we
      constantly tripped and stumbled over the arctic circle.<br />
      <br />
      Inasmuch as this sport had never been included in any college
      curriculum -- Fagan assured us that it did not even appear on
      the Bryant &amp; Stratton bill of fare -- we mutinied, but
      the cook cut off our rations, so that we were forced to
      browse on willow buds and wild berries. We could not run
      away, because we were hundreds of miles out in the wilderness
      and had no rowboat. So we stayed, and lifted and grunted and
      strained until our eyes hung out like loose overcoat buttons.
      Gradually our atavism became complete. We reverted to beasts
      of burden, chewing our cuds, flapping our ears at the
      insects, and sleeping standing up. The boss put a bell on
      Fagan, and we followed him patiently to and fro through the
      forest, until we fondled every heavy piece of timber which
      grew in that whole valley. Then he laid us onto the raft,
      bedded us down, and took us back to camp.<br />
      <br />
      After that experience I felt that I had just been cast for
      gentler and nobler things, so I adopted journalism. In other
      words, I reverted to type.<br />
      <br />
      I came about in this way: One day I inadvertently strolled
      into a saloon -- accent on the inadvertently -- and noticed
      behind the bar a typewriter. It was the only typewriter in
      Alaska at that time, and the owner used it for a cash
      register. I borrowed it and started a newspaper; used to
      manifold ten copies at a time and sell them for $1
      apiece.<br />
      <br />
      Mr. Clemens states in his <i>Journalism in Tennessee</i> that
      he went South for his health. I came North with mine, and,
      inasmuch as the profession carried no heaven-born message for
      me, I proceeded to insulate the residents from their money in
      every way possible, and was succeeding fairly well when
      forced to close out my business, owing to a mistaken sense of
      humor. That is, I made the mistake of attributing a sense of
      humor to a man who didn't possess it. He was a thin little
      bartender, hollow-chested, with the cough of a switch-engine
      on a frost morning, and legs like a piece of Chippendale
      furniture. I printed a highly imaginative story to the effect
      that a Swede had entered his place one day and called for a
      drink of warm water and good alcohol. He got it, went away,
      and died. Upon being questioned concerning this, the
      bartender remarked with great astonishment:<br />
      <br />
      "Well, now, ain't that too bad! I though he said 'warm water
      and wood alcohol.'"<br />
      <br />
      As I say, the man was unbalanced. He had no sense of humor,
      and that joke went past him like a train past a tramp. The
      next day he crept up to my cabin, all out of breath an
      coughing considerably; then, after he had raised up, he began
      to reason with me. As I recall it now, he used a pick-handle,
      but I am not positive, because my memory is blurred and
      indistinct, and I have only one clear-cut and vivid
      recollection, which is of witnessing a marvellous display of
      Northern Lights in the daytime, which is considered a
      remarkable phenomenon even in that latitude.<br />
      <br />
      After he had gone I tottered forth and changed a few letters
      in the motto which had stood so boldly over the door to the
      printing-office. When I came in, instead of reading "Honest,
      Tried and True, " it said, "Honest, Tired, and Through."</td>
