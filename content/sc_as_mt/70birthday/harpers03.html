      <b>BRANDER MATTHEWS said:</b><br />
      <br />
      It was with the greatest pleasure I accepted your invitation
      to be here this evening, and I have been delighted to hear
      the proper praise paid to Samuel L. Clemens, the man, and
      Mark Twain, the humorist. Clemens, the man, more than any one
      else known to me, combines a childlike simplicity with a
      manly sincerity. With Mark Twain, the humorist, his humor is
      always good, his humor is never irreverent, never making for
      things of ill repute. The Chairman, in introducing me, took
      the great liberty of suggesting that I was the champion of
      the American language. I should like to be able to take that
      position, if I thought there was such a thing as an American
      language and not rather a better thing, the American branch
      of the English language, because it belongs to us as our
      birthright. They can use the perverted British language, as
      they do at the present time, if they like. If I were allowed
      to take that point of view, I should like to dwell for a
      moment on the masterly style of our guest. He seems to me one
      of the great masters of the English language. (Applause.) His
      is a great style. It is a style of his own, of course, a
      style direct, however, -- flexible, unacademic, rich with the
      fervor and the style of the American character, of the
      undistilled American, like the style of Franklin, like the
      style of Lincoln. He is a master of language, never slacking,
      but pulling words to do his bidding. He seems to me one of
      the real masters of our vigorous English speech. And since I
      have taken the liberty of disagreeing somewhat with the
      chairman who introduced me, perhaps I can take the liberty of
      disagreeing a moment with the guest of the evening and saying
      that when he chooses for purposes of his own to suggest that
      he is not a moralist, he is doing an injustice to himself,
      for one of the qualities which I should pick out of his work,
      more strongly than another, more particularly than another,
      is the morality of it, the essentially ethical doctrine, the
      natural sense that underlies it. (Applause.) This evening Mr.
      Lloyd Osbourne reminded me of a day which has always been a
      delightful memory, the single afternoon when I had the
      pleasure of meeting Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson; it was in the
      smoking-room of the Savoy Club on a damp afternoon. A large
      part of that talk or that hour that we had was spent in
      discussing <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> and <i>Tom Sawyer</i>. We
      agreed in praise; we agreed in thinking that either of those
      books was far better than that established favorite of the
      eighteenth century, <i>Gil Blas</i>, and, as Mark told me
      once he had never had a chance to read <i>Gil Blas</i>; and
      we agreed, I say, that <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> was the better
      book of the two, not solely because it had a larger field,
      not solely because it was the <i>Odyssey</i> of the
      Mississippi, not solely because it was the picture of a
      vanished civilization, but mainly because there is a finer, a
      stronger, a more strenuous moral decorum. Whatever Mark Twain
      may say, he has a moral of his own. He does his own thinking
      and he makes us think while he makes us laugh. He has his own
      ethical outlook on life, and it would be well if that outlook
      were ours also. Consider for a moment <i>The Man that
      Corrupted Hadleyburg</i> -- a parable like <i>The Pilgrim's
      Progress</i> and worthy of that master; worthy of Swift
      without the maliciousness of Swift's antipathy; worthy of
      Voltaire without Voltaire's malice. You can easily understand
      what the Englishman meant when he is said to have told what
      he said to Mark Twain, -- that he would give ten pounds if he
      never read <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> or <i>The Man that
      Corrupted Hadleyburg</i>, so that he might have the pleasure
      of reading them for the first time. (Applause.)</td>
