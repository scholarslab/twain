      one hardly knows whether to be more elated or more terrified
      at such an opportunity and honor as you have given me. I
      would I had the time to command my energies which would have
      given me the assurance to come, as some have come this
      evening, trusting to the inspiration of the hour and the
      inspiration behind it of the man. I have a lifetime's
      affection for Mark Twain, but my embarrassment consists in
      the fact that I come to you to-night with my strength
      discounted by a late sickness. That I only mentioned in order
      that I, too, may have my boast, that I have come from afar,
      nearly as far as Mr. Carnegie, to pay my tribute to our loved
      friend. But I must try and keep my head until I come to my
      manuscript, and not be like that good man whom we heard on
      the levee, Mark Twain, at New Orleans, when you came there,
      and Uncle Remus and Osgood were with us, and you read Bre'r
      Rabbit because we could not make Bre'r Rabbit read his own
      piece; and when you were leaving on the steamer every one was
      wanting to shake hands with you, as every one wants to shake
      hands with you wherever you go. And this good man was so full
      of the elation of the moment, so intoxicated with the pure
      spiritual joy of at least calling you by your best name or
      pet name, that he had not sobered up quite even after we were
      all pushed off the steamer, leaving you to go up the river,
      and he was coming down the stage plank with his arm around
      his friend's neck, saying -- hardly anything, but, "I, I was
      so embarrassed -- I -- I've read everything he ever wrote and
      I would thank him for every one of them, and when I got hold
      of his hand my heart was so big that the only thing I could
      think of his to thank him for was the "Heathen Chinee.'"
      (Laughter.) So I hope that I may have said -- I don't know
      what I have said myself, but I hope it's casting around for
      some word of tribute that might be more especially my own to
      the friend whose threescore years and ten we are celebrating
      to-night, and I believe that I am the only one in this entire
      company who ever spent threescore and ten almost consecutive
      days of travel, alternating on the platform in partnership
      and companionship with Mark Twain. It may be, while our
      attention is still concentrated on our friend, there may be
      room for me to allude to him as the only accepted interpreter
      of his own pieces by word of mouth, and the charm of that
      interpretation doubtless every one here can testify to from
      his own experience, and it is quite enough for me to mention
      them for your loving contemplation without another word.
      Always there was inspired in his hearers, and in his reader,
      the perception that what he received came from a treasury
      which nothing could diminish. I count that experience in the
      years 1884 and 1885 as one of the most notable in my life.
      Just twenty-one years ago that was. Both of us looked that
      much younger; I had just turned forty years of age and I had
      reached the very crossing, as I thought, of the dividing
      line; one day my senior partner -- the star in the troupe of
      two -- remarked that he was passing his forty-ninth year.
      "Your seventh seven," I said, and he said, "My seventh
      seven"; and now he comes to his tenth seven, and I trust he
      will go on to the eleventh, the thirteenth, and the fifteenth
      seven. (Applause.) I called that season one of the most
      notable in my life, because, for one thing, I saw underlying
      the homage of the people's heart all poured out in the floods
      of affectionate embarrassment to the man on whom they looked
      with such esteem and whom they crowned the King of Mirth. I
      learned then the power of his marvellous and overwhelming
      humor lay in the fact that it was always well grounded, that
      it was always the standard-bearer of truth or, at least, a
      majestic conviction of right and of human sympathy, as much
      as the rest. For seventy nights I heard his wit and colossal
      drollery convulsing audiences, and never for one moment could
      hint that the factor of license could seduce it. Mark Twain
      is never on the platform of King's Jester; he is always the
      King. (Applause.) I have seen him in sudden great junctures,
      -- you know I have seen you at times when you thought you had
      imperilled for an instant this kingly quality, and the
      thought always gave you exquisite pain. One night in a
      certain Canadian City, from time to time you could hear
      thundering with regularity that reverberation of sound from
      the audience that always greeted him, and as we drove back to
      our hotel Mark Twain was in a state of mental misery because,
      forsooth, he had spent his share of the whole talk merely
      spinning yarns, as he termed it, to an audience which would
      next morning realize the means he had sought to amuse them
      instead of giving them good literature. But, as I reminded
      him, we would have the same audience next night and he could
      give them as good literature as the world had ever had. This
      he did, and the result was as thunderingly flattering as
      before. Do you remember, Mark, how we sang almost nightly
      that old Mississippi ditty, "Jan and Gan?" I have never heard
      who that particular Jan was, but it is enough for us all to
      recognize here to-night that it was not and it is not yet
      Mark.<br />
      <br />
      Another of the things that I learned in that season
      twenty-one years ago, was that along with that perfect
      naturalness which was essentially his inherent character,
      Mark Twain on the platform practiced a painstaking heart. Do
      you remember, my old friend and big brother, that night in
      Buffalo when, after an excruciating succession of discharges
      of our shot, the steam-pipes began snapping and snorting, and
      you dared not answer them because you did not know how long
      they would keep up to the last word, and you went on with
      your reading while on your tongue all the time you had the
      request that "some one would please ask the janitor not the
      grit his teeth so loud"?<br />
      <br />
      Another aspect of that artistic temperament is evidence in
      this, that in all those seventy nights I never saw him
      betrayed into so much as a smile at himself, with the single
      exception when towards the close of a rather eventful
      evening, after the audience had been listening to his junior
      partner, the same audience broke into loud laughter on the
      appearance of the senior partner, and he could not help
      remarking, when a smile broke over his face, "Yes, that time
      they caught me." He confessed; he laughed, and I don't think
      his art left him even then, because I fancy it was the best
      art to laugh at the time. I saw in those days what an artist
      Mark Twain was, but Mr. Chairman, I am glad of the
      opportunity given me to confess in this gathering that I did
      not realize in those times how good a friend and how
      brotherly a well-wisher he was to me. Sometimes I think when
      the sevens of years have been seventy times seven, that
      confession is just what the world in general will make for
      itself. We have heard that the friend whom we celebrate has
      said he likes Cable well enough except for his religion.
      Well, I am bound to declare the exception well taken. The
      longer I live the less I am satisfied with my religion
      myself. But for all that, I must say that from the depth of
      my religion, -- Heaven send long years yet, Mark Twain,
      because you keep yourself too busy with more important
      matters. (Applause.)</td>
