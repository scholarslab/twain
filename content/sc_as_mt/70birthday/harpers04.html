      <br />
      I <font size="-1">AM</font> sorry to say, ladies and
      gentlemen, that I cannot promise Colonel Harvey anything
      better on the other side of Jordan than he has here, and from
      what I know is coming to him there I would advise him to stay
      here as long as possible. I have come here to-night to speak.
      Colonel Harvey wrote me a year and a half ago and asked me if
      I would not prepare an impromptu toast for Mark Twain's
      seventieth-birthday dinner, and I am sorry to say it has been
      delayed five days. That was not my fault. I had on my evening
      clothes that night to come to the dinner when I received
      notice that the dinner had been put off until to-night, so
      that all the fictitious writers of imagination might be
      gathered together. So I offer this toast:</td>

        Here's to the Prince of Wits!<br />
        Here's to his Seventy years --<br />
        Time the fugacious flits<br />
        Over this vale of tears,<br />
        But never a mark leaves in his train<br />
        To dimmer the loyal love for Twain<br />
        In the warp and woof of the hearts of those<br />
        Whose troubles and woes,<br />
        Whose sorrow and pain,<br />
        Have vanished and fled into thinnest air<br />
        'Neath the magic touch of his genius rare!<br />
        God give him a year<br />
        For every fear<br />
        His blithesome spirit has turned to cheer!<br />
        God grant him a day<br />
        For every ray<br />
        Of Light he's shed on Sorrow's way!<br />
        God give him power<br />
        For every hour<br />
        Of joy he's brought where storm-clouds lower --<br />
        And his seventy years will straightway be<br />
        But the end of a promising infancy!<br />
