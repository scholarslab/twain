        <b>ANDREW CARNEGIE said:</b><br />
        <br />
        L<font size="-1">ADIES</font> and gentlemen, I have never
        been caught in a more embarrassing situation. I was just
        telling Miss Repplier that the chairman was referring to
        one party, and then I changed my mind and I said, "That's
        Cable," and then again I said, "It's Van Dyke." And, after
        all, it was my pitiful humble self. You will never believe
        me as a prophet again. However, I liked what Mr. Gilder
        said about the matter. You are the princes and princesses
        of the republic of letters, fitly extolling your callings.
        I have no right to claim any share with you. I don't wear
        the wedding garb, as you do, -- but from the point of view
        of a man of the world, those who know Mr. Clemens know what
        the world little suspects. Beneath all the weight of humor
        that has made him famous throughout the world there is a
        vein of the most earnest conviction, the strongest
        conviction underlying, that breaks forth at times. You know
        the original St. Mark is pictured with a lion. Sometimes
        our friend is a lion too, and devours everything noxious
        about him when he gets loose and clarifies his atmosphere.
        Not Juvenla, not Junius, not even Swift, has impaled a
        creature as he has impaled one whose name I scorn to
        mention. The lion annihilates what it attacks. Beware of
        that lion. There is another point. There comes to every man
        in public life a supreme moment when that determines what
        manner of man he is. Our friend was tried in the
        refineries, the purifying refineries' fire; that man went
        into the fiery furnace and emerged a hero. (Applause.) He
        stands forever with Scott; he had done everything that
        Scott did. Excuse me, but I must construct that vein,
        because whenever I think of my friend, I go deep down and
        think, what manner of man is this? and he is to stand in
        history, gentlemen and ladies, as long, perhaps longer, for
        the acts he has done even more than for what he has
        written. (Applause.) Waiting at the station this morning,
        Mrs. Carnegie and I saw a venerable gentleman approaching,
        a gentleman of eighty-five and one of the guild, Wentworth
        Higginson. (Applause.) We renewed old acquaintanceship, and
        then we told him we were taking the early train, that we
        would not miss this opportunity of paying this tribute to
        our friend if we had to get up any hour of the night; and
        he said: "Oh, I wish I could have accepted Colonel Harvey's
        invitation, but my daughters would not listen to it. I
        should like to be there tonight to pay my tribute to that
        lovable man." (Applause.)<br />
        <br />
        Ladies and gentlemen, traveling through this life we have
        all, if we are worthy of it, met a few lovable men, -- and,
        oh, what it means! They do not preach to you; they do not
        need to. They come in to see you, or you go in to see them.
        Their smile is a benediction. You will never leave their
        presence without feeling you are a better and a kinder man
        than when you entered; and I see around me to-night half a
        dozen men of whom I believe the guest of the evening would
        say: "Yes, they belong to this inner circle, they cheer my
        life, they make me better; I love them, and I know they
        can't help loving me." And in the passage through life --
        only seventy -- why, my dear friend Wentworth is fifteen
        years older than you are, and I look forward to having
        fifteen years more with you. (Applause.) And then there is
        another thing I want to mention. A man like him meets with
        friends when he needs friends (applause); but let us pay
        them the tribute they deserve, as he has honored them
        to-night. I will cease. I would like to say more, but I
        won't. But I will end with this verse of a little old
        Scotch song. Let me see how it begins:<br />
        <br />

        <blockquote>
          "I'll say nae mair, but end my sang,<br />
          I hope we'll mek a pair<br />
          Where'er ye gang." (Applause.)
