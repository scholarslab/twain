      <br />
      I<font size="-1">T</font> is incredible, Mr. Chairman, and
      ladies and gentlemen, that you should be glad to hear from
      any one at this hour. I want to put an emphasis on the word.
      As I have heard these charming contributions in prose and
      verse, I have been reminded of that Saturday morning years
      ago when Tom Sawyer was ordered out to whitewash the fence,
      and he sat there hopeless, while the birds were singing about
      him, and then he devised a plan that Mark Twain schemed to
      make all other boys do his work; and there they were doing
      it, whitewashing the fence all day, and he went home at the
      end of the day with four marbles and some apples and some
      string in his pocket, everything in his pocket which a boy
      will have, everything which a well-ordered boy's pocket
      naturally gets hold of; and it has occurred to me that when
      Mark Twain wrote that he was in a prophetic mood--he was
      describing what we are doing to-night. We are offering
      ourselves to do his white-washing (laughter), and he is
      presently going home with his pocket full of compliments and
      tributes of recognition of his Christian character and good
      wishes for the future, and with his heart full of the
      affection which we have put there. Now, the thing that I have
      against Mark Twain is the extraordinary length not of his
      years, but the duration of his acquaintance. Shakespeare knew
      a good many people, and went back a long way to the beginning
      of his acquaintance, as far back as the early days of Greece
      and the beginning of Egypt; but Mark Twain ante-dates them
      all; he begins with our first parents. He understood and
      defined the psychological development of the first woman, and
      he also traced the growth of the soul and heart of the first
      man. He seems to know more about Adam and Eve than the
      theologians, but I want to call his attention to the fact
      that he has been too ardent, for in that historical episode
      there is a third person whose diary remains unrecorded, and
      it remains for him to write the diary of the Devil. (Laughter
      and applause.) The Devil still walks abroad in the land, and
      there have been many evidences of late that he is walking
      faster and farther than he ever did before. And then again he
      was present in King Arthur's court, and he bore himself
      through that with all the cool hauteur of an American
      demagogue, born on the Mississippi River seventy years ago.
      It reminds me of what happened in the Palace at Amsterdam,
      when a part of tourists was being shown through by a guide,
      who was explaining everything very volubly, and an American
      farmer who happened to be with the party immediately pricked
      up his ears and said, "Is that a real genuine throne?" The
      guide said it was, and then the farmer, quickly lifting up
      the rope, covered with red velvet, as is customary in such
      exalted places, said, "Well, if it is, I am going to sit upon
      it," and he sat upon it, before anybody could stop him. And
      so Mark Twain has in the same way seated himself on thrones
      and in presences, -- whether he was in doubt from the fact of
      not reading intelligent books on etiquette who can say?<br />
      <br />
      Then who will ever fail to thank him for the tenderness and
      beauty and piety with which he has recalled the marvellous
      career of that beautiful woman, Jeanne d'Arc. You see the
      round tower and square in Rouen which are associated with her
      tragic career. He has made the epic of the Mississippi, and
      he took the Innocents abroad and exposed them in all pristine
      purity to the dangers and pitfalls of Europe. Now, Mr. James
      has shown the American modified by Europe, but Mark Twain has
      shown Europe aghast at America. (Laughter.) He has had two
      great pieces of good fortune, concerning which I should like
      to expand, but as to which I must content myself with simply
      stating that he had the same good fortune which Aristophanes
      and Shakespeare and Cervantes had. He was not afraid of life
      when he saw it. He thought in order to be great and fine and
      real art must not be non-comprehensible. I remember not many
      years ago, at the Authors' Club, on New-year's night, when a
      distinguished English author asked Mr. Stockton what was the
      difference between an American joke and a foreign joke, and
      Stockton said at once, "Well, for one thing, you can
      understand an American joke." Now, Mark Twain has been
      comprehensible from the start. There was a sign in Venice,
      two years ago last summer, which amused some of us greatly.
      It said, "English spoken American understood." (Laughter.)
      Mark Twain has helped to make American more than Emerson has,
      who always loved the plain American. And the Yankee not only
      brought joy to James Russell Lowell, but, in my judgment,
      gave Lowell the only chance he will have of being finally
      among the Immortals. Then he had the great good sense and
      good fortune, like Cervantes and Aristophanes, to treat his
      situations humorously, because if there is anything that
      tests the condition of man, it is the condition of man in the
      new continent, living under conditions that are so unfriendly
      to his real spiritual significance that is must amuse the
      gods themselves. But remember, there is that Homeric
      laughter, and, my friends, that all the boys envied
      Huckleberry Finn because he did not have to go to
      Sunday-school or listen to sermons or go to bed at a certain
      time or wear shoes; he lived as his creator has described
      him, a gaudy outcast. Now, it has been the good fortune of
      Mark Twain to be a gaudy outcast all his life, and so he has
      ranked himself, in the opinion of the world, among the four
      or five groups of religious spirits in American literature.
      (Applause.) He has never been afraid to make companionship
      with a real man and a real boy whenever and wherever he saw
      them, without regard to manners or speech or dress. They have
      been a bright lot, those boys of his, judged from the
      conventional standpoint, -- a bad lot. I don't mean that he
      ever really collects them all for family prayers, but they
      have stood by him through thick and thin, and if the popular
      verdict has any basis now, they are generously supporting
      him, which is what all good boys do when they are loyal to
      their maker. He was a privileged character. The Greeks would
      have crowned him with laurel, and our hope for you and our
      belief now is that with the great reputation you have made,
      the laurel may bring you the absence which makes for things
      in the tumult of life, and will bring that respect which is
      for the soul of peace and joy in the maturing of a man's
      power and the return of his labor. (Applause.)</td>
