  <p>My Dear Sir:</p>

  <p>I sent you No. 1 of a series of 4 articles which I have been
  writing for the Atlantic Monthly, &amp; with this I enclose No.
  2. I saw Mr. Chatto in New York lately, &amp; told him he could
  have these advance sheets for one of his magazines in case you
  did not wish to use them. I have just written Mr. Chatto that I
  have not heard from you &amp; therefore cannot inform him whether
  you want the advance sheets or not. I have suggested that he
  inquire of you.</p>

  <p>Truly Yours<br />
  Sam.l L. Clemens<br />
  ("Mark Twain")</p>

  <p>It is possible, Mr. Bentley, that my letter miscarried, since
  you many have moved from New Burlington street. I will simply
  direct this to The Editor of Temple Bar, to make sure.</p>
