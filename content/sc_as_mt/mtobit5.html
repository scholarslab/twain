    <h3>The Death of Mark Twain</h3>
  </center>Samuel L. Clemens died on April 21 alter a brief illness
  at the age of seventy-four. A great career, characteristically
  American, was then closed. Literature, humor, humanitarianism,
  intellectual and moral progress suffered a severe loss.

  <p>Many glowing tributes have been paid to Mark Twain since his
  death by men and women of distinction, both of Europe and
  America. It is a source of satisfaction to know that in his
  rather sad old age, a period of personal bereavement and
  loneliness, Mark Twain knew that he had the affection, gratitude,
  admiration of legions of readers, young and old. He had been
  signally honored by Oxford and English literary and educated
  bodies; he had won ample recognition not as a "mere humorist" but
  as one of the most original and gifted men of letters of
  America.</p>

  <p>Mark Twain's humor, rich and delicious as it was, was always
  fundamentally serious. It was the humor of a deep thinker, a
  gentle but penetrating observer, a philosopher who loved mankind
  while seeing all its weaknesses. Mark Twain was racy, playful,
  whimsical, extravagant; but he was never guilty of deliberate
  coarseness, and as President Taft has remarked, "he never wrote a
  line that a father could not read to a daughter." And this in
  spite of the fact that he wrote much about rough men, hard and
  primitive conditions, pioneering, the taming of nature and the
  lower elements in man. He was breezy, vital, candid, colloquial,
  "western;" but the civilization, ideas and manners he expressed
  and expounded were essentially sound. Geniality, charity,
  unselfishness, informed and inspired every utterance.</p>

  <p>Mark Twain wrote in several styles and contributed to several
  forms of literature. He is best known, perhaps, for his earliest
  works, "Adventures of Tom Sawyer," "Huckleberry Finn," "Jumping
  Frog," etc., and certainly his studies of bay nature are
  wonderfully acute and entertaining. But he wrote excellent
  history, biography, criticism, disguised philosophy. "Is
  Shakespeare Dead?" the latest work, dealt with the controversy
  over the authorship of the plays attributed to "the immortal
  bard," and was keen and suggestive, if not original or scholarly.
  "Joan of Arc" and "Christian Science" were notable books of their
  respective kinds. It was impossible for Mark Twain not to be
  humorous, stimulating, inimitable, but in his most exuberant and
  irrepressible moments of mirth-making he was no boisterous
  jester.</p>

  <p>The cause of political morality, freedom, human equality,
  honest government, democracy had in him a staunch and courageous
  defender. He took a deep interest in the social and industrial
  reforms of the day, and supported children's theaters, social
  settlements and similar welfare work. He was an enemy of
  snobbery, solemn pedantry, cant and corruption in public and
  commercial life. His death removed a salutary, beneficent force,
  a rare, if not unique, personality.</p>
