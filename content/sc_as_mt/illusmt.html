          <p>After Clemens came east, Mark Twain's features quickly
          became as well-known as his name, although <i>A Tramp
          Abroad</i> (1880) was the first of his books to include a
          frontispiece portrait of the author. The American
          Publishing Company asked for a portrait to use at the
          front of <i>Innocents Abroad</i>, but he refused. To Mary
          Fairbanks he gave this explanation: "I hate the
          effrontery of shoving pictures of nobodies under people's
          noses in that way, after the fashion of quacks and negro
          minstrels." The picture <i>at left</i> is from the
          <i>Galaxy Magazine</i>, which hired MT to edit a humorous
          department called "Memoranda" in 1870. When it published
          this portrait in its August issue, it gave its readers an
          early, atypical look at what the person called "Mark
          Twain" really looked like.</p>

          <p>On the other hand, "Mark Twain" appears repeatedly in
          many of his books, but as the excitable, naive, hapless
          character he plays in the narratives. If the typical
          19th-century frontispiece depicted "the author" as
          someone to be admired, the cartoonish figure of "Mark
          Twain" who is displayed inside MT's texts was someone
          readers could comfortably look down on in amusement.</p>

          <p>In this section are images of the various ways "Mark
          Twain" was depicted in his books, from 1869 to 1899. The
          first two are from <i>Innocents Abroad</i>, and depict
          "MT" looking at the can-can in Paris, and weeping at the
          Tomb of Adam in the Holy Land. (For other images from
          this book, see the <font size="-1"><b><a href=

          <p>MT's next book, <i>Roughing It</i>, was another
          first-person travel narrative, this time dealing with his
          misadventures as a newcomer to the American West rather
          than the Old World. The illustration <i>below left</i> is
          the book's equivalent to a frontispiece: in it "Mark
          Twain" appears in the role of miner enjoying the illusion
          that he's finally struck it rich. The other picture shows
          him trying to drink the wine of the country. (The

          <p><i>Sketches, Old and New</i> (1875) was a collection
          of short pieces, mostly previously published in
          magazines. Because it was being sold by subscription, it
          was lavishly illustrated. Among the many pictures of
          "Mark Twain" in the book are two that depict him in roles
          closely associated with MT the Author: the first shows
          him lecturing in Newark, the second, as a newspaper
          editor. Both, however, maintain the pattern of depicting
          his incompetencies, not his achievements. The joke is on
          him as a humorous lecturer trying to make a deaf man
          laugh, and again as a journalist trying to make sense of
          a contribution.</p>

          <p>By the time <i>A Tramp Abroad</i> appeared in 1880, MT
          was willing to provide a more traditional frontispiece
          portrait (<i>below left</i>). On the other hand, within
          the narrative and its accompanying illustrations, he
          remained the comic misadventurer. In the picture <i>below
          right</i>, he's trying to navigate a raft on a river.</p>

          <p><i>Life on the Mississippi</i> (1883) is part travel
          narrative, but also part autobiographical memoir. It
          began with the series of pieces MT wrote for the
          <i>Atlantic</i> about Sam Clemens' experiences as an
          apprentice steamboat pilot in the 1850s -- in other
          words, in the days when "Mark Twain" only referred to the
          depth of the water, not to a character Sam Clemens had
          created. As you can see from the illustrations, however,
          the figure of "Mark Twain" as comic naif is superimposed
          on Sam Clemens' experiences, so that the apprentice pilot
          looks as much out of his depth as the tenderfoot out
          west. Note how young this figure is, though in fact
          Clemens was in his early twenties when Bixby "learned
          him" the river.</p>

          <p>The later chapters of <i>Life on the Mississippi</i>
          include illustrations of the adult MT making a pilgrimage
          back to the River in 1882 -- and one picture that
          suggests other ways in which the image of "Mark Twain"
          was shaped and reshaped. In the book's very first
          edition, at the end of a discussion of embalming and
          cremation in Chapter 43, the illustrator put a visual
          punchline to MT's joke by depicting him amid the flames
          of hell. According to Merle Johnson, when Livy Clemens
          saw this picture, she was so upset that subsequent
          printings of the book "omitted" the illustration "at the
          request of the author's wife."<font size="+1"><b><a href=

          Below is page 441 from two different 1883 printings of
          the book.</p>

          <p>MT actually held up the publication of <i>Huck
          Finn</i> (1885) in order to have tipped into the front of
          each copy an engraving of the bust of "Mark Twain" done
          by his protege, Karl Gerhardt. As a piece of sculpture
          solemnly presented, it suggests a great man, not a comic
          anti-hero. But the depictions of "Mark Twain" in <i>MT's
          Library of Humor</i>, published in 1888 and illustrated
          by E.W. Kemble (who did the drawings for <i>Huck
          Finn</i>), continue to show him in caricature, as in the
          picture below right, drawn to illustrate the
          often-reprinted anecdote of the Mexican Plug from
          <i>Roughing It</i>.</p>

          <p>MT published one last travel book in 1897:
          <i>Following the Equator</i>. By then he was over sixty,
          and had been through the traumas of his well-publicized
          bankruptcy and the death of his oldest daughter, Susy. By
          1897 photographs had taken the place of engravings for
          frontispieces, as shown <i>below left</i>. There were
          several photographs inside the text as well, but most of
          the pictures were still drawings, and as you can see from
          the drawing <i>below right</i>, the figure of "Mark
          Twain" was still available for comic purposes -- not only
          the reader, but "even the seagulls" can look down on and
          laugh at him.</p>

          </center><br />
          <br />

          <p>On the other hand, by this point in his career MT had
          also become perhaps the brightest star in the heaven of
          America's growing celebrity culture, and as such was
          looked up to with esteem as well as affection. In 1899
          the American Publishing Company brought out the
          multi-volume limited "&Eacute;dition de Luxe" of his
          <i>Writings</i>. The titlepage for the edition was
          "Designed by Tiffany &amp; Co.," and featured not only
          scenes from his works, but a reminder that, if he was
          born in a cabin, he now lived in a mansion (<i>below
          right</i>). Each volume's frontispiece similarly posed
          him as a distinguished man of letters: <i>below left</i>
          is the 1891 portrait that was used in Vol. 14,
          <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>.</p>
