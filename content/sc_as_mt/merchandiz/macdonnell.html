          <p>&#x00A0; &#x00A0; Admirers of Mark Twain were collecting
          his books and autographs during his lifetime, and after
          the 1911 auction of several hundred books from his
          library, the popularity of collecting of relics
          associated with Twain also grew. Most of these collectors
          were drawn to Twain because of his writings, and most of
          their collecting interest focused on his writings and
          things directly associated with his literary works.<br />
          <br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; But Twain's influence has not been limited
          to his career as a writer. His status as a celebrity had
          a profound cultural impact during his lifetime and his
          popular image has evolved ever since. Many people don't
          know Twain through his writings, but instead have a
          notion of his place in American cultural life based
          solely on his image and perhaps a few dubious quotations.
          Twain's name and image were used in the market place from
          the very beginnings of his literary career in the 1860s
          until his death in 1910, sometimes with his permission,
          and much more often without his knowledge. And after his
          death, his name and image were used to promote products
          and causes in new and even more distorted ways.<br />
          <br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; The relics pictured here were selected from
          a large collection and represent just a small portion of
          the surviving objects that reflect the commercial use of
          Twain's name and image during his lifetime and after. The
          emphasis of this collection is on materials from Twain's
          lifetime, and includes far less material from the first
          twenty-five years after his death, and even fewer items
          after the 1935 centennial of his birth. But make no
          mistake: the use (and cultural evolution) of Twain's name
          and image continues unabated today.<br />

        1873 and contrary to a popular myth, it was a success. The
        folding advertising leaflet at bottom is American; the pink

        box at center from 1909, and the box at right was first
        used in 1913 and was still in use in the 1930s. The "pug"
        dog sitting in the middle box was a "counter card" that sat
        on a drugstore counter to advertise Mark Twain Tobacco. His

        the large card at center was issued by Heppenheimer in New
        York in the 1880s; the three small cards at top (from left
        to right) were issued by Lone Jack (1887), Lever Brothers
        (1901), and Vice-Regal (1904); the two pieces at bottom are
        a card and biographical booklet issued by Duke Cigarettes

        Ogden's between 1901 and 1905.</td>

        advertise their motor cars in 1906, and Pullman used Twain
        to advertise it's new passenger train car in 1904. Riding

        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Twain was an early advocate for womens
        suffrage and was often quoted in the press. The poster was
        issued in 1910, and the small broadside was issued in 1909
        or 1910.</td>

        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Twain's endorsement of a political cause was
        a powerful force. The Twain pamphlet at left was issued in
        opposition to Richard Croker, a New York mayoral candidate
        of Tammany Hall fame. The pamphlet at right was issued by
        the New York Copyright League in 1885 or 1886 to push for
        copyright reform. It carried the facsimile signatures of
        Twain, Louisa May Alcott, Sarah Orne Jewett, Joel Chandler
        Harris, W. D. Howells, Whittier, Holmes, and a host of
        other authors. The large broadside was issued in Hartford
        in 1871 and used Twain's name. Badly written, there is no
        internal evidence of Twain's having anything to do with it,
        and it is not mentioned in his letters or notebooks of the
        period; he may not have even known his name had been
        appropriated.</td>

        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; In 1907 the Actor's Fund of America held a
        fund-raiser in New York City. Twain lent his name to their
        promotional materials for the event, and even sat in a
        booth signing autographs during the fair. Shown are a
        promotional letter with Twain's mimeographed endorsement,
        and a copy of THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER signed at the
        event by Twain, with the sticker still present.</td>

        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Twain crossed the Atlantic several times, and trans-Atlantic steamship lines used him to
        promote their business. Twain wrote a letter praising the
        bravery of a Cunard Line crew that saved people from a
        storm-tossed steamer in 1872, and in 1873 they reprinted
        his letter in their promotional leaflet. In 1896 the North
        German Lloyd Line got hold of a Twain letter explaining his
        scheme to steam back and forth across the Atlantic writing
        a book, and printed it the souvenir booklet they gave
        passengers.</td>

        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Twain encouraged this woman to collect her
        fictional letters into a book and she took his advice. She
        also borrowed an extract from his speech to the Associated
        Press praising her work by printing it in a promotional
        leaflet for her book. Shown are the 1908 book (in dust
        jacket), the promotional leaflet, and a promotional cabinet
        photograph of the author. Using the words of one author to
        puff the writings of another was nothing new, but Twain was
        victimized more than most.</td>

        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; John Knox was a famous Scotchman whose home
        in Edinburgh was the oldest private residence in the city,
        and Twain praised this 1898 book about Knox and his house.
        When a new edition was published in 1905, Twain's letter of
        praise was extracted and printed on a promotional
        card.</td>
