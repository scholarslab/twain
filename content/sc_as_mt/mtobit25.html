    <font size="+1">MARK TWAIN.</font>
  </center>

  <p>The thousands of people who have loved the great author for
  his works seldom thought of him as Samuel Langhorne Clemens. To
  them he was always Mark Twain, a writer of inimitable humor,
  whose voluminous writings were read with the keenest enjoyment.
  His life was long and varied. He had known hardship and he had
  known failure, but he had known as complete literary success as
  any modern writer. The success of "The Jumping Frog of Calaveras"
  was probably as great a surprise to him as it was to his
  publishers. It opened a new variety of humor, which is always
  welcome in America. When this was followed by "Innocents Abroad"
  and then by "Roughing It" the fame of Mark Twain as a popular
  writer of entertaining books was established. "Old Times on the
  Mississippi," "Tom Sawyer," and "Huckleberry Finn" gave to the
  reading public a delightful and intimate view of a phase of
  American life which was enjoyed as well by those who were not
  personally familiar with it as by those who were to the manner
  born.</p>

  <p>Mr. Clemens had a genially eccentric personality. He was
  always saying and doing things that no one else thought of saying
  or doing. But his wit was not vindictive or malicious. It never
  cut nor bit. It really came to the point where people always
  expected him to say something that would cause the immediate
  laugh and would leave no after-bitterness to rankle; and he
  seldom failed them. Particularly was this true when he appeared
  as a lecturer or an after-dinner speaker, in both of which
  capacities there was a great demand for him until the infirmities
  of age made it necessary for him to husband his strength. But
  even then he did not cease his work. Mentally he was as active as
  ever and the productions of his pen continued to appear in the
  magazines and in book form until almost the very end. If anything
  his imaginings appeared to grow quainter with his increasing
  years.</p>

  <p>The sterling integrity of his character was manifested by his
  heroic struggle to meet the obligations of the publishing firm in
  which he had been interested and which failed disastrously. At an
  age when most men are ready to retire from the fiercer activities
  of life he gave himself no peace and no rest until by his
  lectures and his pen he had paid off every dollar. It was the
  feat of Sir Walter Scott over again.</p>

  <p>While one thinks of Mark Twain first and foremost as a great
  humorist, yet he was more than that. Along with his humor there
  is depth of insight -- penetration into human life and character,
  keen and searching and true. As a recent writer has said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Three decades ago the literary specialists and arbiters of
    belles-lettres dismissed Mark Twain with the phrase,
    "professional humorist." But the critics began to see more
    clearly as the years mellowed "Tom Sawyer" and "Huckleberry
    Finn" into classics. Their standards became less academic,
    broader and more humane, and the change was marked by a
    universal acceptance of Mark Twain as a creator of racy
    American types, as an artist who had caught and preserved for
    posterity the rich, quaint flavor in certain fascinating phases
    of native life. A genuine humorist, yes, let it be said to his
    eternal honor, yet one who was not content with merely tickling
    the ribs, but who reached the hearts that beat beneath them. He
    was like Cervantes in making people laugh first and think
    afterward. Three generations grinned and made merry of "Don
    Quixote" before anyone realized that it was anything more than
    merely a funny tale; the same phenomenon, upon a smaller scale,
    might be recorded of "Huckleberry Finn."
  </blockquote>

  <p>There are few persons who have either known Mark Twain or have
  read his works that will not experience a feeling of sorrow at his
  death. It leaves a void that will probably never be filled in a
  branch of literature that is peculiarly American. For he was
  thoroughly American in sentiment, manner and methods.</p>
