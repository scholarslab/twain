    <h2>MT as Clemens &amp; Twain</h2>
  </center>

  <p>This form of signature may have been decided on by the
  publishers of the various special signed editions that were sold
  during MT's lifetime; when he writes the two names together on a
  letter or elsewhere he tends to keep them at least slightly
  apart. When he uses this overlapping form, he usually does let
  "Mark Twain" cover "S.L. Clemens." This edition of <i>Following
  the Equator</i> was brought out by the American Publishing
  Company in 1896.</p>
