  <p>More than one popular jester has gained his reputation and
  been forgotten since Mark Twain's humor caught the public fancy
  and made the man famous. But his popularity has continued and
  will doubtless long survive his death. The reason for this cannot
  be found in any superior wit of his humor. Some humorists who
  were contemporaries of his but whose fame has long since
  perished, were perhaps more witty than he. It may be found,
  however, in the serious purposes that stirred his thought and
  vitalized so much of what he wrote. Mark Twain was witty, but he
  was more than a wit. He jested, but he was not a clown. His humor
  was funny, but if the fun of the comedian was in it so also was
  the humor of a sympathetic and earnest social philosopher. This
  was the touch that has raised Mark Twain's writings far above the
  joke books, and kept his fame fresh through several generations
  of readers. His writings have the democratic ring-the ring of the
  democracy of the Golden Rule. Read "Tom Sawyer" or "Huckleberry
  Finn," and you find democracy rooted in the shrewd thought and
  harum-scarum experiences of natural-minded boys in the presence
  of the conventional un-democracy of grown men. Read "The Yankee
  at King Arthur's Court" or "The Prince and the Pauper," and in
  democracy's struggle there with the rude selfishness and
  ignorance of a buried past, you find caricatures of the refined
  ignorance and polished selfishness with which democracy struggles
  now. The death of this man at his age calls for no tears of
  grief. He passes out of life normally, after doing a life's work
  so well that it will be a wholesome influence with many a
  generation to come.</p>

  <p>The democracy of Mark Twain was of the kind for which The
  Public stands. Like his sister who went before him, and like her
  distinguished son, the late Samuel E. Moffett (both of whom were
  devoted to the truth that Henry George taught), Mr. Clemens found
  for his democracy a lodgment in that gospel. One of the
  testimonials to its work which the Public cherishes is a letter
  from him in which he declares his faith. "The Ethics of
  Democracy," a unified collection of Public editorials had been
  sent to Mr. Clemens because it contained quotations from his pen,
  and in acknowledgment he wrote from Florence:</p>

  <blockquote>
    &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; Villa di Quarto, Firenze,
    Jan. 7, 1904<br />
    Dear Mr. Post:<br />
    I thank you very much for this book, which I prize for its
    lucidity, its sanity and its moderation, and because I believe
    its gospel.<br />
    &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; Very truly yours,<br />
    &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;
    <font size="-1">S. L. CLEMENS</font>
  </blockquote>

  <p>"<i>Because I believe its gospel.</i>" To all others who
  believe the same gospel we are confident that this assurance of
  Mark Twain's sympathy will add to their appreciation of the
  democracy strain that runs through nearly all his writings.</p>
