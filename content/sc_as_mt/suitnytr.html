        <p>Washington, Dec. 7--Mark Twain visited the press gallery
        of the House of Representatives this afternoon and
        delivered a homily on the subject of clothes to the
        Washington correspondents. The author was dressed in a
        summer suit of white flannels, and when surprise was
        expressed that he should show such disdain for the December
        air, he said: "There is absolutely no comfortable and
        delightful and pleasant costume but the human skin. That,
        however, is impossible. But when you are seventy-one years
        old you may at least be pardoned for dressing as you
        please.</p>

        <p>"For instance I like the colors of the costumes that
        women wear. They are lively and not so depressing as the
        dark suits of men. At the opera house in the evening when I
        look around at the men in their black evening clothes I am
        disagreeably impressed with the fact that they are no more
        cheerful and no more pleasant to look at than a lot of
        crows. Man's dress of the present day is absurdly awkward
        and ungraceful. I am in favor of going back to the
        splendors in dress of the Middle Ages. Those were the days
        when a man could wear bright raiment that was a pleasure to
        the eye. The Chinaman wears comfortable and bright looking
        clothes, but I am not prepared to say I would favor that
        kind of dress altogether, though they certainly have an
        advantage in the kind of shoes they wear.</p>

        <p>"And yet there as been a decided change in the style of
        man's dress in recent years. Why, twenty-five years ago I
        remember when a man was not considered dressed unless he
        wore a high hat, and now--well, I know I wouldn't wear one
        of them myself."</p>
