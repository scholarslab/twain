    <font size="+2">MARK TWAIN.</font><br />
    <font size="+1">I.</font>
  </center><br />
  No American writer has ever enjoyed a more purely democratic
  reputation than Mark Twain. From village celebrity to
  international renown, he has been advanced stage after stage by
  popular suffrage. The plain, unbookish burgess holding both his
  sides at a public lecture has helped roar him into eminence. The
  freckled, brown-legged pirate who finds Tom Sawyer nearer to his
  business and his bosom than Robinson Crusoe has played no
  negligible part in the campaign. The vote of a retired merchant
  reading "A Tramp Abroad" in preparation for a European holiday
  told decisively in his favor before the tardy voice of the
  professional critic assented. When an overwhelming majority of
  his fellow countrymen had established his position, the
  universities recognized the fact, so that one day not long ago,
  he strolled into the Sheldonian Theatre, clad in scarlet, and,
  after a "very satisfactory hurrah" from the audience, was created
  doctor of letters by the University of Oxford.

  <p>During the last few years of his life, he attained a still
  higher honor. It is to be hoped that no one will attempt to
  distinguish the customary "three periods" of his development,
  because, contrary to custom, he was essentially the same in all
  parts of his career. One may distinguish, however, three aspects
  of his reputation. Like a political orator making his maiden
  speech or invading hostile territory, he broke through the
  reserve of his audience with a string of irresistible stories.
  Handicapped by uproarious laughter, he produced two or three
  pieces of fiction which demanded serious attention; but his
  leonine head had grown gray before he lived down his reputation
  as a "platform humorist." At his seventieth birthday he obtained
  a reconsideration of his case, and the highest tribunals decided
  that he indubitably belonged in the history of literature, if,
  indeed, he was not "the foremost American man of letters." After
  that, national feeling about him crystallized rapidly. He
  appeared in white flannels in midwinter, declaring that white was
  the only wear for a man with seventy years behind him; we were
  significantly pleased. After our newspapers had made one of their
  little breaks, he sent word to us that reports of his death were
  "greatly exaggerated." It was a phrase that we all envied, from
  the President down; we saw that he was not mere literary man --
  he was a public man. When he died, we abandoned the last
  reservation. We said with one voice: He was an American.</p>

  <p>To the foreign critic this ultimate tribute may seem
  perplexingly cheap and anticlimactic. That is, of course, due to
  the mistaken notion that we number some four score millions of
  Americans. As a matter of fact, we number our Americans on our
  ten fingers; the rest of us are merely citizens of the United
  States. Any one who will take a little pains with the alphabet
  may become a citizen; to become an American demands other
  talents. We are more than doubtful about Washington. Lowell said
  that Lincoln was the first American, but he forgot about
  Franklin. There have been one or two since Lincoln's time. From
  certain indications, it looks as if Mr. Roosevelt might turn out
  to be an American. Only the other day he sent us a message to
  this effect: "I know that the American people will agree that I
  could have acted in no other way than I did act." The American is
  a man of destiny. His word and deed flow inevitably out of the
  American character. On the one hand, he does a thing because it
  is right; on the other hand, the thing is right because he does
  it. Revising the thought of Henry V, we may say, Nice customs
  curtsy to great Americans.</p>

  <center>
    <font size="+1">II.</font>
  </center><br />
  The point is strikingly illustrated by a story which Mark Twain
  tells on himself in one of the chapters of his autobiography. It
  was in 1877, before a company including all the leading geniuses
  of New England, banqueting in honor of Whittier's birthday. When
  Mark Twain's turn came, he rose and entered upon a fictitious
  "reminiscence." Out in southern California he had knocked at a
  miner's cabin and announced himself as a literary man. The miner
  replied with marked ill-humor that he had just got rid of three
  of them, "Mr. Longfellow, Mr. Emerson, Mr. Oliver Wendell Holmes
  -- consound the lot. . . . Mr. Emerson was a seedy little bit of
  a chap, red headed; Mr. Holmes was as fat as a balloon; he
  weighed as much as three hundred, and had double chins all the
  way down to his stomach. Mr. Longfellow was built like a
  prizefighter. . . . They had been drinking, I could see that."
  And so on.

  <p>At the words "consound the lot," Twain had expected a peal of
  laughter, but to his amazement "the expression of interest in the
  faces turned to a sort of black frost." The whole story was a
  dismal failure; it was years before the author recovered from the
  shame of it. Speaking as a mere reader of Lamb, Jane Austen,
  Thackeray, O.W. Holmes, I am not in the least surprised at the
  New England frost. I know very well that Congreve or Addison or
  George Meredith would have agreed with the New England geniuses
  that Mark Twain's reminiscence was a piece of crude, heavy,
  intellectual horse-play -- an impudent affront offered to Puritan
  aristocracy by a rough-handed plebian jester from Missouri. But
  hear Mark Twain thirty years later:</p>

  <blockquote>
    I have read it twice, and unless I am an idiot, it hasn't a
    single defect in it from the first word to the last. It is just
    as good as can be. It is smart; it is saturated with humor.
    There isn't a suggestion of coarseness or vulgarity in it
    anywhere. What could have been the matter with that house? . .
    . If I had those beloved and revered old literary immortals
    back here . . . I would melt them till they'd run all over that
    stage!
  </blockquote>

  <p>In his mellow Indian summer Mark Twain himself grew conscious
  that he had become an American. He knew, therefore, that the
  speech was right, <i>because he had made it</i>. I confess to a
  doubt whether those "old literary immortals" would laugh at it
  even now; if they would not, as a countryman of Lincoln I should
  be ashamed of them. The man who cannot laugh with Twain must be
  either better or worse than the "overwhelming majority" of his
  fellow-citizens. To accept him is almost equivalent to accepting
  the American flag. When once you have sworn allegiance, you may
  find fault with both for the rest of your life without
  impeachment of your patriotism. "I paint myriads of heads," cried
  Walt Whitman, "but I paint no head without its nimbus of
  gold-colored light." He was prophesying the golden mean, which he
  called the "divine average," and which he knew was actually rarer
  than either extreme. He was prophesying Mark Twain. "Who are you,
  indeed," he exclaims, "who would talk or sing in America?" The
  antiphonal voice replies:</p>

  <blockquote>
    I swear I will have each quality of my race in myself,<br />
    Talk as you like, he only suits These States whose manners
    favor the audacity and sublime turbulence of The States.
  </blockquote>

  <center>
    <font size="+1">III.</font>
  </center><br />
  Humor, it is agreed, consists in contrasts and incongruities, and
  the essence of Mark Twain's most characteristic humor consists in
  contrasting this typical, nimbused American, compacted of golden
  mediocrities, against the world -- consists in showing the
  incongruity of the rest of the world with this nimbused American.
  It necessarily follows that the heights and depths of humor are
  beyond the reaches of Mark Twain's soul. It necessarily follows
  that his laughter is burly, not fine; broad, nor profound;
  national, not universal. When he that sitteth in the heavens
  laughs, he is not constrasting the year 1910 with the year 1300,
  nor the President of the United States with Louis XVI, nor the
  uncrowned sovereigns of Missouri with the serfs of Russia,
  Germany, or England. The comparison is intolerable -- let us mark
  a lowlier difference. When Puck, in the "Midsummer Night's
  Dream," looking out upon the bewildered lovers exclaims, "Lord,
  what fools these mortals be"; when Titania, waking from magical
  sleep, murmurs drowsily, "Methought I was enamoured of an ass" --
  the mirth of these subtle creatures is kindled by the contrast
  between sentimental and bottom humanity, respectively, and the
  exquisite manners and passions of elfland. If Twain had written
  the play, he would have put Puck into overalls and Titania into a
  hoop-skirt. For he ignored the ethereal hunger which troubled the
  creator of Falstaff, and never entered into the secret laughter
  of the idealist. Let us descend once more. It is said that the
  last book Mark Twain read was Carlyle's "French Revolution." I
  suppose he loved it incidentally for its picturesque and savage
  energy, but mainly because it proclaims that a man's a man for
  all that. He shows traces both of its style and of its central
  thought in his own work. But so far as I know, he never shows a
  trace of its heart-searching irony, of that universal world-humor
  which arises when the upstart, red-blooded pageant of time's
  latest hour is confronted with the grim, dim phantasms of
  eternity --

  <blockquote>
    Charlemagne sleeps at Salzburg, with truncheon grounded, only
    fable expecting that he will waken. Charles the Hammer, Pepin
    Bow-legged, where now is their eye of menace, their voice of
    command? Rollo and his shaggy Northmen cover not the Seine with
    ships, but have sailed off on a longer voyage. The hair of
    Tow-head (Tete d'etoupes) now needs no combing; Iron-cutter
    (Taillefer) cannot cut a cobweb; shrill Fredegonda, shrill
    Brunhilda, have had out their hot life-scold, and lie silent,
    their hot life-frenzy cooled. . . . They are all gone; sunk --
    down, down with the tumult they made; and the rolling and
    trampling of ever new generations passed over them; and they
    hear it not anymore forever.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Carlyle makes ducks and drakes of Charlemagne and shrill
  Fredegonda, but he laughs with a by-gone eternity. When Whitman
  asks that stupendous question, "Whom have you slaughtered lately,
  European headsman?" millions of strange shadows tend on him. He,
  too, is a humorist, and a grave one. He makes ducks and drakes of
  the "old literary immortals," for he laughs with an eternity to
  come. Mark Twain cannot be persuaded that we are such stuff as
  dreams are made of; looking neither before nor after, he laughs
  with the present hour; and he cannot stand the comparison.</p>

  <center>
    <font size="+1">IV.</font>
  </center><br />
  Not by his subtlety, then, nor his depth, nor his elevation, but
  by his understanding and his unflinching assertion of the
  ordinary self of the ordinary American did Mark Twain becomes our
  "foremost man of letters."

  <p>He was geographically an American; he knew his land and its
  idioms at first hand -- Missouri, the Mississippi River and its
  banks, Nevada, California, New England, New York, the great
  cities. It is insufficiently recognized that to love one's
  country intelligently one must know its body, as well as its
  mind. He had the good fortune to be born in the West; so that, of
  course, he had to go East -- otherwise he might, instead of
  becoming an American, have remained a Bostonian or New Yorker all
  his life, and never have learned to love Chicago and San
  Francisco at all. At various times and places, he was pilot,
  printer, editor, reporter, miner, lecturer, author, and
  publisher. But during the first half of his life, he went most
  freely with "powerful uneducated persons, and with the young, and
  with the mothers of families." The books in which he embodies his
  early experiences -- "Tom Sawyer," "Roughing It," "Huckleberry
  Finn" -- are almost entirely delightful. They breathe the spirit
  of eternal boyhood, they are richly provincial, they spring out
  of the fresh earth. There is a touch of melodrama in the first,
  and more than a touch of farce in the last, but in the main, they
  are as native as a bluff to the Mississippi or a pine tree to a
  red spur of the Rockies.</p>

  <p>It is when an American carries his virtues abroad that the
  lines of his character become salient. Mark Twain was a self made
  man, of small Latin and less Greek, indifferent to abstractions,
  deficient in historical sympathy and imagination, insensitive to
  delicate social differences, content and at home in modern
  workaday realities. I confess with great apprehension that I do
  not much care for his books of foreign travel. Like the story
  told on Whittier's birthday, they are "smart and saturated with
  humor"; but for some almost indefinable reason my emotions fail
  to enter into the spirit of the occasion. An uneasy doubt about
  the point of view binds my mirth as with a "black frost." I find
  myself concerned for my fellow-citizen, the author behind the
  books; beneath the surface gayety, the whole affair seems to be
  of appalling seriousness for us both. Ostensibly light-hearted
  burlesques of the poetical and sentimental volumes of travel,
  these books are in reality an amazingly faithful record of the
  way Europe and the Orient strike the "divine average" -- the
  typical American -- the man for whom the world was created in
  1776. Wandering through the exhumed Pompeii, he peoples its
  solemn ruins with the American proletariat, and fancies that he
  sees upon the wall of its theatre the placard, "Positively No
  Free List, Except Members of the Press." He digresses from an
  account of the ascent of Vesuvius to compare the prices of
  gloves, linen shirts, and dress suits in Paris and in Italy. At
  length arrived at the summit of the mountain, he describes its
  crater as a "circular ditch"; some of the party light their
  cigars in the fissures; he descends, observing that the volcano
  is a poor affair compared with Kilauea, in the Sandwich Islands.
  He visits the Parthenon in the night; obviously, the memorable
  feature of the expedition was robbing the vineyards on the way
  back to the ship. The most famous picture galleries of Europe are
  hung with "celebrated rubbish"; the immemorial Mosque of St.
  Sophia is the "mustiest barn in heathendom"; the Sea of Gallilee
  is nothing to Lake Tahoe. The Mississippi pilot, homely, naive,
  arrogantly candid, refuses to sink his identity in the object
  contemplated -- that, as Corporal Nym would have said, is the
  humor of it. He is the kind of travelling companion that makes
  you wonder why you went abroad. He turns the Old World into a
  laughing-stock by shearing it of its storied humanity -- simply
  because there is nothing in him to respond to the glory that was
  Greece, to the grandeur that was Rome -- simply because nothing
  is holier to him than a joke. He does not throw comic light upon
  counterfeit enthusiasm; he laughs at art, history, and antiquity
  from the point of view of one who is ignorant of them and
  mightily well satisfied with his ignorance. And, unless I am very
  much mistaken, the "overwhelming majority" of his fellow-citizens
  -- those who made the success of "Innocents Abroad" and "A Tramp
  Abroad" -- have laughed with him, not at him. So, too,
  unquestionably, in the nearly parallel case of that bludgeoning
  burlesque, "A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur's Court."</p>

  <center>
    <font size="+1">V.</font>
  </center><br />
  What endears a public man to us is what he has in common with us
  -- not his occasional supereminences. It does not damage Franklin
  to say that he was not so graceful as Lord Chesterfield; nor
  Lincoln to say that he was not so handsome as Count D'Orsay; nor
  Mr. Roosevelt to say that one misses in his literary style I know
  not what that one finds in the style of Walter Savage Landor.
  Writing from Khartum, the hunter tells us that, in consequence of
  hard service in camp, his pigskin books were "stained with blood,
  sweat, gun oil, dust, and ashes." We have a mystical feeling that
  this is very appropriate and beautiful -- that a good American's
  books ought to be stained with gun oil and ashes. "Fear grace --
  fear delicatesse," cries the author of "Chants Democratic." It
  does not damage Mark Twain to say that there was not a drop of
  the aristocrat in his veins.

  <p>In politics he was an intelligent but unspeculative democrat,
  committed to the principles of the preamble to the Constitution,
  preserving a tang of Tom Paine's contempt for kings, and not
  without a suggestion of the republican insolence caricatured by
  Dickens in "Martin Chuzzlewit." I do not think that he gave a
  "square deal" either to Europe or to the Arthurian realm; but
  within his own territory he had a very genuine sense of the
  brotherhood of man. He was not, like some more exquisite men of
  letters, a democrat in his study and a snob in his drawing room;
  he was of the people and for the people at all times. His tender
  regard for the social contract permeated his humor. It will be
  remembered that Pudd'nhead Wilson earned his nickname and ruined
  his chances as a lawyer for twenty years by an incomprehensible
  remark about a howling dog. "I wish I owned half of that dog,"
  said Wilson. "Why?" somebody asked. "Because I would kill my
  half." No one understood him -- the sensitive, symbolic democracy
  of the expression was too compact for their intelligence, and
  they fell into a delicious discussion of how one-half could be
  killed without injury to the other half. That, to be sure, is
  also one of the problems of democracy; but Wilson's implications
  were, I believe, both simpler and deeper than that. In not
  molesting another man's dog, he showed the American reverence for
  property. The American desire to be moderately well-to-do (Mr.
  Roosevelt's "neither rich nor poor") he indicated by desiring to
  own only half the dog. In saying that he would kill his half he
  expressed his sacred and inalienable right to dispose of his own
  property as he chose, while at the same time he recognized his
  neighbor's sacred and inalienable right to let his half of the
  property howl. Indeed, I am not sure that he did not recognize
  that the dog itself had a certain property right in howling.</p>

  <p>With almost every qualification for a successful political
  career, Mark Twain could never have aspired to the Presidency,
  for he was not a regular attendant at church -- a short-coming,
  by the way, which interfered seriously with Mr. Taft's campaign
  till his former pastor testified in the public prints that once
  at a church social taken the part of a fairy. In religion, Twain
  appeared to be a mugwump, or, more classically speaking, an
  agnostic over whom had fallen the shadow of Robert Ingersoll of
  pious memory. The irreligion of that generation is touched with a
  raw, philistine rationalism, but is thoroughly honest. Like all
  Americans, the author of "Tom Sawyer" received his religious
  culture in the Sunday-school, but stumbled over the book of
  Genesis and kindred difficulties, and was "emancipated." The loss
  of faith which, in proper conditions, is a terrible bereavement,
  was to him a blessed relief; when the God of the Sunday-school
  and camp meeting ceases to terrify, he ordinarily becomes a
  deadly bore. Having never known the magnificent poetry of faith,
  he never knew the magnificent melancholy of unbelief. His
  experience was typical, however, and his very unspirituality was
  social. In his examination of Christian Science, he admitted that
  every man is entitled to his own favorite brand of insanity, and
  insisted that he himself was an insane as anybody. That was
  enough to assure most of us that he was sound on "all
  essentials."</p>

  <p>"Be good and you will be lonesome" is, I suppose, one of Mark
  Twain's most widely quoted utterances on moral topics. At first
  thought one may wonder why this apparently Bohemian apothegm
  should have taken such hold upon the heart of a nation which
  above all things else adores virtue. But the difficulty
  disappears the instant one reflects that these seven words
  express as in a nutshell precisely the kind and temper of virtue
  that the nation adores. Like Wilson's observation on the dog, the
  saying is cryptic and requires explication. Twain tells us in his
  autobiography that when he was a boy his mother always allowed
  about thirty per cent. on what he said for "embroidery" and so
  "struck his average." The saying means, as I take it, first of
  all, don't lose your sense of humor as those do who become
  infatuated with their own particular hobbies in goodness.
  Calculate to keep about in the middle of the road, but make
  allowances for all reasonable shades of difference in taste and
  opinion. Don't be too good or you will find yourself in a barren
  and uninfluential minority of one. In America, whatever is not
  social is not virtue. When he put his shoulder under the debts of
  his bankrupt publishing house, the author of the apothegm himself
  explained its meaning. Natively fond of strong language, careless
  of peccadilloes, tolerant of all human frailties though he was --
  kin-making touches of nature -- his feet were "mortised and
  tenoned" in domestic rectitude and common morality.</p>

  <p>"We cannot live always on the cold heights of the sublime --
  the thin air stifles" -- I have forgotten who said it. We cannot
  flush always with the high ardor of the signers of the
  Declaration, nor remain at the level of the address at
  Gettysburg, nor cry continually, "O Beautiful! My country!" Yet,
  in the long dull interspaces between these sacred moments we need
  someone to remind us that we are a nation. For in the dead vast
  and middle of the years insidious foes are stirring -- anaemic
  refinements, cosmopolian decadencies, the egotistic and usurping
  pride of great cities, the cold sickening of the heart at the
  reiterated exposures of giant fraud and corruption. When our
  countrymen migrate because we have no kings or castles, we are
  thankful to anyone who can tell us what we can count on. When
  they complain that our soil lacks the humanity essential to great
  literature, we are grateful even for the firing of a national
  joke heard round the world. And when Mark Twain, robust,
  big-hearted, gifted with the divine power to use words, makes us
  all laugh together, builds true romances with prairie fire and
  Western clay, and shows us that we are at one on all the main
  points, we feel that he has been appointed by Providence to see
  to it that the precious ordinary self of the Republic shall
  suffer no harm.</p>

    <h2>Serious Humorists</h2>
  </center>Mark Twain's memory may suffer from a certain
  paradoxical habit we have fallen into when passing judgment on
  the illustrious dead. The habit consists in picking out for
  particular commendation in the man what one least expects. If the
  world thinks of him as a great humorist, the point to make is
  that at bottom he was really a philosopher. If his shafts struck
  at everybody and everything, the thing to say is that he liked
  best what he hit hardest. If one of his books sold five thousand
  copies, the attempt is made to base his future fame on the
  comparatively unknown book. The motive behind such reasoning is
  commendable enough. It is the desire not to judge superficially,
  the desire to get at the "real" man behind the mask which all of
  us, according to tradition, wear in life. It is a praiseworthy
  purpose, but, in the hands of the unskilled or the careless, a
  perilous one. And worse than either is the intellectual snob
  whose business it is constitutionally to disagree with the
  obvious. We make no attempt to classify the writer who has
  declared that Mark Twain, when he wrote "Innocents Abroad," was
  terribly in earnest; that he set out to satirize and was funny
  only because he could not help it. This represents the extreme of
  a tendency that is made manifest on every side, to turn Mark
  Twain into everything but what he was--a great compeller of
  laughter.

  <p>One gets dreadfully weary of such topsy-turvy criticism. There
  are times when one would like to believe that Napoleon will be
  remembered because he won Austerlitz and Marengo, and not because
  he divided up France into a vast number of small peasant
  holdings; that Lincoln was a great man because he signed the
  Proclamation of Emancipation and wrote the Gettysburg address,
  and not because he kept his temper under criticism and in
  adversity. It is well to try to pierce behind the veil of Maya,
  but no amount of analysis can do away with the popularly accepted
  beliefs that mothers are primarily maternal, that actresses'
  talents lie in the direction of the stage, that joyful people
  laugh, and that people who make wry faces are either pessimists
  or dyspeptics. What use is there in trying to make a serious book
  out of the "Innocents Abroad," when we know well that the Mark
  Twain who wrote it was primarily a fun-maker? For ourselves, we
  confess that we have been unable to find any grave purpose in the
  "Jumping Frog of Calaveras." We recall the Hawaiian stranger whom
  Mark Twain kissed for his mother's sake before robbing him of his
  small change. We recall the horse he rode in Honolulu; it had
  many fine points, and our traveller hung his hat upon one of
  them. We recall that other horse behind which he went driving one
  Sunday with the lady of his choice; it was a milk-dealer's horse
  on week-days, and it persisted in travelling diagonally across
  the street and stopping before every gate. These adventures are
  easy to recall, but the hidden serious purpose within them
  remains hidden from us.</p>

  <p>The serious element in Mark Twain the man and the writer, it
  would, of course, be futile to deny. His hatred of sham, his
  hatred of cruelty, his hatred of oppression, appear in the
  "Innocents Abroad," as they do in his "Connecticut Yankee" and in
  his bitter assaults on the Christian Scientists and the American
  missionaries in China of the Boxer days. But to say that Mark
  Twain was a great humorist because he was an intensely serious
  man is not true, whatever truth there may be in the formula that
  humorists are humorists because they are men of sorrow. We would
  reverse the formula. We would say that humorists are often sad
  because they are humorists, and that from much laughing the
  rebound must necessarily be towards much grief. If it is commonly
  asserted that the humorist laughs because of the incongruities of
  life, it is, nevertheless, just as sale to maintain that the man
  born to laughter will be driven by his instincts to search for
  incongruities. There was no fundamental pessimism in Mark Twain.
  As Mr. Howells brings out in his chapter of reminiscences in the
  last <i>Harper's</i>, Mr. Clemens had the soul of untamed
  boyishness. He was boyish in his exuberance of manner, in his
  taste for extraordinary clothes, and in his glee at earning a
  great deal of money:</p>

  <p><font size="-1">The postals [announcing his share of the daily
  profits from the "Gilded Age"] used to come about dinner-time,
  and Clemens would read them aloud to us in wild triumph.
  $150--$200--$300, were the gay figures which they bore, and which
  he flaunted in the air before he sat down at table, or rose from
  it to brandish, and then, flinging his napkin into his chair,
  walked up and down to exult in.</font></p>

  <p>One thing there was in Mark Twain that was not apparently
  boyish or simple. Mr. Howells asserts positively that in his
  later years Twain believed neither in the Christian theology, in
  God, nor in immortality:</p>

  <p><font size="-1">All his expressions to me were of a courageous
  renunciation of any hope of living again, or elsewhere seeing
  those he had lost. He suffered terribly in their loss, and he was
  not fool enough to try ignoring his grief. He knew that for that
  there were but two medicines; that it would wear itself out with
  the years, and that meanwhile there was nothing for it but those
  respites in which the mourner forgets himself in slumber. I
  remember that in a black hour of my own when I was called down to
  see him, as he thought from sleep, he said, with an infinite, an
  exquisite compassion, "Oh, did I wake you, did I <i>wake</i>
  you?" Nothing more, but the look, the voice, were everything; and
  while I live they cannot pass from my sense.</font></p>

  <p>Here at last we have the disillusion that is said to dwell in
  the innermost soul of the great humorist. But here, too, we seem
  to feel that the gray vision of the future was with him not a
  cause, but a result. When the buoyant soul sinks back upon itself
  it is apt to feel the riddle of life very keenly indeed.</p>
