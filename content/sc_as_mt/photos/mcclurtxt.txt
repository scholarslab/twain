<center><b>PORTRAITS OF MARK TWAIN.</b></center>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; W<font size=-1>HEN</font> a few months ago, because of the failure of a 
publishing house in which he was a partner, Samuel L. Clemens ("Mark Twain") set out to 
traverse the whole width of America and the Pacific Ocean, into Australia, on a two years' 
lecturing tour, it was generally remarked as a hard necessity--at his time of life.  He 
had turned, or was just turning, sixty; and while sixty, for men of fair physical 
endowment, is by no means old, it is still an age at which most men would more than shrink 
from such an enterprise.  To Mark Twain, however, it probably seemed no very considerable 
matter, for he has been a wide journeyer all his life.  While born at Florida, Missouri (November 
30, 1835), he was reared at Hannibal, Missouri, on the banks of the Mississippi; at thirteen 
he became apprenticed to a printer, and during the next few years, in pursuit of his craft, 
he wandered to St. Louis, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and even New York.  Then he became a 
pilot on the Mississippi River.  Thus much going to and fro Mark Twain had accomplished 
while yet a youth.  In 1861 he went to Nevada; a few years later to California, and finally 
to the Sandwich Islands.  First he served as clerk to his brother, the Secretary of the 
Territory of Nevada; then he was a newspaper reporter and editor; he ventured unsuccessfully 
in mining, and not unsuccessfully in lecturing.  From the Sandwich Islands he began to work 
eastward again, and in 1867 he reached New York, and published his first book, "The Jumping 
Frog and Other Sketches," and then set out on that tour of Europe which yielded the material 
for "Innocents Abroad."<br><br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; "Innocents Abroad" was published in 1869, and since then Mark Twain's humor 
has been a wine that needed no bush.  In three years the book sold to the number of one hundred and 
twenty-five thousand copies.  Mark Twain is sometimes reputed to be a reluctant worker; he at 
least has not been an eager publisher.  Even the success of "Innocents Abroad" did not tempt 
him to press again for several years.  Then he put forth "Roughing It," and a year later, in 
conjunction with Charles Dudley Warner, "The Gilded Age."  By this time he had married, and 
"settled down" at Hartford, Connecticut.  But the settling down was nominal merely.  He became 
a professional lecturer, and travelled widely winter after winter.  Then he went often to 
Europe, making long sojourns there.  Consequently, setting off at sixty on a lecturing tour to 
Australia, was for him little more than a resumption of the habit of a life.<br><br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; It is not for the public, however, to repine when Mark Twain is forced to undertake 
a new journey; for his journeys have been largely the occasion of his books.  To the list of these 
he added, in 1876, "Adventures of Tom Sawyer"; in 1880, "A Tramp Abroad"; in 1884, "Adventures of 
Huckleberry Finn"; in 1889, "A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur"; since which have come "The 
Prince and the Pauper," "Pudd'n Head Wilson," and "Joan of Arc."  The last was first published 
anonymously, and only within a few weeks has been authentically announced as his.<br><br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; Mark Twain is one of two representatives in permanent literature of a now all but 
extinct, but in its day a most picturesque and interesting, class--the itinerant printers.  The 
"tramp" printer, who still exists in some degree, is but a degenerate and rude survival of this 
class, and gives no true impression of what the class was in its best estate.  The older race, 
with whom it was a point of honor to abide nowhere for long, were men of singular cleverness and 
ingenuity of mind.  They <i>read</i> the matter they put into type, which the printer of to-day 
seems rarely to do; and thus, and by observation on their wide travels, they became a race of 
philosophers.  They could write for the papers on which they served, as well as set type; and much 
of the wit and wisdom of the newspaper columns was of their contribution.  Most of their writing 
was for the day; but in the case of Mark Twain it developed, by slow degrees, to the quality of 
literature. And it did the same in the case of Walt Whitman.  To the strict vocation of printer, 
indeed, Mark Twain gave only a few years, and these of his youth; but his way of life, and his 
attitude toward life have ever remained in spirit those of the old roving fraternity of the "stick."<br><br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; Men of information and ideas, these old printers were; but, of course, they were 
in no sense men of the study.  And herein, again, Mark Twain is of their kind.  He is a man of 
literary cultivation, and even, it is said, in some measure a scholar; and, in writing his books, 
he sweats at his desk, and pulls his hair, after the fashion of the strict man-of-letters.  But 
for all that he is a man who lives and experiences, rather than one who conceives and records; 
and all accounts agree that he is even better entertainment in private life than on the platform 
or in his books.  Either where, however, he is so good--so free and gracious and wholesome--that 
one may hope he will live until the series of his portraits has become twice as long as the by 
no means meagre one presented here.<br><br>
