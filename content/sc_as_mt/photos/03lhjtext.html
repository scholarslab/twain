          <b>MARK TWAIN'S PICTURES</b>
        </center>

        <p>&#x00A0; &#x00A0; With regard to two of the photographs of
        Mark Twain, on pages 36 and 37 of this issue, a word of
        explanation is given here for which proper space could not
        be found in connection with the photographs.</p>

        <p>&#x00A0; &#x00A0; THE CAT IN MARK TWAIN'S LAP in one of the
        pictures is apparently a wonderful animal. Mark Twain says:
        "It is a porcelain cat, from a work by a great French
        sculptor, and is perhaps the only hand-made cat in
        existence that is perfect in form, in attitude, and carries
        in its face and eyes the right and true charm and
        spirituality of its race. This is the most satisfactory
        work-room cat I have ever had, because it does not fuss
        with the manuscripts nor try to help do the writing."</p>

        <p>&#x00A0; &#x00A0; THE COLORED MAN in another picture is John
        T. Lewis, "a friend of mine," says Mark Twain, "these many
        years--thirty-four, in fact. He was my father-in-law's
        coachman forty years ago; was many years farmer of Quarry
        Farm, and is still a neighbor. I have not known an honester
        man nor a more respect-worthy one. Twenty-seven years ago,
        by the prompt and intelligent exercise of his courage,
        presence of mind and extraordinary strength, he saved the
        lives of relatives of mine whom a runaway horse was
        hurrying to destruction. Naturally I hold him in high and
        grateful regard."</p><font size="-1"><b><i>The Ladies' Home
