<center><b>MARK TWAIN'S PICTURES</b></center>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; With regard to two of the photographs of Mark Twain, on pages 36 and 37 of this issue, 
a word of explanation is given here for which proper space could not be found in connection with the 
photographs.</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; THE CAT IN MARK TWAIN'S LAP in one of the pictures is apparently a wonderful animal.  Mark 
Twain says: "It is a porcelain cat, from a work by a great French sculptor, and is perhaps the only hand-
made cat in existence that is perfect in form, in attitude, and carries in its face and eyes the right 
and true charm and spirituality of its race.  This is the most satisfactory work-room cat I have ever had, 
because it does not fuss with the manuscripts nor try to help do the writing."</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; THE COLORED MAN in another picture is John T. Lewis, "a friend of mine," says Mark Twain, 
"these many years--thirty-four, in fact.  He was my father-in-law's coachman forty years ago; was many 
years farmer of Quarry Farm, and is still a neighbor.  I have not known an honester man nor a more respect-
worthy one.  Twenty-seven years ago, by the prompt and intelligent exercise of his courage, presence of 
mind and extraordinary strength, he saved the lives of relatives of mine whom a runaway horse was hurrying 
to destruction.  Naturally I hold him in high and grateful regard."</p>
