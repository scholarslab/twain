          <b>PORTRAITS OF MARK TWAIN.</b>
        </center><br />
        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; W<font size="-1">HEN</font> a few months ago,
        because of the failure of a publishing house in which he
        was a partner, Samuel L. Clemens ("Mark Twain") set out to
        traverse the whole width of America and the Pacific Ocean,
        into Australia, on a two years' lecturing tour, it was
        generally remarked as a hard necessity--at his time of
        life. He had turned, or was just turning, sixty; and while
        sixty, for men of fair physical endowment, is by no means
        old, it is still an age at which most men would more than
        shrink from such an enterprise. To Mark Twain, however, it
        probably seemed no very considerable matter, for he has
        been a wide journeyer all his life. While born at Florida,
        Missouri (November 30, 1835), he was reared at Hannibal,
        Missouri, on the banks of the Mississippi; at thirteen he
        became apprenticed to a printer, and during the next few
        years, in pursuit of his craft, he wandered to St. Louis,
        Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and even New York. Then he became
        a pilot on the Mississippi River. Thus much going to and
        fro Mark Twain had accomplished while yet a youth. In 1861
        he went to Nevada; a few years later to California, and
        finally to the Sandwich Islands. First he served as clerk
        to his brother, the Secretary of the Territory of Nevada;
        then he was a newspaper reporter and editor; he ventured
        unsuccessfully in mining, and not unsuccessfully in
        lecturing. From the Sandwich Islands he began to work
        eastward again, and in 1867 he reached New York, and
        published his first book, "The Jumping Frog and Other
        Sketches," and then set out on that tour of Europe which
        yielded the material for "Innocents Abroad."<br />
        <br />
        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; "Innocents Abroad" was published in 1869, and
        since then Mark Twain's humor has been a wine that needed
        no bush. In three years the book sold to the number of one
        hundred and twenty-five thousand copies. Mark Twain is
        sometimes reputed to be a reluctant worker; he at least has
        not been an eager publisher. Even the success of "Innocents
        Abroad" did not tempt him to press again for several years.
        Then he put forth "Roughing It," and a year later, in
        conjunction with Charles Dudley Warner, "The Gilded Age."
        By this time he had married, and "settled down" at
        Hartford, Connecticut. But the settling down was nominal
        merely. He became a professional lecturer, and travelled
        widely winter after winter. Then he went often to Europe,
        making long sojourns there. Consequently, setting off at
        sixty on a lecturing tour to Australia, was for him little
        more than a resumption of the habit of a life.<br />
        <br />
        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; It is not for the public, however, to repine
        when Mark Twain is forced to undertake a new journey; for
        his journeys have been largely the occasion of his books.
        To the list of these he added, in 1876, "Adventures of Tom
        Sawyer"; in 1880, "A Tramp Abroad"; in 1884, "Adventures of
        Huckleberry Finn"; in 1889, "A Yankee at the Court of King
        Arthur"; since which have come "The Prince and the Pauper,"
        "Pudd'n Head Wilson," and "Joan of Arc." The last was first
        published anonymously, and only within a few weeks has been
        authentically announced as his.<br />
        <br />
        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Mark Twain is one of two representatives in
        permanent literature of a now all but extinct, but in its
        day a most picturesque and interesting, class--the
        itinerant printers. The "tramp" printer, who still exists
        in some degree, is but a degenerate and rude survival of
        this class, and gives no true impression of what the class
        was in its best estate. The older race, with whom it was a
        point of honor to abide nowhere for long, were men of
        singular cleverness and ingenuity of mind. They <i>read</i>
        the matter they put into type, which the printer of to-day
        seems rarely to do; and thus, and by observation on their
        wide travels, they became a race of philosophers. They
        could write for the papers on which they served, as well as
        set type; and much of the wit and wisdom of the newspaper
        columns was of their contribution. Most of their writing
        was for the day; but in the case of Mark Twain it
        developed, by slow degrees, to the quality of literature.
        And it did the same in the case of Walt Whitman. To the
        strict vocation of printer, indeed, Mark Twain gave only a
        few years, and these of his youth; but his way of life, and
        his attitude toward life have ever remained in spirit those
        of the old roving fraternity of the "stick."<br />
        <br />
        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Men of information and ideas, these old
        printers were; but, of course, they were in no sense men of
        the study. And herein, again, Mark Twain is of their kind.
        He is a man of literary cultivation, and even, it is said,
        in some measure a scholar; and, in writing his books, he
        sweats at his desk, and pulls his hair, after the fashion
        of the strict man-of-letters. But for all that he is a man
        who lives and experiences, rather than one who conceives
        and records; and all accounts agree that he is even better
        entertainment in private life than on the platform or in
        his books. Either where, however, he is so good--so free
        and gracious and wholesome--that one may hope he will live
        until the series of his portraits has become twice as long
        as the by no means meagre one presented here.<br />
