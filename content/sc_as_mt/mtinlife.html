<p>In his time MT's words were widely quoted, especially his
  one-liners and comic aphorisms. (This is still true today, of
  course. I'm writing this on March 1, 1996. Yesterday evening
  National Public Radio's "All Things Considered" gave Mark Twain
  the last words on whether people in public life should refer to
  themselves in the third-person: "No man should [do that] unless
  he is the King of England -- or has a tapeworm.")</p> 

<p>MT's image was widely "quoted" too. By the middle of his
  career his figure was becoming a favorite icon for newspaper and
  magazine cartoonists. No one has yet assembled a "complete
  cartoons of MT," but with the help of Louis J. Budd's <i>Our Mark
  Twain</i>, here is a sampling of his images from <i>Life</i>
  magazine between 1883 and 1907.</p>

  <p><i>Life</i> was bought by Henry Luce in the 1930s, and completely
  remade as the pictorial magazine that is still published. But
  from its founding in 1883 by a group of young men from Harvard
  through the 1920s, <i>Life</i> was a humorous magazine modeled
  after the English <i>Puck</i>. According to Luther Mott, it was
  "not a comic paper, but a gently satirical observer." <i>Life</i>
  panned <i>Huck Finn</i> for its coarseness on <a href=
  "../huckfinn/life1.html">February 26, 1885</a>, and on <a href=
  "http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/twain/life2.html">April 9</a>
  praised the Concord Library for banning the novel from its
  shelves, which may explain the lack of images in the late 1880s.
  But beginning in 1890 the magazine turned more and more often to
  the idea of "Mark Twain." MT never published in its pages, but we
  know he read it, because it was in 1884 issues of <i>Life</i>
  that he noticed the work of Edward Kemble, whom he hired to
  illustrate <i>Huck Finn</i>. None of the drawings below are by
  Kemble. Instead they were by many different artists, and together
  indicate the many faces of the face of MT.</p>

        John L. Sullivan held the world heavyweight boxing<br />

        School of Philosophy." Its existence was mentioned<br />

        the Concord Library banned <i>Huck Finn</i> in

        MT is advertised here as one of "Our<br />
        Over-Advertised Authors." Among the other writers<br />
        in that category are (from the left) Howells, George<br />
        Washington Cable, James Whitcomb Riley, Mary E.<br />
        Wilkins [Freeman], H. Rider Haggard, Frances Hodgson<br />
        Burnett, and Joel Chandler Harris.<br clear="left" />

        This surprisingly prim MT is participating in<br />
        "Taking a 'Turn'; or, The Literary Cakewalk."<br />
        His partner is Rev. Hepworth. The line is led by<br />
        Howells and Frank Stockton; other dancers include<br />

        This full-page image -- more tribute than<br />
        caricature -- is atypically big, but the prose<br />
        that accompanies it is characteristic of the<br />
        affection that comes increasingly to control<br />
        America's idea of "Mark Twain."<br clear="left" />

        Here "MT" appears as "The American Humorist" in<br />
        <i>Life</i>'s monthly feature, "Popular Pets." (Others in
        the<br />
        series include Jack Hob and Robert Ingersoll.)<br />
        By this time MT's mane has become a frequently<br />
        "quoted" aspect of his character. As the magazine<br />
        put it in a later issue: MT's "principal recreation<br />
        is not parting his hair."<br clear="left" />

        Here is "St. Mark," the "American Lion." The<br />
        reference is undoubtedly to MT's essay,<br />
        "To the Person Sitting in Darkness": his attack on<br />
        imperialism that had just appeared in the<br />
        February <i>North American Review</i>.<br clear="left" />

        The suggestion of MT's brave American nobility here,<br />
        though referenced to his novel about Hank Morgan,<br />
        is obviously not meant sarcastically, or even<br />
        comically. I'm not sure, however, what prompted it<br />
        at this time. In October MT and his family had<br />
        sailed for Italy, but they did not stop in
        England.<br clear="left" />

        MT's 70th birthday, included in this issue of
        <i>Life</i><br />
        among December events, had taken place on<br />
        November 30. It was widely celebrated in<br />
        the press, and this was not the only graphic<br />
        tribute to the occasion that featured cigars<br />
        as a crucial part of MT's image.<br clear="left" />

        MT here is included among "Things We See Advertised,"<br />
        along with Howells, "Mr. Dooley" (Finley Peter Dunne)<br />
        and "G.A." The advertising <i>Life</i> had seen for MT
        was<br />
        perhaps connected with the installments of his<br />
        autobiography that were to begin in <i>The North<br />

        This lovingly drawn caricature, which now includes<br />
        the white suit MT had begun wearing that winter,<br />
        suggests how <i>Life</i> had come to see him. The<br />

        Readers probably knew without reading the caption<br />
        whose coat of arms this was. The cigars,<br />
        the white suit, the steamboat wheel, the lifestory<br />
        that went on and on without even beginning<br />
        to bore anyone -- all added up to MT.<br clear="left" />

        MT was awarded an honorary Litt.D. degree by Oxford<br />
        in June, 1907. This event was also widely<br />
        (and favorably, even delightedly) reported in the
        press.<br />
        Here the great honor is also a kind of joke<br />
        that <i>Life</i> and its readers can enjoy with<br />
        the humorist. (In the November 28 issue, the magazine<br />
        depicted MT in his Oxford gown in a display titled<br />
        "For These Things We Are Grateful.")</td>
