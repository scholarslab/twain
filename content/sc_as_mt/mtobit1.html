    <h3>Mark Twain</h3>
  </center>It will be many a day before the people of the United
  States forget Mark Twain, the man. Since far back in the 70's he
  had been one of our national celebrities, and perhaps the
  greatest of the clan, beaming, expansive and kindly: a star at
  all great public feasts; the friend of Presidents and
  millionaires, of archbishops and actors, welcome everywhere and
  always in good humor, a fellow of infinite jest. As the years
  passed his picturesque figure grew more and more familiar and
  lovable. Every town of any pretensions knew him. He was in
  ceaseless motion, making a speech here, taking a degree there,
  and always dripping fun. The news that he was to be present was
  enough to make a success of anything, from a bacchanal of trust
  magnates to a convocation of philologists.

  <p>So much for the Mark Twain of banquet hall and popular fancy.
  He will recede slowly, but recede he must, for there is something
  pitifully insubstantial about fame of that sort. The new
  generation will have its own philosophers and its own comedians,
  and their pressing reality will make poor Mark's white dress
  suit, his chrysanthemum of white hair and his eternal cigar grow
  faint and wavering. Oldsters will chuckle and wag their heads
  when they think of him, but as a living figure he will sink into
  the past. In that human certainty, however, there is no need for
  mourning, for there remains the Mark Twain of literature, in
  stature vastly above the post-prandial wit--a Mark Twain whose
  place among the immortals is generally conceded--a Mark Twain
  whose life work as satirist, humorist and philosopher is measured
  in the estimation of many critics by that of Cervantes, Thackeray
  and Fielding, Aristophanes and Moli&egrave;re.</p>

  <p>There is great temptation, of course, to overestimate a man in
  the presence of his death, but here, we believe, there is no such
  extravagance. More than 15 years ago the true rank of Samuel
  Langhorne Clemens began to impress itself upon the more
  discerning of his contemporaries. It was the late Sir Walter
  Besant who first made earnest and effective protest against the
  popular tendency to regard him as a funny man, and as a funny man
  only. To show the absurdity of this error, Sir Walter entered
  upon an elaborate analysis of "Huckleberry Finn," as one who
  might claim expert knowledge of the literary craft and its
  problems, pointing out its marvelously accurate
  characterizations, its vivid picture of a civilization, its
  Homeric sweep and throb. Here, said Sir Walter, was a literary
  feat of the first magnitude, for a grown man had entered into the
  soul of a boy and looked at the world through that boy's eyes.
  The result, he thought, was the greatest novel ever written by an
  American, if not the greatest ever written in English.</p>

  <p>Enthusiasm seemed to color this revolutionary judgment, but it
  won unexpected support and in unexpected places. The English
  critics, strangely enough, were the first to say aye with hearty
  good will. While we were still roaring over "The Jumping Frog,"
  as over some masterpiece of empty clowning, they were comparing
  "A Connecticut Yankee" to "Don Quixote" and "Gulliver's Travels,"
  and setting up "A Tramp Abroad" as unique and incomparable. The
  Germans followed the English and the French came after, and then
  at last we Americans began to realize that a truly great man was
  among us--a man who would be remembered when some of our
  Presidents were forgotten. In 1891, when Yale University made Mr.
  Clemens a doctor of letters, this turn of the tide was publicly
  marked. He lost, after that, nothing of his popular vogue, but he
  began to gain the less noisy but more lasting fame of an artist
  of world rank. Honors came thick and fast, and in 1907, when he
  was called to Oxford to receive the doctorate of that ancient
  university, England received him with almost royal pomp.</p>

  <p>The Mark Twain of the last phase was little more than a shadow
  of the Mark Twain who wrote "Huckleberry Finn." There was still
  abundant foolery in him, but his old Rabelaisian joy in the human
  comedy seemed to be gone. He no longer got beneath the surface;
  he was no longer the universal satirist, dealing with broad types
  and touching the heart as well as the midriff. He was old, and
  maybe a bit weary. But the world will not take account of these
  weak echoes of his former self when it comes to reckon his worth,
  any more than it considers "Lovell the Widower" when it judges
  Thackeray. He must be estimated by his best, as Cervantes and the
  others are estimated. And that best will give delight so long as
  the English of today remains a living tongue.</p>

  <p>Let us take leave of him here. The time is not one for
  elaborate essays. He had the great human qualities. Reading him,
  one came to love him, as one loves Chaucer, Fielding and Ben
  Jonson. For all his war upon shams and frauds, there was a vast
  benevolence in him, a genial tolerance, a deep human note. Truly
  a great man has gone from among us.</p>
