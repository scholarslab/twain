    <font size="+1">Mark Twain.</font>
  </center>

  <p>The death of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, known throughout the
  enlightened world as Mark Twain, removes a noble figure, and an
  influence of great value, from the literary circles of America.
  It has been common in this country and abroad to speak of Mark
  Twain as "the American humorist": the apparent exclusiveness of
  the title is not wholly unjustified, for he came nearer realizing
  the nobility and dignity of the American conception of humor, and
  possessed a keener appreciation of the humorous possibilities
  inhering in American types of character than any other writer in
  the history of the republic.</p>

  <p>Because of the grace and inoffensiveness which marked his
  delineative work, his writings possess an enduring quality, and
  they will long be read with increasing interest, pleasure and
  profit.</p>

  <p>Humor of the emphatic sort is a thing of changing quality.
  Consider, for instance, the grotesqueness of the stage and the
  caricatures of current prints. Men today laugh at that which
  would have offended the men of yesterday, and it is equally
  certain that the things which amuse the men of today will no
  longer amuse the men of tomorrow.</p>

  <p>Mark Twain, with easy and insideous grace, wrote to the smile,
  and if occasionally convulsive laughter marked the pleasant
  pilgrimage of the reader, it was probably because the reader's
  nature was rich and full to overflowing with light and cheery
  qualities of heart and mind, rather than because of any effort on
  the author's part to distort, and exaggerate beyond human
  semblance, the figures he struck from the fancies of the moment;
  for behind Mark Twain's portraitures, somewhere in the sphere of
  his ample experience and studious observation, real pulsing,
  moving characters could be found to match them, as faithfully, in
  most instances, as Hamlet's mouse trap scene matched players and
  principals in the act which lays bare the brewing villainies of
  the court.</p>

  <p>Mark Twain contributed much to the sum of human contentment,
  and while he moved and toiled in a sphere totally different from
  that which Emerson and Lowell, and Longfellow and Holmes and
  Whitman adorned, he has not contributed less enduringly to the
  prestige and brilliance of American literature.</p>
