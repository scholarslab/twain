    <h3>Chief of American Men of Letters</h3>
  </center>MARK TWAIN IS DEAD.

  <p>It would be hard to frame four other words that could carry a
  message of personal bereavement to so many Americans.</p>

  <p>He was easily the chief of our writers, by the only valid
  test. He could touch the emotional centre of more lives than any
  other.</p>

  <p>He was curiously and intimately American. No other author has
  such a tang of the soil--such a flavor of the average national
  mind.</p>

  <p>Europeans who complain that we denied Walt Whitman,
  misunderstood Emerson and have admired only those who write in
  old world fashions should be satisfied at least with Mark Twain,
  and with our unwavering taste for him.</p>

  <p>He was our very own, and we gathered him to our hearts.</p>

  <p>In ages to come, if historians and archaeologists would know
  the thoughts, the temper, the characteristic psychology of the
  American of the latter half of the nineteenth century, he will
  need only to read "Innocents Abroad," "Tom Sawyer," and
  "Huckleberry Finn."</p>

  <p>Mr. Clemens's books were the transcripts of his life. And that
  life was the kind of life that the average American man of his
  time has believed in and admired.</p>

  <p>He was the man that rose from the ranks without envy or
  condescension.</p>

  <p>The man that hated dogmas and philosophies and loved a flash
  of intellectual light.</p>

  <p>He was the man that cared much to get rich, yet would sweat
  blood to pay his debts.</p>

  <p>The man of boundless optimism, who has never troubled to
  understand the great tragedies of nations.</p>

  <p>The deepening sense of the twentieth century--with its feeling
  that there are social problems that cannot be resolved by
  pleasantries--has somehow left our dear prophet, with all his
  delicate and tender ironies and his merry quips, a little in the
  rear.</p>

  <p>Mark Twain was never fortunate in his polemics. He was not
  effective as the champion of a cause. What he wrote of the Congo
  was hardly more creditable or convincing than his crusade against
  Mrs. Eddy.</p>

  <p>He had no natural acerbity, and consequently no real talent
  for satire.</p>

  <p>His genius was full of bravery and brightness and the joy of
  life.</p>

  <p>And in the strength of his serene and laughing spirit
  generations of Americans will go forth to do deeds that he
  himself could never have conceived.</p>
