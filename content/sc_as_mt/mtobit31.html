    <font size="+1">MARK TWAIN, HUMANITARIAN.</font>
  </center>

  <p>Mark Twain is dead, and the world will mourn him. With a style
  which made free use of colloquialism, which depended for effect
  largely upon American points of view, naturally incomprehensible
  to other peoples, he yet combined the spirit of humor, which is
  the gift of the heart, in a vehicle of charity making universal
  appeal.</p>

  <p>There was and can be but one Mark Twain. He was of that select
  company which could bear the designation "unique." He made his
  own art out of his own personality. He left no "school," because
  what he was, he grew. Despite his later artistry and workmanship,
  it may be said truthfully that he acquired little. He was what he
  was because he was born so. He was a gift to humanity, for which
  all peoples are the better.</p>

  <p>We do not think that there is any room for "criticism" of
  Twain and his works. He made his own standards, and exerted his
  own appeal. He was found good and wholesome and uplifting. In all
  his frolicsome humor, underlying all his fantasies, there was a
  strain of philosophy, a hint of satire, and a suggestion of faith
  that made for the discerning both sermon and poem. More than any
  other writer he was the apostle of the good in that of everyday,
  of the need in the midst of misery to smile, and of the capacity
  in misfortune to discover a laugh. He has left behind him a tonic
  without depression, the record of a brave heart and an
  individuality innate with love.</p>

  <p>How many of us feel that we know Mark Twain! That what he
  wrote was written for us, with the intimate frankness of a friend
  talking over a cigar! In some way his work leaves that impression
  of confidence possible only to the tete a tete. It is this fact
  that makes his life of struggle, of heartache and sorrow, all the
  more pitiful because through it all he preserved his gift of
  friendship for the world, and poured out, ever fresh, the
  goodness of a heart that nothing could embitter.</p>

  <p>It is more than a humorist who has passed. The world is poorer
  for the loss of one of its humanities.</p>
