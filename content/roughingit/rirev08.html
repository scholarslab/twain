        <p>In <i>Roughing It</i> and its sequel, <i>The Innocents
        at Home</i>, Mr. Clemens describes his adventures and
        experiences in the Far West of America, as private
        secretary to a Government official, as a silver miner, and
        as a "city" editor and reporter, during the period
        embracing "the rise, growth, and culmination of the
        silver-mining fever is Nevada--a curious episode in some
        aspects; the only one, of its peculiar kind, that has
        occured in the land, and the only one, indeed, that is
        likely to occur in it." These volumes are narratives of
        fact, written in a stlye bordering on the burlesque. The
        information they contain is valuable and rare, relating, as
        it does, to "an interesting episode in the history of the
        Far West, about which no books have been written by persons
        who were on the ground in person." But "Mark Twain" does
        not serve up his information in its raw, natural form. We
        need hardly say he is not a grave biographer. He passed
        through a most exciting career in Nevada and California,
        encountering prosperity and misfortune in a spirit somewhat
        similar to that displayed by Mark Tapley, and he tells his
        story with the same eccentric geniality. His humour is not
        of a very delicate or profound order, but he enjoys it so
        keenly himself that it is impossible to resist the
        contagion. This humour is, moreover, evidently the natural
        outgrowth of the unsettled, adventurous, wild life he has
        led. All the characters introduced in these books are more
        or less humorous, and their humour has a family likeness
        about it that is unmistakable. It is the humour of men that
        have been accustomed to violent reversals of fortune, whose
        existence is one long, desperate game, in which great
        prizes may be at any moment won, and who are ready to
        undergo any amount of hardship, while there remains a
        chance or a hope of securing one of them. It is the humour
        of strong, daring, adventurous spirits, animated by wild,
        irregular passions, which may unfit them for settled life,
        but are among the very qualities required for
        semi-civilized regions, such as those that form the scene
        of Mr. Clemens's two books and of Mr. Eggleston's
        <i>Hoosier Schoolmaster</i>.</p>

        <p><i>Roughing It</i> is, in some respects, superior to
        <i>The Innocents at Home</i>. It is more consecutive and
        less fragmentary, but both are almost equally racy and
        entertaining. The account of the journey from St. Louis to
        Carson City--including a graphic sketch of the life and
        character of a desperado, named Slade, who long held Rocky
        Ridge in terror, and some interesting researches in the
        Mormon Bible--occupy about one-half of <i>Roughing It</i>.
        Like the rest of the volume and its sequel, this part
        abounds in striking incidents, but we must pass these over,
        and come to the idyllic chapter where the author describes
        the attempt he and a companion made to settle on the shores
        of Lake Tahoe. Here is a passage recounting how the two
        solitary pioneers spent their day, after they had built a
        "brush" house, which was not intended for sleeping in.
        "That never occured to us for one thing; and besides, it
        was built to hold the ground, and that was enough. We did
        not wish to <a name="h" id="h">strain it."</a></p>

          We slept in the sand close to the water's edge, between
          two protecting boulders, which took care of the stormy
          night-winds for us. We never took any paregoric to make
          us sleep. At the first break of dawn we were always up
          and running foot-races to tone down excess of physical
          vigor and exuberance of spirits. That is, Johnny was--but
          I held his hat. While smoking the pipe of peace after
          breakfast we watched the sentinel peaks put on the glory
          of the sun, and followed the conquering light as it swept
          down among the shadows, and set the captive crags and
          forests free. We watched the tinted pictures grow and
          brighten upon the water till every little detail of
          forest, precipice and pinnacle was wrought in and
          finished, and the miracle of the enchanter complete. Then
          to "business."
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          That is, drifting around in the boat. We were on the
          north shore. There, the rocks on the bottom are sometimes
          gray, sometimes white. This gives the marvelous
          transparency of the water a fuller advantage than it has
          elsewhere on the lake. We usually pushed out a hundred
          yards or so from shore, and then lay down on the thwarts,
          in the sun, and let the boat drift by the hour whither it
          would. We seldom talked. It interrupted the Sabbath
          stillness, and marred the dreams the luxurious rest and
          indolence brought. The shore all along was indented with
          deep, curved bays and coves, bordered by narrow
          sand-beaches; and where the sand ended, the steep
          mountain-sides rose right up aloft into space--rose up
          like a vast wall a little out of the perpendicular, and
          thickly wooded with tall pines.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          So singularly clear was the water, that where it was only
          twenty or thirty feet deep the bottom was so perfectly
          distinct that the boat seemed floating in the air! Yes,
          where it was even <i>eighty</i> feet deep. Every little
          pebble was distinct, every speckled trout, every
          hand's-breadth of sand. Often, as we lay on our faces, a
          granite boulder, as large as a village church, would
          start out of the bottom apparently, and seem climbing up
          rapidly to the surface, till presently it threatened to
          touch our faces, and we could not resist the impulse to
          seize an oar and avert the danger. But the boat would
          float on, and the boulder descend again, and then we
          could see that when we had been exactly above it, it must
          still have been twenty or thirty feet below the surface.
          Down through the transparency of these great depths, the
          water was not <i>merely</i> transparent, but dazzlingly,
          brilliantly so. All objects seen through it had a bright,
          strong vividness, not only of outline, but of every
          minute detail, which they would not have had when seen
          simply through the same depth of atmosphere. So empty and
          airy did all spaces seem below us, and so strong was the
          sense of floating high aloft in mid-nothingness, that we
          called these boat-excursions "balloon-voyages."
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          We fished a good deal, but we did not average one fish a
          week. We could see trout by the thousand winging about in
          the emptiness under us, or sleeping in shoals on the
          bottom, but they would not bite--they could see the line
          too plainly, perhaps.
        </blockquote>

        <p>This Paradisaic life was but of short duration. The
        timber ranch took fire, and kindled a conflagration that
        embraced the forest and drove the campers to their boat.
        Hunger at last forced them from their happy spot, and our
        author entered upon a very different sort of experience.
        The difficulties attending the organisation of a new State
        are cleverly recounted in Mr. Clemens's account of his
        brother's troubles as first Secretary of the Nevada
        Territory--"an office of such majesty that it concentrated
        in itself the duties and dignities of Treasurer,
        Comptroller, Secretary of State, and Acting-Governor in the
        Governor's absence." It was shortly after the discovery of
        silver lodes in Carson County, in 1858, that this important
        official arrived in Carson City to establish a legitimately
        constituted government in the Territory, which already
        contained from twelve to fifteen thousand of a population
        and was rapidly growing every day, the mines being
        vigorously developed, and business of all kinds active and
        prosperous.</p>
