        <p>Mark Twain's <i>Roughing It</i> suggests the query, If
        it be no easy matter to invent one good joke, how hard must
        it be to be funny to the extent of nearly six hundred
        octavo pages? Mr. Clemens has essayed the difficult task,
        and if his humor sometimes seems far-fetched or weak, must
        be admitted to have succeeded on the whole better than
        ninety-nine men out of one hundred would have done. We
        would not have it understood that the volume is a mere jest
        book, for it is a recital of its author's experience in the
        remote West. The facetious element, however, bears about
        the same relation to the veracious narrative as the pattern
        on a calico dress to the ground color. Mark's adventures in
        Nevada, among the Mormons in Utah, in California, and in
        the Sandwich Islands are related with a liveliness, and, we
        must add, with more than occasional imaginativeness
        peculiar to himself. One may not always approve the taste
        of what is said, yet he can rarely record his dissent
        without a smile. The many illustrations are not the least
        amusing feature of the book.</p>
