      Buffalo <i>Express</i><br />
      8 January 1870</b></font><br />
      <br />
      I was personally acquainted with the several nabobs mentioned
      in this letter, and so for old acquaintance sake, I have
      swapped their occupations and experiences around in such a
      way as to keep the Pacific public from recognizing these once
      notorious men. I have no desire to drag them out of their
      retirement and make them uncomfortable by exhibiting them
      without mask or disguise -- I merely wish to use their
      fortunes and misfortunes for a moment for the adornment of
      this newspaper article.</td>

      I was personally acquainted with the majority of the nabobs I
      have referred to, and so, for old acquaintance sake, I have
      shifted their occupations and experiences around in such a
      way as to keep the Pacific public from recognizing these once
      notorious men. No longer notorious, for the majority of them
      have drifted back into poverty and obscurity again.</td>
