        <br />

        <p>Nothing whatever is known about this place--its story is
        a secret that will never be revealed. The oldest natives
        make no pretense of being possessed of its history. They
        say these bones were here when they were children. They
        were here when their grandfathers were children--but how
        they came here, they can only conjecture. Many people
        believe this spot to be an ancient battleground, and it is
        usual to call it so; and they believe that these skeletons
        have lain for ages just where their proprietors fell in the
        great fight. Other people believe that Kamehameha I fought
        his first battle here. On this point, I have heard a story,
        which may have been taken from one of the numerous books
        which have been written, concerning these islands--I do not
        know where the narrator got it. He said that when
        Kamehameha (who was at first merely a subordinate chief on
        the island of Hawaii), landed here, he brought a large army
        with him, and encamped at Waikiki. The Oahuans marched
        against him, and so confident were they of success that
        they readily acceded to a demand of their priests that they
        should draw a line where these bones now lie, and take an
        oath that, if forced to retreat at all, they would never
        retreat beyond this boundary. The priests told them that
        death and everlasting punishment would overtake any who
        violated the oath, and the march was resumed. Kamehameha
        drove them back step by step; the priests fought in the
        front rank and exhorted them both by voice and inspiring
        example to remember their oath--to die, if need be, but
        never cross the fatal line. The struggle was manfully
        maintained, but at last the chief priest fell, pierced to
        the heart with a spear, and the unlucky omen fell like a
        blight upon the brave souls at his back; with a triumphant
        shout the invaders pressed forward--the line was
        crossed--the offended gods deserted the despairing army,
        and, accepting the doom their perjury had brought upon
        them, they broke and fled over the plain where Honolulu
        stands now--up the beautiful Nuuanu Valley--paused a
        moment, hemmed in by precipitous mountains on either hand
        and the frightful precipice of the Pari (pronounced
        <i>Pally</i>; intelligent natives claim that there is no r
        in the Kanaka alphabet) in front, and then were driven
        over--a sheer plunge of six hundred feet!</p>

        <p>The story is pretty enough, but Mr. Jarves' excellent
        history says the Oahuans were entrenched in Nuuanu Valley;
        that Kamehameha ousted them, routed them, pursued them up
        the valley and drove them over the precipice. He makes no
        mention of our bone yard at all in his book.</p>
