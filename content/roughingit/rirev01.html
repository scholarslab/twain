        <p>. . . These two works [<i>Roughing It</i> and
        Eggleston's <i>Hoosier Schoolmaster</i>] have been issued
        by Messrs. Routledge as part of a series of American
        Humorists. We have coupled them because they both depict,
        though in a very different style and manner, phases of
        American frontier life. The main portion of <i>Roughing
        It</i> is an account of the author's experiences among the
        silver miners in Nevada, and very rough both the
        experiences and the miners seem to have been, though of
        course a certain allowance must be made for exaggeration.
        The life and the people are much the same as those that
        form the subject of Bret Harte's tales; but whereas he has
        shown a poetical and imaginative spirit, has represented
        inner life and character, and shown how the tender flower
        of sentiment or emotion may be found to spring among the
        rude and unlovely surroundings of a diggers' camp, our
        author has contented himself with dwelling on the outside
        of things and simply describing manners and customs.</p>

        <p>The frenzied lust for gain and universal spirit of
        gambling that seizes on a population on the discovery of
        the existence of precious metals in their soil has before
        now been depicted in literature. Most people probably have
        read Mr. Charles Reade's description of the Australian
        goldfields in <i>Never too Late to Mend</i>, and,
        <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, it would hold equally good for
        California or the diamond miners of the Cape. There is
        little that is local about the picture, the phenomena
        exhibited are unfortunately common to all times and places.
        However, our author gives a lovely account of the
        vicissitudes and perils of a miner's life, and of the
        strange and weird scenery of the Nevada territory, and
        there is always a certain fascination in the record of
        experiences so remote from our own. Illustrating the
        credulity which always seems to be engendered by any form
        of gambling, whether it is rouge et noir, stock jobbing, or
        silver mining, he tells a story of a certain gold mine of
        fabulous wealth supposed to exist among the mountains. One
        man alone believed himself to possess the secret, which had
        been communicated to him by the original discoverer, and
        was always vainly endeavoring to find the locality. Just as
        he hunted for the mine, so the population hunted him, till
        he was compelled to go <a name="a" id="a">about in</a>
        secret:--</p>

          Every now and then it would be reported that Mr. W. had
          passed stealthily through Esmeralda at dead of night, in
          disguise, and then we would have a wild
          excitement--because he must be steering for his secret
          mine, and now was the time to follow him. In less than
          three hours after daylight all the horses and mules and
          donkeys in the vicinity would be bought, hired or stolen,
          and half the community would be off for the mountains,
          following in the wake of Whiteman. But W. would drift
          about through the mountain gorges for days together, in a
          purposeless sort of way, until the provisions of the
          miners ran out, and they would have to go back home.
        </blockquote>

        <p>A large part of <i>Roughing It</i> is devoted to the
        account of the journey by the already obsolete overland
        coach. And here our author treads on much the same ground
        as Artemus Ward in <i>Among the Mormons</i>, though his
        experiences were of a somewhat different character. He does
        not shine in comparison, as his humour, such as it is, is
        immeasurably inferior, though of the same school, depending
        on ludicrous exaggeration and quaint unexpectedness of
        comparison. Artemus amused us by his genuine fun and
        originality; but if there is one thing more than another
        that is spoilt by mannerism it is humour, and if the
        mannerism of an individual is offensive, the mannerism of a
        school is insufferable. Mark Twain, too, often falls into
        the slang of transatlantic journalism, and displays also
        its characteristic inability to distinguish between the
        picturesque and the grotesque.</p>
