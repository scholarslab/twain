        One of California's curiosities the people in the States
        will some day become familiar with through the Pacific
        Railroad. I mean the Chinamen. California contains 70,000
        of them, and every ship brings more. There is a Chinese
        quarter in every city and village in California and Nevada,
        for Boards of Aldermen will not allow them to live all
        around town just wherever they choose to locate. This is
        not a hardship, for they prefer to herd together.<br />
        <br />

        <center>
          <i>Peculiarities and Superstitions</i>
        </center><br />
        They are a people who fondly stick to their ancient
        customs. They dress in the quaint costumes their ancestors
        wore 500 years ago. They build temples, gaudy with gilding
        and hideous with staring idols, and there they worship
        after the fashion of their fathers. A strict record is kept
        by their chiefs of the name and residence of every
        Chinaman, and when he dies his body is sent back to China
        for burial -- for they can never get to their Heaven unless
        they start from China. And besides, Chinamen worship their
        ancestors, and they all want their share of worship after
        they are done with this world. Even when the Chinese
        government sells a shipload of degraded and criminal
        coolies to a Cuban or Sandwich Island planter, it is
        strictly stipulated that the body of every one of them must
        be sent back to China after death.<br />
        <br />
        The Chinamen being smart, shrewd people, take to some few
        of our commercial customs and virtues, but somehow we can't
        make great headway in the matter of civilizing them. We can
        teach them to gamble a little, but somehow we can't make
        them get drunk. It is discouraging -- because you can't
        regenerate a being that won't get drunk.<br />
        <br />
        The Chinaman is the most frugal, industrious and thrifty of
        all creatures. No matter how slender are the wages you pay
        him he will manage to lay up money. And Chinamen are the
        most gifted gardeners in the world. Give one of them a
        sandbank that would not support a lizard, and he will make
        it yield generous crops of vegetables. The Chinaman wastes
        <i>nothing</i>. Every thing has a value in his eyes. He
        gathers up all the cast-away rags and bones and bits of
        glass, and makes marketable articles of them. And he picks
        up all the old fruit cans you throw away and melts them up
        to get the tin and solder. When a white man discards a gold
        placer as no longer worth anything, the patient Chinaman,
        always satisfied with small profits, and never in a hurry
        to get rich, takes possession and works it contentedly for
        years.<br />
        <br />
        The Chinaman makes a good cook, a good washerwoman, a good
        chambermaid, a good gardener, a good banker's clerk, a good
        miner, a good railroad laborer, a good <i>anything</i> you
        choose to put him at -- for these people are all educated,
        they are all good accountants, they are very quiet and
        peaceable, they never disturb themselves about politics;
        they are so tractable, quick, smart, and naturally handy
        and ingenious, that you can teach them anything; they have
        no jealousies; they never lose a moment, never require
        watching to keep them at work; they are gifted with a world
        of patience, endurance and contentment. They are the best
        laboring class America has ever seen -- and they do not
        care a cent who is President. They are miserably abused by
        the laws of California, but that sort of thing will cease,
        some day. It was found just about impossible to build the
        California end of the Pacific Railroad with white men at $3
        per day and take care of all the broils and fights and
        strikes; but they put on Chinamen at a dollar a day and
        "find" themselves, and <i>they</i> built it without fights
        or strikes or anything, and saved the bulk of their wages,
        too. You will have these long-tailed toilers among you in
        "the States" some day, but you will find them right easy to
        get along with -- and you will like them, too, because they
        will stand a heap of abuse. You will find them ever so
        convenient, because when you get mad you can snatch a club
        and go out and take satisfaction out of a Chinaman. The
        native American Negro is getting so insolent, now, that the
        patriot from Ireland cannot take a little recreation out of
        him without getting into trouble. So the Chinaman will
        afford a needed relief.<br />

          <i>Modest Villainy</i>
        </center><br />
        As evidence that Chinamen are satisfied with small gains, I
        will remark that they drill five holes into the edge of
        gold coins -- drill clear through from edge to edge -- and
        save the gold thus bored out and fill up the hole with some
        sort of metallic composition that does not spoil the ring
        of the coin. Their counterfeiters put nine parts good metal
        and only one part base metal in their bogus coins -- and so
        it is very lucrative in the long run and the next thing to
        impossible to detect the cheat. It is only greedy bungling
        <i>Christian</i> counterfeiters that blunder into trouble,
        by trying to swindle their fellow creatures too
        heavily.<br />

        </center><br />
        Another curious feature about California life was the breed
        of desperadoes she reared and fostered on her soil and
        afterward distributed over adjacent Territories through her
        Vigilance Committees when she had had enough of their
        exploits. These men went armed to the teeth with monstrous
        revolvers, and preyed upon each other. Their slightest
        misunderstandings were settled on the spot by the bullet;
        but they very rarely molested peaceable citizens. They
        robbed and gambled and killed people for three or four
        years, and then "died with their boots on," as they phrased
        it; that is, they were killed themselves -- almost
        invariably -- and they never expected any other fate, and
        were very seldom disappointed.<br />
        <br />

        <center>
          <i>Sam Brown</i>
        </center><br />
        Sam Brown, of Nevada, killed sixteen men in his time, and
        was journeying toward Esmeralda to kill a seventeenth, who
        had stopped the breath of a friend of his, when a party of
        law-abiding citizens waylaid him and slaughtered him with
        shot guns. Mourners were exceeding scarce at his funeral.
        It is said that Sam Brown called for a drink at the bar of
        the Slaughter House in Carson City one morning (a saloon so
        nicknamed because so many men had been killed in it) and
        invited a stranger up to drink with him. The stranger said
        he never drank and wished to be excused. By the custom of
        the country, that was a deadly insult, and so Brown very
        properly shot him down. He left him lying there and went
        away, warning everybody to let the body alone, because it
        was <i>his</i> meat, he said. And it is said, also, that he
        came back after awhile and made a coffin and buried the man
        himself -- though I never could quite believe that without
        assistance.<br />
        <br />
        Virginia City was full of desperadoes, and some of the
        pleasantest newspaper reporting I ever did was in those
        days, because I reported the inquests on the entire lot of
        them, nearly. We had a fresh one pretty much every morning.
        Toward the last it was melancholy to see how the material
        was running short. Those were halcyon days! I don't know
        what halcyon days are, but that is the proper expression to
        use in this connection, I believe.<br />
        <br />

        <center>
          <i>Jack Williams</i>
        </center><br />
        Jack Williams was one of the luckiest of the Virginia City
        desperadoes. He killed a good many men. He was a
        kind-hearted man, and gave all his custom to a poor
        undertaker who was trying to get along. But by and bye some
        body poked a double barrelled shot gun through a crack
        while Williams was sitting at breakfast, and riddled him at
        such a rate that there was hardly enough of him left to
        hold an inquest on -- and then the poor unfortunate
        undertaker's best friend was gone, and he had to take in
        his sign. Thus he was stricken in the midst of his
        prosperity and his happiness -- for he was just on the
        point of getting married when Jack Williams was taken away
        from him, and of course he had to give it up then.<br />

          <i>Cemeterial Curiosities</i>
        </center><br />
        It is said that the first twenty-six graves in the cemetery
        at Virginia City were those of men who all died by the
        bullet. And the first six in another of those towns
        contained the bodies of a desperado and five of his victims
        -- and there in the bosom of his family, made dear to him
        by ties of blood, he calmly sleeps unto this day.<br />

          <i>Mr. Slade</i>
        </center><br />
        At the Rocky Ridge station in the Rocky Mountains, in the
        old days of overland stages and pony expresses, I had the
        gorgeous honor of breakfasting with Mr. Slade, the Prince
        of all the desperadoes; who killed twenty-six men in his
        time; who used to cut off his victims' ears and send them
        as keepsakes to their relatives; and who bound one of his
        victims hand and foot and practiced on him with his
        revolver for hours together -- a proceeding which seems
        almost inexcusable until we reflect that Rocky Ridge is
        away off in the dull solitudes of the mountains, and the
        poor desperadoes have hardly any amusements. Mr. Slade
        afterward went to Montana and began to thin out the
        population as usual -- for he took a great interest in
        trimming the census and regulating the vote -- but finally
        the Vigilance Committee captured him and hanged him, giving
        him just fifteen minutes to prepare himself in. The papers
        said he cried on the scaffold.<br />
        <br />
        The Vigilance Committee is a wholesome regulator in the new
        countries, and bad characters have a lively dread of it. In
        Montana one of these gentlemen was placed on his mule and
        informed that he had precisely fifteen minutes to leave the
        country in. He said, "Gents, if this mule don't balk,
        five'll answer."<br />
        <br />
        But that is sufficient about the desperadoes. I merely
        wished to make passing mention of them as a Californian
        production. -- <i>Mark Twain</i><br />
