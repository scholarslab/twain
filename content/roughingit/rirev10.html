        <p><i>Roughing It</i> is the title of Mark Twain's last
        book. The volume is full of humor and atrocious woodcuts,
        even more grotesque than the text. The book is made up of
        anecdote and descriptions of the author's experiences "on
        the Plains," in Virginia City, and in the Sandwich Islands.
        No writer ever made so much out of so little, and that much
        of such excellent quality. Notwithstanding his palpable
        exaggeration in certain parts when describing incidents,
        there is much more of truth to be found, and a better idea
        of situations (in the theatrical sense) conveyed, than can
        be obtained from the most sober-sided narrative of the
        events of which he tells. One peculiarity in Twain is, that
        the reader is never deceived; there is not the least effort
        required to discover when he is in earnest and when he is
        joking. Even in those sudden transitions from solemn
        narrative to grotesque metaphor or absurd assertion, he
        does not offend, for the very grotesqueness and absurdity
        save the reader's vanity from affront; he feels that Twain
        is not laughing at, but with him that is, so the reader
        believes. In truth, Mark tells some of the most magnificent
        "whoppers" with an ease and seeming candor not to be
        controverted except by those who know the facts--witness
        his narrative of his first effort as a lecturer.</p>
