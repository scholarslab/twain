          <font size="-1"><b>SATURDAY IN HONOLULU</b></font>
        </center>

        <p>Passing through the market place we saw that feature of
        Honolulu under its most favorable auspices--that is, in the
        full glory of Saturday afternoon, which is a festive day
        with the natives. The native girls by twos and threes and
        parties of a dozen, and sometimes in whole platoons and
        companies, went cantering up and down the neighboring
        streets astride of fleet but homely horses, and with their
        gaudy riding habits streaming like banners behind them.
        Such a troop of free and easy riders, in their natural
        home, which is the saddle, makes a gay and graceful and
        exhilarating spectacle. The riding habit I speak of is
        simply a long, broad scarf, like a tavern tablecloth
        brilliantly colored, wrapped around the loins once, then
        apparently passed up between the limbs and each end thrown
        backward over the same, and floating and flapping behind on
        both sides beyond the horse's tail like a couple of fancy
        flags; and then, with a girl that throws her chest forward
        and sits up like a major general and goes sweeping by like
        the wind. "Gay?" says Brown, with a fine irony; "oh, you
        can't mean it!"</p>

        <p>The girls put on all the finery they can scare up on
        Saturday afternoon--fine black silk robes; flowing red ones
        that nearly put your eyes out; others as white as snow;
        still others that discount the rainbow; and they wear their
        hair in nets, and trim their jaunty hats with fresh
        flowers, and encircle their dusky throats with homemade
        necklaces of the brilliant vermilion-tinted blossom of the
        ohia; and they fill the markets and the adjacent streets
        with their bright presences, and smell like thunder with
        their villainous coconut oil.</p>

        <p>Occasionally you see a heathen from the sunny isles away
        down in the South Seas, with his face and neck tattooed
        till he looks like the customary unfortunate from Reese
        River who has been blown up in a mine. Some are tattooed a
        dead blue color down to the upper lip--masked, as it
        were--leaving the natural light yellow skin of Micronesia
        unstained from thence down; some with broad marks drawn
        down from hair to neck, on both sides of the face, and a
        strip of the original yellow skin, two inches wide, down
        the center--a gridiron with a spoke broken out; and some
        with the entire face discolored with the popular
        mortification tint, relieved only by one or two thin, wavy
        threads of natural yellow running across the face from ear
        to ear, and eyes twinkling out of this darkness, from under
        shadowing hat brims, like stars in the dark of the
        moon.</p>

        <center>
          <font size="-1"><b>POI FOR SALE</b></font>
        </center>

        <p>Moving among the stirring crowds, you come to the poi
        merchants, squatting in the shade on their hams, in true
        native fashion, and surrounded by purchasers. (The Sandwich
        Islanders always squat on their hams, and who knows but
        they may be the old original "ham sandwiches"? The thought
        is pregnant with interest.) The poi looks like common flour
        paste, and is kept in large bowls formed of a species of
        gourd, and capable of holding from one to three or four
        gallons. Poi is the chief article of food among the
        natives, and is prepared from the kalo or taro plant
        (<i>k</i> and <i>t</i> are the same in the Kanaka alphabet,
        and so are <i>l</i> and <i>r</i>). The taro root looks like
        a thick, or, if you please, a corpulent sweet potato, in
        shape, but is of a light purple color when boiled. When
        boiled it answers as a passable substitute for bread. The
        buck Kanakas bake it under ground, then mash it up well
        with a heavy lava pestle, mix water with it until it
        becomes a paste, set it aside and let it ferment, and then
        it is poi--and a villainous mixture it is, almost tasteless
        before it ferments and too sour for a luxury afterward. But
        nothing in the world is more nutritious. When solely used,
        however, it produces acrid humors, a fact which
        sufficiently accounts for the blithe and humorous character
        of the Kanakas. I think there must be as much of a knack in
        handling poi as there is in eating with chopsticks. The
        forefinger is thrust into the mess and stirred quickly
        round several times and drawn as quickly out, thickly
        coated, just as if it were poulticed; the head is thrown
        back, the finger inserted in the mouth and the poultice
        stripped off and swallowed--the eye closing gently,
        meanwhile, in a languid sort of ecstasy. Many a different
        finger goes into the same bowl and many a different kind of
        dirt and shade and quality of flavor is added to the
        virtues of its contents. One tall gentleman, with nothing
        in the world on but a soiled and greasy shirt, thrust in
        his finger and tested the poi, shook his head, scratched it
        with the useful finger, made another test, prospected among
        his hair, caught something and ate it; tested the poi
        again, wiped the grimy perspiration from his brow with the
        universal hand, tested again, blew his nose--"Let's move
        on, Brown," said I, and we moved.</p>

        <center>
          <font size="-1"><b>AWA FOR SALE--DITTO FISH</b></font>
        </center>

        <p>Around a small shanty was collected a crowd of natives
        buying the awa root. It is said that but for the use of
        this root the destruction of the people in former times by
        venereal diseases would have been far greater than it was,
        and by others it is said that this is merely a fancy. All
        agree that poi will rejuvenate a man who is used up and his
        vitality almost annihilated by hard drinking, and that in
        some kinds of diseases it will restore health after all
        medicines have failed; but all are not willing to allow to
        the awa the virtues claimed for it. The natives manufacture
        an intoxicating drink from it which is fearful in its
        effects when persistently indulged in. It covers the body
        with dry, white scales, inflames the eyes, and causes
        premature decrepitude. Although the man before whose
        establishment we stopped has to pay a government license of
        eight hundred dollars a year for an exclusive right to sell
        awa root, it is said that he makes a small fortune every
        twelvemonth; while saloonkeepers, who pay a thousand
        dollars a year for the privilege of retailing whiskey,
        etc., only make a bare living.</p>

        <p>We found the fish market crowded; for the native is very
        fond of fish, and eats the article raw. Let us change the
        subject.</p>

        <center>
          <font size="-1"><b>OLD-TIME SATURDAYS</b></font>
        </center>

        <p>In old times here Saturday was a grand gala day indeed.
        All the native population of the town forsook their labors,
        and those of the surrounding country journeyed to the city.
        Then the white folks had to stay indoors, for every street
        was so packed with charging cavaliers and cavalieresses
        that it was next to impossible to thread one's way through
        the cavalcades without getting crippled. In the afternoon
        the natives were wont to repair to the plain, outside the
        town, and indulge in their ancient sports and pastimes and
        bet away their week's earnings on horse races. One might
        see two or three thousand, some say five thousand, of these
        wild riders, skurrying over the plain in a mass in those
        days. And it must have been a fine sight.</p>

        <p>At night they feasted and the girls danced the
        lascivious hula-hula--a dance that is said to exhibit the
        very perfection of educated motion of limb and arm, hand,
        head, and body, and the exactest uniformity of movement and
        accuracy of "time." It was performed by a circle of girls
        with no raiment on them to speak of, who went through with
        an infinite variety of motions and figures without
        prompting, and yet so true was their "time," and in such
        perfect concert did they move that when they were placed in
        a straight line, hands, arms, bodies, limbs, and heads
        waved, swayed, gesticulated, bowed, stooped, whirled,
        squirmed, twisted, and undulated as if they were part and
        parcel of a single individual; and it was difficult to
        believe they were not moved in a body by some exquisite
        piece of mechanism.</p>

        <p>Of late years, however, Saturday has lost most of its
        quondam gala features. This weekly stampede of the natives
        interfered too much with labor and the interests of the
        white folks, and by sticking in a law here, and preaching a
        sermon there, and by various other means, they gradually
        broke it up. The demoralizing hula-hula was forbidden to be
        performed, save at night, with closed doors, in presence of
        few spectators, and only by permission duly procured from
        the authorities and the payment of ten dollars for the
        same. There are few girls nowadays able to dance this
        ancient national dance in the highest perfection of the
        art.</p>

        slipping the stirrup-irons between her toes, the girl
        throws her chest for ward, sits up like a Major General and
        goes sweeping by like the wind.</p>

        <p>The girls put on all the finery they can on Saturday

        and they fill the markets and the adjacent street with
        their bright presences, and smell like a rag factory on
        fire with their offensive cocoanut oil.</p>

        <p>Occasionally you see a heathen from the sunny isles away
        down in the South Seas, with his face and neck tatooed till
        he looks like the customary mendicant from Washoe who has
        been blown up in a mine. Some are tattooed a dead blue
        color down to the upper lip--masked, as it were--leaving
        the natural light yellow skin of Micronesia unstained from
        thence down; some with broad marks drawn down from hair to
        neck, on both sides of the face. and a strip of the
        original yellow skin, two inches wide, down the center--a
        gridiron with a spoke broken out; and some with the entire
        face discolored with the popular mortification tint,
        relieved only by one or two thin, wavy threads of natural
        yellow running across the face from ear to ear, and eyes
        twinkling out of this darkness, from under shadowing
        hat-brims, like stars in the dark of the moon.</p>
