        But they were rough in those times! They fairly reveled in
        gold, whisky, fights and fandangoes, and were unspeakably
        happy. The honest miner raked a hundred to a thousand
        dollars out of his claim a day, and what with the gambling
        dues and the other entertainments, he hadn't a cent the
        next morning, if he had any sort of luck. They cooked their
        own bacon and beans, sewed on their own buttons, washed
        their own shirts -- blue woolen ones -- and if a man wanted
        a fight on his hands without any annoying delay, all he had
        to do was to appear in public in a white shirt or a
        stove-pipe hat, and he would be accommodated. For those
        people hated aristocrats. They had a particular and
        malignant animosity toward what they called a "biled
        shirt."<br />
        <br />
        In his sketch entitled "The Luck of Roaring Camp," Mr. Bret
        Harte has deftly pictured the roughness and lawlessness of
        a California mining camp of the early days, and also its
        large-hearted charity and compassion -- for these traits
        are found in all true pioneers. Roaring Camp becomes
        blessed by the presence of a wandering, sickly woman and
        her little child -- rare and coveted treasures among rude
        men who still yearned in secret for the mothers and sisters
        and children they loved and cherished in other days. This
        wanderer -- the only woman in Roaring Camp -- died, and the
        honest miners took charge of the orphan little one in a
        body. They washed it and dressed it and fed it -- getting
        its garments on wrong end first as often as any other way,
        and pinning the garments to the child occasionally and
        wondering why the baby wasn't comfortable -- and the food
        these inexperienced nurses lovingly concocted for it was
        often rather beyond its capabilities, since it was neither
        an alligator nor an ostrich.<br />
        <br />
        But they meant well, and the baby thrived in spite of the
        perilous kindnesses of the miners. But it was manifest that
        all could not nurse the baby at once, and so they passed a
        law that the best behaved man should have it for one day,
        and the man with the cleanest shirt the next day, and the
        man whose cabin was in the neatest order the next, and so
        on. And the result was, that a handsome cradle was bought,
        and carted from cabin to cabin, according to who won the
        privilege of nursing that day -- and the handsome cradle
        made such a contrast to the unhandsome furniture, that
        gradually the unhandsome furniture disappeared and gave way
        for a neater sort -- and then ambitious male nurses got to
        washing up and putting on clean garments every day, and
        some of them twice a day -- and rough, boisterous
        characters became gentle and soft-spoken, since only the
        well-behaved could nurse the baby. And, in fine, the
        lawless Roaring Camp became insensibly transformed into a
        neat well-dressed, orderly and law-abiding community, the
        wonder and admiration of all the mining world. All this,
        through the dumb teaching, the humanizing influence, the
        uninspired ministering of a little child.<br />

        In those days men would flock in crowds to catch a glimpse
        of that rare and blessed spectacle, a woman! Old
        inhabitants tell how, in a certain camp, the news went
        abroad early in the morning that a woman was come! They had
        seen a calico dress hanging out of a wagon down at the
        camping ground -- sign of emigrants from over the great
        plains. Everybody went down there, and a shout went up when
        an actual, bona fide dress was discovered fluttering in the
        wind! The male emigrant was visible. The miners said:<br />
        <br />
        "Fetch her out!"<br />
        <br />
        He said: "It is my wife, gentlemen -- she is sick -- we
        have been robbed of money, provisions, everything, by the
        Indians -- we want to rest."<br />
        <br />
        "Fetch her out! We've got to see her!"<br />
        <br />
        That was the only reply.<br />
        <br />
        He "fetched her out," and they swung their hats and sent up
        three rousing cheers and a tiger; and they crowded around
        and gazed at her, and touched her dress, and listened to
        her voice with the look of men who listened to a memory
        rather than a present reality -- and then they collected
        twenty-five hundred dollars in gold and gave it to the man,
        and swung their hats again and gave three more cheers, and
        went home satisfied.<br />

        A year or two ago I dined in San Francisco with the family
        of a pioneer, and talked with his daughter, a young lady
        whose first experience in San Francisco was an adventure,
        though she herself did not remember it, as she was only two
        or three years old at the time. Her father said that, after
        landing from the ship, they were walking up the street, a
        servant leading the party with the little girl in her arms.
        And presently a huge miner, bearded, belted, spurred, and
        bristling with deadly weapons -- just down from a long
        mining campaign in the mountains, evidently barred the way,
        stopped the servant, and stood gazing, with a face all
        alive with gratification and astonishment. Then he said,
        reverently:<br />
        <br />
        "Well, if it ain't a child!" And then he snatched a little
        leather sack out of his pocket and said to the
        servant:<br />
        <br />
        "There's a hundred and fifty dollars in dust, there, and
        I'll give it to you to let me kiss the child!"<br />
        <br />
        That anecdote is true.<br />
        <br />
        But see how things change. Sitting at that dinner table,
        listening to that anecdote, if I had offered double the
        money for the privilege of kissing the same child, I would
        have been refused. Seventeen added years had far more than
        doubled the price.<br />

        And while upon this subject I will remark that once in Star
        City, in the Humboldt Mountains, I took my place in a sort
        of long, post-office single-file of miners, to patiently
        await my chance to peep through a crack in a cabin and get
        a sight of the splendid new sensation -- a genuine, live
        Woman! And at the end of three-quarters of an hour my turn
        came, and I put my eye to the crack, and there she was,
        with one arm akimbo, and tossing flap jacks in a frying pan
        with the other. And she was 165 years old, and hadn't a
        tooth in her head. However, she was a woman and therefore
        we were glad to see her and to make her welcome.<br />
