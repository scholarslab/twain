        <p>Impressed by the profound silence and repose that rested
        over the beautiful landscape, and being, as usual, in the
        rear, I gave voice to my thought. I said: "What a picture
        is here slumbering in the solemn glory of the moon! How
        strong the rugged outlines of the dead volcano stand out
        against the clear sky! What a snowy fringe marks the
        bursting of the surf over the long, curved reef! How calmly
        the dim city sleeps yonder in the plain! How soft the
        shadows lie upon the stately mountains that border the
        dream-haunted Manoa Valley! What a grand pyramid of billowy
        clouds towers above the storied Pari! How the grim warriors
        of the past seem flocking in ghostly squadrons to their
        ancient battlefield again--how the wails of the dying well
        up from the--"</p>

        <p>At this point the horse called Oahu deliberately down in
        the sand. Sat down to listen, I suppose. Never mind what he
        heard. I stopped apostrophizing and convinced him that I
        was not a man to allow contempt of court on the part of a
        horse. I broke the backbone of a chief over his rump and
        set out to join the cavalcade again.</p>

        <p>Very considerably fagged out we arrived in town at nine
        o'clock at night, myself in the lead--for when my horse
        finally came to understand that he was homeward bound and
        hadn't far to go, he threw his legs wildly out before and
        behind him, depressed his head and laid his ears back, and
        flew by the admiring company like a telegram. In five
        minutes he was far away ahead of everybody.</p>
