      <br />
      Speaking of sagacity it reminds me of Dick Baker, pocket
      miner of Deadhorse Gulch. Whenever he was out of luck and a
      little downhearted, he would fall to mourning over the loss
      of a wonderful cat he used to own (for where women and
      children are not, men of kindly impulses take up with pets,
      for they must love something.) And he always spoke of the
      strange sagacity of that cat with the air of a man who
      believed in his secret heart that there was something human
      about it -- may be even supernatural.<br />
      <br />
      I heard him talking about this animal once. He said,
      "Gentlemen, I used to have a cat here, by the name of Tom
      Quartz, which you'd a took an interest in I reckon -- most
      any body would. I had him here 8 year -- and he was the
      remarkablest cat I ever see. He was a large gray one of the
      Tom specie, and he had more hard, nat'ral sense than any man
      in this camp -- and a <i>power</i> of dignity -- he wouldn't
      a let the Gov'ner of California be familiar with him. He
      never ketched a rat in his life -- 'peared to be above it. He
      never cared for nothing but mining. He knowed more about
      mining, that cat did, than any man I ever see. You couldn't
      tell <i>him</i> nothing about placer diggings -- and as for
      pocket mining, why he was just born for it. He would dig out
      after me and Jim when we went over the hills prospecting, and
      he would trot along behind us for as much as five mile, if we
      went so far. And he had the best judgment about mining ground
      -- why you never see anything like it. When we went to work,
      he'd scatter a glance around, and if he didn't think much of
      the indications, he would give a look as much as to say,
      'Well, I'll have to get you to excuse <i>me</i>,' and without
      another word he'd hyste his nose into the air and shove for
      home. But if the ground suited him, he would lay low and keep
      dark till the first pan was washed and then he would sidle up
      and take a look, and if there was about six or seven grains
      of gold <i>he</i> was satisfied -- he didn't want no better
      prospect'n that -- and then he would lay down on our coats
      and snore like a steamboat till we'd struck the pocket, and
      then get up and superintend.<br />
      <br />
      "Well, bye and bye, up comes this quartz excitement. Every
      body was into it -- every body was picking and blasting
      instead of shoveling dirt on the hill side -- every body was
      putting down a shaft instead of scraping the surface. Nothing
      would do Jim, but <i>we</i> must tackle the ledges, too, and
      so we did. We commenced putting down a shaft, and Tom Quartz
      he begin to wonder what in the Dickens it was all about.
      <i>He</i> hadn't ever seen any mining like that before, and
      he was all upset, as you may say he couldn't come to a right
      understanding of it no way -- it was too many for <i>him</i>.
      He was down on it, too, you bet you-- he was down on it
      powerful -- and always appeared to consider it the cussedest
      foolishness out. But that cat, you know, he was always agin
      new fangled arrangements -- somehow he never could abide 'em.
      You know how it is with old habits. But by and by Tom Quartz
      begin to git sort of reconciled a little, though he never
      could altogether understand that eternal sinking of a shaft
      and never panning out any thing. At last he got to coming
      down in the shaft, hisself, to try to cipher it out. And when
      he'd get the blues, and feel kind o' scruffy, aggravated and
      disgusted -- knowing as he did, that the bills was running up
      all the time and we warn't making a cent -- he would curl up
      on a gunny sack in the corner and go to sleep. Well, one day
      when the shaft was down about 8 foot, the rock got so hard
      that we had to put in a blast -- the first blasting we'd ever
      done since Tom Quartz was born. And then we lit the fuse and
      clumb out and got off about 50 yards -- and forgot and left
      Tom Quartz sound asleep on the gunny sack. In about a minute
      we seen a puff of smoke bust up out of the hole, and then
      everything let go with an awful crash, and about four million
      tons of rocks and dirt and smoke and splinters shot up about
      a mile and a half into the air, and by George, right in the
      midst of it was old Tom Quartz going end over end, and a
      snorting and a sneezing, and a clawing and a reaching for
      things like all possessed. But it warn't no use, you know. it
      warn't no use. And that was the last we see of <i>him</i> for
      about two minutes and a half, and then all of a sudden it
      begin to rain rocks and rubbage, and directly he come down
      ker-whop about ten foot off from where we stood. Well, I
      reckon he was p'raps the orneriest looking beast you ever
      see. One ear was sot back on his neck, and his tail way stove
      up, and his eye-winkers was swinged off, and he was all
      blacked up with powder and smoke and all sloppy with mud and
      slush from one end to the other. Well sir, it warn't no use
      to try to apologize -- we couldn't say a word. He took a sort
      of a disgusted look at hisself, and then he looked at us --
      and it was just exactly as if he had said -- "Gents, May be
      <i>you</i> think it's smart to take advantage of a cat that
      'ain't had no experience of quartz mining, but I think
      <i>different</i>" -- and then he turned on his heel and
      marched off home without ever saying another word.<br />
      <br />
      "That was jest his style. And may be you won't believe it,
      but after that you never see a cat so prejudiced agin quartz
      mining as what he was. And by and bye when he <i>did</i> get
      to going down in the shaft agin, you'd a been astonished at
      his sagacity. The minute we'd touch off a blast and the
      fuse'd begin to sizzle, he'd give a look as much as to say,
      'Well, I'll have to get you to excuse <i>me</i>,' and it was
      surprising, the way he'd shin out of that hole and go for a
      tree.<br />
      <br />
      "Sagacity? It ain't no name for it. 'Twas
      <i>inspiration</i>!"<br />
      <br />
      I said, "Well, Mr. Baker, his prejudice against quartz mining
      <i>was</i> remarkable, considering how he came by it.
      Couldn't you ever cure him of it?"<br />
      <br />
      "<i>Cure him!</i> No. When Tom Quartz was sot once, he was
      <i>always</i> sot -- and you might a blowed him up as much as
      3 million times and you'd never a broke him of his cussed
      prejudice agin quartz mining."<br />
      <br />
      The affection and the pride that lit up Baker's face when he
      delivered this tribute to the firmness of his humble friend
      of other days will always be a vivid memory with
      me.<br /></td>
