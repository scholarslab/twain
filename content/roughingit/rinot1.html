        Twain's new book, which will soon be issued. It is a
        companion volume to "The Innocents Abroad," and is filled
        with descriptions of people and things seen by Mark. In
        this volume the author relates how "a three months'
        pleasure trip was extended to a term of seven years, and
        the causes therefor." Mark tells many humorous and
        instructive incidents connected with the education of an
        Innocent, and in this book is a record of varied
        experiences of the author in various positions in life
        while <i>en route</i> from that of a penniless American
        citizen to that of a millionaire, and back to his original
        condition." The volume will contain between 600 and 700
        octavo pages, and will be abundantly supplied with
        characteristic engravings. Those who had read that charming
        book, "The Innocents Abroad," will want this companion
        volume. The book will no doubt be purchased by all admirers
        of the humorist, and they are many. Miss Nellie Lewis is
        the agent for Jackson, and is now engaged in canvassing for
        subscribers to the work.</p>
