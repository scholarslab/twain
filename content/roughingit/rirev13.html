        <p>Mark Twain's personal narrative under the above title is
        a spicy, interesting and instructive book abounding in
        brave though brilliant exaggerations, yet containing no
        inconsiderable amount of useful information. He mirrors the
        scenes in Nevada and California during the famous Washoe
        silver excitement, gives an amusing account of a journey
        overland by coach, describes the salient features of the
        Sandwich Islands, and tells us about his early experience
        in lecturing. Those who are familiar with the scenes he
        locates in Nevada and our own State, will of course form
        their own opinions of all the statements, knowing how to
        take them, and people abroad must accept the toughest
        <i>cum grano salis</i>. His conscience never prevents him
        from bringing a story to a triumphant conclusion. At least
        he always does it. In his prefatory remarks he says the
        volume is a record of several years of variegated
        vagabondizing, and its object is rather to help the resting
        reader while away an idle hour than afflict him with
        metaphysics or goad him with science. Thus he puts the
        reader on the right scent at the outset; and if, through
        plausibility and a fertile imagination, the author manages
        to give extravagant yarns the color of truth, it is to be
        hoped that the preface will act as a balance in the
        reader's mind and influence him to believe only what comes
        within the natural range of possibility. His essays on
        mining, for some of the chapters are sufficiently erudite
        and elaborate to be worthy of that distinction, contain
        descriptions and suggestions which are correct, both in
        theory and practice, and will be readily endorsed by
        experienced miners; and his pictures of Wahoe society, as
        it existed during the silver-mining fever, however much he
        may embellish in individual instances, are at times
        remarkably faithful. In a literary point of view the work
        is hardly up to the standard of <i>The Innocents
        Abroad</i>. We miss that eloquence of description adorning
        a few of his sketches of France. It is full of genial
        humor, however, has a great deal of that pungent flavor of
        Western life, and is sure to be appreciated by Mark Twain's
        legion of admirers. The book is published in good shape,
        and contains hundreds of striking illustrations. It is
        "inscribed to Calvin H. Higbie, of California, by the
        author, in memory of the curious time when we two were
        millionaires for ten days." Higbie figures as the second
        person in the <a name="j" id="j">annexed extract:</a></p>

          He said once or twice that he meant to have a look into
          the Wide West shaft if he got shot for it. I was
          wretched, and did not care whether he got a look into it
          or not. He failed that day, and tried again at night;
          failed again; got up at dawn and tried, and failed again.
          Then he lay in ambush in the sage brush hour after hour,
          waiting for the two or three hands to adjourn to the
          shade of a boulder for dinner; made a start once, but was
          premature--one of the men came back for something; tried
          it again, but when almost at the mouth of the shaft,
          another of the men rose up from behind the boulder as if
          to reconnoitre, and he dropped on the ground and lay
          quiet; presently he crawled on his hands and knees to the
          mouth of the shaft, gave a quick glance around, then
          seized the rope and slid down the shaft. He disappeared
          in the gloom of a "side drift" just as a head appeared in
          the mouth of the shaft and somebody shouted
          "Hello!"--which he did not answer. He was not disturbed
          any more. An hour later he entered the cabin, hot, red,
          and ready to burst with smothered excitement, and
          exclaimed in a stage whisper:

        <blockquote>
          "I knew it! We are rich! IT'S A BLIND LEAD!"
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          I thought the very earth reeled under me.
          Doubt--conviction--doubt again--exultation--hope,
          amazement, belief, unbelief--every emotion imaginable
          swept in wild procession through my heart and brain, and
          I could not speak a word. After a moment or two of this
          mental fury, I shook myself to rights, and said:
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          "Say it again!"
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          "It's blind lead!"
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          "Cal., let's--let's burn the house--or kill somebody!
          Let's get out where there's room to hurrah! But what is
          the use? It is a hundred times too good to be true."
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          "It's a blind lead, for a million!--hanging wall--foot
          wall--clay casings--everything complete!" He swung his
          hat and gave three cheers, and I cast doubt to the winds
          and chimed in with a will. For I was worth a million
          dollars, and did not care "whether school kept or not!"
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          But perhaps I ought to explain. A "blind lead" is a lead
          or ledge that does not "crop out" above the surface. A
          miner does not know where to look for such leads, but
          they are often stumbled upon by accident in the course of
          driving a tunnel or sinking a shaft. Higbie knew the Wide
          West rock perfectly well, and the more he had examined
          the new developments the more he was satisfied that the
          ore could not have come from the Wide West vein. And so
          had it occurred to him alone, of all the camp, that there
          was a blind lead down in the shaft, and that even the
          Wide West people themselves did not suspect it. He was
          right. When he went down the shaft, he found that the
          blind lead held its independent way through the Wide West
          vein, cutting it diagonally, and that it was enclosed in
          its own well-defined casing-rocks and clay. Hence it was
          public property. Both leads being perfectly well defined,
          it was easy for any miner to see which one belonged to
          the Wide West and which did not.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          We thought it well to have a strong friend, and therefore
          we brought the foreman of the Wide West to our cabin that
          night and revealed the great surprise to him. Higbie
          said:
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          "We are going to take possession of this blind lead,
          record it and establish ownership, and then forbid the
          Wide West company to take out any more of the rock. You
          cannot help your company in this matter--nobody can help
          them. I will go into the shaft with you and prove to your
          entire satisfaction that it <i>is</i> a blind lead. Now
          we propose to take you in with us, and claim the blind
          lead in our three names. What do you say?"
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          What could a man say who had an opportunity to simply
          stretch forth his hand and take possession of a fortune
          without risk of any kind and without wronging any one or
          attaching the least taint of dishonor to his name? He
          could only say, "Agreed."
