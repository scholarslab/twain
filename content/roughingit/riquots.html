  <blockquote>
    <a name="i" id="i">He put his foot</a> on it, and lifted one of
    the sleeves out with his teeth, and chewed and chewed at it,
    gradually taking it in, and all the while opening and closing
    his eyes in a kind of religious ecstasy, as if he had never
    tasted anything as good as an overcoat before, in his life.
    Then he smacked his lips once or twice, and reached after the
    other sleeve. Next he tried the velvet collar, and smiled a
    smile of such contentment that it was plain to see that he
    regarded that as the daintiest thing about an overcoat. The
    tails went next, along with some percussion caps and cough
    candy, and some fig-paste from Constantinople. And then my
    newspaper correspondence dropped out, and he took a chance in
    that--manuscript letters written for the home papers. But he
    was treading on dangerous ground, now. He began to come across
    solid wisdom in those documents that was rather weighty on his
    stomach; and occasionally he would take a joke that would shake
    him up till it loosened his teeth.

  <blockquote>
    <a name="c" id="c">The cayote</a> is a living, breathing
    allegory of Want. He is <i>always</i> hungry. He is always
    poor, out of luck and friendless. The meanest creatures despise
    him, and even the fleas would desert him for a velocipede. He
    is so spiritless and cowardly that even while his exposed teeth
    are pretending a threat, the rest of his face is apologizing
    for it. And he is <i>so</i> homely!--so scrawny, and ribby, and
    coarse-haired, and pitiful. When he sees you he lifts his lip
    and lets a flash of his teeth out, and then turns a little out
    of the course he was pursuing, depresses his head a bit, and
    strikes a long, soft-footed trot through the sage-brush,
    glancing over his shoulder at you, from time to time, till he
    is about out of easy pistol range, and then he stops and takes
    a deliberate survey of you; he will trot fifty yards and stop
    again--another fifty and stop again; and finally the gray of
    his gliding body blends with the gray of the sage-brush, and he
    disappears. All this is when you make no demonstration against
    him; but if you do, he develops a livelier interest in his
    journey, and instantly electrifies his heels and puts such a
    deal of real estate between himself and your weapon, that by
    the time you have raised the hammer you see that you need a
    minie rifle, and by the time you have got him in line you need
    a rifled cannon, and by the time you have "drawn a bead" on him
    you see well enough that nothing but an unusually long-winded
    streak of lightning could reach him where he is now. But if you
    start a swift-footed dog after him, you will enjoy it ever so
    much--especially if it is a dog that has a good opinion of
    himself, and has been brought up to think he knows something
    about speed.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    The cayote will go swinging gently off on that deceitful trot
    of his, and every little while he will smile a fraudful smile
    over his shoulder that will fill that dog entirely full of
    encouragement and worldly ambition, and make him lay his head
    still lower to the ground, and stretch his neck further to the
    front, and pant more fiercely, and stick his tail out
    straighter behind, and move his furious legs with a yet wilder
    frenzy, and leave a broader and broader, and higher and denser
    cloud of desert sand smoking behind, and marking his long wake
    across the level plain! And all this time the dog is only a
    short twenty feet behind the cayote, and to save the soul of
    him he cannot understand why it is that he cannot get
    perceptibly closer; and he begins to get aggravated, and it
    makes him madder and madder to see how gently the cayote glides
    along and never pants or sweats or ceases to smile; and he
    grows still more and more incensed to see how shamefully he has
    been taken in by an entire stranger, and what an ignoble
    swindle that long, calm, soft-footed trot is; and next he
    notices that he is getting fagged, and that the cayote actually
    has to slacken speed a little to keep from running away from
    him--and <i>then</i> that town-dog is mad in earnest, and he
    begins to strain and weep and swear, and paw the sand higher
    than ever, and reach for the cayote with concentrated and
    desperate energy. This "spurt" finds him six feet behind the
    gliding enemy, and two miles from his friends. And then, in the
    instant that a wild new hope is lighting up his face, the
    cayote turns and smiles blandly upon him once more, and with a
    something about it which seems to say: "Well, I shall have to
    tear myself away from you, bub--business is business, and it
    will not do for me to be fooling along this way all day"--and
    forthwith there is a rushing sound, and the sudden splitting of
    a long crack through the atmosphere, and behold that dog is
    solitary and alone in the midst of a vast solitude!
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    It makes his head swim. He stops, and looks all around; climbs
    the nearest sand-mound, and gazes into the distance; shakes his
    head reflectively, and then, without a word, he turns and jogs
    along back to his train, and takes up a humble position under
    the hindmost wagon, and feels unspeakably mean, and looks
    ashamed, and hangs his tail at half-mast for a week.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <a name="e" id="e">In a little while</a> all interest was taken
    up in stretching our necks and watching for the
    "pony-rider"--the fleet messenger who sped across the continent
    from St. Joe to Sacramento, carrying letters nineteen hundred
    miles in eight days! Think of that for perishable horse and
    human flesh and blood to do! The pony-rider was usually a
    little bit of a man, brimful of spirit and endurance. No matter
    what time of the day or night his watch came on, and no matter
    whether it was winter or summer, raining, snowing, hailing, or
    sleeting, or whether his "beat" was a level straight road or a
    crazy trail over mountain crags and precipices, or whether it
    led through peaceful regions or regions that swarmed with
    hostile Indians, he must be always ready to leap into the
    saddle and be off like the wind! There was no idling-time for a
    pony-rider on duty. He rode fifty miles without stopping, by
    daylight, moonlight, starlight, or through the blackness of
    darkness--just as it happened. He rode a splendid horse that
    was born for a racer and fed and lodged like a gentleman; kept
    him at his utmost speed for ten miles, and then, as he came
    crashing up to the station where stood two men holding fast a
    fresh, impatient steed, the transfer of rider and mail-bag was
    made in the twinkling of an eye, and away flew the eager pair
    and were out of sight before the spectator could get hardly the
    ghost of a look. Both rider and horse went "flying light." The
    rider's dress was thin, and fitted close; he wore a
    "round-about," and a skull-cap, and tucked his pantaloons into
    his boot-tops like a race-rider. He carried no arms--he carried
    nothing that was not absolutely necessary, for even the postage
    on his literary freight was worth <i>five dollars a letter</i>.
    He got but little frivolous correspondence to carry--his bag
    had business letters in it, mostly. His horse was stripped of
    all unnecessary weight, too. He wore a little wafer of a
    racing-saddle, and no visible blanket. He wore light shoes, or
    none at all. The little flat mail-pockets strapped under the
    rider's thighs would each hold about the bulk of a child's
    primer. They held many and many an important business chapter
    and newspaper letter, but these were written on paper as airy
    and thin as gold-leaf, nearly, and thus bulk and weight were
    economized. The stage-coach traveled about a hundred to a
    hundred and twenty-five miles a day (twenty-four hours), the
    pony-rider about two hundred and fifty. There were about eighty
    pony-riders in the saddle all the time, night and day,
    stretching in a long, scattering procession from Missouri to
    California, forty flying eastward, and forty toward the west,
    and among them making four hundred gallant horses earn a
    stirring livelihood and see a deal of scenery every single day
    in the year.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    We had had a consuming desire, from the beginning, to see a
    pony-rider, but somehow or other all that passed us and all
    that met us managed to streak by in the night, and so we heard
    only a whiz and a hail, and the swift phantom of the desert was
    gone before we could get our heads out of the windows. But now
    we were expecting one along every moment, and would see him in
    broad daylight. Presently the driver exclaims:
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    "HERE HE COMES!"
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    Every neck is stretched further, and every eye strained wider.
    Away across the endless dead level of the prairie a black speck
    appears against the sky, and it is plain that it moves. Well, I
    should think so! In a second or two it becomes a horse and
    rider, rising and falling, rising and falling--sweeping toward
    us nearer and nearer--growing more and more distinct, more and
    more sharply defined--nearer and still nearer, and the flutter
    of the hoofs comes faintly to the ear--another instant a whoop
    and a hurrah from our upper deck, a wave of the rider's hand,
    but no reply, and man and horse burst past our excited faces,
    and go winging away like a belated fragment of a storm!
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    So sudden is it all, and so like a flash of unreal fancy, that
    but for the flake of white foam left quivering and perishing on
    a mail-sack after the vision had flashed by and disappeared, we
    might have doubted whether we had seen any actual horse and man
    at all, maybe.

    <a name="b" id="b">Fifty-two miles</a> further on, near the
    head of Echo Canyon, we met sixty United States soldiers from
    Camp Floyd. The day before, they had fired upon three hundred
    or four hundred Indians, whom they supposed gathered together
    for no good purpose. In the fight that had ensued, four Indians
    were captured, and the main body chased four miles, but nobody
    killed. This looked like business. We had a notion to get out
    and join the sixty soldiers, but upon reflecting that there
    were four hundred of the Indians, we concluded to go on and
    join the Indians.

    only two days, and therefore we had no time to make the
    customary inquisition into the workings of polygamy and get up
    the usual statistics and deductions preparatory to calling the
    attention of the nation at large once more to the matter. I had
    the will to do it. With the gushing self-sufficiency of youth I
    was feverish to plunge in headlong and achieve a great reform
    here--until I saw the Mormon women. Then I was touched. My
    heart was wiser than my head. It warmed toward these poor,
    ungainly and pathetically "homely" creatures, and as I turned
    to hide the generous moisture in my eyes, I said, "No--the man
    that marries one of them has done an act of Christian charity
    which entitles him to the kindly applause of mankind, not their
    harsh censure--and the man that marries sixty of them has done
    a deed of open-handed generosity so sublime that the nations
    should stand uncovered in his presence and worship in silence."

    <a name="d" id="d">Such of the Goshoots</a> as we saw, along
    the road and hanging about the stations, were small, lean,
    "scrawny" creatures; in complexion a dull black like the
    ordinary American negro; their faces and hands bearing dirt
    which they had been hoarding and accumulating for months,
    years, and even generations, according to the age of the
    proprietor; a silent, sneaking, treacherous looking race;
    taking note of everything, covertly, like all the other "Noble
    Red Men" that we (do not) read about, and betraying no sign in
    their countenances; indolent, everlastingly patient and
    tireless, like all other Indians; prideless beggars--for if the
    beggar instinct were left out of an Indian he would not "go,"
    any more than a clock without a pendulum; hungry, always
    hungry, and yet never refusing anything that a hog would eat,
    though often eating what a hog would decline; hunters, but
    having no higher ambition than to kill and eat jack-ass
    rabbits, crickets and grasshoppers, and embezzle carrion from
    the buzzards and cayotes; savages who, when asked if they have
    the common Indian belief in a Great Spirit show a something
    which almost amounts to emotion, thinking whiskey is referred
    to; a thin, scattering race of almost naked black children,
    these Goshoots are, who produce nothing at all, and have no
    villages, and no gatherings together into strictly defined
    trival communities--a people whose only shelter is a rag cast
    on a bush to keep off a portion of the snow, and yet who
    inhabit one of the most rocky, wintry, repulsive wastes that
    our country or any other can exhibit.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    The Bushmen and our Goshoots are manifestly descended from the
    self-same gorilla, or kangaroo, or Norway rat, which-ever
    animal-Adam the Darwinians trace them to.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    One would as soon expect the rabbits to fight as the Goshoots,
    and yet they used to live off the offal and refuse of the
    stations a few months and then come some dark night when no
    mischief was expected, and burn down the buildings and kill the
    men from ambush as they rushed out. And once, in the night,
    they attacked the stage-coach when a District Judge, of Nevada
    Territory, was the only passenger, and with their first volley
    of arrows (and a bullet or two) they riddled the stage
    curtains, wounded a horse or two and mortally wounded the
    driver. The latter was full of pluck, and so was his passenger.
    At the driver's call Judge Mott swung himself out, clambered to
    the box and seized the reins of the team, and away they
    plunged, through the racing mob of skeletons and under a
    hurtling storm of missiles. The stricken driver had sunk down
    on the boot as soon as he was wounded, but had held on to the
    reins and said he would manage to keep hold of them until
    relieved.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    And after they were taken from his relaxing grasp, he lay with
    his head between Judge Mott's feet, and tranquilly gave
    directions about the road; he said he believed he could live
    till the miscreants were outrun and left behind, and that if he
    managed that, the main difficulty would be at an end, and then
    if the Judge drove so and so (giving directions about bad
    places in the road, and general course) he would reach the next
    station without trouble. The Judge distanced the enemy and at
    last rattled up to the station and knew that the night's perils
    were done; but there was no comrade-in-arms for him to rejoice
    with, for the soldierly driver was dead.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    Let us forget that we have been saying harsh things about the
    Overland drivers, now. The disgust which the Goshoots gave me,
    a disciple of Cooper and a worshipper of the Red Man--even of
    the scholarly savages in the "Last of the Mohicans" who are
    fittingly associated with backwoodsmen who divide each sentence
    into two equal parts: one part critically grammatical, refined
    and choice of language, and the other part just such an attempt
    to talk like a hunter or a mountaineer, as a Broadway clerk
    might make after eating an edition of Emerson Bennett's works
    and studying frontier life at the Bowery Theatre a couple of
    weeks--I say that the nausea which the Goshoots gave me, an
    Indian worshipper, set me to examining authorities, to see if
    perchance I had been over-estimating the Red Man while viewing
    him through the mellow moonshine of romance. The revelations
    that came were disenchanting. It was curious to see how quickly
    the paint and tinsel fell away from him and left him
    treacherous, filthy and repulsive--and how quickly the
    evidences accumulated that wherever one finds an Indian tribe
    he has only found Goshoots more or less modified by
    circumstances and surroundings--but Goshoots, after all. They
    deserve pity, poor creatures; and they can have mine--at this
    distance. Nearer by, they never get anybody's.

    <a name="g" id="g">So Johnny K-- and I</a> devoted our time to
    amusement. He was the young son of an Ohio nabob and was out
    there for recreation. He got it. We had heard a world of talk
    about the marvellous beauty of Lake Tahoe, and finally
    curiosity drove us thither to see it. Three or four members of
    the Brigade had been there and located some timber lands on its
    shores and stored up a quantity of provisions in their camp. We
    strapped a couple of blankets on our shoulders and took an axe
    apiece and started--for we intended to take up a wood ranch or
    so ourselves and become wealthy. We were on foot. The reader
    will find it advantageous to go horseback. We were told that
    the distance was eleven miles. We tramped a long time on level
    ground, and then toiled laboriously up a mountain about a
    thousand miles high and looked over. No lake there. We
    descended on the other side, crossed the valley and toiled up
    another mountain three or four thousand miles high, apparently,
    and looked over again. No lake yet. We sat down tired and
    perspiring, and hired a couple of Chinamen to curse those
    people who had beguiled us. Thus refreshed, we presently
    resumed the march with renewed vigor and determination. We
    plodded on, two or three hours longer, and at last the Lake
    burst upon us--a noble sheet of blue water lifted six thousand
    three hundred feet above the level of the sea, and walled in by
    a rim of snow-clad mountain peaks that towered aloft full three
    thousand feet higher still! It was a vast oval, and one would
    have to use up eighty or a hundred good miles in traveling
    around it. As it lay there with the shadows of the mountains
    brilliantly photographed upon its still surface I thought it
    must surely be the fairest picture the whole earth affords.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    We found the small skiff belonging to the Brigade boys, and
    without loss of time set out across a deep bend of the lake
    toward the landmarks that signified the locality of the camp. I
    got Johnny to row--not because I mind exertion myself, but
    because it makes me sick to ride backwards when I am at work.
    But I steered. A three-mile pull brought us to the camp just as
    the night fell, and we stepped ashore very tired and wolfishly
    hungry. In a "cache" among the rocks we found the provisions
    and the cooking utensils, and then, all fatigued as I was, I
    sat down on a boulder and superintended while Johnny gathered
    wood and cooked supper. Many a man who had gone through what I
    had, would have wanted to rest.

    <a name="h" id="h">We slept in</a> the sand close to the
    water's edge, between two protecting boulders, which took care
    of the stormy night-winds for us. We never took any paregoric
    to make us sleep. At the first break of dawn we were always up
    and running foot-races to tone down excess of physical vigor
    and exuberance of spirits. That is, Johnny was--but I held his
    hat. While smoking the pipe of peace after breakfast we watched
    the sentinel peaks put on the glory of the sun, and followed
    the conquering light as it swept down among the shadows, and
    set the captive crags and forests free. We watched the tinted
    pictures grow and brighten upon the water till every little
    detail of forest, precipice and pinnacle was wrought in and
    finished, and the miracle of the enchanter complete. Then to
    "business."

  <blockquote>
    That is, drifting around in the boat. We were on the north
    shore. There, the rocks on the bottom are sometimes gray,
    sometimes white. This gives the marvelous transparency of the
    water a fuller advantage than it has elsewhere on the lake. We
    usually pushed out a hundred yards or so from shore, and then
    lay down on the thwarts, in the sun, and let the boat drift by
    the hour whither it would. We seldom talked. It interrupted the
    Sabbath stillness, and marred the dreams the luxurious rest and
    indolence brought. The shore all along was indented with deep,
    curved bays and coves, bordered by narrow sand-beaches; and
    where the sand ended, the steep mountain-sides rose right up
    aloft into space--rose up like a vast wall a little out of the
    perpendicular, and thickly wooded with tall pines.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    So singularly clear was the water, that where it was only
    twenty or thirty feet deep the bottom was so perfectly distinct
    that the boat seemed floating in the air! Yes, where it was
    even <i>eighty</i> feet deep. Every little pebble was distinct,
    every speckled trout, every hand's-breadth of sand. Often, as
    we lay on our faces, a granite boulder, as large as a village
    church, would start out of the bottom apparently, and seem
    climbing up rapidly to the surface, till presently it
    threatened to touch our faces, and we could not resist the
    impulse to seize an oar and avert the danger. But the boat
    would float on, and the boulder descend again, and then we
    could see that when we had been exactly above it, it must still
    have been twenty or thirty feet below the surface. Down through
    the transparency of these great depths, the water was not
    <i>merely</i> transparent, but dazzlingly, brilliantly so. All
    objects seen through it had a bright, strong vividness, not
    only of outline, but of every minute detail, which they would
    not have had when seen simply through the same depth of
    atmosphere. So empty and airy did all spaces seem below us, and
    so strong was the sense of floating high aloft in
    mid-nothingness, that we called these boat-excursions
    "balloon-voyages."
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    We fished a good deal, but we did not average one fish a week.
    We could see trout by the thousand winging about in the
    emptiness under us, or sleeping in shoals on the bottom, but
    they would not bite--they could see the line too plainly,
    perhaps.

    We took up various claims, and <i>commenced</i> shafts and

    could seize our property after the expiration of ten days. We
    were always hunting up new claims and doing a little work on
    them and then waiting for a buyer--who never came. We never
    found any ore that would yield more than fifty dollars a ton;
    and as the mills charged fifty dollars a ton for <i>working</i>
    ore and extracting the silver, our pocket-money melted steadily
    away and none returned to take its place. We lived in a little
    cabin and cooked for ourselves; and altogether it was a hard
    life, though a hopeful one--for we never ceased to expect
    fortune and a customer to burst upon us some day.

    "It's a blind lead, for a million!--hanging wall--foot
    wall--clay casings--everything complete!" He swung his hat and
    gave three cheers, and I cast doubt to the winds and chimed in
    with a will. For I was worth a million dollars, and did not
    care "whether school kept or not!"
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    But perhaps I ought to explain. A "blind lead" is a lead or
    ledge that does not "crop out" above the surface. A miner does
    not know where to look for such leads, but they are often
    stumbled upon by accident in the course of driving a tunnel or
    sinking a shaft. Higbie knew the Wide West rock perfectly well,
    and the more he had examined the new developments the more he
    was satisfied that the ore could not have come from the Wide
    West vein. And so had it occurred to him alone, of all the
    camp, that there was a blind lead down in the shaft, and that
    even the Wide West people themselves did not suspect it. He was
    right. When he went down the shaft, he found that the blind
    lead held its independent way through the Wide West vein,
    cutting it diagonally, and that it was enclosed in its own
    well-defined casing-rocks and clay. Hence it was public
    property. Both leads being perfectly well defined, it was easy
    for any miner to see which one belonged to the Wide West and
    which did not.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    We thought it well to have a strong friend, and therefore we
    brought the foreman of the Wide West to our cabin that night
    and revealed the great surprise to him. Higbie said:
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    "We are going to take possession of this blind lead, record it
    and establish ownership, and then forbid the Wide West company
    to take out any more of the rock. You cannot help your company
    in this matter--nobody can help them. I will go into the shaft
    with you and prove to your entire satisfaction that it
    <i>is</i> a blind lead. Now we propose to take you in with us,
    and claim the blind lead in our three names. What do you say?"
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    What could a man say who had an opportunity to simply stretch
    forth his hand and take possession of a fortune without risk of
    any kind and without wronging any one or attaching the least
    taint of dishonor to his name? He could only say, "Agreed."

    Once I dined in San Francisco with the family of a pioneer, and
    talked with his daughter, a young lady whose first experience
    in San Francisco was an adventure, though she herself did not
    remember it, as she was only two or three years old at the
    time. Her father said that, after landing from the ship, they
    were walking up the street, a servant leading the party with
    the little girl in her arms. And presently a huge miner,
    bearded, belted, spurred, and bristling with deadly
    weapons--just down from a long campaign in the mountains,
    evidently-barred the way, stopped the servant, and stood
    gazing, with a face all alive with gratification and
    astonishment. Then he said, reverently:

  <blockquote>
    "Well, if it ain't a child!" And then he snatched a little
    leather sack out of his pocket and said to the servant:

  <blockquote>
    "There's a hundred and fifty dollars in dust, there, and I'll
    give it to you to let me kiss the child!"

    That anecdote is <i>true</i>.

  <blockquote>
    But see how things change. Sitting at that dinner-table,
    listening to that anecdote, if I had offered double the money
    for the privilege of kissing the same child, I would have been
    refused. Seventeen added years have far more than doubled the
    price.
