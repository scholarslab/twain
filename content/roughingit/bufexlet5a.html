      In one little corner of California is found a species of
      mining which is seldom or never mentioned in print. It is
      called "pocket-mining" and I am not aware that any of it is
      done outside of that little corner. The gold is not evenly
      distributed through the surface dirt, as in ordinary placer
      mines, but is collected in little spots, and they are very
      wide apart and exceedingly hard to find, but when you do find
      one you reap a rich and sudden harvest. There are not now
      more than 20 pocket miners in that entire little region. I
      think I know every one of them personally. I have known one
      of them to hunt patiently about the hill sides every day for
      8 months without finding gold enough to make a snuff-box --
      his grocery bill running up relentlessly all the time -- and
      then I have seen him find a pocket and take out of it a
      thousand dollars in two dips of his shovel. I have seen him
      take out $3000 in two hours, and go and pay up every cent of
      his indebtedness, then enter on a dazzling spree that
      finished the last of his treasure before the night was gone.
      And the next day he bought his groceries on credit as usual,
      and shouldered his pan and shovel and went off to the hills
      hunting pockets again happy and content. This is perhaps the
      most fascinating of all the different kinds of mining, and
      furnishes a very handsome percentage of victims to the
      lunatic asylum. Honest toil and moderate gains in shops and
      on farms have their virtues and their advantages. When a man
      consents to seek for sudden riches he does it at his peril.
      [No charge.]<br />
      <br />
      Pocket hunting is an ingenious process. You take a spadeful
      of earth from the hill-side and put it in a large tin pan and
      dissolve and wash it gradually away till nothing is left but
      a teaspoonful of fine sediment. Whatever gold was in that
      earth has remained, because, being the heaviest, it has
      sought the bottom. Among the sediment you will find half a
      dozen shining particles no larger than pin-heads. You are
      delighted. You move off to one side and wash another pan. If
      you find gold again, you move to one side further, and wash a
      third pan. If you find <i>no</i> gold this time, you are
      delighted again, because you know you are on the right scent.
      You lay an imaginary plan, shaped like a fan, with its handle
      up the hill -- for just where the end of the handle is, you
      argue that the rich deposit lies hidden, whose vagrant grains
      of gold have escaped and been washed down the hill, spreading
      farther and farther apart as they wandered. And so you
      proceed up the hill, washing the earth and narrowing your
      lines every time the absence of gold in the pan shows that
      you are outside the spread of the fan; and at last 20 yards
      up the hill your lines have converged to a point -- a single
      foot from that point you cannot find any gold. Your breath
      comes short and quick, you are feverish with excitement; the
      dinner-bell may ring its clapper off, you pay no attention;
      friends may die, weddings transpire, houses burn down, they
      are nothing to you; you sweat and dig and delve with a
      frantic interest -- and all at once you strike it! Up comes a
      spade full of earth and quartz that is all lovely with soiled
      lumps and leaves and sprays of gold. Sometimes that one
      spadeful is all -- $500. Sometimes the nest contains $10,000,
      and it takes you three or four days to get it all out. The
      pocket-miners tell of one nest that yielded $60,000 and two
      men exhausted it in two weeks, and then sold the ground for
      $10,000 to a party who never got $300 out of it
      afterward.<br />
      <br />
      The hogs are good pocket hunters. All the summer they root
      around the bushes, and turn up a thousand little piles of
      dirt, and then the miners long for the rains; for the rains
      beat upon these little piles and wash them down and expose
      the gold, possibly right over a pocket. Two pockets were
      found in this way by the same man in one day. One had $5,000
      in it and the other $8,000. That man could appreciate it, for
      he hadn't had a cent for about a year.<br />
      <br />
      In Tuolumus lived two miners who used to go to the
      neighboring village in the afternoon and return every night
      with household supplies. Part of the distance they traversed
      a trail, and nearly always sat down to rest on a great
      boulder that lay beside the path. In the course of thirteen
      years they had worn that boulder tolerably smooth, sitting on
      it. By and by two vagrant Mexicans came along and occupied
      the seat. They began to amuse themselves by chipping off
      flakes from the boulder with a sledge-hammer. They examined
      one of these flakes and found it rich with gold. That boulder
      paid them $800 afterward. But the aggravating circumstance
      was that these "Greasers" knew that there must be more gold
      where that boulder came from, and so they went panning up the
      hill and found what was probably the richest pocket that
      region has yet produced. It took three months to exhaust it,
      and it yielded $120,000. The two American miners who used to
      sit on the boulder are poor yet, and they take turn about in
      getting up early in the morning to curse those Mexicans --
      and when it comes down to pure ornamental cursing, the native
      American miner is gifted above the sons of men.<br />
      <br />
      I have dwelt at some length upon this matter of pocket
      mining, because it is a subject that is seldom referred to in
      print, and therefore I judged that it would have for the
      reader that interest which naturally attaches to a
      novelty.<br /></td>
