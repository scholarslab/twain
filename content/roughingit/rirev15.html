    <p>[<i>This piece, and the <a href="rirev16.html">next one</a>, published in another Little Rock newspaper on the same date, look like reviews.  But their language is almost entirely "borrowed" from the publisher's publicity materials that were included in the <a href="prospect/riproshp.html">sales prospectus</a> for the book.  Both name the local subscription agent "now in the city" taking orders for it (though his name changes from Roadright to Roadnight), who may have paid for their insertion in the papers, which would make them ads rather than reviews.</i>]

        <p>We have before us a copy of this new book by that great humorist, Mark Twain.  It is a companion volume to "Innocents Abroad," and, like it, is filled with descriptions of people and things seen by the author himself, with his own eyes, which differ in some respects from those of others.  A hasty glance at it convinces us that it is suited to the tastes of the old, the young, the rich, the poor, the sad and the gay.  Brimful of characteristic humor, running over with smile-persuading and laughter-forcing incidents and ideas, those who seek amusement for idle moments, will find in this book an inexhaustible vein to work, full of the purest ore.  Mr. J. E. Roadright, the agent, is now in the city, soliciting subscriptions to this work.</p>
