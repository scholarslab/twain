      <br />
      Mono Lake or the Dead Sea of California, is one of her most
      extraordinary curiosities, but being situated in a very
      out-of-the-way corner of the country, and away up among the
      eternal snows of the Sierras, it is little known and very
      seldom visited. A mining excitement carried me there once,
      and I spent several months in its vicinity. It lies in a
      lifeless, treeless, hideous desert, 8000 feet above the level
      of the sea, and is guarded by mountains 2000 feet higher,
      whose summits are hidden always in the clouds. This solemn,
      silent, sailless sea -- this lonely tenant of the loneliest
      spot on earth -- is little graced with the picturesque. It is
      an unpretending expanse of greyish water, about a hundred
      miles in circumference, with two islands in its centre, mere
      upheavals of rent, and scorched and blistered lava, snowed
      over with grey banks and drifts of pumice stone and ashes,
      the winding sheet of the dead volcano, whose vast crater the
      lake has seized upon and occupied.<br />
      <br />
      The lake is 200 feet deep, and its sluggish waters are so
      strong with alkali that if you only dip the most hopelessly
      soiled garment into them once or twice, and wring it out, it
      will be found as clean as if it had been through your ablest
      washerwoman's hands. While we camped there our laundry work
      was easy. We tied the week's washing astern of our boat, and
      sailed a quarter of a mile, and the job was complete, all to
      the wringing out. If we threw the water on our heads and gave
      them a rub or so, the white lather would pile up three inches
      high. This water is not good for bruised places and abrasions
      of the skin. We had a valuable dog. He had raw places on him.
      He had more raw places on him than sound ones. He was the
      rawest dog I almost ever saw. He jumped overboard one day to
      get away from the flies. But it was bad judgment. In his
      condition, it would have been just as comfortable to jump
      into the fire. The alkali water nipped him in all the raw
      places simultaneously, and he struck out for the shore with
      considerable interest. He yelped and barked and howled as he
      went -- and by the time he got to the shore there was no bark
      to him -- for he had barked the bark all out of his inside,
      and the alkali water had cleaned the bark all off his
      outside, and he probably wished he had never embarked in any
      such enterprise. He ran round and round in a circle, and
      pawed the earth and clawed the air, and threw double
      summersets, sometimes backwards and sometimes forwards, in
      the most frantic and extraordinary manner. He was not a
      demonstrative dog, as a general thing, but rather of a grave
      and serious turn of mind, and I never saw him take so much
      interest in any thing before. He finally struck out over the
      mountains, at a gait which we estimated at about 250 miles an
      hour, and he is going yet. This was about five years ago. We
      look for what is left of him along here every day.<br />
      <br />
      A white man cannot drink the water of Mono Lake, for it is
      nearly pure lye. It is said that the Indians in the vicinity
      drink it sometimes, though. It is not improbable, for they
      are among the purest liars I ever saw. [There will be no
      additional charge for this joke, except to parties requiring
      an explanation of it. This joke has received high
      commendation from some of the ablest minds of the age. Horace
      Greeley remarked to a friend of mine that if he were ever to
      make a joke like that, he would not desire to live any
      longer.]<br />
      <br />
      There are no fish in Mono Lake -- no frogs, no snakes, no
      pollywogs -- nothing, in fact, that goes to make life
      desirable. Millions of wild ducks and sea gulls swim about
      the surface, but no living thing exists <i>under</i> the
      surface, except a white feathery sort of worm, one-half an
      inch long, which looks like a bit of white thread frayed out
      at the sides. If you dip up a gallon of water, you will get
      about fifteen thousand of these. They give to the water a
      sort of grayish-white appearance. Then there is a fly, which
      looks something like our house fly. These settle on the beach
      to eat the worms that wash ashore -- and any time, you can
      see there a belt of flies an inch deep and six feet wide, and
      this belt extends clear around the lake -- a belt of flies
      one hundred miles long. If you throw a stone among them, they
      swarm up so thick that they look dense, like a cloud. You can
      hold them under water as long as you please -- they don't
      mind it -- they are only proud of it. When you let them go,
      they pop up to the surface as dry as a patent office report,
      and walk off as unconcernedly as if they had been educated
      especially with a view to affording instructive entertainment
      to man in that particular way. Providence leaves nothing to
      go by chance. All things have their uses and their part and
      proper place in Nature's economy. The ducks and gulls eat the
      flies, the flies eat the worms -- the Indians eat the flies
      -- the wild oats eat the Indians -- the white folks eat the
      wild oats when the crops fail -- and thus all things are
      lovely.<br />
      <br />
      Mono Lake is 150 miles in a straight line from the ocean --
      and between it and the ocean are one or two ranges of
      mountains -- yet thousands of sea-gulls go there every season
      to lay their eggs and rear their young. One would as soon
      expect to find sea-gulls in Tennessee. And in this connection
      let us observe another instance of Nature's wisdom. The
      islands in the lake being merely huge masses of lava, coated
      over with ashes and pumice stone, and utterly innocent of
      vegetation or anything that would burn; and the sea-gulls'
      eggs being entirely useless to any body unless they be
      cooked, Nature has provided an unfailing spring of boiling
      water on the largest island, and you can put your eggs in
      there, and in four minutes you can boil them as hard as any
      statement I have made during the past fifteen years. Within
      ten feet of the boiling spring is a spring of pure cold
      water, sweet and wholesome. So, in that island you get your
      board and washing free of charge -- and if nature had gone
      further and furnished a nice American hotel clerk who was
      crusty and disobliging, and didn't know any thing about the
      time tables, or the railroad routes -- or -- any thing -- and
      was proud of it -- I would not wish for a more desirable
      boarding house.<br />
      <br />
      Half a dozen little mountain brooks flow into Mono Lake, but
      not a stream of any kind flows out of it. It neither rises
      nor falls, apparently, and what it does with its surplus
      water is a dark and bloody mystery. All the rivers of Nevada
      sink into the earth mysteriously after they have run 100
      miles or so -- none of them flow to the sea, as is the
      fashion of rivers in all other lands.<br />
      <br />
      There are only two seasons in the region round about Mono
      Lake and these are, the breaking up of one Winter and the
      beginning of the next. More than once I have seen a perfectly
      blistering morning open up with the thermometer at ninety
      degrees at eight o'clock, and seen the snow fall fourteen
      inches deep and that same identical thermometer go down to
      forty-four degrees under shelter, before 9 o'clock at night.
      Under favorable circumstances it snows at least once in every
      single month in the year in the little town of Mono. So
      uncertain is the climate in Summer that a lady who goes out
      visiting cannot hope to be prepared for all emergencies
      unless she takes her fan under one arm and her snow shoes
      under the other. When they have a Fourth of July procession
      it generally snows on them, and they do say that as a general
      thing when a man calls for a brandy toddy there, the bar
      keeper chops it off with a hatchet and wraps it up in a
      paper, like maple sugar. And it is further reported that the
      old soakers haven't any teeth -- wore them out eating gin
      cocktails and brandy punches. I don't endorse that statement
      -- I simply give it for what it is worth -- and it is worth
      -- well, I should say, millions, to any man who can believe
      it without straining himself. But I do endorse the snow on
      the Fourth of July because I know that to be true.</td>
