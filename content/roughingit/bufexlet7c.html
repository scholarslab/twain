      Another curious feature about California life was the breed
      of desperadoes she reared and fostered on her soil and
      afterward distributed over adjacent Territories through her
      Vigilance Committees when she had had enough of their
      exploits. These men went armed to the teeth with monstrous
      revolvers, and preyed upon each other. Their slightest
      misunderstandings were settled on the spot by the bullet; but
      they very rarely molested peaceable citizens. They robbed and
      gambled and killed people for three or four years, and then
      "died with their boots on," as they phrased it; that is, they
      were killed themselves -- almost invariably -- and they never
      expected any other fate, and were very seldom
      disappointed.</td>

      There is something about the desperado-nature that is wholly
      unaccountable--at least it looks unaccountable. It is this.
      The true desperado is gifted with splendid courage, and yet
      he will take the most infamous advantage of his enemy; armed
      and free, he will stand up before a host and fight until he
      is shot all to pieces, and yet when he is under the gallows
      and helpless he will cry and plead like a child. Words are
      cheap, and it is easy to call Slade a coward (all executed
      men who do not "die game" are promptly called cowards by
      unreflecting people), and when we read of Slade that he "had
      so exhausted himself by tears, prayers and lamentations, that
      he had scarcely strength left to stand under the fatal beam,"
      the disgraceful word suggests itself in a moment--yet in
      frequently defying and inviting the vengeance of banded Rocky
      Mountain cut-throats by shooting down their comrades and
      leaders, and never offering to hide or fly, Slade showed that
      he was a man of peerless bravery. No coward would dare that.
      Many a notorious coward, many a chicken-livered poltroon,
      coarse, brutal, degraded, has made his dying speech without a
      quaver in his voice and been swung into eternity with what
      looked liked the calmest fortitude, and so we are justified
      in believing, from the low intellect of such a creature, that
      it was not <i>moral</i> courage that enabled him to do it.
      Then, if moral courage is not the requisite quality, what
      could it have been that this stout-hearted Slade
      lacked?--this bloody, desperate, kindly-mannered, urbane
      gentleman, who never hesitated to warn his most ruffianly
      enemies that he would kill them whenever or wherever he came
      across them next! I think it is a conundrum worth
      investigating.</td>
