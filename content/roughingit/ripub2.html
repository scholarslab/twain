          M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size=
          "-1">WAIN'S</font> new book is to be all about his
          experience in California and Nevada and coming to this
          coast by the Overland stages. It will be a volume of 600
          pages octavo. He has started in on it, but at last
          accounts was two days' journey the other side of Salt
          Lake with it; so we need not get excited here about the
          "chief amang us" for some time to come. His book will be
          out in April next.
