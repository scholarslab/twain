      <td>At the start of Chapter 62, MT briefly tells the story of
      how in 1866 he wound up satisfying his "vagabond instinct" by
      getting "a new berth and a delightful one" as a correspondent
      to the Sandwich Islands for the Sacramento
      <i>Union</i>.<br />
      <br />
      He stayed four months in the Islands (from March to June,
      1866), writing twenty-five letters for the <i>Union</i> that
      were published between April and November. His reports were
      widely read, and he may have tried revising them into a book
      in 1866-1867, even before the Quaker City excursion to
      Europe. He hadn't planned to use the Hawaiian experience in
      <i>Roughing It</i>, but he ran out of inspiration and
      material before reaching the length Bliss and subscription
      readers were expecting. Working either from his own scrapbook
      copies of the <i>Union</i> letters, or possibly from a book
      manuscript based on them that is now lost, he wound up using
      parts of thirteen letters in the fifteen Hawaiian chapters of
      <i>Roughing It</i>.<br />
      <br />

      read four representative letters here, along with an
      interactive feature that will allow you to compare his 1866
      newspaper reportage with his 1872 book: clicking on the
      <b><font size="-1">ROUGHING IT ICON</font></b> (<i>left</i>)
      whenever you see it will bring up a side-by-side comparison
      of the two texts, so you can see for yourself the kinds of
      revisions MT made. He relied heavily on the letters, but
      there are some patterns to be noticed in his revisions. It's
      especially interesting to see what he decided to omit,
      including kinds of humor that may have struck him as too
      coarse for a national book-buying audience. The biggest
      omission is the disappearance of "Mr. Brown." He was a figure
      whom MT's original newspaper readers knew well, accompanying
      MT to Europe in the <i>Alta</i> letters of 1867 as well as to
      the Sandwich Islands in these <i>Union</i> letters. "Mr.
      Brown" was (like "Mark Twain") an imaginary persona, less
      inhibited, more irascible, cruder than "Mark Twain" even at
      this early stage in his career. Some readers may regret his
      absence from MT's first two travel books.</td>
