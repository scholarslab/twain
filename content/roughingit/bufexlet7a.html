        One of California's curiosities the people in the States
        will some day become familiar with through the Pacific
        Railroad. I mean the Chinamen. California contains 70,000
        of them, and every ship brings more. There is a Chinese
        quarter in every city and village in California and Nevada,
        for Boards of Aldermen will not allow them to live all
        around town just wherever they choose to locate. This is
        not a hardship, for they prefer to herd together.<br />

        They are a people who fondly stick to their ancient
        customs. They dress in the quaint costumes their ancestors
        wore 500 years ago. They build temples, gaudy with gilding
        and hideous with staring idols, and there they worship
        after the fashion of their fathers. A strict record is kept
        by their chiefs of the name and residence of every
        Chinaman, and when he dies his body is sent back to China
        for burial -- for they can never get to their Heaven unless
        they start from China. And besides, Chinamen worship their
        ancestors, and they all want their share of worship after
        they are done with this world. Even when the Chinese
        government sells a shipload of degraded and criminal
        coolies to a Cuban or Sandwich Island planter, it is
        strictly stipulated that the body of every one of them must
        be sent back to China after death.<br />
        <br />
        The Chinamen being smart, shrewd people, take to some few
        of our commercial customs and virtues, but somehow we can't
        make great headway in the matter of civilizing them. We can
        teach them to gamble a little, but somehow we can't make
        them get drunk. It is discouraging -- because you can't
        regenerate a being that won't get drunk.<br />
        <br />
        The Chinaman is the most frugal, industrious and thrifty of
        all creatures. No matter how slender are the wages you pay
        him he will manage to lay up money. And Chinamen are the
        most gifted gardeners in the world. Give one of them a
        sandbank that would not support a lizard, and he will make
        it yield generous crops of vegetables. The Chinaman wastes
        <i>nothing</i>. Every thing has a value in his eyes. He
        gathers up all the cast-away rags and bones and bits of
        glass, and makes marketable articles of them. And he picks
        up all the old fruit cans you throw away and melts them up
        to get the tin and solder. When a white man discards a gold
        placer as no longer worth anything, the patient Chinaman,
        always satisfied with small profits, and never in a hurry
        to get rich, takes possession and works it contentedly for
        years.<br />
        <br />
        The Chinaman makes a good cook, a good washerwoman, a good
        chambermaid, a good gardener, a good banker's clerk, a good
        miner, a good railroad laborer, a good <i>anything</i> you
        choose to put him at -- for these people are all educated,
        they are all good accountants, they are very quiet and
        peaceable, they never disturb themselves about politics;
        they are so tractable, quick, smart, and naturally handy
        and ingenious, that you can teach them anything; they have
        no jealousies; they never lose a moment, never require
        watching to keep them at work; they are gifted with a world
        of patience, endurance and contentment. They are the best
        laboring class America has ever seen -- and they do not
        care a cent who is President. They are miserably abused by
        the laws of California, but that sort of thing will cease,
        some day. It was found just about impossible to build the
        California end of the Pacific Railroad with white men at $3
        per day and take care of all the broils and fights and
        strikes; but they put on Chinamen at a dollar a day and
        "find" themselves, and <i>they</i> built it without fights
        or strikes or anything, and saved the bulk of their wages,
        too. You will have these long-tailed toilers among you in
        "the States" some day, but you will find them right easy to
        get along with -- and you will like them, too, because they
        will stand a heap of abuse. You will find them ever so
        convenient, because when you get mad you can snatch a club
        and go out and take satisfaction out of a Chinaman. The
        native American Negro is getting so insolent, now, that the
        patriot from Ireland cannot take a little recreation out of
        him without getting into trouble. So the Chinaman will
        afford a needed relief.

      <br />
      OF course there was a large Chinese population in
      Virginia--it is the case with every town and city on the
      Pacific coast. They are a harmless race when white men either
      let them alone or treat them no worse than dogs; in fact they
      are almost entirely harmless anyhow, for they seldom think of
      resenting the vilest insults or the cruelest injuries. They
      are quiet, peaceable, tractable, free from drunkenness, and
      they are as industrious as the day is long. A disorderly
      Chinaman is rare, and a lazy one does not exist. So long as a
      Chinaman has strength to use his hands he needs no support
      from anybody; white men often complain of want of work, but a
      Chinaman offers no such complaint; he always manages to find
      something to do. He is a great convenience to everybody--even
      to the worst class of white men, for he bears the most of
      their sins, suffering fines for their petty thefts,
      imprisonment for their robberies, and death for their
      murders. Any white man can swear a Chinaman's life away in
      the courts, but no Chinaman can testify against a white man.
      Ours is the "land of the free"--nobody denies that--nobody
      challenges it. [Maybe it is because we won't let other people
      testify.] As I write, news comes that in broad daylight in
      San Francisco, some boys have stoned an inoffensive Chinaman
      to death, and that although a large crowd witnessed the
      shameful deed, no one interfered.<br />
      <br />
      There are seventy thousand (and possibly one hundred
      thousand) Chinamen on the Pacific coast. There were about a
      thousand in Virginia. They were penned into a "Chinese
      quarter"--a thing which they do not particularly object to,
      as they are fond of herding together. Their buildings were of
      wood; usually only one story high, and set thickly together
      along streets scarcely wide enough for a wagon to pass
      through. Their quarter was a little removed from the rest of
      the town. The chief employment of Chinamen in towns is to
      wash clothing. They always send a bill, like this below,
      pinned to the clothes. It is mere ceremony, for it does not
      enlighten the customer much. Their price for washing was
      $2.50 per dozen--rather cheaper than white people could
      afford to wash for at that time. A very common sign on the
      Chinese houses was: "See Yup, Washer and Ironer"; "Hong Wo,
      Washer"; "Sam Sing &amp; Ah Hop, Washing." The house
      servants, cooks, etc., in California and Nevada, were chiefly
      Chinamen. There were few white servants and no Chinawomen so
      employed. Chinamen make good house servants, being quick,
      obedient, patient, quick to learn and tirelessly industrious.
      They do not need to be taught a thing twice, as a general
      thing. They are imitative. If a Chinaman were to see his
      master break up a centre table, in a passion, and kindle a
      fire with it, that Chinaman would be likely to resort to the
      furniture for fuel forever afterward.<br />
      <br />
      All Chinamen can read, write and cipher with easy
      facility--pity but all our petted <i>voters</i> could. In
      California they rent little patches of ground and do a deal
      of gardening. They will raise surprising crops of vegetables
      on a sand pile. They waste nothing. What is rubbish to a
      Christian, a Chinaman carefully preserves and makes useful in
      one way or another. He gathers up all the old oyster and
      sardine cans that white people throw away, and procures
      marketable tin and solder from them by melting. He gathers up
      old bones and turns them into manure. In California he gets a
      living out of old mining claims that white men have abandoned
      as exhausted and worthless--and then the officers come down
      on him once a month with an exorbitant swindle to which the
      legislature has given the broad, general name of "foreign"
      mining tax, but it is usually inflicted on no foreigners but
      Chinamen. This swindle has in some cases been repeated once
      or twice on the same victim in the course of the same
      month--but the public treasury was no additionally enriched
      by it, probably.<br />
      <br />
      Chinamen hold their dead in great reverence--they worship
      their departed ancestors, in fact. Hence, in China, a man's
      front yard, back yard, or any other part of his premises, is
      made his family burying ground, in order that he may visit
      the graves at any and all times. Therefore that huge empire
      is one mighty cemetery; it is ridged and wringled from its
      centre to its circumference with graves--and inasmuch as
      every foot of ground must be made to do its utmost, in China,
      lest the swarming population suffer for food, the very graves
      are cultivated and yield a harvest, custom holding this to be
      no dishonor to the dead. Since the departed are held in such
      worshipful reverence, a Chinaman cannot bear that any
      indignity be offered the places where they sleep. Mr.
      Burlingame said that herein lay China's bitter opposition to
      railroads; a road could not be built anywhere in the empire
      without disturbing the graves of their ancestors or
      friends.<br />
      <br />
      A Chinaman hardly believes he could enjoy the hereafter
      except his body lay in his beloved China; also, he desires to
      receive, himself, after death, that worship with which he has
      honored his dead that preceded him. Therefore, if he visits a
      foreign country, he makes arrangements to have his bones
      returned to China in case he dies; if he hires to go to a
      foreign country on a labor contract, there is always a
      stipulation that his body shall be taken back to China if he
      dies; if the government sells a gang of Coolies to a
      foreigner for the usual five-year term, it is specified in
      the contract that their bodies shall be restored to China in
      case of death. On the Pacific coast the Chinamen all belong
      to one or another of several great companies or
      organizations, and these companies keep track of their
      members, register their names, and ship their bodies home
      when they die. The See Yup Company is held to be the largest
      of these. The Ning Yeong Company is next, and numbers
      eighteen thousand members on the coast. Its headquarters are
      at San Francisco, where it has a costly temple, several great
      officers (one of whom keeps regal state in seclusion and
      cannot be approached by common humanity), and a numerous
      priesthood. In it I was shown a register of its members, with
      the dead and the date of their shipment to China duly marked.
      Every ship that sails from San Francisco carries away a heavy
      freight of Chinese corpses--or did, at least, until the
      legislature, with an ingenious refinement of Christian
      cruelty, forbade the shipments, as a neat underhanded way of
      deterring Chinese immigration. The bill was offered, whether
      it passed or not. It is my impression that it passed. There
      was another bill--it became a law--compelling every incoming
      Chinaman to be vaccinated on the wharf and pay a duly
      appointed quack (no decent doctor would defile himself with
      such legalized robbery) ten dollars for it. As few importers
      of Chinese would want to go to an expense like that, the
      law-makers thought this would be another heavy blow to
      Chinese immigration.</td>
