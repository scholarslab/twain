        <p>"Trifles be--blowed! You get nipped by one of them
        scorpions once, and see how you like it! There was Mrs.
        Jones, swabbing her face with a sponge; she felt something
        grab her cheek; she dropped the sponge and out popped a
        scorpion an inch and a half long! Well, she just got up and
        danced the Highland fling for two hours and a half--and
        yell!--why, you could have heard her from Lu-wow to
        Hoolahoola, with the wind fair! and for three days she
        soaked her cheek in brandy and salt, and it swelled up as
        big as your two fists. And you want to know what made me
        light out of bed so sudden last night? Only a
        'santipede'--nothing, only a &lsquo;santipede,&rsquo; with
        forty-two legs on a side, and every foot hot enough to burn
        a hole through a rawhide. Don't you know one of them things
        grabbed Miss Boone's foot when she was riding one day? He
        was hid in the stirrup, and just clamped himself around her
        foot and sunk his fangs plum through her shoe; and she just
        throwed her whole soul into one war whoop and then fainted.
        And she didn't get out of bed nor set that foot on the
        floor again for three weeks. And how did Captain Godfrey
        always get off so easy? Why, because he always carried a
        bottle full of scorpions and santipedes soaked in alcohol,
        and whenever he got bit he bathed the place with that
        devilish mixture or took a drink out of it, I don't
        recollect which. And how did he have to do once, when he
        hadn't his bottle along? He had to cut out the bite with
        his knife and fill up the hole with arnica, and then prop
        his mouth open with the bootjack to keep from getting the
        lockjaw. Oh, fill me up about this lovely country! You can
        go on writing that slop about balmy breezes and fragrant
        flowers, and all that sort of truck, but you're not going
        to leave out them santipedes and things for want of being
        reminded of it, you know."</p>

        <p>It was such ecstacy to dream, and dream--till you got a
        bite. A scorpion bite. Then the first duty was to get up
        out of the grass and kill the scorpion; and the next to
        bathe the bitten place with alcohol or brandy; and the next
        to resolve to keep out of the grass in future. Then came an
        adjournment to the bed-chamber and the pastime of writing
        up the day's journal with one hand and the destruction of
        mosquitoes with the other--a whole community of them at a
        slap. Then, observing an enemy approaching,--a hairy
        tarantula on stilts--why not set the spittoon on him? It is
        done, and the projecting ends of his paws give a luminous
        idea of the magnitude of his reach. Then to bed and become
        a promenade for a centipede with forty-two legs on a side
        and every foot hot enough to burn a hole through a
        raw-hide. More soaking with alcohol, and a resolution to
        examine the bed before entering it, in future. Then wait,
        and suffer, till all the mosquitoes in the neighborhood
        have crawled in under the bar, then slip out quickly, shut
        them in and sleep peacefully on the floor till morning.
        Meantime it is comforting to curse the tropics in
        occasional wakeful intervals.</p>
