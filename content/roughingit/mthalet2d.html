        <p>The popular-song nuisance follows us here. In San
        Francisco it used to be "Just Before the Battle, Mother,"
        every night and all night long. Then it was "When Johnny
        Comes Marching Home." After that it was "Wearin' of the
        Green." And last and most dreadful of all, came that
        calamity of "While We Were Marching Through Georgia." It
        was the last thing I heard when the ship sailed, and it
        gratified me to think I should hear it no more for months.
        And now, here at dead of night, at the very outpost and
        fag-end of the world, on a little rock in the middle of a
        limitless ocean, a pack of dark-skinned savages are
        tramping down the street singing it with a vim and an
        energy that make my hair rise!--singing it in their own
        barbarous tongue! They have got the tune to perfection--
        otherwise I never would have suspected that "<i>Waikiki
        lantani oe Kaa hooly hooly wawhoo</i>" means, "While We
        Were Marching Through Georgia." If it would have been all
        the same to General Sherman, I wish he had gone around by
        the way of the Gulf of Mexico, instead of marching through
        Georgia.</p>

        <p>It is time to close this day's record--bed time. As I
        prepare for sleep, a rich voice rises out of the still
        night, and, far as this ocean rock is toward the ends of
        the earth, I recognize a familiar home air. But the words
        seem somewhat out of joint:</p>

        <blockquote>
          "Waikiki lantoni &oelig; Kaa hooly hooly wawhoo."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Translated, that means "When we were marching through
        Georgia."</p>
