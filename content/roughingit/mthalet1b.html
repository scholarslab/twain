        <br />

        <p>The further I traveled through the town the better I
        liked it. Every step revealed a new contrast--disclosed
        something I was unaccustomed to. In place of the grand
        mud-colored brown stone fronts of San Francisco, I saw neat
        white cottages, with green window shutters; in place of
        front yards like billiard tables with iron fences around
        them, I saw those cottages surrounded by ample yards, about
        like Portsmouth Square (as to size), thickly clad with
        green grass, and shaded by tall trees, through whose dense
        foliage the sun could scarcely penetrate; in place of the
        customary infernal geranium languishing in dust and general
        debility on tin-roofed rear additions or in bedroom
        windows, I saw luxurious banks and thickets of flowers,
        fresh as a meadow after a rain, and glowing with the
        richest dyes; in place of the dingy horrors of the
        "Willows," and the painful sharp-pointed shrubbery of that
        funny caricature of nature which they call "South Park," I
        saw huge-bodied, wide-spreading forest trees, with strange
        names and stranger appearance--trees that cast a shadow
        like a thundercloud, and were able to stand alone without
        being tied to green poles; in place of those vile,
        tiresome, stupid, everlasting goldfish, wiggling around in
        glass globes and assuming all shades and degrees of
        distortion through the magnifying and diminishing qualities
        of their transparent prison houses, I saw cats--Tom cats,
        Mary Ann cats, long-tailed cats, bobtail cats, blind cats,
        one-eyed cats, walleyed cats, cross-eyed cats, gray cats,
        black cats, white cats, yellow cats, striped cats, spotted
        cats, tame cats, wild cats, singed cats, individual cats,
        groups of cats, platoons of cats, companies of cats,
        regiments of cats, armies of cats, multitudes of cats,
        millions of cats, and all of them sleek, fat, lazy, and
        sound asleep; in place of roughs and rowdies staring and
        blackguarding on the corners, I saw long-haired,
        saddle-colored Sandwich Island maidens sitting on the
        ground in the shade of corner houses, gazing indolently at
        whatever or whoever happened along; instead of that
        wretched cobblestone pavement nuisance, I walked on a firm
        foundation of coral, built up from the bottom of the sea by
        the absurd but persevering insect of that name, with a
        light layer of lava and cinders overlying the coral,
        belched up out of fathomless hell long ago through the
        seared and blackened crater that stands dead and cold and
        harmless yonder in the distance now; instead of cramped and
        crowded streetcars, I met dusky native women sweeping by,
        free as the wind, on fleet horses and astraddle, with gaudy
        riding sashes streaming like banners behind them; instead
        of the combined stenches of Sacramento Street, Chinadom,
        and Brannan Street slaughterhouses, I breathed the balmy
        fragrance of jessamine, oleander, and the Pride of India;
        in place of the hurry and bustle and noisy confusion of San
        Francisco, I moved in the midst of a summer calm as
        tranquil as dawn in the Garden of Eden; in place of our
        familiar skirting sand hills and the placid bay, I saw on
        the one side a framework of tall, precipitous mountains
        close at hand, clad in refreshing green, and cleft by deep,
        cool, chasmlike valleys--and in front the grand sweep of
        the ocean; a brilliant, transparent green near the shore,
        bound and bordered by a long white line of foamy spray
        dashing against the reef, and further out the dead blue
        water of the deep sea, flecked with "white caps," and in
        the far horizon a single, lonely sail--</p>

        <p>The further I traveled throught the town the better I
        liked it. Every step revealed a new contrast--disclosed
        something I was unaccustomed to. In place of the grand
        mud-colored brown fronts of San Francisco, I saw dwellings
        built of straw, adobies, and cream-colored
        pebble-and-shell-conglomerated coral, cut into oblong
        blocks and laid in cement; also a great number of neat
        white cottages, with green window-shutters; in place of
        front yards like billiard-tables with iron fences around
        them, I saw these homes surrounded by ample yards, thickly
        clad with green grass, and shaded by tall trees, through
        whose dense foliage the sun could scarcely penetrate; in
        place of the customary geranium, calla lily, etc.,
        languishing in dust and general debility, I saw luxurious
        banks and thickets of flowers, fresh as a meadow after a
        rain, and glowing with the richest dyes; in place of the
        dingy horrors of San Francisco's pleasure grove, the
        "Willows," I saw huge-bodied, wide-spreading forest trees,
        with strange names and stranger appearance--trees that cast
        a shadow like a thunder-cloud, and were able to stand alone
        without being tied to green poles; in place of gold fish,
        wiggling around in glass globes, assuming countless shades
        and degrees of distortion through the magnifying and
        diminishing qualities of their transparent prison houses, I
        saw cats--Tom-cats, Mary Ann cats, long-tailed cats,
        bob-tailed cats, blind cats, one-eyed cats, wall-eyed cats,
        cross-eyed cats, gray cats, black cats, white cats, yellow
        cats, striped cats, spotted cats, tame cats, wild cats,
        singed cats, individual cats, groups of cats, platoons of
        cats, companies of cats, regiments of cats, armies of cats,
        multitudes of cats, millions of cats, and all of them
        sleek, fat, lazy and sound asleep.</p>

        <p>I looked on a multitude of people, some white, in white
        coats, vests, pantaloons, even white cloth shoes, made
        snowy with chalk duly laid on every morning; but the
        majority of the people were almost as dark as
        negroes--women with comely features, fine black eyes,
        rounded forms, inclining to the voluptuous, clad in a
        single bright red or white garment that fell free and
        unconfined from shoulder to heel, long black hair falling
        loose, gypsy hats, encircled with wreaths of natural
        flowers of a brilliant carmine tint; plenty of dark men in
        various costumes, and some with nothing on but a battered
        stove-pipe hat tilted on the nose, and a very scant
        breech-clout;--certain smoke-dried children were clothed in
        nothing but sunshine--a very neat fitting and picturesque
        apparel indeed.</p>

        <p>In place of roughs and rowdies staring and blackguarding
        on the corners, I saw long-haired, saddle-colored Sandwich
        Island maidens sitting on the ground in the shade of corner
        houses, gazing indolently at whatever or whoever happened
        along; instead of wretched cobble-stone pavements, I walked
        on a firm foundation of coral, built up from the bottom of
        the sea by the absurd but persevering insect of that name,
        with a light layer of lava and cinders overlying the coral,
        belched up out of fathomless perdition long ago through the
        seared and blackened crater that stands dead and harmless
        in the distance now; instead of cramped and crowded
        street-cars, I met dusky native women sweeping by, free as
        the wind, on fleet horses and astride, with gaudy
        riding-sashes, streaming like banners behind them; instead
        of the combined stenches of Chinadom and Brannan street
        slaughter-houses, I breathed the balmy fragrance of
        jessamine, oleander, and the Pride of India; in place of
        the hurry and bustle and noisy confusion of San Francisco,
        I moved in the midst of a Summer calm as tranquil as dawn
        in the Garden of Eden; in place of the Golden City's
        skirting sand hills and the placid bay, I saw on the one
        side a frame-work of tall, precipitous mountains close at
        hand, clad in refreshing green, and cleft by deep, cool,
        chasm-like valleys--and in front the grand sweep of the
        ocean; a brilliant, transparent green near the shore, bound
        and bordered by a long white line of foamy spray dashing
        against the reef, and further out the dead blue water of
        the deep sea, flecked with "white caps," and in the far
        horizon a single, lonely sail--a mere accent-mark to
        emphasize a slumberous calm and a solitude that were
        without sound or limit. When the sun sunk down--the one
        intruder from other realms and persistent in suggestions of
        them--it was tranced luxury to sit in the perfumed air and
        forget that there was any world but these enchanted
        islands.</p>

        <p>It was such ecstacy to dream, and dream--till you got a
        bite. A scorpion bite. . . .</p>
