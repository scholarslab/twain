          Hartford, Mch. 4/73
        </center>Friend Bliss --<br />
        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Statement rec'd for quarter ending Mch 1,
        &amp; check for $1,656.69 for royalties on Innocents Abroad
        &amp; Roughing It.<br />
        <br />
        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; So Roughing It sells less than twice as many
        in a quarter as Innocents, a book which is getting gray
        with age. The fault is mainly in the engra-[<font size=
        "-1"><b><a href="javascript:Start('mtlet2eb2.jpg')">PAGE
        2</a></b></font>]vings &amp; paper, I think. That, &amp;
        the original lack of publicity. I believe I have learned,
        now, that if one don't secure publicity &amp; notoriety for
        a book the instant it is issued, no amount of hard work
        &amp; faithful advertising can accomplish it later on. When
        we look at what Roughing It sold in the first 3 &amp; 6
        months, we naturally argue that it would have sold full 3
        times as many if it had gotten the prompt &amp; early
        journalistic boost &amp; notoriety that the Innocents
        had.<br />
        <br />
        [<font size="-1"><b><a href=
        "javascript:Start('mtlet2eb3.jpg')">PAGE 3</a></b></font>]
        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Recognizing the importance, now, of this
        prompt notoriety (which I was <u>afraid</u> of &amp; didn't
        want until we were dead sure of 50,000 subscriptions to R.
        I. -- but which I am not afraid of now,) I have conceived a
        plan which will advertise the next book from Maine to the
        Marquesas free of expense before the proofsheets are all
        read. But I'll fix that myself.<br />
        <br />
        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Now Nast appears to be doing nothing in
        particular. I want him solitary &amp; alone to illustrate
        the next book, it being an essentially <u>American</u>
        book, [<font size="-1"><b><a href=
        "javascript:Start('mtlet2eb4.jpg')">PAGE 4</a></b></font>]
        he will enjoy doing it. Nast only has just one
        <u>first-class</u> talent (caricature,) and no more -- but
        this book will exercise that talent, I think. I think he
        will be glad to do this work below his usual terms. If you
        say so <u>I will write him</u>. Tell me what you think,
        &amp; tell me about the total amount you think it best to
        put in the <u>drawing</u> of the illustrations.<br />
        <br />
        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; I wish you would say nothing about a new book
        from me for the spring (or rather next fall) issue, because
        as soon as I can get some more stock, at easy figures, I
        want it. I want to be a Director, also. Yrs, Clemens.<br />
        <br />
        How copies have been sold of Innocents? And how many of
        R.I.? Get it from official figures.<br />
