<p>This is the title of a new work by that funny Mark Twain, and is <i>sui generis</i>, one of his best.  All those who followed Mr. Clemens in the pages of his "Innocents Abroad," on his trip across the ocean, and found a source of great enjoyment in his unique and vivid descriptions of countries and things, which have been written about, over and over again; who found something highly refreshing in his original views of matters of which there seemed before to have been but one opinion; who looked with <i>his</i> eyes upon the works of the old masters in Italy, wept with him by the grave of Adam in the Holy Land, and climbed the pyramids in Egypt by his side, will, we are sure, be quite ready to embark with him upon another pleasure trip through our own land, and to follow him through another volume wherein he treats of a period and of scenes full of interest, which, although often partially described, have never been fully recorded by any eye-witness and participator.
</p>

<p>Brimful of characteristic humor, running over with smile-persuading and laughter-forcing incidents and ideas, those who seek amusement for idle moments, will find in this book an inexhaustible vein to work, full of the purest ore.  Recording facts and statistics relating to one of the most eventful periods of our nation's history, this volume will most worthily fill a place on the historical shelf of the library, hitherto void.
</p>

<p>This book is a characteristic one, full of those peculiarities which have made its author's writings so popular, a prominent one being a cheerfulness which pervades every line.  No mountain so high, so bleak and inhospitable, but its summit snows are seen to glimmer and sparkle in the sunbeams; no cavern so deep, and dark, and terrible, but through its outlet come peering in the tokens and assurances of an upper and brighter region; no clouds of adversity so heavy that the blue sky is not discovered behind them; and no folly so encased in the armor of fashion and influence, that the keen point of humorous satire cannot find a place to pierce it.  Warmth, light, cheerfulness, and innocent mirth were hid within the folds of the author's manuscript, and they will look out upon the reader from every page of this book.
</p>

<p>Mr. J. F. Roadnight is the general agent for Arkansas and Mississippi, and is at present in the city.  He will call upon our citizens to subscribe, and we feel sure that no one who read the "Nevada Funeral" in yesterday's R<font size="-1">EPUBLICAN</font>, which was taken from "Roughing It," will hesitate to purchase the work.  It has some 600 pages, and is profusely illustrated.
