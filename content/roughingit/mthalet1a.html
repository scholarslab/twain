        <p>The town of Honolulu (said to contain between twelve
        thousand and fifteen thousand inhabitants) is spread over a
        dead level; has streets from twenty to thirty feet wide,
        solid and level as a floor, most of them straight as a line
        and a few as crooked as a corkscrew; houses one and two
        stories high, built of wood, straw, 'dobes, and dull
        cream-colored pebble-and-shell-conglomerated coral cut into
        oblong square blocks and laid in cement, but no brick
        houses;</p>

      As we approached, the imposing promontory of Diamond Head
      rose up out of the ocean its rugged front softened by the
      hazy distance, and presently the details of the land began to
      make themselves manifest: first the line of beach; then the
      plumed coacoanut trees of the tropics; then cabins of the
      natives; then the white town of Honolulu, said to contain
      between twelve and fifteen thousand inhabitants spread over a
      dead level; with streets from twenty to thirty feet wide,
      solid and level as a floor, most of them straight as a line
      and few as crooked as a corkscrew.</td>
