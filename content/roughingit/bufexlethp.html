        Eight chapters in <i>Roughing It</i> were derived from a
        series of "travel letters" MT originally wrote in 1869-1870
        for the <i>Express</i>, the Buffalo, New York, paper that
        he was a part-owner and editor of right after his marriage.
        They were intended to wind up in a book, but not
        <i>Roughing It</i>. MT himself described the plan (and
        explains the reason I have to put "travel letters" in
        quotation marks) in an introduction he wrote to "Letter No.
        1":<br />

        <blockquote>
          I am just starting out on a pleasure trip around the
          globe, <i>by proxy</i>. That is to say, Professor D. R.
          Ford, of Elmira College, is now making the journey for
          me, and will write the newspaper account of his (our)
          trip. No, not that exactly -- but he will travel and
          write letters, and I shall stay at home and add a dozen
          pages to each of his letters. One of us will furnish the
          fancy and the jokes, and the other will furnish the
          facts. I am equal to either department, although
          statistics are my best hold.
        </blockquote>MT wound up publishing ten letters in the
        paper, the first eight of which he wrote himself after he
        realized that Professor Ford wasn't going to write very
        often. Two of the letters are entirely fanciful (No. 2 is
        called "Adventures in Hayti," and No. 8, set on Easter
        Island, is called "Dining with a Cannibal" -- MT never
        visited either island), but the other six describe
        California and Nevada with the same blend of realism and
        humor that made <i>Innocents Abroad</i> so popular and that
        would serve as the aesthetic formula for much of
        <i>Roughing It</i> too.

      You can read those six letters here, along with an
      interactive feature that will allow you to compare them with
      the book: clicking on the <b><font size="-1">ROUGHING IT
      ICON</font></b> (<i>left</i>) whenever you see it will bring
      up a side-by-side comparison of the two texts, so you can see
      for yourself the kinds of revisions MT made.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>As you'll see when you compare, in many cases the
      <i>Roughing It</i> text follows the newspaper text very
      closely, though MT may move the parts around (the first half
      of Letter No. 4, for example, ends up in Chapter 57, and the
      second half in Chapter 37). Most drastically changed is
      Letter No. 7's accounts of the Chinese and the outlaws in the
      West. And nowhere to be seen in the newspaper versions is the
      first-person protagonist of <i>Roughing It</i>: the hapless
      tenderfoot whose naivet&eacute;s and ineptitudes are the
      occasion for so much of the book's comedy. The <b><font size=
      "-1">COMPARE</font></b> feature will let you see, for
      example, how he was added to the end of Letter No. 4's
      description of the elusive Whiteman and his cement
      mine.</td>
