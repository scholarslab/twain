        <p>This is a goodly volume, of nearly six hundred pages;
        and if mirth is indeed one of the best of medicines, as we
        have somewhere read--we think in <i>Hall's Journal of
        Health</i>, an unimpeachable authority--<i>Roughing It</i>
        should have a place in every sick-room, and be the
        invalid's cherished companion. In taking Mr. Clemens'
        jokes, however, for hygenic purposes, it behooves the
        patient to exercise great caution in regard to the strength
        of the dose, if we may judge of the power of the medicine
        from its effects upon a hungry camel, which once, at the
        head-waters of the Jordan, made an experiment upon the
        author's overcoat as an article of diet. The overcoat was
        left lying upon the ground while the travelers were
        pitching their tents, and the camel, having contemplated it
        for a while with a critical eye, seemed to come to the
        conclusion that it must be a new edible. But we will let
        the author tell the story, in his own inimitable <a name=

        <blockquote>
          He put his foot on it, and lifted one of the sleeves out
          with his teeth, and chewed and chewed at it, gradually
          taking it in, and all the while opening and closing his
          eyes in a kind of religious ecstasy, as if he had never
          tasted anything as good as an overcoat before, in his
          life. Then he smacked his lips once or twice, and reached
          after the other sleeve. Next he tried the velvet collar,
          and smiled a smile of such contentment that it was plain
          to see that he regarded that as the daintiest thing about
          an overcoat. The tails went next, along with some
          percussion caps and cough candy, and some fig-paste from
          Constantinople. And then my newspaper correspondence
          dropped out, and he took a chance in that--manuscript
          letters written for the home papers. But he was treading
          on dangerous ground, now. He began to come across solid
          wisdom in those documents that was rather weighty on his
          stomach; and occasionally he would take a joke that would
          shake him up till it loosened his teeth . . .
        </blockquote>

        <p>However, it was not our author's jokes, powerful as were
        their effects, but one of his statements of facts--one of
        the mildest and gentlest, he declares, that he ever laid
        before a trusting public--that proved fatal to the
        sensitive animal, and caused him to "fall over as stiff as
        a carpenter's work-bench, and die a death of indescribable
        agony."</p>

        <p>This species of humor is certainly grotesque, and
        hardily extravagant. But it is also genuine, and thoroughly
        enjoyable. In the same vein, and finer still, is the sketch
        of the <i>coyote</i>, his appearance and characteristics,
        in which the writer has managed (as he often does) to
        convey an accurate and graphic picture, while apparently
        indulging--or rather rioting--in the drollest and most
        fantastic exaggeration. The episode of Mrs. Beazely and her
        son, or the Erikson and Greeley correspondence, which has
        been extensively reproduced in the newspapers, though based
        upon a well-worn theme, is set in such a quaint,
        half-pathetic frame-work of narrative as makes it quite
        fresh and ineffably comic. On almost every page of the
        volume this vein of broad, robust humor crops out. It is
        not fine and pensive, like Irving's. It is not artificial,
        or based upon any literary model, and does not depend for
        its effect upon elaboration or word-cobbling. Its specific
        character is its sturdy honesty and rugged sense,
        antagonistic to sentimentality and shams. The fun with
        which the volume overflows more copiously than any previous
        book of the author's, is not mere fun. It constantly does
        the work of satire, though in a spirit more genial than
        that of most satirists; and constantly evinces keen insight
        and shrewd observation. The preface contains a facetious
        apology for the cirumstance that the book embodies a good
        deal of information, especially concerning the rise,
        growth, and culmination of the silver-mining fever in
        Nevada. The apology is scarcely needed, for though the
        twenty-odd chapters which deal with that remarkable episode
        do, in fact, contain a vast amount of information, it is
        served up in such a style that the reader absorbs it
        without effect, and becomes unconsciously instructed, while
        dreaming only of entertainment--as students at German
        universities said to become learned in metaphysics, not by
        much "poring over miserable books," but by loquacious
        discussions, in hours of recreation, over their lager and
        meerschaums.</p>

        <p>As Irving stands, without dispute, at the head of
        American classic humorists, so the precedence in the
        unclassical school must be conceded to Mark Twain. About
        him there is nothing classic, bookish, or conventional, any
        more than there is about a buffalo or a grizzly. His genius
        is characterized by the breadth, and ruggedness, and
        audacity of the West; and, wherever he was born, or
        wherever he may abide, the Great West claims him as her
        intellectual offspring. Artemus Ward, Doesticks, and
        Orpheus C. Kerr, who have been the favorite purveyors of
        mirth for the Eastern people, were timid navigators, who
        hugged the shore of plausibility, and would have trembled
        at the thought of launching out into the mid-ocean of wild,
        preposterous invention and sublime exaggeration, as Mark
        Twain does, in such episodes as Bemis' buffalo adventure,
        and "Riding the Avalanche," where, after picturing the
        unfortunate tourist as "riding into eternity on the back of
        a raging and tossing avalanche," he concludes with the
        remark, "This is all very well, but let us not be carried
        away by excitement, but ask calmly, how does this person
        feel about it in his cooler moments next day, with six or
        seven thousand feet of snow on the top of him?"</p>

        <p>It would be a great misapprehension, however, to
        conceive of <i>Roughing It</i> as merely a book of
        grotesque humor and rollicking fun. It abounds in fresh
        description of natural scenery, some of which, especially
        in the overland stage-ride, are remarkably graphic and
        vigorous. The writer's talent for clear, impressive
        narrative, too, is illustrated in the chapters devoted to
        the terrible story of the desperado, Slade, which has as
        intense an interest as any thing in the wildest sensational
        novel of the day.</p>

        <p>Of the three hundred wood-cuts that illustrate the
        volume we can say nothing complimentary, from an artistic
        point of view. But some of them are spirited, and many of
        them are suggestive. Crude as they are in design, and
        coarse in execution, they have afforded us much amusement;
        and the majority of readers would, we are sure, regret to
        dispense with them.</p>
