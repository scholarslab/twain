      <br />
      At the Rocky Ridge station in the Rocky Mountains, in the old
      days of overland stages and pony expresses, I had the
      gorgeous honor of breakfasting with Mr. Slade, the Prince of
      all the desperadoes; who killed twenty-six men in his time;
      who used to cut off his victims' ears and send them as
      keepsakes to their relatives; and who bound one of his
      victims hand and foot and practiced on him with his revolver
      for hours together -- a proceeding which seems almost
      inexcusable until we reflect that Rocky Ridge is away off in
      the dull solitudes of the mountains, and the poor desperadoes
      have hardly any amusements. Mr. Slade afterward went to
      Montana and began to thin out the population as usual -- for
      he took a great interest in trimming the census and
      regulating the vote -- but finally the Vigilance Committee
      captured him and hanged him, giving him just fifteen minutes
      to prepare himself in. The papers said he cried on the
      scaffold.</td>

      [<i>In the book MT dropped the other "desperadoes" and
      devoted Chapters 10 and 11 to Slade. The excerpt here, the
      revised account of meeting Slade in person, is from the end
      of Chapter 10.</i>]<br />
      <br />
      In due time we rattled up to a stage-station, and sat down to
      breakfast with a half-savage, half-civilized company of armed
      and bearded mountaineers, ranchmen and station employees. The
      most gentlemanly-appearing, quiet and affable officer we had
      yet found along the road in the Overland Company's service
      was the person who sat at the head of the table, at my elbow.
      Never youth stared and shivered as I did when I heard them
      call him SLADE!<br />
      <br />
      Here was romance, and I sitting face to face with
      it!--looking upon it--touching it--hobnobbing with it, as it
      were! Here, right by my side, was the actual ogre who, in
      fights and brawls and various ways, <i>had taken the lives of
      twenty-six human beings</i>, or all men lied about him! I
      suppose I was the proudest stripling that ever traveled to
      see strange lands and wonderful people.<br />
      <br />
      He was so friendly and so gentle-spoken that I warmed to him
      in spite of his awful history. It was hardly possible to
      realize that this pleasant person was the pitiless scourge of
      the outlaws, the raw-head-and-bloody-bones the nursing
      mothers of the mountains terrified their children with. And
      to this day I can remember nothing remarkable about Slade
      except that his face was rather broad across the cheek bones,
      and that the cheek bones were low and the lips peculiarly
      thin and straight. But that was enough to leave something of
      an effect upon me, for since then I seldom see a face
      possessing those characteristics without fancying that the
      owner of it is a dangerous man.<br />
      <br />
      The coffee ran out. At least it was reduced to one
      tin-cupful, and Slade was about to take it when he saw that
      my cup was empty. He politely offered to fill it, but
      although I wanted it, I politely declined. I was afraid he
      had not killed anybody that morning, and might be needing
      diversion. But still with firm politeness he insisted on
      filling my cup, and said I had traveled all night and better
      deserved it than he--and while he talked he placidly poured
      the fluid, to the last drop. I thanked him and drank it, but
      it gave me no comfort, for I could not feel sure that he
      would not be sorry, presently, that he had given it away, and
      proceed to kill me to distract his thoughts from the loss.
      But nothing of the kind occurred. We left him with only
      twenty-six dead people to account for, and I felt a tranquil
      satisfaction in the thought that in so judiciously taking
      care of No. 1 at that breakfast-table I had pleasantly
      escaped being No. 27. Slade came out to the coach and saw us
      off, first ordering certain re&auml;rrangements of the
      mail-bags for our comfort, and then we took leave of him,
      satisfied that we should hear of him again, some day, and
      wondering in what connection.</td>
