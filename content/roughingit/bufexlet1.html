          <b>The Dead Sea</b>
        </center><br />
        Mono Lake or the Dead Sea of California, is one of her most
        extraordinary curiosities, but being situated in a very
        out-of-the-way corner of the country, and away up among the
        eternal snows of the Sierras, it is little known and very
        seldom visited. A mining excitement carried me there once,
        and I spent several months in its vicinity. It lies in a
        lifeless, treeless, hideous desert, 8000 feet above the
        level of the sea, and is guarded by mountains 2000 feet
        higher, whose summits are hidden always in the clouds. This
        solemn, silent, sailless sea -- this lonely tenant of the
        loneliest spot on earth -- is little graced with the
        picturesque. It is an unpretending expanse of greyish
        water, about a hundred miles in circumference, with two
        islands in its centre, mere upheavals of rent, and scorched
        and blistered lava, snowed over with grey banks and drifts
        of pumice stone and ashes, the winding sheet of the dead
        volcano, whose vast crater the lake has seized upon and
        occupied.<br />
        <br />
        The lake is 200 feet deep, and its sluggish waters are so
        strong with alkali that if you only dip the most hopelessly
        soiled garment into them once or twice, and wring it out,
        it will be found as clean as if it had been through your
        ablest washerwoman's hands. While we camped there our
        laundry work was easy. We tied the week's washing astern of
        our boat, and sailed a quarter of a mile, and the job was
        complete, all to the wringing out. If we threw the water on
        our heads and gave them a rub or so, the white lather would
        pile up three inches high. This water is not good for
        bruised places and abrasions of the skin. We had a valuable
        dog. He had raw places on him. He had more raw places on
        him than sound ones. He was the rawest dog I almost ever
        saw. He jumped overboard one day to get away from the
        flies. But it was bad judgment. In his condition, it would
        have been just as comfortable to jump into the fire. The
        alkali water nipped him in all the raw places
        simultaneously, and he struck out for the shore with
        considerable interest. He yelped and barked and howled as
        he went -- and by the time he got to the shore there was no
        bark to him -- for he had barked the bark all out of his
        inside, and the alkali water had cleaned the bark all off
        his outside, and he probably wished he had never embarked
        in any such enterprise. He ran round and round in a circle,
        and pawed the earth and clawed the air, and threw double
        summersets, sometimes backwards and sometimes forwards, in
        the most frantic and extraordinary manner. He was not a
        demonstrative dog, as a general thing, but rather of a
        grave and serious turn of mind, and I never saw him take so
        much interest in any thing before. He finally struck out
        over the mountains, at a gait which we estimated at about
        250 miles an hour, and he is going yet. This was about five
        years ago. We look for what is left of him along here every
        day.<br />
        <br />
        A white man cannot drink the water of Mono Lake, for it is
        nearly pure lye. It is said that the Indians in the
        vicinity drink it sometimes, though. It is not improbable,
        for they are among the purest liars I ever saw. [There will
        be no additional charge for this joke, except to parties
        requiring an explanation of it. This joke has received high
        commendation from some of the ablest minds of the age.
        Horace Greeley remarked to a friend of mine that if he were
        ever to make a joke like that, he would not desire to live
        any longer.]<br />
        <br />
        There are no fish in Mono Lake -- no frogs, no snakes, no
        pollywogs -- nothing, in fact, that goes to make life
        desirable. Millions of wild ducks and sea gulls swim about
        the surface, but no living thing exists <i>under</i> the
        surface, except a white feathery sort of worm, one-half an
        inch long, which looks like a bit of white thread frayed
        out at the sides. If you dip up a gallon of water, you will
        get about fifteen thousand of these. They give to the water
        a sort of grayish-white appearance. Then there is a fly,
        which looks something like our house fly. These settle on
        the beach to eat the worms that wash ashore -- and any
        time, you can see there a belt of flies an inch deep and
        six feet wide, and this belt extends clear around the lake
        -- a belt of flies one hundred miles long. If you throw a
        stone among them, they swarm up so thick that they look
        dense, like a cloud. You can hold them under water as long
        as you please -- they don't mind it -- they are only proud
        of it. When you let them go, they pop up to the surface as
        dry as a patent office report, and walk off as
        unconcernedly as if they had been educated especially with
        a view to affording instructive entertainment to man in
        that particular way. Providence leaves nothing to go by
        chance. All things have their uses and their part and
        proper place in Nature's economy. The ducks and gulls eat
        the flies, the flies eat the worms -- the Indians eat the
        flies -- the wild oats eat the Indians -- the white folks
        eat the wild oats when the crops fail -- and thus all
        things are lovely.<br />
        <br />
        Mono Lake is 150 miles in a straight line from the ocean --
        and between it and the ocean are one or two ranges of
        mountains -- yet thousands of sea-gulls go there every
        season to lay their eggs and rear their young. One would as
        soon expect to find sea-gulls in Tennessee. And in this
        connection let us observe another instance of Nature's
        wisdom. The islands in the lake being merely huge masses of
        lava, coated over with ashes and pumice stone, and utterly
        innocent of vegetation or anything that would burn; and the
        sea-gulls' eggs being entirely useless to any body unless
        they be cooked, Nature has provided an unfailing spring of
        boiling water on the largest island, and you can put your
        eggs in there, and in four minutes you can boil them as
        hard as any statement I have made during the past fifteen
        years. Within ten feet of the boiling spring is a spring of
        pure cold water, sweet and wholesome. So, in that island
        you get your board and washing free of charge -- and if
        nature had gone further and furnished a nice American hotel
        clerk who was crusty and disobliging, and didn't know any
        thing about the time tables, or the railroad routes -- or
        -- any thing -- and was proud of it -- I would not wish for
        a more desirable boarding house.<br />
        <br />
        Half a dozen little mountain brooks flow into Mono Lake,
        but not a stream of any kind flows out of it. It neither
        rises nor falls, apparently, and what it does with its
        surplus water is a dark and bloody mystery. All the rivers
        of Nevada sink into the earth mysteriously after they have
        run 100 miles or so -- none of them flow to the sea, as is
        the fashion of rivers in all other lands.<br />
        <br />
        There are only two seasons in the region round about Mono
        Lake and these are, the breaking up of one Winter and the
        beginning of the next. More than once I have seen a
        perfectly blistering morning open up with the thermometer
        at ninety degrees at eight o'clock, and seen the snow fall
        fourteen inches deep and that same identical thermometer go
        down to forty-four degrees under shelter, before 9 o'clock
        at night. Under favorable circumstances it snows at least
        once in every single month in the year in the little town
        of Mono. So uncertain is the climate in Summer that a lady
        who goes out visiting cannot hope to be prepared for all
        emergencies unless she takes her fan under one arm and her
        snow shoes under the other. When they have a Fourth of July
        procession it generally snows on them, and they do say that
        as a general thing when a man calls for a brandy toddy
        there, the bar keeper chops it off with a hatchet and wraps
        it up in a paper, like maple sugar. And it is further
        reported that the old soakers haven't any teeth -- wore
        them out eating gin cocktails and brandy punches. I don't
        endorse that statement -- I simply give it for what it is
        worth -- and it is worth -- well, I should say, millions,
        to any man who can believe it without straining himself.
        But I do endorse the snow on the Fourth of July because I
        know that to be true.<br />
