        30 July 1866</b></font><br />

        <p>For a little more than a month, the late Princess--Her
        Royal Highness Victoria Kamamalu Kaahumanu, heir
        presumptive to the crown and sister to the King--lay in
        state at Iolani Palace, the royal residence. For a little
        over a month, troops of natives of both sexes, drawn here
        from the several islands by the great event, have thronged
        past my door every evening on their way to the palace.
        Every night, and all night long, for more than thirty days,
        multitudes of these strange mourners have burned their
        candlenut torches in the royal inclosure, and sung their
        funeral dirges, and danced their hula-hulas, and wailed
        their harrowing wail for the dead. All this time we
        strangers have been consumed with curiosity to look within
        those walls and see the pagan deviltry that was going on
        there. But the thing was tabu (forbidden--we get our word
        "taboo" from the Hawaiian language) to foreigners--haoles.
        The grounds were thrown open to everybody the first night,
        but several rowdy white people acted so unbecomingly--so
        shamefully, in fact--that the King placed a strict tabu
        upon their future admittance. I was absent--on the island
        of Hawaii--at that time, and so I lost that one single
        opportunity to gratify my curiosity in this matter.</p>

        <p>W<font size="-1">HILE</font> I was in Honolulu I
        witnessed the ceremonious funeral of the King's sister, her
        Royal Highness the Princess Victoria. According to the
        royal custom, the remains had lain in state at the palace
        <i>thirty days</i>, watched day and night by a guard of
        honor. And during all that time a great multitude of
        natives from the several islands had kept the palace
        grounds well crowded and had made the place a pandemonium
        every night with their howlings and wailings, beating of
        tom-toms and dancing of the (at other times) forbidden
        "hula-hula" by half-clad maidens to the music of songs of
        questionable decency chanted in honor of the deceased.</p>
