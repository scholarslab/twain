        <br />
        There are other kinds of climate in California -- several
        kinds -- and some of them very agreeable. The climate of
        San Francisco is mild and singularly equable. The
        thermometer stands at about seventy degrees the year round.
        It hardly changes at all. You sleep under one or two light
        blankets Summer and Winter, and never use a mosquito bar.
        Nobody ever wears Summer clothing. You wear black
        broadcloth -- if you've got it -- in August and January,
        just the same. It is no colder, and no warmer, in the one
        month than the other. You don't use overcoats and you don't
        use fans. It is just as pleasant a climate as could be
        contrived, and is the most unvarying in the whole world.
        The wind blows there a good deal in the Summer months, but
        then you can go over to Oakland, if you want to -- three or
        four miles away -- it don't blow there. It has only snowed
        twice in San Francisco in nineteen years, and then it only
        remained on the ground long enough to astonish the
        children, and set them to wondering what the feathery stuff
        was.<br />
        <br />
        During eight months of the year, straight along, the skies
        are bright and cloudless and never a drop of rain falls.
        But when the other four months come along, the most
        righteous thing you can do will be to go and steal an
        umbrella. Because you'll need it. Not just one day, but one
        hundred and twenty days in unvarying succession. When you
        want to go visiting, or attend church, or the theatre, you
        never look up at the clouds to see whether it is likely to
        rain or not -- you look at the almanac. If it is winter, it
        will rain -- there is little use in bothering about that --
        and if it is summer, it won't rain, and you can not help
        it. You never see a lightning-rod, because it never
        thunders and it never lightens. And after you have listened
        for six or eight weeks, every night, to the dismal monotony
        of these quiet rains, you will wish in your heart the
        thunder <i>would</i> leap and crash and roar along those
        drowsy skies once, and make everything alive -- you will
        wish the prisoned lightnings <i>would</i> cleave the dull
        firmament asunder and light it with the red splendors of
        hell for <i>one</i> little instant. You would give any
        <i>thing</i> to hear the old familiar thunder again and see
        the lightning strike somebody. And along in the Summer,
        when you have suffered about four months of lustrous,
        pitiless sunshine, you are ready to go down on your knees
        and beg for rain -- hail -- snow -- thunder and lightning
        -- anything to break the monotony -- you'll take an
        earthquake, if you can't do any better. And the chances are
        that you'll get it, too.<br />

        San Francisco is built on sand hills, but they are prolific
        sand hills. They yield a generous vegetation. All your rare
        flowers, which people in "the States" rear with such
        patient care in parlor flower pots and green houses,
        flourish luxuriantly in the open air there all the year
        round. Calla lilies, all sorts of geraniums, passion
        flowers, moss roses -- I don't know the names of a tenth
        part of them. I only know that while New Yorkers are
        burdened with banks and drifts of snow, Californians are
        burdened with banks and drifts of flowers, if they only
        keep their hands off and let them grow. And I have heard
        that we have here that rarest and most curious of all
        flowers, the beautiful Espiritu Santo, as the Spaniards
        call it -- or flower of the Holy Spirit -- though I never
        have seen it anywhere but in Central America -- down on the
        Isthmus. In its cup is the daintiest little fac-simile of a
        dove, as pure and white as snow. The Spaniards have a
        superstitious reverence for it. The blossom has been
        conveyed to the States, submerged in ether; and the bulb
        has been taken thither also, but every attempt to make it
        bloom after it arrived, has failed.<br />
        <br />

        </center><br />
        I have spoken of the endless Winter of Mono, California,
        and the eternal Spring of San Francisco. Now if we travel a
        hundred miles in a straight line, we come to the eternal
        Summer of Sacramento. One never sees Summer clothing or
        mosquitoes in San Francisco -- but they can be found in
        Sacramento. Not always and unvaryingly, but about 143
        months out of twelve years, perhaps. Flowers bloom there,
        always, you can easily believe -- people suffer and sweat,
        and swear, morning, noon and night, and wear out their
        dearest energies fanning themselves. It gets pretty hot
        there, but if you go down to Fort Yuma you will find it
        hotter. Fort Yuma is probably the hottest place on earth.
        The thermometer stays at 120 in the shade there all the
        time -- except when it relents and -- goes higher. It is a
        U.S. military post, and its occupants get so used to the
        terrific heat that they are bound to suffer without it.
        There is a tradition (attributed to John Phoenix) that a
        very, very wicked soldier died there, once, and of course
        he went straight to the hottest corner of perdition, ----,
        and the next day he telegraphed back for his blankets.
        There is no doubt about the truth of this statement --
        there <i>can</i> be no doubt about it -- for I have seen
        the place where that soldier used to board. With a French
        lady by the name of O'Flannigan, and she lives there yet.
        Sacramento is fiery Summer always, and you can gather
        roses, and eat strawberries and ice-cream, and wear white
        linen clothes, and pant and perspire at eight or nine
        o'clock in the morning, and take the cars, and at noon put
        on your furs and your skates and go skimming over frozen
        Donner Lake, seven thousand feet above the valley, among
        snow banks fifteen feet deep, and in the shadow of grand
        mountain peaks that lift their frosty crags ten thousand
        feet above the level of the sea. There is a transition for
        you! Where will you find another like it in the Western
        hemisphere? And I have swept around snow-walled curves of
        the Pacific Railroad in that vicinity, 6000 feet above the
        sea, and looked down as the birds do, upon the everlasting
        summer of the Sacramento Valley, with its green fields, its
        feathery foliage, its silver streams, all slumbering in the
        mellow haze of its enchanted atmosphere, and all infinitely
        softened and spiritualized by distance -- a rich, dreamy,
        exquisite glimpse of fairy land, made all the more charming
        and striking that it was caught through a forbidding
        gateway of ice and snow and savage crags and
        precipices.<br />

        Summer, it <i>won't</i> rain, and you cannot help it. You
        never need a lightning-rod, because it never thunders and
        it never lightens. And after you have listened for six or

        California, and but this moment of the eternal Spring of
        San Francisco. Now if we travel a hundred miles in a
        straight line, we come to the eternal Summer of Sacramento.
        One never sees Summer-clothing or mosquitoes in San
        Francisco--but they can be found in Sacramento. Not always
        and unvaryingly, but about one hundred and forty-three
        months out of twelve years, perhaps. Flowers bloom there,
        always, the reader can easily believe--people suffer and
        sweat, and swear, morning, noon and night, and wear out
