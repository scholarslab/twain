          <h3>From Chapter 2: Salt Lake City</h3>
        </center>

        <p>B<font size="-1">ETWEEN</font> the western border of the
        States on the Atlantic side, and the Pacific States of this
        great continent, there are vast prairies, dreary and
        treeless, sand-hills, mud flats, rocky mountains, and rapid
        rivers. Sixteen hundred and sixty-seven miles of travel
        from St. Louis, Mo., <i>vi&acirc;</i> Council Bluffs City,
        brings one to the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. A journey
        through tortuous mountain defiles, crossing creeks with
        precipitous banks, over roads that terrify even expert
        Jehus; wearied with a monotony more fatiguing than a sea
        voyage, any valley would seem lovely, and any respite would
        be hailed as a paradise. This fact accounts for the joy
        with which travelers hail the first glimpse of the barren
        and bare-valleyed home of the Saints. Will the reader make
        the tour with me?</p>

        <p>We have just climbed up a steep, rocky hill. Three or
        four teams to each wagon have at last dragged them all
        safely to the summit of the "big mountain." The cattle are
        panting and puffing and lying down for a rest, while we
        gaze at a very imposing scene. We are now standing on an
        eminence of the Wahsatch mountains, over eight thousand
        feet above the level of the ocean, surrounded by peaks that
        rise majestically above our heads, and in the deep nooks of
        which continually glitters the eternal snow; beneath this,
        fringed and shaded by dark masses of balsam, fir, and pine.
        Behind us are receding ranges of hills, streams sparkling
        like silver threads, the trembling foliage of the quaking
        aspen, and narrow gorges looming like abysses in the
        distance. Before us, mountains growing lower, till a strip
        of valley relieves the sight, in the south-west. This is
        the first glimpse of the Valley of the Great Salt Lake.
        Mormons fall on their knees and pray; some shout hosannas
        and hallelujahs; many weep; husbands kiss their wives, and
        parents their children, in their paroxysm of joy, and the
        very faithful declare they feel the Spirit of God
        <i>pervading the very atmosphere</i>, and they
        enthusiastically declare that all their toils are repaid,
        for they have at length come home, where the "wicked cease
        from troubling and the weary are at rest." Poor
        people--poor deluded people!</p>

          <h3>From Chapter 3: Practical Polygamy</h3>
        </center>

        <p>The Mormon polygamist has no HOME. Some have
        their wives lotted off by pairs in small disconnected
        houses, like a row of out-houses. Some have long low
        houses, and on taking a new wife build a new room on to
        them, so that their rooms look like rows of stalls in a
        cow- barn! Some have but one house and crowd them all
        together, outraging all decency, and not leaving even an
        affectation of convenience. Many often remain thus, until
        some petty strife about division of labor, children's
        quarrels, difference of taste, or jealousy of attention
        kindles a flame, only to be smothered by separation. When
        they live in different houses, they generally have
        different tables, and the husband has to give each house
        its turn to cook for him, and honor their tables with his
        presence in rotation. The evenings at his disposal, his
        constant distribution of himself among them, has to be by
        rule. Jealousies the most bitter, reproaches the most
        galling and disgusting, scenes without number, and acrimony
        without end, are the inevitable consequences of the
        slightest partiality. It is impossible for any man to
        equally love several different women; it is quite possible,
        however, for him to be equally indifferent about any
        number. The nature most in unison with his own, will most
        attract him. The most affectionate will be certainly
        preferred to the least affectionate. I am acquainted with
        scores of polygamists, and they all have <i>favorites</i>,
        and show partiality. To feel partiality and not to exhibit
        it, is unnatural. To exhibit it, and for it to pass
        unnoticed by a jealous women, is impossible. For it is to
        be noticed, is for it to be reproached.</p>

        <p>The Mormon polygamist, therefore, has to maintain a
        constant guard over himself. Any husband might feel to kiss
        his wife gladly: to go round a table and kiss half a dozen,
        is no joke. It is so in every thing with him. With a dozen
        eyes to notice at what time he retires to rest, or arises
        on any one occasion, and half a dozen mouths to talk about
        it, he must be perfectly governed by rule. Every look,
        every word, every action has to be weighed, or else there
        is jealousy, vituperation, quarreling, bitterness. For this
        reason, the idea of obtaining domestic felicity is
        ridiculed. Brigham is the model, and he to some extent
        adopts the dogma of the Quietists, "Repose is the only
        perfect happiness." He acts as though he felt, and wished
        others to feel, that man was the frigid <i>master</i>,
        performing every act of kindness, not as springing from his
        heart, but because he had <i>reasoned it out</i>, to be an
        act of duty. Warmth of feelings, tenderness of attachment,
        devotedness of attention to a woman, is there called, by
        that worst of Mormon epithets, "Gentilish." "Man must value
        his wife no more than any thing else he has got committed
        to him, and be ready to give her up at any time the Lord
        calls him," said Brigham one Sunday afternoon; and J. M.
        Grant followed the remark by saying, " <i>If God, through
        his prophet, wants to give my women to any more worthy man
        than I am, there they are on the altar of sacrifice; he can
        have them, and do what he pleases with them!</i>"</p>

        <p>They carry this same coldness of affection into all
        their connubial relations. Brigham always sleeps by
        himself, in a little chamber behind his office. I have
        heard the leading men publicly advocate the adoption of
        this practice. They quote the animals as an argument in
        favor of polygamy, and adopt their instincts as models for
        practice. Marriage is stripped of every sentiment that
        makes it holy, innocent, and pure. With them it is nothing
        more than the means of obtaining families; and children are
        only desired as a means of increasing glory in the next
        world; for they believe that every man will reign over his
        children, who will constitute his "kingdom;" and,
        therefore, the more <i>children</i>, the more <i>glory!</i>
        Said Brigham, September 20th, 1856, speaking on this
        subject:</p>

        <p>"It is the duty of every righteous man and every woman
        to prepare tabernacles for all the spirits they can; hence
        if my women leave, I will go and search up others who will
        abide the celestial law, and let all I now have go where
        they please; though I will send the gospel to them."
        -<i>Desert News</i> October 1, 1856.</p>

        <p>Marriage, consequently, is only an addition to man's
        monster <i>selfishness</i>. Not only do they admit, but
        they even advocate openly, that salvation is altogether a
        selfish matter; and Lorenzo Snow, an Apostle (!) publicly
        contended that "God was the most intensely selfish being in
        existence." To sacrifice one's self, to the most trivial
        extent, for a wife, is therefore esteemed as beneath manly
        dignity. To love home, or seek to make it your rest and
        heaven, is called "squeamishness;" and men bedin your ears
        to "take another wife, and that will cure you," and they
        are right. The first effect of polygamy on the Mormons was
        to force them to deny the doctrine, and disavow their
        families. For many years after they practiced it, did the
        leading men indignantly deny it. Its next effect was to
        make them heartless. It first made them liars, and then
        brutes!</p>

        <p>"If it does not increase their happiness, and it
        certainly does their care and expense, why practice it?"
        Mormonism teaches that all salvation is <i>material</i>;
        that men's positions here determine their stations
        hereafter, and as a man can only rule over his family,
        then, no wife, no family; many wives, much family, much
        family, much glory; therefore, many wives, much glory, and
        as the selfish desire for glory is the only incentive of
        Mormon action, so, therefore, he tries to get as many wives
        as he can. They quote Paul's words, "Woman is the glory of
        man," and argue, the more women, the more glory; no women,
        no glory at all! Full of this thought, I have seen old men
        with white hair and wrinkled faces, go hunting after young
        girls, deceiving them with all sorts of professions and
        promises, using the terrors of Brigham's name and
        threatening the penalty of excommunication and consequent
        perdition, in order to induce them to marry them, and then
        to leave them, despoiled and degraded, either to the
        obloquy of a divorce, or to the incurable sorrows of a
        grieved and a wrung heart. I could mention the names of a
        dozen such, who ought to be thinking of God and their
        graves, who instead, visit arriving trains and pester the
        girls with all the ardor and far more impudence than the
        young men.</p>
