      <td>Oh don't you remember sweet Betsy from Pike,<br />
      Who crossed the wide prairie with her lover Ike,<br />
      With two yoke of oxen, a big yellow dog,<br />
      A tall Shangai rooster, and one spotted hog?<br />
      <br />
      <font size="-1"><b>CHORUS:</b></font><br />
      Singing dang fol dee dido,<br />
      Singing dang fol dee day.<br />
      <br />
      One evening quite early they camped on the Platte.<br />
      'Twas near by the road on a green shady flat.<br />
      Where Betsy, sore-footed, lay down to repose --<br />
      With wonder Ike gazed on that Pike County rose.<br />
      <br />
      The Shanghai ran off, and their cattle all died;<br />
      That morning the last piece of bacon was fried;<br />
      Poor Ike was discouraged and Betsy got mad,<br />
      The dog drooped his tail and looked wondrously sad.<br />
      <br />
      They stopped at Salt Lake to inquire of the way,<br />
      Where Brigham declared that sweet Betsy should stay;<br />
      But Betsy got frightened and ran like a deer<br />
      While Brigham stood pawing the ground like a steer.<br />
      <br />
      They soon reached the desert where Betsy gave out,<br />
      And down in the sand she lay rolling about;<br />
      While Ike, half distracted, looked on with surprise,<br />
      Saying, "Betsy, get up, you'll get sand in your eyes."<br />
      <br />
      Sweet Betsy got up in a great deal of pain,<br />
      Declared she'd go back to Pike County again;<br />
      But Ike gave a sigh and they fondly embraced,<br />
      And they traveled along with his arm round her waist.<br />
      <br />
      The Injuns came down in a wild yelling horde,<br />
      And Betsy was scared they would scalp her adored;<br />
      Behind the front wagon wheel Betsy did crawl,<br />
      And there fought the Injuns with musket and ball.<br />
      <br />
      They suddenly stopped on a very high hill,<br />
      With wonder looked down upon old Placerville;<br />
      Ike sighed when he said, and he cast his eyes down,<br />
      "Sweet Betsy, my darling, we've got to Hangtown."<br />
      <br />
      Long Ike and Sweet Betsy attended a dance;<br />
      Ike wore a pair of his Pike County pants;<br />
      Sweet Betsy was dressed up in ribbons and rings;<br />
      Says Ike, "You're an angel, but where are your wings?"<br />
      <br />
      'Twas out on the prairie one bright starry night,<br />
      They broke out the whiskey and Betsy got tight,<br />
      She sang and she howled and she danced o'er the plain,<br />
      And showed her bare legs to the whole wagon train.<br />
      <br />
      The terrible desert was burning and bare,<br />
      And Isaac he shrank from the death lurkin' there,<br />
      "Dear old Pike County, I'll come back to you."<br />
      Says Betsy, "You'll go by yourself if you do."<br />
      <br />
      They swam wild rivers and climbed the tall peaks,<br />
      And camped on the prairies for weeks upon weeks,<br />
      Starvation and cholera, hard work and slaughter,<br />
      They reached Californy, spite of hell and high water.<br />
      <br />
      A miner said, "Betsy, will you dance with me?"<br />
      "I will, you old hoss, if you don't make too free.<br />
      But don't dance me hard, do you want to know why?<br />
      Doggone ye, I'm chock full of strong alkali."<br />
      <br />
      Long Ike and Sweet Betsy got married, of course,<br />
      But Ike, getting jealous, obtained a divorce,<br />
      While Betsy, well satisfied, said with a shout,<br />
      "Goodbye, you big lummox, I'm glad you backed
      out!"<br /></td>
