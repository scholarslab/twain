        <p>I was not encouraged to investigate that camp of
        Chinamen below the hill, but once we went to "China Sam's"
        to buy a lantern. . . . [H]is wife . . . seemed not more
        than fourteen years old--a mere child with the smallest
        hands. She carried a baby slung at her back in the folds of
        a dark-red silk scarf, which was crossed over her breast.
        The baby had a tiny black cap worked with embroidery on its
        head,--a chubby little thing, fast asleep, swaying from
        side to side as the small mother trotted about. She
        examined my dress, hands and ornaments, and, pointing to
        her baby, put her fingers on her under teeth and held up
        two fingers to tell me it had two teeth. Whenever I tried
        to say anything to her she laughed and said, "No sabe." She
        was very delicately formed, her hands small as a child's
        and perfect in shape, yet when she took one of mine to look
        at a ring which had caught her eye, I felt uncomfortable at
        the touch of those slim, tawny fingers. She offered a cigar
        to my companion, which he accepted and held carefully, but
        as we left the house, I noticed that he tossed it into the
        bushes. In an inner closet where the day was shut out, we
        saw the glimmer of candle-light on some brilliantly colored
        papers on the wall. This was the family altar.</p>

        <p>Several years ago Sam was head cook at the
        boarding-house on the "Hill." Another Chinaman tried to get
        his place by underhand means. Sam carefully noted his
        movements; there was a journey to San Jose, which ended
        badly for the other Chinaman, and not too well for Sam, as
        he was tried soon after for murder. He spent a few months
        in jail, but he had only killed another Chinaman, and he
        was an excellent cook,--probably a much better one than his
        rival,--so he was finally acquitted. Two or three years ago
        he sent to China for his wife; she excused herself from
        coming on the plea of being too old for so long a journey,
        and sent this young girl instead. Sam says his young wife
        is "heap fool! Allee time play chile (with the child)!" and
        he beats the "chile" because it is a girl.</p><br />
