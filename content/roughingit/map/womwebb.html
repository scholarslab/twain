        <b>[From] Chapter XX.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>  The second day after leaving Silver Creek, we suddenly
        encountered another specialty of the plains, the "Wild
        Huntress." So often has this personage and her male
        counterpart danced, with big letters and a bowie-knife,
        across yellow covers, that we met the "original Jacobs " of
        the tribe gleefully. She came to us in a cloud of buffalo,
        with black eyes glittering like a snake's, and coarse and
        uncombed hair that tangled itself in the wind, and streamed
        and twisted behind her like writhing vipers. A black riding
        habit flowed out in the strong breeze, its train snapping
        like a loose sail, and a black mustang fled from her Indian
        lash--the dark wild horse, a fit carrier for such somber
        outfit.</p>

        <p>  She was introduced to us by the bison herd, which came
        thundering across our front, with this strange figure
        pressing its flank and darting hither and thither from one
        outskirt of the flying multitude to the other. The reins
        lay loose on the neck of her mustang, which entered into
        the fierce chase like a bloodhound, doubling and twisting
        on its course with an agility that was wonderful.</p>

        <p>  One hand of the huntress held out a holster revolver,
        which she fired occasionally, but with uncertain aim, one
        of the bullets indeed whistling our way. The chase
        constituted the excitement that she sought, and the pistol
        was little more than a spur to urge it on.</p>

        <p>  "That's Ann, poor P----'s wife," said our guide.
        "Crazy since the Indians killed her husband. He was a
        contractor on the railroad; his camp used to be just above
        Hays. She lives in the old 'dug-out' on the line yet, and
        spends half her time chasing buffalo. She never kills none,
        but that isn't what she is after. She wants to be moving,
        and just as wild as she can; it sort o' relieves her
        mind."</p>

        <p>  The huntress had seen our outfit, and rode toward us.
        The face was a very plain one, with a vacant yet anxious
        expression, and the tightly-drawn skin seeming scarcely to
        cover the jaw-bones. She halted before us, and commenced
        conversation at once.</p>

        <p>  "Good day, gentlemen."</p>

        <p>  "Good day, madam."</p>

        <p>  "She always tells her story to every body," muttered
        the guide in a low voice.</p>

        <p>  "Have you seen any Cheyennes hereabouts, gentlemen? I
        sighted a party this morning, and you ought to have seen
        them run. Raven Dick, here, put his best foot foremost, but
        they shook him out of sight in a ravine. Haven't any thing
        better to do, friends, and so I 'm riding down some
        buffalo."</p>

        <p>  We could easily understand why superstitious savages
        should run when a maniac female of such dismal aspect
        flitted along their trail.</p>

        <p>  "Out from Hays, sirs?" she continued, after a pause.
        "I left there yesterday. Dick and I camped last night. We
        must be home when the men come in from work this eve. Up,
        Rave!" and she struck the mustang a cruel blow, from which
        he jumped with quivering muscles, only to be violently
        curbed. For the first time she had just noticed our guide,
        and sat for an instant with her wild eyes eating a way to
        his heart. Then she turned again to us.</p>

        <p>  "Sirs, you must aid me. Some say the Cheyennes killed
        my husband, and others there be who think Abe there did it.
        More shame to me who has to tell it, but the two had a
        fight about a woman, some months gone. It was just after
        pay-day, and husband was drunk; otherwise he'd never have
        bothered his head about any girl but the one he
        married.</p>

        <p>  "There were blows and black eyes, and being a rough
        man's quarrel, it ended with hand-shaking. My man came
        home, and we sat by the fire that night, and I took no
        notice that he'd been wrong, but spoke of our old home in
        Ohio, and asked him wouldn't he go back there when the
        contract was finished. And he put his hand on mine, and
        says 'Sis, if the cuts and fills on the next mile work to
        profit, we 'll go home.' Just then there came a hiss from
        the door at our backs, and husband turned sharp and quick.
        There was a knot-hole in the planks, and its round black
        mouth, gaping from out in the night at us, had spit the
        pound into our ears. Husband he rose and went to the door,
        and fell back dying, with an arrow in his breast. Some said
        it was a Cheyenne, and others said Abe did it. There were
        lots of Indian bows in camp, and Cheyennes don't kill for
        the love of it, but only to steal. I'm going to ask them,
        if I can catch them, did they do it, and if not, I know who
        did. I've a bow, Abe, and an arrow too, and I hope his
        blood isn't on your hands."</p>

        <p>  "I didn't do it, Ann. I don't shoot no man in the
        dark," replied our hostler guide, with a sullen defiance,
        which among that class stands equally well for innocence or
        guilt. We looked at the two, as they sat for an instant
        facing each other. The picture was a weird one--a wildcat,
        fronting the object of its chase, but undecided whether to
        spring or not. We felt that the dark maniac had been
        hovering around us, and that this meeting was not
        altogether accidental. Her disordered brain was yet
        undecided in which direction vengeance lay, and, like a
        tigress, she was watching and waiting.</p>

        <p>  Our policy developed, on the instant, into a
        noncommittal and a safe one. As she wheeled her horse, and
        left us without a word, we remarked to our guide that crazy
        folks were often suspicious of their best friends.</p>

        <p>  "That's so," he replied, and rode off to urge on the
        wagons. We shrank from the idea of living with a murderer,
        and acquitted him of the crime on the spot.</p>
