        <b>[From] Chapter III. Life on the Plains.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>Never before had hostility to the pale-face raged so
        fiercely in the hearts of the Indians of the plains, and
        never had so large a combination of tribes, usually at war
        with each other, been formed to stop the advance of the
        road-makers. From Dakota to the borders of Texas every
        tribe, save the Utes, had put on war paint, and had mounted
        their war steeds. Reports came from the north that the
        Crows and Blackfoots had made friends with the Sioux, and
        from the south that the Cheyennes and Arapahoes, the Kiowas
        and Comanches, had been seen in large bodies crossing the
        Arkansas, and moving northward. The horrors of the last
        summer were fresh in the minds of the frontier men, who
        remembered many a comrade scalped by the red-skins. They
        laughed at the treaties of the Fall, at General Sherman's
        councils, and Samborn's wagon-trains laden with gifts. They
        said, "Wait till the spring, till the frost is out of the
        ground, and the grass is green and abundant, and then see
        how the savages will keep their treaties." This season had
        arrived, and the Indian horizon looked blacker than ever.
        The Fort Kearney massacre, in which some of the wives of
        the officers were brutally murdered, and the energetic
        demands of the railway company on the State had resulted in
        a considerable military force being sent into Nebraska to
        protect the road to Salt Lake. This had the effect of
        driving many additional bands of Indian warriors southward,
        to harass the poorly-guarded route along the Smoky Hill
        Fork.</p>

        <p>The warriors in many a big talk had sworn to clear their
        hunting-grounds of the hated intruder. He should no longer
        drive away their game, or build embankments and put down
        stakes across their broad lands. So they commenced the
        fight in their own fashion.</p><br />
        <hr width="55%" />
        <br />
        <b>[From] Chapter V. A Fortnight at Fort Wallace.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>I have seen in days gone by sights horrible and
        gory--death in all its forms of agony and distortion--but
        never did I feel the sickening sensation, the giddy,
        fainting feeling that came over me when I saw our dead,
        drying and wounded after this Indian fight. A handful of
        men, to be sure, but with enough wounds upon them to have
        slain a company, if evenly distributed. The bugler was
        stripped naked, and five arrows driven through him, while
        his skull was literally smashed to atoms. Another soldier
        was shot with four bullets and three arrows, his scalp was
        torn off, and his brains knocked out. A third was riddled
        with balls and arrows; but they did not succeed in getting
        his scalp, although, like the other two, he was stripped
        naked. James Douglas, a Scotchman, was shot through the
        body with arrows, and his left arm was hacked to pieces. He
        was a brave fellow, and breathed out his life in the arms
        of his comrades. Another man, named Welsh, was killed, but
        all subsequent search failed to discover his remains.
        Sergeant Wylyams lay dead beside his horse; and as the
        fearful picture first met my gaze, I was horror-stricken.
        Horse and rider were stripped bare of trapping and clothes,
        while around them the trampled, blood-stained ground showed
        the desperation of the struggle.</p>

        <p>I shall minutely describe this horrid sight, not for the
        sake of creating a sensation, but because it is
        characteristic of a mode of warfare soon--thank God!--to be
        abolished; and because the mutilations have, as we shall
        presently see, most of them some meaning, apart from
        brutality and a desire to inspire fear.</p>

        <p>A portion of the sergeant's scalp lay near him, but the
        greater part was gone; through his head a rifle-ball had
        passed, and a blow from the tomahawk had laid his brain
        open above his left eye; the nose was slit up, and his
        throat was cut from ear to ear; seven arrows were standing
        in different parts of his naked body; the breast was laid
        open, so as to expose the heart; and the arm, that had
        doubtless done its work against the red-skins, was hacked
        to the bone; his legs, from the hip to the knee, lay open
        with horrible gashes, and from the knee to the foot they
        had cut the flesh with their knives. Thus mutilated,
        Wylyams lay beside the mangled horse. In all, there were
        seven killed and five wounded.</p>

        <p>As I have said, almost all the different tribes on the
        plains had united their forces against us, and each of
        these tribes has a different sign by which it is known.</p>

        <p>The sign of the <i>Cheyenne</i>, or "Cut arm," is made
        in peace by drawing the hand across the arm, to imitate
        cutting it with a knife; that of the <i>Arapahoe</i>, or
        "Smeller tribe," by seizing the nose with the thumb and
        fore-finger; of the <i>Sioux</i>, or "Cut-throat," by
        drawing the hand across the throat. The <i>Comanche</i>, or
        "Snake Indian," waves his hand and arm, in imitation of the
        crawling of a snake; the <i>Crow</i> imitates with his
        hands the flapping of wings; the <i>Pawnee</i>, or "Wolf
        Indian," places two fingers erect on each side of his head,
        to represent pointed ears; the <i>Blackfoot</i> touches the
        heel, and then the toe, of the right foot; and the
        <i>Kiowa's</i> most usual sign is to imitate the act of
        drinking.</p>

        <p>If we now turn to the body of poor Sergeant Wylyams, we
        shall have no difficulty in recognising some meaning in the
        wounds. The muscles of the right arm, hacked to the bone,
        speak of the Cheyennes, or "Cut arms;" the nose slit
        denotes the "Smeller tribe," or Arapahoes; and the throat
        cut bears witness that the Sioux were also present. There
        were, therefore, amongst the warriors Cheyennes, Arapahoes,
        and Sioux. It was not till some time afterwards that I knew
        positively what these signs meant, and I have not yet
        discovered what tribe was indicated by the incisions down
        the thighs, and the laceration of the calves of the legs,
        in oblique parallel gashes. The arrows also varied in make
        and colour, according to the tribe; and it was evident,
        from the number of different devices, that warriors from
        several tribes had each purposely left one in the dead
        man's body.</p>

        <p>I had made the acquaintance of poor Sergeant Wylyams
        only the day before. He was an Englishman, educated at
        Eton, and of good family, but while sowing his wild oats,
        he had made a fatal alliance in London, and gone to
        grief.<br />

        Disowned by his family, he had emigrated to America, joined
        the army, and was daily expecting promotion out of the
        ranks.

        <p>The day on which he was killed he had promised to help
        me in printing off some copies of the photographs which I
        had taken on the way. I had to print off my negatives
        alone, and to take a photograph of him, poor fellow, as he
        lay; a copy of which I sent to Washington, that the
        authorities should see for themselves how their soldiers
        were treated on the plains.</p><br />

        IN nature, the productive and the destructive elements are
        everywhere found side by side, and not only is this true as
        an abstract principle of actual existence, but there is not
        a creature without natural enemies who prey upon it and
        live by its destruction.

        <p>Civilised man, however, although he lives by the
        destruction of life, animal as well as vegetable, takes
        care to reproduce by artificial means as much as, if not
        more than, he destroys; the savage, however, does not
        always do so, and when he does not, this is surely a proof
        that he is not destined by Providence permanently to exist.
        . . .</p><br />

        <p>Governor Charles Bent thus spoke of them in 1846:--"The
        Navajos are an industrious, intelligent, and warlike race
        of Indians, who cultivate the soil, and raise sufficient
        grain and fruits of various kinds for their own
        consumption. They are the owners of large herds and flocks
        of cattle, sheep, horses, mules, and asses. It is estimated
        that the tribe possesses thirty thousand head of horses,
        mules, and asses. It is not rare for one individual to
        possess from five to ten thousand sheep, and four or five
        hundred head of other stock. Their own horses and sheep are
        said to be greatly superior to those reared by the
        Mexicans; but a large portion of their stock has been
        acquired by marauding expeditions against the settlements
        of this territory. They roam over the country, between the
        waters of the River San Juan on the north, and those of the
        Gila on the south. This country is about 150 miles wide,
        consisting of high table mountains, difficult of access,
        affording them as yet effectual protection against their
        enemies. Water is scarce, and difficult to be found by
        those not acquainted with the country, affording them
        another natural safeguard against invasion. Their numbers
        are variously estimated at from one to two thousand
        families, or about fourteen thousand souls. The Navajos, so
        far as I am informed, are the only nation on the continent,
        having intercourse with white men, that is increasing in
        numbers. They have in their possession many prisoners--men,
        women, and children--taken from the settlements of this
        territory, whom they hold and treat as slaves."</p>

        <p>Such was their condition in 1846; since then their
        history has been one long series of misfortunes. As far
        back as any information can be obtained about them, they
        have been at war with the Mexicans and white men, the
        system of reprisals being sytematically carried out on both
        sides. The Mexicans of one settlement would collect
        together, and make a raid on a marauding band of Navajos,
        capturing all they could, not only in stock, but in women
        and children. The Indians would retaliate, not caring
        particularly whether it was the aggressors or some peaceful
        neighbours they attacked in return. This being the state of
        affairs, we find even as early as the autumn of the first
        year of possession, that General Kearney (United States
        army) gave orders to Colonel A. W. Doniphan, then in
        California, to march against the Navajos; and to Governor
        Bent, advising him that "full permission should be given to
        the citizens of New Mexico to march in independent
        companies against these Indians, <i>for the purpose of
        making reprisals</i>, and for the recovery of property and
        prisoners."</p>

        <p>From this time until 1863 war has been unceasing with
        this hardy tribe. Their hand has been against every one,
        and every one's hand has been against them; even the
        Pueblos left their villages and joined the whites against
        them; and as they had actual property in corn-fields,
        flocks, and herds, they could not, like their wild
        neighbours, the Apaches, who lived by the chase and
        marauding only, altogether escape from the hands of the
        military. It was cruel work, however necessary.</p>

        <p>I have spoken to many who helped to <i>humble</i> the
        Navajos. As soon as harvest time approached, the soldiers
        would enter their country, year after year; they say that
        the corn-fields were splendid, but they cut them all down,
        and fired the district wherever they went, driving off
        sheep, sometimes to the number of seventy thousand in a
        single raid, and oxen also by thousands. When them were no
        crops to destroy, and no apparent enemy to be found, or
        flocks to drive off, the military would encamp at the
        different springs, and try by this means to destroy the
        remnant of their stock; but in this, for a long time, they
        were unsuccessful, for the Navajo sheep, probably from
        force of habit, could thrive if only watered once every
        third or fourth day, and thus it happened that when the
        troops had guarded a spring long enough, as they supposed,
        to prove that no Indians or flocks were in that district,
        and had left to go to another, the Navajos, who were
        quietly grazing their cattle in the secluded nooks amongst
        the hills hard by, came down to the spring and refreshed
        themselves with perfect impunity.</p>

        <p>Year after year they boldly held out, and plunder became
        to them a necessity of existence, for they had no other
        means of support. At last, however, this never-ceasing
        hostility reduced the whole tribe to utter destitution, nor
        did they give up until they were literally starving. In
        1863 the first large section of them--I believe about five
        thousand in number--delivered themselves up to the
        government. They were removed from their own country, and
        placed upon a large reservation on the Rio Pecos, and old
        Fort Summer, which had been abandoned, was re-established
        in the centre of the reservation, for the purpose of
        carrying out the design of the government towards them.
        Since then, nearly all the remains of the tribe have
        delivered themselves up, and to the number of about seven
        thousand five hundred have been placed on the reservation
        Mr. Ward is of opinion that a very small fraction indeed of
        this once powerful tribe is now at large in the country
        north of the Rio Colorado, and in Utah Territory; but
        since, for y ears before they gave in, the advantage has
        been on the side of the settlers against the Navajos, he
        assures me that there are at the present time not less than
        two thousand captives in the hands of the Mexicans, who
        profess to bring them up, and to take care of them as
        members of their families and households.</p>

        <p>As regards the present condition of the Indians on the
        Bosque reservation, I cannot do better than give a short
        quotation from the Report of Colonel A. B. Norton
        (Superintendent of Indian Affairs in New Mexico) for the
        year 1866:--"At Fort Summer this tribe has about two
        thousand five hundred acres of land under cultivation,
        mostly in Indian corn, with an admirable system of
        irrigation. The water, however, is very poor in quality,
        and wood so scarce, that it has to be hauled from
        twenty-five to thirty miles to the post, while the mezquit
        root, the only wood used by them for fuel, must soon give
        out. Add to this that the Comanches make constant raids
        upon them, to within a few miles of the fort, and as they
        are very little able to protect themselves, this adds still
        more to their discontent. Of the state of health and morals
        of these Navajos, the hospital reports give a woeful
        account. The tale is not half told, because they have such
        an aversion to the hospital that but few of those taken
        sick will ever go there, and so they are fast diminishing
        in cumbers; while the births are many, the deaths are more.
        Discontent fills every breast of this brave and
        light-hearted tribe, and a piteous cry comes from all as
        they think of their own far-off lands, 'Carry me back,
        carry me back !'" They have had a severe lesson and a
        terrible punishment, but when a railway traverses the
        country, they may with perfect safety be allowed to return
        to their own land, now parched and desolate, but still so
        yearned for by these unhappy prisoners.</p><br />
