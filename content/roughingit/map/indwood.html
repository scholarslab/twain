    <h3>From Chapter 139: The North American Indians

    <tr>
      <td>As the object of this work is to present the manners and
      customs of tribes and races in their primitive state, and not
      those semi-civilized, it will be enough to merely introduce
      the names of the Cherokees, Choctaws, Creeks, Chickasaws,
      Senecas, Delawares, etc. Nor is it necessary to consider
      those, now extinct, that occupied the country when first
      settled by white men. For the same general characteristics,
      now presented, pertain to all the North American races. The
      Indian tribes are rapidly retreating or vanishing before the
      steady, irresistible march of civilization, and the growing
      grandeur of the great Republic in North America. The line,
      where the echoes of the Indian's yell blends with the shout
      of the advancing pioneers and the sound of the wood-chopper's
      axe, is continually moving westward. In a few years we have
      seen it pass from the Mississippi River, to the base of the
      Rocky Mountains. The settler's cabin is unceasingly
      encroaching upon the wigwams of the Red Men. With sadness,
      having smoothed the graves of their fathers, and taken a last
      look of their hunting grounds, they retreat before a power
      which they vainly strive to resist. Pressed backward in two
      centuries and a half, across three-quarters of the continent,
      from Massachusetts Bay almost to the Pacific, except a few
      decaying remnants of tribes, their history and doom cannot
      but awaken sympathy for an unfortunate and overpowered
      race.<br />
      <br />
      Even though we do not form our estimate of the Indian from
      the romantic creations of Cooper, every right-thinking person
      will accord them the tribute of many qualities that
      constitute a real grandeur of character. Their marvellous
      bravery, their ardent rage, their steadfast, fiery enthusiasm
      in the fight or in the chase, their manly sports, their
      grave, philosophic demeanor in the council, their stern,
      stoical endurance in misfortune, their disdain of death, are
      traits that have given to the Indian a character unique and
      noble, a character and history that the annalist, poet, and
      novelist have transferred to their immortal pages, and over
      which multitudes of old and young alike have bent with eager,
      breathless interest. As Mr. Mangin in his "Desert World"
      says: --"There was poetry in their faith, in their customs,
      in their language, at once laconic and picturesque--and even
      in the names they bestowed on each tribe, each chief and
      warrior, on mountain and river. One can hardly suppress a
      feeling of regret that so much of wild romance and valor
      should have been swept from the face of the earth, unless we
      call to mind the shadow of the picture--the Indian's cruelty,
      perfidiousness and savage lust. Even then, our humanity
      revolts from the treatment to which he has been subjected by
      the white man." Tracked and hunted like wild beasts, driven
      from their hunting grounds and the territory of their
      ancestors, imbruted by drink, decimated and dying by
      epidemics and vices contracted from white men, the poor
      Indians vainly struggling to avert their doom of
      extermination have elicited the sympathy and commiseration of
      the civilized world. The theory advocated in the preceding
      part of this work . . . in regard to the decay and extinction
      of savage races, does not forbid regrets that such a people
      should have suffered so greviously at the hands of the United
      States Government, by the greed of its agents, the frauds of
      traders, and the fatal contagion of the vices of a civilized
      people. What with American rifles and American whiskey, their
      extinction has been rapid, and their doom certain.<br />
      <br />
      . . . Here we have the secret of many of the barbarities of
      the Indian tribes. Inflamed and imbruted by the whiskey sold
      them, their ignorance imposed upon by the greed of traders
      and even government agents, having little or no chance for
      securing justice in their real or imagined injuries, there is
      certainly some extenuation if this wild son of the forest go
      forth with tomahawk and scalping knife, as the self-appointed
      avenger of his own and his people's wrongs. This is not the
      place, if there were room, for a thorough discussion of the
      wrongs of the Red Men, but I cannot forgo the duty, in
      treating of the manners, customs and character of tribes so
      interesting, so noble and superior, by many traits, to most
      savage races, of recording at the same time, this tribute and
      testimony. It will unquestionably be the verdict of the
      future, as coming generations shall study the memorials and
      character of the North American Indians.<font size=
