        <p>The Mexican camp has little of that bustling energy
        which belongs to its neighbor on the floor below. It wakes
        up slowly in the morning,--especially if the morning be
        cold,--and lounges abroad on moonlight nights, when
        guitar-tinklings sound from the shadowy vine-flecked
        porches. The barest little cabin has its porch, its
        climbing vines and shelf of carefully tended plants.
        Dark-eyed women sit on the door-steps in the sun braiding a
        child's hair, perhaps, or chattering to a neighbor, who
        leans against the door-post with a baby half hidden in the
        folds of her shawl. They walk up and down the hilly street,
        letting their gowns trail in the dust, their heads
        enveloped in a shawl, one end of which is turned up over
        the shoulder; the smooth, sliding step corresponds with the
        accent in speaking. In passing, they look at you with a
        slow, grave stare like that of a child. All, even to the
        babies, have an air of repose; crudeness of voice or manner
        is almost unknown among them.</p>

        <p>The first time I went down into the mine one of the men
        of the party, as is the custom, passed a bottle of whisky
        among the men in each "lab&oacute;r" we visited. The
        Cornish men drank in a hearty, unconstrained fashion
        enough, but each Mexican, before raising the bottle to his
        lips, turned to the two women of the party with a grave
        inclination and a Buena salud, Se&ntilde;oras! . .

        <p>    My last visit to the Mexican camp was during the
        yellow hazy July weather; it was after a fire had swept
        away all the houses lying below and around the rock, which
        rises like a fortress at the north-west end of camp. The
        bare sun-baked rock stood out, with all its reddish-yellow
        lights and purple-brown shadows, in strong relief against
        the solid blue of the sky. Down its sides were the
        blackened lines of brick which marked the foundations of
        the ruined houses. Below, was the little street silent and
        deserted, with its quiet afternoon shadows stretching
        across it. It seemed old enough for anything. It might have
        been a little Pompeiian street lying so still in the broad
        sunlight, under that intensely blue-bright sky. I sat under
        the shadow of a Mexican cabin on the high bank overlooking
        the street. A little girl named Amelia, too slight and
        small to carry the child she held wrapped in an old shawl,
        stood beside me and told me the Spanish words for rock, and
        sky, and picture, and the names of her brothers and
        sisters. The mother, leaning on the railing of the rough
        balcony above, smiled down at me and counted them on her
        fingers--six in all--and then crossed both hands on her
        breast with a proud and gentle gesture of triumph in the
        possession of the six. The cheerfulness of the whole
        family,--brown, ragged, ill-fed, sickly and numerous as
        they were,--a cheerfulness which implied no hope or even
        understanding of anything better, was the saddest thing in
        the whole of that warm, sunny desolation.</p>
