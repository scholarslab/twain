      I was informed by one of the few ladies who had been to the
      Valley, whom I met in San Francisco, that it was next to an
      impossibility to accomplish the journey without arraying
      myself in a Bloomer costume. Pardon me that I recoiled at
      this. I feel that my charms are not so numerous that I can
      afford to lessen them by the adoption of this most ungraceful
      and most unbecoming of dresses; but when she assured me that
      it was almost a necessary precaution against being thrown
      from the horse to ride astride, I saw at once that my time
      had come, and a Bloomer costume I must wear. The dressmaker
      to whom I applied had made others, and needed no instructions
      when I told her I was going to the Yo Semite. She carved me
      out a costume; but pardon me once more if I shrink from the
      task of describing it. It was simply hideous. . . .<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      To California women who think nothing of jumping astride an
      unbroken horse and riding him bareback, the trip to Yo Semite
      presents few hardships. I refer to women who live in the
      mountain towns, for California city women are, like most city
      women, dainty and delicate. Very few of these visit Yo
      Semite, believe me. . . .<br />
