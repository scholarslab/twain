      <td>A<font size="-1">FTER</font> trying hard to climb Mount
      Whitney without success, and having returned to the plains, I
      enjoyed my two days' rest in hot Visalia . . . Everybody was
      of interest to me, not excepting the two Mexican mountaineers
      who monopolized the agent at Wells, Fargo &amp; Co.'s office,
      causing me delay. They were transacting some little item of
      business, and stood loafing by the counter, mechanically
      jingling huge spurs and shrugging their shoulders as they
      chatted in a dull, sleepy way. At the door they paused,
      keeping up quite a lively dispute, without apparently
      noticing me as I drew a small bag of gold and put it in my
      pocket. There was no especial reason why I should remark the
      stolid, brutal cast of their countenances, as I thought them
      not worse than the average Californian greaser; but it
      occurred to me that one might as well guess at a geological
      formation as to attempt to judge the age of mountaineers,
      because they get very early in life a fixed expression, which
      is deepened by continual rough weathering and undisturbed
      accumulations of dirt. I observed them enough to see that the
      elder was a man of middle height, of wiry, light figure and
      thin hawk visage; a certain angular sharpness making itself
      noticeable about the shoulders and arms, which tapered to
      small almost refined hands. A mere fringe of perfectly
      straight black beard followed the curve of his chin, tangling
      itself at the ear with shaggy unkempt locks of hair. He wore
      an ordinary stiff-brimmed Spanish sombrero, and the
      inevitable greasy red sash performed its rather difficult
      task of holding together flannel shirt and buckskin breeches,
      besides half covering with folds a long narrow knife.<br />
      <br />
      His companion struck me as a half-breed Indian, somewhere
      about eighteen years of age, his beardless face showing deep
      brutal lines, and a mouth which was a mere crease between
      hideously heavy lips. Blood stained the rowels of his spurs;
      an old felt hat, crumpled and ragged, slouched forward over
      his eyes, doing its best to hide the man.<br />
      <br />
      I thought them a hard couple, and summed up their traits at
      stolidity and utter cruelty.<br /></td>
