        <p>    A<font size="-1">MERICAN</font> P<font size=
        "-1">ROGRESS</font>--This beautiful picture, which will be
        found opposite the title page, is purely national in
        design, and represents the United States' portion of the
        American Continent in its beauty and variety, from the
        Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, illustrating at a glance the
        grand drama of Progress in the civilization, settlement and
        history of this country.</p>

        <p>    In the foreground, the central and principal figure,
        a beautiful and charming female, is floating westward
        through the air, bearing on her forehead the "Star of
        Empire." She has left the cities of the east far behind,
        crossed the Alleghanies and the "Father of Waters," and
        still her march is westward. In her right hand she carries
        a book--common schools--the emblem of education and the
        testimonial of our national enlightenment, while with the
        left hand she unfolds and stretches the slender wires of
        the telegraph, that are to flash intelligence throughout
        the land. On the right of the picture, is a city,
        steamships, manufacturies, schools and churches, over which
        beams of light are streaming and filling the
        air--indicative of civilization. The general tone of the
        picture on the left, declares darkness, waste and
        confusion. From the city proceed the three great
        continental lines of railway, passing the frontier
        settlers' rude cabin and tending toward the Western Ocean.
        Next to these are the transportation wagons, overland
        stage, hunters, gold-seekers, pony-express, the pioneer
        emigrant and the war-dance of the "noble red man." Fleeing
        from "Progress," and towards the blue waters of the
        Pacific, which shows itself on the left of the picture
        beyond the snow-capped summits of the Sierra Nevadas, are
        the Indians, buffaloes, wild horses, bears, and other game,
        moving westward--ever westward--the Indians with their
        squaws, papooses, and "pony-lodges," turn their despairing
        faces towards, as they flee from, the presence of the
        wondrous vision. The "Star" is <i>too much for
        them</i>.</p>

        <p>    What American man, woman or child, does not feel a
        heart-throb of exultation as they think of the glorious
        achievements of P<font size="-1">ROGRESS</font> since the
        landing of the Pilgrim Fathers, on stanch old Plymouth
        Rock!</p>

        <p>    This picture was the design of the publisher of the
        T<font size="-1">OURIST</font>, who has had it chromoed in
        <i>nineteen colors</i>, making a magnificent picture, which
        is given <i>free</i> to each subscriber to CROFUTT'S
        WESTERN WORLD, $1.50 a year.</p>

        <p>    Is there a home, from the miner's humble cabin to
        the stately marble mansion of the capitalist, that can
        afford to be without this G<font size="-1">REAT</font>
        National picture, which illustrates in the most artistic
        manner all the gigantic results of American brains and
        hands? Who would not have such a beautiful token to remind
        them of our country's grandeur and enterprise, which have
        caused the mighty wilderness to blossom like the rose!</p>
