      . . . I have said that the trip was <i>de rigueur</i>. No
      sooner do you announce to your friends in New York that you
      are going to California than they immediately cry out, "Ah,
      then you will see the Yo Semite!" . . .<br />
      <br />
      I have known Californians who went to New York, and returned
      home without seeing the Adirondacks; but wo betide the
      wandering Easterner if he seek the Pacific without bringing a
      trip to Yo Semite back with him! All along the railroad
      westward he is badgered with inquiries as to the probable
      date of his journey to Yo Semite; and when, after the long
      ride across the continent, he is received at last within the
      hospitable walls of one of San Francisco's grand hotels, the
      first thing he receives is the card of the agent for Yo
      Semite, who encloses a small map showing the three different
      modes of reaching the same. . . .<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      The dawn breaks in the morning of the next day, and shining
      red as fire through the pine knots of the log cabin where
      Hutchings dwells, strikes our leaden eyelids and bids us
      arise. Reluctantly we do so. This is the end of our
      wanderings. Here is the great prize to obtain a view of which
      we have come so many weary miles. Now we are to be repaid for
      all. We make a hurried toilet, and as quickly as our
      stiffened limbs will permit, we drag out to see the view
      which shall awe us, shall make us lose our identity, shall
      cause us to feel as though we were in the spirit
      land."<font size="+1"><b><a href=
      "javascript:Start2('logannote1.html')">*</a></b></font><br />
      <br />
      And what do we see? Tall rocks, a few tall trees, a high and
      narrow waterfall, a pretty little river! No more. A lovely
      natural scene, I grant you; but oh! where in this broad and
      beautiful land of ours are not lovely natural scenes the
      rule? Words cannot tell the feelings of cold despair which
      came over me and all our party as we looked about us. Was it
      for this we had so suffered? . . .<br />
      <br />
      We never rallied from that first impression.<br />
      <br />
      "But that stone wall is nearly a mile high."<br />
      <br />
      It may be so, but it does not look it; and if it did, the
      stars are higher, and, thank God, the stars shine at
      home!<br />
      <br />
      "That waterfall is eleven times higher than Niagara."<br />
      <br />
      Indeed! It looks like a fireman's hose playing over the top
      of Stewart's store.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      . . . By another day some of us are well enough to mount
      again and begin our search after Beauty. We find an
      occasional rattlesnake, unlimited fatigue, and the tombstone
      of a man who was kicked to death by his horse. The trips are
      very wearying, the scenery very grand, very beautiful, but we
      are in no condition to enjoy it. We never get in such
      condition, and the universal verdict with us is that if every
      one of the waterfalls in Yo Semite were magnified, every one
      of its granite domes were an Olympus, if its rivers were the
      Rhine, and its valley the fairy gardens of Versailles, the
      sight of it would not repay one for the suffering involved in
      getting to it. And the plain truth is that nine out of ten
      who visit Yo Semite think this, but they will not say what
      they think. Some people, it is true, never have an opinion of
      their own, but parrot-like repeat the refrain which has been
      set them to sing. You remember in the pages of Most Glorious
      Twain the ugly little girl they saw in the Holy Land, and
      frank Mark's astonishment at everybody's bawling out in
      chorus, "What Madonna like beauty!" He knew there was an
      explanation. He afterward found the keynote. It was struck in
      old Grimes's (Dead) Book on the Holy Land. So with the Yo
      Semite. "I felt awed!--the spirit land--losing your own
      identity."<br />
      <br />
      O travelled monkey! Dare to tell the truth, why do you not?
      Because you are afraid some other travelled monkey will say
      you "can't appreciate" the scenery which it makes your head
      ache to look at, and your bones ache to get at. Because you
      are a coward, or because you know you have made an idiot of
      yourself, and flung away your money by handfuls, and endured
      the tortures of purgatory; and you are ashamed to confess
      yourself so easily taken in and done for--man of the world
      that you are. But I am only a woman, and I confess all.<br />
