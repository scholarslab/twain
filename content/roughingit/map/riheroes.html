      <td>I<font size="-1">N</font> a little while all interest was
      taken up in stretching our necks and watching for the
      "pony-rider"--the fleet messenger who sped across the
      continent from St. Joe to Sacramento, carrying letters
      nineteen hundred miles in eight days! Think of that for
      perishable horse and human flesh and blood to do! The
      pony-rider was usually a little bit of a man, brimful of
      spirit and endurance. No matter what time of the day or night
      his watch came on, and no matter whether it was winter or
      summer, raining, snowing, hailing, or sleeting, or whether
      his "beat" was a level straight road or a crazy trail over
      mountain crags and precipices, or whether it led through
      peaceful regions or regions that swarmed with hostile
      Indians, he must be always ready to leap into the saddle and
      be off like the wind! There was no idling-time for a
      pony-rider on duty. He rode fifty miles without stopping, by
      daylight, moonlight, starlight, or through the blackness of
      darkness--just as it happened. He rode a splendid horse that
      was born for a racer and fed and lodged like a gentleman;
      kept him at his utmost speed for ten miles, and then, as he
      came crashing up to the station where stood two men holding
      fast a fresh, impatient steed, the transfer of rider and
      mail-bag was made in the twinkling of an eye, and away flew
      the eager pair and were out of sight before the spectator
      could get hardly the ghost of a look. Both rider and horse
      went "flying light." The rider's dress was thin, and fitted
      close; he wore a "round-about," and a skull-cap, and tucked
      his pantaloons into his boot-tops like a race-rider. He
      carried no arms--he carried nothing that was not absolutely
      necessary, for even the postage on his literary freight was
      worth <i>five dollars a letter</i>. He got but little
      frivolous correspondence to carry--his bag had business
      letters in it, mostly. His horse was stripped of all
      unnecessary weight, too. He wore a little wafer of a
      racing-saddle, and no visible blanket. He wore light shoes,
      or none at all. The little flat mail-pockets strapped under
      the rider's thighs would each hold about the bulk of a
      child's primer. They held many and many an important business
      chapter and newspaper letter, but these were written on paper
      as airy and thin as gold-leaf, nearly, and thus bulk and
      weight were economized. The stage-coach traveled about a
      hundred to a hundred and twenty-five miles a day (twenty-four
      hours), the pony-rider about two hundred and fifty. There
      were about eighty pony-riders in the saddle all the time,
      night and day, stretching in a long, scattering procession
      from Missouri to California, forty flying eastward, and forty
      toward the west, and among them making four hundred gallant
      horses earn a stirring livelihood and see a deal of scenery
      every single day in the year.<br />

      <a href="javascript:Start('herri8.jpg')"><img src=
        "herri8t.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" alt="1872 ILLUSTRATION" /></a> We had had a
      consuming desire, from the beginning, to see a pony-rider,
      but somehow or other all that passed us and all that met us
      managed to streak by in the night, and so we heard only a
      whiz and a hail, and the swift phantom of the desert was gone
      before we could get our heads out of the windows. But now we
      were expecting one along every moment, and would see him in
      broad daylight. Presently the driver exclaims:<br />
      <br />
      "H<font size="-1">ERE HE COMES</font>!"<br />
      <br />
      Every neck is stretched further, and every eye strained
      wider. Away across the endless dead level of the prairie a
      black speck appears against the sky, and it is plain that it
      moves. Well, I should think so! In a second or two it becomes
      a horse and rider, rising and falling, rising and
      falling--sweeping toward us nearer and nearer--growing more
      and more distinct, more and more sharply defined--nearer and
      still nearer, and the flutter of the hoofs comes faintly to
      the ear--another instant a whoop and a hurrah from our upper
      deck, a wave of the rider's hand, but no reply, and man and
      horse burst past our excited faces, and go winging away like
      a belated fragment of a storm!<br />
      <br />
      So sudden is it all, and so like a flash of unreal fancy,
      that but for the flake of white foam left quivering and
      perishing on a mail-sack after the vision had flashed by and
      disappeared, we might have doubted whether we had seen any
      actual horse and man at all, maybe.<br />
