        the "Pony Express" was new to this continent, though not to
        the Old World. Its use there has not been forgotten or
        abandoned; but its day is already nearly ended with us. It
        came into existence here as the fore-runner of the
        telegraph and the railroad: it is still used in the old
        countries in default of these more rapid means of
        communication and transportation. Three years after the
        pony first began to run express in America the harnessed
        lightning distanced him on his own track . . .</p>

        <p>The Overland Pony Express from the Missouri to the
        Pacific was established in 1859, and from its first
        inauguration was splendidly run, sometimes carrying letters
        from Atchison, Kansas, to Sacramento, California, a
        distance of about 2000 miles, in eight days -- that is,
        averaging two hundred and fifty miles per day. Once
        important dispatches -- election news, of course -- were
        carried from Saint Joseph's, Missouri, to Denver City,
        Colorado, 625 miles, in sixty-nine hours; the last ten
        miles being made in thirty-one minutes. The posts were
        originally 25 miles apart, and the steeds employed were the
        small, fleet, hardy Indian horses. The rider kept his pony
        on the full run, and when he reached a new station,
        whatever the hour of day or night, another messenger, ready
        mounted and waiting, took the little mail sack, struck
        spurs to his steed, and was off like the wind.</p>

        <p>Our centre engraving on this page is from a painting by
        George M. Ottinger, of Great Salt Lake City, who has finely
        illustrated the spirit of this age and this people in both
        the choice and the execution of his subject. The chosen
        scene of the picture is near Chimney Rock, on the North
        Platte River; the express rider is cheering the men who are
        raising the telegraph-poles. It adds to the interest of the
        picture that it represents an actual and
        frequently-recurring scene, as, in the summer of 1862 while
        the telegraph was in course of erection, the fitting by of
        the express boy was a daily sensation for the
        work-men.</p><br />
