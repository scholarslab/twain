        Missouri, we struggled and in twenty miles reached better
        roads and finer farms, with neat cottages. In the corner,
        between the Big Sioux and Missouri River, is a French
        settlement, while further on are many Scandinavian
        settlements, and elsewhere Bohemians, though the prevailing
        population is American. . . . On either side of the road
        were waving heavy fields of grain, just ripe, and in them
        were reaping machines at work. All the people seemed busy
        and fairly prosperous. We saw one noticeable sight. A Dane,
        about six feet in height, was driving four oxen to a
        self-raker, and two big Danish women binding after it.
        Farther away were Norwegian women binding and shocking
        wheat. Oh! Anthony, Stanton, Stevens, how would not your
        tears of sympathy have been shed at this sight. But I
        suppose there is no relief. The Legislature of Dakota, last
        winter, refused to enfranchise the sex of which ye are the
        representatives. In Dakota they evidently have an eye
        rather to the utility of women than her rights. But I
        thought how blessed were these people from Norway and
        Sweden, that they could come to so goodly a land and on
        their own farms be privileged to gather such
        crops.</p><br />
