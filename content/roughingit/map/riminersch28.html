        without shame, that I expected to find masses of silver
        lying all about the ground. I expected to see it glittering
        in the sun on the mountain summits. I said nothing about
        this, for some instinct told me that I might possibly have
        an exaggerated idea about it, and so if I betrayed my
        thought I might bring derision upon myself. Yet I was as
        perfectly satisfied in my own mind as I could be of
        anything, that I was going to gather up, in a day or two,
        or at furthest a week or two, silver enough to make me
        satisfactorily wealthy--and so my fancy was already busy
        with plans for spending this money. The first opportunity
        that offered, I sauntered carelessly away from the cabin,
        keeping an eye on the other boys, and stopping and
        contemplating the sky when they seemed to be observing me;
        but as soon as the coast was manifestly clear, I fled away
        as guiltily as a thief might have done and never halted
        till I was far beyond sight and call. Then I began my
        search with a feverish excitement that was brimful of
        expectation--almost of certainty. I crawled about the
        ground, seizing and examining bits of stone, blowing the
        dust from them or rubbing them on my clothes, and then
        peering at them with anxious hope. Presently I found a
        bright fragment and my heart bounded! I hid behind a
        boulder and polished it and scrutinized it with a nervous
        eagerness and a delight that was more pronounced than
        absolute certainty itself could have afforded. The more I
        examined the fragment the more I was convinced that I had
        found the door to fortune. I marked the spot and carried
        away my specimen. Up and down the rugged mountain side I
        searched, with always increasing interest and always
        augmenting gratitude that I had come to Humboldt and come
        in time. Of all the experiences of my life, this secret
        search among the hidden treasures of silver-land was the
        nearest to unmarred ecstasy. It was a delirious revel. By
        and by, in the bed of a shallow rivulet, I found a deposit
        of shining yellow scales, and my breath almost forsook me!
        A gold mine, and in my simplicity I had been content with
        vulgar silver! I was so excited that I half believed my
        overwrought imagination was deceiving me. Then a fear came
        upon me that people might be observing me and would guess
        my secret. Moved by this thought, I made a circuit of the
        place, and ascended a knoll to reconnoiter. Solitude. No
        creature was near. Then I returned to my mine, fortifying
        myself against possible disappointment, but my fears were
        groundless--the shining scales were still there. I set
        about scooping them out, and for an hour I toiled down the
        windings of the stream and robbed its bed. But at last the
        descending sun warned me to give up the quest, and I turned
        homeward laden with wealth. As I walked along I could not
        help smiling at the thought of my being so excited over my
        fragment of silver when a nobler metal was almost under my
        nose. In this little time the former had so fallen in my
        estimation that once or twice I was on the point of
        throwing it away.</p>

        <p>The boys were as hungry as usual, but I could eat
        nothing. Neither could I talk. I was full of dreams and far
        away. Their conversation interrupted the flow of my fancy
        somewhat, and annoyed me a little, too. I despised the
        sordid and commonplace things they talked about. But as
        they proceeded, it began to amuse me. It grew to be rare
        fun to hear them planning their poor little economies and
        sighing over possible privations and distresses when a gold
        mine, all our own, lay within sight of the cabin and I
        could point it out at any moment. Smothered hilarity began
        to oppress me, presently. It was hard to resist the impulse
        to burst out with exultation and reveal everything; but I
        did resist. I said within myself that I would filter the
        great news through my lips calmly and be serene as a summer
        morning while I watched its effect in their faces. I
        said:</p>

        <p>"Where have you all been?"</p>

        <p>"Prospecting."</p>

        <p>"What did you find?"</p>

        <p>"Nothing."</p>

        <p>"Nothing? What do you think of the country?"</p>

        <p>"Can't tell, yet," said Mr. Ballou, who was an old gold
        miner, and had likewise had considerable experience among
        the silver mines.</p>

        <p>"Well, haven't you formed any sort of opinion?"</p>

        <p>"Yes, a sort of a one. It's fair enough here, may be,
        but overrated. Seven thousand dollar ledges are scarce,
        though. That Sheba may be rich enough, but we don't own it;
        and besides, the rock is so full of base metals that all
        the science in the world can't work it. We'll not starve,
        here, but we'll not get rich, I'm afraid."</p>

        <p>"So you think the prospect is pretty poor?"</p>

        <p>"No name for it!"</p>

        <p>"Well, we'd better go back, hadn't we?"</p>

        <p>"Oh, not yet--of course not. We'll try it a riffle,
        first."</p>

        <p>"Suppose, now--this is merely a supposition, you
        know--suppose you could find a ledge that would yield, say,
        a hundred and fifty dollars a ton--would that satisfy
        you?"</p>

        <p>"Try us once!" from the whole party.</p>

        <p>"Or suppose--merely a supposition, of course--suppose
        you were to find a ledge that would yield two thousand
        dollars a ton--would <i>that</i> satisfy you?"</p>

        <p>"Here--what do you mean? What are you coming at? Is
        there some mystery behind all this?"</p>

        <p>"Never mind. I am not saying anything. You know
        perfectly well there are no rich mines here--of course you
        do. Because you have been around and examined for
        yourselves. Anybody would know that, that had been around.
        But just for the sake of argument, suppose--in a kind of
        general way--suppose some person were to tell you that
        two-thousand-dollar ledges were simply
        contemptible--contemptible, understand--and that right
        yonder in sight of this very cabin there were piles of pure
        gold and pure silver--oceans of it--enough to make you all
        rich in twenty-four hours! Come!"</p>

        <p>"I should say he was as crazy as a loon!" said old
        Ballou, but wild with excitement, nevertheless.</p>

        <p><a href="javascript:Start2('mnrri28b.jpg')"><img src=
          "mnrri28bt.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" alt="1872 ILLUSTRATION" /></a>"Gentlemen,"
        said I, "I don't say anything--<i>I</i> haven't been
        around, you know, and of course don't know anything--but
        all I ask of you is to cast your eye on <i>that</i>, for
        instance, and tell me what you think of it!" and I tossed
        my treasure before them.</p>

        <p>There was an eager scramble for it, and a closing of
        heads together over it under the candle-light. Then old
        Ballou said:</p>

        <p>"Think of it? I think it is nothing but a lot of granite
        rubbish and nasty glittering mica that isn't worth ten
        cents an acre!"</p>

        <p>So vanished my dream. So melted my wealth away. So
        toppled my airy castle to the earth and left me stricken
        and forlorn.</p>

        <p>Moralizing, I observed, then, that "all that glitters is
        not gold."</p>

        <p>Mr. Ballou said I could go further than that, and lay it
        up among my treasures of knowledge, that <i>nothing</i>
        that glitters is gold. So I learned then, once for all,
        that gold in its native state is but dull, unornamental
        stuff, and that only low-born metals excite the admiration
        of the ignorant with an ostentatious glitter. However, like
        the rest of the world, I still go on underrating men of
        gold and glorifying men of mica. Commonplace human nature
        cannot rise above that.</p>
