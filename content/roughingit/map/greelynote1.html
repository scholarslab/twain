  <blockquote>
    <font size="+1"><b>*</b></font> Another feature of President
    Young's remarks on this topic strikes me on revision. He
    assumed as undeniable that, outside of the Mormon general rule,
    married men usually kept mistresses--that incontinence is the
    general rule, and continence the rare exception. This
    assumption was habitual with the Mormons who, at various times,
    discussed with me the subject of polygamy.
