        <b>[From] Chapter I.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>  The old Indian love of commemorating events by
        significant names is well illustrated in Kansas. One
        example may be given here. Waukarusa once opposed its
        swollen tide to an exploring band of red men. Now, from
        time beyond ken, the noble savage has been illustrious for
        the ingenuity with which he lays all disagreeable duties
        upon the shoulders of the patient squaw. He may ride to
        their death, in free wild sport, the bison multitudes; but
        their skins must be converted into marketable robes, and
        the flesh into jerked meat, by the ugly and over-worked
        partner of his bosom. While she pins the raw hide to earth,
        and bends patiently over, fleshing it with horn hatchet for
        weary hours, the stronger vessel, his abdominal recesses
        wadded with buffalo meat, toasts his moccasined feet by the
        fire, fills his lungs with smoke from villainous
        killikinick, and muses soothingly of white scalps and happy
        hunting grounds.</p>

        Ox-like maiden, happy "big injun!" you both belong to an
        age and a history well nigh past, and let us rejoice that
        it is so.</p>

        <p>  But to return to the band long since gathered into
        aboriginal dust whom we left pausing on the banks of the
        Waukarusa. "Deep water, bad bottom!" grunted the braves,
        and, nothing doubting it, one loving warrior pushed his
        wife and her pony over the bank to test the matter. From
        the middle of the tide the squaw called back, "Waukarusa"
        (thigh deep), and soon had gained the opposite bank in
        safety. Then and there the creek received its name,
        "Waukarusa."</p>

          We procured a remarkable sketch, in the well known Indian
        style of high art, commemorative of this event. It has
        always struck us that the savage order of drawing resembles
        very much that of the ancient Egyptian--except in the
        matter of drawing at sight, with bow or rifle, on the white
        man.</p><br />

        <b>[From] Chapter VI.</b><br />

        . . . So far along our route we had seen but few Indians,
        and those civilized specimens, such as straggle
        occasionally through the streets of Topeka. The Indian
        reservations in Kansas are at some distance apart, and
        their inhabitants frequently exchange visits. The few whom
        we had seen consisted of Osages, Kaws, Pottawatomies, and
        Sioux, all equally dirty, but the last affecting clothes
        more than the others, and eschewing paint. The members of
        this tribe, generally speaking, have good farms and are
        worth a handsome average per head. At the time of our visit
        they were expecting a half million dollars or so from
        Washington, and were soon to become American citizens. One
        privilege of this citizenship struck us as very peculiar.
        By the State law, as long as an Indian is simply an Indian,
        he can buy no whisky, and is thus cruelly debarred from the
        privilege of getting drunk, but once a voter, he can
        luxuriate in corn juice and the calaboose, as well as his
        white brother. What a travesty upon American civilization
        and politics!</p><br />

        Sachem produced a roll of dirty brown paper and said that
        he had studied the Indian question and found two sides to
        it. One he could give us in a nutshell, believing that the
        meat of the nut had often excited the spirit of war.</p>

        <b>[From] Chapter IX. Arrival at [Fort] Hays.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>  The post possessed considerable military importance,
        being the base of operations for the Indian country. We
        found Sheridan there, an officer who won his fame gallantly
        and on the gallop. During the summer our red brethren had
        been gathering a harvest of scalps, and, in return, our
        army was now preparing to gather in the gentle savage.</p>

        <p>  We had read accounts in the newspapers, some time
        before, of the capture of Fort Wallace and of attacks on
        military posts. Such stories were not only untrue; but
        exceedingly ridiculous as well. Lo is not sound on the
        assault question. His chivalrous soul warms, however, when
        some forlorn Fenian, with spade on shoulder and thoughts
        far off with Biddy in Erin's Isle, crosses his vision.
        Being satisfied that Patrick has no arms, his only defense
        being utter harmlessness, and well knowing that the sight
        of a painted skin, rendered sleek by boiled dog's meat,
        will make him frantic with terror, the soul of the noble
        savage expands. No more shall the spade, held so jauntily,
        throw Kansas soil on the bed of the Pacific Railroad; and
        the scalp, yet tingling with the boiling of incipient
        Fenian revolutions underneath, on the pole of a distant
        wigwam will soon gladden the eyes of the traditionally
        beautiful Indian bride, as with dirty hands she throws
        tender puppies into the pot for her warrior's feast. The
        savage hand, crimson since childhood, descends with defiant
        ring upon the tawny breast, and, with a cry of, "Me big
        Indian, ha, whoop!" down sweeps Lo upon the defenseless
        Hibernian. A startled stare, a shriek of wild agony, a
        hurried prayer to "our Mary mother," and Erin's son
        christens those far-off points of the Pacific Railroad with
        his blood. A rapid circle of hunting-knife and the scalp is
        lifted, a few twangs of the bow fills the body with arrows,
        there is a rapid vault into the saddle, and a mutilated
        corpse, with feathered tips, like pins in a cushion,
        dotting its surface, alone remains to tell the tale of
        horror.</p>

        <p><a href=
        "javascript:Start3('figures2/indwebb05.jpg')"><img src=

        Blood had been every-where on the railroad, which reached
        across the plains like a steel serpent spotted with red.
        There was now a cessation of hostilities, and Indian agents
        were reported to be on the way from Washington to pacify
        the tribes. As they had been a long time in coming, the
        inference was irresistible that the popping of champagne
        corks was a much more pleasant experience than that of
        Indian guns would have been. The harvest of scalps had
        reached high noon some time before. Far off, south of the
        Arkansas, the savages had their home, and from thence, like
        baleful will-o'-the-wisps, they would suddenly flash out,
        and then flash back when pursued, and be lost in those
        remote regions. Lately, United States troops have been so
        placed that the Indian villages may be struck, if
        necessary, and retaliation had; and this, together with the
        pacificatory efforts of the Quaker agents, is doing much to
        bring about a condition of things which promises permanent
        peace.</p><br />
        <hr width="55%" />
        <br />

        <p>  The evening before our departure we rode over to the
        fort and called upon General Sheridan. . . .</p>

        <p>  We found the General thoroughly conversant with the
        difficult task to which he had been called. "Place the
        Indians on reservations," he said, "under their own chiefs,
        with an honest white superintendency. Let the civil law
        reign on the reservation, military law away from it, every
        Indian found by the troops off from his proper limits to be
        treated as an outlaw." It seemed to me that in a few brief
        sentences this mapped out a successful Indian policy, part
        of which indeed has since been adopted, and the remainder
        may yet be.</p>

        <p>  When speaking of late savageries on the plains the
        eyes of "Little Phil" glittered wickedly. In one case, on
        Spillman's Creek, a band of Cheyennes had thrust a rusty
        sword into the body of a woman with child, piercing alike
        mother and offspring, and, giving it a fiendish twist, left
        the weapon in her body, the poor woman being found by our
        soldiers yet living.</p>

        <p>  "I believe it possible," said Sheridan, "at once and
        forever to stop these terrible crimes." As he spoke,
        however, we saw what he apparently did not, a long string
        of red tape, of which one end was pinned to his official
        coat-tail, while the other remained in the hands of the
        Department at Washington. Soon after, as Sheridan pushed
        forward, the Washington end twitched vigorously. He
        managed, however, with his right arm, Custer, to deal a
        sledge-hammer blow, which broke to fragments the Cheyenne
        Blackkettle and his band. Whether or not that band had been
        guilty of the recent murders, the property of the slain was
        found in their possession, and the terrible punishment
        caused the residue of the tribe to sue for peace. It was
        the first time for years that the war spirit had placed any
        horrors at their doors, and that one terrible lesson
        prepared the savage mind for the advent of peace
        commissioners.</p><br />
        <hr width="55%" />
        <br />
        <b>[From] Chapter XI.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>  Our ideas of the savage had been so thoroughly
        Cooperised during boyhood, that when our guide approached
        the Wolf, and, with a gesture to the south, invited him
        back to Hays, I was prepared to see the tall form
        straighten in the saddle, and pictured to my imagination
        some such specimen of untutored eloquence as this:</p>

        <p>  "Pale-face, the blood of the Cheyenne burns quick. He
        meets you trailing like a serpent across his warpath,
        seeking to steal treasures from the red man's land. He asks
        food, and you tell him to come into your trap and get it.
        Pale-faces, remove your hats; noble Cheyennes, remove their
        scalps!"</p>

        <p>  Nothing of this kind occurred, however. Our guide
        informed us that the bold savage simply fastened one button
        of his tailless coat, grunted out "Ugh!" in a satisfied
        way, and motioned his band to follow. This they did, and we
        were soon retracing our steps to Hays; by the guide's
        advice, making the savages keep a fair distance behind
        us.</p><br />
        <hr width="55%" />
        <br />
        <b>[From] Chapter XXIX.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>  Of one fact our journey thoroughly convinced us. Lo's
        forte has no connection with the fort of the pale-faces. An
        unguarded hunter, or a defenseless emigrant wagon, or
        unarmed railroad laborer, gratifies sufficiently his most
        warlike ambition. The savages of the plains, in their
        attacks upon the whites, have been like bees, stinging
        whenever opportunity offers, and immediately disappearing
        in space. Their excuses for the murders they commit have
        been as various as their moods. At one time it is a broken
        treaty, at another the killing of their buffalo, and
        trespassing upon the hunting-grounds, and again it is some
        other grievance. It may be some gratification for them to
        know that it is estimated that, until within the last three
        years, a white man's scalp atoned for each buffalo killed
        by his race.</p>

        <p>  In our various wars with the Indians, it is worthy of
        remark the bison have been like supply posts at convenient
        distances, to the hostile bands. Traveling without any
        supplies whatever, and therefore rapidly, a few moments
        suffice to kill a buffalo near the camping spot, and roast
        his flesh over the chips. The pony, meanwhile, makes a
        hearty meal on the grass. On the other hand, our troops, in
        pursuit of these bands, have had to encumber themselves
        with baggage wagons, or pack-mules, bearing food and
        forage.</p>
