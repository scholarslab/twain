        <b>[From] Chapter I. The Gadsden Purchase.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>I have thus at some length attempted to account for the
        tardy growth of this interesting Territory. It will be
        admitted that there is good reason why Arizona has failed
        to attract a population. With wonderful resources and a
        climate equal to that of Italy, it has suffered a series of
        misfortunes unparalleled in the history of our territorial
        possessions. Two great obstacles to the prosperity of the
        country still exist: difficulty of access, which can only
        be remedied by a port on the Gulf of California; and the
        hostility of the Apache Indians, for which there is no
        remedy short of extermination.</p><br />
        <hr width="55%" />
        <br />
        <b>[From] Chapter IV. Fort Yuma.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>Next day Superintendent Poston and myself held a grand
        pow-wow with the Yuma chiefs and their people. From all
        parts of the neighborhood they came; warriors, squaws, and
        children; from the mesquit bushes and mudholes of the
        Colorado; from the sloos and the arroyas of the Gila; the
        cotton-woods and the deserts and the mountains of Castle
        Dome. Every village had its delegation of dusky
        tatterdemalions. Lizards and snakes and mice were hastily
        cast aside in the wild anticipation of muck-a-muck from the
        Great Father. Hungry and lean, painted and bedizened with
        ornaments, they came in to receive the bounty of the mighty
        Federal chief. Great were the rejoicings when we opened the
        boxes and bales of merchandise so liberally furnished by
        the Government contractors, Cronin, Huxtall, &amp; Sears,
        of New York. Red, white, green, and gray blankets; military
        suits, glittering with tinsel; old swords, four feet long;
        sun-glasses for lighting cigars; and penny whistles for the
        small fry. It was indeed a wonderful display of the
        artistic triumphs of civilization, well calculated to
        impress the savage tribes of the Pacific with awe and
        admiration. There were axes of the best Collins brand, that
        flew to pieces like glass against the iron timbers of this
        anomalous region; and hats made by steam, and flaming red
        vests stitched by magic, and tobacco-boxes and tin kettles
        that might be opened, but never upon earth shut again.
        Surrounded by all the military paraphernalia of Fort Yuma,
        and with ceremony the most profound and impressive, we
        delivered our speeches and dry goods to the various chiefs;
        we gave them damaged hominy and hoes, and spades and
        shovels, and sashes and military buttons, charms, amulets,
        tobacco-boxes, and beads; shook them by the hand
        collectively and in detail, and pow-wowed generally in the
        approved style.</p>

        <p>Pasqual, the doughty head-chief of all the Yumas, long
        known to fame as the longest of his tribe, predominated
        over the ceremonies. A grave, cadaverous, leathery old
        gentleman, with hollow, wrinkled cheeks, and a prodigious
        nose, through the cartilage of which, between the nostrils,
        he wears a white bone ornamented with swinging pendants, is
        Pasqual the doughty. On account of the length of his arms
        and legs--which, when stretched out altogether, bear a
        strong similitude to the wind-mill against which Don
        Quixote ran a tilt--the mighty Pasqual is regarded with
        much respect and veneration by his tribe. His costume, on
        the present occasion, consisted of a shabby military coat,
        doubtless the same worn in ancient times by his friend,
        Major Heintzelman, the embroidery of which has long since
        been fretted out by wear and tear, and the elbows rubbed
        off by long collision with the multitudes of
        off&iuml;ce-seekers among his tribe. Of pantaloons he had
        but a remnant; and of boots or shoes he had none at all,
        save those originally furnished him by nature. But chiefly
        was Pasqual conspicuous for the ponderous bone and
        appendages that hung from his nose. A slight catarrh
        afflicted him at the time of our pow-wow, and it was not
        without great inconvenience that he managed the ornamental
        part of his countenance--turning repeatedly away to blow
        it, or adjust the awkward pendants that swung from it, and
        always reappearing with tears of anguish in his eyes. I
        took pity upon his sufferings and gave him some snuff,
        assuring him it was a sovereign remedy for colds in the
        head. The result was such a series of explosions,
        contortions of the facial muscles, and rattling of the
        ornamental bones, as to alarm me for the sanity of the
        doughty chief, who seemed quite wild with the accumulation
        of his agonies. The assembled wisdom of the nation grunted
        repeatedly in token of amazement; and Pasqual muttered,
        between the paroxysms of his affliction, "Ugh! muchee
        pepper belly strong dust! Burn 'um Injun nose!"</p>

        <p>Vincente, the next chief in command, dressed in a blue
        cotton shirt of the scantiest pattern. It reached only a
        short distance below his waist, and, for the matter of
        respect to the prejudices of civilization, might have ended
        at the collar. I really wish the contractors would furnish
        longer shirts for the Indians. The Yumas are tall, and I
        know of no tribe on this coast averaging only fourteen
        inches from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet.
        Vincente had probably received a hint that the distribution
        would be honored by the presence of ladies. What he lacked
        in costume he made up in paint. Both his eyes were
        encircled with yellow ochre; blue streaks adorned his
        cheeks; his nose was of a dazzling vermilion, and his legs
        were gorgeously striped with mud. His only additional
        article of costume, visible to the eye, was a dusky cotton
        diaper, ingeniously tied behind, leaving a long tail to
        flutter majestically in the breeze.</p>

        <p>Tebarro, the next great chief, wrapped himself in an
        American blanket, and dyed his face a gloomy black. I think
        he was in mourning. He wore tar on his head, and tar on his
        cheeks, and tar on his nose and chin, which becoming
        mingled with the grit and dust of the Colorado desert, gave
        him a sort of asphaltum look, like the house-tops and
        pavements of Los Angeles. When he stood in the sun he
        melted--such was the force of his grief. Black tears ran
        down from his head and cheeks and chin, and mingled with
        the wool of his blanket. Literally he wept tar.</p>

        <p>Antonio, the fourth great chief, wore a strap round his
        waist, with a rusty old sword tied to it by means of
        rawhide. He didn't wear any thing else, save the usual
        girdle of manta upon his loins, that could be considered an
        article of costume; but his eyes were gorgeously encircled
        by a cloud of blue paint fringed with vermilion. Like his
        illustrious superior, Pasqual, he wore pendent ornaments in
        his nose, of the most inconvenient pattern. I should judge
        Antonio carried a quarter of a pound of native jewelry,
        consisting of bone and lead, upon the cartilage of his
        proboscis.</p>

        <p>Juan, the fifth and last of noted warriors and head-men,
        was redundant in gamoose breeches and cotton rags. On his
        head he wore a helmet of Colorado mud, dried into the roots
        of his hair by the action of the sun. This I believe is
        accounted by the Yumas a sovereign remedy for vermin. The
        liveliest skipper is forever deprived of locomotion by the
        conglomerate of dried mud. When the helmet is broken off in
        segments, like a piece of baked crockery, it must present a
        curious spectacle of embalmed bodies.</p>

        <p>These distinguished chiefs and their people received the
        presents allotted to them with great dignity and
        good-humor. There was no grabbing or stealing, nor any sign
        of discontent. Every man received his share with
        satisfaction, and with gratitude to the Great Father in
        Washington. When they shook hands with us for the last
        time, and we were about to part, the scene was really
        affecting. I almost shed tears at it myself, unused as I am
        to crying about what can't be helped. In squads, and
        couples, and one by one, they affectionately took their
        leave, with their hoes and axes, spades and shovels,
        gimcracks and charms stuck all over them--in their sashes,
        breeches, clouties, blankets, and pinafores. One went with
        a necklace of mattocks around his neck and three Collins
        axes in his girdle; another with his head thrust into a
        glittering pile of tin-ware; while a third, one of the
        unbreeched multitude, wore a flying pan in front by way of
        an apron, and a corn-hoe behind, in the usual fashion of a
        rudder. Old men and young were tuning their jews'-harps;
        luxurious squaws were peeping at the redundant beauties
        reflected by their little zinc looking-glasses; children
        were blowing their tin whistles, and small fat papooses
        were hanging their heads out of compressed bundles behind
        their mothers, wondering, with open mouths and great round
        eyes, what could be the cause of all the hubbub. It was an
        impressive scene of barbarous happiness not easily
        forgotten. And so ended the Grand Pow-wow.</p>

        Our unhappy driver, George, who had never smiled during the
        whole course of the ceremonies, now turned away with an
        expression of the most profound and confirmed melancholy.
        Not even the warrior with the rudder, nor the chief with
        the mud roof to his head, could dissipate the intensity of
        his gloom. Nor were the blandishments of the dusky Yuma
        belles of any greater avail. With his hand pressed upon the
        pit of his stomach he groaned in agony of spirit as he
        descended the hill; and I fancied the plaintive words
        reached my ears, "Oh! Mary Jane, how could you? Think of
        him that loves you, and he among Injuns and
        savigges!"</p><br clear="left" />
        <hr width="55%" />
        <br />
        <b>[From] Chapter IX. The Pimo Villages.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>The number of Pimo villages is 10; Maricopas, 2;
        separate inclosures, 1000; total population, 6000. In 1858,
        the first year of the Overland Mail Line, the surplus crop
        of wheat was 100,000 pounds, which was purchased by the
        Company; also a large quantity of beans called
        <i>taperis</i>, and a vast quantity of pumpkins, squashes,
        and melons. In 1859 Mr. St. John was sent among them as a
        Special Agent with a supply of seeds and some agricultural
        implements. That year they sold 250,000 pounds of wheat and
        a large supply of melons, pumpkins, and beans. In 1860 they
        sold 400,000 pounds of wheat--all the Mail Company would
        purchase. They had more, and furnished the Government and
        private teamsters all that was necessary for transportation
        from Fort Yuma to Tucson. Beyoud this they had no market,
        except for about 40,000 pounds of wheat which Mr. White
        purchased for the supply of Fort Breckenridge. In 1861 they
        sold to Mr. White 300,000 pounds of wheat, 50,000 pounds of
        corn, 20,000 pounds of beans, and a large amount of dried
        and fresh pumpkins, which was all intended for the supply
        of the California column. The greater part of this crop was
        destroyed or given back to the Indians by the Texans under
        the guerrilla, Hunter, who arrived at the Pimo villages
        that year, robbed Mr. White of his property, and took him
        prisoner in their flight to the Rio Grande. The Pimos sold,
        during the same year, 600 chickens and a large amount of
        other stuff, showing a gradual increase of production under
        the encouragement of an increased demand. In 1862 they sold
        to the Government over a million pounds of wheat, included
        in which was a portion of the previous year's crop,
        returned to them by the Texans. They furnished pinole,
        chickens, green peas, green corn, pumpkins, and melons for
        the entire California column, subsisting nearly a thousand
        men for many months. In 1863 they furnished the Government
        with 600,000 pounds of wheat, and disposed of about 100,000
        pounds made into flour and sold to miners and traders.
        Their crop was smaller than usual, owing to the breakage of
        their main acequia at a critical period of the season, and
        in January, 1864, they were nearly out of wheat, but still
        had a good supply of other products.</p>

        <p>It will thus be seen that the Pimos are not a race to be
        despised. They have always proved themselves good warriors,
        and have been uniformly successful in resisting the
        incursions of the Apaches. Their villages have afforded the
        only protection ever given to American citizens in Arizona.
        If it were not for the Pimos and Maricopas it would now be
        impossible to travel from Fort Yuma to Tucson.</p><br />
