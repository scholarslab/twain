      <td>On that day we were first waited upon at table by
      soft-footed, white-robed, moon-faced Orientals. I find the
      Chinese very agreeable as waiters. They put on no superior
      Littimer airs, yet are so utterly removed from all interest
      in you and your affairs, beyond the business in hand, that,
      with half a dozen about you, you have a delightful sense of
      privacy, and should no more think of dismissing Chinese
      servants for better after-dinner freedom in conversation,
      than of sending away the tea-tray, lest its painted mandarins
      should listen and gossip. There is "no speculation" in their
      eyes. "The sleeping and the dead and the Chinese are but as
      pictures."<br />
