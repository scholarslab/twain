        <b>[From] Chapter XXXVII. Chinese vs Diggers.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>THE American is not the only race subject to trouble in
        the various operations of mining. Even the Celestials, who
        occupy the neglected nooks and corners of the mineral
        regions, have their share of adversity and disaster in the
        pursuit of wealth. Whenever they strike a good claim it
        belongs to some white man. He may never have seen or heard
        of it, or may have abandoned it and gone elsewhere; but if
        "John Clinaman" strikes it rich he comes back or sends his
        partner to take possession. The Digger Indians are learning
        the great lesson of civilization from their American
        benefactors. Driven from gulch to canon in their own
        country, they see that "Melican man" claims mines and
        minerals on general principles, and, like him, they despise
        an inferior race. They hate the Chinese because "Chinaman
        squaw; no kill Injun like Melican man!" They seem to look
        upon the Celestials as a base imitation of the Indian race,
        without the redeeming quality of bravery. Hence the Diggers
        are singularly bitter in their hostility to these miserable
        interlopers, and tax them without mercy, or kill them
        whenever they get a chance. One Indian chief and his band
        made several thousand dollars last summer by following np
        the Chinese and compelling them, by force of arms, to pay
        taxes for the privilege of working the mines. Poor John is
        taxed by the State, by the Government, by every white
        pilgrim who jogs along with pick and shovel, by his own
        people, and finally by the Digger Indians. Sometimes he
        rouses himself up to a spirit of resistance against the
        exorbitant claims of the latter, and then ensues a scene to
        which no pencil save that of Hogarth could do justice.</p>

        <p>The aboriginal tax-collectors come along
        stealthily--one, two, or three at a time, till ten or a
        dozen of them are gathered about the camp of the
        Celestials. Their arms consist of a bow and arrow, and a
        rude club or a spear; and their costume is seldom more than
        a deerskin, or a ragged old blanket, with the merest
        pretense of a cincture round the loins. A wretched
        tatterdemalion set they are--poor, thriftless, and dirty;
        in no respect like the warrior chiefs of Mr. Fenimore
        Cooper, or the braves of the Hon. Augustus Murray. Still
        there is fight in them if pushed to the bank. Their
        contempt for the Chinese is sublime. Having no knowledge of
        the Mongolian language, it becomes necessary that they
        should speak English, which is the available means of
        communication with the trespassers.</p>

        <p>"Say, John!" says the Digger Chief, "what you do
        here?"</p>

        <p>"Me workee. Who you?"</p>

        <p>"Me Piute Cappen. Me kill plenty Melican man. Dis my
        lan'. You payee me, John. No payee me, gottam, me killee
        you!"</p>

        <p>"No got--velly poor Chinaman; how muchee you want?"</p>

        <p>"Fifty dollar."</p>

        <p>"No got fifty dollar--velly poor. Melican man he catches
        Chinaman; he makes Chinaman pay; no got fifty dollar.
        Melican man--"</p>

        <p>" D--n Melican man! me no sabbe Melican man! Me Piute
        Cappen. S'pose you no payee me fifty dollar, me killee
        you!"</p>

        <p><a href=
        "javascript:Start('figures2/chibrowne01.jpg')"><img src=
          "figures2/chibrowne01t.jpg" hspace="8" alt="1868 ILLUSTRATION" /></a> Generally the
        money is paid, after many protests and various
        lamentations; but where the Digger force is small, and the
        Celestials numerous, the cry of battle is raised, and then
        comes the tug of war. When Greek meets Greek the spectacle
        may be very impressive; when Chinaman meets Digger it is
        absolutely gorgeous! Negotiation has been prolonged without
        issue; the English language has been exhausted; the fight
        is inevitable. From every hole in the earth the valiant
        Celestials rush forth, armed with picks and shovels, tin
        pans, platters, gongs, and kettles--every thing that can be
        made available for warlike purposes in the emergency of the
        moment. They beat their pans, blow their wind instruments,
        shriek, shout, laugh, make horrible faces, and perform the
        roost frightful antics, in the hope of striking terror into
        the racks of the foe. In every conceivable way they tax
        invention to make themselves hideous; poke their tongues
        out; double themselves up; hop on one leg; squat on the
        ground like frogs; rush furiously toward the enemy, and
        furiously retire. The hills and forests resound with their
        barbarous cries and the deafening clatter of their tin
        kettles and gongs. Meantime the Diggers are not idle.
        Adepts in the artifices of barbarian war, they are in no
        degree intimidated by the ferocious demonstrations of the
        enemy. A pistol or a shot-gun has its terrors, but they are
        up to the flimsy substitute of load noises and empty
        threats. While the foe is thus wasting his vital powers
        upon the air, Digger goes in with his clubs, spears, or
        bows and arrows. A few pricks of the barbed instruments
        generally ends the battle--save when the Celestial party
        can muster up an old shot-gun or a pistol, in which case
        they fight with heroic desperation, and sometimes come off
        victorious. But a pistol or gun in the hands of the enemy
        brings them to terms very speedily--and thus are they
        forced to pay the tax that breaks the camel's back. It
        ought to be a consolation to them to know that they do it
        for the benefit of civilization. Every dime they pay
        benefits some white whisky-dealer in Virginia City or
        Carson, or some other civilized place.</p>
