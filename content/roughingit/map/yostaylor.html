      Continent, trees are our truest antiquities, retaining (as I
      shall show) the heiroglyphics, not only of Nature, but of
      Man, during the past ages. The shadows of two thousand years
      sleep under the boughs of Montezuma's cypresses, at
      Chapultepec; the great tree of Oaxaca is a cotemporary of
      Solomon, and even the sculptured ruins of Copan, Palenque,
      and Uxmal are outnumbered in years by the rings of trunks in
      the forests which hide them. In California, the only human
      relics of an earlier date than her present Indian tribes, are
      those of a race anterior to the Deluge; but those giants of
      the Sierra Nevada have kept, for forty centuries, the annual
      record of their growth. As well think of going to Egypt
      without seeing the Pyramids, as of visiting California,
      without making a pilgrimage to her immemorial Trees!<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      The air perceptibly increased in coolness, clearness, and
      delicious purity. The trees now rose like colossal pillars,
      from four to eight feet in diameter, and two hundred feet in
      height, without a crook or a flaw of any kind. There was no
      undergrowth, but the dry soil was hidden under a bed of
      short, golden fern, which blazed like fire where the sunshine
      struck it. We seemed to be traversing some vast columned
      hall, like that of Karnak, or the Thousand Columns at
      Constantinople--except that human art never raised such
      matchless pillars. Our necks ached from the vertical travels
      of our eyes, in order to reach their tops. Really, the
      Western hyperbole of tall trees seemed true, that it takes
      two men to see them--one beginning where the other leaves
      off.<br />
      <br />
      Our progress, from the ascent, and the deep dust which
      concealed the ruts, was slow, and would have been tedious,
      but for the inspiring majesty of the forest. But when four
      hours had passed, and the sun was near his setting, we began
      to look out impatiently for some sign of the Trees. The pines
      and arbor-vitae had become so large, that it seemed as if
      nothing <i>could</i> be larger. As some great red shaft
      loomed duskily through the shadows, one and then another of
      us would exclaim: "There's one!"--only to convince ourselves
      as we came nearer, that it was not. Yet, if such were the
      courtiers, what must the monarchs be? We shall certainly be
      disappointed: nothing can fulfil this promise. A thick
      underwood now appeared, radiant with the loveliest autumnal
      tints. The sprays of pink, purple, crimson, and pure gold
      flashed like sprinkles of colored fire amid the dark-green
      shadows. "Let us not ask for more," said I; "nothing can be
      more beautiful."<br />
      <br />
      Suddenly, in front of us, where the gloom was deepest, I saw
      a huge <i>something</i> behind the other trees, like the
      magnified shadow of one of them, thrown upon a dark-red
      cloud. While I was straining my eyes, in questioning wonder,
      the road made a sharp curve. Glancing forward, I beheld two
      great circular--shot towers? Not <i>trees</i>, surely!--but
      yes, by all the Dryads, those are trees! Ay, open your mouth,
      my good driver, as if your two eyes were not sufficient,
      while we sit dumb behind you! What can one say? What think,
      except to doubt his senses? One sentence, only, comes to your
      mind--"there were giants in those days."<br />
      <br />
      Between these two colossi, called The Sentinels, ran our
      road. In front, a hundred yards further, stood the pleasant
      white hotel, beside something dark, of nearly the same size.
      This something is only a piece of the trunk of another tree,
      which has been felled, leaving its stump as the floor of a
      circular ball-room, twenty-seven feet in diameter.
      Dismounting at the door, we were kindly received by the
      Doctor, and assured of good quarters for the night. The sun
      was just setting, and we were advised to defer the inspection
      of the grove until morning. Seating ourselves in the veranda,
      therefore, we proceded to study The Sentinels, whose tops,
      <i>three hundred feet</i> in the air, were glowing in golden
      luster, while the last beam had passed away from the forest
      below them.<br />
      <br />
      To my astonishment, they did not appear so very large, after
      all! Large they were, certainly, but nothing remarkable. At
      first, I was puzzled by this phenomenon, but presently
      remembered that the slender saplings (apparently) behind
      them, were in themselves enormous trees. In dwarfing
      everything around them, they had also dwarfed themselves.
      Like St. Peter's, the Pyramids, and everything else which is
      at once colossal and symmetrical, the eye requires time to
      comprehend their dimensions. By repeatedly walking to them,
      pacing round their tremendous bases, examining the
      neighboring trees, and measuring their height by the same
      comparison, I succeeded in gradually increasing the
      impression. When the last gleam of twilight had gone, and the
      full moon mounted above the forest, they grew in grandeur and
      awful height, until the stars seemed to twinkle as dew-drops
      on their topmost boughs. Then, indeed, they became older than
      the Pyramids, more venerable than the triune idol of
      Elephanta, and the secrets of an irrecoverable Past were
      breathed in the dull murmurs forced from them by the winds of
      night.<br />
      <br />
      "Thank God that I have lived to see these works of His hand!"
      was the exclamation with which I turned away, reluctantly
      driven in-doors by the keen, frosty air. . . .<br />
