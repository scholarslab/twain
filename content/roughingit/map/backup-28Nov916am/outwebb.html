<b>[From] Chapter V.</b><br><br>

<p> &nbsp;  Among the persons present in the crowded office 
of the hotel, was a man from the southwestern part of the state 
who had lately been interested in a trial before the celebrated Judge 
Lynch.  Sachem interviewed him, and reports his statement of the 
occurrence in the log book, as follows:</p>

<table align="center" width=450 border=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td>
A stranger played me fur a fool,<br>
 &nbsp; An' threw the high, low, jack,<br>
An' sold me the wuss piece of mule<br>
 &nbsp; That ever humped a back.<br>
<br>
But that wer fair; I don't complain,<br>
 &nbsp; That I got beat in trade;<br>
I don't sour on a fellow's gain,<br>
 &nbsp; When sich is honest made.<br>
<br>
But wust wer this, he stole the mule,<br>
 &nbsp; An' I were bilked complete;<br>
Such thieves, we hossmen makes a rule<br>
 &nbsp; To  lift 'em from their feet.<br>
<br>
We started arter that 'ere pup,<br>
 &nbsp; An' took the judge along,<br> For fear, with all our dander up,<br>
 &nbsp; We might do somethin' wrong.<br>
<br> We caught him under twenty miles,<br>
 &nbsp; An tried him under trees;<br>
The judge he passed around the "smiles,"<br>
 &nbsp; As sort o' jury fees.<br>
<br>
"Pris'ner," says judge, "now say your say,<br>
 &nbsp; An' make it short an' sweet,<br>
An', while yer at it, kneel and pray,<br>
 &nbsp; For Death yer can not cheat.<br>
<br>
No man shall hang, by this 'ere court,<br>
 &nbsp; Exceptin' on the square;<br>
There's time fur speech, if so it's short,<br>
 &nbsp; But none to chew or swear."<br>
<br>
An' then the thievin' rascal cursed,<br>
 &nbsp; An' threw his life away,<br>
He said, "Just pony out your wurst,<br>
 &nbsp; Your best would be foul play."<br>
<br>
Then judge he frowned an awful frown,<br>
 &nbsp; An' snapped this sentence short,<br>
"Jones, twitch the rope, an' write this down,<br>
 &nbsp;  Hung for contempt of court!"<br>
