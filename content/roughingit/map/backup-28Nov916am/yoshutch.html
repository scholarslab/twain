<center><font size=+1><b>From Chapter I</b></font></center><br>

I<font size=-1>T</font> is much to be questioned if the discovery of any wonder, in any part of the world, has ever elicited as much general interest, or created so strong a tax upon the credulity of mankind, as the discovery of the mammouth trees of California.  Indeed, those who first mentioned the fact of their existence, whether by word of mouth or by letter, were looked upon as near, very near, relatives of Baron Munchausen, Captain Gulliver, or the celebrated Don Quixote.  The statement had many times to be repeated, and well corroborated, before it could be received as true; and there are many persons who, to this very day, look upon it as a somewhat doubtful "California story;" such, we never expect to convince of the realities we are about to illustrate and describe, although we do so from our personal knowledge and observation.<br><br><br>


<center><font size=+1><b>From Chapter IV</b></font></center><br>

T<font size=-1>HE</font> reader knows as well as we do, that, although it may be of but little consequence in point of fact, whether a spirit or romance, the love and the grand and beautiful in scenery, the suggestions or promptings of a fascinating woman--be she friend, sweet-heart, or wife--the desire for change, the want of recreation, or the necessity of a restoration and recuperation of an overtasked physical or mental organization, or both--whatever may be the agent that first gives birth to the wish for, or the love of travel; whenever the mind is thoroughly made up, and the committee of ways and means reports itself financially prepared to undertake the pleasurable task--in order to enjoy it with luxurious zest, we must resolve upon four things: <i>first</i>, to leave the "peck of troubles," and a few thrown in, entirely behind;  <i>second</i>, to have none but good, suitable, and genial-hearted companions; <i>third</i>, a sufficient supply of personal patience, good humor, forbearance, and creature comforts for all emergencies; and, <i>fourth</i>, not to be in a hurry.  To these, both one and all, who have ever visited the Yo-Semite Valley, we know will say--Amen.<br><br>

. . . Whether one sits with religious veneration at the foot of Mount Shasta, or cools himself in the refreshing shade of the natural caves and bridges, or walks beneath the giant shadows of the mammouth trees, or stands in awe looking upon the frowning and pine-covered heights of the Yo-Semite Valley, he feels that<br>
<center>"A thing of beauty is a joy forever,"</center>
and that the Californian's home will compare, in picturesque magnificence, with that of any other land.<br><br>

In later years, other employments and enjoyments have been entertained as worthy the attention of the residents and visitors of this coast, than money-making.  Now, there are many who throng the highway of elevating and refining pleasure, in spring and summer, to feast the eye and mind upon the beautiful.  In the hope, though humbly, of fostering this feeling, we continue our sketches of the most remarkable and interesting, among which doubtless stands the great Yo-Semite Valley.<br><br>
