The cars now (1867) run nearly to the summit of the Sierras.  At the time of my visit the terminus was Colfax, fifty-five miles east of Sacramento.  Thence we took horses for twelve miles.  Upon this little section of road four thousand laborers were at work -- one-tenth Irish, the rest Chinese.  They were a great army laying seige to Nature in her strongest citadel.  The rugged mountains looked like stupendous ant-hills.  They swarmed with Celestials, shoveling, wheeling, carting, drilling and blasting rocks and earth, while their dull moony eyes stared out from under immense basket-hats, like umbrellas.  At several dining-camps we saw hundreds sitting on the ground, eating soft boiled rice with chopsticks as fast as terrestrials could with soup-ladles.  Irish laborers received thirty dollars per month (gold) and board; Chinese, thirty-one dollars, boarding themselves.  After a little experience the latter were quite as efficient and far less troublesome.</p>
