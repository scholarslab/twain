<blockquote><font size=+1><b>*</b></font> &nbsp; As early as A.D. 1772 (Description of the Province of Carolana,etc., etc., by
Daniel Cox) it was suggested that there was a line of water communication by
means of the "northern branch of the Great Yellow River, by the natives called the
River of the Massorites" (Missouri River), and a branch of the Columbia River,
which, however, was erroneously supposed to disembogue through the Great Salt
Lake into the Pacific.  The idea has been revived in the present day.  Some assert
that the upper waters of the Yellow Stone, which approach within three hundred
miles of the Great Salt Lake City, are three feet deep, and therefore navigable for
flatbottomed boats during the annual inundation.  Other believe that, as in the case
of the Platte, shallowness would be an insuperable obstacle, except for one or two
months.  This point will doubtless be settled by Captain W. F. Raynolds, of the
United States Topographical Engineers, who, accompanied by Colonel J. Bridger,
was, at the time of my visit to Great Salt Lake City, exploring the Valley of the
Yellow Stone.</blockquote>
