It was a wild, free, disorderly, grotesque
society!  <i>Men</i>--only
swarming hosts of stalwart <i>men</i>--nothing
juvenile, nothing feminine, visible anywhere!<br>
<br>
In those days miners would flock in crowds to catch a glimpse
of that rare and blessed spectacle, a woman!  Old inhabitants tell
how, in a certain camp, the news went abroad early in the morning
that a woman was come!  They had seen a calico dress hanging out
of a wagon down at the camping-ground--sign of emigrants from
over the great plains.  Everybody went down there, and a shout
went up when an
actual, bona fide dress was discovered fluttering in the wind!  The
male emigrant was visible.  The miners said:<br>
<br>
"Fetch her out!"<br>
<br>
He said: "It is my wife, gentlemen--she is sick--we have been
robbed of money, provisions, everything, by the Indians--we want
to rest."<br>
<br>
<br>"Fetch her out!  We've got to see her!"<br>
<br>"But, gentlemen, the poor thing, she--"<br>
<br>"F<font size=-1>ETCH HER OUT</font>!"<br>
<br>He "fetched her out," and they swung their hats and sent up
three rousing cheers and a tiger; and they crowded around and
gazed at her, and touched her dress, and listened to her voice with
the look of men who listened to
a <i>memory</i> rather than a present
reality--and then they collected twenty-five
hundred dollars in gold and gave it to the man, and swung their
hats again and gave three more cheers, and went home
satisfied.<br>
<br>
Once I dined in San Francisco with the family of a pioneer,
and talked with his daughter, a young lady whose first experience
in San Francisco was an adventure, though she herself did not
remember it, as she was only two or three years old at the time.
Her father said that, after landing from the ship, they were walking
up the street, a servant leading the party with the little girl in her
arms.  And presently
a huge miner, bearded, belted, spurred, and bristling with deadly
weapons--just down from a long campaign in the mountains,
evidently-barred the way, stopped the servant, and stood gazing,
with a face all alive with gratification and astonishment.  Then he
said, reverently:<br>
<center><a href="javascript:Start1('riwomen2.html')"><img src="riwomen2t.gif" alt="A Child!" vspace=12></a></center>
"Well, if it ain't a child!"  And then he snatched a little leather
sack out of his pocket and said to the servant:<br>
<br>"There's a hundred and fifty dollars in dust, there, and I'll give
it to you to let me kiss the child!"<br>
<br>That anecdote is <i>true</i>.<br>
<br>But see how things change.  Sitting at that dinner-table,
listening to that anecdote, if I had offered double the money for the
privilege of kissing the same child, I would have been refused.
Seventeen added years have far more than doubled the price.<br>
<br>And while upon this subject I will remark that once in Star
City, in the Humboldt Mountains, I took my place in a sort of long,
post-office single file of miners, to patiently await my chance to
peep through a crack in the cabin and get a sight of the splendid
new sensation--a genuine, live Woman!  And at the end of half of
an hour my turn came, and I put my eye to the crack, and there she
was, with one arm akimbo, and tossing flap-jacks in a frying-pan
with the other.
And she was one hundred and sixty-five<font size=+1><b><a href="javascript:Start3('richap57note.html')">*</a></b></font>
 years old, and hadn't a tooth in her head.<br>
