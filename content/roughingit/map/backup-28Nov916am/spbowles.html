<P>...we enter upon the night ride through Bridger's Pass,
from the Atlantic to the Pacific slopes of the Rocky
Mountains.  You need to be told what you are doing.
There is no slow hill-climbing; the horses
trot the stage along; and the soldier escort gallop
behind.  Not through valleys still, but apparently
along and up the beds of departed rivers, with
mountain walls on either hand,--sometimes ten or
twenty miles wide, and again narrowing to rods,
but oftenest miles in width; on one side bare,
perpendicular walls of rock, thrown into all imaginable
and unscientific combinations of the original or
sub-original formations, and since carved and fluted
by wind and sand and rain into all and every shape
that architecture ever created, or imagination fancied;
on the other, rounded hill-side with scant verdure and
occasional stunted tree and frequent
snow-bank.  Not in one continuous bed or valley,
was our upward course, but a succession of such,
leading one into another.</P>

<P>So we rode on through the clear twilight, that
lingers till nine and ten o'clock in this region, into
the rich moonlight that only gave new form and
beauty to the rocks; and out into the morning dawn
that hastens on at two to three; watching the water
to see which way it ran, and building Pacific
Railroads along these easy grades back to home and
forward to fame and fortune.  I was in the saddle,
galloping with the captain of the escort; but the
earlier and more enthusiastic lieutenant-governor of
Illinois, who kept guard with the driver on the box,
shouted out the passage over the line--it was no more
than a "thank-ye-marm" in a New England's
winter sleigh-ride, yet it separates the various and
vast waters of a Continent, and marks the fountains
of the two great oceans of the globe.  But it was
difficult to be long enthusiastic over this infinitesimal
point of mud; the night was very cold, and I
was sore in unpoetical parts from unaccustomed
saddles, and I got down from all my high horses,
and into my corner of the stage, at the next station. [pages 74-75]</P>
