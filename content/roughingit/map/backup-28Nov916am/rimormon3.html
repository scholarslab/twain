<p>Next day we strolled about everywhere through the broad,
straight, level streets, and enjoyed the pleasant strangeness of a
city of fifteen thousand inhabitants with no loafers perceptible in
it; and no visible drunkards or noisy people; a limpid stream
rippling and dancing through every street in place of a filthy
gutter; block after block of trim dwellings, built of "frame" and
sunburned brick--a great thriving orchard and garden behind every
one of them, apparently--branches from the street stream winding
and sparkling among the garden beds and fruit trees--and a grand
general air of neatness, repair, thrift and comfort, around and
about and over the whole.
And everywhere were workshops, factories, and all manner of
industries; and intent faces and busy hands were to be seen
wherever one looked; and in one's ears was the ceaseless clink of
hammers, the buzz of trade and the contented hum of drums and
fly-wheels.</p>

<p>The armorial crest of my own State consisted of two dissolute
bears holding up the head of a dead and gone cask between them
and making the pertinent remark, "U<font size=-1>NITED</font>, W<font size=-1>E</font>
S<font size=-1>TAND</font>--(hic!)--D<font size=-1>IVIDED</font>, W<font size=-1>E</font> F<font size=-1>ALL</font>."  It was always too
figurative for the author of this book.  But the Mormon crest was
easy.  And it was simple, unostentatious, and fitted like a glove.  It
was a representation of a G<font size=-1>OLDEN</font> B<font size=-1>EEHIVE</font>, with the bees all at
work!</p>
<p>The city lies in the edge of a level plain as broad as the State
of Connecticut, and crouches close down to the ground under a
curving wall of mighty mountains whose heads are hidden in the
clouds, and whose shoulders bear relics of the snows of winter all
the summer long.
Seen from one of these dizzy heights, twelve or fifteen miles off,
Great Salt Lake City is toned down and diminished till it is
suggestive of a child's toy-village reposing under the majestic
protection of the Chinese wall.</p>
<p>On some of those mountains, to the southwest, it had been
raining every day for two weeks, but not a drop had fallen in the
city.  And on hot days in late spring and early autumn the citizens
could quit fanning and growling and go out and cool off by looking
at the luxury of a glorious snow-storm going on in the mountains.
They could enjoy it at a distance, at those seasons, every day,
though no snow would fall in their streets, or anywhere near
them.</p>

<p>Salt Lake City was healthy--an extremely healthy city.
They declared there was only one physician in the place and he
was arrested every week regularly and held to answer under the
vagrant act for having "no visible means of support."  They always
give you a good substantial article of truth in
Salt Lake, and good measure and good weight, too.  Very often, if
you wished to weigh one of their airiest little commonplace
statements you would want the hay scales.]</p>
<p>We desired to visit the famous inland sea, the American "Dead
Sea," the great Salt Lake--seventeen miles, horseback, from the
city--for we had dreamed about it, and thought about it, and talked
about it, and yearned to see it, all the first part of our trip; but now
when it was only arm's length away it had suddenly lost nearly
every bit of its interest.  And so we put it off, in a sort of general
way, till next day--and that was the last we ever thought of it.  We
dined with some hospitable Gentiles; and visited the foundation of
the prodigious temple; and talked long with that shrewd
Connecticut Yankee, Heber C. Kimball (since deceased), a saint of
high degree and a mighty man of commerce. We saw the "Tithing-House," and the "Lion House," and I do not
know or remember how many more church and government
buildings of various kinds and curious names.  We flitted hither
and thither and enjoyed every hour, and picked up a great deal of
useful information and entertaining nonsense, and went to bed at
night satisfied.</p>

<p>The second day, we made the acquaintance of Mr. Street
(since deceased) and put on white shirts and went and paid a state
visit to the king.  He seemed a quiet, kindly, easy-mannered,
dignified, self-possessed old gentleman of fifty-five or sixty, and
had a gentle craft in his eye that probably belonged there.  He was
very simply dressed and was just taking off a straw hat as we
entered.  He talked about Utah, and the Indians, and Nevada, and
general American matters and questions, with our secretary and
certain government officials who came with us.  But he never paid
any attention to me, notwithstanding I made several attempts to
"draw him out" on
federal politics and his high handed attitude toward Congress.  I
thought some of the things I said were rather fine.  But he merely
looked around at me, at distant intervals, something as I have seen
a benignant old cat look around to see which kitten was meddling
with her tail.
By and by I subsided into an indignant silence, and so sat until the
end, hot and flushed, and execrating him in my heart for an
ignorant savage.  But he was calm.  His conversation with those
gentlemen flowed on as sweetly and peacefully and musically as
any summer brook.  When the audience was ended and we were
retiring from the presence, he put his hand on my head, beamed
down on me in an admiring way and said to my brother:</p>
<p>"Ah--your child, I presume?  Boy, or girl?"</p>
