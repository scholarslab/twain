<p>The States and Territories on the line of the Union and Central Pacific Railroad -- or immediately tributary to it -- contained a population in 1860 of only 554,301, with 132 miles of telegraph line and 32 miles of railway.  This same scope of country contained a population, according to the census of 1870, of 1,011,971, and it is now encompassed by over 13,000 miles of telegraph lines and 4,192 miles of railroads <i>completed</i>, and many more in progress, in which are invested the enormous capital of <i>Three Hundred and Sixty-three Millions Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars</i>.  Should we add to the above the immense amount of capital invested -- within the same ten years -- in quartz mills, smelting furnaces, development of mines, and other resources of the country, the grand total would be truly astonishing.</p>
<p>We have the official figures, exhibiting the improvements within an area of two miles of each town on the line of the Union Pacific Railroad -- furnished us by J. M. Eddy, Esq., of the Town Lot Department -- which show that $1,798,810 has been expended for buildings and 1,293 new ones have been erected.  With this large expenditure for buildings <i>alone</i>, what must be the amount for agricultural and other purposes?</p>
<p>Where, but a few years ago, the buffalo and other game roamed in countless thousands, and the savages skulked in the canyons and secret hiding-places where they could pounce out <i>unawares</i> upon the emigrant -- the hardy pioneer who has made the wilderness, <i>if not</i> "to blossom like the rose," a <i>safe</i> pathway for the present generation, by laying down their lives in the cause of advancing civilization -- <i>now</i> are to be seen hundreds of thousands of hardy emigrants, with their horses, cattle, sheep, and domestic animals, and the savages are among the things that have "moved on."</p>
