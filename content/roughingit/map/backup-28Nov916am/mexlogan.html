Ferguson now takes the place of the stage-driver and becomes the Avenger.  The reader will scarcely ask me who Ferguson the Avenger is.  He is the guide.  All guides are Fergusons since the Innocents went Abroad, and The Only Twain returned to chronicle their Pilgrimage.  Boniface is a landlord, Jehu is a hack-driver, Ferguson is a guide.  So be it.<br>
<br>
Ferguson is a Mexican born in California, and as graceful and as handsome as a picture.  No mistake about this.  He'd be a fortune for a painter, with his tawny, smooth skin tingling with red on the cheeks, his scarlet lips, his white teeth, his profusion of blackest hair.  His other name is Manuel, and he has never been away from these mountains.  He has never seen a steamboat, nor a railroad, nor a city.  He wants to do so very much.  So do we all just at that minute.<br>
