My idea, when I began this chapter, was to say something 
about desperadoism in the "flush times" of Nevada.  To attempt a 
portrayal of that era and that land, and leave out the blood and 
carnage, would be like portraying Mormondom and leaving out 
polygamy.  The desperado stalked the streets with a swagger 
graded according to the number of his homicides, and a nod of 
recognition from him was sufficient to make a humble admirer 
happy for the rest of the day.  The deference that was paid to a 
desperado of wide reputation, and who "kept his private 
graveyard," as the phrase went, was marked, and cheerfully 
accorded.  When he moved along the sidewalk in his excessively 
long-tailed frock-coat, shiny stump-toed boots, and with dainty 
little slouch hat 
tipped over left eye, the small-fry roughs made room for his 
majesty; when he entered the restaurant, the waiters deserted 
bankers and merchants to overwhelm him with obsequious service; 
when he shouldered his way to a bar, the shouldered parties 
wheeled indignantly, recognized him, and--apologized.  
They got a look in return that froze their marrow, and by that time 
a curled and breast-pinned bar keeper was beaming over the 
counter, proud of the established acquaintanceship that permitted 
such a familiar form of speech as:<br> 
<br>
"How're ye, Billy, old fel?  Glad to see you.  What'll you 
take--the old thing?"<br> 
<br>
The "old thing" meant his customary drink, of course.<br> 
<br>
The best known names in the Territory of Nevada were those 
belonging to these long-tailed heroes of the revolver.  Orators, 
Governors, capitalists and leaders of the legislature enjoyed a 
degree of fame, but it seemed local and meagre when contrasted 
with the fame of such men as Sam Brown, Jack Williams, Billy 
Mulligan, Farmer Pease, Sugarfoot Mike, Pock Marked Jake, El 
Dorado Johnny, Jack McNabb, Joe McGee, Jack Harris, 
Six-fingered Pete, etc., etc.  There was a long list of them.  They 
were brave, reckless men, and traveled with their lives in their 
hands.  To give them their due, they did their killing principally 
among themselves, and 
seldom molested peaceable citizens, for they considered it small 
credit to add to their trophies so cheap a bauble as the death of a 
man who was "not on the shoot," as they phrased it.  They killed 
each other on slight provocation, and hoped and expected to be 
killed themselves--for they held it almost shame to die otherwise 
than "with their boots on," as they expressed it.
