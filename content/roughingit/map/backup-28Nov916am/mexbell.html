<b>[From] Chapter VII.  The Valley of the Purgatoire.</b><br><br>

<p> &nbsp; It was impossible for a passing visitor to tell how the Americans and Mexicans [in Trinidad] managed to get on together. There appeared to be every prospect of peace at the time I was there, but before the autumn had far advanced, a very different state of things seems to have arisen.  As far as I could make out from the reports which reached me at San Francisco, one of the Americans had shot a very popular man amongst the Mexicans in a midnight brawl, and as the friends of the former refused to give him up, the Mexicans united in a body of five hundred strong, and attacked the place. The Americans were so greatly in the minority, that they were obliged to take refuge in their houses, and sustain a siege for nearly a fortnight, during which time some seven Mexicans were shot by the defenders.  As military assistance did not
arrive, and provisions at last began to fail, the Anglo-Saxons had to surrender, but under what conditions I could not discover. When the soldiers at last arrived, the war was over, and the little population had returned in peace to their former occupations.</p>
