<p>B<font size=-1>Y</font> and by I was smitten with the silver fever.  "Prospecting
parties" were leaving for the mountains every day, and discovering
and taking possesion of rich silver-bearing lodes and ledges of
quartz.  Plainly this was the road to fortune.  The great "Gould and
Curry" mine was held at three or four hundred dollars a foot when
we arrived; but in two months it had sprung up to eight hundred.
The "Ophir" had been worth only a mere trifle, a year gone by, and
now it was selling at nearly
<i>four thousand dollars a foot</i>!
Not a mine could be named that had not experienced an
astonishing advance in value within a short time.  Everybody was
talking about these marvels.  Go where you would, you heard
nothing else, from morning till far into the night.  Tom So-and-So
had sold out of the 'Amanda Smith" for $40,000--hadn't a cent
when he "took up" the ledge six months ago.  John Jones had sold
half his interest in the "Bald Eagle and Mary Ann" for $65,000,
gold coin, and gone to the States for his family.  The widow
Brewster had "struck it rich" in the "Golden Fleece" and sold ten
feet for $18,000--hadn't money enough to buy a crape bonnet when
Sing-Sing Tommy killed her husband at Baldy Johnson's wake last
spring.  The "Last Chance" had found a "clay casing" and knew
they were "right on the ledge"--consequence, "feet" that went
begging yesterday were worth a brick house apiece to-day, and
seedy owners who could not get trusted for a drink at any bar in
the country yesterday were roaring drunk on champagne to-day
and had hosts of warm personal friends in a town where they had
forgotten how to bow or shake hands from long-continued want of
practice.  Johnny Morgan, a common loafer, had gone to sleep in
the gutter and waked up worth a hundred thousand dollars, in
consequence of the decision in the "Lady Franklin and Rough and
Ready" lawsuit.  And so on--day in and day out the talk pelted our
ears and the excitement waxed hotter and hotter around us.</p>

I would have been more or less than human if I had not gone
mad like the rest.  Cart-loads of solid silver bricks, as large as pigs
of lead, were arriving from the mills every day, and such sights as
that gave substance to the wild talk about me.  I succumbed and
grew as frenzied as the craziest.</p>
