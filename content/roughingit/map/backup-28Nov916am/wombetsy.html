Oh don't you remember sweet Betsy from Pike,<br>
Who crossed the wide prairie with her lover Ike,<br>
With two yoke of oxen, a big yellow dog,<br>
A tall Shangai rooster, and one spotted hog?<br>
<br>
<font size=-1><b>CHORUS:</b></font><br>
Singing dang fol dee dido,<br>
Singing dang fol dee day.<br><br>

One evening quite early they camped on the Platte.<br>
'Twas near by the road on a green shady flat.<br>
Where Betsy, sore-footed, lay down to repose --<br>
With wonder Ike gazed on that Pike County rose.<br>
<br>

The Shanghai ran off, and their cattle all died;<br>
That morning the last piece of bacon was fried;<br>
Poor Ike was discouraged and Betsy got mad,<br>
The dog drooped his tail and looked wondrously sad.<br>
<br>

They stopped at Salt Lake to inquire of the way,<br>
Where Brigham declared that sweet Betsy should stay;<br>
But Betsy got frightened and ran like a deer<br>
While Brigham stood pawing the ground like a steer.<br>
<br>

They soon reached the desert where Betsy gave out,<br>
And down in the sand she lay rolling about;<br>
While Ike, half distracted, looked on with surprise,<br>
Saying, "Betsy, get up, you'll get sand in your eyes."<br>
<br>

Sweet Betsy got up in a great deal of pain,<br>
Declared she'd go back to Pike County again;<br>
But Ike gave a sigh and they fondly embraced,<br>
And they traveled along with his arm round her waist.<br>
<br>

The Injuns came down in a wild yelling horde,<br>
And Betsy was scared they would scalp her adored;<br>
Behind the front wagon wheel Betsy did crawl,<br>
And there fought the Injuns with musket and ball.<br>
<br>

They suddenly stopped on a very high hill,<br>
With wonder looked down upon old Placerville;<br>
Ike sighed when he said, and he cast his eyes down,<br>
"Sweet Betsy, my darling, we've got to Hangtown."<br>
<br>

Long Ike and Sweet Betsy attended a dance;<br>
Ike wore a pair of his Pike County pants;<br>
Sweet Betsy was dressed up in ribbons and rings;<br>
Says Ike, "You're an angel, but where are your wings?"<br>
<br>

'Twas out on the prairie one bright starry night,<br>
They broke out the whiskey and Betsy got tight,<br>
She sang and she howled and she danced o'er the plain,<br>
And showed her bare legs to the whole wagon train.<br>
<br>

The terrible desert was burning and bare,<br>
And Isaac he shrank from the death lurkin' there,<br>
"Dear old Pike County, I'll come back to you."<br>
Says Betsy, "You'll go by yourself if you do."<br>
<br>

They swam wild rivers and climbed the tall peaks,<br>
And camped on the prairies for weeks upon weeks,<br>
Starvation and cholera, hard work and slaughter,<br>
They reached Californy, spite of hell and high water.<br>
<br>

A miner said, "Betsy, will you dance with me?"<br>
"I will, you old hoss, if you don't make too free.<br>
But don't dance me hard, do you want to know why?<br>
Doggone ye, I'm chock full of strong alkali."<br>
<br>

Long Ike and Sweet Betsy got married, of course,<br>
But Ike, getting jealous, obtained a divorce,<br>
While Betsy, well satisfied, said with a shout,<br>
"Goodbye, you big lummox, I'm glad you backed out!"<br>
