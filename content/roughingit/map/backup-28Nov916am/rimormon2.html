<center>CHAPTER XIII.</center> 
<p>W<font size=-1>E</font> had a fine supper, of the freshest meats and fowls and 
vegetables--a great variety and as great abundance.  We walked 
about the streets some, afterward, and glanced in at shops and 
stores; and there was fascination in surreptitiously staring at every 
creature we took to be a Mormon.  This was fairy-land to us, to all 
intents and purposes--a land of enchantment, and goblins, and 
awful mystery.  We felt a curiosity to ask every child how many 
mothers it had, and if it could tell them apart; and we experienced 
a thrill every time a dwelling-house door opened and shut as we 
passed, disclosing a glimpse of human heads and backs and 
shoulders--for we so longed to have a good satisfying look at a 
Mormon family in all its comprehensive ampleness, disposed in 
the customary concentric rings of its home circle.</p> 
<p>By and by the Acting Governor of the Territory introduced us 
to other "Gentiles," and we spent a sociable hour with them.  
"Gentiles" are people who are not Mormons.  Our 
fellow-passenger, Bemis, took care of himself, during this part of 
the evening, and did not make an overpowering success of it, 
either, for he came into our room in the hotel about eleven o'clock, 
full of cheerfulness, and talking loosely, disjointedly and 
indiscriminately, and every now and then tugging out a ragged 
word by the roots that had more hiccups than syllables in it.  This, 
together with his hanging his coat on the floor on one side of a 
chair, and his vest on the floor on the other side, and piling his 
pants on the floor just in  
front of the same chair, and then comtemplating the general result 
with superstitious awe, and finally pronouncing it "too many for 
<hi rend="italics">him</hi>" and going to bed with his boots on,  
led us to fear that something 
he had eaten had not agreed with him.</p>

<p>But we knew afterward that it was something he had been 
drinking.  It was the exclusively Mormon refresher, "valley tan." 
Valley tan (or, at least, one form of valley tan) is a kind of whisky, 
or first cousin to it; is of Mormon invention and manufactured 
only in Utah.  Tradition says it is made of (imported) fire and 
brimstone.  If I remember rightly no public drinking saloons were 
allowed in the kingdom by Brigham Young, and no private 
drinking permitted among the faithful, except they confined 
themselves to "valley tan."</p>
