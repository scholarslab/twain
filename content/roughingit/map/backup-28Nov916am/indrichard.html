Near a little road-side grocery, supported by a post and flanked by an empty cask, stood a Noble Red Man.  Indifferent to his tattered clothing, which afforded no protection from the sharp, wintry nights -- with his long black locks flying in the wind -- his whole soul was wrapped in a whisky bottle.  He regarded it with a fixed stare, in which satisfaction at the quality of its contents and pensive regret at their diminishing quantity were ludicrously blended.  Mr. Cooper died too early.  I think one glimpse at <i>this</i> Aboriginal would have saved his pen much labor, and early American literature many Indian heroes.
