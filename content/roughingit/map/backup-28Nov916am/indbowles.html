<CENTER><B>THE INDIAN QUESTION</B></CENTER>
<P>The government is ready to assist in their
support, to grant them reservations, to give them
food and make them presents; but it must and
will, with sharp hand, enforce their respect to travel,
their respect to lives and property, and their respect
to trade throughout all this region.</P>

<P>And if this cannot be secured, short of their utter
extermination, why extermination it must be.  Else,
we may as well abandon this whole region; give up
its settlement, its subjugation to civilization, its
development to wealth and Christianity.  It is the
old eternal contest between barbarism and civilization,
between things as they have been and are, and
material and moral progress; and barbarism and
barbarity must go to the wall, somewhat too roughly
perhaps, as is always the case with new, earnest,
material communities, but yet certainly.  The Mormons
have exhausted the Quaker policy towards
the Indians; have fed and clothed them for years,
paying them in all ways heavy subsidies, in consideration
of being let alone; but they are growing
tired of it, both because it is expensive, and is not
sure of success.  Only a few days ago, some Indians
attacked the Mormons at a settlement about
eighty miles south of here, and killed eighteen or
twenty persons.  Brigham Young and other officials
of Church and State went down to investigate
the matter and restore peace; they have just come
back, reporting success, and laying part of the
blame on the whites, but still with less of the old
disposition to subsidize the barbarians.</P>

<P>Montana is disturbed with reports of Indian outrages;
this whole region of mountains and plains
is sensitive and suffering with the apprehensions or
the realities of their general recurrence; commerce
suffers; prices go up; emigration stops; and all
the development of the great West is clogged.  No
wonder is it, then, that the entire white population
of the Territories clamors for positive measures of
restraint and punishment.  The red man of reality
is not the red man of poetry, romance, or philanthropy.
He is false and barbaric, cunning and cowardly, attacking
only when all advantage is with
him, horrible in cruelty, the terror of women and
children, impenetrable to nearly every motive but
fear, impossible to regenerate and civilize.  The
whites may often be unjust and cruel in turn; but
the balance is far against the Indian; and the
country must sustain the government and General
Connor in pursuing a vigorous offensive and defensive
policy towards him. [pages 69-70]</P>
