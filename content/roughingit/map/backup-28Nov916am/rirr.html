<p>Now that was stage-coaching on the great overland, ten or
twelve years ago, when perhaps not more than ten men in
America, all told, expected to live to see a railroad follow that
route to the Pacific.  But the railroad is there, now, and it pictures
a thousand odd comparisons and contrasts in my mind to read the
following sketch, in the New York <i>Times</i>,
of a recent trip over almost the very ground I have been
describing.  I can scarcely comprehend the new state of
things:</p>

<center><b>"ACROSS THE CONTINENT.</b></center>
<blockquote>At 4.20 P.M., Sunday, we rolled out of the station at Omaha,
and started westward on our long jaunt.  A couple of hours out,
dinner was announced--an "event" to those of us who had yet to
experience what it is to eat in one of Pullman's hotels on wheels;
so, stepping into the car next forward of our sleeping palace, we
found ourselves in the dining-car.  It was a revelation to us, that
first dinner on Sunday.  And though we continued to dine for four
days, and had as many breakfasts and suppers, our whole party
never ceased to admire the perfection of the arrangements, and the
marvelous results achieved.  Upon tables covered with snowy
linen, and garnished with services of solid silver, Ethiop waiters,
flitting about in spotless white, placed as by magic a repast at
which Delmonico himself could have had no occasion to blush;
and, indeed, in some respects it would be hard for that
distinguished <i>chef</i>
 to match our <i>menu</i>;
for, in addition to all that ordinarily makes
up a first-chop dinner, had we not our antelope steak (the gormand
who has not experienced this--bah! what does he know of the feast
of fat things?) our delicious mountain-brook trout, and choice
fruits and berries, and (sauce piquant and unpurchasable!) our
sweet-scented, appetite-compelling air of the prairies?
You may depend upon it, we all did justice to the good
things, and as we washed them down with bumpers of sparkling
Krug, whilst we sped along at the rate of thirty miles an hour,
agreed it was the <i>fastest</i>
living we had ever experienced.  (We beat that, however, two days
afterward when we made <i>twenty-seven miles in
twenty-seven minutes</i>,
while our Champagne glasses filled to the brim spilled not a
drop!)  After dinner we repaired to our drawing-room car, and, as
it was Sabbath eve, intoned some of the grand old hymns--"Praise
God from whom," etc.; "Shining Shore," "Coronation," etc.--the
voices of the men singers and of the women singers blending
sweetly in the evening air, while our train, with its great, glaring
Polyphemus eye, lighting up long vistas of prairie, rushed into the
night and the Wild.  Then to bed in luxurious couches, where we
slept the sleep of the just and only awoke the next morning
(Monday) at eight o'clock, to find ourselves at the crossing of the
North Platte, three hundred miles from Omaha--<i>fifteen hours and forty minutes out</i>.</blockquote>
