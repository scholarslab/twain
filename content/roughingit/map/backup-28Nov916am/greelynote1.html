<blockquote><font size=+1><b>*</b></font> &nbsp; Another feature of President Young's remarks on this topic strikes me on revision.
 He assumed as undeniable that, outside of the Mormon general rule, married men 
usually kept mistresses--that incontinence is the general rule, and continence the rare 
exception.  This assumption was habitual with the Mormons who, at various times, discussed 
with me the subject of polygamy.
