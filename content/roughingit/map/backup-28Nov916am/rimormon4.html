<center>CHAPTER XIV</center>
<p>M<font size=-1>R</font>. S<font size=-1>TREET</font> was very busy with his telegraphic matters--and 
considering that he had eight or nine hundred miles of rugged, 
snowy, uninhabited mountains, and waterless, treeless, melancholy 
deserts to traverse with his wire, it was natural and needful that he 
should be as busy as possible.  He could not go comfortably along 
and cut his poles by the road-side, either, but they had to be hauled 
by ox teams across those exhausting deserts--and it was two days' 
journey from water to water, in one or two of them.  Mr. Street's 
contract was a vast work, every way one looked at it; and yet to 
comprehend what the vague words "eight hundred miles of rugged 
mountains and dismal deserts" mean, one must go over the ground 
in person--pen and ink descriptions cannot convey the dreary 
reality to the reader.  And after all, Mr. S.'s mightiest difficulty 
turned out to be one which he had never taken into the account at 
all.  Unto Mormons he had sub-let the hardest and heaviest half of 
his great undertaking, and all of a sudden they concluded that they 
were going to make little or nothing, and so they tranquilly threw 
their poles overboard in mountain or desert, just as it happened 
when they took the notion, and drove home and went about their 
customary business!  They were under written contract to Mr. 
Street, but they did not care anything for that.  They said they 
would "admire" to see a "Gentile" force a Mormon to fulfil a 
losing contract in Utah!  And they made 
themselves very merry over the matter.  Street said--for it was he 
that told us these things:</p> 
<p>"I was in dismay.  I was under heavy bonds to complete my 
contract in a given time, and this disaster looked very much like 
ruin.  It was an astounding thing; it was such a wholly 
unlooked-for difficulty, that I was entirely nonplussed.  I am a 
business man--have always been a business man--do not know 
anything <i>but</i> business--and so  
you can imagine how like being struck by 
lightning it was to find myself in a country  
where <i>written contracts were  
worthless</i>!--that main security, that sheet-anchor,  
that absolute necessity, of 
business.  My confidence left me.  There was no use in making 
new contracts--that was plain.  I talked with first one prominent 
citizen and then another.  They all sympathized with me, first rate, 
but they did not know how to help me.  But at last a Gentile said, 
`Go to Brigham Young!--these small fry cannot do you any good.'  
I did not think much of the idea, for if  
the <i>law</i> could not help me,  
what could an individual do who had not even 
anything to do with either making the laws or executing them?  He 
might be a very good patriarch of a church and preacher in its 
tabernacle, but something sterner than religion and moral suasion 
was needed to handle a hundred refractory, halt-civilized 
sub-contractors.  But what was a man to do?  I thought if Mr. 
Young could not do anything else, he might probably be able to 
give me some advice and a valuable hint or two, and so I went 
straight to him and laid the whole case before him.  He said very 
little, but he showed strong interest all the way through.  He 
examined all the papers in detail, and whenever there seemed 
anything like a hitch, either in the papers or my statement, he 
would go back and take up the thread and follow it patiently out to 
an intelligent and satisfactory result.  Then he made a list of the 
contractors' names.  Finally he said:</p> 
<p>"`Mr. Street, this is all perfectly plain.  These contracts are 
strictly and legally drawn, and are duly signed and certified.  These 
men manifestly entered into them with their eyes open.  I see no 
fault or flaw anywhere.'</p> 
<p>"Then Mr. Young turned to a man waiting at the other 
end of the room and said: `Take this list of names to So-and-so, 
and tell him to have these men here at such-and-such an hour.'</p> 
<p>"They were there, to the minute.  So was I.  Mr. Young asked 
them a number of questions, and their answers made my statement 
good.  Then he said to them:</p> 

<p>"`You signed these contracts and assumed these obligations of 
your own free will and accord?'</p> 
<p>"`Yes.'</p> 
<p>"`Then carry them out to the letter, if it makes paupers of you!  
Go!'</p> 
<p>"And they <i>did</i> go, too!   
They are strung across the deserts now, working like 
bees.  And I never hear a word out of them.  There is a batch of 
governors, and judges, and other officials here, shipped from 
Washington, and they maintain the semblance of a republican form 
of government--but the 
petrified truth is that Utah is an absolute monarchy and Brigham 
Young is king!"</p>

<p>Mr. Street was a fine man, and I believe his story.  I knew him 
well during several years afterward in San Francisco.</p>
