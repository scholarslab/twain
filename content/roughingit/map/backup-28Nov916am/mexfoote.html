<p>The Mexican camp has little of that bustling energy which belongs to its neighbor on the floor below. It wakes
up slowly in the morning,--especially if the morning be cold,--and lounges abroad on moonlight nights, when
guitar-tinklings sound from the shadowy vine-flecked porches. The barest little cabin has its porch, its
climbing vines and shelf of carefully tended plants. Dark-eyed women sit on the door-steps in the sun
braiding a child's hair, perhaps, or chattering to a neighbor, who leans against the door-post with a
baby half hidden in the folds of her shawl. They walk up and down the hilly street, letting their gowns
trail in the dust, their heads enveloped in a shawl, one end of which is turned up over the shoulder;
the smooth, sliding step corresponds with the accent in speaking. In passing, they look at you with a
slow, grave stare like that of a child. All, even to the babies, have an air of repose; crudeness of
voice or manner is almost unknown among them.</p>
<P>The first time I went down into the mine one of the men of the party, as is the custom, passed a
bottle of whisky among the men in each "lab&oacute;r" we visited. The Cornish men drank in a hearty,
unconstrained fashion enough, but each Mexican, before raising the bottle to his lips, turned to the
two women of the party with a grave inclination and a Buena salud, Se&ntilde;oras! . . .</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; My last visit to the Mexican camp was during the yellow hazy July weather; it was
after a fire had swept away all the houses lying below and around the rock, which rises like a fortress
at the north-west end of camp. The bare sun-baked rock stood out, with all its reddish-yellow lights
and purple-brown shadows, in strong relief against the solid blue of the sky. Down its sides were the
blackened lines of brick which marked the foundations of the ruined houses. Below, was the little street
silent and deserted, with its quiet afternoon shadows stretching across it. It seemed old enough for
anything. It might have been a little Pompeiian street lying so still in the broad sunlight, under that
intensely blue-bright sky. I sat under the shadow of a Mexican cabin on the high bank overlooking the
street. A little girl named Amelia, too slight and small to carry the child she held wrapped in an
old shawl, stood beside me and told me the Spanish words for rock, and sky, and picture, and the names of
her brothers and sisters. The mother, leaning on the railing of the rough balcony above, smiled down at me
and counted them on her fingers--six in all--and then crossed both hands on her breast with a proud and
gentle gesture of triumph in the possession of the six. The cheerfulness of the whole family,--brown, ragged,
ill-fed, sickly and numerous as they were,--a cheerfulness which implied no hope or even understanding of
anything better, was the saddest thing in the whole of that warm, sunny desolation.</p>
