<P>It is now goin on 2 (too) yeres, as I very well, remember, since
I crossed the Planes for Kaliforny, the Brite land of Jold.  While
crossin the Planes all so bold I fell in with sum noble red men
of the forest (N. B. This is rote Sarcasticul.  Injins is Pizin,
whar ever found,) which thay Sed I was their Brother, & wantid
for to smoke the Calomel of Peace with me.  Thay then stole my
jerkt beef, blankits, etsettery, skalpt my orgin grinder & scooted
with a Wild Hoop.  Durin the Cheaf's techin speech he sed he shood
meet me in the Happy Huntin Grounds.  If he duz thare will be a fite.
But enuff of this ere.  <I>Reven Noose Muttons</I>, as our skoolmaster,
who has got Talent into him, cussy-cally obsarve.</P>

<P>I arrove at Salt Lake in doo time.  At Camp Scott there was a lot
of U. S. sojers, hosstensibly sent out thare to smash the mormons but
really to eat Salt vittles & play poker & other beautiful but sumwhat
onsartin games.  I got acquainted with sum of the officers.  Thay
lookt putty scrumpshus in their Bloo coats with brass buttings onto um
& ware very talented drinkers, but so fur as fitin is consarned I'd
willingly put my wax figgers agin the hull party. </P>

<P> My desire was to exhibit my grate show in Salt Lake City, so I
called on Brigham Yung, the grate mogull amung the mormins, and axed
his permishun to pitch my tent and onfurl my banner to the jentle
breezis.  He lookt at me in a austeer manner for a few minits,
and sed:</P>

<P>"Do you bleeve in Soloman, Saint Paul, the immaculateness of the
Mormin Church and the Latter-day Revelashuns?"</P>

<P> Sez I, "I'm on it!"  I make it a pint to git along plesunt, tho I
didn't know what under the Son the old feller was drivin at.  He
sed I mit show.</P>

<P> "You air a marrid man, Mister Yung, I bleeve?" sez I, preparin to
rite him sum free parsis.</P>

<P> "I hev eighty wives, Mister Ward.  I sertinly am marrid."</P>

<P>"How do you like it as far as you hev got?" sed I.</P>

<P> He sed "middlin," and axed me wouldn't I like to see his
famerly, to which I replide that I wouldn't mind minglin with
the fair Seck & Barskin in the winnin smiles of his interestin
wives.  He accordingly tuk me to his Scareum.  The house is
powerful big & in a exceedin large room was his wives & children,
which larst was squawkin and hollerin enuff to take the roof rite
orf the house.  The wimin was of all sizes and ages.  Sum was
pretty & sum was plane -- sum was helthy and sum was on the Wayne --
 which is verses, tho sich was not my intentions, as I don't 'prove
of putting verses in Proze rittins, tho ef occashun requires I can
Jerk a Poim ekal to any of them Atlantic Munthly fellers.</P>

<P>"My wives, Mister Ward," sed Yung.</P>

<P>"Your sarvant, marms," sed I, as I sot down in a cheer which
a red-heded female brawt me.</P>

<P>"Besides these wives you see here, Mister Ward," sed Yung, "I
hav eighty more in varis parts of this consecrated land which
air Sealed to me."</P>

<P>"Which?" sez I, gittin up & starin at him.</P>

<P>"Sealed, Sir! sealed."</P>

<P> "Whare bowts?" sez I. </P>

<P> "I sed, Sir, that they was sealed!" He spoke in a traggerdy
voice. </P>

<P>"Will they probly continner on in that stile to any grate
extent, Sir?" I axed. </P>

<P> "Sir," sed he furnin as red as a biled beet, "don't you know
that the rules of our Church is that I, the Profit, may hev as
meny wives as I wants?" </P>

<P>"Jes so," I sed. "You are old pie, ain't you?" </P>

<P>"Them as is Sealed to me -- that is to say, to be mine when I
wants um -- air at present my sperret-ooul wives," sed Mister Yung.</P>

<P>"Long may they wave!" sez I, seein I shood git into a scrape
ef I didn't look out.</P>

<P>In a privit conversashun with Brigham I learnt the follerin fax:
It takes him six weeks to kiss his wives.  He don't do it only onct
a yere & sez it is wuss nor cleanin house.  He don't pretend to know
his children, thare is so many of um, tho they all know him.  He sez
about every child he meats call him Par, & he takes it for grantid
it is so.  His wives air very expensiv.  Thay allers want suthin &
ef he don't buy it for um thay set the house in a uproar.  He sez he
don't have a minit's peace.  His wives fite amung theirselves so
much that he has bilt a fitin room for thare speshul benefit, & when
too of 'em get into a row he has em turnd loose into that place,
whare the dispoot is settled accordin to the rules of the London
prize ring.  Sumtimes thay abooz hisself individooally.  They hev
pulled the most of his hair out at the roots & he wares meny a horrible
scar upon his body, inflicted with mop-handles, broom-sticks and sich.
Occashunly they git mad & scald him with bilin hot water.  When
he get eny waze cranky thay'd shut him up in a dark closit,
previsly whippin him arter the stile of muthers when thare orfsprings
git onruly.  Sum-times when he went in swimmin thay'd go to the banks
of the Lake & steal all his close, thereby com-pellin him to sneek
home by a sircootius rowt, drest in the Skanderlus stile of the
Greek Slaiv.  "I find that the keers of a marrid life way hevy onto
me," sed the Profit, "& sumtimes I wish I'd remaned singel."  I
left the Profit and startid for the tavern whare I put up to.  On
my way I was overtuk by a lurge krowd of Mormons, which they surroundid
 me & statid that they were goin into the Show free.</P>

<P>"Wall," sez I, "ef I find a individooal who is goin round lettin
folks into his show free, I'll let you know." </P>

<P>"We've had a Revelashun biddin us go into A. Ward's Show
without payin nothin!" thay showtid. </P>

<P>"Yes," hollered a lot of femaile Mormonesses, ceasin me by
the cote tales & swingin me round very rapid, "we're all going
in free!  So sez the Revelashun!"</P>

<P>"What's Old Revelashun got to do with my Show?" sez I, gittin
putty rily.  "Tell Mister Revelashun," sed I, drawin myself up to
my full hite and lookin round upon the ornery krowd with a prowd &
defiant mean," tell Mister Revelahsun to mind his own bizness,
subject only to the Konstitushun of the United States!"</P>

<P>"Oh now let us in, that's a sweet man," sed several famails,
puttin thare arms rownd me in luvin stile.  "Becum 1 of us.
Becum a Preest & have wives Sealed to you."</P>

<P>"Not a Seal!" sez I, startin back in horror at the idee.</P>
<center><a href="javascript:Start('moraw.html')"><img src="morawt.jpg"></a></center>
<P>"Oh stay, Sir, stay," sed a tall, gawnt femaile, ore whoos
hed 37 summirs must hev parsd, "stay, & I'll be your Jentle
Gazelle." </P>

<P>"Not ef I know it, you won't," sez I.  "Awa you skanderlus
famaile, awa!  Go & be a Nunnery!"  That's what I sez, jes so.</P>

<P>"& I," sed a fat chunky femaile, who must hev wade more than too
hundred lbs., "I will be your sweet gidin Star!"</P>

<P> Sez I, "Ile bet two dollers and a half you won't!"  Whare ear I
may Rome Ile still be troo 2 thee, Oh Betsy Jane!  [N. B. Betsy
Jane is my wife's Sir naime.] </P>

<P> "Whiltist thou not tarry hear in the Promist Land?" sed several
of the miserabil critters.</P>

<P>"Ile see you all essenshally cussed be 4 I wiltists!"  roared I,
as mad as I cood be at thare infernul non-cents.  I girded up my Lions
and fled the Seen.  I packt up my duds & left Salt Lake, which is a
2nd Soddum & Germorrer, inhabitid by as theavin & onpriniopled a set
of retchis as ever drew Breth in eny spot on the Globe.</P>
