My sole amusement during that first dreary day [in Virginia City] was in gazing out upon the street.  Here I saw more Chinese than I had before beheld, and more Indians.  The latter, I am happy to say, are to a considerable degree accepting the situation, and becoming civilized and Christianized.  When sorely pinched the noble red man will bow his proud neck over the saw-horse to earn his daily tobacco and whiskey, and allow his squaw to earn their bread and potatoes by washing.<br><br>
