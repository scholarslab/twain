<center><b>THE WILD TRIBES OF THE WEST.</b></center><br>
These are very different in their habits from the natives that formerly occupied the country bordering upon the Atlantic coast.  The latter lived permanently in villages, where they cultivated the soil, and never wandered very far from them.  They did not use horses, but always made their war expeditions on foot, and never came into action unless they could screen themselves behind the cover of trees.  They inflicted the most inhuman tortures upon their prisoners, but did not, that I am aware, violate the chastity of women.<br><br>

The prairie tribes have no permanent abiding-places; they never plant a seed, but roam for hundreds of miles in every direction over the plains.  They are perfect horsemen, and seldom go to war on foot.  Their attacks are made in the open prairies, and when unhorsed they are powerless.  They do not, like the eastern Indians, inflict upon their prisoners prolonged tortures, but invariably subject all females that have the misfortune to fall into their merciless clutches to an ordeal worse than death.<br><br>
It is highly important to every man passing through a country frequented by Indians to know some of their habits, customs, and propensities; as this will facilitate his intercourse with friendly tribes, and enable him, when he wishes to avoid a conflict, to take precautions against coming in collision with those who are hostile. . . .<br><br>
<br>
All the Prairie Indians I have met with are the most inveterate beggars.  They will flock around strangers, and, in the most importunate manner, ask for everything they see, especially tobacco and sugar; and, if allowed, they will examine, handle, and occasionally pilfer such things as happen to take their fancy.  The proper way to treat them is to give them at once such articles as are to be disposed of, and then, in a firm and decided manner, let them understand that they are to receive nothing else. . . .<br><br>
<br>

A small number of white men, in traveling upon the Plains, should not allow a party of strange Indians to approach them unless able to resist an attack under the most unfavorable circumstances.<br><br>

It is a safe rule, when a man finds himself alone in the prairies, and sees a party of Indians approaching, not to allow them to come near him, and, if they persist in so doing, to signal them to keep away.  If they do not obey, and he  be mounted upon a fleet horse, he should make for the nearest timber.  If the Indians follow and press him too closely, he should halt, turn round, and point his gun at the foremost, which will often have the effect of turning them back, but he should never draw trigger unless he finds that his life depends upon the shot; for, as soon as his shot is delivered, his sole dependence, unless he have time to reload, must be upon the speed of his horse.<br><br>

The Indians of the Plains, notwithstanding the encomiums that have been heaped upon their brethren who formerly occupied the Eastern States for their gratitude, have not, so far as I have observed, the most distant conception of that sentiment.  You may confer numberless benefits upon them for years, and the more that is done for them the more they will expect.  They do not seem to comprehend the motive which dictates an act of benevolence or charity, and they invariably attribute it to fear or the expectation of reward.  When they make a present, it is with a view of getting more than its equivalent in return.<br><br>

I have never yet been able to discover that the Western wild tribes possessed any of those attributes which among civilized nations are regarded as virtues adorning the human character.  They have yet to be taught the first rudiments of civilization, and they are at this time as far from any knowledge of Christianity, and as worthy subjects for missionary enterprise, as the most untutored natives of the South Sea Islands.<br><br>

The only way to make these merciless freebooters fear or respect the authority of our government is, when they misbehave, first of all to chastise them well by striking such a blow as will be felt for a long time, and thus show them that we are superior to them in war.  Then will then respect us much more than when their good-will is purchased with presents.<br><br>

The opinion of a friend of mine, who has passed the last twenty-five years of his life among the Indians of the Rocky Mountains, corroborates the opinions I have advanced upon this head; and although I do not endorse all of his sentiments, yet many of them are deduced from long and matured experience and critical observation.  He says:--<br><br>

"They are the most onsartainest varmits in all creation, and I reckon tha'r not mor'n half human; for you never seed a human, arter you'd fed and treated him to the best fixins in your lodge, jist turn round and steal all your horses, or ary other thing he could lay his hands on.  No, not adzackly.  He would feel kinder grateful, and ask you to spread a blanket in his lodge ef you ever passed that away.  But the Injun he don't care shucks for you, and is ready to do you a heap of mischief as soon as he quits your feed.  No, Cap.," he continued, "it's not the right way to give um presents to buy peace; but ef I war governor of these yeer United States, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd invite um all to a big feast, and make b'lieve I wanted to have a big talk; and as soon as I got um all together, I'd pitch in and sculp about half of um, and then t'other half would be mighty glad to make a peace that would stick.  That's the way I'd make a treaty with the dog'ond, red-bellied varmints; and as sure as you're born, Cap., that's the only way."<br><br>
