          BRIEF SKETCH OF MORMON HISTORY
        </center>

        <p>M<font size="-1">ORMONISM</font> is only about forty
        years old, but its career has been full of stir and
        adventure from the beginning, and is likely to remain so to
        the end. Its adherents have been hunted and hounded from
        one end of the country to the other, and the result is that
        for years they have hated all "Gentiles" indiscriminately
        and with all their might. Joseph Smith, the finder of the
        Book of Mormon and founder of the religion, was driven from
        State to State with his mysterious copperplates and the
        miraculous stones he read their inscriptions with. Finally
        he instituted his "church" in Ohio and Brigham Young joined
        it. The neighbors began to persecute, and apostasy
        commenced. Brigham held to the faith and worked hard. He
        arrested desertion. He did more--he added converts in the
        midst of the trouble. He rose in favor and importance with
        the brethren. He was made one of the Twelve Apostles of the
        Church. He shortly fought his way to a higher post and a
        more powerful--President of the Twelve. The neighbors rose
        up and drove the Mormons out of Ohio, and they settled in
        Missouri. Brigham went with them. The Missourians drove
        them out and they retreated to Nauvoo, Illinois. They
        prospered there, and built a temple which made some
        pretensions to architectural grace and achieved some
        celebrity in a section of country where a brick court-house
        with a tin dome and a cupola on it was contemplated with
        reverential awe. But the Mormons were badgered and harried
        again by their neighbors. All the proclamations Joseph
        Smith could issue denouncing polygamy and repudiating it as
        utterly anti-Mormon were of no avail; the people of the
        neighborhood, on both sides of the Mississippi, claimed
        that polygamy was practised by the Mormons, and not only
        polygamy but a little of everything that was bad. Brigham
        returned from a mission to England, where he had
        established a Mormon newspaper, and he brought back with
        him several hundred converts to his preaching. His
        influence among the brethren augmented with every move he
        made. Finally Nauvoo was invaded by the Missouri and
        Illinois Gentiles, and Joseph Smith killed. A Mormon named
        Rigdon assumed the Presidency of the Mormon church and
        government, in Smith's place, and even tried his hand at a
        prophecy or two. But a greater than he was at hand. Brigham
        seized the advantage of the hour and without other
        authority than superior brain and nerve and will, hurled
        Rigdon from his high place and occupied it himself. He did
        more. He launched an elaborate curse at Rigdon and his
        disciples; and he pronounced Rigdon's "prophecies"
        emanations from the devil, and ended by "handing the false
        prophet over to the buffetings of Satan for a thousand
        years"--probably the longest term ever inflicted in
        Illinois. The people recognized their master. They
        straightway elected Brigham Young President, by a
        prodigious majority, and have never faltered in their
        devotion to him from that day to this. Brigham had
        forecast--a quality which no other prominent Mormon has
        probably ever possessed. He recognized that it was better
        to move to the wilderness than <i>be</i> moved. By his
        command the people gathered together their meagre effects,
        turned their backs upon their homes, and their faces toward
        the wilderness, and on a bitter night in February filed in
        sorrowful procession across the frozen Mississippi, lighted
        on their way by the glare from their burning temple, whose
        sacred furniture their own hands had fired! They camped,
        several days afterward, on the western verge of Iowa, and
        poverty, want, hunger, cold, sickness, grief and
        persecution did their work, and many succumbed and
        died--martyrs, fair and true, whatever else they might have
        been. Two years the remnant remained there, while Brigham
        and a small party crossed the country and founded Great
        Salt Lake City, purposely choosing a land which was
        <i>outside the ownership and jurisdiction of the hated
        American nation</i>. Note that. This was in 1847. Brigham
        moved his people there and got them settled just in time to
        see disaster fall again. For the war closed and Mexico
        ceded Brigham's refuge to the enemy--the United States! In
        1849 the Mormons organized a "free and independent"
        government and erected the "State of Deseret," with Brigham
        Young as its head. But the very next year Congress
        deliberately snubbed it and created the "Territory of Utah"
        out of the same accumulation of mountains, sage-brush,
        alkali and general desolation,--but made Brigham Governor
        of it. Then for years the enormous migration across the
        plains to California poured through the land of the Mormons
        and yet the church remained staunch and true to its lord
        and master. Neither hunger, thirst, poverty, grief, hatred,
        contempt, nor persecution could drive the Mormons from
        their faith or their allegiance; and even the thirst for
        gold, which gleaned the flower of the youth and strength of
        many nations was not able to entice them! That was the
        final test. An experiment that could survive that was an
        experiment with some substance to it somewhere.</p>

        <p>Great Salt Lake City throve finely, and so did Utah. One
        of the last things which Brigham Young had done before
        leaving Iowa, was to appear in the pulpit dressed to
        personate the worshipped and lamented prophet Smith, and
        confer the prophetic succession, with all its dignities,
        emoluments and authorities, upon "President Brigham Young!"
        The people accepted the pious fraud with the maddest
        enthusiasm, and Brigham's power was sealed and secured for
        all time. Within five years afterward he openly added
        polygamy to the tenets of the church by authority of a
        "revelation" which he pretended had been received nine
        years before by Joseph Smith, albeit Joseph is amply on
        record as denouncing polygamy to the day of his death.</p>

        <p>Now was Brigham become a second Andrew Johnson in the
        small beginning and steady progress of his official
        grandeur. He had served successively as a disciple in the
        ranks; home missionary; foreign missionary; editor and
        publisher; Apostle; President of the Board of Apostles;
        President of all Mormondom, civil and ecclesiastical;
        successor to the great Joseph by the will of heaven;
        "prophet," "seer," "revelator." There was but one dignity
        higher which he <i>could</i> aspire to, and he reached out
        modestly and took that--he proclaimed himself a God!</p>

        <p>He claims that he is to have a heaven of his own
        hereafter, and that he will be its God, and his wives and
        children its goddesses, princes and princesses. Into it all
        faithful Mormons will be admitted, with their families, and
        will take rank and consequence according to the number of
        their wives and children. If a disciple dies before he has
        had time to accumulate enough wives and children to enable
        him to be respectable in the next world any friend can
        marry a few wives and raise a few children for him <i>after
        he is dead</i>, and they are duly credited to his account
        and his heavenly status advanced accordingly.</p>

        <p>Let it be borne in mind that the majority of the Mormons
        have always been ignorant, simple, of an inferior order of
        intellect, unacquainted with the world and its ways; and
        let it be borne in mind that the wives of these Mormons are
        necessarily after the same pattern and their children
        likely to be fit representatives of such a conjunction; and
        then let it be remembered that <i>for forty years</i> these
        creatures have been driven, driven, driven, relentlessly!
        and mobbed, beaten, and shot down; cursed, despised,
        expatriated; banished to a remote desert, whither they
        journeyed gaunt with famine and disease, disturbing the
        ancient solitudes with their lamentations and marking the
        long way with graves of their dead--and all because they
        were simply trying to live and worship God in the way which
        <i>they</i> believed with all their hearts and souls to be
        the true one. Let all these things be borne in mind, and
        then it will not be hard to account for the deathless
        hatred which the Mormons bear our people and our
        government.</p>

        <p>That hatred has "fed fat its ancient grudge" ever since
        Mormon Utah developed into a self-supporting realm and the
        church waxed rich and strong. Brigham as Territorial
        Governor made it plain that Mormondom was for the Mormons.
        The United States tried to rectify all that by appointing
        territorial officers from New England and other anti-Mormon
        localities, but Brigham prepared to make their entrance
        into his dominions difficult. Three thousand United States
        troops had to go across the plains and put these gentlemen
        in office. And after they were in office they were as
        helpless as so many stone images. They made laws which
        nobody minded and which could not be executed. The federal
        judges opened court in a land filled with crime and
        violence and sat as holiday spectacles for insolent crowds
        to gape at--for there was nothing to try, nothing to do.
        nothing on the dockets! And if a Gentile brought a suit,
        the Mormon jury would do just as it pleased about bringing
        in a verdict, and when the judgment of the court was
        rendered no Mormon cared for it and no officer could
        execute it. Our Presidents shipped one cargo of officials
        after another to Utah, but the result was always the
        same--they sat in a blight for awhile they fairly feasted
        on scowls and insults day by day, they saw every attempt to
        do their official duties find its reward in darker and
        darker looks, and in secret threats and warnings of a more
        and more dismal nature--and at last they either succumbed
        and became despised tools and toys of the Mormons, or got
        scared and discomforted beyond all endurance and left the
        Territory. If a brave officer kept on courageously till his
        pluck was proven, some pliant Buchanan or Pierce would
        remove him and appoint a stick in his place. In 1857
        General Harney came very near being appointed Governor of
        Utah. And so it came very near being Harney governor and
        Cradlebaugh judge!--two men who never had any idea of fear
        further than the sort of murky comprehension of it which
        they were enabled to gather from the dictionary. Simply (if
        for nothing else) for the variety they would have made in a
        rather monotonous history of Federal servility and
        helplessness, it is a pity they were not fated to hold
        office together in Utah.</p>

        <p>Up to the date of our visit to Utah, such had been the
        Territorial record. The Territorial government established
        there had been a hopeless failure, and Brigham Young was
        the only real power in the land. He was an absolute
        monarch--a monarch who defied our President--a monarch who
        laughed at our armies when they camped about his capital--a
        monarch who received without emotion the news that the
        august Congress of the United States had enacted a solemn
        law against polygamy, and then went forth calmly and
        married twenty-five or thirty more wives.</p>
