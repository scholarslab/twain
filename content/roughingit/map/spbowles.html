        <p>...we enter upon the night ride through Bridger's Pass,
        from the Atlantic to the Pacific slopes of the Rocky
        Mountains. You need to be told what you are doing. There is
        no slow hill-climbing; the horses trot the stage along; and
        the soldier escort gallop behind. Not through valleys
        still, but apparently along and up the beds of departed
        rivers, with mountain walls on either hand,--sometimes ten
        or twenty miles wide, and again narrowing to rods, but
        oftenest miles in width; on one side bare, perpendicular
        walls of rock, thrown into all imaginable and unscientific
        combinations of the original or sub-original formations,
        and since carved and fluted by wind and sand and rain into
        all and every shape that architecture ever created, or
        imagination fancied; on the other, rounded hill-side with
        scant verdure and occasional stunted tree and frequent
        snow-bank. Not in one continuous bed or valley, was our
        upward course, but a succession of such, leading one into
        another.</p>

        <p>So we rode on through the clear twilight, that lingers
        till nine and ten o'clock in this region, into the rich
        moonlight that only gave new form and beauty to the rocks;
        and out into the morning dawn that hastens on at two to
        three; watching the water to see which way it ran, and
        building Pacific Railroads along these easy grades back to
        home and forward to fame and fortune. I was in the saddle,
        galloping with the captain of the escort; but the earlier
        and more enthusiastic lieutenant-governor of Illinois, who
        kept guard with the driver on the box, shouted out the
        passage over the line--it was no more than a
        "thank-ye-marm" in a New England's winter sleigh-ride, yet
        it separates the various and vast waters of a Continent,
        and marks the fountains of the two great oceans of the
        globe. But it was difficult to be long enthusiastic over
        this infinitesimal point of mud; the night was very cold,
        and I was sore in unpoetical parts from unaccustomed
        saddles, and I got down from all my high horses, and into
        my corner of the stage, at the next station. [pages
