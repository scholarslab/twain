      <td>The Chinese are hardly used here. In the first place,
      they are taxed four dollars each per month for the naked
      privilege of mining at all. Next, they are not allowed to
      mine anywhere but in diggings which white men have worked out
      and abandoned, or which no white man considers worth working.
      Thirdly, if these rejected diggings happen, in Chinese hands,
      to prove better than their reputation, and to begin yielding
      liberally, a mob of white sovereigns soon drive the Chinese
      out of them, neck and heels. "John" [Chinaman] does not seem
      to be a very bad fellow, but he is treated worse than though
      he were. He is not malignant nor sanguinary, and seldom harms
      any but his own tribe. But he is thoroughly sensual, and
      intent on the fullest gratification of his carnal appetites,
      and on nothing else. He eats and drinks the best he can get,
      and as much as he can hold; but he is never so devoid of
      self-respect as to be seen drunk in a public place; even for
      an opium debauch, he secludes himself where none but a
      friendly eye can reach him. His "particular wanity" in the
      eating line is rice, whereof he will have the best only, if
      the best is to be had; he likes a fat chicken also, and will
      pay his last dollar for one, rather than go without. Lacking
      the dollar, it is charged that he will rob hen roosts; at all
      events, hen roosts are sometimes robbed, and "John" has to
      bear the blame. He is popularly held to spend nothing, but
      carry all his gains out of the country and home to his native
      land--a charge disproved by the fact that he is an inveterate
      gambler, an opium smoker, a habitual rum drinker,and a
      devotee of every sensual vice. But he is weak in body, and
      not allowed to vote, so it is safe to trample on him; he does
      not write English, and so cannot tell the story of his
      wrongs; he has no family here (the few Chinese women brought
      to this country being utterly shameless and abandoned), so
      that he forms no domestic ties, and enjoys no social
      standing. Even the wretched Indians of California repel with
      scorn the suggestion that there is any kinship between their
      race and the Chinese. "John" has traits which I can neither
      praise nor justify; yet I suspect that, if other men's faults
      were punished as severely as his, a good many Californians
      would be less comfortable than they are.<br />
