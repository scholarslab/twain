        <p>It will, I suppose, be necessary to supply a popular
        view of the "peculiar institution," at once the bane and
        blessing of Mormonism,--plurality. I approach the subject
        with a feeling of despair, so conflicting are opinions
        concerning it, and so difficult is it to naturalize in
        Europe the customs of Asia, Africa, and America, or to
        reconcile the habits of the 19th century A.D. with those of
        1900 B.C. A return to the patriarchal ages, we have seen,
        has its disadvantages.</p>

        <p>There is a prevailing idea, especially in England and
        even the educated are laboring under it, that the Mormons
        are Communists or Socialists of Plato's, Cicero's, Mr.
        Owen's, and M. Cabet's school; that wives are in public,
        and that a woman can have as many husbands as the husband
        can have wives--in fact, to speak colloquially, that they
        "all pig together." The contrary is notably the case. The
        man who, like Messrs. Hamilton and Howard Egan, murders, in
        cold blood, his wife's lover, is invariably acquitted, the
        jury declaring that civil damages mark the rottenness of
        other governments, and that "the principle, the only one
        that beats and throbs through the heart of the <i>entire
        inhabitants</i> (!) of this Territory, is simply this:
        <i>The man who seduces his neighbor's wife must die, and
        her nearest relation must kill him."</i> Men, like Dr.
        Vaughan and Mr. Monroe, slain for the mortal sin, perish
        for their salvation; the Prophet, were they to lay their
        lives at his feet, would, because unable to hang or behead
        them, counsel them to seek certain death in a righteous
        cause as an expiatory sacrifice,<font size="+1"><b><a href=
        "javascript:Start('burtonnote1.html')">*</a></b></font>
        which may save their souls alive. Their two mortal sins
        are: 1. Adultery; 2. Shedding of innocent blood.</p>

        <p>This severity of punishing an offense which modern and
        civilized society looks upon rather in the light of a sin
        than of a crime, is clearly based upon the Mosaic code. It
        is also, <i>lex loci</i>, the "common mountain law," a
        "religious and social custom," and a point of personal
        honor. Another idea underlies it: the Mormons hold, like
        the Hebrews of old, "children of shame" in extreme
        dishonor. They quote the command of God, Deuteronomy
        (xxiii., 2), "a mamzer shall not enter into the Church of
        the Lord til the tenth generation," and ask when the order
        was repealed. They would expel all impurity from the Camp
        of Zion, and they adopt every method of preventing what
        they consider a trememdous evil, viz., the violation of
        God's temple in their own bodies.</p>

        <center>
          [<i>One paragraph omitted.</i>]
        </center>

        <p>The first wife, as among polygamists generally, is
        <i>the</i> wife, and assumes the husband's name and title.
        Her "plurality"-partners are called sisters--such as Sister
        Anne or Sister Blanche--and are the aunts of her children.
        The first wife is married for time, the other are sealed
        for eternity. Hence, according to the Mormons, arose the
        Gentile calumny concerning spiritual wifedom, which they
        distinctly deny. Girls rarely remain single past
        sixteen--in England the average marrying age is thirty--and
        they would be the pity of the community if they were doomed
        to a waste of youth so unnatural.</p>

        <center>
          [<i>Two paragraphs omitted.]</i>
        </center>

        <p>The "chaste and plural marriage," being once legalized,
        finds a multitude of supporters. The anti-Mormons declare
        that it is at once fornication and adultery--a sin which
        absorbs all others. The Mormons point triumphantly to the
        austere morals of their community, their superior freedom
        from maladive influences, and the absence of that
        uncleanness and licentiousness which distinguish the cities
        of the civilized world. They boast that, if it be an evil,
        they have at least chosen the lesser evil; that they
        practice openly as a virtue what others do secretly as a
        sin--how full is society of these latent Mormons!--that
        their plurality has abolished the necessity of concubinage,
        cryptogamy, contubernium, celibacy, <i>mariages du
        treizi&egrave;me arrondissement</i>, with their terrible
        consequences, infanticide, and so forth; that they have
        removed their ways from those "whose end is bitter as
        wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword." Like its sister
        institution Slavery, the birth and growth of a similar age,
        Polygamy acquires <i>vim</i> by abuse and detraction: the
        more turpitude is heaped upon it, the brighter and more
        glorious it appears to its votaries.</p>

        <p>There are rules and regulations of Mormonism--I can not
        say whether they date before or after the heavenly command
        to pluralize--which disprove the popular statement that
        such marriages are made to gratify licentiousness, and
        which render polygamy a positive necessity. All sensuality
        in the married state is strictly forbidden beyond the
        requisite for insuring progeny--the practice, in fact, of
        Adam and Abraham. During the gestation and nursing of
        children, the strictest continence on the part of the
        mother is required--rather for a hygienic than for a
        religious reason. The same custom is practiced in part by
        the Jews, and in whole by some of the noblest tribes of
        savages: the splendid physical development of the Kaffir
        race in South Africa is attributed by some authors to rule
        of continence like that of the Mormons, and to a lactation
        prolonged for two years. The anomaly of such a practice in
        the midst of civilization is worthy of a place in De
        Balzac's great repertory of morbid anatomy: it is only to
        be equaled by the exceptional nature of the Mormon's
        position, his past fate and his future prospects.
        Spartan-like, the Faith wants a race of warriors, and it
        adopts the best means to obtain them.</p>

        <center>
          [<i>One paragraph omitted.</i>]
        </center>

        <p>To the unprejudiced traveler it appears that polygamy is
        the rule where population is required, and where the great
        social evil has not had time to develop itself. In Paris or
        London the institution would, like slavery, die a natural
        death; in Arabia and in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains it
        maintains a strong hold upon the affections of mankind.
        Monogamy is best fitted for the large, wealthy, and
        flourishing communities in which man is rarely the happier
        because his quiver is full of children, and where the
        Het&aelig;ra becomes the succedaneum of the
        "plurality-wife." Polyandry has been practiced principally
        by priestly and barbarous tribes, who fear most for the
        increase of their numbers, which would end by driving them
        to honest industry. It reappears in a remarkable manner in
        the highest state of social civilization, where excessive
        expenditure is an obstacle to freehold property, and the
        practice is probably on the increase.</p>

        <p>The other motive for polygamy in Utah is economy.
        Servants are rare and costly; it is cheaper and more
        comfortable to marry them. Many converts are attracted by
        the prospect of becoming wives, especially from places
        where, like Clifton, there are sixty-four females to
        thirty-six males. The old maid is, as she ought to be, an
        unknown entity. Life in the wilds of Western America is a
        course of severe toil: a single woman can not perform the
        manifold duties of housekeeping, cooking, scrubbing,
        washing, darning, child-bearing, and nursing a family. A
        division of labor is necessary, and she finds it by
        acquiring a sisterhood. Throughout the States, whenever a
        woman is seen at manual or outdoor work, one is certain
        that she is Irish, German, or Scandinavian. The delicacy
        and fragility of the Anglo-American female nature is at
        once the cause and the effect of this exemption from
        toil.</p>

          [<i>One paragraph omitted.</i>]
        </center>

        <p>It will be asked, what view does the softer sex take of
        polygamy? A few, mostly from the Old Country, lament that
        Mr. Joseph Smith ever asked of the Creator that question
        which was answered in the affirmative. A very few, like the
        Curia Electa, Emma, the first wife of Mr. Joseph Smith--who
        said of her, by-the-by, that she could not be contented in
        heaven without rule--apostatize, and become Mrs. Bridemann.
        The many are, as might be expected of the easily-moulded
        weaker vessel, which proves its inferior position by the
        delicate flattery of imitation, more in favor of polygyny
        than the stronger.</p><br />

          <h3>From Chapter XI: Last Days at Great Salt Lake
          City</h3>
        </center>

        <p>I <font size="-1">NOW</font> terminate my observations
        upon the subject of Mormonism. It will be remarked that the
        opinions of others--not my own-- have been recorded as
        carefully as my means of study have permitted, and that
        facts, not theories, have been the object of this
        dissertation.</p>

        <p>It will, I think, be abundantly evident that Utah
        Territory has been successful in its colonization. Every
        where, indeed, in the New World, the stranger wonders that
        a poor man should tarry in Europe, or that a rich man
        should remain in America; nothing but the strongest chains
        of habit and <i>vis intertioe</i> can reconcile both to
        their miserable lots. I can not help thinking that, morally
        and spiritually, as well as physically, the
        <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i> of the Perpetual Emigration
        Fund gain by being transferred to the Far West. Mormonism
        is emphatically the faith of the poor, and those acquainted
        with the wretched condition of the English mechanic,
        collier, and agricultural laborer--it is calculated that a
        million of them exist on &pound;25 per annum--who, after a
        life of ignoble drudgery, of toiling through the year from
        morning till night, are ever threatened with the
        work-house, must be of the same opinion. Physically
        speaking, there is no comparison between the conditions of
        the Saints and the class from which they are mostly taken.
        In point of mere morality, the Mormon community is perhaps
        purer than any other of equal numbers. I have no wish to
        commend their spiritual, or, rather, their materialistic
        vagaries--a materialism so leveling in its unauthorized
        deductions that even the materialist must reject it; but
        with the mind as with the body, bad food is better than
        none. When wealth shall be less unequally distributed in
        England, thus doing away with the contrast of excessive
        splendor and utter destitution, and when Home Missions
        shall have done their duty in educating and evangelizing
        the unhappy pariahs of town and country, the sons of the
        land which boasts herself to be the foremost among the
        nations will blush no more to hear that the Mormons or
        Latter-Day Saints are mostly English.</p>
