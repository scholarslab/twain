        <p>The gulch miner has been here in all his pristine
        strength and glory. Gravel, sand, bowlders, rocks--not one
        stone left upon another; not one where Nature put it. The
        entire bed of the stream in the condition of the Kentuckian
        who was "uneasy in his mind." It was all "tore up." Here
        sent as high up the bank as impossible hydraulics would
        allow, and left to feel and trickle its way along a steep
        mountain side some hundred feet below, that crowbar,
        pickaxe, and spade might hold high revel in its quiet bed;
        there put into the straight-jacket of a race, to feed that
        waterwheel now rotting like the dam above it. Old cradles,
        broken rockers, quartz pounders half completed and
        abandoned, a lonely grave or two up the hillside, requiemed
        over every night by the wild pines. Nothing more is left of
        the gulch miner, whose occasional prize of a nugget lured
        hundreds from happy homes and richer placers in their quiet
        fields. He has passed on. He is eighty or a hundred miles
        further west, close behind the trapper, whose quiet haunts
        he invaded.</p>

        <p>Mining here is no longer the matter of the chance
        finding of a little dust and a few spangles. The surface
        gold is already picked up, and the lodes are now owned by
        associations and companies, who, with the aid of science,
        propose to get the precious metal out of the bowels of the
        earth.</p>

        <p>We soon come upon chimneys, large wheels, machinery,
        mills, steamengines--many of the latter not yet put up.
        Presently the valley becomes a continuous settlement, and
        so we go on some two miles. Just below Black Hawk we pass a
        large and handsomely constructed building of stone, erected
        some two years since by Fitz John Porter, as agent for a
        mining company. The company never did any mining, its funds
        being mainly absorbed in preliminary building.</p>

        <p>Black Hawk is a long street of mills, stables, houses,
        and shops, all in the mining interest. Where it ends and
        Central City begins, in going up the valley, does not
        appear, but presently you are in "Central."</p>

        <p>The desolation and literal dilapidation of the bed of
        the creek has now extended up the sides of the valley to
        their summits. They look like mountains in reduced
        circumstances, and in a shockingly bad state of repair.
        Trees and vegetation have long since disappeared. Holes,
        shafts, and excavations almost obliterate the original
        surface. Hoisting wheels; here and there, show that a depth
        is reached beyond ordinary digging. Lower down the
        hillside, holes of four to twelve feet in horizontal depth
        into the solid rock show that some poor fellow has thrown
        away clays of hard toil for bitter disappointment.</p>
