      <td>But the reader is already familiar with this condition of
      things in the country, because the hero of our story has been
      here before, and to apply the term explorer here to Fremont,
      and to call this an exploring expedition, seems farcical,
      only as we remember that there had not yet been written any
      scientific description of this region, so long familiar to
      the trappers, and to none more than Carson.<br />
      <br />
      They had now approached the road at what is called the South
      Pass. The ascent had been so gradual, that, with all the
      intimate knowledge possessed by Carson, who had made this
      country his home for seventeen years, they were obliged to
      watch very closely to find the place at which they reached
      the culminating point. This was between two low hills, rising
      on either hand fifty or sixty feet.<br />
      <br />
      Approaching it from the mouth of the Sweet Water, a sandy
      plain, one hundred and twenty miles long, conducts, by a
      gradual and regular ascent, to the summit, about seven
      thousand feet above the sea; and the traveler, without being
      reminded of any change by toilsome ascents, suddenly finds
      himself on the waters which flow to the Pacific ocean. . .
      .<br />
      <br />
      They continued on till they came to a tributary of the Green
      River, and then followed the stream up to a lake at its
      source in the mountains, and had here a view of extraordinary
      magnificence and grandeur, beyond what is seen in any part of
      the Alps . . .<br />
