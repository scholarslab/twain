      <td>Only a few miles from Paragoy's, and we were on
      Inspiration Point, looking down on the mighty Mecca of our
      pilgrimage, -- on awful depth and vastness, wedded to
      unimagined brightness and loveliness, -- a sight that
      appalled, while it attracted; a sublime terror; a beautiful
      abyss; the valley of the shadow of God!<br />
      <br />
      It seemed to me as I gazed, that here was Nature's last, most
      cunning hiding-place for her utmost sublimities, her rarest
      splendors. Here she had worked her divinest miracles with
      water and sunlight, -- lake, river, cataract, cascade, spray,
      mist, and rainbows by the thousand. It was but a little strip
      of smiling earth to look down on after all; but ah! the
      stupendousness of its surroundings! There were arched and
      pillared rocks, so massive, so immense, it seemed they might
      have formed the foundation-walls of a continent; and domes so
      vast they seemed like young worlds rounding out of chaos. . .
      .<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      It was wonderful to us, if not to others, how comparatively
      fresh we were after a day of unprecedented fatigue and
      excitement. There must be some magic of stimulus and
      sustainment in the air of the Sierras. A good supper and good
      company further cheered and supported us, and, last of all,
      before sleep, there was for us absolute physical rejuvenation
      in the warm baths of the Cosmopolitan Saloon, just opposite
      our cottage. Here we were astonished to find -- when we had
      expected to rough it -- absolutely sybaritic arrangements, --
      large, bright bathing-rooms; spacious tubs, exquisitely
      clean; a limitless supply of pure, soft water; towels, fine
      and coarse, in profusion; delicate toilet-soaps; bottles of
      bay rum; Florida water and arnica, court-plaster, pins,
      needles, thread, and buttons, for repairing dilapidations;
      and late "Atlas" and "Bulletins" for fresh "bustles." The
      floors are all handsomely carpeted, the walls are hung with
      delicate paper, and decorated with pictures and mirrors, and
      cornices are daintily gilded. Here, after all our long
      excursions, hard rides, and harder climbs, we took baths of
      balm, of delicious soothing and healing. To find such luxury
      and comfort in the awful sunken fastness of this valley seems
      something absolutely marvelous, the work of enchantment; but
      the magical agencies have been only keen business foresight,
      energy, pluck, perseverance, and pack-mules. . . .<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      On my first night in the valley, the strangeness of my
      surroundings, a sort of sombre delight that took possession
      of me, would not let me sleep for several hours. Once I rose
      and looked out, or tried to look out. The sky was clouded; it
      seemed to me the stars drew back from the abyss. It was
      filled with night and sound. I could not see the mighty rocks
      that walled us in, but a sense of their shadow was upon me.
      There was in the awe I felt no element of real dread or fear,
      but it was thrilled by fantastic terrors. I thought of
      Whitney's theory of the formation of the great pit, by
      subsidence. What if it should take another start in the
      night, and settle a mile or two with us, leaving the trail by
      which we descended, dangling in the air, and the cataracts
      all spouting away, with no outlet! But in the morning the
      jolly sun peered down upon us, laughing, as much as to say,
      "There you are, are you?" and the sweet, cool winds dipped
      down from the pines and the snows, the great fall shouted and
      danced all the way down his stupendous rocky stairway, the
      river, and overflowed meadows rippled and flashed with
      immemorial glee. It seems to me that darkness is darker and
      light lighter in the Yosemite than anywhere else of earth. .
      . .<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      The vague sense of oppression and imprisonment I have alluded
      to, doubtless often drives nervous tourists from the valley
      after so brief a visit that it must seem to them ever after
      like a wild, troubled dream of vast precipices and domes, of
      dizzy points, of booming cataracts and roaring rapids, of
      toiling up and plunging down steep trails, on sore-backed
      mules and bucking broncos. In fact, the valley, in the height
      of its short season, is a confused scene of hurry, pushing,
      and scrambling. Horses, mules, mustangs, and donkeys are
      burdened and goaded, and driven to the last point of
      endurance, and too often beyond. "All creation groaneth and
      <i>travelleth</i>" in the Yosemite. There is a vast deal to
      be seen hereabouts, yet none of the great points are very
      easy of access. There is no royal road to them; but if
      tourists who are strong enough, would give themselves a
      reasonable amount of time, they would see everything better
      by going on foot and sparing the wretched animals who now
      stagger under them in mute agony, and, perhaps, execrate the
      picturesque in their meek souls. Some unhappy people you see
      doing all the sights, driving through all the excursions,
      with a sort of gloomy desperation, as though obeying the
      injunction, "See the Yosemite and die," or under a contract
      to return to San Francisco on the very next Friday and be
      hanged.<br />
