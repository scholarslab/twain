        "figures/webb01t.jpg" vspace="12" alt="1872 ILLUSTRATION" /></a> Monday was our day
        of final preparation, and we commenced it by making the
        acquaintance of those two celebrated characters, Wild Bill
        and Buffalo Bill, or, more correctly, William Hickok and
        William Cody. The former was acting as sheriff of the town,
        and the latter we engaged as our guide to the Saline.</p>

        <p>Wild Bill made his <i>entree</i> into one court of the
        temple of fame some years since through Harper's Magazine.
        Since then his name has become a household word to
        residents along the Kansas frontier. We found him very
        quiet and gentlemanly, and not at all the reckless fellow
        we had supposed. His form won our admiration -- the
        shoulders of a Hercules with the waist of a girl. Much has
        been written about Wild Bill that is pure fiction. I do not
        believe, for example, that he could hit a nickel across the
        street with a pistol-ball, any more than an Indian could do
        so with an arrow. These feats belong to romance. Bill is
        wonderfully handy with his pistols, however. He then
        carried two of them, and while we were at Hays snuffed a
        man's life out with one; but this was done in his capacity
        of officer. Two rowdies devoted their energies to brewing a
        riot, and defied arrest until, at Bill's first shot, one
        fell dead, and the other threw up his arms in token of
        submission. During his lifetime Bill has probably killed
        his baker's dozen of men, but he has never, I believe, been
        known as the aggressor. To the people of Hays he was a
        valuable officer, making arrests when and where none other
        dare attempt it. His power lies in the wonderful quickness
        with which he draws a pistol and takes his aim. These first
        shots, however, can not always last. "They that take the
        sword shall perish with the sword"; and living as he does
        by the pistol, Bill will certainly die by it, unless he
        abandons the frontier. . . .</p>

        <p>Buffalo Bill was to be our guide. He informed us that
        Wild Bill was his cousin. Cody is spare and wiry in figure,
        admirably versed in plain lore, and altogether the best
        guide I ever saw. The mysterious plain is a book that he
        knows by heart. He crossed it twice as teamster, while a
        mere boy, and has spent the greater part of his life on it
        since. He led us over its surface on starless nights, when
        the shadow of the blackness above hid our horses and the
        earth, and though many a time with no trail to follow and
        on the very mid-ocean of the expanse, he never made a
        failure. Buffalo Bill has since figured in one of
        Buntline's Indian romances. We award him the credit of
        being a good scout and most excellent guide; but the fact
        that he can slaughter buffalo is by no means remarkable,
        since the American bison is dangerous game only to
        amateurs.</p><br />

        <p><a href=
        "javascript:Start2('figures2/herwebb01.jpg')"><img src=
          "figures2/herwebb01t.jpg" vspace="12" alt="1872 ILLUSTRATION" /></a> It was
        extremely fortunate for us that we had secured Cody as
        guide. The whole western country bordering on the plains,
        as we afterward learned, from sorry experience, is infested
        with numberless charlatans, blazing with all sorts of
        hunting and fighting titles, and ready at the rustle of
        greenbacks to act as guides through a land they know
        nothing about. These reprobates delight in telling
        thrilling tales of their escapes from Indians, and are
        constantly chilling the blood of their shivering party by
        pointing out spots where imaginary murders took place.
        Without compasses they would be as hopelessly lost as
        needleless mariners. I have my doubts if one-third of these
        terribly named bullies could tell, on a pinch, where the
        north star is. Unless they chanced to strike one of the
        Pacific lines which stretch across the plains, a party,
        under their guidance, wishing to go west would be equally
        liable to get among the Northern Siouxs or the Ku-Klux of
        Arkansas.</p>

        <p>A thousand miles east Young America's cherished ideal of
        the frontier scout and guide is an eagle-eyed giant, with a
        horse which obeys his whistle, and breaks the neck of any
        Indian trying to steal him. In addition to its wonderful
        master, the back of this model steed is usually occupied by
        a rescued maiden. At risk of infringing on the copyrights
        of thirty-six thousand of the latest Indian stories, we
        have obtained from an artist on the spot an illustration of
        the last heroine brought in and her rescuer, the rare old
        plainsman.</p>
