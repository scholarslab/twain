        <p>In his day-dreams, the Spaniard of the sixteenth century
        saw an Eldorado in the unknown West; a land of gold and
        glittering gems, of flowers and fruit, of shining sands and
        crystal streams,of soft air and mild skies; where a
        temperate climate and fertile soil promised bodily ease,
        and unfailing health was to be gained from fountains of
        youth-restoring virtue -- the Hesperia of ancient poets
        realized in the New World. For this, Narvaez, De Soto, and
        a host of others, sought long and traveled far, but died
        without the sight; nature had provided no "Islands of the
        blest," even amid the soft airs of the Pacific.</p>

        <p>There was, however, an El Dorado there; not the fabled
        clime which lured the imaginative Spaniard, but still a
        land of wealth and plenty, where industry was to find a
        bounteous reward, and enterprise build up a golden State.
        But not for a superstitious race, ignorant of true liberty,
        was this doman reserved. In the divine predestination of
        history this hidden wealth was to serve the purposes of
        freedom; it was to aid a civilization based on individual
        thought and energy; to strengthen a free Republic, and in
        the dark hour furnish the "sinews of war," in a
        death-struggle with slavery. . . .</p><br />

        <p>But my acquaintance in Santa Fe was of quite a
        miscellaneous character -- "from the duke to the dustman."
        I took a Spanish teacher (male), and the third day of my
        studies "interviewed" him thus:</p>

        <p>"<i>Hay baile esta noche, Senor!</i>"</p>

        <p>"<i>Si, Senor, quiere uste avenir? Habra Senoritas
        bonitas.</i>"</p>

        <p>"<i>Eso quisiera yo.</i>"</p>

        The result of this attempt at Castilian was a visit to that
        evening's <i>baile</i> (<i>by-lay</i>), or Mexican dance.
        Americans improperly call them <i>fandangoes</i>, applying
        the name of one kind of dance to the whole proceeding -- as
        if one should call an American mind a "schottische." They
        are the national amusement. All new-comers of importance
        are welcomed with a public ball, and all public enterprises
        are inaugurated and ended by the same.</p>

        <p>Scene: a long room, wide enough for one cotillion and
        long enough for half a dozen; a raised platform for a
        first-class string-band, and a chair at the other end for
        <i>la maestra</i> (feminine) of ceremonies, with seats
        ranged against the wall for fifty or a hundred spectators.
        The Mexican girls are exceedingly graceful, with very small
        hands and feet and most enchanting voices; but their
        features are not handsome, being dark, in the first place,
        besides having an indescribable something which I imagine I
        can see in all dark races, and which, for want of a term, I
        call <i>dormant tigerishness</i>. As dancers they cannot be
        excelled. They never have the set "called," as in the
        States, dancing being too much a lifetime affair with them
        -- something they learn as soon as they can walk. Their
        cotillions are very complicated. The common waltz, about
        the same as ours, is known as the <i>Valse Redondo</i>. But
        the National dance -- the one which shows the Mexican women
        to the best advantage -- is the <i>Valse de Spachio</i>,
        which might be translated "slow waltz." The music is slow
        and seemingly mournful, but the elegant movement cannot be
        described. The first figure might be called a "waltzing
        cotillion," ending with two lines, each <i>senorita</i>
        opposite her partner. Thence she advances toward him with a
        score of graceful gestures -- bowing, sinking, rising,
        extending hands and again clasping them and retreating,
        waving scarf or handkerchief, and all in perfect time and
        without faulty or ungraceful motion. At length, and
        apparently following the motion of the "head lady," the
        couples come rapidly together, and, as the music breaks
        suddenly into a lively air, are whirled to all parts of the
        room in quick gallopade. This again subsides, and they
        waltz back into a sort of hollow square, from which each
        lady in turn issues and makes the circuit of the set in
        slow waltz, tantalizing different cavaliers with feint and
        retreat. It looks childish on paper, but is enchanting to
        witness.</p>

        <p>There seems to be no distinction at these public balls
        on the score of character. The social indifference on that
        subject would astonish most Americans. In the Stantons,
        Anthonys, etc., are really in earnest in the statement that
        "woman should have no worse stigma than a man for sexual
        sins," they would certainly be gratified here, for the
        disgrace is, at least, as great to one sex as the other.
        Indeed, I think the general judgment for marital
        unfaithfulness is much more severe on a man than on a
        woman. The young Americans bring their mistresses to the
        <i>baile</i> with the same indifference as the Mexicans do
        their sweethearts. These "girls" are scrupulously polite,
        and so unlike the same class in the States, that it can
        only be accounted for from the fact that they see no
        disgrace whatever in their mode of life, and feel so sort
        of social degradation.</p>

        <p>One witnesses no drunkenness, no obscene word or
        gesture, nothing to offend; and the uniform testimony of
        the American youths is, that they are the most faithful,
        kind and affectionate women of that class in the world.
        Without chastity, they still possess all the other
        distinctive virtues of the sex. The force of an improving
        public opinion has, in the last five years, caused many
        marriages between such couples . . .</p><br />

        <p>Twelve days I abode in Santa Fe, and my summing up is
        about like that of the sailor who had agreed to write to
        his friends of the manners and customs of the people he
        visited: when shipwrecked on the coast of Patagonia he
        wrote, "These people have no manners, and their customs are
        disgusting." No, I am wrong there: they have a surplus of
        manners; it is in morals there is a deficit. The Territory
        contains about eighty thousand native Mexicans, divisible
        into three classes: the <i>genta fina</i>, or noble bloods,
        of whom there are about fifteen families; the respectable
        middle classes, who may possibly amount to two thousand in
        all; and the "Greasers," who make up about ninety-five per
        cent. of the whole. Taking out fifteen families, it is my
        solemn conviction that the property of all the other
        Mexicans in the Territory will not average fifty dollars
        apiece. I thought, before this trip, that Utah was the
        poorest part of America; but the Mormons roll in wealth
        compared to the New Mexicans. As to morals, which is the
        worse, polygamy or promiscuous concubinage? That is a great
        moral question which I am not competent to decide. People
        who have lived among them many years confidently assert
        that there are some, in fact a number, of virtuous people
        among the natives. I hope it is so. Let us take it for
        granted, and dismiss the subject.</p><br />
