        <p>No apology is offered for presenting to the public the
        only authentic account of Brigham Young, of his polygamous
        family, and of that complicated and incongruous system of
        social and political machinery, called Mormonism.</p>

        <p>The only form of religion in this country which refuses
        to conform either to the spirit of progress and improvement
        and enlightened humanity which characterizes the age in
        which we live, or to our laws and the genius of our free
        institutions, -- drawing constantly from foreign countries
        hosts of votaries, impelled hither <i>not</i> by a love of
        republicanism, but rather by the desire to exchange a
        political for a religious monarchy, -- is Mormonism, which
        presents an antagonism to our Government, and can scarcely
        fail to result in national trouble.</p>

        <p>The elements of a second rebellion are in active
        progress in Utah, and, as in the case of the slavery
        rebellion, the great danger lies in failing to place a
        proper estimate upon the power of those elements for
        mischief, and to take the proper precautions in time.
        Religious fanaticism is more active, and, when hostile,
        more dangerous, than political ambition; hence the arrogant
        and intolerant spirit, and the bitter hostility of the
        Mormons, are more worthy the serious attention of our
        statesmen than would be the opposition of so many mere
        political traitors.</p>

        <p>Again; their power for mischief is much increased by the
        position they occupy upon the great thoroughfare between
        the eastern and western portions of our country.</p>

        <p>It is with the view of calling the attention of the
        Government and of the people of the country to the
        dangerous character of this monarchy growing up in the
        midst of the Republic, that the political history of Utah
        has been written.</p>

        <p>The chief interest of the work, however, with a large
        class of readers, will doubtless consist in the information
        it contains, relative to the family and social relations of
        the celebrated Mormon leader. These, and all other facts
        contained in this volume, may be relied upon as true, and
        many of them are now published for the first time.</p>

        <p>The subject of polygamy is treated thoroughly, and as
        dispassionately as the writer's utter abhorrence of the
        system will permit. A residence of two years in the midst
        of this state of society, could not fail to afford me a
        tolerably good view of its inside workings, and this view I
        have presented to my readers.</p>

        <p>Some of the facts narrated in this volume have been
        furnished by persons in Salt Lake, who are thoroughly
        conversant with them; in some cases, by persons who have
        long been in the service of Young, and known whereof they
        relate. While I am not at liberty to mention their names, I
        take this opportunity to return them my thanks for such
        valuable information.</p>

        <p>This book is believed to be a desideratum demanded by
        the social and political well-being of the country, and as
        such it is presented to the consideration of the people of
        this country, and especially to my own sex, who are deeply
        interested in preventing the framework of our social system
        from being broken up and superseded by the customs and
        maxims of the worst ages of barbarism.</p>

        <p>To the suffering women of Utah, I especially dedicate
        this result of my labors in their behalf; and I am not
        without hope that many of them may, upon a perusal of its
        pages, be induced to retrace their steps, and rescue
        themselves from the snares of the religious impostors now
        seeking their destruction.</p>
