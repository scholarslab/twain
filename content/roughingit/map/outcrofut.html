          BEAR RIVER CITY,
        </center>

        <p>Of early railroad days, but now entirely deserted. It is
        situated in a little valley at the mouth of a ravine, where
        the old overland stage road comes down from the north of
        Quaking Asp Mountain. At one time this place was quite
        populous, and was supposed likely to become a permanent
        town. At this point, the roughs and gamblers who had been
        driven from point to point westward, made a stand,
        congregating in large numbers. They swore that they would
        be driven no farther; that here they would stay, and fight
        it out to the bitter end. The town was about two miles to
        the eastward of the river, and when the roughs felt that
        trouble was coming on them, they withdrew to the hills and
        organized for a raid on the town. Meanwhile, some of the
        roughs remained in the town, and among them were three
        noted garroters, who had added to the long list of their
        crimes that of murder. The citizens arose, seized and hung
        them. In this act they were sustained by the law-abiding
        people, also by the <i>Index</i>, a paper which had
        followed the road, but was then published here. This
        hastened the conflict, and on the 19th of November, '68,
        the roughs attacked the town in force. This attack was
        repulsed by the citizens, though not until the</p>

        <p>Cost sixteen lives, including that of one citizen. The
        mob first attacked and burned the jail, taking thence one
        of their kind who was confined there. They next sacked the
        office, and destroyed the material of the <i>Frontier
        Index</i>. Elated with their success, the mob, numbering
        about 300 well-armed desperadoes, marched up the main
        street and made an attack on a store, belonging to one of
        the leading merchants. Here they were met with a volley
        from Henry rifles, in the hands of brave and determined
        citizens, about thirty in number. The first volley and the
        running fight left fifteen of the desperadoes dead on the
        street. The number of wounded was never ascertained, but
        several bodies were afterward found in the gulches and
        among the rocks, where they had crawled away and died. One
        citizen was slain in the attack on the jail. From this time
        forward the roughs gave Bear River City a wide
        berth.</p><br />

          CHEYENNE
        </center>

        <p>    <font size="-1">EARLY TIMES</font>--At one time
        Cheyenne had her share of the "roughs" and gambling hells,
        dance-houses, wild orgies; murders by night and day were
        rather the rule instead of the exception. This lasted until
        the business men and quiet citizens tired of such doings,
        and suddenly an impromptu vigilance committee appeared on
        the scene, and several of the most desperate characters
        were found swinging from the end of a rope, from some
        convenient elevation. Others taking the hint, which
        indicated they would take a rope unless they mended their
        ways, quietly left the city. At the present time, Cheyenne
        is an orderly and well-governed town.</p><br />
