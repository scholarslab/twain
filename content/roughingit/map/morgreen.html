      <td>You hear a good deal about that "cross" [of polygamy]
      from both Mormon husbands and wives, but you only see the
      shadow of it in the faces of the women. I do not mean to
      intimate that they all look decidedly unhappy. There is
      rather in their faces a quiet, baffling, negative, and
      abnegative expression, which certainly is as far from happy
      content as it is from desperate rebellion. Naturally, they
      are more alive to the outside pressure of public opinion,
      more sensitive to the obloquy and ostracism which their
      position provokes, than men. Patient and passive as they
      same, they feel these things keenly, -- the more intelligent
      among them, at least; and, though upheld by a sincere faith
      in this strange delusion, they have toward strangers a
      peculiar air of reticence and mistrust, almost of repulsion.
      I do not wonder at it: their hospitality and confidence have
      often been abused; they have been intruded upon by
      impertinent interviewers, and their reluctant answers to
      persistent questioning published abroad, with startling
      additions and dramatic embellishments. Those I have met
      appear to me, I must say, like good and gentle Christian
      women. They are singularly simple in dress and modest in
      demeanor. What saddens me is their air of extreme quietude,
      retirement, and repression. But for the children around them,
      you would think some of them were women who had done with
      this world. I am told that the wives of even the highest
      Mormon dignitaries show little pride in their lords. It were,
      perhaps, difficult to feel much pride in the sixteenth part
      of a man, as men go. Even the first wife of a wealthy saint
      betrays in her husband and household, they say, no exultant
      joy of possession. An investment in a Mormon heart and home
      must be rather uncertain stock for a woman. I am assured that
      the second wife is seldom taken without the consent of the
      first. Not only are the poor woman's religious faith and zeal
      appealed to, but her magnanimity toward her sister-woman out
      in the cold. It must be through great suffering that such
      heights of self-abnegation are reached. The crucifixion of
      the divine weakness of a loving woman's heart must be a
      severe process. But there is some sorry comfort in the
      thought that for these poor polygamous wives there is no
      wearing uncertainty, no feverish anxiety; that they are
      spared the bitterest pain of jealousy, the vague nightmare
      torture of suspicion, the grief and horror of the final
      discovery, the fierce sense of treachery and deception. They
      know they worst. Perhaps it is this "dead certainty" that
      gives them the peculiar, cold, still look I have referred to.
      As to the Mormon men whom I have met, mostly leaders in the
      church, and prominent, well-to-do citizens, I must say that
      they look remarkably care-free and even jolly, under the
      cross. Virgil, I believe, has somewhere the expression, "O
      three times and four times happy!" Well, that is the way they
      look.<br />
