        <b>[From] Chapter VII. A Night in a Frontier
        Town.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>  Sheridan compared very favorably with other plains
        towns. It contained a population of one hundred and fifty
        souls, and from accounts all were desperate characters.
        After the suspension of work on the railroad, the
        population, which at one time was much larger, suddenly
        diminished. Frequently the citizens were put to great
        straits to secure a maintenance. Many lived by poisoning
        wolves and selling the skins, for which they realized a
        dollar, or a dollar and a half, each, according to size. It
        was hardly the proper season for this work, although
        parties were engaged in it, and found no difficulty in
        disposing of their stock. I was told by one person that in
        the winter he could make from seventy-five to a hundred and
        fifty dollars per month out of the wolf skins he could
        secure. The wolf family is rather large on the plains, and
        a liberal application of strychnine evidently would not be
        seriously felt for some time to come.</p>

        <p>  Ten o'clock in the evening I discovered was the
        regular hour for the public entertainments to begin, which
        consisted of a skirmish with pistols, or a series of
        pugilistic encounters, in which it rarely happened that
        both parties come off with their lives, or at least without
        receiving a damaging and indelible remembrance of the
        contest. I had already heard fearful stories of the "quiet
        and orderly" town of Sheridan, and, as much as possible,
        kept clear of the streets from fear of some stray pistol
        ball, by mistake, finding a lodgment in my own person.</p>

        <p>  The week before, the Sheridanites, according to their
        own accounts, had had "a beautiful time." During that week
        six men had been shot in drunken brawls. On the Sabbath
        night the honor of two more specimens was brought into
        antagonism over the flowing bowl. Pistols were produced,
        and the "popular tragedy" opened. One was mortally wounded.
        The other set out with a view to escape. He was closely
        pursued. The pursuers fired repeatedly, which was responded
        to by the fugitive. After a lively chase and considerable
        firing the pursued was overtaken. He fought desperately,
        but without avail. A rope was procured; one end was
        fastened around the victim's neck, the other to a cross-tie
        in the tressel railroad bridge at the town. The victim was
        then forcibly ejected between the ties into space below,
        and was there left to shuffle off this mortal coil; which
        was more readily done than to shuffle off the coil which
        had been prepared for him by his peculiarly justice-loving
        fellow-citizens.</p><br />
