        <p>The loose, lazy spirit of the occasion finally took
        possession of me, and I sat and gazed and smoked, and it is
        possible that I might have fallen into a Rip Van Winkle
        sleep to have been aroused ten years hence by the cry,
        "Passengers for the flying machine to New York, all
        aboard!" when I and the drowsing city were roused into life
        by the clatter and crash of the hoofs of a horse which
        dashed furiously across the square and down the street. The
        rider sat perfectly erect, yet following with a grace of
        motion seen only in the horsemen of the plains, the rise
        and fall of the galloping steed. There was only a moment to
        observe this, for they halted suddenly, while the rider
        springing to the ground approached the party which the
        noise had gathered near me.</p>

        <p>"This yere is Wild Bill, Colonel," said Captain Honesty,
        an army officer addressing me. He continued:</p>

        <p>"How are yer, Bill? This yere is Colonel N----, who
        wants ter know yer."</p>

        <p>Let me at once describe the personal appearance of the
        famous Scout of the Plains, William Hitchcock, called "Wild
        Bill," who now advanced toward me, fixing his clear gray
        eyes on mine in a quick, interrogative way, as if to take
        "my measure."</p>

        <p>The result seemed favorable, for he held forth a small,
        muscular hand in a frank, open manner. As I looked at him I
        thought his the handsomest physique I had ever seen. In its
        exquisite manly proportions it recalled the antique. It was
        a figure Ward would delight to model as a companion to his
        "Indian."</p>

        <p>Bill stood six feet and an inch in his bright yellow
        moccasins. A deer-skin shirt, or frock it might be called,
        hung jauntily over his shoulders and revealed a chest whose
        breadth and depth were remarkable. These lungs had had
        growth in some twenty years of the free air of the Rocky
        Mountains. His small, round waist was girthed by a belt
        which held two of Colt's navy revolvers. His legs sloped
        gradually from the compact thigh to the feet, which were
        small and turned inward as he walked. There was a singular
        grace and dignity of carriage about that figure which would
        have called your attention meet it where you would. The
        head which crowned it was now covered by a large sombrero,
        underneath which there shone out a quiet, manly face; so
        gentle is its expression as he greets you as utterly to
        belie the history of its owner; yet it is not a face to be
        trifled with. The lips thin and sensitive, the jaw not too
        square, the cheek bones slightly prominent, a mass of fine
        dark hair falls below the neck to the shoulders. The eyes,
        now that you are in friendly intercourse, are as gentle as
        a woman's. In truth, the woman nature seems prominent
        throughout, and you would not believe that you were looking
        into eyes that have pointed the way to death to hundreds of
        men. Yes, Wild Bill with his own hands has killed hundreds
        of men. Of that I have not a doubt. "He shoots to kill,"
        they say on the border.</p>

        <p>In vain did I examine the scout's face for some evidence
        of murderous propensity. It was a gentle face, and singular
        only in the sharp angle of the eye, and without any
        physiognomical reason for the opinion, I have thought his
        wonderful accuracy of aim was indicated by this
        peculiarity. He told me, however, to use his own words:</p>

        <p>"I allers shot well; but I come ter be perfect in the
        mountains by shootin at a dime for a mark, at best of half
        a dollar a shot. And then until the war I never drank
        liquor nor smoked," he continued, with a melancholy
        expression; "war is demoralizing it is."</p>

        <p>Captain Honesty was right. I was very curious to see
        "Wild Bill, the Scout," who, a few days before my arrival
        in Springfield, in a duel at noonday in the public square,
        at fifty paces, had sent one of Colt's pistol-balls through
        the heart of a returned Confederate soldier. . .
        .</p><br />
        <br />

        <p>"To tell you the truth, Kernel," responded the scout
        with a certain solemnity in his grave face, "I don't talk
        about sich things ter the people round here, but I allers
        feel sort of thankful when I get out of a bad scrape."</p>

        <p>"In all your wild, perilous adventures," I asked him,
        "have you ever been afraid? Do you know what the sensation
        is? I am sure you will not misunderstand the question, for
        I take it we soldiers comprehend justly that there is no
        higher courage than that which shows itself when the
        consciousness of danger is keen but where moral strength
        overcomes the weakness of the body."</p>

        <p>"I think I know what you mean, Sir, and I'm not ashamed
        to say that I have been so frightened that it 'peared is if
        all the strength and blood had gone out of my body, and my
        face was as white as chalk. It was at the Wilme Creek
        fight. I had fired more than fifty cartridges, and I think
        fetched my man every time. I was on the skirmish line, and
        was working up closer to the rebs, when all of a sudden a
        battery opened fire right in front of me, and it sounded as
        if forty thousand guns were firing, and every shot and
        shell screeched within six inches of my head. It was the
        first time I was ever under artillery fire, and I was so
        frightened that I couldn't move for a minute or so, and
        when I did go back the boys asked me if I had seen a ghost?
        They may shoot bullets at me by the dozen, and it's rather
        exciting if I can shoot back, but I am always sort of
        nervous when the big guns go off."</p>

        <p>"I would like to see you shoot."</p>

        <p>"Would yer?" replied the scout, drawing his revolver;
        and approaching the window, he pointed to a letter O in a
        sign-board which was fixed to the stone-wall of a building
        on the other side of the way.</p>

        <p>"That sign is more than fifty yards away. I will put
        these six balls into the inside of the circle, which isn't
        bigger than a man's heart."</p>

        <p>In an off-hand way, and without sighting the pistol with
        his eye, he discharged the six shots of his revolver. I
        afterwards saw that all the bullets had entered the
        circle.</p>

        <p>As Bill proceeded to reload his pistol, he said to me
        with a naivete of manner which was meant to be
        assuring:</p>

        <p>"Whenever you get into a row be sure and not shoot too
        quick. Take time. I've known many a feller slip up for
        shootin' in a hurry,"</p>

        <p>It would be easy to fill a volume with the adventures of
        that remarkable man. My object here has been to make a
        slight record of one who is one of the best--perhaps the
        very best--example of a class who more than any other
        encountered perils and privations in defense of our
        nationality.</p>

        <p>One afternoon as General Smith and I mounted our horses
        to start upon our journey toward the East, Wild Bill came
        to shake hands good-by, and I said to him:</p>

        <p>"If you have no objection I will write out for
        publication an account of a few of your adventures."</p>

        <p>"Certainly you may," he replied. "I'm sort of public
        property. But, Kernel," he continued, leaning upon my
        saddle bow, while there was a tremulous softness in his
        voice and a strange moisture in his averted eyes, "I have a
        mother back there in Illinois who is old and feeble. I
        haven't seen her this many a year, and haven't been a good
        son to her, yet I love her better than any thing in this
        life. It don't matter much what they say about me here. But
        I'm not a cut-throat and vagabond, and I'd like the old
        woman to know what'll make her proud. I'd like her to hear
        that her runaway boy has fought through the war for the
        Union like a true man."</p>

        <p>[William Hitchcock--called Wild Bill, the Scout of the
        Plains--shall have his wish. I have told his story
        precisely as it was told to me, confirmed in all important
        points by many witnesses; and I have no doubt of its
        truth.--G. W. N.]</p>
