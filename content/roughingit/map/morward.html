        <p>It is now goin on 2 (too) yeres, as I very well,
        remember, since I crossed the Planes for Kaliforny, the
        Brite land of Jold. While crossin the Planes all so bold I
        fell in with sum noble red men of the forest (N. B. This is
        rote Sarcasticul. Injins is Pizin, whar ever found,) which
        thay Sed I was their Brother, &amp; wantid for to smoke the
        Calomel of Peace with me. Thay then stole my jerkt beef,
        blankits, etsettery, skalpt my orgin grinder &amp; scooted
        with a Wild Hoop. Durin the Cheaf's techin speech he sed he
        shood meet me in the Happy Huntin Grounds. If he duz thare
        will be a fite. But enuff of this ere. <i>Reven Noose
        Muttons</i>, as our skoolmaster, who has got Talent into
        him, cussy-cally obsarve.</p>

        <p>I arrove at Salt Lake in doo time. At Camp Scott there
        was a lot of U. S. sojers, hosstensibly sent out thare to
        smash the mormons but really to eat Salt vittles &amp; play
        poker &amp; other beautiful but sumwhat onsartin games. I
        got acquainted with sum of the officers. Thay lookt putty
        scrumpshus in their Bloo coats with brass buttings onto um
        &amp; ware very talented drinkers, but so fur as fitin is
        consarned I'd willingly put my wax figgers agin the hull
        party.</p>

        <p>My desire was to exhibit my grate show in Salt Lake
        City, so I called on Brigham Yung, the grate mogull amung
        the mormins, and axed his permishun to pitch my tent and
        onfurl my banner to the jentle breezis. He lookt at me in a
        austeer manner for a few minits, and sed:</p>

        <p>"Do you bleeve in Soloman, Saint Paul, the
        immaculateness of the Mormin Church and the Latter-day
        Revelashuns?"</p>

        <p>Sez I, "I'm on it!" I make it a pint to git along
        plesunt, tho I didn't know what under the Son the old
        feller was drivin at. He sed I mit show.</p>

        <p>"You air a marrid man, Mister Yung, I bleeve?" sez I,
        preparin to rite him sum free parsis.</p>

        <p>"I hev eighty wives, Mister Ward. I sertinly am
        marrid."</p>

        <p>"How do you like it as far as you hev got?" sed I.</p>

        <p>He sed "middlin," and axed me wouldn't I like to see his
        famerly, to which I replide that I wouldn't mind minglin
        with the fair Seck &amp; Barskin in the winnin smiles of
        his interestin wives. He accordingly tuk me to his Scareum.
        The house is powerful big &amp; in a exceedin large room
        was his wives &amp; children, which larst was squawkin and
        hollerin enuff to take the roof rite orf the house. The
        wimin was of all sizes and ages. Sum was pretty &amp; sum
        was plane -- sum was helthy and sum was on the Wayne --
        which is verses, tho sich was not my intentions, as I don't
        'prove of putting verses in Proze rittins, tho ef occashun
        requires I can Jerk a Poim ekal to any of them Atlantic
        Munthly fellers.</p>

        <p>"My wives, Mister Ward," sed Yung.</p>

        <p>"Your sarvant, marms," sed I, as I sot down in a cheer
        which a red-heded female brawt me.</p>

        <p>"Besides these wives you see here, Mister Ward," sed
        Yung, "I hav eighty more in varis parts of this consecrated
        land which air Sealed to me."</p>

        <p>"Which?" sez I, gittin up &amp; starin at him.</p>

        <p>"Sealed, Sir! sealed."</p>

        <p>"Whare bowts?" sez I.</p>

        <p>"I sed, Sir, that they was sealed!" He spoke in a
        traggerdy voice.</p>

        <p>"Will they probly continner on in that stile to any
        grate extent, Sir?" I axed.</p>

        <p>"Sir," sed he furnin as red as a biled beet, "don't you
        know that the rules of our Church is that I, the Profit,
        may hev as meny wives as I wants?"</p>

        <p>"Jes so," I sed. "You are old pie, ain't you?"</p>

        <p>"Them as is Sealed to me -- that is to say, to be mine
        when I wants um -- air at present my sperret-ooul wives,"
        sed Mister Yung.</p>

        <p>"Long may they wave!" sez I, seein I shood git into a
        scrape ef I didn't look out.</p>

        <p>In a privit conversashun with Brigham I learnt the
        follerin fax: It takes him six weeks to kiss his wives. He
        don't do it only onct a yere &amp; sez it is wuss nor
        cleanin house. He don't pretend to know his children, thare
        is so many of um, tho they all know him. He sez about every
        child he meats call him Par, &amp; he takes it for grantid
        it is so. His wives air very expensiv. Thay allers want
        suthin &amp; ef he don't buy it for um thay set the house
        in a uproar. He sez he don't have a minit's peace. His
        wives fite amung theirselves so much that he has bilt a
        fitin room for thare speshul benefit, &amp; when too of 'em
        get into a row he has em turnd loose into that place, whare
        the dispoot is settled accordin to the rules of the London
        prize ring. Sumtimes thay abooz hisself individooally. They
        hev pulled the most of his hair out at the roots &amp; he
        wares meny a horrible scar upon his body, inflicted with
        mop-handles, broom-sticks and sich. Occashunly they git mad
        &amp; scald him with bilin hot water. When he get eny waze
        cranky thay'd shut him up in a dark closit, previsly
        whippin him arter the stile of muthers when thare
        orfsprings git onruly. Sum-times when he went in swimmin
        thay'd go to the banks of the Lake &amp; steal all his
        close, thereby com-pellin him to sneek home by a sircootius
        rowt, drest in the Skanderlus stile of the Greek Slaiv. "I
        find that the keers of a marrid life way hevy onto me," sed
        the Profit, "&amp; sumtimes I wish I'd remaned singel." I
        left the Profit and startid for the tavern whare I put up
        to. On my way I was overtuk by a lurge krowd of Mormons,
        which they surroundid me &amp; statid that they were goin
        into the Show free.</p>

        <p>"Wall," sez I, "ef I find a individooal who is goin
        round lettin folks into his show free, I'll let you
        know."</p>

        <p>"We've had a Revelashun biddin us go into A. Ward's Show
        without payin nothin!" thay showtid.</p>

        <p>"Yes," hollered a lot of femaile Mormonesses, ceasin me
        by the cote tales &amp; swingin me round very rapid, "we're
        all going in free! So sez the Revelashun!"</p>

        <p>"What's Old Revelashun got to do with my Show?" sez I,
        gittin putty rily. "Tell Mister Revelashun," sed I, drawin
        myself up to my full hite and lookin round upon the ornery
        krowd with a prowd &amp; defiant mean," tell Mister
        Revelahsun to mind his own bizness, subject only to the
        Konstitushun of the United States!"</p>

        <p>"Oh now let us in, that's a sweet man," sed several
        famails, puttin thare arms rownd me in luvin stile. "Becum
        1 of us. Becum a Preest &amp; have wives Sealed to
        you."</p>

        <p>"Not a Seal!" sez I, startin back in horror at the
        idee.</p>

        </center>

        <p>"Oh stay, Sir, stay," sed a tall, gawnt femaile, ore
        whoos hed 37 summirs must hev parsd, "stay, &amp; I'll be
        your Jentle Gazelle."</p>

        <p>"Not ef I know it, you won't," sez I. "Awa you
        skanderlus famaile, awa! Go &amp; be a Nunnery!" That's
        what I sez, jes so.</p>

        <p>"&amp; I," sed a fat chunky femaile, who must hev wade
        more than too hundred lbs., "I will be your sweet gidin
        Star!"</p>

        <p>Sez I, "Ile bet two dollers and a half you won't!" Whare
        ear I may Rome Ile still be troo 2 thee, Oh Betsy Jane! [N.
        B. Betsy Jane is my wife's Sir naime.]</p>

        <p>"Whiltist thou not tarry hear in the Promist Land?" sed
        several of the miserabil critters.</p>

        <p>"Ile see you all essenshally cussed be 4 I wiltists!"
        roared I, as mad as I cood be at thare infernul non-cents.
        I girded up my Lions and fled the Seen. I packt up my duds
        &amp; left Salt Lake, which is a 2nd Soddum &amp;
        Germorrer, inhabitid by as theavin &amp; onpriniopled a set
        of retchis as ever drew Breth in eny spot on the Globe.</p>
