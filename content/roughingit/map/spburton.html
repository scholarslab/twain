        <p>A pass it is not: it has none of the features of
        Thermopyl&aelig; or the Gorge of Killiecrankie; of the
        European St. Bernard or Simplon; of the Alleghany Passes or
        of the Mexican <i>Barrancas</i>. It is not, as it sounds, a
        ghaut between lofty mountains, or, as the traveler may
        expect, a giant gateway, opening through Cyclopean walls of
        beetling rocks that rise in forbidding grandeur as he
        passes onward to the Western continent. And yet the word
        "Pass" has its significancy. In that New World where Nature
        has worked upon the largest scale, where every feature of
        scenery, river and lake, swamp and forest, prairie and
        mountain, dwarf their congeners in the old hemisphere, this
        majestic level-topped bluff, the highest steppe of the
        continent, upon whose iron surface there is space enough
        for the armies of the globe to march over, is the grandest
        and the most appropriate of avenues.</p>

        <p>A water-shed is always exciting to the traveler. What
        shall I say of this, where, on the topmost point of
        American travel, you drink within a hundred yards of the
        waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans--that divides
        the "doorways of the west wind" from the "portals of the
        sunrise"? On the other side of yon throne of storms, within
        sight, did not the Sierra interpose, lie separated by a
        trivial space the fountain-heads that give birth to the
        noblest rivers of the continent, the Columbia, the
        Colorado, and the Yellow Stone, which is to the Missouri
        what the Missouri is to the Mississippi, whence the waters
        trend to four opposite directions: the Wind River to the
        northeast; to the southeast the Sweetwater and the Platte;
        the various branches of the Snake River to the northeast;
        and to the southwest the Green River, that finds its way
        into the Californian Gulf.<font size="+1"><b><a href=
        "javascript:Start('spburtnot.html')">*</a></b></font> It is
        a suggestive spot, this "divortia aquarum": it compels
        Memory to revive past scenes before plunging into the
        mysterious "Lands of the Hereafter," which lie before and
        beneath the feet. The Great Ferry, which steam has now
        bridged, the palisaded banks of the Hudson, the soft and
        sunny scenery of the Ohio, and the kingly course of the
        Upper Mississippi, the terrible beauty of Niagara, and the
        marvels of that chain of inland seas which winds its water
        way from Ontario to Superior; the rich pasture-lands of the
        North, the plantations of the semi-tropical South, and the
        broad cornfields of the West; finally, the vast meadow-land
        and the gloomy desert-waste of sage and saleratus, of clay
        and <i>mauvaise terre</i>, of red <i>butte</i> and tawny
        rock, all pass before the mind in rapid array ere they are
        thrust into oblivion by the excitement of a new
        departure.</p>

        <p>But we have not yet reached our destination, which is
        two miles below the South Pass. Pacific Springs is our
        station; it lies a little down the hill, and we can sight
        it from the road. The springs are a pond of pure, hard, and
        very cold water, surrounded by a strip of shaking bog,
        which must be boarded over before it will bear a man. The
        hut would be a right melancholy abode were it not for the
        wooded ground on one hand, and the glorious snow-peaks on
        the other side of the "Pass." We reached Pacific Springs at
        3 P.M., and dined without delay, the material being bouilli
        and potatoes--unusual luxuries. About an hour afterward the
        west wind, here almost invariable, brought up a shower of
        rain, and swept a vast veil over the forms of the
        Wind-River Mountains. Toward sunset it cleared away, and
        the departing luminary poured a flood of gold upon the
        majestic pile--; I have seldom seen a view more
        beautiful.</p>

        <p>From the south, the barren rolling table-land that forms
        the Pass trends northward till it sinks apparently below a
        ridge of offsets from the main body, black with
        timber--cedar, cypress, fir, and balsam pine. The hand of
        Nature has marked, as though by line and level, the place
        where vegetation shall go and no farther. Below the waist
        the mountains are robed in evergreens; above it, to the
        shoulders, they would be entirely bare but for the
        atmosphere, which has thrown a thin veil of light blue over
        their tawny gray, while their majestic heads are covered
        with ice and snow, or are hidden from sight by
        thunder-cloud or the morning mist. From the south, on clear
        days, the cold and glittering radiance may be seen at a
        distance of a hundred miles. The monarch of these mountains
        is "Fr&eacute;mont's Peak"; its height is laid down at 13,
        570 feet above sea level; and second to it is a hoary cone
        called by the station-people Snowy Peak.</p>
