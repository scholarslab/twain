        <p>  It was impossible for a passing visitor to tell how
        the Americans and Mexicans [in Trinidad] managed to get on
        together. There appeared to be every prospect of peace at
        the time I was there, but before the autumn had far
        advanced, a very different state of things seems to have
        arisen. As far as I could make out from the reports which
        reached me at San Francisco, one of the Americans had shot
        a very popular man amongst the Mexicans in a midnight
        brawl, and as the friends of the former refused to give him
        up, the Mexicans united in a body of five hundred strong,
        and attacked the place. The Americans were so greatly in
        the minority, that they were obliged to take refuge in
        their houses, and sustain a siege for nearly a fortnight,
        during which time some seven Mexicans were shot by the
        defenders. As military assistance did not arrive, and
        provisions at last began to fail, the Anglo-Saxons had to
        surrender, but under what conditions I could not discover.
        When the soldiers at last arrived, the war was over, and
        the little population had returned in peace to their former
        occupations.</p><br />
