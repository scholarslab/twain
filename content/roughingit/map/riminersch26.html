        <p>B<font size="-1">Y</font> and by I was smitten with the
        silver fever. "Prospecting parties" were leaving for the
        mountains every day, and discovering and taking possesion
        of rich silver-bearing lodes and ledges of quartz. Plainly
        this was the road to fortune. The great "Gould and Curry"
        mine was held at three or four hundred dollars a foot when
        we arrived; but in two months it had sprung up to eight
        hundred. The "Ophir" had been worth only a mere trifle, a
        year gone by, and now it was selling at nearly <i>four
        thousand dollars a foot</i>! Not a mine could be named that
        had not experienced an astonishing advance in value within
        a short time. Everybody was talking about these marvels. Go
        where you would, you heard nothing else, from morning till
        far into the night. Tom So-and-So had sold out of the
        'Amanda Smith" for $40,000--hadn't a cent when he "took up"
        the ledge six months ago. John Jones had sold half his
        interest in the "Bald Eagle and Mary Ann" for $65,000, gold
        coin, and gone to the States for his family. The widow
        Brewster had "struck it rich" in the "Golden Fleece" and
        sold ten feet for $18,000--hadn't money enough to buy a
        crape bonnet when Sing-Sing Tommy killed her husband at
        Baldy Johnson's wake last spring. The "Last Chance" had
        found a "clay casing" and knew they were "right on the
        ledge"--consequence, "feet" that went begging yesterday
        were worth a brick house apiece to-day, and seedy owners
        who could not get trusted for a drink at any bar in the
        country yesterday were roaring drunk on champagne to-day
        and had hosts of warm personal friends in a town where they
        had forgotten how to bow or shake hands from long-continued
        want of practice. Johnny Morgan, a common loafer, had gone
        to sleep in the gutter and waked up worth a hundred
        thousand dollars, in consequence of the decision in the
        "Lady Franklin and Rough and Ready" lawsuit. And so on--day
        in and day out the talk pelted our ears and the excitement
        waxed hotter and hotter around us.</p>

        been more or less than human if I had not gone mad like the
        rest. Cart-loads of solid silver bricks, as large as pigs
        of lead, were arriving from the mills every day, and such
        sights as that gave substance to the wild talk about me. I
        succumbed and grew as frenzied as the craziest.</p><br />
