      buffalo hunter and scout when Edward Zane Carroll Judson
      (much better known as the "dime novelist" Ned Buntline) went
      west seeking new inspiration for his prolific imagination and
      was introduced to him at Fort McPherson, Nebraska. The
      encounter resulted in Buntline's story, "Buffalo Bill, The
      King of the Border Men," published in</i> The New York Weekly

        novels about Buffalo Bill. Its popularity also soon led to
        a play, by Fred G. Maeder, first produced at Niblo's Garden
        in New York in early 1872.</i><br />

      <td>J. B. Studley played his part [Buffalo Bill] to
      perfection. The laudable desire he exhibits to avenge the
      murder of his paternal ancestor and the coolness he displays
      when encompassed by dangers and difficulties is superb.
      Rounds of applause greeted him when, finding himself
      surrounded by Indians, he slipped like a snake into a hollow
      log; which log the redskins presently added as fuel to the
      campfire; but the trapper soon found it grew uncomfortably
      hot, so he threw his powder horn into the fire. There was a
      grand explosion and the Indians went yelling skyward, while
      the hero escaped unscathed.<br />
      <br />
      This, as might be expected, was warmly applauded by the
      "gods," but the highest pitch of excitement was reached in
      the third act when Jack McKandkess, a noted border ruffian,
      meets Buffalo Bill and a terrific hand-to-hand combat with
      Bowie knives three feet long ensues. The audience were
      spellbound, breathless, during this fierce encounter; but
      when it was brought to a conclusion by the death of the
      villain and the victory of Buffalo Bill, the burst of
      enthusiasm that followed would have rivaled the roar of
      Niagara.<br /></td>

        <i>Bill himself saw the play during a six-week visit to New
        York, when he was treated as a celebrity by the media. That
        experience and Buntline's encouragement in turn gave him
        the idea of starring as himself in a highly dramatized
        version of his life on the frontier. Also starring Ned
        Buntline and "Texas Jack" Omohondro, one of Bill's
        fellow-scouts from the West, the show opened to a sold-out
        house in Chicago on 16 December 1872:<br />

      extraordinary character and one in which the audience bore
      quite as prominent a feature as did the occupants of the

      Buntline's play with the blood-curdling and hair-raising
      title of <i>The Scouts of the Prairie; or Red Deviltry As It
      Is</i>, being a descriptive affair of life on the plains and
      in the mountains of the West, and in which the noted
      characters "Buffalo Bill" and "Texas Jack" in their own
      original selves were presented, as well as "Ned Buntline" the
      author of the play. Last night not less than 2,500 boys and
      young men crowded the amphitheatre to catch a glimpse of
      their heroes. Mlle. Morlacchi, the Italian danseuse, essayed
      the part of the Indian maiden Dove Eye with great
