          <b>A REMONSTRANCE FROM THE CHINESE IN CALIFORNIA<br />
          TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES.</b>
        </center>

        <p>The sincere and gracious attention of your honorable
        body is earnestly requested to the consideration of certain
        matters important to our peace as foreigners, the following
        statements of which may be relied upon as certainly true
        and correct:</p>

        <p>We are natives of the empire of China, each following
        some employment or profession--literary men, farmers,
        mechanics or merchants. When your honorable government
        threw open the territory of California, the people of other
        lands were welcomed here to search for gold and to engage
        in trade. The ship-masters of your respected nation came
        over to our country, lauded the equality of your laws,
        extolled the beauty of your manners and customs, and made
        it known that your officers and people were extremely
        cordial toward the Chinese. Knowing well the harmony which
        had existed between our respective governments, we trusted
        in your sincerity. Not deterred by the long voyage, we came
        here presuming that our arrival would be hailed with
        cordiality and favor. But, alas! what times are
        these!--when former kind relations are forgotten, when we
        Chinese are viewed like thieves and enemies, when in the
        administration of justice our testimony is not received,
        when in the legal collection of the licenses we are injured
        and plundered, and villains of other nations are encouraged
        to rob and do violence to us! Our numberless wrongs it is
        most painful even to recite. At the present time, if we
        desire to quit the country, we are not possessed of the
        pecuniary means; if allowed to remain, we dread future
        troubles. But yet, on the other hand, it is our presumption
        that the conduct of the officers of justice here has been
        influenced by temporary prejudices and that your honorable
        government will surely not uphold their acts. We are
        sustained by the confidence that the benevolence of your
        eminent body, contemplating the people of the whole world
        as one family, will most assuredly not permit the Chinese
        population without guilt to endure injuries to so cruel a
        degree. We would therefore present the following twelve
        subjects for consideration at your bar. We earnestly pray
        that you would investigate and weigh them; that you would
        issue instructions to your authorities in each State that
        they shall cast away their partial and unjust practices,
        restore tranquillity to us strangers, and that you would
        determine whether we are to leave the country or to remain.
        Then we will endure ensuing calamities without repining,
        and will cherish for you sincere gratitude and most
        profound respect.</p>

        <p>The twelve subjects, we would state with great respect,
        are as follows:</p>

        <center>
          <b>1. <i>The unrighteousness of humiliating and
          hating<br />
          the Chinese as a people.</i></b>
        </center>

        <p>We have heard that your honorable nation reverences
        Heaven. But if they comprehend the reverence that is due to
        the heavenly powers, of necessity they cannot humiliate and
        hate the Chinese. Why do we aver this? At the very
        beginning of time, Heaven produced a most holy man, whose
        name was Pwan-ku. He was the progenitor of the people of
        China. All succeeding races have branched off from them.
        The central part of the earth is styled by its inhabitants
        the Middle Flowery Kingdom. That is the country of the
        Chinese. The regions occupied by later races are
        distributed round and subordinate to it. Heaven causes it
        to produce in the greatest variety and abundance, so that
        of all under the sky this country is the greatest, and has
        bestowed upon it perfect harmony with the powers of nature,
        so that all things there attain the highest perfection.
        Hence we see that Heaven most loves our Chinese people, and
        multiplies its gifts to them beyond any other race.</p>

        <p>From the time of Pwan-ku till the present, a period of
        many tens of thousand of years, there have been born among
        us a host of sages, such as Fu-hi, Shin-nung, Hwaug-ti,
        Yau, Shun, Yu, Pang, Wan, Wu and Chaukung. Gifted by
        Heaven, they attained consummate excellence. Their
        beneficent influence extended not alone around them, it
        shed peace upon all nations. In the days of Yau our people
        were styled the Tang, which has been a favorite designation
        of themselves until now. After some centuries, Heaven again
        produced a sage preeminent and alone in his excellence,
        whose name was Confucius, whom it made the great teacher of
        China. He combined what was greatest and best in all that
        preceded him, and became the teacher and exemplar of all
        ages. As to things on high, he showed men the fear of
        Heaven; as to things on earth, he taught them virtue. The
        sages of whom we have spoken had the wisdom to discern that
        all men on earth are one family. Now what is meant in
        styling all men on earth one family? It is, that the people
        of China, or of countries foreign to it, are all embraced,
        as it were, in one great circle of kindred, with its
        parents and children, its elder and younger branches, its
        bonds of unity; the pervading principle, love; no one
        member debased, none treated with dislike. Again, after
        several centuries, Heaven brought forth one Jesus, and
        ordained him to be a teacher to foreign lands. Now Jesus
        also taught mankind the fear of Heaven. He showed that the
        chief end is to pray for eternal life. He comprehended the
        reverence due to Heaven, and the obligations of virtue. He
        was in accord with the holy men of China. He looked on all
        beneath the sky as one great family. He did not permit
        distinctions of men into classes to be loved or despised.
        But now, if the religion of Jesus really teaches the fear
        of Heaven, how does it come that the people of your
        honorable country on the contrary trample upon and hate the
        race which Heaven most loves, that is, the Chinese? Should
        this not be called rebellion against Heaven? And how is it
        possible to receive this as of the religion of Heaven?</p>

        <center>
          <b>2. <i>An appeal to the principle which lies at the
          foundation<br />
          of Chinese government and society.</i></b>
        </center>

        <p>The wise men of China plant at the very foundation of
        government the idea of virtue, not that of physical power,
        just as do those professing the religion of Jesus Christ.
        Virtue is that which commands the intuitive submission of
        the human will. Great vessels of war and powerful artillery
        may destroy cities and devastate a country. That is
        physical power. But moral power is essentially different
        from mechanical power. The noblest illustration of moral
        power is the teacher at the head of his school--as much so
        as the locomotive and the telegraph are of mechanical
        skill. It is the spirit of man that deserves respect, not
        his form. If the spirit be noble and good, although the man
        be poor and humble, his features homely and his apparel
        mean, we honor him and love him. If the spirit be not so,
        though the man have wealth and position, though his
        countenance be beautiful and his clothing rich, we regard
        him with contempt and dislike. But we do affirm that the
        reason why the people of your honorable country dislike the
        Chinese is this, and no other--they look at the plain
        appearance and the patched clothes of their poor, and they
        do not think how many spirits there are among them whom
        they could respect and love.</p>

        <center>
          <b>3. <i>A brief statement of the manner in which our
          Chinese government<br />
          acts toward foreigners.</i></b>
        </center>

        <p>China possesses a mutual trade with all foreign lands.
        When a man from another country arrives in China, none of
        our officers and common people treat him otherwise than
        with respect and kindness. In case he be defrauded or
        injured, where it is a small matter the offender is fined
        or punished corporeally; in a graver one he forfeits his
        life. Even though there be no witnesses, still the local
        officers must thoroughly inquire into the circumstances. In
        murders and brawls, if the criminal be not discovered the
        magistrate is called to account and degraded from his
        office. When a foreigner commits a deed of violence against
        a Chinese, a spirit of great leniency and care is
        manifested in the judgment of the case. Not because there
        is not power to punish. But we sincerely dread to mar the
        beautiful idea of gentleness and benignity toward the
        stranger from afar.</p>

        <p>Now why is it that, when our people come to your
        country, instead of being welcomed with unusual respect and
        kindness, on the contrary they are treated with unusual
        contempt and evil? Hence many lose their lives at the hands
        of lawless wretches. Yet though there be Chinese witnesses
        of the crime, their testimony is rejected. The result is
        our utter abandonment to be murdered and that of our
        business to be ruined. How hard for the spirit to sustain
        such trials! It is true some persons reply that the Chinese
        who come here are of no advantage to the country. Yet if a
        calculation be made only of the amount of licenses we pay,
        the value of our trade, the revenue to steamers, stage
        companies and other interests, amounting to several
        millions of dollars per annum, can it be affirmed that we
        are of no advantage? But, besides, it is to be considered
        that we Chinese are universally a law-abiding people and
        that our conduct is very different from the lawlessness and
        violence of some other foreigners. Were it not that each so
        little understands the other's tongue, and mutual kind
        sentiments are not communicated, would not more cordial
        intercourse probably exist?</p>

        <center>
          <b>4. <i>The perpetual vexations of the Chinese.</i></b>
        </center>

        <p>The class that engage in digging gold are, as a whole,
        poor people. We go on board the ships. There we find
        ourselves unaccustomed to winds and waves and to the
        extremes of heat and cold. We eat little; we grieve much.
        Our appearance is plain and our clothing poor. At once,
        when we leave the vessel, boatmen extort heavy fares; all
        kinds of conveyances require from us more than the usual
        charges; as we go on our way we are pushed and kicked and
        struck by the drunken and the brutal; but as we cannot
        speak your language, we bear our injuries and pass on. Even
        when within doors, rude boys throw sand and bad men stones
        after us. Passers by, instead of preventing these
        provocations, add to them by their laughter. We go up to
        the mines; there the collectors of the licenses make
        unlawful exactions and robbers strip, plunder, wound and
        even murder some of us. Thus we are plunged into endless
        uncommiserated wrongs. But the first root of them all is
        that very degradation and contempt of the Chinese as a race
        of which we have spoken, which begins with your honorable
        nation, but which they communicate to people from other
        countries, who carry it to greater lengths.</p>

        <p>Now what injury have we Chinese done to your honorable
        people that they should thus turn upon us and make us drink
        the cup of wrong even to its last poisonous dregs?</p>

        <center>
          <b>5. <i>Fatal injuries unpunished.</i></b>
        </center>

        <p>Your Supreme Court has decided that the Chinese shall
        not bring action or give testimony against white men. Of
        how great wrongs is this the consummation! To the death of
        how many of us has it led! In cases that are brought before
        your officers of justice, inasmuch as we are unable to
        obtain your people as witnesses, even the murderer is
        immediately set free! Sanctioned by this, robbers of
        foreign nations commit the greatest excesses. It is a small
        thing with them to drive us away and seize our property.
        They proceed to do violence and kill us; they go on in a
        career of bloodshed without limit, since they find there
        are none to bear testimony against them. Let us mention
        some cases. In the third year of the present emperor, and
        seventh month, at B----, Yu Lin-shing, a Chinese, was shot
        and killed by an American. The murderer was apprehended and
        brought to the place of justice. He was released without
        condemnation. In the ninth month, at S----, Yu Waingok was
        murdered by a foreigner. In the same month, at B----, one
        of our countrymen was killed by an Indian. In the fourth
        year, second month, near M----, a man named Chiu Man-sze
        was shot with arrows, by Indians, and killed. In the sixth
        month, in L----, Liu Kiu was put to death by an American;
        the murderer was captured and put in prison; but, as usual,
        was released without trial. In the eleventh month, a
        Spaniard robbed and murdered one of our countrymen. In the
        fifth year, on the fourth day of the fifth month, a
        collector of the mining licenses killed Ching Ping, at
        P----. About the middle of the same month, at M----, the
        collectors of the licenses killed three men because they
        would not pay more than was justly due; their names were Wa
        Hon, A-Tang and A-Sui.</p>

        <p>It would be impossible to enumerate the men that have
        been killed; we have mentioned these as a few of them. To
        collect a catalogue of crimes is certainly noy a work of
        pleasure. But behold the root of them all in the prejudice
        and hate of your honorable nation! In cases where it is
        possible to procure the testimony of your people as to an
        injury, the Chinese may obtain reparation; but suppose
        there are occasions where, if none of your people know of a
        crime, Chinese were allowed to take up the case and to
        state their acquaintance with it, some of these stains of
        blood would not continue unwashed. Some object that the
        Chinese bear false witness. Do such not know that the
        Chinese do not understand your language?--or that within
        your courts of justice, too, there are corrupt men?--or
        that in the strifes of public litigation there may be found
        men of every country who will bear false testimony? Why,
        then, is this burden laid upon us Chinese alone? Suppose
        there be false witness borne, are the judges of your
        honorable country blind and stupid, so that they cannot
        discern it and estimate testimony at its value? Because
        here and there a Chinese or two has proved a perjurer,
        shall it prejudice our entire nation? Shall this degrade us
        beneath the negro and the Indian? This is a great
        injustice, such as is not heard of in our Middle Kingdom!
        It injures your fair name. Every nation under heaven mocks
        at you. Hence it is not alone we Chinese that suffer, but
        blessings are lost thereby to your own land.</p>

        <center>
          <b>6. <i>The persecution of the Chinese miners.</i></b>
        </center>

        <p>If a Chinese earns a dollar and a half in gold per day,
        his first desire is to go to an American and buy a mining
        claim. But should this yield a considerable result, the
        seller, it is possible, compels him to relinquish it.
        Perhaps robbers come and strip him of the gold. He dare not
        resist, since he cannot speak the language, and has not the
        power to withstand them. On the other hand, those who have
        no means to buy a claim seek some ground which other miners
        have dug over and left, and thus obtain a few dimes. From
        the proceeds of a hard day's toil, after the pay for food
        and clothes very little remains. It is hard for them to be
        prepared to meet the collector when he comes for the
        license money. If such a one turns his thoughts back to the
        time when he came here, perhaps he remembers that then he
        borrowed the money for his passage and expenses from his
        kindred and friends, or perhaps he sold all his property to
        obtain it; and how bitter those thoughts are! In the course
        of four years, out of each ten men that have come over
        scarcely more than one or two get back again. Among those
        who cannot do so, the purse is often empty; and the trials
        of many of them are worthy of deep compassion. Thus it is
        evident that the gold mines are truly of little advantage
        to the Chinese. Yet the legislature questions whether it
        shall not increase the license; that is, increase trouble
        upon trouble! It is pressing us to death. If it is your
        will that Chinese shall not dig the gold of your honorable
        country, then fix a limit as to time, say, for instance,
        three years, within which every man of them shall provide
        means to return to his own country. Thus we shall not
        perish in a foreign land. Thus mutual kindly sentiments
        shall be restored again.</p>

        <center>
          <b>7. <i>The irregularities of the collectors of the
          license.</i></b>
        </center>

        <p>These occur wherever the Chinese are engaged in mining;
        and they are not the acts of one man. The collectors of the
        license have no appointed districts: one man comes at this
        time, and a stranger the next. They have no appointed
        period: some come for the month's dues to-day, and
        to-morrow they require them again. In collecting from the
        miners who have money they extort heavy amounts besides. To
        miners who have none they refuse to grant time, and then
        demand the sums which they owe from other persons. If these
        refuse to pay them, the collectors seize their purses and
        take their last grain of gold. Should the Chinese dispute
        with them, they assault there with pistols and other
        weapons, and some of the miners may lose their lives, and
        there is no redress. Hence, when it is reported that the
        collectors are coming, those who have no gold are forced to
        fly in terror; those who could pay are thus frightened and
        follow; then they are pursued and beaten, perhaps killed.
        Occurrences like these are common. They all arise from the
        rapacity of the collectors and from the want of just
        regulations. Now we ask, first, that, in the collection of
        the licenses, each district shall be allotted to a certain
        man; that the boundaries of it shall be clearly defined;
        that other collectors shall not be allowed to come within
        them; that the day of each month when the collector will
        receive the license-money shall be previously published by
        placards; that on the payment of the four dollars he shall
        give the miner a written receipt as evidence, to prevent
        his being compelled to pay the money again; and that in the
        cases of those who are unable to pay, firstly, some
        extension of time may be granted; if at the second demand
        they still have no means to pay, security may be required
        from their fellow-miners, with some further extension of
        time; at the third demand, if neither they nor their
        security are ready to pay, then their property may be
        seized for the amount. There are none of us who would not
        gladly submit to such regulations as these. They would be
        just to both parties. And your losses from the miners
        running away or hiding their money would cease.</p>

          <b>8. <i>Usages to which, we object.</i></b>
        </center>

        <p>Our people have been Told of the excellence of the
        institutions of your honorable country; but when they have
        come to the new State of California, they have found them
        to be strange indeed. We know not from what nation came the
        men that have taken the lead in creating this condition of
        things, nor where rests the obligation of reforming it, but
        you cannot be ignorant of some things the truth of which we
        have seen and known. Allow us briefly to speak of them.
        Causes at law are not judged according to what is true or
        false; the strongest faction is counted to have the truth.
        In contentions between men it is not considered what is
        crooked and what is straight; sufficient money makes a
        man's claim appear straight. The treatment of men is not
        regulated by their characters for virtue or for vice; a
        fine exterior is accepted for virtue. New laws are
        constantly published, only to be changed again in a brief
        time. Suits that should be determined are postponed again
        and again. A person of purity and integrity appears in
        court and he is but ridiculed and insulted the more; a
        violent and wicked man, and he is paid the more respect.
        Cases involving money come before these tribunals, and they
        excite covetousness; cases of property, and they create
        envy of a man's abundance. Murder is allowed to escape
        without the forfeit of life; robbery occurs without the
        apprehension of the offender. False rumors are made a
        pretext to arrest men; officers apprehend the innocent in
        order to oppress and fine them. They practice neither
        humanity nor justice. Their ambition and their schemes
        terminate simply in gold and silver. Justice demands that
        political institutions such as these should speedily be
        reformed, or you will meet with the scorn of the whole
        world.</p>

          in<br />
          regard to abandoned women.</i></b>
        </center>

        <p>At first all the abandoned women who came to California
        from Hong-kong were boat-women from the seacoast: one of
        them arrived here during the first year of Hien-fung
        (1851). At that time, we Chinese proper, fearing that other
        people would mistake these for our own females, and thus
        disgraceful conceptions of us be spread abroad, specially
        requested your authorities to banish them. But the local
        authorities, not comprehending the evil, would not consent
        to their removal. From that time the number of those coming
        has constantly increased, and the flood of poison has
        become more and more wide and deep. It is now our request
        that you will enact laws for the correction of this
        grievance. We beseech you to stringently require commanders
        of vessels, while they carry these women away, to bring no
        more of them back. And a time should be fixed within which
        all here shall be compelled to leave, themselves providing
        the means, and returning to their own people. Thus will we
        be rid of this spreading poison and be relieved of this
        disgrace.</p>

          punished.</i></b>
        </center>

        <p>In our Middle Kingdom gambling is forbidden by law.
        Formerly, on account of its not being forbidden in your
        honorable country, many men learned this vice, and the
        results have been deeply injurious. Now we are fortunate in
        having a law against it passed by you and put into
        operation. If only men knew that they must rigidly obey it,
        and if from this time forth there shall be no secret
        granting of licenses, then we might hope that those who had
        learned this vice might return to honest occupations.</p>

          criminal cases.</i></b>
        </center>

        <p>At present, people from all nations are coming
        indiscriminately to your honorable country. Certainly many
        of them are good; but there are also bad persons among
        them. It constantly happens that the good are compelled to
        reap some of the fruits of the evil deeds of the vicious.
        Among our Chinese there are some bad people; and only the
        Chinese can know who they are. If you will permit the
        Chinese merchants, they will prepare private statements as
        to such persons, vouching for them by the signature of
        their names. Thus rogues may be justly punished, and will
        understand that the laws are to be respected, and will be
        deterred from the commission of crimes; and they will
        return to the ways of virtue.</p>

          when<br />
          the Chinese shall finally return to their own
          land.</i></b>
        </center>

        <p>When we were first favored with the invitations of your
        ship-captains to emigrate to California, and heard the
        laudations which they published of the perfect and
        admirable character of your institutions, and were told of
        your exceeding respect and love toward the Chinese, we
        could hardly have calculated that we would now be the
        objects of your excessive hatred--that your courts would
        refuse us the right of testimony; your legislature load us
        with increasing taxes and devise means how to wholly expel
        us; your collectors, even before the law is made, begin to
        demand larger sums, and to compel the month's payment for
        shorter periods than that time; that foreign villains,
        witnessing your degrading treatment of us, would assume the
        right to harass, plunder and rob us, possibly kill us; that
        injuries of every hind would be inflicted on us, and
        unceasing wrongs be perpetrated; that if we would desire to
        go, we would be unable to do so, and if we desired to
        remain, we could not. But now if, finally, you do not will
        that we should mine and traffic in your honorable country,
        we beg that you will fix by law a limit of three years,
        within which we may collect our property and return to our
        country; and that you will strictly forbid your
        ship-captains to use inducements for people to come, and,
        if they do not obey, severely punish them. Thus we will
        endeavor after the lapse of three years to leave upon your
        honorable soil not a trace of the Chinese population. If,
        on the other hand, you grant us as formerly to mine and
        trade here, then it is our request that you will give
        instructions to your courts that they shall again receive
        Chinese testimony; that they shall cease their incessant
        discussions about expelling the Chinese; that they shall
        quit their frequent agitations as to raising the license
        fees; that they shall allow the Chinese peace in the
        pursuit of their proper employments; and that they shall
        effectually repress the acts of violence common among the
        mountains, so that robbers shall not upon one pretext or
        another injure and plunder us. Thus shall your
        distinguished favor revive us like a continual
        dew.</p><br />
