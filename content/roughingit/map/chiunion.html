      B<font size="-1">RANCH</font>.--The executive branch of the
      Democratic organization has opened the campaign in good
      earnest in the county of Nevada. The local papers of Grass
      Valley chronicle two or three active raids of the Klan upon
      "Chinese ranches" within the last seven days. In one of these
      three of the "almond-eyed" were beaten and robbed. In
      another, "the robbers hung four of the Chinamen to make them
      produce their money," one of whom was so nearly murdered that
      "the blood was forced from his nostrils and ears." The Klan
      were rewarded by $30 in coin and dust. The local paper
      remarks that the parties to this robbery are known by the
      officers, and that they had better go to Sweetwater. They are
      no doubt all known to the Chinese, but that avails nothing,
      because the Legislature refused to recognize the Chinese as
      human, and these robbers are merely part of the Executive
      Committee which that sort of Democratic legislation
      authorized. The late Assembly has reason to congratulate
      itself upon the promptness of the Executive Committee of the
      party in reaping the fruits of its theory. They are worthy
      coadjutors. The Assembly prepares the feast and the Klan eats
      it. The Governor dines with the Chinese Embassadors.<br />
