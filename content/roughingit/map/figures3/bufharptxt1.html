        <p>    Mr. M`Cormick, member of Congress from Arizona, has
        just introduced a bill restricting the killing of the
        buffalo, which provides that, excepting for the purpose of
        using the meat for food or preserving the skin, it shall be
        unlawful to kill any bison or buffalo found any where on
        the public lands of the United States, the offender, upon
        conviction, being subject to a fine of one hundred dollars
        for each animal killed, one-half of the sum to be paid, on
        its collection, to the informer. Whether this measure will
        receive the approval of Congress and become a law is
        uncertain, although of the importance of some such
        provision there can be no question. The difficulty will be
        to secure its enforcement, as the extermination of these
        animals, which is now impending, is brought about by
        parties who, at a distance from any control, are a law unto
        themselves, and who are not likely to be influenced by any
        enactments that do not involve the means of execution.</p>
