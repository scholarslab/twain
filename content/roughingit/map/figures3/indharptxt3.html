          <b>LATE INDIAN OUTRAGES.</b>
        </center>

        <p>    The war on the "Smoky Hill Route" through Kansas
        continues with great fury. On the 26th of June last a band
        of three hundred Cheyennes, under a chief called "Roman
        Nose," attacked a station two miles from Fort Wallace, and
        ran off the Overland Stage Company's stock. They then
        advanced toward the fort, when Company G of the Seventh
        United States Cavalry, under command of Captain Barnitz,
        went out of meet them. The Indians fell back to the brow of
        a hill two miles from the fort, then turned and awaited the
        attack. The cavalry charged at a gallop, and were met by a
        counter charge. The Indians, with lances poised and arrows
        on the string, rode at them with great speed, and a
        hand-to-hand fight followed, in which the savages displayed
        unlooked-for daring. With their overwhelming numbers they
        succeeded in driving the cavalry back to the fort, with a
        loss of seven men killed, several wounded, and half the
        horses captured or killed. "Roman Nose" was very
        conspicuous in the fight, dashing into the midst of the
        fray on his powerful gray horse. He carried a spear, with
        which he unhorsed a soldier, and was about to spear him as
        he lay on the ground, when Corporal Harris struck the
        savage with his sword, which he had in his left hand.
        "Roman Nose" turned upon him, but as he did so Harris
        placed the muzzle of the Spencer rifle which he carried in
        his right hand at the breast of the savage and fired. With
        the blood spouting from his wound the Indian fell forward
        on his horse.</p>

        <p>    The Indians committed unheard of atrocities. A
        powerful warrior was seen to pick up the bugler, Charles
        Clark, who had been pierced by three arrows, and strip him
        as he rode along; after taking off all his clothing he
        mashed the head to a jelly with his tomahawk, and then
        threw the body under his horse's feet. The body of Sergeant
        Frederick Wyllyams was also fearfully mutilated. His scalp
        was taken, two balls pierced his brain, and his right brow
        was cut open with a hatchet. His nose was severed and his
        throat gashed. The body was opened and the heart laid bare.
        The legs were cut to the bone, and the arms hacked with
        knives. We give an engraving of the body from a photograph.
        We also give an illustration of the fight and a view of
        Fort Wallace, near which the engagement occurred. They are
        from sketches by Major A. R. Calhoun and Dr. Bell, who are
        associated with General Wright, now en route to make
        surveys in New Mexico, Arizona, and California for the
        Union Pacific Railroad. Major Calhoun describes Fort
        Wallace as being beautifully located on the North Fork of
        the Smoky River. Buildings are being erected of a beautiful
        pink-colored magnesian limestone, which can be cut with a
        saw and plane, and hardens on exposure.</p>

        <p>    Our other illustrations refer to an outrage
        perpetrated on Plum Creek, 14 miles west of Fort Harker, on
        June 16, in which two men named Carley and Doherty were
        attacked. A band of Indians approached and shook hands with
        them, and the next moment fired upon them. Carley was
        mortally wounded, but managed, with Doherty's aid, to get
        into the hut, where they fought the Indians for some hours,
        and finally drove them off. When they were gone Doherty
        swam Smoky Hill River, and going to the town of Ellsworth,
        gave the alarm. A party was sent in a boat to Carley's
        assistance, but he was dead. The body was taken to
        Ellsworth, and there buried.</p>
