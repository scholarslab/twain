          <b>SLAUGHTER OF BUFFALOES.</b>
        </center>

        <p>    The wanton killing of game in this country is
        condemned by every genuine sportsman, not one of whom will
        fail to indorse the sentiments contained in the following
        timely letter, written from Hays City by General Hazen to
        Mr. Henry Bergh, giving some idea of the foolish
        destruction of this valuable source of food:</p>

        "H. Bergh, Esq.:<br />
        <br />

        <p>    "Dear Sir,--Hoping to interest you, and through you
        the people of the country and Congress, I would
        respectfully state that the extraordinary introduction of
        railroads into and across the wilds of our country has made
        the vast herds of wild buffalo of the plains accessible to
        all classes of people, and each year vast numbers are
        slaughtered for so-called sport, and a greater number by
        hunters for their hides, which net about one dollar each. I
        have seen numbers of men this winter who have during the
        past season killed 1000 each for the paltry sum of one
        dollar apiece, the carcasses being left to rot on the
        plains. The buffalo is a noble and harmless animal, timid,
        and as easily taken as a cow, and very valuable as food for
        man. It lives upon a short grass which grows luxuriantly
        upon the high arid plains of this middle region, that is
        from dryness unfit for agriculture. The theory that the
        buffalo should be killed to deprive the Indians of food is
        a fallacy, as these people are becoming harmless under a
        rule of justice. In view of these facts, I would most
        respectfully and earnestly request that you use such proper
        influences as may be at your disposal to bring this subject
        before Congress, with the intention of having such steps
        taken as will prevent this wicked and wanton waste both of
        the lives of God's creatures and the valuable food they
        furnish. I am, very respectfully, your obedient
        servant,</p>

        <center>

          "Brevet Major-General United States Army."

        <p>    The buffalo formerly ranged to the Atlantic
        sea-board in Virginia and the Carolinas, and as far east as
        the Hudson River and Lake Champlain. It is comparatively
        few years since the prairies of Illinois were
        feeding-ground for thousands of buffalo. Year by year they
        are pressed back into that strip of land known, until very
        recently, by every school-boy, as "The Great American
        Desert," where they are slaughtered at the rate of several
        hundred thousand per annum. Of this vast number but a
        comparatively small percentage is killed for food or fur.
        Travelers shoot into the herds from coaches and railway
        cars, without expecting to secure the game, which they
        seldom do more than wound. Hunters will in a single run
        bring down several, and a few pounds of meat is all that is
        taken from any animal. Indeed, it would seem that strenuous
        efforts are made to exterminate the bison within the
        shortest convenient time. This is all very well for the
        wolves, coyotes, and ravens, but it is neither wise nor
        sportsman-like. It should be here remarked that army
        officers generally deprecate this work, and seem to realize
        that Uncle Sam will presently be called upon to furnish
        funds from the government purse to supply beef to Indians
        who are now well fed with buffalo beef, which they are
        careful never to waste. Our illustration on page 164 gives
        an excellent idea of a scene on the buffalo range, where
        hunters have destroyed thousands of pounds of meat and left
        it to fatten the wolves.</p>
