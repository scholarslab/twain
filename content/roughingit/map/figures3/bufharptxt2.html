          <b>[From] IN THE FAR WEST.</b>
        </center>

        <p>    In the picture on page 789 the [hunting] party have
        reached the higher land, and have suddenly halted. Not far
        off has appeared, on the crest of a hillock a little above
        them, the first buffalo, which has gladdened their eyes and
        made the pulse of all beat faster. There stands the
        monster, stock-still, gazing at them with the strong,
        steady, majestic gaze of his tribe. He is the forerunner,
        outpost, picket, of his particular herd, browsing and
        keeping guard on the frontier of their domain. A great,
        tough-ribbed, hard and hairy headed, and bearded bull, he
        is one of that outer circle of buffaloes which is always
        found around the cows and young, who browse in the centre
        of this circle, which consists of the males. He watches for
        two enemies; for the white or Kiota wolf--a cruel, sly,
        rapacious beast, which infests the haunts of the buffaloes,
        and stealthily pounces as he may upon their young, their
        feeble, or their wounded--and for man, in the shape of
        Indians, who vie with the Kiota in their cunning and their
        greed. For, while the white man boldly, with true
        Anglo-Saxon grit and love of "a fair fight and no favor,"
        attacks the buffalo face to face in open day, the red man
        resorts to stratagem to entrap his prey. He poisons his
        arrows, and conceals them in his breast; he envelops
        himself in the Kiota's skin, and imitating the sneaking
        movements of the wolf, will follow and hang about a herd,
        often for miles, biding the moment of assault. When they
        get within proper range the Indians suddenly rise to their
        feet, dart forward with their lightning speed--they are the
        swiftest runners on earth--and thrust their arrows again
        and again through the coarse-haired hides of their victims.
        The Indian is tiger-like in his ferocity when hunting the
        buffalo: his eyes gleam, his mouth foams, and his hideously
        painted countenance fairly glows with the heat of his
        passion.</p>
