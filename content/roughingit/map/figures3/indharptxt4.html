          <b>A HOME QUESTION.</b>
        </center>

        <p>    The Indian difficulty seems to be almost hopeless.
        Two influential chiefs have just been at Washington and New
        York, seeking to come to some understanding. They are
        scarcely back again upon the plains--the Red Cloud has
        hardly vanished--when the black cloud rolls up, and we are
        told that we are to have a war. If it be a general war it
        will be a terrible war; a war full of atrocities and
        involving enormous expense; and when there comes a lull
        called peace we shall find that the only result is an
        immense increase of the debt and a slight decrease of the
        Indian population. It is not very easy to discover what the
        exact understanding was between the Government and Red
        Cloud. His complaint, however rhetorically served up in the
        reports, was very distinct. It was the old story of bad
        faith. "You are the strong power," he says. "You ask us to
        make a treaty. We make it, and you break it." And that is
        undoubtedly the truth. Yet it must be allowed that the
        Indians are a wild and impracticable race; that contact
        with civilization corrupts them; and that, if we break
        treaties, they are also treacherous and ferocious. We must
        deal with facts, not with theories nor hopes nor wishes. It
        can not be honestly said, for instance, that the approach
        of the white race and civilzation have made the Indian
        cruel. They found him so.</p>

        <p>    Shall they, then, be exterminated? If the bare
        suggestion be denounced as infamous, it is evident that we
        must do something else than fight them perpetually. But if
        we find that we can not manage them from without, can we
        not manage them from within? If, for instance, Red Cloud
        and others be really chiefs of influence, why not make them
        directly serviceable? Why not prove to them the generous
        intention of the Government, show them its willingness to
        atone liberally for injuries, explain to them the
        difficulties which necessarily surround the subject,
        persuade them that it is not hostile but friendly, and so
        win the leaders who command the tribes? Macaulay, in his
        essay upon "Ranke's History," says that the administrative
        genius of the Roman Church shows itself conspicuously in
        turning to account every kind of material, every whim and
        prejudice and fanaticism and passion. Instead of allowing
        the discontented or the zealous to withdraw as sects, it
        organizes them as orders. Loyola, at Oxford, would have
        headed a secession; John Wesley, at Rome, would have been
        made general of a new society in the Church.</p>

        <p>    The principle is as wise in the government of a
        country as in that of a Church. Is it wholly impracticable
        in our Indian policy? Is it impossible for us to prove to
        Red Cloud and his brethren that their highest interest lies
        in friendly relations with us, relations that we will
        honestly maintain? If, indeed, mutual intelligence is
        impossible--if Red Cloud is a mere grizzly bear, and it
        would be as reasonable to attempt relations with the
        buffaloes as with the Indians, which seems to be the theory
        of some, let us act accordingly. There is no prohibition
        upon hunting the buffalo. Every hunter rides and shoots at
        his own risk. We propose no buffalo treaties; we have no
        buffalo reservations. If the Indians are mere horned
        beasts, the only care we need have is to prevent them from
        goring the frontier. But if they are not buffaloes we must
        act differently. If we make treaties with them, we must
        insist that they be observed. The Chinese question excites
        Congress to that degree that it loses its temper and
        bandies unhandsome epithets in the freest manner. Is there
        nobody in Congress from the West familiar with the details
        of the Indian question who is interested enough to propose
        an honorable and feasible policy?</p>
