        <b>[From] Introduction.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>    Among these reports, that of Lieutenant-General
        Sheridan will, from his rank and large experience, attract
        the first notice, and I beg to invite close study of his
        entire report. His command embraces eight of the ten
        regiments of cavalry and eighteen of the twenty-five
        regiments of infantry, which compose the entire Army; and
        though he states this force to be entirely inadequate to
        perform the vast amount of labor required of him by the
        vicissitudes of service, yet it is impossible further to
        re-enforce him without absolutely stripping our seaboard,
        or abandoning other territories of equal value and
        subjected to the same dangers which he so graphically
        describes in his own. The troops now subject to his command
        compose quite two-thirds of the effective force of the
        whole Army, and his territorial command extends from the
        British line on the north, to the mouth of the Rio Grande
        south, an average of 1,500 miles long, and from the
        Mississippi westward to and including the Rocky Mountain
        Chain, an average of 1,200 miles broad. As General Sheridan
        well describes, this vast region has undergone in the past
        ten years a more violent and radical change than any like
        space of the earth's surface during any previous fifty
        years. From being the pasture-field of millions of buffalo,
        elk, deer, antelopes, and large game, affording abundant
        food for the Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Comanche
        Indians, it has already passed into the condition of a
        farming or pastoral country traversed by many railroads.
        The game is nearly all gone, the Indian has been forced on
        to small reservations; farms and herds of neat-cattle are
        fast taking the place of the buffalo, and every ox and
        steer has an owner who will fight for his property. Nearly
        all the Indian treaties were made on the theory that this
        change would occur more slowly, that the government would
        only have to furnish partial food for the Indian, and that
        he could procure half or a quarter of the necessary meat by
        hunting. I know that such was the belief of the commission,
        of which I was a member, which negotiated the treaties of
        1868, and, having traversed the plains ten or fifteen times
        since that date, I can bear personal testimony that where
        in 1868 millions of buffalo could be found, not a single
        one is now seen.</p>

        <p>    Again, it was then a favorite theory that the Indian
        would gradually see for himself, in the disappearance of
        these herds of buffalo, a reason why he should plow and
        cultivate the ground like the white man; but his progress
        in this direction is scarcely perceptible, save in the
        remnants of tribes like the Santees, Pawnees, Navajoes,
        Cherokees, &amp;c., while the Sioux, Cheyennes, Arapahoes,
        Kiowas, &amp;c., "the nomade of the Great West," seem to
        prefer death to the common toil of the farmer. Beyond
        question, it was hunger which drove the Bannocks and
        Cheyennes to war this summer, as recounted by Generals
        Pope, Crook, and Howard; and similar escapades, causing
        great alarm and some murders, will occur each coming year
        unless these Indians be kept quiet by <i>more food</i>. It
        seems idle to expect that the enterprising and industrious
        white race will cease till every acre of this continent
        susceptible of cultivation is reduced to possession, and
        till the vast unfenced prairie which has been for ages the
        pasture-field for its millions of buffalo is covered by
        herds of horses, beef cattle, and sheep, each having an
        owner entitled to protection in his property by the
        government, local or national.</p>

        <p>    It is not to be expected that these pasture-fields
        can be used by the two races in common without everlasting
        conflict; but the reservations already set apart for the
        Indians are large enough, and should suffice for them
        ultimately to raise all the meat and grain necessary for
        their subsistence; but mean time they must have more food,
        else they will steal and fight. To convert the Indians into
        a pastoral race is the first step in their upward progress
        toward civilization; that of agriculturist must be the next
        stage, though slower of realization; but in this direction
        is the sole hope of rescuing any part of the "nomade"
        Indians from utter annihilation.</p>
