        <b>[From] Chapter XXXIX.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>    I visited the theater [in Virginia, Montana] to see
        the 'Lady of Lyons.' The admission-fee was one dollar
        and-a-half. The drop curtain was of cambric; the stage, as
        large as a very small bedroom; five tallow candles served
        for foot-lights; and the orchestra consisted of four
        performers. Many spectators wore revolvers; but the rough
        crowd was totally decorous, in deference to the half-dozen
        wives and sisters present.</p>

        <p><a href="javascript:Start('womrichards.jpg')"><img src=
          "womrichardst.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" alt="1867 ILLUSTRATION" /></a>     I
        found the hurdy-gurdy more popular. At one end of the long
        hall, a well-stocked bar, and a monte bank in full blast;
        at the other, a platform occupied by three musicians;
        between, many lookers-on, with cigars and meerschaums. The
        orchestra leader shouted:</p>

        <p>    'Take your ladies for the next dance!'</p>

        <p>    Half-a-dozen swarthy fellows fresh from the
        diggings, selected partners from the tawdry, bedizened
        women who stood in waiting. After each dance the miners led
        their partners to the bar for whisky or champagne; then
        after a short pause, another dance; and so the sorry
        revelry continued from nine o'clock until nearly daylight,
        interrupted only by two fights. For every dance each
        masculine participant paid one dollar, half going to his
        partner, and half to the proprietor. This latter
        functionary, who was dealing monte, with revolver at his
        belt, assured me that his daily profits averaged one
        hundred dollars. Publicly, decorum was preserved; and to
        many miners, who had not seen a feminine face for six
        months, these poor women represented vaguely something of
        the tenderness and sacredness of their sex.</p>
