          <b>WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH THE INDIANS?</b>
        </center>

        <p>    Certainly the country has reason to be dissatisfied
        with the present conduct of the Indian war on the plains.
        It was begun by volunteer troops of the United States in
        1864 by the commission of a series of outrages culminating
        in the horrible "Chivington massacre." It has been
        characterized in its progress since only by ambuscades and
        massacres of the white settlers, travelers, and troops. The
        great industrial enterprise of the age, the Pacific
        Railroad, has been retarded--it is now, as far as one
        branch is concerned, abandoned; the overland routes to the
        Pacific coast have been interrupted, and, practically,
        travel is at this time suspended. Fights, in which our
        troops are invariably at the disadvantage of inadequate
        numbers of men and animals, are of almost daily occurrence;
        and disasters to our arms or massacres of our settlers have
        been recorded and illustrated in this journal for the last
        ten months with painful frequency. Nothing, literally
        nothing, has been accomplished by the commands of Generals
        Hancock and Custer in their seemingly purposeless marches
        to and fro between the Platte and Arkansas rivers; the
        Indians, in small but decidedly predatory bands, control
        the whole region between those streams and along the Kansas
        and Colorado border. And yet we are officially told that
        this ineffective style of warfare is costing the country
        $1,000,000 per day, and it was estimated a month ago that
        $100,000,000 would be expended in accomplishing the work of
        subduing about ten or fifteen thousand warriors spread over
        a territory of only about two hundred miles square. At the
        present rate of progress it will certainly cost that
        much.</p>

        <p>    But is there not a cheaper, wiser, and more humane
        method of dealing with these refractory subjects? Is it
        imperatively necessary that the country should prosecute
        the war to the "lame and impotent conclusion" which it
        threatens? What has become of the mysterious Indian Peace
        Commissioners lately mentioned as at Washington ready to
        proceed to the scene of warfare? If such a Commission is
        not on its way to the West one should be sent immediately,
        and the war terminated at once. If we were right in
        beginning it we are powerful enough to afford to be
        generous in granting terms of peace; if we were at
        fault--and there remains but little doubt of that--we ought
        to be for that reason more eager to conclude a liberal
        peace. It is very clearly understood that this, like all
        the previous Indian wars in the West, originated in
        disputes between the Indians and white settlers--that it is
        the natural contest arising out of the clashing of the
        adverse interests of the two races located on and each
        claiming the territory; and the surest way to settle this
        and prevent all similar wars, is for the Government to take
        its proper position as an arbiter between its sons and its
        dependents, and see that the latter have mercy shown them.
        It is not justice but mercy that the Government is called
        upon to exercise, for justice to the poor, contemptible,
        and degraded Indian would be severest cruelty. The Indian
        tribes, as regards numbers and nature, are in a dependent
        state; they prefer that idle and ignoble condition, and can
        be just as well, and much more cheaply, taken care of as
        our pensioners than as our antagonists. In every treaty
        which has been made with them for years past they have
        easily been induced to abandon their old homes for new
        reservations away from the white man's track; and there is
        nothing to prevent a sensible commission, properly
        authorized, from inducing all the belligerent tribes
        occupying the envied and contested ground between the
        Platte and Arkansas rivers to remove to more remote
        hunting-grounds by the judicious expenditure of a few
        millions in trinkets and annuities.</p>
