          <b>OUR INDIAN POLICY.</b>
        </center>

        <p>    That our whole Indian policy must be reviewed and
        improved there is no longer any doubt. The Secretary of War
        informs the Military Committee that the Indian traders are
        freely selling muskets and ammunition to the Indians, who,
        by the exorbitant prices they pay, are manifestly preparing
        for hostilities. Lieutenant-General Sherman has forbidden
        any further transactions of the kind, and General Grant has
        approved his prohibition, saying that if we are to go on
        arming the Indians we must either withdraw our troops, and
        Congress must authorize a general Indian war, or the whites
        upon the great Plains must be exterminated.</p>

        <p>    The frontier whites are doubtless responsible for
        much of this trouble. The mutual hostility of the whites
        and the Indians is most bitter. The horrible massacre by
        the Indians of the garrison of Fort Kearney shows how
        relentless the enmity is, and it is difficult to see what
        remedy there is but the presence of a large and imposing
        military force upon the Plains and the sternest punishment
        for such offenses. The difficulty is constantly increased
        by the jealousies among the Indians in regard to the money
        which it is the duty of the Secretary of the Interior to
        spend for their benefit. General Grant is of opinion that
        the exigency demands the transfer of the Indian Bureau to
        the War Department, and the abolition of the system of
        Indian agents and licensed traders.</p>

        <p>    It is evident that the present Indian management is
        inefficient. As the Pacific Railroad is pushed across the
        Plains, and the question of rapid intercourse with the
        western shore of the continent rises into importance, the
        question of its security is not less vital. The country
        which the Indians occupy is not arable. Their reliance is
        the chase; and when the buffalo is scarce they must depend
        upon the plunder of emigrant trains. The whole subject has
        been postponed and laid aside. But we trust that the
        reports of the Secretary of War to the Military Committee,
        with the testimony of Generals Grant and Sherman, will lead
        to a comprehensive and careful consideration of the
        matter.</p>

        <p>    It should be constantly remembered, however, that
        the whites are equally guilty with the Indians; and the new
        system should comprehend the strictest supervision of the
        whites with the utmost possible protection of the Indians.
        Any policy which encourages the whites to regard the
        Indians as mere vermin to be shot at sight, which is
        substantially the present policy, will only teach the
        Indians to retaliate. We have no sentimental theory of the
        Indians, but a system of simple extermination will cost us
        as dearly as it costs them. The frontiers must be made
        secure; but if the savages could feel that we were not
        necessarily their enemies we should have taught them what
        our treaties have hitherto failed to teach.</p>
