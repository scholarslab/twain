        <b>TREATY WITH SIOUX INDIANS.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>    This treaty, concluded April 29, 1868, (15 Stat.,
        639-640,) may be regarded as having laid the foundation for
        the civilization of the wild and intractable Sioux tribes.
        The sixteenth article of this treaty stipulates that the
        country north of the North Platte River and east of the
        summits of Big Horn Mountains shall be considered as
        unceded Indian territory; that no white person shall be
        permitted to settle upon or occupy any portion of the same,
        or, without the consent of the Indians first obtained, to
        pass through the same. A large portion of the territory
        embraced within this provision is in the state of Nebraska,
        and the time has arrived when it should be open to
        settlement and cultivation by the white man. It is not
        needed for Indian purposes, nor is it desirable that it
        should be longer considered and held as unceded Indian
        territory. The eleventh article of the same treaty secures,
        to the Indians who were parties to it, the right to hunt on
        any lands north of the North Platte and on the Republican
        Fork of the Smoky Hill River, so long as the buffaloes
        range thereon in such numbers as to justify the chase. It
        is not believed that buffaloes range any longer on the
        territory thus described in numbers sufficiently large to
        justify the chase, nor is it desirable that these Indians
        should longer enjoy the privilege of hunting buffaloes
        within this territory. . . .</p>
