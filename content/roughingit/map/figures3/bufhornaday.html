        <b>[From Appendix] IV. CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION FOR THE
        PROTECTION OF THE BISON.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>    The slaughter of the buffalo down to the very point
        of extermination has been so very generally condemned, and
        the general Government has been so unsparingly blamed for
        allowing such a massacre to take place on the public
        domain, it is important that the public should know all the
        facts in the case. To the credit of Congress it must be
        said that several very determined efforts were made between
        the years 1871 and 1876 looking toward the protection of
        the buffalo. . . . [but] when both houses of Congress
        succeeded in passing a suitable act (June 23, 1874) it went
        to the President in the last days of the session only to be
        pigeon-holed, and die a natural death.</p>

        <p>    The following is a complete history of Congressional
        legislation in regard to the protection of the buffalo from
        wanton slaughter and ultimate extinction. The first step
        taken in behalf of this persecuted animal was on March 13,
        1871, when Mr. McCormick, of Arizona, introduced a bill (H.
        R. 157), which was ordered to be printed. Nothing further
        was done with it. It read as follows:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <i>Be it enacted, etc.</i>, That, excepting for the
          purpose of using the meat for food or preserving the
          skin, it shall be unlawful for any person to kill the
          bison, or buffalo, found anywhere upon the public lands
          of the United States; and for the violation of this law
          the offender shall, upon conviction before any court of
          competent jurisdiction, be liable to a fine of $100 for
          each animal killed, one-half of which sum shall, upon its
          collection, be paid to the informer.
        </blockquote>

        <p>    On February 14, 1872, Mr. Cole, of California,
        introduced in the Senate the following resolution, which
        was considered by unanimous consent and agreed to:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <i>Resolved</i>, That the Committee on Territories be
          directed to inquire into the expediency of enacting a law
          for the protection of the buffalo, elk, antelope, and
          other useful animals running wild in the Territories of
          the United States against indiscriminate slaughter and
          extermination, and that they report by bill or otherwise.
        </blockquote>

        <p>    On February 16, 1872, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts,
        introduced a bill in the Senate (S. 655) restricting the
        killing of the buffalo upon the public lands; which was
        read twice by its title and referred to the Committee on
        Territories.</p>

        <p>    On April 5, 1872, Mr. R. C. McCormick, of Arizona,
        made a speech in the House of Representatives, while it was
        in Committee of the Whole, on the restriction of the
        killing of buffalo.</p>

        <p>    He mentioned a then recent number of <i>Harper's
        Weekly</i>, in which were illustrations of the slaughter of
        buffalo, and also read a partly historical extract in
        regard to the same. He related how, when he was once
        snow-bound upon the Kansas Pacific Railroad, the buffalo
        furnished food for himself and fellow-passengers. Then he
        read the bill introduced by him March 13, 1871, and also
        copies of letters furnished him by Henry Bergh, president
        of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
        Animals, which were sent to-the latter by General W. B.
        Hazen, Lieut. Col. A. G. Brackett, and E. W. Wynkoop. He
        also read a statement by General Hazen to the effect that
        he knew of a man who killed ninety-nine buffaloes with his
        own hand in one day. He also spoke on the subject of
        cross-breeding the buffalo with common cattle, and read an
        extract in regard to it from the San Francisco
        <i>Post</i>.</p>

        <p>    On April 6, 1872, Mr. McCormick asked leave to have
        printed in the Globe some remarks he had prepared regarding
        restricting the killing of buffalo, which was granted.</p>

        <p>    On January 5, 1874, Mr. Fort, of Illinois,
        introduced a bill (H. R. 921) to prevent the useless
        slaughter of buffalo within the Territories of the United
        States; which was read and referred to the Committee on the
        Territories.</p>

        <p>    On March 10, 1874, this bill was reported to the
        House from the Committee on the Territories, with a
        recommendation that it be passed.</p>

        <p>    The first section of the bill provided that it shall
        be unlawful for any person, who is not an Indian, to kill,
        wound, or in any way destroy any female buffalo of any age,
        found at large within the boundaries of any of the
        Territories of the United States.</p>

        <p>    The second section provided that it shall be, in
        like manner, unlawful for any such person to kill, wound,
        or destroy in said Territories any greater number of male
        buffaloes than are needed for food by such person, or than
        can be used, cured, or preserved for the food of other
        persons, or for the market. It shall in like manner be
        unlawful for any such person, or persons, to assist, or be
        in any manner engaged or concerned in or about such
        unlawful killing, wounding, or destroying of any such
        buffaloes; that any person who shall violate the provisions
        of the act shall, on conviction, forfeit and pay to the
        United States the sum of $100 for each offense (and each
        buffalo so unlawfully killed, wounded, or destroyed shall
        be and constitute a separate offense), and on a conviction
        of a second offense may be committed to prison for a period
        not exceeding thirty days; and that all United States
        judges, justices, courts, and legal tribunals in said
        Territories shall have jurisdiction in cases of the
        violation of the law.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Cox said he had been told by old hunters that it
        was impossible to tell the sex of a running buffalo; and he
        also stated that the bill gave preference to the
        Indians.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Fort said the object was to prevent early
        extermination; that thousands were annually slaughtered for
        skins alone, and thousands for their tongues alone; that
        perhaps hundreds of thousands are killed every year in
        utter wantonness, with no object for such destruction. He
        had been told that the sexes could be distinguished while
        they were running.</p>

        <p>    This bill does not prohibit any person joining in a
        reasonable chase and hunt of the buffalo.</p>

        <p>    Said Mr. Fort, "So far as I am advised, gentlemen
        upon this floor representing all the Territories are
        favorable to the passage of this bill."</p>

        <p>    Mr. Cox wanted the clause excepting the Indians from
        the operations of the bill stricken out, and stated that
        the Secretary of the Interior had already said to the House
        that the civilization of the Indian was impossible while
        the buffalo remained on the plains.</p>

        <p>    The Clerk read for Mr. McCormick the following
        extract from the <i>New Mexican</i>, a paper published in
        Santa F&eacute;:</p>

        <blockquote>
          The buffalo slaughter, which has been going on the past
          few years on the plains, and which increases every year,
          is wantonly wicked, and should be stopped by the most
          stringent enactments and most vigilant enforcements of
          the law. Killing these noble animals for their hides
          simply, or to gratify the pleasure of some Russian duke
          or English lord, is a species of vandalism which can not
          too quickly be checked. United States surveying parties
          report that there are two thousand hunters on the plains
          killing these animals for their hides. One party of
          sixteen hunters report having killed twenty-eight
          thousand buffaloes during the past summer. It seems to us
          there is quite as much reason why the Government should
          protect the buffaloes as the Indians.
        </blockquote>

        <p>    Mr. McCormick considered the subject important, and
        had not a doubt of the fearful slaughter. He read the
        following extract from a letter that he had received from
        General Hazen:</p>

        <blockquote>
          I know a man who killed with his own hand ninety-nine
          buffaloes in one day, without taking a pound of the meat.
          The buffalo for food has an intrinsic value about equal
          to an average Texas beef, or say $20. There are probably
          not less than a million of these animals on the western
          plains. If the Government owned a herd of a million oxen
          they would at least take steps to prevent this wanton
          slaughter. The railroads have made the buffalo so
          accessible as to present a case not dissimilar.
        </blockquote>

        <p>    He agreed with Mr. Cox that some features of the
        bill would probably be impracticable, and moved to amend
        it. He did not believe any bill would entirely accomplish
        the purpose, but he desired that such wanton slaughter
        should be stopped.</p>

        <p>    Said he, "It would have been well both for the
        Indians and the white men if an enactment of this kind had
        been placed on our statute-books years ago. . . . I know of
        no one act that would gratify the red men more."</p>

        <p>    Mr. Holman expressed surprise that Mr. Cox should
        make any objection to parts of the measure. The former
        regarded the bill as "an effort in a most commendable
        direction," and trusted that it would pass.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Cox said he would not have objected to the bill
        but from the fact that it was partial in its provisions. He
        wanted a bill that would impose a penalty on every man,
        red, white, or black, who may wantonly kill these
        buffaloes.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Potter desired to know whether more buffaloes
        were slaughtered by the Indians than by white men.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Fort thought the white men were doing the
        greatest amount of killing.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Eldridge thought there would be just as much
        propriety in killing the fish in our rivers as in
        destroying the buffalo in order to compel the Indians to
        become civilized.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Conger said; "As a matter of fact, every man
        knows the range of the buffalo has grown more and more
        confined year after year; that they have been driven
        westward before advancing civilization." But he opposed the
        bill!</p>

        <p>    Mr. Hawley, of Connecticut, said: "I am glad to see
        this bill. I am in favor of this law, and hope it will
        pass."</p>

        <p>    Mr. Lowe favored the bill, and thought that the
        buffalo ought to be protected for proper utility.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Cobb thought they ought to be protected for the
        settlers, who depended partly on them for food.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Parker, of Missouri, intimated that the policy
        of the Secretary of the Interior was a sound one, and that
        the buffaloes ought to be exterminated, to prevent
        difficulties in civilizing the Indians.</p>

        <p>    Said Mr. Conger, "I do not think the measure will
        tend at all to protect the buffalo."</p>

        <p>    Mr. McCormick replied: "This bill will not prevent
        the killing of buffaloes for any useful purpose, but only
        their wanton destruction."</p>

        <p>    Mr. Kassou said: "I wish to say one word in support
        of this bill, because I have had some experience as to the
        manner in which these buffaloes are treated by hunters. The
        buffalo is a creature of vast utility, . . . This animal
        ought to be protected; . . ."</p>

        <p>    The question being taken on the passage of the bill,
        there were--ayes 132, noes not counted.</p>

        <p>    So the bill was passed.</p>

        <p>    On June 23, 1874, this bill (H. R. 921) came up in
        the Senate.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Harvey moved, as an amendment, to strike out the
        words "who is not an Indian."</p>

        <p>    Said Mr. Hitchcock, "That will defeat the bill."</p>

        <p>    Mr. Frelinghuysen said: "That would prevent the
        Indians from killing the buffalo on their own ground. I
        object to the bill."</p>

        <p>    Mr. Sargent said: "I think we can pass the bill in
        the right shape without objection. Let us take it up. It is
        a very important one."</p>

        <p>    Mr. Frelinghuysen withdrew his objection.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Harvey thought it was a very important bill, and
        withdrew his amendment.</p>

        <p>    The bill was reported to the Senate, ordered to a
        third reading, read the third time, and passed. It went to
        President Grant for signature, and expired in his hands at
        the adjournment of that session of Congress.</p>

        <p>    On February 2, 1974, Mr. Fort introduced a bill (El.
        R. 1689) to tax buffalo hides; which was referred to the
        Committee on Ways and Means.</p>

        <p>    On June 10, 1874, Mr. Dawes, from the Committee on
        Ways and Means, reported back the bill adversely, and moved
        that it be laid on the table.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Fort asked to have the bill referred to the
        Committee of the Whole, and it was so referred.</p>

        <p>    On February 2, 1874, Mr. R. C. McCormick, of
        Arizona, introduced in the House a bill (H. R. 1728)
        restricting the killing of the bison, or buffalo, on the
        public lands; which was referred to the Committee on the
        Public Lands, and never heard of more.</p>

        <p>    On January 31, 1876, Mr. Fort introduced a bill (H.
        R. 1719) to prevent the useless slaughter of buffaloes
        within the Territories of the United States, which was
        referred to the Committee on the Territories.</p>

        <p>    The Committee on the Territories reported back the
        bill without amendment on February 23, 1876. Its provisions
        were in every respect identical with those of the bill
        introduced by Mr. Fort in 1874, and which passed both
        houses.</p>

        <p>    In support of it Mr. Fort said: "The intention and
        object of this bill is to preserve them [the buffaloes] for
        the use of the Indians, whose homes are upon the public
        domain, and to the frontiersmen, who may properly use them
        for food. . . . They have been and are now being
        slaughtered in large numbers. . . . Thousands of these
        noble brutes are annually slaughtered out of mere
        wantonness. . . . This bill, just as it is now presented,
        passed the last Congress. It was not vetoed, but fell, as I
        understand, merely for want of time to consider it after
        having passed both houses." He also intimated that the
        Government was using a great deal of money for cattle to
        furnish the Indians, while the buffalo was being wantonly
        destroyed, whereas they might be turned to their good.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Crounse wanted the words "who is not an Indian"
        struck out, so as to make the bill general. He thought
        Indians were to blame for the wanton destruction.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Fort thought the amendment unnecessary, and
        stated that he was informed that the Indians did not
        destroy the buffaloes wantonly.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Dunnell thought the bill one of great
        importance.</p>

        <p>    The Clerk read for him a letter from A. G. Brackett,
        lieutenant-colonel, Second United States Cavalry, stationed
        at Omaha Barracks, in which was a very urgent request to
        have Congress interfere to prevent the wholesale slaughter
        then going on.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Reagan thought the bill proper and right. He
        knew from personal experience how the wanton slaughtering
        was going on, and also that the Indians were not the ones
        who did it.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Townsend, of New York, saw no reason why a white
        man should not be allowed to kill a female buffalo as well
        as an Indian. He said it would be impracticable to have a
        separate law for each.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Maginnis did not agree with him. He thought the
        bill ought to pass as it stood.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Throckmorton thought that while the intention of
        the bill was a good one, yet it was mischievous and
        difficult to enforce, and would also work hardship to a
        large portion of our frontier people. He had several
        objections. He also thought a cow buffalo could not be
        distinguished at a distance.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Hancock, of Texas, thought the bill an impolicy,
        and that the sooner the buffalo was exterminated the
        better.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Fort replied by asking him why all the
        game--deer, antelope, etc.--was not slaughtered also. Then
        he went on to state that to exterminate the buffalo would
        be to starve innocent children of the red man, and to make
        the latter more wild and savage than he was already.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Baker, of Indiana, offered the following
        amendment as a substitute for the one already offered:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <i>Provided</i>, That any white person who shall employ,
          hire, or procure, directly or indirectly, any Indian to
          kill any buffalo forbidden to be killed by this act,
          shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and punished in
          the manner provided in this act.
        </blockquote>

        <p>    Mr. Fort stated that a certain clause in his bill
        covered the object of the amendment.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Jenks offered the following amendment:</p>

        <blockquote>
          Strike out in the fourth line of the second section the
          word "can" and insert "shall;" and in the second line of
          the same section insert the word "wantonly" before
          "kill;" so that the clause will read:
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          "That it shall be in like manner unlawful for any such
          person to wantonly kill, wound, or destroy in the said
          Territories any greater number of male buffaloes than are
          needed for food by such person, or than shall be used,
          cured, or preserved for the food of other persons, or for
          the market."
        </blockquote>

        <p>    Mr. Conger said: "I think the whole bill is unwise.
        I think it is a useless measure."</p>

        <p>    Mr. Hancock said: "I move that the bill and
        amendment be laid on the table."</p>

        <p>    The motion to lay the bill upon the table was
        defeated, and the amendment was rejected.</p>

        <p>    Mr. Conger called for a division on the passage of
        the bill. The House divided, and there were--ayes 93, noes
        48. He then demanded tellers, and they reported--ayes 104,
        noes 36. So the bill was passed. On February 25, 1876, the
        bill was reported to the Senate, and referred to the
        Committee on Territories, from whence it never
        returned.</p>

        <p>    On March 20, 1876, Mr. Fort introduced a bill (H. R.
        2767) to tax buffalo hides; which was referred to the
        Committee on Ways and Means, and never heard of
        afterward.</p>

        <p>    This was the last move made in Congress in behalf of
        the buffalo. The philanthropic friends of the frontiersman,
        the Indian, and of the buffalo himself, despaired of
        accomplishing the worthy object for which they had so
        earnestly and persistently labored, and finally gave up the
        fight. At the very time the effort in behalf of buffalo
        protection was abandoned the northern herd still
        flourished, and might have been preserved from
        extirpation.</p>
