          <b>OUR BARBARIAN BRETHREN.</b>
        </center>

        <p>    Our Indian fellow-citizens, it is well known,
        entertain very lax notions respecting the sanctity of the
        marriage tie--which, in fact, they consider any thing but a
        tie. The noble red man not only regards his wives as
        inferiors, but in the light of goods and chattels, and when
        tired of them trades them off in barter, or swaps them for
        another's. Our illustration on this page is an accurate
        sketch of the kind of trade that frequently takes place
        among them--an old, homely wife swapped for a young and
        pretty one, and a horse thrown in to boot. The women
        submit, knowing very well that they can't help
        themselves.</p>

        <p>    Our second illustration on this page records a very
        curious incident that took place recently at Fort Shaw,
        Montana. The Piegan Indians, being about to sue for peace,
        as a preliminary step, killed "Pete," one of the principal
        murderers of white settlers in that region, and brought his
        head to General De Trobriand as a pledge of their
        sincerity. The face of the dead "brave," deeply pitted with
        small-pox and scarred with wounds, presented a ghastly
        spectacle when uncovered in the General's presence; but as
        a token of their desire to cultivate more friendly
        relations with the whites it was more eloquent than
        words.</p>
