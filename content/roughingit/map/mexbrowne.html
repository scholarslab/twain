        <b>[From] Chapter XVI. Magdalena.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>  The only production against which there seems to be no
        limit, and certainly no effective law, is that of children.
        Owing to the climate, perhaps, and idleness, which is the
        father of all mischief and many mixed breeds of babies,
        these mongrel little humans abound to an amazing extort in
        the small towns of Sonora. Nearly all of them have Indian
        blood in them, and many denote a growing proclivity toward
        the American race. Hence yon often see in one family a
        remarkable variety of races. A mother with white-headed and
        blue-eyed children, and black-headed and black-eyed
        children, and children with straight hair, and curly hair,
        and thin lips, and thick lips, and noses long, and noses
        short, all bearing a strong family resemblance, is a very
        common kind of mother in this latitude. Occasionally some
        beneficent Padre goes through the country doing up a long
        arrearage of marriages, putting together in the holy bonds
        of wedlock all who desire to secure by the rites of the
        Church the partners with whom they chance at the time to be
        on terms of domestic intimacy. For this reason I think
        Sonora can beat the world in the production of villainous
        races. Miscegenation has prevailed in this country for
        three centuries. Every generation the population grows
        worse; and the Sonoranians may now be ranked with their
        natural compadres--Indians, burros, and coyotes. The worst
        of the whole combination of races is that which has the
        infusion of rascality in it from American sources. Mexican,
        Indian, and American blood concentrated in one individual
        makes the very finest specimen of a murderer, thief, or
        gambler ever seen on the face of the earth. Nothing in
        human form so utterly depraved can be found elsewhere. I
        know of no exception, and do not believe a good citizen of
        sound morals ever resulted from such an abominable
        admixture. Of such material as this is the town of
        Magdalena composed. It is said to be a very quiet and
        orderly place compared with Hermosillo,and I can well
        believe the statement; for while Magdalena has not been
        much favored with the presence of renegade Americans within
        the past few years, Hermosillo has long been their favorite
        place of resort, chiefly because it affords a more
        extensive field for the exercise of all the depraved
        passions of human nature.</p>

        <p>  <a href=
        "javascript:Start1('figures2/mexbrowne01.jpg')"><img src=
          "figures2/mexbrowne01t.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" alt="1868 ILLUSTRATION" /></a>
        We remained about two days in Magdalena, during which we
        greatly enjoyed the hospitality of our friend Gonzales
        Torrano. It is due to this gentleman to say, that he has
        done more for the accommodation of American travellers on
        their way through Sonora, and afforded them more assistance
        in procuring supplies of implements and provisions for
        their mining operations than any man in the country. He has
        done this without profit or reward, chiefly from the
        natural promptings of his heart, and incidentally from a
        liberal and intelligent desire to see the resources of this
        vast mineral region properly developed.</p>

        <p>  It is evident to any one passing through Sonora, even
        as far north as we did, that a great change is going on
        throughout the State. Every steamer from San Francisco
        lands at Mazatlan and Guyamas from 100 to 200 passengers,
        many of whom, disappointed in more northern regions, desire
        to establish themselves in the rich mineral fields of the
        south. Political disaffection toward their own Government
        may have something to do with this influx of Americans
        within the borders of Sinaloa and Sonora; but I would not
        like to say any thing vindictive on that point--especially
        as most of these enterprising adventurers are at present
        without money, and not a few of them dependent upon the
        charity of the Mexicans, who complain that they are obliged
        to support them. Quite a number of the more energetic,
        however, are making an honest living by driving teams,
        blacksmithing, or doing rough jobs of painting and
        housework. As yet but few have derived any income from the
        silver mines, though all are pretty rich in
        claims.</p><br />

        <br />
        <b>[From] Chapter XVII. Dona Inez.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>  I was interested in taking some views of the scenery
        in the Cocospera by Mr. Bartlett's romantic narrative of
        the captivity and sufferings of Dona Inez, a young Mexican
        girl, whose family were murdered in this canon about twelve
        years ago, and herself captured and held in bondage by the
        Apaches for fifteen months, subject to the most cruel
        treatment. News of her captivity having reached Mr.
        Bartlett during his service as Boundary Commissioner, he
        made a demand upon Mangus Colorado,the Apache chief, for
        her release. The answer was insolent and
        characteristic--that it was none of his business; this was
        a matter between the Apaches and the Mexicans. Mr. Bartlett
        explained that under the treaty between his Government and
        Mexico the officers of the United States were bound to aid
        the authorities of Sonora in suppressing Indian
        hostilities; that this was a very flagrant case, and if the
        girl was not at once de}ivered up he would proceed to take
        her by force. Having a strong party to back np his demand,
        it was deemed prudent by the cunning Apache to comply with
        it, and Dona Inez was reluctantly delivered to the
        Commissioner, who turned her over to Captain Gomez, of the
        Mexican army, then commandant at Tubac. It was admitted by
        all that Mr. Bartlett had manifested a most praiseworthy
        and chivalrous interest in the misfortunes of this young
        wuman. At the tender age of fifteen she had seen her
        relatives murdered before her eyes; had been dragged over
        mountains and deserts by ruthless savages; had suffered the
        most cruel barbarities at their hands; and was now once
        more, by the exertions of this humane American, restored to
        her friends and to civilization. The delicate and
        chivalrous conduct of Mr. Bartlett toward the fair captive
        can not be too lighly estimated, considering her beauty and
        the peculiar circumstanees of her career. Far different was
        the course of Captain Gomez, who, upon finding a beautiful
        young woman placed in his charge--of his own country
        too--fell desperately in love with her, and, contrary to
        all the rules of propriety, took her to lodge in his own
        quarters. When Mr. Bartlett next heard of her she was the
        idol and the ornament of the house of Gomez, who loved her
        not wisely but too well to marry her, having already a wife
        in the city of Mexico. This breach of duty and implied
        faith aroused the indignation of our Commissioner, who had
        so nobly rescued and delicately cherished the divine Inez;
        and it is currently stated in Arizona that he made it a
        subject of official protest to the Governor of Sonora and a
        letter of serious complaint to the Bishop. The Governor and
        Bishop, as I am told, were greatly mortified at the conduct
        of Gomez; but upon receiving his explanation, which was to
        the effect that his wife was still living, and would be
        very unhappy if he married another woman, they acquitted
        him of all blame in the matter, and Dona Inez continued to
        enjoy the hospitality of his mansion.</p>

        <p>  <a href=
        "javascript:Start('figures2/wombrowne02.jpg')"><img src=
          "figures2/wombrowne02t.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" alt="1868 ILLUSTRATION" /></a>
        The sequel of the romance I find recorded in my own
        note-book. Dona Inez is married and settled at Santa Cruz.
        Her husband is not Captain Gomez. I called at her house in
        company with Mr. Poston, and had an interview with her on
        the subject of her captivity among the Apaches. She had
        heard of the narrative of her adventures written by Mr.
        Bartlett, but had never seen his book. She spoke kindly and
        gratefully of her deliverer. On the subject of her
        treatment by the Apaches she was somewhat reserved. Her
        husband was much more communicative.</p>

        <p>  Dona Inez is now about twenty-seven years of age,
        though she looks older. Her features are thin, sharp, and
        care-worn, owing to ill-health. Possibly she may have been
        pretty in her youth. Mr. Bartlett thought so, and he ought
        to be a judge. He saw a great deal of beauty unadorned in
        his tour of exploration.</p><br />

        <b>[From] Chapter XIX. The Town of Santa Cruz.</b><br />
        <br />

        <p><a href=
        "javascript:Start3('figures2/mexbrowne02.jpg')"><img src=

         I thought I had seen the concentration of filth, laziness,
        and inanity, and the perfection of vicious mixtures of
        races at Imuriz and Magdalena; but Santa Cruz caps the
        climax. The more southern towns possess at least the
        advantage of a genial temperature, and it is not unpleasant
        to see people enjoy the <i>dolce far niente</i>, even if
        they indulge in it to excess. The chilling climate of Santa
        Cruz sweeps away all the dreamy illusions of indolence, and
        reduces the inhabitants to a condition of torpor depressing
        to witness. Too inert to stir about and gather sufficient
        wood for a comfortable fire, a genuine native of this
        region sits shivering all day long over three twigs of
        mesquit, his dirty serape drawn up over his shoulders, his
        skin a bilious black yellow, the inevitable cigarrito in
        his month; a score of starved coyote curs snapping around
        his heels; no gleam of hope in his eye, no spark of
        ambition in his nature--a dreary spectacle of wretchedness
        and inanity.</p><br />
