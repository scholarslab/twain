        <p>Our stay in Salt Lake City amounted to only two days,
        and therefore we had no time to make the customary
        inquisition into the workings of polygamy and get up the
        usual statistics and deductions preparatory to calling the
        attention of the nation at large once more to the
        matter.</p>

        <p>I had the will to do it. With the gushing
        self-sufficiency of youth I was feverish to plunge in
        headlong and achieve a great reform here--until I saw the
        Mormon women. Then I was touched. My heart was wiser than
        my head. It warmed toward these poor, ungainly and
        pathetically "homely" creatures, and as I turned to hide
        the generous moisture in my eyes, I said, "No--the man that
        marries one of them has done an act of Christian charity
        which entitles him to the kindly applause of mankind, not
        their harsh censure--and the man that marries sixty of them
        has done a deed of open-handed generosity so sublime that
        the nations should stand uncovered in his presence and
        worship in silence."</p>

          CHAPTER XV
        </center>

        <p>I<font size="-1">T</font> is a luscious country for
        thrilling evening stories about assassinations of
        intractable Gentiles. I cannot easily conceive of anything
        more cosy than the night in Salt Lake which we spent in a
        Gentile den, smoking pipes and listening to tales of how
        Burton galloped in among the pleading and defenceless
        "Morisites" and shot them down, men and women, like so many
        dogs. And how Bill Hickman, a Destroying Angel, shot Drown
        and Arnold dead for bringing suit against him for a debt.
        And how Porter Rockwell did this and that dreadful thing.
        And how heedless people often come to Utah and make remarks
        about Brigham, or polygamy, or some other sacred matter,
        and the very next morning at daylight such parties are sure
        to be found lying up some back alley, contentedly waiting
        for the hearse.</p>

        <p>And the next most interesting thing is to sit and listen
        to these Gentiles talk about polygamy; and how some portly
        old frog of an elder, or a bishop, marries a girl--likes
        her, marries her sister--likes her, marries another
        sister--likes her, takes another--likes her, marries her
        mother--likes her, marries her father, grandfather, great
        grandfather, and then comes back hungry and asks for more.
        And how the pert young thing of eleven will chance to be
        the favorite wife and her own venerable grandmother have to
        rank away down toward D 4 in their mutual husband's esteem,
        and have to sleep in the kitchen, as like as not. And how
        this dreadful sort of thing, this hiving together in one
        foul nest of mother and daughters, and the making a young
        daughter superior to her own mother in rank and authority,
        are things which Mormon women submit to because their
        religion teaches them that the more wives a man has on
        earth, and the more children he rears, the higher the place
        they will all have in the world to come--and the warmer,
        maybe, though they do not seem to say anything about
        that.</p>

        <p>According to these Gentile friends of ours, Brigham
        Young's harem contains twenty or thirty wives. They said
        that some of them had grown old and gone out of active
        service, but were comfortably housed and cared for in the
        henery--or the Lion House, as it is strangely named. Along
        with each wife were her children--fifty altogether. The
        house was perfectly quiet and orderly, when the children
        were still. They all took their meals in one room, and a
        happy and home-like sight it was pronounced to be. None of
        our party got an opportunity to take dinner with Mr. Young,
        but a Gentile by the name of Johnson professed to have
        enjoyed a sociable breakfast in the Lion House. He gave a
        preposterous account of the "calling of the roll," and
        other preliminaries, and the carnage that ensued when the
        buckwheat cakes came in. But he embellished rather too
        much. He said that Mr. Young told him several smart sayings
        of certain of his "two-year-olds," observing with some
        pride that for many years he had been the heaviest
        contributor in that line to one of the Eastern magazines;
        and then he wanted to show Mr. Johnson one of the pets that
        had said the last good thing, but he could not find the
        child. He searched the faces of the children in detail, but
        could not decide which one it was. Finally he gave it up
        with a sigh and said:</p>

        <center>
          <a href="javascript:Start2('chap15b.jpg')"><img src=
            "chap15bt.gif" alt="1872 ILLUSTRATION" /></a>
        </center>

        <p>"I thought I would know the little cub again but I
        don't." Mr. Johnson said further, that Mr. Young observed
        that life was a sad, sad thing--"because the joy of every
        new marriage a man contracted was so apt to be blighted by
        the inopportune funeral of a less recent bride." And Mr.
        Johnson said that while he and Mr. Young were pleasantly
        conversing in private, one of the Mrs. Youngs came in and
        demanded a breast-pin, remarking that she had found out
        that he had been giving a breast-pin to No. 6, and
        <i>she</i>, for one, did not propose to let this partiality
        go on without making a satisfactory amount of trouble about
        it. Mr. Young reminded her that there was a stranger
        present. Mrs. Young said that if the state of things inside
        the house was not agreeable to the stranger, he could find
        room outside. Mr. Young promised the breast-pin, and she
        went away. But in a minute or two another Mrs. Young came
        in and demanded a breast-pin. Mr. Young began a
        remonstrance, but Mrs. Young cut him short. She said No. 6
        had got one, and No. 11 was promised one, and it was "no
        use for him to try to impose on her--she hoped she knew her
        rights." He gave his promise, and she went. And presently
        three Mrs. Youngs entered in a body and opened on their
        husband a tempest of tears, abuse, and entreaty. They had
        heard all about No. 6, No. 11, and No. 14. Three more
        breast-pins were promised. They were hardly gone when nine
        more Mrs. Youngs filed into the presence, and a new tempest
        burst forth and raged round about the prophet and his
        guest. Nine breast-pins were promised, and the weird
        sisters filed out again. And in came eleven more, weeping
        and wailing and gnashing their teeth. Eleven promised
        breast-pins purchased peace once more.</p>

        <p>"That is a specimen," said Mr. Young. "You see how it
        is. You see what a life I lead. A man <i>can't</i> be wise
        all the time. In a heedless moment I gave my darling No.
        6--excuse my calling her thus, as her other name has
        escaped me for the moment--a breast-pin. It was only worth
        twenty-five dollars--that is, <i>apparently</i> that was
        its whole cost--but its ultimate cost was inevitably bound
        to be a good deal more. You yourself have seen it climb up
        to six hundred and fifty dollars--and alas, even that is
        not the end! For I have wives all over this Territory of
        Utah. I have dozens of wives whose <i>numbers</i>, even, I
        do not know without looking in the family Bible. They are
        scattered far and wide among the mountains and valleys of
        my realm. And mark you, every solitary one of them will
        hear of this wretched breast pin, and every last one of
        them will have one or die. No. 6's breast pin will cost me
        twenty-five hundred dollars before I see the end of it. And
        these creatures will compare these pins together, and if
        one is a shade finer than the rest, they will all be thrown
        on my hands, and I will have to order a new lot to keep
        peace in the family. Sir, you probably did not know it, but
        all the time you were present with my children your every
        movement was watched by vigilant servitors of mine. If you
        had offered to give a child a dime, or a stick of candy, or
        any trifle of the kind, you would have been snatched out of
        the house instantly, provided it could be done before your
        gift left your hand. Otherwise it would be absolutely
        necessary for you to make an exactly similar gift to all my
        children--and knowing by experience the importance of the
        thing, I would have stood by and seen to it myself that you
        did it, and did it thoroughly. Once a gentleman gave one of
        my children a tin whistle--a veritable invention of Satan,
        sir, and one which I have an unspeakable horror of, and so
        would you if you had eighty or ninety children in your
        house. But the deed was done--the man escaped. I knew what
        the result was going to be, and I thirsted for vengeance. I
        ordered out a flock of Destroying Angels, and they hunted
        the man far into the fastnesses of the Nevada mountains.
        But they never caught him. I am not cruel, sir--I am not
        vindictive except when sorely outraged--but if I had caught
        him, sir, so help me Joseph Smith, I would have locked him
        into the nursery till the brats whistled him to death. By
        the slaughtered body of St. Parley Pratt (whom God assoil!)
        there was never anything on this earth like it! <i>I</i>
        knew who gave the whistle to the child, but I could, not
        make those jealous mothers believe me. They believed
        <i>I</i> did it, and the result was just what any man of
        reflection could have foreseen: I had to order a hundred
        and ten whistles--I think we had a hundred and ten children
        in the house then, but some of them are off at college
        now--I had to order a hundred and ten of those shrieking
        things, and I wish I may never speak another word if we
        didn't have to talk on our fingers entirely, from that time
        forth until the children got tired of the whistles. And if
        ever another man gives a whistle to a child of mine and I
        get my hands on him, I will hang him higher than Haman!
        That is the word with the bark on it! Shade of Nephi!
        <i>You</i> don't know anything about married life. I am
        rich, and everybody knows it. I am benevolent, and
        everybody takes advantage of it. I have a strong fatherly
        instinct and all the foundlings are foisted on me. Every
        time a woman wants to do well by her darling, she puzzles
        her brain to cipher out some scheme for getting it into my
        hands. Why, sir, a woman came here once with a child of a
        curious lifeless sort of complexion (and so had the woman),
        and swore that the child was mine and she my wife--that I
        had married her at such-and-such a time in such-and-such a
        place, but she had forgotten her number, and of course I
        could not remember her name. Well, sir, she called my
        attention to the fact that the child looked like me, and
        really it did seem to resemble me--a common thing in the
        Territory--and, to cut the story short, I put it in my
        nursery, and she left. And by the ghost of Orson Hyde, when
        they came to wash the paint off that child it was an
        Injun!</p>

        <p>Bless my soul, you don't know anything about married
        life. It is a perfect dog's life, sir--a perfect dog's
        life. You can't economize. It isn't possible. I have tried
        keeping one set of bridal attire for all occasions. But it
        is of no use. First you'll marry a combination of calico
        and consumption that's as thin as a rail, and next you'll
        get a creature that's nothing more than the dropsy in
        disguise, and then you've got to eke out that bridal dress
        with an old balloon. That is the way it goes. And think of
        the wash-bill--(excuse these tears)--nine hundred and
        eighty-four pieces a week! No, sir, there is no such a
        thing as economy in a family like mine. Why, just the one
        item of cradles--think of it! And vermifuge! Soothing
        syrup! Teething rings! And `papa's watches' for the babies
        to play with! And things to scratch the furniture with! And
        lucifer matches for them to eat, and pieces of glass to cut
        themselves with! The item of glass alone would support
        <i>your</i> family, I venture to say, sir. Let me scrimp
        and squeeze all I can, I still can't get ahead as fast as I
        feel I ought to, with my opportunities. Bless you, sir, at
        a time when I had seventy-two wives in this house, I
        groaned under the pressure of keeping thousands of dollars
        tied up in seventy-two bedsteads when the money ought to
        have been out at interest; and I just sold out the whole
        stock, sir, at a sacrifice, and built a bedstead seven feet
        long and ninety-six feet wide. But it was a failure, sir. I
        could <i>not</i> sleep. It appeared to me that the whole
        seventy-two women snored at once. The roar was deafening.
        And then the danger of it! That was what I was looking at.
        They would all draw in their breath at once, and you could
        actually see the walls of the house suck in--and then they
        would all exhale their breath at once, and you could see
        the walls swell out, and strain, and hear the rafters
        crack, and the shingles grind together. My friend, take an
        old man's advice, and <i>don't</i> encumber yourself with a
        large family--mind, I tell you, don't do it. In a small
        family, and in a small family only, you will find that
        comfort and that peace of mind which are the best at last
        of the blessings this world is able to afford us, and for
        the lack of which no accumulation of wealth, and no
        acquisition of fame, power, and greatness can ever
        compensate us. Take my word for it, ten or eleven wives is
        all you need--never go over it."</p>

        <p>Some instinct or other made me set this Johnson down as
        being unreliable. And yet he was a very entertaining
        person, and I doubt if some of the information he gave us
        could have been acquired from any other source. He was a
        pleasant contrast to those reticent Mormons.</p>
