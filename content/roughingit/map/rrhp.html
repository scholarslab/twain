            <td valign="top">While in the woods and corn fields on
            one side of the Mississippi armies from the North and
            South fought a war, in the mountains and deserts on the
            other side 1000's of men (mostly Chinese and Irish)
            began building an iron roadway that would bring East
            and West closer together. Built west from San Francisco
            and east from Omaha, the two tracks were joined at
            Promontary Point, Utah, on 8 May 1869. In <i>Roughing
            It</i> MT says very little about the railroad: for
            comparison purposes, he follows his account of
            traveling by stage coach at <font size="-1"><b><a href=
            "rirr.html">THE END OF CHAPTER 4</a></b></font> by
            quoting an early description of traveling across the
            country by train from the 28 June 1869 <i>New York
            Times</i>. Though he doesn't call attention to it, his
            "West" of stagecoach drivers and pony express riders
            was already being replaced by the "West" described in
            accounts like the one in <font size="-1"><b><a href=
            "rrcrofut.html">CROFUT'S TOURIST'S GUIDE</a></b></font>
            (1872): a land where train tracks and telegraph poles
            were increasingly part of the landscape. At least,
            re-presentations of that landscape during the years
            1861-1873, between MT's heading west and the appearance
            of <i>Roughing It</i> often made America's
            technological and other achievements in "civilizing"
            the territory as prominent as the territory itself, as
            in the two 1871 "pictorial guide books" listed
            <i>below</i>: their colored-illustrations organize "the
            West" around the route of the newly opened railroad,
            while the train and its impressively engineered route
            are at the center of nearly all the images.<br /></td>
