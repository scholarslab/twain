      But we try to make the best of it, once there. "Let's say it
      <i>does</i> pay," says the jolly Tapley of our party. "Yes,
      let's sit on the banks of this lovely river." We do so. A
      companionable but not welcome watersnake does so also, and we
      leave him in possession. Try again. There is an Indian camp
      beside Hutching's. It looks romantic from this point. Let us
      get nearer. A vile stench greets us. These filthy wretches
      found a dead horse yesterday, and are now eating some of its
      carcass. There is one of the poor brute's legs with
      mud-begrimed hoof still hanging to it. Its entrails and other
      parts are strung out in the sun to dry for future eating; the
      black blood drips to the ground as a dog gnaws them greedily,
      until driven off by an Indian woman who is unwilling to share
      such a luxury. It will not do to approach these people too
      closely; they are covered with vermin. Their copper skins are
      black as soot in spots; this is caked dirt, pure and simple.
      They are clad in the discarded tatters of civilization; and
      how tattered the discarded garment of the Sierra Nevada
      mountaineer is, no one can know who has not seen. The
      consequence is that the sight of these people so near a
      pleasure resort is an offence to decency. Indian men loll
      under the trees playing cards for silver coin. They glare at
      us as we approach. It is easy to see that these people
      (although Ferguson assured us they were "tame") would have no
      humanitarian scruples about waging a war of extermination
      against the whites if they had but the power.<br />
      <br />
      While the men play cards and loaf under the shade of trees,
      the women sit in the broiling sun and grind acorns, beating
      them between heavy stones into the finest powder. These
      acorns ground to meal furnish the only food these poor
      creatures can rely on during winter; and to gather them and
      dispute their possession with the hogs is the work of the
      Indian women. That is, it is one part of their work, for that
      all work is done by Indian women is an old story. Manhood
      <i>oblige!</i><br /></td>
