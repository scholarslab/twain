      married William Morgan, who caught the "Gold Fever" and left

      <td>During the last week in June there were but a few
      warriors left in the village, the rest being all absent in
      the expedition to which I have already referred. Among those
      that remained was a third chief of the tribe, who, however,
      was not an Indian, but a mulatto slave that had escaped from
      Missouri or Arkansas, and managed to make his way to the
      haunts of the savages. Among these latter he had, by reason
      of his prowess and daring, raised himself thus, and it is
      likely that, but for the event I am about to relate, he would
      have finally gained the position of first chief. This
      occurrence happened on the thirtieth day or rather night of
      June, and for a while produced the wildest excitement in the
      village.<br />
      <br />
      On the night in question, a messenger came to my lodge, and
      said that <i>The Yellow Face</i>--the fugitive's name among
      the Indians--was very sick, and wanted to see me immediately.
      Of late I had noticed <i>The Yellow Face</i> casting upon me
      leering glances and looks, that made me tremble, and now I
      felt a chill come over me as I heard his ominous message. But
      I feared to disobey, and, accordingly, with the utmost
      trepidation, I repaired to his lodge, where I found him
      reclining upon a rude but comfortable couch of skins and
      robes. For some moments he did not take any notice of my
      entrance, nor in fact until I spoke. This roused him, or more
      properly seemed to, for that he was acting a part I now felt
      fully convinced, and, as he fixed upon me his black, basilisk
      eyes, he said:<br />
      <br />
      "<i>The Yellow Face</i> is very sick, and has sent for the
      <i>White Medicine</i>, because her medicine is good."<br />
      <br />
      The look that accompanied these words only enhanced my fears,
      and I was unable to utter a single word in reply, so occupied
      was my mind with thoughts of how I might best escape from my
      dangerous companion. After a moment or two of silence, <i>The
      Yellow Face</i> rose and stepped toward me, saying, in his
      own natural voice and language:<br />
      <br />
      "Don't be afeard, Missus, I'ze not agwine to hurt you. Yah!
      yah! I jes want you to come and be my wife; now won't
      you?"<br />
      <br />
      With these words the ignorant and sensual brute sprang
      between me and the entrance of the lodge, and then, drawing a
      huge scalping-knife, grinned a mocking smile, as coming
      towards me again, he said, in low, chuckling tones:<br />
      <br />
      "Look yere, Missus, you'd better not make no noise now, else
      you's a dead woman, dat's all!"<br />
      <br />
      The diabolical intention of the villain was instantly
      revealed, or rather about to be consummated, for its
      revelation had been cotemporary with my entrance into the
      lodge. Yet what availed my puny strength in the grasp of such
      a giant, or what aid would my shrieks bring me? None
      whatever, for the Indians were too used to hearing the
      outcries of women when beaten by the men. All this rushed
      through my mind, and guided my ensuing action, which was not
      a moment too soon, for, just as I sprang to the opposite side
      of the lodge, my foe was in the very act of clasping me in
      his foul embrace.<br />
      <br />
      "God of mercy, save me!" I breathed in almost a whisper, as I
      bit my tongue and lips in an agony of fear and suspense, and
      kept my wildly staring eyes fixed upon the mulatto.<br />
      <br />
      The latter, enraged that I had thus escaped him, scowled
      fiercely upon me, and, with a bitter oath, made a fresh
      attempt to grasp me. But again I managed to elude him, and
      bounded close to a frame of willow boughs on which were hung
      his shield and trappings, and against which leaned his spear
      and bow. With demon-like rage the monster, on finding himself
      thus foiled twice, leaped toward me, with an agility that
      precluded escape.<br />
      <br />
      At this critical moment, however, and just as I gave myself
      up for lost, a thought struck me like an electric flash, and
      almost involuntarily I seized the keen-pointed spear that
      stood within my reach, and presented it at the breast of my
      antagonist. Both of our motions were so sudden and equally
      timed, that the following instant the spear head was plunged
      up to the pole directly in the heart of my lecherous foe,
      who, with a deep groan, sank dead at my feet.<br />
      <br />
      Never, never shall I forget, nor shall I ever be able truly
      to describe, the feelings the seized me as I looked down upon
      the silent, and now harmless giant, whose herculian arms
      could, a moment previous, have crushed my life out with a
      single effort. For an instant a pang of sorrow wrung my
      heart, and then followed the peculiar sensation, or
      self-conviction, of having shed the blood of a fellow being.
      As though fascinated, I continued to gaze down upon my dead
      foe, the handle of the avenging spear in my hand and the
      blade in his bosom. From this fearful reverie I was at last
      suddenly aroused by a wild scream, and, starting back, I
      beheld the dead man's favorite squaw rush into the hut and
      cast herself wildly down upon the corpse.<br />
      <br />
      I waited no longer; the spell of horror was broken, and,
      uttering a stifled shriek, I bounded from the lodge, and,
      with flying steps gained my own, where I shut myself up,
      expecting every instant to be dragged forth and torn to
      pieces by the infuriated friends of the deceased.<br />
      <br />
      I thought my hour had come when about ten minutes later a
      crowd commenced yellow and hooting and screaming outside my
      retreat. My eyes were closed, and, bowed to earth, I
      commended my soul to its maker. Minute followed minute,
      however, and hour succeeded hour, and yet, though the clamor
      seemed to increase, no one ventured to enter the lodge in
      which I sat trembling and despairing. Matters continued thus
      until the next morning, when, about two hours after sunrise,
      the savages who were collected around my wigwam, suddenly,
      and with a loud shouting, started away to some other point,
      and silence reigned profoundly for sometime after. Then came
      a scarcely audible murmur of human voices at a distance,
      which sound gradually increased in volume until I became
      convinced that the savages were returning. They had been, as
      I subsequently learned, summoned away to meet the war party
      of <i>The Buffalo Horn</i>, who had come back at that
      juncture from his marauding expedition in the plains.<br />
      <br />
      I knew the revengeful dispositions of my wild companions, and
      I was moreover aware of the celebrity of the Chief whom, in
      defence of what was far dearer to me than life, I had, God
      knew, unintentionally slain. And, in this connection, I deem
      it only justice to the Indians, to say, that in their
      primitive state, far removed from the frontier, the crime of
      ravishing captive women, so common and hellish a vice among
      civilized nations, <i>is entirely unknown</i>. This statement
      may dissipate the romance many writers have imparted to their
      stories of the Indians and beautiful white captive maidens,
      but it is nevertheless a fact. An American savage will
      mercilessly butcher white women, but a wild and chivalrous
      honor deters him from ravishing or scalping them.<br />
