      "the scene that ensued" into something like a race riot; mob
      violence against the Chinese was a recurring event in western
      cities like San Francisco and Denver. Harte wrote

        Which I wish to remark,<br />
        And my language is plain,<br />
        That for ways that are dark<br />
        And for tricks that are vain,<br />
        The heathen Chinee is peculiar,<br />
        Which the same I would rise to explain.<br />
        <br />
        Ah Sin was his name;<br />
        And I shall not deny,<br />
        In regard to the same,<br />
        What that name might imply;<br />
        But his smile it was pensive and childlike,<br />
        As I frequent remarked to Bill Nye.<br />
        <br />
        It was August the third,<br />
        And quite soft was the skies;<br />
        Which it might be inferred<br />
        That Ah Sin was likewise;<br />
        Yet he played it that day upon William<br />
        And me in a way I despise.<br />
        <br />
        Which we had a small game,<br />
        And Ah Sin took a hand:<br />
        It was Euchre. The same<br />
        He did not understand;<br />
        But he smiled as he sat by the table,<br />
        With the smile that was childlike and bland.<br />
        <br />
        Yet the cards they were stocked<br />
        In a way that I grieve,<br />
        And my feelings were shocked<br />
        At the state of Nye's sleeve,<br />
        Which was stuffed full of aces and bowers,<br />
        And the same with intent to deceive.<br />
        <br />
        But the hands that were played<br />
        By that heathen Chinee,<br />
        And the points that he made,<br />
        Were quite frightful to see, --<br />
        Till at last he put down a right bower,<br />
        Which the same Nye had dealt unto me.<br />
        <br />
        Then I looked up at Nye,<br />
        And he gazed upon me;<br />
        And he rose with a sigh,<br />
        And said, "Can this be?<br />
        We are ruined by Chinese cheap labor," --<br />
        And he went for that heathen Chinee.<br />
        <br />
        In the scene that ensued<br />
        I did not take a hand,<br />
        But the floor it was strewed<br />
        Like the leaves on the strand<br />
        With the cards that Ah Sin had been hiding,<br />
        In the game "he did not understand."<br />
        <br />
        In his sleeves, which were long,<br />
        He had twenty-four packs, --<br />
        Which was coming it strong,<br />
        Yet I state but the facts;<br />
        And we found on his nails, which were taper,<br />
        What is frequent in tapers, -- that's wax.<br />
        <br />
        Which is why I remark,<br />
        And my language is plain,<br />
        That for ways that are dark<br />
        And for tricks that are vain,<br />
        The heathen Chinee is peculiar, --<br />
        Which the same I am free to maintain.<br />
