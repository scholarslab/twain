      <td>As, for their intrepid boldness and stern truthfulness,
      the exploits and deeds of the old Danish sea-kings, have,
      since the age of Canute, been justly heralded in song and
      story; so now by the world-wide voice of the press, this,
      their descendant, as his name proves him, is brought before
      the world: and as the stern integrity of the exploits and
      deeds of the old Danes in the age of Canute were heralded by
      song and story; so too, in this brief and imperfect memoir,
      are those of one who by name and birthright claims descent
      from them. The subject of the present memoir, Christopher
      Carson, familiarly known under the appellation of Kit Carson,
      is one of the most extraordinary men of the present era. His
      fame has long been established throughout this country and
      Europe, as a most skillful and intrepid hunter, trapper,
      guide and pilot of the prairies and mountains of the far
      West, and Indian fighter. But his celebrity in these
      characters is far surpassed by that of his individual
      personal traits of courage, coolness, fidelity, kindness,
      honor, and friendship. The theatre of his exploits is
      extended throughout the whole western portion of the
      territory of the United States, from the Mississippi to the
      Pacific, and his associates have been some of the most
      distinguished men of the present age, to all of whom he has
      become an object of affectionate regard and marked respect.
      The narrative which follows will show his titles to this
      distinction, so far as his modesty (for the truly brave are
      always modest) has permitted the world to learn anything of
      his history. . . .<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      In his death the country has lost the most noted of that
      intrepid race of mountaineers, trappers, and guides that have
      ever been the pioneers of civilization in its advancement
      westward. As an Indian fighter he was matchless. His rifle,
      when fired at a redskin, never failed him, and the number
      that fell beneath his aim, who can tell! (The identical rifle
      which Carson used in all his scouts, during the last
      thirty-five years of his life, he bequeathed, just previous
      to his death, to Montezuma Lodge, A. F. and A. M., Santa Fe,
      of which he was a member.) The country will always regard him
      as a perfect representative of the American frontiersman, and
      accord to him the most daring valor, consistent kindliness,
      perseverant energy and truthfulness which that whole great
      territory, that we must still regard as lying between the
      civilizations, is capable of furnishing.<br />
