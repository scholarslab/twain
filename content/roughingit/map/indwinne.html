        <b>CHAPTER III: WARS AND THEIR CAUSES</b><br />
        <br />

        <p>I will now stop writing about myself and family and
        tribe customs, and tell about the wars, and the causes of
        the wars. I will jump over about six years. My sister and I
        were living at this time in Genoa with Major Ormsbey's
        family, who took us as playmates for their little girl.
        While with them we learned the English language very fast,
        for they were very kind to us. This was in the year 1858, I
        think; I am not sure. In that year our white brothers had
        their houses all along Carson River. There were twenty-one
        houses there in our country. I know all the names of the
        people that lived in them. One man who was on the upper
        part of Carson River was Mr. Olds; the next man by the name
        of Palmer had a family. The third one, by the name of Job,
        also had a family. Another family was named Walters;
        another man, whose name was Dr. Daggett, had no family; nor
        had the next one, whose name was Van Sickle. The next one
        had more than one family; he had two wives, and his name
        was Thornton. The man who lived in the next house had still
        more wives. There were two brothers; one had three wives,
        and the other five. Their name was Reuse. The next man was
        named Nott, and had no family. The next house had three
        brothers, named Sides, with no families. The next was named
        Gilbert, and had no family. The next was named Alridge, and
        had a family. Then came our friend, Major Ormsbey. Next
        came Adams and brothers, who had no wives. Then Jones and
        family, Miller and family; Brown, with no family; Elsey,
        with no family; Mr. Ellis and family; Williams brothers, no
        family; Mr. Cole and family; Mr. Black and family at
        Humboldt Lake. All these white people were loved by my
        people; we lived there together, and were as happy as could
        be. There was no stealing, no one lost their cattle or
        horses; my People had not learned to steal. We lived that
        way in peace for another year; our white brothers gave my
        People guns for their horses in the way of trading; yet my
        people never said, "We want you to give us something for
        our land." Now, there were a great many of our white
        brothers everywhere through our country, and mines or farms
        here and there. The Mormons came in a great many wagons and
        settled down in Carson Valley, where now stands the great
        Carson City, as it is called. The following year, 1859, we
        were yet living with Major Ormsbey, and mother and father
        were down at Pyramid Lake with all our people, so sister
        and I were all alone there with our dear good friend, Major
        Ormsbey.</p>

        <p>    Late that fall there happened a very sad thing,
        indeed. A white man who was dearly beloved by my people
        started for California to get provisions for the winter, as
        they all did every winter. Mr. McMullen took a great deal
        of money to lay in large supplies, for they had a store
        about thirty miles down Carson River. Two of them,
        MacWilliams and McMullen, went off the same night, and
        camped in the mountains. Some one came in the night and
        killed them both, and after they had shot them with guns or
        pistols, they placed arrows in the wounds to make it appear
        as if Indians had killed them. The next day news came in
        that Indians had killed John McMullen. They were asked how
        they knew that Indians had killed him, and they answered,
        --</p>

        <p>    "We know, because it was done with arrows."</p>

        <p>    That same afternoon thirty men went to get the dead
        bodies of the two men. They brought them in, and the arrows
        too. Of course everybody said it was the Indians that
        killed them. My brother, Natchez, and our cousin, who was
        called young Winnemucca, and one hundred others were sent
        for. In two days' time they came. My brother was then
        peace-chief. Major Ormsbey asked if he knew what tribe of
        Indians those arrows belonged to. My cousin told his white
        brothers the arrows belonged to the Washoes. So our good
        father Major Ormsbey said to my brother, --</p>

        <p>    "Will you help us to get the Washoe chief to come in
        and give up the men who killed the two white men?" My
        brothers said they would help to find the men that killed
        poor John McMullen. So that evening my people had what they
        call a war-dance, the first one I had ever seen. A great
        many white men and women came to see them, and Lizzie
        Ormsbey kept saying, "Where is Natchez?" He was dressed up
        so we did not know him. The white people staid until it was
        all over, and when it was all over the Major called his men
        and said, --</p>

        <p>    "We will sing the Star-spangled Banner."</p>

        <p>    It was not a bit like the way my grandfather used to
        sing it, and that was the first time I had heard it sung by
        the white people.</p>

        <p>    My cousin was the war-chief. He sent five men to
        bring in the Washoe chief. The next morning they came in
        with about ten Washoes. As soon as they came in the white
        men gathered round them. Major Ormsbey showed the arrows,
        and asked them if they knew them. The Washoe chief, who is
        called Jam, said, "You ask me if these are my people's
        arrows. I say yes." Major Ormsbey said, --</p>

        <p>    "That is enough." He said to my brother Natchez,
        --</p>

        <p>    "Tell Captain Jam that his people have killed two
        men, and he must bring the men and all the money, and they
        shall not be hurt, and all will be right." The Washoe chief
        said, --</p>

        <p>    "I know my people have not killed the men, because
        none of my men have been away; we are all at Pine-nut
        Valley, and I do not know what to think of the sad thing
        that has happened."</p>

        <p>    "But here are your arrows, and you cannot say
        anything," said my cousin, the war-chief. "We will give you
        ten days to bring the men who killed our two white
        brothers, and if you do not we shall have to fight you, for
        they have been so kind to us all. Who could have the heart
        to kill them? Now go and bring in the men."</p>

        <p>    Poor, poor Washoes, they went away with very sad
        hearts. After they left brother talked with all his men,
        and asked them what they thought about it. They all said it
        was very strange, indeed; time would tell whether they
        killed them or not. Six days after, the Washoe chief came
        in with three prisoners. One of the prisoners had a wife,
        the other two had none, but their mothers came with them.
        The white men gathered round them and put handcuffs on them
        to lock them up in a small house for the night. Next
        morning all the white people came to see them. Some said,
        "Hang the red devils right off," and the white boys threw
        stones at them, and used most shameful language to them. At
        about three o'clock in the afternoon came thirty-one white
        men, all with guns on their shoulders, and as they marched
        along my brother and cousin ran to meet them. One Washoe
        woman began to scream, "Oh, they have come to kill them!"
        How they did cry! One could hear the poor things miles
        away. My brother went to them and told them not to cry.</p>

        <p>    "Oh, dear chieftain, they did not kill the white
        men,--indeed they did not. They have not been away from our
        camp for over a month. None of our men were away, and our
        chief has given these three young men because they have no
        fathers." One of the young girls said, --</p>

        <p>    "You who are the mighty chieftain, save my poor
        brother, for he is all mother and I have to hunt for us.
        Oh, believe us. He is as innocent as you are. Oh, tell your
        white brothers that what we tell you is true as the sun
        rises and sets;" and one woman ran to my cousin, the
        war-chief, and threw herself down at his feet and cried
        out, "Oh, you are going to have my poor husband killed. We
        were married this winter, and I have been with him
        constantly since we were married. Oh, Good Spirit, come!
        Oh, come into the hearts of this people. Oh, whisper in
        their hearts that they may not kill my poor husband! Oh,
        good chief, talk for him. Our cruel chief has given my
        husband to you because he is afraid that all of us will be
        killed by you," and she raised up her head and said to the
        Washoe chief, "You have given my innocent blood to save
        your people." Then my brother said to the Washoes, "These
        white men have come to take the three Washoe men who killed
        John McMullen and MacWilliams to California to put them in
        jail."</p>

        <p>    Just then one of the women cried out, "Look there,
        they have taken them out. See, they are taking them away."
        We were all looking after them, and before brother got near
        them the three prisoners broke and ran. Of course they were
        shot. Two were wounded, and the third ran back with his
        hands up. But all of them died.</p>

        <p>    Oh, such a scene I never thought I should see! At
        daybreak all the Washoes ran to where they were killed. The
        wife of the young man threw herself down on his dead body.
        Such weeping was enough to make the very mountains weep to
        see them. They would take the dead bodies in their arms,
        and they were all bloody themselves. I ran to Mrs. Ormsbey
        crying. I thought my poor heart would break. I said to her,
        "I believe those Washoe women. They say their men are all
        innocent. They say they were not away from their camp for a
        long time, and how could they have been the men that killed
        the white men?" I told her all I had heard the women say,
        and I said I believed them. Mrs. Ormsbey said, --</p>

        <p>    "How came the Washoe arrows there? and the chief
        himself has brought them to us, and my husband knows what
        he is doing."</p>

        <p>    I ran back to see what they were going to do with
        the dead bodies, as I had heard my people say that the
        Washoes were like the Digger Indians, who burn their dead.
        When I got there the Washoe chief was talking to my
        brother. I did not know what he said before I came, but I
        know from what I heard that he had been making confession.
        He said, pointing down to the men that were innocently
        killed, --</p>

        <p>    "It is true what the women say,--it is I who have
        killed them. Their blood is on my hands. I know their
        spirits will haunt me, and give me bad luck while I
        live."</p>

        <p>    This was what the Washoe chief said to my brother.
        The one that was wounded also died, and the sister and the
        mother it was dreadful to see. The mother cried out, --</p>

        <p>    "Oh, may the Good Spirit send the same curse upon
        you ! You may all live to see the day when you will suffer
        at the hands of your white brothers, as you call them." She
        said to her girl, --</p>

        <p>    "My child, you have no brother now,--no one to love
        you, no one to come with game and say, 'Here, sister, here
        is game for you.' You are left all alone. Oh, my sweet
        son,--gone, gone!"</p>

        <p>    This was the first trouble the poor Washoes had with
        white people, and the only one they ever did have with
        them.</p>

        <p>    So the day passed away, and the two dead Washoes
        were taken away, and their bodies were burned. That is
        their custom. The other was taken to California. My poor
        little sister made herself sick she cried so much that
        day.</p>

        <p>    Two days afterwards Major Ormsbey sent his men home;
        so he did my cousin, who is called young Winnemucca, and
        brother staid longer for us, because we had been with Major
        Ormsbey a long time, and we could talk very well. My poor
        little sister was so very sick it was two weeks before we
        could go to our mother. When we got home it was winter.
        There was so much snow that we staid in the mountains where
        now stands the great city called Virginia City. It was then
        our Pine-nut mountains. Some time during the winter the
        Washoe chief came and told us that the white men who killed
        McMullen and MacWilliams were caught. My brother Natchez
        said, --</p>

        <p>    "Oh, have they been caught?" "Yes, that is what
        Major Ormsbey said; so did all the others." The Washoe
        chief went on and said, "I have come to ask you to pay me
        for the loss of the two men. The white men have brought
        back the other men, and they say that they have hung two
        men." My brother told the Washoe chief that his people had
        nothing to do with what the white people had done. "It is
        you who ought to pay the poor mother and sister and wife of
        your own tribe, because you gave them up yourself,
        therefore you must not blame us. We only did our duty, and
        we all know that the white men did nothing to us, and we
        did no more than what they would do for us." . . .</p>
