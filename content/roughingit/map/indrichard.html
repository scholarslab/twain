        supported by a post and flanked by an empty cask, stood a
        Noble Red Man. Indifferent to his tattered clothing, which
        afforded no protection from the sharp, wintry nights --
        with his long black locks flying in the wind -- his whole
        soul was wrapped in a whisky bottle. He regarded it with a
        fixed stare, in which satisfaction at the quality of its
        contents and pensive regret at their diminishing quantity
        were ludicrously blended. Mr. Cooper died too early. I
        think one glimpse at <i>this</i> Aboriginal would have
        saved his pen much labor, and early American literature
        many Indian heroes.</p>
