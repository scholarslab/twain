<center>A LETTER FROM LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHERIDAN.</center>
<p> &nbsp; The following letter was received from Lieutenant General Sheridan as this volume was about going to press. The author is induced to publish it, in this connection, in view of its accord with his own views expressed on the Indian policy.</p>
<center>HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE<br> MISSOURI, CHICAGO, ILLS., April 28, 1870.</center>
<i>Mr. De B. Randolph Keim.</i><br>
<p> &nbsp; DEAR SIR: I have carefully read the proof-sheets sent me of your forthcoming book, (Sheridan's Troopers on the Borders,) and 
think well of it.</p>
<p> &nbsp; I may say in reference to the management of Indiana, the reservation system is the only one offering any prospects of success, but all experience has shown that the wild Indian will not adopt it until he is forced to do so. All the tribes on the Northern Pacific coast had to be subdued and forced on the reservations, which was accomplished between the years 1855 1860.	Then peace ensued.  Latterly the same policy has been pursued in regard to the Comanches, Kiowas, Cheyennes, and Arrapahoes.</p>
<p> &nbsp; After the wild Indians are put upon the reservations a strong military force will lmve to be kept there to protect the agents and others required in the work of civilization, and also for the subordination of the Indiana, and their protection against the encroachments of the white settlers, who otherwise would take possession of their lands.</p>
<center>Very truly, yours,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; P. H. SHERIDAN,<br>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

<center><font size=+1>PREFACE.</font></center>
<p>CIVILIZATION extending in opposite directions, Westward
 across the great Valley of the Mississippi, and Eastward traversing the auriferous regions of the Rocky Mountains, presents two extensive fields of American Industry, approximating each other, and demanding a more convenient and rapid intercourse.	Railways and Telegraphs have boldly pengtrated the solitude of the Plains, and the wild Passes of the Mountains reverberate to the rumble of moving trains. The two oceans are already linked together by an Iron Highway.  The savage, alarmed at this new encroachment, is ready at any moment for a desperate, 
 probably a final effort to drive out the invaders of his hunting-grounds. Fearful of his future he opposes such 
 encroachments, for in them he sees no benefit to the remnant of his race, who have taken refuge on the plains and in the mountains.</p>
<p> &nbsp; The struggle has come, to solve, for all time, the question whether the white or the red man shall prevail in the vast intermediate region between Eastern and Western civilization.  
The exigencies of modern civilization point to the inevitable 
doom of the aboriginal people of the United States.  Their savage natures, incapable of restraint, render them by instinct foes to progress and the cause of humanity. As with the buffalo the approach of civilization is to them the knell of destruction. 
 As the murderous bullet of the white hunter ruthlessly 
slaughters the buffalo, so the vices of civilization carry off those of the red men who have outlived their kindred.</p>
<p> &nbsp; The following chapters contain a narrative of more than six months spent on the Southern Plains, observing the operations 
of the army personally directed by Major, now Lieutenant General 
Sheridan against the refractory savage on the Republican, the 
Arkansas and the Washita.</p>

<b>[From Chapter 31]</b><br><br>

<p> &nbsp; The traveler on the plains often meets with cairns upon the summit of hills--large stones arranged in peculiar forms--and pits of singular fashion. Aside from these and the great 
medicine-lodge, the progenitors of the wild tribes of the plains have lived, killed the buffalo, scalped their fallen foe, and set out upon the spirit of a horse for the happy hunting-ground, with out leaving a trace of their existence.  No curious remains, as encountered in the early seats of the Creeks, in the south, or the Delawares and the Shawnees, in the valleys of the Scioto and Muskingum, are to be found.	Like the Beduin of the desert, upon his fleet steed the American savage has galloped over the plains, from the Missouri to the Rocky mountains, without fixed haunts, or a solitary spot which he might claim as particularly his own.  The antiquarian will search in vain
for the momuments of this vanishing race.  That this people ever existed, will, in a few brief years, be known only from the page of history!</p>

<br>


<b>[From] CHAPTER XXXVIII.  The Administration of Indian Affairs.</b>
<br><br>
BEFORE bringing this narrative to a close, I desire to incorporate a few facts and reflections concerning the past and the future of the American Indian.  It was
natural that the presence, and particularly the aggressive 
spirit of the early settlers, should inspire in the breasts of the primitive dwellers upon the American continent a feeling of suspicion, uneasiness, and hostility.  Occurrences so visibly opposed to their interests and safety, were calculated to effect the results which followed, involving upon the one hand a conflict for the perpetuation of race, and the preservation 
of tribal hunting-grounds, upon the other territorial acquisitions, 
to make way for the building up of a new and modern civilization, in the wilds of a new world.	Over three centuries
have elapsed.  This has been a period of bloody, and desperate wars, and horrible atrocities.  Whether the savage is to blame for his natural aversion to civilized habits, and the sanguinary part he has acted, or whether the superior white race is open to censure for the means too often resorted to for the acquisition of the vast territory to-day under its control, is a question now too late for consideration. What remains of this aboriginal people within the limits of the United States, is left to the alternative of civilization or rapid extinction.  The spread of population, art and science, will not wait for the slow process
which characterized the eflorts of a century or less ago.  The two conditions of the savage, and the enlightened of the species cannot live peaceably, and with equal prosperity, together. While this is a deplorable element of human intercourse, the weaker must give way to the stronger. . . .</p>
<br>

<p> &nbsp; The total Indian population, now living within the limits of the United States, is less than three hundred thousand. Of these about seventy-six thousand are found within the limits of civilization, while very nearly three times that number, or over two hundred and nineteen thousand, inhabit the plains
and Rocky mountains.  Both these regions, less inviting to the husbandman, or undeveloped, respecting their mineral wealth, have become the last point of refuge for the race.</p>
<p> &nbsp; The Indians, in their new resorts, have found facilities for pursuing their wild habits, and trusting to the natural defences thrown around them, experience, at least, that temporary respite from harrassing and depleting wars, inspired in defence of their hunting-grounds, and retaliated by the whites from necessity and protection against the horrible outrages which belong to savage warfare.</p>
<p> &nbsp; The Indian question now comes up in its latest phase, 
and is brought to a final issue. For more than twenty years an 
exclusively civil administration has been tried, and in no instance, when the whole subject has been investigated, do we find a single act which has advanced the savage materially above his primitive condition.	A gigantic system of pauperism has been
inaugurated, in which the savage has reaped the least share of the benefits. . . . </p>
<br>

<p> &nbsp; Again, we find a deplorable lack of knowledge or true 
interpretation of Indian character. As a race, the condition in which we find the American Indian of to-day, is not one step above his condition three centuries ago.	If any change have taken place, it has been for the worse.  Influenced by the most absurd and enacting superstitions, with a spirit incapable of the restraints 
of a regular mode of living, with no ambition above the acquisition of scalps, as an evidence of valor and the accumulation 
of ponies, or other objects of Indian value, as constituting wealth, with no conception of the uses of money, with no law, save that of custom, bowing to no authority but that vested in the voice of the tribe, treacherous in his intercourse with others, depending upon the chase for food, and in most instances, for a rude covering for his body, we have the American Indian as we really find him.  A savage, by nature, he persists in leading 
the live of a savage.	He delights in scenes of blood, and spoils wrung from his neighbors, serve him as the road to
 fortune. . . .</p>
<br>
<b>[From] Chapter XXXIX.  The Administration of Indian Affairs 
Continued.</b><br><br>

<p> &nbsp; A review of our Indian difficulties shows, also, that the Indian has been treated frequently with the greatest injustice and falsehood. It is natural, as he sees his race declining in numbers, his former hunting-grounds annually growing less to make way for the settler, that he should feel sad in spirit. Acknowledging the stern necessities which surround him, either by force or compensation, he yields up his lands. In exchange he was to receive certain annuities.  The government failed to perform its obligations.  The money was appropriated, yet the poor savage complained that "their agents lie; they get nothing, and are forced to resort to war to save themselves from ruin." They invade the settlements. These settlements, they say, are upon their own lands, and they want to drive the white man away.	This is natural, because the government promised, but
failed, to pay them for their lands; therefore they are going to fight to get their lands back.  This is the Indian's argument. The secret of the majority of wars, though the blame is attributed 
to the whites in general, is, in reality, the fault of mismanagement. 
 Where the settler goes beyond the legitimate limits of the government title, he exposes himself to consequences which should receive no sympathy, and be recognized as the punishment which he deserves for a violation of the faith which the government agreed to keep.  But to say that the whites are to blame for acts which have been indisputably, the logical results of faulty administration, is a charge which grossly 
misrepresents that hardy, adventurous, and industrious class of our population, who sacrifice the comforts and security of established 
society to open the way to the peaceful industries. . . . </p>
<br>

<p> &nbsp; We have seen that the Indian can only be controlled by force. This being the case it is certain that no administration, to be effective, can be enforced without the co-operation of the army.	And in many respects the army recommends itself as
more competent than the civil power.  The army combines executive functions with the capacity to exact compliance. No one would believe, for a moment, that the army would wantonly exercise unnecessary severity.</p>
<p> &nbsp; It is an historical fact that, for year after year, expeditions have been sent against the Indians, to be defeated by the intrigues 
of the agents of the government.</p>
<p> &nbsp; Refractory bands have been punished, and the 
government, at the instance of its agents, has reimbursed them 
for their losses at a vast outlay of the public money. An act of 
obedience on the part of one branch of the public service has invariably been denounced as a fiendish and atrocious massacre of innocent 
people by the other.	 The savage, it is undeniable, must be kept in certain localities.  Contact with the whites is a sure precursor of extermination by disease, chronic inebriation, or drunken brawls.  His days of unrestrained freedom upon his
native plains is a thing of the past.  When the wild Indian understands that on the reservation means peace, and outside of it war, the government may look for quiet, and the settler on the frontiers for perfect security.	Then the large hearts and affluence of the humanitarians of the nation would be able, with an assurance of safety, to put into practice the benevolent intentions,  
which might, at least lessen, if they could not conquer,
the savage instincts of the Indian.  Upon the reservation the
Indian would be accessible and a safe one to meet.  Upon the plain to find him would be the toil of months, and when found
his hospitality would be uncertain.  Restrained in his longing for war, by the fear of punishment, the red man might find
some object in bettering his condition.  The issue to be solved is the preservation of what remains of the Indian race by an administration which he fears, or a continued warring against him, brought on by his own acts, and the encroachments of the settlers, both the natural result of an authority without a head to reason or arms to strike.</p>

OUTLAWS

<b>[From] Chapter VII.  A Night in a Frontier Town.</b><br><br>

<p> &nbsp; Sheridan compared very favorably with other plains
 towns.  It contained a population of one hundred and fifty souls, and from accounts all were desperate characters. After the suspension 
of work on the railroad, the population, which at one time was much larger, suddenly diminished.   Frequently the citizens were put to great straits to secure a maintenance. Many lived by poisoning wolves and selling the skins, for which they realized a dollar, or a dollar and a half, each, according 
to size.  It was hardly the proper season for this work, although parties were engaged in it, and found no difficulty in disposing of their stock.	I was told by one person that in the winter he could make from seventy-five to a hundred and fifty dollars per month out of the wolf skins he could secure.  The wolf family is rather large on the plains, and a liberal application of strychnine evidently would not be seriously felt for some time to come.</p>

<p> &nbsp; Ten o'clock in the evening I discovered was the 
regular hour for the public entertainments to begin, which consisted 
of a skirmish with pistols, or a aeries of pugilistic encounters, in which it rarely happened that both parties come off with their lives, or at least without receiving a damaging and indelible
remembrance of the contest. I had already heard fearful stories of the "quiet and orderly" town of Sheridan, and, as much as possible, kept clear of the streets from fear of some stray pistol ball, by mistake, finding a lodgment in my own person.</p>
<p> &nbsp; The week before, the Sheridanites, according to their own accounts, had had "a beautiful time."  During that week six  men had been shot in drunken brawls.  On the Sabbath night the honor of two more specimens was brought into antagonism over the flowing bowl.  Pistols were produced, and the " popular 
tragedy" opened.  One was mortally wounded. The other set out with a view to escape.  He was closely pursued. The pursuers fired repeatedly, which was responded to by the fugitive.  After a lively chase and considerable firing the pursued 
was overtaken. He fought desperately, but without avail. A rope was procured; one end was fastened around the victim's neck, the other to a cross-tie in the tressel railroad bridge at the town.  The victim was then forcibly ejected between the ties into space below, and was there left to shuffle off this mortal coil; which was more readily done than to shuffle off the coil which had been prepared for him by his peculiarly justice-loving fellow-citizens.</p>
<br><br><br><br>
BUFFALOS
<b>[From] Chapter II.  Beyond the Pale of Civilization.</b><br><br>

<p> &nbsp; As daylight dawned on our way towards Fort Hays, 
several dark indefinable spots on the horizon were pointed out as small herds of buffalo.  They were entirely too far distant to enable us to make a minute examination of the monstrous beast.  We who had never yet had the pleasure of feasting our eyed upon a live buffalo, excepting some unfortunate representative of the species in a menagerie, were left at least to the gratifying reflection 
that we had some evidence that there were buffaloes in the country and that such an animal had an existence, and we a very good prospect of verifying the fact.</p>

<p> &nbsp; It was not long before several shots fired from the 
window of the forward car created some excitement. As the savages had appeared in sight of the railroad several days before, each man seized his rifle which he loaded and kept near at hand ready for a brush. In the car in which I was seated I observed twenty-five stand of arms, breech-loading rifles, and a large
chest of metallic centre primed needle-cartridges, provided by 
 
the railroad company, for the use of the employees to defend their trains against Indian attacks.</p>
<p> &nbsp; As soon as the firing commenced several of the train men rushed into the car in which I was seated, snatched a rifle from the rack, rammed a couple of handsful of cartridges in their pockets and darted back again into the forward car.</p>

<p> &nbsp; At this juncture as I thought things were getting serious 
I re-examined my own rifle, buckled on a pair of pistols, slung my cartridge box over my shoulder and started forward to look into the cause of all the commotion. At this moment a shout "Buffalo crossing the track" was heard and bang! bang! bang!  simultaneously went several pieces.  Poking my head out of the car window I observed a small herd of six buffalo bulls running
 at full speed parallel with the train, about a hundred yards ahead and not more than sixty feet from the track.  The stupid animals seemed bent upon crossing, but finding the locomotive pursuing too closely, at the last moment turned and attempted to get out of reach.	While the pursuit was going on, a number
of shots were fired but without effect.  As the herd left the
track, the engineer slackened the speed of the train.  A fusilade
now began in earnest.  Each person vied with the other in firing
the most shots.  Two of the animals were wounded, one mortally.  
The locomotive whistled "down breaks."  Without waiting for the train to stop every one, engineer, conductor, brakesman and passengers, leaving only the fireman, jumped off the cars and gave chase.  The wounded buffalo still on his feet, with great effort was trying to make his escape.	He had been shot in the thigh and though retarded, made good progress, when another ball taking effect in the other leg, let his hind-quarters down upon the ground.  Nothing daunted the wounded animal made every exertion to drag himself off, on his two fore feet, when a ball tinder the shoulder put an end to his sufferings and his efforts to rejoin his companions.  A cheer wound up the railroad chase, when the busy knives of "professionals" in hipjoint operations, soon had the "rumps" severed and after cutting 
out the tongues and a few strips of "hump" the rest of the
two immense carcasses were left as a dainty and abundant repast 
for the wolf.	The meat was put on the train, and again we continued our journey.  Both the animals killed were bulls, and, judging  from the rings on their horns and their long shaggy manes, had already outlived the ordinary life-time of their species.</p>

<br>
<hr width="55%">
<br>
<b>[From] Chapter VI.  Immense Herds of Buffaloes.</b><br><br>

<p>We had hardly proceeded fifteen miles on our journey when we came in sight of several large herds of buffaloes, each 
numbering not less than two thousand animals. We were promised a  "wonderful sight" of the beast by the conductor of the train. Indeed, so marvelous were his stories that he was listened to with evident incredulity.</p>

<p> &nbsp; As we increased the distance from the last settlement, 
buffaloes rapidly grew in numbers. Thirty miles on the way the country was literally overrun. The main herds lay on the northern side of the track and as far as the eye could reach, not less than a distance of ten to fifteen miles, the plain was perfectly black with them.	The herds nearest the track, alarmed at the strange sounds issuing from the locomotive, set off at a rapid lope, heading towards the north, in turn setting in motion the herds before them.  The huge animals raised such a dust that for some minutes it was impossible to see more than a long line of hind-quarters and elevated tails.	A number of isolated smaller herds which had crossed to the south upon the approach of the train, invariably raised their heads, looked at us for an instant, and then with heads down and tails up galloped towards the track making extraordinary exertions to get across ahead of the locomotive.	In trying this strategic feat one specimen found himself forcibly lifted into the air and thrown into the ditch, where he lay upon his back, his cloven feet flourishing madly.</p>

<p> &nbsp; Several animals had been shot from the cars out of this 
herd. The train now stopped to afford time to bring in a few "rumps." While this operation was going on, a party of six or eight of us started down the track to dispatch the buffalo, still kicking and bellowing with a mixture of suspense and rage, displaying
certain serpentine and spasmodic motions of the dorsal column, which indicated an effort to get on his feet. When our party got within fifty yards a shot was fired at the animal which
seemed to have a peculiarly vitalizing effect.  At all events it called the buffalo to a sense of his ludicrous and unnatural 
position.  With one desperate effort the old beast regained his feet. Several more shots were instantly fired, but none seemed to take effect.	Instead of retreating the irate quadruped made for our party, coming at a "full jump" head down, tongue out, bleeding and frothing at the mouth, eyes flashing, and to cap the climax of his terrible exhibitions of infuriation, roared fearfully.  As there was no time to lose, and to fire at him "head on" would be but a waste of ammunition, the party scattered in all directions.  
For my own part, I took occasion to make a few long and rapid strides across the track into the ditch on the other side.  The rest of the party imitated this dexterous movement without many moments of reflection.  Losing sight of us, the enraged animal, smarting under the blow he had received from the locomotive, and the tickling he had sustained from our rifles, reaped his anger upon the opposite aide of the embankment of the railroad by rending great furrows in the earth, stamping on the ground, raising a great dust, and making a terrible noise. It was very certain there was no time to waste.	Should his
 lordship of the plains spy any of us he would doubtless renew
the offensive.  Raising up so as to get a partial sight of his carcass, not over thirty feet off,  three of our party fired, the rest holding in reserve.	Every ball seemed to take effect.	Almost
instantly the animal fell upon his knees.	The rest then fired,
when the animal rolled completely over.	His tenacity of life
waa perfectly wônderful.	By this time he must have had a dozen bullets in his body.	Notwithstanding all this he 
struggled and swayed to and fro until he again brought himself to his feet.  But all power to harm had fled.	Planting himself firmly, moving his head to the right and left, his eye still full of fire, the noble beast looked even more defiant.  From his nostrils ran streams of blood.</p>

<p> &nbsp; To put the animal ont of misery was the first sense of 
recovery from our stampede.  Repeated shots were fired into his body.	Thug, thug, the bullets could be heard penetrating his thick hide.  As each ball entered, a slight turn of the head and switch of the tail were the only external indications of the effect of the bullet.	At length after having been literally "peppered" with lead, a sudden quiver passed over the animal'a entire frame, he staggered and fell.  One deep gasp, a convulsive motion of the jaws, one sudden flash of the eye, a quantity of dark clotted blood ejected from the nostrils, and the buffalo was dead.</p>

<p> &nbsp; Never before had I seen such an exhibition of
 tenacious rage and vitality. Had the animal been less injured by the 
 locomotive, it would be difficult to say what would have been the result of his charge upon our party. It is a question, however, whether a buffalo would attack from the mere impulse of 
destruction.	I have found the buffalo, compared with his remarkable physical strength, rather disposed to be timid.	Several 
horsemen could ride into the midst of a herd of ten thousand with comparative safety, select their game and dispatch it; but when wounded the whole nature of the animal seems changed.  He turns upon his pursuers, and death it is to him who ever falls into his power.  Not satisfied with goring his victim until he  is a mangled mass, he frequently plunges upon the remains until mashed into a perfect jelly.	The vital spot in a buffalo is 
immediately under the shoulder, penetrating the heart or the lights. On the forehead the bullet of the most powerful rifle has no effect whatever, the force being entirely expended on the 
immense mat or "mop" of hair, eight or ten inches in length, between the eyes.</p>
<p> &nbsp; After our somewhat exciting battle, taking a last look, and I must say I felt a pang of shame as I left the inanimate carcass a useless waste, we hastened back to the train which was ready to move on and had been signaling us for some minutes.</p>
<br>
<b>[From] Chapter XI.  An Old Fashioned Buffalo Hunt.</b><br><br>

<p> &nbsp; There is something majestic and formidable in the 
appearance of a buffalo. It is therefore not surprising that but few horses will readily approach sufficiently near to enable the hunter to make a close shot.	Some horses rebel, notwithstanding every effort to allay their alarm.  Others, by a proper course of 
training, carry their riders, without any direction, into just the 
position desirable.  Such an animal is a treasure in the esteem of a plainsman.  He talks about his  "buffalo horse" with more pride than be would of himself, had he accomplished a feat ever so wonderful.  It was interesting to watch the movements of
the trained horse.  He approached the buffalo rapidly but 
cautiously.  His eyes were steadily fixed upon the animal and watched every motion.  Should the buffalo expedite his pace, the horse did likewise, regulating his increased rate of speed so as to get alongside without unnecessarily alarming the animal. As the horse came abreast, the buffalo naturally swayed his course away to the right or left.  This was the dangerous part
of the chase.	Should the buffalo after moving away, the horse following, turn suddenly, a collision would be almost certain.
This the horse seemed to know so perfectly that he changed direction on a long turn. After firing, should the animal fall, the horse kept up his speed, described a circle bringing him back to the carcass of the dead or wounded buffalo.</p>

<p> &nbsp; Timid horses and awkward riders run great risk of their lives by not knowing how to avoid any hostile demonstrations on the part of the buffalo.	The latter has the advantage, and by not
keeping a close watch, fatal results are sure to occur.	An old hunter, mounted on a "buffalo horse," in every sense of the term, dashing fearlessly across the plain in pursuit of this truly magnificent game, presents a picture the very culmination of manly sport.</p>

<b>[From] Chapter XII.  Popular Buffalo Hunt.</b><br><br>

<p> &nbsp; The following announcement of an excursion I found at 
one of the railroad stations. I give a copy of it as one of the peculiar and progressive innovations made by the railways.</p>
<br>
<center>RAILWAY EXCURSION<br>
<font size=-1>AND</font><br>
BUFFALO HUNT.</center>
<p> &nbsp; An excursion train will leave Leavenworth, at 8 a. m. and Lawrence, at 10 a. m. for</p>
<center>SHERIDAN,</center>
<p> &nbsp; On Tuesday, October 27, 1868, and return on Friday.</p>
<p> &nbsp; This train will stop at the principal stations both going and returning.</p>
<p> &nbsp; Ample time will be had for a grand Buffalo</p>
<center>HUNT ON THE PLAINS.</center>
<p> &nbsp; Buffaloes are so numerous along the road that they
 are shot from the cars nearly every day. On our last excursion our party killed twenty buffaloes in a hunt of six hours.
All passengers can have refreshments on the cars at reasonable prices.</p>
<p> &nbsp; Tickets of round trip from Leavenworth, $10.00.</p>
<p> &nbsp; The inducements, at these rates, to any one anxious
 to visit the plains, and see a live buffalo, and perhaps a "live injun," not so acceptable at that time, were certainly very tempting, as the full expense of the above trip, at the regular rate of fare, would not have been short of seventy dollars. A quarter of a century hence, the buffalo and the Indian will have entirely disappeared from the line of the railways.  The few that still survive will have then been driven to the most remote, 
inaccessible, and uninhabitable sections, if not entirely exterminated.</p>
