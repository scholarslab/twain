BUFFALO LAND

<b>[From] Chapter I.</b><br><br>

<p> &nbsp; The old Indian love of commemorating events by significant names is well illustrated in Kansas. One example may be given here. Waukarusa once opposed 
its swollen tide to an exploring band of red men.	Now, from time beyond ken, the noble savage has been illustrious for the ingenuity with which he lays all disagreeable duties upon the shoulders of the patient squaw.  He may ride to their death, in free wild sport, the bison multitudes; but their skins
must be converted into marketable robes, and the flesh into jerked meat, by the ugly and over-worked partner of his bosom. While she pins the raw hide to earth, and bends patiently over, fleshing it with horn hatchet for weary hours, the stronger vessel, his abdominal recesses wadded with buffalo meat, toasts his moccasined feet by the fire, fills his lungs with smoke from villainous killikinick, and muses 
soothingly of white scalps and happy hunting grounds.</p>
<p> &nbsp; 
Ox-like maiden, happy "big injun!" you both 
belong to an age and a history well nigh past, and let us rejoice that it is so.</p>

<p> &nbsp; But to return to the band long since gathered into aboriginal dust whom we left pausing on the banks of the Waukarusa. "Deep water, bad bottom!" grunted the braves, and, nothing doubting it, 
one loving warrior pushed his wife and her pony over the bank to test the matter.  From the middle of the tide the squaw called back, "Waukarusa" (thigh deep), and soon had gained the opposite bank in safety.  Then and there the creek received its name, "Waukarusa."</p>

<p> &nbsp; We procured a remarkable sketch, in the well known Indian style of high art, commemorative of this event. It has always struck us that the savage order of drawing resembles very much that of the ancient Egyptian--except in the matter of drawing at sight, with bow or rifle, on the white man.</p>

<b>[From] Chapter VI.</b><br><br>
<p> &nbsp; . . . So far along our route we had seen but 
few Indians, and those civilized specimens, such as straggle 
occasionally through the streets of Topeka.  The Indian 
reservations in Kansas are at some 
distance apart, and their inhabitants frequently 
exchange visits. The few whom we had seen consisted of Osages, Kaws, Pottawatomies, and Sioux, all equally dirty, but the last affecting clothes more than the others, and eschewing paint.	The members of this tribe, generally speaking, have good farms and are worth a handsome average per head. At the time of our visit they were expecting a half million dollars or so from Washington, and were soon to 
become American citizens.	One privilege of this 
citizenship struck us as very peculiar.  By the State law, as long as an Indian is simply an Indian, he can buy no whisky, and is thus cruelly debarred from the privilege of getting drunk, but once a voter, he can luxuriate in corn juice and the calaboose, as well as his white brother. What a travesty upon American civilization and politics!</p>

<p> &nbsp; Sachem produced a roll of dirty brown paper and said that he had studied the Indian question and found two sides to it. One he could give us in a 
nutshell, believing that the meat of the nut had often excited the spirit of war.</p>

<b>[From] Chapter IX.  Arrival at [Fort] Hays.</b><br><br>
<p> &nbsp; The post possessed considerable military 
importance, being the base of operations for the Indian country.  We found Sheridan there, an officer who won his fame gallantly and on the gallop.  During the summer our red brethren had been gathering a harvest of scalps, and, in return, our army was now preparing to gather in the gentle savage.</p>
<p> &nbsp; We had read accounts in the newspapers, some time before, of the capture of Fort Wallace and of 
attacks on military posts.	Such stories were not only untrue; but exceedingly ridiculous as well.  Lo is not sound on the assault question.  His chivalrous soul warms, however, when some forlorn Fenian, with spade on shoulder and thoughts far off with Biddy

in Erin's Isle, crosses his vision. Being satisfied that Patrick has no arms, his only defense being 
utter harmlessness, and well knowing that the sight of a painted skin, rendered sleek by boiled dog's meat, will make him frantic with terror, the soul of the 
noble savage expands. No more shall the spade, held so jauntily, throw Kansas soil on the bed of the 
Pacific Railroad; and the scalp, yet tingling with the boiling of incipient Fenian revolutions underneath, on the pole of a distant wigwam will soon gladden the eyes of the traditionally beautiful Indian bride, as with dirty hands she throws tender puppies into the pot for her warrior's feast.  The savage hand, 
crimson since childhood, descends with defiant ring upon the tawny breast, and, with a cry of, "Me big Indian, ha, whoop!" down sweeps Lo upon the defenseless 
Hibernian.  A startled stare, a shriek of wild agony, a 
hurried prayer to "our Mary mother," and Erin's son christens those far-off points of the Pacific Railroad with his blood.  A rapid circle of hunting-knife and the scalp is lifted, a few twangs of the bow fills the body with arrows, there is a rapid vault into the saddle, and a mutilated corpse, with feathered tips, like pins in a cushion, dotting its surface, alone 
remains to tell the tale of horror.</p>
<p> &nbsp; Blood had been every-where on the railroad, which reached across the plains like a steel serpent spotted with red. There was now a cessation of hostilities, and Indian agents were reported to be on the way from Washington to pacify the tribes.  As they had been a long time in coming, the inference was 
irresistible that the popping of champagne corks was a
much more pleasant experience than that of Indian guns would have been. The harvest of scalps had reached high noon some time before. Far off, south of the Arkansas, the savages had their home, and from thence, like baleful will-o'-the-wisps, they would suddenly flash out, and then flash back when 
pursued, and be lost in those remote regions. Lately, United States troops have been so placed that the Indian villages may be struck, if necessary, and 
retaliation had; and this, together with the pacificatory efforts of the Quaker agents, is doing much to bring about a condition of things which promises permanent peace.</p>

<br>
<hr width="55%">
<br>
<p> &nbsp; The evening before our departure we rode over 
to the fort and called upon General Sheridan. . . . </p>

<p> &nbsp; We found the General thoroughly conversant with the difficult task to which he had been called.  "Place the Indians on reservations," he said, "under their own chiefs, with an honest white superintendency. Let the civil law reign on the reservation, military law away from it, every Indian found by the troops off from his proper limits to be treated as an outlaw."  It seemed to me that in a few brief sentences this mapped out a successful Indian policy, part of which indeed has since been adopted, and the remainder may yet be.</p>
<p> &nbsp; When speaking of late savageries on the plains the eyes of  "Little Phil" glittered wickedly. In one case, on Spillman's Creek, a band of Cheyennes had thrust a rusty sword into the body of a woman with child, piercing alike mother and offspring, and, giving it a fiendish twist, left the weapon in her body, the poor woman being found by our soldiers yet living.</p>

<p> &nbsp; "I believe it possible," said Sheridan, "at once and forever to stop these terrible crimes." As he spoke, however, we saw what he apparently did not, a long string of red tape, of which one end was pinned to his official coat-tail, while the other remained in the
hands of the Department at Washington. Soon after, as Sheridan pushed forward, the Washington end twitched vigorously. He managed, however, with his right arm, Custer, to deal a sledge-hammer blow, which broke to fragments the Cheyenne 
Blackkettle and his band. Whether or not that band had been guilty of the recent murders, the property of the slain was found in their possession, and the terrible 
punishment caused the residue of the tribe to sue for peace.  It was the first time for years that the war spirit had placed any horrors at their doors, and that one terrible lesson prepared the savage mind for the advent of peace commissioners.</p>

<br>
<hr width="55%">
<br>

<b>[From] Chapter XI.</b><br><br>
<p> &nbsp; Our ideas of the savage had been so thoroughly Cooperised during boyhood, that when our guide 
approached the Wolf, and, with a gesture to the south, invited him back to Hays, I was prepared to see the tall form straighten in the saddle, and pictured to my imagination some such specimen of untutored 
eloquence as this:</p>

<p> &nbsp; "Pale-face, the blood of the Cheyenne burns quick.  
He meets you trailing like a serpent across his 
warpath, seeking to steal treasures from the red man's land. He asks food, and you tell him to come into
your trap and get it.	Pale-faces, remove your hats; noble Cheyennes, remove their scalps!"</p>

<p> &nbsp; Nothing of this kind occurred, however.	Our guide informed us that the bold savage simply fastened one button of his tailless coat, grunted out "Ugh!" in a satisfied way, and motioned his band to follow.  This they did, and we were soon retracing our steps to Hays; by the guide's advice, making the savages keep a fair distance behind us.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br>
INDIANS AND BUFFALOES

<b>[From] Chapter XXIX.</b><br><br>

<p> &nbsp; Of one fact our journey thoroughly convinced us. Lo's forte has no connection with the fort of the pale-faces. An unguarded hunter, or a defenseless emigrant wagon, or unarmed railroad laborer, 
gratifies sufficiently his most warlike ambition. The savages of the plains, in their attacks upon the whites, have been like bees, stinging whenever 
opportunity offers, and immediately disappearing in space. Their excuses for the murders they commit have been as various as their moods.  At one time it is a broken treaty, at another the killing of their buffalo, and trespassing upon the hunting-grounds,
and again it is some other grievance. It may be some gratification for them to know that it is estimated that, until within the last three years, a white man's scalp atoned for each buffalo billed by his race.</p>

<p> &nbsp; In our various wars with the Indians, it is worthy of remark the bison have been like supply posts at convenient distances, to the hostile bands. Traveling without any supplies whatever, and therefore rapidly, a few moments suffice to kill a buffalo near the 
camping spot, and roast his flesh over the chips. The pony, meanwhile, makes a hearty meal on the grass. On the other hand, our troops, in pursuit of these bands, have had to encumber themselves with baggage 
wagons, or pack-mules, bearing food and forage.</p>
<br>

OUTLAWS

<b>[From] Chapter V.</b><br><br>

<p> &nbsp;  Among the persons present in the crowded office 
of the hotel, was a man from the southwestern part of the state 
who had lately been interested in a trial before the celebrated Judge 
Lynch.  Sachem interviewed him, and reports his statement of the 
occurrence in the log book, as follows:</p>

<table align="center" width=450 border=0 cellpadding=0>

 HEROES









<b>[From] Chapter X.</b><br><br>

<p> &nbsp; Monday was our day of final preparation, and we commenced it by making the acquaintance of those two celebrated characters, Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill, or, more correctly, William Hickock and William Cody. The former was acting as sheriff of the town, and the latter we engaged as our guide to the Saline.</p>

<p> &nbsp; Wild Bill made his <i>entree</i> into one court of the temple of fame some years since through Harper's Magazine. Since then his name has become a 
household word to residents along the Kansas frontier. We found him very quiet and gentlemanly, and not at all the reckless fellow we had supposed.  His form won our admiration--the shoulders of a Hercules with the waist of a girl. Much has been written
about Wild Bill that is pure fiction.  I do not 
believe, for example, that he could hit a nickel across the street with a pistol-ball, any more than an Indian could do so with an arrow. These feats belong to romance.  Bill is wonderfully handy with his pistols, however.  He then carried two of them, and while we were at Hays snuffed a man's life out with one;  but this was done in his capacity of oflîcer. Two rowdies devoted their energies to brewing a riot, and defied arrest until, at Bill's first shot, one fell dead, and the other threw up his arms in token of submission.  
During his life time Bill has probably killed his baker's dozen of men, but he has never, I believe, been known as the aggressor. To the people of Hays he was a valuable officer, making arrests when and where none other dare attempt it.  His power lies in the wonderful quickness with which he draws
a pistol and takes his aim.  These first shots, how ever, can not always last.  "They that take the sword shall perish with the sword;" and living as he does by the pistol, Bill will certainly die by it, unless he abandons the frontier. . . .</p>
<br>
<p> &nbsp; Buffalo Bill was to be our guide.  He informed us that Wild Bill was his cousin.  Cody is spare and wiry in figure, admirably versed in plain lore, and altogether the best guide I ever saw.  The 
mysterious plain is a book that he knows by heart.   He crossed it twice as teamster, while a mere boy, and has spent the greater part of his life on it since. He led us over its surface on starless nights, when the shadow of the blackness above hid our horses and the earth, and though many a time with no trail to follow and on the very mid-ocean of the expanse, he never made a failure.  Buffalo Bill has since figured in one of Buntline's Indian romances. We award 
him the credit of being a good scout and most excellent 
guide; but the fact that he can slaughter buffalo is by no 
means remarkable, since the American bison is dangerous 
game only to amateurs.</p>

<br>
<hr width="55%">
<br>

<p> &nbsp; It was extremely fortunate for us that we had secured Cody as guide. The whole western country bordering on the plains, as we afterward learned, from sorry experience, is infested with numberless charlatans, blazing with all sorts of hunting and fighting titles, and ready at the rustle of greenbacks to act as guides through a land they know nothing about.	These reprobates delight in telling thrilling tales of their escapes from Indians, and are 
constantly chilling the blood of their shivering party by pointing out spots where imaginary murders took place. Without compasses they would be as 
hopelessly lost as needleless mariners.	I have my doubts
if one-third of these terribly named bullies could tell, on a pinch, where the north star is. Unless they chanced to strike one of the Pacific lines which stretch across the plains, a party, under their guidance, 
wishing to go west would be equally liable to get among the Northern Siouxs or the Ku-Klux of Arkansas.</p>

<p> &nbsp; A thousand miles east Young America's cherished ideal of the frontier scout and guide is an eagle-eyed giant, with a horse which obeys his whistle, and breaks the neck of any Indian trying to steal him. In addition to its wonderful master, the back of this 
model steed is usually occupied by a rescued maiden.	At risk of infringing on the copyrights of thirty-six 
thousand of the latest Indian stories, we have obtained from an artist on the spot an illustration of the last heroine brought in and her rescuer, the rare old plainsman.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

WOMEN


<b>[From] Chapter XX.</b><br><br>

<p> &nbsp; The second day after leaving Silver Creek, we suddenly encountered another specialty of the plains, the "Wild Huntress." So often has this personage and her male counterpart danced, with big letters and a bowie-knife, across yellow covers, that we met the "original Jacobs " of the tribe gleefully. She came to us in a cloud of buffalo, with black eyes glittering like a snake's, and coarse and uncombed hair that tangled itself in the wind, and streamed and twisted behind her like writhing vipers. A black riding habit flowed out in the strong breeze, its train snapping like a loose sail, and a black mustang fled from her Indian lash--the dark wild horse, a fit carrier for such somber outfit.</p>

<p> &nbsp; She was introduced to us by the bison herd, which came thundering across our front, with this strange figure pressing its flank and darting hither and thither from one outskirt of the flying multitude to the other. The reins lay loose on the neck of her mustang, which entered into the fierce chase like a bloodhound, doubling and twisting on its course with an agility that was wonderful.</p>

<p> &nbsp; One hand of the huntress held out a holster revolver, 
which she fired occasionally, but with 
uncertain aim, one of the bullets indeed whistling our way. The chase constituted the excitement that she sought, and the pistol was little more than a spur to urge it on.</p>

<p> &nbsp; "That's Ann, poor P----'s wife," said our guide.
"Crazy since the Indians killed her husband.  He was a contractor on the railroad; his camp used to be just above Hays.	She lives in the old  "dug-out" on the line yet, and spends half her time chasing buffalo.  She never kills none, but that isn't what
she is after.  She wants to be moving, and just as wild as she can; it sort o' relieves her mind."</p>

<p> &nbsp; The huntress had seen our outfit, and rode toward us. The face was a very plain one, with a vacant yet anxious expression, and the tightly-drawn skin seeming scarcely to cover the jaw-bones.  She halted before us, and commenced conversation at once.</p>
<p> &nbsp; "Good day, gentlemen." <p> &nbsp; "Good day, madam."
<p> &nbsp; "She always tells her story to every body,"  
muttered the guide in a low voice.
<p> &nbsp; "Have you seen any Cheyennes hereabouts, 
gentlemen?  I sighted a party this morning, and you ought to have seen them run. Raven Dick, here, put his best foot foremost, but they shook him out of sight in a ravine.  Haven't any thing better to do, friends, and so I 'm riding down some buffalo."</p>
<p> &nbsp; We could easily understand why superstitious savages should run when a maniac female of such dismal aspect flitted along their trail.</p>
<p> &nbsp; "Out from Hays, sirs?" she continued, after a
pause.	  "I left there yesterday.  Dick and I camped
last night.  We must be home when the men come
in from work this eve.  Up, Rave!" and she struck the mustang a cruel blow, from which he jumped with quivering muscles, only  to be violently curbed. For the first time she had just noticed our guide, and sat for an instant with her wild eyes eating a way to his heart.  Then she turned again to us.</p>

<p> &nbsp; "Sirs, you must aid me.  Some say the Cheyennes killed my husband, and others there be who think Abe there did it. More shame to me who has to tell it, but the two had a fight about a woman, some months gone.	It was just after pay-day, and husband was drunk; otherwise he'd never have bothered his head about any girl but the one he married.</p>
<p> &nbsp; "There were blows and black eyes, and being a rough man's quarrel, it ended with hand-shaking. My man came home, and we sat by the fire that night, and I took no notice that he'd been wrong, but spoke of our old home in Ohio, and asked him wouldn't he go back there when the contract was finished.  And he put his hand on mine, and says 'Sis, if the cuts and fills on the next mile work to profit, we 'll go home.'  Just then there came a hiss from the door at our backs, and husband turned sharp and quick.  There was a knot-hole in the planks, and its round black mouth, gaping from out in the night at us, had spit the pound into our ears.  Husband he rose and went to the door, and fell back dying, with an arrow in his breast.  Some said it was a Cheyenne, and others said Abe did it.  There were lots of Indian bows in camp, and Cheyennes don't 
kill for the love of it, but only to steal.  I'm going to ask them, if I can catch them, did they do it, and if not, I know who did.  I've a bow, Abe, and an arrow too, and I hope his blood isn't on your hands."</p>
<p> &nbsp; "I did n't do it, Ann.  I don't shoot no man in the dark," replied our hostler guide, with a sullen 
defiance, which among that class stands equally well for innocence or guilt. We looked at the two, as they sat for an instant facing each other.	The 
picture was a weird one--a wildcat, fronting the 
object of its chase, but undecided whether to spring or not. We felt that the dark maniac had been hovering around us, and that this meeting was not altogether accidental.  Her disordered brain was yet undecided in which direction vengeance lay, and, like a tigress, she was watching and waiting.</p>
<p> &nbsp; Our policy developed, on the instant, into a 
noncommittal and a safe one. As she wheeled her horse, and left us without a word, we remarked to our guide that crazy folks were often suspicious of their best friends.</p>
<p> &nbsp;  "That's so," he replied, and rode off to urge on the wagons. We shrank from the idea of living with a murderer, and acquitted him of the crime on the spot.</p>
