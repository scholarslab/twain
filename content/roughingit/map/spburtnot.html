  <blockquote>
    <font size="+1"><b>*</b></font>   As early as A.D. 1772
    (Description of the Province of Carolana,etc., etc., by Daniel
    Cox) it was suggested that there was a line of water
    communication by means of the "northern branch of the Great
    Yellow River, by the natives called the River of the
    Massorites" (Missouri River), and a branch of the Columbia
    River, which, however, was erroneously supposed to disembogue
    through the Great Salt Lake into the Pacific. The idea has been
    revived in the present day. Some assert that the upper waters
    of the Yellow Stone, which approach within three hundred miles
    of the Great Salt Lake City, are three feet deep, and therefore
    navigable for flatbottomed boats during the annual inundation.
    Other believe that, as in the case of the Platte, shallowness
    would be an insuperable obstacle, except for one or two months.
    This point will doubtless be settled by Captain W. F. Raynolds,
    of the United States Topographical Engineers, who, accompanied
    by Colonel J. Bridger, was, at the time of my visit to Great
    Salt Lake City, exploring the Valley of the Yellow Stone.
