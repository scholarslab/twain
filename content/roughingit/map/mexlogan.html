      Ferguson now takes the place of the stage-driver and becomes
      the Avenger. The reader will scarcely ask me who Ferguson the
      Avenger is. He is the guide. All guides are Fergusons since
      the Innocents went Abroad, and The Only Twain returned to
      chronicle their Pilgrimage. Boniface is a landlord, Jehu is a
      hack-driver, Ferguson is a guide. So be it.<br />
      <br />
      Ferguson is a Mexican born in California, and as graceful and
      as handsome as a picture. No mistake about this. He'd be a
      fortune for a painter, with his tawny, smooth skin tingling
      with red on the cheeks, his scarlet lips, his white teeth,
      his profusion of blackest hair. His other name is Manuel, and
      he has never been away from these mountains. He has never
      seen a steamboat, nor a railroad, nor a city. He wants to do
      so very much. So do we all just at that minute.<br />
