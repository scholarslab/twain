      <td><i>The most famous Indian response to the behavior of
      white Americans in the West was, and probably still is, the
      Nez Perc&eacute; Chief Joseph's "Indian's Views of Indian
      Affairs," originally published in the</i> North American
      Review <i>128 (April 1879). The Indian from Montana's
      Flathead tribe speaking below may have been Charlot. The
      immediate actions he is protesting were the attempts to tax
      the tribe and at the same time remove them from their
      ancestral land in the Bitter Root Valley.</i></td>

        <p>Yes, my people, the white man wants us to pay him. He
        comes in his intent, and says we must pay him--pay him for
        our own--for the things we have from our God and our
        forefathers; for the things he never owned and never gave
        us. What law or right is that? What shame or what charity?
        The Indian says that a woman is more shameless than a man:
        but the white man has less shame than our women. Since our
        forefathers first beheld him more than seven times ten
        winters have snowed and melted. Most of them, like those
        snows, have dissolved away. Their spirits went whither they
        came; his, they say, go there too. Do they meet and see us
        here? Can he blush before his Maker, or is he forever dead.
        Is his prayer like his promise--a trust of the wind? Is it
        a sound without sense? Is it a thing whose life is a foul
        thing? And is he not foul? He has filled graves with our
        bones. His horses, his cattle, his sheep, his men, his
        women have a rot. Does not his breath, his gums stink? His
        jaws lose their teeth and he stamps them with false ones;
        yet he is not ashamed. No, no; his course is destruction;
        he spoils what the spirit who gave us this country made
        beautiful and clean. But that is not enough; he wants us to
        pay him besides his enslaving our country. Yes, and our
        people, besides, that degradation of a tribe who never were
        his enemies. What is he? Who sent him here? We were happy
        when he first came. We first thought he came from the
        light: but he comes like the dusk of the evening now; not
        like the dawn of the morning. He comes like a day that has
        passed, and night enters our future with him.</p>

        <p>To take and to lie should be burned on his forehead, as
        he burns the sides of my stolen horses with his own name.
        Had Heaven's Chief burnt him with some mark to refuse him,
        we might have refused him. No; we did not refuse him in his
        weakness. In his poverty we fed, we cherished him--yes,
        befriended him, and showed him the fords and defiles of our
        lands. Yet we did not think his face was concealed with
        hair, and that he often smiled like a rabbit in his own
        beard. A long-tailed, skulking thing, fond of flat lands,
        and soft grass and woods.</p>

        <p>Did he not feast us with our own cattle, on our own
        land, yes, on our own plain by the cold spring; did he not
        invite our hands to his papers; did he not promise before
        the sun and before the eye that put fire in it, and in the
        name of both, and in the name of his own Chief, promise us
        what he promised--to give us what he has not given; to do
        what he knew he would never do? Now, because he lied, and
        because he yet lies, without friendship, manhood, justice,
        or charity, he wants us to give him money--pay him more.
        When shall he be satisfied? A roving skulk, first; a
        natural liar, next; and withal a murderer, a tyrant.</p>

        <p>To confirm his purpose; to make the trees and stones and
        his own people hear him, he whispers soldiers, lockhouses
        and iron chains. My people, we are poor; we are fatherless.
        The white man fathers this doom--yes, this curse on us and
        on the few that may see a few days more. He, the cause of
        our ruin, is his own snake which he says stole on his
        mother in her own country to lie to her. He says his story
        is that man was rejected and cast off. Why did we not
        reject him forever? He says one of his virgins had a son
        nailed to death on two cross sticks to save him. Were all
        of them dead when that young man died, we would all be safe
        now, and our country our own.</p>

        <p>But he lives to persist; yes, the rascal is also an
        unsatisfied beggar, and his hangman and swine follow his
        walk. Pay him money? Did he inquire, how? No, no, his
        meanness ropes his charity, his avarice wives his envy, his
        race breeds to extort. Did he speak at all like a friend?
        He saw a few horses and some cows, and so many tens of
        rails with the few of us that own them. His envy thereon
        baited to the quick. Why thus; because he himself says he
        is in a big debt, and wants us to help pay it. His avarice
        put him in debt, and he wants us to pay him for it and be
        his fools. Did he ask how many a helpless widow, how many a
        fatherless child, how many a blind and naked thing fare a
        little of that little we have? Did he--in a destroying
        night when the mountains and the firmaments put their faces
        together to freeze us--did he inquire if we had a spare rag
        of a blanket to save his lost and perishing steps to our
        fires? No, no; cold he is, and merciless. Four times in one
        shivering night I last winter knew the old one-eyed Indian,
        Kenneth, the gray man of full seven tens of winters, was
        refused shelter in four of the white man's houses on his
        way that bad night; yet the aged, blinded man was turned
        out to his fate. No, no; he is cold and merciless, haughty
        and overbearing. Look at him, and he looks at you--how? His
        fishy eyes scan you as the why-oops do the shelled blue
        cock. He is cold, and stealth and envy are with him, and
        fit him as do his hands and feet. We owe him nothing. He
        owes us more than he will pay us, and yet he says there is
        a God.</p>

        <p>I know another aged Indian, with his only daughter and
        wife alone in their lodge. He had a few beaver skins and
        four or five poor horses--all he had. The night was bad and
        held every stream in thick ice; the earth was white; the
        stars burned nearer us as if to pity us, but the more they
        burned the more stood the hair of the deer on end with
        cold, nor heeded they the frost bursting bark of the
        willows. Two of the white man's people came to the lodge,
        lost and freezing pitifully. They fared well inside that
        lodge. The old wife and only daughter unbound and cut off
        their frozen shoes; gave them new ones and crushed
        sage-bark rind to keep their feet warm and smooth. She gave
        them warm soup; boiled deer meat and boiled beaver. They
        were saved; their safety returned to make them live. After
        awhile they would not stop; they would go. They went away.
        Mind you; remember well; at midnight they returned,
        murdered the old father and his daughter and her mother
        asleep, took the beaver skins and horses and left. Next
        day, the first and only Indian they met, a fine young man,
        they killed, put his body under the ice and rode away on
        his horse.</p>

        <p>Yet they say we are not good. Will he tell his own
        crimes? No, no; his crimes to us are left untold. But the
        Desolater bawls and cries the clangers of the country from
        us, the few left of us. Other tribes kill and ravish his
        women and stake his children, and eat his steers, and he
        gives them blankets and sugar for it. We the poor Flatheads
        who never troubled him, he wants now to distress and make
        poorer.</p>

        <p>I have no more to say, my people; but this much I have
        said and close to hear your minds about this payment. We
        never begot laws or rights to ask it. His laws never gave
        us a blade, nor a tree, nor a duck, nor a grouse, nor a
        trout. No; like the wolverine that steals your cache, how
        often does he come? You know he comes as long as he lives,
        and takes more and more, and dirties what he leaves.</p>
