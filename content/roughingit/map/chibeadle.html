        one point I found the railroad running on trestle-work for
        a mile, over a marsh filled with water four months ago, but
        not dry as the hots rays of a California sun, from six
        months of cloudless sky, could make it. . . . After a
        year's experience it has been found necessary to raise the
        whole road-bed four feet. In this work I encountered many
        gangs of Chinese, in their wicker-work basket-shaped hats,
        stolid, impassive air, and universal <i>no sahvey</i>
        ("don't understand") to every question. To me they all
        looked alike, the same size, and seemed to have been cast
        in the same mould. It hardly seemed possible that I could
        get well-acquainted with one individual. But their Yankee
        overseer tells me this is "all a notion at first sight";
        that they see as much difference as among whites, and when
        called to identify one under oath, which is often the case,
        do so without difficulty. To me they appear to work very
        slowly, feebly even; but the overseers credit them with
        great steadiness, and aver that one does as much in a day
        as an average Irishman. They use no coffee and very little
        water, making tea their regular beverage, both at meals and
        work.</p>

        <p>Those employed on this road receive twenty-eight dollars
        a month, boarding themselves and resting Sundays. It costs
        them a dollar and a half each per week to live. They have
        but two holidays, which they observe with great festivity:
        the Chinese New Year's, occurring either in January or
        February, as their year contains thirteen lunar months; and
        the "Devil-drive," which takes place in October. Chinese
        labor is only relatively cheap: in California it costs but
        half that of white laborers, or even less; but in the
        Eastern States the difference is too little to furnish just
        grounds to that class who manifest so much horror about "an
        invasion of barbarous Mongolians."</p><br />
