        The <i>fall</i> of the Yosemite, so called, is a humbug. It
        is not the Merced River that makes this fall, but a mere
        tributary trout brook, which pitches in from the north by a
        barely once-broken descent of two thousand six hundred
        feet, while the Merced enters the valley at its eastern
        extremity, over falls of six hundred and two hundred and
        fifty feet. But a river thrice as large as the Merced, at
        this season, would be utterly dwarfed by all the other
        accessories of this prodigious chasm. Only a Mississippi or
        a Niagara could be adequate to their exactions. I readily
        concede that a hundred times the present amount of water
        may roll down the Yosemite Fall in the months of May and
        June, when the snows are melting from the central ranges of
        the Sierra Nevada, which bound this abyss on the east; but
        this would not add a fraction to the wonder of this vivid
        exemplification of the divine power and majesty. At
        present, the little stream that leaps down the Yosemite,
        and is all but shattered to mist by the amazing descent,
        looks like a tapeline let down from the cloud-capped height
        to measure the depth of the abyss. The Yosemite Valley (or
        Gorge) is the most unique and majestic of nature's marvels,
        but the Yosemite Fall is of little account. Were it absent,
        the valley would not be perceptibly less worthy of a
        fatiguing visit.<br />
        <br />
        We traversed the valley from end to end the next day, but
        an accumulation of details on such a subject only serve to
        confuse and blunt the observer's powers of perception and
        appreciation. Perhaps the visiter who should be content
        with a long look into the abyss from the most convenient
        height, without braving the toil of a descent, would be
        wiser than all of us; and yet that first glance upward from
        the foot will long haunt me as more impressive than any
        look downward from the summit could be.<br />
        <br />
        I shall not multiply details, nor waste paper in noting all
        the foolish names which foolish people have given to
        different peaks or turrets. Just think of two giant stone
        towers, or pillars, which rise a thousand feet above the
        towering cliff which form their base, being styled the Two
        Sisters! Could anything be more maladroit and
        lackadaisical? The Dome is a high, round, naked peak, which
        rises between the Merced and its little tributary from the
        inmost recesses of the Sierra Nevada already instanced, and
        which towers to an altitude of over five thousand feet
        above the waters at its base. Picture to yourself a
        perpendicular wall of bare granite nearly or quite one mile
        high! Yet there are some dozen or score of peaks in all,
        ranging from three thousand to five thousand feet above the
        valley, and a biscuit tossed from any of them would strike
        very near its base, and its fragments go bounding and
        falling still further. I certainly miss here the glaciers
        of Chamonix, but I know no single wonder of nature on earth
        which can claim superiority over the Yosemite. Just dream
        yourself for one hour in a chasm nearly ten miles long,
        with egress, save for birds and water, but at three points,
        up the face of precipices from three thousand to four
        thousand feet high, the chasm scarcely more than a mile
        wide at any point, and tapering to a mere gorge, or canyon,
        at either end, with walls of mainly naked and perpendicular
        white granite, from three thousand to five thousand feet
        high, so that looking up to the sky from it is like looking
        out of an unfathomable profound--and you will have some
        conception of the Yosemite.<br />
