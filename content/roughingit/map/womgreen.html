      <td>The women of Greeley seem to me to have great spirit and
      cheerfulness. Yet I felt that with their new, strange, wild
      surroundings, -- the illimitable vastness of earth and sky,
      -- with new labors and hardships and deprivations and
      discomforts, -- with the care of all the ditchers than cometh
      upon them daily, -- they must be discontented, unhappy,
      rebellious; and I tried to win from them the sorrowful
      secret. I gave them to understand that I was a friend to the
      sex, ready at any time, on the shortest notice, to lift my
      voice against the wrongs and disabilities of women; that I
      deeply felt for wives and daughters whom tyrant man and
      dragged away from comfortable Eastern homes, neighborly
      cronies, and choice Gospel and shopping privileges. But the
      perverse creatures actually declared that they were never so
      happy and so healthy as they are here, right on the edge of
      the great American Desert; that they life in the sure hope of
      soon having more than the old comforts and luxuries around
      them; that, in short, the smell of the "flesh-pots of Egypt"
      has gone clean out of their nostrils.<br />
      <br />
      In fact, I find Colorado women everywhere, on mountain or
      plain, in town or ranch, singularly courageous and cheery,
      and I think that the cause in great part lies in their
      excellent health. The pioneer women of Michigan, Indiana, and
      Illinois had in their time to endure similar hardships and
      privations, with ague and fevers thrown in. The spirit shook
      with the body; when the liver gave out, the heart soon
      failed.<br />
