  The Uncivilized Races of Men in All Countries of the World<br />
  By Rev. J. G. Wood<br />
  In Two Volumes, Vol. II<br />
  Hartford: J. B. Burr and Hyde, Publishers, 1872<br />
  <br />
  From Chapter 139, The North American Indians (continued)<br />
  <br />
  As the object of this work is to present the manners and customs
  of tribes and races in their primitive state, and not those
  semi-civilized, it will be enough to merely introduce the names
  of the Cherokees, Choctaws, Creeks, Chickasaws, Senecas,
  Delawares, etc. Nor is it necessary to consider those, now
  extinct, that occupied the country when first settled by white
  men. For the same general characteristics, now presented, pertain
  to all the North American races. The Indian tribes are rapidly
  retreating or vanishing before the steady, irresistible march of
  civilization, and the growing grandeur of the great Republic in
  North America. The line, where the echoes of the Indian's yell
  blends with the shout of the advancing pioneers and the sound of
  the wood-chopper's axe, is continually moving westward. In a few
  years we have seen it pass from the Mississippi River, to the
  base of the Rocky Mountains. The settler's cabin is unceasingly
  encroaching upon the wigwams of the Red Men. With sadness, having
  smoothed the graves of their fathers, and taken a last look of
  their hunting grounds, they retreat before a power which they
  vainly strive to resist. Pressed backward in two centuries and a
  half, across three-quarters of the continent, from Massachusetts
  Bay almost to the Pacific, except a few decaying remnants of
  tribes, their history and doom cannot but awaken sympathy for an
  unfortunate and overpowered race.<br />
  <br />
  Even though we do not form our estimate of the Indian from the
  romantic creations of Cooper, every right-thinking person will
  accord them the tribute of many qualities that constitute a real
  grandeur of character. Their marvellous bravery, their ardent
  rage, their steadfast, fiery enthusiasm in the fight or in the
  chase, their manly sports, their grave, philosophic demeanor in
  the council, their stern, stoical endurance in misfortune, their
  disdain of death, are traits that have given to the Indian a
  character unique and noble, a character and history that the
  annalist, poet, and novelist have transferred to their immortal
  pages, and over which multitudes of old and young alike have bent
  with eager, breathless interest. As Mr. Mangin in his "Desert
  World" says: --"There was poetry in their faith, in their
  customs, in their language, at once laconic and picturesque--and
  even in the names they bestowed on each tribe, each chief and
  warrior, on mountain and river. One can hardly suppress a feeling
  of regret that so much of wild romance and valor should have been
  swept from the face of the earth, unless we call to mind the
  shadow of the picture--the Indian's cruelty, perfidiousness and
  savage lust. Even then, our humanity revolts from the treatment
  to which he has been subjected by the white man." Tracked and
  hunted like wild beasts, driven from their hunting grounds and
  the territory of their ancestors, imbruted by drink, decimated
  and dying by epidemics and vices contracted from white men, the
  poor Indians vainly struggling to avert their doom of
  extermination have elicited the sympathy and commiseration of the
  civilized world. The theory advocated in the preceding part of
  this work . . . in regard to the decay and extinction of savage
  races, does not forbid regrets that such a people should have
  suffered so greviously at the hands of the United States
  Government, by the greed of its agents, the frauds of traders,
  and the fatal contagion of the vices of a civilized people. What
  with American rifles and American whiskey, their extinction has
  been rapid, and their doom certain.<br />
  <br />
  . . . Here we have the secret of many of the barbarities of the
  Indian tribes. Inflamed and imbruted by the whiskey sold them,
  their ignorance imposed upon by the greed of traders and even
  government agents, having little or no chance for securing
  justice in their real or imagined injuries, there is certainly
  some extenuation if this wild son of the forest go forth with
  tomahawk and scalping knife, as the self-appointed avenger of his
  own and his people's wrongs. This is not the place, if there were
  room, for a thorough discussion of the wrongs of the Red Men, but
  I cannot forgo the duty, in treating of the manners, customs and
  character of tribes so interesting, so noble and superior, by
  many traits, to most savage races, of recording at the same time,
  this tribute and testimony. It will unquestionably be the verdict
  of the future, as coming generations shall study the memorials
  and character of the North American Indians.<font size=
