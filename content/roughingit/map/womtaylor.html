      In the outskirts of the village were encamped companies of
      newly-arrived emigrants, among their shattered wagons and
      their weary cattle, and we met numbers of others on the way.
      From Luther's Pass at the head of the Carson Valley, a trail
      turns southward, crosses the Sierra, and passing down the
      ridge above Silver Valley to the Big Trees, forms the most
      direct road from Carson River to the Southern mines. These
      emigrants were now at the end of their toil and sufferings;
      but, instead of appearing rejoiced at the deliverance, their
      faces wore a hard and stern expression, with something of
      Indian shyness. The women, as if conscious that their
      sun-browned faces and their uncombed hair were not
      particularly beautiful, generally turned their heads away as
      we passed. Dirty, dilapidated, and frowsy as many of them
      were, they all wore hoops! Yes, even seated in the wagons, on
      the way, their dusty calicoes were projected out over the
      whiffle-trees by the battered and angular rims of what had
      once been circles! It was an exhibition of sacrifice to
      fashion, too melancholy for laughter.<br />
