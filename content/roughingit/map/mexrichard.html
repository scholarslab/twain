      <td>Our conductor [was] a Virginian who had lived for
      thirteen years in this region . . . Mexican women he thought
      the kindest in the world. Many an American owed his life to
      them. They were fond of white men, which made the Greasers
      jealous and dangerous.<br />
      <br />
      "Are the men treacherous?"<br />
      <br />
      "<i>I</i> never had any trouble with them; but stranger, I
      always watch a Greaser, and at night I never let one travel
      behind me. It's the safe way, if you don't want to get shot
      or stabbed in the back." . . .<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Dancing, a passion with the ancient Aztecs and mingling in
      all their religious exercises, continues the staple amusement
      of their mixed descendants. There were three or four
      fandangoes in Santa Fe every night, the Mexicans always
      participating with wonderful zest.<br />
      <br />
      There were only one or two American ladies in the Territory;
      though the number has since increased. Many native women were
      mistresses of the white residents by the consent, even the
      desire, of their degraded husbands. Chastity is practically
      unknown among them, but they possess all the other
      distinctive virtues of their sex. These poor creatures,
      utterly devoid of personal purity, willing to give or suffer
      any thing to obtain jewelry or silks, are uniformly tender
      and self sacrificing, ready to divide their last crust with
      the hungry, and deny themselves every comfort to nurse the
      sick and minister to the wretched. . . .<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Degenerate descendants of that strange race, whose "gorgeous
      semi-civilization" was once the world's wonder, modern
      Mexicans are treacherous, effeminate, cowardly and
      superstitious, almost meriting John Randolph's bitter
      invective: "a blanketed nation of thieves and
      harlots."<br /></td>
