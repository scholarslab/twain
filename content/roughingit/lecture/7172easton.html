<p>T<font size="-1">O-MORROW</font> evening the people of Easton will have the pleasure of hearing the great American humorist, "Mark Twain," who will lecture at the Court House.  Judging from the number of tickets already sold, there will be but few seats undisposed of after to-day.  The price of tickets for seats in the main floor is $1.  For seats in the gallery and bar, 75 cents.

<p>"M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN</font>" has been compelled to disappoint the good people of this town.  Two telegrams have been received from him during the last twenty-four hours, in both of which he begs to be excused from fulfilling his contract here this evening.  Sudden illness in his family summons him home immediately.  He greatly regrets his inability to appear according to engagement.  He has promised us another evening shortly, however, on which occasion the tickets already issued will be as good as ever.  Any who do not care to hold their tickets until his next appearance here on application at the place of purchase will have their money refunded them on return of their tickets.</p>
<p>We are very sorry that this has happened, but it is, evidently, nobody's <i>fault</i>. However, he only fails us for the <i>present</i>.  We shall look to hear next week, when he may be again expected.</p>

<p>I<font size="-1">T</font> should not be forgotten that Mark Twain, the distinguished humorist, will deliver one of his entertaining lectures at the Court House on Thursday evening of this week.

<p>W<font size="-1">IT AND</font> <font size="-1">HUMOR</font>. -- To-morrow evening we expect to see the Court House filled, on the occasion of Mark Twain's lecture.  Mr. Twain, by his writings for the press and otherwise, enjoyed celebrity long anterior to his entrance upon the lecture field.  In his writings, Mr. Twain entirely eschews the "Doesticks" and "Billings" style of gross wit (which consists of bad spelling), and appeals to the more refined and educated feelings of his readers.  Such is his work the "Innocents Abroad," which is a humorous narrative of the voyage of the steamship "Quaker City" to Europe and the Holy Land.  It so firmly established the reputation of Mr. Twain, as one of the foremost comic writers of America, that his services have since been in great demand for the lecture-room, where, if we may believe the accounts we read, he successfully sustained the reputation acquired by his writings.  The object of the lecture being a charitable one, viz.: the benefit of Trinity Episcopal Church, it should be liberally patronized by our generous-hearted community.  Tickets to be had at the book stores, and at the door of hall.

<p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN</font> T<font size="-1">O-NIGHT</font>.--Of Mark Twain, who lectures in the Court House this evening, the Philadelphia Press of yesterday says: "Artemus Ward was the title of the lecture delivered last evening at the Academy of Music, by Mark Twain.  Despite the inclemency of the weather the house was densely crammed; in fact, it contained the largest audience ever assembled within its walls to listen to a lecture.</p>
<p>Those present had evidently come to hear something good and quaint.  In this they were not disappointed.  The lecturer came forward and said:--</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen:--I ask leave to introduce to you the lecturer of the evening, Mr. Clemens, otherwise "Mark Twain," a gentleman whose great learning, whose accuracy of language, whose devotion to science, whose veneration for the truth and infelicitious harmonies are equal to his high moral character and the majesty of his benign presence.  I refer in these vague general terms to myself.  It is not the custom here, I believe, for lecturers to introduce themselves to the audience.  I thought, perhaps, that it would be better for me to do this myself and then I could get in all the facts.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire lecture the audience was kept in a continuous roar of laughter; and, if Artemus Ward could create fun for the million, as stated by the lecturer, the latter certainly demonstrated his ability to do the same."</p>
<p>If Clemens could fill the Philadelphia Academy of Music with a delighted audience, we can see no reason why he should not attract a sufficient number of people this evening to crowd the Court House to suffocation.  He believe he will.</p>
