We hardly think the Prince of [...]d lecturers, Wendell Phillips, could [...]arge an audience.  However this [...] was certain that Mark Twain cannot [...] expectations and satisfy them as [...] Agitator can.  His introduction of [himself w]as very good, and put his audience [...] [h]umor, but the length of his pauses [...] [nar]rating any incident, or when await[ing the] applause or laughter of his hearers [...] a sense of weariness on many even [...] ready to appreciate anything and [everythin]g which came from the author of ["The Inno]cents Abroad."
