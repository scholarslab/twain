<table align="center" width="85%" border=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td>Available here is a sampling of the newspaper advertisements for MT's 1871-1872 lectures.  The list <i>at left</i> is arranged chronologically.  Clicking on a link will bring up the ad in this frame.  In most cases you'll also one or more adjacent ads from the original newspaper; they're included to provide an idea of the performative environment in which "Mark Twain Live" was born and was now (despite the frustrations and false starts of this third American tour) being raised to national stardom.
