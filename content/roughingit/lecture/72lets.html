Livy, old sweetheart,...<br /><br />
Have accepted Warner's friend's invitation -- though I <i>always</i> decline private houses.<br /><br />
No, on second thoughts I don't <i>dare</i> to do it.  A lecturer <i>dreads</i> a private house -- Oh, more than he dreads 200 miles of railway travel.  I must tear up my letter of acceptance.  In <i>spite</i> of yourself you respect their unholy breakfast hours -- you can't <i>help</i> it -- &amp; then you feel drowsy &amp; miserable for two days &amp; you give two audiences a very poor lecture.  No, I don't dare go there.  I like to be perfectly free -- more than that: perfectly <i>lawless</i>....Hotels are the only proper places for lecturers.  When I am ill natured I so enjoy the freedom of a hotel -- where I can ring up a domestic &amp; give him a quarter &amp; then break furniture over him -- then I go to bed calmed &amp; soothed, &amp; sleep as peacefully as a child....<br /><br />

Livy darling,...
I have been figuring.  My lecture business, up to the end of January, yields about $10,000 -- &amp; yet, when I preach Jan. 30 it is well I am so close to Hartford, for I would not have money enough to get home on.  It has all gone &amp; is going, for those necessaries of life -- debts.  Every night the question is, Well, who does <i>this</i> day's earnings belong to? -- &amp; always it goes.  I <i>do</i> hate lecturing, &amp; shall try hard to have as little as possible of it to do hereafter....<br /><br />
Lecturing is hateful, but it <i>must</i> come to an end yet, &amp; <i>then</i> I'll see my darling, whom I love, love, <i>love</i>.<br /><br />

Livy darling,...<br /><br />
Well, slowly this lecturing penance drags toward the end. Heaven knows I shall be glad when I get far away from these country communities of wooden-heads.  Whenever I want to go away from New England again, lecturing, please show these letters to me &amp; bring me to my senses.  How I do chafe &amp; sweat when I count up the Dutch audiences I have yet to play the fool before.<br /><br />

Livy darling, it was perfectly splendid -- no question about it -- the livest, quickest audience I almost ever saw in my life.<br /><br />

This was the largest audience ever assembled in Pittsburgh to hear a lecture, some say.  Great numbers were turned away -- couldn't get in; stage was jam-full; all the private boxes full -- Seems to me there were three tiers of them.<br /><br />

Livy darling, this is a filthy, stupid, hateful Dutch village, like <i>all</i> Pennsylvania -- &amp; I have got to lecture to these leatherheads tonight -- but I shall leave for Pittsburgh at 3 in the morning, &amp; spend Sunday in that black but delightful town.<br /><br />

Livy darling,...<br /><br />
Had a magnificent time at Lancaster last night.  Stormy night, but brilliant, crowded audience.  I wrote a new, long clause jammed it into the lecture &amp; talked it off from memory without missing a word -- a mistake would have been ghastly.  All these late places insist on my coming back.<br /><br />
