        But they were rough in those times! They fairly reveled in
        gold, whisky, fights and fandangoes, and were unspeakably
        happy. The honest miner raked a hundred to a thousand
        dollars out of his claim a day, and what with the gambling
        dues and the other entertainments, he hadn't a cent the
        next morning, if he had any sort of luck. They cooked their
        own bacon and beans, sewed on their own buttons, washed
        their own shirts -- blue woolen ones -- and if a man wanted
        a fight on his hands without any annoying delay, all he had
        to do was to appear in public in a white shirt or a
        stove-pipe hat, and he would be accommodated. For those
        people hated aristocrats. They had a particular and
        malignant animosity toward what they called a "biled
        shirt."<br />
        <br />
        In his sketch entitled "The Luck of Roaring Camp," Mr. Bret
        Harte has deftly pictured the roughness and lawlessness of
        a California mining camp of the early days, and also its
        large-hearted charity and compassion -- for these traits
        are found in all true pioneers. Roaring Camp becomes
        blessed by the presence of a wandering, sickly woman and
        her little child -- rare and coveted treasures among rude
        men who still yearned in secret for the mothers and sisters
        and children they loved and cherished in other days. This
        wanderer -- the only woman in Roaring Camp -- died, and the
        honest miners took charge of the orphan little one in a
        body. They washed it and dressed it and fed it -- getting
        its garments on wrong end first as often as any other way,
        and pinning the garments to the child occasionally and
        wondering why the baby wasn't comfortable -- and the food
        these inexperienced nurses lovingly concocted for it was
        often rather beyond its capabilities, since it was neither
        an alligator nor an ostrich.<br />
        <br />
        But they meant well, and the baby thrived in spite of the
        perilous kindnesses of the miners. But it was manifest that
        all could not nurse the baby at once, and so they passed a
        law that the best behaved man should have it for one day,
        and the man with the cleanest shirt the next day, and the
        man whose cabin was in the neatest order the next, and so
        on. And the result was, that a handsome cradle was bought,
        and carted from cabin to cabin, according to who won the
        privilege of nursing that day -- and the handsome cradle
        made such a contrast to the unhandsome furniture, that
        gradually the unhandsome furniture disappeared and gave way
        for a neater sort -- and then ambitious male nurses got to
        washing up and putting on clean garments every day, and
        some of them twice a day -- and rough, boisterous
        characters became gentle and soft-spoken, since only the
        well-behaved could nurse the baby. And, in fine, the
        lawless Roaring Camp became insensibly transformed into a
        neat well-dressed, orderly and law-abiding community, the
        wonder and admiration of all the mining world. All this,
        through the dumb teaching, the humanizing influence, the
        uninspired ministering of a little child.<br />

          <font size="-1"><b>THE SEX ON EXHIBITION</b></font>
        </center><br />
        In those days men would flock in crowds to catch a glimpse
        of that rare and blessed spectacle, a woman! Old
        inhabitants tell how, in a certain camp, the news went
        abroad early in the morning that a woman was come! They had
        seen a calico dress hanging out of a wagon down at the
        camping ground -- sign of emigrants from over the great
        plains. Everybody went down there, and a shout went up when
        an actual, bona fide dress was discovered fluttering in the
        wind! The male emigrant was visible. The miners said:<br />
        <br />
        "Fetch her out!"<br />
        <br />
        He said: "It is my wife, gentlemen -- she is sick -- we
        have been robbed of money, provisions, everything, by the
        Indians -- we want to rest."<br />
        <br />
        "Fetch her out! We've got to see her!"<br />
        <br />
        That was the only reply.<br />
        <br />
        He "fetched her out," and they swung their hats and sent up
        three rousing cheers and a tiger; and they crowded around
        and gazed at her, and touched her dress, and listened to
        her voice with the look of men who listened to a memory
        rather than a present reality -- and then they collected
        twenty-five hundred dollars in gold and gave it to the man,
        and swung their hats again and gave three more cheers, and
        went home satisfied.<br />

          <font size="-1"><b>EXORBITANT RATES</b></font>
        </center><br />
        A year or two ago I dined in San Francisco with the family
        of a pioneer, and talked with his daughter, a young lady
        whose first experience in San Francisco was an adventure,
        though she herself did not remember it, as she was only two
        or three years old at the time. Her father said that, after
        landing from the ship, they were walking up the street, a
        servant leading the party with the little girl in her arms.
        And presently a huge miner, bearded, belted, spurred, and
        bristling with deadly weapons -- just down from a long
        mining campaign in the mountains, evidently barred the way,
        stopped the servant, and stood gazing, with a face all
        alive with gratification and astonishment. Then he said,
        reverently:<br />
        <br />
        "Well, if it ain't a child!" And then he snatched a little
        leather sack out of his pocket and said to the
        servant:<br />
        <br />
        "There's a hundred and fifty dollars in dust, there, and
        I'll give it to you to let me kiss the child!"<br />
        <br />
        That anecdote is true.<br />
        <br />
        But see how things change. Sitting at that dinner table,
        listening to that anecdote, if I had offered double the
        money for the privilege of kissing the same child, I would
        have been refused. Seventeen added years had far more than
        doubled the price.<br />

        </center><br />
        And while upon this subject I will remark that once in Star
        City, in the Humboldt Mountains, I took my place in a sort
        of long, post-office single-file of miners, to patiently
        await my chance to peep through a crack in a cabin and get
        a sight of the splendid new sensation -- a genuine, live
        Woman! And at the end of three-quarters of an hour my turn
        came, and I put my eye to the crack, and there she was,
        with one arm akimbo, and tossing flap jacks in a frying pan
        with the other. And she was 165 years old, and hadn't a
        tooth in her head. However, she was a woman and therefore
        we were glad to see her and to make her welcome.<br />

          <font size="-1"><b>THE FAMOUS "CEMENT" MINE</b></font>
        </center><br />
        It was somewhere in the neighborhood of Mono Lake that the
        wonderful Whiteman cement mine was supposed to lie. Every
        now and then it would be reported that this mysterious Mr.
        W. had passed stealthily through Esmeralda at dead of
        night, and then we would have a wild excitement -- because
        he must be steering for his secret mine, and now was the
        time to follow him. In less than three hours after daylight
        all the horses and mules and donkeys in the vicinity would
        be bought, hired or stolen, and half the community would be
        off for the mountains, following in the wake of Whiteman.
        But W. would drift about through the mountain gorges for
        days together, in a purposeless sort of way, until the
        provisions of the miners ran out, and they would have to go
        back home. I have known it reported at eleven at night, in
        a large mining camp, that W. had just passed through, and
        in two hours, the streets, so quiet before, would be
        swarming with men and animals. Every individual would be
        trying to be very secret, but yet venturing to whisper to
        just one neighbor that W. had passed through. And long
        before daylight -- this in the dead of Winter -- the
        stampede would be complete and the camp deserted, and the
        whole population gone chasing after W. I ought to know,
        because I was one of those fools myself.<br />
        <br />
        But it was enough to make a fool of nearly any body. The
        tradition was that in the early immigration, twenty years
        ago, three young Germans, brothers, who had survived an
        Indian massacre on the Plains, wandered on foot through the
        deserts, avoiding all trails and roads, and simply holding
        a westerly direction and hoping to find California before
        they starved or died of fatigue. And in a gorge in the
        mountains they sat down to rest one day, when one of them
        noticed a curious vein of cement running along the ground,
        shot full of lumps of shining yellow metal. They saw that
        it was gold, and that here was a fortune to be acquired in
        a single day. The vein was about as wide as a curb stone,
        and fully two-thirds of it was pure gold. Every pound of
        the wonderful cement was worth well-nigh $200. Each of the
        brothers loaded himself with about twenty-five pounds of
        it, and then they covered up all traces of the vein, made a
        rude drawing of the locality and the principal landmarks in
        the vicinity, and started westward again. But troubles
        thickened about them. In their wanderings one brother fell
        and broke his leg, and the others were obliged to go on and
        leave him to die in the wilderness. Another, worn out and
        starving, gave up by and bye, and lay down to die, but
        after two or three weeks of incredible hardships, the third
        reached the settlements of California exhausted, sick, and
        his mind deranged by his sufferings. He had thrown away all
        his cement but a few fragments, but these were sufficient
        to set everybody wild with excitement. However, he had had
        enough of the cement country, and nothing could induce him
        to lead a party thither. He was entirely content to work on
        a farm for wages. But he gave W. his map, and described the
        cement region as well as he could, and thus transferred the
        curse to that gentleman -- for when I had my accidental
        glimpse of Mr. W. in '62, he had been hunting for the lost
        mine, in hunger and thirst, poverty and sickness, for
        twelve or thirteen years. Some people believed he had found
        it, but most people believed he hadn't. I saw a piece of
        cement as large as my fist which was said to have been
        given to W. by the young German, and it was of rather a
        seductive nature. Lumps of virgin gold were as thick in it
        as raisins in a slice of fruit cake. The privilege of
        working such a mine about one week would be sufficient for
        a man of reasonable desire. -- <i>Mark Twain</i><br />
