        <p>Published early in 1872, MT's second major work is about
        going west to dig for wealth in the rocks of Nevada and
        ultimately finding it instead as a writer and entertainer.
        It was written between 1870 and the end of 1871, and based
        on experiences MT had had (mostly as Samuel Clemens, of
        course) between 1861 and 1866. In between these two sets of
        dates, in 1867, the transcontinental railroad was
        completed, an event which, MT wrote his publisher, "has
        turned so much attention in that direction" -- that is, to
        the West. As a travel narrative that keeps going west, the
        book was written and advertised as a companion to the
        eastward moving <i>Innocents Abroad</i>. During the long
        and often difficult period of writing it, MT's mood swung
        often between discouragement and enthusiasm. <i>Roughing
        It</i> sold well, though it was never as popular with
        American readers as <i>Innocents</i> . Its ultimate value
        to MT may have been to turn his imagination in directions
        that became, as his career went on, the sources of his
        greatest power -- that is, to vernacular American
        experience and toward his own past.</p>
