        <p>Mark Twain's new volume, <i>Roughing It</i>, is also in
        part tropical in its subject. Among its most entertaining
        chapters are those which describe the author's visit to the
        Hawaiian Islands--chapters which, first published as
        letters to a California newspaper, are here gathered up,
        with some excisions, in a permanent form. In this work Mr.
        Clemens has produced one of his more readable volumes. The
        fact that he had written much of it before reaching its
        present fame as a humorist is in its favor. Thackeray said
        of his earlier efforts: "It makes me laugh when I think of
        the old days, and how much better I wrote for them then,
        and got a shilling where I now get ten." We only wish that
        Mr. Clemens had made fewer alterations than he has made in
        those rollicking, often ludicrous descriptions, the
        <i>Sacramento Union</i> letters here reprinted. As it is,
        we can imagine the despair with which the less intuitive
        reader will struggle to separate the nonsense from the
        sense, the fact from the fiction, the portraiture from the
        exaggerations of these pages. Mark Twain's humor is in this
        respect peculiarly and purposely tantalizing, though not,
        therefore, less enjoyable. The sketches of Western life are
        equally amusing. We may remark, too, that his fun is not
        dependent upon bad spelling or bad grammar. He writes good
        English, and we can commend the book to all who enjoy the
        wild Western drollery of which Mark Twain is the ablest
        living master. As a remarkably full repository of Western
        slang this work has a literary interest which will give it
        a permanent value to the student of Americanisms.</p>
