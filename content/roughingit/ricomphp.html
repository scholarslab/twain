        </center><img src="comphp1.gif" align="left" alt= "1872 ILLUSTRATION" />

        <p>The popularity of <i>Innocents Abroad</i> made both MT
        and Elisha Bliss, his publisher, anxious to produce a
        sequel. "I mean to write another book during the summer,"
        MT wrote Mrs. Fairbanks in early January, 1870;
        "[<i>Innocents</i>] has proven such a surprising success
        that I feel encouraged." He did in fact begin his second
        book in August, but he didn't finish it until October, 1871
        -- after a long struggle with a series of family medical
        problems and his own doubts about his ability to write
        another best-seller.</p>

        <p>It wasn't until July, 1870, when he signed a contract to
        write a new 600-page subscription book, that he chose a
        subject: he decided "to do up Nevada and California" in a
        text that, like his first book, would combine travel,
        information and humor with copious illustrations. In the
        flush times of starting it, he was enthusiastic, telling
        Bliss in September that this "book will jump right straight
        into contintental celebrity." Deaths in his family, even
        one in his own house, the premature birth of his first
        child and his wife's near-fatal bout with typhoid, though,
        probably kept him from writing much until the spring, 1871,
        when he moved his family out of Buffalo. They spent the
        spring and summer in Elmira, and for the first time MT
        discovered the attractions of writing at Quarry Farm.
        Confidence was harder to come by. In late April he told
        Mrs. Fairbanks that "I am pegging away at my book, but will
        have no success," and that in some negative newspaper
        notices he heard "a popular writer's death-rattle."</p>

        <p>In the Barrett Collection is a seven-page letter MT
        wrote Bliss on 15 May 1871, in the midst of this sustained
        period of composition. The letter is written in one of MT's
        exhuberant moods, but captures a sense of how prolonged and
        hard his labor had been. You can <font size=
        "-1"><b><a href="mtlet2eb.html">SEE THE
        LETTER</a></b></font> for yourself, both text and
        manuscript. The "Dedication" MT sends Bliss in it -- "To
        the Late Cain," the biblical murderer -- was never used.
        And the plan he outlines there, about writing so much that
        he'll be able to revise and trim the manuscript before
        sending it to the printer, crashed when he took the MS to
        Hartford in August, and discovered that all that he'd
        written would, even when supplemented by plenty of pictures
        and three appendices, just barely add up to the 600 pages
        subscribers expected for their money.</p><img src=

        <p>Although the manuscript of <i>Roughing It</i> has been
        lost, the book's unevenness -- its intermittent use of the
        first-person protagonist, for example -- testifies to the
        difficulties MT had writing it. One thing that isn't clear
        from the evidence we have is when in the course of writing
        the book MT decided to re-use material that he'd originally
        published in newspapers. In his descriptions of the book
        there had never been any mention of including the Sandwich
        Islands (as Hawaii was then called) in its itinerary, but
        at some point, probably to fill pages, he decided to
        incorporate versions of 13 of the 25 letters he'd written
        about the islands in 1866 for the Sacramento <i>Union</i>,
        on his first assignment as a travel writer. 6 of the 8
        letters he wrote in 1869-1870 for the Buffalo
        <i>Express</i>, under the running title "Around the World,"
        were also recycled in 8 chapters of <i>Roughing It</i>. The
        links below will take you to a selection of these earlier
        writings, and allow you to compare MT's newspaper texts
        with the way the passages appear in the book.</p>
