        It was in this Sac Valley that a deal of the most lucrative
        of the early gold mining was done, and you may still see,
        in places, its grassy slopes and levels torn and guttered
        and disfigured by the avaricious spoilers of fifteen and
        twenty years ago. You may see such disfigurements far and
        wide over California -- and in some such places, where only
        meadows and forests are visible -- not a living creature,
        not a house, no stick or stone or remnant of a ruin, and
        not a sound, not even a whisper to disturb the Sabbath
        stillness -- you will find it hard to believe that there
        stood at one time a wildly, fiercely-flourishing little
        city, of two thousand or three thousand souls, with its
        newspaper, fire company, brass band, volunteer militia,
        bank, hotels, noisy Fourth of July processions and
        speeches, gambling hells crammed with tobacco smoke,
        profanity, and rough-bearded men of all nations and colors,
        with tables heaped with glittering gold dust sufficient for
        the revenues of a German principality -- streets crowded
        and rife with business -- town lots worth $400 a front foot
        -- labor, laughter, music, dancing, swearing, fighting,
        shooting, stabbing -- a bloody inquest and a man for
        breakfast every morning -- every <i>thing</i> that goes to
        make life happy and desirable -- all the appointments and
        appurtenances of a thriving and prosperous and promising
        young city, -- and <i>now</i> nothing is left but a
        lifeless, homeless solitude. The men are gone, the houses
        have vanished, even the <i>name</i> of the place is
        forgotten. In no other land do towns so absolutely die and
        disappear, as in the old mining regions of
        California.<br />

        It was a driving, vigorous restless population in those
        days. It was a curious population in those days. It was the
        <i>only</i> population of the kind that the world has ever
        seen gathered together, and it is not likely that the world
        will ever see its like again. For, mark you, it was an
        assemblage of 200,000 <i>young</i> men -- not simpering,
        dainty, kid-gloved weaklings, but stalwart, muscular,
        dauntless young braves, brimful of push and energy, and
        royally endowed with every attribute that goes to make up a
        peerless and magnificent manhood -- the very pick and
        choice of the world's glorious ones. No women, no children,
        no gray and stooping veterans, -- none but erect,
        bright-eyed, quickmoving, strong-handed young giants -- the
        strangest population, the finest population, the most
        gallant host that ever trooped down the startled solitudes
        of an unpeopled land. And where are they now? Scattered to
        the ends of the earth -- or prematurely aged and decrepit
        -- or shot or stabbed in street affrays -- or dead of
        disappointed hopes and broken hearts -- all gone, or nearly
        all -- victims devoted upon the altar of the golden calf --
        the noblest holocaust that even wafted its sacrificial
        incense heavenward. California has much to answer for in
        this destruction of the flower of the world's young
        chivalry.<br />
        <br />
        It was a splendid population -- for all the slow, sleepy,
        sluggishbrained sloths staid at home -- you never find that
        sort of people among pioneers -- you can not build pioneers
        out of that sort of material. It was that population that
        gave to California a name for getting up astounding
        enterprises and rushing them through with a magnificent
        dash and daring, and a princely recklessness of cost or
        consequences, which she bears unto this day -- and when she
        projects a new astonisher, the grave world smiles and
        admires as usual, and says, "well, that is California all
        over."

      It was in this Sacramento Valley, just referred to, that a
      deal of the most lucrative of the early gold mining was done,
      and you may still see, in places, its grassy slopes and
      levels torn and guttered and disfigured by the avaricious
      spoilers of fifteen and twenty years ago. You may see such
      disfigurements far and wide over California--and in some such
      places, where only meadows and forests are visible--not a
      living creature, not a house, no stick or stone or remnant of
      a ruin, and not a sound, not even a whisper to disturb the
      Sabbath stillness--you will find it hard to believe that
      there stood at one time a fiercely-flourishing little city,
      of two thousand or three thousand souls, with its newspaper,

      delights and adorns existence--all the appointments and
      appurtenances of a thriving and prosperous and promising
      young city,--and <i>now</i> nothing is left of it all but a
      lifeless, homeless solitude. The men are gone, the houses
      have vanished, even the <i>name</i> of the place is
