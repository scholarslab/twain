        <p>The moon rose up, and flooded mountain and valley and
        ocean with silvery light, and I was not sorry we had lately
        been in trouble, because the consciousness of being safe
        again raised our spirits and made us more capable of
        enjoying the beautiful scene than we would have been
        otherwise. I never breathed such a soft, delicious
        atmosphere before, nor one freighted with such rich
        fragrance. A barber shop is nothing to it.</p>

          <font size="-1"><b>A BATTLEGROUND WHOSE HISTORY IS
          FORGOTTEN</b></font>
        </center>

        <p>Gaily laughing and talking, the party galloped on, and
        with set teeth and bouncing body I clung to the pommel and
        cantered after. Presently we came to a place where no grass
        grew--a wide expanse of deep sand. They said it was an old
        battleground. All around everywhere, not three feet apart,
        the bleached bones of men gleamed white in the moonlight.
        We picked up a lot of them for mementoes. I got quite a
        number of arm bones and leg bones-of great chiefs, maybe,
        who had fought savagely in that fearful battle in the old
        days, when blood flowed like wine where we now stood--and
        wore the choicest of them out on Oahu afterward, trying to
        make him go. All sorts of bones could be found except
        skulls; but a citizen said, irreverently, that there had
        been an unusual number of "skull hunters" there lately--a
        species of sportsmen I had never heard of before. The
        conversation at this point took a unique and ghastly turn.
        A gentleman said:</p>

        <p>"Give me some of your bones, Miss Blank; I'll carry them
        for you."</p>

        <p>Another said:</p>

        <p>"You haven't got bones enough, Mrs. Blank; here's a good
        shinbone, if you want it."</p>

        <p>Such observations as these fell from the lips of ladies
        with reference to their queer newly-acquired property:</p>

        <p>"Mr. Brown, will you please hold some of my bones for me
        a minute?" And, "Mr. Smith, you have got some of my bones;
        and you have got one, too, Mr. Jones; and you have got my
        spine, Mr. Twain. Now don't any of you gentlemen get my
        bones all mixed up with yours so that you can't tell them
        apart."</p>

        <p>These remarks look very irreverent on paper, but they
        did not sound so, being used merely in a business way and
        with no intention of making sport of the remains. I did not
        think it was just right to carry off any of these bones,
        but we did it, anyhow. We considered that it was at least
        as right as it is for the Hawaiian Government and the city
        of Honolulu (which is the most excessively moral and
        religious town that can be found on the map of the world),
        to permit those remains to lie decade after decade, to
        bleach and rot in the sun and wind and suffer desecration
        by careless strangers and by the beasts of the field,
        unprotected by even a worm fence. Call us hard names if you
        will, you statesmen and missionaries! but I say shame upon
        you, that after raising a nation from idolatry to
        Christianity, and from barbarism to civilization, you have
        not taught it the comment of respect for the dead. Your
        work is incomplete.</p>

        <p>B<font size="-1">Y</font> and by, after a rugged climb,
        we halted on the summit of a hill which commanded a
        far-reaching view. The moon rose and flooded mountain and
        valley and ocean with a mellow radiance, and out of the
        shadows of the foliage the distant lights of Honolulu
        glinted like an encampment of fireflies. The air was heavy
        with the fragrance of flowers. The halt was brief.--Gayly
        laughing and talking, the party galloped on, and I clung to
        the pommel and cantered after. Presently we came to a place
        where no grass grew--a wide expanse of deep sand. They said
