          <h1>Publicizing <i>Roughing It</i></h1>
        </center>

        <p>After the success of <i>Innocents Abroad</i> and MT's
        two eastern lecture tours, there was a lot of interest in
        his "new book," whatever it might be. And throughout most
        of his career MT was a devout believer in the advantages of
        advertising and publicity. But he was anxious about the
        reception of <i>Roughing It</i>: as he wrote David Gray, a
        friend who edited the Buffalo <i>Courier</i>, he feared "it
        would be considered pretty poor stuff, &amp; that therefore
        I had better not let the press get a chance at it."</p>

        <p>What pre-publication publicity the book got, however,
        was almost certainly controlled by MT himself. Three of the
        six blurbs <i>below left</i> were written by Gray, almost
        certainly at the request of MT. He also had friends on the
        <i>Advertiser</i> and former colleagues at the
        <i>Territorial Enterprise</i>, while the <i>American
        Publisher</i>, a promotional monthly put out by MT's
        publisher, was being edited at this time by his brother,
        Orion Clemens. These brief notices help tell the story of
        how slowly the shape and focus of the book evolved.</p>The
        items <i>below right</i> were all produced by the American
        Publishing Company. They help us appreciate how Elisha
        Bliss (and probably MT as well) understood the relationship
        between what MT had written and what contemporary readers
        were willing or eager to buy.

        <p>One of the MT letter's in the Barrett Collection allows
        us to see MT in action as his own publicist: he wrote it 20
        April 1872 to James Redpath, his agent for the lyceum
        circuit, asking him to "jam" a notice about the popularity
        of <i>Roughing It</i> into the <i>Boston Advertiser</i> --
        <font size="-1"><b><a href="ripublet2.html">SEE
        LETTER</a></b></font>.</p>

        </center>

        <p>In another Barrett letter, written a year after
        <i>Roughing It</i> was published, MT offers Bliss his own
        explanation for the book's relative failure, and sums up
        the lesson he has learned about the value of an "early
        journalist boost" and "prompt notoriety" for his books.
        He's writing <i>The Gilded Age</i> at the time, and
        promises Bliss he'll make sure its publication gets plenty
        of attention -- <font size="-1"><b><a href=
