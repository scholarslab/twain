        Friend Bliss:</p>

        <p>&#x00A0; &#x00A0; Yrs rec'd enclosing check for $703.35. The
        old "Innocents" holds out handsomely.</p>

        <p>&#x00A0; &#x00A0; I feel confident that House will make a
        most readable book. Shall write him what you say.</p>

        <p>&#x00A0; &#x00A0; I have MS. enough on hand now, to make
        (allowing for engravings) about 400 pages of the book --
        consequently am two-thirds done. I intended to run up to
        Hartford about the middle of the week &amp; take
        [<font size="-1"><b><a href=
        "javascript:Start('mtlet2eb2.html')">PAGE 2</a></b></font>]
        it along; because it has chapters in it that ought by all
        means to be in the prospectus; but I find myself so
        thoroughly interested in my work, now (a thing I have not
        experienced for months) that I can't bear to lose a single
        moment of the inspiration. So I will stay here &amp; peg
        away as long as it lasts. My present idea is to write as
        much more as I have already written, &amp; then cull from
        the mass the very best chapters &amp; discard the rest. I
        am not half as well satisfied with the first [<font size=
        "-1"><b><a href="javascript:Start('mtlet2eb3.html')">PAGE
        3</a></b></font>] part of the book as I am with what I am
        writing now. When I get it done I want to see the man who
        will begin to read it and not finish it. If it falls short
        of the Innocents in any respect I shall lose my guess.</p>

        <p>&#x00A0; &#x00A0; When I was writing the Innocents my daily
        "stent" was 30 pages of MS &amp; I hardly ever got beyond
        it; but I have gone over that nearly every day for the last
        ten. That shows that I am writing with a red-hot interest.
        Nothing grieves me now -- [<font size="-1"><b><a href=
        "javascript:Start('mtlet2eb4.html')">PAGE 4</a></b></font>]
        nothing troubles me, bothers me or gets my attention -- I
        don't think of anything but the book, &amp; don't have an
        hour's unhappiness about anything &amp; don't care two
        cents whether school keeps or not. If I keep up my present
        lick three weeks more I shall be able &amp; willing to
        scratch out half of the chapters of the Overland narrative
        -- &amp; shall do it.</p>

        <p>&#x00A0; &#x00A0; You do not mention having received my
        second batch of MS, sent a week or two ago -- about 100
        pages.</p>

        <p>&#x00A0; &#x00A0; If you want to issue [<font size=
        "-1"><b><a href="javascript:Start('mtlet2eb5.html')">PAGE
        5</a></b></font>] a prospectus &amp; go right to
        canvassing, say the word &amp; I will forward some more MS
        -- or send it by hand -- special messenger. Whatever
        chapters you think are unquestionably good, we will retain
        of course, &amp; so they can go into a prospectus as well
        one time as another. The book will be done soon, now. I
        have 1200 pages of MS already written, &amp; am now writing
        200 a week -- more than that, in fact; during past week
        wrote 23 one day, then 30, 33, 35, 52, &amp; 65. -- How's
        that?</p>

        <p>&#x00A0; &#x00A0; [<font size="-1"><b><a href=
        "javascript:Start('mtlet2eb6.html')">PAGE 6</a></b></font>]
        It will be a starchy book, &amp; should be full of snappy
        pictures -- especially pictures woked in with the
        letter-press. The dedication will be worth the price of the
        volume -- thus:</p>

        <center>
          <u>To the Late Cain;</u><br />
          This Book is Dedicated:<br />
        </center>&#x00A0; &#x00A0; Not on account of respect for his
        memory, for it merits little respect; not on account of
        sympathy with him, for his bloody deed placed him without
        the pale of sympathy, strictly speaking: but out of a mere
        humane commiseration for him in that it was his misfortune
        to live in a dark age that knew not the beneficent Insanity
        Plea.

        <p>I think it will do.<br />
        Ys Clemens.</p>

        <p>&#x00A0; &#x00A0; [<font size="-1"><b><a href=
        "javascript:Start('mtlet2eb7.html')">PAGE 7</a></b></font>]
        P.S. The reaction is beginning &amp; my stock is looking
        up. I am getting the bulliest offers for books &amp;
        almanacs, am flooded with lecture invitations, &amp; one
        periodical offers me $6,000 cash for 12 articles, of any
        length &amp; on any subject, treated humorously or
        otherwise.</p>
