          [<i>According to Donald Kinzer, "probably the
          first-ranking of all anti-Catholic best-sellers" was this
          "inside story" of the Church, part spiritual
          autobiography, part expos&eacute;, part paranoid fantasy.
          "Father Chiniquy" was a Canadian Catholic priest who left
          the church to found his own religion, called "Christian
          Catholics," but he gained his greatest renown through
          this long (832 pages) account of his experience and
          disillusionment with Catholicism. First published in
          1886,</i> Fifty Years in the Church of Rome <i>went
          through over forty editions by 1891. It combined scenes
          in which "the Church of Rome" is made to look ridiculous
          (as in the account of monks playing practical jokes in
          the name of humility illustrated with the drawing here)
          with sensationalist charges of corruption and evil.
          Chiniquy's most notorious charge was that Abraham
          Lincoln's assassination was "the work of popery."
          According to Chiniquy, "Booth was nothing but the tool of
          the Jesuits. It was Rome that directed his arm, after
          corrupting his heart and damning his soul." Chiniquy also
          credits Lincoln with having told him in private
          conversation that he saw "a dark cloud on our horizon.
          And that dark cloud is coming from Rome." Chiniquy
          develops that idea in the passages below. The first is
          third of his five Dedications.</i> ]

        I also dedicate this book.

        <p>Americans! You are sleeping on a volcano, and you do not
        suspect it! You are pressing on your bosom a viper which
        will bite you to death, and you do not know it.</p>

        <p>Read this book, and you will see that Rome is the sworn,
        the most implacable, the absolutely irreconcilable and
        deadly enemy of your schools, your institutions, your so
        dearly bought rights and liberties.<br />

        <br />
        <font size="+1">From Chapter 59, "Rome, the Enemy of the
        United States"</font>

        <p>The Americans, with few exceptions, do not pay any
        attention to the dark cloud which is rising at their
        horizon, from Rome. Though that cloud is filled with rivers
        of tears and blood, they let it grow and rise without even
        caring how they will escape from the impending
        hurricane.</p>

        <p>It is to San Francisco that you must go to have an idea
        of the number of secret and powerful organizations with
        which the Church of Rome prepares herself for the impending
        conflict, through which she hopes to destroy the schools,
        and every vestige of human rights and liberties in the
        United States.</p>

        <p>In order to more easily drill the Roman Catholics and
        prepare them for the irrepressible struggle, the Jesuits
        have organized them into a great number of secret societies
        . . .</p>

        <p>Almost all these secret associations are military ones.
        They have their headquarters at San Francisco; but their
        rank and file are scattered all over the United States.
        They number 700,000 soldiers, who, under the name of the
        United States Volunteer Militia, are officered by some of
        the most skillful generals and officers of this Republic. .
        . .</p>

        <p>Rome is in constant conspiracy against the rights and
        liberties of man all over the world; but she is
        particularly so in the United States.</p>

        <p>Long before I was ordained a priest, I knew that my
        church was the most implacable enemy of this Republic. My
        professors of philosophy, history and theology had been
        unanimous in telling me that the principles and laws of the
        Church of Rome were absolutely antagonistic to the laws and
        principles which are the foundation-stones of the
        Constitution of the United States.<br /></p>

        every good Catholic must abhor and destroy, at any
