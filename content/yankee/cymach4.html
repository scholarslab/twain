        <p>The typewriter on the left is a Remington built
        specially for the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. The
        machine on the right is (supposedly) MT's first typewriter,
        also an early Remington. In the autobiographical
        dictations, MT boasted that "I was the first person in the
        world that ever had a telephone in his house" and that "I
        was the first person in the world to <i>apply the
        typemachine to literature</i>." He started typing
        occasional letters on the machine in 1874, and by all
        accounts was the first author ever to have a manuscript
        typed. In his autobiographical dictations he remembered it
        as the manuscript of <i>Tom Sawyer</i> (1874), but
        according to typewriter historian Darryl Rehr, the book was
        <i>Life on the Mississippi</i> (1882), and the machine was
        a Remington No. 2.</p>

        <p>When in 1905 an installment of his autobiography
        mentioning his experience with a typewriter appeared in
        <i>The North American Review</i>, Remington quickly seized
        the opportunity to use his remarks as a plug for their
        machine. The ad below appeared in <i>Harper's</i>.</p>
