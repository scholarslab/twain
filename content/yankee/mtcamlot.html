          <h1>King Arthur's Court in MT's America</h1>

        <p>When Clemens was growing up, the most popular version of
        Camelot in America was Sir Walter Scott's, as expressed in
        romances like <i>Ivanhoe</i> (1819). During MT's career,
        Tennyson's <i>Idylls of the King</i> (1842-1885) was almost
        as widely read as a popular novel. In <a href=
        "cyinlife.html">Chapters 40 and 46</a> of <i>Life on the
        Mississippi</i> (1883), MT condemned Scott as an
        "enchanter"; Dan Beard, illustrator of <i>Connecticut
        Yankee</i>, was making a similar point visually when he
        drew Merlin to look like Tennyson, as you can see by
        comparing Beard's magician (right) with the picture of the
        English poet laureate (left) taken from the frontispiece of
        an 1893 edition of the <i>Idylls</i> published in
        Baltimore.</p><img src="merlin.gif" align="right" alt= "1889 CONNECTICUT YANKEE ILLUSTRATION" />

        <p>A major goal of MT's novel, as the work of a writer who
        thinks of himself as both a democrat and a realist, is to
        use Hank's "unpoetic" observations of Arthurian England to
        undo the spell he felt 19th-century medievalism had cast
        over Europe's aristocratic past. This is the project Hank
        refers to when he asserts that "none of us has been taught
        to see" the "unspeakably bitter and awful Terror" that the
        feudal system inflicted on the vast majority of people.</p>

        <p>Camelot remains one of the fixed points of reference in
        the imagination of Western culture, but it was an
        especially popular subject at the time MT wrote his novel.
        This portion of the archive presents a few images chosen to
        represent the way MT's times "saw" King Arthur's Court.
        Like Hank Morgan, many of MT's contemporaries traveled
        imaginatively back to Camelot; what they tended to "see" is
        precisely what MT wanted them to re-view.</p>
