          . . . but a great crowd of people gathered and remained
          around the jail all the morning; many of whom were
          intoxicated, and sang and shouted in honor of free
          government and the rights of man. About eleven o'clock, a
          long table was spread under a row of trees which grew in
          the street, not far from the jail, and which appeared to
          me to be of the kind called in Pennsylvania, the pride of
          China. At this table several hundred persons sat down to
          dinner soon after noon, and continued to eat and drink,
          and sing songs in honor of liberty, for more than two
          hours. At the end of the dinner a gentleman rose and
          stood upon his chair, near one end of the table, and
          begged the company to hear him for a few minutes. He
          informed them that he was a candidate for some office --
          but what office it was I do not recollect -- and said,
          that as it was an acknowledged principle of our free
          government, that all men were born free and equal, he
          presumed it would not be deemed an act of arrogance in
          him, to call upon them for their votes at the coming
          election.

          <p>About five o'clock, the jailer came and stood at the
          front door of the jail, and proclaimed, in a very loud
          voice, that a sale of the most valuable slaves would
          immediately take place . . .</p>

          . . . it was near the middle of the forenoon when we
          entered the market square of the town. We dismounted, and
          left our thanks once more for my lord, and then
          approached a crowd assembled in the center of the square,
          to see what might be the object of interest. It was the
          remnant of that old peregrinating band of slaves! So they
          had been dragging their chains about, all this weary
          time. That poor husband was gone, and also many others;
          and some few purchases had been added to the gang. The
          king was not interested, and wanted to move along, but I
          was absorbed, and full of pity. I could not take my eyes
          away from these worn and wasted wrecks of humanity. There
          they sat, grounded upon the ground, silent,
          uncomplaining, with bowed heads, a pathetic sight. And by
          hideous contrast, a redundant orator was making a speech
          to another gathering not thirty steps away, in fulsome
          laudation of "our glorious British liberties!"

          <p>I was boiling. I had forgotten I was a plebeian, I was
          remembering I was a man. Cost what it might, I would
          mount that rostrum and --</p>

          <p>Click! the king and I were handcuffed together! Our
          companions, those servants, had done it; my lord Grip
          stood looking on. The king burst out in a fury, and
          said:</p>

          <p>"What meaneth this ill-mannered jest?"</p>

          <p>My lord merely said to his head miscreant, coolly:</p>

          <p>"Put up the slaves and sell them!"</p>

          <p>SLAVES! The word had a new sound -- and how
          unspeakably awful!</p>
