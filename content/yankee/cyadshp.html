        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Advertising plays a prominent part of the
        narrative of <i>Connecticut Yankee</i>, where even the
        knights' tales at the Round Table or the hermits' penances
        in the Valley of Holiness come to seem like publicity
        campaigns. Hank himself uses advertising seriously to
        promote his various schemes and ironically (on the
        assumption that any connection with advertisements is a
        cheapening one) to undermine the authority of king and
        church.<br />
        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; The campaign to sell his new novel, however,
        proceeded on the same lines MT had used earlier. By
        October, 1889, according to MT's agent at Webster &amp;
        Company, over 400 sales prospectuses had been sent out to
        agents, and "a great many thousand" circulars to
        prospective buyers. In November, a sampling of episodes
        from the novel appeared in <i>The Century Magazine</i>. And
        on December 10, the date of the novel's American
        publication, an interview with MT appeared in <i>The New
        York Times</i>. MT took care to keep the novel's attack on
        religion out of the publicity material. <i>Connecticut
        Yankee</i> was promoted mainly as both a humorous work, and
        as a flattering tribute to American values.<br />
        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; In the early 1890s, Webster published the
        novel, together with <i>Huck Finn</i> and <i>The Prince and
        the Pauper</i>, in a boxed set, and billed all three as
        "the most popular of [MT's] books." Huck would have called
        that "a stretcher": sales of <i>Yankee</i> had been
        disappointing. About 32,000 copies were sold in its first
        year, compared to 67,000 for <i>Innocents Abroad</i> and
        about 50,000 for <i>Huck Finn</i>.<br />
