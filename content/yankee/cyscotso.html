          <p>Mrs. Smedes' <i>A Southern Planter</i> and Mark
          Twain's new lapse into Ibsenity and the cultus of the
          thesis, <i>A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur</i>,
          appear about the same time, and both are pretty sure to
          be widely read in Britain: the latter because Mark Twain
          is currently believed to have been once a writer of funny
          books, and the former because the Sage of Hawarden has
          blessed it. He is not always happy, is the Sage of
          Hawarden, in his selection of books to dignify with his
          <i>imprimatur</i>, having a natural and peculiar leaning
          to religious fiction; but in commending <i>A Southern
          Planter</i> to British readers he has done well. Mrs.
          Smedes' book and Mark Twain's have at first sight little
          enough in common but their transatlantic origin; but that
          view is naught. Nothing could be further removed from the
          blatant frivolity of the Yankee exwag -- "our
          arch-humourist," as Mr. de Howells styles him in the
          current <i>Harper</i>, not without a hint of unconscious
          pathos -- than the record of a noble life which Mrs.
          Smedes has written with such simple piety; and had Mr.
          Clemens been content to write about the court of King
          Arthur as he wrote about Arkansas and the Mexican Plug no
          one would have mentioned the two in the same breath.</p>

          <p>For in those days Mr. Clemens lived to make the
          light-hearted laugh; and his life was a success. But he
          has exhausted his vein, and with faded cap and fools'
          bells jangled has got bewrayed with seriousness and
          bedevilled with a purpose. He treats you to a "lecture"
          in dispraise of monarchical institutions and religious
          establishments as the roots of all evil, and in praise of
          Yankee 'cuteness and Wall Street chicanery as compared to
          the simple fidelity and devotion of the knightly ideal.
          The key to this precious piece of apostolics is contained
          in a frontispiece where the Supreme Yank, the Connecticut
          man in a state of heroism, the Bagman <i>in excelsis</i>,
          is pictured in the act of tickling the nose of the
          British Lion with a switch. Now the life of Thomas Dabney
          -- Virginian aristocrat and slave-owner-- is an effective
          commentary on such violent vulgarity. He was full of just
          those qualities which make the memory of King Arthur
          fragrant. The mainspring of his life was not the almighty
          dollar but <i>noblesse oblige</i>. Amid the prosperity of
          his plantation times, as amid the havoc wrought on his
          and his country's fortunes by the war, his supreme
          purpose was to fulfil the honourable ideal of a
          gentleman. Such an ideal is no doubt inconsistent with
          the democratic notions of the superior Yank; but it is
          not the least precious heritage in the world's history
          for all that, and Mr. Clemens stamps himself when he
          makes the bagman's mistake of bedaubing it with cheap
          wit. It is the ideal which in English literature animated
          Sir Roger de Coverley, and Mr. Allworthy, and Colonel
          Newcome, of whose virtues, indeed, the life of Thomas
          Dabney was in many ways a realisation. Mrs. Smedes has
          done her part of the work very well, except that she
          might have cut down the correspondences with advantage.
          As for Mark Twain, he has turned didactic, and being
          ignorant is also misleading and offensive. His method,
          which was that of Hamibel Chollop, consists in
          attributing every social, political, and economic evil to
          the Crown and the Church. That slavery and Protection
          have flourished under American republican institutions
          does not hinder the ingenious creature from attributing
          their existence to monarchy and what he calls the
          Established Roman Catholic Church. To him that is
          decorous and just. But then he is a bagman with a thesis,
          and his notions of justice and decorum are of those that
          commend themselves to none but renegade Europians --
          Europians of the stamp of Mr. Andrew Carnegie. To add to
          all this that Mr. W. de Howells has taken occasion to
          contrast him and his achievement in bagmanising with
          Cervantes and <i>Don Quixote</i>, somewhat to the
          disadvantage of the latter, is to begin to pity the poor
          devil. After all, he knows no better; after all, he is
          the parent of Huck Finn and Jim the Nigger and the
          genuine Mexican Plug and the incomparable Blue Jay. What
          should he do where Arthur first in court began whose
          proper place is the Capitol, or Tammany Hall, or the
          shadow of the Saint Louis Bridge? What should he do with
          a thesis? What he really wants is a wooden nutmeg or a
          razor-strop.</p>
