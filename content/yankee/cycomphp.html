          <h2>Writing <i>Connecticut Yankee</i></h2>
        </center>The novel was written in three stints of
        composition: the first four chapters in the winter
        1885-1886; fifteen more in the summer 1887; the rest
        (including an interpolated Chapter 10) from the summer of
        1888 through the spring of 1889. In the early stages MT
        told a number of people he never intended to publish it, or
        any other book of his. At that point in his life he
        expected to get very rich from his investments in both the
        Webster publishing company and the Paige typesetting
        machine. When he went back to the manuscript in 1888,
        however, instead of fulfilling that dream, both were
        costing him money. He knew he had to produce a popular book
        to improve his own and the publishing company's cash flow.

        <p>In a way, <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> began with
        <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>. In 1884 MT decided to go back on
        tour as a live performer to help publicize Huck's novel,
        Webster &amp; Co.'s first title. To accompany him on the
        tour he recruited George Washington Cable, the Southern
        novelist, and when in December a sudden rain storm drove MT
        into a bookstore in Rochester, New York, it was Cable who
        handed him a copy of Malory's <i>Morte Darthur</i> and
        suggested he try it.</p>

        <p>MT soon fell under the spell of Malory's prose and the
        chivalric world it recreates. He ordered a separate copy
        for Ozias Pond, traveling with them as tour manager, and on
        4 February 1885 he wrote Livy: "We have all used the quaint
        language of [Malory's] book in talk in the [railroad] cars
        &amp; hotels." From Indianapolis on 8 February he wrote
        Susy about it as "the quaintest and sweetest of all books,"
        and she transcribed the letter into the biography of her
        father she was writing.</p>

        It was apparently sometime during this tour that MT made
        the following entry in his journal, invariably cited as the
        seed from which <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> grew:<br />

        <blockquote>
          Dream of being a knight errant in armor in the middle
          ages. Have the notions &amp; habits of thought of the
          present day mixed with the necessities of that. No
          pockets in the armor. No way to manage certain
          requirements of nature. Can't scratch. Cold in the head
          -- can't blow -- can't get at handkerchief, can't use
          iron sleeve. Iron gets red hot in the sun -- leaks in the
          rain, gets white with frost &amp; freezes me solid in
          winter. Suffer from lice &amp; fleas. Make disagreeable
          clatter when I enter church. Can't dress or undress
          myself. Always getting struck by lightning. Fall down,
          can't get up. See Morte Darthur.
        </blockquote>MT had always been interested in history,
        especially British history. And the kind of humorous sketch
        suggested in this entry -- a burlesque travesty of an
        aristocratic icon -- had long been a staple of his. But
        it's interesting to associate Hank's experiences among
        Arthur's knights with MT's career as an errant lecturer.
        Both are consummate and compulsive performers whose
        identities -- MT as the great American humorist; Hank as
        Sir Boss, the mighty wizard -- are defined by the shows
        they put on for their audiences. As a visitor from
        nineteenth century America, Hank feels like a mysterious
        stranger in Camelot -- and perhaps in the story of Hank's
        popularity and alienation MT is dramatizing his own mixed
        feeling <i>as</i> the great American humorist.

        <p><img src="cyburl.GIF" align="right" alt="1889 ILLUSTRATION OF CONNECTICUT YANKEE" /> According to MT,
        "I began to make notes in my head for a book" almost at
        once, though he doesn't seem to have begun writing it until
        the next winter. By that time his mood about the distant
        past had changed from satiric to nostalgic; at least,
        that's the tone of the next set of notes he made in his
        journal about the book, which included the following
        ideas:<br /></p>

        <blockquote>
          Bring out as a holiday book. Title, "The Lost Land." . .
          . He mourns his lost land -- has come to England &amp;
          revisited it, but it is all changed &amp; become old, so
          old! -- &amp; it was so fresh &amp; new, so virgin
          before. . . . Has lost all interest in life -- is found
          dead next morning -- suicide.
        </blockquote>A holiday book that ends with a suicide is a
        startling idea, but typical of the many ambivalences MT
        brought to the project. It was in fact published (on 10
        December 1889) as a holiday book. By then the book that
        began with a comic "dream" had become a mix of slapstick
        comedy, irreverent burlesque, sentimental pathos, political
        satire, moral indignation, dark humor and high-tech
        violence that ends with a nightmarish apocalypse and Hank's
        abrupt death.

        <p>The novel itself is the best record of those
        ambivalences: MT's complex and changing intentions and
        feelings about the European past and the American present,
        about Hank's enactment of a celebrity self and his own
        performance as a writer. Other aspects of the novel's
        composition can be studied in the <a href=
        "cysrcshp.html"><font size="-1">SOURCES AND
        PRE-TEXTS</font></a> section of the archive. Another index
        of his intentions is the public reading MT gave at
        Governor's Island in New York on 11 November 1886 (when his
        central character's name was Robert Smith). On that
        occasion he read from the manuscript of the opening
        chapters, and then summed up the rest of the story. The New
        York papers reported his words in detail. Two of the
        stories are linked below. And reprintings of these stories
        must have reached Mrs. Mary Fairbanks, MT's mentor from the
        beginning of his career, in Cincinnati, because she
        apparently wrote him to express alarm about the mischief he
        might be up to with the Camelot legend. Her letter no
        longer survives, but MT's reply to her does, and it offers
        yet another (not necessarily more or less trustworthy)
        indication of his intentions.</p>
