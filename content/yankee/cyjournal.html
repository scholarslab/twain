          <h2>Knightly Humor</h2>
        </center>[<i>MT himself identified the following undated
        journal entry as the seed from which</i> Connecticut Yankee
        <i>grew. According to Henry Nash Smith, it was "apparently
        made during the tour with Cable."</i>]<br />

        <blockquote>
          Dream of being a knight in armor in the middle ages. Have
          the notions &amp; habits of thought of the present day
          mixed with the necessities of that. No pockets in the
          armor. No way to manage certain requirements of nature.
          Can't scratch. Cold in the head -- can't blow -- can't
          get at handkerchief, can't use iron sleeve. Iron gets red
          hot in the sun -- leaks in the rain, gets white with
          frost &amp; freezes me solid in winter. Suffer from lice
          &amp; fleas. Make disagreeable clatter when I enter
          church. Can't dress or undress myself. Always getting
          struck by lightning. Fall down, can't get up. See Morte
          DArthur.
