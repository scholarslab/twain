        <p>MT first heard about James Paige and his automatic
        typesetting machine in 1880, at which time he invested
        $5000 in its prospects. By 1887 he'd invested a total of
        $50,000, and as principal investor was putting about $3000
        a month into its promise to set type more efficiently and
        less expensively than merely human compositors or any of
        its mechanical competitors like the Linotype. Believing
        that there were millions in those prospects, he bought the
        rights to the machine outright in 1889, the same year the
        <i>Yankee</i> was published; within a few more years, the
        machine, as chief among a series of bad speculations,
        bankrupted him.</p>

        <p>At the height of its development, the Paige machine had
        over 18,000 separate parts, and was designed (with the help
        of one operator at the keyboard) to set over 8000 ems an
        hour. Before it could be made to work consistently,
        however, the Linotype machine swept the market MT had hoped
        to corner.</p>
