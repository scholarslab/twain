  <hr />

  <p>it stunned me so, when I first found it out, that I couldn't
  believe it; it didn't seem natural. But as soon as my mental
  sight cleared and I got a right focus on it, I saw I was
  mistaken; it was natural. For this reason: a king is a mere
  artificiality, and so a king's feelings, like the impulses of an
  automatic doll, are mere artificialities; but as a man, he is a
  reality, and his feelings, as a man, are real, not phantoms. It
  shames the average man to be valued below his own estimate of his
  worth, and the king certainly wasn't anything more than an
  average man, if he was up that high.</p>

  <p>We had a rough time for a month, tramping to and fro in the
  earth, and suffering. And what Englishman was the most interested
  in the slavery question by that time? His grace the king! Yes;
  from being the most indifferent, he was become the most
  interested. He was become the bitterest hater of the institution
  I had ever heard talk. And so I ventured to ask once more a
  question which I had asked years before and had gotten such a
  sharp answer that I had not thought it prudent to meddle in the
  matter further. Would he abolish slavery? His answer was as sharp
  as before, but it was music this time; I shouldn't ever wish to
  hear pleasanter, though the profanity was not good, being
  awkwardly put together, and with the crash-word almost in the
  middle instead of at the end, where, of course, it ought to have
  been.</p>
