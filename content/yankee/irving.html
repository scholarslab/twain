<td>Sir Henry Irving
  was perhaps the period's most respected and popular actor. Five
  years after MT's novel appeared, he comissioned a new production
  of <i>King Arthur</i> as a vehicle in which he and his leading
  lady Ellen Terry could star as Arthur and Guenever. The play
  opened at London's Lyceum Theatre on 12 January 1895 (the drawing 
  <i>at left</i>, by Sir Bernard Partridge, is from a souvenir program of that production). That
  fall, 105 performances later, he brought it with him to the
  United States on his fifth American tour. According to his
  grandson's biography, "<i>King Arthur</i> proved to be immensely
  popular with American audiences." In St. Louis, after a delighted
  house called the actor on stage for a speech, "Irving thanked
  them 'for the appreciation of this effort to illustrate an old
  world legend,' adding after an effective pause, 
  '-- <i>your</i> old world legend.' This reminder of common
  ancestry was widely reported and applauded." The success of both
  the drama and the remark indicate that, despite MT's attempt to
  wean his contemporaries from aristocratic and British
  allegiances, many in his audience were still happy to be
  enchanted by the legend of Camelot.</td>
