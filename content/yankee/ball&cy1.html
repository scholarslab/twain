        . . . my poor mother, when she saw me leaving her for the
        last time, ran after me, took me down from the horse,
        clasped me in her arms, and wept loudly and bitterly over
        me. . . . My mother then turned to him and cried, "Oh,
        master, do not take me from my child!" Without making any
        reply, he gave her two or three heavy blows on the
        shoulders with his raw-hide, snatched me from her arms,
        handed me to my master, and seizing her by one arm, dragged
        her back towards the place of sale. My master then
        quickened the pace of his horse; and as we advanced, the
        cries of my poor parent became more and more indistinct --
        at length they died away in the distance, and I never again
        heard the voice of my poor mother. Young as I was, the
        horrors of that day sank deeply into my heart, and even at
        this time, though half a century has elapsed, the terrors
        of the scene return with painful vividness upon my
        memory.</td>

        The moment the girl was delivered from her irons, she flung
        herself, all tears and frantic sobbings, into the arms of
        the slave who had turned away his face when she was
        whipped. He strained her to his breast, and smothered her
        face and the child's with kisses, and washed them with the
        rain of his tears. I suspected. I inquired. Yes, I was
        right; it was husband and wife. They had to be torn apart
        by force; the girl had to be dragged away, and she
        struggled and fought and shrieked like one gone mad till a
        turn of the road hid her from sight; and even after that,
        we could still make out the fading plaint of those receding
        shrieks. And the husband and father, with his wife and
        child gone, never to be seen by him again in life? -- well,
        the look of him one might not bear at all, and so I turned
        away; but I knew I should never get his picture out of my
        mind again, and there it is to this day, to wring my
        heartstrings whenever I think of it.</td>
