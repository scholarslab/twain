          <p>...Mr. Clemens, we call him, rather than Mark Twain,
          because we feel that in this book our arch-humorist
          imparts more of his personal quality than in anything
          else he has done. Here he is to the full the humorist, as
          we know him; but he is very much more, and his strong,
          indignant, often infuriate hate of injustice, and his
          love of equality, burn hot through the manifold
          adventures and experiences of the tale. What he thought
          about prescriptive right and wrong, we had partly learned
          in <i>The Prince and the Pauper</i>, and in
          <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, but it is this last book which
          gives his whole mind. The elastic scheme of the romance
          allows it to play freely back and forward between the
          sixth century and the nineteenth century; and often while
          it is working the reader up to a blasting contempt of
          monarchy and aristocracy in King Arthur's time, the dates
          are magically shifted under him, and he is confronted
          with exactly the same principles in Queen Victoria's
          time. The delicious satire, the marvellous wit, the wild,
          free, fantastic humor are the colors of the tapestry,
          while the texture is a humanity that lives in every
          fibre. At every moment the scene amuses, but it is all
          the time an object-lesson in democracy. It makes us glad
          of our republic and our epoch; but it does not flatter us
          into a fond content with them; there are passages in
          which we see that the noble of Arthur's day, who battened
          on the blood and sweat of his bondmen, is one in essence
          with the capitalist of Mr. Harrison's day who grows rich
          on the labor of his underpaid wagemen. Our incomparable
          humorist, whose sarcasm is so pitiless to the greedy and
          superstitious clerics of Britain, is in fact of the same
          spirit and intention as those bishops who, true to their
          office, wrote the other day from New York to all their
          churches in the land:</p>

          <blockquote>It is a fallacy in social economics, as well as in
          Christian thinking, to look upon the labor of men and
          women and children as a commercial commodity, to be
          bought and sold as an inanimate and irresponsible
          thing.... The heart and soul of a man cannot be bought or
          hired in any market, and to act as if they were not
          needed in the doing of the world's vast work is as
          unchristian as it is unwise.</blockquote>

          <p>Mr. Clemens's glimpses of monastic life in Arthur's
          realm are true enough; and if they are not the whole
          truth of the matter, one may easily get it in some such
          book as Mr. Brace's <i>Gesta Christi</i>, where the full
          light of history is thrown upon the transformation of the
          world, if not the church, under the influence of
          Christianity. In the mean time, if any one feels that the
          justice done the churchmen of King Arthur's time is too
          much of one kind, let him turn to that heart-breaking
          scene where the brave monk stands with the mother and her
          babe on the scaffold, and execrates the hideous law which
          puts her to death for stealing enough to keep her from
          starving. It is one of many passages in the story where
          our civilization of to-day sees itself mirrored in the
          cruel barbarism of the past, the same in principle, and
          only softened in custom. With shocks of consciousness,
          one recognizes in such episodes that the laws are still
          made for the few against the many, and that the
          preservation of things, not men, is still the ideal of
          legislation. But we do not wish to leave the reader with
          the notion that Mr. Clemens's work is otherwise than
          obliquely serious. Upon the face of it you have a story
          no more openly didactic than <i>Don Quixote</i>, which we
          found ourselves more than once thinking of, as we read,
          though always with the sense of the kindlier and truer
          heart of our time. Never once, we believe, has Mark Twain
          been funny at the cost of the weak, the unfriended, the
          helpless; and this is rather more than you can say of Cid
          Hamet ben Engeli. But the two writers are of the same
          humorous largeness; and when the Connecticut man rides
          out at dawn, in a suit of Arthurian armor, and gradually
          heats up under the mounting sun in what he calls that
          stove; and a fly gets between the bars of his visor; and
          he cannot reach his handkerchief in his helmet to wipe
          the sweat from his streaming face; and at last when he
          cannot bear it any longer, and dismounts at the side of a
          brook, and makes the distressed damsel who has been
          riding behind him take off his helmet, and fill it with
          water, and pour gallon after gallon down the collar of
          his wrought-iron cutaway, you have a situation of as huge
          a grotesqueness as any that Cervantes conceived.</p>

          <p>The distressed damsel is the Lady Corisande; he calls
          her Sandy, and he is troubled in mind at riding about the
          country with her in that way; for he is not only very
          doubtful that there is nothing in the castle where she
          says there are certain princesses imprisoned and
          persecuted by certain giants, but he feels that it is not
          quite nice: he is engaged to a young lady in East
          Hartford, and he finds Sandy a fearful bore at first,
          though in the end he loves and marries her, finding that
          he hopelessly antedates the East Hartford young lady by
          thirteen centuries. How he gets into King Arthur's realm,
          the author concerns himself as little as any of us do
          with the mechanism of our dreams. In fact the whole story
          has the lawless operation of a dream; none of its
          prodigies are accounted for: they take themselves for
          granted, and neither explain nor justify themselves. Here
          he is, that Connecticut man, foreman of one of the shops
          in Colt's pistol factory, and full to the throat of the
          invention and the self-satisfaction of the nineteenth
          century, at the court of the mythic Arthur. He is
          promptly recognized as a being of extraordinary powers,
          and becomes the king's right-hand man, with the title of
          The Boss; but as he has apparently no lineage or blazon,
          he has no social standing, and the meanest noble has
          precedence of him, just as would happen in England
          to-day. The reader may faintly fancy the consequences
          flowing from this situation, which he will find so
          vividly fancied for him in the book; but they are simply
          irreportable. The scheme confesses allegiance to nothing;
          the incidents, the facts follow as they will. The Boss
          cannot rest from introducing the apparatus of our time,
          and he tries to impart its spirit, with a thousand most
          astonishing effects. He starts a daily paper in Camelot;
          he torpedoes a holy well; he blows up a party of insolent
          knights with a dynamite bomb; when he and the king
          disguise themselves as peasants, in order to learn the
          real life of the people, and are taken and sold for
          slaves, and then sent to the gallows for the murder of
          their master, Launcelot arrives to their rescue with live
          hundred knights on bicycles. It all ends with the Boss's
          proclamation of the Republic after Arthur's death, and
          his destruction of the whole chivalry of England by
          electricity.</p>

          <p>We can give no proper notion of the measureless play
          of an imagination which has a gigantic jollity in its
          feats, together with the tenderest sympathy. There are
          incidents in this wonder-book which wring the heart for
          what has been of cruelty and wrong in the past, and leave
          it burning with shame and hate for the conditions which
          are of like effect in the present. It is one of its
          magical properties that the fantastic fable of Arthur's
          far-off time is also too often the sad truth of ours; and
          the magician who makes us feel in it that we have just
          begun to know his power, teaches equality and fraternity
          in every phase of his phantasmagory.</p>

          <p>He leaves, to be sure, little of the romance of the
          olden time, but no one is more alive to the simple,
          mostly tragic poetry of it; and we do not remember any
          book which imparts so clear a sense of what was truly
          heroic in it. With all his scorn of kingcraft, and all
          his ireful contempt of caste, no one yet has been fairer
          to the nobility of character which they cost so much too
          much to develop. The mainly ridiculous Arthur of Mr.
          Clemens has his moments of being as fine and high as the
          Arthur of Lord Tennyson; and the keener light which shows
          his knights and ladies in their childlike simplicity and
          their innocent coarseness throws all their best qualities
          into relief. This book is in its last effect the most
          matter-of-fact narrative, for it is always true to human
          nature, the only truth possible, the only truth
          essential, to fiction. The humor of the conception and of
          the performance is simply immense; but more than ever Mr.
          Clemens's humor seems the sunny break of his intense
          conviction. We must all recognize him here as first of
          those who laugh, not merely because his fun is
          unrivalled, but because there is a force of right feeling
          and clear thinking in it that never got into fun before,
          except in <i>The Bigelow Papers</i>. Throughout, the text
          in all its circumstance and meaning is supplemented by
          the illustrations of an artist who has entered into the
          wrath and the pathos as well as the fun of the thing, and
          made them his own.</p>

          <p>This kind of humor, the American kind, the kind
          employed in the service of democracy, of humanity, began
          with us a long time ago; in fact Franklin may be said to
          have torn it with the lightning from the skies. Some
          time, some such critic as Mr. T. S. Perry (if we ever
          have another such) will study its evolution in the
          century of our literature and civilization; but no one
          need deny himself meanwhile the pleasure we feel in Mr.
          Clemens's book as its highest development.</p>
