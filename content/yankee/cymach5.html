        <p>In the same year that Alexander Graham Bell patented the
        telephone, 1876, MT had one installed in his home. The wire
        ran from the local newspaper office. I haven't found a
        picture of MT's machine, but it probably looked a lot like
        the machine at left: Bell's box telephone of 1877, with the
        handheld receiver at the bottom. In <i>Connecticut
        Yankee</i> Hank calls the phone a "modern miracle,"
        although immediately after that tribute he acknowledges
        that, because of static, it can transform "Valley of
        Holiness" into "Valley of Hellishness."</p>
