        <p>"Where is Farmington Avenue?" asked a stranger on
        arriving at the Hartford (Conn.) station the other day.</p>

        <p>"Do you know Mark Twain's?" was the interrogative
        response, from which it would seem that Mark is a more
        conspicuous object in topography of Hartford than the
        magnificent avenue on which his house stands. If you walk
        along this avenue for a mile, you come to Mark Twain's on
        the left, at 351. The house is in a beautiful situation,
        especially in Summer, but just now the trees about it are
        bare, the creepers on the veranda are withered, and no
        evergreen shrubs brighten the lawn.</p>

        <p>Two black-and-tan collies, however, guarded the entrance
        the other day, and a pull at the bell brought a polite
        negro to the door. Mr. Clemens soon appeared, clad in a
        light gray suit. His fine profusion of hair is silvering
        fast, but remains in a state of artistic disorder
        characteristic of it. His mustache clings to its reddish
        hue, and his heavy eyebrows appropriately maintain a just
        equilibrium as to color.</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens, as is his custom, spoke very quietly and
        slowly. His new book will be published in New York on the
        10th, but before then he will pay a flying visit to Canada.
        He will just look over the frontier and register on the
        other side. He could register nearer home with less
        trouble, but his peep into Canada will secure him copyright
        there and in England. Mr. Clemens had something to say
        about this new book, and about how he had been obliged to
        modify it to suit the English publisher.</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens was one of the first leaders in the modern
        fight for copyright. Many years ago, when only a young
        author, he started in like a knight-errant to secure
        copyright, but the crusade collapsed because the hero was
        not backed up. He advocated and took an active interest in
        the Chace bill of last season.</p>

        <p>"Had the same party been in power, " said Mr. Clemens,
        "I would have gone to Washington again with the boys. But I
        don't know the feeling of the present Congress, and I have
        not much faith in a Republican Congress anyway. They are
        more likely to slap on more protection where it isn't
        needed than to pass a measure which would do some good.
        Everyone ought to get value for his labor, whether he makes
        boots or manuscripts."</p>

        <p>"What do you think of the opinion held by an eminent
        American author, that American literature is now on its
        legs, and does not need protection since it has survived
        and overcome competition with pirated reprints?"</p>

        <p>"That," said Mr. Clemens, "is true as far as it goes,
        but it does not go far enough. Publishers, as it happens,
        are constructed out of pretty much the same material as
        other people, and they are not likely to pay a royalty on a
        book by an unknown American author when they can get works
        by established authors for nothing. I may as well speak out
        on this question -- a month ago I wouldn't have done it --
        but now -- yes, I will speak out. This, then, understand,
        is not simply a question of protecting American authors.
        What becomes of them, whether they live or die, is of no
        consequence. It is not merely a question of copyright. It
        is a question of maintaining in America a national
        literature, of preserving national sentiment, national
        politics, national thought, and national morals.</p>

        <p>"What becomes of a dozen chuckleheaded authors, who can
        go and saw wood if they like, is the merest trifle compared
        with the great, colossal, national stakes involved. We are
        fed on a foreign literature, and imbibe foreign ideas. But
        if I were to go to England and write down what I think of
        their monarchical shams, pour out my utter contempt for
        their pitiful Lords and Dukes, and preach my sermon, I
        would not be able to get my views published. No English
        publisher would do it. But if a foreigner comes along here,
        and after looking around for a few minutes goes home and
        writes a book, abusing our President and reviling our
        institutions, his views are published and his book is
        gobbled up by American publishers, and circulated through
        out the country for 20 cents a copy.</p>

        <p>"Foreigners after that tell us that we are thin-skinned.
        'You Americans are very thin-skinned,' they say. Our skin
        is not so very thin, but it would be tough if it were not
        lacerated by such things as these. And then, our newspapers
        are abused. We are told that they are irreverent, coarse,
        vulgar, ribald. I hope they will remain irreverent. I would
        like that irreverence to be preserved in America forever
        and ever -- irreverence for all royalties and all those
        titled creatures born into privilege. Merit alone should
        constitute the one title to eminence, and we Americans can
        afford to look down and spit upon miserable titled
        nonentities.</p>

        <p>"But I am sorry that some of our newspapers are losing
        their irreverence. They publish too much about that puppet
        of an Emperor in Germany. And this dissemination of foreign
        literature is affecting our women. There are women in
        America -- and perfectly respectable women -- who are ready
        to sell themselves to anything bearing the name of
        Duke."</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens was carried away by indignation when
        delivering this broadside. He ceased toying with his watch
        chain, and fired off his sentences to the accompaniment of
        emphatic gestures. His conversation in its normal condition
        is quiet, slow, and deliberate. Sometimes he lingers over
        one word, and then accelerates the speed of the next few
        words so as to make up for the delay. He has a habit, when
        talking with you, of peering fixedly at some imaginary
        object in space, as if he had struck some luminous idea and
        was determined to hold on to it. Now and then his keen,
        bright eyes sparkle as he lets off some brilliant sally or
        unexpected coruscation. Having delivered himself on the
        contamination of American ideas by the spread of foreign
        literature, <a name="a" id="a">Mr. Clemens</a> turned to
        his new book, which satirizes the shams, laws, and customs
        of today under the pretense of dealing with the England of
        the sixth century.</p>

        <p>"I want," he said, "to get at the Englishman, but in
        order to do that I must deal with the English publisher.
        And the English publishers are cowards, and so are the
        English newspapers. I have had to modify and modify my book
        to suit the English publishers' taste until I really cannot
        cut it any more. I talked to Mr. Osgood about it, and he
        said that there was only one publisher in London that would
        take my book as I wanted to leave it, and that house was
        not quite reputable. I've got to have a respectable house.
        And Mr. Osgood said that my London publisher, Mr. Chatto,
        was one of the bravest of them. Yes; Mr. Chatto will do the
        best he can, but he will cut my book. All I could do was to
        appeal to him to cut it as little as possible. I am anxious
        to know my fate. I see that he has cut my preface. Yes,
        more than half of my preface is gone, and all because of a
        little playful remark of mine about the divine right of
        Kings."</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens was very much cut up over the massacre of
        his preface. This is the part which was considered too
        shocking for Englishmen:</p>

        <p>"The question as to whether there is such a thing as
        divine right of Kings is not settled in this book. It was
        found too difficult. That the executive head of a nation
        should be a person of lofty character and extraordinary
        ability was manifest and indisputable; that none but the
        deity could select that head unerringly was also manifest
        and indisputable; that the deity ought to make that
        selection, then was likewise manifest and indisputable;
        consequently, that He does make it, as claimed, was an
        unavoidable deduction. I mean, until the author of this
        book encountered the Pompadour and Lady Castlemain and some
        other executive heads of that kind, these were found so
        difficult to work into the scheme that it was judged better
        to take the other tack in this book, (which must be issued
        this Fall,) and then go into training and settle the
        question in another book. It is, of course, a question
        which ought to be settled, and I am not going to have
        anything particular to do next Winter, anyway."</p>

        <p><a name="b" id="b">Mr. Clemens</a> is delighted at the
        way the artist has entered into the spirit of the book in
        executing the illustrations, and pointed specially to a
        fine portrait of Jay Gould in the capacity of "the slave
        driver," but he fears that some of the illustrations in the
        English edition will be sacrificed on the altar of English
        hypocrisy.</p>

        <p>"How long were you at work on this book, Mr.
        Clemens?"</p>

        <p>"I projected it four years ago," he replied, "and it has
        been in manuscript for three years. I put it in pigeonholes
        and took it out now and then to see how it was getting on,
        and replaced it again. I began to think several months ago
        that it was about ripe, and that the times were about ripe
        for it. And sure enough it was, for there is Brazil gets
        rid of her Emperor in twenty-four hours, and there is talk
        of a republic in Portugal and in Australia. And curiously
        enough, the proclamation of the Brazilian republicans is
        very similar -- I mean in the idea, not the words -- to
        that which my hero issues abolishing the monarchy."</p>

        <p>The sales of Mr. Clemens's books are about the same on
        both sides of the Atlantic. When a book is first published
        only a third of the income comes from England and
        two-thirds from the American edition. But when the work
        falls into the category of old books, then this order is
        reversed -- probably owing to the fact that cheap editions
        are published in England. Mr. Clemens cannot say which of
        his books has had the largest sale, though he inclined to
        give the palm to "The Innocents Abroad." That and his other
        earlier works are pirated in England. A London publisher
        named Hotten once issued a set of Mark Twain's earlier
        works, accompanied with a glossary to explain the words or
        the jokes or something. Mark Twain's reflection on this
        proceeding at the time was: "I should like very much to
        blow Mr. Hotten's brains out -- not that I have any
        objection to Mr. Hotten, but just to see."</p>

        <p>"Are you pestered with autograph fiends?"</p>

        <p>"Yes," he said, "I get my share of them. I write out a
        few hundred cards now and then and give them to my
        secretary to mail. When I sent them myself I used to
        discriminate. I would not send my autograph unless the
        applicants sent addressed envelopes. No matter whether they
        sent a thousand cards or a hundred thousand stamps, if they
        didn't write the address I gobbled their stamps and kept my
        autograph."</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens took his visitor up stairs to what appeared
        to be his sanctum and a billiard room combined. He had been
        standing at the billiard table writing. He writes a young
        man's hand, and better and clearer than most young men. His
        copy is not likely to make compositors break the third
        commandment unless they are carried away by ecstasies over
        it. He not only writes clearly and carefully, but his
        punctuation is elaborate to a fault. He walked up and down
        the room smoking a wooden pipe, which had a chronic
        tendency to fall in two and required refilling often. There
        was a writing desk in the room with a case full of books
        beside it.</p>

        <p>"Do your write at that desk, Mr. Clemens?"</p>

        <p>"No, I write there." "There" was a small semi-circular
        table pushed up close to the wall, strewn with papers, and
        affording very little elbow room for writing.</p>

        <p>"And when may we expect another book?"</p>

        <p>"I don't know," replied Mr. Clemens. "I don't write the
        book. A book writes itself. If there is another book in me,
        it will come out, and I will put it on paper."</p>

        <p>Thus the humorist's works pass through two stages of
        evolution. First there is a process of mental incubation.
        Then the work is transferred to paper and remains in a sort
        of chrysalis condition in pigeonholes until it is ripe for
        publication.</p>
