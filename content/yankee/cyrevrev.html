          <p>In selecting as the Novel of the Month Mark Twain's
          new story, <i>A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur</i>, I
          am aware that I expose myself to many remonstrances.
          There is a certain profanation in the subject, and withal
          a certain dulness in its treatment. It is not a novel; it
          is a ponderous political pamphlet, and so forth and so
          forth. Nevertheless, to those who endeavour to understand
          what the mass of men who speak English are thinking, as
          opposed to those who merely care about what they think
          they ought to be thinking, this book of Mark Twain's is
          one of the most significant of our time. It is notable
          for its faults quite as much as for its virtues, and for
          the irreverent audacity of its original conception as
          much as for the cumbrous and strenuous moralising which
          makes it at times more like one of Jonathan Edwards'
          sermons than a mere buoyant and farcical bubbling up of
          American humour.</p>

          <p>Mark Twain is one of the few American authors whose
          writings are popular throughout the English-speaking
          world. Our superfine literary men of culture who
          pooh-pooh the rough rude vigour of the American humorist
          represent a small clique. Mark Twain gets "directlier at
          the heart" of the masses than any of the blue-china set
          of nimminy-pimminy criticasters. In his own country, if
          we may judge from the remarks in the January
          <i>Harper</i>, <i>A Yankee at the Court of King
          Arthur</i> has been received with an enthusiasm which it
          has hitherto failed to evoke on this side of the
          Atlantic. We read there that</p>

          <blockquote>the delicious satire, the marvellous wit, the wild,
          free, fantastic humour, are the colours of the tapestry,
          while the texture is a humanity that lives in every
          fibre. We can give no proper notion of the measureless
          play of an imagination which has a gigantic jollity in
          its feats, together with the tenderest sympathy. The
          humour of the conception and of the performance is simply
          immense; but more than ever Mr. Clemens's humour seems
          the sunny break of his intense conviction.</blockquote>

          <p>What a contrast this to the frigid condemnation of the
          <i>Speaker</i>: "In his last book Mr. Clemens fails to
          make us laugh by any method, even the worst. He is not
          only dull when he is offensive, but perhaps even more
          dull when he is didactic." Yet I make free to say that
          the vote of the mass of English people would be on the
          side of the American and against the English critic. For
          what our critical class has failed to appreciate is that
          the Education Act has turned out and is turning out
          millions of readers who are much more like the Americans
          in their tastes, their ideas, and their sympathies than
          they are to the English of the cultured, pampered, and
          privileged classes. The average English speaking man is
          the product of the common school in America, of the
          public elementary school in Britain and Australia. His
          literary taste is not classical but popular. He prefers
          Longfellow to Browning, and as a humorist he enjoys Mark
          Twain more than all the dainty wits whose delicately
          flavoured quips and cranks delight the boudoir and the
          drawing-room. This may be most deplorable from the point
          of view of the supercilious &aelig;sthetes, but the fact
          in all its brutality cannot be too frankly
          recognised.</p>

          <p>Another circumstance which gives significance to the
          book is the fact that it is the latest among the volumes
          whereby Americans are revolutionising the old country.
          The two books which have given the greatest impetus to
          the social-democratic movement in recent years have both
          come to us from America. Henry George's land
          nationalisation theories were scouted by the superfine,
          but they have gained a firm hold of the public mind. His
          book has circulated everywhere, and is still circulating.
          Of another kind, but operating in the same direction, is
          Edward Bellamy's <i>Looking Backwards</i>, which has
          supplied our people with a clearly written-out apocalypse
          of the new heaven and the new earth that are to come
          after the acceptance of the Evangel of Socialism. Mark
          Twain's book is a third contribution in the same
          direction. His Yankee is a fierce and furious
          propagandist of anti-monarchical and aristocratic ideas.
          Under the veil of sarcasms levelled at King Arthur we see
          a genial mockery of the British monarchy of to-day, with
          its Royal grants and all its semi-feudal paraphernalia.
          Nor is it only at British abuses Mark Twain levels his
          burly jests. He thwacks the protectionist American as
          readily as the aristocratic Briton. There is something
          infinitely significant in the very form of his satire. If
          there is nothing sacred to a sapper, neither can there be
          anything sacred to a descendant of the men of the
          <i>Mayflower</i>, who has all the fervour of Mr.
          Zeal-for-the-Lord-Busy and the confident, complacent
          assurance of Sam Slick, who dismissed unceremoniously the
          authority of Plato or Aristotle with the observation that
          we need not heed what they said as there were no railways
          in their times. Here is the New England Democrat and
          Puritan as passionately sympathetic with the common man
          as the nobles and knights whom he scourges were
          sympathetic with men of their order, determined to avenge
          the injustice of centuries and by holding the mirror up
          to fact to punish the chivalric age by showing how it
          treated the common man. It is not longer enough to judge
          systems of to-day by the effect which they have upon
          Hodge the ploughman and Bottom the weaver; the war must
          be carried into the enemy's camp, the verdict of history
          must be reversed, and all our ideals of the past
          transformed in the light of this new and imperious
          interrogation -- The labouring man, what did that age or
          that institution make of him?</p>

          <p>Tennyson sang the idyls of the King, and as long as
          the world lasts Sir Thomas Malory's marvellous old
          Romance will fill the hearts and imaginations of men with
          some far-off reflection of the splendours and the glories
          of that child-like age. But truly he sang "the old order
          changeth, giving place to the new," of which can we have
          a more notable and even brutal illustration than the
          apparition of this vulgar Yankee realist, with his
          telephones and his dynamite, his insufferable slang and
          his infinite self-conceit, in the midst of King Arthur's
          Court applying to all the knighthood of the Round Table
          the measure of his yard-stick, -- the welfare of the
          common man? It is the supreme assertion of the law of
          numbers, of the application of the patent arithmetical
          proposition that ten is more than one, to the problems of
          politics and of history. Tennyson himself, in the "Last
          Tournament," supplied a vivid picture, which may well
          serve as a frontispiece of Mark Twain's vision:</p>

          <blockquote>Into the hall swaggered, his visage ribbed<br />
          From ear to ear with dog whip-weals, his nose<br />
          Bridge-broken, one eye out and one hand off,<br />
          And one with shattered fingers dangling, lame;<br />
          A churl, to whom indignantly the king,<br />
          "My churl, for whom Christ died; what evil beast<br />
          Hath drawn his claws athwart thy face? or fiend,<br />
          Man, was it who marr'd heaven's image in thee thus?"</blockquote>

          <p>The churl for whom Christ died is the centre of Mark
          Twain's story, which is a long and a passionate attempt
          to suggest that the evil beast who marred the visage of
          the poor wretch was the three-headed chimera of Monarchy,
          Aristocracy, and Church. There is much strange misreading
          of history caused by the extent to which Mark Twain has
          allowed the abuses of institutions to obscure their
          use.</p>
