  <br />  Here we have the proclamation which forms the fasis of the
  American government. "All men are born free and equal." Its
  astonishing effect is exhibited in the figures. The king is
  losing his crown and his ermine robe; chains are falling from the
  slave; and the devil, representing wickedness and bigotry, is
  getting out of the way as fast as possible.<br />

  This picture illustrates a story told of Abraham Lincoln. An
  English nobleman said to him, in criticising America, that we
  have no gentlemen here. "Whom do you call gentlemen?" asked
  Lincoln. "Men who have plenty of leisure, who are not obliged to
  do anything for a living," was the answer. "Oh yes," replied Mr.
  Lincoln, we have plenty of them, but in this country we call them
  tramps." In this picture we have two gentlemen of leisure sitting
  in either side of the scales, and you will notice that the scales
  balance; the stout figure, representing aristocracy, doing
  nothing and living well off the people. On the other side is a
  tramp, who also does nothing and lives off the people.</td></tr></table>  <br />
