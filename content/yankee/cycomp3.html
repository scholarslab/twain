          [<i>This is obviously in reply to a letter from Mary
          Fairbanks (whom MT had been calling "Mother" since 1867).
          She always tried to keep MT's irreverence inside genteel
          bounds, objecting to his attitude toward the "Old
          Masters" in</i> Innocents Abroad<i>, and obviously
          anxious about his intentions toward "old England" in the
          book he was writing now. How sincerely "Saml" meant this
          reply is a question for which critics have never been
          able to agree on an answer.</i>]

        </center>Dear Mother Fairbanks:

        <p>The story isn't a satire peculiarly, it is more
        especially a <i>contrast</i>. It merely exhibits under high
        lights the daily life of the times &amp; that of to-day;
        &amp; necessarily the bringing them into this immediate
        juxtaposition emphasizes the salients of both. Only two or
        three chapters of the book have been written, thus far. I
        expect to write three chapters a year for thirty years;
        then the book will be done. I am writing it for posterity
        only; my posterity: my great grandchildren. It is to be my
        holiday amusement for six days every summer the rest of my
        life. Of course I do not expect to publish it; nor indeed
        any other book -- though I fully expect to write one other
        book besides this one; two others, in fact, if one's
        autobiography may be called a book -- in fact mine will be
        nearer a library.</p>

        <p>Of course in my story I shall leave unsmirched &amp;
        unbelittled the great &amp; beautiful <i>characters</i>
        drawn by the master hand of old Malory (if he drew them --
        at any rate he gave them to <i>us</i>) -- I am only after
        the <i>life</i> of that day, that is all: to picture it; to
        try to get into it; to see how it feels &amp; seems. I
        shall hope that under my hand Sir Galahad will still remain
        the divinest spectre that one glimpses among the mists
        &amp; twilights of Dreamland across the wastes of the
        centuries; &amp; Arthur keep his sweetness &amp; his
        purity, and Launcelot abide &amp; continue "the kindest man
        that ever strake the sword," yet "the sternest knight to
        his mortal foe that ever put spear in the rest;" &amp; I
        should grieve indeed if the final disruption of the Round
        Table, &amp; the extinction of its old tender &amp;
        gracious friendships, &amp; that last battle -- the Battle
        of the Broken Hearts, it might be called -- should lose
        their pathos &amp; their tears through my handling. . .
        .</p>

        <p>. . . Good-bye, &amp; love from us all. &#x00A0; &#x00A0;
        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0;
        &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Saml.</p>
