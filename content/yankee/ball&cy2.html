        The women were merely tied together with a rope, about the
        size of a bed-cord, which was tied like a halter round the
        neck of each; but the men, of whom I was the stoutest and
        strongest, were very differently caparisoned. A strong iron
        collar was closely fitted by means of a padlock round each
        of our necks. A chain of iron, about a hundred feet in
        length, was passed through the hasp of each padlock, except
        at the two ends, where the hasps of the padlock passed
        through a link of the chain. In addition to this, we were
        handcuffed in pairs, with iron staples and bolts, with a
        short chain, about a foot long, uniting the handcuffs and
        their wearers in pairs. In this manner we were chained
        alternately by the right and left hand; and the poor man to
        whom I was thus ironed, wept like an infant when the
        blacksmith, with his heavy hammer, fasted the ends of the
        bolts that kept the staples from slipping from our arms.
        For my own part, I felt indifferent to my fate. It appeared
        to me that the worst had come that could come, and that no
        change of fortune could harm me.</td>

        . . . there was not a face among all these half a hundred
        people but was cast down, and bore that set expression of
        hopelessness which is bred of long and hard trials and old
        acquaintance with despair. They were slaves. Chains led
        from their fettered feet and their manacled hands to a
        sole-leather belt about their waists; and all except the
        children were also linked together in a file six feet
        apart, by a single chain which led from collar to collar
        all down the line.</td>
