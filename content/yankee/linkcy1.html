  <p>As a rule, the speech and behavior of these people were
  gracious and courtly; and I noticed that they were good and
  serious listeners when anybody was telling anything -- I mean in
  a dog-fightless interval. And plainly, too, they were a childlike
  and innocent lot; telling lies of the stateliest pattern with a
  most gentle and winning naivety, and ready and willing to listen
  to anybody else's lie, and believe it, too. It was hard to
  associate them with anything cruel or dreadful; and yet they
  dealt in tales of blood and suffering with a guileless relish
  that made me almost forget to shudder.</p>

  <p>I was not the only prisoner present. There were twenty or
  more. Poor devils, many of them were maimed, hacked, carved, in a
  frightful way; and their hair, their faces, their clothing, were
  caked with black and stiffened drenchings of blood. They were
  suffering sharp physical pain, of course; and weariness, and
  hunger and thirst, no doubt; and at least none had given them the
  comfort of a wash, or even the poor charity of a lotion for their
  wounds; yet you never heard them utter a moan or a groan, or saw
  them show any sign of restlessness, or any disposition to
  complain. The thought was forced upon me: "The rascals --
  <i>they</i> have served other people so in their day; it being
  their own turn, now, they were not expecting any better treatment
  than this; so their philosophical bearing is not an outcome of
  mental training, intellectual fortitude, reasoning; it is mere
  animal training; they are white Indians."</p>
