          <p>Mark Twain's latest book, which his publishers have
          brought out in a handsome volume, seems to us the poorest
          of all his productions thus far. The conceit of taking a
          Yankee of this generation of telephones and the electric
          light back to King Arthur's Court may please some minds,
          if presented in a story of moderate length, but there can
          be few who will really enjoy it when long-drawn out to
          the extent of nearly six hundred pages. Whatever value
          Mr. Clemens might have incidentally imparted to his
          burlesque by giving something like a correct picture of
          the customs of the time in which the mythical King
          flourished is entirely absent. He has crowded into his
          picture a great number of episodes illustrating "ungentle
          laws and customs" which are historical, indeed; but he
          says:</p>

          <p><font size="-1">It is not pretended that these laws
          and customs existed in England in the sixth century; no,
          it is only pretended that, inasmuch as they existed in
          the English and other civilizations of far later times,
          it is safe to consider that it is no libel upon the sixth
          century to suppose them to have been in practice in that
          day also. One is quite justified in inferring that
          wherever one of these laws or customs was lacking in that
          remote time, its place was competently filled by a worse
          one.</font></p>

          <p>Mr. Clemens' method of writing history would justify
          him in picturing the Connecticut of the seventeenth
          century as afflicted with loose divorce customs and great
          corruption at the polls -- or something worse -- simply
          because these are vices of the nineteenth century! To
          crowd into a representation of one age the social evils
          of all its successors known to us, and to omit those
          special redeeming features of the time which made life
          tolerable, is a very irrational proceeding.</p>

          <p>The serious aim under Mark Twain's travesty is the
          glorification of American Protestant democracy. The
          effort fails through the extreme partiality of the
          procedure. Even a Mark Twain, the persistent teacher of
          irreverence for great men and great events, should have
          some little respect left for fair play. Mr. Clemens'
          previous books have been bad enough in their strong
          encouragement of one of the worst tendencies in a
          democratic State, the inclination to sheer flippancy and
          unmanly irreverence in the face of the natural sanctities
          of private life and the grand heroisms of human history.
          But this volume goes much further in its endeavor to
          belittle a century surrounded with romantic light by men
          of later times, who thus fell back upon poetry as a
          slight relief to the hard prose of their actual lot. A
          buffoon, like the hero of this tale, playing his
          contemptible tricks where Sir Thomas Malory has trod with
          a noble teaching of knightly courtesy, and uttering his
          witless jokes where Tennyson has drawn so many a high
          moral of true gentleness, is a sorry spectacle. It is not
          calculated to make a reflecting person proud of a shallow
          and self-complacent generation which can enjoy such
          so-called humor.</p>

          <p>The one consolation to be derived from this melancholy
          product of the American mind in the ninth decade of the
          nineteenth century is that, equally in its serious and in
          its jesting parts, it must bring about a healthy reaction
          in some of its admiring readers because it overshoots the
          mark; because its history is perverse, in its one-sided
          accumulation of evils; and because its humor will be
          wearisome in the extreme when its falsity is seen.</p>

          <p>When <a name="a" id="a">Mr. Clemens</a> relates his
          Life on the Mississippi with characteristic American
          exaggeration, we cannot fail to laugh and become friends.
          But when he prostitutes his humorous gift to the base
          uses of historical injustice, democratic bigotry,
          Protestant intolerance, and nineteenth-century vainglory,
          we must express the very sincere animosity we feel at
          such a performance. If anything could be less of a credit
          to our literature than the matter of this book, it
          certainly is the illustrations which disfigure it. A
          Protestant of the Protestants himself, the writer of this
          review cannot refrain from thus freeing his soul in the
          cause of literary decency when the Roman Catholic Church,
          that is to say the Christian Church in one of the noblest
          periods of its history, is thus grossly assailed by the
          writer and the illustrator of this tiresome travesty.</p>
