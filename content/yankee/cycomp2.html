        <p>The regular monthly meeting of the Military Service
        Institution was held last evening in the museum building on
        Governor's Island, at which Mr. Samuel L. Clemens (Mark
        Twain) read a learned essay on "The War Experiences of a
        Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur's Court." The acting
        Vice-President, Gen. James B. Fry, presided, and there was
        a very large attendance. Among those present were Gen. W.
        T. Sherman and his brother, Gen. J. M. Schofield, Gen. T.
        F. Rodenbough, Gen. W. W. Burns, Gen. Wm. D. Whipple, Gen.
        James Grant Wilson, Gen. J. J. Neilhan, Gen. D. McClure,
        Gen. H. C. King, Gen. 0. L. Shepherd, Col. John Hamilton,
        Col. John H. Janewary, Col. A. A. Woodhull, Capt. Charles
        Morris, Capt. J. A. Fessenden, Major W. F. Randolph, Capt.
        V. Hasafd, Lieut. H. C. Carbaugh, Lieut. J. Reilly, Lieut.
        John Pitcher, Lieut. A. W. Vodges, Lieut. Frank Thorp and
        many ladies and gentlemen from this city.</p>

        <p>When Mr. Clemens came forward to the reading-desk there
        was scant standing room in any part of the hall. He was
        received with much applause and at once announced the
        purpose of his lecture or talk as follows:</p>

        <p>"L<font size="-1">ADIES AND</font> G<font size=
        "-1">ENTLEMEN</font>: This fragment which by your courtesy
        I am to read here to-night is a story--a satire if you
        please--which I began to write some time ago and which is
        not finished; so what I propose to do under the
        circumstances is to read the first chapter just as it is
        and then in brief synopsis or outline tell the rest of it
        in bulk, do as the dying cowboy advised his spiritual
        adviser to do, 'Just leave out the details and heave in the
        bottom facts.' It would be impossible to tell much of the
        story in so short a time as we have and I will begin it
        just as it is written."</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens then went on to say, reading from the first
        chapter of his forthcoming book, that in exploring Warwick
        Castle in England he met a stranger who interested him
        greatly. They became very good friends and one day the
        stranger said, "You know about the transmigration of souls;
        do you know about the transposition of epochs and bodies?"
        Mr. Clemens had not heard of it, and subsequently this
        stranger sent him a manuscript. Beginning the reading of
        the supposed manuscript, the lecturer read:</p>

        <p>"'I am an American.' Well, he did not look it. 'I was
        born in Hartford, in the State of Connecticut. I am a
        Yankee of the Yankees. My father was a blacksmith, my uncle
        was a horse trader and I was both.' This Yankee was struck
        in the head one day, and when he awoke he was sitting under
        an oak tree." The narration goes on to say that there was a
        man clad in ancient armor from head to foot, and that this
        apparition said to him, "Will you joust?" "'I said,'" the
        narrative goes on, "'what are you giving me! Git along back
        to your circus or I'll report you,' but he went back a
        piece and then he came tilting at me and I saw he meant
        business and when he arrived where I was I was up in the
        tree." (Great laughter.) Mr. Clemens continued the reading,
        which described how an arrangement was made by which the
        Yankee was induced to accompany the Knight, believing him
        first to be from some circus and later on an escaped
        lunatic.</p>

        <p>Describing a woman encountered on the way, the narrative
        said: "Around her head was a wreath of red poppies, but as
        regards the rest of her clothing--well, there was not
        enough of it to talk about. (Great laughter.) She walked
        along by the circus man and did not pay the slightest
        attention to him-did not even seem to see him; but when her
        eye fell on me she seemed to be turned into an image of
        stone, and there she stood gazing with a sort of stupefied
        attention till we turned a corner and were lost to view.
        That she should be startled at me instead of the other man
        was too many for me. That she should seem to consider me a
        spectacle, totally overlooking her own merits in that
        respect, I thought curious." (Laughter.)</p>

        <p>Continuing, the manuscript stated that every one seemed
        to notice the narrator with great interest, while none paid
        the slightest attention to his conductor. The streets
        through which they passed were muddy and ill-kept, hogs
        rooted contentedly about and dogs were numerous. Finally a
        blare of music announced the approach of a gay cavalcade of
        Knights in armor, and this was followed by an ascent into a
        castle. With the asylum idea still uppermost the narrator
        asked an inmate if he belonged to the asylum, or if he was
        there only as a visitor. "And he said," continued the
        narrator, "'Marry, marry,' and I said, 'That'll do, I guess
        you're an inmate.' One gorgeously attired youth came to me
        and said, 'I am a page.' 'Oh, go along,' said I; 'you ain't
        big enough for a paragraph.' (Laughter.) Finally he
        mentioned in a casual way that he was born in the beginning
        of 513. Said I, 'Won't you say it again and say it slow?
        What did you say?' '513.' Said I: 'You don't look it.' And
        said I 'Are you in your right mind?' 'Yes,' said he. 'And
        are all these people in their right minds?' 'Yes,' said he,
        and said I, 'Where am I' and said he, 'You are in King
        Arthur's Court,' and said I, 'What year is it now?' and
        said he, '526, the 13th of June,' and said I, I shall never
        see my friends any more, for they won't be born for more
        than a thousand years,' and I seemed to believe the boy,
        although my reason didn't."</p>

        <p>The above extract will show the nature of Mr. Clemens's
        entertainment. Continuing, he said the page assured him,
        after the dinner of the Knights of the Round Table was
        over, he would be called in and exhibited by the one who
        had brought him there, who was the Seneschal of the Castle
        and the King's foster-brother. Finally he was taken in, and
        then, in the most humorous style, he recounted the
        marvellous stories which each Knight at the table narrated
        and the deeds of valor which he had performed. Finally, the
        Yankee becomes one of the Knights and is clothed in armor
        and sent to destroy a castle and kill an ogre which guards
        it and to set at liberty some sixty beautiful princesses.
        The description of how a man of the present time would be
        supposed to feel in a suit of armor was one of the most
        humorous things in Mr. Clemens's paper. One portion of it
        was as follows: "God has so made us that there comes a time
        when we must scratch, and the more we want to scratch the
        more we would give $10,000 if we could scratch, and if that
        deprivation goes on there comes a time when we would give a
        million. First I wanted to scratch my head, then my arms,
        then my legs," &amp;c. He went on to describe how he had
        perspired inside the armor, and how on ascending the
        mountain he froze stiff inside of it, and was finally in a
        frozen state rubbed off the horse by the animal passing
        under a tree, and, the armor breaking, he was liberated. He
        then concluded that instead of seeking further for the
        castle and the one-eyed giant, he would go back and lie
        about it, and that this succeeded very well and he came to
        be recognized as a prime warrior among the Knights of the
        Round Table. Finally he returns to this country and finds
        that the Knights had turned themselves into a stock board,
        and seats at the Round Table are worth $30,000 apiece.</p>

        <p>At the close of Mr. Clemens's paper, of which this is
        but the faintest outline, on motion of Gen. Sherman a vote
        of thanks was given him.</p>
