        <h2>A Single-Taxer at King Arthur's Court</h2>Beard is "not
        only an excellent artist but an intelligent single-tax man
        as well." So wrote the critic who reviewed the novel in the
        New York <i>Standard</i>, the official paper of Henry
        George's single-tax political party. That review begins by
        asking, "Who could have suspected Mark Twain of being a
        political and social reformer?" As an exposer of romantic
        idealizations and a burlesquer of European literary forms
        MT had been engaged with the kind of "reform" on display in
        <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> throughout his career, but as
        Henry Nash Smith has said, this reviewer "might be said to
        be reviewing Beard's book rather than Mark Twain's."
        Consistently Beard made the novel's more general critique
        of the Old World look doctrinally consistent with the
        Single Tax critique of social and economic injustice in
        late 19th-century America. The first illustration below,
        for example, uses the burdens of "rent" and "taxes" (two of
        the key terms in George's vocabulary) to represent what the
        text calls "burdens that have not honor." The next
        illustration includes "absorber of unearned increment" and
        "landgrabber" (again, George's words, not MT's) among the
        vices of an aristocratic class. In Chapter 33 Beard uses
        five drawings to illustrate the Yankee's (and MT's)
        indictment of protectionist tariffs. In publicity for the
        novel MT clearly wanted to avoid calling too much attention
        to such a strictly political and economic theme, but
        Beard's work makes it prominent, indeed, more prominent
        than the narrative. (The word on the overfed stork's bill
        is "<font size="-1">CAPITAL</font>," and the word on the
        starving dog's hat is "<font size="-1">LABOR</font>."
