<p>[<i>Lecky's</i> History of European Morals <i>was
        one of MT's favorite books. According to Albert Bigelow
        Paine, he first read it in 1873. It was a minor source
        for</i> Huck Finn<i>, and a major source for</i> The Prince
        and the Pauper<i>. Along with Lecky's</i> History of
        England in the Eighteenth Century<i>, it was an important
        influence on</i> Connecticut Yankee<i>. As Harold Aspiz
        pointed out, MT made use of both Lecky's facts and Lecky's
        ideas. The first excerpt below reflects the way MT depended
        on Lecky for historical facts. It is the passage MT is
        referring to in the note at the end of <font size=
        "-1">CHAPTER XXII</font> when he says: "All the details
        concerning the hermits, in this chapter, are from Lecky,
        but greatly modified." (One modification, of course, was
        the way MT moved Lecky's ascetics from the deserts of Egypt
        to Arthurian England. By clicking on the link icon, you can
        put Lecky's and MT's prose side-by-side, and see how else
        he modified the source.) One specific fact in this
        selection -- about the drying up of a well -- also supplied
        MT with the idea for Hank's "miracle" at the Valley of
        Holiness.</i></p>
<p>
        [<i>In addition, MT was deeply attracted to Lecky's ideas
        about the past, progress and the human race. The second
        excerpt below begins with a brief passage in which Lecky
        defines what he means by a "natural history" of morals,
        then gives a longer example of the way Lecky's study
        depicts the development of society across the centuries.
        Calling the seventh century in which</i> Connecticut Yankee
        <i>is set "the darkest period of the dark ages," Lecky
        repeatedly condemns the "superstitious torpor" and "blind
        credulity" of medieval religion. MT agreed enthusiastically
        with Lecky's attack. For example, when Lecky contrasted the
        Roman ideals of "self reliance" and "independence" with the
        "cardinal or rudimentary virtues in the Christian
        character" -- "humility, obedience, gentleness, patience,
        resignation" -- MT wrote in the margin of his copy of</i>
        European Morals<i>, "Christianity then did not raise up the
        slave, but degraded all conditions of men to the slave's
        level." He then has his Connecticut Yankee say that "an
        Established Church is an established slave pen."</i></p>
<p>
        [<i>For Lecky, the great agent of change is capitalism --
        or, as he calls it, the "industrial spirit." Much of his
        book (like</i> Connecticut Yankee<i>) defines the
        differences between a benighted past and an enlightened
        present, though there is room for ambivalence in his
        account. The passage excerpted here, for example, discusses
        what is gained and lost when the medieval habit of
        reverence is replaced by modern, scientific, democratic
        skepticism and self-reliance. Although Hank Morgan of
        course remains a devout believer in the values he brings
        with him from modern America, by the end of his "Tale of
        the Lost Land" some readers find themselves, like Lecky,
        thinking about losses as well as gains.</i>]</p>

      <td>There is, perhaps, no phase in the moral history of
      mankind, of a deeper or more painful interest than this
      ascetic epidemic. A hideous, sordid, and emaciated maniac,
      without knowledge, without patriotism, without natural
      affection, passing his life in a long routine of useless and
      atrocious self-torture, and quailing before the ghastly
      phantoms of his delirious brain, had become the ideal of the
      nations which had known the writings of Plato and Cicero and
      the lives of Socrates or Cato. For about two centuries, the
      hideous maceration of the body was regarded as the highest
      proof of excellence. St. Jerome declares, with a thrill of
      admiration, how he had seen a monk, who for thirty years had
      lived exclusively on a small portion of barley bread and of
      muddy water; another, who lived in a hole and never eat more
      than five figs for his daily repast; a third, who cut his
      hair only on Easter Sunday, who never washed his clothes, who
      never changed his tunic till it fell to pieces, who starved
      himself till his eyes grew dim, and his skin "like a pumice
      stone,"and whose merits, shown by these austerities, Homer
      himself would be unable to recount. For six months, it is
      said, St. Macarius of Alexandria slept in a marsh, and
      exposed his body naked to the stings of venomous flies. He
      was accustomed to carry about with him eighty pounds of iron.
      His disciple, St. Eusebius, carried one hundred and fifty
      pounds of iron, and lived for three years in a dried-up well.
      St. Sabinus would only eat corn that had become rotten by
      remaining for a month in water. St. Besarion spent forty days
      and nights in the middle of thorn-bushes, and for forty years
      never lay down when he slept, which last penance was also
      during fifteen years practised by St. Pachomius. Some saints,
      like St. Marcian, restricted themselves to one meal a day, so
      small that they continually suffered the pangs of hunger. Of
      one of them it is related that his daily food was six ounces
      of bread and a few herbs; that he was never seen to recline
      on a mat or bed, or even, to place his limbs easily for
      sleep; but that sometimes, from excess of weariness, his eyes
      would close at his meals, and the food would drop into his
      mouth. Other saints, however, eat only every second day;
      while many, if we could believe the monkish historian,
      abstained for whole weeks from all nourishment. St. Macarius
      of Alexandria is said during an entire week to have never
      lain down, or eaten anything but a few uncooked herbs on
      Sunday. Of another famous saint, named John, it is asserted
      that for three whole years he stood in prayer, leaning upon a
      rock; that during all that time he never sat or lay down, and
      that his only nourishment was the Sacrament, which was
      brought him on Sundays. Some of the hermits lived in deserted
      dens of wild beasts, others in dried-up wells, while others
      found a congenial resting-place among the tombs. Some
      disdained all clothes, and crawled abroad like the wild
      beasts, covered only by their matted hair. In Mesopotamia,
      and part of Syria, there existed a sect known by the name of
      "Grazers," who never lived under a roof, who eat neither
      flesh nor bread, but who spent their time for ever on the
      mountain side, and eat grass like cattle. The cleanliness of
      the body was regarded as a pollution of the soul, and the
      saints who were most admired had become one hideous mass of
      clotted filth. St. Athanasius relates with enthusiasm how St.
      Antony, the patriarch of monachism, had never, in extreme old
      age, been guilty of washing his feet. The less constant St.
      Poemen fell into this habit for the first time when a very
      old man, and, with a glimmering of common sense, defended
      himself against the astonished monks by saying that he had
      "learnt to kill not his body, but his passions." St. Abraham
      the hermit, however, who lived for fifty years after his
      conversion, rigidly refused from that date to wash either his
      face or his feet. He was, it is said, a person of singular
      beauty, and his biographer somewhat strangely remarks, that
      "his face reflected the purity of his soul." St. Ammon had
      never seen himself naked. A famous virgin named Silvia,
      though she was sixty years old, and though bodily sickness
      was a consequence of her habits, resolutely refused, on
      religious principles, to wash any part of her body except her
      fingers. St. Euphraxia joined a convent of one hundred and
      thirty nuns, who never washed their feet, and who shuddered
      at the mention of a bath. An anchorite once imagined that he
      was mocked by an illusion of the devil, as he saw gliding
      before him through the desert a naked creature black with
      filth and years of exposure, and with white hair floating to
      the wind. It was a once beautiful woman, St. Mary of Egypt,
      who had thus, during forty-seven years, been expiating her
      sins. The occasional decadence of the monks into habits of
      decency was a subject of much reproach. "Our fathers," said
      the abbot Alexander, looking mournfully back to the past,
      "never washed their faces, but we frequent the public baths."
      It was related of one monastery in the desert, that the monks
      suffered greatly from want of water to drink; but at the
      prayer of the abbot Theodosius, a copious stream was
      produced. But soon some monks, tempted by the abundant
      supply, diverged from their old austerity, and persuaded the
      abbot to avail himself of the stream for the construction of
      the bath. The bath was made. Once, and once only, did the
      monks enjoy their ablutions, when the stream ceased to flow.
      Prayers, tears, and fastings were in vain. A whole year
      passed. At last the abbot destroyed the bath, which was the
      object of the Divine displeasure, and the waters flowed
      afresh. But of all the evidences of the loathsome excesses to
      which this spirit was carried, the life of St. Simeon
      Stylites is probably the most remarkable. It would be
      difficult to conceive a more horrible or disgusting picture
      than is given of the penances by which that saint commenced
      his ascetic career. He had bound a rope around him so that it
      became imbedded in his flesh, which putrefied around it. "A
      horrible stench, intolerable to the bystanders, exhaled from
      his body, and worms dropped from him whenever he moved, and
      they filled his bed." Sometimes he left the monastery and
      slept in a dry well, inhabited, it is said, by daemons.He
      built successively three pillars, the last being sixty feet
      high, and scarcely two cubits in circumference, and on this
      pillar, during thirty years, he remained exposed to every
      change of climate, ceaselessly and rapidly bending his body
      in prayer almost to the level of his feet. A spectator
      attempted to number these rapid motions, but desisted from
      weariness when he had counted 1,244. For a whole year, we are
      told, St. Simeon stood upon one leg, the other being covered
      with hideous ulcers, while his biographer was commissioned to
      stand by his side, to pick up the worms that fell from his
      body, and to replace them in the sores, the saint saying to
      the worm, "Eat what God has given you." From every quarter
      pilgrims of every degree thronged to do him homage. A crowd
      of prelates followed him to the grave. A brilliant star is
      said to have shone miraculously over his pillar; the general
      voice of mankind pronounced him to be the highest model of a
      Christian saint, and several other anchorites imitated or
      emulated his penances.<br /></td>

          <b>from Volume I, Chapter 1<br />
          The Natural History of Morals</b>
        </center><br />
        The proposition for which I am contending is simply that
        there is such a thing as a natural history of morals, a
        defined and regular order, in which our moral feelings are
        unfolded; or, in other words, that there are certain groups
        of virtues which spring spontaneously out of the
        circumstances and mental conditions of an uncivilised
        people, and that there are others which are the normal and
        appropriate products of civilisation.
        <hr width="20%" />
        This change [to "industrial habits" of "forethought"] is
        but one of several influences which, as civilisation
        advances, diminish the spirit of reverence among mankind.
        Reverence is one of those feelings which, in utilitarian
        systems, would occupy at best a very ambiguous position;
        for it is extremely questionable whether the great evils
        that have grown out of it in the form of religious
        superstition and persecution and political servitude have
        not made it a source of more unhappiness than happiness.
        Yet, however doubtful may be its position if estimated by
        its bearing on happiness and on progress, there are few
        persons who are not conscious that no character can attain
        a supreme degree of excellence in which a reverential
        spirit is wanting. Of all the forms of moral goodness it is
        that to which the epithet beautiful may be most
        emphatically applied. Yet the habits of advancing
        civilisation are, if I mistake not, inimical to its growth.
        For reverence grows out of a sense of constant dependence.
        It is fostered by that condition of religious thought in
        which men believe that each incident that befalls them is
        directly and specially ordained, and when every event is
        therefore fraught with a moral import. It is fostered by
        that condition of scientific knowledge in which every
        portentous natural phenomenon is supposed to be the result
        of a direct divine interposition, and awakens in
        consequence emotions of humility and awe. It is fostered in
        that state of political life when loyalty or reverence for
        the sovereign is the dominating passion, when an
        aristocracy, branching forth from the throne, spreads
        habits of deference and subordination through every
        village, when a revolutionary, a democratic, and a
        sceptical spirit are alike unknown. Every great change,
        either of belief or circumstance, brings with it a change
        of emotions. The self-assertion of liberty, the levelling
        of democracy, the dissecting-knife of criticism, the
        economical revolutions that reduce the relations of classes
        to simple contracts, the agglomeration of population, and
        the facilities of locomotion that sever so many ancient
        ties, are all incompatible with the type of virtue which
        existed before the power of tradition was broken, and when
        the chastity of faith was yet unstained. Benevolence,
        uprightness, enterprise, intellectual honesty, a love of
        freedom, and a hatred of superstition are multiplying
        around us, but we look in vain for that most beautiful
        character of the past, so distrustful of self, and so
        trustful of others, so rich in self-denial and modesty, so
        simple, so earnest, and so devout, which even when,
        Ixion-like, it bestowed its affections upon a cloud, made
        its very illusions the source of some of the purest virtues
        of our nature. In a few minds, the contemplation of the
        sublime order of nature produces a reverential feeling, but
        to the great majority of mankind it is an incontestable
        though mournful fact, that the discovery of controlling and
        unchanging law deprives phenomena of their moral
        significance, and nearly all the social and political
        spheres in which reverence was fostered have passed away.
        Its most beautiful displays are not in nations like the
        Americans or the modern French, who have thrown themselves
        most fully into the tendencies of this age, but rather in
        secluded regions like Styria or the Tyrol. Its artistic
        expression is found in no work of modern genius, but in the
        medieval cathedral, which, mellowed but not impaired by
        time, still gazes on us in its deathless beauty through the
        centuries of the past. A superstitious age, like every
        other phase of human history, has its distinctive virtues,
        which must necessarily decline before a new stage of
        progress can be attained.
