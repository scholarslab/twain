        As a fantasy of time travel, <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> may
        be MT's most imaginatively original book. At the same time,
        as his sendup of the Camelot legend and an attempt to
        re-present Europe's feudal history, it is probably the most
        derived of his novels, the one most dependent on other
        books. Anticipating British criticism of his anti-romantic
        depiction of the Middle Ages, MT considered adding an
        appendix that would supply documentation for specific
        episodes in the novel, and toward that end he went through
        the manuscript identifying specific works as sources for
        Hank's various descriptions of and pronouncements about the
        life in the sixth century. This section of the archive
        makes no claim to be that thorough. Instead, below is
        simply a carefully chosen sampling of the various texts
        that served MT as inspirations, provocations or guidebooks.
        The design is to represent the range of material on which
        his imagination fed, and to suggest how, although his
        "Yankee" goes east to an aristocratic and slave-owning
        culture, in some respects MT was also using Old World past
        as a scene on which to stage his own ambivalent feelings
        about the South in which his own past took place.
