          <h2>The Morte de Malory</h2></center>

<img src="lanier1.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" alt= "BOY'S KING ARTHUR ILLUSTRATION" />

        <p>[<i>According to MT's own account, the event that
        precipitated</i> Connecticut Yankee <i>was his purchase of
        a book --</i> The Morte Darthur<i>. As Alan Gribben has
        established, in November 1880 someone in the Clemens
        household ordered Sidney Lanier's recently published</i>
        <a href="lanier.html">The Boy's King Arthur</a><i>, from which
        the illustrations on this page were taken. MT's familiarity
        with Lanier is indicated by his reference in an 1883 letter
        to the episode he cites in the opening of </i>Connecticut
        Yankee<i>, the tale of Sir Launcelot in Sir Kay's armor. The
        purchase to which MT attributed his novel's genesis,
        however, took place in December 1884, when he and George
        Washington Cable ducked out of the rain and into a
        bookstore in Rochester, New York, and Cable recommended
        Malory to MT as a good book to take along for his personal
        reading on the public reading tour the two writers 
        were embarked on.</i></p>

        <p>[<i>MT was delighted with Malory. Until the tour finished at
        the end of February 1885, Camelot became a part of the
        daily life he and Cable lived on the road. As MT told Livy
        in a letter dated 4 February, "we have all used the quaint
        language of</i> [<i>Malory's</i>] <i>book in the cars &amp; hotels"; a
        telegram sent to their manager the day before, for example,
        had been signed "Sir Mark Twain" and "Sir Geo. W. Cable."
        It was probably while on this tour that <a href=
        "cyjournal.html">MT entered into his journal</a> the idea
        about dreaming of being a knight in armor, and by the
        spring he was actively planning the novel. What influence
        the reading tour, in which he was performing </i>Huck Finn<i>
        before live audiences, might have had on the story of Hank
        Morgan's elaborate performance as Sir Boss is a question
        that needs considering. The influence of Malory's book, on
        the other hand, is a less speculative subject.</i></p>


        <p>[<i>From the beginnings of his career as American humorist and
        realist, MT had often defined his project as a re-writing.
        Although in 1886 he wrote <a href="cymrsf.html">a letter to
        Mary Fairbanks</a> to reassure her that he would treat the
        great heroes of Malory's world with the reverence they
        deserved, it is clear that a conscious animus for the novel
        is the desire to burlesque, parody and debunk the </i>Morte
        Darthur's<i> romantic account of aristocratic chivalry.
        Indeed, one of the most unusual and perhaps modern aspects
        of </i>Connecticut Yankee<i> as a novel is the extensive use it
        makes of quotation. In the novel's introductory frame
        chapter, "Mark Twain" is reading Malory and dreaming of the
        olden times when Hank Morgan begins telling his story, and
        at a number of points throughout the novel MT puts Hank's
        vernacular voice and irreverent temperament into direct
        contact with Malory's stately narrative.</i></p>


        <p>[<i>For a complete account of the passages from Malory's book
        that MT interpolates into his text,</i> <a href=
        "malory2.html"><font size="-1">CLICK HERE</font></a>. <i>What
        follows below are Chapters 11, 12 and 13 from Book VI of
        the </i>Morte Darthur<i>. According the manuscript of </i>Connecticut
        Yankee,<i> MT originally planned to quote <font size=
        "-1">CHAPTER XIII</font> as the textual bridge that would
        lead into Hank's story of "The Lost Land." As a second
        thought, he planned to use all three chapters reproduced
        here. Finally, however, he decided to use only most of
        <font size="-1">CHAPTER XI</font>. It's interesting to
        think about what attracted MT's attention to this section
        of Malory. Launcelot in Kay's armor makes him a kind of
        impostor, of course, and as "Mark Twain" Sam Clemens was
        fascinated by the figure of the impostor. Given how
        memorable the motif of sneaking out one's bedroom window is
        in both </i>Tom Sawyer<i> and </i>Huck Finn<i>, it's also fun to note how
        the adventures of Sir Launcelot recorded here involve the
        same maneuver. The <font color="#0033CC">passage in blue</font> </i>below <i> is the one that MT  
ended up using in </i>Connecticut Yankee.]</p>

          <i>How Sir Launcelot slew two giants, and<br />
          made a castle free.</i>
        </center><br />
        <p><img src="lanier2.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" alt= "BOY'S KING ARTHUR ILLUSTRATION" />
        A<font size="-1">NON</font> withal came there upon him two
        great giants, well armed all save the heads, with two
        horrible clubs in their hands. Sir Launcelot put his shield
        afore him, and put the stroke away of the one giant, and
        with his sword he clave his head asunder. When his fellow
        saw that, he ran away as he were wood, for fear of the
        horrible strokes, and Sir Launcelot after him with all his
        might, and smote him on the shoulder, and clave him to the
        middle. Then Sir Launcelot went into the hall, and there
        came afore him threescore ladies and damsels, and all
        kneeled unto him, and thanked God and him of their
        deliverance. For, sir, said they, the most part of us have
        been here this seven year their prisoners, and we have
        worked all manner of silk works for our meat, and we are
        all great gentlewomen born, and blessed be the time,
        knight, that ever thou wert born; for thou hast done the
        most worship that ever did knight in the world, that will
        we bear record, and we all pray you to tell us your name,
        that we may tell our friends who delivered us out of
        prison. Fair damsels, he said, my name is Sir Launcelot du
        Lake. Ah, sir, said they all, well mayest thou be he, for
        else save yourself, as we deemed, there might never knight
        have the better of these two giants, for many fair knights
        have assayed it, and here have ended, and many times have
        we wished after you, and these two giants dread never
        knight but you. Now may ye say, said Sir Launcelot, unto
        your friends, how and who hath delivered you, and greet
        them all from me, and if that I come in any of your
        marches, shew me such cheer as ye have cause; and what
        treasure that there is in this castle I give it you for a
        reward for your grievance: and the lord that is the owner
        of this castle I would that he received it as is right.
        Fair sir, said they, the name of this castle is Tintagil,
        and a duke owned it some time that had wedded fair Igraine,
        and after wedded her Uther Pendragon and gat on her Arthur.
        Well, said Sir Launcelot, I understand to whom this castle
        belongeth. <font color="#0033CC">And so he departed from
        them and betaught them unto God. And then he mounted upon
        his horse, and rode into many strange and wild countries
        and through many waters and valleys, and evil was he
        lodged. And at the last by fortune him happened against a
        night to come to a fair courtelage, and therein he found an
        old gentlewoman that lodged him with a good will, and there
        he had good cheer for him and his horse. And when time was,
        his host brought him into a fair garret over the gate to
        his bed. There Sir Launcelot unarmed him, and set his
        harness by him, and went to bed, and anon he fell on sleep.
        So soon after there came one on horseback, and knocked at
        the gate in great haste. And when Sir Launcelot heard this
        he arose up, and looked out at the window, and saw by the
        moon-light three knights came riding after that one man,
        and all three lashed on him at once with swords, and that
        one knight turned on them knightly again and defended him.
        Truly, said Sir Launcelot, yonder one knight shall I help,
        for it were shame for me to see three knights on one, and
        if he be slain I am partner of his death. And therewith he
        took his harness and went out at a window by a sheet down
        to the four knights, and then Sir Launcelot said on high,
        Turn you knights unto me, and leave your fighting with that
        knight. And then they all three left Sir Kay, and turned
        unto Sir Launcelot, and there began great battle, for they
        alight all three, and strake many great strokes at Sir
        Launcelot, and assailed him on every side. Then Sir Kay
        dressed him for to have holpen Sir Launcelot. Nay, sir,
        said he, I will none of your help, therefore as ye will
        have my help let me alone with them. Sir Kay for the
        pleasure of the knight suffered him for to do his will, and
        so stood aside. And then anon within six strokes Sir
        Launcelot had stricken them to the earth.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#0033CC">And then they all three cried, Sir
        knight, we yield us unto you as man of might matchless. As
        to that, said Sir Launcelot, I will not take your yielding
        unto me, but so that ye yield you unto Sir Kay the
        seneschal, on that covenant I will save your lives and else
        not. Fair knight, said they, that were we loth to do; for
        as for Sir Kay we chased him hither, and had overcome him
        had not ye been; therefore to yield us unto him it were no
        reason. Well, as to that, said Sir Launcelot, advise you
        well, for ye may choose whether ye will die or live, for
        and ye be yielden it shall be unto Sir Kay. Fair knight,
        then they said, in saving our lives we will do as thou
        commandest us. Then shall ye, said Sir Launcelot, on
        Whitsunday next coming go unto the court of king Arthur,
        and there shall ye yield you unto queen Guenever, and put
        you all three in her grace and mercy, and say that Sir Kay
        sent you thither to be her prisoners.</font> Sir, they
        said, it shall done by the faith of our bodies, and we be
        living. And there they swore, every knight upon his sword.
        And so Sir Launcelot suffered them so to depart. And then
        Sir Launcelot knocked at the gate with the pommel of his
        sword, and with that came his host, and in they entered,
        Sir Kay and he. Sir, said his host, I wend ye had been in
        your bed. So I was, said Sir Launcelot, but I arose and
        lept out at my window for to help an old fellow of mine.
        And so when they came nigh the light Sir Kay knew well that
        it was Sir Launcelot, and therewith he kneeled down and
        thanked him of all his kindness that he hath holpen him
        twice from the death. Sir, he said, I have done nothing but
        that I ought to do, and ye are welcome, and here shall ye
        repose you and take your rest. So when Sir Kay was unarmed
        he asked after meat, so there was meat fetched him, and he
        ate strongly. And when he had supped they went to their
        beds, and were lodged together in one bed. <font color=
        "#0033CC">On the morn Sir Launcelot arose early, and left
        Sir Kay sleeping: and Sir Launcelot took Sir Kay's armour
        and his shield and armed him: and so he went to the stable
        and took his horse and took his leave of his host, and so
        he departed. Then soon after arose Sir Kay and missed Sir
        Launcelot : and then he espied that he had his armour and
        his horse. Now by my faith I know well that he will grieve
        some of the court of king Arthur: for on him knights will
        be bold, and deem that it is I, and that will beguile them:
        and because of his armour and shield I am sure I shall ride
        in peace. And then soon after departed Sir Kay, and thanked
        his host.</font></p>

          <i>How Sir Launcelot rode disguised in Sir Kay's<br />
          harness, and how be smote down a knight.</i>
        </center><br />
        <p>N<font size="-1">OW</font> turn we unto Sir Launcelot that
        had ridden long in a great forest, and at the last he came
        into a low country full of fair rivers and meadows. And
        afore him he saw a long bridge, and three pavilions stood
        thereon of silk and sandal of divers hue. And without the
        pavilions hung three white shields on truncheons of spears,
        and great long spears stood upright by the pavilions, and
        at every pavilion's door stood three fresh squires, and so
        Sir Launcelot passed by them, and spake no word. When he
        was past the three knights said that it was the proud Kay,
        he weeneth no knight so good as he, and the contrary is
        ofttime proved. By my faith, said one of the knights, his
        name was Sir Gaunter, I will ride after him and assay him
        for all his pride, and ye may behold how that I speed. So
        this knight, Sir Gaunter, armed him, and hung his shield
        upon his shoulder and mounted upon a great horse, and gat
        his spear in his hand, and galloped after Sir Launcelot.
        And when he came nigh him, he cried, Abide thou proud
        knight Sir Kay, for thou shalt not pass quit. So Sir
        Launcelot turned him, and either fewtred their spears, and
        came together with all their mights, and Sir Gaunter's
        spear brake, but Sir Launcelot smote him down, horse and
        man. And when Sir Gaunter was at the earth his brethren
        said each one to other, Yonder knight is not Sir Kay, for
        he is bigger than he. I dare lay my head, said Sir Gilmere,
        yonder knight hath slain Sir Kay and hath taken his horse
        and harness. Whether it be so or no, said Sir Raynold the
        third brother, let us now go mount upon our horses and
        rescue our brother Sir Gaunter upon pain of death. We all
        shall have work enough to match that knight, for ever me
        seemeth by his person it is Sir Launcelot, or Sir Tristam,
        or Sir Pelleas the good knight. Then anon they took their
        horses and overtook Sir Launcelot, and Sir Gilmere put
        forth his spear and ran to Sir Launcelot and Sir Launcelot
        smote him down that he lay in a swoon. Sir knight, said Sir
        Raynold, thou art a strong man, and. as I suppose, thou
        hast slain my two brethren, for the which riseth my heart
        sore against thee; and if I might with my worship I would
        not have ado with thee, but needs I must take part as they
        do; and therefore knight, he said, keep thyself. And so
        they hurtled together with all their mights, and all
        to-shivered both their spears. And then they drew their
        swords and lashed together eagerly. Anon therewith arose
        Sir Gaunter, and came unto his brother Sir Gilmere, and bad
        him arise and help we our brother Sir Raynold, that yonder
        marvellously matcheth yonder good knight. Therewithal they
        lept on their horses, and hurtled unto Sir Launcelot. And
        when he saw them come, he smote a sore stroke unto Sir
        Raynold, that he fell off his horse to the ground, and then
        he struck to the other two brethren, and at two strokes he
        strake them down to the earth. With that Sir Raynold began
        to start up with his head all bloody, and came straight
        unto Sir Launcelot. Now let be, said Sir Launcelot, I was
        not far from thee when thou wert made knight, Sir Raynold,
        and also I know thou art a good knight, and loth I were to
        slay thee. Gramercy, said Sir Raynold, as for your
        goodness; and I dare say as for me and my brethren, we will
        not be loth to yield us unto you, with that we knew your
        name; for well we know ye are not Sir Kay. As for that be
        it as it may, for ye shall yield you unto dame Guenever,
        and look that ye be with her on Whitsunday, and yield you
        unto her as prisoners, and say that Sir Kay sent you unto
        her. Then they swore it should be done. And so passed forth
        Sir Launcelot, and each one of the brethren helped each
        other as well as they might.</p>

          <i>How Sir Launcelot justed against four knights<br />
          of the Round Table, and overthrew them.</i>
        </center><br />
        <p>S<font size="-1">O</font> Sir Launcelot rode into a deep
        forest, and there by in a slade he saw four knights hoving
        under an oak, and they were of Arthur's court; one was
        Sagramour le Desirous, and Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir
        Gawaine, and Sir Uwaine. Anon as these four knights had
        espied Sir Launcelot they wend by his arms it had been Sir
        Kay. Now by my faith, said Sir Sagramour, I will prove Sir
        Kay's might, and gat his spear in his hand, and came toward
        Sir Launcelot. Therewith Sir Launcelot was ware, and knew
        him well, and fewtred his spear against him, and smote Sir
        Sagramour so sore that horse and man fell both to the
        earth. Lo, my fellows, said Sir Ector, yonder ye may see
        what a buffet he hath; that knight is much bigger than ever
        was Sir Kay. Now shall ye see what I may do to him. So Sir
        Ector gat his spear in his hand and galloped toward Sir
        Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot smote him through the shield
        and shoulder that horse and man went to the earth, and ever
        his spear held. By my faith, said Sir Uwaine, yonder is a
        strong knight, and I am sure he hath slain Sir Kay; and I
        see by his great strength it will be hard to match him. And
        therewithal Sir Uwaine gat his spear in his hand and rode
        toward Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot knew him well, and
        so he met him on the plain and gave him such a buffet that
        he was astonied, that long he wist not where he was. Now
        see I well, said Sir Gawaine, I must encounter with that
        knight. Then he dressed his shield and gat a good spear in
        his hand, and Sir Launcelot knew him well, and then they
        let run their horses with all their mights, and either
        knight smote other in midst of the shield. But Sir
        Gawaine's spear to brast, and Sir Launcelot charged so sore
        upon him that his horse reversed up so down. And much
        sorrow had Sir Gawaine to avoid his horse, and so Sir
        Launcelot passed on a pace, and smiled, and said, God give
        him joy that this spear made, for there came never a better
        in my hand. Then the four knights went each one to other,
        and comforted each other. What say ye by this gest? said
        Sir Gawaine, that one spear hath felled us four. We command
        him unto the devil, they said all, for he is a man of great
        might. Ye may well say it, said Sir Gawaine, that he is a
        man of might, for I dare lay my head it is Sir Launcelot, I
        know it by his riding. Let him go, said Sir Gawaine, for
        when we come to the court then shall we wit. And then had
        they much sorrow to get their horses again.</p>
