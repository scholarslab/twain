          <h2>Beard's "Reading" of the Novel</h2>
        </center>Both MT and his publicity talked about how fully
        Beard's drawings "entered into the spirit" of the novel.
        His wonderful illustrations often certainly ignore the
        letter of the text. The first picture below, for example,
        as Hall pointed out in <a href="beard7b.html">the caption
        he wrote for the sales prospectus</a>, "illustrates a story
        told of Abraham Lincoln" -- not a story told by Mark Twain!
        The next drawing, for the chapter in which Hank restores
        the fountain in the Valley of Holiness, ingeniously finds a
        way to make the "miracle" Hank works on the occasion
        consistent with his desire to undermine the Church -- but
        Beard's consistency ignores the complexity, even the
        contradictoriness of the text, where Hank's performance
        clearly (though implicitly) serves the interests of the
        Church. Similarly, Beard's eloquent illustration of the
        relationship between Old World elitism and American forms
        of prejudice and discrimination has little textual support.
        Throughout Beard's drawings attack wealthy capitalists, but
        Hank, as the text presents him, is much more like an
        upwardly-mobile entrepeneur than a labor organizer. The
        last drawing is Beard's representation of the 19th century
        present as the flowering tree of progress, presided over by
        "Peace." Again, Beard's drawings flatten out some of the
        most provocative inconsistencies in the text, where Hank's
        attempt to impose "progress" on the 6th century leads to
        war, and weapons of mass destruction. Like many of Beard's
        illustrations, none of the pictures on this page have any
        textual basis. They illustrate ideas that Beard would claim
        are inspired by the text. In <a href=
        "mtoncy.html#a">comments he made</a> at the time the novel
        was published, even MT's understanding of his own novel
        seems to have been influenced by Beard's illustrations.
