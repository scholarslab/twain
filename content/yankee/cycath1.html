          [<i>In 1885, the Rev. Josiah Strong first published</i>
          Our Country: Its Possible Future and Its Present
          Crisis<i>, which looked at a series of "perils" to the
          American west that threaten to destroy the whole American
          way of life. The book was popular enough to sell 158,000
          copies by 1891, when a revised edition, "Based on the
          Census of 1890," was issued. The new census numbers,
          reflecting the increases in immigration, only made the
          "present crisis" seem worse to those Americans who were anxious about cultural change. In both editions, "perils"
          to "our" country include Mormonism, Socialism,
          Intemperance, Wealth and the City, but the first "peril"
          Strong discusses is "Romanism," which, like Hank Morgan,
          he sees as antithetically opposed to the core American
          values of liberty and tolerance.</i>]

<center><font size="+1">From Chapter V,
        "Perils.--Romanism."</font></center>

        <p>We have made a brief comparison of some of the
        fundamental principles of Romanism with those of the
        Republic. And,</p>

        <p>1. We have seen the supreme sovereignty of the Pope
        opposed to the sovereignty of the people.</p>

        <p>2. We have seen that the commands of the Pope, instead
        of the constitution and laws of the land, demand the
        highest allegiance of Roman Catholics in the United
        States.</p>

        <p>3. We have seen that the alien Romanist who seeks
        citizenship swears true obedience to the Pope instead of
        "renouncing forever all allegiance to any foreign prince,
        potentate, state or sovereignty," as required by our
        laws.</p>

        <p>4. We have seen that Romanism teaches religious
        intolerance instead of religious liberty.</p>

        <p>5. We have seen that Rome demands the censorship of
        ideas and of the press, instead of the freedom of the press
        and of speech.</p>

        <p>6. We have seen that she approves the union of church
        and state instead of their entire separation.</p>

        <p>7. We have seen that she is opposed to our public school
        system.</p>

        <p>Manifestly there is an irreconcilable difference between
        papal principles and the fundamental principles of our free
        institutions. Popular government is self-government. A
        nation is capable of self-government only so far as the
        individuals who compose it are capable of self-government.
        To place one's conscience, therefore, in the keeping of
        another, and to disavow all personal responsibility in
        obeying the dictation of another, is as far as possible
        from <i>self</i>-government, and, therefore, wholly
        inconsistent with republican institutions. It is the theory
        of absolutism in the state, that man exists for the state.
        It is the theory of absolutism in the church that man
        exists for the church. But in republican and Protestant
        America it is believed that church and state exist for the
        people and are to be administered by them. Our fundamental
        ideas of society, therefore, are as radically opposed to
        Vaticanism as to imperialism, and it is an inconsistent
        with our liberties for Americans to yield allegiance to the
        Pope as to the Czar.</p>
