    [<i>The letter below is obviously a response to one from Mary
    Fairbanks to MT. That letter is lost, but based on the pattern
    of the longstanding relationship between the two people it is
    possible to reconstruct its message. Mrs. Fairbanks was the
    woman MT met on the</i> Quaker City <i>trip to the Old World in
    1867 and adopted as a surrogate mother to help refine his
    standards and behavior. She probably read newspaper accounts of
    the reading MT gave on 11 November 1886 on Governor's Island in
    New York of his</i> Connecticut Yankee <i>manuscript, and wrote
    -- as she had almost twenty years earlier, for example, after
    reading <a href="../onstage/woman68.html">accounts of his
    speech about "Woman"</a> -- to chastise him for vulgarity and
    irreverence. Like "Woman" and "the Old Masters," "Camelot" was
    a sacred cultural icon for the genteel class she represented.
    She must have written to warn him against deconstructing the
    castle. Her alarm would have been sincere. How much MT believed
    in the reassurances he sent back to her is a question his
    biographers remain undecided about.</i>]

<font size="-1">DEAR MOTHER FAIRBANKS</font>:

  <p>The story isn't a satire peculiarly, it is more especially a
  <i>contrast</i>. It merely exhibits under high lights the daily
  life of the time &amp; that of to-day; &amp; necessarily the
  bringing them into this immediate juxtaposition emphasizes the
  salients of both. Only two or three chapters of the book have
  been written, thus far. I expect to write three chapters a year
  for thirty years; then the book will be done. I am writing it for
  posterity only; my posterity; my great grandchildren. It is to be
  my holiday amusement for six days every summer the rest of my
  life. Of course I do not expect to publish it; nor indeed any
  other book -- though I fully expect to write one other book
  besides this one; two others, in fact, if one's autobiography may
  be called a book -- in fact mine will be nearer a library.</p>

  <p>Of course in my story I shall leave unsmirched &amp;
  unbelittled the great &amp; beautiful <i>characters</i> drawn by
  the master hand of old Malory (if he drew them -- at any rate he
  gave them to <i>us</i>) -- I am only after the <i>life</i> of
  that day, that is all; to picture it; to try to get into it; to
  see how it feels &amp; seems. I shall hope that under my hand Sir
  Galahad will still remain the divinest spectre that one glimpses
  among the mists &amp; twilights of Dreamland across the wastes of
  the centuries; &amp; Arthur keep his sweetness &amp; his purity,
  and Launcelot abide &amp; continue "the kindest man that ever
  strake the sword," yet "the sternest knight to his mortal foe
  that ever put spear in the rest;" &amp; I should grieve indeed if
  the final disruption of the Round Table, &amp; the extinction of
  its old tender &amp; gracious friendships, &amp; that last battle
  -- the Battle of the Broken Hearts, it might be called -- should
  lose their pathos &amp; their tears through my
  handling.<br /></p>
