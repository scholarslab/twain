  <h2>MT's Comments on Beard's Drawings</h2>

  <table align="center" width="690" border="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td>Here are three of the drawings that MT singled out for
      especial praise. In a letter to Beard, 28 August 1889, he
      referred to the first two: "You have expressed the King as I
      wanted him expressed; both face &amp; figure are noble &amp;
      gracious &amp; set forth the man's character with satisfying
      eloquence. . . . I like the Yankee every time, and you have
      got him down fine where he is naked in the dungeon." And
      according to Beard, when MT saw the drawing at the right, he
      was "particularly pleased with this hut -- wanted to know how
      I knew what was in his mind. (It's a sod house from a sketch
      made out West.)"</td>
