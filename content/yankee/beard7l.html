  <br />  This, as we have said, is a companion to the previous picture. It
  represents a government by the people and for the people. The
  tree grows from the soil of "Common Sense," and the roots from
  which it derives its nourishment are entitled "Free Men," "Free
  Speech," "Free Land," and "Religious Freedom." Around the trunk
  of the tree is wound a scroll labeled "The Golden Rule." The
  fruit of this tree is "Art," "Science," "Mechanics," "Education,"
  etc., etc.<br />
