        <p>The year after <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> came out, Edwin
        Austin Abbey, another American expatriate painter, was
        commissioned to create a fifteen-panel mural for the Book
        Delivery Room at the new Boston Public Library (shown at
        left). The subject he chose was "The Quest for the Holy
        Grail." The two black-and-white engravings above -- "The
        Round Table of King Arthur" and "The Oath of Knighthood" --
        are from a souvenir album of the panels published in 1902.
        The color picture below is the panel "Sir Galahad being led
        to the Seat Perilous." (In <i>Connecticut Yankee</i>
        Launcelot buys the Seat Perilous from Galahad after Hank
        turns the Round Table into a stock exchange.) Abbey's work
        was unveiled in 1901. Among the critics and reviewers who
        praised his achievement was Mrs. Arthur Bell, who wrote in
        <i>The Artist</i>: "Mr. Abbey's 'Quest of the Holy Grail'
        is as fine a thing in painting as Tennyson's interpretation
        of the same theme in verse, and is a proof, if proof be
        needed, of the close kinship between all great thinkers of
        the Anglo-Saxon race whatever their nationality." What, if
        anything, Mrs. Bell thought was proven by MT's prose
        interpretation of the theme is not known.</p>
