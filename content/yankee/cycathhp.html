          <h2>Yankee Anti-Catholicism</h2>
        </center><img src="cycath3.GIF" align="left" alt= "1889 CONNECTICUT YANKEE ILLUSTRATION" />
        "Irreverent" is one of the words his contemporaries used
        most frequently to describe MT's work. He typically treats
        all religions skeptically, ironically or satirically. But
        <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> is surprisingly blunt in its many
        attacks on what Hank refers to as "that awful power, the
        Roman Catholic Church." (To see how often and how
        aggressively the novel attacks Catholicism, you can

        ELECTRONIC TEXT</font></a> for yourself.)

        <p>The particular Protestant tradition in which Samuel
        Clemens was raised had a strong anti-Catholic bias, though
        his own relationship with Catholicism was complex.
        <i>Innocents Abroad</i> displays a good deal of contempt
        for the "superstitions" of Catholic cultures in the Azores
        and Italy, and explicitly sets the Catholic Church apart
        from "the only true religion, which is ours" -- i.e.
        Protestantism, which was the predominant form of American
        Christianity throughout the 19th century. On the other hand
        as owner of Webster &amp; Co, MT enthusiastically published
        <i>The Life of Pope Leo XIII</i> in 1887. His enthusiasm
        was admittedly more commercial than ecclesiastical -- he
        apparently felt every Catholic household would feel obliged
        to buy a copy, and was very disappointed with the book's
        weak sales.</p>

        <p>Given MT's desire to be popular, religion was always a
        delicate subject: he instructed Fred Hall, his agent at
        Webster &amp; Co, to "be careful not to get any of the
        religious matter in" to the sales prospectus for
        <i>Connecticut Yankee</i>. But there's no evidence that he
        ever was tempted to delete or tone down Hank's comments on
        the Church, and he seems not to have objected to any of
        <a href="beard4.html">Beard's explicit illustrations</a> of
        the novel's anti-Catholic theme. Hank's story has several
        different antagonists -- Merlin and Morgan le Fay, for
        example, and the titled aristocrats of the 6th century --
        but throughout the novel "the Church" is presented as the
        greatest enemy of his project to enlighten the Dark Ages,
        and MT's emphasis on "the Church" as the most sinister
        force in Arthurian England goes way beyond the place it
        occupies in his medievalist sources -- Malory, Scott,
        Tennyson and so on.</p>

        <p><img src="church.GIF" align="right" alt= "1889 CONNECTICUT YANKEE ILLUSTRATION" /> Indeed, MT
        ultimately makes "the Church" the evil that prevails over
        Hank's Americanized Camelot, as the priests plot against
        him in secret and then push their followers into war
        against his republic. There's no Arthurian precedent for
        that plot development, but it does mirror fears about
        Catholicism that were widely shared in MT's America.
        Anti-Papism, of course, goes way back in American culture
        -- all the way to the Puritans who founded the country on
        Plymouth Rock and a hatred of Romanism. During the 19th
        century there were two great waves of anti-Catholic
        agitation: the Know Nothing era of the 1840s and 1850s was
        the first; the second was just reaching its height when
        <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> appeared.</p>

        <p>As in the ante bellum period, increased immigration from
        Catholic countries helped precipitate the anti-Catholic
        crusade. Between 1860 and 1890, the Catholic population of
        the United States tripled (from about 3,100,000 to about
        8,900,000), and according to many estimates the Catholic
        Church was the fastest growing demonination in the country.
        At bottom the motive of the bigots may have been economic
        -- the country's weak economy, and especially the Panic of
        1893, led to fears about losing jobs to this new "foreign"
        element -- but their rhetoric stressed instead the idea
        that Catholicism was both inherently unAmerican and, as one
        writer put it in 1889, "on the make." The idea that the
        priests were plotting against the republic pre-existed MT's
        fantasy about Hank, and became stronger during the
        1890s.</p>

        <p>This section of the archive gathers selected examples of
        anti-Catholic rhetoric from the years immediately before
        and after <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> came out. In the
        material linked below, you can hear one side of the
        conversation that popular American culture was having about
        the relationship between Catholicism and American values.
        The voices you'll hear are angrier, more hateful and
        hysterical than Hank's, but they engage many of the same
        issues he raises in his critique of "the Church" as "an
        established slave-pen." How the novel's attitude toward
        Catholicism influenced its popularity with American readers
        is hard to say. MT himself asked one reviewer to avoid any
        mention of the book's "slurs at the church." Only one
        reviewer of MT's novel, <a href="cyboslw.html#a">a hostile
        critic in Boston</a>, notices this element in its story,
        and he protests strongly, as a Protestant himself, against
        the "Protestant intolerance" he found in the text and,
        especially, the illustrations. Whether America's larger
        silence on the issue implies consent to Hank's fear of "the
        Church" remains an open question.</p>
