  <p>That was a little idea of my own, and had several wholesome
  purposes in view toward the civilizing and uplifting of this
  nation. In the first place, it was a furtive, underhand blow at
  this nonsense of knight errantry, though nobody suspected that
  but me. I had started a number of these people out -- the bravest
  knights I could get -- each sandwiched between bulletin-boards
  bearing one device or another, and I judged that by and by when
  they got to be numerous enough they would begin to look
  ridiculous; and then, even the steel-clad ass that hadn't any
  board would himself begin to look ridiculous because he was out
  of the fashion.</p>

  <p>Whenever my missionaries overcame a knight errant on the road
  they washed him, and when he got well they swore him to go and
  get a bulletin-board and disseminate soap and civilization the
  rest of his days. As a consequence the workers in the field were
  increasing by degrees, and the reform was steadily spreading.</p>
