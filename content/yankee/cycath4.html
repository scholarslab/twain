<center><h2>The A.P.A.</h2></center>


<p>[<i>There were many anti-Catholic organizations in
          America during the late 1880s and 1890s, but the biggest
          was the A.P.A. -- the American Protective Association. It
          was founded in March 1887 in the manufacturing town of
          Clinton, Iowa, and first spread through the midwest. By
          1891 it had branches in Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,
          Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and Wisconsin. By
          1893, the A.P.A. had 70,000 members in a total of twenty
          states. The economic Panic of that year and fears about
          jobs produced boom times for the crusade against
          Catholicism: by 1896 the A.P.A. claimed 2,500,000 members
          in chapters in every state in the union. That was the
          peak: by 1900 the organization was effectively
          moribund.</i></p>

<p>[<i>Unlike the decade's campaign against African Americans,
          the agitation did not lead to violence against Catholics,
          and indeed seems to have had few overt political results
          at all. But ideologically it clearly exacerbated the
          divisions and suspicions within the culture. One
          oft-cited measure of its psychological impact is the
          story Elbert H. Hubbard told in an article in </i>The Arena
          <i>(June 1894) about a visit to a friend on his farm in
          Illinois in 1893, who was afraid to leave home to visit
          the Chicago Columbian Exposition for even for a single
          day, because "the Catholics had been ordered by the Pope
          to burn the barns and houses" of all Protestants. Hubbard
          says he found such fears rampant in midwestern towns and
          villages.</i></p>

<p>[<i>The A.P.A. was a "secret order," with initiates sworn in
          at the ceremony that included a series of preliminary
          oaths, administered while they were blindfolded --
          including the oath not to employ a Catholic if a
          Protestant were available, and the oath not to go on
          strike with any Catholics. Then their blindfolds were
          removed (because they were out of "mental darkness") and
          with one hand on a Bible, the other on a cross, each
          member of the A.P.A. took the following final vows:</i>]

I hereby denounce Roman Catholicism. I hereby
        denounce the Pope, sitting at Rome or elsewhere. I denounce
        his priests and emissaries, and the diabolical work of the
        Roman Catholic Church, and hereby pledge myself to the
        cause of Protestantism to the end that there may be no
        interference with the discharge of the duties of
        citizenship, and I solemnly bind myself to protect at all
        times, and with all the means in my power, the good name of
        the order and its members, so help me God. Amen.
