          <h2>Beard's Celebrities at King Arthur's Court</h2>
        </center>Beard annotated a copy of <i>Connecticut
        Yankee</i> to identify the originals of many of figures in
        his illustrations. He used a number of personal
        acquaintances, but also based several major characters and
        a few other figures on photographs of famous people.
        Readers in MT's times would certainly have recognized these
        visual allusions. As a group, they conflict with the
        purpose MT puts in Hank Morgan's mouth, of showing modern
        readers the middle ages as they really were, and blur the
        boundaries between the past and present in complex ways.
        But it's not clear how this feature of the illustrations
        might have influenced readings of the novel.

        Teona Gneiting has identified Sarah Bernhardt (right, as
        she appeared in <i>Le Passant</i>) as the original for
        Clarence.<br />

        As Beard noted, he based his drawings of Sandy on Annie
        Russell, a popular American actress (right, as she appeared
        in <i>Esmerelda</i> [1881]).<br />

        </center><br />
        In <a href="mtoncy.html#b">an interview with a reporter</a>
        for <i>The New York Times</i>, MT himself identified
        Beard's original for the figure of the slave driver in
        Chapter 36 as Jay Gould, the American financier and stock
        manipulator.<br />

        The picture of the most troublesome "lady" among the lot
        Hank rescues in Chapter 20 was based on a well-known
        photograph of Queen Victoria.<br />

        </center>To illustrate the Americanism "chuckleheads,"
        Hank's term for "nobility," Beard used images of the Prince
        of Wales, later Edward VII (top), his eldest son, and
        Kaiser Wilhelm II (bottom).<br />

        MT must have really enjoyed the fact that Beard based
        Merlin's character on the British poet, Alfred, Lord
        Tennyson, whose <i>Idylls of the King</i> was one of the
        accounts of medieval England that MT was "re-writing." You
        can see Merlin and Tennyson in <a href="mtcamlot.html">MT,
        His Times, &amp; Camelot</a>.<br />
