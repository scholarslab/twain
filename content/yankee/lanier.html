      <td>[<i>Charles Scribner's Sons brought out</i> The Boy's
      King Arthur; Being Sir Thomas Malory's History of King Arthur
      and His Knights of the Round Table<i>, "edited for boys with
      an introduction by Sidney Lanier [and] illustrated by Alfred
      Kappes," in 1880. According to a 1 January 1881 invoice from
      Brown and Gross, Hartford Booksellers, someone in the
      Clemens' household purchased a copy of the book, in all
      likelihood the same copy that wound up in the hands of MT's
      only grandchhild, the daughter of his daughter Clara (</i>see
      inscription below left<i>). That copy wound up in the hands
      of</i> Rhio H. Barnhart<i>, a Twain enthusiast who provided
      the images on this page.</i><br />
      <br />
      [<i>Good evidence that this is the original book are three
      marks in the margins of Lanier's text. These were made in the
      same distinctive purple pencil MT used to annotate many of
      the books he read, and were probably made by him -- though
      there's no way to tell when. MT himself implied he'd never
      read Malory until Cable recommended it to him in 1884. He
      could have forgotten that he'd earlier looked at this
      children's version -- or he could have consulted this
      children's version</i> after <i>1884, once he'd begun work
      on</i> Connecticut Yankee <i>and wanted to refresh his ear
      for Malory's dialect.</i><br />
      <br />
      [Below <i>is a chapter from Lanier's edition, but first the
      three passages marked by that purple pencil. By clicking on
      the icons</i> to the right <i>of each quotation you can see
      an image of the marked passage from the book
      itself.</i>]</td>

        There Sir Launcelot unarmed him, and set his harness by
        him, and went to bed, and anon he fell on sleep. So soon
        after there came one on horseback, and knocked at the gate
        in great haste. And when Sir Launcelot heard this he arose
        up, and looked out at the window, and saw by the moonlight
        three knights came riding after one man, and all three
        lashed on him at once with swords, and that one knight
        turned on them knightly again, and defended him.

        <p>"Truly," said Sir Launcelot, "yonder one knight shall I
        help, for it were shame for me to see three knights on one,
        and if he be slain I am partner of his death."</p>

        <p>And therewith he took his harness and went out at a
        window by a sheet, down to the four knights, and then Sir
        Launcelot said on high [<i>in a loud voice</i>], "Turn you
        knights unto me and leave your fighting with that
        knight."</p>

        <p>And then they all three left Sir Kay, and turned unto
        Sir Launcelot, and there began great batttle, for they
        alighted all three, and struck many great strokes at Sir
        Launcelot, and assailed him on every side. Then Sir Kay
        dressed him for to have holpen Sir Launcelot.</p>

        <p>"Nay, sir," said he, "I will none of your help,
        therefore as ye will have my help let me alone with
        them."</p>

        <p>Sir Kay for the pleasure of the knight suffered him to
        do his will, and so stood aside. And then anon with six
        strokes Sir Launcelot had stricken them to the earth.</p>

        <p>And then they all three cried, "Sir knight, we yield us
        unto you as man of might matchless."</p>

        <p>"As to that," said Sir Launcelot, "I will not take your
        yielding unto me, but so that ye yield you unto Sir Kay the
        seneschal; on that covenant I will save your lives and else
        not."</p>

        <p>"Fair knight," said they, "that were we loath to do; for
        as for Sir Kay we chased him hither, and had overcome him
        had not ye been; therefore to yield us unto him it were no
        reason."</p>

        <p>"Well, as to that," said Sir Launcelot, "advise you
        well, for ye may choose whether ye will die or live, for
        and [<i>if</i>] ye be yielden it shall be unto Sir
        Kay."</p>

        <p>"Fair knight," then they said, "in saving our lives we
        will do as thou commandest us."</p>

        <p>"Then shall ye," said Sir Launcelot, "on Whitsunday next
        coming go unto the court of King Arthur, and there shall ye
        yield you unto Queen Guenever, and put you all three in her
        grace and mercy, and say that Sir Kay sent you thither to
        be her prisoners."</p>

        <p>"Sir," they said, "it shall be done by the faith of our
        bodies, and we be living."</p>

        <p>And there they swore, every knight upon his sword. And
        so Sir Launcelot suffered them to depart. And then Sir
        Launcelot knocked at the gate with the pommel of his sword,
        and with that came his host, and in they enetered, Sir Kay
        and he.</p>

        <p>"Sir," said his host, "I wend ye had been in your
        bed.:"</p>

        <p>"So I was," said Sir launcelot, "but I arose and leaped
        out at my window for to help an old fellow of mine."</p>

        <p>And so when they came nigh the light Sir Kay knew well
        that it was Sir Launcelot, and therewith he kneeled down
        and thanked him of all his kindness that he hath holpen him
        twice from the death.</p>

        <p>"Sir," said he, "I have done nothing but that I ought to
        do, and ye are welcome, and here shall ye repose you and
        take your rest."</p>

        <p>So when Sir Kay was unarmed he asked after meat, so
        there was meat fetched him, and he ate strongly. And when
        he had supped they went to their beds, and were lodged
        together in one bed. On the morn Sir Launcelot arose early,
        and left Sir Kay sleeping: and Sir Launcelot took Sir Kay's
        armor and his shield and armed him: and so he went to the
        stable and took his horse, and took his leave of his host,
        and so he departed. Then soon after arose Sir Kay and
        missed Sir Launcelot: and then he espied that he had his
        armor and his horse.</p>

        <p>"Now, by my faith, I know well that he will grieve some
        of King Arthur's court: for on him knights will be bold,
        and deem that it is I, and that will beguile them; and
        because of his armor and shield, I am sure that I shall
        ride in peace." And then soon after departed Sir Kay, and
        thanked his host.</p>
