          <p>My dear Mr. Wyndham, -- It has occurred to a good many
          prophets since Lord Lytton wrote <i>The Coming Race</i>,
          --</p>

          <blockquote><font size="-1">To dip into the future, far as human
          eye could see,<br />
          Show the vision of the world, and all the wonders that
          would be.</font></blockquote>

          <p>but it was reserved, I think, for Mark Twain to put on
          Hans Andersen's Goloshes of Happiness and go back to the
          past, carrying with him all the wonders of the present.
          <i>A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur</i> is a bizarre
          book, full of all kinds of laughable and delightful
          incongruities -- the most striking of its incongruities,
          however, being unconscious, grim, and disenchanting. For
          Mark Twain, as he goes on, gets into a fury so ferocious
          (and natural) with the infernal oppression of the people
          by the Nobles, the King, and the Church that he passes in
          a sentence from laughing into raving at the "good old
          times"; and, like Macbeth at sight of Banquo's ghost, he
          "displaces the mirth" of the feast he had prepared for
          us. His fooling is admirable and his preaching is
          admirable, but they are mutually destructive. In every
          page he preaches pretty much what Richard Rumbold
          preached two centuries since -- "I never could believe
          that Providence had sent a few men into the world ready
          booted and spurred to ride, and millions ready saddled
          and bridled to be ridden" -- but Rumbold preached it from
          the most commanding of pulpits -- the scaffold -- whereas
          Mark Twain preaches it from the sawdust of the circus and
          in the intervals between a couple of jests or a couple of
          summersaults. But it is thoroughly sound doctrine, and is
          needed still so sorely in England and Ireland that it is
          ungracious to grumble at the mode of its delivery. It
          will reach a larger audience, and, perhaps, strike many
          of them more by its grotesque presentation than if the
          preacher wore a less bizarre garb than motley.</p>

          <blockquote><font size="-1">Ridentem dicere verum<br />
          Quid vetat?</font></blockquote>

          <p>Still, such frightful episodes as that of the woman
          who was burned to make a fire to warm a slave gang, or
          that of the hanging of the young mother -- wife of the
          "pressed" man-o'-war's man -- with her baby at her breast
          (an incident, by the way, Mr. Mark Twain, not of the
          sixth century, but of the beginning of the nineteenth),
          freeze the laughter on our lips.</p>
