  <p>The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail now and then. It
  was a several years' cruise. They always put in the long absence
  snooping around, in the most conscientious way, though none of
  them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was, and I don't
  think any of them actually expected to find it, or would have
  known what to do with it if he <i>had</i> run across it. You see,
  it was just the Northwest Passage of that day, as you may say;
  that was all. Every year expeditions went out holy grailing, and
  next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for <i>them</i> .
  There was worlds of reputation in it, but no money.</p>
