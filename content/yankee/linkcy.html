  <p>And when it had got to the worst, and it seemed to me that I
  could not stand anything more, a fly got in through the bars and
  settled on my nose, and the bars were stuck and wouldn't work,
  and I couldn't get the visor up; and I could only shake my head,
  which was baking hot by this time, and the fly -- well, you know
  how a fly acts when he has got a certainty -- he only minded the
  shaking enough to change from nose to lip, and lip to ear, and
  buzz and buzz all around in there, and keep on lighting and
  biting, in a way that a person, already so distressed as I was,
  simply could not stand.</p>
