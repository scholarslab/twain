        <p>Last night's monthly meeting of the Military Service
        Institution on Governor's Island was made entertaining by
        Mark Twain, who read a paper, the announcement of which
        caused the thronging of the old museum hall. Gen. W. T.
        Sherman and Gen. Schofield were present. Gen. James B. Fry
        presided.</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens said that that which he was about to read
        was part of a still uncompleted book, of which he would
        give the first chapter by way of explanation, and follow it
        with selected fragments, "or outline the rest of it in
        bulk, so to speak; do as the dying cowboy admonished his
        spiritual adviser to do, 'just leave out the details, and
        heave in the bottom facts.'"</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens's story is the autobiography of Sir Robert
        Smith of Camelot, one of King Arthur's knights, formerly a
        manufacturer of Hartford, Conn. Robert Smith says of
        himself:</p>

        <blockquote>
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; I am a Yankee of the Yankees, a practical
          man, nearly barren of sentiment or poetry--in other
          words. My father was a blacksmith, my uncle was a horse
          doctor, and I was both. Then I went over to the great
          arms factory and learned my real trade--learned to make
          everything, guns, revolvers, cannon, boilers, engines,
          electric machines, anything, in short, that anybody
          wanted anywhere in the world. . . . I became head boss
          and had a thousand men under me. Well, a man like that is
          full of fight--that goes without saying. With a thousand
          rough men under one, one has plenty of that sort of
          amusement.<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Well, at last I met my match; I got my
          dose. It was during a misunderstanding conducted with
          iron crowbars with a fellow we used to call Hercules. He
          laid me out with a crusher alongside the head that made
          everything crack and seemed to make every joint of my
          skull lap over on its neighbor, and then the world went
          out in darkness and I felt nothing more, knew nothing
          more for a while, and when I came to again I was standing
          under an oak tree and the factory was gone.<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Standing under an oak tree on the grass
          with a beautiful broad country, a landscape spread out
          before me--all to myself. No, not quite, not entirely to
          myself. There was a fellow on a horse looking down at
          me--a fellow fresh out of a picture book. He was in
          old-time armor from his head to his heel. He had a helmet
          on like a cheese box with slits in it, and he carried a
          shield and a sword and a prodigious spear. And his horse
          had armor on, too, and gorgeous silken trappings, red and
          green, that hung around him like a bedgown to the ground.
          And this apparition said to me:<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; "Fair sir! Will you joust?"<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Said I, "Will I which?"<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; "Will you joust? Will you break a lance for
          land or lady?"<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Said I, "What are you giving me? You go
          along back to your circus, or I'll report you."<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Now what does this fellow do but fall back
          a couple of hundred yards and then come tilting at me, as
          hard as he could drive, his cheese box down close and his
          long spear pointed straight at me. I saw he meant
          business, so I was up the tree when he arrived. Well, he
          allowed I was his property; the captive of his spear.
          Well, there was argument on his side and the bulk of the
          advantage, so I judged it best to humor him, and we fixed
          up an agreement. I was to go along with him, and he
          wasn't to hurt me. So I came down, and we started away, I
          walking by the side of his horse, and we marched
          comfortably along through glades and over brooks that I
          could not remember to have seen before. It puzzled me
          ever so much, and yet we didn't come to any circus, or
          any sign of a circus, so I gave up the idea of a circus,
          and concluded he was from an asylum. But we never came to
          any asylum, so I was up a stump, as you may say.
        </blockquote>And so the two wander on together, and amid
        scenes of human life that afford the author many
        opportunities for quaint philosophic contrasts and dry
        humor, until they come to Camelot, to the court of King
        Arthur. Fanciful and curious are the reflections of the
        transposed Yankee about that place--which he at first
        thinks must be the asylum--in its country of soft,
        reposeful summer landscape, as lovely as a dream and
        lonesome as Sunday; where the air was full of the smell of
        flowers and the buzzing of insects and the twittering of
        birds, and there were no people or wagons or life or
        anything going on. Very vividly he portrays the scene at
        Camelot, where King Arthur, with his knights, sits at a
        round table as big as a circus ring, and 300 dogs fight for
        bones around them, while the musicians are in one gallery
        high aloft and the ladies in another. But before he gets in
        there he seeks information from a plain-looking man in the
        outer court, saying to him: "'Now, my friend, do me a
        kindness. Tell me, do you belong to the asylum or are you
        just here on a visit, or something like that?' And he
        looked me over stupidly and said: 'Marry! Fair sir--' 'Oh!'
        I said, 'That will do. I guess you are a patient.'" To
        another he said: "'Now, my friend, if I could see the head
        keeper just a minute, only just a minute.' He said:
        'Prithee do not let me.' 'Let you what?' 'Do not hinder me,
        if the word please thee better,' and he was an under cook,
        and had no time to talk, though he would like to another
        time ' for it would just comfort his very liver to know
        where I got my clothes."

        <p>Then another, a lad, came to him saying that he was a
        page. "'Oh! go along,' I said; 'you ain't more than a
        paragraph.'" The page happened to mention that he was born
        in the beginning of the year 513.</p>

        <blockquote>
          It made the cold chills creep over me. I stopped and
          said, a little faintly, "Now, maybe I didn't hear you
          just right. Would you say that again, and say it slow.
          What year did you say it was?" "513."<br />
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; "And, according to your notions, according
          to your lights and superstitions, what year is it now?"
          "Why," he said, "the year 528, the 19th of June." Well, I
          felt a mournful sinking of the heart, and muttered: "I
          shall never see my friends again--never see my friends
          any more: they won't be born for as much as a thousand
          years."
        </blockquote>The speaker had often been interrupted by
        laughter, but at the originality and fun of that conceit
        his auditors laughed until they cried, and kept on laughing
        with renewed outbursts over and over again. How the cute
        Yankee determined to get at the bottom facts about the year
        by watching for a total eclipse of the sun that he
        remembered the almanac of 1884 had spoken of as having
        occurred in 528, will have to be learned from the book when
        it appears.

        <blockquote>
          I made up my mind to two things. If it was still the
          nineteenth century and I was among lunatics and couldn't
          get away I would boss that asylum or know the reason why,
          and if, on the other hand, it was really the sixth
          century, all right. I didn't want any better thing; I'd
          boss the whole country inside of three months, for I
          judged I'd have the start on the best educated man in the
          kingdom by 1,300 years. . . . But I'm not a man to waste
          time, so I said to the boy, "Clarence, if your name
          should happen to be Clarence, what's the name of that
          duck, that galoot, who brought me here?'"
        </blockquote>The galoot turned out to be Sir Kay, the
        Seneschal. In the natural course of the story came the
        charming description of the interior of King Arthur's
        castle, leading up to a royally funny account of the
        competitive lying of the gallant knights about their feats
        at arms. The transposed Smith looked upon the knights as a
        sort of "white Indians," admired their bigness and their
        simplicity, and eventually concluded:

        <blockquote>
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; There didn't seem to be brains enough in
          the entire nursery to bait a fishhook, but you didn't
          mind that after a little while, for you saw that brains
          were not needed in a society like that, and would have
          marred its symmetry and spoiled it.
        </blockquote>Everybody goes to sleep when Merlin reels off
        that same old story about Excalibur. Guinevere makes eyes
        at Launcelot in a way that would have got him shot in
        Arkansas. King Arthur orders the Yankee to go to some
        unknown place not down in any map, capture a castle, kill
        the colossal saucer-eyed ogre who owned it, and release
        sixty royal princesses. Of course he went, but he
        reflected:

        <blockquote>
          &#x00A0; &#x00A0; Well, of all the d----d contracts, this is
          boss! I offered to sublet it to Sir Launcelot, to let him
          have it at ninety days, with no margin, but "No," he had
          got a better thing. He was going for a menagerie of
          one-eyed giants and a college of princesses.
        </blockquote>It occurs to him finally, after wondering if a
        compromise with the ogre wouldn't work, simply to go back
        and tell the King, with artistic circumstantiality of
        detail, that he has killed the ogre. He does so, and, of
        course, the King and his knights, who are used to
        swallowing each other's huge lies, readily take in his, and
        a brilliant career opens before him as the boss liar of the
        court.

        <p>He took a contract from King Arthur to kill off, at one
        of the great tournaments, fifteen kings and many acres of
        hostile armored knights. When, lance in rest they charged
        by squadrons upon him, he behind the protection of a barbed
        wire fence charged with electricity mowed them down with
        Gatling guns that he had made for the occasion. He found
        that the "education of the nineteenth century is plenty
        good enough capital to go into business in the sixth
        century with," and the next year he was running the kingdom
        all by himself on a moderate royalty of forty per cent.</p>

        <p>He spoiled the ogre business; cleared out the fuss and
        flummery of romance and put King Arthur's kingdom on a
        strictly business basis. Inside of three and a half years
        the improvement was complete. Cast-iron clothes had gone
        out of fashion. Sir Launcelot was running a kind of
        Louisiana lottery. The search for the Holy Grail had been
        given up for a hunt for the Northwest Passage. King
        Arthur's 140 illustrious Knights had turned themselves into
        a stock Board, and a seat at the Round Table was worth
        $30,000.</p>
