  <hr />

  <p>Well, it was a curious country, and full of interest. And the
  people! They were the quaintest and simplest and trustingest
  race; why, they were nothing but rabbits. It was pitiful for a
  person born in a wholesome free atmosphere to listen to their
  humble and hearty outpourings of loyalty toward their king and
  Church and nobility; as if they had any more occasion to love and
  honor king and Church and noble than a slave has to love and
  honor the lash, or a dog has to love and honor the stranger that
  kicks him! Why, dear me, <i>any</i> kind of royalty, howsoever
  modified, <i>any</i> kind of aristocracy, howsoever pruned, is
  rightly an insult; but if you are born and brought up under that
  sort of arrangement you probably never find it out for yourself,
  and don't believe it when somebody else tells you. It is enough
  to make a body ashamed of his race to think of the sort of froth
  that has always occupied its thrones without shadow of right or
  reason, and the seventh-rate people that have always figured as
  its aristocracies -- a company of monarchs and nobles who, as a
  rule, would have achieved only poverty and obscurity if left,
  like their betters, to their own exertions.</p>
