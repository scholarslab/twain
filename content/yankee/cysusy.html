          <h3>A Page from Susy's Book</h3>
        </center>One of the most poignant MT items in the Barrett
        Collection is the "biography" Susy Clemens began to write
        about her famous father when she was twelve years old. On
        this page she transcribes one of the letters MT wrote her
        from the road, while he was touring with George W. Cable.
        Dated Indianapolis, 8 February 1885, the whole
        transcription reads as follows (preserving Susy's spelling
        -- the spelling of Susy as "Susie" is accurate; MT used
        both spellings when he wrote her name):

      &nbsp; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; When I get home, you must<br />
      take my Morte Arthur &amp; read it<br />
      It is the quaintest and sweetest<br />
      of all books. And is full of the<br />
      absolute English of 400 years ago.<br />
      For instance here is a paragraph<br />
      which I will quot from memory.<br />
      And you too may learn it by heart<br />
      for its worth it. There are only<br />
      two other things in our language<br />
      comparable to it for tender eloquence<br />
      &amp; simplicity, one is Mr. Lincolns<br />
      Gettysburg speech, &amp; the other has for<br />
      the moment escaped my memory.<br />
      ------The paragraph just referred<br />
      to is given a little further back<br />
      under the heading "Gen. Grant."<br />
      "There isnt that beautiful? In<br />
      this book one finds out where Tennyson<br />
      got the quaint &amp; pretty phrases which<br />
      he uses in The "Idols of the king"<br />
      -- "Lightly" &amp; "Wave" &amp; the rest. Yes you<br />
      [<i>next sheet</i>]<br />
      must read it when I come sweetheart.<br />
      Kiss mamma for me; and Ben and Jean.<br />

        "Ben" was the family nickname for Clara. The passage from
        Malory MT quoted must have been the following, reproduced
        here with Susy's spelling and punctuation. MT used it in a
        tribute to Grant after his death:

        <p>&#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; <i>Ah Launcelot thou
        were head of all christian knights! And now I dare say,
        thou Sir Launcelot, there thou liest, that thou were never
        matched of earthly knits hands; and thou were the courtiest
        knight, that ever bare shield, and thou were the truest
        friend to thy friend that ever bestrode horse; and thou
        were the truest lover, of a sinful man, that ever loved
        woman, and thou were the kindest man that ever strake with
        sword; and thou were the goodliest person that ever came
        among the press of knights; and thou were the meekest man
        and the gentlest that ever ate in hall among ladies, and
        thou were the sternest knight to thy mortal foe that ever
        put spear in rest.</i></p>

        <p>Susy's "biography" contains one other passage pertaining
        directly to the composition of <i>Connecticut Yankee</i>.
        In a paragraph dated "Feb. 22" [1886], she writes,
        "Yesterday evening papa read to us the beginning of his new
        book, in manuscript, and we enjoyed it very much, it was
        founded on a New Englanders visit to England in the time of
        King Arthur and his round table."</p>
