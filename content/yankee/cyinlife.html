          <h2>"Great Scott!"</h2>
        </center>

      <p>[<i>Behind MT's desire to re- or un-write Malory lay his
          longstanding quarrel with Walter Scott's historical
          romances. There's only one reference to Scott's novels
          in</i> Connecticut Yankee <i>-- when Hank disparagingly
          notes the difference between the eloquent language Sir
          Walter puts into the mouths of characters like Ivanhoe
          and Rebecca and the dirty words Hank hears around the
          Round Table. But by making Hank's own favorite expletive
          "Great Scott," MT makes sure his readers are continually
          reminded of Scott's idealizations of the Middle Ages
          throughout his own "realistic" attempt to show the same
          past as it actually was. To MT, Scott's fiction
          epitomized the falsehoods that the Realist writer had to
          correct. In the following two chapters from</i> Life on
          the Mississippi <i>(1882), he indicates how much
          influence he believes "a single book" could exert on a
          culture, blaming Scott's</i> Ivanhoe <i>for not only
          "re-enslaving" the minds that had been set free by the
          French Revolution and Napoleon, but also for causing the
          Civil War. In these passages, MT diagnoses the symptoms
          of what he calls "the Sir Walter disease" -- the
          influence that Scott's romances had, and are still
          having, on the mind of the South -- and suggests how much
          his book about 6th century England is in fact "about"
          19th century America.</i></p>

        <p>Baton Rouge was clothed in flowers, like a bride--no,
        much more so; like a greenhouse. For we were in the
        absolute South now--no modifications, no compromises, no
        half-way measures. The magnolia-trees in the Capitol
        grounds were lovely and fragrant, with their dense rich
        foliage and huge snow-ball blossoms. The scent of the
        flower is very sweet, but you want distance on it, because
        it is so powerful. They are not good bedroom blossoms--they
        might suffocate one in his sleep. We were certainly in the
        South at last; for here the sugar region begins, and the
        plantations--vast green levels, with sugar-mill and negro
        quarters clustered together in the middle distance--were in
        view. And there was a tropical sun overhead and a tropical
        swelter in the air.</p>

        <p>And at this point, also, begins the pilot's paradise: a
        wide river hence to New Orleans, abundance of water from
        shore to shore, and no bars, snags, sawyers, or wrecks in
        his road.</p>

        <p>Sir Walter Scott is probably responsible for the Capitol
        building; for it is not conceivable that this little sham
        castle would ever have been built if he had not run the
        people mad, a couple of generations ago, with his mediaeval
        romances. The South has not yet recovered from the
        debilitating influence of his books. Admiration of his
        fantastic heroes and their grotesque "chivalry" doings and
        romantic juvenilities still survives here, in an atmosphere
        in which is already perceptible the wholesome and practical
        nineteenth-century smell of cotton-factories and
        locomotives; and traces of its inflated language and other
        windy humbuggeries survive along with it. It is pathetic
        enough, that a white-washed castle, with turrets and
        things--materials all ungenuine within and without,
        pretending to be what they are not--should ever have been
        built in this otherwise honorable place; but it is much
        more pathetic to see this architectural falsehood
        undergoing restoration and perpetuation in our day, when it
        would have been so easy to let dynamite finish what a
        charitable fire began, and then devote this
        restoration-money to the building of something genuine.</p>

        <p><img src="cylom1.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" alt="LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI ILLUSTRATION" /> Baton
        Rouge has no patent on imitation castles, however, and no
        monopoly of them. Here is a picture from the advertisement
        of the "Female Institute" of Columbia, Tennessee. The
        following remark is from the same advertisement--</p>

        <p><font size="-1">'The Institute building has long been
        famed as a model of striking and beautiful architecture.
        Visitors are charmed with its resemblance to the old
        castles of song and story, with its towers, turreted walls,
        and ivy-mantled porches.'</font></p>

        <p>Keeping school in a castle is a romantic thing; as
        romantic as keeping hotel in a castle.</p>

        <p>By itself the imitation castle is doubtless harmless,
        and well enough; but as a symbol and breeder and sustainer
        of maudlin Middle-Age romanticism here in the midst of the
        plainest and sturdiest and infinitely greatest and
        worthiest of all the centuries the world has seen, it is
        necessarily a hurtful thing and a mistake.</p>

        <p>Here is an extract from the prospectus of a Kentucky
        "Female College." Female college sounds well enough; but
        since the phrasing it in that unjustifiable way was done
        purely in the interest of brevity, it seems to me that
        she-college would have been still better--because shorter,
        and means the same thing: that is, if either phrase means
        anything at all--</p>

        <p>"The president is southern by birth, by rearing, by
        education, and by sentiment; the teachers are all southern
        in sentiment, and with the exception of those born in
        Europe were born and raised in the south. Believing the
        southern to be the highest type of civilization this
        continent has seen, &sup1; the young ladies are trained
        according to the southern ideas of delicacy, refinement,
        womanhood, religion, and propriety; hence we offer a
        first-class female college for the south and solicit
        southern patronage."</p>

        <p>What, warder, ho! the man that can blow so complacent a
        blast as that, probably blows it from a castle.</p>

        <p>K<font size="-1">NOXVILLE</font>, Tenn., October
        19.--This morning a few minutes after ten o'clock, General
        Joseph A. Mabry, Thomas O'Connor, and Joseph A. Mabry, Jr.,
        were killed in a shooting affray. The difficulty began
        yesterday afternoon by General Mabry attacking Major
        O'Connor and threatening to kill him. This was at the fair
        grounds, and O'Connor told Mabry that it was not the place
        to settle their difficulties. Mabry then told O'Connor he
        should not live. It seems that Mabry was armed and O'Connor
        was not. The cause of the difficulty was an old feud about
        the transfer of some property from Mabry to O'Connor. Later
        in the afternoon Mabry sent word to O'Connor that he would
        kill him on sight. This morning Major O'Connor was standing
        in the door of the Mechanics' National Bank, of which he
        was president. General Mabry and another gentleman walked
        down Gay Street on the opposite side from the bank.
        O'Connor stepped into the bank, got a shot gun, took
        deliberate aim at General Mabry and fired. Mabry fell dead,
        being shot in the left side. As he fell O'Connor fired
        again, the shot taking effect in Mabry's thigh. O'Connor
        then reached into the bank and got another shot gun. About
        this time Joseph A. Mabry, Jr., son of General Mabry, came
        rushing down the street, unseen by O'Connor until within
        forty feet, when the young man fired a pistol, the shot
        taking effect in O'Connor's right breast, passing through
        the body near the heart. The instant Mabry shot, O'Connor
        turned and fired, the load taking effect in young Mabry's
        right breast and side. Mabry fell pierced with twenty
        buckshot, and almost instantly O'Connor fell dead without a
        struggle. Mabry tried to rise, but fell back dead. The
        whole tragedy occurred within two minutes, and neither of
        the three spoke after he was shot. General Mabry had about
        thirty buckshot in his body. A bystander was painfully
        wounded in the thigh with a buckshot, and another was
        wounded in the arm. Four other men had their clothing
        pierced by buckshot. The affair caused great excitement,
        and Gay Street was thronged with thousands of people.
        General Mabry and his son Joe were acquitted only a few
        days ago of the murder of Moses Lusby and Don Lusby, father
        and son, whom they killed a few weeks ago. Will Mabry was
        killed by Don Lusby last Christmas. Major Thomas O'Connor
        was President of the Mechanics' National Bank here, and was
        the wealthiest man in the State.--<i>Associated Press
        Telegram</i>.</p>

        <p>One day last month, Professor Sharpe, of the Somerville,
        Tenn., Female College, "a quiet and gentlemanly man," was
        told that his brother-in-law, a Captain Burton, had
        threatened to kill him. Burton, it seems, had already
        killed one man and driven his knife into another. The
        Professor armed himself with a double-barrelled shot gun,
        started out in search of the brother-in-law, found him
        playing billiards in a saloon, and blew his brains out. The
        "Memphis Avalanche" reports that the Professor's course met
        with pretty general approval in the community; knowing that
        the law was powerless, in the actual condition of public
        sentiment, to protect him, he protected himself.</p>

        <p>About the same time, two young men in North Carolina
        quarrelled about a girl, and "hostile messages" were
        exchanged. Friends tried to reconcile them, but had their
        labour for their pains. On the 24th the young men met in
        the public highway. One of them had a heavy club in his
        hand, the other an axe. The man with the club fought
        desperately for his life, but it was a hopeless fight from
        the first. A well-directed blow sent his club whirling out
        of his grasp, and the next moment he was a dead man.</p>

        <p>About the same time, two "highly connected" young
        Virginians, clerks in a hardware store at Charlottesville,
        while "skylarking," came to blows. Peter Dick threw pepper
        in Charles Roads's eyes; Roads demanded an apology; Dick
        refused to give it, and it was agreed that a duel was
        inevitable, but a difficulty arose; the parties had no
        pistols, and it was too late at night to procure them. One
        of them suggested that butcher-knives would answer the
        purpose, and the other accepted the suggestion; the result
        was that Roads fell to the floor with a gash in his abdomen
        that may or may not prove fatal. If Dick has been arrested,
        the news has not reached us. He "expressed deep regret,"
        and we are told by a Staunton correspondent of the
        <i>Philadelphia Press</i> that "every effort has been made
        to hush the matter up."--<i>Extracts from the Public

        <p><img src="cylom2.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" alt="LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI ILLUSTRATION" /> The
        largest annual event in New Orleans is a something which we
        arrived too late to sample: the Mardi-Gras festivities. I
        saw the procession of the Mystic Crew of Comus there,
        twenty-four years ago--with knights and nobles and so on,
        clothed in silken and golden Paris-made gorgeousnesses,
        planned and bought for that single night's use; and in
        their train all manner of giants, dwarfs, monstrosities,
        and other diverting grotesquerie--a startling and wonderful
        sort of show, as it filed solemnly and silently down the
        street in the light of its smoking and flickering torches;
        but it is said that is these latter days the spectacle is
        mightily augmented, as to cost, splendor, and variety.
        There is a chief personage--'Rex;' and if I remember
        rightly, neither this king nor any of his great following
        of subordinates is known to any outsider. All these people
        are gentlemen of position and consequence; and it is a
        proud thing to belong to the organization; so the mystery
        in which they hide their personality is merely for
        romance's sake, and not on account of the police.</p>

        <p>Mardi-Gras is of course a relic of the French and
        Spanish occupation; but I judge that the religious feature
        has been pretty well knocked out of it now. Sir Walter has
        got the advantage of the gentlemen of the cowl and rosary,
        and he will stay. His mediaeval business, supplemented by
        the monsters and the oddities, and the pleasant creatures
        from fairy-land, is finer to look at than the poor
        fantastic inventions and performances of the revelling
        rabble of the priest's day, and serves quite as well,
        perhaps, to emphasize the day and admonish men that the
        grace-line between the worldly season and the holy one is
        reached.</p>

        <p>This Mardi-Gras pageant was the exclusive possession of
        New Orleans until recently. But now it has spread to
        Memphis and St. Louis and Baltimore. It has probably
        reached its limit. It is a thing which could hardly exist
        in the practical North; would certainly last but a very
        brief time; as brief a time as it would last in London. For
        the soul of it is the romantic, not the funny and the
        grotesque. Take away the romantic mysteries, the kings and
        knights and big-sounding titles, and Mardi-Gras would die,
        down there in the South. The very feature that keeps it
        alive in the South--girly-girly romance--would kill it in
        the North or in London. Puck and Punch, and the press
        universal, would fall upon it and make merciless fun of it,
        and its first exhibition would also be its last.</p>

        <p>Against the crimes of the French Revolution and of
        Bonaparte may be set two compensating benefactions: the
        Revolution broke the chains of the <i>ancien
        r&eacute;gime</i> and of the Church, and made of a nation
        of abject slaves a nation of freemen; and Bonaparte
        instituted the setting of merit above birth, and also so
        completely stripped the divinity from royalty, that whereas
        crowned heads in Europe were gods before, they are only
        men, since, and can never by gods again, but only
        figureheads, and answerable for their acts like common
        clay. Such benefactions as these compensate the temporary
        harm which Bonaparte and the Revolution did, and leave the
        world in debt to them for these great and permanent
        services to liberty, humanity, and progress.</p>

        <p><img src="cylom3.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" alt="LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI ILLUSTRATION" /> Then
        comes Sir Walter Scott with his enchantments, and by his
        single might checks this wave of progress, and even turns
        it back; sets the world in love with dreams and phantoms;
        with decayed and swinish forms of religion; with decayed
        and degraded systems of government; with the sillinesses
        and emptinesses, sham grandeurs, sham guads, and sham
        chivalries of a brainless and worthless long-vanished
        society. He did measureless harm; more real and lasting
        harm, perhaps, than any other individual that ever wrote.
        Most of the world has now outlived good part of these
        harms, though by no means all of them; but in our South
        they flourish pretty forcefully still. Not so forcefully as
        half a generation ago, perhaps, but still forcefully.
        There, the genuine and wholesome civilization of the
        nineteenth century is curiously confused and commingled
        with the Walter Scott Middle-Age sham civilization; and so
        you have practical, common-sense, progressive ideas, and
        progressive works, mixed up with the duel, the inflated
        speech, and the jejune romanticism of an absurd past that
        is dead, and out of charity ought to be buried. But for the
        Sir Walter disease, the character of the Southerner--or
        Southron, according to Sir Walter's starchier way of
        phrasing it--would be wholly modern, in place of modern and
        mediaeval mixed, and the South would be fully a generation
        further advanced than it is. It was Sir Walter that made
        every gentleman in the South a Major or a Colonel, or a
        General or a Judge, before the war; and it was he, also,
        that made these gentlemen value these bogus decorations.
        For it was he that created rank and caste down there, and
        also reverence for rank and caste, and pride and pleasure
        in them. Enough is laid on slavery, without fathering upon
        it these creations and contributions of Sir Walter.</p>

        <p>Sir Walter had so large a hand in making Southern
        character, as it existed before the war, that he is in
        great measure responsible for the war. It seems a little
        harsh toward a dead man to say that we never should have
        had any war but for Sir Walter; and yet something of a
        plausible argument might, perhaps, be made in support of
        that wild proposition. The Southerner of the American
        Revolution owned slaves; so did the Southerner of the Civil
        War: but the former resembles the latter as an Englishman
        resembles a Frenchman. The change of character can be
        traced rather more easily to Sir Walter's influence than to
        that of any other thing or person.</p>

        <p>One may observe, by one or two signs, how deeply that
        influence penetrated, and how strongly it holds. If one
        take up a Northern or Southern literary periodical of forty
        or fifty years ago, he will find it filled with wordy,
        windy, flowery 'eloquence,' romanticism,
        sentimentality--all imitated from Sir Walter, and
        sufficiently badly done, too--innocent travesties of his
        style and methods, in fact. This sort of literature being
        the fashion in both sections of the country, there was
        opportunity for the fairest competition; and as a
        consequence, the South was able to show as many well-known
        literary names, proportioned to population, as the North
        could.</p>

        <p>But a change has come, and there is no opportunity now
        for a fair competition between North and South. For the
        North has thrown out that old inflated style, whereas the
        Southern writer still clings to it--clings to it and has a
        restricted market for his wares, as a consequence. There is
        as much literary talent in the South, now, as ever there
        was, of course; but its work can gain but slight currency
        under present conditions; the authors write for the past,
        not the present; they use obsolete forms, and a dead
        language. But when a Southerner of genius writes modern
        English, his book goes upon crutches no longer, but upon
        wings; and they carry it swiftly all about America and
        England, and through the great English reprint publishing
        houses of Germany--as witness the experience of Mr. Cable
        and Uncle Remus, two of the very few Southern authors who
        do not write in the Southern style. Instead of three or
        four widely-known literary names, the South ought to have a
        dozen or two--and will have them when Sir Walter's time is
        out.</p>

        <p>A curious exemplification of the power of a single book
        for good or harm is shown in the effects wrought by "Don
        Quixote" and those wrought by "Ivanhoe." The first swept
        the world's admiration for the mediaeval chivalry-silliness
        out of existence; and the other restored it. As far as our
        South is concerned, the good work done by Cervantes is
        pretty nearly a dead letter, so effectually has Scott's
        pernicious work undermined it.</p>
