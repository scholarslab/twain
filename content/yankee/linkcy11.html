  <p>Only one thing could explain this: that other magician had
  been cutting under me, sure. This was true. I asked a friend of
  mine, a monk, about it, and he said, yes, the magician had tried
  some further enchantments and found out that the court had
  concluded to make no journey at all, but stay at home. Think of
  that! Observe how much a reputation was worth in such a country.
  These people had seen me do the very showiest bit of magic in
  history, and the only one within their memory that had a positive
  value, and yet here they were, ready to take up with an
  adventurer who could offer no evidence of his powers but his mere
  unproven word.</p>

  <p>However, it was not good politics to let the king come without
  any fuss and feathers at all, so I went down and drummed up a
  procession of pilgrims and smoked out a batch of hermits and
  started them out at two o'clock to meet him. And that was the
  sort of state he arrived in. The abbot was helpless with rage and
  humiliation when I brought him out on a balcony and showed him
  the head of the state marching in and never a monk on hand to
  offer him welcome, and no stir of life or clang of joy-bell to
  glad his spirit. He took one look and then flew to rouse out his
  forces. The next minute the bells were dinning furiously, and the
  various buildings were vomiting monks and nuns, who went swarming
  in a rush toward the coming procession; and with them went that
  magician -- and he was on a rail, too, by the abbot's order; and
  his reputation was in the mud, and mine was in the sky again.
  Yes, a man can keep his trademark current in such a country, but
  he can't sit around and do it; he has got to be on deck and
  attending to business right along.</p>
