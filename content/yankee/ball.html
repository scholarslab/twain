          <h3><i>Slavery in the United States: A Narrative<br />
          of the Life and Adventures of Charles Ball</i><br />
          By Charles Ball</h3>
        </center>[<i>In his own notes about the sources of</i>
        Connecticut Yankee<i>, MT referred to this as
        "Autobiography of Charles Ball." He may have first come
        across this early anti-slavery narrative, published
        in 1837 and reprinted in 1858, in the library of his
        abolitionist in-laws. Ball's narrative, apparently dictated
        to an editor identified as "Fisher," covers forty years "as
        a Slave." Included here are the passages that were used
        most directly in the accounts of slavery in</i> Connecticut
        Yankee<i>. By clicking on the "link" icons, you can see

        When sold I was naked, never having had on clothes in my
        life, but my new master gave me a child's frock, belonging
        to one of his own children. After he had purchased me, he
        dressed me in this garment, took me before him on his
        horse, and started home; but my poor mother, when she saw
        me leaving her for the last time, ran after me, took me
        down from the horse, clasped me in her arms, and wept
        loudly and bitterly over me. My master seemed to pity her,
        and endeavored to soothe her distress by telling her that
        he would be a good master to me, and that I should not want
        anything. She then, still holding me in her arms, walked
        along the road beside the horse as he moved slowly, and
        earnestly and imploringly besought my master to buy her and
        the rest of her children, and not permit them to be carried
        away by the negro buyers; but whilst thus entreating him to
        save her and her family, the slave-driver, who had first
        brought her, came running in pursuit of her with a raw-hide
        in his hand. When he overtook us, he told her he was her
        master now, and ordered her to give that little negro to
        its owner, and come back with him.

        <p>My mother then turned to him and cried, "Oh, master, do
        not take me from my child!" Without making any reply, he
        gave her two or three heavy blows on the shoulders with his
        raw-hide, snatched me from her arms, handed me to my
        master, and seizing her by one arm, dragged her back
        towards the place of sale. My master then quickened the
        pace of his horse; and as we advanced, the cries of my poor
        parent became more and more indistinct -- at length they
        died away in the distance, and I never again heard the
        voice of my poor mother. Young as I was, the horrors of
        that day sank deeply into my heart, and even at this time,
        though half a century has elapsed, the terrors of the scene
        return with painful vividness upon my memory.</p>

        My new master, whose name I did not hear, took me that same
        day across the Patuxent, where I joined fifty-one other
        slaves, whom he had bought in Maryland. Thirty-two of these
        were men, and nineteen were women. The women were merely
        tied together with a rope, about the size of a bed-cord,
        which was tied like a halter round the neck of each; but
        the men, of whom I was the stoutest and strongest, were
        very differently caparisoned. A strong iron collar was
        closely fitted by means of a padlock round each of our
        necks. A chain of iron, about a hundred feet in length, was
        passed through the hasp of each padlock, except at the two
        ends, where the hasps of the padlock passed through a link
        of the chain. In addition to this, we were handcuffed in
        pairs, with iron staples and bolts, with a short chain,
        about a foot long, uniting the handcuffs and their wearers
        in pairs. In this manner we were chained alternately by the
        right and left hand; and the poor man to whom I was thus
        ironed, wept like an infant when the blacksmith, with his
        heavy hammer, fasted the ends of the bolts that kept the
        staples from slipping from our arms. For my own part, I
        felt indifferent to my fate. It appeared to me that the
        worst had come that could come, and that no change of
        fortune could harm me.

        The next morning, before day, I was awakened from my sleep
        by the sound of several heavy fires of cannon, which were
        discharged, as it seemed to me, within a few yards of the
        place where I lay. These were succeeded by fifes and drums,
        and all the noise with which I had formerly heard the
        fourth of July ushered in, at the Navy Yard in Washington.

        <p>Since I had left Maryland I had carefully kept the
        reckoning of the days of the week, but had not been careful
        to note the dates of the month; yet as soon as daylight
        appeared, and the door of our apartment was opened, I
        inquired and learned that this was, as I had supposed it to
        be, the day of universal rejoicing.</p>

        <p>I understood that court did not sit this day; but a
        great crowd of people gathered and remained around the jail
        all the morning; many of whom were intoxicated, and sang
        and shouted in honor of free government and the rights of
        man. About eleven o'clock, a long table was spread under a
        row of trees which grew in the street, not far from the
        jail, and which appeared to me to be of the kind called in
        Pennsylvania, the pride of China. At this table several
        hundred persons sat down to dinner soon after noon, and
        continued to eat and drink, and sing songs in honor of
        liberty, for more than two hours. At the end of the dinner
        a gentleman rose and stood upon his chair, near one end of
        the table, and begged the company to hear him for a few
        minutes. He informed them that he was a candidate for some
        office -- but what office it was I do not recollect -- and
        said, that as it was an acknowledged principle of our free
        government, that all men were born free and equal, he
        presumed it would not be deemed an act of arrogance in him,
        to call upon them for their votes at the coming
        election.</p>

        <p>This first speaker was succeeded by another, who
        addressed his audience in nearly the same language; and
        after he had concluded, the company broke up. I heard a
        black man that belonged to the jailer, or, who was at least
        in his service, say that there had been a great meeting
        that morning in the court house, at which several gentlemen
        had made speeches.</p>

        <p>When I lived at the navy-yard, the officers sometimes
        permitted me to go up town with them, on the fourth of
        July, and listen to the fine speeches that were made there,
        on such occasions.</p>

        <p>About five o'clock, the jailer came and stood at the
        front door of the jail, and proclaimed, in a very loud
        voice, that a sale of the most valuable slaves would
        immediately take place; that he had sold many fine hands
        yesterday, but they were only the refuse and most worthless
        part of the whole lot; -- that those who wished to get
        great bargains and prime property, had better attend now;
        as it was certain that such negroes had never been offered
        for sale in Columbia before.</p>

        Just as we had entered, Lydia came up out of breath, with
        the child in her arms; and following us into the yard,
        dropped on her knees before the overseer, and begged him to
        forgive her. "Where have you been?" said he. Poor Lydia now
        burst into tears, and said, "I only stopped to talk awhile
        to this man," pointing to me; "but indeed, master overseer,
        I will never do so again." "Lie down," was his reply. Lydia
        immediately fell prostrate upon the ground; and in this
        position he compelled her to remove her old tow linen
        shift, the only garment she wore, so as to expose her hips,
        when he gave her ten lashes, with his long whip, every
        touch of which brought blood, and a shriek from the
        sufferer. He then ordered her to go and get her supper,
        with an injunction never to stay behind again. -- The other
        three culprits were then put upon their trial.

        <p>The first was a middle-aged woman, who had, as her
        overseer said, left several hills of cotton in the course
        of the day, without cleaning and hilling them in a proper
        manner. She received twelve lashes. The other two were
        charged in general terms, with having been lazy, and of
        having neglected their work that day. Each of these
        received twelve lashes.</p>

        <p>These people all received punishment in the same manner
        that it had been inflicted upon Lydia, and when they were
        all gone the overseer turned to me and said -- "Boy, you
        are a stranger here yet, but I called you in to let you see
        how things are done here, and to give you a little advice.
        When I get a new negro under my command, I never whip at
        first; I always give him a few days to learn his duty,
        unless he is an outrageous villain, in which case I anoint
        him a little at the beginning. . . . You ought not to have
        staid behind to-night with Lyd; but as this is your first
        offence, I shall overlook it, and you may go and get your
        supper." I made a low bow, and thanked master overseer for
        his kindness to me, and left him.</p>

        <p>I had never before seen people flogged in the way our
        overseer flogged his people. This plan of making the person
        who is to be whipped lie down upon the ground, was new to
        me, though it is much practiced in the South; and I have
        since seen men, and women too, cut nearly in pieces by this
        mode of punishment. It has one advantage over tying people
        up by the hands, as it prevents all accidents from sprains
        in the thumbs or wrists.</p>
