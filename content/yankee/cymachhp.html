        <p>In our time it's called "technology." The terms most
        often used in MT's time were "machinery" and "inventions."
        In both eras expectations ran high: many then felt about
        steam, electricity and the internal combustion engine the
        way many now feel about microcircuitry -- that a new world
        was imminent.</p>

        <p>Hank Morgan, who lays telephone wires and telegraph
        wires across Arthur's England, would have loved the
        internet. To him, inventors like Watt, Whitney and Bell
        were "the creators of this world -- after God." "The very
        first official thing [he] did" as the King's Minister was
        to start a patent office. His program to resurrect the Dark
        Ages through Man Factories and Soap Factories, electric
        lights and printing presses represents the beliefs of both
        MT and his age.</p>

        <p>The exhibits listed below are meant to suggest some of
        the enthusiasm for new inventions and machines that linked
        Hank Morgan to MT to their American contemporaries.</p>
