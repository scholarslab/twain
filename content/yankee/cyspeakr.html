          <p>Mark Twain is also somewhat affected by the Spirit of
          his Time, which is didactic; and by the Spirit of his
          Nation, which is inventive, but not refined. Mr. Lewis
          Carroll is far beyond Mr. Clemens in points of delicacy
          and taste; but it may be doubted whether any English
          author of repute would have tried to win a laugh by an
          irreverant treatment of the legend of the Holy Grail, as
          Mr. Clemens has done in <i>A Yankee at the Court of King
          Arthur</i>. It is quite certain that there are few
          English readers who will care to see the subject begrimed
          with prime American jests. Mr. Clemens used to be able to
          make us laugh without resorting to this easy and
          distressing method; in his last book he fails to make us
          laugh by any method, even the worst.</p>

          <p>But Mr. Clemens is not only dull when he is offensive;
          he is perhaps even more dull when he is didactic. His
          views on the peerage, religious tolerance, republics,
          political economy, and the application of electricity to
          warfare, may be -- some of them are -- admirable. But
          they are out of place in a farcical book: the satire is
          not fresh; the information is second-hand or inaccurate;
          and the moral -- or immoral, as the case may be -- is
          clumsily enforced and unduly prominent. Tediousness is
          still further ensured by the length of the book. The joke
          is a long joke, and the author has not "gompressed him."
          It would be idle to point out that the book is not a
          sketch of the sixth century; because Mr. Clemens is
          careful to remove by a prefatory note any such objection.
          But he must not think that his confession of incompetence
          will make him seem any the less incompetent to the
          intelligent reader.</p>

          <p>The illustrations to the book are occasionally
          allegorical, and remind us of the hieroglyphic which is
          to be found at the beginning of prophetic almanacks. In
          one of them the root of a tree is marked Religious
          Intolerence; but the artist spells quite as well as he
          draws. They are very badly arranged; they seldom occur at
          the right place; and they break into text, making the
          task of reading very difficult. The task was hard enough,
          too, without that. We hope -- we may even believe -- that
          we have seen the artist at his worst; we certainly have
          not seen the author at his best.</p>

          <p>Sometimes we think that we shall never see the author
          at his best again. American humour depended much upon
          quaint and happy phrase. When these phrases are repeated
          <i>ad nauseam</i>, their quaintness and happiness seem to
          disappear. But we have been saddened and depressed by
          reading two long and humorous books, and are, perhaps
          unduly inclined to be pessimistic. We had expected to
          laugh a little; and, instead of that, we have learned
          much -- much that we knew before. And, after all, it must
          be easy for Mr. Clemens to do better; and we know why it
          must.</p>
