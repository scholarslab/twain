  <hr />

  <p>I couldn't keep from thinking about it, and contemplating it,
  just as one does who has struck oil. There was nothing back of me
  that could approach it, unless it might be Joseph's case; and
  Joseph's only approached it, it didn't equal it, quite. For it
  stands to reason that as Joseph's splendid financial ingenuities
  advantaged nobody but the king, the general public must have
  regarded him with a good deal of disfavor, whereas I had done my
  entire public a kindness in sparing the sun, and was popular by
  reason of it.</p>

  <p>I was no shadow of a king; I was the substance; the king
  himself was the shadow. My power was colossal; and it was not a
  mere name, as such things have generally been, it was the genuine
  article. I stood here, at the very spring and source of the
  second great period of the world's history; and could see the
  trickling stream of that history gather and deepen and broaden,
  and roll its mighty tides down the far centuries; and I could
  note the upspringing of adventurers like myself in the shelter of
  its long array of thrones: De Montforts, Gavestons, Mortimers,
  Villierses; the war-making, campaign-directing wantons of France,
  and Charles the Second's scepter-wielding drabs; but nowhere in
  the procession was my full-sized fellow visible. I was a Unique;
  and glad to know that that fact could not be dislodged or
  challenged for thirteen centuries and a half, for sure.</p>
