  This picture is a companion to the one that follows. The tree
  represents the system of government by an aristocratic class. The
  soil from which this tree grows is the "Soil of Selfishness." Its
  chief roots are "Vested Rights" and "Religious Intolerance." The
  devil sits in its branches, and suspended from the limb is the
  dead body of a man, which is the only fruit that the tree
  bears.</td></tr></table>  <br />
