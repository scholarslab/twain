  <p>it stunned me so, when I first found it out, that I couldn't
  believe it; it didn't seem natural. But as soon as my mental
  sight cleared and I got a right focus on it, I saw I was
  mistaken; it was natural. For this reason: a king is a mere
  artificiality, and so a king's feelings, like the impulses of an
  automatic doll, are mere artificialities; but as a man, he is a
  reality, and his feelings, as a man, are real, not phantoms. It
  shames the average man to be valued below his own estimate of his
  worth, and the king certainly wasn't anything more than an
  average man, if he was up that high.</p>
