        <p>Not long after MT traveled east from San Francisco to
        Europe and the Holy Land, "Elaine" traveled west, from
        Germany to San Francisco. The painting was the work of an
        ex-patriate Californian named Toby E. Rosenthal, who had
        been commissioned by a San Francisco banker to paint a
        passage from Tennyson's <i>Idylls</i>. Rosenthal chose to
        depict Elaine's corpse being carried to Camelot clasping
        the letter about her love for Launcelot. The painting was
        first exhibited in Germany, where favorable reviews
        prepared Americans to receive it enthusiastically. It was
        exhibited in San Francisco in April, 1875, where over 8000
        people paid 25 cents each to see it. Before the enthusiasm
        died down, a number of Elaine clubs had been formed, an
        Elaine waltz had been written, and someone had even thought
        of selling "Elaine cigars." In one of the notes MT made in
        his journal while he was writing <i>Connecticut Yankee</i>,
        he considered timing Hank's first appearance in Camelot to
        coincide with the arrival of Elaine's body and the "mute
        boatsman."</p>
