          <h2>Quoting Malory "and all"</h2>
        </center>
	<p>A great deal of the story MT wrote as the
        eyewitness reporting of a Connecticut Yankee at King
        Arthur's court can be traced back to Sir Thomas Malory's
        account of Camelot. The links listed here are to the
        several places in MT's text where he quotes at length from
        Malory's text. Given his larger intention to explode the
        idealization of the Middle Ages, not to mention the way MT
        often treated other dead authors like Scott and Cooper in
        print, he is surprisingly gentle in his treatment of the
        interpolated passages, but the comments he makes
        in his own voice or puts into Hank's mouth are a kind
        of literary criticism.</p>

        <p>Before quoting from <font size="-1">BOOK VI</font> in
        the prefatory "Word of Explanation," for example, MT refers
        to "old Sir Thomas Malory's enchanting book," and speaks of
        "dreaming" over its "rich feast of prodigies and
        adventures." The second interpolated passage is introduced
        more harshly. Before "Merlin" tells the following tale, the
        page whom Hank has just met (later known as Clarence)
        protests against its repetition -- and for him and all the
        other company around the Round Table, "dreaming" becomes
        literal when Malory's prose puts them all to sleep. At the
        same time, after quoting it, Hank says "this quaint lie was
        most simply and beautifully told," though he admits that he
        "had heard it only once."</p>

          "-1">BOOK I, CHAPTER XXIII</font>
        </center><br />
        <br />
        <p>That a text like Malory's "lies" -- is essentially false to
        reality -- is probably MT's most serious indictment of it,
        but before the next interpolated passage Hank re-emphasizes
        the point that Malory's art is too flat. The following
        report of a tournament he calls "quaint and sweet and
        simple," but cites as "its more important lacks" the
        absence of "whoop and crash and lurid description."</p>

          "-1">BOOK VII, CHAPTER XXVIII</font>
        </center><br />
        <br />
        <p>The next big chunk of Malory is put into Sandy's mouth, as
        she supposedly tells the story of the knights whom Hank has
        overmatched with the smoke from his pipe. Here the act of
        criticism is constituted as a series of interruptions, in
        which Hank's unmistakably vernacular voice comments
        explicitly and implicitly on Malory's style and diction,
        and on the way they render reality. He also keeps falling
        asleep, although comparing what the novel includes with the
        original text shows that Hank doesn't sleep through as much
        as he suggests.</p>

        </center><br />
        <br />
        <p>When Sandy resumes the tale she is telling from Malory
        after the interlude in Morgan le Fay's castle -- an long
        interruption which in itself constitutes a kind of
        deconstructive re-vision of the <i>Morte Darthur</i> --
        Hank promises not to interrupt any more -- and doesn't. The
        only sign of criticism here is the note that "M.T." himself
        supplies to Sandy's tale: "The story is borrowed, language
        and all, from the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>." Presumably MT
        expects his readers to infer a lot from "and all."</p>

          "-1">BOOK IV, CHAPTERS XVI-XIX, XXIV-XXV</font>
        </center><br />
        <br />
        <p>The last example of the novel's appropriation of Malory is
        perhaps the most ambiguously situated in MT's text. Hank
        hears it from Clarence's voice, as both an account of the
        end of Arthur and an example of the "something fresh" that
        Clarence has started since Hank left the kingdom -- "war
        correspondence." "That's good!" Hank says before hearing
        the example; after Clarence reads it, Hank calls it "a good
        piece of war correspondence." It is a very beautiful
        passage. By quoting it, defining it <i>against</i> what
        Hank has achieved, and having Hank himself admire it, MT
        seems to be going further than his premises would have
        enabled us to predict to recuperate Malory.</p>
