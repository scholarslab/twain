        <h2>Who's Afraid of the Church?</h2>Hank Morgan is. So was
        MT, at least to the extent of trying to minimize the
        anti-religious thrust of <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> while
        promoting the novel. "Please don't let on that there are
        any slurs at the Church," he wrote Sylvester Baxter, who
        was <a href="cybosher.html">reviewing the novel for the
        Boston <i>Herald</i></a>. "I want to catch the reader
        unawares, and modify his views if I can." But Beard's
        drawings attack English Catholicism very visibly, using
        many of the anti-papist stereotypes that had been part of
        Protestant American culture since the 17th century. For
        example, although the text only contains one scene of
        ecclesiastics drinking, the illustrations regularly link
        the priesthood to alcohol. It's also unlikely that MT
        imagined the "old Abbot" at the Valley of Holiness meeting
        Hank in a dungeon, but Beard does -- so that he can
        reinforce the link he makes repeatedly as well between the
        Church and torture. In his illustration of one of the
        explosions at the end, the caption "High Church" makes
        another kind of link, again without much direct textual
        support, between sixth century Catholicism and the
        established Anglican Church of modern England. Without
        better evidence than anyone has found so far, it's hard to
        know whether these drawings offended or pleased more
        readers. MT's novel appeared in 1889, near the height of
        19th century America's second great <a href=
        "cycathhp.html">wave of anti-Catholic sentiment</a>.
