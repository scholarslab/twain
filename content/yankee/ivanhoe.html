        <p>Walter Scott died in 1832. The plantation aristocracy
        that, MT argued, fell under the evil spell of his romances
        had been a casualty of the Civil War. But by trying to
        demystify the idea of Arthur's Court in 1889, MT was by no
        means beating a dead horse. The popular plantation tales
        that began appearing not long after <i>Tom Sawyer</i> often
        implied that the ante bellum South was indeed a kind of
        American Camelot: a brief shining moment in the past when
        chivalrous gentlemen fought duels and other battles for
        fair heroines. And Scott's tales were as popular at the end
        of the century as they had ever been. According to James D.
        Hart, a survey of America's public libraries in 1893
        revealed that Scott was the most frequently requested
        author by their patrons. To meet such demands, newly
        printed sets of his romances regularly came out, like the 1893
        Dayburgh Edition of <i>Ivanhoe</i>, in which this illustration appeared.</p>
