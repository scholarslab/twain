          <p><i>A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur</i>, by Mark
          Twain (Samuel L. Clemens), published by Messrs. Chatto
          &amp; Windus, is a rather laborious piece of fun with a
          sort of purpose in it. One of the illustrations, early in
          the volume, represents a Yankee tickling with a straw the
          nose of a gigantic statue of a lion, and indicates the
          general nature of the serious purport of the 525 pages of
          that very American kind of American humour of which "Mark
          Twain" is the chief master. Laughing at British
          institutions, and showing that the good old times were
          uncommonly bad times for the people, and that not a few
          of the historical privileges which still exist do not
          suit the ideas of the great republic of the West, afford
          a good deal of harmless amusement and opportunities for
          very trite comment. It is a mistake to decide that
          ridicule cast upon the story of Arthur is an offence in
          any way other than in the matter of taste in jokes. Sir
          Thomas Malory and Lord Tennyson will survive.
          Masterpieces will stand any amount of parody. "The Burial
          of Sir John Moore" and Gray's "Elegy" are just as
          impressive and admirable as if they had not been parodied
          with all sorts of jocularity and ribaldry scores of
          times. One may easily read Mark Twain's book without any
          ill will; but it is a harder task to read it with
          sustained merriment. By writing so much the author has
          shown how mechanical his method really is, and, with all
          respect for the cleverness of the writers of Gaiety
          burlesques, one doubts if anybody could be amused by
          reading one of them if it ran to five hundred pages. That
          is, however, the sort of task which Mark Twain offers to
          his readers. One may be pardoned for confessing that the
          task has proved too severe. A trial of several chapters
          taken at random shows that the author is still as fresh
          as ever in his racy contrasts between things ancient and
          modern, and as quaint in his droll expressions. He can
          raise a laugh once, twice, or even twenty times, but not
          a thousand.</p>
