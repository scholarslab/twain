  <hr />

  <p>By a sarcasm of law and phrase they were freemen. Seven-tenths
  of the free population of the country were of just their class
  and degree: small "independent" farmers, artisans, etc.; which is
  to say, they were the nation, the actual Nation; they were about
  all of it that was useful, or worth saving, or really
  respect-worthy, and to subtract them would have been to subtract
  the Nation and leave behind some dregs, some refuse, in the shape
  of a king, nobility and gentry, idle, unproductive, acquainted
  mainly with the arts of wasting and destroying, and of no sort of
  use or value in any rationally constructed world. And yet, by
  ingenious contrivance, this gilded minority, instead of being in
  the tail of the procession where it belonged, was marching head
  up and banners flying, at the other end of it; had elected itself
  to be the Nation, and these innumerable clams had permitted it so
  long that they had come at last to accept it as a truth; and not
  only that, but to believe it right and as it should be.</p>
