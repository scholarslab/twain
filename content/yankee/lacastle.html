        <img src="cylacap.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" alt= "PHOTOGRAPH OF OLD LOUISIANA CAPITOL BUILDING" /> The
        Louisiana Capital was built in 1847-1850, badly damaged by
        a fire during the Civil War, and reconstructed (to use a
        word with grimly ironic implications) in 1880-1882.
        Restoration work was in progress when MT went back to the
        river to gather material for <i>Life on the Mississippi</i>
        (1883). When he got to Baton Rouge he decided he was back
        in "the absolute South" -- because of both the Spanish moss
        on the trees and the symptoms of what MT called the "Sir
        Walter disease" in the culture. The reconstruction of the
        Capital provoked MT to this diagnosis: "Scott is probably
        responsible for the Capital building; for it is not
        conceivable that this little sham castle would ever have
        been built if he had not run the people mad, a couple
        generations ago, with his mediaeval romances. . . . It is
        pathetic enough, that a whitewashed castle, with turrets
        and things -- materials all ungenuine within and without .
        . . -- should ever have been built in this otherwise
        honorable place; but it is much more pathetic to see this
        architectural falsehood undergoing restoration and
        perpetuation in our day, when it would have been so easy to
        let dynamite finish what a charitable fire began." When he
        finds himself in King Arthur's Court, Hank Morgan's first
        rehearsed public performance is to <a href=
