        <center><h2>The Fight With Rome</h2></center>

          [<i>The Rev. Justin Fulton was a Baptist minister in
          Boston whose crusade against "Rome" began with a book
          published in the 1850s during the Know-Nothing movement.
          In the 1880s he resumed the struggle with more popular
          success, resigning from the pulpit in 1887 to devote all
          his energies to the anti-Catholic cause. He wrote many
          anti-Catholic texts, including</i> Washington in the Lap
          of Rome <i>and</i> Woman in the Toils of Rome<i>. The
          work from which this excerpt is taken appeared in 1889,
          the same year as</i> Connecticut Yankee<i>. Relying on
          familiar stereotypes about priests and monasteries and so
          on, his rhetoric is far more sensationalist than Hank's.
          But his treatment of "Romanism" as unAmerican and opposed
          to "the progress of free thought" nonetheless has
          affinities with the way MT's novel presents "the
          Church."</i>]

        America as It May Be"</font></center>

        <p>The America that is to be is not the cramped,
        priest-ridden, Bible-hating and pope-loving country that
        Romanists dream it will be. There is an outlook for freedom
        left. God never made these beauteous plains, these towering
        forests, these lovely groves, these golden landscapes, to
        be the heritage of serfs and vassals.<br /></p>
        <hr width="15%" />
        <br />
        Let Americans protect the home from the inroads of the
        priest and they will not furnish such numerous contingents
        to convents and monasteries, which are the curse of
        humanity, the schools of laziness, the sinks of obscenity,
        of vices and crimes. The corpses which are so continually
        discovered there are there to attest it.<br />
        <hr width="15%" />
        <br />
        We owe it to our children to adopt an amendment to the
        constitution which shall forbid appropriations for the
        benefit of any institution under sectarian control or for
        any religious or non-religious sect. All ecclesiastical
        property shall be held in trust by a board of trustees
        numbering not less than five members of the congregation
        owning or donating the property. No property shall be
        exempt from taxation except it belong to the state or
        nation. All new voters shall be able to read and write.
        Unless such an amendment be passed, Rome will hold the
        republic in her grasp. The ballot is not free. Romanists
        are slaves of a foreign master.

        <p>The plan is thus outlined to subvert our free
        institutions and to papalize America: "Send over the
        surplus population of Europe. They will come with foreign
        views and feelings and will form a heterogeneous mass, and
        in the course of time rise and overthrow the republic."</p>

        <p>Keep such facts before the people, and there will be a
        coming out from Rome or a coming out against Rome. I would
        not be an alarmist. The republic cannot afford to forget
        the peril: <font size="-1">1</font>. In free immigration,
        which is bringing to America the scum of Europe.
        <font size="-1">2</font>. The surrender to Rome through
        marriage, in which children are given to Rome. <font size=
        "-1">3</font>. The constant inculcation of fertility,
        ostensibly to carry out the Biblical injunction but really
        to increase political power. <font size="-1">4</font>. The
        influence of the women's rights craze, which is giving our
        school interests over the Roman Catholics.</p>

        <p>It is my hope that Americans will wake up and determine
        that America shall be ruled by lovers of the Bible and of
        humanity. Before the progress of free thought can be
        checked there must be a total surrender to Rome of the
        God-given rights won by the blood of our sires and
        brothers. The pulpit is free, the press unmuzzled, the
        church as a rule is in line with God's purpose. Then let us
        resist what cursed Italy, and keep America for God and the
        brotherhood of man.</p>
