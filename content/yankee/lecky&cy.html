        St. Jerome declares, with a thrill of admiration, how he
        had seen a monk, who for thirty years had lived exclusively
        on a small portion of barley bread and of muddy water;
        another, who lived in a hole and never eat more than five
        figs for his daily repast; a third, who cut his hair only
        on Easter Sunday, who never washed his clothes, who never
        changed his tunic till it fell to pieces, who starved
        himself till his eyes grew dim, and his skin "like a pumice
        stone,"and whose merits, shown by these austerities, Homer
        himself would be unable to recount. For six months, it is
        said, St. Macarius of Alexandria slept in a marsh, and
        exposed his body naked to the stings of venomous flies. He
        was accustomed to carry about with him eighty pounds of
        iron. His disciple, St. Eusebius, carried one hundred and
        fifty pounds of iron, and lived for three years in a
        dried-up well. St. Sabinus would only eat corn that had
        become rotten by remaining for a month in water. St.
        Besarion spent forty days and nights in the middle of
        thorn-bushes, and for forty years never lay down when he
        slept, which last penance was also during fifteen years
        practised by St. Pachomius. Some saints, like St. Marcian,
        restricted themselves to one meal a day, so small that they
        continually suffered the pangs of hunger. Of one of them it
        is related that his daily food was six ounces of bread and
        a few herbs; that he was never seen to recline on a mat or
        bed, or even, to place his limbs easily for sleep; but that
        sometimes, from excess of weariness, his eyes would close
        at his meals, and the food would drop into his mouth. Other
        saints, however, eat only every second day; while many, if
        we could believe the monkish historian, abstained for whole
        weeks from all nourishment. St. Macarius of Alexandria is
        said during an entire week to have never lain down, or
        eaten anything but a few uncooked herbs on Sunday. Of
        another famous saint, named John, it is asserted that for
        three whole years he stood in prayer, leaning upon a rock;
        that during all that time he never sat or lay down, and
        that his only nourishment was the Sacrament, which was
        brought him on Sundays. Some of the hermits lived in
        deserted dens of wild beasts, others in dried-up wells,
        while others found a congenial resting-place among the
        tombs. Some disdained all clothes, and crawled abroad like
        the wild beasts, covered only by their matted hair. In
        Mesopotamia, and part of Syria, there existed a sect known
        by the name of "Grazers," who never lived under a roof, who
        eat neither flesh nor bread, but who spent their time for
        ever on the mountain side, and eat grass like cattle. The
        cleanliness of the body was regarded as a pollution of the
        soul, and the saints who were most admired had become one
        hideous mass of clotted filth. St. Athanasius relates with
        enthusiasm how St. Antony, the patriarch of monachism, had
        never, in extreme old age, been guilty of washing his feet.
        The less constant St. Poemen fell into this habit for the
        first time when a very old man, and, with a glimmering of
        common sense, defended himself against the astonished monks
        by saying that he had "learnt to kill not his body, but his
        passions." St. Abraham the hermit, however, who lived for
        fifty years after his conversion, rigidly refused from that
        date to wash either his face or his feet. He was, it is
        said, a person of singular beauty, and his biographer
        somewhat strangely remarks, that "his face reflected the
        purity of his soul." St. Ammon had never seen himself
        naked. A famous virgin named Silvia, though she was sixty
        years old, and though bodily sickness was a consequence of
        her habits, resolutely refused, on religious principles, to
        wash any part of her body except her fingers. St. Euphraxia
        joined a convent of one hundred and thirty nuns, who never
        washed their feet, and who shuddered at the mention of a
        bath. An anchorite once imagined that he was mocked by an
        illusion of the devil, as he saw gliding before him through
        the desert a naked creature black with filth and years of
        exposure, and with white hair floating to the wind. It was
        a once beautiful woman, St. Mary of Egypt, who had thus,
        during forty-seven years, been expiating her sins. . . .
        But of all the evidences of the loathsome excesses to which
        this spirit was carried, the life of St. Simeon Stylites is
        probably the most remarkable. It would be difficult to
        conceive a more horrible or disgusting picture than is
        given of the penances by which that saint commenced his
        ascetic career. He had bound a rope around him so that it
        became imbedded in his flesh, which putrefied around it. "A
        horrible stench, intolerable to the bystanders, exhaled
        from his body, and worms dropped from him whenever he
        moved, and they filled his bed." Sometimes he left the
        monastery and slept in a dry well, inhabited, it is said,
        by daemons.He built successively three pillars, the last
        being sixty feet high, and scarcely two cubits in
        circumference, and on this pillar, during thirty years, he
        remained exposed to every change of climate, ceaselessly
        and rapidly bending his body in prayer almost to the level
        of his feet. A spectator attempted to number these rapid
        motions, but desisted from weariness when he had counted
        1,244. For a whole year, we are told, St. Simeon stood upon
        one leg, the other being covered with hideous ulcers, while
        his biographer was commissioned to stand by his side, to
        pick up the worms that fell from his body, and to replace
        them in the sores, the saint saying to the worm, "Eat what
        God has given you." From every quarter pilgrims of every
        degree thronged to do him homage. A crowd of prelates
        followed him to the grave. A brilliant star is said to have
        shone miraculously over his pillar; the general voice of
        mankind pronounced him to be the highest model of a
        Christian saint, and several other anchorites imitated or
        emulated his penances.</td>

          We drifted from hermit to hermit all the afternoon. It
          was a most strange menagerie. The chief emulation among
          them seemed to be, to see which could manage to be the
          uncleanest and most prosperous with vermin. Their manner
          and attitudes were the last expression of complacent
          self-righteousness. It was one anchorite's pride to lie
          naked in the mud and let the insects bite him and blister
          him unmolested; it was another's to lean against a rock,
          all day long, conspicuous to the admiration of the throng
          of pilgrims and pray; it was another's to go naked and
          crawl around on all fours; it was another's to drag about
          with him, year in and year out, eighty pounds of iron; it
          was another's to never lie down when he slept, but to
          stand among the thorn-bushes and snore when there were
          pilgrims around to look; a woman, who had the white hair
          of age, and no other apparel, was black from crown to
          heel with forty-seven years of holy abstinence from
          water. Groups of gazing pilgrims stood around all and
          every of these strange objects, lost in reverent wonder,
          and envious of the fleckless sanctity which these pious
          austerities had won for them from an exacting
          heaven.<br />

          By and by we went to see one of the supremely great ones.
          He was a mighty celebrity; his fame had penetrated all
          Christendom; the noble and the renowned journeyed from
          the remotest lands on the globe to pay him reverence. His
          stand was in the center of the widest part of the valley;
          and it took all that space to hold his crowds.<br />
          His stand was a pillar sixty feet high, with a broad
          platform on the top of it. He was now doing what he had
          been doing every day for twenty years up there -- bowing
          his body ceaselessly and rapidly almost to his feet. It
          was his way of praying. I timed him with a stop watch,
          and he made 1,244 revolutions in 24 minutes and 46
          seconds. It seemed a pity to have all this power going to
          waste. It was one of the most useful motions in
          mechanics, the pedal movement; so I made a note in my
          memorandum book, purposing some day to apply a system of
          elastic cords to him and run a sewing machine with it. I
          afterward carried out that scheme, and got five years'
          good service out of him; in which time he turned out
          upward of eighteen thousand first-rate tow-linen shirts,
          which was ten a day. I worked him Sundays and all; he was
          going, Sundays, the same as week days, and it was no use
          to waste the power. These shirts cost me nothing but just
          the mere trifle for the materials -- I furnished those
          myself, it would not have been right to make him do that
          -- and they sold like smoke to pilgrims at a dollar and a
          half apiece, which was the price of fifty cows or a
          blooded race horse in Arthurdom. They were regarded as a
          perfect protection against sin, and advertised as such by
          my knights everywhere, with the paint-pot and
          stencil-plate; insomuch that there was not a cliff or a
          bowlder or a dead wall in England but you could read on
          it at a mile distance:<br />

          <br />
          <br />
          When I saw him that first time -- however, his personal
          condition will not quite bear description here. You can
          read it in the Lives of the Saints.<br />
          [All the details concerning the hermits, in this chapter,
          are from Lecky -- but greatly modified. This book not
          being a history but only a tale, the majority of the
          historian's frank details were too strong for
          reproduction in it.--EDITOR]
