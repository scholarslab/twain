          "Lie down," was his reply. Lydia immediately fell
          prostrate upon the ground; and in this position he
          compelled her to remove her old tow linen shift, the only
          garment she wore, so as to expose her hips, when he gave
          her ten lashes, with his long whip, every touch of which
          brought blood, and a shriek from the sufferer.

          <p>I had never before seen people flogged in the way our
          overseer flogged his people. This plan of making the
          person who is to be whipped lie down upon the ground, was
          new to me, though it is much practiced in the South; and
          I have since seen men, and women too, cut nearly in
          pieces by this mode of punishment. It has one advantage
          over tying people up by the hands, as it prevents all
          accidents from sprains in the thumbs or wrists.</p>

        He snatched the child from her, and then made the
        men-slaves who were chained before and behind her throw her
        on the ground and hold her there and expose her body; and
        then he laid on with his lash like a madman till her back
        was flayed, she shrieking and struggling the while
        piteously. One of the men who was holding her turned away
        his face, and for this humanity he was reviled and
        flogged.</td>
