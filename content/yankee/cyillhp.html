          <h2>Illustrating the Yank</h2>
        </center><i>Connecticut Yankee</i> was the second of MT's
        books brought out by his own publishing company, and as
        with <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> he was in a position to
        exercise complete control over the details of its design
        and production. He picked the novel's illustrator himself.
        After considering Frank T. Merrill, illustrator of MT's
        <i>Prince and the Pauper</i> (1881), and Reginald B. Birch,
        illustrator of Frances Burnett's <i>Little Lord
        Fauntleroy</i> (1886), he chose Daniel C. Beard on the
        basis of <a href="javascript:Start('beard0.html')">the
        illustrations Beard did</a> for a tale called "Wu Chih
        Tien, The Celestial Empress," which appeared in the March,
        1889, <i>Cosompolitan Magazine</i>. Beard was commissioned
        to prepare 250 illustrations for $3000. That was higher
        than the going rate for MT's books, but he told Fred Hall,
        his agent at Webster &amp; Co, that he wanted "to contract
        for the very best an artist can do" -- "This time I want
        pictures, not black-board outlines &amp; charcoal
        sketches."

      <a href="beard2.html"><img src="beard2.jpg" align="left"
      hspace="8" alt="1889 CONNECTICUT YANKEE ILLUSTRATION" /></a> <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> was shorter than
      a subscription book was supposed to be, so its design took
      full advantage of Beard's pictures (and a generous amount of
      white space) to stretch its length. Although he had to work
      quickly to keep the book on deadline (according to Beard, the
      illustrations were produced in about 70 days), Beard's work
      displays a lot of wit, elegance and attention to both visual
      and thematic detail. One of the striking characteristics is
      the way the drawings feature many well-known 19th-century
      faces on the book's 6th-century characters. Beard's usual
      practice as an illustrator was to work from both live models
      and "a large collection of photographs" of contemporary
      celebrities and "prominent people." All MT's readers would
      have recognized the original of the sow at left, for example,
      though not all would have been amused. Clicking on her will

      hspace="8" alt="1889 CONNECTICUT YANKEE ILLUSTRATION" /></a> MT's <a name="c" id="c">original
      intention</a> was to supervise Beard's work closely.
      Intending as always for the book to be as popular as
      possible, he was anxious about the points at which his story
      would rub up against contemporary beliefs, and as with
      Kemble's work on <i>Huck Finn</i>, he expected the
      illustrations to tone the book down: "I have aimed to put all
      the crudeness and vulgarity in the book," he wrote Beard,
      "and I depend on you for the refinement and scintillating
      humor for which you are so famous." But he liked the first
      samples Beard submitted so much that he decided to leave the
      artist alone to "obey his <i>own</i> inspiration" -- "I want
      his genius to be wholly unhampered." MT was delighted with
      the results. You can see <a href="beard3.html">a gallery of
      MT's favorite pictures</a> by clicking here. After the novel
      was published, MT wrote an acquaintance that "to my mind the
      illustrations are better than the book -- which is a good
      deal for me to say, I reckon."</td>

      hspace="8" alt="1889 CONNECTICUT YANKEE ILLUSTRATION" /></a> <a name="d" id="d">One of the themes MT was
      most anxious about was the novel's aggressive attack on
      religion: "an established church," Hank writes, "is an
      established slave pen." Although Hall told MT that "it was
      the Catholic Church that would principally attack [the
      novel], and they were not book buyers anyway," it was MT's
      design to downplay the book's anti-religious sentiments, to
      avoid, for example, including "any religious matter in the
      Prospectus" that his book agents would show prospective
      customers (see</a> <a href="cyproshp.html">Sales
      Prospectus</a>). Beard, however, was a member of the Society
      of Friends (the Quakers), and overtly hostile to the
      institutionalized Christianity. Many of his drawings rely on
      familiar American anti-Catholic stereotypes, as you can see
      by clicking on <a href="beard4.html">the cleric at

      <a name="e" id="e">Beard was also</a> a staunch supporter of
      the "single-tax" political and economic program of
      contemporary reformer Henry George. His drawings not only
      enthusiastically reflect the novel's satire on various forms
      of aristocratic privilege; they also use MT's text as the
      occasion for giving visual expression to many of the ideas
      Beard found in George's book, <i>Progress and Property</i>.

      hspace="8" alt="1889 CONNECTICUT YANKEE ILLUSTRATION" /></a> <a name="f" id="f">The artists</a> whose
      pictures appeared on every second or third page inevitably
      shaped the way contemporary readers "saw" and understood the
      first editions of MT's texts. Uncharacteristically, MT was
      entirely pleased with Beard's work: "What luck it was to find
      you!" he told Beard; "There are a hundred artists who could
      illustrate any other book of mine, but there was only one who
      could illustrate this one." Yet Beard took large liberties in
      his drawings. Many of them don't illustrate anything that
      appears in the text, but instead extrapolate from MT's words
      various ideas that have to be considered Beard's own thematic
      contributions to <i>Connecticut Yankee</i>. Although MT gives
      Hank the nickname "Sir Boss," for example, Beard's drawings
      often equate the injustices of medieval feudalism with the
      patterns of late-nineteenth-century American capitalism. For

      <a href="beardsp.html"><img src="beard7.jpg" align="left"
      hspace="8" alt="1889 CONNECTICUT YANKEE ILLUSTRATION" /></a> Because MT wanted <i>Connecticut Yankee</i>
      to appear in time for the Christmas trade, the sales
      prospectus had to be prepared before Beard had finished many
      illustrations. Thus the passages from the novel included in
      the prospectus are unillustrated. But MT approved Hall's
      suggestion to include <a href="beardsp.html">a 16-page
      "signature" of illustrations</a> at the end of the
      prospectus. Hall promised MT the sampling did not include
      pictures of "anything that would apply directly to the church
      or that is strongly political, but whatever makes fun of
      royalty and nobility . . . we have put in, as that will suit
      the American public well." Hall himself, as "a help to agents
      in selling the book," wrote interpretive captions for each
      illustration, describing "whatever the picture is intended to
      represent." To see what pictures were selected, and how they
      were explained to MT's audience, click on the eclipse at

      included himself at the Round Table: the figure in the middle
      at left is a self-portrait. He and MT wound up becoming
      friends, and MT employed him to illustrate a number of other
      texts, including <i>The American Claimant</i>, <i>The Million
      Dollar Banknote</i>, <i>Tom Sawyer, Abroad</i> and
      <i>Following the Equator</i>. Beard himself claimed, however,
      that most publishers and editors were reluctant to hire him
      after his critiques of Catholicism and capitalism appeared in
      <i>Connecticut Yankee</i>. According to him, "the influence
      of vested interests" produced what he called a "boycott" --
      what we would call a blacklisting -- "for about ten years."
      Despite the revelry on display in his self-portrait, Beard
      also became the organizer of the American Boy Scouts, and
      served as National Scout Commissioner from 1910 until his
      death in 1941.<br clear="left" />
