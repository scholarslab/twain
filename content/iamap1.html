<h2>The Azores</h2>
<br>

<p>I think the Azores must be very little known in America.
Out of our whole ship's company there was not a solitary individual who knew
anything whatever about them.  Some of the party, well read concerning most
other lands, had no other information about the Azores than that they were a
group of nine or ten small islands far out in the Atlantic, something more than
halfway between New York and Gibraltar.  That was all.  These considerations
move me to put in a paragraph of dry facts just here.</p><p>
The community is eminently Portuguese--that is to say, it is slow, poor,
shiftless, sleepy, and lazy.  There is a civil governor, appointed by the King
of Portugal, and also a military governor, who can assume supreme control and
suspend the civil government at his pleasure.  The islands contain a population
of about 200,000, almost entirely Portuguese.  Everything is staid and settled,
for the country was one hundred years old when Columbus discovered America.
The principal crop is corn, and they raise it and grind it just as their
great-great-great-grandfathers did.  They plow with a board slightly shod with
iron; their trifling little harrows are drawn by men and women; small windmills
grind the corn, ten bushels a day, and there is one assistant superintendent to
feed the mill and a general superintendent to stand by and keep him from going
to sleep.  When the wind changes they hitch on some donkeys and actually turn
the whole upper half of the mill around until the sails are in proper position,
instead of fixing the concern so that the sails could be moved instead of the
mill.  Oxen tread the wheat from the ear, after the fashion prevalent in the
time of Methuselah.  There is not a wheelbarrow in the land--they carry
everything on their heads, or on donkeys, or in a wicker-bodied cart, whose
wheels are solid blocks of wood and whose axles turn with the wheel.  There is
not a modern plow in the islands or a threshing machine.  All attempts to
introduce them have failed.  The good Catholic Portuguese crossed himself and
prayed God to shield him from all blasphemous desire to know more than his
father did before him.  The climate is mild; they never have snow or ice, and I
saw no chimneys in the town.  The donkeys and the men, women, and children of a
family all eat and sleep in the same room, and are unclean, are ravaged by
vermin, and are truly happy.  The people lie, and cheat the stranger, and are
desperately ignorant, and have hardly any reverence for their dead.  The latter
trait shows how little better they are than the donkeys they eat and sleep
with.  The only well-dressed Portuguese in the camp are the half a dozen
well-to-do families, the Jesuit priests, and the soldiers of the little
garrison.  The wages of a laborer are twenty to twenty-four cents a day, and
those of a good mechanic about twice as much.  They count it in reis at a
thousand to the dollar, and this makes them rich and contented. </p>
