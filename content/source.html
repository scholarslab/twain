<p>S<font size="-1">OURCE</font>: The "cover" photograph for the site depicts Mark Twain in the labratory of Nikola Tesla, the inventor.  It was taken in the spring of 1894, and originally published as part of an article by T.C. Martin called "Tesla's Oscillator and Other Inventions" that appeared in the <i>Century Magazine</i> (April 1895).  The version used here was scanned from the book <i>Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla</i>, by Marc J. Seifer (Secaucus, N.J: Birch Lane Press, 1996).</p>
