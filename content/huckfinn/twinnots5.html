<center>AUTHORS AS ELOCUTIONISTS.</center>

<p> &nbsp; A new form of popular entertainment will be introduced by Mark Twain, the distinguished American humorist, and Geo. W. Cable, the Southern novel writer, on next Thursday at the Opera House.  This will be the first entertainment of this kind given here, and the reputation of the gentlemen who are to appear must be a guarantee of the merit of it.  The brilliant qualities of those men should make this novel entertainment highly interesting to the intelligent public.</p>

<center>"TWAIN" AND CABLE.</center>

<p> &nbsp; Thursday evening a novel entertainment will be given in the Opera House, in which the famous humorists, "Mark Twain" and Geo. W. Cable, will read selections from their own works.  "Twain" is so well known that no comment upon his irresistible fun is necessary.  Mr. Cable has recently come into prominence as a Southern novelist.  His latest work, "Dr. Sevier," has met with popular success.  His selections he reads are mostly from that work.  "Twain" reads from his forthcoming work, "Huckleberry Finn," and tells a number of funny stories in a droll way which never fails to convulse the audience.  Their entertainments are patronized by the most refined and intelligent people everywhere.</p>

<center>TWAIN AND CABLE.</center>

<p> &nbsp; A literary treat such as never before has been presented to a Springfield audience, will be given at the Opera House to-night by America's greatest humorist and one of her most delighting novelists, "Mark Twain" and George W. Cable.  They have been greeted wherever they appeared by large audiences of the most refined and cultured people.  In cultured Boston their audience was as fine a one as the most fastidious could desire, and that it was appreciative the spontaneous applause and constant bursts of laughter that greeted each alternate speaker fully testified.  Had a search been made for two men of letters more unlike in appearance than "Twain" and Cable, the result would have been a total failure.  The Southern novelist is the precise, alert, brisk man of style, keenly alive to his part in the entertainment, his voice full of quavers and graceful turns of enunciation.  On the other hand, "Mark Twain" is the man from way back, who has sat down by the stove at the corner grocery, gathered his cronies about him and is telling a story as only he can tell it.  The one is of the dapper sort, as polite as a dancing master, the other is ponderous and heavy, who for an obeisance merely works his head to a certain noticeable angle.   The two in this way form a splendid contrast and relieve each other very acceptably.</p><br />
