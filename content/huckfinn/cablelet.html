        <blockquote>
          [<i>George Washington Cable wrote home to his wife Louise
          almost everyday during the tour, often scribbling notes
          on the backs of programs as he awaited his turn to
          perform.</i> George W. Cable: His Life and Letters<i>, by
          Lucy L.C. Bickle,</i> George W. Cable<i>, by Arlin
          Turner, and</i> Mark Twain and George W. Cable<i>, by
          Arlin Turner each include generous samplings from those
          letters. Cable's progress reports provide a delightful
          sense of immediacy, almost allowing us to overhear
          Twain's performances.</i>]

        <p><font color="#330099">Yesterday's double duty did not hurt
        me at all. I never did my work before so brilliantly. You
        will be proud when I tell you that Mark &amp; I seem to
        divide the honors as nearly even as two men well could.
        Mark seems greatly pleased with my work, as I am with his.
        As I came off the platform yesterday afternoon followed by
        a tremendous clatter of applause &amp; he met me in the
        door as he was going to take my vacated place he exclaimed,
        "superb! superb!" Even Pond, sitting back at the rear of
        the house, applauded -- first time he has ever done it. One
        lady -- when I read "Mary's Night Ride," quite lost herself
        and wrung her hands hysterically.</font></p><br />

        program for Association Hall, Philadelphia</i>

        <p><font color="#330099">Mark is on the platform, there
        goes a roar of applause! We have a superb audience--both in
        numbers &amp; quality--&amp; we are beating ourselves. Mark
        says as he passes me on the retiring room steps "Old boy,
        you're doing nobly."</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">Somehow I struck a new streak yesterday evening at
        Newburgh. We had a little audience &amp; no end of fun.
        They kept calling us back--There goes another round of
        applause. The laughter is almost continual &amp; even my
        milder humor is interrupted with laughter &amp; applause.
        There they go again! The hall is a large one with two large
        balconies reaching twice around from stage &amp; full to
        the ceiling. Men standing thick in the back of the
        house.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">I thought you'd like to get just one letter from me from
        the lecture hall, so here it is. There they go again! ... I
        closed because Mark was finishing, but they have called him
        back &amp; he is reading the Investment of Fourteen
        Dollars, the same I told you of ...</font></p>

        didn't tell you that I met Fred. Douglass. He came into the
        retiring room &amp; was there when the President was there.
        They met as acquaintances. Think of it! A runaway
        slave!</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">Mark is on the stage reading (reciting) his "Desperate
        Encounter with an Interviewer," and the roars of laughter
        fall as regularly as a surf. I think it 's a great thing to
        be able to hold my own with so wonderful a platform
        figure.</font></p>

        Mark is making the house roar as only a Southern audience
        can. It is an immense house too, although the rain has

        between Albany &amp; Ithaca</i>

        <p><font color="#330099">We had 1400 hearers at Troy. Mark
        was half sick with a cold -- hoarse and weak-voiced, and
        compared with Balt/o &amp; Wash/n the evening's success was
        feeble; but the audience thought it was great. Mary's Night
        Ride had to go without an encore at last. But it wasn't my
        fault and it was the hit of the evening. The Ghost Story
        (Mark's) fell almost flat by reason of <i>persons</i> (2 or
        3) rising in the audience just at the critical moment. It
        was outrageous &amp; I don't wonder M.T. came off the
        platform angry. . . . We were given a nice little supper
        &amp; got to bed at the neat hour of two o'clock, with Mark
        at peace under the influence of our solemn pledge to each
        other henceforth to stop our reading and poke unmerciful
        fun at any one who dares to rise in the audience while we
        are speaking. It is our only defense against this double
        imposition on the audience and us.</font></p>

        roars of British applause. I never heard anything like it
        out of N. Orleans. . . . We are in a big glass
        Horticultural Hall with people so far away at the bottom of
        the audience that their features can hardly be discerned. .
        . .</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">When I go back upon the platform
        again (in a moment) I have to sing my 2 or 3 Creole songs.
        I always shrink from this, the only thing I do shrink from;
        though it's always encored.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">Last night we had great fun. For a
        week past we have been introducing one another on the
        platform in our opening numbers, simply saying, "Ladies and
        gent/n allow me to introduce to you, --------------." But
        last evening to my astonishment Mark launched out into a
        burlesque introduction that filled the house with laughter;
        but I was [in] luck nevertheless, for just at the end of
        his little speech he really without intention betrayed a
        little opening in his harness and in went my dagger and the
        laugh was turned upon him in a torrent. The whole evening
        was a great success from a literary standpoint; but the
        house was not full. Yet there were many hundred present and
        they had an uproarious time. "Mary's Night Ride" went off
        with its usual, and even more than its usual, effect. As I
        said "And they made it!" a big man in the front row of
        seats jumped in his chair and holloed out "good!" so loudly
        that he was heard all over the house.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">Our experience with such
        [apathetic] houses is that I lift them a little with my
        first number, then [MT] lifts them from that stage a little
        higher, then with my 2/d number I lift them to a third
        elevation &amp; with his 2/d no. (being the 4th) he gets
        them into a good strong glow. I am happy to see it is
        working just so now, after all. If he can get an encore
        from them on this we shall have them to the end without any
        trouble.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">There! Mark gets the call back twice over. Now we're all
        right. It will be encores right through to the end.</font></p>

        that we had a good time in Pittsburgh; &amp; so we did. Not
        the best sort, however. We pleased our audience thoroughly
        &amp; it was a large &amp; cultivated audience. The

        <p><font color="#330099">We have just finished a delightful
        evening on the platform before a hearty, quick-wiited
        audience that laughed to tears and groans at Mark's fun
        &amp; took my more delicate points before I could fairly
        reach them.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">I have a little bunch of flowers
        given me by a young lady of the Clay family. Many persons
        crowded round us after the entertainment. All this was
        particularly pleasing to me inasmuch as this is a Southern
        town &amp; the two feelings which I always have to
        encounter in Southern towns were present &amp; evident
        here. A ball was given in opposition.</font></p>

        between Cincinnati &amp; Louisville</i>

        <p><font color="#330099">We hardly had time to eat &amp;
        dress for the platform. The hall is a new one, called
        Odeon. I stepped upon the stage at 8/05, the audience
        seeming to be about all in; but I had hardly begun offering
        a few words of preliminary explanation when the incoming of
        people grew so troublesome from their number that I stopped
        and said that as there were almost as many people standing
        as there were sitting, I would sit down a moment and let
        the aisles empty into the chairs. There was instant
        applause. I sat down &amp; fully 200 people came in and
        found their seats. It seems the severity of the cold in
        some way caused the street cars to be in some way
        impotent.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">When I rose again and said this
        was the first time I had ever attempted to read to a
        procession, there was great laughter &amp; applause &amp;
        my first number went off with the happiest effect. . .
        .</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">It is a great mistake to suppose
        that these little accidents embarrass a ready-witted
        speaker; they are windfalls &amp; can almost always be
        turned to good account, putting the audience into familiar
        sympathy with him. That is, when they are not serious
        matters. Four times, now, it has happened that a lady had
        to be carried out, ill, &amp; every time it has been during
        my reading of Mary's Ride; not attributable to it, but that
        being near the end of our two hours, the room warm &amp;
        the air bad. It happened this time.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">The other night, in Hamilton, O.,
        a man with creaking shoes stalked out of the hall in the
        midst of one of Mark's numbers. You know I told you we had
        decided to give any such person's a shot across his bows.
        So Mark calls out in the most benevolent &amp; persuasive
        tone, "Take your shoes off, please; take your shoes off" --
        to the great delight of the applauding audience.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">. . .We have just finished our
        last reading in Chicago; one of the greatest successes, if
        not the very greatest, artistic and pecuniary success of
        our season. The thermometer is 4 below and falling. The
        snow crunches and rings as though it were some powdered
        metal.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">Ah! what an effect we did have tonight. Clemens's story
        of Huck Finn &amp; Tom Sawyer liberating runaway [Jim] was
        received with a continual tempest of merriment, and when I
        gave "A Sound of Drums" I saw persons in tears all over the
        house. I was called back twice after my Creole songs and
        twice after "Mary's Night Ride." Mark &amp; I both seemed
        especially inspired tonight &amp; to inspire each other
        ...</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">... I have not told you about our evening in Burlington,
        Iowa. Clemens lingered behind at Keokuk to see his aged
        mother--from whose fine aged face he gets all his own best
        lines--and was to reach Burlington just in time for the
        reading. But the snow storm was tremendous, his train was
        dreadfully belated and I had to lift a stone-dead audience
        out of the grave, as it were, and put life &amp; mirth into
        them &amp; keep their spirits rising for an hour &amp; a
        half all alone. I did it, however, &amp; when Clemens came
        into the house at 9/35 my work was much more than done
        &amp; he had an enthusiasm to start on. I was proud of the
        job...</font></p>

        13.<i><a name="v" id="v">--Jan. 29,</a> 1885; Milwaukee</i>

        <p><font color="#330099">I have just come off the platform
        after reading "A Sound of Drums." Don't think I ever read
        it quite so well &amp; there seemed to be a profound
        effect; but somehow it didn't show itself in applause to
        the extent I thought it would. At least I was not called
        back. But indeed I don't often get the 1st encore; that
        generally falls to Mark; but once they begin they keep it
        up right through.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">Mark is on one of his best things
        now -- marked * on the back of this [the "King Sollermun"
        selection] &amp; will surely be called back. I hear the
        ladies laughing at the tops of their voices, &amp; whenever
        they do that the encore is certain to come. . .
        .</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">Now here is the strangest thing! A
        house full of people, seemingly highly entertained but
        feeble in their final applauses. Mark was not called back
        &amp; I, following, was so feebly encored that I did not
        feel justified in doing more than bowing. Fact is Mark is
        under a cloud tonight -- feels it, confesses it, but cannot
        explain it. He doesn't take hold of his hearers and swing
        them as usual. There! he gets it at last. Even now it came
        as a kind of after thought from the audience after they had
        entirely ceased clapping. But it came good and
        heartily.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">Strongest, heartiest kind of a
        reception to "Mary's Ride." Now Mark is on to finish; but I
        know he is going to come off wringing his hands with
        vexation. Fact is our hard railroad travel is telling on us
        -- has let out -- slackened -- our nerves. Queerly, but
        truly, we feel it most after a partial resting spell. . . .
        The clock strikes ten. The end is only a few moments away.
        <i>Finis.</i> Mark explains it all. He had a <i>warm
        bath</i> an hour before the reading. He'll never take
        another.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">I am reminded by something Mark is
        saying, of what a fine instinctive art he has for the
        platform. He has worked &amp; worked incessantly on these
        programmes until he has effected in all of them -- there
        are 3 -- a gradual growth of both interest &amp; humor so
        that the audience never has to find anything less, but
        always more, entertaining than what precedes it. He says,
        "I don't want them to get tired out laughing before we get
        to the end." The result is we have always a steady
        crescendo ending in a double climax. My insight into his
        careful, untiring, incessant labors are an education ...
        There! It does me good to hear them call him back at the
        place where the encores generally begin, instead of letting
        him go as they did in Milwaukee last night.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">Mark is telling one of his very
        best numbers &amp; the old surf-roar is booming. They will
        encore every number to the end.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">Ah! what a noble applause calls
        Mark back, continuing until he has returned entirely back
        across the broad platform to the footlights.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">Funny thing just now. I had been
        out &amp; sung two Creole songs &amp; on retiring the
        applause died down &amp; Mark in his nervous way stepping
        out on the platform a little too promptly was met by a
        patterning encore intended for the singer. It was awkward
        for him, but he was equal to the emergency. He stood still
        a moment, then said in the drollest way imaginable -- "I'll
        go back and get him" -- At which there was a roar of
        laughter &amp; applause in the midst of which he came back
        to make his word good. Of course I would not go, so he went
        back and raised another laugh, saying, "He's sung all he
        knows" -- and went on with "The Jumping Frog," which is
        getting a superb reception.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">In the matinee I had a hard time
        and did what I, at least, knew to be poor work; &amp; yet I
        had one pleasure; for, for the first time in my life, I
        heard an applause follow me off the platform that was
        entirely the clapping of ladies' hands. I never saw men so
        scarce in an audience before. The sound was very sweet to
        the ear of a weary, brainsick man.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">At night I feared I should not get
        through the performance at all; but, bless you, I hadn't
        been on the platform 2 minutes before I saw I was going to
        do the very best work; &amp; in fact did render Raoul's two
        scenes (in <i>The Grandissimes</i>) better than I'd ever
        done them before in my life. As to Mary's Ride the applause
        was tremendous. I saw one lady in the middle of the house
        sit &amp; cry all through it.</font></p>

        17.<i><a name="x" id="x">--Feb. 12,</a> 1885; en route
        between Oberlin &amp; Detroit</i>

        <p><font color="#330099">Strange to say I went to the work
        fresh &amp; bright &amp; from the very start did, by
        verdict of all, the finest evening's reading thus far in my
        experience. ... Clemens, on the contrary, found himself as
        heavy as lead--I mean in his own consciousness, and
        although the audience showed some heartiness of
        appreciation while he was before them, yet he came off
        disheartened, vexed &amp; full of lamentations over his
        condition.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">On my 2d number I instantly shot
        ahead of any rendering I have ever made of it. I was full
        of new inspirations, was interrupted early with applause,
        and when I came to where Ristofalo puts his arm around Kate
        they would not let me go any farther but drowned in
        applause my repeated efforts to proceed &amp; when I
        finally got the better of them &amp; went on, it was, so to
        speak, through breakers of laughter and applause
        ...</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">Clemens met me behind the door with pantomimic
        expressions of amazement &amp; was about to go on for his
        turn, when a rush of applause called me back. I went, but
        excused myself in an impromptu remark or two, as I wanted
        Mark to get back &amp; redeem himself without delay &amp;
        knew he as nearly sick to do so. As I came off once more I
        saw intense gratification on his face.--"That was the most
        gracefully said," he exclaimed, and went out on the
        platform.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">But still he rolled in the trough of the sea. The
        audience was greatly pleased--full of laughter; but I knew,
        even by their limited demonstration &amp; he knew most
        painfully that he was way below par. However, he was called
        back, told his drollest yarn, and captured them at last.
        But if I had been in bad condition, too, we should have had
        the dreariest night of the season.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">My songs were encored--There, now, I believe I'm wrong;
        I think Mark was not called back until after his 3d piece.
        He felt his deficiency the most distressingly because the
        previous night he had been nearly as bad. However, he began
        at length to rally. ...</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">In the midst of the story a comical thing occurred. At
        the point where the negro guide speaks his loud whispered
        goodbye to Mary &amp; the spy, saying "I feared you gwine
        fo'git it, boss," in the midst of the death-like stillness
        which always reigns throughout the house just then, a black
        man, sitting behind me in a sort of choir loft all alone
        &amp; in sight of every one, recognized the mimicked
        African enunciation and the old southern title of respect,
        let go a suppressed but loud titter of the purest Ethiopian
        character, and its character as well as its irrelevancy
        brought down the house. Yet it rather helped than hindered
        me, and when I came to the fierce thrilling end I knew by
        every symptom, both inward &amp; outward, that I had done
        the best bit of reading I had ever done in my life.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">In response to the encore I excused myself--Mark
        <i>never</i> objects to my declining an encore--&amp; read
        a little note that had come in while Mark was on the
        platform, asking him to read the story of the "Golden Arm."
        So then he came out and read it &amp; did it well &amp; was
        called back &amp; did another thing and did it his very
        best &amp; so the evening ended, and presently the retiring
        room was full of new friends.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#330099">. . . last night Mark &amp; I
        stood before an audience of about 3000 people in the
        beautiful Academy of Music here. It was the finest sight I
        have ever looked at from the platform. And I had great
        success. As to Mark his was not up to high water mark
        though -- excuse me, the pun was accidental -- he created
        much enthusiasm. I don't see what is the matter with him
        except that he seems tired out.</font></p>
