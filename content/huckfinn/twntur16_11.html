 &nbsp; Twain and Cable,&mdash;The audience that greeted these unique entertainers was not large, but it was an intelligent and discriminating one. Mr. Clemen's droll humor delivered in the funniest manner kept the audience in a constant giggle, and Mr. Cable's masterly delivery of striking extracts from his novel, "Dr. Sevier," held the hearers attention and carried them through the scenes of the imaginary recital. Mark Twain is a prime funny man and he is just as funny on the stage, in words, tones, gestures and attitudes, as he is in his books, and Mr. Cable is sure of being rated as an artiste in elocution as well as a fascinating novelist. The entertainment was undoubtedly greatly enjoyed by the people present, who were only sorry that it was not longer.<br /><br />
