<center><h3>A Trying Situation</h3></center>

<font size="+1">From <b><i>A Tramp Abroad</i></b>, Chapter XXV --</font><br /><br />

<p>The seven-thirty table d'hote at the great Schweitzerhof furnished a mighty array and variety of
nationalities, but it offered a better opportunity to observe costumes than people, for the
multitude sat at immensely long tables, and therefore the faces were mainly seen in perspective;
but the breakfasts were served at small round tables, and then if one had the fortune to get a table
in the midst of the assemblage he could have as many faces to study as he could desire. We used
to try to guess out the nationalities, and generally succeeded tolerably well. Sometimes we tried to
guess people's names; but that was a failure; that is a thing which probably requires a good deal of
practice. We presently dropped it and gave our efforts to less difficult particulars. One morning I
said:</p><p>

"There is an American party."</p><p>

Harris said:</p><p>

"Yes -- but name the state."</p><p>

I named one state, Harris named another. We agreed upon one thing, however -- that the young
girl with the party was very beautiful, and very tastefully dressed. But we disagreed as to her age.
I said she was eighteen, Harris said she was twenty. The dispute between us waxed warm, and I
finally said, with a pretense of being in earnest:</p><p>

"Well, there is one way to settle the matter -- I will go and ask her."</p><p>

Harris said, sarcastically, "Certainly, that is the thing to do. All you need to do is to use the
common formula over here: go and say, 'I'm an American!' Of course she will be glad to see
you."</p><p>

Then he hinted that perhaps there was no great danger of my venturing to speak to her. </p><p>

I said, "I was only talking -- I didn't intend to approach her, but I see that you do not know what
an intrepid person I am. I am not afraid of any woman that walks. I will go and speak to this
young girl."</p><p>

The thing I had in my mind was not difficult. I meant to address her in the most respectful way
and ask her to pardon me if her strong resemblance to a former acquaintance of mine was
deceiving me; and when she should reply that the name I mentioned was not the name she bore, I
meant to beg pardon again, most respectfully, and retire. There would be no harm done. I walked
to her table, bowed to the gentleman, then turned to her and was about to begin my little speech
when she exclaimed:</p><p>

"I <i>knew</i> I wasn't mistaken -- I told John it was you! John said it probably wasn't, but I
knew I was right. I said you would recognize me presently and come over; and I'm glad you did,
for I shouldn't have felt much flattered if you had gone out of this room without recognizing me.
Sit down, sit down -- how odd it is -- you are the last person I was ever expecting to see
again."</p><p>

This was a stupefying surprise. It took my wits clear away, for an instant. However, we shook
hands cordially all around, and I sat down. But truly this was the tightest place I ever was in. I
seemed to vaguely remember the girl's face, now, but I had no idea where I had seen it before, or
what named belonged with it. I immediately tried to get up a diversion about Swiss scenery, to
keep her from launching into topics that might betray that I did not know her, but it was of no
use, she went right along upon matters which interested her more:</p><p>

"Oh dear, what a night that was, when the sea washed the forward boats away -- do you
remember it?"</p><p>

"Oh, <i>don't</i> I!" said I -- but I didn't. I wished the sea had washed the rudder and the
smoke-stack and the captain away -- then I could have located this questioner. </p><p>

"And don't you remember how frightened poor Mary was, and how she cried?"</p><p>

"Indeed I do!" said I. "Dear me, how it all comes back!"</p><p>

I fervently wished it <i>would</i> come back -- but my memory was a blank. The wise way
would have been to frankly own up; but I could not bring myself to do that, after the young girl
had praised me so for recognizing her; so I went on, deeper and deeper into the mire, hoping for a
chance clue but never getting one. The Unrecognizable continued, with vivacity:</p><p>

"Do you know, George married Mary, after all?"</p><p>

"Why, no! Did he?"</p><p>

"Indeed he did. He said he did not believe she was half as much to blame as her father was, and I
thought he was right. Didn't you?"</p><p>

"Of course he was. It was a perfectly plain case. I always said so."</p><p>

"Why, no you didn't! -- at least that summer."</p><p>

"Oh, no, not that summer. No, you are perfectly right about that. It was the following winter that
I said it."</p><p>

"Well, as it turned out, Mary was not in the least to blame -- it was all her father's fault -- at least
his and old Darley's."</p><p>

It was necessary to say something -- so I said:</p><p>

"I always regarded Darley as a troublesome old thing."</p><p>

"So he was, but then they always had a great affection for him, although he had so many
eccentricities. You remember that when the weather was the least cold, he would try to come into
the house."</p><p>

I was rather afraid to proceed. Evidently Darley was not a man -- he must be some other kind of
animal -- possibly a dog, maybe an elephant. However, tails are common to all animals, so I
ventured to say:</p><p>

"And what a tail he had!"</p><p>

"<i>One</i>! He had a thousand!"</p><p>

This was bewildering. I did not quite know what to say, so I only said:</p><p>

"Yes, he <i>was</i> rather well fixed in the matter of tails."</p><p>

"For a negro, and a crazy one at that, I should say he was," said she. </p><p>

It was getting pretty sultry for me. I said to myself, "Is it possible she is going to stop there, and
wait for me to speak? If she does, the conversation is blocked. A negro with a thousand tails is a
topic which a person cannot talk upon fluently and instructively without more or less preparation.
As to diving rashly into such a vast subject --"</p><p>

But here, to my gratitude, she interrupted my thoughts by saying:</p><p>

"Yes, when it came to tales of his crazy woes, there was simply no end to them if anybody would
listen. His own quarters were comfortable enough, but when the weather was cold, the family
were sure to have his company -- nothing could keep him out of the house. But they always bore
it kindly because he had saved Tom's life, years before. You remember Tom?</p><p>

"Oh, perfectly. Fine fellow he was, too."</p><p>

"Yes he was. And what a pretty little thing his child was!"</p><p>

"You may well say that. I never saw a prettier child."</p><p>


"I used to delight to pet it and dandle it and play with it."</p><p>

"So did I."</p><p>

"You named it. What <i>was</i> that name? I can't call it to mind."</p><p>

It appeared to me that the ice was getting pretty thin, here. I would have given something to
know what the child's sex was. However, I had the good luck to think of a name that would fit either
sex -- so I brought it out:</p><p>

"I named it Frances."</p><p>

"From a relative, I suppose? But you named the one that died, too -- one that I never saw. What
did you call that one?"</p><p>

I was out of neutral names, but as the child was dead and she had never seen it, I thought I might
risk a name for it and trust to luck. Therefore I said:</p><p>

"I called that one Thomas Henry."</p><p>

She said, musingly:</p><p>

"That is very singular . . . very singular."</p><p>

I sat still and let the cold sweat run down. I was in a good deal of trouble, but I believed I could
worry through if she wouldn't ask me to name any more children. I wondered where the lightning
was going to strike next. She was still ruminating over that last child's title, but presently she
said:</p><p>

"I have always been sorry you were away at the time -- I would have had you name my
child."</p><p>

"<i>Your</i> child! Are you married?"</p><p>

"I have been married thirteen years."</p><p>

"Christened, you mean."</p><p>

'"No, married. The youth by your side is my son."</p><p>

"It seems incredible -- even impossible. I do not mean any harm by it, but would you mind telling
me if you are any over eighteen? -- that is to say, will you tell me how old you are?"</p><p>

"I was just nineteen the day of the storm we were talking about. That was my birthday."</p><p>


That did not help matters, much, as I did not know the date of the storm. I tried to think of some
non-committal thing to say, to keep up my end of the talk, and render my poverty in the matter of
reminiscences as little noticeable as possible, but I seemed to be about out of non-committal
things. I was about to say, "You haven't changed a bit since then" -- but that was risky. I thought
of saying, "You have improved ever so much since then" -- but that wouldn't answer, of course. I
was about to try a shy at the weather, for a saving change, when the girl slipped in ahead of me
and said:</p><p>

"How I have enjoyed this talk over those happy old times -- haven't you?"</p><p>

"I never have spent such a half-hour in all my life before!" said I, with emotion; and I could have
added, with a near approach to truth, "and I would rather be scalped than spend another one like
it." I was holily grateful to be through with the ordeal, and was about to make my good-bys and
get out, when the girl said:</p><p>

"But there is one thing that is ever so puzzling to me."</p><p>

"Why, what is that?"</p><p>

"That dead child's name. What did you say it was?"</p><p>

Here was another balmy place to be in: I had forgotten the child's name; I hadn't imagined it
would be needed again. However, I had to pretend to know, anyway, so I said:</p><p>

"Joseph William."</p><p>

The youth at my side corrected me, and said:</p><p>

"No, Thomas Henry."</p><p>

I thanked him -- in words -- and said, with trepidation:</p><p>

"O yes -- I was thinking of another child that I named -- I have named a great many, and I get
them confused -- this one was named Henry Thompson --"</p><p>

"Thomas Henry," calmly interposed the boy. </p><p>

I thanked him again -- strictly in words -- and stammered out:</p><p>

"Thomas Henry -- yes, Thomas Henry was the poor child's name. I named him for Thomas -- er --
Thomas Carlyle, the great author, you know -- and Henry -- er -- er -- Henry the Eighth. The
parents were very grateful to have a child named Thomas Henry."</p><p>

"That makes it more singular than ever," murmured my beautiful friend. </p><p>


"Does it? Why?"</p><p>

"Because when the parents speak of that child now, they always call it Susan Amelia."</p><p>

That spiked my gun. I could not say anything. I was entirely out of verbal obliquities; to go
further would be to lie, and that I would not do; so I simply sat still and suffered -- sat mutely and
resignedly there, and sizzled -- for I was being slowly fried to death in my own blushes. Presently
the enemy laughed a happy laugh and said:</p><p>

"I <i>have</i> enjoyed this talk over old times, but you have not. I saw very soon that you were
only pretending to know me, and so as I had wasted a compliment on you in the beginning, I
made up my mind to punish you. And I have succeeded pretty well. I was glad to see that you
knew George and Tom and Darley, for I had never heard of them before and therefore could not
be sure that you had; and I was glad to learn the names of those imaginary children, too. One can
get quite a fund of information out of you if one goes at it cleverly. Mary and the storm, and the
sweeping away of the forward boats, were facts -- all the rest was fiction. Mary was my sister; her
full name was Mary------. <i>Now</i> do you remember me?"</p><p>

"Yes," I said, "I do remember you now; and you are as hard-hearted as you were thirteen years
ago in that ship, else you wouldn't have punished me so. You haven't changed your nature nor your
person, in any way at all; you look as young as you did then, you are just as beautiful as you were
then, and you have transmitted a deal of your comeliness to this fine boy. There -- if that speech
moves you any, let's fly the flag of truce, with the understanding that I am conquered and confess
it."</p>
