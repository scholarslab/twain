          [<i>Here, excerpted from Arlin Turner's</i> Mark Twain
          &amp; George Washington Cable<i>, is a sampling of what
          Cable wrote to Louise about the reaction his essay had
          provoked, as it intersected with the "Twins of Genius"
          tour.</i>]
        </blockquote>--<b>from Cincinnati, 4 January 1885</b><br />
        "I have some noble letters from persons who have read my
        Freedman paper."

        --<b>from Louisville, 7 January 1885</b><br />
        "[<i>After visiting the city's high schools, including the
        'Colored High School'</i>] at 2 P.M. got back to the hotel
        with barely time to eat before the hour for receiving a
        delegation of colored men coming to thank me for my
        'Freedman's Case in Equity.'<br />
        "They came at 3 -- yellow, black, brown, yellow, brown
        &amp; black, seven or eight in number. After a grand
        shake-hands they all sat down &amp; one -- the blackest --
        rose &amp; made a formal impromptu address of thanks that
        made [it] hard for me to hold down my feelings. I replied;
        there was some conversation &amp; they rose to go. You
        would not have got off with dry eyes had you been there.
        One said, 'Good-bye, my hero of heroes.' I thought of the
        great dead -- Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips &amp; the
        rest and felt ashamed to let them give such praise to me."
        <hr width="20%" />
        --<b>from Chicago, 17 January 1885</b><br />
        "The matinee, today, was delightful. Among those who came
        into the retiring room were an old gentleman and lady who
        introduced themselves as Mr. &amp; Mrs. Hammond. The lady
        was a sister of Owen Lovejoy, the Alton martyr. The old
        gentleman began -- 'Mr. Cable I came to thank you for your
        paper on the Freedman' -- and there choked, burst into
        tears and could not speak. His wife tried &amp; made the
        same failure.<br />
        "I wish you could see my table -- covered with letters full
        of tender expressions of gratitude and admiration from
        white men &amp; black men. That paper is turning out to be
        the greatest thing I've ever done."
        <hr width="20%" />
        --<b>from Milwaukee, 29 January 1885</b><br />
        "Well, well, what a profound impression my Freedman paper
        has made. Men come &amp; say 'we are Democrats, but you
        have told everything so plainly &amp; convincingly that we
        see the whole thing in a new light.' And they come &amp;
        continue to come. Two newspapers interviewed me on the
        subject today."
        <hr width="20%" />
        --<b>from Delaware, 10 February 1885</b><br />
        "I had a good time today. Went to see Gov. Hoadly. He was
        ever so cordial. We drew up chairs &amp; sat around the
        fire, he, his sect'y, the Att'y Gen'l (if I understood
        aright) and I. He is, you know, one of the national leaders
        of the Democracy; and yet he hastened to say at once that
        he knew my utterances on the Freedman question &amp; was
        with me entirely. It was, to me, one of the most comforting
        &amp; encouraging hours I have spent in many a long
        day.<br />
        "Later, he came to see us, Mark &amp; [me], but mainly, I
        think, Mark; &amp; we spent another pleasant time. He gave
        me several points to use against my Bourbon friends down in
        Louisiana &amp; Georgia."
