    <h3>Narcisse in the Inundation</h3>
  </center><font size="+1">From <b><i>Dr. Sevier</i></b>, Chapter
  XVI --</font>

  <p>As the day faded away it began to rain. The next morning the
  water was coming down in torrents. Richling, looking out from a
  door in Prieur street, found scant room for one foot on the inner
  edge of the sidewalk; all the rest was under water. By noon the
  sidewalks were completely covered in miles of streets. By two in
  the afternoon the flood was coming into many of the houses. By
  three it was up at the door-sill on which he stood. There it
  stopped.</p>

  <p>He could do nothing but stand and look. Skiffs, canoes,
  hastily improvised rafts, were moving in every direction,
  carrying the unsightly chattels of the poor out of their
  overflowed cottages to higher ground. Barrels, boxes, planks,
  hen-coops, bridge lumber, piles of straw that waltzed solemnly as
  they went, cord-wood, old shingles, door-steps, floated here and
  there in melancholy confusion; and down upon all still drizzled
  the slackening rain. At length it ceased.</p>

  <p>Richling still stood in the door-way, the picture of mute
  helplessness. Yes, there was one other thing he could do; he
  could laugh. It would have been hard to avoid it sometimes, there
  were such ludicrous sights, -- such slips and sprawls into the
  water; so there he stood in the peculiar isolation that deaf
  people content themselves with, now looking the picture of
  anxious waiting, now indulging a low, deaf man's chuckle when
  something made the rowdies and slattens of the street roar.</p>

  <p>Presently he noticed, at a distance up the way, a young man in
  a canoe, passing, much to their good-natured chagrin, a party of
  three in a skiff, who had engaged him in a trial of speed. From
  both boats a shower of hilarious French was issuing. At the
  nearest corner the skiff party turned into another street and
  disappeared, throwing their lingual fireworks to the last. The
  canoe came straight on with the speed of a fish. Its dextrous
  occupant was no other than Narcisse.</p>

  <p>There was a grace in his movement that kept Richling's eyes on
  him, when he would rather have withdrawn into the house. Down
  went the paddle always on the same side, noiselessly, in front;
  on darted the canoe; backward stretched the submerged paddle and
  came out of the water edgewise at full reach behind, with an
  almost imperceptible swerving motion that kept the slender craft
  true to its course. No rocking; no rush of water before or
  behind; only the one constant glassy ripple gliding on either
  side as silently as a beam of light. Suddenly, without any
  apparent change of movement in the sinewy wrists, the narrow
  shell swept around in a quarter circle, and Narcisse sat face to
  face with Richling.</p>

  <p>Each smiled brightly at the other. The handsome Creole's face
  was aglow with the pure delight of existence.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mistoo Itchlin, 'ow you enjoyin' that watah? As fah as
  myseff am concerned, 'I am afloat, I am afloat on the fee-us
  'olling tide.' I don't think you fine that stweet pwetty dusty
  to-day, Mistoo Itchlin?"</p>

  <p>Richling laughed.</p>

  <p>"It don't inflame my eyes to-day," he said.</p>

  <p>"You muz egscuse my i'ony, Mistoo Itchlin; I can't 'ep that
  sometime'. It come natu'al to me, in fact. I was on'y speaking
  i'oniously juz now in calling allusion to that dust; because, of
  co'se, theh is no dust to-day, because the g'ound is all covvud
  with watah, in fact. Some people don't understand that figgah of
  i'ony."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand as much about it myself as I'd like to,"
  said Richling.</p>

  <p>"Me, I'm ve'y fon' of it," responded the Creole. "I was making
  seve'al i'onies ad those fwen' of mine juz now. We was 'unning a
  'ace. An' thass anotheh thing I am fon' of. I would 'ather 'un a
  'ace than to wuck faw a livin'. Ha! ha! ha! I should thing so!
  Anybody would, in fact. But thass the way with me -- always
  making some i'onies." He stopped with a sudden change of
  countenance, and resumed gravely: "Mistoo Itchlin, looks to me
  like you' lookin' ve'y salad." He fanned himself with his hat. "I
  dunno 'ow 'tis with you, Mistoo Itchlin, but I fine myseff ve'y
  oppwessive thiz evening."</p>

  <p>"I don't find you so," said Richling, smiling broadly.</p>

  <p>And he did not. The young Creole's burning face and
  resplendent wit were a sunset glow in the darkness of this day of
  overpowering adversity. His presence even supplied, for a moment,
  what seemed a gleam of hope. Why wasn't there here an opportunity
  to visit the hospital? He need not tell Narcisse the object of
  his visit.</p>

  <p>"Do you think," asked Richling, persuasively, crouching down
  upon one of his heels, "that I could sit in that thing without
  turning it over?"</p>

  <p>"In that pee-ogue?" Narcisse smiled the smile of the
  proficient as he waved his paddle across the canoe. "Mistoo
  Itchlin," -- the smile passed off, -- "I dunno if you'll billiv
  me, but at the same time I muz tell you the tooth?" --</p>

  <p>He paused inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Richling, with evident disappointment.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's juz a poss'bil'ty that you'll wefwain fum spillin'
  out fum yeh till the negs cawneh. Thass the manneh of those who
  ah not acquainted with the pee-ogue. 'Lost to sight, to memo'y
  deah' -- if you'll egscuse the maxim. Thass Chawles Dickens mague
  use of that egspwession."</p>

  <p>Richling answered with a gay shake of the head. "I'll keep out
  of it." If Narcisse detected his mortified chagrin, he did not
  seem to. It was hard; the day's last hope was blown out like a
  candle in the wind. Richling dared not risk the wetting of his
  suit of clothes; they were his sole letter of recommendation and
  capital in trade.</p>

  <p>"Well, <i>au 'evoi'</i>, Mistoo Itchlin." He turned and moved
  off -- dip, glide, and away.</p>
