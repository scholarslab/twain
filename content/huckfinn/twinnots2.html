<font size="+1"><i><b>Louisville Courier-Journal</b></i>, 2 January 1885:</font><br />

<p>J<font size="-1">UDGING</font> from the first day's sale of seats, it is evident that Mark Twain
and Geo. W. Cable will have as large audiences here as the two gentlemen have met with
wherever they have been.  The box-office is at Tripp's music store.</p>

<center><b>Twain and Cable.</b></center>
<p>The most popular humorous writer in the English language, Mark Twain, and the distinguished
Southern novelist, Mr. George W. Cable, will appear to-morrow and Tuesday evenings at
Liederkranz Hall, both giving readings from their own works.  Such a treat as this will certainly
test the capacity of the hall, and this being Mark Twain's first appearance here, a hearty welcome
is assured him.  The programme will be published in full in to-morrow's issue of the C<font
size="-1">OURIER</font>-J<font size="-1">OURNAL</font> The prices of admission will remain
fifty and seventy-five cents, reserved seats $1.  They can be secured at Mrs. Tripp's music store,
Fourth avenue.  The following, regarding their entertainment, is from the Boston <i>Daily
Evening Traveller</i>: "There could have been no further additions to the audience at Music Hall
last evening without positive discomfort to those already within the doors.  The names of Mark
Twain (Samuel L. Clemens) and George W. Cable were of sufficient drawing power to bring
together the largest kind of a company.  The occasion was the simple announcement that Messrs.
Clemens and Cable would give readings of their own works.  And they did; and it was the funniest
night that had been passed by the majority of the audience for a long time.  The two entertaining
gentlemen kept their auditors in an uproar pretty much all the while.  It was either laughter or
applause well-nigh continuously, sufficient silence being given only for the passage of the words."
Of Mark Twain, this paper says: "Mark Twain is his companion's opposite in every particular.
The latter is small and graceful; Twain tall and awkward.  His gestures are few and meaningless,
and he does not smile when uttering jokes that almost put his audience in convulsions.  His great
head of hair, once glossy black, is now an iron gray; and his bushy moustache jutting out over his
queer mouth is also streaked with white.  While he audience was roaring with laughter, he simply
pulled his moustache and scowled.  Sentences and phrases that, emanating from other lips, would
seem dull and commonplace, prove paroxysms of mirth when uttered by him.  As a reader he is
far outside of any conventional rule, but coming from his own lips his lines gather and convey
many new and charming meanings.  The laughter that greeted his first appearance attended him to
the last."  Mr. Cable's delightful readings when here last season have not been forgotten.  He is as
gifted a reader as he is a writer, and has made a host of friends in this city.</p>

<center><b>The Cable and Twain Readings.</b></center>
<p>Mark Twain and George W. Cable read this and to-morrow evening at Liederkranz Hall.  They
have been taking the country by storm, and there is no doubt that they will be warmly received in
Louisville.  It would be difficult to find two men who could cover a larger field in an
entertainment composed of selections from their own writings than do Mark Twain and Cable.
Mr. Cable's delightful readings here last spring are remembered with much pleasure, and those
who heard him then will certainly do so again.  Mark Twain has never been in Louisville in the
flesh, but he is in every house in the land in spirit, and he needs no introduction to any public in
America.  He is as much Mark Twain on the rostrum as he is in his books.</p>
<p>The following is the programme for this evening:</p>
