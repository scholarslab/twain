<br />
 &nbsp; Mark Twain and George W. Cable gave readings last evening in Chickering Hall to
an audience which filled every seat.  It was difficult to surmise from a glance over the
sea of faces who had paid to laugh and who to listen to Mr. Cable's descriptions.  Mr.
Cable's four readings were from his novel of "Dr. Sevier."<br /><br />

 &nbsp; Instead of readings, his performances were recitations, delivered with intensity
that apparently made the author oblivious to everything save his effort to body forth
the pictures in his mind.  An elocutionist would find small praise for his gestures, and
frequently the wrong word was used by mistake. Yet Mr. Cable was cheered heartily at the
close of his first recitation, in which he had assumed the characters of Narcisse and John
and Mary Richling.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; When Mark Twain walked on the stage, with his chin recently shaved and perceptibly
powdered for the occasion, his unruly hair like a halo around his head, and his discouraged
expression of countenance, he was welcomed with a prolonged clapping of hands.  Without
apparently recovering his spirits, he sauntered to the reading desk, felt for it with his
right hand, found it, and began.<br /><br />

<blockquote> &nbsp; It is eight or nine years since I bade good-by forever to the lecture
platform in this very hall.  Since that time some things sad and some things joyous have
happened to us all, to the country, and to all the nations of the earth.  I will not stop
now to enumerate them.  They say lecturers and burglars never reform.  I don't know how
it is with burglars--it is now so long since I had intimate relations with those
people--but it is quite true of lecturers.  They never reform. Lecturers and readers say
they are going to leave the platform never to return.  They mean it, they mean it.  But
there comes in time an overpowering temptation to come out on the platform and give
truth and morality one more lift.  You can't resist.</blockquote>

<blockquote> &nbsp; I got permanently through eight or nine years ago.  I may quit again.
 I never knew but one lecturer to refuse persistently to return to the platform.  "I
shall leave you now forever," this remarkable man said with emotion. "This is my last
appearance, positively my last."  It was his last appearance, but it was no merit for
him.  Such merit as there was belonged entirely to the Sheriff.</blockquote>

 &nbsp; Mr. Twain has the habit of looking down sidewise into the middle of the desk on
which he is leaning, while laughter in the audience continues.  The bored and somewhat
lugubrious expression he wears was slightly shaken by a twitching under his moustache,
while only the profile of his face was presented to the audience.  Then he turned and
added:<br /><br />

<blockquote> &nbsp; Well, there's no telling.  I'll make no more promises.  Now I'll
begin business and give a short chapter from my new novel, "Huckleberry Finn."</blockquote>

 &nbsp; His left hand sought the old familiar pantaloons pocket and stayed there, while he
leaned against the reading desk with his other arm on it, and proceeded in his
conversational, slow, nasal drawl.  It was in the Mississippi Valley.  Huck Finn, a white
boy, and Nigger Jim ran away from the plantation and camped out, and they got to talking
about kings one evening.  Jim being told what fine clothes they wear, had his curiosity
aroused, and he asked if there were many of 'em.  Oh, yes, Huck replied.  There was
Sollymun.  Jim had heard of him, but he wanted to know more about kings generally.  How
much did they get?  What!  $1,000 a month?  Wasn't that gay, and what did they do for it?
Huck said they did nothing but lay around.  Sometimes they went to war, but as a general
thing they just hung around the harem.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; "'Round de what?" asked Jim.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; "The harem," rejoined Huck.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; "What's dat?"<br /><br />

 &nbsp; "Don't you know Sollymun had one?  He had a million wives."<br /><br />

 &nbsp; Nigger Jim had never thought of that before, and he proceeded to argue that
Solomon could not have been a wise man, because he would have had to build himself
a room of boiler iron and shut himself in occasionally, where he could get a little rest.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; At his next appearing Twain pitched into the German language again.  He has had
a standing quarrel with it since he went to Germany.  While in Heidelburg he met with a
fellow sufferer, an American student, who cursed the intricacies of the declension of
German adjectives as heartily as he did.  He was a dissipated chap, and he always would
rather decline two drinks than one German adjective.  Then Twain read an anecdote he had
constructed in English to show the nonsense of mixing up the genders, and concluded with
the remark that when the fellow who made the German language tried again, he should invent
a language with one good, square, responsible sex--a language that wouldn't call the fish
"he," the scales "she," and the fishwife "it."<br /><br />

 &nbsp; Mr. Cable for a recall sang "Brave Boys Are They" in a light baritone voice.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; Mr. Twain appeared surprised when he appeared for the last event on the programme.
"I didn't expect," he said reproachfully, "to see you here yet.  Perhaps you don't know
how late it's growing."<br /><br />

 &nbsp; Then he told a ghost story, first advising the nervous people to go home.  The
story was about a woman with a golden arm who died and was buried, but whose husband
concluded afterward to save the arm, and dug it up.  In a night of tempest which followed
a low steam-whistle whisper chased the man around inquiring: "Who-o-o-o-'s got my
go-o-o-olden arm?"  He locked himself in his room and went to bed.  Pat, pat, came a light
foot up the stairs and through the locked door and up to the bed and the soft
steam-whistle whisper sighed in his ear: "Who-o-o-o-'s got my
go-o-o-olden arm?"<br /><br />

 &nbsp; Mr. Twain at this point jumped up two feet in the air and came down with a bang
shouting "Nobody!"  Everybody else jumped too.<br />
