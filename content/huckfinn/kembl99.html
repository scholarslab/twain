<title>Kemble's 1899 versions of Jim</title>

<p>In its 10 December 1899 issue, the <i>World</i> did a multi-page tribute to MT, which included a full-page spread depicting his most famous characters and books.  The drawings were specially commissioned, and the paper turned to Kemble to do the illustrations for <i>Huck</i> as a matter of course.  Here is his response.  [It's also worth reading the brief summary of the novel, to note that Jim's fate as a human being is not treated any more seriously there.]</p>
