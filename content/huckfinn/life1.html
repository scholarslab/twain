<p>
Mark Twain is a humorist or nothing. He is well aware of the fact himself, for he prefaces the "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" with a brief notice, warning persons in search of a moral, motive or plot that they are liable to be prosecuted, banished or shot. This is a nice little artifice to scare off the critics--a kind of "trespassers on these grounds will be dealt with according to law." </p>
<p>However, as there is no penalty attached, we organized a search expedition for the humorous qualities of this book with the following hilarious results:</p>
<p>A very refined and delicate piece of narration by Huck Finn, describing his venerable and dilapidated "pap" as afflicted with delirium tremens, rolling over and over, "kicking things every which way," and "saying there are devils ahold of him." This chapter is especially suited to amuse the children on long, rainy afternoons.
</p><p>An elevating and laughable description of how Huck killed a pig, smeared its blood on an axe and mixed in a little of his own hair, and then ran off, setting up a job on the old man and the community, and leading them to believe him murdered. This little joke can be repeated by any smart boy for the amusement of his fond parents.
</p><p>A graphic and romantic tale of a Southern family feud, which resulted in an elopement and from six to eight choice corpses.
</p><p>A polite version of the "Giascutus" story, in which a nude man, striped with the colors of the rainbow, is exhibited as "The King's Camelopard; or, The Royal Nonesuch." This is a chapter for lenten parlor entertainments and church festivals.
</p><p>A side-splitting account of a funeral, enlivened by a "sick melodeun," a "long-legged undertaker," and a rat episode in the cellar. </p>
