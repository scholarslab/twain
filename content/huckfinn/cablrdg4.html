          <h3>Kate Riley, Richling &amp; Ristofalo</h3>
        </center><font size="+1">From <b><i>Dr. Sevier</i></b>,
        Chapter XXXV--</font>

        <p>"Well, Mr. Richlin'!" cried Mrs. Riley, as she opened
        her parlor door in response to a knock. "Well, I'll be
        switched! Ha! ha! I didn't think it was you at all. Take a
        seat and sit down!"</p>

        <p>It was good to see how she enjoyed the visit. Whenever
        she listened to Richling's words she rocked in her
        rocking-chair vigorously, and when she spoke stopped its
        motion and rested her elbows on its arms.</p>

        <p>"And how <i>is</i> Mrs. Richlin'? And so she sent her
        love to me, did she, now? The blessed angel! Now, ye're not
        just a-makin' that up? No, I know ye wouldn't do sich a
        thing as that, Mr. Richlin'. Well, you must give her mine
        back again. I've nobody else on e'rth to give ud to, and
        never will have." She lifted her nose with amiable
        stateliness, as if to imply that Richling might not believe
        this, but that it was true, nevertheless.</p>

        <p>"You may change your mind, Mrs. Riley, some day,"
        returned Richling, a little archly.</p>

        <p>"Ha! ha!" She tossed her head and laughed with
        good-natured scorn. "Nivver a fear o' that, Mr. Richlin'!"
        Her brogue was apt to broaden when pleasure pulled down her
        dignity. "And, if I didn, it wuddent be for the likes of no
        I-talian Dago, if id's him ye're a-dthrivin' at, -- not
        intinding anny disrespect to your friend, Mr. Richlin', and
        indeed I don't deny he's a perfect gintleman, -- but,
        indeed, Mr. Richlin', I'm just after thinkin' that you and
        your lady wouldn't have to self-respect for Kate Riley if
        she should be changing her name."</p>

        <p>"Still you were thinking about it," said Richling with a
        twinkle.</p>

        <p>"Ah! ha! ha! Indeed I wasn', an' ye needn' be t'rowin'
        anny o' yer slyness on me. Ye know ye'd have no
        self-respect fur me. No; now ye know ye wuddent, -- wud
        ye?"</p>

        <p>"Why, Mrs. Riley, of course we would. Why -- why not?"
        He stood in the door-way, about to take his leave. "You may
        be sure we'll always be glad of anything that will make you
        the happier." Mrs. Riley looked so grave that he checked
        his humor.</p>

        <p>"But in the nixt life, Mr. Ritchlin', how about
        that?"</p>

        <p>"There? I suppose we shall simply each love all in
        absolute perfection. We'll --"</p>

        <p>"We'll never know the differ," interposed Mrs.
        Riley.</p>

        <p>"That's it," said Richling, smiling again. "And so I
        say, -- and I've always said, -- if a person <i>feels</i>
        like marrying again, let him do it."</p>

        <p>"Have ye, now? Well, ye're just that good, Mr.
        Richlin'."</p>

        <p>"Yes," he responded, trying to be grave, "that's about
        my measure."</p>

        <p>"Would <i>you</i> do ut?"</p>

        <p>"No, I wouldn't. I couldn't. But I should like -- in
        good earnest, Mrs. Riley, I should like, now, the comfort
        of knowing that you were not to pass all the rest of your
        days in widowhood."</p>

        <p>"Ah! ged out, Mr. Richlin'!" She failed in her effort to
        laugh. "Ah! ye're sly!" She changed her attitude and drew a
        breath.</p>

        <p>"No," said Richling, "no, honestly. I should feel that
        you deserved better at this world's hands than that, and
        that the world deserved better of you. I find two people
        don't make a world, Mrs. Riley, though often they think
        they do. They certainly don't when one is gone." . . .</p>

        <p>"Marridge is a lottery, Mr. Richlin'; indeed an' it is;
        and ye know mighty well that he ye're after joking me about
        is no more nor a fri'nd." She looked sweet enough for
        somebody to kiss.</p>

        <p>"I don't know so certainly about that," said her
        visitor, stepping down upon the sidewalk and putting on his
        hat. "If I may judge by" -- He paused and glanced at the
        window.</p>

        <p>"Ah, now, Mr. Richlin', na-na-now, Mr. Richlin', ye
        daurn't say ud! Ye daurn't!" She smiled and blushed and
        arched her neck and rose and sank upon herself with sweet
        delight.</p>

        <p>"I say if I may judge by what he has said to me,"
        insisted Richling.</p>

        <p>Mrs. Riley glided down across the door-step, and, with
        all the insinuation of her sex and nation, demanded: --</p>

        <p>"What'd he tell ye? Ah! he didn't tell ye nawthing! Ha,
        ha! there wasn' nawthing to tell!" But Richling slipped
        away.</p>

        <p>Mrs. Riley shook her finger. "Ah, ye're a wicket joker,
        Mr. Richlin'. I didn't think that o' the linkes of a
        gintleman like you, anyhow!" She shook her finger again as
        she withdrew into the house, smiling broadly all the way in
        to the cradle, where she kissed and kissed again her ruddy,
        chubby, sleeping boy.</p>

        <p><br />
        <br />
        Ristofalo came often. He was a man of simple words, and of
        few thoughts of the kind that were available in
        conversation; but his personal adventures had begun almost
        with infancy, and followed one another in close and strange
        succession over lands and seas ever since. He could
        therefore talk best about himself, though he talked
        modestly. "These things to hear would Desdemona seriously
        incline," and there came times when even a tear was not
        wanting to gem the poetry of the situation.</p>

        <p>"And ye might have saved yerself from all that," was
        sometimes her note of sympathy. But when he asked how she
        silently dried her eyes.</p>

        <p>Sometimes his experiences had been intensely ludicrous,
        and Mrs. Riley would laugh until in pure self-oblivion she
        smote her thigh with her palm, or laid her hand so smartly
        against his shoulder as to tip him half off his seat.</p>

        <p>"Ye didn't!"</p>

        <p>"Yes."</p>

        <p>"Ah! Get out wid ye, Raphael Ristofalo, -- to be telling
        me that for the trooth!"</p>

        <p>At one such time she was about to give him a second
        push, but he took the hand in his, and quietly kept it to
        the end of the story.</p>

        <p>He lingered late that evening, but at length took his
        hat from under his chair, rose, and extended his hand.</p>

        <p>"Man alive!" she cried, "that's <i>my</i> hand, sur, I'd
        have ye to know. Begahn wid ye! Lookut heere! What's the
        reason ye make it so long atween yer visits, eh? Tell me
        that. Ah -- ah -- ye've no need fur to tell me, Mr.
        Ristofalo! Ah -- now don't tell a lie!"</p>

        <p>"Too busy. Come all time --wasn't too busy."</p>

        <p>"Ha, ha! Yes, yes; ye're too busy. Of coorse ye're too
        busy. Oh, yes! ye <i>air</i> too busy -- a-courtin' thim
        I'talian froot gerls around the Frinch Mairket. Ah! I'll
        bet two bits ye're a bouncer! Ah, don't tell me. I know ye,
        ye villain! Some o' thim's a-waitin' fur ye now, ha, ha!
        Go! And don't ye nivver come back heere anny more. D'ye
        mind?"</p>

        <p>"Aw righ'." The Italian took her hand for the third time
        and held it, standing in his simple square way before her
        and wearing his gentle smile as he looked her in the eye.
        "Good-by, Kate."</p>

        <p>Her eye quailed. Her hand pulled a little helplessly,
        and in a meek voice she said: --</p>

        <p>"That's not right for you to do me that a-way, Mr.
        Ristofalo. I've got a handle to my name, sur."</p>

        <p>She threw some gentle rebuke into her glance, and turned
        it upon him. He met it with that same amiable absence of
        emotion that was always in his look.</p>

        <p>"Kate too short by itself?" he asked. "Aw righ'; make it
        Kate Ristofalo."</p>

        <p>"No," said Mrs. Riley, averting and drooping her
        face.</p>

        <p>"Take good care of you," said the Italian; "you and
        Mike. Always be kind. Good care."</p>

        <p>Mrs. Riley turned with sudden fervor.</p>

        <p>"Good cayre! -- Mr. Ristofalo," she exclaimed, lifting
        her free hand and touching her bosom with the points of her
        fingers, "ye don't know the hairt of a woman, surr! No-o-o,
        surr! It's <i>love</i> we wants! 'The hairt as has trooly
        loved nivver furgits, but as trooly loves ahn to the
        tlose!'"</p>

        <p>"Yes," said the Italian; "yes," nodding and ever
        smiling, "dass aw righ'."</p>

        <p>But she: --</p>

        <p>"Ah! it's no use for you to be a-talkin' an'
        a-pallaverin' to Kate Riley when ye don't be lovin' her,
        Mr. Ristofalo, an' ye know ye don't."</p>

        <p>A tear glistened in her eye.</p>

        <p>"Yes, love you," said the Italian; "course, love
        you."</p>

        <p>He did not move a foot or change the expression of a
        feature.</p>

        <p>"H-yes!" said the widow. "H-yes!" she panted. "H-yes, a
        little! A little, Mr. Ristofalo! But I want" -- she pressed
        her hand hard upon her bosom, and raised her eyes aloft --
        "I want to be -- h -- h -- h-adaured above all the
        e'rth!"</p>

        <p>"Aw righ'," said Ristofalo; "das aw righ'; yes -- door
        above all you worth."</p>

        <p>"Raphael Ristofalo," she said, "ye're a-deceivin' me! Ye
        came heere whin nobody axed ye, -- an' that ye know is a
        fact, surr, -- an' made yerself agree'ble to a poor,
        unsuspectin' widdah, an' [<i>tears</i>] rabbed me o' mie
        hairt, ye did; whin I nivver intinded to git married
        ag'in."</p>

        <p>"Don't cry, Kate -- Kate Ristofalo," quietly observed
        the Italian, getting an arm around her waist, and laying a
        hand on the farther cheek. "Kate Ristofalo."</p>

        <p>"Shut!" she exclaimed, turning with playful fierceness,
        and proudly drawing back her head; "shut! Hah! It's Kate
        Ristofalo, is it? Ah, ye think so? Hah-h! It'll be ad least
        two weeks before the priest will be after giving you the
        right to call me that!"</p>

        <p>And, in fact, an entire fortnight did pass before they
        were married.</p>
