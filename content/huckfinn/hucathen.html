<p>
For some time past Mr. Clemens has been carried away by the
ambition of seriousness and fine writing. In <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>
he returns to his right mind, and is again the Mark Twain of old time.
It is such a book as he, and he only, could have written. It is meant for
boys; but there are few men (we should hope) who, once they take it
up, will not delight in it. It forms a companion or sequel, to <i>Tom
Sawyer</i>. Huckleberry Finn, as everybody knows, is one of Tom's
closest friends; and the present volume is a record of the adventures
which befell him soon after the event which made him a person of
property and brought Tom Sawyer's story to a becoming conclusion.
They are of the most surprising and delightful kind imaginable, and in
the course of them we fall in with a number of types of character of
singular freshness and novelty, besides being schooled in half a dozen
extraordinary dialects -- the Pike County dialect in all its forms, the
dialect of the Missouri negro, and 'the extremest form of the
backwoods South-Western dialect,' to wit. Huckleberry, it may be
noted, is stolen by his disreputable father, to escape from whom he
contrives an appearance of robbery and murder in the paternal hut,
goes off in a canoe, watches from afar the townsfolk hunting for his
dead body, and encounters a runaway negro -- Miss Watson's Jim --
an old particular friend of Tom Sawyer and himself. With Jim he goes
south down the river, and is the hero of such scrapes and experiences
as make your mouth water (if you have ever been a boy) to read of
them. We do not purpose to tell a single one; it would be unfair to
author and reader alike. We shall content ourselves with repeating that
the book is Mark Twain at his best, and remarking that Jim and
Huckleberry are real creations, and the worthy peers of the illustrious
Tom Sawyer. </p>
