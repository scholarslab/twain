<center><b>TWO FAMOUS AUTHORS.<br />
Mark Twain and George W. Cable at the<br />
Academy of Music.</b></center>
<br />
The announcement that Mark Twain and George W. Cable would give readings from 
their works filled the lecture room of the Academy last night.  Applause broke 
out when a short, slender figure, clad in evening dress, advanced with a dainty 
tread to the front of the stage and bowed to the audience.  The figure was that 
of Mr. Cable.  His hair is dark and his eyes gleam now with humor and now with 
pathos.<br /><br />
He wears a full beard and long, well-twisted mustachios that droop on either side 
and form a complete semi-circle.  His feet and hands are small and the latter he 
uses with all the grace and delicacy of a woman.  Mr. Cable's voice is pitched in 
a high but musical key.  His modulation possesses a charm which suggests the 
rippling of a stream. It rises and falls with almost every word.<br /><br />
With the exception of the Creole songs which Mr. Cable sang, all his readings 
were from his "Dr. Sevier."  To say the least, they were delightful, and were 
heartily appreciated by the audience.<br /><br />
Mark Twain no sooner put his head outside the flies than the audience began to 
laugh as well as applaud.  There was something indescribably droll about the very 
look of the man.<br /><br />
He, too, wore the conventional swallow tail.  He came forward with a lazy air.  
It was as much as he seemed able to do to drag one foot after another.  His dark, 
iron-grey hair was brushed back. He has a heavy brownish moustache.  As he walks 
he stoops slightly. He never smiles.  When he says anything that creates laughter, 
he simply pauses, throws his head a little on one side and peers sleepily out of 
the corner of his eye.<br /><br />
His favorite use of his hands is either to scratch the back of his head or with 
the outside of his thumb to rub his half-closed eyes.  The program of last evening 
will be repeated at 2 P. M. to-day.  An entirely new program will be produced 
to-night at 8 o'clock.<br />
