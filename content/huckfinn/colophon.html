        <center><h2>"Illustrating <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>"<br />
By E.W. Kemble</h2></center>

<p>I was a budding cartoonist on the <i>Daily Graphic</i>
          in 1881 when that paper was the only illustrated daily in
          New York. Newspapers had not begun to publish pictures,
          and Thomas Nast reigned supreme as the master cartoonist
          of the country.</p>

          <p><i>Harper's Weekly</i> turned up its dignified nose at
          this little upstart of a paper, and <i>Leslie's
          Weekly</i> sneered at its impudence. The idea of an
          illustrated daily! At all events, it did very nicely for
          a spell, but when the daily newspapers began to use
          pictures it gave a few convulsive gasps and died.</p>

          <p>Then along came <i>Life.</i> Its appearance caused the
          know-it-alls to stick their tongues in their cheeks and,
          holding the small publication at arm's length, exclaim,
          "Ten cents for that? What gall!"</p>

          <p>I remember my first visit to the editorial department
          of this unique publication. John Ames Mitchell was the
          founder and editor in chief and Henry Guy Carleton was
          associate editor. Mitchell's studio was used as the
          office. Between towering rows of returned copies a narrow
          trail had been cleared, and through this I timidly made
          my way. Carleton was sitting nearest the door, so I made
          my entrance speech to him. "Are you the art editor?"
          Unfortunately he stammered badly, and while he was
          gathering a reply I sidled in the direction he pointed
          and repeated my inquiry to the only other visible
          individual. This was Mitchell, and he also had a slight
          hesitancy in his delivery, accompanied by a nervous
          movement of the hands.</p>

          <p>I thought they were playing a joke on me and was about
          to retreat when I was asked to sit down. Then and there
          began a most pleasant friendship with both men which
          lasted for years.</p>

          <p><a name="b" id="b">"The Thompson Street Poker Club"</a> by Carleton ran in
          <i>Life</i> for many weeks, and I made the pictures for
          it. Cyanide Whiffles, Tootles Williams and the other
          members of the club were types I delighted in
          portraying.</p>

          <p>While contributing to <i>Life</i> I made a small
          picture of a little boy being stung by a bee. Mark Twain
          had completed the manuscript of "Huckleberry Finn" and
          had set up a relative, Charles L. Webster, in the
          publishing business.</p>

          <p>Casting about for an illustrator, Mark Twain happened
          to see this picture. It had action and expression, and
          bore a strong resemblance to his mental conception of
          Huck Finn. I was sent for and immediately got in touch
          with Webster. The manuscript was handed me and the fee
          asked for--two thousand dollars--was graciously allowed.
          I had begun drawing professionally two years before this
          date, and was now at the ripe old age of twenty-three.
          Homeward I trod with nimble feet--they had really been
          made nimble by a season's training for the one-hundred
          and two-twenty yard dashes at the Mott Haven track of the
          NewYork Athletic Club. My home was not far from this
          place and the Harlem River but a short distance beyond,
          and what a blessing it was to my physical well-being that
          on my off days I could don running trunks and spiked
          shoes for an hour of practise sprints, or go to the boat
          house, array myself in a pair of gorgeous red running
          trunks and a sleeveless jersey with Mercury's winged foot
          spread o'er my youthful chest, and get into a racing gig
          for a pull up the mud-colored waterway.</p>

          <p>Now began the important job of getting a model. The
          story called for a variety of characters, old and young,
          male and female. In the neighborhood I came across a
          youngster, Cort Morris by name, who tallied with my idea
          of Huck. He was a bit tall for the ideal boy, but I could
          jam him down a few pegs in my drawing and use him for the
          other characters.</p>

          <p>From the beginning I never depended upon models but
          preferred to pick my types out of the ether, training my
          mind to visualize them. So I engaged my youthful model,
          and I remember that from the very start he became
          immensely popular among his feminine schoolmates as all
          of his income went for sweetmeats which were duly
          distributed on his homeward journeys from the seat of
          learning.</p>

          <p>I had a large room in the top of our house which I
          used as a studio. Here I collected my props for the work.
          I spent the forenoon completing the drawing, using "Huck"
          as soon as he was released from school. He was always
          grinning, and one side of his cheek was usually well
          padded with a "sour ball" or a huge wad of molasses
          taffy. Throwing his wool cap and muslin-covered
          schoolbooks on a lounge, he would ask what was wanted at
          this session. I would designate the character. "We will
          do the old woman who spots Huck as he is trying to pass
          for a girl." Donning an old sunbonnet and slipping
          awkwardly into a faded skirt, Cort would squat on a low
          splint-bottomed chair and become the most woebegone
          female imaginable. Forthwith he would relieve his
          extended cheek of its burden of taffy with a mighty gulp.
          I would make a simple outline sketch on yellow toned
          paper and then take a rest, during which Cort would pop a
          "cocoanut strip" into his grinning mouth.</p>

          <p>For the King, Cort wore an old frock coat and padded
          his waist line with towels until he assumed the proper
          rotundity. Then he would mimic the sordid old reprobate
          and twist his boyish face into the most outlandish
          expressions. If I could have drawn the grimaces as they
          were I would have had a convulsing collection of comics,
          but <a name="a" id="a">these would</a> not have jibed
          with the text, and I was forced to forego them.</p>

          <p>I used my young model for every character in the
          story--man, woman and child. Jim the Negro seemed to
          please him the most. He would jam his little black wool
          cap over his head, shoot out his lips and mumble coon
          talk all the while he was posing. Grown to manhood,
          "Huck" is now a sturdy citizen of Philadelphia, connected
          with an established business house.</p>

          <p>This Negro Jim, drawn from a white schoolboy, with
          face unblackened, started something in my artistic
          career. Several advance chapters of "Huckleberry Finn"
          were published in the <i>Century Magazine,</i> then under
          the able editorship of Richard Watson Gilder and a select
          staff of assistants. My picture caught the fancy of Mr.
          Gilder and W. Lewis Frazer, the art director. I was asked
          to call and exhibit my wares. I went to <i>Life</i> and
          borrowed a few originals, but not one picture contained a
          Negro type.</p>

          <p><a name="c" id="c">"We want to see</a> some of your Negro drawings," Mr.
          Frazer said.</p>

          <p>"I have none," I replied. "I've never made any until
          this one in Huck Finn."</p>

          <p>The art editor looked dubious. "I have several stories
          I would like to have you illustrate, but they are all of
          the South."</p>

          <p>"Let me try," I urged, "and if they do not suit the
          text you need not use or pay for them."</p>

          <p>I made the drawings. Mr. Frazer nodded his head as he
          looked at them.</p>

          <p>"I guess they'll go. We'll strike off some proofs and
          send them to the authors and see what they say."</p>

          <p>The proofs were sent and soon came back with the stamp
          of approval. One author went so far as to declare: "At
          last you have an artist who knows the South." I had, up
          to that time, never been further south than Sandy Hook.
          My coons caught the public fancy. <i>The Century</i> then
          engaged me to work exclusively for their magazine. This
          continued for several years, and all the stories from
          those charming writers of the South, Thomas Nelson Page,
          James Lane Allen, Harry Stilwell Edwards, Richard Malcom
          Johnson and George W. Cable, were placed in my hands for
          picture work. I was established as a delineator of the
          South, the Negro being my specialty, and, as I have
          mentioned, I had never been South at all. I didn't go for
          two years more. Then I told Mr. Gilder that it was high
          time for me to go and see what the real article looked
          like. He agreed with me. After visiting several
          plantations and noting the local color, a thing I had
          missed but had not attempted to carry out to any extent
          in my pictures, I found that my types were, in most
          cases, the counterparts of those surrounding me. I had
          seen the Negro of the city but he was a different bird
          from the plantation product, both in carriage and dress.
          It all seems so strange to me now, that a single subject,
          a Negro, drawn from a pose given me by a lanky white
          schoolboy, should have started me on a career that has
          lasted for forty-five years, especially as I had no more
          desire to specialize in that subject than I had in the
          Chinaman or the Malay pirate.</p>

          <p>Years later I sat beside Mark Twain at a luncheon in
          the home of Mrs. Clarence Mackay. I had not seen him in
          all the intervening years. His face bore no trace of the
          siege he had been through when the firm of Charles L.
          Webster went bankrupt and he began his lecture tour,
          paying back every dollar of the indebtedness. We fell to
          talking of the past--its writers and illustrators. Abbey
          had never been equaled, he contended. His delightful
          drawings for Herrick's " Poems," for "She Stoops to
          Conquer" and "The Quiet Life" stamped him as a master of
          his craft. Frost stood alone in his humor. There were
          Smedley, Reinhart and Remington, a little group of
          shining lights undimmed by time. We spoke of Huck Finn
          and I told him of my model and of the various uses to
          which I had put him. He seemed greatly amused and wanted
          me to enlighten him about my beginnings as an
          illustrator.</p>

          <p>From early childhood I had kept a pencil busy night
          and day when freed from the irksome task of home study,
          which I thoroughly abhorred, drawing anything that
          tickled my fancy--soldiers, Indians, long processions of
          circus parades. These I would cut out with scissors and
          place on a seam in the carpet, where they would stretch
          from wall to wall, and woe betide any one who disarranged
          this imposing aggregation. My mother was the principal
          offender, for the long skirts of that day swept my
          creations into discordant combinations. Then came
          boarding-school, where I indulged in caricatures of the
          teachers. School days over, I had several small positions
          at office work, capped with an all-important job in the
          Western Union Telegraph Company. In the auditor's
          department I toyed with long rows of figures until I
          could see them at night crawling over the bedspread.</p>

          <p>Whilst engaged in guarding the finances of this
          important institution I spent my evenings drawing various
          whims and fancies. My father suggested that I think up
          some timely ideas, do them in ink and take them to some
          periodical. I made four small comics, signed my name in a
          conspicuous place on each sketch, and, on the following
          day, sallied forth at the luncheon hour to the house of
          Harper &amp; Brothers in Franklin Square. Up the winding
          iron stairway I climbed and sought the art department, a
          small boxed-in enclosure presided over by Charles
          Parsons. Standing with hat in one hand and my boyish
          attempt at humor in the other, I waited patiently for the
          elderly gentleman in charge to address me. He looked up
          from a desk piled high with art and beckoned me. I gave
          him the package and was told to call in a few days and he
          would enlighten me as to their availability.</p>

          <p>I went back to my desk and dismissed the sketches from
          my mind. Several days later, while indulging in my
          noonday feast--a plate of roast beef, mashed potatoes,
          bread and butter, all for fifteen cents at Smith and
          McNeel's Restaurant on Fulton Street--I remembered my
          drawings. "A few days" had passed. The meal was rapidly
          disposed of and I hastened to the publishing house to
          learn the verdict. Maybe they would give me a dollar or
          two for one of them. (My salary at the Western Union was
          ten dollars a week.)</p>

          <p>Up the spiral stairway I went with dubious
          forebodings; in a mild and timid tone I half whispered my
          request that I had come for my sketches.</p>

          <p>"What name?" the director asked me. I gulped and
          murmured "Kemble."</p>

          <p>"Oh, yes," he replied. "You don't wish to take them
          all home with you, do you?" He smiled, and going to his
          desk, wrote something on a printed slip and handed it to
          me. "If you will take that to the cashier on the main
          floor he will give you the money. It is for seventy
          dollars." How I got down the circular iron stairway I
          have never been able to learn--whether I slid, tumbled or
          jumped. The cashier, a beetle-browed individual, glared
          at me, wrote something in a large book, came out from his
          cage-like enclosure and directed me to sign on the dotted
          line. Then he went back to his cage and through a tiny
          window poked seventy dollars in gold at me.</p>

          <p>I pocketed my treasure and went back to my work. Every
          column I added up that afternoon seemed to have a seven
          in the total. I was reprimanded by the auditor for my
          carelessness. That evening, for fear that I would be
          robbed I ignored 'bus and street car and walked the
          entire distance from Vesey Street to Forty-third, where I
          lived. The following week I resigned my mathematical
          position and joined the <i>Daily Graphic</i> as a staff
          artist.</p>

          <p>The marvelous methods of an art department of that
          period are worth recording. A spacious loft on the top
          floor of the plant served as the studio. Some ten budding
          geniuses were seated at tables where their shares in the
          pictorial features were given them by the art director.
          Each man was more or less a specialist in his particular
          line. Gray Parker did horses and social events. Cusaks, a
          Spaniard, did any old thing and sang snatches from
          "Carmen" while doing it. Zenope, a Turk, did portraits
          and delivered monologues of children reciting bits from
          their Sunday-school lessons. C. V. Taylor, long and
          lanky, with spreading side-whiskers, did cartoons and
          street scenes. I was cartoonist and character artist.
          George B. Lucks was a contributor and did wonderful song
          and dance acts for us whenever he paid a visit to the
          sanctum. If the West Point cadets were to parade on the
          following day, a full page spread had to be done the day
          before. The reviewing stand was put in by one man, the
          cadets drawn by the military genius, the mayor and his
          guests inserted by the portrait man, and then the whole
          masterpiece was pieced together and made ready for the
          photographer in an adjoining room. The thing that always
          bothered us most was the weather forecast. We would wait
          until the last minute and if a report came from the
          weather bureau announcing "rain tomorrow," the rain
          specialist, who was skilled at making an open umbrella
          from a bird's-eye point of view, covered the whole opus
          with his product. Completed, the plate was made and the
          paper went to bed, and invariably the day of the parade
          just reeked with sunshine.</p>

          <p>"Huckleberry Finn" was filmed a few years ago, and the
          director, the lamented William Desmond Taylor, who was
          mysteriously murdered in Hollywood soon after the picture
          was released, took a copy of the original edition and
          made his characters fit my drawings. I had not seen the
          book in years, and as my characters appeared on the
          screen, resembling my types so faithfully, even as to
          pose, my mind ran back to the lanky boy who posed for me
          and the pride I had felt in doing my first book.</p>
