<center><b>The Scattering of Mark Twain's Friends.</b></center>
<p>As this noted humorist is to lecture in this city to-night, the
following, from the Utica Observer, may serve as a good notice:</p>

<p>Mark Twain ascended the crowded platform in Buffalo, and standing
before a crowded audience, said: "Let me introduce a man whom you
regard--whom I regard--as the greatest living modern writer of ancient
fiction; a man in whom all genius, all honor, all integrity, all
virtue--and all vice--combine to make the perfect man.  I forgot; his
name is Geo. W. Cable."  Mr. Cable read a selection from "Dr. Sevier,"
and then proceeded to introduce Mark Twain, who referred to his former
residence in Buffalo as follows: "Many changes have taken place since
I was a citizen of Buffalo.  I miss--and we all miss--many friends.
Some have gone to the tomb--some to the gallows--and some to the White
House.  Let us so live that, in the uncertainty which attends this life,
we may be prepared for all three of these fates."</p>
