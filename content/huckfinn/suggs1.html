<blockquote>* &nbsp; The reader is requested to bear in mind, that the scenes
described in this chapter are not <i>now</i> to be witnessed.
Eight or ten years ago, all classes of population of the Creek
country were very different from what they now are. Of course, no
disrespect is intended to any denomination of Christians. We
believe that camp-meetings are not peculiar to any church, though
most usual in the Methodist -- a denomination whose
respectability in Alabama is attested by the fact, that <i>very
many</i> of its worthy clergymen and lay members, hold honorable
and profitable offices in the gift of the state legislature; of
which, indeed, almost a controlling portion are themselves
Methodists. &nbsp; &nbsp; [Hooper's Note]</blockquote>
