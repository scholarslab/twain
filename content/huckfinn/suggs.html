<center><h2>Southwest Humor</h2></center>

<p><i>One of the most popular modes of writing in the decades preceding the Civil War was the "Humor of the Old Southwest."  Literary historians use that label to refer to a large collection of books, tales, sketches and descriptive essays set in the frontier South (mainly Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana).  These texts made generous use of the vernacular voice, and regularly included con men, drunkards, raftsmen and brawlers like the people Huck and Jim meet on the river.  Among the most prolific writers in this mode were A.B. Longstreet, W.T. Thompson, G.W. Harris, J.G. Baldwin, T.B. Thorpe, and J.J. Hooper, one of whose tales is included below.  MT read widely in this genre, both in the 1840s and 1850s and during the years he was writing</i> Huck Finn <i>.  The commentators agree that Chapter 20 of</i> Huck Finn<i>, in which the King works the Pokeville camp meeting, was based directly on Hooper's account of Simon Suggs' religious experience.</i></p>

<p><i>Twelve additional tales in this mode, including three by MT, and a fuller account of "Southwest Humor" as a literary movement, can be found in</i> <a href="../projects/price/southwes.htm">Angel Price's archive</a> <i>in the Student Projects section of this site.</i></p>

<center><b>CHAPTER THE TENTH.</b></center>
<br />
<center><font size="+1">THE CAPTAIN ATTENDS A CAMP-MEETING.</font></center>

<img src="suggs.jpg" align="left" alt="1845 ILLUSTRATION" />

<p>C<font size="-1">APTAIN</font> S<font size="-1">UGGS</font> found himself as poor at the conclusion of the
Creek war, as he had been at its commencement. Although no "arbitrary," " despotic," "corrupt," and "unprincipled" judge had
fined him a thousand dollars for his proclamation of martial law
at Fort Suggs, or the enforcement of its rules in the case of
Mrs. Haycock; yet somehow -- the thing is alike inexplicable to
him and to us -- the money which he had contrived, by various
shifts to obtain, melted away and was gone for ever. To a man like
the Captain, of intense domestic affections, this state of
destitution was most distressing. "He could stand it himself --
didn't care a d--n for it, no way," he observed, "but the old
woman and the children; <i>that</i> bothered him!"</p>

<p>As he sat one day, ruminating upon the unpleasant condition of
his "financial concerns," Mrs. Suggs informed him that "the sugar
and coffee was nigh about out," and that there were not "a dozen
j'ints and middling, <i>all put together</i>, in the smoke-house." Suggs bounced up on the instant, exclaiming, "D--n it!
<i>somebody</i> must suffer!" But whether this remark was
intended to convey the idea that he and his family were about to
experience the want of the necessaries of life; or that some
other, and as yet unknown individual should "suffer" to prevent
that prospective exigency, must be left to the commentators, if
perchance any of that ingenious class of persons should hereafter
see proper to write notes for this history. It is enough for us
that we give all the facts in this connection, so that ignorance
of the subsequent conduct of Captain Suggs may not lead to an
erroneous judgment in respect to his words.</p>

<p>Having uttered the exclamation we have repeated -- and perhaps,
hurriedly walked once or twice across the room -- Captain Suggs
drew on his famous old green-blanket overcoat, and ordered his
horse, and within five minutes was on his way to a camp-meeting,
then in full blast on Sandy creek, twenty miles distant, where he
hoped to find amusement, at least. When he arrived there, he
found the hollow square of the encampment filled with people,
listening to the mid-day sermon and its dozen accompanying "exhortations." A half-dozen preachers were dispensing the word;
the one in the pulpit, a meek-faced old man, of great simplicity
and benevolence. His voice was weak and cracked, notwithstanding
which, however, he contrived to make himself heard
occasionally, above the din of the exhorting, the singing, and
the shouting which were going on around him. The rest were
walking to and fro, (engaged in the other exercises we have
indicated,) among the "mourners" -- a host of whom occupied the
seat set apart for their especial use -- or made personal appeals
to the mere spectators. The excitement was intense. Men and women
rolled about on the ground, or lay sobbing or shouting in
promiscuous heaps. More than all the negroes sang and screamed
and prayed. Several, under the influence of what is technically
called "the jerks," were plunging and pitching about with
convulsive energy. The great object of all seemed to be, to see
who could make the greatest noise --</p>

<blockquote>"And each -- for madness ruled the hour --<br />
Would try his own expressive power."</blockquote>

<p>"Bless my poor old soul!" screamed the preacher in the pulpit;
"ef yonder aint a squad in that corner that we aint got one outen
yet! It'll never do" -- raising his voice -- "you must come outen
that! Brother Fant, fetch up that youngster in the blue coat! I
see the Lord's a-workin' upon him! Fetch him along -- glory --
yes! -- hold to him !"</p>

<p>"Keep the thing warm!" roared a sensual seeming man, of stout
mould and florid countenance, who was exhorting among a bevy of
young women, upon whom he was lavishing caresses. "Keep the
thing warm, breethring! -- come to the Lord, honey!" he added, as
he vigorously hugged one of the damsels he sought to save.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've got him!" said another in exulting tones, as he led up
a gawky youth among the mourners -- "I've got him -- he tried to git
off, but -- ha! Lord!" -- shaking his head as much as to say, it
took a smart fellow to escape him -- "ha! Lord!" -- and he wiped
the perspiration from his face with one hand, and with the other,
patted his neophyte on the shoulder -- "he couldn't do it! No!
Then he tried to argy wi' me -- but bless the Lord! -- he
couldn't do that nother! Ha! Lord! I tuk him, fust in the Old
Testament -- bless the Lord! -- and I argyed him all thro' Kings
-- then I thronged him into Proverbs. -- and from that, here we
had it up and down, kleer down to the New Testament, and then I
begun to see it work him! -- then we got into Matthy, and from
Matthy right straight along to Acts; and <i>thar</i> I thronged
him! Y-e-s L-o-r-d!" -- assuming the nasal twang and high pitch
which are, in some parts, considered the perfection of rhetorical
art -- "Y-e-s L-o-r-d! and h-e-r-e he is! Now g-i-t down thar,"
addressing the subject, "and s-e-e ef the L-o-r-d won't do
somethin' f-o-r you!" Having thus deposited his charge among the
mourners, he started out, summarily to convert another soul!</p>

<p>"Gl-o-<i>ree!</i>" yelled a huge, greasy negro woman, as in a fit
of the jerks, she threw herself convulsively from her feet, and
fell "like a thousand of brick," across a diminutive old man in a
little round hat, who was squeaking consolation to one of the
mourners. </p>

<p>"Good Lord, have mercy!" ejaculated the little man earnestly and
unaffectedly, as he strove to crawl from under the sable mass
which was crushing him.</p>

<p>In another part of the square a dozen old women were singing.
They were in a state of absolute extasy, as their shrill pipes
gave forth,</p>

<blockquote>"I rode on the sky,<br />
Quite ondestified I,<br />
And the moon it was under my feet!"</blockquote>

<p>Near these last, stood a delicate woman in that hysterical
condition in which the nerves are incontrollable, and which is
vulgarly -- and almost blasphemously -- termed the "holy laugh."
A hideous grin distorted her mouth, and was accompanied with a
maniac's chuckle; while <a name="1">every muscle and nerve</a> of her face
twitched and jerked in horrible spasms.<font size="+1"><b><a href="javascript:Start('suggs1.html')">*</a></b></font></p>

<p>Amid all this confusion and excitement Suggs stood unmoved. He
viewed the whole affair as a grand deception -- a sort of
"opposition line" running against his own, and looked on with a
sort of professional jealousy. Sometimes he would mutter running
comments upon what passed before him.</p>

<p>"Well now," said he, as he observed the fullfaced brother who was
"officiating" among the women, "that ere feller takes my eye! --
thar he's been this half-hour, a-figurin amongst them galls,
and's never said the fust word to nobody else. Wonder what's the
reason these here preachers never hugs up the old, ugly women?
Never seed one do it in my life -- the sperrit never moves 'em
that way! It's nater tho'; and the women, <i>they</i> never
flocks round one o' the old dried-up breethring -- bet two to one
old splinter-legs thar," -- nodding at one of the ministers --
"won't git a chance to say turkey to a good lookin gall to-day! Well! who blames 'em? Nater will be nater,
all the world over; and I judge ef I was a preacher, I should
save the purtiest souls fuss, myself!"</p>

<p>While the Captain was in the middle of this conversation with
himself, he caught the attention of the preacher in the pulpit,
who inferring from an indescribable something about his
appearance that he was a person of some consequence, immediately
determined to add him at once to the church if it could be done;
and to that end began a vigorous, direct personal attack.</p>

<p>"Breethring," he exclaimed, "I see yonder a man that's a sinner;
I <i>know</i> he's a sinner! Thar he stands," pointing at Simon,
"a missubble old crittur, with his head a-blossomin for the
grave! A few more short years, and d-o-w-n he'll go to perdition,
lessen the Lord have mer-cy on him! Come up here, you old hoary-headed sinner, a-n-d git down upon your knees, a-n-d put up your
cry for the Lord to snatch you from the bottomless pit! You're
ripe for the devil -- you're b-o-u-n-d for hell, and the Lord
only knows what'll become on you!"</p>

<p>"D--n it," thought Suggs, "<i>ef</i> I only had you down in the
krick swamp for a minit or so, <i>I'd</i> show you who's
<i>old!</i> I'd alter your tune <i>mighty</i> sudden, you sassy,
'saitful old rascal!" But he judiciously held his tongue and gave
no utterance to the thought.</p>

<p>The attention of many having been directed to the Captain by the
preacher's remarks, he was soon surrounded by numerous well-meaning, and doubtless very pious persons, each one of whom
seemed bent on the application of his own particular recipe for
the salvation of souls. For a long time the Captain stood silent,
or answered the incessant stream of exhortation only with a
sneer; but at length, his countenance began to give token of
inward emotion. First his eye-lids twitched -- then his upper lip
quivered -- next a transparent drop formed on one of his eye-lashes, and a similar one on the tip of his nose -- and, at last,
a sudden bursting of air from nose and mouth, told that Captain
Suggs was overpowered by his emotions. At the moment of the
explosion, he made a feint as if to rush from the crowd, but he
was in experienced hands, who well knew that the battle was more
than half won.</p>

<p>"Hold to him!" said one -- "it's a-workin in him as strong as a
Dick horse!"</p>

<p>"Pour it into him," said another, " it'll all come right
directly!"</p>

<p>"That's the way I love to see 'em do," observed a third; "when
you begin to draw the water from their eyes, taint gwine to be
long afore you'll have 'em on their knees!"</p>

<p>And so they clung to the Captain manfully, and half dragged, half
led him to the mourner's bench; by which he threw himself down,
altogether unmanned, and bathed in tears. Great was the rejoicing
of the brethren, as they sang, shouted, and prayed around him -- for by this time it had come to be generally known that the
"convicted" old man was Captain Simon Suggs, the very "chief of
sinners" in all that region.</p>

<p>The Captain remained grovelling in the dust during the usual
time, and gave vent to even more than the requisite number of
sobs, and groans, and heartpiercing cries. At length, when the
proper time had arrived, he bounced up, and with a face radiant
with joy, commenced a series of vaultings and tumblings, which
"laid in the shade" all previous performances of the sort at that
camp-meeting. The brethren were in extasies at this demonstrative
evidence of completion of the work; and whenever Suggs shouted
"Gloree!" at the top of his lungs, every one of them shouted it
back, until the woods rang with echoes.</p>

<p>The effervescence having partially subsided, Suggs was put upon
his pins to relate his experience, which he did somewhat in this
style -- first brushing the tear-drops from his eyes, and giving
the end of his nose a preparatory wring with his fingers, to free
it of the superabundant moisture:</p>

<p>"Friends," he said, "it don't take long to curry a short horse,
accordin' to the old sayin', and I'll give you the perticklers of
the way I was 'brought to a knowledge'" -- here the Captain wiped
his eyes, brushed the tip of his nose and snuffled a little --
"in less'n no time."</p>

<p>"Praise the Lord!" ejaculated a bystander.</p>

<p>"You see I come here full o' romancin' and devilment, and jist to
make game of all the purceedins. Well, sure enough, I done so for
some time, and was a-thinkin how I should play some trick --"</p>

<p>"Dear soul alive ! <i>don't</i> he talk sweet!" cried an old lady
in black silk -- "Whar's John Dobbs? You Sukey!" screaming at a
negro woman on the other side of the square -- "ef you don't hunt
up your mass John in a minute, and have him here to listen to his
'sperience, I'll tuck you up when I git home and give you a
hundred and fifty lashes, madam! -- see ef I don't! Blessed
Lord!" -- referring again to the Captain's relation -- "aint it a
<i>precious</i> 'scource!"</p>

<p>"I was jist a-thinkin' how I should play some trick to turn it
all into redecule, when they began to come round me and talk.
Long at fust I didn't mind it, but arter a little that brother"
-- pointing to the reverend gentlemen who had so successfully
carried the unbeliever through the Old and New Testaments, and
who Simon was convinced was the "big dog of the tanyard" -- "that
brother spoke a word that struck me kleen to the heart, and run
all over me, like fire in dry grass --"</p>

<p>"<i>I-I-I</i> can bring 'em!" cried the preacher alluded to, in a
tone of exultation -- "Lord thou knows ef thy servant can't stir
'em up, nobody else needn't try -- but the glory aint mine! I'm a
poor worrum of the dust" he added, with ill-managed affectation. </p>

<p>"And so from that I felt somethin' a-pullin' me inside --"</p>

<p>"Grace! grace! nothin' but grace!" exclaimed one; meaning that
"grace" had been operating in the Captain's gastric region.</p>

<p>"And then," continued Suggs, "I wanted to git off, but they hilt
me, and bimeby I felt so missuble, I had to go yonder" --
pointing to the mourners' seat -- "and when I lay down thar it
got wuss and wuss, and 'peered like somethin' was a-mashin' down
on my back --"</p>

<p>"That was his load o' sin," said one of the brethren -- "never
mind, it'll tumble off presently, see ef it don't!" and he shook
his head professionally and knowingly.</p>

<p>"And it kept a-gittin heavier and heavier, ontwell it looked like
it might be a four year old steer, or a big pine log, or
somethin' of that sort --"</p>

<p>"Glory to my soul," shouted Mrs. Dobbs, "it's the sweetest talk I
<i>ever</i> hearn! You Sukey! aint you got John yit? never mind,
my lady, <i>I</i>'ll settle wi' you!" Sukey quailed before the
finger which her mistress shook at her.</p>

<p>"And arter awhile," Suggs went on, "'peared like I fell into a
trance, like, and I seed --"</p>

<p>"Now we'll git the good on it!" cried one of the sanctified.</p>

<p>"And I seed the biggest, longest, rip-roarenest, blackest,
scariest --" Captain Suggs paused, wiped his brow, and ejaculated
"Ah, L-o-r-d!" so as to give full time for curiosity to become
impatience to know what he saw.</p>

<p>"<i>Sarpent!</i> warn't it?" asked one of the preachers.</p> 

<p>"No, not a serpent," replied Suggs, blowing his nose.</p>

<p>"Do tell us <i>what</i> it war, soul alive! -- whar <i>is</i>
John?" said Mrs. Dobbs.</p>

<p>"Allegator!" said the Captain.</p>

<p>"Alligator!" repeated every woman present, and screamed for very
life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dobb's nerves were so shaken by the announcement, that after
repeating the horrible word, she screamed to Sukey, "you Sukey, I
say, you Su-u-ke-e-y! ef you let John come a-nigh this way, whar
the dreadful alliga--- shaw! what am I thinkin 'bout? 'Twarn't
nothin' but a vishin!"</p>

<p>"Well," said the Captain in continuation, "the allegator kept a-comin' and a-comin' to'ards me, with his great long jaws a-gapin'
open like a ten-foot pair o' tailors' shears --"</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! oh! Lord! gracious above!" cried the women.</p>

<p>"S<font size="-1">ATAN</font>!" was the laconic ejaculation of the
oldest preacher present, who thus informed the congregation that
it was the devil which had attacked Suggs in the shape of an
alligator. </p>

<p>"And then I concluded the jig was up, 'thout I could block his
game some way; for I seed his idee was to snap off my head --"</p>

<p>The women screamed again.</p>

<p>"So I fixed myself jist like I was purfectly willin' for him to
take my head, and rather he'd do it as not" -- here the women
shuddered perceptibly -- "and so I hilt my head straight out" --
the Captain illustrated by elongating his neck -- "and when he
come up and was a gwine to <i>shet down</i> on it, I jist pitched
in a big rock which choked him to death, and that minit I felt
the weight slide off; and I had the best feelins -- sorter like
you'll have from <i>good</i> sperrits -- any body ever had!"</p>

<p>"Didn't I <i>tell</i> you so? Didn't I <i>tell</i> you so?" asked
the brother who had predicted the off-tumbling of the load of
sin. "Ha, Lord! fool <i>who!</i> I've been <i>all</i> along thar!
-- yes, <i>all along thar!</i> and I know every inch of the way
jist as good as I do the road home!" -- and then he turned round
and round, and looked at all, to receive a silent tribute to his
superior penetration.</p>

<p>Captain Suggs was now the "lion of the day." Nobody could pray so
well, or exhort so movingly, as "brother Suggs." Nor did his
natural modesty prevent the proper performance of appropriate
exercises. With the reverend Bela Bugg (him to whom, under
providence, he ascribed his conversion,) he was a most especial
favourite. They walked, sang, and prayed together for hours.</p>

<p>"Come, come up; thar's room for all!" cried brother Bugg, in his
evening exhortation. "Come to the 'seat,' and ef you won't pray
yourselves, let <i>me</i> pray for you!"</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Simon, by way of assisting his friend; "it's a game
that all can win at! Ante up! ante up, boys -- friends I mean -- don't back out!"</p>

<p>"Thar aint a sinner here," said Bugg, "no matter ef his soul's
black as a nigger, but what thar's room for him!"</p>

<p>"No matter what sort of a hand you've got," added Simon in the
fulness of his benevolence; "take stock! Here am I, the
wickedest and blindest of sinners -- has spent my whole life in
the sarvice of the devil -- has now come in on <i>narry pair</i>
and won a <i>pile!</i>" and the Captain's face beamed with holy
pleasure.</p>

<p>"D-o-n-'t be afeard!" cried the preacher; "come along! the
meanest won't be turned away! humble yourselves and come!"</p>

<p>"No!" said Simon, still indulging in his favourite style of
metaphor; "the bluff game aint played here! No runnin' of a body
off! Every body holds four aces, and when you bet, you win!"</p>

<p>And thus the Captain continued, until the services were
concluded, to assist in adding to the number at the mourners'
seat; and up to the hour of retiring, he exhibited such
enthusiasm in the cause, that he was unanimously voted to be the
most efficient addition the church had made during that meeting.</p>

<p>The next morning, when the preacher of the day first entered the
pulpit, he announced that "brother Simon Suggs," mourning over
his past iniquities, and desirous of going to work in the cause
as speedily as possible, would take up a collection to found a
church in his own neighbourhood, at which he hoped to make
himself useful as soon as he could prepare himself for the
ministry, which the preacher didn't doubt, would be in a very few
weeks, as brother Suggs was " a man of mighty good judgement, and
of <i>a great discorse</i>." The funds were to be collected by
"brother Suggs," and held in trust by brother Bela Bugg, who was
the financial officer of the circuit, until some arrangement
could be made to build a suitable house.</p>

<p>"Yes, breethring," said the Captain, rising to his feet; "I want
to start a little 'sociation close to me, and I want you all to
help. I'm mighty poor myself, as poor as any of you -- don't
leave breethring" -- observing that several of the well-to-do
were about to go off -- "don't leave; ef you aint able to afford
any thing, jist give us your blessin' and it'll be all the same!"</p>

<p>This insinuation did the business, and the sensitive individuals
re-seated themselves.</p>

<p>"It's mighty little of this world's goods I've got," resumed
Suggs, pulling off his hat and holding it before him; "but I'll
bury <i>that</i> in the cause any how," and he deposited his last
five-dollar bill in the hat.</p>

<p>There was a murmur of approbation at the Captain's liberality
throughout the assembly.</p>

<p>Suggs now commenced collecting, and very prudently attacked first
the gentlemen who had shown a disposition to escape. These, to
exculpate themselves from any thing like poverty, contributed
handsomely.</p>

<p>"Look here, breethring"" said the Captain, displaying the bank-notes thus received, "brother Snooks has drapt a five wi' me, and
brother Snodgrass a ten! In course 'taint expected that you
<i>that aint as well off as them</i>, will give <i>as much</i>;
let every one give <i>accordin'</i> to ther means."</p>

<p>This was another chain-shot that raked as it went! "Who so low"
as not to be able to contribute as much as Snooks and Snodgrass?</p>

<p>"Here's all the <i>small</i> money I've got about me," said a
burly old fellow, ostentatiously handing to Suggs, over the heads
of a half dozen, a ten dollar bill.</p>

<p>"That's what I call maganimus!" exclaimed the Captain; "that's
the way <i>every</i> rich man ought to do!"</p>

<p>These examples were followed, more or less closely, by almost all
present, for Simon had excited the pride of purse of the
congregation, and a very handsome sum was collected in a very
short time.</p>

<p>The reverend Mr. Bugg, as soon as he observed that our hero had
obtained all that was to be had at that time, went to him and
inquired what amount had been collected. The Captain replied that
it was still uncounted, but that it couldn't be much under a
hundred.</p>

<p>"Well, brother Suggs, you'd better count it and turn it over to
me now. I'm goin' to leave presently."</p>

<p>"No!" said Suggs -- "can't do it!"</p>

<p>"Why? -- what's the matter?" inquired Bugg.</p>

<p>"It's got to be <i>prayed over</i>, fust!" said Simon, a heavenly
smile illuminating his whole face.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Bugg, "less go one side and do it!"</p>

<p>"No!" said Simon, solemnly.</p>

<p>Mr. Bugg gave a look of inquiry.</p>

<p>"You see that krick swamp?" asked Suggs -- "I'm gwine down in
thar, and I'd gwine to lay this money down <i>so</i>" -- showing
how he would place it on the ground -- "and I'm gwine to git on
these here knees" -- slapping the right one -- "and I'm <i>n-e-v-e-r</i> gwine to quit the grit ontwell I feel it's got the
blessin'! And nobody aint got to be thar but me!"</p>

<p>Mr. Bugg greatly admired the Captain's fervent piety, and bidding
him God-speed, turned off.</p>

<p>Captain Suggs "struck for" the swamp sure enough, where his horse
was already hitched. "Ef them fellers aint done to a cracklin,"
he muttered to himself as he mounted, " I'll never bet on two
pair agin! They're peart at the snap game, theyselves; but they're
badly lewed this hitch! Well! Live and let live is a good old
motter, and it's my sentiments adzactly !" And giving the spur to
his horse, off he cantered.</p>
