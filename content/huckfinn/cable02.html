        &nbsp; <font size="-1">SPECIAL DISPATCH TO THE HERALD, NEW
        YORK, 9 MAY</font>.--Rumors of a triangular row have gone
        out from the Everett House and thence penetrated the
        remotest corners of the literary metropolis. The story grew
        as it spread, until it told of personal conflict, even
        fisticuffs, between Mark Twain, Maj. J. B. Pond and George
        W. Cable; but when inquiry was today made as to whether two
        of the named notables had fallen upon the third, or each of
        the three had assaulted the two others, tremendous
        exaggeration was disclosed. There had been no physical
        encounter, and only a business disagreement so private and
        intangible that few particulars can be ascertained. It is
        certain, however, that the tour which Twain and Cable
        lately made as readers of their own works, under the
        management of Pond, resulted in profit and ill-humor
        equally large. Twain was the originator of the scheme, and
        he invited Cable to his home in Hartford, where the details
        of the proposed entertainment were arranged. It is Pond's
        business to manage lecturers and other lyceum performers,
        and he was offered a partnership in the enterprise. The
        contract provided that the "travelling expenses," added to
        the costs of advertising and halls, should first be
        deducted from the receipts, and the remainder divided into
        three equal shares for the partners. They did not follow
        the common practice of engaging with local societies, but
        trusted wholly to the dual strength of the humorist and the
        novelist, to draw audiences independently at theatrical
        prices. When they returned from the successful venture, and
        put up at the Everett, where Pond and Twain lived a
        considerable part of their time, it was observed that
        amicability had departed from the midst of the trio. Cable
        talked vaguely to his friends of hoggishness on the part of
        Twain in getting a disproportionate share of the glory, and
        Twain vowed, in seeming acrimony, that he would never,
        never go on the platform again; but Pond's plaint was less
        sentimental, for it related to the nature of the charges
        which his companions made as "travelling expenses." Cable
        was the chief offender in that way. His theory was that so
        highly luxurious a thing as champagne and so lowly a one as
        the blacking of his boots properly belonged to the
        partnership account, and Pond declares that the bills
        rendered by Cable are greater curiosities of literature
        than the best of his creole dialect. All three admit that
        the firm of Twain, Cable &amp; Pond is permanently
        dissolved.<br />
