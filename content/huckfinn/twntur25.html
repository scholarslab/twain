[<i>The review of MT and Cable's February 11 performance in Oberlin is the third article </i>below<i>, after the two publicity notices. The reviewer says the audience was "unanimously" satisfied, but the exchange of articles and letters that follow it tell a different story: despite the reduced ticket prices, at least one person felt as "Sold!" by the event as that Bricksville audience felt about the King and Duke's "Royal Nonesuch" in </i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn<i>.  The various responses expressed here remind us both that no single reviewer can represent an entire audience, and that as a traveling humorist MT was judged by a complicated set of expectations.</i>]

<p> &nbsp; --We are glad to see that the U. L. A. has secured Twain and Cable
for next Wednesday evening.  The great place these two men occupy in the literary
world is well known.  No humorist has ever lived who gained the popularity of
Mark Twain.  The readers of the Century Magazine have long admired the genius of
the distinguished Southern novelist, Geo. W. Cable.  From the press notices, which
we have seen from all the large cities where they have lately appeared, we judge
that Twain and Cable as readers of their own works have been the great success of
the last decade on the American platform.  The tickets are 50 cents, 75 cents and
$1.00.  Every one should secure tickets early, as there is sure to be a great rush.</p>

<center><b><font size="+1">When Shall We Twain, Meet Again?</font></b></center>
<br />
<p>Why at the First Church, Wednesday evening, at 7 o'clock.  You will also meet the
celebrated Geo. W. Cable, the greatest living writer of fiction.  Don't let any
thing keep you away.  At other places where Twain and Cable have been, they put the
tickets at $1.50.  Here you can get them for 50 cents, 75 cents and $1.00. For sale
at Goodrich's after 1 p.m. Saturday.</p>

<br />
<p> &nbsp; --The Twain and Cable entertainment given on Wednesday evening, Feb. 11, under
the auspices of the U. L. A., was the most enjoyable which we have had here for several
years.  Twain fully met the expectations of his many admiring readers, adding the
peculiar force of his recitations to the unlimited humor of his own compositions.  Cable,
though not as universally known to the audience as Twain, was received with high
expectations.  He proved himself the peer of his companion in the humorous, while he
excelled in the pathetic at which Twain made no attempt.  Cable's elocutionary ability
is of the first rank; his rendition of "Mary's Ride" was an excellent model recitation.
The audience was unanimous in the expression of satisfaction, while T. &amp; C. were equally
well pleased with the appreciation shown by the audience.  In spite of the extreme cold,
the entertainment netted a handsome profit for U. L. A.</p>

<p> &nbsp; --We believe it is generally conceded that people's tastes differ.  We have in
another column a communication which is rather severe on the Twain and Cable entertainment,
and as an offset to it, and in illustration of the fact stated above, we clip the following
from the College correspondence in the Cincinnati Commercial Gazette of the 16th:</p>

<p>"Mark Twain and George W. Cable gave the best entertainment of the year last Wednesday
evening."</p>

<center><b><font size="+1">The Twain and Cable Humbug.</font></b></center>
<p>E<font size="-1">DITOR</font> N<font size="-1">EWS</font>:--I do not write this piece because
I am sorry I went to hear Twain and Cable, nor because I grudge the money I paid for the
 privilege of hearing them.  On the contrary I am glad I heard them.</p>
 <p>But I <i>do</i> like to see honesty displayed, especially by such men as compose the U. L.
A. society.</p>
<p>And now that they and the people of this city have been so thoroughly humbugged, why not
frankly own up? and so, possibly, save other societies and communities the mortification of
being so completely swindled?  No doubt there are but few persons who do not admire the
writings of Mark Twain; but, as a lecturer or speaker, I believe that at least four-fifths
of the people who heard him the night he was at Oberlin will agree with me in saying he is
<i>not</i> a success.  And Mr. Cable, as an elocutionist, is, in <i>my</i> estimation, still
less a success.  I should, probably, like hundreds of others, have held my peace about these
lecturers, had I not seen the commendatory mention of them in the local columns of the last
week's N<font size="-1">EWS</font>, which I do not believe expresses the mind of the large
 and intelligent audience they undertook to entertain.</p>
 <p>I like to laugh, and no one enjoys a good laugh more than I do, but I'm provoked to think
that so many of us laughed when there was really nothing to laugh at. &nbsp;

<p> &nbsp; --We went to hear the Twain-Cable reading at Oberlin last Wednesday.  It was a rich
harvest of fun and sentiment.  Mark Twain is a genius; the dryest and shrewdest mirth-provoking
fun maker in the world.  Cable excels in finely finished sentences and beautiful word
pictures, very gems of thought sparkling in the sunshine of humor.  Twain is a droll fun
maker who pries into extravagance for his subjects.  Cable paints the face of nature in
true colors.--[Elyria Constitution.</p>

<br />
<center><b><font size="+1">An Anonymous "Humbug!"</font></b></center><br />
<br />
<p>A full house greeted the entertainment given by Mark Twain and Geo. W. Cable.  The audience
were drawn there by the fact that they all knew Twain and Cable by their works and that the
hearing them read their own works would add a new interest to their own future reading.  The
most of the audience had been readers of the religious and secular papers in which correspondents
from the various large cities had described the impression which Twain and Cable had made upon
them and the audiences in general. They knew that they were going to an entertainment
which had been most highly appreciated in the most highly cultured circles of our country.
With their expectations thus raised, the audience gathered, and never did an Oberlin audience
express a heartier enjoyment.  They found that the inimitable stories of Mark Twain received
a new charm when told from his lips.  A charm all the greater because he told them as no other
man ever did.  His manner was as much his own as was the decided nose on his face.</p>

<p>They found Mr. Cable to be abundantly able to translate his own characters.  I say the <i>audience</i>
went with these expectations and reached these conclusions.  By this of course I mean the
greater portion of the audience.  That all did not reach the same conclusion was not to have
been wondered at. Anything can be found fault with.  Doubtless when the Angel Gabriel blows
his trumpet, there will be some anonymous correspondent who will say that it didn't sound
half so loud as he had been led to suppose it would.  But we would like to ask whether it
would be better judgment for one who does not thus agree with the great mass of the cultivated
people of this place and of our large cities, to reflect before he decries as fools those
who thus appreciated the "Twain Cable Humbug."  Is it not possible that the poor people in
Boston who packed the largest theater night after night to see this same "humbug," were possessed
of a share of common sense if not of literary ability?</p>

<p>The U. L. A., for its part, feels that it never did so well as when it secured this
entertainment.  The U. L. A. of next year will be advised to secure it if possible.  If
the entertainment were to be secured over again, the officers of the U. L. A. would feel
all the more satisfaction in what they had to offer to the public.  This is the only
"honest" statement we can make and now, standing in a position where we were more liable
to hear criticisms than any one else, we have cheerfully, in behalf of the U. L. A., made
our humble confession of how we were "taken in."</p>
