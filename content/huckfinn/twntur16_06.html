 &nbsp; . . . Mark Twain followed and he, too, had something to say about the programme, and his determination not to be bound by it. This appears to be a part of the performance, as the readers have objected in other places to the bill and changed it to suit their own notions. Mr. Clemens proved a decided change from the style of his partner. While Mr. Cable was refined to a degree, and of polished manner, the witty Connecticut man was much broader in his humor and less graceful in his work. He was not free from affectation, and some detected an imitation of A. Ward. He told the story of "King Sollermun," related an anecdote not on the bill, and read the "Tragic Tale of the Fishwife," "A Trying Situation" and "A Ghost Story." The laughter was constant throughout, and the audience evidently found their enjoyment of the Twain characteristics much increased by the peculiar delivery of the reader. The explosive ending of the ghost story startled half the people from their seats. Altogether the performance was very enjoyable.<br /><br />
