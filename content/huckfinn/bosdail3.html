          <p>Mark Twain's "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" had a
          certain relishable flavor when mixed up with the
          miscellaneous assortment of magazine literature; but in a
          book form, and covering more than 350 pages, they are
          wearisome and labored. It would be about as easy to read
          through a jest book, as to keep up one's interest in the
          monotonous humor and the dialectic variations of "Huck
          Finn's" narrative. Here and there are patches of Mark
          Twain's best work, which could be read over and over
          again, and yet bring each time an outburst of laugher;
          but one cannot have the book long in his hands without
          being tempted to regret that the author should so often
          have laid himself open to the charge of coarseness and
          bad taste. The illustrations are admirable in their way.
          As to the general character of the book, it may be
          sufficient to remind the reader of the author's notice,
          that "all persons attempting to find a motive in this
          narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find
          a moral in it will be banished; persons attempting to
          find a plot in it will be shot."</p>
