<center><b>The Mark Twain-Cable Readings.</b></center>
<br />

 &nbsp; The readings by Messrs. Clemens and Cable at Powers' opera house last evening proved a very pleasant entertainment. Readings usually are rather tedious affairs, and an audience is sure to get wearied long before the close of the programme is reached. In the present instance the time passed away delightfully, and the only regret experienced seemed due to the fact that the "solemnities" of the occasion, as Mark Twain put it, had been brought to a close altogether too soon to suit the pleasure of the very large audience present.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; Of course "Mark Twain" is simply himself, and to be appreciated must be heard. Being a humorist by profession, he looks a good deal like an undertaker during a lull in business; his voice is of a low pitch, the expression of his countenance non-commital, his movements not really graceful, his gait just a trifle shambling. He talks in a matter-of-fact way, has a very pleasant smile which lingers with apparent fondness 'neath the cover of a heavy moustache, seems not at all distressed by his own jokes, and goes at his work evidently aware of the fact that "business is business," and must be looked after. Mr. Cable is of a dark complexion, slight in figure, rather high-pitched voice, somewhat given to gesticulating freely while reading, and thoroughly in earnest while at work.<br /><br />
