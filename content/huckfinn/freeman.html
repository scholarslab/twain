        <img src="centryad1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" alt="1884 MAGAZINE ADVERTISEMENT" /> When MT
        and Cable went back on the road after the Christmas recess,
        two things were new. Over the break MT had redesigned the
        program, so that the central feature of his performance was
        a half-hour "reading" from <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>. And
        across the country Americans were reading and reacting to
        an essay by George Washington Cable that had just appeared
        in the January issue of <i>The Century</i> magazine. MT's
        new number and Cable's essay shared a common subject --
        what Huck refers to, with a blunt crudeness that drives
        home its significance, as the "trouble" of "set[ting] a
        free nigger free."

        <p>Although (as he puts it) Cable was the son and grandson
        of slaveowners, and had served in the Confederate Army, in
        his essay -- called "<a href="hfequity.html">The Freedman's
        Case in Equity</a>" -- he argues that while the South
        originally had to dehumanize blacks in order to justify
        holding them in slavery, it was time now to allow them
        fully to exercise their rights as freemen. Although the
        essay is written dispassionately, it immediately made, as
        Cable wrote his wife from the tour's stop in Milwaukee, "a
        profound impression." In mid-January, in <a href=
        "cabltrib.html">a brief frontpage story</a>, the New York
        <i>Tribune</i> reported on Cable's side of the controversy;
        two days later, in <a href="cablenegr.html">an
        editorial</a>, the New Orleans <i>Daily Times</i> denounced
        his comments, and renounced him as "a son of the South."
        Lead by the <i>Daily Times</i>, <a href=
        "cablcrit.html">newspapers throughout the South</a>
        condemned Cable and his views about improving the condition
        of Negroes. <i>The Century</i>, after receiving a torrent
        of angry letters, published <a href="cablans.html">a
        Southern rebuttal</a> in its April issue.</p>

        <p>At the same time Cable was deeply moved by the many
        "noble letters" he received while on the tour from readers
        who admired his essay; <a href="cable01.html">one of
        these</a>, by an African American in Madison named Arthur
        B. Lee, was printed along with a response from Cable in
        <i>The Wisconsin State Journal</i> on 28 January. Cable was
        also visited before and after several tour performances by
        people -- "yellow, black, brown," "white men &amp; black
        men" -- who wanted to express their thanks to him for
        having written it. Reporters covering the tour frequently
        interviewed him about his ideas, the Governor of Ohio
        discussed them with Cable, and as he wrote Louise from
        Chicago on 17 January, "That paper is turning out to be the
        greatest thing I have ever done." Throughout the months of
        January and February, as we can tell from <a href=
        "cablfree.html">Cable's letters</a>, the various reactions
        to the essay were part of the daily life of the tour.</p>

        <p>There is evidence that <a href="cablcont.html">the
        controversy around Cable's essay</a> served as valuable
        publicity for the tour. As far as I've been able to
        discover, although MT must often have been present while
        reporters interviewed Cable, none of them ever asked him to
        comment on the "race problem." Nor can I find any record of
        how MT felt, either about the essay or about all the
        attention it was bringing Cable. But we should wonder how
        his new program played against the background of Cable's
        plea for just and humane treatment of former slaves. As you
        can see in the ad for it (<i>above left</i>), the January
        issue of <i>The Century</i> also included <a href=
        "century2.jpg">one of the three pre-publication
        excerpts</a> from <i>Huck Finn</i> -- the minstrel-show
        conversations between Huck and Jim about "speculatin' in
        stock" and "King Sollermun" that MT had been using on stage
        since the beginning of the tour. (And in the
        <i>Century</i>'s version of the text, Jim's only line that
        threatens the familiar minstrel stereotype -- "I owns
        myself" -- has been replaced with a much more racially
        demeaning alternative.) MT kept using these two pieces in
        several 1885 performances, but the part of <i>Huck Finn</i>
        that now formed the heart of his performance was usually
        titled "Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer's Brilliant Achievement."
        This was a reading version of the novel's last section, in
        which Tom, knowing that Jim has already been freed, uses
        him to stage the "Evasion."</p>

        <p><img src="irrigat.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" alt="1885 ILLUSTRATION" /> The
        <a name="x" id="x">torrent of reponse</a> to Cable's essay
        reminds us <a href="philinqr.html">how vital was the
        issue</a> of the treatment of former slaves at exactly the
        time MT took <i>Huck Finn</i> on tour. Reconstruction had
        ended in failure in 1876, and by the mid-1880s Southern
        states, led by Mississippi, were beginning to create and
        enforce the Jim Crow system of segregation that would be
        declared Constitutional in <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i> in
        1896. Cable is writing to protest the mistreatment of
        African Americans. To modern readers, who are usually
        uncomfortable with the novel's ending, there is seldom any
        question that in the "Evasion" Tom mistreats Jim, but all
        <a href="evasrev.html">the evidence from the reviews</a> of
        MT's performances, including what <a href=
        "hfmtlets.html#c">MT himself said</a> about how the piece
        was received, tells us that contemporary white audiences
        loved the episode. Jim's sufferings under Tom's
        administrations served only to make them laugh,
        uproariously according to all the reports.</p>

        <p>MT decided that "the episode where Tom &amp; Huck stock
        Jim's cabin with reptiles, &amp; then set him free," was
        the "biggest card I've got in my whole repetoire," and even
        Cable, who regularly reports on the continuous laughter
        with which audiences responded to it, called it "one of
        Mark's best things." While Cable's essay begins, "The
        greatest social problem before the American people to-day
        is, as it has been for a hundred years, the presence among
        us of the negro," MT's "Evasion" treats that problem in a
        way that was bound to be much more popular with most whites
        at the time. Jim's suffering, either as a slave (as Huck
        thinks) or as a freeman (as Tom knows), is nothing to take
        seriously. By performing the "Evasion" episode MT allows
        his white audience to laugh away the issue of "The
        Freedman's Case in Equity."</p>

        <p><img src="freeman2.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" alt="1885 ILLUSTRATION" /> Thus
        the country's response to this new program can tell us a
        lot, both about the deepest longings of MT's times, and
        about the way "Mark Twain" spoke to and tickled those
        longings. By using the links here you can explore the
        various parts of this story -- from Cable's essay to the
        reactions of lecture audiences to Jim's sufferings -- for
        yourself.</p>
