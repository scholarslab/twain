<b><font size="+1">Mark Twain and George W. Cable at the Academy.</font></b><br />
<br />

<p>Mark Twain and George W. Cable appeared at the Academy of Music last night in the presence
of a small but delighted audience.  The programme was made up of selections from the writings of
the two well-known authors.  Mr. Cable's readings were from his recent novel, Dr. Sevier, and
were listened to with the greatest interest.  Mr. Cable has a clear and distinct voice and speaks
with almost painful slowness, putting a careful emphasis on each syllable and apparently weighing
well all his utterances.  He does not possess a commanding stage presence, nor is his voice
particularly strong, yet the modesty of his demeanor makes a good impression and he makes
friends as he proceeds.  With Mark Twain it is different.  The celebrated humorist is no less
modest than his younger confrere, but he is more at home on the stage.  He walks on with a
careless shambling gait, tells the most uproariously funny stories in his inimitable way, without the
faintest shadow of a smile crossing his countenance, and retires with the same air of careless
indifference.  His selections from the advance sheets of his new story, "The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn," were heartily received, but it was not until he gave his "Tragic Tale of a
Fishwife," leading up to it with an exquisitely humorous description of the difficulties he
encountered in an attempt to master the grammar of the German language, that the audience fully
appreciated his quaint drollery.  The laughter was incessant and it increased in force as he
graphically described his meeting with an acquaintance whom he had forgotten, but who
remembered him.  His terrible mental agony was depicted with all the force of the genuine
humorist, and drew forth roars of laughter.  Mr. Cable rendered a number of Creole songs and
recited "Mary's Night Ride" with remarkable dramatic intensity.  Before commencing the
recitation he said that the story of the life of <i>John</i> and <i>Mary Richling</i> had been told
him by a friend. <i>Mary's</i> home had been in Milwaukee, and it was to Milwaukee she had
come in the midst of her trouble, leaving her husband to battle so manfully alone in New Orleans.
It was from Milwaukee she started out so bravely to reach her husband in the trying times of the
war.  He had looked forward to a visit to the city which had been the home of his heroine, with a
hope that he might grasp the hand of that noble woman.  Following is the programme for to-night:</p>
