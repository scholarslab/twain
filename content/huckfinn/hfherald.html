<p>[<i>Transcribed from Pond's <a href="javascript:Start('tourad.jpg')">broadside poster</a>.</i>]</p>

<p>The very unique and happy entertainment afforded by Mark Twain and Mr. Cable in their
joint recitations deserves the warmest praise the press can give it.  The former's manner and
speech on the platform, which are clearly unaffected, admirably supplement the humor of his
thought and language.  His style is evidently an expression of himself.  The gravity of his features
while reciting his side-splitting productions, is equal to the apparent sincerity and frankness with
which he guyed that interviewer, and even occasionally draws his audience into a trap and then
inwardly laughs at them.  The most of his hearers Saturday afternoon and evening endured all in
the way of laughter to which it was safe for Mr. Clemens to expose them.  But they will be ready
to take a second dose whenever he can conveniently visit us again.</p>

<p>Whoever has read Mr. Cable's "Grandissimes" and his "Dr. Sevier" was prepared to find in
their author a man of talent and culture.  But we confess our own surprise over his remarkable
powers as an elocutionist.  He has the delicate form, the small hands and feet, the keen,
intellectual features that excite remark from a stranger in first seeing General Mahone, of Virginia. 
His voice, though pitched on a high key, is sweet, musical, and flexible, and in his recitiations he is
equally happy in portraying the humorous and the pathetic features of his works.  His Creole
songs are, to those who have never heard them, a revelation of a new and delicious charm in
music.  In gentle, genial humor nothing could well have been happier than his representation of
the courting scene between Ristofalo and the delightful Irish widow in his Dr. Sevier, but for
dramatic fire, his rendering of the passage describing the encounter of Mrs. Richling and her
friend, the scout, with the Confederate pickets, and the subsequent ride for life could not well be
surpassed.</p>

<p>It is rare that authors are endowed as these gentlemen are, with the power of interpreting their
own creations to public gatherings.  We have no doubt that they enjoy it as much as their hearers
do, and they have the satisfaction of knowing that the entertainment, in all its features, is solely
due to their own genius.</p>
