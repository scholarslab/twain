        </center>Editor Boston Herald;<br />
        &nbsp; Dear Sir:<br />
        &nbsp; In your issue of the 7th inst. there appears a
        letter headed <i>New York Literature</i>, part of which
        alludes to me in terms against which I emphatically
        protest. Its statements are slanderous and libelous. They
        do not spare even my trusted friends, but make them, by
        implication, party to slanders of which they are absolutely
        incapable. No gentleman could have offered them for
        publication, and I wonder how you could have thought them
        worthy of room in your paper. I mean no threat when I say
        that you would have no just cause for surprise had you
        heard from me first through an attorney. Not for my sake
        alone, but for your sake and the sake of my friends
        slandered with me, you certainly owe me an
        explanation.<br />

        <center>
          Yours respectfully<br />
          G. W. Cable

        </center>Editor Boston Herald;<br />
        &nbsp; Dear Sir:<br />
        &nbsp; Yours of 13th rec'd. I thank you for its tone and
        hope you will receive my reply in the same reasonable
        spirit.<br />
        &nbsp; My protest must still stand. The matter against
        which I complain was not news, but gossip. It was an attack
        upon my private character. It neither contained nor was
        accompanied privately by any authority for its statements.
        If it had been true it would keep, for nothing in it
        required that it be hurried into print. If false it was an
        outrage against a gentleman, which no retraction could
        entirely undo.<br />
        &nbsp; Moreover it was on its face full of improbabilities.
        For it charges me with wanton, useless, purblind incivility
        to my most valued friends. And again, some of the
        statements concerning my behavior in a friend's house could
        be well authorized only when they had come first from that
        friend; but you know whose guest I was and that ought to
        have been at least cumulative proof to you that no such
        statement had been made; for that friend is not one who
        could so far forget himself as to make such complaints
        against a guest; and a man who could would not be good
        authority. And still again, it stands to reason that had I
        in his house last spring behaved with such meanness as is
        attributed to me in your paper, he could not a few months
        later have made an engagement with me that made us daily,
        nightly, constant and only companions for four
        months.<br />
        &nbsp; The name Coleman in your correspondent's letter is
        either a slip of the pen or a printer's error. While ill at
        my friend's house last spring (1884) I did not "for nearly
        3 weeks almost live on champagne." For a few days while my
        stomach was in a very delicate condition my physician
        prescribed champagne with my food in such limited quantity
        as a medical man would, and I insisted on using it more
        sparingly than it was prescribed. I was in a house where
        champagne is not "ordered expressly" for any guest, but
        where an offer to pay for my champagne would have been
        about as proper as an offer to pay for my food and lodging.
        The day I left Hartford I paid for everything I could
        persuade anybody to let me know of; but had I let my
        friends have their way I could not have paid a farthing for
        anything. The statement that I "audited" any memorandum of
        outlays of any sort--unless to see if I could add some
        overlooked item--is utterly false. No church in Hartford
        has asked my aid in any shape. An Art School (as well as I
        remember) asked me through Hartford friends and
        acquaintances, to take part in a public reading, and, as my
        standing contract with my agent requires, I referred them
        to him, and he consented, but they could not accept the
        date he gave them. It is ungentlemanly to say of a person's
        private life "Rumor has it"--thus &amp; so, making the
        issue turn upon the existence of the rumor instead of upon
        its truth. But it is preposterous that my companion and
        friend in our late reading tour should have been made
        uncomfortable by my "parsimony." All the outlays were made
        by the traveling manager, except when for the convenience
        of all concerned I sometimes made small expenditures that
        the manager would afterward pay back to me, and it was a
        standing jest between us that I generally had to prevent
        him cheating himself. The statement that I ordered $5
        breakfasts and the like is all absolutely false. Our stay
        was almost invariably at hotels on the American plan, and
        as to apartments, I never saw mine until it had been
        engaged by the manager, and rarely was &amp; never cared to
        be consulted about it. It is equally false that I rudely
        declined to join in the "Authors" Readings in New York. I
        declined, without rudeness, because it fell at a time when
        I had instructed my agent, on no account and for no
        pecuniary consideration to make any appointment that would
        carry me away from home for a single night, as my wife's
        health did not permit me to leave her side. It is false
        that I am not a loser by the lack of a just copyright law.
        I belong to both the English &amp; American copyright
        leagues, and as far as I know I have contributed to every
        subscription made in America for their objects. It is false
        that I was expected in Hartford or elsewhere the Sunday I
        stopped over in Worcester or that I disappointed anybody.
        If ever anything was exclusively my private business, that
        was. It is true that by the letter of my contract I was,
        under no circumstances to be required to travel much or
        little or any part of Sunday. What I might have chosen to
        concede in case of emergency is also my own private affair.
        It is false that I ever declined to argue the moral
        propriety of writing novels. That I ever this last season
        disappointed an audience in the matter of time or
        attendance is false. It is true that I have been poor. It
        is false that I am unwilling to help others. It is even
        false that I "have resolved to make my future secure." How
        could you suppose your correspondent got that from good
        authority? It is true that I spend little on myself, and
        that I would rather not be so poor as I have been; but I
        give you my word for what it is worth, I would sooner
        starve than get my living--as your correspondent seems
        willing to get his--by slandering unoffending
        gentlemen.<br />
        &nbsp; I have written you thus mainly to facilitate you in
        exacting from him that full explanation and amends which
        you have so promptly promised. I shall await it with
        anxiety.<br />
        &nbsp; The motives of my public utterances have been
        impugned all over one half of this country; but the charges
        were the hot words of people who believed themselves
        aggrieved, and such as public men are generally subject to.
        They are false &amp; injurious, yet they spring from a
        wounded pride in those who make them and I cannot find it
        in my heart to resent them or do anything but wait
        patiently for time to disprove them. But it has been
        reserved, my dear sir, for your correspondent to print in
        the Boston Herald the first careful slander upon my private
        character that I have ever known.<br />
        &nbsp; Be assured I shall be grateful for all the
        expedition you may be able to give this distressing affair,
        and that I hope to remain ever<br />
