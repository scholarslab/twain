        &nbsp; The following correspondence is
        self-explanatory.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; M<font size="-1">ADISON</font>, Jan. 21--<i>Dear Mr.
        Cable:</i> I do not apologize for addressing you thus,
        because you must feel that the stand you have taken for
        justice to my people has turned the heart of humanity
        toward you in admiration for your bravery, in love for your
        kindness. Hundreds of men like myself are living in this
        rigorous climate because of the unfair treatment you so
        eloquently set forth in your article in last month's
        Century magazine, which is our portion at home. You, sir,
        have raised a hope in our bosoms that our old neighbors and
        friends are at last allowing their own hearts to speak for
        us, and that we will soon see the dawn of a brighter day
        for our country and for our children.<br />
        &nbsp; Sir, if you are not inundated with grateful letters
        from colored people, it is not because of any lack of a
        keen sense of appreciation, but, alas! so few of us
        <i>can</i> let you know how we feel toward you; accept
        this, dear sir, as the thanks of the colored people of this
        city, who are only sorry that they have no more able
        representative than your humble servant. A<font size=
        "-1">RTHUR</font> B. L<font size="-1">EE</font>.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; M<font size="-1">ADISON</font>, Wis., Jan.
        28--<i>Mr. Arthur B. Lee</i>--M<font size="-1">Y</font>
        D<font size="-1">EAR</font> S<font size="-1">IR</font>: I
        thank you most heartily for your letter of 21st inst.,
        received only last night. It is a comfort and a reward to
        me. I am proud and grateful to say that I have many such
        from colored men, and also from white men, both north and
        south.<br />
        &nbsp; I am tempted to take the liberty of saying that men
        of color who can write such letters as these, ought to
        write to and for the public; and especially to add that in
        my belief nothing will work more powerfully for the
        <i>special</i> interests of the colored people than for
        such men to make themselves felt in terse, brief, pointed
        utterances upon current topics of <i>general</i> public
        interest,--upon interests common to all. This will be to
        utilize that "touch of nature" that "makes the whole world
        akin."<br />
        &nbsp; When colored men get to writing for white men's
        newspapers from the standpoint of common citizenship and
        mutual interests, then we shall see not one or two or half
        a dozen white men writing in behalf of freedmen's rights,
        but whole communities yielding those rights.<br />
        &nbsp; In short, let all colored men patiently,
        persistently and with all possible intellectual skill
        ignore their African origin and do, say and seek everything
        purely, only and entirely as American citizens, equally
        interested with all other American citizens in <i>all</i>
        the rights of <i>all</i>. I do not, by any means, imply
        that they should overlook colored men's interests and
        rights, but that the part of wisdom is to let the
        greater--at least the larger--include the less. Let colored
        men show such sagacious, active interest in the rights and
        interests of all men, that all men, shall gradually be won
        to regard them as valuable accessions to the community, and
        most valuable when most free.<br />
        &nbsp; Pardon me if my deep interest in the advancement of
        colored men has led me to speak too freely, and believe
        me<br />
