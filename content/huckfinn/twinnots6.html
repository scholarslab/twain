<center>TWAIN AND CABLE.</center>

<p> &nbsp; This evening "Mark Twain" (Samuel L. Clemens) and George W. Cable will appear before a Janesville audience for the first time in their double entertainment.  The Buffalo Times says of them:</p>

<p> &nbsp; A very large and fashionable audience assembled in Concert Hall last night to hear that prince
of humor, Mark Twain (Samuel L. Clemens), and that celebrated novelist, George W. Cable, in
their joint readings.  They went expecting a treat and they got decidedly more than they bargained
for.  A more delighted, amused, thoroughly satisfied audience never filled the auditorium of any
building in Buffalo.  Mark Twain, like old wine, or old friends, seems to improve with age, and his
dry, unconscious, apparently spontaneous humor kept the audience in convulsions of laughter.</p>

<p> &nbsp; Mr. Geo. W. Cable's readings were not one whit less appreciated than were Twain's.  His style of
rendition is different, of course; his genius for description and natural intuition of the exact phases
and character of all men are wonderful, and when his own writings are given with the exactitude
and faithfulness he would have them, his genius and power stand out, and one can easily perceive
the living images molded and shaped by his artist hands and master brain.  Those who have read
Mr. Cable's novels of Southern life, and have fancied they have struck the exact chord, even to the
peculiar Creole <i>patois</i> and Creole life, need to hear the man who conceived the works to
find that, no matter how careful may have been their study, they are somewhat mistaken.</p>
