    <h3>Raoul Innerarity Exhibits His Picture</h3>
  </center><font size="+1">From <b><i>The Grandissimes</i></b>,
  Chapter XIX--</font>

  <p>[Frowenfeld] was about to resume his walk, when there came in,
  or, more strictly speaking, there shot in, a young auburn-curled,
  blue-eyed man, whose adolescent buoyancy, as much as his
  delicate, silver-buckled feet and clothes of perfect fit,
  pronounced him all-pure-Creole. His name, when it was presently
  heard, accounted for the blond type by revealing a Franco-Celtic
  origin.</p>

  <p>"'Sieur Frowenfel'," he said, advancing like a boy coming in
  after recess, "I 'ave somet'ing beauteeful to place in yo'
  window."</p>

  <p>He wheeled half around as he spoke and seized from a naked
  black boy, who at that instant entered, a rectangular object
  enveloped in paper.</p>

  <p>Frowenfeld's window was fast growing to be a place of art
  exhibition. A pair of statuettes, a golden tobacco-box, a costly
  jewel-casket, or a pair of richly gemmed horse-pistols -- the
  property of some ancient gentleman or dame of emaciated fortune,
  and which must be sold to keep up the bravery of good clothes and
  pomade that hid slow starvation, went into the shop-window of the
  ever-obliging apothecary, to be disposed of by <i>tombola</i>.
  And it is worthy of note in passing, concerning the moral
  education of one who proposed to make no conscious compromise
  with any sort of evil, that in this drivelling species of
  gambling he saw nothing hurtful or improper. But "in Frowenfeld's
  window" appeared also articles for simple sale or mere transient
  exhibition; as, for instance, the wonderful tapestries of a blind
  widow of ninety; tremulous little bunches of flowers, proudly
  stated to have been made entirely of the bones of the ordinary
  catfish; others, large and spreading, the sight of which would
  make any botanist fall down "and die as mad as the wild waves
  be," whose ticketed merit was that they were composed exclusively
  of materials produced upon Creole soil; a picture of the
  Ursulines' convent and chapel, done in forty-five minutes by a
  child of ten years, the daughter of the widow Felicie
  Grandissime; and the siege of Troy, in ordinary ink, done
  entirely with the pen, the labor of twenty years, by "a citizen
  of New Orleans." It was natural that these things should come to
  "Frowenfeld's corner," for there, oftener than elsewhere, the
  critics were gathered together. Ah! wonderful men, those critics;
  and, fortunately, we have a few still left.</p>

  <p>The young man with auburn curls rested the edge of his burden
  upon the counter, tore away its wrappings and disclosed a
  painting.</p>

  <p>He said nothing -- with his mouth; but stood at arm's length
  balancing the painting and casting now upon it and now upon
  Joseph Frowenfeld a look more replete with triumph than Caesar's
  three-worded dispatch.</p>

  <p>The apothecary fixed upon it long and silently the gaze of a
  somnambulist. At length he spoke:</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Louisiana rif-using to hanter de h-Union!" replied the
  Creole, with an ecstasy that threatened to burst forth in
  hip-hurrahs.</p>

  <p>Joseph said nothing, but silently wondered at Louisiana's
  anatomy.</p>

  <p>"Gran' subjec'!" said the Creole.</p>

  <p>"Allegorical," replied the hard-pressed apothecary.</p>

  <p>"Allegoricon? No, sir! Allegoricon never saw that pigshoe. If
  you insist to know who make dat pigshoe -- de hartis' stan'
  bif-ore you!"</p>

  <p>"It is your work?"</p>

  <p>"'Tis de work of me, Raoul Innerarity, cousin to de
  distingwish Honore Grandissime. I swear to you, sir, on stack of
  Bible' as 'igh as yo' head!"</p>

  <p>He smote his breast.</p>

  <p>"Do you wish to put it in the window?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, seh."</p>

  <p>"For sale?"</p>

  <p>M. Raoul Innerarity hesitated a moment before replying:</p>

  <p>"'Sieur Frowenfel', I think it is a foolishness to be too
  proud, eh? I want you to say, 'My frien', 'Sieur Innerarity,
  never care to sell anything; 'tis for egshibbyshun'; <i>mais</i>
  -- when somebody look at it, so," the artist cast upon his work a
  look of languishing covetousness, "you say, '<i>foudre
  tonnerre!</i> what de dev'! -- I take dat ris-pon-sibble-ty --
  you can have her for two hun'red fifty dollah!' Better not be too
  proud, eh, 'Sieur Frowenfel'?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Joseph, proceeding to place it in the window,
  his new friend following him about, spaniel-wise; "but you had
  better let me say plainly that it is for sale."</p>

  <p>"Oh -- I don't care -- <i>mais</i> -- my rillation' will never
  forgive me! <i>Mais</i> -- go-ahead-I-don't-care! 'Tis for
  sale."</p>
