          [<i>Just after the tour ended Cable wrote two articles
          for</i> The Century Magazine <i>that provide a way to
          "hear" the slave songs he sang as well as the kind of
          things he said to introduce and explain them to a
          bourgeois audience in the various northern cities visited
          by the tour. I haven't tried to recreate
          Cable's voice, but clicking on the pages of sheet music
          will let you see the way the songs were scored. Both the
          musical notation and the illustrations (by E. W. Kemble,
          the man MT hired to illustrate</i> Huck Finn<i>) are from
          the original</i> Century <i>articles.</i>]</p>

          <h3><i>from</i> The Dance in Place Congo</h3>
        </center>Up at the other end of Orleans street, hid only by
        the old padre's garden and the cathedral, glistens the
        ancient Place d'Armes. In the early days it stood for all
        that was best; the place for political rallying, the retail
        quarter of all fine goods and wares, and at sunset and by
        moonlight the promenade of good society and the haunt of
        true lovers; not only in the military, but also in the most
        unwarlike sense the place of arms, and of hearts and hands,
        and of words tender as well as words noble.

        <p>The Place Congo, at the opposite end of the street, was
        at the opposite end of everything. One was on the highest
        ground; the other on the lowest. The one was the rendezvous
        of the rich man, the master, the military officer--of all
        that went to make up the ruling class; the other of the
        butcher and baker, the raftsman, the sailor, the quadroon,
        the painted girl, and the negro slave. No meaner name could
        be given the spot. The negro was the most despised of human
        creatures and the Congo the plebian among negroes. The
        white man's plaza had the army and navy on its right and
        left, the court-house, the council-hall and the church at
        its back, and the world before it. The black man's was
        outside the rear gate, the poisonous wilderness on three
        sides and the proud man's contumely on its front.</p>

        <p>Before the city overgrew its flimsy palisade walls, and
        closing in about this old stamping-ground gave it set
        bounds, it was known as Congo Plains. There was wide room
        for much field sport, and the Indian villagers of the
        town's outskirts and the lower class of white Creoles made
        it the ground of their wild game of <i>raquette</i>. Sunday
        afternoons were the time for it. Hence, beside these
        diversions there was, notably, another.</p>

        <p>The hour was the slave's term of momentary liberty, and
        his simple, savage, musical and superstitious nature
        dedicated it to amatory song and dance tinctured with his
        rude notions of supernatural influences.</p>
        <hr width="30%" />

        <center>
          <b>THE CALINDA.</b>
        </center>

        <p><img src="calas.gif" align="left" hspace="8" alt="CENTURY MAGAZINE ILLUSTRATION" /> There
        were other dances. Only a few years ago I was honored with
        an invitation, which I had to decline, to see danced the
        Babouille, the Cata (or Chacta), the Counjaille, and the
        Calinda. Then there were the Voudou, and the Congo, to
        describe which would not be pleasant. The latter, called
        Congo also in Cayenne, Chica in San Domingo, and in the
        Windward Islands confused under one name with the Calinda,
        was a kind of Fandango, they say, in which the Madras
        kerchief held by its tip-ends played a graceful part.</p>

        <p>The true Calinda was bad enough. In Louisiana, at least,
        its song was always a grossly personal satirical ballad,
        and it was the favorite dance all the way from there to
        Trinidad. To dance it publicly is not allowed this side the
        West Indies. All this Congo Square business was suppressed
        at one time; 1843, says tradition.</p>

        <p>The Calinda was a dance of multitude, a sort of vehement
        cotillion. The contortions of the encircling crowd were
        strange and terrible, the din was hideous. One Calinda is
        still familiar to all Creole ears; it has long been a
        vehicle for the white Creole's satire; for generations the
        man of municipal politics was fortunate who escaped
        entirely a lampooning set to its air.</p>

        <p>In my childhood I used, at one time, to hear, every
        morning, a certain black <i>marchande des
        calas</i>--peddler-woman selling rice croquettes--chanting
        the song as she moved from street to street at the sunrise
        hour with her broad, shallow, laden basket balanced on her
        head.<br clear="left" /></p>

        <center>
          <img src="creole2.jpg" vspace="9" alt="CENTURY MAGAZINE ILLUSTRATION" />
        </center>In other words, a certain Judge Preval gave a
        ball--not an outdoor Congo dance--and made such Cuffees as
        could pay three dollars a ticket. It doesn't rhyme, but it
        was probably true. "Dance, dance the Calind&aacute;!
        Boujoum! Boujoum!"

        <p>The number of stanzas has never been counted; here are a
        few of them.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              "Dans l'equirie la 'y' av&eacute; grand gala;<br />
              Mo cr&eacute; choual la y&eacute; t b'en
              &eacute;tonn&eacute;.

              <p>Mich&eacute; Preval, li t&eacute; capitaine
              bal;<br />
              So cocher Louis, t&eacute; maite
              c&eacute;r&eacute;monie.</p>

              <p>Y av&eacute; des n&eacute;gresse belle
              pass&eacute; maitresse,<br />
              Qui vol&eacute; bel-bel dans l'ormoire momselle.</p>

              <p>. . . . . .</p>

              <p>Ala maite la geole li trouv&eacute; si
              drole,<br />
              Li dit, "moin aussi, mo f&eacute; bal ici."</p>

              <p>Ouatchman la y&eacute; y&eacute; tomb&eacute; la
              dans;<br />
              Y&eacute; f&eacute; gran' d&eacute;ga dans
              l&eacute;quirie la." etc.</p>
            </blockquote>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>"It was in a stable that they had this gala
        night," says the song; "the horses there were greatly
        astonished. Preval was captain; his coachman, Louis, was
        master of ceremonies. There were negresses made prettier
        than their mistresses by adornments stolen from the ladies'
        wardrobes (<i>armoires</i>). But the jailer found it all so
        funny that he proposed to himself to take an unexpected
        part; the watchmen came down"--

        <p>No official exaltation bought immunity from the jeer of
        the Calinda. Preval was a magistrate. Stephen Mazureau, in
        his attorney-general's office, the song likened to a
        bull-frog in a bucket of water. A page might be covered by
        the roll of victims. The masters winked at these gross but
        harmless liberties and, as often as any others, <a name="b"
        id="b">added stanzas</a> of their own invention.</p>

        <p><a href="cablauror.html"><img src="2aurore.jpg" align=
        "left" hspace="8" alt="CENTURY MAGAZINE ILLUSTRATION" /></a> The Calinda ended these
        dissipations of the summer Sabbath afternoons. They could
        not run far into the night, for all the fascinations of all
        the dances could not excuse the slave's tarrying in public
        places after a certain other <i>bou-djoum</i>! (that was
        not of the Calinda, but of the regular nine-o'clock evening
        gun) had rolled down Orleans street from the Place d'Armes;
        and the black man or woman who wanted to keep a whole skin
        on the back had to keep out of the Calaboose. Times have
        changed, and there is nothing to be regretted in the change
        that has come over Congo Square. Still a glamour hangs over
        its dark past. There is the pathos of slavery, the poetry
        of the weak oppressed by the strong, and of limbs that
        danced after toil, and of barbaric love-making. The rags
        and semi-nakedness, the bamboula drum, the dance, and
        almost the banjo, are gone; but the <i>bizarre</i> melodies
        and dark lovers' apostrophes live on; and among them the
        old Counjaille song of Aurore Prad&egrave;re</p>

        <center>
          <h3><i>from</i> Creole Slave Songs</h3>
        </center><img src="lovesong.gif" align="right" hspace=
        "6" alt="CENTURY MAGAZINE ILLUSTRATION" /> One of the best of these Creole love-songs--one that
        the famed Gottschalk, himself a New Orleans Creole of pure
        blood, made use of--is the tender lament of one who sees
        the girl of his heart's choice the victim of chagrin in
        beholding a female rival wearing those vestments of extra
        quality that could only be the favors which both women had
        coveted from the hand of some one in the proud master-caste
        whence alone such favors could come. "Calalou," says the
        song, "has an embroidered petticoat, and Lolotte, or Zizi,"
        as it is often sung, "has a--heartache." Calalou, here, I
        take to be a derisive nickname. Originally it is the term
        for a West Indian dish, a noted ragout. It must be intended
        to apply here to the quadroon women who swarmed into New
        Orleans in 1809 as refugees from Cuba, Guadeloupe, and
        other islands where the war against Napoleon exposed them
        to Spanish and British aggression. It was with this great
        influx of persons neither savage nor enlightened, neither
        white nor black, neither slave nor truly free, that the
        famous quadroon caste arose and flourished. If Calalou, in
        the verse, was one of these quadroon fair ones, <a name="c"
        id="c">the song</a> is its own explanation.

        <p><a href="cablzizi.html"><img src="2zizi.jpg" align=
        "left" hspace="8" alt="CENTURY MAGAZINE ILLUSTRATION" /></a>"Poor little Miss Zizi!" is what it
        means--"She has pain, pain in her little heart." "&Agrave;
        li" is simply the Creole possessive form; "corps &agrave;
        moin" would signify simply myself. Calalou is wearing a
        Madras turban; she has on an embroidered petticoat; [they
        tell their story and] Zizi has achings in her heart. And
        the second stanza moralizes: "When you wear the chain of
        love"--maybe we can make it rhyme:</p>

        <center>
          <font size="-1">"When love's chains upon thee lie<br />
          Bid all happiness good-bye."</font>
        </center>Poor little Zizi! say we also. Triumphant Calalou!
        We see that even her sort of freedom had its tawdry
        victories at the expense of the slave. A poor freedom it
        was, indeed: To have f. m. c. or f. w. c. tacked in small
        letters upon one's name perforce and by law, that all might
        know that the bearer was not a real freeman or freewoman,
        but only a free man (or woman) of color,--a title that
        could not be indicated by capital initials; to be the
        unlawful mates of luxurious bachelors, and take their pay
        in muslins, embroideries, prunella, and good living, taking
        with them the loathing of honest women and the salacious
        derision of the blackamoor; to be the sister, mother,
        father, or brother of Calalou; to fall heir to property by
        sufferance, not by law; to be taxed for public education
        and not allowed to give that education to one's own
        children; to be shut out of all occupations that the master
        class could reconcile with the vague title of gentleman; to
        live in the knowledge that the law pronounced "death or
        imprisonment at hard labor for life" against whoever should
        be guilty of "writing, printing, publishing, or
        distributing anything having a tendency to create
        discontent among the free colored population": that it
        threatened death against whosoever should utter such things
        in private conversation; and that it decreed expulsion from
        the State to Calalou and all her kin of any age or
        condition if only they had come in across its bounds since
        1807. In the enjoyment of such ghastly freedom as this the
        flesh-pots of Egypt sometimes made the mouth water and
        provoked the tongue to sing its regrets for a past that
        seemed better than the present.
