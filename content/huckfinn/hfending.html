          <p>Well Tom he fixed up a coat of arms for Jim &amp; a lot
          of mournful inscriptions for him to scratch on the wall,
          but Jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a
          lot of truck onto the logs with a nail. Then Tom says:</p>

          <p>"Come to think, the logs ain't agoing to do; they
          don't have log walls in a dungeon; we got to dig the
          mournful inscriptions into a rock. We'll fetch a

          <p>Jim said it would take him such a pison long time to
          dig them into a rock, he wouldn't ever get out. But it
          had to be done. Tom says:</p>

          <p>"I know how to fix it. We got to have a rock, and we
          can kill two birds with that same rock. There's a gaudy
          big grindstone down at the mill, and we'll smouch it, and

          <p><font color="#99333">"Yes -- easy enough. Every animal

          <p>In the morning we went up to the village and bought a
          wire rat trap and fetched it down, and unstopped the best
          hole, and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest
          kind of ones; and then we took it and put it in a safe
          place under Aunt Sally's bed. But while we was gone for
          spiders, little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson
          Elexander Phelps found it there, and opened the door of
          it to see if the rats would come out, and they did; and
          Aunt Sally come in, and when we got back she was a
          skippin' &amp; a scallopin' around on the bed tryin' to
          turn herself inside out. You never <i>see</i> a body act
          so, and the rats was doing what they could to make it
          sociable for her. So she took and dusted us with the
          hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching another
          fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they
          warn't the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was
          the pick of the communion. I never see a likelier lot of

          allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near
          all right again, but couldn't set down convenient -- that
          warn't no matter, didn't have <i>time</i> to set down.
          And so we went for the snakes, and grabbed a couple dozen
          garters and house-snakes, and put them in a bag, and put
          it in our room, and by that time it was supper time, and
          a rattling good honest day's work; and hungry? -- oh, no,
          I reckon not! And there warn't a blessed snake up there,
          when we went back -- we didn't half tie the sack, and
          they worked out somehow, and left. But it didn't matter
          much, because they was still on the premises somewheres.
          So we judged we could get some of them again. No, there
          warn't no scarcity of snakes about the house for a
          considerable spell. You'd see them dripping from the
          rafters and places, every now and then; and when you
          warn't expectin 'em they'd come down ker-<i>whop</i> in
          your plate, or down the back of your neck, and very often
          where you didn't want them. Well, they was handsome, and
          striped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them;
          but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally, she
          despised snakes, be the denomination what they might, and
          somehow she, well she couldn't stand them no way; and
          every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn't
          make no difference what she was doing, she would just lay
          that work down and light out. I never see such a woman.
          And you could hear her whoop to Jericho. You couldn't get
          her to take aholt of one of them with the tongs. And if
          she turned over in the night and found one in bed, the
          way she would scramble out o' that and lift a howl that
          you would think the house was afire. She <i>could</i>
          make more fuss over a little thing. She disturbed the old
          man so, that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever
          been no snakes created. Why, after every last snake had
          been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week,
          Aunt Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't near over it;
          when she was sitting thinking about something, you could
          just take a frog or something cold &amp; touch her on the
          back of the neck with a feather and she would jump right
          out of her stockings. It was very curious. But Tom said
          all women was just so. He said they was made that way;
          for some reason or other.</p>

          <p>If you b'lieve me, we got a licking every time one of
          our snakes come in her way; and she allowed these
          lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever
          loaded up the place again with them. I didn't mind the
          lickings, because they didn't amount to nothing; but I
          minded the trouble we had, to lay in another lot. But we

          a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd all swarm
          out for the music and go for him. Jim didn't like the
          spiders, and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd
          lay for him and make it mighty sultry for him. Well it
          was beautiful to see. And he said that between the rats,
          and the snakes, and the grindstone, there warn't no room
          in bed for him, skasely; and when there was, a body
          couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was always
          lively, he said, because <i>they</i> never all slept at
          one time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was
          asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats turned in
          the snakes come on watch, so he always had one gang under
          him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over
          him, and if he got up to hunt a new place, the spiders
          would take a shy at him as he crossed over. Well, he,
          well he was kinder dissatisfied. He said if he ever got
          out, this time, he wouldn't ever be a prisoner again, not
          for a salary.</p>

          <p>Well, by the end of the three weeks, everything was in

          <p>"Warnings to the people that something is up. It's
          done one way in the books, sometimes another. But there's
          always somebody spying around, that gives notice to the
          governor of the castle."</p>

          <p>"But looky here, Tom, what do we want to <i>warn</i>
          anybody for, that something's up. Let them find it out
          for themselves -- let 'em take care of the nigger
          themselves -- it's their lookout."</p>

          <p>"Yes, I know that; but you can't depend on them. It's
          the way they've acted from the very start -- left us to
          do <i>everything</i>. They're so confiding and
          mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all.
          So if we don't <i>give</i> them notice, there won't be
          nobody nor nothing to interfere with us, and so after all
          our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go off
          perfectly flat: -- won't be no excitement -- won't amount
          to nothing -- won't be nothing <i>to</i> it."</p>

          <p>"Well, as for me, Tom Sawyer, when <i>I</i>'m sett'n a
          runaway nigger free, that's the way I'd like."</p>

          next night another one of a coffin on the back door. I
          never see a family in such a sweat. They couldn't a been
          worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts
          laying for them behind everything and under the beds and
          shivering through the air. If a door banged, Aunt Sally
          she jumped and said "ouch!" if anything fell, she jumped
          and said "ouch!" if you happened to touch her, when she
          warn't noticing, she done the same; she couldn't face
          noway and be satisfied, because she allowed there was
          something behind her every time -- so she was always
          a-whirling around sudden, and saying "ouch," and before
          she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl back again, and
          say it again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she
          dasn't set up. So the thing was working very well, Tom
          said; he said he never see a thing work more
          satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.</font></p>

          <p><font color="#99333">So he said, now for the grand bulge! So the very next
          morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter

          because we heard them say at supper they was going to
          have a nigger on watch at both doors all night. Tom he
          went down the lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger
          at the back door was asleep, and he stuck it in the back
          of his neck and come back. This letter said:</font></p>

          got up, nearly midnight, &amp; Tom told me to sneak down
          cellar &amp; hook a lunch. And then mosey right down the
          lightning-rod and come along to the cabin, and said "I'll
          go and be ready to <i>ba</i> like a sheep and shove out
          with Jim soon as you get there."</p>

          <p>So down the rod he went, and down cellar went I. I got

          <p>So she went away as I opened the door and walked into
          the sitting-room. My, but there was a crowd in there!
          Fifteen farmers, and every one of them had a gun. I was
          most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down.
          They was setting around, some of them talking a little,
          in a low voice, and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but
