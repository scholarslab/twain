        <font size="+1">C</font>HICAGO, Jan. 18 -- George W. Cable,
        the author, in speaking of the criticisms on his recent
        paper, "The Freedman's Case in Equity," said that while
        many found fault with his views favoring a higher
        civilization of the colored race, and their complete
        enjoyment of social, religious and political rights, others
        indorsed his theory, and so expressed themselves in
        numerous letters. He believed that the more intelligent
        element of the South favored the improvement of the colored
        people, and that the intelligent element was gradually
        taking the lead in all important matters. He thought that
        the rapid increase of the negroes as compared with the
        increase of the whites in the South rendered some decisive
        acts looking to the higher civilization of the colored
        people a necessity of the hour. Concerning the embittered
        protest of the Southern press regarding his plea for the
        colored race, Mr. Cable said: "It is as if you had kicked a
        bee hive and the bees had rushed out to see what damage was
        done, and what was going to come of it. In this connection
        there is a point I must make regarding the newspapers of
        the South. Nine-tenths of the Southern people are voiced by
        a lot of job-printers." This criticism Mr. Cable explained
        by saying that the country press, not enjoying a large
        support, had not the means to employ that intelligence in
        its management which was representative of the true spirit
        in the South. To show the growth of this change Mr. Cable
        said: "Two years ago I spoke at the University of
        Mississippi. When I finished they crowded around to grasp
        my hand, and they told me that had I attempted to say those
        things a few years ago I should have been stopped before I
        finished my remarks." Mr. Cable said that there is one
        promise he regards as unalterably fixed, and that is that
        6,000,000 of negroes of the South are there and cannot be
        deported, and are increasing in the ratio to the whites of
        35 to 22. He admitted that he was apprehensive, unless
        immediate steps were taken for the education of the
        negroes.
