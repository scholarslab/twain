<center><b>"TWAIN" AND CABLE.</b></center>
<br />

The Twain-Cable combination was greeted last night by the largest "downstairs"
audience that has assembled in the Opera House this season, and it is safe to
say that few audiences have congregated there composed of more intelligent and
cultivated people.  The entertainment was all that was promised, and the audience
testified their delight by numerous bursts of laughter and applause.  "Mark Twain's"
first peek-a-boo at R.1.E. was greeted with laughter, and his droll recitations of
his own funny stories tickled his hearers prodigiously. Mr. Cable's readings were
so unlike Twain's stories that a pleasing contrast was formed.  His selections from
his own novel, "Dr. Sevier," were given with wondrous grace and effect, captivating
the audience and winning genuine applause.  His graphic description of "Mary's Night
Ride" was realistic in the extreme, while Twain's final effort, a ghost story, was
impressive as well as vehemently ludicrous.  The combination is a strong one, and
with a good management, "there is millions in it" for both the actors and their manager.<br /><br />
