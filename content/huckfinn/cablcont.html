          <h3>Southern Appreciation of Mr. Cable.</h3>
        </center><font size="-1">Washington Special.</font><br />
        Two Southern Democrats at the capital yesterday were
        discussing current literary topics, when one of the
        suddenly asked: "Have you seen Gable's article in the
        Century?"

        <p>"No," replied the other. "What is the article about, and
        who the blank is Gable?"</p>

        <p>"Oh," said the first Democrat savagely, "it is an
        article in favor of the 'nigger,' and full of abuse and
        lies about the Southern people. Haven't you heard of Gable?
        George W. Gable is his name. He is that New Orleans man who
        writes books and goes around the country reading them in
        public. He brags that his grandfather and father were both
        slaveholders, and then says that it was not their fault,
        that they did not know any better. The article would be bad
        enough if it had been written by a Northern man; coming
        from a Southern man it is an insult."</p>

        <p>"Well, I do not want to read it. I should think Gable
        would emigrate to the North and stay there. We have no use
        for such men in the South."</p>

        <p>It is evident that these indignant Southerners do not
        appreciate <a name="a">Mr. Cable's</a> literary efforts.</p><br />

          <h3>THE EQUALITY OF THE NEGRO.</h3><br />
<b>MR. CABLE AND THE RABID SOUTHERNERS.</b></center>

<p>George W. Cable and "Mark Twain" arrived at the Pacific yesterday from Burlington, Ia.
 The latter has not been in the city since he replied to his famous toast on "Babies" at
the Grant banquet five years ago.  Mr. Cable has lately been having quite a one-sided
contest with the Bourbon element in the South over an article which appeared in the January
<i>Century</i> advocating the political equality of the negro as a matter of prudence and
equity.  He has been literally belabored with invective and abuse, disowned as a Southerner,
the merit of his novels decried, and, in fact, so viciously treated by those who are either
frightened or angered at his statements and predictions regarding the present condition of
the South that he is rather disposed to strike back at his critics.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival he found a small stack of letters awaiting him, which lay upon the table
when a T<font size="-1">RIBUNE</font> reporter called later in the day.  "All of them," said
Mr. Cable, "are from people in the South, containing words of sympathy and encouragement relative
to my article in the <i>Century</i> on 'The Freedman's Case in Equity.'  They are from whites as
well as blacks--from people living in all parts of the South."</p>

<p>Taking up some of the letters at random, which happened to be from colored writers, Mr. Cable's
voice grew husky as passages characteristically eloquent in praise were read.</p>

<p>"Of course," said he, of the rabid position of the larger part of the Southern press, "this
personal abuse is disagreeable and hurts me, as it would any man; but I hail it with joy as compared
with the silence of a fortress, which shows it to be either impregnable or impassive.  The frightful
hubbub the advocacy of political rights for the blacks has aroused, is, in itself, a good sign that
the unprogressive element of the South is alarmed.  I believe that the best intelligence of the South
agrees with the spirit of the article.  Professors in colleges, teachers, preachers, many professional
men--the intelligence that quietly predominates everywhere ultimately--are certainly sloughing traditional
tendencies and molding a new South.  The press of the South, outside of the larger cities, does not
represent this better intelligence.  The country papers, mostly edited by printers and published in
sparsely-populated regions, get their support from and pander to the lower grades of society, which are
the most intolerant and harsh to the black man.  Their abuse was to be expected by any man pleading
for equity in his cause."</p>

<p>Requested to outline the future of the South, Mr. Cable said he saw it "great and wonderful, but
vague."  He had great fears of the outcome of the great problem.  In fifteen years more, under the
present r&eacute;gime, the blacks would outnumber the whites in every State from Virginia to the east line
of Texas.  With the ratio of increase two to three and a half in favor of the negro, he could afford to
wait.  The urgency for action rests with the whites.  It was a struggle in which the under man was
increasingly in strength marvelously each decade.  The question must be met.  It could not be always
postponed.</p>

<p>"But American progress has always outrun anticipation," Mr. Cable continued.  "Who could have supposed
a few years ago that Beecher, the Abolitionist, would have been offered $2,000 for three lectures in New
Orleans?  Garrison, Sumner, Greeley, all were surprised to see in their lifetime the fulfillment of their
anticipations.  In places where I have lectured I have been listened to with close attention, receiving
warm commendations, where five years before such sentiments would not have gone unreproved."</p>
