OPERA HOUSE.&mdash;It is to be regretted that "Mark Twain" and Mr. George W.
Cable were greeted by such a deplorably small audience at the Opera
House last Friday.  It was a reflection upon the literary taste of our
people that so few were eager to come face to face with these popular
American writers.  Mr. Cable's readings were entirely from his latest
novel, "Dr. Sevier," and were introduced with one of the wild,
incoherent but musical Creole songs sung years ago in the Place Congo,
New Orleans, by the African slaves.  The readings introduced Narcisse,
John and Mary Richling, Ristofalo and Mrs. Riley, those well remembered
personages in his novel.  Mr. Cable has a sympathetic voice and much
dramatic spirit.  His recitation of Mary's thrilling night ride through
the forest, pursued by rebel scouts, was vividly portrayed.  "Mark
Twain" -- who looks just like his published portrait, except that he has
grown gray-haired with the weight of remorse for the things he has
written -- read several of his excruciatingly funny sketches.  They gained
added humor by the tone and manner in which the author read them, and
set the audience in a gale of laughter.  The only thing to regret about
the whole evening was that there were so few there to enjoy the literary
treat presented.<br /><br />
