          <p>It is little wonder that Mr. Samuel Clemens, otherwise
          Mark Twain, resorted to real or mock lawsuits, as may be,
          to restrain some real or imaginary selling of "The
          Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" as a means of advertising
          that extraordinarily senseless publication. Before the
          work is disposed of, Mr. Mark Twain will probably have to
          resort to law to compel some to sell it by any sort of
          bribery or corruption. It is doubtful if the edition
          could be disposed of to people of average intellect at
          anything short of the point of the bayonet. This
          publication rejoices in two frontispieces, of which the
          one is supposed to be a faithful portrait of Huckleberry
          Finn, and the other an engraving of the classic features
          of Mr. Mark Twain as seen in the bust made by Karl
          Gerhardt. The taste of this gratuitous presentation is as
          bad as is the book itself, which is an extreme statement.
          Mr. Clemens has contributed some humorous literature that
          is excellent and will hold its place, but his Huckleberry
          Finn appears to be singularly flat, stale and
          unprofitable. The book is sold by subscription.</p>
