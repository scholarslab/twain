          <h3>Freedom of Discussion</h3>
        </center>Thoughtful and unpartisan observers of the
        Southern situation have long been watching with interest
        the signs which show that the South is emerging from
        provincialism into a genuine spirit of nationality and of
        intellectual freedom. The great test of this advance is the
        growing liberty of opinion, as manifested in the press and
        on the platform, and in other quarters as well. Without
        this liberty of opinion there can be, of course, no genuine
        solution of any social or political question whatever -- in
        the South or anywhere else.

        <p>No essay on the subject of the freedmen published for
        many years has attracted wider attention than Mr. Cable's
        "The Freedman's Case in Equity," in the January
        <i>Century</i>. The reception of this essay in the Southern
        States (though not unaccompanied by some amusing reminders
        of the good old-fashioned bowie-knife and fire-eating days)
        would seem to be a new proof that the Southern people admit
        of the honest and free discussion of burning questions in a
        manner which has not always been characteristic of that
        section. Not only does the South admit the distasteful
        opinions of thinkers from other sections, but, what is
        still more noticeable, it is increasingly tolerant of
        differences of opinion among its own writers. When one
        considers the intolerance recently manifested in the North
        and West in the matter of political independence, and the
        spirit of "boycotting" shown toward certain Northern
        leaders and periodicals, and when one sees this new
        attitude of Southern newspapers and leaders, one has food
        for reflection. Evidently a great many changes have taken
        place in this country during the past twenty years.</p>

        <p>A number of more or less dissenting essays and "Open
        Letters" have come to us from the South since the
        publication of Mr. Cable's last article, but we have
        thought best to confine the reply, at present, to a single
        representative essay of some length, which is now in
        preparation, and which will appear in an early number of
        the <i>Century</i>.</p>

          <h3>In Plain Black and White:</h3>
        </center>

        <center>
          <h3>A Reply to Mr. Cable</h3>
        </center>It is strange that during the discussion of the
        negro question, which has been wide and pertinent, no one
        has stood up to speak the mind of the South. In this
        discussion there has been much of truth and more of error
        -- something of perverseness, but more of misapprehension
        -- not a little of injustice, but perhaps less of mean
        intention.

        <p>Amid it all, the South has been silent.</p>

        <p>There has been, perhaps, good reason for this silence.
        The problem under debate is a tremendous one. Its right
        solution means peace, prosperity, and happiness to the
        South. A mistake, even in the temper in which it is
        approached or the theory upon which its solution is
        attempted, would mean detriment, that at best would be
        serious, and might easily be worse. Hence the South has
        pondered over this problem, earnestly seeking with all her
        might the honest and the safe way out of its entanglements,
        and saying little because there was but little to which she
        felt safe in committing herself. Indeed, there was another
        reason why she did not feel called upon to obtrude her
        opinions. The people of the North, proceeding by the right
        of victorious arms, had themselves undertaken to settle the
        negro question. From the Emancipation Proclamation to the
        Civil Rights Bill they hurried with little let or
        hindrance, holding the negro in the meanwhile under a sort
        of tutelage, from part in which his former masters were
        practically excluded. Under this state of things the South
        had little to do but watch and learn.</p>

        <p>We have now passed fifteen years of experiment. Certain
        broad principles have been established as wise and just.
        The South has something to say which she can say with
        confidence. There is no longer impropriety in her speaking
        or lack of weight in her words. The people of the United
        States have, by their suffrages, remitted to the Southern
        people, temporarily at least, control of the race question.
        The decision of the Supreme Court on the Civil Rights Bill
        leaves practically to their adjustment important issues
        that were, until that decision was rendered, covered by
        straight and severe enactment. These things deepen the
        responsibility of the South, increase its concern, and
        confront it with a problem to which it must address itself
        promptly and frankly. Where it has been silent, it now
        should speak. The interest of every American in the
        honorable plain and equitable settlement of this question
        is second only to the interest of those specially -- and
        fortunately, we believe -- charged with its adjustment.
        "What will you do with it?" is a question any man may now
        ask the South, and to which the South should make frank and
        full reply.</p>

        <p>It is important that this reply shall be plain and
        straightforward. Above all things it must carry the genuine
        convictions of the people it represents. On this subject
        and at this time the South cannot afford to be
        misunderstood. Upon the clear and general apprehension of
        her position and of her motives and purpose everything
        depends. She cannot let pass unchallenged a single
        utterance that, spoken in her name, misstates her case or
        her intention. It is to protest against just such injustice
        that this article is written.</p>

        <p>In a lately printed article, Mr. George W. Cable,
        writing in the name of the Southern people, confesses
        judgment on points that they still defend, and commits them
        to a line of thought from which they must forever dissent.
        In this article, as in his works, the singular tenderness
        and beauty of which have justly made him famous, Mr. Cable
        is sentimental rather than practical. But the reader,
        enchained by the picturesque style and misled by the
        engaging candor with which the author admits the
        shortcomings of "We of the South," and the kindling
        enthusiasm with which he tells how "We of the South" must
        make reparation, is apt to assume that it is really the
        soul of the South that breathes through Mr. Cable's
        repentant sentences. It is not my purpose to discuss Mr.
        Cable's relations to the people for whom he claims to
        speak. Born in the South, of Northern parents, he appears
        to have had little sympathy with his Southern environment,
        as in 1882 he wrote, "To be in New England would be enough
        for me. I was there once, -- a year ago, -- and it seemed
        as if I had never been home till then." It will be
        suggested that a man so out of harmony with his neighbors
        as to say, even after he had fought side by side with them
        on the battle-field, that he never felt at home until he
        had left them, cannot speak understandingly of their views
        on so vital a subject as that under discussion. But it is
        with his statement rather than his personality that we have
        to deal. Does he truly represent the South? We reply that
        he does not! There may be here and there in the South a
        dreaming theorist who subscribes to Mr. Cable's teachings.
        We have seen no signs of one. Among the thoughtful men of
        the South, -- the men who felt that all brave men might
        quit fighting when General Lee surrendered, -- who,
        enshrining in their hearts the heroic memories of the cause
        they had lost, in good faith accepted the arbitrament of
        the sword to which they had appealed, -- who bestirred
        themselves cheerfully amid the ruins of their homes, and
        set about the work of rehabilitation, -- who have patched
        and mended and builded anew, and fashioned out of pitiful
        resource a larger prosperity than they ever knew before, --
        who have set their homes on the old red hills, and staked
        their honor and prosperity and the peace and well-being of
        the children who shall come after them on the clear and
        equitable solution of every social, industrial, or
        political problem that concerns the South, -- among these
        men, who control and will continue to control, I do know,
        there is general protest against Mr. Cable's statement of
        the case, and universal protest against his suggestions for
        the future. The mind of these men I shall attempt to speak,
        maintaining my right to speak for them with the pledge
        that, having exceptional means for knowing their views on
        this subject, and having spared no pains to keep fully
        informed thereof, I shall write down nothing in their name
        on which I have found even a fractional difference of
        opinion.</p>

        <p>A careful reading of Mr. Cable's article discloses the
        following argument: The Southern people have deliberately
        and persistently evaded the laws forced on them for the
        protection of the freedman; this evasion has been the
        result of prejudices born of and surviving the institution
        of slavery, the only way to remove which is to break down
        every distinction between the races; and now the best
        thought of the South, alarmed at the withdrawal of the
        political machinery that forced the passage of the
        protective laws, which withdrawal tempts further and more
        intolerable evasions, is moving to forbid all further
        assortment of the races and insist on their intermingling
        in all places and in all relations. The first part of this
        argument is a matter of record, and, from the Southern
        stand-point, mainly a matter of reputation. It can bide its
        time. The suggestion held in its conclusion is so
        impossible, so mischievous, and, in certain aspects, so
        monstrous, that it must be met at once.</p>

        <p>It is hard to think about the negro with exactness. His
        helplessness, his generations of enslavement, his unique
        position among the peoples of the earth, his distinctive
        color, his simple, lovable traits, -- all these combine to
        hasten opinion into conviction where he is the subject of
        discussion. Three times has this tendency brought about
        epochal results in his history. First, it abolished
        slavery. For this all men are thankful, even those who,
        because of the personal injustice and violence of the means
        by which it was brought about, opposed its accomplishment.
        Second, it made him a voter. This, done more in a sense of
        reparation than in judgment, is as final as the other. The
        North demanded it; the South expected it; all acquiesced in
        it, and, wise or unwise, it will stand. Third, it fixed by
        enactment his social and civil rights. And here for the
        first time the revolution faltered. Up to this point the
        way had been plain, the light clear, and the march at
        quick-step. Here the line halted. The way was lost; there
        was hesitation, division, and uncertainty. Knowing not
        which way to turn, and enveloped in doubt, the
        revolutionists heard the retreat sounded by the Supreme
        Court with small reluctance, and, to use Mr. Cable's words,
        "bewildered by complication, vexed by many a blunder,"
        retired from the field. See, then, the progress of this
        work. The first step, right by universal agreement, would
        stand if the law that made it were withdrawn. The second
        step, though irrevocable, raises doubts as to its wisdom.
        The third, wrong in purpose, has failed in execution. It
        stands denounced as null by the highest court, as
        inoperative by general confession, and as unwise by popular
        verdict. Let us take advantage of this halt in the too
        rapid revolution, and see exactly where we stand and what
        is best for us to do. The situation is critical. The next
        moment may formulate the work of the next twenty years. The
        tremendous forces of the revolution, unspent and still
        terrible, are but held in arrest. Launch them mistakenly,
        chaos may come. Wrong-headedness may be as fatal now as
        wrong-heartedness. Clear views, clear statement, and clear
        understanding are the demands of the hour. Given these, the
        common sense and courage of the American people will make
        the rest easy.</p>

        <p>Let it be understood in the beginning, then, that the
        South will never adopt Mr. Cable's suggestion of the social
        intermingling of the races. It can never be driven into
        accepting it. So far from there being a growing sentiment
        in the South in favor of the indiscriminate mixing of the
        races, the intelligence of both races is moving farther
        from that proposition day by day. It is more impossible (if
        I may shade a superlative) now than it was ten years ago;
        it will be less possible ten years hence. Neither race
        wants it. The interest, as the inclination, of both races
        is against it. Here the issue with Mr. Cable is made up. He
        denounces any assortment of the races as unjust and demands
        that white and black shall intermingle everywhere. The
        South replies that the assortment of the races is wise and
        proper, and stands on the platform of equal accommodation
        for each race, but separate.</p>

        <p>The difference is an essential one. Deplore or defend it
        as we may, an antagonism is bred between the races when
        they are forced into mixed assemblages. This sinks out of
        sight, if not out of existence, when each race moves in its
        own sphere. Mr. Cable admits this feeling, but doubts that
        it is instinctive. In my opinion it is instinctive --
        deeper than prejudice or pride, and bred in the bone and
        blood. It would make itself felt even in sections where
        popular prejudice runs counter to its manifestation. If in
        any town in Wisconsin or Vermont there was equal population
        of whites and blacks, and schools, churches, hotels, and
        theaters were in common, this instinct would assuredly
        develop; the races would separate, and each race would
        hasten the separation. Let me give an example that touches
        this supposition closely. Bishop Gilbert Haven, of the
        Methodist Episcopal Church, many years ago came to the
        South earnestly, and honestly, we may believe, devoted to
        breaking up the assortment of the races. He was backed by
        powerful influences in the North. He was welcomed by
        resident Northerners in the South (then in control of
        Southern affairs) as an able and eloquent exponent of their
        views. His first experiment toward mixing the races was
        made in the church -- surely the most propitious field.
        Here the fraternal influence of religion emphasized his
        appeals for the brotherhood of the races. What was the
        result? After the first month his church was decimated. The
        Northern whites and the Southern blacks left it in squads.
        The dividing influences were mutual. The stout bishop
        contended with prayer and argument and threat against the
        inevitable, but finally succumbed. Two separate churches
        were established, and each race worshiped to itself. There
        had been no collision, no harsh words, no discussion even.
        Each race simply obeyed its instinct, that spoke above the
        appeal of the bishop and dominated the divine influences
        that pulsed from pew to pew. Time and again did the bishop
        force the experiment. Time and again he failed. At last he
        was driven to the confession that but one thing could
        effect what he had tried so hard to bring about, and that
        was miscegenation. A few years of experiment would force
        Mr. Cable to the same conclusion.</p>

        <p>The same experiment was tried on a larger scale by the
        Methodist Episcopal Church (North) when it established its
        churches in the South after the war. It essayed to bring
        the races together, and in its conferences and its churches
        there was no color line. Prejudice certainly did not
        operate to make a division here. On the contrary, the
        whites and blacks of this church were knit together by
        prejudice, pride, sentiment, political and even social
        policy. Underneath all this was a race instinct, obeying
        which, silently, they drifted swiftly apart. While white
        Methodists of the church North and of the church South,
        distant from each other in all but the kinship of race and
        worship, were struggling to effect once more a union of the
        churches that had been torn apart by a quarrel over
        slavery, so that in every white conference and every white
        church on all this continent white Methodists could stand
        in restored brotherhood, the Methodist Church (North)
        agreed, without serious protest, to a separation of its
        Southern branch into two conferences of whites and of
        blacks, and into separate congregations where the
        proportion of either race was considerable. Was it without
        reason -- it certainly was not through prejudice -- that
        this church, while seeking anew fusion with its late
        enemies, consented to separate from its new friends?</p>

        <p>It was the race instinct that spoke there. It spoke not
        with prejudice, but against it. It spoke there as it speaks
        always and everywhere -- as it has spoken for two thousand
        years. And it spoke to the reason of each race. Millaud, in
        voting in the French Convention for the beheading of Louis
        XVI., said "If death did not exist, it would be necessary
        to-day to invent it." So of this instinct. It is the pledge
        of the integrity of each race, and of peace between the
        races. Without it, there might be a breaking down of all
        lines of division and a thorough intermingling of whites
        and blacks. This once accomplished, the lower and the
        weaker elements of the races would begin to fuse and the
        process of amalgamation would have begun. This would mean
        the disorganization of society. An internecine war would be
        precipitated. The whites, at any cost and at any hazard,
        would maintain the clear integrity and dominance of the
        Anglo-Saxon blood. They understand perfectly that the
        debasement of their own race would not profit the humble
        and sincere race with which their lot is cast, and that the
        hybrid would not gain what either race lost. Even if the
        vigor and the volume of the Anglo-Saxon blood would enable
        it to absorb the African current, and after many
        generations recover its own strength and purity, not all
        the powers of earth could control the unspeakable horrors
        that would wait upon the slow process of clarification.
        Easier far it would be to take the population of central
        New York, intermingle with an equal percentage of Indians,
        and force amalgamation between the two. Let us review the
        argument. If Mr. Cable is correct in assuming that there is
        no instinct that keeps the two races separate in the South,
        then there is no reason for doubting that if intermingled
        they would fuse. Mere prejudice would not long survive
        perfect equality and social intermingling; and the
        prejudice once gone, intermarrying would begin. Then, if
        there is a race instinct in either race that resents
        intimate association with the other, it would be unwise to
        force such association when there are easy and just
        alternatives. If there is no such instinct, the mixing of
        the races would mean amalgamation, to which the whites will
        never submit, and to which neither race should submit. So
        that in either case, whether the race feeling is instinct
        or prejudice, we come to but one conclusion: The white and
        black races in the South must walk apart. Concurrent their
        courses may go -- ought to go-- will go -- but separate. If
        instinct did not make this plain in a flash, reason would
        spell it out letter by letter.</p>

        <p>Now, let us see. We hold that there is an instinct,
        ineradicable and positive that will keep the races apart,
        that would keep the races apart if the problem were
        transferred to Illinois or to Maine, and that will resist
        every effort of appeal, argument, or force to bring them
        together. We add in perfect frankness, however, that if no
        such instinct existed, or if the South had reasonable doubt
        of its existence, it would, by every means in its power, so
        strengthen the race prejudice that it would do the work and
        hold the stubbornness and strength of instinct. The
        question that confronts us at this point is: Admitted this
        instinct, that gathers each race to itself. Then, do you
        believe it possible to carry forward on the same soil and
        under the same laws two races equally free, practically
        equal in numbers, and yet entirely distinct and separate?
        This is a momentous question. It involves a problem that,
        all things considered, is without a precedent or parallel.
        Can the South carry this problem in honor and in peace to
        an equitable solution? We reply that for ten years the
        South has been doing this very thing, and with at least
        apparent success. No impartial and observant man can say
        that in the present aspect of things there is cause for
        alarm, or even for doubt. In the experience of the past few
        years there is assuredly reason for encouragement. There
        may be those who discern danger in the distant future. We
        do not. Beyond the apprehensions which must for a long time
        attend a matter so serious, we see nothing but cause for
        congratulation. In the common sense and the sincerity of
        the negro, no less than in the intelligence and earnestness
        of the whites, we find the problem simplifying. So far from
        the future bringing trouble, we feel confident that another
        decade or so, confirming the experience of the past ten
        years, will furnish the solution to be accepted of all
        men.</p>

        <p>Let us examine briefly what the South has been doing,
        and study the attitude of the races towards each other. Let
        us do this, not so much to vindicate the past as to clear
        the way for the future. Let us see what the situation
        teaches. There must be in the experience of fifteen years
        something definite and suggestive. We begin with the
        schools and school management, as the basis of the
        rest.</p>

        <p>Every Southern State has a common-school system, and in
        every State separate schools are provided for the races.
        Almost every city of more than five thousand inhabitants
        has a public-school system, and in every city the schools
        for whites and blacks are separate. There is no exception
        to this rule that I can find. In many cases the law
        creating this system requires that separate schools shall
        be provided for the races. This plan works admirably. There
        is no friction in the administration of the schools, and no
        suspicion as to the ultimate tendency of the system. The
        road to school is clear, and both races walk therein with
        confidence. The whites, assured that the school will not be
        made the hotbed of false and pernicious ideas, or the scene
        of unwise associations, support the system cordially, and
        insist on perfect equality in grade and efficiency. The
        blacks, asking no more than this, fill the schools with
        alert and eager children. So far from feeling debased by
        the separate-school system, they insist that the separation
        shall be carried further, and the few white teachers yet
        presiding over negro schools supplanted by negro teachers.
        The appropriations for public schools are increased year
        after year, and free education grows constantly in strength
        and popularity. Cities that were afraid to commit
        themselves to free schools while mixed schools were a
        possibility commenced building schoolhouses as soon as
        separate schools were assured. In 1870 the late Benjamin H.
        Hill found his matchless eloquence unable to carry the
        suggestion of negro education into popular tolerance. Ten
        years later nearly one million black children attended free
        schools, supported by general taxation. Though the whites
        pay nineteen-twentieths of the tax, they insist that the
        blacks shall share its advantages equally. The schools for
        each race are opened on that same day and closed on the
        same day. Neither is run a single day at the expense of the
        other. The Negroes are satisfied with the situation. I am
        aware that some of the Northern teachers of negro
        high-schools and universities will controvert this.
        Touching their opinion, I have only to say that it can
        hardly be considered fair or conservative. Under the
        forcing influence of social ostracism, they have reasoned
        impatiently and have been helped to conclusions by quick
        sympathies or resentments. Driven back upon themselves and
        hedged in by suspicion or hostility, their service has
        become a sort of martyrdom, which has swiftly stimulated
        opinion into conviction and conviction into fanaticism. I
        read in a late issue of Zion's Herald a letter from one of
        these teachers, who declined, on the conductor's request,
        to leave the car in which she was riding, and which was set
        apart exclusively for Negroes. The conductor, therefore,
        presumed she was a quadroon, and stated his presumption in
        answer to inquiry of a young negro man who was with her.
        She says of this:<br /></p>

        <blockquote>
          "Truly, a glad thrill went through my heart -- a thrill
          of pride. This great autocrat had pronounced me as not
          only in sympathy, but also one in blood, with the truest,
          tenderest, and noblest race that dwells on earth."
        </blockquote>If this quotation, which is now before me over
        the writer's name, suggests that she and those of her
        colleagues who agree with her have narrowed within their
        narrowing environment, and acquired artificial enthusiasm
        under their unnatural conditions, so that they must be
        unsafe as advisers and unfair as witnesses, the sole
        purpose for which it is introduced will have been served.
        This suggestion does not reach all Northern teachers of
        negro schools. Some have taken broader counsels, awakened
        wider sympathies, and, as a natural result, hold more
        moderate views. The influence of the extremer faction is
        steadily diminishing. Set apart, as small and curious
        communities are set here and there in populous States,
        stubborn and stiff for a while, but overwhelmed at last and
        lost in the mingling currents, these dissenting spots will
        be ere long blotted out and forgotten. The educational
        problem, which is their special care, has already been
        settled, and the settlement accepted with a heartiness that
        precludes the possibility of its disturbance. From the
        stand-point of either race the experiment of distinct but
        equal schools for the white and black children of the South
        has demonstrated its wisdom, its policy, and its justice,
        if any experiment ever made plain its wisdom in the hands
        of finite man.

        <p>I quote on this subject Gustavus J. Orr, one of the
        wisest and best of men and lately elected, by spontaneous
        movement, president of the National Educational
        Association. He says: "The race question in the schools is
        already settled. We give the Negroes equal advantages, but
        separate schools. This plan meets the reason and satisfies
        the instinct of both races. Under it we have spent over
        five million dollars in Georgia, and the system grows in
        strength constantly." I asked if the Negroes wanted mixed
        schools. His reply was prompt: "They do not. I have
        questioned them carefully on this point, and they make but
        one reply: They want their children in their own schools
        and under their own teachers." I asked what would be the
        effect of mixed schools. "I could not maintain the Georgia
        system one year. Both races would protest against it. My
        record as a public-school man is known. I have devoted my
        life to the work of education. But I am so sure of the
        evils that would come from mixed schools that, even if they
        were possible, I would see the whole educational system
        swept away before I would see them established. There is an
        instinct that gathers each race about itself. It is as
        strong in the blacks as in the whites, though it has not
        asserted itself so strongly. It is making itself manifest,
        since the blacks are organizing a social system of their
        own. It has long controlled them in their churches, and it
        is now doing so in their schools."</p>

        <p>In churches, as in schools, the separation is perfect.
        The Negroes, in all denominations in which their membership
        is an appreciable percentage of the whole, have their own
        churches, congregations, pastors, conferences, and bishops,
        their own missionaries. There is not the slightest
        antagonism between them and the white churches of the same
        denomination. On the contrary, there is sympathetic
        interest and the utmost friendliness. The separation is
        recognized as not only instinctive but wise. There is no
        disposition to disturb it, and least of all on the part of
        the negro. The church is with him the center of social
        life, and there he wants to find his own people and no
        others. Let me quote just here a few sentences from a
        speech delivered by a genuine black negro at the General
        Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church (South), in
        Atlanta, Georgia, in 1880. He is himself a pastor of the
        African Methodist Church, and came as a fraternal delegate.
        This extract from a speech largely extempore is a fair
        specimen of negro eloquence, as it is a fair evidence of
        the feeling of that people toward their white
        neighbors.</p>

        <p>In their social institutions, as in their churches and
        schools, the Negroes have obeyed their instinct and kept
        apart from the whites. They have their own social and
        benevolent societies, their own military companies, their
        own orders of Masons and Odd-fellows. They rally about
        these organizations with the greatest enthusiasm and
        support them with the greatest liberality. If it were
        proposed to merge them with white organizations of the same
        character, with equal rights guaranteed in all, the negroes
        would interpose the stoutest objection. Their tastes,
        associations, and inclinations -- their instincts -- lead
        them to gather their race about social centers of its own.
        I am tempted into trying to explain here what I have never
        yet seen a stranger to the South able to understand. The
        feeling that, by mutual actions separates whites and blacks
        when they are thrown together in social intercourse is not
        a repellent influence in the harsh sense of that word. It
        is centripetal rather than centrifugal. It is attractive
        about separate centers rather than expulsive from a common
        center. There is no antagonism, for example, between white
        and black military companies. On occasions they parade in
        the same street, and have none of the feeling that exists
        between Orangemen and Catholics. Of course the good sense
        of each race and the mutual recognition of the possible
        dangers of the situation have much to do with maintaining
        the good-will between the distinct races. The fact that in
        his own church or society the negro has more freedom, more
        chance for leadership and for individual development, than
        he could have in association with the whites, has more to
        do with it. But beyond all this is the fact that, in the
        segregation of the races, blacks as well as whites obey a
        natural instinct, which, always granting that they get
        equal justice and equal advantages, they obey without the
        slightest ill-nature or without any sense of disgrace. They
        meet the white people in all the avenues of business. They
        work side by side with the white brick-layer or carpenter
        in perfect accord and friendliness. When the trowel or the
        hammer is laid aside, the laborers part, each going his own
        way. Any attempt to carry the comradeship of the day into
        private life would be sternly resisted by both parties in
        interest.</p>

        <p>We have seen that in churches, schools, and social
        organizations the whites and blacks are moving along
        separately but harmoniously, and that the "assortment of
        the races," which has been described as shameful and
        unjust, is in most part made by the instinct of each race,
        and commands the hearty assent of both. Let us now consider
        the question of public carriers. On this point the South
        has been sharply criticized, and not always without reason.
        It is manifestly wrong to make a negro pay as much for a
        railroad ticket as a white man pays, and then force him to
        accept inferior accommodations. It is equally wrong to
        force a decent negro into an indecent car, when there is
        room for him or for her elsewhere. Public sentiment in the
        South has long recognized this, and has persistently
        demanded that the railroad managers should provide cars for
        the negroes equal in every respect to those set apart for
        the whites, and that these cars should be kept clean and
        orderly. In Georgia a State law requires all public roads
        or carriers to provide equal accommodation for each race,
        and failure to do so is made a penal offense. In Tennessee
        a negro woman lately gained damages by proving that she had
        been forced to take inferior accommodation on a train. The
        railroads have, with few exceptions, come up to the
        requirements of the law. Where they fail, they quickly feel
        the weight of public opinion, and shock the sense of public
        justice. This very discussion, I am bound to say, will
        lessen such failures in the future. On four roads, in my
        knowledge, even better has been done than the law requires.
        The car set apart for the negroes is made exclusive. No
        whites are permitted to occupy it. A white man who strays
        into this car is politely told that it is reserved for the
        negroes. He has the information repeated two or three
        times, smiles, and retreats. This rule works admirably and
        will win general favor. There are a few roads that make no
        separate provision for the races, but announce that any
        passenger can ride on any car. Here the "assortment" of the
        races is done away with, and here it is that most of the
        outrages of which we hear occur. On these roads the negro
        has no place set apart for him. As a rule, he is shy about
        asserting himself, and he usually finds himself in the
        meanest corners of the train. If he forces himself into the
        ladies' car, he is apt to provoke a collision. It is on
        just one of these trains where the assortment of the
        passengers is left to chance that a respectable negro woman
        is apt to be forced to ride in a car crowded with negro
        convicts. Such a thing would be impossible where the issue
        is fairly met, and a car, clean orderly, and exclusive, is
        provided for each race. The case could not be met by
        grading the tickets and the accommodations. Such a plan
        would bring together in the second or third class car just
        the element of both races between whom prejudice runs
        highest, and from whom the least of tact or restraint might
        be expected. On the railroads, as elsewhere, the solution
        of the race problem is equal advantages for the same money,
        -- equal in comfort, safety, and exclusiveness, -- but
        separate.</p>

        <p>There remains but one thing further to consider -- the
        negro in the jury-box. It is assumed generally that the
        negro has no representation in the courts. This is a false
        assumption. In the United States courts he usually makes
        more than half the jury. As to the State courts, I can
        speak particularly as to Georgia. I assume that she does
        not materially differ from the other States. In Georgia the
        law requires that commissioners shall prepare the jury-list
        for each county by selection from the upright, intelligent,
        and experienced citizens of the county. This provision was
        put into the Constitution by the negro convention of
        reconstruction days. Under its terms no reasonable man
        would have expected to see the list made up of equal
        percentage of the races. Indeed, the fewest number of
        negroes were qualified under the law. Consequently, but few
        appeared on the lists. The number, as was to be expected,
        is steadily increasing. In Fulton County there are
        seventy-four negroes whose names are on the lists, and the
        commissioners, I am informed, have about doubled this
        number for the present year. These negroes make good
        jurymen, and are rarely struck by attorneys, no matter what
        the client or cause may be. About the worst that can be
        charged against the jury system in Georgia is that the
        commissioners have made jurors of negroes only when they
        had qualified themselves to intelligently discharge a
        juror's duties. In few quarters of the South, however, is
        the negro unable to get full and exact justice in the
        courts, whether the jury be white or black. Immediately
        after the war, when there was general alarm and irritation,
        there may have been undue severity in sentences and extreme
        rigor of prosecution. But the charge that the people of the
        South have, in their deliberate and later moments,
        prostituted justice to the oppression of this dependent
        people, is as false as it is infamous. There is belief that
        the very helplessness of the negro in court has touched the
        heart and conscience of many a jury, when the facts should
        have held them impervious. In the city in which this is
        written a negro, at midnight, on an unfrequented street,
        murdered a popular young fellow, over whose grave a
        monument was placed by popular subscription. The only
        witnesses of the killing were the friends of the murdered
        boy. Had the murderer been a white man, it is believed he
        would have been convicted. He was acquitted by the white
        jury, and has since been convicted of a murderous assault
        on a person of his own color. Similarly, a young white man,
        belonging to one of the leading families of the State, was
        hung for the murder of a negro. Insanity was pleaded in his
        defense, and so plausibly that it is believed he would have
        escaped had his victim been a white man.</p>

        <p>I quote on this point Mr. Benjamin H. Hill, who has been
        prosecuting attorney of the Atlanta, Ga., circuit for
        twelve years. He says: "In cities and towns the negro gets
        equal and exact justice before the courts. It is possible
        that, in remote counties, where the question is one of a
        fight between a white man and a negro, there may be a
        lingering prejudice that causes occasional injustice. The
        judge, however, may be relied on to correct this. As to
        negro jurors, I have never known a negro to allow his
        lawyer to accept a negro juror. For the State I have
        accepted a black juror fifty times, to have him rejected by
        the opposing lawyer by order of his negro client. This has
        occurred so invariably that I have accepted it as a rule.
        Irrespective of that, the negro gets justice in the courts,
        and the last remaining prejudice against him in the
        jury-box has passed away. I convicted a white man for
        voluntary manslaughter under peculiar circumstances. A
        negro met him on the street and cursed him. The white man
        ordered him off and started home. The negro followed him to
        his house and cursed him until he entered the door. When he
        came out, the negro was still waiting. He renewed the
        abuse, followed him to his store, and there struck him with
        his fist. In the struggle that followed, the negro was shot
        and killed. The jury promptly convicted the slayer."</p>

        <p>So much for the relation between the races in the South,
        in churches, schools, social organizations, on the
        railroad, and in theaters. Everything is placed on the
        basis of equal accommodations, but separate. In the courts
        the blacks are admitted to the jury-box as they lift
        themselves into the limit of qualification. Mistakes have
        been made and injustice has been worked here and there.
        This was to have been expected, and it has been less than
        might have been expected. But there can be no mistake about
        the progress the South is making in the equitable
        adjustment of the relations between the races. Ten years
        ago nothing was settled. There were frequent collisions and
        constant apprehensions. The whites were suspicious and the
        blacks were restless. So simple a thing as a negro taking
        an hour's ride on the cars, or going to see a play, was
        fraught with possible danger. The larger affairs -- school,
        church, and court -- were held in abeyance. Now all this is
        changed. The era of doubt and mistrust is succeeded by the
        era of confidence and good-will. The races meet in the
        exchange of labor in perfect amity and understanding.
        Together they carry on the concerns of the day, knowing
        little or nothing of the fierce hostility that divides
        labor and capital in other sections. When they turn to
        social life they separate. Each race obeys its instinct and
        congregates about its own centers. At the theater they sit
        in opposite sections of the same gallery. On the trains
        they ride each in his own car. Each worships in his own
        church, and educates his children in his schools. Each has
        his place and fills it, and is satisfied. Each gets the
        same accommodation for the same money. There is no
        collision. There is no irritation or suspicion. Nowhere on
        earth is there kindlier feeling, closer sympathy, or less
        friction between two classes of society than between the
        whites and blacks of the South to-day. This is due to the
        fact that in the adjustment of their relations they have
        been practical and sensible. They have wisely recognized
        what was essential, and have not sought to change what was
        unchangeable. They have yielded neither to the fanatic nor
        the demagogue, refusing to be misled by the one or misused
        by the other. While the world has been clamoring over the
        differences they have been quietly taking counsel with each
        other, in the field, the shop, the street and cabin, and
        settling things for themselves. That the result has not
        astonished the world in the speediness and the facility
        with which it has been reached, and the beneficence that
        has come with it, is due to the fact that the result has
        not been freely proclaimed. It has been a deplorable
        condition of our politics that the North has been
        misinformed as to the true condition of things in the
        South. Political greed and passion conjured pestilential
        mists to becloud what the lifting smoke of battle left
        clear. It has exaggerated where there was a grain of fact,
        and invented where there was none. It has sought to
        establish the most casual occurrences as the settled habit
        of the section, and has sprung endless jeremiads from one
        single disorder, as Jenkins filled the courts of
        Christendom with lamentations over his dissevered ear.
        These misrepresentations will pass away with the occasion
        that provoked them, and when the truth is known it will
        come with the force of a revelation to vindicate those who
        have bespoken for the South a fair trial, and to confound
        those who have borne false witness against her.</p>

        <p>One thing further need be said, in perfect frankness.
        The South must be allowed to settle the social relations of
        the races according to her own views of what is right and
        best. There has never been a moment when she could have
        submitted to have the social status of her citizens fixed
        by an outside power. She accepted the emancipation and the
        enfranchisement of her slaves as the legitimate results of
        war that had been fought to a conclusion. These once
        accomplished, nothing more was possible. "Thus far and no
        farther," she said to her neighbors, in no spirit of
        defiance, but with quiet determination. In her weakest
        moments, when her helpless people were hedged about by the
        unthinking bayonets of her conquerors, she gathered them
        for resistance at this point. Here she defended everything
        that a people should hold dear. There was little
        proclamation of her purpose. Barely did the whispered word
        that bespoke her resolution catch the listening ears of her
        sons; but, for all this, the victorious armies of the
        North, had they been rallied again from their homes, could
        not have enforced and maintained among this disarmed people
        the policy indicated in the Civil Rights bill. Had she
        found herself unable to defend her social integrity against
        the arms that were invincible on the fields where she
        staked the sovereignty of her States, her people would have
        abandoned their homes and betaken themselves into exile.
        Now, as then, the South is determined that, come what may,
        she must control the social relations of the two races
        whose lots are cast within her limits. It is right that she
        should have this control. The problem is hers, whether or
        not of her seeking, and her very existence depends on its
        proper solution. Her responsibility is greater, her
        knowledge of the case more thorough than that of others can
        be. The question touches her at every point; it presses on
        her from every side; it commands her constant attention.
        Every consideration of policy, of honor, of pride, of
        common sense impels her to the exactest justice and the
        fullest equity. She lacks the ignorance or misapprehension
        that might lead others into mistakes; all others lack the
        appalling alternative that all else failing, would force
        her to use her knowledge wisely. For these reasons she has
        reserved to herself the right to settle the still unsettled
        element of the race problem, and this right she can never
        yield.</p>

        <p>As a matter of course, this implies the clear and
        unmistakable domination of the white race in the South. The
        assertion of that is simply the assertion of the right of
        character, intelligence, and property to rule. It is simply
        saying that the responsible and steadfast element in the
        community shall control, rather than the irresponsible and
        the migratory. It is the reassertion of the moral power
        that overthrew the scandalous reconstruction governments,
        even though, to the shame of the republic be it said, they
        were supported by the bayonets of the General Government.
        Even the race issue is lost at this point. If the blacks of
        the South wore white skins, and were leagued together in
        the same ignorance and irresponsibility under any other
        distinctive mark than their color, they would progress not
        one step farther toward the control of affairs. Or if they
        were transported as they are to Ohio, and there placed in
        numerical majority of two to one, they would find the white
        minority there asserting and maintaining control, with less
        patience, perhaps, than many a Southern State has shown.
        Everywhere, with such temporary exceptions as afford
        demonstration of the rule, intelligence, character, and
        property will dominate in spite of numerical differences.
        These qualities are lodged with the white race in the
        South, and will assuredly remain there for many generations
        at least; so that the white race will continue to dominate
        the colored, even if the percentages of race increase
        deduced from the comparison of a lame census with a perfect
        one, and the omission of other considerations, should hold
        good and the present race majority be reversed.</p>

        <p>Let no one imagine, from what is here said, that the
        South is careless of the opinion or regardless of the
        counsel of the outside world. On the contrary, while
        maintaining firmly a position she believes to be essential,
        she appreciates heartily the value of general sympathy and
        confidence. With an earnestness that is little less than
        pathetic she bespeaks the patience and the impartial
        judgment of all concerned. Surely her situation should
        command this, rather than indifference or antagonism. In
        poverty and defeat, -- with her cities destroyed, her
        fields desolated, her labor disorganized, her homes in
        ruins, her families scattered, and the ranks of her sons
        decimated, -- in the face of universal prejudice, fanned by
        the storm of war into hostility and hatred, -- under the
        shadow of this sorrow and this disadvantage, she turned
        bravely to confront a problem that would have taxed to the
        utmost every resource of a rich and powerful and victorious
        people. Every inch of her progress has been beset with sore
        difficulties; and if the way is now clearing, it only
        reveals more clearly the tremendous import of the work to
        which her hands are given. It must be understood that she
        desires to silence no criticism, evade no issue, and lessen
        no responsibility. She recognizes that the negro is here to
        stay. She knows that her dear name, and her fame, no less
        than her prosperity, will be measured by the fullness of
        the justice she gives and guarantees to this kindly and
        dependent race. She knows that every mistake made and every
        error fallen into, no matter how innocently, endanger her
        peace and her reputation. In this full knowledge she
        accepts the issue without fear or evasion. She says, not
        boldly, but conscious of the honesty and the wisdom of her
        convictions: "Leave this problem to my working out. I will
        solve it in calmness and deliberation, without passion or
        prejudice, and with full regard for the unspeakable
        equities it holds. Judge me rigidly, but judge me by my
        works." And with the South the matter may be left -- must
        be left. There it can be left with the fullest confidence
        that the honor of the republic will be maintained, the
        rights of humanity guarded, and the problem worked out in
        such exact justice as the finite mind can measure or finite
        agencies administer.</p>
