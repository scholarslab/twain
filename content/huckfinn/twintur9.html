<br />

<p>One of the largest and it is certain, the most appreciative audiences of the season assembled last
night to hear the readings of "Mark Twain" (S.L. Clemens) and George W. Cable.  The constant
and convulsive laughter of the audience displayed that it needed no extra effort of these well-known authors to hold their listeners' attention.  Their selections in themselves did that.  The
inimitable sketches of Mark Twain and their equally mirth-provoking author, combined with the
bright and spicy extracts by Mr. Cable from his "Dr. Sevier," made an entertainment that would be
hard to be equaled.  Everything they gave was so original that it would be a difficult task to
decide which should claim the greatest merit.</p>

<p>The "Tragic Tale of the Fishwife" by Mark Twain probably occasioned the most laughter, and as
its vein of fun is of a character that has been pronounced to be beyond parallel, it deserved all the
applause it gained.  The house was filled with the best of Columbus people, and the gentlemen
who entertained them should recognize the decided compliment thus conveyed.</p>
