        All intimations that you and Pond are not my Beloved
        Friends are false and if you can say the same of me do so
        as privately or as publicly as you like.<br />

          Simsbury, Conn.<br />
          May 16/85.
        </center>Dear Clemens:<br />
        &nbsp; Telegd. you last even'g &amp; have not got reply;
        but without waiting to see if you are replying by letter, I
        write. For I see now that if you have not seen the
        newspaper and telegraphic slanders printed against us you
        will not understand, and if you have then my telegram
        hardly covers the main point. So I add this to assure you
        that all statements that I have either openly or covertly
        intimated anything unpleasant about you to my friends or
        anybody else are false from beginning to end. If you care
        to know it, I esteem you more highly since our winter's
        experience than I ever did before &amp; should deeply
        regret if scandal mongers were to make an estrangement
        between us.<br />
        &nbsp; Of course I do not believe that you have said ought
        against me that was not intended as a friend's fair
        criticism among friends. Nor do I think Pond has said a
        word that was meant in unkindness about either of us.<br />
        &nbsp; I have privately called for an immediate explanation
        from the Boston Herald--where the thing seems to have
        started--&amp; they write they have demanded as much of
        their New York correspondent &amp; will report without
        delay.<br />

        <center>
          Yours truly<br />
          G. W. Cable
