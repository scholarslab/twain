    <h3>Mary's Night Ride</h3>
  </center><font size="+1">From <b><i>Dr. Sevier</i></b>, Chapter
  LIV--</font>

  <p>About the middle of that night Mary Richling was sitting very
  still and upright on a large dark horse that stood chomping at
  his Mexican bit in the black shadow of a great oak. Alice rested
  before her, fast asleep, against her bosom. Mary held by the
  bridle another horse, whose naked saddle-tree was empty. A few
  steps in front of her the light of the full moon shone almost
  straight down upon a narrow road that just there emerged from the
  shadow of woods on either side, and divided into a main right
  fork and a much smaller one that curved around to Mary's left.
  Off in the direction of the main fork the sky was all aglow with
  camp-fires. Only just here on the left there was a cool and
  grateful darkness.</p>

  <p>She lifted her head alertly. A twig crackled under a tread,
  and the next moment a man came out of the bushes at the left, and
  without a word took the bridle of the led horse from her fingers
  and vaulted into the saddle. The hand that rested a moment on the
  cantle as he rose grasped a "navy-six." He was dressed in dull
  homespun, but he was the same who had been dressed in blue. He
  turned his horse and led the way down the lesser road.</p>

  <p>"If we'd of gone three hundred yards further," he whispered,
  falling back and smiling broadly, "we'd a' run into the pickets.
  I went nigh enough to see the videttes settin' on their hosses in
  the main road. This here aint no road; it just goes up to a
  nigger quarters. I've got one o' the niggers to show us the
  way."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" whispered Mary; but, before her companion could
  answer, a tattered form moved from behind a bush a little in
  advance and started ahead in the path, walking and beckoning.
  Presently they turned into a clear, open forest and followed the
  long, rapid, swinging stride of the negro for nearly an hour.
  Then they halted on the bank of a deep, narrow stream. The negro
  made a motion for them to keep well to the right when they should
  enter the water. The white man softly lifted Alice to his arms,
  directed and assisted Mary to kneel in her saddle, with her
  skirts gathered carefully under her, and so they went down into
  the cold stream, the negro first, with arms outstretched above
  the flood; then Mary, and then the white man, -- or, let us say
  plainly the spy, -- with the unawakened child on his breast. And
  so they rose out of it on the farther side without a shoe or
  garment wet save the rags of their dark guide.</p>

  <p>Again they followed him, along a line of stake-and-rider
  fence, with the woods on one side and the bright moonlight
  flooding a field of young cotton on the other. Now they heard the
  distant baying of house-dogs, now the doleful call of the
  chuck-will's-widow; and once Mary's blood turned, for an instant,
  to ice, at the unearthly shriek of the hoot-owl just above her
  head. At length they found themselves in a dim, narrow road, and
  the negro stopped.</p>

  <p>"Dess keep dish yeh road fo' 'bout half mile an' you strak
  'pon the broad, main road. Tek de right, an' you go whah yo'
  fancy tek you."</p>

  <p>"Good-by," whispered Mary.</p>

  <p>"Good-by, miss," said the negro, in the same low voice;
  "good-by, boss; don't you fo'git you promise tek me thoo to de
  Yankee' when you come back. I 'feered you gwine fo'git it,
  boss."</p>

  <p>The spy said he would not, and they left him. The half-mile
  was soon passed, though it turned out to be a mile and a half,
  and at length Mary's companion looked back, as they rode single
  file, with Mary in the rear, and said softly, "There's the road,"
  pointing at its broad, pale line with his six-shooter.</p>

  <p>As they entered it and turned to the right, Mary, with Alice
  again in her arms, moved somewhat ahead of her companion, her
  indifferent horsemanship having compelled him to drop back to
  avoid a prickly bush. His horse was just quickening his pace to
  regain the lost position when a man sprang up from the ground on
  the farther side of the highway, snatched a carbine from the
  earth and cried, "Halt!"</p>

  <p>The dark, recombent forms of six or eight others could be
  seen, enveloped in their blankets, lying about a few red coals.
  Mary turned a frightened look backward and met the eyes of her
  companion.</p>

  <p>"Move a little faster," said he, in a low, clear voice. As she
  promptly did so she heard him answer the challenge. His horse
  trotted softly after hers.</p>

  <p>"Don't stop us, my friend; we're taking a sick child to the
  doctor."</p>

  <p>"Halt, you hound!" the cry rang out; and as Mary glanced back
  three or four men were just leaping into the road. But she saw,
  also, her companion, his face suffused with an earnestness that
  was almost an agony, rise in his stirrups, with the stoop of his
  shoulders all gone, and wildly cry: --</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>She smote the horse and flew. Alice awoke and screamed.</p>

  <p>"Hush, my darling!" said the mother, laying on the withe;
  "mamma's here. Hush, darling! -- mamma's here. Don't be
  frightened, darling baby! O God, spare my child!" and away she
  sped.</p>

  <p>The report of a carbine rang out and went rolling away in a
  thousand echoes through the wood. Two others followed in sharp
  succession, and there went close by Mary's ear the waspish whine
  of a minnie-ball. At the same moment she recognized, once, --
  twice, -- thrice, -- just at her back where the hoofs of her
  companion's horse were clattering, -- the tart rejoinders of his
  navy-six.</p>

  <p>"Go!" he cried again. "Lay low! lay low! cover the child!" But
  his words were needless. With head bowed forward and form
  crouched over the crying, clinging child, with slackened rein and
  fluttering dress, and sun-bonnet and loosened hair blown back
  upon her shoulders, with lips compressed and silent prayers, Mary
  was riding for life and liberty and her husband's bed-side.</p>

  <p>"O mamma! mamma!" wailed the terrified little one.</p>

  <p>"Go on! Go on!" cried the voice behind; "they're saddling --
  up! Go! go! We're goin' to make it. We're goin' to <i>make</i>
  it! Go-o-o!"</p>
