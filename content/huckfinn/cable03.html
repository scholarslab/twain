        <p>New York, May 5, 1885. . . . Speaking of authors, Mr.
        George W. Cable does not enjoy a high degree of personal
        popularity in our literary circles at present. He has
        revealed a smallness which it is hard to reconcile with his
        writings. Many stories of</p>

        <center><b>Something Approaching Meanness</b></center>
<p>are floating around. He fell sick at Hartford, was
        taken to Mr. Coleman's [<i>i.e.</i> Clemens'] house and
        nursed for a long time. This was all right. For nearly
        three weeks he almost lived on champagne, ordered expressly
        for him. Doubtless that was all right, too--at least Cable
        seemed to think so. During his illness there had been
        considerable telegraphing, and after his recovery Cable did
        have the grace to ask if there were not some telegraph
        bills for him to pay. Well, Clemens, of course, had paid
        for the dispatches as they arrived, but he had kept a list,
        which he showed Cable. The total was some $10. Cable
        gravely sat down to audit his friend's account. Presently
        he came to one telegram which was unimportant, but which
        Clemens had received and paid for. "That should not have
        been received," said Cable, and promptly crossed it off the
        list, leaving his friend so much out of pocket. It was only
        a trifle, but characteristic, especially when you think of
        the champagne and nursing. Well, after all this attention
        in Hartford, it happened that a local church needed to
        raise money for a charitable purpose. The patrons of the
        plan were friends of Clemens and people who had been good
        to Cable, and they ventured to ask the latter if he would
        read one or two selections in aid of the charity. Mr. Cable
        replied that he thought they could better afford to pay him
        for reading than he could to give them a reading free.
        Under the circumstances, it is not strange that Clemens and
        his friends</p>

        <center><b>Felt Somewhat Surprised</b></center>
<p>at this curt answer. Rumor has it that Clemens did
        not thoroughly enjoy his reading tour with Cable on account
        of the latter's parsimony. They say that Cable did not
        spend the price of a postage stamp during the trip. The
        agreement was that his expenses should be paid, and he
        quickly adopted the habit of ordering the most expensive
        things at hotels, and of leaving Clemens to pay even the
        horse car fares when they were out together. Clemens,
        whatever faults he may have, is not a small man, but I
        understand that he became soured by seeing Cable order $5
        breakfasts and other things in the same style, knowing that
        Cable ordinarily lives in the most frugal and economical
        way. It is reported that Cable was paid $500 a week over
        his expenses by Clemens, who took the balance of the
        receipts. For the 16 weeks, this would give Cable $8000,
        out of which he probably had to pay a commission to his
        manager. But he must have "salted down" a very tidy sum,
        enough to enable him to spend a penny now and then. I
        understand that Cable refused to join in the authors'
        readings last week, in precisely the same way that he
        refused to aid the Hartford philanthropists. Much surprise
        was expressed at his non-appearance. But he considered, I
        suppose, that the lack of a copyright law would not harm
        the sale of his books, and he didn't propose to aid his
        guild without cash down for his services. Queer that the
        author of "Grandissimes" and the delineator of generosity
        and unselfishness in "Dr. Sevier" should display</p>

        <center><b>Such Petty Qualities</b></center>
<p>in his private life. But it is a dangerous thing
        to confound the man with the author. Queer that a man, who
        is a fanatic on the subject of keeping the Sabbath, should
        put so narrow a construction on his duties to his
        fellow-man. Once Mr. Cable left Boston on a Saturday night.
        His friends were expecting him at Hartford. But reaching
        Worcester about midnight, he persisted in leaving the
        train, going to a hotel and staying there until midnight
        Sunday, when he resumed his journey. He had no thought for
        the annoyance which he might cause his friends. His fetich
        was Sabbath keeping, and he was blind to everything else.
        It was the same way in his reading tour. It made no
        difference how much trouble was caused to others or how
        many audiences were disappointed. He would not travel on
        Sunday, although he was forced to make some fine
        distinctions. Somebody asked him how he reconciled it to
        his sensitive conscience to write novels, but he declined
        to argue on the subject. Like the actor, there is a great
        difference in the author before and behind the scenes. The
        fact is that Cable was brought up in poverty. He had a
        hard, grinding life. He has known the bitterness of being
        very poor, and he remembers it like a nightmare. He has
        resolved to render his future secure, and, with this in
        view, he is making hay with all his might and main while
        the sun of prosperity shines upon him. If he is unwilling
        to help others, it is true that he spends little or no
        money upon himself. He will never drain the cup of poverty
        again if he can help himself. With all his literary talent
        and scrupulous honesty in business dealing, it is a pity
        that he should so conduct himself as to be accounted</p>

        <center><b>A Small Man</b></center>
<p>even by his friends. Some of his southern critics
        would say that he simply proves himself again a Yankee with
        no affiliation to the South. By the way, I hear he has
        answered Mr. Henry W. Grady in an article which is
        pronounced a masterpiece. . . .</p>
