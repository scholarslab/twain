<p>[<i>MT and Cable performed twice in Madison, Wisconsin -- on 21 and 27 January.  The local
</i>Madison Democrat <i> was only a four-page paper, published every day but Monday.  A
small ad for the first lecture, announced as the only lecture, began running on 17 January.  The
same issue also included an item about the event in the paper's editorial column.  The same ad ran
each day until the show, but almost each day there was a different editorial blurb:</i>]</p>
