<center><b>The Colored People.</b></center>
<br />
 &nbsp; It cannot be denied that there is much uneasiness among the colored people 
because of the election of C<font size="-1">LEVELAND</font>.  Both at the North and at 
the South they seem to be depressed and full of forebodings.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; Nor can we wonder at their anxiety.  When the last Democratic President was 
in the White House millions of these negroes were slaves, and were utterly hopeless of 
release from their bondage.  At the North the prejudice against the colored people was 
strong almost everywhere, and they were subjected to great indignities on account of it. 
 They could not ride in public conveyances along with white men and women, and they 
were regarded and treated as an outcast class.  At the South the aversion to them 
because of their color was far less, but they were slaves and were looked on as little 
above brutes.  It was a penal offense to teach them to read and write, and they were 
bought and sold like cattle.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; The memory of Democratic rule to those poor people is therefore a memory of 
bondage, of degradation, and terrible injustice.  Under Republicanism they were made 
free and admitted to citizenship, and consequently both their self-respect and their 
importance in the eyes of the whites were much increased.  Anyone who remembers New 
York a quarter of a century ago, and recalls the colored people as they were then, must 
be greatly impressed by the improvement in their condition which has taken place within 
that time.  It is true that they are still a race apart, and that the tendency is rather 
toward the strengthening rather than the obliteration of the African type.  In proportion 
to their whole number there are fewer mulattoes now than before the war, and under 
freedom the increased self-respect and greater pride of the negroes lead them to still 
more preserve their exclusiveness.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; But in social consideration they have gained vastly, and the humiliations from which 
they once suffered at the hands of the whites are now spared to a large extent.  They are 
not kicked about as they were in the old days, but are treated with decent respect, though 
the prejudice against them remains, and is, indeed, ineradicable.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; Of course the memory of that period is a painful and a terrible one to the colored 
people, and their reminiscences of those dark days are associated with Democratic rule.  
Democracy recalls slavery to them, and the word sounds harshly in their ears.  Under 
B<font size="-1">UCHANAN</font> they were chattels; under A<font size="-1">RTHUR</font> 
they are freemen and American citizens.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; But the negroes have no real occasion to indulge in gloomy forebodings.  So far 
from C<font size="-1">LEVELAND'S</font> election being a disadvantage for them, we do not 
doubt that of all the people they will be the greatest gainers by it.  Their freedom 
is assured, and as citizens and voters they are as important to the Democratic party 
as to the Republican party.  At the South especially their condition is likely to be 
much improved, for the whites have now had their way and will be less disposed to regard 
them with suspicion and to treat them with political injustice.  It is an era of good feeling 
in the South.  The whites are no longer irritated against the blacks as successful 
political enemies; and it is manifest from the Southern newspapers that they are already 
anxious to give the negroes indubitable proofs of their friendly disposition toward 
them.  We expect, therefore, to see the relations between the two races growing steadily 
more and more cordial, until at last there shall be no color line in politics.<br /><br />
 &nbsp; It will be a great step in advance for the colored people when they divide 
politically as the white people divide.  They will command more respect when it is seen 
that they are not, as a matter of course, mortgaged to one party.  The principle of 
Democracy, the principle which commends it to the great body of wage earners, deserves 
and must receive eventually the hearty support of the colored people.<br /><br />
 &nbsp; Instead of sorrowing because of the election of C<font size="-1">LEVELAND</font>, 
let them rather rejoice, for it gives promise that their political bondage will be 
broken.<br />
