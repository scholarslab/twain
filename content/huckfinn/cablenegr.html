        </center><br />
        It has been some time since Mr. George Cable preached his
        new doctrine of "Social Equality" in the <i>Century</i>,
        and we have waited in vain to hear a single Southern white
        man approve or support it. Mr. Cable declares that he is
        speaking for the South and as a Southerner. "I believe," he
        told a correspondent of the New York <i>Tribune</i> the
        other day, "that the more intelligent element of the South
        agree with me." If so, "the more intelligent element" has
        refused to say so. Mr. Cable has not met with a single
        supporter, but the entire South has repudiated his policy,
        not the press only, but all the public men, the leaders in
        literature and political economy. They have met his
        sentimentality with the sternest facts, have shown that his
        theory is false, rests on a false foundation and is
        mischevious and dangerous. . . . A few years ago Mr. Cable
        himself wrote: "I was in New England once -- a year ago --
        and I felt that I had never really been at home until
        then." If Mr. Cable ever spoke the truth it was when he
        said this. He is a New Englander, who has been accidentally
        born in the South, as he himself says; he looks on the
        South and Southern ideas as a New Englander. We do not
        object to this, and are open to his criticism, but let him
        not pretend to criticize us as a true son of the South . .
        .

        <blockquote>
          [<i>This editorial then goes on a great length to
          "disprove" Cable's demographic argument, introducing a
          long ennumeration of population figures and birth rates
          with the following:</i>]
        </blockquote>. . . Mr. Cable's pretense that the South is
        threatened with Africanization has been heard before; but
        his figures about the increase of negroes as compared with
        the whites are his own. They are pure inventions out of his
        own head, as much creatures of his fertile imagination as
        Mme. Delicieuse or Jean-ah Poquelen. He never got them from
        the census of from any table or book of statistics, and
        must have invented them to support his queer theory of
        saving the South from Africanization by giving everything
        to the negro. As a matter of fact his figures are false,
        and the idea that the negro race is increasing more rapidly
        than the whites and threatening to make a Hayti of this
        country is utterly without foundation.

        <blockquote>
          [<i>"The negro race is a prolific one, but its
          prolificness is decreasing and . . . it will grow each
          year a smaller element of our population" concludes this
          part of the editorial. It then concludes its attack on
          what it calls Cable and "a few" others' "negromania" with
          this paragraph:</i>]
        </blockquote>Mr. Cable attacks not the South alone, but the
        white race the wide world over, with his proposition that
        there is no race caste or prejudice. That prejudice is not
        restricted to the South. It is greater in the North than
        here. There are more paths and employments open to negroes
        in the Southern than in the New England States. Nor is this
        prejudice peculiar to this country, but the Englishman in
        India has the same sense of superiority to the Hindoo
        native, the same caste feeling which distinguishes the
        white race the world over, which has preserved it and its
        civilization pure, which has made it the dominant race of
        the world to teach, instruct and improve the others.
