    <h2>"Huckleberry Finn."</h2>
  </center>[<i>This synopsis of the novel is revealing not just for
  its factual errors or for what it doesn't remember about the
  novel -- including the "Evasion" section at the end -- but
  especially for the way it shows how easy it was for 19th-century
  readers simply to dismiss the story of Jim's quest for freedom,
  and how it turns out.</i>]

  <p>"Huckleberry Finn" is the adventures of Tom Sawyer's boy
  companion after he rebels against the efforts made to civilize
  him. "Huck" runs away, and, in company with the slave Jim, starts
  down the Missouri River on a raft, tying it up o' days and
  running at night, because Jim is a runaway slave.</p>

  <p>At last they come across two "fakirs," who are running away
  from angry townspeople, and take them aboard the raft. At various
  spots they touch, and the "Duke" and "King," as the fakirs call
  themselves, resort to any sort of scheme to raise money, acting,
  addressing prayer-meetings as reformed pirates, and finally
  ending up with a trick which costs them a suit of tar and
  feathers. This is palming themselves off as a bereaved family in
  a country village, as the brothers of the uncle who has just
  died, and getting hold of the money.</p>

  <p>"Huck" finally manages to trick the rascals and they are
  summarily punished.</p>

  <p>The descriptions of life along the Missouri fifty years ago
  are marvellously written in a colloquial, familiar style, as
  though told by "Huck" Finn himself. The story of the great
  Grangerford-Sheperdson feud, the tale of the "Royal Nonesuch,"
  the camp-meeting in the woods, the running amuck of a drunken man
  in a river town -- these are in Mark Twain's best style."</p>
