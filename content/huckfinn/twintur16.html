<b><font size="+1">FUN ON THE STAGE</font></b><br />
<b>Mark Twain and George W. Cable Entertain a Large Audience--<br />
The Academy of Music Packed to the Doors</b><br />
<br />

<p>A slimly built, dark whiskered man, the points of whose long and somewhat straggling black
mustache almost fell upon the collar of his dress coat, faced the immense audience that filled up
every crevice and nook of the Academy of Music at 8 o'clock last evening, and backed somewhat
nervously against part of the elegant furniture that had supplanted the ordinary properties of the
stage.  Mr. George W. Cable was about to commence a recital of the adventures of some of his
characters in his novel of "Dr. Sevier."  Mr. Cable's manner as an elocutionist violates some of the
canons of good speaking, but his story is so spiritedly told by him that to his audience the
contempt of the conventionalities is lost sight of in the interest of the narrative.  Mr. Cable retired
with a series of profound bows that landed him exactly at the easterly corner of the stage when he
had finished.  Three young ladies in the front seat now nudged one another and some of the more
elderly of the audience prepared to listen to Mark Twain.  The noted humorist, his hair tinged
with gray and a look of perfect innocence on his sharp New England features, came forward amid
the plaudits of the audience, the young ladies in the front seats apparently losing all control of
themselves and clapping their hands until their faces glowed.  Twain has a peculiar way of looking
sideways at his audience and at the same time gently lifting up his left hand by the agency of his
right and scratching his well shaven chin meditatively.  He commenced by assuring his audience
that he had had since he knew anything a horror of the interviewer.  "The principal reason of
that," he continued, "is that reporters have a peculiar way of getting at facts which a man does not
want to be known.  Now, one of these men came to see me one time after I had -- well,
committed a crime.  What the crime was has entirely escaped my memory.  I have no mind to
remember such things anyway.  I made no note of it, but all the same I did not want to see this
interviewer.  When he came to see me I wrestled a long time with the problem of how to offset
him."  The lecturer continued in this strain, amid the laughter of his audience, and showed how he
had completely befogged the interviewer with a series of falsehoods that would knock any man
off  his pins.  His manner was inimitable, and no reproduction of his mere words can convey any
idea of the humor of the situation.  The audience was completely carried away, but amid all the
laughter the prickly halo of stubbly gray hair that fringes his forehead was immovable.  He was
apparently incapable of emotion.  The jolliest of witticisms and the condensation of humor went
forth from his lips, but never a smile was to be seen on his countenance.</p>

<p>Mr. Cable again regaled the audience with a chapter of "Dr. Sevier," and effectually dissipated the
impression, if such prevails, that his work was intended as a mere makeweight to that of Mr.
Clemens.  In response to an encore he sang a Creole song that had been first heard on the banks
of the Congo 150 years ago.  It was partially translated into a combination of barbaric French and
New Orleans African.  When he had made his bow he backed against a little pedestal on which a
statue of Shakespeare rested.  The Bard of Avon trembled for a moment, and would have fallen to
the ground if Mr. Cable had not been equally ready with his hands as he had been eloquent with
his tongue.  He introduced the statue as the late Mr. Shakespeare.  The laughter that greeted this
joke was redoubled as Mark Twain stepped forward and told the audience that he meant to make
an alteration in the programme.  The next piece according to that instrument was Buck Fanshaw's
Funeral, but Mr. Clemens said that he never did like funerals anyway.  This funeral procession was
exploded in Brooklyn ten years ago he said, "and I will read instead a scene from my new play, in
which Colonel Mulberry Sellers having failed in everything else tackles science as a last resort,
and proposes to utilize the wasted energies of the present race of human beings in rehabilitating
those who had gone over to the majority.  His friend Lafayette Hawkins, of Missouri, thinks that
there is no money in it, but the colonel takes policemen and shows that model and best of all
immortal patrolmen can be furnished at nine cents apiece, and an exceptionally good article at
$120 a gross.  A permanent set of dead Congressmen was suggested, and it was said that Europe
could be furnished with kings who could actually eat dynamite.  Charlemagne and Solomon could
be sold at auction, and the dead heroes of Greece and Rome would be worth millions.  "We will
make a good sale," the colonel continued, "but I must insist on no higgling about a million or two
either way."</p>

<p>Mr. Clemens was recalled after this effort, and told his famous, if somewhat antique, whistling
story.  Mr. Cable, with true pathos and intense feeling, recited "The Fall of Orleans," from his
novel, "Dr. Sevier," and Mr. Clemens came forward to tell how he had lost the editorship in a
Nevada paper in the old time.  This is one of his best efforts, but all who have read his books are
sufficiently acquainted with it.  The Southern problem was again wrestled with by Mr. Cable, and
Mr. Clemens entertained the audience with a ghost story, that sent his auditors home to dream of
golden arms, humbug wounds and mysterious visitors.  The matinee performance was equally
successful, if a little more restricted as to the topics touched upon.</p>

<p>Mr. T.B. Sidebotham, Jr., the manager of this affair, has been promised by Messrs. Twain and
Cable that they will revisit Brooklyn in the Spring, after their trip to California, and give one
performance.</p>
