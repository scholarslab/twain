  <title>Cable's Reading: The Sound of Drums</title>
</head>

<body background="../bkgrnd2.gif">
  <font size="+1">From <b><i>Dr. Sevier</i></b>, Chapter L--</font>

  <p>There came a sound of drums. Twice on such a day, once the day
  before, thrice the next day, till by and by it was the common
  thing. High-stepping childhood, with laths and broom-handles at
  shoulder, was not fated, as in the insipid days of peace, to
  find, on running to the corner, its high hopes mocked by a wagon
  of empty barrels rumbling over the cobble-stones. No; it was the
  Washington Artillery, or the Crescent Rifles, or the Orleans
  Battalion, or, best of all, the blue-jacketed, white-leggined,
  red-breeched, and red-fezzed Zouaves; or, better than the best,
  it was all of them together, their captains stepping backward,
  sword in both hands, calling "<i>Gauche! Gauche!</i>" ("Left!
  Left!") "Guide right!" -- "<i>Portez armes!</i>" and facing
  around again, throwing their shining blades stiffly to belt and
  epaulette, and glancing askance from under their abundant plumes
  to the crowded balconies above. Yea, and the drum-majors before,
  and the brilliant-petticoated <i>vivandieres</i> behind!</p>

  <p>What pomp! What giddy rounds! Pennons and cock-feathers,
  clattering steeds, pealing salvos, banners, columns, ladies'
  favors, balls, concerts, toasts, the Free Gift Lottery -- don't
  you recollect? -- and this uniform and that uniform, brother a
  captain, father a colonel, uncle a major, the little rector a
  chaplain, Captain Ristofalo of the Tiger Rifles; the levee
  covered with munitions of war, steamboats unloading troops,
  troops, troops, from Opelousas, Attakapas, Texas; and a supper to
  this company, a flag to that battalion, farewell sermon to the
  Washington Artillery, tears and a kiss to a spurred and sashed
  lover, hurried weddings, -- no end of them, -- a sword to such a
  one, addresses by such and such, serenades to Miss and to
  Mademoiselle.</p>

  <p>Soon it will have been a quarter of a century ago!</p>

  <p>And yet -- do you not hear them now, coming down the broad,
  granite-paved, moon-lit street, the light that was made for
  lovers glancing on bayonet and sword soon to be red with
  brothers' blood, their brave young hearts already lifted up with
  the triumph of battles to come, and the trumpets waking the
  midnight stillness with the gay notes of the Cracovienne?
  --<br /></p>

  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      "Again, again, the pealing drum,<br />
      The clashing horn, they come, they come,<br />
      And lofty deeds and daring high<br />
      Blend with their notes of victory."
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>Ah! the laughter; the music; the bravado; the
  dancing; the songs! "<i>Voila l'Zouzou!</i>" "Dixie!" "<i>Aux
  armes, vos citoyens!</i>" "The Bonnie Blue Flag!" -- it wasn't
  bonnie very long. Later the maidens at home learned to sing a
  little song, -- it is among the missing now, -- a part of it ran:
  --<br />

  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      "Sleeping on grassy couches;<br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pillowed on hillocks damp;<br />
      Of martial fame how little we know<br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Till brothers are in the camp."
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>By and by they began to depart. How many they were!
  How many, many! We had too lightly let them go. And when all were
  gone, and they of Carondelet street and its tributaries, massed
  in that old gray, brittle-shanked regiment, the Confederate
  Guards, were having their daily dress parade in Coliseum place,
  and only they and the Foreign Legion remained; when sister Jane
  made lint, and flour was high, and the sounds of commerce were
  quite hushed, and in the custom-house gun-carriages were
  a-making, and in the foundries big guns were being cast, and the
  cotton gun-boats and the rams were building, and at the rotting
  wharves the masts of a few empty ships stood like dead trees in a
  blasted wilderness, and poor soldiers' wives crowded around the
  "Free Market," and grass began to spring up in the streets, --
  they were many still, while far away; but some marched no more,
  and others marched on bleeding feet, in rags; and it was very,
  very hard for some of us to hold the voice steady and sing on
  through the chorus of the little song: --<br />

  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      "Brave boys are they!<br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gone at their country's call.<br />
      And yet -- and yet -- we cannot forget<br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That many brave boys must fall."
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>Oh! Shiloh! Shiloh!

  <p>But before the gloom had settled down upon us it was a gay
  dream.</p>
