<br />

 &nbsp; The large and cultivated audience enjoyed the rare treat presented by George W. Cable and Mark Twain in 
the New Haven Opera House last evening.  All the selections were rare and finely rendered.  The first selection, 
"Music of Place Congo," was read by Mr. Cable in an apt style.  The second selection, "Adventures of 
Huckleberry Finn," by Mark Twain, fully sustained the admirable reputation of the other parts of the programme. 
 "Scenes from Dr. Sevier," by Dr. Cable and "Ghost Story" and "A Trying Situation," by Mark Twain, deserve 
especial mention.  The entertainment was a success in every particular and the public will be repaid at any 
time for making efforts to hear these two gentlemen who are now appearing together.<br /><br />
