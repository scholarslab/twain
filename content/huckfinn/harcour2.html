          <p>In his latest story, <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> (Tom
          Sawyer's Comrade), by Mark Twain, Mr. Clemens has made a
          very distinct literary advance over Tom Sawyer, as an
          interpreter of human nature and a contributor to our
          stock of original pictures of American life. Still
          adhering to his plan of narrating the adventures of boys,
          with a primeval and Robin Hood freshness, he has
          broadened his canvas and given us a picture of a people,
          of a geographical region, of a life that is new in the
          world. The scene of his romance is the Mississippi river.
          Mr. Clemens has written of this river before
          specifically, but he has not before presented it to the
          imagination so distinctly nor so powerfully. Huck Finn's
          voyage down the Mississippi with the run away nigger Jim,
          and with occasionally other companions, is an adventure
          fascinating in itself as any of the classic outlaw
          stories, but in order that the reader may know what the
          author has done for him, let him notice the impression
          left on his mind of this lawless, mysterious, wonderful
          Mississippi, when he has closed the book. But it is not
          alone the river that is indelibly impressed upon the
          mind, the life that went up and down it and went on along
          its banks are projected with extraordinary power.
          Incidentally, and with a true artistic instinct, the
          villages, the cabins, the people of this river become
          startlingly real. The beauty of this is that it is
          apparently done without effort. Huck floating down the
          river happens to see these things and to encounter the
          people and the characters that made the river famous
          forty years ago--that is all. They do not have the air of
          being invented, but of being found. And the dialects of
          the people, white and black--what a study are they; and
          yet nobody talks for the sake of exhibiting a dialect. It
          is not necessary to believe the surprising adventures
          that Huck engages in, but no one will have a moment's
          doubt of the reality of the country and the people he
          meets.</p>Another thing to be marked in the story is its
          dramatic power. Take the story of the Southern
          Vendetta--a marvelous piece of work in a purely literary
          point of view--and the episode of the duke and the king,
          with its pictures of Mississippi communities, both of
          which our readers probably saw in the <i>Century</i>
          magazine. They are equaled in dramatic force by nothing
          recently in literature. We are not in this notice telling
          the story or quoting from a book that nearly everybody is
          sure to read, but it is proper to say that Mr. Clemens
          strikes in a very amusing way certain psychological
          problems. What, for instance, in the case of Huck, the
          son of the town drunkard, perverted from the time of his
          birth, is conscience, and how does it work? Most amusing
          is the struggle Huck has with his conscience in regard to
          slavery. His conscience tells him, the way it has been
          instructed, that to help the runaway, nigger Jim to
          escape--to aid in stealing the property of Miss Watson,
          who has never injured him, is an enormous offense that
          will no doubt carry him to the bad place; but his
          affection for Jim finally induces him to violate his
          conscience and risk eternal punishment in helping Jim to
          escape. The whole study of Huck's moral nature is as
          serious as it is amusing, his confusion of wrong as right
          and his abnormal mendacity, traceable to his training
          from infancy, is a singular contribution to the
          investigation of human nature. These contradictions,
          however, do not interfere with the fun of the story,
          which has all the comicality, all the odd way of looking
          at life, all the whimsical turns of thought and
          expression that have given the author his wide fame and
          made him <i>sui generis.</i> The story is so interesting
          so full of life and dramatic force, that the reader will
          be carried along irresistibly, and the time he loses in
          laughing he will make up in diligence to hurry along and
          find out how things come out. The book is a small quarto,
          handsomely printed and bound, and illustrated by 174
          drawings which enter fully into the spirit of the book,
          and really help to set forth the characters. (Published
