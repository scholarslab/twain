 &nbsp; C<font size="-1">OLUMBIA</font>, S.C., N<font size="-1">OV</font>. 18.--The negroes
of Laurens, Newberry, Darlington, Abbeville and several other counties of this State
have been very much stirred up and frightened by the designing carpet-baggers and scalawags,
who have persuaded them that since Cleveland is elected it is the purpose of the white
people of South Carolina to enact laws reestablishing the whipping post, and that they
intend to whip the negroes upon the slightest provocation, whether found guilty or not.
 The more ignorant negroes have also been made to believe that in a few years they will
be remanded back into slavery.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; These absurd stories, though not generally believed by the negroes, have nevertheless
had the effect to cause great uneasiness among those who live in the backwoods, and they
are getting ready in large numbers to emigrate to Arkansas.  It is said that 1,500 will leave
Laurens county early next month, and hundreds will leave Abbeville, Darlington, and Newberry
counties about the same time.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; On the other hand, Prof. D. A. Straker, the well-known colored lawyer, who
was the Republican candidate for Lieutenant-Governor, but who did not receive his party
vote, because the Republican managers did not print his tickets, is quite philosophical
over Cleveland's election.  He declares that it gives the Democrats their great opportunity,
and that perhaps it may be the means of obliterating party distinctions in the South and
insuring the highest prosperity of both the white and colored races.  He cannot see that
anything but good can come of the removal of Federal officeholders, who have been the
stirrers up of strife between the races, and he thinks that the Democrats can by
moderation and wisdom unite the colored people with them on one line of political policy.
 He says that he has done his best to reassure the colored people in some of the upper
counties, who, misled by the false statements of Democratic intentions, have been
greatly agitated, and have been seeking to arrange for emigration to the Southwest.<br /><br />

<center><font size="-1"><b>MISREPRESENTATIONS IN GEORGIA.</b></font></center>

 &nbsp; A<font size="-1">TLANTA</font>, N<font size="-1">OV</font>. 18--The rumors sent out
by unscrupulous correspondents concerning race troubles in the South are utterly and
absolutely false.  Following the announcement of Mr. Cleveland's election to the Presidency,
there was a feeling on the part of the colored people that it might forbode disaster.  This
was aided to some extent by the jocularity of some young men, who would laughingly say to
colored men that they were now worth $1,000 apiece.  The young men did not dream how
sensitive colored men were on this point.  However, the beginning of alarm was promptly
stifled by the leading newspapers of the South and by such men as Senators Brown and
Colquitt of Georgia, Hampton and Butler of South Carolina, and Morgan and Pugh of Alabama.
All of these gentlemen, both in public and in private, have assured the colored people of
their safety in the enjoyment of their rights.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; The country papers of Georgia, without a single exception, have editorials addressed
to the colored people, in which they are kindly urged to pay no attention to idle rumors,
but to rest secure in their constitutional rights.  As for the colored people themselves,
their conduct is admirable.  When, during the war, they were left at home with the wives
and children of Confederate soldiers at their mercy, they acted with absolute trustworthiness.
 When, at the close of the war, they were set adrift and instigated to deeds of devilishness
by incendiary white men who came among them from the North, it stands to their credit
that they gave but little heed to the unscrupulous carpet-baggers.  Now, when about to
witness the transfer of Government from the party to which they ascribe their freedom to
the party controlled by their former masters, they are admirably cool and do their duty well.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; The report of a riot at Dublin in this state was untrue. The reports that at several
fires the negroes have neglected to render proper assistance are likewise false.  The
white and black people, who have solved worse problems than the present, will pass through
the existing crisis in perfect harmony.  The intelligent negroes are not at all troubled,
and the whites are determined that the negro shall not only be secure in his constitutional
rights, but shall also share in the benefits of official patronage.<br /><br />

<center><font size="-1"><b>ALARM IN VIRGINIA.</b></font></center>

 &nbsp; R<font size="-1">ICHMOND</font>, N<font size="-1">OV</font>. 18--Since the election
of Cleveland the negroes of Virginia  have been in a state of alarm, owing to an
impression, undoubtedly provoked by the Republicans, that they would be re-enslaved if
the Democrats got into power.  In the past two days, however, their fears have been
abated, although many of them are still troubled in mind.  Only a few days since an old
darky, living near here, killed his cow, and, when asked the reason, said that he knew his
old master could claim him, but d----d if he should have his cow.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; To-night 200 negroes paraded in the procession here in honor of Cleveland's election.
 They came from Charlotte and Halifax counties, a distance of 100 miles, to unite in the
celebration.  Fears were at one time entertained by members of their race here, but they
proved unfounded.  The colored clubs were the observed of all observers.  White men marched
by them to protect them against any attacks that might be made upon them by angry members
of their race.  The precautions, however, were not necessary.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; Several prominent negroes here have since the election of Cleveland given their
opinion that the negroes in this state would not hereafter vote as a unit with the
Republicans, but the vote would be divided, and a large minority would vote with the
native Virginians.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; The negroes viewed the celebration to-night, and were orderly.  The whites have
made every effort to rid their minds of any groundless fears.<br /><br />

<center><font size="-1"><b>UNEASINESS IN TENNESSEE.</b></font></center>

 &nbsp; C<font size="-1">HATTANOOGA</font>, N<font size="-1">OV</font>. 18--Since the
election of Cleveland there has undoubtedly been some uneasiness among the colored people
here for fear that they would be sold back into slavery, and it is rumored that some of
them have gone so far as to hunt up their old shotguns and pistols in order to resist
such a movement on the part of their old masters.  Feelings of alarm, however, are
confined to the most ignorant among them.  Intelligent and educated negroes are doing
all they can to suppress such fears.  What uneasiness exists originated from the foolish
remarks of white men, who, during the recent celebrations, jokingly told some negroes
that they would be returned to slavery.  No fear need be entertained for this section of
the South.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; N<font size="-1">ASHVILLE</font>, N<font size="-1">OV</font>. 18--Immediately after
it was known that Cleveland had been elected, a report that the victory of the Democratic
party signified the re-enslavement of the colored people in Southern States was circulated
throughout Tennessee.  This falsehood, emanating from negroes, some of whom were actuated
by malice and others by mere ignorance, aroused the gravest fears on the part of many.
The earnest denials that were at once made by those who realized the absurdity of the
story were accepted by many and rejected by others.  The more ignorant negroes, having
labored under the impression for years that the continuance in power of the Republican
party was absolutely essential for their welfare and progress, openly discussed the
matter on the streets, and some were positive in the belief that their days of freedom
were over.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; This erroneous idea was promptly met with emphatic assertions by Democratic
and Republican leaders that the colored element had nothing to fear from Democratic
success, and that time would prove how groundless were their apprehensions.  Prominent
colored pastors have from the pulpit counselled the negroes to put no faith in the
stories which they have been told by those who are inimical to their interests, and
to rest assured that as long as the republic lasts there will be no more slavery.<br /><br />
