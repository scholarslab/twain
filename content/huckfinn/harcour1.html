        <p>The Boston <i>Advertiser</i> attacks Mark Twain as
        venomously and persistently as if his recent suit against a
        Boston publishing-house had been brought against itself;
        and it ventures into declaration which it would have hard
        work to prove. For example, it says that there is
        "something very suggestive in the eagerness and unanimity
        with which library committees and newspapers throughout the
        country have followed the precedent established by the
        Concord library in condemning Mark Twain's last book," but
        it omits to mention the libraries or to list the
        newspapers.</p>

        <p>Indeed, some of the leading newspapers of the country
        have taken the liberty to laugh at the Concord folks for
        their conduct, and the libraries that have rejected the
        volume are, we venture to say, few and far between. They
        must all be of the class that the Concord library belongs
        to; for one of the trustees of that library, when
        interviewed on the matter, said that no fiction was
        permitted on the Concord shelves. Of course, "Huckleberry
        Finn" isn't a true story. It is fiction, and so it's barred
        by this Concord limitation. The discovery that they had
        bought a biography in good faith and had got something that
        was not true may be the cause of the discontent, although
        the life of Huck Finn is not the only biography that
        partakes of the nature of fiction, and the Concord library
        would be further depleted if all biographies that are not
        true were cast out from it.</p>

        <p>The Concord trustees, however, have a right to do as
        they choose and so have the trustees of other libraries.
        The question really is whether the rest have followed the
        Concord lead. To prove it, one must have something more
        than a newspaper assertion. Readers of the <i>Century</i>
        have been immeasurably entertained by the extracts from
        Huck Finn published there, and the book, now that it is on
        the market, is having a very large sale and getting no end
        of advertising from this episode. That is one effect of
        such an attack; but to charge, as the <i>Advertiser</i>
        does, that newspapers and libraries all over the country
        are uniting in condemning the volume is to go as much
        beyond advertising as it is beyond the facts.</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens has recently been elected a member of the
        Concord Free Trade club and in replying to the notice of
        election he takes care of himself in the following
        note:--</p><br />
        <br />

        <center>
          Hartford, March 28, 1885.
        </center><br />
        <i>Frank A. Nichols, Esq., Secretary Concord Free Trade
        Club</i>:--<br />
        Dear Sir,--I am in receipt of your favor of the 24th
        instant, conveying the gratifying intelligence that I have
        been made an honorary member of the Free Trade Club of
        Concord, Massachusetts, and I desire to express to the
        club, through you, my grateful sense of the high compliment
        thus paid me. It does look as if Massachusetts were in a
        fair way to embarrass me with kindnesses this year. In the
        first place, a Massachusetts judge has just decided in open
        court that a Boston publisher may sell, not only his own
        property in a free and unfettered way, but also may as
        freely sell property which does not belong to him but to
        me; property which he has not bought and which I have not
        sold. Under this ruling I am now advertising that judge's
        homestead for sale, and, if I make a good a sum out of it
        as I expect, I shall go on and sell out the rest of his
        property.

        <p>In the next place, a committee of the public library of
        your town have condemned and excommunicated my last book
        and doubled its sale. This generous action of theirs must
        necessarily benefit me in one or two additional ways. For
        instance, it will deter other libraries from buying the
        book; and you are doubtless aware that one book in a public
        library prevents the sale of a sure ten and a possible
        hundred of its mates. And, secondly, it will cause the
        purchasers of the book to read it, out of curiosity,
        instead of merely intending to do so, after the usual way
        of the world and library committees; and then they will
        discover, to my great advantage and their own indignant
        disappointment, that there is nothing objectionable in the
        book after all.</p>

        <p>And finally, the Free Trade Club of Concord comes
        forward and adds to the splendid burden of obligations
        already conferred upon me by the Commonwealth of
        Massachusetts, an honorary membership which is worth more
        than all the rest, just at this juncture, since it indorses
        me as worthy to associate with certain gentlemen whom even
        the moral icebergs of the Concord library committee are
        bound to respect.</p>

        <p>May the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts endure
        forever, is the heartfelt prayer of one who, long a
        recipient of her mere general good will, is proud to
        realize that he is at last become her pet.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanking you again, dear sir, and
        gentlemen,<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        &nbsp; I remain,<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your obliged servant,<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; S.L. Clemens.<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Known to the Concord Winter School of
        Philosophy as "Mark Twain."<br /></p>
