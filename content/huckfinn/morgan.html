 &nbsp; <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i> by Harriet Beecher Stowe may have been spawned as sentimental fiction, but Uncle Tom’s story was never solely a literary event.<br><br>
 &nbsp; Uncle Tom is an enduring icon even today because he was drawn, painted, and inscribed in prints; he was embodied onstage, in photographs, and in motion pictures; his representation was continually refitted to changing social, political, and economic strategies of mainstream America.<br><br>
 &nbsp; Pictures made Uncle Tom “an Uncle Tom.”<br><br>

 &nbsp; It was probably publisher John P. Jewett, who engaged an illustrator to provide the "six elegant designs,” touted in advertisements, plus title page vignette and gilt embossed cover for that original <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i> of 1852.<br><br><br><br>
 &nbsp; Illustrations were special features in books, not common practice, especially for a first time novelist. These may have been a way to compensate for a long story that required a costly, two-volumes.<a href="javascript:Start4('morgannote1.html')"><b>*</b></a>  Uncle Tom’s Cabin developed from June 1851 through April 1852 as regular installments in a Washington, DC, abolitionist weekly <i>The National Era</i>.<a href="javascript:Start4('morgannote2.html')"><b>*</b></a>

 &nbsp; When Stowe first pitched the story to editor Gamaliel Bailey, she claimed her objective in writing a few episodes would be "to hold up in the most lifelike and graphic manner possible Slavery, its reverses, changes, and the negro character, which I have had ample opportunity for studying." As she stated, "There is no arguing with <i>pictures</i> and everybody is impressed with them. . ."<a href="javascript:Start4('morgannote3.html')"><b>*</b></a>  Stowe <i>was</i> an amateur artist, but she was referring to mental pictures.

 &nbsp; Two pictures for that original 1852 edition had no antislavery connections. A gun-toting escaping slave, such as in “The Freeman's Defence,” was not so inspiring as praying families to the middleclass women who comprised the antislavery movement’s target audience. And “Cassy ministering to Uncle Tom after his whipping,” the wild-haired slave woman, strong-willed and shrewd, not to mention sexually tainted, was not a type of femininity easy for women to reconcile.<br><br>

 &nbsp; Among those initial six engravings, “Little Eva reading the Bible to Uncle Tom in the arbor” was, according to Billings’s biographer James F. O'Gorman, “without doubt the most important image of the first edition.”<a href="javascript:Start4('morgannote5.html')"><b>*</b></a>   Unlike the slave Madonna or praying supplicant, there was no visual precedent for a grown black man, in the prime of life, cozied up with a tiny white girl, alone, out in nature.<br>

 &nbsp; Viewed outside the context of the novel, Tom and Eva in the arbor would seem to have been a remarkable sight. Nonetheless, of all Billings’s scenes, this one most captivated viewers. Almost immediately it inspired a painting, songs, sheet music covers, several fine art prints, and all manner of ephemera. Forever after, if a book included illustrations, there among the pages would be Tom and Eva in a garden. Frequently they also graced the cover. <br>

&nbsp; Within a year of publication, the novel went from page to stage as three separate scripts were mounted in New York City. “From the autumn of 1852 until 1931, at least, Uncle Tom's Cabin was never 'off the boards' in America.”<a href="javascript:Start4('morgannote6.html')"><b>*</b></a> <br>

 &nbsp; For many readers, “Little Eva reading the Bible to Uncle Tom in the arbor” is a puzzling sight. Only the story could have prompted Billings to partner a slaveholder’s daughter with a slave, described by Stowe as “a large, broad-chested, powerfully-made man.”<a href="javascript:Start4('morgannote8.html')"><b>*</b></a>   In studying this illustration, I have wondered if Billings’s odd couple became popular precisely because it was sexually charged, implicitly courting the unmentionable, then so unequivocally squelching any chance that the man of African descent could live out his masculine potential.<a href="javascript:Start4('morgannote9.html')"><b>*</b></a>   Most of Billings’s work was conventional, retracing antislavery icons or inspired by traditional art. The exception was of course his rendition of Tom and Eva, new to imagery.  In practice, slaves were not allowed to read, and were sometimes punished for trying to learn. White men had the ordained privilege to speak the Christian word, not slaves with little girls.<a href="javascript:Start4('morgannote10.html')"><b>*</b></a>  The act of reading the Bible together was an undermining of patriarchal authority potentially more disruptive than even abolitionism.<br>

It seems intended to thwart a sexual reading &mdash; to deflect attention from Eva touching Tom’s leg &mdash; but perhaps their Bible study is even more subversive than their intimacy.<br>
