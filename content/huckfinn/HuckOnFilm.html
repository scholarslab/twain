<p> &nbsp; In 1920 William Desmond Taylor made a silent version of <i>Huck Finn</i>.  Since then, by my reckoning there have been six major Hollywood productions of <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> or, sometimes, just <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>:<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1930, directed by Norman Taurog, Paramount;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1939, directed by Richard Thorpe, MGM|Loews;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1960, directed by Michael Curtiz, MGM; <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1974, directed by Lee Thompson, United Artists;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1975, directed by Robert Totten, ABC Circle Films<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1993, directed by Stephen Sommers, Disney.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; Taurog made <i>Huck</i> as a companion film to his production of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>; his is the only film on this list that includes Tom in the cast.</br>
 &nbsp; In his essay "Using Audiovisual Material to Teach <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>," Wesley Britten notes several more movies, some animated, some made for television -- see <i>Making Mark Twain Work in the Classroom</i>, ed. James S. Leonard (Durham: Duke University Press, 1999): 230-36.
