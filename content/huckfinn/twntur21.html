<b><font size="+1">Twain and Cable.</font></b><br />
<br />
<p>The audience which greeted Mark Twain and George W. Cable at the opera house last night
was, in point of numbers, a fair Burlington lecture audience, notwithstanding the
numerous hindering causes--the terrible storm, other entertainments, etc.  Still it was
not what the reputation should have drawn, nor what their performances deserved.  But it
was an intelligent and appreciative audience; as good in this respect, perhaps, as the
city can turn out.</p>

<p>Mark Twain has sustained, undimmed, a first-class reputation as long as any other American
author in the domain of humor.  Mr. Cable's literary fame is comparitively recent; but
he has worked a new literary field, and worked it successfully, and his work has been
reviewed so critically and so copiously that the general reading public has a good idea
of its character.  The joint literary venture of these two singularly mated men is so
unique that it has received a great amount of attention from the press.  So, when Twain and
Cable are announced an audience knows pretty well what to expect.</p>

<p>The program last night provided for the alternate appearance of the two authors, each
reading selections from his own works.  Mr. Cable arrived early in the day, and made his
appearance promptly.  Mr. Clemens waited for the evening train from Keokuk, and it was
delayed.  So Mr. Cable filled up the fore part of the evening with selections from his
own repertory, and Twain occupied the remainder of the time after his arrival.</p>

<p>The extraordinary contrast between the two men heightens the interest of their performance.
Mr. Cable is small and delicate, with finely molded features and form.  He is the
embodiment of grace in speech, diction and manner.  Mark Twain is large, awkward and inclined
to be uncouth.  Mr. Cable's writings bear an exquisite polish, and the same characteristic
is observable in his delivery and his personal bearing.  He is an inimitable actor, as well
as a graceful writer.  As a delineator of character he has few equals.  His touches are
those of the artist who has been a faithful student of nature.</p>

<p>When Mark Twain finally appeared, his first task was to explain the delay.  He said he
had stopped through the day with his mother in Keokuk.  She was eighty-two years old; she
was the only mother he had; their homes being a thousand miles apart he might never see
her again.  He thought he could trust the St. Louis train, but his trust was betrayed.
It started from Keokuk an hour late, and had been getting an hour later ever since.  On
the way they broke something.  A dispute arose as to what it was that was broken.  It
took forty minutes to decide the dispute, and five minutes to repair the damage.  He
detailed his disastrous experience with the German language, wove all the erratic
applications of the German genders into the "Tragic tale of the fishwife," described a
"trying situation" in his foreign travels, in which an American young lady whom he fails
to recognize, insists upon talking to him about "old times," etc.</p>

<p>The audience went home in the best of humor.  They were charmed by Cable and amused and
entertained beyond their expectations by Twain.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss to state here that by an unforeseen occurence a lady who is engaged
in the sale of Mark Twain's "Life on the Mississippi," and who was passing through
Burlington, will be detained here for several days.  She will improve the occasion to
canvass the city for the work.  It is one of Mark Twain's best, and has been before
the public for several years.</p>
