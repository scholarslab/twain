<b><font size="+1">The Mark Twain-Cable Readings.</font></b><br />
<br />
<p>Major J.B. Pond has brought before the public for three readings in this city the names Mark
Twain and George W. Cable, and they have proved a powerful attraction among the most
cultivated and intelligent people of this city.  The first reading was given last night at Association
Hall, where a very select audience assembled, filling three circles of the pretty auditorium.</p>

<p>It is "too late a week" to criticize work so artistic and so well known.  Suffice it to say that Mr.
Cable gave "Narcisse and John and Mary Richling," from "Dr. Sevier," the courting scene in the
same book in which Kate Riley so amusingly chaffs Ristofalo, "Narcisse in Mourning for Lady
Byron," and the great humorist recited, while tears ran down his listeners' cheeks, some scenes
from the advance sheets of the "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" and the "Tragic Tale of the
Fishwife," described "A Trying Situation," one of his funniest efforts, in which a gentleman who
does not recognize a lady, who does recognize him, is utterly mystified and overwhelmingly
embarrassed by her questioning him about a fictitious past, in what she calls "a delightful talk
about old times," and wound up with a ghost story which convulsed his audience.  The next
entertainments will take place at Association Hall on the afternoon and evening of Wednesday,
November 26, when, as Mr. Clemens expresses it, he will "continue to make his last, final farewell
appearance."</p>
