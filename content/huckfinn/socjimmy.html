<b>From <i>The New York Times</i>,<br />
29 November 1874</b><br /><br />

<center><font size="+2"><b>Sociable Jimmy</b></font></center><br /><br />

<p>[I sent the following home in a private letter some time ago from a certain little village. It was in
the days when I was a public lecturer. I did it because I wished to preserve the memory of the
most artless, sociable, and exhaustless talker I ever came across. He did not tell me a single
remarkable thing, or one that was worth remembering; and yet he was himself so interested in his
small marvels, and they flowed so naturally and comfortably from his lips that his talk got the
upper hand of my interest, too, and I listened as one who receives a revelation. I took down what
he had to say, just as he said it -- without altering a word or adding one.]</p>

<p>I had my supper in my room this evening (as usual), and they sent up a bright, simple, guileless
little darky boy to wait on me -- ten years old -- a wide-eyed, observant little chap. I said:</p>

<p>"What is your name, my boy?"</p>
<p>"Dey calls me Jimmy, sah, but my right name's James, sah."</p>
<p>I said, "Sit down there, Jimmy -- I'll not want you just yet."</p>
<p>He sat down in a big arm chair, hung both his legs over one of the arms, and looked
comfortable and conversational. I said:</p>
<p>"Did you have a pleasant Christmas, Jimmy?"</p>
<p>"No, sah -- not zackly. I was kind o' sick den. But de res' o' de people <i>dey</i> had a good
time -- mos' all uv 'em had a good time. Dey all got drunk. Dey all gits drunk heah, every
Christmas, and carries on and has awful good times."</p>
<p>"So you were sick and lost it all. But unless you were <i>very</i> sick I should think that if
you had asked the doctor he might have let you get -- get -- a <i>little</i> drunk -- and -- "</p>
<p>"Oh, no, sah -- I don' never git drunk -- it's de <i>white</i> folks -- dem's de ones I mean. Pa
used to git drunk, but dat was befo' I was big -- but he's done quit. He don' git drunk no mo' now.
Jis' takes one sip in de mawnin', now, cuz his stomach riles up, he sleeps so soun'. Jis' one sip -
over to de s'loon -- every mawnin'. He's powerful sickly -- powerful -- sometimes he can't hardly
git aroun', he can't. He goes to de doctor every week -- over to Ragtown. An' one time he tuck
some stuff, you know, an' it mighty near <i>fetched</i> him. Ain't it dish yer blue vittles dat's pison? --
ain't dat it? -- truck what you pisons cats wid?"</p>
<p>"Yes, blue vittles [vitriol] is a very convincing article with a cat."</p>
<p>"Well, den, dat was it. De ole man, he tuck de bottle and shuck it, and shuck it -- he
seed it was blue, and he didn't know but it was blue mass, which he tuck mos always -- blue mass
pills -- but den he 'spected maybe dish yer truck might be some other kin' o' blue stuff; and so he
sot de bottle down, and drat it if it wa'n't blue vittles, sho' nuf when de doctor come. An' de
doctor he say if he'd a tuck dat blue vittles it would a highsted him, <i>sho</i>. People can't be too
particlar 'bout sich things. Yes, in<i>deedy!</i></p>
<p>"We ain't got no cats heah, 'bout dis hotel. Bill he don't like 'em. He can't stan' a cat no
way. Ef he was to ketch one he'd slam it outen de winder in a minute. Yes he would. Bill's down
on cats. So is de gals -- waiter gals. When dey ketches a cat bummin' aroun' heah, dey jis' <i>scoops</i>
him -- 'deed dey do. Dey snake him into de cistern -- dey's been cats drownded in dat water dat's
in yo' pitcher. I seed a cat in dere yistiddy -- all swelled up like a pudd'n. I bet you dem gals done
dat. Ma says if dey was to drownd a cat for <i>her</i>, de fust one of 'em she ketched she'd jam her into
de cistern 'long wid de cat. Ma wouldn't <i>do</i> dat, I don't reckon, but 'deed an' double, she <i>said</i> she
would. I can't kill a chicken -- well, I kin wring its neck off, cuz dat don't make 'em no sufferin'
scacely; but I can't take and chop dey heads off, like some people kin. It makes me feel so -- so --
well, I kin see dat chicken nights so's I can't sleep. Mr. Dunlap, he's de richest man in dis town.
Some people says dey's fo' thousan' people in dis town -- dis city. But Bill says dey ain't but 'bout
thirty-three hund'd. And Bill he knows, cuz he's lived heah all his life, do' dey <i>do</i> say he won't
never set de river on fire. I don't know how dey fin' out -- I wouldn't like to count all dem people.
Some folks says dis town would be considerable bigger if it wa'n't on accounts of so much lan' all
roun' it dat ain't got no houses on it." [This in perfect seriousness -- dense simplicity -- no
idea of a joke.] "I reckon you seed dat church as you come along up street. Dat's an awful
big church -- awful high steeple. An' it's all solid stone, excep' jes de top part -- de steeple, I
means -- dat's wood. It falls off when de win' blows pooty hard, an' one time it stuck in a cow's
back and busted de cow all to de mischief. It's gwine to kill somebody yit, dat steeple is. A man -- big man, he was -- bigger'n what Bill is -- he tuck it up dere and fixed it again -- an' he didn't
look no bigger'n a boy, he was so high up. Dat steeple's awful high. If you look out de winder
you kin see it." [I looked out, and was speechless with awe and admiration -- which
gratified Jimmy beyond expression. The wonderful steeple was some sixty or seventy feet high,
and had a clock-face on it.]  "You see dat arrer on top o' dat steeple? Well, sah, dat arrer is pooty nigh as big as dis
do' [door]. I seed it when dey pulled it outen de cow. It mus' be awful to stan' in dat steeple when
de clock is strikin' -- dey say it is. Booms and jars so's you think the world's a comin' to an end. I
wouldn't like to be up dere when de clock's a strikin'. Dat clock ain't just a <i>striker</i>, like dese
common clocks. It's a <i>bell</i> -- jist a reglar <i>bell</i> -- and it's a buster. You can hear dat bell all over dis
city. You ought to hear it boom, boom, boom, when dey's a fire. My sakes! Dey ain't got
no bell like dat in Ragtown. <i>I</i> ben to Ragtown, and I ben mos' halfway to Dockery [thirty miles].
De bell in Ragtown's got so old now she don't make no soun' scacely."</p>
<p>[Enter the landlord -- a kindly man, verging toward fifty. My small friend,
without changing position, says]:</p>
<p>"Bill, didn't you say dat dey was only thirty-three hund'd people in dis
city?"</p>
<p>"Yes, about thirty-three hundred is the population now."</p>
<p>"Well, some folks says dey's fo' thousan'."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know they do; but it isn't correct."</p>
<p>"Bill, I don't think this gen'lman kin eat a whole prairie chicken, but de tole me to fetch
it all up."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right -- he ordered it."</p>
<p>[Exit "Bill," leaving me comfortable; for I had been perishing to know who
"Bill" was.]</p>
<p>"Bill, he's de oldest. And he's de bes', too. Dey's fo'teen in dis fam'ly -- all boys an'
gals. Bill he suppo'ts 'em all -- an' he don' never complain -- he's <i>real</i> good, Bill is. All dem
brothers an' sisters o' his'n ain't no 'count -- all ceptin' dat little teeny one dat fetched in dat milk.
Dat's Kit, sah. She ain't only nine year ole. But she's de mos' lady-like one in de whole bilin'.
You don't never see Kit a-rairin' an' a chargin' aroun' an' kickin' up her heels like de res' o' de gals
in dis fam'ly does gen'ally. Dat was Nan dat you hearn a cuttin' dem shines on de pi-anah while
ago. An' sometimes ef she don't rastle dat pi-anah when she gits started! <i>Tab</i> can't hole a candle
to <i>her</i>, but Tab kin <i>sing</i> like de very nation. She's de only one in dis fam'ly dat can sing. You
don't never hear a yelp outen Nan. Nan can't sing for shucks. I'd jes lieves hear a tom-cat dat's got
scalded. Dey's fo'teen in dis fam'ly 'sides de ole man and de ole 'ooman -- all brothers an' sisters.
But some of 'em don't live heah -- do' Bill he suppo'ts 'em -- lends 'em money, an' pays dey debts
an' he'ps 'em along. I tell you Bill he's <i>real</i> good. Dey all gits drunk -- all 'cep Bill. De ole man he
gits drunk, too, same as de res' uv 'em. Bob, he don't git drunk much -- jes' sloshes roun' de
s'loons some, an' takes a dram sometimes. Bob he's next to Bill -- bout forty year old. Dey's all
married -- all de fam'ly's married -- cep' some of de gals. Dere's fo'teen. It's de biggest fam'ly in
dese parts, dey say. Dere's Bill -- Bill Nubbles -- Nubbles is de name; Bill, an' Grig, an' Duke, an'
Bob, an' Nan, an' Tab, an' Kit, an' Sol, an' Si, an' Phil, an' Puss, an'Jake, an' Sal -- Sal she's
married an' got chil'en as big as I is -- an' Hoss Nubbles, he's de las'. Hoss is what dey mos'
always calls him, but he's got another name dat I somehow disremember, it's so kind o' hard to
git de hang of it." [Then, observing that I had been taking down the extraordinary list of
nicknames for adults, he said:] "But in de mawnin' I can ask Bill what's Hoss's other name,
an' den I'll come up an' tell you when I fetches yo' breakfast. An' maybe I done got some o' dem
names mixed up, but Bill, he kin tell me. Dey's fo'teen."</p>
<p>By this time he was starting off with the waiter (and a pecuniary consideration for his
sociability), and, as he went out, he paused a moment and said:</p>
<p>"Dad fetch it, somehow dat other name don't come. But, anyways, you jes read dem
names over and see if dey's fo'teen." [I read the list from the flyleaf of Longfellow's <i>New
England Tragedies</i>.] "Dat's right, sah. Dey's all down. I'll fetch up Hoss's other name in the
mawnin', sah. Don't you be oneasy."</p>
