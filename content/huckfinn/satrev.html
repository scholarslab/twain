The boy of to-day is fortunate indeed, and, of a truth, he is to be
congratulated. While the boy of yesterday had to stay his stomach
with the unconscious humour of <i>Sandford and Merton</i>, the boy
of to-day may get his fill of fun and of romance and of adventure in
<i>Treasure Island</i> and in <i>Tom Brown</i> and in <i>Tom
Sawyer</i>, and now in a sequel to <i>Tom Sawyer</i>, wherein Tom
himself appears in the very nick of time, like a young god from the
machine. Sequels of stories which have been widely popular are not
a little risky. <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> is a sharp exception to this
general rule. Although it is a sequel, it is quite as worthy of wide
popularity as <i>Tom Sawyer</i>. An American critic once neatly
declared that the late G. P. R. James hit the bull's-eye of success with
his first shot, and that for ever thereafter he went on firing through the
same hole. Now this is just what Mark Twain has not done.
<i>Huckleberry Finn</i> is not an attempt to do <i>Tom Sawyer</i>
over again. It is a story quite as unlike its predecessor as it is like.
Although Huck Finn appeared first in the earlier book, and although
Tom Sawyer reappears in the later, the scenes and the characters are
otherwise wholly different. Above all, the  atmosphere of the story is
different. <i>Tom Sawyer</i> was a tale of boyish adventure in a
village in Missouri, on the Mississippi river, and it was told by the
author. <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> is autobiographic; it is a tale of
boyish adventure along the Mississippi river told as it appeared to
Huck Finn. There is not in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> any one scene
quite as funny as those in which Tom Sawyer gets his friends to
whitewash the fence for him, and then uses the spoils thereby acquired
to attain the highest  situation of the Sunday school the next morning.
Nor is there any  description quite as thrilling as that awful moment in
the cave when the  boy and the girl are lost in the darkness, and when
Tom Sawyer  suddenly sees a human hand bearing a light, and then
finds that the  hand is the hand of Indian Joe, his one mortal enemy;
we have always  thought that the vision of the hand in the cave in
<i>Tom Sawyer</i> is one of  the very finest things in the literature
of adventure since Robinson  Crusoe first saw a single footprint in the
sand of the seashore. But  though <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> may not quite
reach these two highest points  of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>, we incline to
the opinion that the general level of the later story is perhaps higher
than that of the earlier. For one thing, the skill with which the
character of Huck Finn is maintained is marvellous. We see everything
through his eyes -- they are his eyes and not a pair of Mark Twain's
spectacles. And the comments on what he sees are his comments --
the comments of an ignorant, superstitious, sharp, healthy boy,
brought up as Huck Finn had been brought up; they are not speeches
put into his mouth by the author. One of the most artistic things in the
book -- and that Mark Twain is a literary artist of a very high order all
who have considered his later writings critically cannot but confess
-- one of the most artistic things in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> is the
sober self-restraint with which Mr. Clemens lets Huck Finn set down,
without any comment at all, scenes which would have afforded the
ordinary writer matter for endless moral and political and sociological
disquisition. We refer particularly to the account of the
Grangerford-Shepherdson feud, and of the shooting of Boggs by
Colonel Sherburn. Here are two incidents of the rough old life of the
South-Western States, and of the Mississippi Valley forty or fifty
years ago, of the old life which is now rapidly passing away under the
influence of advancing civilization and increasing commercial
prosperity, but which has not wholly disappeared even yet, although
a slow revolution in public sentiment is taking place. The
Grangerford-Shepherdson feud is a vendetta as deadly as any Corsican
could wish, yet the parties to it were honest, brave, sincere, good
Christian people, probably people of deep religious sentiment. Not the
less we see them taking their guns to church, and, when occasion
serves, joining in what is little better than a general massacre. The
killing of Boggs by Colonel Sherburn is told with equal sobriety and
truth; and the later scene in which Colonel Sherburn cows and lashes
the mob which has set out to lynch him is one of the most vigorous
bits of writing Mark Twain has done.</p>

<p>In <i>Tom Sawyer</i> we saw Huckleberry Finn from the outside;
in the  present volume we see him from the inside. He is almost as
much a  delight to any one who has been a boy as was Tom Sawyer.
But only he or she who has been a boy can truly enjoy this record of
his adventures, and of his sentiments and of his sayings. Old maids of
either sex will wholly fail to understand him or to like him, or to see
his significance and his value. Like Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn is a
genuine boy; he is neither a girl in boy's clothes like many of the
modern heroes of juvenile fiction, nor is he a 'little man,' a full-grown
man cut down; he is a boy, just a boy, only a boy. And his ways and
modes of thought are boyish. As Mr. F. Anstey understands the
English boy, and especially the English boy of the middle classes, so
Mark Twain understands the American boy, and especially the
American boy of the Mississippi Valley of forty or fifty years ago. The
contrast between Tom Sawyer, who is the child of respectable
parents, decently brought up, and Huckleberry Finn, who is the child
of the town drunkard, not brought up at all, is made distinct by a
hundred artistic touches, not the least natural of which is Huck's
constant reference to Tom as his ideal of what a boy should be. When
Huck escapes from the cabin where his drunken and worthless father
had confined him, carefully manufacturing a mass of very
circumstantial evidence to prove his own murder by robbers, he
cannot help saying, 'I did wish Tom Sawyer was there. I knowed he
would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy
touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a
thing as that.' Both boys have their full share of boyish imagination;
and Tom Sawyer, being given to books, lets his imagination run on
robbers and pirates and genies, with a perfect understanding with
himself that, if you want to get fun out of this life, you must never
hesitate to make believe very hard; and, with Tom's youth and health,
he never finds it hard to make believe and to be a pirate at will, or to
summon an attendant spirit, or to rescue a prisoner from the deepest
dungeon 'neath the castle moat. But in Huck this imagination has
turned to superstition; he is a walking repository of the juvenile
folklore of the Mississippi Valley -- a folklore partly traditional among
the white settlers, but largely influenced by intimate association with
the negroes. When Huck was in his room at night all by himself
waiting for the signal Tom Sawyer was to give him at midnight, he felt
so lonesome he <a name="1">wished</a> he was dead:</p><br />

<p>The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods
ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about
somebody that was dead, and a whippowill
and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind
was trying to whisper something to me,
and I couldn't make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers
run over me. Then away out in the woods I
heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell
about something that's on its mind and
can't make itself understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave, and
has to go about that way every night
grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some
company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling
up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and
before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I
didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and
would fetch me some bad luck, so I was
scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned
around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied
up a little lock of my hair with a thread to
keep witches away. But I hadn't no confidence. You do that when you've
lost a horseshoe that you've found,
instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever heard
anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck
when you'd killed a spider. </p><br /></td>

<p>When I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny
-- the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint
dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome
and  like everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and
quivers  the leaves, it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like
it's spirits  whispering -- spirits that's been dead ever so many years
-- and you always think they're talking about  you. As a general thing
it makes a body wish he was dead, too, and done with it all.

Now, none of these sentiments are appropriate to Tom Sawyer, who
had none of the feeling for nature which Huck Finn had caught during
his numberless days and nights in the open air. Nor could Tom Sawyer
either have seen or set down this instantaneous <a

It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black outside, and
lovely; and the rain would thrash along by
so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby;
and here would come a blast of wind that
would bend the trees down and turn up the pale under-side of the
leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust
would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if
they was just wild; and next, when it was
just about the bluest and blackest -- fst! it was as bright as glory,
and you'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops
a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards
further than you could see before; dark as sin
again in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful
crash, and then go rumbling,
grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side of the world,
like rolling empty barrels down stairs
-- where it's long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.

The romantic side of Tom Sawyer is shown in most delightfully
humorous fashion in the account of his difficult devices to aid in the
easy escape of Jim, a runaway negro. Jim is an admirably drawn
character. There have been not a few fine and firm portraits of negroes
in recent American fiction, of which Mr. Cable's Bras-Coup&eacute;
in the <i>Grandissimes</i> is perhaps the most vigorous, and Mr.
Harris's Mingo and Uncle Remus and Blue Dave are the most gentle.
Jim is worthy to rank with these; and the essential simplicity and
kindliness and generosity of the Southern negro have never been
better shown than here by Mark Twain. Nor are Tom Sawyer and
Huck Finn and Jim the only fresh and original figures in Mr. Clemens's
new book; on the contrary, there is scarcely a character of the many
introduced who does not impress the reader at once as true to life --
and therefore as new, for life is so varied that a portrait from life is
sure to be as good as new. That Mr. Clemens draws from life, and yet
lifts his work from the domain of the photograph to the region of art,
is evident to any one who will give his work the honest attention
which it deserves. Mr. John T. Raymond, the American comedian,
who performs the character of Colonel Sellers to perfection, is wont
to say that there is scarcely a town in the West and South-West where
some man did not claim to be the original of the character. And as
Mark Twain made Colonel Sellers, so has he made the chief players
in the present drama of boyish adventure; they are taken from life, no
doubt, but they are so aptly chosen and so broadly drawn that they are
quite as typical as they are actual. They have one great charm, all of
them -- they are not written about and about; they are not described
and dissected and analysed; they appear and play their parts and
disappear; and yet they leave a sharp impression of indubitable vitality
and individuality. No one, we venture to say, who reads this book will
readily forget the Duke and the King, a pair of as pleasant 'confidence
operators' as one may meet in a day's journey, who leave the story in
the most appropriate fashion, being clothed in tar and feathers and
ridden on a rail. Of the more broadly humorous passages -- and they
abound -- we have not left ourselves space to speak; they are to the
full as funny as in any of Mark Twain's other books; and, perhaps, in
no other book has the humourist shown so much artistic restraint, for
there is in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> no mere 'comic copy,' no straining
after effect; one  might almost say that there is no waste word in it.
Nor have we left  ourselves room to do more than say a good word
for the illustrations,  which, although slight and unpretending, are far
better than those to be  found in most of Mark Twain's books. For one
thing, they actually  illustrate -- and this is a rare quality in illustrations
nowadays. They give  the reader a distinct idea of the Duke and the
King, of Jim and of Colonel Sherburn, of the Shepherdsons and the
Grangerfords. They are all by one artist, Mr. E. W. Kemble, hitherto
known to us only as the illustrator of the <i>Thompson Street Poker
Club</i>, an amusing romance of highly-coloured life in New York.
