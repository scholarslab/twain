        <blockquote>
          [<i>Under the above heading, the New Orleans</i>
          Times-Democrat <i>on 2 February 1885 reprinted attacks on
          Cable's essay from six papers in Louisiana, Alabama and
          Mississippi. ("Job-printers" is a reference to the way
          Cable himself demeaned the southern press in his
          interview with a reporter from</i> The New York
          Tribune<i>.) Below are excerpts from four of the
          reprinted articles.</i>]
        </blockquote>We say, without fear of successful
        contradiction, that nothing has ever yet been said or
        written characterized by more unfairness, more transparent
        bitterness toward Southern people and Southern habits of
        thought, more radical in its views, or more calculated to
        excite dissatisfaction on the part of the negro, and lead
        to the assertion of claims which, if practically asserted,
        would issue in widening the breach between him and the
        white man, and probably eventuate in strife and bloodshed,
        than this article from the pen of Mr. Geo. W. Cable, a
        Southern man, the son and grandson of Southern men, and a
        Confederate soldier, as he himself is pleased to inform us.

        . . . we find that his paper is entirely one-sided -- all
        for the freedman and nothing for the free man. . . . Mr.
        Cable denies the existence of race instinct, and seeking
        the negro's social elevation, would demolish, though he
        does not say so, all the barriers of social caste. Hence it
        is, perhaps, that he is eloquently silent as to what would
        be the consequences in social circles -- if so be any could
        possibly exist under his levelling process -- of the
        mingling of the two races in concert halls, in steamboat
        cabins dining and lodging side by side, in houses of
        worship, and in the schoolhouse -- the very nursery of
        social as well as of intellectual manhood and progress. . .
        .

        We greatly feared when that brilliant young man, George W.
        Cable, the Southern novelist, delivered the lecture last
        summer at Tuskaloosa, Ala., which aroused his audience to
        such a spirited state of indignation, on account of the
        sentiment it contained touching the social question -- that
        the sun of his popularity in the South would soon go down
        in darkness . . .

        <p>The white races, in conclusion, have filled the world
        with their glory and their numbers, as is now the fact
        before the eyes of all men, and the white man and the white
        woman are paramount in all the improvements of the earth.
        They will set their faces like flint against the
        sentimentalism of our Mr. Cable. . . they will at the same
        time see to it that the separation of the two races in our
        theatres, council halls, public schools, churches, etc.,
        shall be enforced in the interest of both whites and
        blacks. . . .</p>

        . . . The negro needs no incentive to push himself where he
        is not wanted, and such fellows as Cable are aiding and
        encouraging them in this already growing and pernicious
        direction, which will never result in any good for the
        colored people.
