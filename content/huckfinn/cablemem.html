        <blockquote>
          [<i>George Washington Cable was one of the speakers at
          the memorial service held for MT in New York on 30
          November 1910. He devoted the second half of his remarks
          to his recollections of the tour he took with MT,
          which, in remarks delivered at MT's Seventieth Birthday
          Dinner, he'd called "one of the most notable experiences
          of my life."</i>]
        </blockquote>It is because of that hold [MT] has on all our
        hearts -- and I speak for the whole American people -- it
        was that spirit that caused an audience once in Paris,
        Kentucky, who had applauded him until their palms were sore
        and until their feet were tired, and who had laughed as he
        came forward for the fourth alternation of our reading
        together -- the one side of him dragging, one foot limping
        after the other -- the peculiar way known to us all -- the
        house burst into such a storm of laughter, coming from so
        crowded a house, that Mark Twain himself, grim controller
        of his emotions at all times, burst into laughter and had
        to acknowledge to me, as he came off the platform: "Yes,
        yes" -- still laughing with joy of it himself -- "yes; they
        got me off my feet that time."

        <p>I remember the hold he had upon children's hearts,
        another field of his human kindness to all humankind. It is
        illustrated in an experience he had in Cincinnati when
        certain children were brought by their aunt to hear Mark
        Twain read from his pages in that great city, brought down
        from the town of Hamilton, and who went back home in the
        late hours of the night, beside themselves with the delight
        of their clear understanding and full appreciation of his
        humor, saying to their kinswoman: "Oh, Auntie! Oh, Auntie!
        It was better than Buffalo Bill!"</p>

        <p>One point I should like to make to indicate the
        conscientiousness with which he held himself the custodian
        of the affections of the great mass of the people who loved
        him in every quarter of the land. It was the rigor of his
        art, an art which was able to carry the added burden beyond
        the burden of all other men's art, the burden of absolutely
        concealing itself and of making him appear, whenever he
        appeared, as slipshod in his mind as he was in his gait. We
        were at Toronto, Canada. The appointment was for us to read
        two nights in succession, and he had read one night. The
        vast hall was filled to overflowing. I heard from the
        retiring room the applause that followed every period of
        his utterance, heard it come rolling in and tumbling like
        the surf of the ocean. Well, at last, as we were driving
        home to our hotel, I found him in an absolutely wretched
        condition of mental depression, groaning and sighing, and
        all but weeping, and I asked him what in the world
        justified such a mood -- a man who had just come from such
        a triumph. "Such a triumph?" he said. "A triumph of the
        moment; but those people are going home to their beds, glad
        to get there, and they will wake up in the morning ashamed
        of having laughed at my nonsense."</p>

        <p>"Nonsense?" I said. "How is it nonsense?"</p>

        <p>"I have spent the evening, and their time, and taxed
        them to the best of their ability to show appreciation of
        my wit and humor, and I have spent that whole time simply
        spinning yarns."</p>

        <p>I said: "Don't mind; you are going to meet virtually the
        very same audience to-morrow, and to-morrow night you shall
        give them good literature, if any living writer in a living
        language has got that chance." I don't know if he slept
        that night, but I know he did what he did not often relish.
        He rehearsed, and rehearsed, and rehearsed, and the next
        night he gave them a programme which he chose to begin, at
        my suggestion, with the <i>Blue Jay's Message</i>. He left
        that house as happy as any one ever saw Mark Twain, and
        that was with a feeling of acute joy because he had won
        friends he considered worthy, he had won every handclap and
        applause with a programme worthy of honor.</p>

        <p>One more point: every one knows that one of his passions
        was for history, and I assume that that passion for history
        was one of the demonstrations of his human kindness. It was
        the story of the human heart, and he loved history because
        it was the story of humanity.</p>

        <p>One night we were in Rochester together. It was Saturday
        night, and for a wonder we were without an engagement that
        night, so we started out for a walk; we had gone a few
        steps when we found a bookstore, and at the same moment it
        was beginning to rain. I said: "Let us go in here." He
        said: "I remember I have not provided myself with anything
        to read all day to-morrow." I said: "We will get it here. I
        will look down that table, and you will look down this."
        Presently I went over to him and said I had not found
        anything that I thought would interest him, and asked him
        if he had found anything. He said no, he had not; but there
        was a book he did not remember any previous acquaintance
        with. He asked me what that book was.</p>

        <p>"Why," I said, "that is Sir Thomas Malory's <i>Morte
        d'Arthur</i>." And he said: "Shall we take it?" I said:
        "Yes; and you will never lay it down until you have read it
        from cover to cover." It was easy enough to make the
        prophecy, and, of course, it was fulfilled. He had read in
        it a day or two, when I saw come upon his cheekbones those
        vivid pink spots which every one who knew him intimately
        and closely knew meant that his mind was working with all
        its energies. I said to myself: "Ah, I think Sir Thomas
        Malory's <i>Morte d'Arthur</i> is going to bear fruit in
        the brain of Mark Twain." A year or two afterward, when he
        came to see me in my Northhampton home, I asked him what he
        was engaged in, and he said he was writing a story of <i>A
        Yankee at the Court of King Arthur</i>. I said: "If that be
        so, then I claim for myself the godfathership of that
        book." He said: "Yes; you are its godfather." I can claim
        no higher honor than to have the honor to claim that here
        and now, to-night, and to rejoice with you that we are able
        to offer a tribute to our affection to the memory of Mark
        Twain.</p>
