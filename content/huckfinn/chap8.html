  <p>Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most
  everything. I said it looked to me like all the signs was about
  bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn't any good-luck signs.
  He says:</p>

  <p>"Mighty few -- an' dey ain't no use to a body. What you want
  to know when good luck's a-comin' for? Want to keep it off?" And
  he said: "Ef you's got hairy arms en a hairy breas', it's a sign
  dat you's agwyne to be rich. Well, dey's some use in a sign like
  dat, 'kase it's so fur ahead. You see, maybe you's got to be po'
  a long time fust, en so you might git discourage' en kill yo'sef
  'f you didn' know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich
  bymeby."</p>

  <p>"Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"What's de use to ax dat question? Don't you see I has?"</p>

  <p>"Well, are you rich?"</p>

  <p>No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. Wunst I
  had foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat'n', en got busted
  out."</p>

  <p>"What did you speculate in, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"Well, fust I tackled stock."</p>

  <p>"What kind of stock?"</p>

  <p>"Why, live stock -- cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in a
  cow. But I ain' gwyne to resk no mo' money in stock. De cow up
  'n' died on my han's."</p>

  <p>"So you lost the ten dollars."</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't lose it all. I on'y los' 'bout nine of it. I
  sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents."</p>

  <p>"You had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate
  any more?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You know that one-laigged nigger dat b'longs to old
  Misto Bradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in
  a dollar would git fo' dollars mo' at de en' er de year. Well,
  all de niggers went in, but dey didn't have much. I wuz de on'y
  one dat had much. So I stuck out for mo' dan fo' dollars, en I
  said 'f I didn' git it I'd start a bank mysef. Well, o' course
  dat nigger want' to keep me out er de business, bekase he says
  dey warn't business 'nough for two banks, so he say I could put
  in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en' er de
  year.</p>

  <p>"So I done it. Den I reck'n'd I'd inves' de thirty-five
  dollars right off en keep things a-movin'. Dey wuz a nigger name'
  Bob, dat had ketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn' know it;
  en I bought it off'n him en told him to take de thirty-five
  dollars when de en' er de year come; but somebody stole de
  wood-flat dat night, en nex day de one-laigged nigger say de
  bank's busted. So dey didn' none uv us git no money."</p>

  <p>"What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I 'uz gwyne to spen' it, but I had a dream, en de dream
  tole me to give it to a nigger name' Balum -- Balum's Ass dey
  call him for short; he's one er dem chuckleheads, you know. But
  he's lucky, dey say, en I see I warn't lucky. De dream say let
  Balum inves' de ten cents en he'd make a raise for me. Well,
  Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in church he hear de
  preacher say dat whoever give to de po' len' to de Lord, en boun'
  to git his money back a hund'd times. So Balum he tuck en give de
  ten cents to de po', en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to come of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Well, what did come of it, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"Nuffn never come of it. I couldn' manage to k'leck dat money
  no way; en Balum he couldn'. I ain' gwyne to len' no mo' money
  'dout I see de security. Boun' to git yo' money back a hund'd
  times, de preacher says! Ef I could git de ten cents back, I'd
  call it squah, en be glad er de chanst."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's all right anyway, Jim, long as you're going to be
  rich again some time or other."</p>

  <p>"Yes; en I's rich now, come to look at it. I owns mysef, en
  I's wuth eight hund'd dollars. I wisht I had de money, I wouldn'
  want no mo'."</p>
