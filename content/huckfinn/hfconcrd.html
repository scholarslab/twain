        <p>"The directors of the Concord Public Library have joined
        in the general scheme to advertise MARK TWAIN'S new book,
        'Huckleberry Finn.' They have placed it on the <i>Index
        Expurgatorius</i>, and this will compel every citizen of
        Concord to read the book in order to see why the guardians
        of his morals prohibited it." So reported the <i>St. Louis
        Post-Dispatch</i> on 17 March 1885 in one of the earliest
        newspaper accounts of the first time <i>Huck Finn</i> was
        banned.</p><br />

        <p>The fullest account that I know of appeared the next
        day, in the <i>New York Herald</i>. The tone seems to
        support the decision <a name="a" id="a">of the</a> Library
        directors.</p>

        <p>On 23 March 1885 the <i>Boston Daily Advertiser</i>
        reported that "in papers from one end of the country to the
        other the statement is published and commented upon that
        the public library committee of Concord has marked
        'Huckleberry Finn' as unworthy of a place on its shelves."
        Many papers supported the Library's decision.</p>

<p>It was disapproved and even ridiculed in others, including the
        <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, which on 29 March 1885
        printed a strong defense <a name="b" id="b">of the</a>
        novel.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting reverberations of the Library's action occurred
at the New York State Reformatory for juvenile delinquents, which consulted a professor
about whether the book belonged in <i>their</i> library.  (Huck, of course,
proposes to reform himself in Chapters 16 and 31, when his conscience rebukes him for helping a
runaway slave -- these may be the kind of episodes that Professor Sanborn has in mind
when he recommends using MT's novel in the institution's "Practical Morality Class.")</p>

<p>The controversy about <i>Huck Finn</i> also became an occasion for some contemporaries to re-examine the character of
"Mark Twain" himself, as a man and as a writer.  At the end of March, <i>The Critic</i> reprinted examples of this debate side-by-side:</p>

        </center><br />

        <p>From the beginning of the controversy the <i>Hartford
        Courant</i> had loyally defended the book. On 4 April 1885
        it summed up the affair in an article that included the
        response MT himself made for the public record, where he
        too treats the <a name="c" id="c">event</a> as a form of
        advertising.</p>
