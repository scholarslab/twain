<p> &nbsp; If you miss of hearing Twain and Cable you will always regret it.</p>

<p> &nbsp; A <font size="-1">COMBINATION</font> of genius and versatility that appeals

<p> &nbsp; T<font size="-1">HE</font> pathetically discouraged look of Twain's face

tears.</p><br />

<p> &nbsp; R<font size="-1">ESERVED</font> seats at Muir's for the Twain--Cable entertainment. 
Price of tickets only two-thirds what is charged for this combination elsewhere.</p><br />

<p> &nbsp; S<font size="-1">EW</font> a double row of buttons on your vest, bring 
out the old bandana, and thus be fully prepared alike for wit or pathos, at the 
Twain--Cable readings.</p><br />

<p> &nbsp; A<font size="-1">RE</font> we awake to the fact that Mark Twain, the inimitable,  
the first of humorists, will actually read from his own writings, on Monday evening, 
in Evanston?</p><br />

<p> &nbsp; T<font size="-1">HE</font> great American humorist--Mark Twain.  Mark Twain's 
wit and Cable's humor and pathos combined, to make the most popular combination of the 
season.</p><br />

<p> &nbsp; N<font size="-1">O DISAPPOINTMENT</font> as to Twain and Cable's readings, 
because they will positively spend Monday in Chicago, and therefore cannot be kept 
away from Evanston by anything less than a miracle.</p><br />

<p> &nbsp; T<font size="-1">EN</font> years ago Twain bade farewell to the platform 
and began his unprecedented success as an author.  At the solicitation of the public 
Twain returns to the platform for one more season and finds the universal public 
more anxious than ever to sit under his fascination.</p>

<center><b><a name="a">MARK TWAIN'S PLAY.</a></b></center>
<p> &nbsp; On the production at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, New York, of "Ah Sin, 
the Heathen Chinee," the joint production of Bret Harte and Mark Twain, the latter 
gentleman, upon being called before the curtain, made the following speech:--</p>
<p> &nbsp; "This," said he, "is a very remarkable play.  I don't know as you 
noticed it as it went along, but it is.  The construction of this play and the 
development of the story are the result of great research, and erudition, and 
genius, and invention--and plagiarism.  When the authors wrote it, they thought 
they would put in a great lot of catastrophes and murders, and such things, because 
they always enliven an evening so; but we wanted to have some disaster that wasn't 
hackneyed, and, after a good deal of thought, we hit upon the breaking-down of a 
stage-coach.</p>
<p> &nbsp; "The worst thing of getting a good original idea like that is the 
temptation to overdo it; and in fact, when the play was all done, we found that we 
had got that stage-coach breaking down seven times in the first act.  It was to 
come right along here every seven minutes or so, and spill all its passengers over 
on the musicians.  Well, you see, that wouldn't do; it made it monotonous for the 
musicians, and it was too stagey; and we had to modify it; and there isn't anything 
left of the original plan now except one break-down of the coach, and one carriage 
break-down, and one pair of runaway horses.  Maybe we might have spared even some 
of these; but you see we had the horses, and we didn't like to waste them.  I wish 
to say also that this play is didactic rather than anything else.  It is intended 
rather for instruction than amusement.</p>
<p> &nbsp; "The Chinaman is getting to be a pretty frequent figure in the United 
States, and is going to be a great political problem; and we thought it well for 
you to see him on the stage before you had to deal with that problem.  Then, for 
the instruction of the young, we have introduced a game of poker.  There are a few 
things that are so unpardonably neglected in our country as poker.  The upper class 
no very little about it.  Now and then you find ambassadors who have a sort of 
general knowledge of the game, but the ignorance of the people at large is fearful. 
Why, I have known clergy-men, good men, kind-hearted, liberal and all that, who did 
not know the meaning of a 'flush.'  It is enough to make one ashamed of one's 
species.</p>
<p> &nbsp; "When our play was finished, we found it was so long, and so broad, and 
so deep--in places--that it would have taken a week to play it. I thought it was 
all right; we could put 'To be continued' on the curtain and run it straight along. 
But the manager said 'No'; it would get us into trouble with the general public, and 
into trouble with the general Government, because the Constitution forbids the 
infliction of cruel or unusual punishment.  So he cut out, and cut out, and the 
more he cut out the better the play got. I never saw a play that was so much improved 
by being cut down; and I believe it would have been one of the very best plays in 
the world if his strength had held out so that he could have cut out the whole of 
it."</p>
