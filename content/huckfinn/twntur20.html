<b><font size="+1">The Twain-Cable Entertainment.</font></b><br />
<br />
<p>The Twain-Cable entertainment at the Court House on New Year's night was not 
in the nature of lectures, but consisted chiefly of recitations.  Interspersed 
with these were anecdotes, Creole songs, incidents of travel, and personal 
experiences under circumstances of embarrassment, the most perplexing, ludicrous, 
and convulsively amusing.  Humor, at once genuine and refined, is a rare gift.  It 
is better than physic.  It dispels gloom, sheds sunshine into the care-worn heart, 
and like a touch of kindness, "makes the whole world kin."</p>

<p>The house was handsomely filled, and we never saw a more highly amused, or 
better pleased audience.</p>

<p>Mark Twain in appearance is a sort of living and moving anecdote.  In manner, quaint, 
easy and unctious; his voice, deep bass and drawling, like an old fashioned country 
preacher, wearing a benevolent, but solemn countenance, he creates the impression that 
he would make sinners howl if he got after them in evangelistic style.</p>

<p>Cable is somewhat younger in appearance; is spruce and polished, a fine reader and 
delineator of character, and a good actor with splendid voice in song.  He would be 
classed by Zack Chandler as one of "them litterary fellers."</p>

<p>Each, is accomplished in his part, and to be appreciated must be seen.</p>

<p>We commend to the stammering fraternity a complete cure, as illustrated by Mark Twain.</p>

<center><font size="-1">NOTES.</font></center>

<p>Rev. Mr. McMillan &amp; Co., who employed them, say they came out without loss.</p>

<p>There were pleasant parties from all the adjoining counties at the lecture of Twain 
and Cable.</p>

<p>Mark Twain reminds some persons of Lee C. Smith, one of our plain Bourbon farmers, who 
makes less pretence to wit than anyone else.</p>

<p>Mr. Cable is a little the rise of 40 years and Twain not yet 50.  The former has five 
children, and the latter, three; only one wife each.</p>

<p>We could enjoy very much Mr. Twain's description of his feelings in talking with the 
lady who professed to know him so well, while he was entirely ignorant of whom she was. 
We are often caught similarly.</p>

<p>After the lecture we invited them to the party at Mr. Gass', saying they could dance 
with the handsomest ladies in the Blue-grass region.  "Oh, I would like so much to go," 
said Clemons.  "So would I," said Cable, "but we must take rest."</p>

<p>When Twain and Cable took the sleeper here for Cincinnati, they found Gath also aboard.  
The latter lectured in Charleston, West Virginia, Thursday night, to about 400 persons, 
and was bound for Indiana, also to lecture.  "We you last saw me you left me in Lexington," 
he said to us.  "I left there next morning, and stopping in Cincinnati, by some mistake 
I got only part of my letter about Lexington published, the part creditable to her being 
omitted.</p>
