        <p>The pre-publication of parts of <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>
        in the <i>Century Magazine</i> resulted mainly from the
        determination of the editor, Richard Watson Gilder, who
        wanted to publish the whole novel serially, talked MT into
        an excerpt for his December, 1884, issue, then convinced MT
        to let him print two further installments, in January and
        February, 1885. MT participated in these publications,
        though apparently Gilder selected which parts to use, and
        apparently too did most of the expurgating by which aspects
        of the novel were "adapted to our audience."</p>

        <p>For the December excerpt, Gilder chose the
        Shepherdson-Grangerford feud chapters (17 &amp; 18), using
        a piece from Chapter 19 to lead into it, and getting MT to
        write a brief introductory in which MT refers to the novel
        as the story of "two fugitives" -- Huck and Jim. Only a few
        expurgations were made in this installment.</p>

        <p>In November, Gilder attended a performance by MT and
        Cable in New York, where he probably heard MT enact at least one of the
        comic dialogues between Jim and Huck that occur early in the novel, about "speculatin' in
        stock" and "King Sollermun." It was presumably at that time
        that Gilder arranged to publish other parts of <i>Huck
        Finn</i> in the first two issues of 1885. In the January
        <i>Century</i> he printed those two dialogues together. Among the
        several differences between the <i>Century</i> version and
        the novel, the most significant, and to me ominous, is the
        way Jim's concluding remark about being rich is changed,
        from "I owns myself...I wish I had de money" to "I owns
        myself...but live stock's too resky, Huck; I wisht I had de
        eight hund'd dollars en somebody else had de nigger."  That
particular change is one the MT himself was responsible for, as we can
tell from transcript of MT's December performance of the dialogue in Canada, as
published by a reviewer for the Toronto <i>Globe</i>.  According to <a href="twintur11.html#a">his report</a>,
for a live audience the conversation ended with Jim saying "Still, betwixt you an' me, I don't like it invested
in dat way.  My experience in live stock is resky; makes no difference if its in cows
or niggers, its resky, an' I would feel much more easy if I had de eight hundred dollars
an' somebody else had de nigger."

        <p>The February excerpt was the longest, and the most
        heavily revised. It is an abridged version of Huck's
        misadventures with the King and the Duke (from Chapters
        19-28). On the three pages included below (of 22
        altogether) can be noted some representative alterations,
        including Gilder's efforts at cleaning up "The Royal
        Nonesuch." The installment comes to an abrupt end, but not
        before it is made clear that the two rascals will be
        exposed.</p>
