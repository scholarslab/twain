        <p>[<i>As part of a special Christmas issue, the New York</i>
        World <i>featured a page of scenes from Mark Twain's
        best-known books, as depicted by various artists. The paper
        made a point of boasting that it had hired Kemble, "the
        original illustrator," to do these three new pictures
        from</i> Huck Finn<i>. The pictures Kemble drew clearly
        reflect his career as a cartoonist -- the re-presentations
        of Jim are even more grotesquely comic than the pictures he
        drew in 1884. The scene at the bottom left, showing two
        whites expressing horror at "Jim's" appearance, is
        particularly unpleasant. It isn't based on anything that
        actually happens in the novel, but is extrapolated from the
        idea the Duke comes up with to allow Jim to stay on the
        raft without being tied up. In other words, this scene only
        "occurs" in Kemble's imagination, though it also seemed
        "real" enough to the people who admired his drawings. By
        clicking onto the image map below, you can see enlargements
        of the three drawings -- or a transcription of the brief
        but very telling synopsis of the novel supplied by the
        paper.]</i></p>
