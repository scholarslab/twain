          <h3>Narcisse in Mourning</h3>
        </center><font size="+1">From <b><i>Dr. Sevier</i></b>,
        Chapter XLV--</font>

        <p>[Richling's] revery was interrupted.</p>

        <p>"Mistoo Itchlin, 'ow you enjoyin' yo' 'ealth in that
        beaucheous weatheh juz at the pwesent? Me, I'm well. Yes,
        I'm always well, in fact. At the same time nevvatheless, I
        fine myseff slightly sad. I s'pose 'tis natu'al -- a man
        what love the 'itings of Lawd By'on as much as me. You
        know, of co'se, the melancholic intelligens?"</p>

        <p>"No," said Richling; "has any one" --</p>

        <p>"Lady By'on, seh. Yesseh. 'In the mids' of life' -- you
        know where we ah, Mistoo Itchlin, I su-pose?"</p>

        <p>"Is Lady Bryon dead?"</p>

        <p>"Yesseh." Narcisse bowed solemnly. "Gone, Mistoo
        Itchlin. Since the seventeenth of last; yesseh. 'Kig the
        bucket,' as the povvub say." He showed an extra band of
        black drawn neatly around his new straw hat. "I thought it
        but p'opeh to put some moaning -- as a species of twibute."
        He restored the hat to his head. "You like the tas'e of
        that, Mistoo Itchlin?"</p>

        <p>Richling could but confess the whole thing was
        delicious.</p>

        <p>"Yo' humble servan', seh," responded the smiling Creole,
        with a flattered bow. Then, assuming a gravity becoming the
        historian, he said: --</p>

        <p>"If fact, 'tis a gweat mistake, that statement that Lawd
        By'on evva qua'led with his lady, Mistoo Itchlin. But I
        s'pose you know 'tis but a slandeh of the pwess. Yesseh.
        As, faw instance, thass anotheh slandeh of the pwess that
        the delegates qua'led ad the Chawleston convention. They
        only pwetend to qua'l; so, by that way, to mizguide those
        A<i>bol</i>ish-nists. Mistoo Itchlin, I am p'ojecting to
        'ite some obitua' 'emawks about that Lady By'on, but I
        scass know w'etheh to 'ite them in the poetic style aw in
        the p'osaic. Which would you conclude, Mistoo Itchlin?"</p>

        <p>Ritchling reflected with downcast eyes.</p>

        <p>"It seems to me," he said, when he had passed his hand
        across his mouth in apparent meditation and looked up, --
        "seems to me I'd conclude both, without delay."</p>

        <p>"Yes? But accawding to what fawmule, Mistoo Itchlin?
        'Ay, 'tis theh is the 'ub,' in fact, as Lawd By'on say. Is
        it to migs the two style' that you advise?"</p>

        <p>"That's the favorite method," replied Richling.</p>

        <p>"Well, I dunno 'ow 'tis, Mistoo Itchlin, but I fine the
        moze facil'ty in the poetic. 'Tis t'ue, in the poetic you
        got to look out concehning the '<i>ime</i>. You got to keep
        the eye skin' faw it, in fact. But in the p'osaic, on the
        cont'a-ay, 'tis juz the opposite; you got to keep the eye
        skin' faw the <i>sense</i>. Yesseh. Now, if you migs the
        two style' -- well -- 'ows that, Mistoo Itchlin, if you
        migs them? Seem' to me I dunno."</p>

        <p>"Why, don't you see?" asked Richling. "If you mix them,
        you avoid both necessities. You sail triumphantly between
        Scylla and Charybdis without so much as skinning your
        eyes."</p>

        <p>Narcisse looked at him a moment with a slightly
        searching glance, dropped his eyes upon his own beautiful
        feet, and said, in a meditative tone: --</p>

        <p>"I believe you co'ect." But his smile was gone, and
        Richling saw he had ventured too far.</p>

          <h3>Mary's Night Ride</h3>
        </center><font size="+1">From <b><i>Dr. Sevier</i></b>,
        Chapter LIV--</font>

        <p>About the middle of that night Mary Richling was sitting
        very still and upright on a large dark horse that stood
        chomping at his Mexican bit in the black shadow of a great
        oak. Alice rested before her, fast asleep, against her
        bosom. Mary held by the bridle another horse, whose naked
        saddle-tree was empty. A few steps in front of her the
        light of the full moon shone almost straight down upon a
        narrow road that just there emerged from the shadow of
        woods on either side, and divided into a main right fork
        and a much smaller one that curved around to Mary's left.
        Off in the direction of the main fork the sky was all aglow
        with camp-fires. Only just here on the left there was a
        cool and grateful darkness.</p>

        <p>She lifted her head alertly. A twig crackled under a
        tread, and the next moment a man came out of the bushes at
        the left, and without a word took the bridle of the led
        horse from her fingers and vaulted into the saddle. The
        hand that rested a moment on the cantle as he rose grasped
        a "navy-six." He was dressed in dull homespun, but he was
        the same who had been dressed in blue. He turned his horse
        and led the way down the lesser road.</p>

        <p>"If we'd of gone three hundred yards further," he
        whispered, falling back and smiling broadly, "we'd a' run
        into the pickets. I went nigh enough to see the videttes
        settin' on their hosses in the main road. This here aint no
        road; it just goes up to a nigger quarters. I've got one o'
        the niggers to show us the way."</p>

        <p>"Where is he?" whispered Mary; but, before her companion
        could answer, a tattered form moved from behind a bush a
        little in advance and started ahead in the path, walking
        and beckoning. Presently they turned into a clear, open
        forest and followed the long, rapid, swinging stride of the
        negro for nearly an hour. Then they halted on the bank of a
        deep, narrow stream. The negro made a motion for them to
        keep well to the right when they should enter the water.
        The white man softly lifted Alice to his arms, directed and
        assisted Mary to kneel in her saddle, with her skirts
        gathered carefully under her, and so they went down into
        the cold stream, the negro first, with arms outstretched
        above the flood; then Mary, and then the white man, -- or,
        let us say plainly the spy, -- with the unawakened child on
        his breast. And so they rose out of it on the farther side
        without a shoe or garment wet save the rags of their dark
        guide.</p>

        <p>Again they followed him, along a line of stake-and-rider
        fence, with the woods on one side and the bright moonlight
        flooding a field of young cotton on the other. Now they
        heard the distant baying of house-dogs, now the doleful
        call of the chuck-will's-widow; and once Mary's blood
        turned, for an instant, to ice, at the unearthly shriek of
        the hoot-owl just above her head. At length they found
        themselves in a dim, narrow road, and the negro
        stopped.</p>

        <p>"Dess keep dish yeh road fo' 'bout half mile an' you
        strak 'pon the broad, main road. Tek de right, an' you go
        whah yo' fancy tek you."</p>

        <p>"Good-by," whispered Mary.</p>

        <p>"Good-by, miss," said the negro, in the same low voice;
        "good-by, boss; don't you fo'git you promise tek me thoo to
        de Yankee' when you come back. I 'feered you gwine fo'git
        it, boss."</p>

        <p>The spy said he would not, and they left him. The
        half-mile was soon passed, though it turned out to be a
        mile and a half, and at length Mary's companion looked
        back, as they rode single file, with Mary in the rear, and
        said softly, "There's the road," pointing at its broad,
        pale line with his six-shooter.</p>

        <p>As they entered it and turned to the right, Mary, with
        Alice again in her arms, moved somewhat ahead of her
        companion, her indifferent horsemanship having compelled
        him to drop back to avoid a prickly bush. His horse was
        just quickening his pace to regain the lost position when a
        man sprang up from the ground on the farther side of the
        highway, snatched a carbine from the earth and cried,
        "Halt!"</p>

        <p>The dark, recombent forms of six or eight others could
        be seen, enveloped in their blankets, lying about a few red
        coals. Mary turned a frightened look backward and met the
        eyes of her companion.</p>

        <p>"Move a little faster," said he, in a low, clear voice.
        As she promptly did so she heard him answer the challenge.
        His horse trotted softly after hers.</p>

        <p>"Don't stop us, my friend; we're taking a sick child to
        the doctor."</p>

        <p>"Halt, you hound!" the cry rang out; and as Mary glanced
        back three or four men were just leaping into the road. But
        she saw, also, her companion, his face suffused with an
        earnestness that was almost an agony, rise in his stirrups,
        with the stoop of his shoulders all gone, and wildly cry:
        --</p>

        <p>"Go!"</p>

        <p>She smote the horse and flew. Alice awoke and
        screamed.</p>

        <p>"Hush, my darling!" said the mother, laying on the
        withe; "mamma's here. Hush, darling! -- mamma's here. Don't
        be frightened, darling baby! O God, spare my child!" and
        away she sped.</p>

        <p>The report of a carbine rang out and went rolling away
        in a thousand echoes through the wood. Two others followed
        in sharp succession, and there went close by Mary's ear the
        waspish whine of a minnie-ball. At the same moment she
        recognized, once, -- twice, -- thrice, -- just at her back
        where the hoofs of her companion's horse were clattering,
        -- the tart rejoinders of his navy-six.</p>

        <p>"Go!" he cried again. "Lay low! lay low! cover the
        child!" But his words were needless. With head bowed
        forward and form crouched over the crying, clinging child,
        with slackened rein and fluttering dress, and sun-bonnet
        and loosened hair blown back upon her shoulders, with lips
        compressed and silent prayers, Mary was riding for life and
        liberty and her husband's bed-side.</p>

        <p>"O mamma! mamma!" wailed the terrified little one.</p>

        <p>"Go on! Go on!" cried the voice behind; "they're
        saddling -- up! Go! go! We're goin' to make it. We're goin'
        to <i>make</i> it! Go-o-o!"</p>
