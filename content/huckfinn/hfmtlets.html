<blockquote>[<i>While on the tour MT wrote letters to his wife, Olivia, almost every other day.  Eighteen of
his letters are included in Dixon Wecter's </i>Love Letters of Mark Twain<i>, and it is from that
selection that the following excerpts have been taken.  Most of the letters were written in hotel
rooms, before or, more often, just after his <a name="a">performance.</a>  They are signed "S<font size="-1">AML</font>."</i>]</blockquote>

<i>from New York, Saturday [November 22], after midnight -- </i><br />
<p><font color="CC3333">Livy dear, only a line to say we finished the <i>eighth</i> performance for this week in
Brooklyn Academy of Music at 10 this evening, &amp; then came over the Bridge &amp; home.  Tired to
death, &amp; hungry.  Disposed of two great chops, 3 eggs, fried potatoes, &amp; a bottle of ale.  I eat a
big breakfast every morning &amp; a big supper every night, &amp; am growing fat.  We got up at 6 this
morning, &amp; have talked to two huge houses in Brooklyn to-day.  Mr. Beecher &amp; the Sages were
there tonight &amp; Dean came <a name="b">behind</a> the scenes.</font></p>

<i>from Grand Rapids, December 13 -- </i><br />
<p><font color="CC3333"> Only one word, my darling, to say we have ridden the whole day in the train, &amp; now I am in
bed for an hour to rest me before going on the platform.  You &amp; the children have been in my
mind all the day, &amp; I have been very homesick &amp; still am.  I ate a lot of chestnuts that I found in
my overcoat pockets, &amp; that brought the children very near to me, for all three of them
contributed to that stock.  I love you, dear, &amp; the time <a name="c">seems</a> very long, that remains yet betwixt
us &amp; meeting.</font></p>

<i>from Pittsburgh, December 29 -- </i><br />
<p><font color="CC3333"> Well, mamma, dear, the child is born.  To-night I read the new piece -- the piece which Clara
Spaulding's impassibility dashed &amp; destroyed months ago -- &amp; it's the biggest card I've got in my
whole repertoire.  I always thought so.  It went a-booming; &amp; Cable's praises are not merely loud,
they are boisterous.  Says its literary quality is high &amp; fine -- &amp; great; its truth to boy nature
unchallengeable; its humor constant &amp; delightful; &amp; its dramatic close full of stir, &amp; boom, &amp; 
<i>go</i>.  Well, he has stated it very correctly.  It took me 45 minutes to recite it, (didn't use any
notes) &amp; it hadn't a doubtful place in it, or a silent spot.  Ah, if it goes like that in its crude rude
state, how <i>won't</i> it go when I get it well in hand?  I make 2 separate readings of it, &amp; 
Cable sings a couple of songs in the middle.</font></p>
<p><font color="CC3333"> Come to think, I guess Clara never heard this -- nor you either: I got disgusted, that night,
before I got <i>to</i> this, I think.  This is merely the episode where Tom &amp; Huck stock Jim's
cabin with reptiles, &amp; then set him free, in the night, with the <a name="d">crowd</a> of farmers after them with
guns.</font></p>

<i>from Paris [Kentucky], New Year's -- </i><br />
<p><font color="CC3333"> Livy darling, we have had a most pleasant evening here -- in a region familiar to Ma when
she was a girl some seventy or eighty years ago.  Whenever we strike a Southern audience they
laugh themselves all to pieces.  They catch a point before you can get it out -- &amp; then, if you are
not a muggins, you <i>don't</i> get it out; you leave it unsaid.  It is a great delight to <a name="e">talk</a> to such
folks.</font></p>

<hr width="50%" /><br />
<i>from Chicago, January 18 -- </i><br />
<p><font color="CC3333">We've had an immense time here with these three big audiences in this noble Central Music
Hall.  But for the fearful storm, we would have turned people away from the doors.  It is a
beautiful place, &amp; you should have seen that alert &amp; radiant mass of well-dressed humanity, rising
tier on tier clear to the slope of the ceiling.  Last night was the greatest triumph we have ever
made. I played my new bill, containing The Jumping Frog of Calaveras County (cut it down &amp; 
told it in 13 minutes -- quickest time on record) &amp; Tom &amp; Huck setting Jim free from prison -- 25
minutes -- but it just went with a long roll of artillery-laughter all down the line, interspersed with
Congreve rockets &amp; bomb shell explosions, from the first word to the last -- &amp; then after a thrice-
repeated crash of encores, I came back &amp; talked a ten-minute yarn (Gov. Gardiner) -- on the stage
35 minutes, you see, &amp; no harm done -- encored again <i>after</i> the encore, &amp; came back &amp; 
bowed.  And mind I tell the old Jumping Frog swept the place like a conflagration.  Nothing in
this world can beat <i>that</i> yarn when one is feeling good &amp; has the right audience in front of
him.</font></p>
  <p><font color="CC3333">We've got a new plan, &amp; it <i>works</i>.  Cable goes on at the very stroke of the hour, &amp; 
talks 15 minutes to an <i>assembling</i> house, telling them not to be concerned about
<i>him</i> &amp; <i>he</i> won't be troubled.  And so, with all the encores, we have in no instance
been on stage a minute over 2 hours.  The good effect is beyond estimation.  (And privately,
<i>another</i> thing -- only half the house hear C.'s first piece -- so there isn't too much of C any
more -- whereas heretofore there has been a <a name="f">thundering</a> sight too much of him.)</font></p>

<i>from Columbus, February 10 -- </i><br />
<p><font color="CC3333">Livy darling, rode all day in a smoking car, yesterday, stopping every 30 yards, arrived here in
a rain storm about 2 hours after dark, jumped into evening dress in a desperate hurry &amp; came
before a full OperaHouse of the handsomest people you ever saw, &amp; made them shout, &amp; tore
them all to pieces till half past 10, &amp; not an individual deserted till the thing was over.  I have been
3 months learning my trade, but I have <i>learned</i> it at last, &amp; now I would rather stand
before such an audience as that than play billiards.  After the show (&amp; a hot supper) Pond &amp; I
<i>did</i> play billiards until 2 A.M., &amp; then I scoured myself in the bath, &amp; read &amp; smoked till
3, then slept till half past 9, had my breakfast in bed, &amp; now have just finished that meal &amp; am
feeling as fine as a bird.</font></p>
