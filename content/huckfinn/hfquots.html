<a name="d">You don't know</a> me, without you have read a book by the name of "The Adventures of 'Tom Sawyer,' " but that ain't no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth mainly. There were things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied, one time or another, without it was "Aunt Polly" or the widow, or maybe "Mary." "Aunt Polly"--Tom's "Aunt Polly," she is--and "Mary," and the "widow Douglas," is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book; with stretchers, as I said before.</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="e">Now the way</a> the book winds up is this: "Tom" and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got $6,000 a piece--all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up. Well, "Judge Thatcher," he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round--more than a body could tell what to do with. The "widow Douglas," she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal, regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so, when I could stand it no longer, I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But "Tom Sawyer," he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="a">The stars</a> were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods
ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about
somebody that was dead, and a whippowill
and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind
was trying to whisper something to me,
and I couldn't make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers
run over me. Then away out in the woods I
heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell
about something that's on its mind and
can't make itself understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave, and
has to go about that way every night
grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some
company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling
up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and
before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I
didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and
would fetch me some bad luck, so I was
scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned
around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied
up a little lock of my hair with a thread to
keep witches away. But I hadn't no confidence. You do that when you've
lost a horseshoe that you've found,
instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever heard
anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck
when you'd killed a spider. </blockquote>

It was all black, no gray; so was his long, mixed-up whiskers. There warn't no colorin his face, where his face showed--it was white; not like another man's white, but a white to make a body sick, a whote to make a body's flesh crawl--a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white.

so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby;

would bend the trees down and turn up the pale under-side of the

further than you could see before; dark as sin

grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side of the world,
like rolling empty barrels down stairs

Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle, don't hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it. Hold the needle still and poke the thread at it--that's the way a woman most always does, but a man always does 'tother way. And when you throw at a rat or anything hitch yourself up a-tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to turn on--like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one side, like a boy. And mind you, when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don't clap them together the way you did when you catched the lump of lead. Why, I spotted you for a  boy when you was threading the needle, and I contrived the other things just to make certain."</blockquote>

<p>I begun to get it through my head that he was most free—and who was to blame for it?  Why, me.  I couldn’t get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn’t rest; I couldn’t stay still in one place.  It hadn’t ever come home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing.  But now it did; and it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more.  I tried to make out to myself that I warn’t to blame, because I didn’t run Jim off from his rightful owner; but it warn’t no use, conscience up and says, every time, “But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody.”  That was so—I couldn’t get around that noway.  That was where it pinched.  Conscience says to me, "What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word?  What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean?  Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how.  That’s what she done."</p>

<p>. . . Here was this nigger, which I had as good as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children—children that belonged to a man I didn’t even know; a man that hadn’t ever done me no harm.</p>

<p>. . . My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to it, “Let up on me—it ain’t too late yet—I’ll paddle ashore at the first light and tell.”  I felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off.  All my troubles was gone. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="l"><p>Col. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.  He was a gentleman all over; and so was his family.  He was well born, as the saying is, and that’s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn’t no more quality than a mudcat himself.  Col.  Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say.  His forehead was high, and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.  He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.  There warn’t no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn’t ever loud.  He was as kind as he could be—you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence.  Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards.  He didn’t ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners—everybody was always good-mannered where he was.  Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always—I mean he made it seem like good weather.  When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn’t nothing go wrong again for a week.</p>

<p>When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn’t set down again till they had set down.  Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom’s and Bob’s was mixed, and then they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and madam;” and they bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.</p>

<p>Bob was the oldest and Tom next—tall, beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes.  They dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and wore broad Panama hats.</p>

<p>Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn’t stirred up; but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks, like her father.  She was beautiful.</p>

<p>So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind.  She was gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.</p>

<p>Each person had their own nigger to wait on them—Buck too.  My nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn’t used to having anybody do anything for me, but Buck’s was on the jump most of the time.</p>

<p>This was all there was of the family now, but there used to be more—three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.</p>

<p>The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers. Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes, and balls at the house nights.  These people was mostly kinfolks of the family.  The men brought their guns with them.  It was a handsome lot of quality, I tell you. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="j">Well, then,</a> pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside, and stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody saying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was all busy listening. The king was saying -- in the middle of something he'd started in on -- </p>

<p>" -- they bein' partickler friends o' the diseased. That's why they're invited here this evenin'; but tomorrow we want <i>all</i> to come -- everybody; for he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it's fitten that his funeral orgies sh'd be public." </p>

<p>And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke he couldn't stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper, "<i>Obsequies</i>, you old fool," and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and reaching it over people's heads to him. The king he reads it and puts it in his pocket, and says: </p>

<p>"Poor William, afflicted as he is, his <i>heart's</i> aluz right. Asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeral -- wants me to make 'em all welcome. But he needn't a worried -- it was jest what I was at." </p>

<p>Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca'm, and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before. And when he done it the third time he says: </p>

<p>"I say orgies, not because it's the common term, because it ain't -- obsequies bein' the common term -- but because orgies is the right term. Obsequies ain't used in England no more now -- it's gone out. We say orgies now in England. Orgies is better, because it means the thing you're after more exact. It's a word that's made up out'n the Greek <i>orgo</i>, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew <i>jeesum</i>, to plant, cover up; hence inter. So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public funeral." </p>

<p>He was the <i>worst</i> I ever struck.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="i">When the place</a> was packed full the undertaker he  
slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on  
the last touches, and getting  
people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and  
making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke;  
he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he  
opened up passageways, and done it with nods, and  
signs with his hands. Then he took his place over  
against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest,  
stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn't no more  
smile to him than there is to a ham.</p>

<p>They had borrowed a melodeum  --  a sick one; and  
when everything was ready a young woman set down  
and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky,  
and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the  
only one that had a good thing, according to my  
notion. Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow  
and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the  
most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body
ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most  
powerful racket, and he kept it up right along; the  
parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait  
 --  you couldn't hear yourself think. It was right  
down awkward, and nobody didn't seem to know what  
to do. But pretty soon they see that long-legged
undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to  
say, "Don't you worry  --  just depend on me." Then  
he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall,  
just his shoulders showing over the people's heads.  
So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and more  
outrageous all the time; and at  
last, when he had gone around two sides of the room,  
he disappears down cellar. Then in about two seconds  
we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a  
most amazing howl or two, and then everything was  
dead still, and the parson begun his solemn talk where  
he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker's back and  
shoulders gliding along the wall  
again; and so he glided and glided around three sides  
of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth  
with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the  
preacher, over the people's heads, and says, in a kind  
of a coarse whisper, "He had a rat!" Then he 
drooped down and glided along the wall again to his  
place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to the  
people, because naturally they wanted to know. A  
little thing like that don't cost nothing, and it's just the  
little things that makes a man to be looked up to and  
liked. There warn't no more popular man in town  
than what that undertaker was.</blockquote>
