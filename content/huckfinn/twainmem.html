<center><h2>"when I returned to the platform"</h2></center>

<blockquote>[<i>During the last decade of his life MT worked intermittently on his
autobiography in a series of dictations to a stenographer. In the dictation for 10 October 1907 he
took up the subject of platform readings and his 1884-1885 tour with Cable.  Looking back over his whole
career as a platform artist, he defines this tour in the larger context of 19th-century
American literary entertainment.  As MT himself said, by this time of life he could remember
better the things that had never happened.  Cable's salary, for example, was $450 a week, not $600.  And in the second half of this dictation MT "remembers" and recreates the
way he says he delivered the anecdote of "His Grandfather's Old Ram" as part of the repertoire he
used on tour to illustrate his point that a written piece must be transformed
before it can be used in an oral performance.  Since there's no record that the "Old Ram" piece
was ever used on this tour, however, I've omitted that part of his "reminiscences" from this part of
the archive.</i>]</blockquote>

<p>What is called a "reading," as a public platform entertainment, was first essayed by Charles
Dickens, I think.  He brought the idea with him from England in 1867.  He had made it very
popular at home and he made it so acceptable and so popular in America that his houses were
crowded everywhere, and in a single season he earned two hundred thousand dollars.  I heard him
once during that season; it was in Steinway Hall, in December, and it made the fortune of my life -- not in dollars, I am not thinking of dollars; it made the real fortune of my life in that it made the
happiness of my life; on that day I called at the St. Nicholas Hotel to see my <i>Quaker City</i>
Excursion shipmate, Charley Langdon, and was introduced to a sweet and timid and lovely young
girl, his sister.  The family went to the Dickens reading, and I accompanied them.  It was forty
years ago; from that day to this the sister has never been out of my mind nor heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Dickens read scenes from his printed books.  From my distance he was a small and slender
figure, rather fancifully dressed, and striking and picturesque in appearance.  He wore a black
velvet coat with a large and glaring red flower in the button-hole.  He stood under a red
upholstered shed behind whose slant was a row of strong lights -- just such an arrangement as
artists use to concentrate a strong light upon a great picture.  Dickens's audience sat in a pleasant
twilight, while he performed in the powerful light cast upon him from the concealed lamps.  He
read with great force and animation, in the lively passages, and with stirring effect.  It will be
understood that he did not merely read but also acted.  His reading of the storm scene in which
Steerforth lost his life was so vivid, and so full of energetic action, that his house was carried off
its feet, so to speak.</p>

<p>Dickens had set a fashion which others tried to follow, but I do not remember that anyone was
any more than temporarily successful in it.  The public reading was discarded after a time and was
not resumed until something more than twenty years after Dickens had introduced it; then it rose
and struggled along for a while in that curious and artless industry called Authors' Readings. 
When Providence had had enough of that kind of crime the Authors' Readings ceased from
troubling and left the world at peace.</p>

<p>Lecturing and reading were quite different things; the lecturer didn't use notes or manuscript or
book, but got his lecture by heart and delivered it night after night in the same words during the
whole lecture season of four winter months.  The lecture field had been a popular one all over the
country for many years when I entered it in 1868; it was then at the top of its popularity; in every
town there was an organization of citizens who occupied themselves in the off season, every year,
in arranging for a course of lectures for the coming winter; they chose their platform people from
the Boston Lecture Agency list and they chose according to the town's size and ability to pay the
prices.  The course usually consisted of eight or ten lectures.  All that was wanted was that it
should pay expenses; that it should come out with a money balance at the end of the season was
not required.  Very small towns had to put up with fifty-dollar men and women, with one or two
second-class stars at a hundred dollars each as an attraction; big towns employed hundred-dollar
men and women altogether, and added John B. Gough, or Henry Ward Beecher, or Anna
Dickinson, or Wendell Phillips, as a compelling attraction; large cities employed this whole battery
of stars.  Anna Dickinson's price was four hundred dollars a night; so was Henry Ward Beecher's;
so was Gough's, when he didn't charge five or six hundred.  I don't remember Wendell Phillips's
price but it was high.</p>

<p>I remained in the lecture field three seasons -- long enough to learn the trade; then domesticated
myself in my new married estate after a weary life of wandering, and remained under shelter at
home for fourteen or fifteen years.  Meantime, speculators and money-makers had taken up the
business of hiring lecturers, with the idea of getting rich at it.  In about five years they killed that
industry dead and when I returned to the platform for a season, in 1884, there had been a happy
and holy silence for ten years, and a generation had come to the front who knew nothing about
lectures and readings and didn't know how to take them nor what to make of them.  They were
difficult audiences, those untrained squads, and Cable and I had a hard time with them
sometimes.</p>

<p>Cable had been scouting the country alone for three years with readings from his novels, and he
had been a good reader in the beginning for he had been born with a natural talent for it, but
unhappily he prepared himself for his public work by taking lessons from a teacher of elocution,
and so by the time he was ready to begin his platform work he was so well and thoroughly
educated that he was merely theatrical and artificial and not half as pleasing and entertaining to a
house as he had been in the splendid days of his ignorance.  I had never tried reading as a trade
and I wanted to try it.  I hired Major Pond on a percentage to conduct me over the country, and I
hired Cable as a helper at six hundred dollars a week and expenses, and we started out on our
venture.</p>

<p>It was ghastly!  At least in the beginning.  I had selected my readings well enough, but had not
studied them.  I supposed it would only be necessary to do like Dickens -- get out on the platform
and read from the book.  I did that and made a botch of it.  Written things are not for speech; their
form is literary; they are stiff, inflexible, and will not lend themselves to happy and effective
delivery with the tongue -- where their purpose is to merely entertain, not instruct; they have to be
limbered up, broken up, colloquialized, and turned into the common forms of unpremeditated talk
-- otherwise they will bore the house, not entertain it.  After a week's experience with the book I
laid it aside and never carried it to the platform again; but meantime I had memorized those
pieces, and in delivering them from the platform they soon transformed themselves into flexible
talk, with all their obstructing precisenesses and formalities gone out of them for good.</p>

<blockquote>[<i>MT then read into his autobiographical record the performance text of the
"Grandfather's Ram" story, and concluded the day's dictation with some further remarks on the
techniques of live performance.  The piece he refers to below, "The Golden Arm," was one he
regularly used to end his readings.  He mentions the 1895-96 tour around the world, but the ghost
story was also the way most of the shows on the Twins of Genius tour ended
too.</i>]</blockquote>

<p>The greatest actor would not be able to carry his audience by storm with a book in his hand;
reading from the book renders the nicest shadings of delivery impossible.  I mean those studied
fictions which seem to be the impulse of the moment and which are so effective: such as, for
instance, fictitious hesitancies for the right word, fictitious unconscious pauses, fictitious
unconscious side remarks, fictitious unconscious embarrassments, fictitious unconscious
emphases placed upon the wrong word with a deep intention back of it -- these and all other artful
fictive shades which give to a recited tale the captivating naturalness of an impromptu narration
can be attempted by a book reader and are attempted, but they are easily detectable as artifice,
and although the audience may admire their cleverness and their ingenuity as artifice, they only get
at the intellect of the house, they don't get at its heart; and so the reader's success lacks a good
deal of being complete.</p>

<p>When a man is reading from a book on the platform, he soon realizes that there is one powerful
gun in his battery of artifice that he can't work with an effect proportionate to its caliber: that is
the <i>pause</i> -- that impressive silence, that eloquent silence, that geometrically progressive
silence which often achieves a desired effect where no combination of words howsoever felicitous
could accomplish it.  The pause is not of much use to the man who is reading from a book
because he cannot know what the exact length of it ought to be; he is not the one to determine the
measurement -- the audience must do that for him.  He must perceive by their faces when the
pause has reached the proper length, but his eyes are not on the faces, they are on the book;
therefore he must determine the proper length of the pause by guess; he cannot guess with
exactness and nothing but exactness, absolute exactness, will answer.</p>

<p>The man who recites without the book has all the advantage; when he comes to an old familiar
remark in his tale which he has uttered nightly for a hundred nights -- a remark preceded or
followed by a pause -- the faces of the audience tell him when to end the pause.  For one audience
the pause will be short, for another a little longer, for another a shade longer still; the performer
must vary the length of the pause to suit the shades of difference between audiences.  These
variations of measurement are so slight, so delicate, that they may almost be compared with the
shadings achieved by Pratt and Whitney's ingenious machine which measures the five-millionth
part of an inch. An audience is that machine's twin; it can measure a pause down to that vanishing
fraction.</p>

<p>I used to play with the pause as other children play with a toy.  In my recitals, when I went
reading around the world for the benefit of Mr. Webster's creditors, I had three or four pieces in
which the pauses performed an important part, and I used to lengthen them or shorten them
according to the requirements of the case, and I got much pleasure out of the pause when it was
accurately measured, and a certain discomfort when it wasn't.  In the negro ghost story of "The
Golden Arm" one of these pauses occurs just in front of the closing remark.  Whenever I got the
pause the right length, the remark that followed it was sure of a satisfactorily startling effect, but
if the length of the pause was wrong by the five-millionth of an inch, the audience had had time in
that infinitesimal fraction of a moment to wake up from its deep concentration in the grisly tale
and foresee the climax, and be prepared for it before it burst upon them -- and so it fell flat.</p></td></tr></table>
