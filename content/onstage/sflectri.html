<font size="+1">From Chapter 78, <b><i>Roughing It</i></b>:</font><br /><br />

<p>I was home again, in San Francisco, without means and without employment. I tortured my brain
for a saving scheme of some kind, and at last a public lecture occurred to me! I sat down and wrote
one, in a fever of hopeful anticipation. I showed it to several friends, but they all shook their heads.
They said nobody would come to hear me, and I would make a humiliating failure of it. They said that
as I had never spoken in public, I would break down in the delivery, anyhow. I was disconsolate now.
But at last an editor slapped me on the back and told me to "go ahead." He said, "Take the largest
house in town, and charge a dollar a ticket." The audacity of the proposition was charming; it seemed
fraught with practical worldly wisdom, however. The proprietor of the several theatres endorsed the
advice, and said I might have his handsome new opera-house at half price--fifty dollars. In sheer
desperation I took it--on credit, for sufficient reasons. In three days I did a hundred and fifty dollars'
worth of printing and advertising, and was the most distressed and frightened creature on the Pacific
coast. I could not sleep--who could, under such circumstances? For other people there was
facetiousness in the last line of my posters, but to me it was plaintive with a pang when I wrote
it:</p>

<center>Doors open at 7 1/2. The trouble will begin at 8.</center><br />

<p>That line has done good service since. Showmen have borrowed it frequently. I have even seen
it appended to a newspaper advertisement reminding school pupils in vacation what time next term
would begin. As those three days of suspense dragged by, I grew more and more unhappy. I had sold
two hundred tickets among my personal friends, but I feared they might not come. My lecture, which
had seemed "humorous" to me, at first, grew steadily more and more dreary, till not a vestige of fun
seemed left, and I grieved that I could not bring a coffin on the stage and turn the thing into a funeral.
I was so panic-stricken, at last, that I went to three old friends, giants in stature, cordial by nature,
and stormy-voiced, and said:</p>

<p>"This thing is going to be a failure; the jokes in it are so dim that nobody will ever see them; I
would like to have you sit in the parquette, and help me through."</p>

<p>They said they would. Then I went to the wife of a popular citizen, and said that if she was willing
to do me a very great kindness, I would be glad if she and her husband would sit prominently in the
left-hand stage-box, where the whole house could see them. I explained that I should need help, and
would turn toward her and smile, as a signal, when I had been delivered of an obscure joke--"and
then," I added, "don't wait to investigate, but <i>respond</i>!"</p>

<p>She promised. Down the street I met a man I never had seen before. He had been drinking, and
was beaming with smiles and good nature. He said:</p>

<p>"My name's Sawyer. You don't know me, but that don't matter. I haven't got a cent, but if you
knew how bad I wanted to laugh, you'd give me a ticket. Come, now, what do you say?"</p>

<p>"Is your laugh hung on a hair-trigger?--that is, is it critical, or can you get it off
<i>easy?</i>"</p>

<p>My drawling infirmity of speech so affected him that he laughed a specimen or two that struck
me as being about the article I wanted, and I gave him a ticket, and appointed him to sit in the second
circle, in the centre, and be responsible for that division of the house. I gave him minute instructions
about how to detect indistinct jokes, and then went away, and left him chuckling placidly over the
novelty of the idea.</p>

<p>I ate nothing on the last of the three eventful days--I only suffered. I had advertised that on this
third day the box-office would be opened for the sale of reserved seats. I crept down to the theatre
at four in the afternoon to see if any sales had been made. The ticket seller was gone, the box-office
was locked up. I had to swallow suddenly, or my heart would have got out. "No sales," I said to
myself; "I might have known it." I thought of suicide, pretended illness, flight. I thought of these
things in earnest, for I was very miserable and scared. But of course I had to drive them away, and
prepare to meet my fate. I could not wait for half past seven--I wanted to face the horror, and end
it--the feeling of many a man doomed to hang, no doubt. I went down back streets at six o'clock, and
entered the theatre by the back door. I stumbled my way in the dark among the ranks of canvas
scenery, and stood on the stage.</p>

<p>The house was gloomy and silent, and its emptiness depressing. I went into the dark among the
scenes again, and for an hour and a half gave myself up to the horrors, wholly unconscious of every
thing else. Then I heard a murmur; it rose higher and higher, and ended in a crash, mingled with
cheers. It made my hair rise, it was so close to me, and so loud. There was a pause, and then another;
presently came a third, and before I well knew what I was about, I was in the middle of the stage,
staring at a sea of faces, bewildered by the fierce glare of the lights, and quaking in every limb with
a terror that seemed like to take my life away. The house was full, aisles and all!</p>

<p>The tumult in my heart and brain and legs continued a full minute before I could gain any
command over myself. Then I recognized the charity and the friendliness in the faces before me, and
little by little my fright melted away, and I began to talk. Within three or four minutes I was
comfortable, and even content. My three chief allies, with three auxiliaries, were on hand, in the
parquette, all sitting together, all armed with bludgeons, and all ready to make an onslaught upon the
feeblest joke that might show its head. And whenever a joke did fall, their bludgeons came down and
their faces seemed to split from ear to ear;  Sawyer, whose hearty countenance was seen looming
redly in the centre of the second circle, took it up, and the house was carried handsomely. Inferior
jokes never fared so royally before. Presently I delivered a bit of serious matter with impressive
unction (it was my pet), and the audience listened with an absorbed hush that gratified me more than
any applause; and as I dropped the last word of the clause, I happened to turn and catch Mrs. -------'s
intent and waiting eye; my conversation with her flashed upon me, and in spite of all I could do I
smiled. She took it for the signal, and promptly delivered a mellow laugh that touched off the whole
audience; and the explosion that followed was the triumph of the evening. I thought that that honest
man Sawyer would choke himself; and as for the bludgeons, they performed like pile-drivers. But my
poor little morsel of pathos was ruined. It was taken in good faith as an intentional joke, and the prize
one of the entertainment, and I wisely let it go at that.</p>

<p>All the papers were kind in the morning; my appetite returned; I had abundance of money. All's
well that ends well.</p>

<blockquote>[<i>In an autobiographical dictation given in Florence in April, 1904, MT recalled that night in
San Francisco in 1866 this way:</i>]</blockquote>

<font size="+1">From <b><i>The Autobiography of Mark Twain</i></b>, ed. A.B. Paine:</font><br /><br />

<p>After about four or five months [in Hawaii] I returned to California to find myself about the best-known honest man on the Pacific coast.  Thomas McGuire, proprietor of several theaters, said that
now was the time to make my fortune--strike while the iron was hot--break into the lecture field!  I
did it.  I announced a lecture on the Sandwich Islands, closing the advertisement with the remark:
"Admission one dollar; doors open at half past seven, the trouble begins at eight."  A true prophecy.
The trouble certainly did begin at eight, when I found myself in front of the only audience I had ever
faced, for the fright which pervaded me from head to foot was paralyzing.  It lasted two minutes and
was as bitter as death; the memory of it is indestructible but it had its compensations, for it made me
immune to timidity before audiences for all time to come.</p>
