<font size="+1"><a name="a">San Francisco</a> <i>Evening-Bulletin</i>, 3 October
1866:</font><br /><br />

<p>The Academy of Music was "stuffed," to use an expression of the lecturer, to repletion last night, on the occasion of the delivery of "Mark Twain's" (Samuel Clemens) lecture on the Sandwich Islands. It is perhaps fortunate that the King of
Hawaii did not arrive in time to attend, for unless he had gone early he would have been turned
away, as many others were who could not gain admittance.</p>

<p>The appearance of the lecturer was the signal for applause and from the time he commenced until
he closed, the greatest good feeling existed.  He commenced by apologizing for the absence of an
orchestra, he wasn't used to getting up operas of this sort.  He had engaged a musician to come
and play the trombone, but, after the bargain was closed, the trombone player insisted upon
having some other musicians to help him.  He had hired the man to work, and wouldn't stand any
such nonsense, and so discharged him on the spot.  </p>
<p>The lecturer then proceeded with his subject,
and delivered one of the most interesting and amusing lectures ever delivered in this city.  It was
replete with information of that character which is seldom got from books, describing all those
minor traits of character, custom and habits which are only noted by a close observer, and yet the
kind of information which gives the most correct idea of the people described.  Their virtues were
set forth generously, while their vices were touched off in a humourous style, which kept the
audience in a constant state of merriment.  From the lecturer's reputation as a humorist, the
audience were unprepared for the eloquent description of the volcano of Kilauea, a really
magnificent piece of word-painting, their appreciation of which was shown by long and continued
applause.  Important facts concerning the resources of the Islands were given, interspersed with
pointed anecdotes and side-splitting jokes.  Their history, traditions, religions, politics,
aristocracy, royalty, manners and customs were all described in brief and in the humorous vein
peculiar to the speaker. It would be impossible to do justice to the lecture in a synopsis, and as it will probably be repeated, we shall not attemt it. The lecturer kept his audience constantly interested and amused for an
hour and a half, and the lecture was unanimously pronounced a brilliant success.  After its close,
and the audience had risen to leave he was called out again, and in his funny style apologized for
the "infliction," giving as an excuse that he was about writing a book on the Sandwich Islands,
and needed funds for its publication.</p>

<p>The lecture was superior to Artemus Ward's "Babes in the Woods" in point of humor.  It evinced
none of that straining after effect that was manifested by the great showman, and possessed some
solid qualities to which Ward can make no pretensions.  As a humorous writer Mark Twain stands
in the foremost rank, while his effort of last evening affords reason for the belief that he can
establish an equal reputation as a humorous and original lecturer.</p><br />

<font size="+1">San Francisco <i>Alta California</i>, 3 October 1866:</font><br /><br />

<p>At times he would soar to the sublime and his description of the volcano of Kilauea was as
graphic and magnificent a piece of word painting as we have listened to for many a day.  As an
entirety, the lecture was preeminently humorous.  There was, however, much information
conveyed in this effort which never appeared in any history of the Hawaiian Islands. . . . Mark
Twain has thoroughly established himself as the most piquant and humorous writer and lecturer
on this coast since the days of the lamented "John Phoenix."</p><br />

<font size="+1">San Francisco <i>News Letter</i>, 6 October 1866:</font><br /><br />

<p>A rousing audience last Tuesday greeted St. Mark, the missionary, on the occasion of his first
appearance on the lyceum stage--we were on the point of saying "on any stage," but having once
travelled with him inside of Billy Wilson's from Virginia to Carson, candor compels us to sacrifice
effect to accuracy.  The Academy was packed from pit to dome, standing room crowded, while a
number were unable to obtain admission.  The audience embraced "our best people."</p>

<p>We had hoped to secure the lecturer's sermon to prepare our little notice of the occasion, but even
his fine sense of humor is surpassed by his acute moral perception, and he declined on the score of
unbecomingness to the missionary character--it would savor of the vanity of the flesh!  Perhaps
nothing in his career gives so vivid an impression of his uncompromising devotion to the principle
as the refusal of our munificent proposition for a sonorous blast upon his own trumpet.  Justice to
ourselves compels us to mention our princely offer, that he should name his own terms.  In justice
to him we give his noble reply, "I believe it would be wrong, untold gold shall not tempt me."
This grand utterance will be handed down to generations yet unborn, stimulating them to virtue,
nerving them to resist the seduction of vice.  The future school-boy shall learn to associate
together these two sublime sentiments--one by the youthful Washington, "Father I cannot tell a
lie!" the other by St. Mark, the missionary, "I believe it is wrong; gold cannot tempt me! . . . Pax
tuiscum, sancto Marcus, missionarius."</p>

<p>We regret to notice one serious fault--it was too short.  It was exceedingly good what there was
of it.  In fact it could not well have been better, but its delivery occupied only an hour and fifteen
minuters, while it appeared to the audience fifteen minutes without the hour. . . . If the missionary
would appropriate half a column of any one of the recent <i>Alta</i>'s editorials upon the
Hawaiian question, and judiciously interpolate it about the middle of his lecture it would rest the
attention of the audience, and, while really not occupying five minutes in delivery, would
effectively remove the impression of brevity.  But really the lecture was "tip top," . . . interesting,
instructive, . . . delivery happy, success complete.</p><br />

<font size="+1">San Francisco <i>Golden Era</i>, 7 October 1866:</font><br /><br />

<p><font size="-1">MARK TWAIN</font>--We regard this subject with mingled admiration and awe,
and approach him with hesitation.  Nature must have been in one of her funniest moods when she
fashioned this mixture of the sublime and the ridiculous.  The house was crowded when the
festive juvenile sauntered bashfully, hand in pocket and mouth too full for utterance, to the
position which he will grace till time interposes his restraining protest across the path of the
successful humorist.  Never did aspirant for public favor take more rapid stride than did the future
historian of the Sandwich Islands on that momentous evening.  Quote Artemus Ward no more;
our Pacific slopes can discount him.  True, he displayed not the polish of the finished lecturer--nor
did he need it; the crude, quaint delivery was infinitely preferable.  In original humor and the way
of putting it, Artemus can hide his diminished Luminary under several bushels; he is as a penn'orth
of tallow to a mammoth circus chandelier.  It was a clever interruption of Twain's--that of
apology.  He wished to write a history of Kanakadom and needed the wherewithal.  He did not
state, however, the number of volumes required.  Several, we hope, and a lecture to a
volume.</p>

  <p><font size="+1"><a name="b">Sacramento</a> <i>Daily Union</i>, 12 October 1866:</font></p>

<p>The lecturer entertained the audience for about an hour, discoursing in an easy colloquial style, . .
. seasoning a large dish of information with spicy anecdotes, depicting the lights and shades of
Kanaka society with a freedom, vividness and humor quite delightful, rendering a just tribute to
the laborious missionaries, . . . and sketching the magnificent scenery of the volcanic mountains
with peculiar force.</p><br />


<font size="+1">Sacramento <i>Bee</i>, 12 October 1866:</font><br /><br />

<p>Mark--His Mission--Mark--not the apostle, but other of the twain, the missionary--made his
advent . . . last evening. . . . Mark has been on a mission to the Sandwich Islands, and returning
has rendered an account of his stewardship. . . . Mark was in good trim.  Instead of having been
made a meal of by the cannibals, . . . he came back to us in the flesh. . . . It was pleasant to listen
to a lecturer who felt so well and talked so wisely, mixing (so to speak) as with a blender the
pathetic with the humorous.  There was more, however, of the humorous than the pathetic, and
the transitions were so sudden that before a tear had time to gather head enough to fall, the
laughing came in.  Occasionally it was just the other way--the tears came from the overflow of
laughter.</p>

30 October 1866 [the day before the lecture]:<br /><br />

<p>The enthusiasm with which his lecture was everywhere greeted is still ringing throughout
California, and now that his foot is in his native heath we expect to see the very mountains shake
with a tempest of approval.</p>

<p>1 November 1866 [the day after the lecture]:</p>

<p>An immense success.  One of the largest and most fashionable audiences that ever graced the
Opera House, . . . all of the available seats and standing room were occupied.  It was a
magnificent tribute to the lecturer from his old friends. . . . Combining the most valuable and
statistical and general information with passages of drollest humor--all delivered in the peculiar
and inimitable style of the author--and rising occasionally to lofty flights of descriptive eloquence--the lecture constitutes an entertainment of rare excellence and interest.</p>

1866:</font><br /><br />

<p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN'S</font> L<font size="-1">ECTURE</font>.--The second lecture of "Mark Twain" upon the Sandwich Islands attracted a large audience to Platt's Hall last evening, and was warmly applauded.  It was not equal to his first effort, having less coherence and finish, and being marred in its artistic effect by several irrelevancies pardonable only to a popular humorist talking among his neighbors.  But it had some of Mark's best traits--audacious humor, sometimes verging on coarseness, alternating with sound practical suggestions and fine description.  The passage concerning the sugar plantations, and the wonderful increase of the sugar product in the last four years, was full of interest, and the facts stated compelled belief in the prediction that under American sway the Sandwich Islands will ultimately supply one-third of the sugar consumed by the whole world.  An average yield is 4,000 to 6,000 pounds per acre; whereas in Louisiana 2,000 pounds per acre is phenomenal.</p>

<p>Mark believes it is the destiny of the Americans, who have civilized and Christianized the Islands, to ultimately own them.  The native population has diminished in a few years from 200,000 to 50,000, and there are now three deaths among it to one birth; while the American population is vigorous and increasing.  The lecturer gave a sharply satirical account of the unsuccessful attempt of Bishop Staley to establish a State Church in the Islands, and through its instrumentality to supplant the American Missionary influence in the interest of British dominion.  He advised the Bishop to go back to England and labor for the improvement of the degraded and unfortunate among his own people, among whom, he asserted, there is more ignorance, want and vice than among the Kanakas.  The lecturer extolled the climate of the Islands, which he described as varying according to the altitude, but being constant within certain belts of elevation, and he raised an immense shout of laughter by saying that at one point the weather has been so hot that even greenbacks rose to 126 in the shade.  His account of the acclimatizing "boohoo fever," was amusing and satirical, and he was almost savagely funny at the expense of the growling invalids who invade the islands from all parts of the world.</p>

<p>His lecture concluded with a laughable account of his "robbery" on the Divide between Gold Hill and Virginia.  He thought the robbers were not "on the divide" at all, but hoggishly took everything themselves.  One lady in the audience was overheard to account to her companion for Mark's confessed fright on the occasion of his adventure with the "road agents" by saying that she supposed he had never been robbed before.  After dismissing his audience, Mark recalled them to hear the single original joke perpetrated in the Sandwich Islands, which was in the nature of a conundrum.  He was asked what injunction of scripture should be repeated to him if he were urged to walk a mile with a friend, and was told: "If thy friend ask thee to go one mile, go Twain."  And with this joke the audience departed laughing.  "Mark Twain" departs for the East on Monday to attend to the publication of a book on the Sandwich Islands, and probably to try lecturing in a wider field.  He will have the good wishes of a host of friends and admirers in California and Nevada, and if considerate enough for the social and aesthetic differences between this side of the continent and the other the author will achieve a gratifying success.</p>

<font size="+1"><a name="d">San Jose</a> <i>Mercury</i>, 26 November 1866:</font><br /><br />

<p>We have been an admirer of the inimitable humor of the lecturer, as shown in his numerous letters
and sketches, that have been so widely published, but confess that the lecture disappointed us.
We expected to hear the Kanakas "Joked blind," but had no idea of being treated to such an
intellectual feast as he served up to his audience.  We never heard or read anything half so
beautiful as his description when he laid aside the role of the humorist and gave rein to his fancy.
To use the expression of a rapt listener to the lecture, "He's lightenin'."</p>

<p><b>Oakland Items.</b>--Mark Twain delivered his lecture as announced, last evening, at the College Hall.  There were not as many present as was expected, in consequence of some misunderstanding about the time and place of the lecture, definite notice of the fact having only been made late in the day.  As it was, about 200 ladies and gentlemen were present, whom Mark kept in good humor for an hour and a half.  The only remarkable feature about the matter was the sudden illness produced by the appearance of Mark's hand-bills on the members of the City Council--they were to meet last evening--and their equally sudden convalescence about 8 o'clock P.M.  Nearly the whole Council were to be seen at the lecture, apparently in the enjoyment of their usual good health.</p>

<p>Reprehensible--The gentleman who enjoys a wide celebrity on this coast as a spicy writer, over
the "<i>nom de plume</i>" of "Mark Twain" delivered his lecture on the "Sandwich Islands," in
this city on Monday evening last.  While we accord to him the merit of being a spicy writer,
candor compels us to say that as a lecturer he is not a success.  We say this with no desire to be
captious, but simply because it is literally true.  As a newspaper correspondent Mark Twain is a
racy and humorous writer, but as a lecturer he falls below mediocrity.  In this connection we think
it is not inapproriate to address ourself to the editorial fraternity on this Coast, and to our San
Francisco contemporaries in particular, in relation to the reprehensible practice of disguising the
truth in reference to the qualifications and ability of persons who sell their talents for a valuable
consideration, and too frequently "sell" those who go to hear them, innocently expecting to be
instructed or amused.</p>

<p>The genial lecturer entertained his audience with a mingling of fact, fun, and fancy, which was as
delightful as it was instructive.  Probably never before was so much actual information imparted in
such an agreeable manner as in Mark's lecture, which might be called the sugar-coated pill of
traveler's lore.  This popular lecturer has struck a new lead in the vast field of literary research,
and his multitudinous friends will all hope that his "prospects" will "pan out" rich.</p><br />

<p><font size="+1">San Francisco <i>Alta California</i>, 11 December 1866:</font></p>

<p>A highly intelligent and appreciative audience . . . assembled last night . . . to hear the last public
lecture of Mark Twain, prior to his departure for "missionary labor" in other climes.  The subject
of the lecture and the droll humor of the lecturer have been so frequently commented on that
further mention on those heads is, at present, needless.  In every respect, whether in regard to the
subject matter of the lecture, manner of delivery, and amendment of some blemishes apparent on
the first occasion, the lecture was a decided success.</p><br />

<p><font size="+1">San Francisco <i>Evening-Bulletin</i>, 11 December
1866:</font></p>

<p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN'S</font> L<font size="-1">ECTURE</font>.--The farewell lecture by Mark Twain last evening at Congress Hall, drew together a large audience and was a success every way.  There were facts and fancies, fun and argument, and altogether the literary entertainment was one of the best of the season.  The lecturer departs with a brilliant reputation in the line of his profession, which he has the ability to increase in the Atlantic States.  Men of this sort of ability never overstock the market, and Mark will find room for an honorable career in the field to which he is going.</p>
