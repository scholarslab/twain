<p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN'S</font> L<font size="-1">ECTURE ON
THE</font> S<font size="-1">ANDWICH</font> I<font size="-1">SLANDS</font>. -- In
accordance with his humorous advertisement, Mark Twain delivered his wonderful lecture, on the
Sandwich Islands, at the Mercantile Library Hall last night.  The audience was large and
appreciative, and financially and every other way the entertainment proved a complete success.  In
fact, Mark Twain achieved a very decided success.  He succeeded in doing what we have seen
Emerson and other literary magnates fail in attempting.  He interested and amused a large and
promiscuous audience.</p>

<p>Mark has the gift of a bright and happy fancy, and expresses his thoughts with no ordinary
force and gracefulness of language.  His descriptive powers are good, and his descriptive powers
very fair for a young lecturer.</p>

<p>We shall attempt no synopsis of his entertainment.  Ostensibly it was on the Sandwich Islands,
but while it contained not a little valuable information and many passages of felicitious
description, it also embraced many other topics geographically and otherwise foreign to the
matter in hand, and had many a piquant piece of humor interwoven, which, with the bright flash of
genuine wit, startled with laughter and kept alive the attention of the audience.  As to the
wonderful [feats?] promised in the advertisement they were forgotten in the intellectual
amusement afforded; and in the minor matter of swallowing a child Mark failed to come to time,
possibly because no lady volunteered an infant for the occasion.  We did not learn who was lucky
enough to win Lafayette Park.</p>

<p>Our readers are aware this lecture was delivered for the benefit of the South St. Louis
Mission Sunday School -- a most worthy object and certainly calling for the patronage of the
Christian community.</p>

<p>This evening the lecture will be repeated at the same place and for the same object.  Let all go
who wish to be instructed and amused, and at the same time assist a deserving cause.  "The
wisdom will begin to flow at eight o'clock, and not a drop should be lost."</p>
