<font size="+1">[From the San Francisco <i>Daily Morning Call</i>, 30 September 1866:]</font><br /><br />

<p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN'S</font> L<font size="-1">ECTURE</font>.--The various city papers have been busy congratulating their readers during the past week, that this keen observer and facile writer has consented to gratify the public with a <i>viva voce</i> description of the life and manners of the Hawaiian Islanders, among whom he has spent several months as correspondent for the Sacramento <i>Union</i>.  The Academy of Music has been engaged for this purpose, and (to use the language of his own advertisement) "the trouble" will commence at eight o'clock on Tuesday evening next.  We have no doubt the house will be crowded.  A great many desire to hear and see how "Mark" acquits himself before an audience, and whether the shrewd sense, fancifully attired in humorous garb, which drops so readily from his pen-point, will flow so with equal ease and as pithily from his tongue.  We may rest assured the lecture will be a good one, and worth the time and money asked, even if "the splendid orchestra, the den of wild beasts, the fireworks, and torch-light procession," should fail to come to time.</p>
