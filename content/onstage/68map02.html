<p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN</font> L<font size="-1">AST</font> N<font size="-1">IGHT</font>.--Mark's lecture on "Venice" at the Mercantile Library Hall last night was greeted by a full house, composed of the aristocratic and <i>elite</i> of the city, who were quite liberal in their applause of the many good and "telling" points.
