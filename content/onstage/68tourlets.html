[<b><a name="b">Virginia City</a>, May 1, 1868. <br />
To Mary Fairbanks.</b>]<br />
<br />
[From <i>Mark Twain's Letters</i> 2: 212]<br /><br />
My Dear Mother--<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; . . . I lectured here--a little over sixteen hundred dollars in the house--gold &amp; silver.  The seats were all taken &amp; paid for long before night, &amp; then I stopped the sale of tickets, which made a large number of people mad--people who came at 7 P.M. &amp; had to go away again.  But <i>I</i> couldn't help that.  I didn't want them standing up &amp; bothering me.  It was a miserably poor lecture.  I shall write a better one the next time I come to San Francisco.<br />

[<b><a name="a">San Francisco</a>, July 5 1868. <br />
To Mary Fairbanks.</b>]<br />
<br />
[From <i>Mark Twain's Letters</i> 2: 234]<br /><br />
Dear Mother--<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; I lectured on Venice night before last--large audience &amp; fashionable--&amp; gave so much satisfaction that I feel some inches taller, now.  Mind, I do not forget that I am right among personal friends, here, &amp; that a lecture which they would pronounce very fine, would be entirely likely to prove a shameful failure before an unbiased audience such as I would find in an eastern city or on board the Quaker City.  I only claim that these citizens <i>here</i> call this a good lecture--I do <i>not</i> claim, <i>myself</i>, that it is.  I am satisfied it would be pretty roughly criticised in an eastern town.<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; But one thing I know--there is no slang, &amp; no inelegancies in it--&amp; I never swore once, never once was guilty of profanity.<br />
