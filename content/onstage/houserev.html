<center><h3>Mark Twain as a Lecturer</h3></center>


<p>About a year and a half ago, a communication entitled "Joe Smiley and his jumping Frog," with
the hitherto unknown signature of "Mark Twain," appeared in <i>The Saturday Press</i> of this
city. The name, though new, was not remarkable, but the style of the letter was so singularly
fresh, original, and full of character as to attract prompt and universal attention among the
readers of light humorous literature. Mark Twain was immediately entered as a candidate for
high position among writers of his class, and passages from his first contribution to the
metropolitan press became proverbs in the mouths of his admirers. No reputation was ever more
rapidly won. The only doubt appeared to be whether he could satisfactorily sustain it. Subsequent
productions, however -- most of them reproduced from California periodicals -- confirmed the
good opinion so suddenly vouchsafed him, and abundantly vindicated the applause with which
his first essay had been received. In his case, as in that of many other American humorous
writers, it was only the first step that cost. Since that time he has walked easily -- let us hope not
too easily -- over his special course.</p><p>

His writings being comparatively new to the public, and his position having been so recently
established, it might perhaps, have been doubted whether his name would at present be sufficient
to attract an audience of any magnitude to witness his debut as a lecturer. But the proof of the
general good-will in which he is already held was manifested last Monday evening by his
brilliant reception at the Cooper Institute. The hall was crowded beyond all expectation. Not a
seat was vacant, and all the aisles were filled with attentive listeners. The chance offering of "The
Jumping Frog," carelessly cast, eighteen months ago, upon the Atlantic waters, returned to him in
the most agreeable form which a young aspirant for popular fame could desire. The wind that
was sowed with probably very little calculation as to its effect upon its future prospects, now
enables him to reap quite a respectable tempest of encouragement and cordiality. His greeting
was such as to inspire the utmost ease and confidence, and it is pleasant to add that his
performance in every way justified the favor bestowed upon him. No other lecturer, of course
excepting Artemus Ward, has so thoroughly succeeded in exciting the mirthful curiosity, and
compelling the laughter of his hearers.</p><p>

The subject of his address, "The Sandwich Islands," was treated mainly from a comic
stand-point, although scraps of practical information and occasional picturesque descriptions of
scenery and natural phenomena peculiar to that region were liberally interspersed. The scheme of
the lecturer appeared to be to employ the various facts he had gathered as bases upon which to
build fanciful illustrations of character, which were furthermore embellished with a multitude of
fantastic anecdotes and personal reminiscences. The frequent incongruities of the narration
evidently intentional   made it all the more diverting, and the artifice of its partial incoherence
was so cleverly contrived as to intensify the amusement of the audience, while leaving them for
the most part in ignorance of the means employed. As to the manner of the speaker, it is difficult
to write explicitly. It was certainly peculiar and original. Perhaps no better idea of it could be
conveyed than by saying it is in almost every respect the exact opposite to that of the late
Artemus Ward. It suited that admirable lecturer's humor to exhibit a nervous quickness and a
vivacity which always communicated itself to those who surrounded him, and his best "points"
were made by the droll affection of complete unconsciousness with which he uttered the most
telling jests. Mark Twain's delivery, on the other hand, is deliberate and measured to the last
degree. He lounges comfortably around his platform, seldom referring to notes, and seeks to
establish a sort of button-hole relationship with his audience at the earliest possible moment. He
is even willing to exchange confidences of the most literal nature. Having made an accidental
error in figures, last Monday evening, at which there was great laughter, he paused and requested
to be informed "what he had said," and was indisposed to proceed until his curiosity should be
gratified. Instead of manifesting indifference to his own good jokes, he appears to relish them as
heartily as anybody -- a characteristic, by the bye, which also belongs to the most eminent
"reader" now known to the British public. The only obvious preconcerted "effect" which he
employs is a momentary hesitation or break in his narration before touching the climax of an
anecdote or a witticism. But his style is his own, and needs to be seen to be understood. A second
opportunity for this, we learn, is presently to be afforded, to which, when it approaches, we shall
invite particular attention.</p>
