<center><h3>SCENE 1</h3></center>

<blockquote><u>Marley's Hill. (in 1)  A woodland landscape.  Enter Judge Tempest and Miss Tempest.--Miss T. excitedly--Judge following.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Yes, I repeat it, it was all your fault.  If you had stayed with us, instead of leaving us unprotected, to be picked up by any passing stranger, this wouldn't have happened.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>expostulating</u>)  But if you will tell me what possible connection there is between my leaving you alone, and Mr. York being arrested for murder?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>hurriedly</u>)  There, don't talk--you're always talking instead of acting!  Oh, if I were only a man.  I'd--there--there, father, forgive me, (<u>embracing him</u>)  but you see, dear, your habits as a lawyer--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>interrupting</u>)  True! but my habits as a lawyer have not blunted my perception as a father--Shirley, my child, hear me!  You <i>love</i> this man! (<u>putting his arm around her.</u>)  There!  I do not blame you.  Indeed, 24 hours ago, I would have rejoiced at this--But my experience of life teaches me that your lover--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
But he isn't my lover--it's Miss Plunkett that he loves--<br /><br />

<pb n="171" />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
Well, the lover of Miss Plunkett <i>alias</i> Miss Tempest, I grieve to say is in a dangerous strait.  The evidence that might be frivolous and insufficient, before a competent court, will be convincing to the rude law of this locality.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
But father, you can--you <i>will</i> save him!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>gravely</u>)  My child,--your vigilance committee knows that it must justify its irregularities by its final verdict.  It has to hang a man to show that it had the right to <i>simply</i> arrest him.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
You terrify me, father.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
Be assured, my poor child, I will do all I can.  I will go to the poor fellow now.  They will admit <i>me</i>--though they deny all others.  Have you any word of comfort to send him?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>impetuously</u>)  To send him?  No--I'll carry it myself.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
Why, my child, it's no place for you. <i>You</i> will not go there!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Will I grieve at home?  Father you know me better.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
Let me persuade you.  Think of that mob of rough men.<br /><br />

<pb n="173" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
I don't care for them, I will go.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
Child, what <i>good</i> can you do there?  Your sex never reason.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
When those we love are in danger?   No--thank Heaven we act first and reason afterwards.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>aside</u>)  Confound it, I'm getting the worst of it. (<u>aloud</u>)   They will not allow women there.  They will not admit you.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
They <i>shall</i> admit me.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
Oh, folly, folly!  But my child, these are wild, rough miners--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
They are <i>men</i>.  And all men have hearts. (<u>X.L.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>perplexed for a moment--then kindly</u>)  Shirley, I do sincerely feel for you; and if you could do the least good, I would yield.  But you cannot.  It is no place for a young girl.  My arguments have all failed--now I must use compulsion.  You cannot go.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>with gentleness but firmly</u>)  Father, try to forgive me, but <i>I</i> <i>will</i> <i>go</i>.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>surprised</u>)  Shirley, it is the first time you ever refused me obedience.  It does not <pb n="175" /> become a girl to--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
All my life, till this day, I was a girl, and a subject.  To-day, I am a woman! (<u>X.R.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
Then nothing can change your mind?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>calmly</u>)  Nothing, father.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
It will grieve me--but you compel me to do it.  I will oppose your entrance myself and I will take you home.  You know me, my child.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>appealingly</u>)  Oh, father, father!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>embracing her</u>)  I must be cruel to be kind.  Time is precious.  I must go to him.  My darling. (<u>kissing her forehead</u>)  You harbor no resentment against your father?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Oh, you know I do not--<i>could</i> not.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
There spoke my child!  And you will obey?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>gently and firmly</u>)  No, this once I will not obey.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>going--aside</u>)  There spoke my own child again!  But I mustn't seem to have heard it. (<u>aloud</u>)  Keep up your heart, my child--wait at home 'till I bring you news. (<u>exits</u>) <br /><br />

<pb n="177" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Oh, there'll be no turning my father from his purpose, and that murderous pack will sacrifice the man whose life is dearer to me now, than my own, and I shall not be near to--But I <i>will</i> be there!  Oh!  What shall I do?  What can I do? (<u>exits R.</u>) <br /><br />

<center><u>Change.</u></center><br />
<br />

<center><h3>SCENE 2</h3></center>

<blockquote><u>County store. Bar C. Door of entrance L.H. Barrels--boxes etc.--Window back.<br />
Scene opens on court.<br />
Two jurymen are playing cards and several others looking on with interest.</u> </blockquote><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Juryman</u><br />
I go 10 cents blind.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>2nd Juryman</u><br />
I see your blind and straddle it.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Gentlemen of the jury, the evidence being all in now, let the prisoner be brought into court and we will proceed to listen to the arguments of counsel.<br />

<blockquote><u>Tremendous row outside--Boston jumps to door--shouts--"Dog fight!" "Dog fight!"</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
(<u>running to door</u>) Dog fight!  Dog fight!  Hands off--fair play--let 'em alone! (<u>to Masters</u>)  Five to one on the yaller pup!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Take it.  This court stands adjourned for 10 minutes. (<u>Jumps down from counter.</u>)<br />

<blockquote>The whole crowd, except Brod., pile out with a yell.--Jurymen snatch up their cards and pocket them as they run out.<br />

<u>Enter Broderick.</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
(<u>aside at bar.</u>)   In a moment the jury will return <pb n="181" /> and I shall know the result.  How I tremble!  Nonsense!  (<u>in nervous distress</u>)  Why don't that Chinaman come!  Every second of time is important now and freighted with fate!  One second too late may work destruction.<br />

<blockquote><u>Enter the whole crowd, excited and puffing--Prisoner comes, too--<i>Those</i> jurymen resume their cards.</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
(<u>to Boston</u>)  You <i>won</i> the bet fair enough, but the <i>fight</i> wasn't fair, on account of the yellow pup taking leg-holts.  I'll pay you the amount to-morrow. (<u>Boston nods, as much as to say "All right."</u>)  The court will now proceed to--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
(<u>L. as foreman of the jury.</u>)  Just a moment, Judge.  There's a little dispute here.  I went 10 cents blind, and Jake Miller saw it with a 20, and then I straddled his blind, and it took him 40 cents to make it good; and by George, now he says it takes me 80 to come in.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
(<u>left</u>)  Oh, that be hanged!  Where'd you get your education, Jake Miller?  The idea of its costing him 80 to come in on his own straddle.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
 (<u>C. gravely</u>)  Mr. Miller, I am surprised that any man in a land where education is as free as the air we breathe, should be so sunk in ignorance.  A man straddles your blind, and you in the broad light of the 19th Century--<pb n="183" />proclaim that it costs him 4 times to come in on his own straddle!  It is a spectacle to make one blush for his species.  Such a man is not fit to sit upon a jury and deal with the mighty matters of life and death.  It is persons like you that have brought the jury system into disrepute, and made the American jury a synonym for ignorance and savage stupidity.  You may retire from the box.  Hank Williamson, take his place. (<u>the change is made.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
That's it!--Now there's sense in that.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
A man that can't play poker is not fit to sit on a jury.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
Of course not.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Gentlemen of the jury, the evidence is all in. (<u>Broderick hands Masters a flask--he drinks and Brod. sends it to jury.</u>)  Thanks.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
(<u>rising R.</u>)  Your honor, I <i>must</i> protest, once more, against these irregularities.  To pass a flask of liquor around--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Sit down, you're out of order.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
Second the motion.  Sit down, it ain't your turn.<br />

<blockquote><u>Enter Ah Sin, who is prodded and pestered by people as he goes along.<pb n="185" />  He protests with head shakes and a few Chinese words--stoops or squats down where somebody will stand on his tail and tip wink to other spectators.--A slight pause while Ah Sin enters.</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
(<u>C.</u>)  Dry up the whole lot o'ye--Mr. Ferguson, if you're ready--go on. (<u>Ferguson rises</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
Now Fergy, toot your horn if you don't sell a clam.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
 (<u>L. corner</u>)  Turn on your gas, Fergy.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
 (<u>L. of table C.</u>)  Your honor--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Hold on just a minute, Mr. Ferguson--Which are you for? Prosecution or 
defence?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
Well, I don't exactly know.  I'm not familiar with law terms.  But, I'm going to put a blast under York, if I can.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston and 1st Miner</u><br />
Bully for you--that's the talk.<br /> 

<blockquote><u>Ah Sin's tail gets fast in something or somebody is unconsciously standing on it.  Tries to straighten up and can't--jabbers frantically in Chinese.</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Stand off the Pagan's tail!  Now you <pb n="187" /> be quiet, or I'll pull your tail out and flog you to death with it.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
Gentlemen of the jury.  You've seen yourselves that there is evidence enough to hang 40 men.  There had been a fight--the ground torn up and the blood spots showed that; who fought that fight?  York's pistol was found there with two charges shot off.  Who generally carries Mr. York's pistol for him?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
Good!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
A handkerchief was found there, too.  A <i>clean</i> one!--Whom does that suggest?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
Good again!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
I ask you to examine it. (<u>it is passed to jury, who examine it with disgust--Brod. whispers to Ferg. and pushes the dilapidated gloves before him.</u>)   And a pair of unknown gloves found not 50 yards from the same place. (<u>exhibits them and passes them to jury</u>)  <i>Kid</i> gloves, you know this swell was always insulting the camp in every way he could think of, particularly by wearing kid gloves.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
That's so every time.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
There's another thing that looks mighty<pb n="189" /> black--He jumps Plunkett's claim, says he bought it.  If he did, where's the papers for it--He says he lost 'em.  Too thin! (<u>sits</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
You bet--It's a blame sight, too thin.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
Your honor, I <i>must</i> protest against these extraordinary expressions of opinion by jurymen.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
 (<u>a trifle severely</u>)  Look here, my friend, who's trying this case if it ain't the jury?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
But these premature expressions of opinion are totally at variance with all custom and precedent.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Never mind--you sit down.  I reckon we've tried this sort of case before often enough to know how to do it.  If this man ain't guilty I never saw a man that was, and if a <i>juryman</i> can't speak his mind, where's your boasted freedom of speech your Declaration of Independence brags about?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
Good! Had him there!<br />

<blockquote><u>Brod. sends box of cigars to Masters and jury.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Go on, Mr. Ferguson.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
5 or 10 words more is all I want to say.  Gentlemen of the jury, look at <pb n="191" />the bare facts a moment.  York was rich; all of a sudden he loses every dollar he's got, and don't know where to turn to make a raise.  He is frantic, crazy, perfectly desperate.  That very day he stumbles on poor old Plunkett at the very moment that Plunkett has struck it rich.  It was a lonesome place, nobody by to see the act--he outs with his revolver, shoots the old man dead.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>rising impetuously</u>)  Come, come, <i>this</i> is not in evidence!  Why, the very <i>fact</i> that nobody saw the act done is proof that nobody knows who <i>did</i> it.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
 (<u>very calm, sarcastic manner</u>)    Look here, who's making this speech, <i>I</i> would like to know? (<u>to jury</u>)   As I was saying, when interrupted by this old blackleg, he shoots the old man dead--jumps the claim and has the effrontery to come calmly before this camp and say he <i>bought</i> the mine; and the heartlessness to come with new kid gloves and a new stove pipe hat on, too--mark that--purchased with the proceeds of his crime. (<u>audience show rising excitement.</u>)  There <i>was</i> a time when the man that dared to flaunt the contemptuous effronteries of kid gloves and a stove pipe hat in the face of this camp, did it at the peril of tar and feathers, a ride upon the rail, and <i>banishment!</i><br />

<pb n="193" />

<blockquote><u>The spectators surge forward, the jury stand up--chorus of shouts.</u><br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Omnes</u><br />
(<u>L</u>)  Hang him! Kill him! Shoot him like a dog! A rope, a rope, fetch a rope!<br />

<blockquote><u>Grand struggle and pow-wow</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
 (<u>springs up to level a huge revolver</u>)  Back, every devil of you!  I'll kill the first man that lays a hand on him! (<u>they fall back muttering and shaking their heads--Masters stands glaring on the crowd a while, then says with strong and pathetic indignation</u>)  <i>Confound</i> it, have I got to kill a man <i>every</i> time I sit on a case of this kind? (<u>sits gravely down.</u>)   Let the defence begin. (<u>Ah Sin in his fright has climbed to the top of the conspicuous pile of boxes, starts to come carefully down and tumbles with a crash.--startled.</u>)   What the nation did you get up there for!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Me wantee <i>see</i> better.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Well, what did you come clattering down like that for?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Me no got time be all day comin' down.<br />

<blockquote><u>Brod. whispers to Ferg., who springs up.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
Hold on! Just a single word more!  This prisoner has had a couple of women masquerading at this house for a day or two, passing themselves <pb n="195" /> off for Plunkett's widow and daughter.  It has been found out that they are nothing of the kind.  It's a suspicious business.  What do you reckon is York's little game?  Did he want that bogus widow to make him a deed to Plunkett's mine, hey? (<u>sensation</u>)    And who <i>are</i> these imposters?--The wife and daughter of no less a personage than--that gentleman there! (<u>pointing to Tempest</u>)<br />

<blockquote><u>Sensation</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
(<u>to some friend near</u>)  Oh, what a <i>fatal</i> fool I have been!  Now, I would give the <i>world</i> if my daughter were here to throttle this calumny! (<u>Miss T. enters through door in R. flat impetuously through the crowd--hat in hand, shawl half off--very pale.</u>)  Shirley, my child! (<u>she runs to him.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
What means this?  What is your name?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Shirley Tempest.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Mellican lady goin' to heap lie some more!  No can keep same name two day.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Were you known by that name in the household of Mr. York?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
No.<br /><br />

<pb n="197" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
By what name then?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Miss Plunkett.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
What object had you in assuming that name?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>hesitatingly</u>)  Only--a--foolish girl's fancy.  My father had brought us to meet Mr. York--his old friend.  The letter informing him of our arrival did not reach him.  But Mr. York, seeking Miss Plunkett, who was due the same day, mistook me for that lady--I--I--did not undeceive him.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>rising</u>) May it please this court.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Sit down, sir. (<u>York sits down protesting</u>)  -- (<u>to Miss T.</u>)  But what was your object, if you were the legitimate guest of Mr. York, in deceiving him in this way?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>greatly agitated</u>)  Oh, sir, I assure you, it was only a mere fancy--a foolish, girlish freak (<u>sobbing</u>)  He thought my photograph was Miss Plunkett's.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
Oh, let up!  Oh, give her a show!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Givee her showee!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
(<u>gravely</u>)  Miss Tempest, consider one moment; upon your next utterance may <pb n="199" />
hang the life of the prisoner.  If you are really here in the interests of justice--if you have come here, honestly, to clear his character, and your own, you will answer as honestly and frankly one question.  What other motive had you in personating the woman in whom you knew he was interested?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>looking wildly round the court.</u>)  Because, because--because--I was-- (<u>meeting York's eye</u>)  Oh, spare me, sir, spare <i>him</i>.  I implore you.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
(<u>gravely</u>)  Answer.  Remember, his life may hang upon your next sentence.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Because--I--<i>loved</i> him! (<u>drops her head in her hands.</u>)<br />

<blockquote><u>Sensation. Applause from jury and spectators--Broderick turns away in anger.</u>)</blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
Say that again, Miss, to <i>me</i>, and say it as you said it then, and I'll take <i>his</i> place under the gallows.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
(<u>rising</u>)  Again, I must protest against these constant intermeddlings of the jury in--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
Sit down, you old ass--that girl of yours has said more in one minute than you have in 60.<br />

<blockquote><u>Ah Sin, who is standing with back against wall, slaps thigh 
<pb n="201" /> 
and is in the midst of a prodigious laugh when he observes that there is a stillness and all eyes are on him--slowly closes his wide mouth in shame.</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Silence in the court!<br />
<blockquote><u>Silence, in which Judge T. embraces Miss T. and she whispers to him.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>rising</u>)  May it please the court, may I have the privilege of examining this witness?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Omnes</u><br />
Go on.  Heave ahead, old man!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Go on.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
Swear the witness!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
Swear a <i>lady</i>!  Doubt a lady's word.  Nonsense, go on! go on!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Omnes</u><br />
Yes, go on--go on.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>stupefied and shrugging his shoulders</u>)  Well, I protest--but--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
This is all very fine--very pretty--a put up job between the father and daughter to humbug the jury!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
Oh, take a walk. (<u>Broderick sits down.</u>) <br /><br />

<pb n="203" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Takee walkee top side hillee.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>to Miss T.</u>)  By whose suggestion did you come here?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Nobody's but my own.  You refused me permission to come.  And--and Mr. Broderick said I should not enter this courtroom, and <i>he</i> would see to it that I was prevented.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
 (<u>aside</u>) Fool that I am!  It serves me right.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Omnes</u><br />
Broderick's a dog!  Kick him out!  Lynch him!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
Mr. Broderick must answer to me for his officiousness. (<u>to Miss T.</u>)  How did you come to hold converse with Mr. Broderick?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
I met him on the road, and in my distress I implored him to use his influence to save Mr. York.  And he--he--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
Speak out, Miss--don't you be afraid--What did he do?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
He--he--insulted me with protestations of love!  Said if I would discard Mr. York for <i>him</i>, he would see that York was set free. (<u>breaks down and cries a little.</u>) <br /><br />

<pb n="205" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
You scorned him--of course--then he--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
He said he would make my assumed name tell against the prisoner.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
The whole conduct of the prosecution is of a piece with this.  I will not shame your intelligence, your <i>manhood</i>, your magnanimity by defending a man who is so manifestly guiltless, or by attacking a prosecution which has so ignominiously failed.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Juryman</u><br />
That's me.--shake!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>2d. Juryman</u><br />
And me too.  She hasn't been treated right.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>3rd Juryman</u><br />
Count me in.<br /><br />

<b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Alle same me!</b><br />

<blockquote><u>They all get to shaking hands.  Ah Sin offers to shake with somebody--is spurned contemptuously.  Brod. whispers to Ferg., who springs up.</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
One word, Gentlemen of the jury. Let us <i>acquit</i> him.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Omnes</u><br />
Agreed! Agreed! Hurray!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
Yes, let us acquit him--let us weep on his neck and welcome him back to our firesides--<i>where he is so fond of coming to enjoy our society</i>. So very fond of it.  Let's buy 3 or 4 <pb n="207" />gross of kid gloves, so he can shake hands with us without--without <i>catching</i> anything.  Let's get him a dozen new stove pipe hats to take off respectfully when he meets us.  And let's get him a hundred dollar-forty-horse-power pair of spectacles so he can <i>see</i> us when he <i>does</i> meet us.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Juryman</u><br />
Blamed if I vote not guilty!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Omnes</u><br />
Nor I! Nor I!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
Let's give him back the mine he stole from a poor afflicted widow and a stricken daughter who had never done him any harm!  Let's forget--if any of us <i>noticed</i> it--that when the whiskey was passed to him from the jury a while ago, he turned from it with the native air of a snob, because--well, because he didn't feel worthy to drink <i>after such elegant gentlemen</i>, perhaps.  (<u>he sits down</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Juryman</u><br />
Guilty's the word for <i>me</i>, boys.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>2d. Juryman</u><br />
That's my style! Shake!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>3d. Juryman</u><br />
Goodbye, Mr. <i>York</i>. Shake!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>4th Juryman</u><br />
Guilty for <i>me</i>, and spell it with a big J., too!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>5th Juryman</u><br />
A big G., you flat head.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Spectators</u><br />
Hang him! hang him! hang him!<br />

<blockquote><u>Ah Sin starts for the pile of boxes, but is taken by the ear and led back again by Broderick, who whispers to him and sends him out.</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Silence! The jury can retire.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
'Tain't no use.  The game's made.  This jury's unanimous for guilty. (<u>sensation. Miss T. is about to rush forward to York, when her father restrains her.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>to Masters</u>)  It cannot be that this unparalleled outrage in the name of justice will be allowed to stand.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
You had ample opportunity to prove the innocence of your client.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>indignantly</u>)  It is for you to prove him <i>guilty</i>.  You have failed by every rule of law and evidence. (<u>turning and appealing to spectators, who, meantime showing signs of dissent with the verdict, have gathered round him and his daughter</u>)   Hear me, gentlemen, I conjure <i>you</i> who have called this tribunal into existence, and without whose support it cannot continue to exist not to let this verdict stand which is an insult to this defenceless girl.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>A Juryman</u><br />
Boys, there's something in that.<br /><br />

<pb n="111" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Another</u><br />
Yes, blamed if there ain't.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
You have wives, you have sisters, you have sweethearts--You will not see this verdict recorded against this innocent man. (<u>pointing to York.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>All</u><br />
No, we won't.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
I boldly invite a verdict.<br />

<blockquote><u>Sensation among jury--favorable to prisoner during which Broderick starts up and goes down stage.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
 (<u>aside</u>)   No use holding back any longer.  I must risk the Chinaman's evidence--or these fools will give in. (<u>aloud</u>)   One moment, your honor, I have another witness.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Who is it?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
Ah Sin.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
A Chinaman cannot testify in this court.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
No, but he brings a witness more powerful than himself.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
The mischief he does!  Very well, then, let him come forward.<br />

<blockquote><u>Enter Ah Sin--with bag and umbrella.</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Good day John. Good day evellyboddy--<pb n="213" /> (<u>jabbers alot of Chinese</u>)  --ti kelly kee chow.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
None of your jabbering--get up there.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Top side? (<u>comic business--getting on box</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Yes, topside.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
Now Ah Sin, show the Court what you found in the bushes near Plunkett's claim the night he disappeared.<br />

<blockquote><u>Ah Sin opens bag, fumbles about, jabbering Chinese or singing--slowly takes out jacket and hands it to Brod., who hands it to Masters.</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
There's the witness!--the jacket worn by York on the night of the murder, stained with the blood of his victim.<br />

<blockquote><u>Deed falls from jacket on table as Masters examines jacket. Ferg. reaches for it--Masters plants his foot on it.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Why Broderick, this is not York's jacket but yours, and here's your name on the collar.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
Villain!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
 (<u>glaring at Ah Sin.</u>)   Ah Sin!  It's false.  It's some trick.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
 (<u>pointing pistol at Brod.</u>)  You likee him, eh?<br /><br />

<pb n="215" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
And here's the deed which has just fallen from the pocket of your jacket.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Him belongee me.  I findee him in York jackee.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
 (<u>pointing to Brod.</u>)  Don't let him escape!<br />

<blockquote><u>All gather round Masters examining deed.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
Devil take the Chinaman, he has put the rope around my neck.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
How muchee you give suppose Shellif no hangee you.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
All--everything I've got in the world.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
You givee half rich mine.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
Yes, and you $10,000 to boot.<br />
