FIFTH AVENUE THEATRE.</b></center>

<p>The representation of the play called "Ah Sin" at the Fifth
Avenue Theatre yesterday evening afforded frequent gratification to a very
large audience. The fact that a good many spectators grew perceptibly weary
as the performance approached an end, and the still more significant fact
that the audience left the house without making the slightest demonstration
of pleasure when the curtain fell upon the last scene, may imply that the
piece, as a whole, is scarcely likely to secure a really strong hold upon
the favor of the public. But it is certain that there was much laughter
and applause heard as "Ah Sin" progressed, and the causes of the
merriment and plaudits appeared sufficiently numerous to give some vitality
to the composition of which they are the principal element. It need hardly
be said that Messrs. Bret Harte and Mark Twain's play is by no means a very
dramatic or symmetrical work. Humorists, romance writers, and poets are
never born and seldom become dramatists, and both authors of "Ah Sin"
are now truing their 'prentice hand in seeking fame and fortune through
the medium of the stage. "Ah Sin," however, is not so bad a piece
as might have been anticipated. It has a plot, well-worn and transparent
though it is at once discovered to be, and hence there is a reason for almost
everything said or done during the disentanglement of the narrative. Its
weakness lies in a paucity of striking events, in an almost invariable disregard
of the absolute necessity of providing a strong tableau at the close of
each act, and in a superabundance of dialogue, mainly coarse, and often
inexcusably so, because it has not the excuse of being characteristic. Its
merit is to be sought, firstly, in the somewhat novel personage who bestows
his name upon the drama; secondly, as mentioned above, in its rather unexpected
coherence, and, lastly, in the strange atmosphere into which it transports
the listener. Most of the characters do not indeed differ in any essential
traits from the everyday heroes and heroines of melodrama, but their language,
their attire, and their surroundings breathe an air of freshness over the
picture. M. Dennery might turn them into Frenchmen, Mr. Boucicault into
Irishmen, and Mr. Daly into Massachusetts saints and sinners, but the charm
of local color is of great weight in dealing with Messrs. Harte and Twain's
joint production. And the character of <i>Ah Sin</i> has unquestionably originality
and newness. The typical Chinaman, who acts, too, as a sort of <i>deus ex machina</i>,
presents a variety of phases of Chinese humor, cleverness, and amusing rascality.
His comical <i>naivet&eacute;</i>, his propensity to beg and steal, his far-seeing policy,
thanks to which a happy denouement of this particular story is brought about,
are happily illustrated. Naturally enough <i>Ah Sin</i> finally becomes a little
monotonous; there is, however, so much idle gabble in he drama that his
appearance is usually welcome. Of the serious business intrusted to the other
personages there is, as we have said, more than a sufficiency. We shall,
therefore, not waste much space upon the story of "Ah Sin." It
turns upon the rascality of one <i>Broderick</i>, who all but murders <i>Bill Plunkett</i>--"the champion liar of Calaveras"--and then accuses <i>York</i>, a
"gentleman miner," of the crime. Just as a committee of lynchers
are about to act upon a verdict of guilty, <i>Ah Sin</i> fastens the guilt of the
deed upon <i>Broderick</i> by the exhibition of the murderer's coat, which <i>Broderick</i>
thought he had long since done away with, and <i>Plunkett</i> being subsequently
brought into court safe and sound, the piece terminates happily. If Messrs.
Harte and Twain had handled all their material as deftly as in the first
act, "Ah Sin" would have been a very praiseworthy effort. Although
the longest of the four divisions of the play, the first awakens interest
and closes with an ingenious surprise. The second act, concluding with an
attempt to arrest <i>Ah Sin</i> on a charge of murder, and with the flight of the
"vigilantes," who are routed by <i>Ah Sin</i> expectorating water upon
them as though he were dampening linen in the Chinese fashion, is tedious,
and the third drags sadly. The vicissitudes of a trial before a "border
jury" enliven the fourth act, which would round off the piece very
neatly if something besides a scene of extravagant joy worthy a burlesque
prefaced the fall of the curtain. "Ah Sin" was capitally acted,
last night, and admirably placed upon the stage. Mr. Parsloe's Chinaman
could scarcely be excelled in truthfulness to nature and freedom from caricature.
Mr. P. A. Anderson pictured with marked force and freedom from conventionality
<i>Bill Plunkett</i>. Mr. Davidge, as the "chief of the Vigilantes,"
distinguished himself especially in the trial scene, and the remaining male
roles found suitable interpreters in Messrs. Crisp, Collier, Weaver, Varrey,
and Vining Bowers. Among the softer sex Mrs. Gilbert bore off the honors,
in a new rival of <i>Mrs. Malaprop</i>--<i>Mrs. Plunkett</i> by name. Much of the language
put into <i>Mrs. Plunkett's</i> mouth is far from refined, but some of it is funny,
though the character and her peculiarities are become well-nigh threadbare.
A still more offensive type of femininity--<i>Caroline Anastasia Plunkett</i>--was represented by Miss Edith Blande with becoming masculinity. Miss Dora
Goldthwaite endowed <i>Shirley Tempest</i> with appropriate personal charms, and
finally, Miss Mary Wells did all that could be done with <i>Mrs. Tempest</i>. After
the third act, Mr. Clemens stepped before the footlights, and delivered
an address in his familiar vein, but with less than his wonted felicity
of style and more than his wonted drawl. "Ah Sin" is to be repeated
at the Fifth Avenue Theatre every evening until further notice.</p>
