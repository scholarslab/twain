<blockquote>
<u>Lapse of 3 months.  Deadwood.  The Chinese Quarters.  Rude board table on rocks on which is piled shirts, etc., on river bank.<br />  Music--Ah Sin discovered--song--speech.  Business--ironing, etc.  Enter York looking at his watch.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>L.2.E.</u>)  3 o'clock!  In my impatience I'm here before the stage coach--Why, there's Ah Sin!  Poor chap, since the mysterious disappearance of Plunkett, he has withdrawn himself from the camp.  I wonder if he hasn't a pretty good notion of what went with him?  If I could only make him talk--I've got it.  I'm wanting a servant--a good excuse for pumping him-- (<u>aloud and going up stage</u>)   Ah Sin!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Good day, John.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>C.</u>)   Good day.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
You wantee washee-washee.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)  Confound him, his only belief is in the universal uncleanliness of the American people. (<u>aloud</u>)   I say, John, do you know what's 'come of Plunkett?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Me sabbee.  Maybe Plunkee go with pretty lady.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
No--no--washee to-day, John.  But I'm <pb n="69" />looking for a servant, a good honest Chinaman, to be head waiter in my ranch.  You know the kind of man I want.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
All litee.  Me sabby. <b>Mellican man too muchee chin-chin--Chinaman plenty workee.</b><br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>with great significance, looking at Ah Sin.</u>)  I have sent for the wife and daughter of your friend and benefactor, Plunkett.  I have sent for them to come here so I might have some excuse for ferretting out the reason of his disappearance; you understand? (<u>aside</u>)   His face is as unintelligible as a tea chest. (<u>aloud</u>)   Well, I have determined to offer my house to these helpless women. (<u>aside</u>)   No delight, no satisfaction, and yet his poor old benefactor would have <i>fought</i> for <i>him</i>.  Well, it is the gratitude of the heathen.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Missee Plunkee go to you.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
Yes, and with this addition to my household, I shall need another servant, you sabbee?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Me sabbee.  Me sabbee. <b>Velly good man fo' you--Velly good man fo' missee Plunkee.</b><br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
Suppose <i>you</i> take the place.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Me washee-washee.--Pay better.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
You can washee-washee all the same.  Shan't want you except at meals.<br /><br />

 <pb n="71" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
<b>Me sabbee meal time--Chinaman likee meal time.</b>  You pay six dollar a week?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
Yes.--Is it a bargain?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
All litee John, I come to-morrow noon--no can come to-day.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
 (<u>going</u>)   That's bad, but I'll get along some way. (<u>aside</u>)   I've done a good strike! (<u>goes up.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)   May be me mighty poor servant--don't know how.  Well, me watchee-watchee do everything see Mellican man do--pretty soon me learnee. (<u>goes into house</u>) <br /><br />

<center><u>Enter Broderick and miners L.U.E.</u> </center><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
 (<u>stopping</u>)   Boys, I've changed my mind. <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
What's the matter <i>now</i>?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
It's not fair for me to help question Ah Sin.  I <i>hate</i> him.  I'd see something suspicious in every answer he made.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>2d Miner</u><br />
You're over-squeamish, Broderick.  You were <i>sound</i> when you suggested this examination of him, and as for <i>hating</i> the Chinaman, why--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>3d Miner</u><br />
(<u>interrupting</u>)   Now you hold on.  That's <i>manly</i> in Broderick.  <i>I</i> say, let's 'tend to it ourselves.<br /><br />

 <pb n="73" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st and 2nd Miner</u><br />
<i>All</i> right.<br />

<blockquote><u>Ah Sin re-enters</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
 (<u>going--aside</u>)   That wasn't badly done! (<u>exits</u>) <br />

<blockquote><u>York comes down.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
(<u>to Ah Sin</u>)   Looky here, my boy, there's a considerable suspicion around that <i>you</i> know what's become of old Abe Plunkett.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
No shabbee 'splicion.  Me got 'gagement.  Me go. (<u>going</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>2d Miner</u><br />
 (<u>restraining him</u>)   <i>No</i>, you ain't <i>going</i>, either.  Things look <i>ugly</i> 'gainst you.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
You bet they do.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
 (<u>returning</u>)   Suspicions against <i>him</i>?  What <i>are</i> they?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>2d Miner</u><br />
What are they?-- (<u>pause--a little puzzled</u>)   Why they are <i>suspious</i> of course.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
But--I mean the <i>particulars</i>.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>2d Miner</u><br />
Well--a--he--a--he-- (<u>to 3d miner</u>)   W-was there any particulars?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>3d Miner</u><br />
Well,--he--a--as I understand it, he--a---- Oh <i>this</i> ain't no time for conundrums!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>2d Miner</u><br />
(<u>relieved</u>)   That's the talk!  You just come along, Ah Sin.  If particulars is wanted I judge we can milk 'm out of you with a  <pb n="75" /> rope's end, maybe.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
 (<u>taking refuge behind York.</u>) Me not done nothing, me good Chinaman.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
If Ah Sin is suspected, let the law officers take up his case.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
We can 'tend to his case ourselves.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
There is no occasion.  It is the law's business--leave him to the law.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
But don't I tell you, we ain't <i>going</i> to leave him to the law.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
I must insist.  If you take him I shall appeal to the law in his behalf.  Your suspicion seems to be only a misty one, at best.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>3d Miner</u><br />
Come to look at it, it's <i>so</i>, boys.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>2d Miner</u><br />
Rot it, <i>I</i> thought we had <i>particulars</i>; but I don't seem to see what's become of 'em.<br />

<blockquote><u>York signals Ah Sin to slip away, which he does and exits into house.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
Lookee here--let's go and get 'em--and <i>then</i> take him.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>2nd Miner</u><br />
All right.  Now Ah Sin, you stay here till--Why, he's gone.  Mr. York, did you send him off?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
He has only gone on an errand.<br /><br />

 <pb n="77" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
Mr. York, if Ah Sin escapes, you might wish you hadn't taken so much on yourself.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
That may be, and may not.  I'm willing to risk it. (<u>exit R.1.E.</u>)<br />

<blockquote><u>The miners move off consulting together.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>2d. Miner</u><br />
It's just as you say.  It <i>is</i> sort of queer conduct on York's part.  Blamed if it ain't. (<u>exit miners.</u>) <br /><br />

<center><u>Enter Judge Tempest from near R.4.E.</u></center><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
(<u>C</u>) Bother these mountain roads--I wish I had taken the public coach and paid no attention to Mrs. Tempest's aristocratic requirements, she and Shirley must take the consequences for a while.  Now I have only 10 minutes to catch the up stage, to keep my appointment at Fiddleton.  What's to be done?  Hang it. Ah! (<u>looking around</u>)  Ah, here's a Chinaman--I say, John.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
How do, John.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
Do you know a Mr. York hereabouts?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Me sabbee York, velly well.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
(<u>aside--with impatience</u>)   The imperturbability of these Chinamen is insufferable. (<u>aloud</u>)   Well, come here!<br /><br />

 <pb n="79" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
You want washee-washee.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
(<u>furiously</u>)   No!  Confound your washee-washee--Come here I say. (<u>Ah Sin slowly shuffles forward</u>)   Do you see that hill? (<u>pointing</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
No sabbee hillee.  Me washee-washee.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>seizing him by the collar</u>)   Blockhead!  Look!--There,--look! The other side of that hill lives Mr. York.  Take him this note and you shall have--a dollar. (<u>handing note.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Sabbee dollar.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>sarcastically</u>) Of course you do!<br /><br />

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Mellican man no sabbee dollar?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
What the mischief does he mean?  Pshaw!  Well, tell him, the ladies are awaiting him on the summit of the hill. (<u>horn blows</u>) <br /><br />

<b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Mellican man plenty blowee hornee--got some fish.<br /><br /></b>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Judge Tempest</u><br />
Hang it, there's the coach; why the devil don't you go? (<u>hesitates looking at Ah Sin, who is regarding note quietly.</u>)   Go, at once! (<u>exit hurriedly. L.U.E.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Bigee foolee, wantee Chinaman walkee-walkee-walkee-walkee topside hillee no good Chinaman.  York say he come bimeby--all litee--me waitee.<b>  (<u>looking off</u>) Mellican lady comee--Plunkee wife--Plunkee daughter maybe--me watchee, all litee John. (<u>exits into house</u>) </b><br /><br />

<center><u>Enter Mrs. Tempest and Miss Tempest R.3.E.  Mrs. T. sinks exhausted on rock-bank L.</u></center><br />

 <pb n="81" />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
(<u>C.</u>)   I can go no farther; of all the insane projects of your father, this transcends everything.  The idea of leaving us here!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>L.C.</u>)   I'm glad our carriage came to grief.  It's so awfully romantic and all that sort of thing.  Here we are, two helpless women waiting for a <i>man</i> to turn up.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
(<u>angrily</u>)   It's perfectly exasperating!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Well, you have no one to blame but father and yourself.  It was all his fantastic idea that we should spend a day or two with this dreadful prodigy of his--this poetical miner, this elegant stonebreaker,--this Mr. York.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
My child--why do you permit yourself to hate a man you have never seen?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Why am I asked to be <i>interested</i> in a man I have never seen?  Mother, do you think I'm an imbecile?  Do you think I don't know that this man, York, is the eligible person whom you have picked out for me?  Do you think I have not fathomed the reason for Papa's discreet absence?  For your own discreet <i>presence</i> on this occasion?<br /><br />

 <pb n="83" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
Heaven help the child!  Why, he is the dear friend of your father.  And you, why you were willing enough to come a day or two ago.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>aside--sighing</u>)   That was because I expected to find the original of my photograph--Eh--what-- (<u>looking out at L.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
(<u>not noticing her daughter</u>)   You must remember too that this Mr. York--has been to this moment, unadvised of our arrival.  He has hardly got the note yet, which your father said he would send him.<br />

<blockquote><u>Enter Ah Sin--observing York coming and tearing up letter.</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
York come now, no goodee he catchee lettee now. (<u>exits R.2.E.</u>) <br />

<blockquote><u>Enter York L.U.E.</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>aside and starting</u>)   Heavens! 'tis she!--And the living image of the photograph!  Plunkett has not lied! (<u>business--coming forward--aloud.</u>)   A thousand pardons, ladies, but surely the stage has arrived early--I did not expect you for 20 minutes. (<u>both ladies recoil.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)  'Tis he! (<u>aloud</u>)  The <i>stage</i>?  There's some mistake. (<u>keeps Mrs. T. back with her hand.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>with grave politeness, perceiving her perplexity</u>)   Pardon me, but I have not introduced myself yet.  I  <pb n="85" /> am Henry York of Deadwood, at your service--your correspondent, who invited you to visit the house of your father. (<u>perceiving still further consternation among the ladies</u>)   I mean--of course the house of your <i>late</i> father! (<u>aside--observing greater consternation</u>)   There, I've done it--why the devil did I drag the missing father in?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
(<u>coming forward</u>)   But, my dear sir, we are--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>Xes to C.--holding her back.</u>)  You must excuse her; the fatigues of the long journey have exhausted her. (<u>aside</u>)  Be quiet, mother.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>R. confusedly</u>)   I presume I am addressing the original of this photograph? (<u>shows photo.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>C. advancing and looking at photo.</u>)   You are, sir.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
(<u>L. struggling to get forward--but held back by Miss T.</u>)   But really--I--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>apologetically</u>)   Then Miss Plunkett, I ask your pardon again for reviving distressing memories.  Let me beg you to allow me to withdraw a moment while I order a carriage to take you to your late father's home. (<u>exits L.1.E.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
(<u>impulsively</u>)   What is the meaning of this masquerade?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Only this, he has mistaken you for the wife, and me for the daughter of the gentleman who once befriended me here.  I told you all about it. (<u>aside</u>)   I didn't tell her who I mistook <i>him</i> for. <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
(<u>in alarm</u>)   But my child, he will return in a moment and discover the mistake.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Not if you will help me. (<u>going down stage</u>)   Mother, I've always been a good girl, hav'n't I?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
Well--perhaps a trifle wild and wayward and inconsiderate for one of your position.  But, yes--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
And my vagaries, as you call them, have never brought me to any harm?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
Humph!--not as yet!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Then hear me.  There's a little mystery here deeper than you see on the surface.  I want to get to the bottom of it. (<u>aside</u>)   I must know how he got that photograph. (<u>aloud, emphatically</u>)  Mother, for 24 hours, at least, you must be Mrs. Plunkett.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
(<u>astonished</u>) But my child--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Calm your chaste emotions, my dear mother.  There is no implied disloyalty to Judge Tempest.  Your doting husband Mr. Plunkett is missing.<br /><br />

 <pb n="89" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
This is intolerable--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
One moment, mother.  You wish me to accept the hospitality of Mr. York.  I will on only one condition--that I shall do it as Miss Plunkett.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
But what will this lead to?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
To the arrival of my father a day later, and an explanation of this harmless sport, nothing more.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
But if I should consent to entertain this folly, what am I--what am I to call you?  What is your Christian name?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
He will furnish that.  He will let that slip sometime.  Meantime, dear Mother, call me "My child," "My daughter"--or  (<u>embracing her</u>)   "My darling!" (<u>aside</u>)   He'll understand <i>that</i>. (<u>coquettishly</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
Well, well--of all your follies--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
This may prove the most practical--but hush--Here he is--<br />

<blockquote><u>Re-enter York</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
 (<u>bowing</u>) A carriage is waiting for you at the foot of the hill.  Ladies, let me lead the way for you. (<u>exeunt omnes L.U.E.</u>)<br /><br />

(<u>goes to table and lights pipe--sits</u>)</b> <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>snuffling</u>)   My poor Plunkett!  My poor dear sainted husband.  (<u>L.</u>)  Like enough this lovely scene was the very last his dear eyes ever tackled. (<u>sobs</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>R.</u>)   My, but this Californy's the land for me!  I reckon there's no end of gold here, and fellows that want to get married!  <b>(Miss P. has gone up stage and looks at clothes on line--then looks at a pair of shoes hanging up--Ah Sin goes to line, and snatches away shoes--puts them in house.)</b><br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>continuing her rhapsody</u>)   No doubt he has set on these rocks a many and a many a time-- (<u>stoops slightly and kisses the rock reverently</u>)  Roosted here and smoked his pipe and darned his socks and ate his beans and thought about us, so far away and cried. (<u>sobs</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
Fellows with loads of cash.  Becky Simpson hadn't been in Californy a week 'till she married a hundred thousand dollars, with considerable of a man thrown in.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>still sobbing and rhapsodizing</u>)   Dear me, dear me, to think <i>his</i> gaze, has gazed on that cabin there and the mountains over beyond and maybe that mule yonder--Maybe he <i>knowed</i> the mule, personally--he was always fond of 'em, and as for jackasses--Oh, they were like own brothers to him. (<u>sobs</u>) <br />

<blockquote><u>Ah Sin has been poking around in their rear for awhile, observes that Miss P. <pb n="93" /> has dropped her handkerchief.  He swipes, wanders away, puts it up his sleeve.</u></blockquote><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
I wonder what sort of a man is this York that's sent for us?  Like enough he's rich and wants us here so as to marry me--or mother!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
Poor dear, poor dear--how it all comes back to me.  The last time I saw him, 13 years ago.  Little did I think when I shied the skillet at his head that it would be the last time.  I  (<u>sobs</u>)  I should ever see him dodge.  When he said he was going away for ever and ever, little did I think that for the first time in his life, his tongue missed fire, and he was telling the truth.  My child, my child. (<u>to her daughter</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Plunkee got 2 childee--heap difference--other one high steppee stock--2:40 stock, plenty common stock, hossee car stock.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
Do you hear me?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
Yes, I hear you--I hear you, Mother, but I'm trying to study up whether that Mr. York's letters ever said, whether he was rich or not, or whether--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
Oh, my child, how can you be so worldly when the whole scene around you is reeking with suggestifications of your poor dead father, so to speak?<br /><br />

 <pb n="95" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
Oh, bother all that, mother, <i>I</i> never saw him in my life--Well of course I <i>saw</i> him, but I don't think I ever had a real good look at him, you kept him humping around so!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
What do you mean, child?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
Well, you always had him up a tree or shinning for shelter under the bed.  He wasn't ever still long enough for me to get acquainted with him.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>severely</u>) It is shameful--shameful to hear a daughter talk like this, right here where the lastest--Oh, if his dear spirit is here--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
But it ain't, mother.  And it wouldn't stay if it was.  And <i>I'm</i> not going to stay here either.  Much Mr. York cares to meet us!  Said he would be on hand when the stage came.  <i>This</i> looks like it. (<u>X.R.--to Ah Sin.</u>)   Young man, do you know Mr. York?<br /><br />

<b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
(<u>to Miss P.</u>)   Good day, John.<br /><br /></b>

<b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>indignantly</u>)   My name is not John.<br /><br /></b>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>chipping in</u>) A very dear and noble friend of my poor lamented husb--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>impatiently</u>) Never mind about that.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Yes, me sabbee York.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
Well, he is expecting us.  Doesn't know we have arrived.  Would you mind going to  <pb n="97" /> find him?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Can find in a minute,--no hab got hap dollar for Chinaman-- (<u>Miss T. is looking around for her handkerchief.</u>)   No hab got no can find-- (<u>to Miss T.</u>)   You losee litte something, eh?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>gladly</u>) Yes--Did you pick it up?  Give it to me!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Know litte something if you see him?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
Certainly I'll know it.  I could pick it out from among a million.  Give it here.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Maybe he belong to gentleman no lady.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
Perfectly absurd--any idiot could tell at a glance that it couldn't belong to a gentleman.  I tell you it's mine!<br />

<blockquote><u>Ah Sin gives Miss P. a stocking rolled up and exits--Miss P. lets it unroll--flings it from her with a shriek and is about to faint--when</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
Oh, my, here comes Mr. York now, anyhow somebody's coming-- (<u>begins to furbish up her spitcurls and arrange her dress</u>)   Nice enough looking man--Mother, we needn't seem to see him--let <i>him</i> make the advances.<br />

<blockquote><u>Enter Broderick L.U.E.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)   They're not back <i>yet</i>!  <i>Why</i> didn't I load them with particulars in the <i>first</i> place. (<u>starts violently and shakes as with an ague.</u>)   What was that!--nothing, nothing.  Every  <pb n="99" />sound blanches my cheek and racks me with fear.  Why, who are <i>these</i>? (<u>regains his composure and steps forward C.--lifts his hat.</u>)   I see you are strangers, ladies, can I assist you in any way?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>L. aside</u>)   So it ain't Mr. York. (<u>aloud</u>) If you will be so kind.  We are the wife and daughter of the late Abner Plunkett, who disappeared-- (<u>Broderick starts</u>)   Why, what is the matter, sir?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
(<u>annoyed</u>)   Oh, nothing, nothing. (<u>X.C.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>L.</u>) But you've turned so pale.  Here--take a smell of this-- (<u>forcing smelling bottle on him</u>)  it'll fetch you.  There--I told you so.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
(<u>C. strangling aside</u>)   Oh, curse her. (<u>X.L.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
There now, set down a minute and you'll be all right again sir.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
(<u>they both speak at once</u>)   Oh, no, it isn't necessary--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
I know them turns.  If my poor husband was here-- (<u>Brod. shows signs of discomfort</u>) --but you poor dear soul (<u>snuffling</u>)   he can't ever come anymore, for it's my belief some scoundrel murdered--You <i>must</i> sit down sir, you must indeed--it's coming on worse'n ever.<br />

<blockquote><u>The ladies assist Brod. to a log L. and sit down one on each side of him</u></blockquote>

 <pb n="101" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)   Goodness, what diamonds!  Why, this man must just simply roll in money.  If he ain't married, I-- (<u>aloud with a feeling look</u>)  if we knew where to send for your wife--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
I hav'n't any, ma'am.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>dumb show of satisfaction--aside</u>)   <i>That took</i>!  How sad at such a time, to have no-- (<u>with a tender glance</u>)  Perhaps you are chilled--will you let me-- (<u>she turns up her side of his coat collar on the side that is towards her.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
Poor dear, to be in his state, and not got any pardner-- (<u>aloud</u>)   You must take good keer of yourself when you have these turns--Mayn't I-- (<u>she turns up her side of his coat collar--she receives a covert savage glance from her daughter and returns it with interest.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
I'm a good deal better, now, thank you.  Let me walk a little--It will refresh me. (<u>rises and walks</u>)   Vulgar cattle!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)  He'll do.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)  Poor thing, he needs a pardner, bad--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)   It wasn't a false report then.  York <i>has</i> sent for these people--Damn him!  They must not get into his hands, I must get them into mine. (<u>aloud--coming forward.</u>)   Ladies, your references to Mr. Plunkett, <pb n="103" /> who was my dear bosom friend, have so affected me that I almost forgot I had a pleasant duty to perform by you.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
You, sir?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
Yes, my name is Broderick of whom your father may have spoken in his letters.  My friend and neighbor, Mr. York--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
<i>Our</i> friend too, he is expecting us--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
Yes, I am aware of it.  But he was called suddenly away from the camp an hour ago on business of the last importance, and he asked me to offer you the hospitalities of my house for a few days, until his return.  Will you do me the honor, and the great pleasure to accept?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)  This <i>is</i> luck! (<u>rising</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>aside--piously--rising</u>)   Hear that!  I do believe 'twas preforeordestinated beforehand!  Because he needed a pardner.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
It is too generous of you, Mr. Broderick.  If you are sure that we won't discommode--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
It is too generous, it is indeed.  Why, it's like entertaining angels unawares.  But if you are sure we won't disfranchise your arrangements?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
(<u>X.C.</u>)  Don't mention it--don't mention it, ladies.  I shall be glad to throw my doors open to those who were dear to my old neighbor, I shall be only too selfishly grateful to replace the loneliness of my habitation with the cheerfulness of your society.  Allow me to lead the way--(<u>bows himself out before them--aside</u>)   Oh, this is the luckiest stroke! (<u>exit L.U.E.</u>) <br /><br />
