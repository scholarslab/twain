<center><font size="+1">Disgraceful Persecution of a Boy.<br />
By Mark Twain.</font></center>

<p> &nbsp; In San Francisco, the other day, "a well-dressed boy, on his way
to Sunday school, was arrested and thrown into the city prison for stoning
Chinamen."  What a commentary is this upon human justice!  What sad
prominence it gives to our human disposition to tyrannize over the weak!
 San Francisco has little right to take credit to herself for her treatment
of this poor boy.  What had the child's education been?  How should he suppose
it was wrong to stone a Chinaman?  Before we side against him, along with
outraged San Francisco, let us give him a chance--let us hear the testimony
for the defence.  He was a "well-dressed" boy, and a Sunday-school
scholar, and, therefore, the chances are that his parents were intelligent,
well-to-do people, with just enough natural villany in their compositions
to make them yearn after the daily papers, and enjoy them; and so this boy
had opportunities to learn all through the week how to do right, as well
as on Sunday.  It was in this way that he found out that the great commonwealth
of California imposes an unlawful mining tax upon John the foreigner, and
allows Patrick the foreigner to dig gold for nothing--probably because
the degraded Mongol is at no expense for whiskey, and the refined Celt cannot
exist without it.  It was in this way that he found out that a respectable
number of the tax-gatherers--it would be unkind to say all of them--collect the tax twice, instead of once; and that, inasmuch as they do it
solely to discourage Chinese immigration into the mines, it is a thing that
is much applauded, and likewise regarded as being singularly facetious.
 It was in this way that he found out that when a white man robs a sluice-box
(by the term white man is meant Spaniards, Mexicans, Portuguese, Irish,
Hondurans, Peruvians, Chileans, etc., etc.), they make him leave the camp;
and when a Chinaman does that thing, they hang him.  It was in this way
that he found out that in many districts of the vast Pacific coast, so strong
is the wild, free love of justice in the hearts of the people, that whenever
any secret and mysterious crime is committed, they say, "Let justice
be done, though the heavens fall," and go straightway and swing a Chinaman.
It was in this way that he found out that by studying one half of each day's
"local items" it would appear that the police of San Francisco
were either asleep or dead, and by studying the other half it would seem
that the reporters were gone mad with admiration of the energy, the virtue,
the high effectiveness, and the dare-devil intrepidity of that very police
making exultant mention of how "the Argus-eyed officer So and-so"
captured a wretched knave of a Chinaman who was stealing chickens, and brought
him gloriously to the city prison; and how "the gallant officer Such-and-such-a-one"
quietly kept an eye on the movements of an "unsuspecting almond-eyed
son of Confucius" (your reporter is nothing if not facetious), following
him around with that far-off look of vacancy and unconsciousness always
so finely affected by that inscrutable being, the forty-dollar policeman,
during a waking interval, and captured him at last in the very act of placing
his hands in a suspicious manner upon a paper of tacks left by the owner
in an exposed situation; and how one officer performed this prodigious thing,
and another officer that, and another the other--and pretty much every
one of these performances having for a dazzling central incident a Chinaman
guilty of a shilling's worth of crime, an unfortunate whose misdemeanor
must be hurrahed into something enormous in order to keep the public from
noticing how many really important rascals went uncaptured in the mean time,
and how overrated those glorified policemen actually are.  It was in this
way that the boy found out that the Legislature, being aware that the Constitution
has made America an asylum for the poor and the oppressed of all nations,
and that therefore the poor and oppressed who fly to our shelter must not
be charged a disabling admission fee, made a law that every Chinaman, upon
landing, must be vaccinated upon the wharf, and pay to the State's appointed
officer ten dollars for the service, when there are plenty of doctors in
San Francisco who would be glad enough to do it for him for fifty cents.
 It was in this way that the boy found out that a Chinaman had no rights
that any man was bound to respect; that he had no sorrows that any man was
bound to pity; that neither his life nor his liberty was worth the purchase
of a penny when a white man needed a scapegoat; that nobody loved Chinamen,
nobody befriended them, nobody spared them suffering when it was convenient
to inflict it; everybody, individuals, communities, the majesty of the State
itself, joined in hating, abusing, and persecuting these humble strangers.
 And, therefore, what could have been more natural than for this sunny-hearted
boy, tripping along to Sunday school, with his mind teeming with freshly-learned
incentives to high and virtuous action, to say to himself:   </p>

<p> &nbsp; "Ah, there goes a Chinaman! God will not love me if I do not stone
him."   </p>

<p> &nbsp; And for this he was arrested and put in the city jail.  Everything conspired
to teach him that it was a high and holy thing to stone a Chinaman, and
yet he no sooner attempts to do his duty than he is punished for it--he,
poor chap, who has been aware all his life that one of the principal recreations
of the police, out toward the Gold Refinery, was to look on with tranquil
enjoyment while the butchers of Brannan street set their dogs on unoffending
Chinamen, and make them flee for their lives.<sup><b>*</b></sup></p>

<p> &nbsp; Keeping in mind the tuition in the humanities which the entire "Pacific
coast" gives its youth, there is a very sublimity of grotesqueness
in the virtuous flourish with which the good city fathers of San Francisco
proclaim (as they have lately done) that "The police are positively
ordered to arrest all boys, of every description and wherever found, who
engage in assaulting Chinamen."   </p>

<p> &nbsp; Still, let us be truly glad they have made the order, notwithstanding
its prominent inconsistency; and let us rest perfectly confident the police
are glad, too.  Because there is no personal peril in arresting boys, provided
they be of the small kind, and the reporters will have to laud their performances
just as loyally as ever, or go without items.  The new form for local items
in San Francisco will now be: "The ever vigilant and efficient officer
So-and-So succeeded, yesterday afternoon, in arresting Master Tommy Jones,
after a determined resistance," etc., etc., followed by the customary
statistics and final hurrah, with its unconscious sarcasm: "We are
happy in being able to state that this is the forty-seventh boy arrested
by this gallant officer since the new ordinance went into effect. The most
extraordinary activity prevails in the police department.  Nothing like
it has been seen since we can remember." </p>
<br />


<p><sup><b>*</b></sup> I have many such memories in my mind, but am thinking just at present
of one particular one, where the Brannan street butchers set their dogs
on a Chinaman who was quietly passing with a basket of clothes on his head;
and while the dogs mutilated his flesh, a butcher increased the hilarity
of the occasion by knocking some of the Chinaman's teeth down his throat
with half a brick.  This incident sticks in my memory with a more malevolent
tenacity, perhaps, on account of the fact that I was in the employ of a
San Francisco journal at the time, and was not allowed to publish it because
it might offend some of the peculiar element that subscribed for the paper.
