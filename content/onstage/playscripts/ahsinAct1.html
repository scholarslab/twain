Scene: -- <br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Music at rise of curtain.  Ferguson, Boston, Masters, 8 others, miners discovered on side hill at work--Broderick discovered in foreground working on his claim.  Animated picture--when music stops--Brod. throws down rock impatiently.</u><br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
(<u>throwing down rock impatiently</u>)  Always the same!  Red earth, pebbles and black sand but never a show of the yellow gold,   I'm sick of breaking a half acre of stone, to get half a loaf of bread out of it; and like as not, I've prospected the whole hillside just to make way for some fool to strike his pick into the one lucky spot.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
That's so!  Blessed if I point another pick. (<u>throws down his tool;--some of the others stop work</u>)  <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
But I say lads--if there's a scarcity of gold, there are fools enough in camp, and here comes one--York! the Gentleman Capitalist, the dandy scientist!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
Hang him!--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
His gentility is an insult to the camp.  As to his science!  Well, hold on, may be I might get something out of him there!<br /><pb n="7" />

<blockquote><u>Enter York R.1.E. in hunting costume with gun and game bag--<br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
Hallo York!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>stopping angrily, aside</u>)  Confound his familiarity!  (<u>aloud, carelessly</u>)  Good morning! (<u>going</u>)  <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
 (<u>aside</u>) Snob! (<u>aloud--leaning on his pick</u>) I suppose now you're ruffled at my hailing you that way? <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
 (<u>indolently</u>) Oh no!  Why should I be?  It's vigorous and--chaste--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
 (<u>impatiently--aside</u>) Hang his airs! (<u>aloud</u>)  You're looking for game--So am I!  Good!  We'll swop information; now if I should tell you where you could flush a flock of quails in the chapparel yonder, perhaps you'd show me how to bag something out of this claim?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
It is a fair offer, but you will excuse me if I plead press of time and decline it.  Good morning. (<u>exits L.2.E.</u>)  <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
Humph!  I'll get even with this gilt edged prig, one of these days.  (<u>takes up a handful of dirt</u>)  Confound it, this thing that's called a pocket claim is nothing but just a lottery with a thousand blanks in it and one big prize.  I might as well give up the game.<pb n="9" />  I wonder if Plunkett's got anything to drink? (<u>knocks on P's door L.2.E.</u>)  Plunkett!  Nobody at home I guess. (<u>pushes open door and looks in</u>)  Hello, what's this? (<u>reaches in and takes out photograph</u>) York's picture, flattering likeness of the puppy too.  What a mug it is.  Great friends Plunkett and York!  A liar and a snob. (<u>throws picture on stump</u>) It's a well matched team. (<u>looking into cabin again</u>) Next thing I oughter run across is a picture of old Plunkett's daughter, that he brags so much about--No, but I reckon here's the <i>original</i>. (<u>takes out bottle and drinks--smacks his chops</u>) Fine girl!  Charming girl!  I'll bet something that this is the only child that the gabbling old humbug has got. (<u>drinks again</u>) Pity but the family was larger!<br /><br />

<u> Music</u>--(<u>crash R.H. as if carriage breaking down</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
(<u>coming down C.--dropping shovel</u>)  Hello! boys what the mischief was that?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Masters</u><br />
(<u>dropping picks and running down the rocks</u>)  Boys it's the stage coach broken down--There go the horses--Hi there, whoa! (<u>all the miners drop tools and running down the rocks and off R.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
(<u>C.</u>)  The Stage Coach broken down, eh?  I'm glad of that, it never brought me any good.  Hello! (<u>looks off R.1.E.</u>) <pb n="11" />  There's that old liar Plunkett and with a woman in tow.  I wonder who she is?  One of his family come from the states may be.  I don't want to meet any more of the Plunkett tribe.  I'll step aside! (<u>goes R.2.E.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>outside</u>)  This way, Miss, look out for the mud there, that's it--ah, here we are!<br />

<blockquote><u>Enter Plunkett 1st and Miss Tempest 2d R.1.E.</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>L.</u>) The stage will be repaired in a short time and you'll be on your road again same as if nothing had happened.  Don't worry a bit, Miss.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>R.</u>) Oh, I am so much obliged to you, for your kindness, so this is the gold region eh? Rather a desolate place to pass one's time I should imagine.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
Oh, it's pleasant enough here Miss, we have any quantity of amusement.  Hardly a night passes but we have a ball, oysters and champagne suppers and all that--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
Lie number one for the old fool!  Oh--he'll sling his yarns now--as many as she wants. (<u>exits</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Indeed?  But let me ask the name of him who has so befriended me.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
Certainly, Miss, with pleasure; indeed you honor me by asking the question--I <pb n="11" /> am Abner Plunkett, pretty well known in this region, proprietor of the Goddess of Liberty mine--yonder.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Ah, a rich one I hope?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
You've hit it the first time, Miss--it's awful rich, Miss--ah Miss, I am afraid I have forgotten the name.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>laughing</u>) It is <i>so</i> easy to forget what one does not know.  I am Miss Tempest of San Francisco! (<u>removing veil</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
 (<u>amazedly</u>) What!  The rich Miss Tempest?  The heiress of Judge Tempest, the famous belle?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>sighing</u>) I am afraid you're right, I'm all that sort of thing.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
But my dear young lady, this is no place for you--Not, you understand, that anybody in Deadwood would dare to--to--to--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Pardon me, my good friend, if I continue my explanation.  You see when the stage coach broke down on the hill beside your camp, my maid was with me, and we were both on our way to the next settlement.  I think they call it---- (<u>X.L.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
Columbia?<br /><br />

<pb n="15" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Exactly, Columbia--to meet my father Judge Tempest.  When you offered your help, I was glad of the opportunity of learning for myself something of the ways and manners of the miners and also glad considering my unprotected state--to find in the first one I met--a gentleman.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
Oh dear, miss, you flatter me.--If any scoundrel--<br />

<blockquote><u>Miss Tempest furtively examines photograph on log R.C. Exhibits surprise, delight and a purpose.</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
A moment Mr. Plunkett, I think I can therefore trust to you keeping this episode a secret.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
 (<u>with effusion</u>) You do me honor, Miss, you do me great honor, and yet you only do me justice too.  In the matter of keeping a secret you can rely on Abner Plunkett as you'd rely upon a corpse--an old corpse, Miss--a mummy!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
I believe you. (<u>aside</u>)  I wonder if I could trust the good natured extravagance of this man?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
You have never been in this locality before?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>glances at photo again</u>)  Yes, once. (<u>looking <pb n="17" /> around and after a moment's hesitation--aside</u>) I will trust him! (<u>aloud</u>) Two years ago a brave man seized my runaway horses and saved my life, a crowd surrounded the carriage and in the confusion the stranger spirited himself away without waiting to receive our thanks or even disclosing himself.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
You saw him?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>languidly</u>) Only for a moment,-- (<u>aside sighing</u>) I wish I hadn't!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
And he saw you?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
No!  That's the worst of it!  It was dark in the carriage.  He might at least have waited to know whether it was an old or a young woman he had saved.  We advertised for the wretch but to no purpose.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
A singular case, Miss, but not without a parallel.  Why I remember once on the plains I stopped a vast herd of buffalo, 2,000 I should judge.  They were dashing down on a carriage <i>full</i> of women and children--I up with a big buck-- <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>hurriedly</u>) I know--the policeman told me all about it--But-- (<u>picking up York's picture from log.</u>) Who is this?<br /><br />

<pb n="19" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
That--ahem! (<u>aside</u>) York's picture (<u>aloud</u>) That Miss Tempest is a--a--my son, my only boy--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Your son. (<u>aside</u>) I'm sure this is a likeness of the face I saw for an instant from the carriage window.  (<u>aloud</u>) Where is he?  Does he belong here?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
 (<u>complacently</u>) No.  He was here a year ago, but he's gone, and confidentially, Miss he is engaged to one of the finest and richest heiresses in New York.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>aside</u>) This man's son!  In New York and (<u>X.R.</u>) engaged.  Can it be the same?  Yet (<u>looking at photo</u>) this is the face. (<u>aloud</u>) Mr. Plunkett, I've taken a great fancy to your son's picture.  Let me tax your generosity as I have taxed upon your kindness further--give it to me--you have the substance let me have the shadow--But stop--let us make it a fair exchange.  Here is my photograph.  It flatters me no doubt.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>inspecting it</u>) Jingo!  The living image!  I will wear it next my--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
There is a condition attached to this gift, a fancy of mine--I want you to send this picture to your son the day he is united to--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
Miss Grace Astor Livingstone of Madison <pb n="21" /> Square New York.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Miss Grace Astor Livingstone.  I may not be able to recall to him the face of one to whom he once did a service, but you will assure him that gratitude for that heroic service and appreciation of his rare modesty, have prompted me to send it. (<u>X. up R.</u>)<br />

<blockquote>(<u>She goes down stage sadly</u>) </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>aside--lays the picture down on board by his window L.H.</u>)  Oh, the mischief!  What have I done? (<u>inspecting her furtively--aside</u>)  I wonder if she sees through my--my bit of imagination and is chaffing me.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>aside and inspecting him furtively</u>)  I wonder if this son and this wildly promising mine aren't creations of the same prolific imagination?  I must find out.<br />

<blockquote><u>Enter Boston R.1.E.</u> </blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
The stage coach is ready, Miss. (<u>exits R.1.E.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
If you will allow me, miss, I will see you safe in. (<u>crossing to R.1.E.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Thanks with pleasure. (<u>exeunt both R.1.E.</u>) <br />

Yes--Yes--she's well enough, though nothing to what her mother was at her age.  Born rich, but didn't spoil her.  She's as lowly and as simple as a cauliflower.  Say, how's stocks to-day?<br /><br />

And yet what a perfectly exquisite result.<br /><br />

Yes, it was a pity--and there weren't any sense in it, and next they'd let up and just entirely neglect her for a spell.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
Oh shameful, brutal. (<u>aside</u>)  Poor child; poor child!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
That's just what <i>I</i> said.  Brutal--<i>that</i> was my word; why looky here, I'll tell you what they done once you see they'd <i>sunk</i> on her about a thousand feet--<pb n="33" />
(<u>York begins to stare at him</u>)  straight down perpendicular (<u>illustrating</u>) an air shaft you know--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
An air shaft?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
Yes--an air shaft<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
An air--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
 (<u>interrupting in a loud, annoyed voice</u>)  Yes, an <i>air</i> shaft you ass!  Are you deaf--Sunk an air shaft on her 'bout a thousand feet, then they drifted south 300 feet and couldn't find anything.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
 (<u>idiotically</u>)  Couldn't <i>find</i> anything--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
 (<u>loud</u>)  That's what I said, couldn't <i>find</i> anything--so they cut across from wall to wall--she was about 13 foot wide there--and timbered her up so she wouldn't cave in--just stoped her out you know till she was as empty as a jug--and then what did these everlasting fools do but put in a <i>blast</i> 'bout 2 ton of nitro-glycerine--and by George when that blast went off if it didn't lift her vitals!--Well sir of <i>course</i> her hysting works were out of order.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
 (<u>interrupting</u>)  <i>Who</i> are you talking about?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
Who?  I ain't talking about any who.  I'm talking about the Mary Ann.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
The Mary Ann?<br /><br />

<pb n="35" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
Yes, the Mary Ann.  Who'd you suppose I was talking about?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
I supposed you were talking about your daughter. (<u>X.L.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>stares at him about a minute</u>)   What have you been eating to-day?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
I don't know.  Why?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
Well, it's--well, it settled on your mind, if it had settled on your stomach 'twould a' <i>killed</i> you.  But say, never mind my chaff--I wouldn't hurt your feelings today.  I've heard about your being busted and I'm mighty sorry.  Of course, I wouldn't said a word about borrowing money if I--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
 (<u>interrupting eagerly</u>)  Not a word of that, not a word!  It's a <i>pleasure</i> to me to lend it, a pleasure.  (<u>forcing the $15 on the reluctant Plunk.</u>)  There, take it--Yes, I assure you I can spare it to <i>you</i>. (<u>X.L.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
But--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
But you <i>must</i> take it, for <i>her</i>--for <i>my</i> sake.  Now not a word, not a word!  (<u>X. aside</u>)  He's got a noble face!  I can just begin to notice the resemblance now, but at <i>first</i>-- (<u>he is looking at the picture.</u>) <br /><br />

<pb n="37" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
 (<u>interrupting</u>)  Put that in your pocket, York, if you want it.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
Oh, thank you; thank you. (<u>seizing both his hands</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
 (<u>with effusion</u>)  Don't mention it.  Once more, York, you've done nobly by me.  It's like you--it's like you York.  Take the mine, it is yours.  You've got the deed.  Thank heaven it has fallen to one worthy of it.  Come, come, take a drink on it and then we'll have a game of cards.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
You'll have to excuse me, I hardly ever drink and I don't know how to play.  But I see your friend Broderick coming.  Look out old friend and take good care of yourself.  Don't be too friendly with that man.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
Too friendly?  I ain't.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
And don't quarrel with him either.  He's got a bad eye, couple of 'em.  Good night.  (<u>shake hands</u>) <br /><br />

<blockquote><u>Enter Broderick L.U.E.<br />

<pb n="39" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
 (<u>aside--R.H.</u>)  (<u>observes him as he gathers up his tools.</u>)  York's right it ain't wise and it ain't worthwhile to be quarreling with a body's next door neighbor; poor devil, he's out of luck; looks a good deal cut up about his ratty old mine. (<u>aloud</u>)  Here, Broderick; what's the use of our splitting up this way, an unpleasantness between two men like <i>us</i> can't have but one end. (<u>Brod. leans on his pick to listen</u>)  <i>Bloodshed</i> and <i>death</i>! (<u>Brod. smiles amusedly</u>)  You know me--you know what I am when I get started, you know what I did in the Mexican War.
<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
(<u>comes down L.H.</u>)  (<u>sarcastically</u>)  <i>Every</i>body knows it, Plunkett.  We all know how you carved a regiment to pieces single handed.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
 (<u>R. pleased.</u>)  No--but did <i>you</i> hear about that?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
 (<u>L.</u>)  Why, it's common talk in the camp, some of your other exploits too, like that one where you surrounded a battalion of the enemy all by yourself and took every man prisoner!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
 (<u>still more pleased.</u>)  By George, I didn't think a little circumstance like that would be remembered.  But I did it!  By the great hocus-pocus I did that very thing.<pb n="41" />  Lots of people that are dead now were there and saw me do it. (<u>aside</u>)  Hang it, I begin to like Broderick.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
You are a dangerous man, Plunkett, this camp knows it.  It is notorious that when you shouldered your gun in the War of 1812 England gave in and hung out a white flag.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
Well, upon my sacred heart I supposed that these things were doubted--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
Doubted--why my dear friend, nobody ever doubts <i>your</i> word.  The rivers of blood which you shed in the American Revolution.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
 (<u>with effusion</u>)  Confound it, Broderick, I've always misunderstood you and I'm sorry for it. (<u>rises up and approaches Brod.</u>)  Any amends I can make--here--we've both been in starvation luck lately and have about forgotten what a square meal is.  But I've made a raise. (<u>showing money</u>)   And if it's be any favor to you to divide, why divide it <i>is</i>.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
 (<u>aside</u>)  Oho, this is luck!  Divide?  Yes--I'll borrow half and win the rest. (<u>aloud</u>)   Plunkett, there's mighty good stuff in you, I've always said that, and if you don't mind lending me--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
Here--help yourself and welcome--<pb n="43" /> (<u>they divide</u>)  Come--baptize the new dispensation. (<u>gets bottle from cabin window--passing bottle--they drink</u>)   Hang it, when I came over with Columbus--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
Oh come!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
Well, never mind about that.  It wasn't a matter of any consequence anyhow.  Columbus said if I had such a thing as a deck of cards about me--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
And had you?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
My friend, would I start on a voyage to a degraded and savage land without the appliances of Christian civilization! <i>No</i> sir.  I <i>had</i> them.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
Got them yet?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />
Would I lightly throw away such a memento? (<u>produces a greasy old deck.</u>) <br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
 (<u>R.</u>)  Yes--I see, it's the same old pack.  Would you like a little game of draw?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Plunkett</u><br />

<blockquote><u>Ah Sin is still taking rubbish from the inexhaustible carpet bag all through this.</u>)</blockquote>


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
