<blockquote><u>Enter Broderick R.U.E.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
The suspicion against Ah Sin wouldn't stick. <i>Why?</i> Well, I suppose they want higher game.  Very well.  It's York or me, now; and the best man wins.  I've got them started on his trail, and everything seems to promise pretty well.  But what of it?  To hang York will only give me <i>safety</i>.  Nothing more.  I am afraid nothing more.  There is that on my soul that will never wash--<br />

<blockquote><u>Enter Ah Sin</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
(<u>interrupting with a scream</u>)   Wash!  Me washee-washee.  You want wash?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)  Well, <i>safety</i> is <i>something</i>!  I wish the evidence were a trifle stronger.  I've got an idea--in the egg--and ready to hand, here is one of the devil's own chickens to hatch it. (<u>X.L. aloud</u>) Here, Ah Sin, you remember my buying a certain jacket of you once?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Yes, me lemember.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
Do you think you could furnish me a jacket of <i>York's</i> in the same condition that one was?<br /><br />

<pb n="113" />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
(<u>aside--X.L.</u>)  What Mellican man up to, hey?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
You don't answer. (<u>X.R.</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
(<u>thoughtfully</u>)  Me got plenty jacket to wash fo' York, but no got any blood on 'em.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
<i>Put</i> it on, then!  This is no time for mincing speeches.  Come--quick--I'll give you three hundred dollars.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
(<u>hesitating</u>)  Heap money--heap money--but--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
<i>Five</i> hundred!  Is it a bargain?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
All litee, John.  Me do it.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
 (<u>shakes hands.  Ah Sin surreptitiously wipes his hand on blouse, with the faintest perceptible show of disgust, which Brod. does not see.</u>)  Good Chinaman!  You shan't repent this.  Now prepare that jacket at once--bring it to me in your carpet sack quick as you possibly can.  Go--go!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
 (<u>going</u>)  All litee John. (<u>aside</u>)  Me quit washee-washee.  Too slow.  No pay.  Me sellee bloody jackee all time.  How me catchee blood--me stealee chicken! (<u>exits</u>)<br />

<blockquote><u>Enter Ferguson, Boston and 1st Miner R.U.E.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
You're too early boys.  I think you must be on the wrong track, <i>any</i>way.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
I bet we ain't.  York's the man!  The minute you dropped that remark about him, I <i>said</i> so--didn't I boys?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
Yes; and didn't I?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
And I too?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
Well, I'm sorry now, I said anything if it has turned suspicion upon poor York. <i>I</i> never should have been acute enough to see what an ugly look that circumstance had.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
<i>I</i> saw it in a minute!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
So did I.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
I had supposed you were founding your suspicions upon some conduct of his when you wanted to question Ah Sin.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
Oh, no!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
No, nothing suspicious there.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
I thought maybe his taking so much pains to shield the Chinaman and get him away--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
Why <i>here</i>!  I'd <i>forgotten</i> that!  Don't<pb n="119" /> you remember, boys, we <i>said</i> it was mighty queer conduct of York's!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
<i>Certainly</i>! Remember it perfectly well, now.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
Yes indeedy.  Come to put this and that together--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
(<u>interrupting</u>)  It looks worse and worse for Mr. <i>Y</i>.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Boston</u><br />
Come along, boys, my mind's made up.  We'll just <i>go</i> for <i>him</i>.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>1st Miner</u><br />
He's around here <i>some</i>where. (<u>going</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Broderick</u><br />
Now boys--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
(<u>interrupting</u>) 'Taint any use, Broderick.  He's the <i>man</i>--we ain't agoing to be argued <i>out</i> of it.<br />

<blockquote><u>Exit all R.U.E. Broderick rubbing his hands with satisfaction.</u><br />
<u>Enter Mrs. Tempest from L.2.E.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
Dear, dear me, what a muddle I'm getting into, representing another person, good heavens what will I do when all is discovered?  Well, Shirley drove me into the masquerade, and when the time comes to remove the masks she must stand the brunt of it. (<u>goes to flower stand L.  Music--enter Ah Sin with dishes which he places on stump of tree, busies himself at table--Mrs. T. observing him</u>)  So it seems Mr. York has made another addition to his domestic menagerie--I<pb n="121" /> hope this one is an improvement on the others, but he is a Chinaman after all and it's but hoping against hope. (<u>she stands at ease sarcastically noting the frantic efforts of Ah Sin to fix the table; presently she speaks to him gently</u>)  Wait a minute, stand still please. (<u>Ah Sin does so</u>)  There now, collect your senses and don't get frightened, you are doing very well-- (<u>musing aside</u>)  Poor afflicted creature, when he shakes his head it makes me nervous to hear his dried faculties rattle. (<u>Ah Sin smiles blandly--he struggles with table leaf.</u>)  Wait please, let me show you.  The table has a leaf, see?  It has to be lifted up. (<u>Mrs. T. lifts it up--holds it a minute to let him see, then lets it fall.  Ah Sin lifts leaf--holds it a minute then lets it slam down.--aside</u>)  Well, upon my word, this mental vacuum is a Chinaman to the marrow in one thing--the monkey faculty of imitating (<u>aloud</u>)  Wait a moment, I'll show you the whole operation. (<u>she raises and fastens the leaf--he raises and fastens the other one.</u>)  Now spread your tablecloth.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Tablecloth all same likee sheet. (<u>gets tablecloth and places in centre of table</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
Come let me teach you. (<u>she tries to spread it, it flies out of her hands and lights beyond the table on the floor--Ah Sin exactly imitates this performance and grins at his success.--aside</u>)  Well, he has imitated that too.  Looks as <pb n="123" />delighted over it as if he had done a miracle. (<u>aloud</u>)  Give it to me. (<u>she spreads the tablecloth.</u>)<br /><br />

<b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
 (<u>pats tablecloth</u>)  Allee same like a feather bed.<br /><br /></b>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
Do it that way, next time--Set your plates now. (<u>he sets a pile in the middle of the table and stands back</u>)  Oh, you innocent, is that all!  You provoking--but I won't scold you. (<u>seizing a plate</u>)  Here poor, neglected thing, <i>this</i> is the way to set a table. (<u>she flies around nettled, in spite of herself, sets one plate after another too near the edge--they fall off</u>)  There-- (<u>desisting</u>)  I <i>won't</i> lose my temper. (<u>he imitates her hurry and zeal--touches plate after plate to table then slams it on the floor--then stands back pleased</u>)  Oh, is there <i>nothing</i> in you but imitation?<br /><br />

<b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
No hab got a cent.<br /><br /></b>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>setting the plates right for his instruction--aside</u>)  Poor dumb animal, with his tail on top of his head instead of where it ought to be. (<u>aloud to Ah Sin</u>)  Surely you can't have had a very vast experience as a servant? (<u>Ah Sin proceeds with his work.</u>)<br /><br />

<b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Me velly good servant for Plunkee--Plunkee he A. No. 1. plopper man.</b> You sabee Plunkee.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)  Well, I must keep up this imposture with everybody. (<u>aloud</u>)  Alas, poor lost dear, he was my husband.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Too bad he go die--makee you heap sorry--Plunkee got nother wife.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)  What shall I say now?  Of course, he had another wife--his real wife--this Chinaman suspects. (<u>aloud</u>)  Ah, I am <pb n="125" />
not alone in my heavy grief--yes, he had another wife, several.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Velly good man, Plunkee, allee same like a Bligam Young.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
Well, go and get the things ready.<br /><br />

<b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
You got nufee?<br /><br /></b>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
<b>Yes, quite enough--go and get the things ready.</b> (<u>comic exit of Ah Sin in house L.</u>)  It is time that that giddy girl of mine, this fraudulent Mistress Plunkett, was back from her ramble--I wonder what she really thinks of our Mr. York?  York is evidently smitten, but she--oh dear, I wish it were all over and the Judge here--How stupid in him to tell her what he wanted her to do.--Ah, yes--here they are coming down the road together, and actually pulling away from each other like a team going down hill.  I wonder if the Judge's plan is going down hill too?  Well, I shall only be in the way here. (<u>exit into house</u>)<br />

<blockquote><u>Enter R.2.E. distantly to embarrassedly 1st. York and 2d. Miss T.--York beats the bushes with his cane--Miss T. pulls a flower to pieces.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>L.C. awkwardly</u>)  Well--we--are here!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>R.C. mischievously</u>)  Had you any idea that a walk in this direction would bring us anywhere else?<br />

<blockquote>(<u>During the following speech, Ah Sin enters, and by the time York gets to "nature and beauty" and turns<pb n="127" /> he finds himself face to face with the grinning Chinaman and utters an exclamation of vexation and disgust.  Ah Sin proceeds with his duties but is always in the way or between the lovers at critical places.</u>)</blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)  Can she be laughing at me? (<u>aloud</u>)  No, I only meant--That is--Miss Plunkett--I <i>confess</i> I had thought--I mean I had <i>hoped</i> that in our little ramble, through these calm sedate woods--that in our mutual admiration of nature and beauty, that in our sympathy with the good and the true, we might perhaps have--drawn--a--little nearer to--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
To luncheon! (<u>X.R.</u>)  We have!  The table is already set. (<u>to Ah Sin--taking up cruet</u>)  No oil--of course <i>something</i> would be wrong!  Go and fill it! (<u>Ah Sin exits.</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)  She <i>is</i> laughing at me! (<u>aloud</u>)  I--beg your pardon--Miss Plunkett.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>going to table and examining it</u>)  Excuse me a moment, but this Chinaman's glittering ignorance keeps one on the rack all the time, he needs so much watching. (<u>to Ah Sin, who has returned with cruet.</u>)  Ah--you've got the oil.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Yes, missee.<br /><br />

<pb n="129" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Very well.  But I can't trust you. (<u>smells</u>)  Pah! it's kerosene!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Him very good oil.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Now <i>don't</i> you know any better than to put kerosene in a castor?  Take it away and fill a clean cruet. (<u>Ah Sin, going, tastes the kerosene and exits with hot bowels.</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Me sabbee, clean cluet.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>affectedly--aside sadly</u>)  She is not only enjoying my discomfiture but is even laughing at my servants. (<u>aloud</u>)  But you will admit, Miss Plunkett, that these little infelicities of our mountain life add a zest to--to--is in fact the--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>examining table</u>)  Salt!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)  Confound it. (<u>aloud</u>)  I meant, that I owe perhaps to this very misfortune the felicity of being served by the fairest of hands--of seeing you--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>at table</u>)  Sugar!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)  This is too much! (<u>aloud--proudly</u>)  Miss Plunkett, you have checked me twice in an avowal that--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>to Ah Sin, who brings fresh cruet straight to her with <pb n="131" /> signs of vast satisfaction.</u>)  Ah--now you are sure you've got it right this time?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Oh, him all litee now!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Well, you are a good boy.  Now don't ever forget that there's only one kind of oil that's proper for a castor.  (<u>smells</u>)  Ugh!  Why, what's this?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
(<u>innocently</u>)  Castor oil. (<u>goes off L.</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>flings the cruet away--turns and perceiving that York is going R.</u>)  What!  You're not going to leave me here alone.  Is this your gratitude for my services as housekeeper? (<u>coming towards him with extended hands, archly.</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>gravely</u>)  I was going, Miss Plunkett.  I <i>was</i> turning from you that I might better hide in my own breast a secret I had no right to disclose.  I would have left you lest I should make an avowal that I <i>knew</i> was premature, that I <i>feared</i> was hopeless!  I love you, Miss Plunkett! (<u>she starts--he seizes her hand.</u>)  If for the last few hours I have seemed strange and awkward in your presence, it was because I had this secret in my breast; because I learned too late that what I had deemed my duty to my dead friend--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>starting</u>)  Your dead friend!<br /><br />

<pb n="133" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
Your late father, Miss.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
My late father! (<u>aside</u>)  Oh yes, 24 hours late; dear me.  If he were only here.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
That my duty to your father--to your father's daughter, was not duty, but love!  I know that honor, duty, even love itself, demanded that you should have known, long before this that you were not receiving the hospitality of a host, but the devotion of a lover.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>agitatedly</u>)  You forget yourself, Mr. York. (<u>aside</u>) Dear me, I'm afraid I'm forgetting <i>myself</i> too.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
No, Miss Plunkett.  It is I who am remembering myself now.  It is I, who am recalling the man who loved you before he ever saw your face, who had long before you knew him, dwelt upon your photograph, pictured you to his fancy--loved you as an ideal.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>)  Why, my goodness, that's the way I've been going on about <i>his</i> picture!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
And yet, knowing this, I brought you here, a helpless, fatherless girl--only to take advantage of your gratitude, to press my foolish suit.<br /><br />

<pb n="135" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Pray--Release my hand, Mr. York.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>sadly</u>)  As you will.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>embarrassedly</u>)  I have--kept--from <i>you</i> a secret!  2 years ago, at the risk of your own life, you saved a woman from instant death, on the banks of the Stanislaus River.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>carelessly</u>) Yes, I remember--something of the kind.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
I was that woman! (<u>perceiving York start--aside</u>)  What have I said!  I'm going too far. (<u>aloud</u>) --that woman's niece--you understand--she was my aunt.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>confusedly</u>) Oh, that woman, she was your aunt?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Yes, my favorite aunt, a woman I loved as myself. (<u>aside</u>)  Thank heaven, that's over.  What shall I say! (<u>aloud</u>) Hear me, Mr. York, by that heroic act you purchased the right--the only right you have of making me listen to you here.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>stupidly</u>) That woman your aunt?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Yes, certainly.  And if you'd really loved me--my aunt--I--mean,--I--mean--if you hadn't been so <i>stupid</i><pb n="137" /> as to go away without looking in the carriage, you'd have found her out  (<u>sobbing</u>) and me too--long ago.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
Yes, but how could I know the inestimable value of that old woman? (<u>aloud</u>) Then I am to understand, Miss Plunkett--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>hurriedly</u>)  Oh please, you're to understand nothing.  Only go now and come back in half an hour, and I'll tell you all.  Go, quick!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
 (<u>going</u>) Then, in half an hour I'm to come back.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>quickly</u>)  To luncheon.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
 (<u>returning</u>) To luncheon--<i>Au revoir.</i><br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>raising her voice</u>)  Mr. York!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
Caroline!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Please don't call me Caroline.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
I know I should have said <i>Miss Plunkett; pardon me.</i><br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
No, no--call me Shirley; it's a pet name, my dear old aunt's pet name, that's all.  Call me that--for--for--my aunt's sake!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
Shirley, dearest, bless you! (<u>exit into house R.</u>)<br /><br />

<pb n="139" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>excitedly</u>)  What have I done?  What have I said?  Not content with foisting a wife and daughter upon him, I've added an aunt!  An aunt!  Oh, heavens, this is too much.  Oh, I see it all--it's in the atmosphere, it's in the <i>name</i>!  It's that dreadful old story-teller Plunkett haunting the world again in <i>me</i> and <i>through</i> me.  Why, I think I couldn't tell the truth if I died for it! (<u>Xes excitedly and goes up to summer house--more seriously</u>)  In half an hour he'll return--what shall I say?  I'll tell him <i>all</i>. (<u>pause</u>)  No, I won't tell him <i>all</i>.  Umph!  That photograph is <i>mine</i>--not <i>hers</i>.  It's me that he loves, not Miss Plunkett. (<u>goes up to summer house and throws herself on a settee--up stage R.H.</u>)<br />

<blockquote><u>Enter Mrs. and Miss Plunkett, R.U.E.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
No, I won't hear another word!  Don't talk to me, Caroline Anastasia Plunkett, (<u>Miss T. starts at mention of that name.</u>) on such frivolous and worldly topics when every <i>liniment</i> of the scene around us fetches back your poor lost father.  Mind, I don't object to your making a match with this rich worldly man if you want to, though I wouldn't marry him though he was as rich as <i>Creosote</i> himself--only don't harrass <i>me</i> with it when I'm soaking my soul in memories of the departed.<br /><br />

<pb n="141" />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>R.</u>)  Oh yes, Ma, why didn't you soak your soul yesterday?  Why didn't you soak your soul last night in your memories of the departed?  Sour grapes!  It's because you were trying your best to get him yourself. <i>There</i>, now!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>R.</u>)  My child!  Remember I am your mother.  Such language to me is not respectable--it is even irrelevant.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
Well, I can't help it if it <i>is</i> irreverent, it's truth. (<u>tearfully</u>)  And the minute he gives you the cold shoulder you turn on him and talk harsh about him.  I think it's just outrageous. <i>There</i>, now.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>with dignity</u>) I am sorry if my simple effeminate attentions have seemed significant to him and to you, for I intended them to be, like all my conduct entirely <i>in</i>significant.  It more becomes my afflicted condition to consecrate myself to his sacred memory who is gone. (<u>tearfully</u>)  Peace to his ashes--poor thing!--But as I said before, <i>you</i> may go on and make this match if you think best.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
Well, I do think best, Ma.  And <i>he</i> does if actions go for anything.  A man don't moon around a woman<pb n="143" /> that way for nothing.  And sigh?  When he takes in one of those monstrous sighs of his, you can hear his clothes give.  I tell you Ma, he is hanging out signals, and they're for me, too.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
But Caroline, you haven't known him 24 hours yet.  This is all premature.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
Premature!  He must be worth a quarter of a million.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
Well, I won't make any more objections.  One son-in-law will do as well as another, I reckon.  I must try to be a good mother-in-law to him.  The duties of a mother-in-law and the duties of a wife are about the same thing I judge--6 of one and half a dozen of the other.  With the experience I've had as a wife I reckon that when I'm needed on deck I'll be no mere huckleberry of a mother-in-law.<br />

<blockquote><u>Miss T. coming out of the summer house quietly--unseen by the Plunketts.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>) 24 hours!  These are the people he expected, the people <i>we</i> have anticipated.  I must end all this <i>here</i>. (<u>advancing L. aloud</u>) I beg your pardon ladies, but I believe I stand in the presence of Mrs. and Miss Plunkett, the wife and daughter of the late Mr. Plunkett of this place?<br /><br />

<pb n="145" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
 (<u>hurrying to her mother's side</u>)  Oh gracious, this is one of those stuck-up San Francisco quality.  Look at her dress, it must have cost a bushel of money.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>to her daughter</u>)  Hush!  It's the <i>eclat</i> of San Francisco.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>sotto voice</u>)  'Sh! Ma, you mean the <i>e</i>light.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>continuing</u>)  Yes, miss, you see there the orphan child and here the stricken relic of the late deceased.  Two lonely, friendless, dissolute women.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
<i>My</i> name is Shirley Tempest.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
What!  You don't mean it! Not the daughter of Judge Tempest of San Francisco, that's got oceans and oceans of money, the great Pacific slope milliner, as they call him--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>aside to Mrs. P.</u>) Daughter of the Pacific slope millionaire!  My!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>effusively</u>) I'm proud to know you.  (<u>curtseying</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Perhaps not.  If you will retain your kindness for a moment, I may show you that I have unintentionally done you--and especially that young lady--a great wrong.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
Oh, don't mention it.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
When my mother and myself arrived <pb n="147" /> here yesterday, we were met by a gentleman--in fact, the gentleman of whom you were speaking a moment ago.  I grieve to say that I could not help overhearing that conversation.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>curtseying</u>) Oh, don't mention it.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
That gentleman, I have every reason to believe, mistook us for <i>you</i>, and I am ashamed to say that I encouraged his blunder, and out of sheer frivolity, prevailed upon my mother to assist me in sharing his hospitality as Mrs. and Miss Plunkett.  I should not have the courage to confess this foolish freak, but that it enables me to assure you from my own personal knowledge, of that gentleman's deep attachment to Miss Plunkett.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>) I don't like this.  So he's been receiving somebody else.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
I expect him here in half an hour.  I beg you will bear me company until I shall disclose in your presence my foolish imposition, and restore you to the protection of Mr. York your admirer.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. and Miss Plunkett</u><br />
York!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
<i>He</i> my admirer, I reckon not!<br /><br />

<pb n="149" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
May I ask of whom you were speaking just now?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
Of Mr. Silas Broderick our hospitable hostage.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>) I begin to see.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>brindling X.L.</u>) You can tell Mr. York we wouldn't take his hospitality, with such a suspicion resting against him. (<u>aside to Mrs. P.</u>) The idea of his <i>mistaking</i> that starched up thing for me!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>aside to Miss P.</u>)  Hush! (<u>aloud</u>) No m'am, we--we couldn't accept no attentions from Mr. York--at present.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Well come, let <i>us</i> at least be friends, (<u>extending hand</u>) and let me introduce you to your laggard friend. (<u>Plunketts show signs of hesitation</u>) Stay. (<u>laughing</u>)  I have an idea; if I have personated you in the (<u>X. to C.</u>) sympathies of this man, it is only fair that you should personate me.  Let me beg you to accept my hospitality to-day at luncheon, and you shall meet this sluggish friend, not as Miss Plunkett, but as Miss Tempest.  He will show his loyalty to you, I'll be bound.  (<u>aside</u>) If he does--I'll hate him.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>half-pleased--half annoyed</u>) I'd--like to, just to see him.  Mr. Broderick will not be here.<pb n="151" /> Yes--we'll go with you.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
But what am I to be?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>taking her arm</u>) You shall be <i>my</i> mother--but first let me introduce her to you.  Come, Miss Plunkett, you must keep us company, and help me in coaxing our mothers to stand by us! (<u>the ladies go up stage L. and off.</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
Do you enjoy the mountain air, Mrs. Tempest?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
What!  Missee Tempee!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
I am sure <i>you</i> do, Miss Tempest; the roses in your cheeks speak for you.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
<b>Plunkee one day--Tempee next--No sabbee--</b> Mellican man all mix upee.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>with studied dignity and aristocratic grace and composure</u>) I <i>always</i> enjoy the mountain air, Mrs. Plunkett, because the temperature ain't so variegated as what it is down on the lower latitudes.  The more equinocturnal the temperature is, the better it suits my constitution and by-laws.<br /><br />

<pb n="153" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>as Miss T.</u>) Mountain air suits <i>me</i>.  There's inspiration in it.  I can feel the poetry rumbling in my soul all the time.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
I feel <i>him</i> coming!  And, oh dear, I can't discover any pain about it, either.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
 (<u>looking off--looking at watch.</u>) I see Mr. York, has that peculiar masculine virtue, promptness.  He is here at the exact moment appointed.<br />

<blockquote><u>Enter York from house R.1.E.</u></blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>) Some <i>strangers</i> apparently.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
Mr. York, I and my daughter have had the good fortune to secure a most valuable addition to our luncheon party.  Let me present you to Mrs. Tempest of San Francisco. (<u>York shows great surprise, but instantly recovers himself and bows with great deference.</u>) Also to Miss Tempest. (<u>he bows again</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>) It isn't possible that <i>these</i> people--are-- (<u>aloud to the elder lady</u>) Am I right in my inference that I have at last the great pleasure of meeting the wife and daughter of my old friend Judge Tempest?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>in her new high toned way--for she is conspicuously trying to be the aristocratic personage she is representing</u>) I am mutually
<pb n="155" />
glad to say you are right, sir; and I am glad to say too, that the mutuality of your pleasure in meeting <i>us</i> cannot be more mutual than the mutualness of our pleasure is in meeting you.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>befogged.</u>) Beg pardon?--My hearing seems defective to-day--I am not sure that I exactly--understood--that--is--I--would you mind--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
Saying it over? (<u>smiling--rather flattered</u>) I was remarking that I was mutually glad to say you were right, sir; (<u>York listening with painful interest</u>) and glad to say too, that the mutuality of your pleasure in meeting <i>us</i>, could not be more mutual the mutualness of our pleasure in meeting <i>you</i>. (<u>pause</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>perfectly blank face and stupefied manner</u>) Thanks madam, many thanks. (<u>aside</u>) <i>Am</i> I in my right mind?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
I must explain that we sent to invite Mr. Broderick to join our luncheon party, but he was not in. (<u>York bows</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>pensively</u>) He wouldn't enjoy society and cheerfulness to-day, anyway.  He seems sad, and low, and sighs considerable.  I think it's his--his--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
His mind!--perhaps!<br /><br />

<pb n="157" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
Lor no--his liver!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
How that makes my mouth water.  You may talk about your sardines, and your ice cream and your quails on trust, and blankmange, and your <i>pates</i> de foy grass, and your canary birds stuffed with onions-- (<u>dumbshow of quickly concealed disgust on the part of York and the real Tempests.</u>) and all the other indelicacies that we, that have got money can indulge in; but as for me, give me <i>liver</i>!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>impressively</u>) That's good enough doctrine for me.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Tempest</u><br />
Ah Sin is a little slow with the fruit; I must hurry him a little.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
There's nothing like taking time by the <i>fetlock</i>.<br />

<blockquote><u>Enter Ah Sin with dish of fruit--trips and falls.  Mrs. P. screams.  Comic business. Exit C.</u>)</blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
My goodness, what <i>has</i> the poor heathen done?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
(<u>to Mrs. P.</u>) You likee him--You likee him you pick him. (<u>exits</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
Don't mind him--don't be afraid, dear Mrs. Tempest.  Poor Ah Sin is harmless--only a little ignorant and awkward-- (<u>Mrs. T. and York show great sympathy</u>) My dear madam, take some wine, it <pb n="159" />will restore you.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
Oh dear me, the thought of anyone being injured or killed reminds me of-- (<u>hesitating--she is nudged by her daughter's elbow.</u>) I had a poor dear friend, whose brief sweet life was a <i>poem</i> to all that knew him--<i>more</i> than that--it was a <i>sermon</i>--just a rounded complete and beautiful sermon, clear through from the doxology to the malediction.  But please let us change the subject--I can't think of him without going into ecstasies of sensibility, perfect ruptures of emotion.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
Don't you be alarmed about her. (<u>this to the company</u>) She'll soon come out of this!  Pa says she's a little too sentimental for <i>her</i> age, and I reckon it's so, too.  Pa tries to make me out so too--but he is mistaken.  Whatever I am, I'm not one of the sappy sentimental sort.  Excuse <i>me</i>.  I'm no gumdrop.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>aside</u>) And this chambermaid is the <i>divine</i> Miss Tempest!  Gumdrop!  Ugh!  This state of things is becoming intolerable.  I must contrive a change of some sort. (<u>aloud</u>) It is my pleasant duty to make your time pass as little irksome as I can, ladies, and if there is any diversion that I can offer--<br /><br />

<pb n="161" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>The real Miss Plunkett</u><br />
(<u>interrupting</u>) That's it!  Let's have a dance!--let's have a good old rattling breakdown.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>The real Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
Laws, child, dance indeed!  There ain't enough men pardners.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>interrupting</u>)--Allow me--I think I can offer a novelty.  My Chinaman is always meddling around the shows and picking up something or other, and he mimics everything he sees there.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Plunkett</u><br />
Oh, call him in!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. Plunkett</u><br />
That is the thing.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Mrs. and Miss Tempest</u><br />
Oh, excellent!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
Ah Sin!<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
(<u>outside</u>) Me coming.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
He will be a little diffident, maybe, but-- (<u>Ah Sin enters</u>) Ah Sin, these ladies want to see what you picked when you used to go to the theatres in San Francisco. (<u>Ah Sin smiles largely and exits--York exchanges wondering looks with ladies</u>) Why--what does he mean by going off?  Ah, here he comes again. (<u>enter Ah Sin with carpet sack--opens smilingly and takes out gorgeous costume,<pb n="163" /> and odds and ends of dramatic properties.</u>) Well?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Me pickee him up at theatre! (<u>general laugh</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
Oh, you are too literal by half--<br /><br />

<b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Too little--Mellican man say I fat enough to kill.</b><br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
<b>--too literal.</b> Now the ladies would like to hear you do some of the things you've seen at the shows.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
(<u>shyly</u>) Me no kin do such ting--too muchee people here.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
 (<u>calls him--whispers in ear--only the word "cash" heard</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Me singee littee songee. (<u>Ah Sin sings song--</u>)<br />

<blockquote><u>Music--Enter Broderick, Ferguson and miners L.U.E.</u><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
 (<u>advancing</u>)  Beg pardon ladies, but we don't want to intrude here.  We're only looking for this gentleman, Mr. Henry York.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
 (<u>quietly looking at Ferg.</u>) Very well, sir; your business?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
I don't want to--to--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
 (<u>proudly</u>) You can have no business with me that is not proper for ladies' ears.  Go on, sir.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
I am content then.  We are here <br /><br />

to arrest you.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
 (<u>rising with dignity</u>) For what? (<u>coming C.</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
The murder of Abner Plunkett. (<u>sensation--ladies rise--Miss T. throws her arms around York protectingly.  Mrs. P. faints.  Miss P. is startled.  Mrs. T. stupefied and indignant.</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>to Miss T. soothingly</u>) This is all some dreadful blunder.  One moment will clear it away--Why Broderick here, can explain!  He was last seen with the missing man.  Speak up, Broderick, man, you remember! (<u>Broderick shakes his head solemnly.</u>)<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Miss Tempest</u><br />
There is some treachery here, some conspiracy I am sure.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>amazedly</u>) But at least, Ah Sin here, knows that I--<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ah Sin</u><br />
Chinaman evidence no goodee.<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>York</u><br />
(<u>excitedly</u>) At least, I must know the authority by which I am arrested?<br /><br />

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Ferguson</u><br />
(<u>gravely</u>)  Certainly; by order of the highest authority in the land--Judge Lynch!<br />

<blockquote><u>(Ferguson lays his hand on York's shoulder--Miss T. falls upon her mother's bosom--comic business--falling back for Ah Sin. <b>Ah Sin sits on Mrs. Plunkett's knee--she pushes him off and he falls against Brod. who pushes him back to Mrs. P who catches him by the pig tail and pounds him with fan.)</b> Tableau</u></blockquote><br />
