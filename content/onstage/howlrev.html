                    <p>. . . He liked coming to Boston, especially for those luncheons
                    and dinners in which the fertile hospitality of our publisher,
                    Osgood, abounded. He dwelt equidistant from Boston and
                    New York, and he had special friends in New York, but he
                    said he much preferred coming to Boston; of late years he
                    never went there, and he had lost the habit of it long before
                    he came home from Europe to live in New York. At these
                    feasts, which were often of after-dinner-speaking measure,
                    he could always be trusted for something of amazing
                    delightfulness. Once, when Osgood could think of no other
                    occasion for a dinner, he gave himself a birthday dinner, and
                    asked his friends and authors. The beautiful and splendid
                    trooper-like Waring was there, and I recall how in the long,
                    rambling speech in which Clemens went round the table
                    hitting every head at it, and especially visiting Osgood with
                    thanks for his ingenious pretext for our entertainment, he
                    congratulated Waring upon his engineering genius and his
                    hypnotic control of municipal governments. He said that if
                    there was a plan for draining a city at a cost of a million, by
                    seeking the level of the water in the down-hill course of the
                    sewers, Waring would come with a plan to drain that town
                    up-hill at twice the cost and carry it through the Common
                    Council without opposition. It is hard to say whether the
                    time was gladder at these dinners, or at the small lunches at
                    which Osgood and Aldrich and I foregathered with him and
                    talked the afternoon away till well toward the winter
                    twilight.</p> 

                    <p>He was a great figure, and the principal figure, at one of the
                    first of the now worn-out Authors' Readings, which was
                    held in the Boston Museum to aid a Longfellow memorial.
                    It was the late George Parsons Lathrop (everybody seems to
                    be late in these sad days) who imagined the reading, but
                    when it came to a price for seats I can always claim the
                    glory of fixing it at five dollars. The price if not the occasion
                    proved irresistible, and the museum was packed from the
                    floor to the topmost gallery. Norton presided, and when it
                    came Clemens's turn to read he introduced him with such
                    exquisite praises as he best knew how to give, but before he
                    closed he fell a prey to one of those lapses of tact which are
                    the peculiar peril of people of the greatest tact. He was
                    reminded of Darwin's delight in Mark Twain, and how
                    when he came from his long day's exhausting study, and
                    sank into bed at midnight, he took up a volume of Mark
                    Twain, whose books he always kept on a table beside him,
                    and whatever had been his tormenting problem, or excess of
                    toil, he felt secure of a good night's rest from it. A sort of
                    blank ensued which Clemens filled in the only possible way.
                    He said he should always be glad that he had contributed to
                    the repose of that great man, whom science owed so much,
                    and then without waiting for the joy in every breast to burst
                    forth, he began to read. It was curious to watch his triumph
                    with the house. His carefully studied effects would reach the
                    first rows in the orchestra first, and ripple in laughter back
                    to the standees against the wall, and then with a fine
                    resurgence come again to the rear orchestra seats, and so
                    rise from gallery to gallery till it fell back, a cataract of
                    applause from the topmost rows of seats. He was such a
practiced speaker that he knew all the stops of that simple
                    instrument man, and there is no doubt that these results
                    were accurately intended from his unerring knowledge. He
                    was the most consummate public performer I ever saw, and
                    it was an incomparable pleasure to hear him lecture; on the
                    platform he was the great and finished actor which he
                    probably would not have been on the stage. He was fond of
                    private theatricals, and liked to play in them with his
                    children and their friends, in dramatizations of such stories
                    of his as <i>The Prince and the Pauper</i>; but I never saw him in
                    any of these scenes. When he read his manuscript to you, it
                    was with a thorough, however involuntary, recognition of
                    its dramatic qualities; he held that an actor added fully half
                    to the character the author created. With my own hurried
                    and halfhearted reading of passages which I wished to try on
                    him from unprinted chapters (say, out of <i>The Undiscovered
                    Country</i> or <i>A Modern Instance</i>) he said frankly that my
                    reading could spoil anything. He was realistic, but he was
                    essentially histrionic, and he was rightly so. What we have
                    strongly conceived we ought to make others strongly
                    imagine, and we ought to use every genuine art to that end. </p>

<center><b>XIV</b></center>

<p>T<font size="-1">HERE CAME</font> a time when the lecturing which had been the
                    joy of his prime became his loathing, loathing unutterable,
                    and when he renounced it with indescribable violence. Yet
                    he was always hankering for those fleshpots whose savor
                    lingered on his palate and filled his nostrils after his
                    withdrawal from the platform. The Authors' Readings
                    when they had won their brief popularity abounded in
                    suggestion for him. Reading from one's book was not so bad
                    as giving a lecture written for a lecture's purpose, and he
                    was willing at last to compromise. He had a magnificent
                    scheme for touring the country with Aldrich and Mr. G. W.
                    Cable and myself, in a private car, with a cook of our own,
                    and every facility for living on the fat of the land. We should
                    read only four times a week, in an entertainment that
                    should not last more than an hour and a half. He would be
                    the impresario, and would guarantee us others at least
                    seventy-five dollars a day, and pay every expense of the
                    enterprise, which he provisionally called the Circus, himself.
                    But Aldrich and I were now no longer in those earlier
                    thirties when we so cheerfully imagined Memorable
                    Murders for subscription publication; we both abhorred
                    public appearances, and, at any rate, I was going to Europe
                    for a year. So the plan fell through except as regarded Mr.
                    Cable, who, in his way, was as fine a performer as Clemens,
                    and could both read and sing the matter of his books. On a
                    far less stupendous scale they two made the rounds of the
                    great lecturing circuit together. But I believe a famous
                    lecture-manager had charge of them and travelled with
                    them. </p>

<p>He was a most sanguine man, a most amiable person, and
                    such a believer in fortune that Clemens used to say of him,
                    as he said of one of his early publishers, that you could rely
                    upon fifty per cent. of everything he promised. I myself
                    many years later became a follower of this hopeful prophet,
                    and I can testify that in my case at least he was able to keep
                    ninety-nine, and even a hundred, per cent. of his word. It
                    was I who was much nearer failing of mine, for I promptly
                    began to lose sleep from the nervous stress of my lecturing
                    and from the gratifying but killing receptions afterward, and
                    I was truly in that state from insomnia which Clemens
                    recognized in the brief letter I got from him in the Western
                    city, after half a dozen wakeful nights. He sardonically
                    congratulated me on having gone into "the lecture field,"
                    and then he said: "I know where you are now. You are in
                    hell." </p>
<p>It was this perdition which he re-entered when he
                    undertook that round-the-world lecturing tour for the
                    payment of the debts left to him by the bankruptcy of his
                    firm in the publishing business. It was not purely perdition
                    for him, or, rather, it was perdition for only one-half of him,
                    the author-half; for the actor-half it was paradise. The
                    author who takes up lecturing without the ability to give
                    histrionic support to the literary reputation which he brings
                    to the crude test of his reader's eyes and ears, invokes a peril
                    and a misery unknown to the lecturer who has made his
                    first public from the platform. Clemens was victorious on
                    the platform from the beginning, and it would be folly to
                    pretend that he did not exult in his triumphs there. But I
                    suppose, with the wearing nerves of middle life, he hated
                    more and more the personal swarming of interest upon him,
                    and all the inevitable clatter of the thing. Yet he faced it,
                    and he labored round our tiresome globe that he might pay
                    the uttermost farthing of debts which he had not knowingly
                    contracted, the debts of his partners who had meant well
                    and done ill, not because they were evil, but because they
                    were unwise, and as unfit for their work as he was. "Pay
                    what thou owest." That is right, even when thou owest it by
                    the error of others, and even when thou owest it to a bank,
                    which had not lent it from love of thee, but in <a name="b">the hard line</a>
                    of business and thy need. . . .</p>

<p>W<font size="-1">HEN</font> M<font size="-1">ESSRS</font>. Houghton &amp; Mifflin became owners of <i>The
                    Atlantic Monthly</i>, Mr. Houghton fancied having some
                    breakfasts and dinners, which should bring the publisher and
                    the editor face to face with the contributors, who were
                    bidden from far and near. Of course, the subtle trend of
                    advertising, who has now grown so unblushing bold, lurked
                    under the covers at these banquets and the junior partner
                    and the young editor had their joint and separate fine
                    anguishes of misgiving as to the taste and the principle of
                    them; but they were really very simple-hearted and honestly
                    meant hospitalities, and they prospered as they ought, and
                    gave great pleasure and no pain. I forget some of the
                    "emergent occasions," but I am sure of a birthday dinner
                    most unexpectedly accepted by Whittier, and a birthday
                    luncheon to Mrs. Stowe, and I think a birthday dinner to
                    Longfellow; but the passing years have left me in the dark
                    as to the pretext of that supper at which Clemens made his
                    awful speech, and came so near being the death of us all. At
                    the breakfasts and luncheons we had the pleasure of our
                    lady contributors' company, but that night there were only
                    men, and because of our great strength we survived.</p>
 <p>

I suppose the year was about 1879, but here the almanac is
                    unimportant, and I can only say that it was after Clemens
                    had become a very valued contributor of the magazine,
                    where he found himself to his own great explicit
                    satisfaction. He had jubilantly accepted our invitation, and
                    had promised a speech, which it appeared afterward he had
                    prepared with unusual care and confidence. It was his
                    custom always to think out his speeches, mentally wording
                    them, and then memorizing them by a peculiar system of
                    mnemonics which he had invented. On the dinner-table a
                    certain succession of knife, spoon, salt-cellar, and
                    butter-plate symbolized a train of ideas, and on the
                    billiard-table a ball, a cue, and a piece of chalk served the
                    same purpose. With a diagram of these printed on the brain
                    he had full command of the phrases which his excogitation
                    had attached to them, and which embodied the ideas in
                    perfect form. He believed he had been particularly fortunate
                    in his notion for the speech of that evening, and he had
                    worked it out in joyous self-reliance. It was the notion of
                    three tramps, three dead-beats, visiting a California
                    mining-camp, and imposing themselves upon the innocent
                    miners as respectively Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry
                    Wadsworth Longfellow, and Oliver Wendell Holmes. The
                    humor of the conception must prosper or must fail according
                    to the mood of the hearer, but Clemens felt sure of
                    compelling this to sympathy, and he looked forward to an
                    unparalleled triumph.</p>
 <p>

                    But there were two things that he had not taken into
                    account. One was the species of religious veneration in
                    which these men were held by those nearest them, a thing
                    that I should not be able to realize to people remote from
                    them in time and place. They were men of extraordinary
                    dignity, of the thing called presence, for want of some
                    clearer word, so that no one could well approach them in a
                    personally light or trifling spirit. I do not suppose that
                    anybody more truly valued them or more piously loved them
                    than Clemens himself, but the intoxication of his fancy
                    carried him beyond the bounds of that regard, and
                    emboldened him to the other thing which he had not taken
                    into account -- namely, the immense hazard of working his
                    fancy out before their faces, and expecting them to enter
                    into the delight of it. If neither Emerson, nor Longfellow,
                    nor Holmes had been there, the scheme might possibly have
                    carried, but even this is doubtful, for those who so devoutly
                    honored them would have overcome their horror with
                    difficulty, and perhaps would not have overcome it at all.</p>
 <p>

                    The publisher, with a modesty very ungrateful to me, had
                    abdicated his office of host, and I was the hapless president,
                    fulfilling the abhorred function of calling people to their feet
                    and making them speak. When I came to Clemens I
                    introduced him with the cordial admiring I had for him as
                    one of my greatest contributors and dearest friends. Here, I
                    said, in sum, was a humorist who never left you hanging
                    your head for having enjoyed his joke; and then the amazing
                    mistake, the bewildering blunder, the cruel catastrophe was
                    upon us. I believe that after the scope of the burlesque made 
itself clear, there was no one there, including the burlesquer
                    himself, who was not smitten with a desolating dismay.
                    There fell a silence, weighing many tons to the square inch,
                    which deepened from moment to moment, and was broken
                    only by the hysterical and blood-curdling laughter of a
                    single guest, whose name shall not be handed down to
                    infamy. Nobody knew whether to look at the speaker or
                    down at his plate. I chose my plate as the least affliction,
                    and so I do not know how Clemens looked, except when I
                    stole a glance at him, and saw him standing solitary amid
                    his appalled and appalling listeners, with his joke dead on his
                    hands. From a first glance at the great three whom his jest
                    had made its theme, I was aware of Longfellow sitting
                    upright, and regarding the humorist with an air of pensive
                    puzzle, of Holmes busily writing on his menu, with a
                    well-feigned effect of preoccupation, and of Emerson,
                    holding his elbows, and listening with a sort of Jovian
                    oblivion of this nether world in that lapse of memory which
                    saved him in those later years from so much bother.
                    Clemens must have dragged his joke to the climax and left it
                    there, but I cannot say this from any sense of the fact. Of
                    what happened afterward at the table where the immense,
                    the wholly innocent, the truly unimagined affront was
                    offered, I have no longer the least remembrance. I next
                    remember being in a room of the hotel, where Clemens was
                    not to sleep, but to toss in despair, and Charles Dudley
                    Warner's saying, in the gloom "Well, Mark, you're a funny
                    fellow." It was as well as anything else he could have said,
                    but Clemens seemed unable to accept the tribute.</p>

I stayed the night with him, and the next morning after a
                    haggard breakfast, we drove about and he made some
                    purchases of bric-&agrave;-brac for his house in Hartford, with a
                    soul as far away from bric-&agrave;-brac as ever the soul of man
                    was. He went home by an early train and he lost no time in
                    writing back to the three divine personalities which he had
                    so involuntarily seemed to flout. They all wrote back to him,
                    making it as light for him as they could. I have heard that
                    Emerson was a good deal mystified, and in his sublime
                    forgetfulness asked, Who was this gentleman who appeared
                    to think he had offered him some sort of annoyance? But I
                    am not sure that this is accurate. What I am sure of is that
                    Longfellow, a few days after, in my study, stopped before a
                    photograph of Clemens and said, "Ah he is a wag!" and
                    nothing more. Holmes told me, with deep emotion, such as a
                    brother humorist might well feel, that he had not lost an
                    instant in replying to Clemens's letter, and assuring him
                    that there had not been the least offence, and entreating him
                    never to think of the matter again. "He said that he was a
                    fool, but he was God's fool," Holmes quoted from the letter,
                    with a true sense of the pathos and the humor of the
                    self-abasement.</p>
 <p>

To me Clemens wrote a week later, "It doesn't get any
                    better; it burns like fire." But now I understand that it was
                    not shame that burnt, but rage for a blunder which he had
                    so incredibly committed. That to have conceived of those
                    men, the most dignified in our literature, our civilization, as
                    impersonable by three hoboes, and then to have imagined
                    that he could ask them personally to enjoy the monstrous
                    travesty, was a break, he saw too late, for which there was
                    no repair. Yet the time came, and not so very long
                    afterward, when some mention was made of the incident as
                    a mistake, and he said, with all his fierceness, "But I don't
                    admit that it was a mistake," and it was not so in the minds
                    of all witnesses at second hand. The morning after the
                    dreadful dinner there came a glowing note from Professor
                    Child, who had read the newspaper report of it, praising
                    Clemens's burlesque as the richest piece of humor in the
                    world, and betraying no sense of incongruity in its
                    perpetration in the presence of its victims. I think it must
                    always have ground in Clemens's soul, that he was the prey
                    of circumstances, and that if he had some more favoring
                    occasion he could retrieve his loss in it by giving the thing
                    the right setting. Not more than two or three years ago, he
                    came to try me as to trying it again at a meeting of
                    newspaper men in Washington. I had to own my fears,
                    while I alleged Child's note on the other hand, but in the end
                    he did not try it with the newspaper men. I do not know
                    whether he has ever printed it or not, but since the thing
                    happened I have often wondered how much offence there
                    really was in it. I am not sure but the horror of the 
spectators read more indignation into the subjects of the
                    hapless drolling than they felt. But it must have been
                    difficult for them to bear it with equanimity. To be sure,
                    they were not themselves mocked; the joke was, of course,
                    beside them; nevertheless, their personality was trifled with,
                    and I could only end by reflecting that if I had been in their
                    place I should not have liked it myself. Clemens would have
                    liked it himself, for he had the heart for that sort of wild
                    play, and he so loved a joke that even if it took the form of a
                    liberty, and was yet a good joke, he would have loved it. But
                    perhaps this <a name="b">burlesque</a> was not a good joke. </p>

Introduction by William Dean Howells (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1910)</font><br /><br />

<p>T<font size="-1">HESE</font> speeches will address themselves to the minds and hearts of those who read them, but not with the effect they had with those who heard them; Clemens himself would have said, not with half the effect.  I have noted elsewhere how he always held that the actor doubled the value of the author's words; and he was a great actor as well as a great author.  He was a most consummate actor, with this difference from other actors, that he was the first to know the thoughts and invent the fancies to which his voice and action gave the color of life.  Representation is the art of other actors; his art was creative as well as representative; it was nothing at second hand.</p><p>

I never heard Clemens speak when I thought he quite failed; some burst or spurt redeemed him when he seemed flagging short of the goal, and, whoever else was in the running, he came in ahead.  His near-failures were the error of a rare trust to the spontaneity in which other speakers confide, or are believed to confide, when they are on their feet.  He knew that from the beginning of oratory the orator's spontaneity was for the silence and solitude of the closet where he mused his words to an imagined audience; that this was the use of orators from Demosthenes and Cicero up and down.  He studied every word and syllable, and memorized them by a system of mnemonics peculiar to himself, consisting of an arbitrary arrangement of things on a table -- knives, forks, salt-cellars; inkstands, pens, boxes, or whatever was at hand -- which stood for points and clauses and climaxes, and were at once indelible diction and constant suggestion.  He studied every tone and every gesture, and he forecast the result with the real audience from its result with that imagined audience.  Therefore, it was beautiful to see him and to hear him; he rejoiced in the pleasure he gave and the blows of surprise which he dealt; and because he had his end in mind, he knew when to stop.</p>

I have been talking of his method and manner; the matter the reader has here before him; and it is good matter, glad, honest, kind, just.</p>
