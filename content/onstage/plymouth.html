  PILGRIM DESCENDENTS</i></b></font><br />

<b>A Notable Dinner at the Continental Hotel --<br />
Addresses by President Rollins, Senator Frye,<br />
Gov. Hoyt, President Hopkins, and Mark Twain.</b></center>
<hr width="40%" />

<p>The main dining-room of the Continental Hotel presented a beautiful and picturesque scene
last night on the occasion of the First Annual Festival of the New England Society of
Pennsylvania.  The society was formed a few weeks since by residents of this city who are natives
of or descendants from good old Puritan stock.  The object of the association is good-fellowship
and the honoring of a worthy ancestry, of which all the sons of New England are justly proud.
The day fixed for the annual festival, the 22nd of December, is "Forefathers' Day," the anniversary
of the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers.  The society determined to make their first festival a notable
one, and to that end invited many notable descendants of the Eastern States, who showed their
appreciation by attending in person.  The dinner hour was fixed last evening at six o'clock, and
notwithstanding the stormy weather, the members and guests began to arrive promptly on time.
They were ushered into Parlor C, where the president of the society, E.A. Rollins, and Gov. Hoyt,
a vice-president, held an informal reception.  Never was there seen a more solid and respectable
gathering of business men, leaders of the bench and bar, newspaper editors and proprietors,
clergymen and college professors, all gathered to do honor to their native section of country.  The
tall form of President Hopkins, of Williams College, was seen in the throng as he conversed with
Admiral George H. Preble.  Senator Frye, of Maine, stood chatting with Governor Hoyt.  Mark
Twain stood in one corner uttering drolleries which caused his auditors to guffaw in a manner
highly reprehensible in staid and sober citizens.  John Welsh conversed with Frederick Fraley, and
Rev. H. Clay Trumbull, secretary of the society, darted hither and thither, arranging things
generally for the event.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock the line was formed, and headed by President E.A. Rollins and Professor
Hopkins, of Williams College, the members and guests proceeded to the dining-room.  President
Rollins took his seat at the centre of the north table.  On his right were Professor Hopkins,

Maine; Governor Hoyt, Samuel L. Clemens (Mark Twain), Lieutenant Thackara, U.S.N.; Rev.
W.N. McVickar, Judge Allison, Rev. George Dana, Boardman Chaplain, and Clarence H. Clark,

Altogether one hundred and fifty gentlemen sat down.</p>

  <center><b><font size="-1">THE BANQUETTING ROOM.</font></b></center>
<hr width="30%" />

<p>The room was elegantly and most appropriately decorated.  The chandeliers were festooned
with smilax.  Hanging-baskets were suspended along the walls and before the windows.  At the
eastern end of the room were stately palms, graceful camelias and rare plants perfuming the air
with fragrance.  A magnificent design composed of immortelles in red, yellow and purple, was
prominent at this end of the hall.  It bore in large letters the inscription:</p>

<center>December 22,<br />
1620-1881</center>

<p>Along the north end of the hall a long table was ranged, at which the officers and
distinguished guests were seated as given above.  Extending transversely from this were several
other long tables, around which were placed the members.</p>

<p>Beside each plate lay a toast list, printed on hand-made paper of the style of two centuries
ago.  There was also a menu of the most artistic and original design.  It was printed in chocolate-colored ink, and bore on the first page a representation of the Mayflower making her perilous
voyage, with the Pilgrim Fathers on board.  On the last page was a portrait of John Alden's
Priscilla, one of whose descendants was present at the festival.  The bill of fare was printed in
antique type, and was as follows:</p>

<center><b><font size="-1">PRESIDENT ROLLINGS' ADDRESS.</font></b></center>
<hr width="30%" />

<p>As soon as the members and guests reached their places President Rollins requested Rev. W.
Nelson McVikar to offer up prayer, which he did in an impressive manner.  The dinner was then
served and full justice done to it.  After an unlucky member had been threatened with expulsion
because he preferred stewed terrapin to pork and beans President Rollins arose to welcome those
present. He stood in an easy, graceful attitude, and spoke without using notes.  His neat,
humorous remarks were frequently interrupted by loud laughter and his patriotic sentiments were
heartily applauded.  He spoke as follows:</p>

<p>Fathers, brothers, uncles, nephews, cousins, as descendants of New England, we are all
relatives.  I congratulate you heartily upon the comfortable landing we have made here this
evening.  Upon my honor I do half believe, that if the Pilgrim Fathers had known of this good
hostelry with its canvas back and terrapin, they would themselves have landed here.  But I will not
do them this rank injustice -- never were men lured less by love of pleasure or constrained by
higher motives.</p>

<p>We here in Philadelphia, in connection with local politics, have heard much of a Committee of
a Hundred, but that Committee of a Hundred men, women and children which sailed from
Plymouth, in September, 1620, and which in journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of their
own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in
weariness and painfulness in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and
nakedness, gave its politics to this North American continent, and for all time and through their
descendants, largely to that of  South America as well, was the grandest committee of which
history has made record.</p>

<p>On the 22d of November, in the harbor of Provincetown, in the cabin of the Mayflower, they
adopted their form of Government -- signed their compact, and chose John Carver Governor.  At
that election every man who was authorized to do so cast his ballot I believe -- cast it once and
had it counted.  That was the New England "idea" and it remains so unto this day.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 22d of December, 261 years ago, when the sun had just entered its winter
solstice and the days were the shortest and the nights the longest and the cold the bitterest of all
the year, having rested Sunday that they might not descecrate it but keep it holy unto the Lord,
the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock, placed for their feet, apparently, by the hand of God
himself, for there was not another like it -- not of the same material even, for miles and miles -- a
stone of only a few tons weight -- a few feet only this was, and this a stepping-stone -- but not the
philosopher's stone -- nor the Moabite stone -- nor Jacob's stone in the chapel of Ednam, the
confessor in Westminster Abbey, on which the Kings of Scotland and afterwards the United
Kingdom, have received their crowns for a thousand years, nor that wondrous stone, which
travelers kiss, high up in Blarney Castle -- not one or all of them together, have enriched this
world so much as Plymouth Rock.</p>

<center><font size="-1">THE COMPACT OF SELF-GOVERNMENT.</font></center>

<p>The compact which the Pilgrims signed, and with which they landed and under which they
lived, and which they have transmitted to their children and their children's children, was that of
self-government, the government of the people by the people for the people.  Out of that grand
principle the Constitution of the United States was builded and when in after years the rains
descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house -- it fell not, for it
was founded upon a rock.  My friends, here is a piece of Plymouth Rock, which was kindly given
to me by an old resident of Plymouth, and now a member of this society and present with us, Mr.
T.E. Cornish.  For three and a half months from that landing and during all the perils and horrors
of that awful winter the Mayflower rocked at anchor in the harbor, and when, on the 5th of April
following, she</p>
<center>"Took the wind upon her quarter, and stood for the open Atlantic,"</center>
<p>not one of the 100 pilgrims returned in her.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Possibly John Alden staid because of his Priscilla -- mayhap also on her account,  Miles
Standish also, and Priscilla may have stayed for both.  In saying this I trust that our member, Mr.
Watters, would remember that I would not speak lightly of his country.  Probably, however, few
were sea-sick coming over, and so wisely enough determined to make the rest of their earthly
pilgrimage by land.  But making due allowance for all this, when we remember that of the one
hundred who were living in December almost one-half, from exposure and disease, were dead;
that all the living who had strength enough gathered on the bluff and saw the little ship go back
without one thought of going back themselves; that food, strength, health, life itself gave out, but
courage, heroism, devotion to their great cause, never -- we remember that not at Thermopylae,
nor Marathon, nor Bannochburn, nor Marston Moor, nor any other battlefield, has the world
witnessed such a marvelous exhibition of the grandeur of human nature as on that day at
Plymouth.</p>

<center><font size="-1">THE MARCH OF PIE.</font></center>
<p>Only six months and a little more and after that the Plymouth Colonists celebrate their first
Thanksgiving.  I don't know what pies they had nor what pork and beans on that occasion, but
these things and Thanksgiving Day itself are the gift of the Pilgrims, and through their
descendants they have spread all over the land.  I think it was Mark Twain, and if it were not I
hope nobody will correct me, who first called the attention of the moral and hygenic world to the
great pie zone which then extended from about where we sit due west to the Pacific.  North of it
was one vast sea of pie.  South of it there was not one sporadic pie, but the zone moved on and
Sherman's triumphant march to the sea was not more certain and inevitable than the march of pie
and beans from the Canadas to the Gulf.  The Pilgrims' Thanksgiving has become the National
festival of the mightiest, freest, and, thanking God, I believe most united people the sun shines
on.</p>

<p>The hundred Pilgrims headed the procession of 20,000 English men and English women who
came to New England in the next twenty years, and before the meeting of the Long Parliament,
and there were only about a thousand afterwards for nearly one hundred and fifty years, nor until
the Revolutionary War.  Those 20,000 made New England what she was and largely what she is.
As late as 1858 Dr. Palfrey in a carefully prepared statement in his first volume of the History of
New England, in speaking of New Englanders and their modes says: "There is probably not a
county in England occupied by a population of purer English blood than theirs, and I presume
there is one-third of the people of these United States, wheresoever now residing, who could
peruse this volume without reading the history of his own progenitors."</p>

<p>The sons of New England are scattered throughout our wide domain and everywhere they are
at home: for over the home of every man in this broad land, seen or unseen, floats the dear old
flag of his childhood.  They have carried with them not alone a love for their peculiar food, and of
their honored feast-day, but as well their enterprise, their courage and power of endurance, their
school system and their high estimate of education, their conscience and their freedom to worship
God according to its dictates, and their worship of Him also, and to-day the people of every State
and territory, and every town and hamlet in these United States are a better people, and their
Government is a better Government, because of the Pilgrim Fathers.  To the casual observer it
might seem that in something I have said, I have trenched somewhat upon the first subject in our
intellectual menu, which is, "The Pilgrims and Their Creation, New England," but I haven't, for
the subject is as inexhaustible as filial affection, and its aspects are as various and numberless as
the leaves of an autumnal forest in the good old State of Maine.</p>

<p>[<i>Between Rollins' address and MT's there were six toasts, mostly quoted in full:<br />
"New England," given by Senator Frye;<br />
"Pennsylvania,"  Governor Hoyt;<br />
"The Army and Navy of the United States," Rear-Admiral George Henry Peble;<br />
"New England and Education," Rev. Mark Hopkins;<br />
"The Mission of New England," Rev. George Dana Boardman;<br />
"The Press of New England," Charles Emory Smith.<br />
There were humorous moments in all these toasts, though the dominant tone was sanctimonious.
The account concluded with MT's address, introduced in this way:</i>]</p>

<hr width="45%" />
<center><b><font size="-1">MARK TWAIN'S SPEECH.</font></b></center>
<hr width="30%" />
<p>Mr. Rollins said that the next speaker, while not born in New England, had done the best he
could, for he had his children born there and thus had made himself a New England ancestor.  He
thus introduced Mark Twain, who sat to the left of Governor Hoyt.  Mr. Clemens rose and in a
peculiar, sleepy manner began his remarks by thanking the company for the deserved compliment
to himself and to his posterity.  "I shall continue to do my best," drawled out the speaker, who
continued as follows:</p>
