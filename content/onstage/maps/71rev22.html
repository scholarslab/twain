          <b>Mark Twain.</b>
        </center>

        <p>A finer audience has seldom been gathered in this city
        than assembled to hear "Mark Twain" in Luce's Hall last
        night. Not only were all the seats full, but every foot of
        standing room was occupied. All appeared anxious to see as
        well as hear the lecturer whose <i>nom de plume</i> has
        become so familiar. Mr. Clements is of medium height,
        slight but compact figure, with black hair, eyes and
        moustache. His oratorical efforts must be heard from his
        own lips to be appreciated. His manner is inimitably droll,
        and he speaks with a nasal twang that is of itself amusing.
        On coming forward he was greeted with a hearty round of
        applause, and stood for a minute or so gazing in an absurd,
        vacant sort of way at the audience, as if he had forgotten
        his "piece," or was expecting "music by the band." As soon
        as the laughter had subsided, however, he coughed a modest
        little cought, and began somewhat as follows:</p>

        <p>"Ladies and gentlemen, I ask leave to introduce to you
        the lecturer of the evening, Mr. Samuel B. Clements,
        otherwise known as 'Mark Twain,' a gentleman, I may say,
        whose devotion to science, aptness in philosophy,
        historical accuracy and love of -- truth [laughter] are in
        perfect harmony with his majestic and imposing presence, I
        -- ah -- refer -- ah -- indirectly to -- to myself! It is
        not, I know, customary to introduce a lecturer after having
        the amount of advertising that I have had; but as the
        management desired that the introduction should be made, I
        preferred making it myself, being sure by this means of
        getting in all the facts!"</p>

        <p>He then remarked that he got very weary of repeating the
        same lecturer night after night; he formerly had one that
        he liked first rate, but he had got tired of it; lately he
        had been using another one, but had also got tired of that.
        He thought he had a mission to go about lecturing and doing
        good and telling the truth -- at intervals. He had a new
        book in press -- a book of 600 pages, same style as
        "Innocents Abroad," splendidly illustrated, and costing
        only -- but he wasn't canvassing for the book. No; only, if
        they wished it, he could read them thirty or forty pages of
        it from memory, or indeed the whole 600 pages. Then,
        perhaps observing a slight shudder in the audience at such
        a dismal prospect, he said he believed he would tell them
        something about his trip across the continent, in wagons,
        through the rains, and snows, and snakes, and sage-brush,
        and alkali flats, and hardships, and over the mountains and
        down the valleys, nineteen hundred miles to California. His
        descriptions of the sage-brush plains and arid and sterile
        mountains of Nevada were very fine, and his experience with
        a "Mexican blood" horse -- "the best bucker in America" --
        was ludicrous in the extreme. He described Lake Tahoe, in
        Nevada, as the noblest, loveliest inland sea in the whole
        world -- a master work of nature -- a hundred miles in
        circumference, six thousand feet above the sea -- an oval
        mirror framed by snow-capped mountains ten thousand feet
        high, and whose waters were so clear that the smallest
        pebbles were distinctly visible at the bottom, eighty feet
        from the surface. This lake, he said, never freezes, though
        Lake Donner, in the immediate vicinity, does; and that was
        a question for science -- not why Lake Donner does freeze,
        but why Lake Tahoe don't. He advised all invalids to go
        there; and he earnestly urged all sportsmen to shoulder
        their rifles and proceed to Tahoe at once, for it is "the
        best hunting ground in the world; you might hunt a year --
        and never find anything. There's no game there, except
        mountain sheep and seven-up." The sheep are American
        chamois, have big horns, and you can see them -- with a
        spy-glass; but it's hard to shoot them -- with a spy-glass.
        He then gave his ideas of silver-mining before he tried it,
        and described the business as actually carried on; told
        several amusing anecdotes in connection with his failure at
        mining and adoption of a "literary career," and finally
        wound-up by asking the indulgence of the audience for
        changing the subject of his lecture, and made his bow amid
        mingled applause and laughter.</p>

        <p>This, of course, is not at all a "report" of Mr.
        Clement's effort last evening, but our readers can judge of
        the whole from the brief specimen we give. Honestly, we
        think it was a failure, and as far as we could judge, the
        audience were pretty much of that opinion.</p>
