        [Reprinted from the <i>Oswego Commercial Advertiser and
        Times</i>, 14 January 1869]<br />
        <br />

        <p>The Hartford <i>Courant</i> says:</p>

        <p>Perhaps we can find in the cyclopedia more than he told
        us about the Sandwich Islands, more and a good deal less.
        But we do not find Mark Twain in the cyclopedia account,
        nor his peculiar manner of looking at things. The art of
        the lecture consisted in the curious mingling of grave
        narration and description with the most comical
        association, and with occasional flashes of genuine wit.
        And the whole was leavened by a manner that would make the
        fortune of a comedian. Mr. Dickens' greatest success was in
        comedy, and even his finest passages of humor owed their
        best effect to the manner of the artist. In the humorous
        lecture or reading it is impossible to separate the person
        from what he says or reads.</p>
