          <b>Mark Twain on Wednesday Night.</b>
        </center>

        <p>We were not surprised, after hearing Mark Twain on
        Wednesday night, at the Opera House, that he had so many
        empty seats to talk to. Those who heard him once, did not
        care to suffer the infliction the second time. His subject
        on this occasion was "Artemus Ward," whom he considered a
        born humorist, and he proceeded to string together, in a
        sing-song, nasal twang, a large number of funny sayings of
        Artemus Ward, interspersed with some of his own so-called
        witticisms. The audience exhibited commendable patience for
        upwards of an hour, as he drawled out his sentences,
        evidently waiting for an outburst of laughter between each.
        It was supposed that here was where the joke was intended
        to come in, but many failed to appreciate it. It was about
        the dullest entertainment ever given here. Although Mark
        Twain has written some very good things, as a lecturer he
        does not seem to be a success.</p>
