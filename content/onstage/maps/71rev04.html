          <b>MARK TWAIN ON ARTEMUS WARD.</b>
        </center><br />

        <p>Mark Twain, the celebrated humorist, delivered last
        evening, at Institute Hall, the first lecture of the
        "People's Course," to a good-sized audience. The subject
        announced was "Some Un-commonplace People I have Met"; but
        he opened his talk by saying that he had found it
        impossible to crowd any great number of people into his
        lecture, and therefore should lecture on Artemus Ward
        alone. Taking up Artemus, then, as a subject, he gave a
        sort of a sketch of his life as a fitting and convenient
        thread on which to hang the odd conceits, queer stories,
        and jokes which form the bulk of what he calls his lecture,
        generously attributing his own jokes to Artemus, and half
        the audience come away firmly convinced that they had read
        them in Artemus Ward's own works. The performance was an
        exceedingly pleasant one, Mr. Clemens having that air of
        quiet unconsciousness which seems inseparable from true
        humor, and his humor is as delicate and perfect as the
        perfume of some rare flower, whilst there was, we thought,
        a veiled sarcasm evident at times more just than generous
        to his pretended subject. We say again and, as Joaquin
        says, "we say it ever," that the talk was thoroughly
        enjoyable, but we fear that Mr. Clemens often veils his
        humor too closely for the easy recognition demanded by an
        audience.</p>
