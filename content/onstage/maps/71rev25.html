        <p>The matchless, indescribable, whimsical, and intrepid
        humorist yclept Mark Twain, stood up in Association Hall
        last night, and spoke his piece in the presence of a large,
        refined, and very appreciative audience, with the single
        exception of one young lady, who looked on mournfully while
        her neighbors were convulsed with laughter.</p>

        <p>Mr. Twain introduced himself, as is his usual custom,
        with a touching encomium upon his high moral, intellectual,
        and social qualities, being anxious, as he said, "to get in
        all the facts," which a stranger might not be able to do,
        however good his intentions might be. After reciting the
        cardinal and other virtues to which he laid claim, the
        lecturer proceeded to introduce his subject by describing
        his overland voyage to Nevada in a stagecoach, and his
        introduction to the manners and customs of the Territory.
        Particularly fine was his description of a horseback ride
        in the public square of Carson City, upon which occasion he
        learned something by experience which could never have been
        demonstrated by theory alone. Following this side-splitting
        recital, came a specimen of that exalted word-painting for
        which Mr. Clemens should not be less famous than for his
        wit; word-painting which marks him as one of the best
        descriptive writers of the age. His description of Lake
        Tahoe last night was indeed magnificent, and would have
        been applauded to the echo if the audience could have
        suppressed its apprehension that the description would end
        humorously.</p>

        <p>His description of Nevada, however, was not enticing to
        "actual settlers," but at the same time its grotesque humor
        was highly appreciated and the whole lecture abounded in
        telling hits, play upon words, and other promoters of good
        digestion in his listeners. It would be unfair, if it were
        possible, to print his jokes in connection with a review of
        his lecture, and the pleasure of laughing at them must be
        confined to those whose pleasure and good fortune it was to
        hear him last night.</p>
