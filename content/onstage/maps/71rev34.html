          <b>Twain Talk.</b>
        </center>

        <p>How ready the community are to wish to see and hear what
        they presume will be comical or laughter provoking, was
        illustrated last night. The Tabernacle was crowded with
        listeners to "Mark Twain's" lecture on "Roughing It." To
        call the discourse a lecture is a misnomer. Mark's talk is
        an odd compound of bits of information about Nevada, its
        soil, climate, natural features and the habits of its
        mixed, badly mixed, population, and of queer observations,
        sudden surprises, and old and new jokes. Mark is no orator.
        He don't pretend to be, but he is an amusing talker with a
        droll drawl, a nasal twang, and an indescrably odd fashion
        of "standing around" and moving his hands and his features
        as if he didn't know what to do with them. He is a mixture
        of Artemus Ward, Baron Munchausen and--Mark Twain, with
        Mark predominating. He made people laugh, and that was what
        he came for, but we would rather read his fun than have it
        from him by word of mouth. Before the lecture Mr. A. H.
        Lockwood, organist of Grace Church, gave some very fine
        music on the organ, which would have been much better
        appreciated if there had been less noise in the audience
        room.</p>
