          <b>MARK TWAIN AND CABLE.</b>
        </center><br />
        Every chair in Market hall was occupied last evening. The
        audience, fully half made up of ladies, was fairly
        representative of St. Paul culture. The occasion was the
        first appearance in St. Paul of Mark Twain, the humorist,
        and George W. Cable, the novelist, in their literary
        Siamese-twin act. Mr. Cable came on the stage first. He is
        a slight-built man, decidedly below the average in stature,
        has small, twinkling, brownish-black eyes, features almost
        femininely delicate, hair brushed carefully back from a
        square forehead of medium height, small, graceful hands,
        and last night wore a full, glossy black beard, with long,
        drooping moustache of the same color, and a dress suit.
        Several persons were entering the hall as Mr. Cable made
        his bow. He referred pleasantly to the chronic habit of
        late coming in theater-goers, but begged that the audience
        would try to devote a few moments from inspecting the
        costumes of the late comers to the speaker on the stage.
        Mr. Cable then read a chapter from his latest novel, "Dr.
        Sevier," throwing considerable expressive feeling into the
        delivery. The reading occupied about twenty minutes, and
        the audience applauded heartily. Mr. Cable bowed three
        times, and then made his escape to the rear of the stage
        with a peculiar, pigeon-wing kind of movement.

        <p>Two or three minutes later Mark Twain came on. The
        audience greeted him with a round of hearty hand-clapping.
        Twain wore his habitually tired, unemotional look, and
        received the applause as though it was something he had
        been accustomed to from infancy, but was obliged to endure
        politely. He stepped quietly up to the desk in the middle
        of the stage, placed his right hand upon it (the desk),
        shoved his left hand down into his breeches' pocket, on the
        left side, and looked as intensely weary as if he had just
        walked in from Milwaukee and had not had time to get
        anything to eat before coming on the stage. Any one
        ignorant of the humorist's identity would have taken him
        for one of the chief mourners at a well-regulated funeral,
        or a life-long victim of dyspepsia and melancholia, in the
        acutest forms. He began business at once. His voice was the
        same old, characteristic nasal drawl, in which the public
        refused to see anything eloquent, or even pleasing, when he
        essayed (unsuccessfully) to be a lecturer some ten years
        ago, but which is now accepted as almost as convulsive as
        the humorist's utterances themselves. Twain began last
        night by saying that the first number on the program with
        which his name was mixed up was a chapter from "The
        Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," a new infliction by
        himself. He went on to relate "King Sollermun," with which
        the public is already familiar from having seen the
        anecdote in print in the Century magazine and various
        newspapers. The audience laughed and laughed and applauded
        heartily again at the close of the reading.</p>

        <p>The other selections were: "Kate Riley, Richling, and
        Ristofalo," from "Dr. Sevier," by Mr. Cable; "Tragic Tale
        of the Fishwife," Mark Twain; Creole folk-songs, Mr. Cable,
        and the story of the "Woman With the Golden Arm," Mark
        Twain. The last named is a ghost-story, which Twain brings
        abruptly to a close by jumping toward the audience and
        crying "B-oo-o!" when the audience jumps, too, and then
        goes home in the very best of humor.</p>

          <b>AMUSEMENTS. Twain and Cable.</b>
        </center><br />
        &nbsp; The first appearance of Mark Twain and George W.
        Cable in readings at the Grand yesterday afternoon was
        fairly attended. The program was a rather varied one, and
        resulted in a most delightful entertainment. Mr. Cable gave
        some of his most spirited and characteristic selections
        from his best novel, and Mr. Clemens recited several
        humorous things, some new, some old, but all funny and
        giving more comic force from the quaint and droll manner in
        which they were delivered. Mr. Cable's work was largely in
        the line of Creole dialect, for which his very thin voice
        is well fitted. For his fifth number, however, instead of
        "Narcise Puts on Mourning for Lady Byron," which was put
        down on the program, he sang two creole songs. These songs,
        by the way, were exceedingly well taken by the audience,
        and called forth an encore. Mr. Clemens' selections were
        "King Sollermunn," from the "Adventures of Huckleberry
        Finn," "The Tragic Tale of the Fishwife"--a vastly funny
        burlesque on the queer genders of the German language--"A
        Trying Situation" and "A Ghost Story." The "Fishwife" was
        recalled, whereupon Mr. Clemens tried on the audience a
        little bit of stammering work that went very well. "The
        Ghost Story" was a good deal of a chestnut, but the
        ex-pilot did it admirably and there was a great shout of
        laughter when the disclaimer, at the end of his long and
        harrowing account, shouted "boo!" and the ladies of the
        audience jumped up and screamed in terror. The manner in
        which Mr. Clemens gets on and off a stage is a sight to
        behold. He starts on in a funny little jog trot, half
        sideways, with his eyes cast up to the gallery, with a
        comical look of half inquiry and half appeal. Then he
        begins to deliver his humorous conceits with an expression
        of placid and childlike innocence that is almost as
        ludicrous as the words he is uttering. His gestures are
        eloquent, if not graceful, and would make any audience
        laugh, even if Mark had nothing to say. With these
        accessories his oldest story becomes just as fresh as
        though it were "fire-new from the mint."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; The house was well filled in the evening. Mr. Cable
        opened the program with "Narcisse in the Inundation," a
        daintily humorous selection from Dr. Sevier, describing the
        creole's voyage in a canoe through the streets of New
        Orleans. Mr. Clemens followed with his "Desperate Encounter
        with an Interviewer," which is a desperately funny thing
        and kept the house in a continual roar. The next number,
        "The Sound of Drums," by Mr. Cable, was not so thrilling as
        some of his other selections, but was nevertheless well
        received. Perhaps the funniest thing of the evening was
        read by Mr. Clemens from the advance sheets of his new
        book, entitled "Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer's Brilliant
        Achievement" in releasing the negro prisoner, Jim, from the
        log cabin where he is incarcerated. Mr. Clemens was encored
        and read "Tom Bowlin's Encounter with the Governor of
        Massachusetts." For the fifth number, as printed on the
        program, Mr. Cable substituted a couple of songs in the
        Creole patois, which were singularly weird and pleasing,
        and received an encore. In his songs Mr. Cable's voice has
        much more volume than in his readings. Mr. Clemens' next
        selection was antediluvian "Jumping Frog," after which Mr.
        Cable repeated the thrilling story of "Mary's Night Ride"
        in a way that fairly stirred the enthusiasm of the house.
        The last number was Mr. Clemens' "Stammerer," which was
        also given in the afternoon.<br />
