        </center><br />
        &nbsp; The readings by Mark Twain and George W. Cable, the
        novelist, which had been looked forward to with such
        pleasure by Toronto people, were given in the Horticultural
        Gardens Pavilion last evening. Hardly a seat was left
        vacant. All the reserved seats were taken before the
        evening, and people were at the doors soon after seven
        anxious to be in time to get the best seats that were left.
        The entertainment was given under the auspices of the
        Ladies' Aid Society of the Metropolitan Church, which fact
        must have had something to do with making the audience so
        large. As might have been expected at such an
        entertainment, the people there were of the very highest
        class.<br />
        <br />

        <center>
          <font size="-1">THE SELECTIONS</font>
        </center>were chosen with good judgment, the efforts
        evidently being to take the latest pieces which could be
        read with good effect. If there was regret among some that
        Mark Twain did not give the fence white-washing scene in
        "Tom Sawyer," or the wonderful story of Jim Smiley's
        Jumping Frog, or the equally wonderful and almost equally
        funny story of Dick Barker's Cat, or any of a thousand
        other favourite pieces from other works, there was a
        measure of compensation in the presentation of two
        selections yet unpublished, and in the wonderful amount of
        fun which was shown to exist in two of the passages in "The
        Tramp Abroad." Mr. Cable read only from his latest work,
        "Dr. Sevier," except that for the third selection, instead
        of following the programme he sang some of the strange
        Creole songs, by which he is probably best known in
        Canada.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; The readers came on together, accompanied by ex-Aid
        Boustead, who was to introduce them. "Ladies and
        gentlemen," said Mr. Boustead, "allow me to introduce Mr.
        Cable" (applause greeting a small, slim man with a dark,
        short beard, tremendously long moustache, and dark
        schoolboy-looking hair) "and Mark Twain." (Loud and
        prolonged applause, acknowledged by frequent bows by the
        slim man of medium height, with a slight stoop, a fine
        face, adorned with a brown moustache, and surmounted with
        masses of dark, wavy hair, faintly tinged with gray.) Mark
        Twain retired and Mr. Cable opened the evening's
        entertainment by reading the scene between John and Mary
        Richling and the young creole, Narcisse. The scene shows at
        its best Mr. Cable's ability to write conversation so as to
        bring out character and at the same time to carry on the
        narrative. Mr. Cable has a good deal of dramatic talent,
        and with careful practice would read better than he does.
        His imitations of dialect are very good, his representation
        of the young Creole whose mother tongue, French, affects
        his pronunciation of English words, was very clever. Mr.
        Cable is most fortunate in having the power of interesting
        his audience in himself. His pleasant, unassuming manner on
        the stage made everybody in the audience his friend before
        he had spoken ten lines. Following Mr. Cable came<br />
        <br />

        <center>
          <font size="-1">MARK TWAIN.</font>
        </center>He was, of course, received with great applause,
        and for some moments could not proceed. When he did speak
        it was evident from the first word that the audience would
        enjoy his reading. After listening to him for five minutes
        one could be quite ready to accept as solemn truth the
        story he tells about his preparations for his first
        lecture, when he found a man who was led to laugh very
        heartily because of his (Mark's) "drawling infirmity of
        speech," as he calls it. It is not an infirmity but a
        peculiarity. His deep voice and his pronuncation of many
        words are of Missouri, where he was brought up, his nasal
        twang is of New England, where he has spent a good many
        years, and his drawl is of Mark Twain. Now and again he
        jerks a short sentence out with wonderful rapidity, but
        that over he relapses into his regular gait. He reads,
        however, with more care than is at first noticeable, and
        when he is imitating Huck Finn or the old negro telling a
        ghost story, his utterance changes enough to produce the
        impression he wishes to produce, but it is always Huck Finn
        or a negro who talks like Mark Twain. He is most at home
        when relating his personal adventures. When he is
        personating Mark Twain he does it to the life and is an
        immense success. Every word almost is a joke, every
        modulation of his voice shows new and unsuspected fun in
        writings that may have been read over a dozen times. During
        his readings the house was convulsed with laughter. There
        were times when all laughed together. There were times when
        one would see a joke before the others grasped it, and
        would guffaw aloud, then stop short, till half the crowd
        laughing at him and the other half at the joke would start
        off, and the pioneer laugher, reassured, would lead the
        laugh and keep it up for some seconds after the rest were
        quiet. When his audience laughed Mark Twain stopped with
        the air of a man who wished only to do his duty, and when
        they were quiet he resumed "with countenance grave as a
        horse's," as Will Carleton says. Mark Twain's first reading
        was prefaced with a few remarks. The remarks are given
        verbatim, and a portion of the selection is given also, as
        nearly as it could be heard and written. The reader
        said:--<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Ladies and gentlemen,--You find me appointed to
        read something entitled 'King Solermunn,' if it may
        strictly be called reading where you don't use any book,
        but it is from a book, an unpublished story of mine
        called<br />
        <br />

        <center>
          <font size="-1">'THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY
          FINN.'</font>
        </center>It is a sort of continuation, or sequel, if you
        please, of a former story of mine, 'Tom Sawyer.' Huck Finn
        is an outcast, an uneducated, ragged boy, son of the town
        drunkard in a Mississippi River village, and he is running
        away from the brutalities of his father, and with him is a
        negro man, Jim, who is fleeing from slavery, and these two
        are in concealment in a wood on an island in the
        Mississippi River. They can't venture to travel in the day
        time, so they bide during the day and travel at night, and
        they entertain each other with conversations sometimes
        useful and sometimes otherwise. The story is written from
        the mouth of Huck Finn. Jim is telling Huck about all
        manner of occult things, all manner of signs which show
        that bad luck will come to them. After he has exhausted a
        good many of them, Huck says:--<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Ain't they any good-luck signs?"<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "No; ain't no use in 'em. W'at you want to know when
        good luck coming? Want to try to keep it off? Only signs of
        any 'count is bad-luck signs. But dar's one good-luck sign.
        When a man's got hairy arms like a animal, dat's a sign
        he's goin' to be rich. Dat's a good sign."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Well, you got hairy arms. You ever been
        rich?"<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Yes, sir; I been rich once, an' I'll be rich agin.
        I had fourteen dollars, once, all at one time. Yes, seh.
        Any 'o de boys 'll tell you so."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "What did you do with it?"<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Well, I speck'lated wid it and got busted up. Yes,
        sir. I tuck an' put dat money inter live stock. I put ten
        dollars inter a cow and she died on my hands. Live stock is
        pow'rful resky."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Well, you lost ten dollars."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "No, I didn't lose it all, for I sole de hide and
        taller for a dollar and ten cents."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Well then what did you do? Did you speckilate
        again?"<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Well you might call it so."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; (Here followed a reference to some person evidently
        a friend of Jim, whose name the reporter did not catch.) He
        tuck in and started a bank, an' he sed--anybody put in a
        dollar he pay him four more at de end o' de year. Well, all
        de niggers went in. But dey didn't hab much. I was de only
        one dat had much, an' so I stuck out for more'n four
        dollars, an' I sed if he didn't gib it I'd take an' start a
        bank myself. Well, de fac' is dey warn't enough bisness for
        two banks. He knew dat, an' he knew he could clean me out.
        He sed I could put five dollars in, an' at de end o' de
        year he'd pay me thirty-five dollars. An' so I done it. Den
        I think I doan want dat thirty dollars lyin' still de whole
        year; I better take an' invest it, keep it moving. Dar was
        a nigger catched a wood flat floating down de river, an' I
        bought it from him and sed he could go an' get de thirty
        dollars at de end o' de year. Well, dat night somebody
        stole de wood flat, an' next day de bank busted, so we
        didn't any o' us get no money."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "What did you do with the ten cents?"<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Well, first I thought I'd spend it, but den I had a
        dream, an' de dream said to take and give de ten cents to
        dat nigger ----- (here occurred a name which sounded like
        Baalam) let him invest it an' make a rise for me, for he's
        mighty lucky. I gave de ten cents to Baalam, an' he was in
        church, an' while he was in church he heard de preacher say
        whoever gave to de poo' lent to de Lord, an' was bound to
        get his money back a hundred times. Well, dat looked pretty
        good, an' Baalam thought it looked pretty safe, an' he gave
        de ten cents to de poo', an' he laid low ter see what was
        gwyne to cum of it."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "What did come of it, Jim?"<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Nothin' ever cum of it. Nothin' ever cum of it,
        Huck. I cou'd never collect it no way."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Didn't you get the ten cents?" (The words of the
        answer were not distinctly caught, but they were in effect
        a negative.)<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "How do you put faith in the sign, how do you know
        you're going to be rich?"<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Well, you take a look at it--I'se rich now. I'se
        rich already. I run away. I ain't a slave no more, and I'se
        worth eight hundred dollars. In any market I'se worth eight
        hundred dollars. You knows dat, Huck said. I'se rich now,
        just de same as if I had eight hundred dollars exactly.
        Still, betwixt you an' me, I don't like it invested in dat
        way. My experience in live stock is resky; makes no
        difference if its in cows or niggers, its resky, an' I
        would feel much more easy if I had de eight hundred dollars
        an' somebody else had de nigger."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; The selection of which the above is a part, was
        received with loud applause.<br />
        <br />

        <center>
          <font size="-1">THE PIECE OF THE EVENING,</font>
        </center>however, was Mark Twain's description of his
        embarrassing position when a young lady whom he meets
        insists on talking about "old times," of which he remembers
        nothing. Mr. Cable's Creole songs were well given, and won
        well merited applause. In his closing piece, also
        describing the heroine's ride through the Confederate lines
        to her sick husband, he showed great dramatic power.<br />
        <br />

        <center>
          <font size="-1">AN INTERVIEW.</font>
        </center>&nbsp; After the performance, T<font size=
        "-1">HE</font> G<font size="-1">LOBE</font> reporter,
        through the courtesy of Mr. Pond, the manager of the party,
        had an opportunity of speaking with the entertainers of the
        evening. Samuel L. Clemens is a quiet, pleasant spoken man,
        but not "funny" in the ordinary sense of the word. He said
        it was quite true that he had been selected a member of the
        Montreal Snowshoe Club, and that he had been specially
        invited to attend the carnival, but feared that his lecture
        engagements would prevent his accepting the
        invitation.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "How do you reconcile this tour with your vow of
        which you have written that you would never go on the
        lecture platform unless driven there by want of bread?" was
        asked.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Well, I'd kept that vow so long--fifteen years or
        so--that I thought it time to break it and make a better
        one."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; Mr. Cable is by birth and life residence a New
        Orleans man. He has grown up in the midst of the scenes he
        pictures. It is only three or four years and after hard and
        weary work that he has succeeded in making for himself such
        a place in literature that he can depend upon his pen alone
        for his fortune. In conversation he is quiet, unassuming,
        and courteous, as courtesy is understood in the South. This
        is his first visit to Canada. Both authors are gratified
        with their reception.<br />
