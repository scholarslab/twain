          <b>THE TWAIN -- IN OTHER WORDS THE CLEMENS-CABLE
          COMBINATION.</b>
        </center><br />

        <p>The scene at the "front of the house" in Whitney's last
        night was enough to make glad the heart of a manager. The
        sharp cries of "one, two, one, three" of the head usher
        rang out as he turned the well-dressed stream in ones and
        twos to the under-ushers. He stood like a rock at the head
        of the centre aisle and the stream poured in on him. It
        surged around him, but calm and immovable he stood, and it
        broke around him. He utilized it and turned the steam into
        rivulets that trickled down the different aisles like the
        separate arms of the delta of the great river beside which
        the Twain authors won their fame. The stream went in
        graceful cascades down the steps of the different channels
        into the parquet and innundated it. The theatre was a sea
        of faces.</p>

        <p>The stage setting for this drama by two was of a nature
        calculated to inspire the authors with wonder at the wealth
        and splendor of Detroit interiors. Could Hartford insure a
        lovelier blue satin parlor suite? Could New Orleans exhibit
        a more gorgeous table-cover with a redder embroidered rose?
        The doors at the back were twain, and the lace hung in
        cables over the middle entrance.</p>

        <p>A man, whose shadow was now and then projected against
        the wings, snapped on the footlight gas. Then with a crack
        the overhead illumination flooded the stage with light, and
        a third thrill awaited the audience when the same invisible
        magician with the lightning touch sprang the big chandelier
        into a dazzling combination of jets. "It is like the
        President at Washington starting the exhibition in the
        South to-day," said a lady to her escort.</p>

        <p>These little electric excitements led up the audience to
        the event of the evening -- the entrance of the great
        American novelist, the humorist leading slightly, as they
        say in sporting circles. The sensation that had been caused
        by a brilliant-headed stage boy coming in and moving one of
        the blue chairs up to the footlights had subsided, and when
        the real actors came on there was a grand burst of
        applause. Mark Twain, drifting round the table to the
        front, leaving Cable kind of straddled on the other side,
        drawled out:</p>

        <p>"Lays sun gen'lmen, I introduce to you Mr.
        Caaa-ble."</p>

        <p>And with a wave of his hand he left his partner before
        the multidude, and retired R.E.</p>

        <p>Mr. Cable looked down into the empty orchestra and saw
        on the chairs where the fiddlers used to sit a motley array
        of overcoats and sacques that showed him plainly that he
        was not in the balmy climate of the sunny South. Then he
        lifted his face, and the audience got a good, square look
        at him.</p>

        <p>His make-up was good. The wrinkles on his brows looked
        for all the world as if he had been for years in constant
        surprise at his own success. His whiskers were long and
        pointed, and they ran up his cheek on either side until
        they met the smooth black hair. A person had the
        uncomfortable feeling that perhaps they were held in place
        by a string concealed over the top of his head, and that
        they might at any moment drop off. His moustaches were of
        the St. John (not the Evangelist, but the Prohibitionist)
        type, and their parted ends drooped down to a level with
        his pointed beard -- three peculiar points about Cable.</p>

        <p>He seemed just a trifle like a nervous man who had got
        his nervousness under pretty good control, but couldn't
        quite make up his mind whether it was better to keep his
        hands clasped behind his dress-coat, or in front of it with
        his thumbs up.</p>

        <p>The first Cable dispatch was that exquisite conversation
        between Narcisse and the Richlings, where the former tries
        to get John to "baw" him some of the cash Dr. Sevier has
        placed to the credit of the unfortunate couple.</p>

        <p>"I wuz juz coming at yo' 'ouse, Mistoo Itchlin. Yesseh,
        I wuz juz sitting in my 'oom afteh dinneh, envelop'in in my
        <i>'obe de chambre</i>, when all at once I says to myself,
        'Faw distwaction I will go and see Mistoo Itchlin.'" It was
        distraction indeed to the Richlings. He saw "Mistoo
        Itchlin" in every sense of the word, and "baw'd" the last
        cent he had.</p>

        <p>If Mr. Cable would come on the stage and sit down on the
        chair and have a good actor do the talking there might be
        some improvement. There was a touch here and there of
        amateurishness and a certain self-consciousness that rather
        interfered with the recital. Still, it is doubtful if any
        one could have given the Creole dialect as well as Cable
        himself.</p>

        <p>In retiring, amidst most enthusiastic applause, he took
        three backward steps, made a bow, three more, then another
        bow, three more, and out.</p>

        <p>There was no burst of music between the acts. The
        overcoats and things occupied the orchestra chairs with
        discretion and silence. This, of course, gave Mark a great
        advantage. The people were in good humor from the
        start.</p>

        <p>"Mark the Perfect Man," saith the quotation. For "man"
        read "humorist." Nothing could be more deliciously droll
        than his very movement toward that embroidered tablecloth.
        He came in with his head forward and looked like a man who
        had lost something on the stage and wasn't exactly sure
        that he would be able to find it. When he faced the music
        -- or rather the place where the music used to be -- he
        looked at the audience with a puzzled, half-careworn
        expression, as if he had met the people before, but
        couldn't just at the moment recall their names. His
        half-closed eyes appeared to peer out from under the bushy
        eyebrows with a puzzled gaze that had been regarding life
        seriously for forty odd years, and couldn't quite make it
        out. His bristly, plentiful hair was brushed back as if he
        had been born that way. It looked as if it never could
        become towsled up or come down over his eyes, and it was
        tinged with gray. It seems incredible that Mark Twain
        should ever have gray hair, but such are the
        indications.</p>

        <p>His left hand automatically sought his trousers pocket,
        and slid in there, leaving the thumb at liberty.</p>

        <p>He told his stories with that inimitable Down East drawl
        of his, and took his audience into his confidence with a
        serious unconventionality that was most delightful. When he
        got through he ambled off the stage with a little trot that
        was as funny as his altogether diffident entrance. He
        reminds one in his serious fun remotely of Raymond in
        "Mulberry Sellers." He also reminds you of someone you have
        seen before, you can't tell who, but you are friends with
        him, for old acquaintance sake, from the first. The
        audience laughed so heartily at his stories that laughing
        became a pain, and then, as Saxe says, "Cable like a
        poultice came, to heal the blows of Twain."</p>

        <p>The Creole songs that Cable sang in place of one of his
        recitations were enthusiastically encored.</p>

        <p>Mr. Cable should give up the funny business entirely to
        Twain. He should stick to the serious parts of his book
        with the exception of Narcisse, and let Mark bring the
        laughter. He is enough and several to spare.</p>

        <p>"Mary's Night Ride" was most graphically given by Mr.
        Cable. He brought the picture vividly before the eyes of
        his audience and held them spell-bound to the last word. It
        was the very perfection of intense word-painting. Still he
        should have shot that navy six a little quicker. The
        "once--twice--thrice" should have been given with every
        spring of the flying horse. "The tart rejoinders of his
        navy six" rang out in the night air, you may depend on it,
        Mr. Cable, as quickly as the brave spy could pull the
        trigger, and by the way, that sentence, "The tart
        rejoinders of his navy six," is one of the most graphic
        ever penned by the hand of man.</p>

        <p>Twain gave his version of the celebrated
        st---st---st---st--- whe-e-w-a--ammering story, which
        differs from that of Col. Sellers, and is infinitely better
        than Raymond's way of it.</p>

        <p>In conclusion it may be said that while the stage
        settings had somewhat of a sameness in them to a people
        educated up to the scenery of the "Silver King" and such,
        still the combination must save a good deal in baggage
        cars, and if we missed the background of the Alps while
        Twain was in his "Trying Situation," or "The Street in New
        Orleans" while Ristofalo was before us, we should remember
        that our loss was their gain. Taking it from first to last
        the Twain-Cable entertainment was by all odds the most
        enjoyable thing of the season, a sweet boon to the tired
        theatre-goer and a joy forever to the callous cynical man
        in the box office. When shall we, Twain, meet
        again?</p><br />

          <font size="-1">A PEN SKETCH OF THE LECTURERS AS THEY
          APPEARED LAST EVENING.</font>
        </center>&nbsp; Mark Twain and Geo. W. Cable gave their
        readings, or rather renditions, in alternate numbers to a
        full house at Whitney's last evening. Mr. Cable is a
        ministerial-looking person with very black hair, black,
        drooping moustache and full-pointed dark beard. His face is
        somewhat pallid, possibly by contrast with the ring of
        black hair surrounding it. His forehead appears to have
        been built in sections; this effect being produced by
        something about it suggesting that the hair has been shaved
        from the upper part. He is under the middle size and his
        dress suit of black covered about 150 pounds of activity.
        He was introduced by Twain, who then disappeared in the
        wings.<br />
        <br />

        <center>
          <font size="-1">MR. CABLE'S PERFORMANCE.</font>
        </center>&nbsp; Mr. Cable's gestures are finished to a
        point of naturalness that forbids the thought of study, and
        the tone of his voice resembles that of a woman. He is easy
        and natural in delivery, and in the first number of the
        series, taking the parts of Narcisse and John and Mary
        Richling in the scenes from Dr. Sevier, his transition from
        the male to the female voice and again to the broken
        English of the excessively polite and impecunious Frenchman
        not only brought out the lingual peculiarities of each, but
        were made without the least hesitation, a feat rendered
        more difficult by the interpolations explanatory of the
        situation. Sitting and standing, walking about and
        gesticulating, he was the character personated. In the
        courtship of Kate Riley and Ristofalo, the vivacity and
        impulsiveness of the voluble Irish woman, together with the
        female brogue, was neatly tongued and in an instant changed
        to the common-voiced brevities of the stolid Italian. He
        has also a good, strong and flexible voice in song, and the
        Creole ballads by turns uncouth, weird and plaintive, were
        sung effectively. Mary's night ride past the Confederate
        picket lines with the spy was handled so well that the
        actor was overlooked in the thrilling picture he
        presented.<br />
        <br />

        <center>
          <font size="-1">THE AWKWARD HUMORIST.</font>
        </center>&nbsp; When Mark Twain entered to give the advance
        sheets from "Huckleberry Finn," his gait resembled the
        motion of a tall boy on short stilts and he made his way
        around the table and approached the footlights. He was
        dressed in the conventional black suit, which is totally
        unsuited to the infinitely droll looking character enclosed
        within it. An extraordinary head of stiff hair of no
        particular color, but inclining to a bleached brick-dust
        shade, and which appeared to be perfectly independent of
        the large-sized cranium over which it hovered, had
        evidently been gone over a few times with a harrow to make
        the stubborn crop of hirsute delirium tremens stay down for
        a hour or two. And then the face was Yorick come again
        without a touch of paint but with the added drollery of
        generations of jesters. The low, square, wrinkled forehead,
        the face knotted with bumps of living fun, the short
        cropped military looking moustache, the eyes half closed
        and wearing an expression of doubt, as though their owner
        were balancing in his mind whether upon the whole he had
        better deliver the lecture or go to bed, made up one of the
        oddest looking faces ever worn by man.<br />
        <br />

        <center>
          <font size="-1">HOW HE ACTS AND SPEAKS.</font>
        </center>&nbsp; As for his complexion, it is doubtful
        whether any person present will ever remember what it was
        and it is possible he does not know himself. At some time
        in his life it was probably sandy, but his efforts in the
        way of eradicating the freckles, which report says once
        covered it, may have changed it to the neutral tint it now
        presents. His arms are somewhat short for his ample length
        and these are apparently as unmanageable for him as his
        hair. They are sometimes swung in front of his person and
        then left to dangle around at his sides--like a pair of
        government arms. Again one of them is spasmodically jerked
        to his forehead and the other follows about half way,
        giving the observer the impression that it is out of his
        power to move one without moving the other. Then the hands
        appear at times to move without an effort of his will and
        crawl into his pockets, from whence they are summarily
        pulled when it comes to the knowledge of the proprietor.
        His legs are tolerably well under control, but even those
        members of the animated joke at times show plainly that
        they are restive under restraint and would gladly return to
        the old days when their owner gave them a larger allowance
        of liberty. Twain finds his voice after a short search for
        it and when he impels it forward it is a good, strong,
        steady voice in harness until the driver becomes
        absent-minded, when it stops to rest, and then the gad must
        be used to drive it on again. Mr. Twain has a swan-like
        neck which his trick of throwing up his chin shows to
        advantage. It is as long as his shirt bosom and as white;
        but it is much thicker than a swan's.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; He is not completely successful and making a bow,
        and he trots off the stage seemingly delighted at the
        prospect of being so much nearer to the end of the
        entertainment.<br />
        <br />

          <b>THE FUNNY MEN IN BED.</b>
        </center>

        <center>
          <font size="-1">A "POST" REPORTER DISTURBS TWAIN AND
          INTERVIEWS CABLE.</font>
        </center>&nbsp; Messrs. Clemens and Cable arrived in the
        city yesterday afternoon and registered at the Russell
        house. They had not long been in their rooms, 26 and 24,
        when a P<font size="-1">OST</font> reporter called to
        interview the celebrated humorist. Pretty soon the door was
        opened an inch or two, and the well-known face of the
        humorist appeared in the opening. The white covering which
        enveloped his neck and shoulders created a suspicion in the
        reporter's mind that the author of "Innocents Abroad" was
        in his night-shirt, and further investigation disclosed the
        latter to be the case.<br />
        <br />

        <center>
          <font size="-1">TWAIN VERY SLEEPY.</font>
        </center>&nbsp; "Hello. Glad to see you. Can't ask you in,
        though, as I'm just going to bed."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "I will only detain you a few minutes, Mr. Clemens,"
        apologized the reporter.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "I want to go to sleep. You'd better come around
        after the lecture. By the way, the P<font size=
        "-1">OST</font> is a good paper. I read an excellent
        article on copyright the other day which was taken from
        your paper."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "I would like to ask you a few questions regarding
        your opinions on copyright privileges," remarked the
        writer, who began to imagine that he had gained the
        humorist's attention at last.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "As Mr. Cable. He knows all about copyright.
        Whatever he says you can put in my mouth and I'll be
        responsible," replied the literary hero with a tremendous
        yawn.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "But it won't take you five minutes to answer my
        questions."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Too sleepy. I feel the yearning for slumber here,
        "and he tapped his forehead. "If I don't get it now I won't
        get it at all. Interview Cable in the meantime, and come
        around and see me after 10 this evening."<br />
        <br />

        <center>
          <font size="-1">MR. CABLE'S VIEWS.</font>
        </center>&nbsp; Mr. Cable was an interested listener to the
        foregoing dialogue, and expressed his willingness to be
        interviewed. He appeared to be the least sleepy of the two,
        although evidently preparing for bed also. Finding further
        persuasion useless, the humorist was left to the embrace of
        Morpheus, and proceeding with Mr. Cable to the latter's
        room the reporter had an interesting interview on the
        subject of copyright law, or rather the absence of it. Mr.
        Cable's views on the subject, which were vigorously
        expressed from beneath the quilts, will appear in
        to-morrow's P<font size="-1">OST</font>, lack of space
        prohibiting their publication to-day.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; Mr. Clemens was again seen by a reporter late last
        night in the Russell house billiard room. He had just
        defeated his business manager in two games of billiards and
        was in high spirits in consequence.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Have you visited Detroit before within recent
        years?" he was asked.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "No. I think it is about fifteen years since I was
        here. Sorry I hadn't time to-day to look around the see the
        city. Mr. Cable and myself were tired out and had to sleep.
        By the way, your city is beautifully lighted with those
        electric towers. It is the handsomest-appearing city at
        night that I have seen."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "I presume your present tour gives you relaxation
        and rest from literary labors?"<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Yes, it does. It is a rarity after many years of
        close literary work at home."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "What kind of audiences have you been receiving
        lately?"<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Very good indeed. We have every reason to be
        satisfied."<br />
        <br />

        <center>
          <font size="-1">MARK'S LATEST FAREWELL.</font>
        </center>&nbsp; "Have you re-entered the lecture field
        permanently?"<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "No. This is my last season. At least I regard it as
        such, and have no doubt that it will be such."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Do you consider the eastern or western states the
        better field for lecturers and readers?"<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "I can't recognize any difference. We have had very
        large audiences in the eastern cities, and in the West
        there is no perceptible decrease except when there is a
        snow storm."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Is the American taste for humor still growing, in
        your opinion?"<br />

        &nbsp; "Yes, I think so. Humor is always popular, and
        especially so with Americans. It is born in every American
        and he can't help liking it."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Is it true that the American style of humor is
        becoming very popular in England?"<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "Yes. The liking for American humor over there has
        become immense. It wakens the people to a new life, and is
        supplanting the dry wit which formerly passed for humor.
        American humor wins its own way and does not need to be
        cultivated. The English come to like it naturally."<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "How about the newspaper humorists? Has the American
        press not become the popular vehicle for humor?"<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; "It has, undoubtedly. Newspaper paragraphing is
        comparatively new to us, even, and has met with
        well-deserved popularity. It is one of the achievements of
        the age."<br />

        <p>The "Mark Twain"-Cable readings drew a large audience to
        Whitney's last night, a good proportion being composed of
        those who enjoyed the readings of the two authors here in
        December last. Of the two Mr. Cable is not near as good a
        raconteur as Mr. Clemens, although he assumes much more of
        the manner of the professional elocutionist. Mr. Cable's
        selection most pleasing and most applauded was "Mary's Last
        Ride," which was narrated in a graphic manner. He sang,
        too, the negro boat and love songs admirably. "Mark
        Twain"--he should petition the legislature to legally
        entitle him to wear his nom de plume for every day use--has
        that peculiar sense of humor so dear to the American heart,
        which finds expression in the wildest flights of mendacity,
        or in a gentle burlesquing of the truth. His manner
        heightens the effect of everything he says, because it
        seems to be utterly unfitted for public readings, and yet
        it is thoroughly artistic, and entirely appropriate to
        whatever character he represents as speaking.</p>
