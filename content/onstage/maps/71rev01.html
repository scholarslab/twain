        <p>T<font size="-1">HE</font> L<font size=
        "-1">ECTURE</font>.-- Samuel L. Clemens, otherwise "Mark
        Twain," of "Innocents Abroad" notoriety, held forth last
        evening in the Moravian Day School Hall, under the auspices
        of the Winter Evening Entertainments Committee of the Y. M.
        C. Association of Bethlehem. His subject was "Reminiscences
        of some Uncommonplace Characters I have chanced to meet."
        As everybody knows, Mark Twain has traveled a good deal,
        and has met a great many people; and he has a happy way of
        telling about them in writing; indeed, "Mark Twain," as a
        writer, is a great success. As a lecturer, we feel bound to
        say that, though not an entire failure, he is far from
        being instructive in his remarks or entertaining in his
        manner. His lecture is made up almost entirely of humorous
        incidents which he has narrated in his "Innocents," and
        which everybody who would be likely to attend a lecture has
        read; and we don't think Mark added anything to them, in
        point of fact, by the manner in which he "got them off"
        verbally. He told the Roman mummy story, the Christopher
        Columbo story, and so forth -- and didn't tell them well.
        But everybody wanted to see "Mark Twain," and they
        <i>saw</i> him; (but only a small portion of the audience
        heard him, because he spoke in such a low tone of voice;)
        and with that sight most of them were satisfied --
        ourselves included. We had never seen Mr. Clemens; we
        wanted to see him; we knew that good writers seldom make
        good lecturers; we were willing to pay the price of
        admission to see him, even if it had been announced that he
        would mount the platform to be looked at, and would not
        open his mouth to speak. So we were all satisfied, but not
        instructed nor exactly entertained. In short, if we went to
        hear "Mark Twain" lecture, we were disappointed; if we went
        to see the author of "Innocents Abroad," and to hear him
        talk in the familiar, dry way which is his peculiarity, we
        were satisfied, pleased, delighted. It is probable that the
        majority of the audience was of the latter class.</p>

        <p>The audience was one of the largest which has ever been
        collected under one roof in Bethlehem, and the members of
        the Entertainment Committee, as a matter of course, wore
        very smiling faces in consequence. The best and biggest
        part of Bethlehem's intelligent population were present. It
        was a most pleasant occasion, of a kind which should be
        greatly multiplied in every community.</p>
