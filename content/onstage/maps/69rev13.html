        <p>"M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size=
        "-1">WAIN</font>" delivered the opening lecture of the
        Young Men's Christian Association Course, on Wednesday
        evening last, in Armory Hall. He was introduced by himself,
        and his lecture "was intensely interesting to those who
        were interested." We are of the opinion of our young friend
        Crowninshield, at No. 3 Almy's Block, who is the sole agent
        for North Providence for "Mark's" new book, that "he is a
        <i>fair</i> lecturer, but he writes much better than he
        talks."</p>
