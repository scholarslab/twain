        <p>T<font size="-1">HE</font> L<font size=
        "-1">ECTURE</font> delivered by "Mark Twain," last evening,
        attracted an enormous multitude to the Academy of Music, in
        spite of bad weather. The lecture was devoted to "Artemus
        Ward," and was full of illustrations of his humor. It kept
        the vast audience in a continual laugh, until the closing
        passage, which was full of pathos. "Mark Twain" is not an
        orator, but his manner is agreeable, and those who have
        enjoyed his writings were not disappointed either in his
        appearance or his lecture. The next lecture of the Star
        Course will be delivered on Thursday evening, by Hon. E.
        Jay Morris, his subject being "Turkey." There is probably
        no man living so well qualified to speak on this topic, Mr.
        Morris having lived nine years in the country, and informed
        himself concerning it thoroughly.</p>

        <p>This formed the title of the lecture delivered last
        evening at the Academy of Music, by Mark Twain. Despite the
        inclemency of the weather the house was densely crammed; in
        fact, it contained the largest audience ever assembled
        within its walls to listen to a lecture.</p>

        <p>Those present had evidently come to hear something good
        and quaint. In this they were not disappointed. Just before
        the lecturer was introduced, Mrs. Susan Galton Kelleher
        sang "The Skylark" sweetly, and received an encore. Upon
        the conclusion of this the lecturer came forward and
        said:-- . . .</p><br />

        <p>The lecturer traced at length the career of the great
        showman and lecturer through America and England, relating
        a number of his favorite and amusing anecdotes. A beautiful
        tribute was paid to the deceased humorist.</p>

        <p>Throughout the entire lecture the audience was kept in a
        continuous roar of laughter; and, if Artemus Ward could
        create fun for the million, as stated by the lecturer, the
        latter certainly demonstrated his ability to do the
        same.</p>

        <p>Despite the inclement weather an immense audience
        assembled last evening, at the Academy of Music, to hear
        America's humorist par excellence, Mark Twain, deliver his
        new and peculiarly delicious lecture, entitled
        "Reminiscences of some uncommonplace characters that I have
        chanced to meet." Not only was every available seat --
        clear up to Paradise -- occupied, but benches and chairs
        placed upon the stage gave accommodation to more than a
        hundred enthusiastic individuals, who had consented to
        adopt the theatrical profession, and "appear upon the
        boards," for the sake of hearing the great lecturer. As
        usual, the music for the evening, "The Skylark," Benedict,
        was sung by Mrs. Kelleher, accompanied on the piano by Mr.
        Pearce, and was excellent. As an encore the talented
        songstress gave a very effective rendering of "Charlie is
        me Darlin'."</p>

        <p>At the conclusion of the singing, the lecturer appeared,
        being greeted with rounds of applause. Mr. Clements stood
        quite still for a few moments, gazing vacantly around the
        house, much as if he expected to see a long-lost
        grandmother amidst the audience. Apparently not finding the
        ancient relative, he coughed modestly, and said in a nasal
        voice which from its twang was of itself amusing: . . .</p>
