          <b>Review of Mark Twain's Lecture.--<br />
          Respectfully Dedicated to those People who admire
          Gough<br />
          and can't bear Independent Criticism.--</b>
        </center>

        <p>Mark Twain lectured at Institute Hall last evening. At
        an early hour the intelligent, virtuous, high-minded,
        patriotic and well-dressed people of this enterprising and
        lovely village might have been seen wending their way to
        the Hall, &amp;c., &amp;c. The Hall was well filled, all
        the seats that were occupied being crowded. As Mr. Byron
        (whom some of our readers may remember sometimes made up
        verses out of his head), once said, "the lamps shone bright
        o'er fair women and brave men and all went merry as a
        marriage bell." (Lest any one should take offense however,
        we explain that the Hall was <i>not</i> lighted with
        "lamps" but with gas, manufactured by our intelligent,
        efficient and high-minded Gas Co. Bryon is to blame for the
        word "lamps" in this quotation, not we. We hope this
        explanation will prevent the Gas Co. shutting off our gas
        again, or any one else being offended and stopping his
        paper.) The <i>elite</i> of this place was assembled,
        &amp;c., &amp;c. It is rarely seldom that so select an
        audience fills Institute Hall. The lecturer no doubt felt
        highly honored and flattered at his reception, &amp;c.,
        &amp;c.</p>

        <p>Of the lecture we need say nothing, &amp;c. Mr. Twain
        spoke for himself, &amp;c. We only need say that it was
        fully up to expectations, and exceeded the anticipations of
        the most sanguine and skillful anticipatist in this
        section. While we do not wish to wound by harsh criticism,
        we have no hesitation in saying and we say it boldly that
        this lecture gave entire satisfaction to that numerous
        class of our readers who like that kind of a lecture.
        Still, we may be mistaken in this opinion and if so we are
        willing to be corrected; we trust that like Mr. Heap we are
        "umble" and would not venture to make so broad a
        declaration as the above without offering to take it back
        if it did not prove satisfactory to the intelligent readers
        of our widely-circulated and influential J<font size=
        "-1">OURNAL</font>.</p>

        <p>We cannot better and less offensively sum up the merits
        of this delightful, beautiful, eloquent, grand,
        extraordinary, lovely, forcible, convincing, pious,
        exciting, splendid lecture than in the one word with which
        the fascinating and fashionably-haired young lady so fitly
        described Niagara Falls--<i>pretty</i>. It should have been
        heard to be appreciated, &amp;c., &amp;c. Time and space
        will not allow us to say anything about the lecture here
        and at this time. We leave that disreputable task to the
        heartless wretch who so audaciously refused to admire the
        transcendant merits of Gough's temperance lecture and walk
        around. Those of our citizens who did not attend missed a
        rare treat. (Lest our temperance friends should be offended
        we explain that "treat" here does not refer to anything
        ardent.) Mr. Twain entered fully into the spirit of his
        performance. (Our readers who tie to spiritual
        manifestations will take no offense at the word "spirit;"
        it is not used in a supernatural sense.) To say this
        lecture was well received is only the naked truth (no
        offense meant to our lady readers by the term here applied
        to truth.) Mr. Twain's lecture should be in every library,
        and on every centre table, and on every faro table, and
        every bar, and in every livery stable, and in all other
        places which deserve mention here; we hope we shall not be
        deemed invidious in not naming them all.</p>

        <p>We should be guilty of the blackest hearted ingratitude,
        sacrilege, and inattention to a blessed institution did we
        neglect to introduce in this connection a silver-plated
        puff on the Y. M. C. A., and the managers of the lecture
        course. By bringing Mr. Twain here they have conferred a
        great benefit on our people, have given the prosperity of
        the place a substantial boost, have placed us under renewed
        obligations to them, &amp;c., &amp;c. The citizens will
        hold them in grateful memory and future generations will
        inscribe their names</p>

          By carrying Sheridan into the fight<br />
