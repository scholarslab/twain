        delivered the second lecture of the Clayonian course last
        evening, in the Opera House, to a very large and attentive
        audience. His subject was "Brother Jonathan Abroad." He
        explained, by way of introduction, that while the educated
        Americans who travel abroad are accustomed upon their
        return home to write descriptions of their journeys for the
        benefit of their friends and to moralize in books and
        lectures upon what they have seen, the "Vandal" (and he
        desired to be respectful in the use of the term, which he
        interpreted to mean those travellers whose pockets were
        heavier than their store of learning or historical
        research), had no such opportunity for a multiplicity of
        reasons, the chief of which was a want of early education.
        He therefore volunteered to be their historian, having been
        a close observer of their habits.</p>

        <p>The lecturer then described in a most humorous manner,
        the ramblings of the "American vandal," what he saw and how
        he was impressed by the exhibitions of ancient grandeur or
        influenced by old historical surroundings and associations.
        In the course of his remarks he painted in glowing language
        and with choice words scenes of cities and places and of
        statues and paintings, that will be slow to fade from the
        memories of the audience. Chief among them were
        descriptions of Venice, of Athens by moonlight from the
        Acropolis, of Damascus, the most ancient metropolis, of the
        Sphinx, which has looked upon thousands of years of history
        with its stony eyes yet reveals nothing, and of the picture
        galleries of Rome and Milan. These were clothed in the
        beautiful rhetoric of poetry in prose. In the humorous
        parts the speaker resembled Artemus Ward in his slow and
        quaint way of saying very amusing things. The audience was
        constantly convulsed with laughter, and was continued in
        its happy humor by quiet touches of wit and sentiment.
        Altogether it was a most enjoyable evening's
        entertainment.</p>
