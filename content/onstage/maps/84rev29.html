          <b>"TWAIN" AND CABLE.</b>
        </center><br />
        The Twain-Cable combination was greeted last night by the
        largest "downstairs" audience that has assembled in the
        Opera House this season, and it is safe to say that few
        audiences have congregated there composed of more
        intelligent and cultivated people. The entertainment was
        all that was promised, and the audience testified their
        delight by numerous bursts of laughter and applause. "Mark
        Twain's" first peek-a-boo at R.1.E. was greeted with
        laughter, and his droll recitations of his own funny
        stories tickled his hearers prodigiously. Mr. Cable's
        readings were so unlike Twain's stories that a pleasing
        contrast was formed. His selections from his own novel,
        "Dr. Sevier," were given with wondrous grace and effect,
        captivating the audience and winning genuine applause. His
        graphic description of "Mary's Night Ride" was realistic in
        the extreme, while Twain's final effort, a ghost story, was
        impressive as well as vehemently ludicrous. The combination
        is a strong one, and with a good management, "there is
        millions in it" for both the actors and their manager.
