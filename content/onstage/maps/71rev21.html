          <b>MARK TWAIN.<br />
          His Lecture on Artemus Ward--A Budget of Humor.</b>
        </center>

        <p>An unusually fine audience assembled at Union Hall,
        Wednesday night, to hear Mark Twain's new lecture on
        Artemus Ward. Promptly on the hour, Mark shambled out on
        the stage, gazing intently on an open watch, which he held
        in his hand about as gracefully as he would his "jumping
        frog." He bowed to the audience, and then stood perfectly
        still for about five minutes, as though waiting for a
        sufficient supply of words to commence his speech with.
        Finally he spoke, and in a nasal voice which from its twang
        was of itself amusing: . . .</p><br />

        <p>Mr. Clemens is a very slow speaker, and one of the
        easiest to report we ever listened to; but his tones are
        rather monotonous and tiresome. Unlike Mr. Brown, whom he
        was lecturing upon, his speeches read better than he
        delivers them. For this lecture, which took an hour and
        fifteen minutes for delivering, Mr. Clemens received $125
        -- or nearly two dollars per minute.</p>
