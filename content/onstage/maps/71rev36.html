          <b>Mark Twain in the Lyceum Course.</b>
        </center>

        <p>Mr. Samuel L. Clemens, better known to the public as
        Mark Twain, gave the second lecture in the Lyceum course,
        last evening. The reputation of the speaker as a humorist
        drew a large audience, who were in a mood to accept and
        appreciate any effort in that direction. Mr. Clemens is a
        slenderly built man, of about thirty five years, with a
        sad, almost sorrowful face, overshadowed by a mass of
        strong black hair, and to look at him as he came forward on
        the platform and leaned upon the desk, looking intently
        from point to point in the hall, as if searching for some
        one, and occasionally shading his eyes with his hand to
        assist his vision, he seemed much more like a melancholy
        searcher for that which was lost, than a funny man. He
        silently held his position and attitude of intense interest
        for some minutes, and then he said in a slow, hesitating,
        measured manner, and a monotonous tone, "Ladies and
        Gentlemen: I have the honor to introduce to you as the
        lecturer of the evening, Mr. Clemens, otherwise 'Mark
        Twain,' whose varied accomplishments, extensive learning,
        and historical accuracy, are equalled only by the modesty
        of his demeanor, and the sweetness of his disposition. He
        said he was the lecturer, and he chose to introduce himself
        rather than to leave it to another, if it must be done at
        all, because then he was sure to get in all the facts. The
        effect of the introduction was more in its manner than its
        matter. It was entirely characteristic, and no one who
        heard it and had read "The Innocents Abroad," and could
        appreciate them, could doubt that they came from the same
        author.</p>

        <p>He proceeded to say that he intended to speak of half a
        dozen people, but had found the time too short; so that in
        fact he could get one person into the hour only by
        "crowding him some," and the introduced the one he had
        selected, "Artemus Ward," Mr. Charles F. Browne. He gave an
        interesting sketch of his boyhood and education, of his
        sudden success before the public, piecing out the rather
        meagre array of facts with anecdotes of different eras in
        Mr. Browne's life, told in an inimitable manner, just like
        the speaker's story of his visit to the relics of
        Christopher Columbo and the grave of Adam, and delivered in
        so deliberate a manner that every hearer could take in
        every point.</p>

        <p>He said the first indication of the wit of Artemus was
        manifested at an early age. He with a young companion had
        acquired a passion for playing euchre, and indulged in the
        pastime in secret out of the way places, in fear of the
        strict and pious people with whom they lived. They had
        difficulty in hiding their cards, and at length put them in
        the pocket of a long black gown which hung in a closet, and
        appeared to them never to be used. But unfortunately it was
        the baptizing gown of a Baptist minister, and the next
        Sunday, in the presence of a large audience, he went into
        the water to immerse a convert. As the two walked out into
        the stream some of the cards floated out of the pocket and
        rose to the surface, face upwards -- two bowers and three
        aces. The lads got well switched for their part in the
        affair, but an old lady tried to touch their hearts by
        pointing out the mortification and shame of the minister at
        such things being found in his pocket. "Why, boys," said
        she, "I should think he would have fainted and drowned; I
        can't imagine how he ever got out." "I don't see how he
        could help going out, on such a hand as that," was the
        quick and ready reply of the embryo humorist. This was his
        first witticism, but Browne didn't see in it the foundation
        of the fame which the future had in store for him. At 16
        years of age he went to Boston, to set type on the "Carpet
        Bag," to which "Mrs. Partington," "Miles O'Reilley," and
        John G. Saxe were contributors, and here he began to write.
        The speaker related the leading points in his career from
        this point, with which the public are familiar, and also
        gave an analysis of "Artemus Ward," the man of the "moral
        wax works," the creation of Mr. Browne's genius which gave
        him the name by which he is most familiarly known. At every
        point there was apparent the unintentional mirth of the
        speaker, not in his manner, for that was as sad and grave
        as could be, but in the odd groupings of ideas, and in the
        singular form of expression which fell from his lips. He
        told a pathetic story of the long struggle with disease,
        the physician standing behind the scenes with remedies to
        ward off a mortal stroke, while Mr. Browne made fun for the
        people of London, and of his death and burial. Here, said
        he, his lecture might well stop, but he would tell a story
        of a friend of his own who had much of the same humor which
        had made Mr. Browne so famous, and which might as well
        perhaps be told of him, as many that are generally received
        as genuine.</p>

        <p>This friend's strong point was an aptness of quotation,
        which seldom left him at fault. On one occasion a colored
        woman employed next door to where the speaker and his
        friend boarded, who had served the same family long and
        well, fell upon the stove while getting an early breakfast,
        and was roasted to a cinder. The landlady of the two
        friends was a woman of large sympathies, and at the
        breakfast table told the story, how the old servant had
        been so faithful and serviceable, and how sad it was that
        she should die in so terrible a manner. She said that she,
        herself, would like to erect a monument over her remains,
        and asked the man of quotations for an appropriate line for
        an inscription, and without a moment's hesitation he
        replied, "well done, good and faithful servant."</p>

        <p>This closed the lecture, and the audience dispersed, the
        greater number sadly in doubt whether they liked it or not.
        They thought it was rather thin, but then, it would not
        have been funny if it had been thick, and on the whole,
        calling to mind one after another the bright points which
        had found a lodgment in their memories they concluded that
        they did like it.</p>
