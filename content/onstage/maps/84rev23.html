          <b>The Twain-Cable Entertainment</b>
        </center><br />
        Mark Twain, the great humorist and George Washington Cable,
        the popular novelist, were greeted by a large and
        enthusiastic audience at the opera house last night, and a
        better pleased people never sat through a two hours'
        entertainment of any sort, in the uncomfortable seats of
        the old hall. The character of the entertainment, as
        announced, was readings by the two gentlemen from their own
        and latest works. M. Cable appeared first, a man of small
        stature and quite slender, in fact quite ordinary looking
        in every respect, and with a voice of the high tenor pitch,
        but clear, ringing, and rather pleasing in quality,
        introduced himself, made a few sarcastic comments about the
        late comers to the entertainment, begging those who were in
        their seats to go at least one eye on him, with
        superintending the seating of the tardy ones with the
        other, and having placed his hearers on good humor from the
        start, proceded to recite a chapter from his novel, Dr.
        Sevier, personating three characters in very acceptable
        style. After he had retired with the approval of the
        audience, Mark Twain sauntered upon the stage in his easy
        careless manner, with a grave look upon his countenance,
        and as he stood for a moment glancing sidewise at the
        audience, of course there was a general outburst of
        laughter from all parts of the house. After it had subsided
        Twain proceded in his dry, comical way to recite from his
        latest work, "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," and kept
        his listeners in a roar all through. His appearance and
        style is directly the opposite of Cable's. Tall, somewhat
        angular, with a shock of grizzly hair covering a large
        head, a smoothly shaven face, with the exception of a gray
        and stubby mustache under a large Roman nose, and over a
        wide ranging mouth, with a voice low and guttural in tone,
        a serious, solemn look ever resting upon his features, he
        is the embodiment of all that is droll and laughable. The
        witty things in his writings, over which so many thousands
        have shed tears of laughter time and time again, sound all
        the more comical when repeated by the author in his
        inimitable style. During the evening he told his story of
        trying to master the German language, doing his trip
        abroad, his adventures with Harris in Switzerland, the
        stuttering yarn, and wound up with the old darkey ghost
        story. Mr. Cable also appeared in other selections from his
        novel, Dr. Sevier, and displayed a very fine musical taste
        and a sweet voice by singing two old Creole songs. His last
        selection, "Mary's Ride," a thrilling discription of an
        adventure of a southern woman during the late war, was his
        best effort of the evening, and was given in a decidedly
        dramatic style that called forth the most enthusiastic
        applause.
