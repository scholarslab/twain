          <b>His Lecture on Artemus Ward -- A Quaint Affair -- What
          One American Humorist Thinks of Another.</b>
        </center><br />

        <p>At eight o'clock last night Plymouth Church was full of
        the usual Beecher people, all ready for smiling enjoyment,
        and all convinced that the greatest intellectual treat of
        the season was forthcoming. A little after eight the
        Intellectual Treat appeared casually in the shape of a
        young man with reddish hair and a reddish mustache. The
        young man was attired in evening dress. His swallow tales
        were of orthodox fashion, but well sat upon. His pantaloons
        had the gloss of respectable middle age. His linen looked
        as neat as that of Mr. Beecher himself.</p>

        <p>Entering upon the stage with a careless slouch, as much
        as to say, "Here I am, by the Grace of God and the American
        people, humorist," he was greeted by terrific applause. The
        audience recognized their Intellectual Treat at once, and
        they went for him.</p>

        <p>"My, what a handsome young man to be a lecturer!"</p>

        <p>"He's married over three millions of money, and lectures
        for fun."</p>

        <p>"So he ought, if he's a funny lecturer."</p>

        <p>"He isn't a bit funny now he's married."</p>

        <p>"He's got a baby and that takes all the humor out of
        him."</p>

        <p>Volleys of missiles such as these were discharged
        against Mr. Twain, <i>sotto voce</i> last night.</p>

        <p>By and by he launched himself in the current of his
        discourse and slowly paddled his facetious canoe from eight
        o'clock till ten, or thereabouts. The voyage was chiefly
        one of anecdote, Mr. Twain premising that though he had
        promised to talk of<br /></p>

        <center>
          <font size="-1">SEVERAL DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE</font>
        </center>he would under the circumstances confine himself
        to Artemus Ward whom he pronounced America's greatest
        humorist. He stated that he would forego criticism upon the
        subject, but would confine himself to Artemus Ward's
        biography. His description of Charles F. Browne was not
        very complimentary inasmuch as he described his hair as a
        divided flame and his nose as a cowcatcher.

        <p>He alluded to the Pilgrim Fathers, from whom Ward
        descended, with marked disrespect and intimated that one of
        these ancestors of his own had taken three sides in the
        Battle of Bunker Hill -- or words to that effect. He
        promised to enter upon a long and minute description of his
        own family, but on witnessing the restiveness of the
        audience under this threatened infliction, he changed his
        mind and heroically forbore from doing so. His biography of
        Artemus Ward was perhaps remarkable rather for unaccuracy
        and inventive power than for strict historical truth, but
        he fibbed with such unction that the congregation -- beg
        pardon audience -- listened to the sermon with their
        sweetest Sabbath smile.</p>

        <p>The anecdotes were some of them old and some of them
        new, one or two having evidently a more ultimate relation
        to Mr. Samuel L. Clements than to Mr. Charles Farrar
        Browne. They were all good, however, and the man who went
        empty and rueful away must have a very diminutive sense of
        the ridiculous.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, Mark Twain pathetically alluded to the
        death of Artemus Ward, expressing himself with exquisite
        taste. This portion of his lecture bore evidence of the
        ripe scholarship and genuine feeling which underlie the
        humorous surface of Mark Twain's character. The lines,
        quoted, we believe, from <i>Punch</i>, in testimony to the
        geniality of his deceased fellow spirit, were rendered with
        remarkable power.</p>

        <p>On the whole, the lecture, which was actually nothing
        but a discursive and pleasant bundle of stories, bound
        together by a cord of quaint fancy, heartily pleased the
        audience, who frequently testified, by their applause and
        their laughter, the satisfation he had occasioned.</p>

          <b>MARK TWAIN ON ARTEMUS WARD.</b>
        </center><br />

        <p>Plymouth Church was crowded last evening, on the
        occasion of Mark Twain's lecture, by an audience who from
        the first manifested that they had come with the
        determination of being amused, and who at the close went
        away with the happy consciousness of having effected their
        object very satisfactorily. Mr. Clemens made his appearance
        on the platform shortly after 8 o'clock, and was received
        with enthusiastic applause, which was renewed at brief
        intervals throughout the evening. The subject of the
        lecture was "Artemus Ward," a genius whom Mr. Clemens
        evidently appreciated and admired. There was much in the
        style and manner of Mr. Brown as described and illustrated
        last evening that could be distinctly observed in the
        lecturer himself, whose own genius appears to be very
        closely akin to that of his lamented subject, while at the
        same time it is entirely original and genuine.</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens' lecture, so far as it can be produced
        without the important accessories of his quaint, apparently
        unconcerned manner and comical drawling tone, was
        substantially as follows: . . .</p>
