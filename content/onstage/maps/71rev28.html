          <b>Lecture of Mark Twain.</b>
        </center>

        <p>Mark Twain lectured to a fair audience in Arcadome Hall
        on last Saturday night. Failing to make connection at
        Crestline he hired an engine to bring him to Wooster. He
        introduced his subject, "Roughing It," by a very humorous
        description of his trip from Crestline to Wooster. The
        gentleman from Wooster, of regal appearance, who
        accompanied him and is said to have palmed himself off as
        the Grand Duke, enjoys the joke immensely, but denies its
        foundation in fact.</p>

        <p>The lecture abounded in humorous and graphic
        description. It was just such a production as might have
        been expected from the author of "Innocents Abroad." Twain
        undoubtedly possesses a high faculty of vivid and lively
        description.</p>

        <p>The Rev. O. H. Tiffany will lecture on Tuesday, the 16th
        of January. Subject: "An Hour with Washington Irving."</p>

        <p>This will be the third visit of Dr. Tiffany to Wooster.
        His great reputation as a polished orator will doubtless
        call out a large audience.</p>
