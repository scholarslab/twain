        <br />
        Samuel M. Clemens, familiarly known as Mark Twain, arrived
        in Cleveland yesterday afternoon on his lecture tour around
        the globe. He was accompanied by Mrs. Clemens and their
        daughter, and by his manager, Major J.B. Pond and wife. Mr.
        Clemens and his party took rooms at The Stillman, and as
        Mr. Clemens is suffering from a very painful carbuncle on
        his leg he spent much of his time in bed. He bore his
        affliction with surprising heroism, however, and even
        consented to half a score of interviews in addition,
        without so much as complaining.

        <p>"So far as Joan of Arc is concerned," he said, when
        asked about the authorship of the memoirs now being
        published in Harper's Magazine, "I have been asked that
        question several times. I have always considered it wise,
        however, to leave an unclaimed piece of literary property
        alone until time has shown that no one is going to claim
        it. Then it is safe to acknowledge you wrote that, whether
        you did or not. It is in this way that I have become
        recognized and respected as the author of 'Beautiful Snow,'
        'Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep' and other literary
        gems."</p>

        <p>When asked how he came to take the nom de plume of Mark
        Twain he said that that well known equivalent for "two
        fathoms" on the sounding line had been used as a nom de
        plume for a few marine notes furnished a New Orleans paper
        by the oldest captain on the river -- Isaiah Sellers. "When
        the word came out to Virginia City that Sellers was dead,"
        said he, "I did not think it would be much of a crime to
        rob that corpse of that nom de plume, and I did so."</p>

        <p>Mark Twain, the American humorist, stood before an
        immense audience in Music hall last evening and
        demonstrated his latest scheme for the moral regeneration
        of the human race. The speaker appeared in this city over
        ten years ago and the decade has wrought great changes in
        his appearance. His immense shock of hair has turned nearly
        white, but his humor is just as vigorous and his style as
        entertaining as ever. Mr. Clemens has been ill for several
        weeks and his appearance last evening was almost on the eve
        of his long contemplated tour around the world by way of
        Australia. His lecture was given for the benefit of the
        News-boys' home.</p>

        <p>Mark Twain's theory for the moral regeneration of the
        race is sensationally unique. He proposes that man shall be
        guilty of the entire category of crimes and misdemeanors,
        thereby gaining impressions of wickedness which he will
        never forget, and by the experience thus gained he will
        shun wickedness. The audience became convulsed when the
        speaker deliberately assured them that he had passed
        through two-thirds of the crimes of which the human race is
        capable and that he hoped in a few more years to complete
        the list and reach the stage of perfect moral manhood. His
        matter of fact manner in reaching startling conclusions is
        one of the chief powers of the great humorist.</p>

        <p>The effort of Mr. Clemens was preluded by two very
        pleasing violin solos by Fiora Drescher of New York and a
        couple of flute solos by Mr. Dewey Haywood of Chicago.</p>

        <p>Miss Drescher is a very beautiful woman, with large,
        dark eyes and dark hair. She plays with a great deal of
        expression and feeling. Her violin is over a hundred years
        old and has been owned by Remenyi, Ole Bull and Camilla
        Urso. Mr. Haywood is the husband of Miss Drescher. They
        were married three weeks ago today in Chicago. Mr. H.J.
        Kroessen of this city was accompanist.</p>
