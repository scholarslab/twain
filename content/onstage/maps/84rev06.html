        "Mark Twain" and George W. Cable alternately appeared on
        the platform of Congregational Church last night. As soon
        as one bowed his exit the other ran up the steps, not
        because they were in a hurry, as the former explained, but
        because the programme was long.

        <p>Mr. Cable was the first to appear, and was greeted with
        applause. He is of medium height, slender, with a jet black
        silky beard, and his dark eyes sparkle with intelligence.
        His rich and melodious voice rises to a high falsetto in
        its portrayal of female character. In his opening selection
        he impersonated Narcisse, John and Mary Richling. One
        forgot the speaker and saw John, grave and quiet, and Mary,
        "pushing her small feet back and forth on the floor,"
        listening to the delightful accent and original philosophy
        of Narcisse, as he sat twitching uneasily in his chair,
        with his mind fixed on "that fifty dolla" which he "could
        baw from Mistoo Itchling." Afterwards it was Kate Reilly,
        with her smirking and her brogue, who called Ristofalo "a
        desaving crature," while the stumpy, honest Italian
        answered, "Dat's alright," and putting his arm around her
        called her "Kate" to her outward astonishment but inward
        delight; or, later, the audience followed Mary and little
        Alice and the spy in their lonely midnight ride through
        forest roads and across cold streams until they reached the
        road. How vividly the picture was drawn! and then, when the
        soldiers sprang up in the road and there was the gleam of
        carbines and the sound of firing, how one's heart throbbed
        when the baby cried "Mother," and Mary whispered to it and
        lashed her horse in the same instant, while the spy
        heightened the dramatic action by his shout of victory. In
        his songs, too, Mr. Cable touched the audience, and the
        weird, beautiful music gained for him hearty applause.</p>

        <p>As for "Mark Twain," Father Time has no mercy even upon
        a professional mirth-provoker and has plentifully sifted
        his hair and heavy drooping moustache with fine white
        powder. His face is as clean cut as cameo. He speaks in a
        sort of mechanical drawl and with a most bored expression
        of countenance. The aggrieved way in which he gazes with
        tilted chin over the convulsed faces of his audience, as
        much as to say, "Why are you laughing?" is irresistible in
        the extreme. He jerks out a sentence or two and follows it
        with a silence that is more suggestive than words. His face
        is immoveable while his hearers laugh, and as he waits for
        the merriment to subside, his right hand plays with his
        chin and his left finds its way to the pocket of his pants.
        Occasionally the corners of his mouth twitch with inward
        fun, but never is a desire to laugh allowed to get the
        better of him. These characteristics agree so well with his
        description of himself in his books -- Innocence victimized
        by the world, flesh, and Devil -- that one cannot fail to
        establish the resemblance and laugh at the grotesque
        image.</p>

        <p>"Mark Twain," for it does not seem natural to call him
        Mr. Clemens, first recited from the advance sheets of "The
        Adventures of Huckleberry Finn." This classic was an
        account of King Sollymun, his wives, wealth and wisdom. It
        was down in the Mississippi Valley. Huck Finn, a white boy
        who was maltreated by the old man, ran away with Nigger Jim
        from the plantation and camped out in the woods. Their
        conversation was about kings. Jim wasn't familiar with
        kings. The only kings he knew anything about were the four
        kings in a pack of cards. Then Huck told what he knew about
        kings in general and "Sollymun" in particular. To his
        youthful mind they were persons who got $1000 per month,
        went to war occasionally, but "as a general thing they hung
        around a harem." Jim was disposed to question "Sollymun's"
        wisdom in cutting the disputed child in two. In vain Huck
        told him he did not understand the case. "It was all on
        'count of his raising," said Jim. "He had about five
        million children. Take a man with two or three. Is he gwine
        to be wasteful of children like dat?"</p>

        <p>Twain once went to Germany and wrestled with the
        language of that country. "There is one disease," he told
        his audience, "which is sure to affect everybody at some
        time or other during his life, and that is the disease
        which prompts a man to learn a foreign language." The
        audience guessed what was coming, and laughed. "I escaped
        that infection," continued the speaker, in deliberate
        drollness, "for a long time, the major part of my life, in
        fact; but I did not escape it entirely. I had learned a
        smattering of Chinese, one or two Indian dialects and some
        other kindred classic languages, but nothing serious. The
        serious part came later. I went to Germany two years ago,
        with an evil instinct that I could learn the German
        language. I know better now. [Laughter.] I went to work at
        it, worked hard and hopefully, fought a good, honest fight
        with it, but the German language has been in the business
        longer than I have [laughter] and it came out ahead." Then
        the audience laughed again, and when the speaker continued
        to relate his struggles with the nouns and adjectives, and
        his acquaintance with a dissipated student of Heidelberg,
        who said he "would rather decline four drinks than one
        noun," his hearers shook with visible emotion. All this was
        by way of prelude to the "Tragic Tale of a Fishwife,"
        wherein English words were given the same gender as if they
        had been German, the result being a comical mixture, absurd
        in the highest degree.</p>

        <p>A ghost story ended the programme. The voice in the
        whistling wind moaned, "Who's got my golden arm?" and the
        figure came up the stairs and bent over the stingy husband.
        "You've got it," it cried, and the audience jumped. That
        was the finale.</p>

        <p>To-night the President will be present.</p>
