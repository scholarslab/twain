        <p>W<font size="-1">ELL</font>, Mark Twain has been here
        and lectured. Seldom, if ever, was a larger audience
        assembled in the Opera House than on Tuesday night last.
        Everybody had heard of Mark Twain. A great many had read
        some, if not all, of his writings, and the mere mention
        that he was to lecture created a rush for seats, and at an
        early hour the Opera House was pretty thoroughly crowded.
        About eight o'clock he made his appearance upon the stage,
        walking with a loose, shambling gait, and an inconceivably
        awkward manner. In personal appearance he is not very
        impressive, but looks thin and weazened, as if he had grown
        up amid the sand and alkali of Nevada. His head is rather
        large, and covered with bushy, bristling hair, and
        ornamented with a peaked nose and a pair of small,
        twinkling eyes. Well, as we said before, he lectured, or
        pretended to lecture is a more appropriate way to
        characterize the effort, for no man not insane enough to be
        a fit candidate for a lunatic asylum, or who meant to be
        sarcastic, would dignify the performance by calling it a
        lecture. His manner and style of delivery were those of a
        very poor clown. Some words he would drawl out, while he
        would jumble others together in a way out of place anywhere
        else than in a circus. His command of language was poor, he
        using but two words to express the merits of the thing he
        was describing:--"magnificent and common-place." Everything
        was either "magnificent or common-place." At his appearance
        upon the stage, and at the opening of his piece, the
        audience, who had come to be entertained, laughed heartily,
        but in a few moments the laughing was confined to the boys.
        Whenever he said anything he thought was witty, he always
        kindly stopped to give the audience a chance to laugh. This
        was very thoughtful in him, for, if it had not been for
        that, more than half the time they would have failed in
        discovering the place where the laugh came in. His
        anecdotes and witticisms were mostly old and stale. His
        description of how a man weighed a ton has been gotten off
        by every clown in every circus for the last ten years, as
        has his "good place for hunting," and his offer to "bury
        with pleasure."</p>

        <p>His main forte is his extravagance, and in that he falls
        far below J. Proctor Knott, who excels him in extravagant
        and absurd descriptive powers as far as an ocean steamer
        does a tea-pot in motive power. In good part, his wit was
        of a low order, both as to quality and matter, and his
        account of life in Washoe was neither moral, elevating or
        instructive. He talked for an hour, and the audience went
        away disappointed and dissatisfied. Of one thing, however,
        they were abundantly satisfied, that, as a lecturer, Mark
        Twain is a "magnificent" fizzle, or a first-class humbug.
        The object and aim, we believe, of the two Christian
        Associations of this city, is to improve and elevate the
        moral and intellectual tone of society, and not merely
        money-making. In all candor we would ask if such lectures
        tend to thus elevate and refine? Does his picturing of Jack
        Harris, with his coarse allusions, and his buffoonery
        benefit the people? If not, then, in the name of society,
        let us have no more such performances under the auspices of
        the Christian Associations.</p>
