        <p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size=
        "-1">WAIN</font>.-- An immense audience assembled at
        Wieting Opera House last evening to make the acquaintance
        of this celebrated humorist. Mr. Clemens's subject was
        Artemus Ward. His tribute to the genius and untimely end of
        the genial proprietor of the "great moral wax figgers" had
        at times a touch of geniune pathos while at the same time
        it was replete with humorous anecdotes concerning the
        lamented Artemus and quotations from his writings. Mark
        resembles the subject of his lecture in one respect -- his
        pauses are more eloquent than his words. As it is
        impossible to report a pause, while to leave out these
        "brilliant flashes of silence" would be to spoil the
        lecture, we shall not attempt to reproduce it. The audience
        was quick to see the places where the laugh came in, and
        responded unanimously. They were not, as the lecturer
        promised they should not be, loaded down with historic
        facts to such an extent that they couldn't get home, but
        all carried with them, we have no doubt, the impression of
        having had some of the cobwebs shaken out of their
        brains.</p>
