        <p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN AS
        A</font> L<font size="-1">ECTURER</font>.--To say that the
        audience that listened to Mark Twain's lecture, at the
        Metropolitan last night, was well pleased would be saying
        what every man and woman present will attest; but every one
        would also say that those two words are so far from
        properly representing the pleasure afforded, that in their
        very tameness they seem to underrate its real value. It is
        so common now-a-days to apply high sounding adjectives to
        all manner of entertainments, whether of merit or not, that
        we avoid their use in noticing the lecture of Mark Twain,
        in order that it may not be ranked by our readers along
        with the very "flat, stale and unprofitable" productions,
        that pass under ponderous adjectives for lectures worth
        hearing. The impression made on the hearer by the first few
        sentences of the lecturer is anything but favorable. There
        is in the careless and effortless manner of dropping words
        as though they rolled from the speaker's mouth half moulded
        as it were, and the lazy roll of the head, a strong
        indication that he is to be bored by a commonplace recital
        of incidents of travel abroad, interspersed with a few
        jokes that would be much more enjoyable in print, than as
        mumbled by the speaker. The awakening from this error comes
        so suddenly, so thoroughly, and so pleasantly too, that
        from this point to the close of the lecture, the doubter at
        first, is a willing and delighted captive; drinking in
        every word, gliding with the lecturer among the thousand
        gondolas floating on the water ways of moonlit Venice,
        laughing at his proofs that the girls of Venice are like
        the girls of Indianapolis, answering with applause that he
        would not if he could withhold the thrilling and
        surpassingly beautiful descriptions of Athens by moonlight,
        of the cathedrals of Milan, and Rome, and St. Petersburg;
        and then again laughing himself into tears over the
        peculiarly happy of the bold, unceremonious,
        care-for-nothing, rollicking conduct of the American
        vandal, who never fails to make known his nationality,
        whether in stocking feet inspecting the interior of a
        Turkish mosque, among thousands of worshipping Moslems,
        attending the <i>fetes</i> of Emperors or autocrats,
        rambling among the grand and inspiring ruins of Athens, or
        whistling a national air as he views the towering Pyramids
        of Egypt.</p>

        <p>Mark Twain's wit is always of the highest order, and the
        more enjoyable in that it so truthfully hits off some
        peculiarity of human nature. His descriptions of scenery,
        in a literary point of view, glitter with the polish of
        culture, and captivate by the beauty and smoothness of the
        verbiage. His reading of the descriptive passages is
        peculiarly adapted to the display of their beauties. He
        reads as one who is not laboring to convey the impression
        that he is saying something beautiful, but as one who is
        laboring rather to convey to the hearer a correct idea of
        the beauties that impressed him. The reader of his prose
        would discover in it the music of poetry; but as he reads
        it, it has all <i>that</i> charm, and the additional
        interest that a story has, coming from the lips of one who
        saw whereof he speaks.</p>
