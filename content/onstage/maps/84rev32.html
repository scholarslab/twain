        </center><br />
        The literary event of the season was the entertainment
        given at the Opera House last evening, by "Mark Twain"
        (Samuel L. Clemens) and Mr. George W. Cable, the
        distinguished Southern novelist. There was a good audience,
        considering the prevailing chilliness of the atmosphere,
        and it was made up largely from the reading and thinking
        portion of the community. Mr. Cable was first on the
        programme, and his appearance was the signal for applause.
        He is a man about forty years of age, rather short and
        slender, with thick, black hair, combed slick, a long
        black, silky beard, and heavy drooping moustache, a bright,
        penetrating eye, a countenance denoting intelligence, a
        pleasant voice, and the gestures and movements of a
        polished gentleman. Mr. Cable's readings, or more properly
        recitations, were from his novel of "Dr. Sevier." In his
        first effort he sustained the characters of John and Mary
        Richling and Narcisse, where the latter attempts to "baw"
        fifty dollars from John and his wife.<br />
        <br />
        "Mark Twain" followed Mr. Cable, and was enthusiastically
        received. He came onto the stage with his head protruded
        forward, one hand in his pocket, and his every movement was
        indicative of the droll humor that was fairly bubbling out
        of him. He is tall, awkward, with heavy, bushy hair,
        slightly tinged with gray, a heavy moustache, drooping eye
        brows that almost covered his half closed eyes, and he
        drawled his words out after the style of a genuine
        "down-easter." His first selection was from the advance
        sheets of his new book "The Adventures of Huckleberry
        Finn," and told what he knew about Kings in general, and
        "King Solermunn" in particular. He put his audience in good
        humor with the first sentence and it continued until the
        last. He never smiles when telling a story that causes his
        audience to laugh until the tears trickle down their
        cheeks, but on the contrary, pulls his iron gray moustache
        and scowls. Stories that would fall flat when told by other
        lips than his kept the audience in a constant roar. His
        "Tragic Tale of the Fishwife," in which he relates his
        experience with the genders while endeavoring to learn the
        German language, and "A Trying Situation," which was one of
        his best efforts, in which a gentleman does not recognize a
        lady who recognizes him is mystified by her questioning him
        about a fictitious past in what she calls a "delightful
        talk about old times," was true to life and furnished no
        end of amusement. Mark responded to only one encore and
        then gave his stammering story with electrical
        effect.<br />
        <br />
        Mr. Cable substituted a Creole song for one number on the
        programme, and proved himself not only a good elocutionist
        and a man of literary ability, but possessed of a sweet,
        clear voice. He was loudly encored, and responded with a
        wild and weird dancing song. The courting scene between
        Kate Riley and Ristofalo, the Italian, was a splendid piece
        of work, but his last effort, "Mary's Night Ride," was a
        grand piece of word painting, and one of the best
        selections of the evening. His description of that
        thrilling ride through the Confederate lines, held his
        audience spell bound, and although Mr. Cable is hardly
        heavy enough for the part, he does his work very
        creditably. "Mark Twain" closed the evening's entertainment
        with one of his characteristic ghost stories, which was
        very startling to say the least, and was told in his
        inimitable style.<br />
        <br />
        The form of the entertainment is new and novel, and the two
        gentlemen who are presenting it, have leaped into public
        favor almost instantaneously. They are both stars of no
        little magnitude in their specialties, and wherever they go
        they will be gladly welcomed.
