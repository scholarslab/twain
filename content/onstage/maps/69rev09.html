          <b>MARK TWAIN.<br />
          "Our Fellow Citizens of the Sandwich Islands."</b>
        </center>

        <p>Samuel L. Clemens, better known perhaps as Mark Twain,
        the humorist, lectured in Union Place Hall, West Troy, last
        night upon the above interesting topic. Mr. C. came hither
        under the auspices of Roy steamer company, and was greeted
        with a full house. The lecture gave a world of
        satisfaction. Those who went to laugh were abundantly
        satisfied; those who went from any other cause must have
        been likewise well pleased, for notwithstanding some things
        that are repulsive about them no one can fail to like "our
        fellow savages." Mr. Twain is a man about thirty-five or
        forty years of age, somewhat tall and spare-built, and has
        the regular Western knack of telling a story. Next Winter
        Mark must make his bow to a Troy audience. We present a
        brief report of the lecture below: . . .</p><br />

        <p>The lecturer here closed his address by thanking his
        audience for their attention and wishing them a very
        pleasant good night.</p>
