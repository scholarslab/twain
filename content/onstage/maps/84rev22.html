        Mark Twain and George W. Cable appeared at the Academy of
        Music last night in the presence of a small but delighted
        audience. The programme was made up of selections from the
        writings of the two well-known authors. Mr. Cable's
        readings were from his recent novel, Dr. Sevier, and were
        listened to with the greatest interest. Mr. Cable has a
        clear and distinct voice and speaks with almost painful
        slowness, putting a careful emphasis on each syllable and
        apparently weighing well all his utterances. He does not
        possess a commanding stage presence, nor is his voice
        particularly strong, yet the modesty of his demeanor makes
        a good impression and he makes friends as he proceeds. With
        Mark Twain it is different. The celebrated humorist is no
        less modest than his younger confrere, but he is more at
        home on the stage. He walks on with a careless shambling
        gait, tells the most uproariously funny stories in his
        inimitable way, without the faintest shadow of a smile
        crossing his countenance, and retires with the same air of
        careless indifference. His selections from the advance
        sheets of his new story, "The Adventures of Huckleberry
        Finn," were heartily received, but it was not until he gave
        his "Tragic Tale of a Fishwife," leading up to it with an
        exquisitely humorous description of the difficulties he
        encountered in an attempt to master the grammar of the
        German language, that the audience fully appreciated his
        quaint drollery. The laughter was incessant and it
        increased in force as he graphically described his meeting
        with an acquaintance whom he had forgotten, but who
        remembered him. His terrible mental agony was depicted with
        all the force of the genuine humorist, and drew forth roars
        of laughter. Mr. Cable rendered a number of Creole songs
        and recited "Mary's Night Ride" with remarkable dramatic
        intensity. Before commencing the recitation he said that
        the story of the life of <i>John</i> and <i>Mary
        Richling</i> had been told him by a friend. <i>Mary's</i>
        home had been in Milwaukee, and it was to Milwaukee she had
        come in the midst of her trouble, leaving her husband to
        battle so manfully alone in New Orleans. It was from
        Milwaukee she started out so bravely to reach her husband
        in the trying times of the war. He had looked forward to a
        visit to the city which had been the home of his heroine,
        with a hope that he might grasp the hand of that noble
        woman. Following is the programme for to-night:<br />
