        <p>Every one who went to Music Hall last evening--and there
        was a good house despite the mist and mud--expected to go
        home splitting their sides with laughter. People everywhere
        are familiar with "Mark Twain," but comparatively few have
        yet had an opportunity of seeing Mr. Samuel H. Clemens. An
        hour with Mark is like gentle dew upon a withering flower;
        when he lifts the curtain and comes as Mr. Clemens, the
        lecturer, it is like the tickling of a sleepy boy with a
        feather--perfectly ravishing until the eyes are opened, but
        which he doesn't care to experience a second time. Mr.
        Clemens is a true wit, with his pen, and his works will
        live after he has gone, but his course as a lecturer will
        end when the curiosity of his thousands of readers shall
        have been satisfied by a good square look at him. His
        lecture on "Our Fellow Savages of the Sandwich Islands," is
        a tissue of nonsense from beginning to end, and his
        delivery is as disgusting as the lecture is foolish. Still,
        people clamor for a look, and we are inclined to think one
        dose will be enough for the most admiring. The audience
        last evening enjoyed, not the hearty laugh they
        anticipated, but a protracted, vexatious titter, and felt
        relieved when the end came.</p>
