        One of the largest and it is certain, the most appreciative
        audiences of the season assembled last night to hear the
        readings of "Mark Twain" (S.L. Clemens) and George W.
        Cable. The constant and convulsive laughter of the audience
        displayed that it needed no extra effort of these
        well-known authors to hold their listeners' attention.
        Their selections in themselves did that. The inimitable
        sketches of Mark Twain and their equally mirth-provoking
        author, combined with the bright and spicy extracts by Mr.
        Cable from his "Dr. Sevier," made an entertainment that
        would be hard to be equaled. Everything they gave was so
        original that it would be a difficult task to decide which
        should claim the greatest merit.

        <p>The "Tragic Tale of the Fishwife" by Mark Twain probably
        occasioned the most laughter, and as its vein of fun is of
        a character that has been pronounced to be beyond parallel,
        it deserved all the applause it gained. The house was
        filled with the best of Columbus people, and the gentlemen
        who entertained them should recognize the decided
        compliment thus conveyed.</p>
