          <b>Mark Twain in Kalamazoo.</b>
        </center>

        <p>Union Hall was crowded, the body of the house, galleries
        and aisles all filled, Saturday eveningby an audience
        gathered from neighboring towns, as well as Kalamazoo, to
        listen to Samuel L. Clemens' (better known as Mark Twain)
        lecture on "Artemus Ward." No lecturer that has visited
        Kalamazoo, unless Gough be excepted, ever drew together a
        larger or more cultivated audience, and no lecturer, we
        regret to say, ever more completely disappointed his
        hearers. The substitute for a lecture which Mr. Clemens
        foisted upon his audience was an insult to their
        intelligence and capacity. We have no ill-will toward Mark
        Twain. On the contrary, we attended the lecture very
        friendly disposed, have read his writings with pleasure,
        and regard his "Innocents Abroad" as containing more real
        humor than any book ever published in America. But we are
        compelled to pronounce his performance Saturday evening an
        imposition on both the Young Men's Library Association and
        the audience who listened to it. This is not Twain's first
        season on the lecture platform. Heretofore he has
        demonstrated his ability to give instructive and
        entertaining lectures, but in resorting to such a makeshift
        as we heard Saturday night he is guilty of obtaining money
        from the Society and the public under false pretences.
        Capable of furnishing a good lecture, Mr. Clemens had no
        right to impose upon his hearers any such desultory trash
        as they were subjected to. They had a right to expect
        something worth coming to hear, and if he is too lazy or
        unmindful to do justice to himself or an audience he ought
        not to lecture at all. He should have given the lecture he
        contracted to deliver, or something equally good, in its
        stead, and not put us off with a rambling, disconnected
        talk about a hackneyed subject, <i>sans</i> wit,
        <i>sans</i> information, <i>sans</i> sense. It is the duty
        of the press to expose such impositions, and if other
        journals remain silent, we shall not.</p>
