        &nbsp; A brilliant audience gathered last evening at
        Mercantile Library Hall to hear "Mark Twain" and George W.
        Cable read selections from their own writings. Mr. Cable
        cleverly opened the entertainment by introducing himself in
        an off-hand way and by giving a passage from Dr. Sevier,
        which introduced the creole Narcisse and John and Mary
        Richling. Mr. Cable made a fine impression at the start,
        and it increased throughout the performance until it became
        warm enthusiasm at the close. He gave altogether three
        readings from Dr. Sevier and several songs illustrating the
        music of the creole negroes in New Orleans, which were very
        fine and gained him immense applause. "Mark Twain" gained
        the audience over at the start. His recitals of selections
        from "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," "The Tragic Tale
        of the Fishwife," in which he comically illustrated the
        vagaries of the genders in the German tongue, "A Lying
        Situation" and his "Ghost Story" were inimitable. His
        quiet, deliberate, solemn manner, and the humor, not only
        of the readings but of his delivery, kept the house in
        roars of laughter. Every point was made to tell and not one
        was missed. As a whole, it was the most enjoyable
        entertainment of the kind ever given here. The same program
        was repeated this afternoon, but a <a name="a" id="a">new
        one</a> will be given to-night.<br />

        <p>Mark Twain and George W. Cable entertained about 700 of
        their admirers in Mercantile Library Hall last night. They
        gave recitals of selections from their respective work,
        Mark Twain having four pieces on the programme and Mr.
        Cable the same number. Cable chose passages from his novel
        <i>Dr. Sevier</i>, in which he aimed to illustrate the
        characters of Narcisse, the Creole, Kate Riley and Mary
        Richley. All his recitals were successful in pleasing the
        audience, and before the evening was at an end the author
        of <i>Creole Days</i> was a strong favorite with all
        present. Mark Twain did not fail, however, to hold his own.
        He kept the assemblage in excellent humor with his literary
        surprises, and in the "King Sollemun" passage from
        <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, the "Tragic Tale of a Fishwife,"
        he which he illustrated the reckless distribution of
        genders among the nouns of the German language, and in the
        other selections he tickled the risibles of the audience to
        an extent that satisfactorily established the popular
        quality of his humor at least. Mr. Cable is quietly
        dramatic in his manner, and has a pleasant, pliable voice.
        His dialectic efforts, too, are very fair. Twain's voice
        has the resonance of a cracked steamboat whistle. He
        enunciates slowly, gesticulates with his head, and keeps
        either hand in a pants pocket during his stay on the stage.
        Last night's programme will be repeated this afternoon, and
        tonight new selections will be given.</p>

          <b>'MARK TWAIN-CABLE.'</b>

        <p>"This literary conspiracy," as Mark Twain describes the
        entertainment given by Mr. George W. Cable and himself, is
        really a very novel and agreeable affair. The idea of an
        author reading selections from his own works is not a new
        one, to be sure; Dickens introduced it many year ago, with
        pronounced success, and others have since adopted it from
        time to time, with results of various kinds. But this is
        the first case, we believe, in which two authors have
        "joined teams" for reading purposes; and certainly no two
        more widely-read and popular current writers, and yet two
        writers more distinctly unlike in their literary methods
        and their personal characteristics, could easily be brought
        together as a platform attraction. One is blunt, audacious
        and strongly individualized; the other is delicate,
        decorous, and not at all self-assertive except in the sense
        of aiming to do well what is put before him. They appeal to
        an audience in ways entirely different, just as they are
        known to write from entirely different points of view; and
        not the least interesting feature of the entertainment is
        the chance it affords for noting the shifting and denoting
        manner in which their recitations--for they recite almost
        all their "readings"--are received in turn by their
        hearers. One compels outright laugher, while the other
        seldom achieves more than smiles and a light murmur of
        gratification. Those who applaud the one do not always
        applaud the other; and yet it is hard to tell at the end
        which has seemed to make the surer impression, so much
        depends upon the fact that they must be judged together to
        be judged definitely.</p>

        <p>The first thing, perhaps, which strikes the observer as
        to Mr. Cable is his small stature. There is an impression
        somehow that a man who writes big book should be physically
        commanding, though there is no logic in such a thought; and
        Mr. Cable is remarkable rather for being diminutive than
        surpassing in that respect. He does not come up to the
        ordinary standard either in height or bulk, but is
        noticeably short, thin and light in movement, and at first
        glance just a trifle disappointing. It does not appear
        quite reasonable that a man so daintily constructed can be
        the author of those vigorous and powerful stories of Creole
        life. His head is a good one, however, and his face radiant
        and assuring. It is not what would be called a handsome
        face; it is too pallid, and it is whiskered out of proper
        proportion, and the long mustache has a tendency to twitch
        after a fashion that makes it too obviously superfluous.
        Mr. Cable is a Southern man, but he does not show it in any
        way. He looks more like a Jerseyman, and still more like an
        average New Yorker of sedentary employment and severe
        social tastes. Even his voice is not Southern; but it is
        very clear and pleasant, and his enunciation is more than
        usually distinct. He goes about his work with a relish that
        is infectious, as if he really believed in the characters
        and scenes which he portrays; and it is quite evident that
        he has carefully studies all the means by which character
        is to be specified and picturesque circumstances made vivid
        and impressive.</p>

        <p>Mark Twain, on the other hand, very nearly realizes the
        idea one would form of him from reading his book. That is
        to say, he is robust, unconcerned, careless in gait and
        gesture, and ludicrously solemn of visage--a peculiarity
        which there is reason to believe he cultivates for business
        purposes. His voice is harsh, and his habit of nasal
        drawling is disagreeable, and there are moments when one
        wishes he did not find it necessary to do so much
        hesitating between words and phrases. It is to be inferred,
        of course, that he thinks his stories good or he would not
        stand up and tell them night after night in preference to
        those of anybody else; but it is impossible to avoid
        wondering now and then if his disinterested and stolid
        manner is entirely assumed. When Cable is talking it is
        easy to see that he is not only anxious to be entertaining,
        but that it is an enjoyment to him at the same time; but
        nothing of that kind is perceptible in the great humorist's
        case. His general air is that of a man who is fundamentally
        tired, and who would gladly skip the performance if he
        could. But it may be that in this very appearance of being
        bored with his own grotesque yarns lies the secret of
        persuading other people to laugh at them. We should not
        like to say that such a thing is out of the range of
        reasonable probability. And still we have a notion that
        some, at least, of the stories he tells would be more
        certain to hit the mark if the audience could be made to
        feel that he is himself convinced that they are actually
        and sufficiently funny.</p>

        <p>It is to be regretted, we think that Mr. Cable chooses
        to make most of his selections from "Dr. Sevier." It is not
        generally regarded as his best work, whatever he may think
        of it, and his admirers would be more pleased, we must
        believe, if he would present scenes and characters from
        those of his stories that are both more familiar and more
        satisfactory. We venture to say, further, that even if he
        must make "Dr. Sevier" the basis of his readings, he should
        not give preference to the merely minor persons and
        incidents. The widow Riley is well enough in her way, and
        he mimics her acceptably, but she is of little consequence
        at best. And so of the suave and deceptive Narcisse, for
        whom Mr. Cable seems to have a special partiality, but
        which is shared, we can warrant him, by very few of his
        readers. There is room to suspect that he has conceived the
        idea that it is amusement which the people mostly expect,
        and that it is therefore incumbent upon him to choose in
        the main such scenes and characters as can be turned to
        account in that one respect. If so, then he is mistaken,
        and the mistake is one that is calculated to disparage his
        standing as an author. He is not in an exact sense a
        humorist. His reputation has been won in a wholly different
        field, and through gifts of a wholly different nature. His
        strength is in the line of the dramatic, the picturesque,
        the pathetic; and these qualities, we can not help
        thinking, should appear more conspicuously in his
        readings--for other wise the value of his work is not
        properly shown, nor his books fitly recommended.</p>

        <p>The order of Mark Twain's humor, unlike that of Mr.
        Cable's, is such that it can be readily adapted to platform
        uses. It is bold, distinct, imperative, and deals in quick
        and sharp surprises. Mr. Cable's method, on the contrary,
        is groping, artificial, and entirely lacking in the element
        of suddenness, so to speak. Humor of that sort serves an
        excellent purpose in lightening the pages of a work of
        serious fiction, and is useful also in the respect of
        emphasizing certain forms of character, but when it is
        subjected to the test of public reading or recitation its
        want of inherent force and genuineness is at once manifest.
        Mark Twain's processes of thought lead inevitably to absurd
        conclusions; he could not avoid such results if he tried.
        This is not saying that everything he does is bound to be
        thoroughly laughable and deserving of high praise. He
        frequently writes trash, and it is necessary to
        discriminate in passing judgment upon his various
        contributions to the literature of the period. The fact
        remains, however, that he is essentially and at all times a
        humorist, and a very broad and aggressive one. He does not
        simply reproduce amusing things that he has seen, and
        report personal peculiarities with which he has come in
        contact; he originates and invents, and extracts drollery
        from things not in themselves of humorous quality. Mr.
        Cable has no power of that kind; and therefore his humorous
        efforts suffer by comparison with those of his
        fellow-reader, and he is obliged to resort to expedients
        for making his points that are a confession of
        weakness.</p>

        <p>Neither Mark Twain nor Mr. Cable could take a prize in
        an oratorical contest. The former is particularly not such
        an orator as Brutus was. He has defects that are natural
        and ineradicable not only, but also permits himself to
        indulge many faults that he might correct. It would hardly
        be possible for a man to handle himself more ungracefully
        than he does.....</p>
