        a full house in Rouse's Opera House last evening. The house
        was a full as comfort would allow. His subject, "The
        American Vandal Abroad," suggested something of reproof,
        but the wit and humor that tempered the speech made every
        one forget everything but that. The public owe the lecture
        committee thanks for providing for them such an
        entertainment. They have begun well. Let them keep on in
        the ways of well doing and they will find their account in
        the full houses and plethoric treasury which will be

          <b>Mark Twain's Lecture.</b>
        </center>

        <p>The second regular lecture of the Library Course was
        delivered, last evening, by Samuel Clemens, popularly known
        as "Mark Twain," the humorist, who became known to the
        public a few years ago as a correspondent of the <i>Alta
        Californian</i> of San Francisco, and who is now employed
        on the editorial staff of the New York <i>Tribune</i>. His
        subject was "The American Vandal Abroad."</p>

        <p>He was introduced by E.W. Coy. The lecturer accompanied
        the Quaker City expedition to the Bermudas, Paris, the
        Crimea, Constantinople, Palestine, and various points on
        the Mediterranean sea.</p>

        <p>It did not exactly embarrass him to be introduced in
        this public manner, but it did remind him of those European
        guides who brought out every old relic and described it
        with a trite story and who if interrupted were obliged to
        begain again at the beginning. After the party learned the
        distinguishing characteristics of these guides, they all
        determined to affect as much imbecility as possible and
        they were equal to the task. The surgeon of the ship was
        capable of asking the stupidest questions without moving a
        muscle. One guide showed the handwriting of Columbus. The
        Dr. inquired who he was, if he was dead, if his parents
        were dead, and informed the dumbfounded guide that plenty
        of boys in America could beat that, and if he had any good
        respectable penmanship, let him bring it on. After
        conducting them through the Vatican without eliciting any
        remarks of surprise, the poor guide showed a mummy, one of
        the most remarkable and best preserved. The Dr., true to
        his calling, inquired, "What did you remark that his name
        was? How calm and placid! Is he dead?" . . .</p><br />

        <p>His passages descriptive of the Sphinx, a moonlight ride
        in Venice, and the appearance of Athens from the
        surmounting eminence, were really eloquent and finished. He
        is unmistakably a man of high natural ability and
        considerable culture, and could not fail to make his mark
        in other than his chosen themes. As a satirist and
        humorist, he places no dependence upon uncouth spelling or
        local vernacular. He has an easy, don't-carative manner and
        a little of the swagger of the traditional Yankee joker
        without a single low or ungrammatical phrase.</p>
