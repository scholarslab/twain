        <p>Mark Twain is, to our taste, and in our judgment, the
        best humorist now before the public. His humor is in the
        idea, and not in the mere use or misuse of words and
        phrases, which unfortunately seem to constitute the sole
        resort of most of the so-called humorists of the day. In
        genuine fun, both in the idea and in the setting, Mark
        Twain is immeasurably in advance of "Nasby," "Josh
        Billings" and the whole miscellaneous tribe of bad spellers
        and verbal contortionists who assume to play a funny part
        among the ephemera of literature. The very "Petroleum" of
        Nasby is affected, and his peculiarities give zest rather
        to partisan politics than to the multitude. "Josh Billings"
        has a deal of humor but both he and Nasby shroud themselves
        in a mystery of infamous orthography, which becomes
        tiresome and even painful in a short time, and makes us
        turn with unmindful satisfaction to the natural and
        occasionally most singular humor of Twain. . . . "Artemus
        Ward" in his well known lecture on "Babes in the Woods,"
        made a point of constantly avoiding his subject. "Mark
        Twain" does nothing of the kind. His lecture with the fun
        out, would make a telling and accurate sketch of the
        Sandwich Islands and the natives thereof; but with the fun
        in, it is a lecture that both amuses and instructs.</p>
