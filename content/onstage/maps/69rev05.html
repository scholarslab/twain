        <p>Last evening the Academy was filled to overflowing, to
        partake of the literary Sandwich prepared and offered by
        that mirth-provoking humorist, Mark Twain. His lecture was
        appositely introduced by a series of witty generalities
        closely connected with cannibalism and craters. . . . The
        Sandwich Islands have a very limited area--scarcely enough,
        indeed, to contain a voluminous thought. . . . Mr. Twain,
        Esq., lecturer, etc., was a success. . . . Twain is not
        riotous with his fancy; he is tenderly poetical and
        discreet. His descriptions of the volcanoes of the islands
        were very fine. They were exquisite set-offs to the
        humorous or rather buttery parts of his ragout. We are at a
        loss to know whether he is a wit or a humorist. At one time
        we had some distinct idea of the difference between these
        two qualities, but Twain has literally jumbled us all up.
        If it were not for Twain we should set him down as a wit,
        but the inevitable presence causes us to classify him with
        the humorists. . . . He is a rare combination of wit and
        humor. He abounds in seasonable hits. He has no elocution,
        but simply a style that knows no restraints but simply
        those necessary to provoke mirth. His "Sandwich" is
        admirable for dyspepsia; even a roast dog and fricasseed
        cat become agreeable after a little familiarity. . . . The
        man who can administer to the mind healthful relaxatives,
        and thereby restore the stomach, is certainly entitled to
        rank with those who do the same with the stomach and
        thereby restore the mind.</p>

          <b>Mark Twain.</b>
        </center>Mark Twain, the celebrated humorist, was honored
        last night with one of the largest audiences ever assembled
        in the Academy of Music. He lectured upon "The Sandwich
        Islands," and mingled with much very interesting
        information a vast amount of humorous anecdote, witty
        allusion, and of that odd, incongruous, surprising
        divergence from his theme, which is his charming
        characteristic. Mr. Clemens deserved the compliment
        bestowed upon him. We regard him as the very best of the
        humorists of his class. He is more extravagant and
        preposterous than John Phoenix; he is superior to Artemus
        Ward, not only in the delicate quality of his humor, but
        because he has a decent regard for the English language,
        and does not depend for his effects upon barbarous
        orthography. John Billings is not to be compared with him.
        Billings is merely a proverbial philosopher who has some
        wit, plenty of hard common sense, a shrewd knowledge of
        human nature, but not one particle of genuine,
        irrepressible fun. He has said some good things, but they
        are all marred by the wretched spelling which the author
        considers necessary to his success. Mark Twain indulges in
        humor because it is his nature to do so. It is impossible
        to read his productions or to hear him speak without being
        impressed with the conviction that his cleverest utterances
        are spontaneous, natural, unpremeditated. Like all men of
        his temperament he has a hearty hatred of sham, hypocrisy
        and cant, whether in religion, social life or politics.
        Some of his sturdiest blows have been aimed at the follies
        of the times; and we believe that he may, if he chooses,
        exercise a very considerable influence as a reformer.
        Ridicule, cleverly used, is one of the most powerful
        weapons against pretension and humbug; for it not only robs
        them of their false dignity, but it appeals strongly to the
        popular reader, and finds ready acceptance where serious
        discussion would not be permitted. We do not suppose that
        Mr. Clemens has any notion of starting out upon a mission
        of reformation; but unconsciously he may do a good work in
        this direction, while at the same time he furnishes the
        nation with the purest and best entertainment in his
        lectures and his screeds. There may be some who will regard
        his calling as of smaller dignity than that of other men.
        Perhaps this is the class with which he is at war. The mass
        of intelligent people will agree with us that genuine humor
        is as rare and excellent a quality as any other, and that
        it is as respectable to amuse mankind as to stupefy them.
        The number of persons engaged in the former work is small;
        those who attempt the latter abound in quantities.
