          <b>TWO FAMOUS AUTHORS.</b>
        </center><br />
        The announcement that Mark Twain and George W. Cable would
        give readings from their works filled the lecture room of
        the Academy last night. Applause broke out when a short,
        slender figure, clad in evening dress, advanced with a
        dainty tread to the front of the stage and bowed to the
        audience. The figure was that of Mr. Cable. His hair is
        dark and his eyes gleam now with humor and now with
        pathos.<br />
        <br />
        He wears a full beard and long, well-twisted mustachios
        that droop on either side and form a complete semi-circle.
        His feet and hands are small and the latter he uses with
        all the grace and delicacy of a woman. Mr. Cable's voice is
        pitched in a high but musical key. His modulation possesses
        a charm which suggests the rippling of a stream. It rises
        and falls with almost every word.<br />
        <br />
        With the exception of the Creole songs which Mr. Cable
        sang, all his readings were from his "Dr. Sevier." To say
        the least, they were delightful, and were heartily
        appreciated by the audience.<br />
        <br />
        Mark Twain no sooner put his head outside the flies than
        the audience began to laugh as well as applaud. There was
        something indescribably droll about the very look of the
        man.<br />
        <br />
        He, too, wore the conventional swallow tail. He came
        forward with a lazy air. It was as much as he seemed able
        to do to drag one foot after another. His dark, iron-grey
        hair was brushed back. He has a heavy brownish moustache.
        As he walks he stoops slightly. He never smiles. When he
        says anything that creates laughter, he simply pauses,
        throws his head a little on one side and peers sleepily out
        of the corner of his eye.<br />
        <br />
        His favorite use of his hands is either to scratch the back
        of his head or with the outside of his thumb to rub his
        half-closed eyes. The program of last evening will be
        repeated at 2 P. M. to-day. An entirely new program will be
        produced to-night at 8 o'clock.

        <b>Cable and Twain's Readings.</b>--At Oratorio Hall last
        night "Mark Twain" and Mr. Cable gave their farewell
        readings. Mr. Cable recited selections from "Dr. Sevier,"
        and sang some of the creole songs familiar to the residents
        of New Orleans. Mark Twain gave an account of "Huck Finn
        and Tom Sawyer's Brilliant Achievement" in rescuing in
        romantic manner the slave Jim, of the "Blue Jay's Mistake,"
        and of the "Jumping Frog" of Jim Smiley, of Calaveras
        county. By request he recited at the close of the readings
        the "Ghost Story."
