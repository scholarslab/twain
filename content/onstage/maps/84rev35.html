        &nbsp; The large and cultivated audience enjoyed the rare
        treat presented by George W. Cable and Mark Twain in the
        New Haven Opera House last evening. All the selections were
        rare and finely rendered. The first selection, "Music of
        Place Congo," was read by Mr. Cable in an apt style. The
        second selection, "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," by Mark
        Twain, fully sustained the admirable reputation of the
        other parts of the programme. "Scenes from Dr. Sevier," by
        Dr. Cable and "Ghost Story" and "A Trying Situation," by
        Mark Twain, deserve especial mention. The entertainment was
        a success in every particular and the public will be repaid
        at any time for making efforts to hear these two gentlemen
        who are now appearing together.<br />
