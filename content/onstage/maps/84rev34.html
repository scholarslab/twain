          <b>"Mark Twain"--Cable Readings.</b>
        </center><br />
        &nbsp; Last night, for the first time in this vicinity,
        Mark Twain and Mr. George W. Cable appeared in their dual
        readings, amusing and interesting a very large audience at
        Melrose in the second entertainment of the Melrose Lyceum.
        So great was the interest manifested in this unique
        combination that extra seats had to be supplied in the
        large hall for those unable to be accommodated otherwise.
        The union of Mark Twain and Mr. Cable in selected readings,
        each from his own works, is a happy one. Both authors have
        created styles of literature entirely distinct from each
        other, as well as from any other style. Their writings have
        marked peculiarities which from the very first were
        appreciated by the American literary public and which have
        as yet shown no sign of failing either in power from the
        author's pen or in influence upon the readers' minds. Mark
        Twain's dry, purely American humor has aroused merriment
        for years and has developed a field of fiction in which no
        other author has ventured, at least without seeking aid
        from some second source of literary power to conceal the
        weak points of his imitative "Mark Twain" style. The humor
        is notably Yankee; no English reader of Punch could
        thoroughly appreciate the rich undemonstrative humor of
        Innocents Abroad--that is, if he takes Punch as his
        standard. Mr. Cable, on the other hand, has but recently
        appeared to present us with a series of character sketches
        treating of a race which though resident upon American soil
        are yet but little understood or even known by Americans
        outside of a few Southern States. His writings are in that
        respect foreign, and appeal less to the natural recognition
        of a native American reader; for that very reason, however,
        the great popularity which they have gained more
        commendation to the writings. As in their writings, so in
        their appearance, their manner, their style of delivery,
        their intonations and gestures, these two authors display
        pecularities different from each other, and yet both
        interesting and amusing. Mr. Clemens comes slowly forward
        upon the stage, his shoulders slightly stooping, his head
        inclined forward, and his face unwrinkled with any trace of
        a smile, but bearing exactly that semi-solemn expression
        which one would expect to see in the man who could so
        seriously be-fool a foreign guide intent on showing
        "Christopher Columbus on a bust." Mr. Cable's slender form
        advances to the front with easy grace, while his mobile
        mouth responds to the warm welcome with a pleasing smile.
        Mr. Clemens reads, or rather recites, his bits of fun with
        his usual slow, cool, almost unvarying tone, moving about
        the stage scarcely any, and using few gestures. Mr. Cable
        is now here, now there, now standing, now sitting, and all
        the time his quick, flexible, light voice is pouring out
        sentence after sentence of Creole dialect, emphasized by
        appropriate, flowing gestures. In short, these two authors
        present an evening's readings which, outside of its innate
        interest, give an enjoyable opportunity to the hearer for
        comparison of the two styles of literature as well as of
        the creators of those styles. Last night the entertainment
        was preceded by a piano recital by Miss E. Leora Hardy. The
        "Mark Twain"-Cable readings will be given in Boston
        Thursday night in the Bay State Course.
