        <p><b>"Roughing it" by Mark Twain.</b>--Rand's Hall was
        "jammed" last night to hear, for the first time in Troy,
        Mr. Clemens, alias "Mark Twain." The seats were all filled,
        the aisles were crowded, standing room in the back of the
        hall was all taken, and, besides the usual number of seats
        of the platform, several extras were added, notwithstanding
        which, many stood up on the stage and many went home
        because they couldn't sit or stand anywhere in the hall. To
        the majority of the audience Mark Twain was known only by
        reputation. But not one went away disappointed. To give a
        report of the lecture that would appear half as witty or
        interesting as the lecture itself, would be impossible, as
        much of Twain's success as a lecturer is due to the way he
        has of "putting things." His words were somewhat drawled
        out and his sentences were divided by long pauses. About
        eight o'clock the lecturer, in company with President
        Fursman and Secretary Cole, walked upon the stage. Mr.
        Clemens immediately took a position in front of the
        audience, the desk having been removed, and began. Said he:
        "Ladies and gentlemen--The next lecture--to be delivered
        before this Association--will not be a lecture at all. It
        will be a reading by Mr. Vandenhoff of New York. I can
        highly recommend this gentleman to you as an excellent
        reader.--I never--heard--him. He reads large print very
        plainly. This evening, ladies, you will be addressed by Mr.
        Clemens--otherwise known as Mark Twain,--a gentleman noted
        for his great learning, his historical accuracy, and his
        veneration for the truth,--which is only equalled by his
        moral principles. I refer, of course, in these vague,
        general terms to myself." Speaking of the subject of his
        lecture, he said: "I don't <i>know</i>, ladies and
        gentlemen, what lecture I am advertised to deliver
        to-night--I have not inquired. I have delivered several
        lectures this Winter--and can deliver them all to you this
        evening if you wish it, but if I had my choice I should
        deliver the one entitled "Roughing It."</p>

        <p>In a similar strain the lecturer continued for over an
        hour keeping his audience constantly convulsed with
        laughter, while he gave a description of what he had
        learned about Nevada during his three years' residence in
        that section.</p>

        <p>With all this nonsense there was combined no little
        sense which he advised his hearers at the close to pick out
        and keep. We trust in future that Mark Twain will be
        regularly on the Y. M. A. course.</p>
