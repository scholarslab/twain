        Mark had a crowded house last night. Tacoma's very best
        people were out in force to listen to him, and they were
        ready to laugh upon the slightest provocation. That is, the
        most of them were. There were some very intelligent people
        in the audience who were unable to swing into line with
        Mark's peculiar kind of humor and they looked tired, too
        tired even to smile. But he tickled the risibilities of all
        the rest, and they enjoyed themselves thoroughly and paid
        no attention to the folks who were too opaque to appreciate
        the fun. His evening in Tacoma was a big success.
