        Mark Twain's characteristic introduction of himself last
        night at its close shaped itself into an apology for his
        having been the cause of bringing from pleasant homes and
        cheerful firesides the large audience that assembled at the
        opera house last night. We venture the assertion, however,
        that every one present felt fully repaid for the discomfort
        experienced in fighting their way through the fiercest snow
        storm of the season by the excellence of the entertainment
        furnished them by Mark Twain who certainly is entitled to
        rank as our foremost humorist and George W. Cable, the
        distinguished southern novelist. Mr. Cable was first upon
        the program and gave a reading from Dr. Sevier, but
        unfortunately the greatest portion of it was lost to the
        audience by reason of the interruptions caused by the late
        comers. Mark Twain came next and the appearance of the
        ungainly body and the shaggy head was the signal for
        applause. He remarked after the performance that he had
        grown handsomer of late. If this is the fact, and it is
        generally understood that Twain is truthful, we feel
        grateful that he didn't appear before us in his previous
        condition. As far as looks are concerned Twain would never
        capture a premium at a beauty show, but when it comes to
        story telling the best judges would pronounce him chief. He
        called the audience friends and fellow townsmen, told them
        he was glad to resume an intercourse that had been broken
        off years ago, said he was sorry to have been the cause of
        bringing them out upon such a night, but that they were no
        worse off than the people of some seventy-five cities
        already visited by them this season, that a storm generally
        preceded their coming, and that if feeling well they always
        left a famine behind them. After this, as a sort of
        introduction and preliminary, he waded into an extract from
        his new book and caused many a laugh by his funny
        description of the discussion of the merits of and demerits
        of "King Sollermun" between the darkey Jim and Huckleberry
        Finn.

        <p>Mr. Cable's next reading was from Dr. Sevier also and
        dealt with Kate Riley, Richling and Ristofalo, the latter
        part of it being devoted to the wooing of the widow by the
        Italian and was given in a decidedly clever manner. Mark
        Twain then convulsed the audience with a side-splitting
        history of his tussle with the German language and his
        lamentable failure to properly declare their adjectives or
        master the intricacies of the gender of their nouns. Being
        recalled he told his very funny stuttering story and
        another being demanded he spun a sailor yarn to the entire
        satisfaction of the audience.</p>

        <p>For the regular number on the program Mr. Cable at this
        point substituted several pleasing Creole songs which were
        well received. Twain then gave "a Trying Situation" which
        was followed by Mr. Cable in a descriptive reading. He had
        kept his best for the last and his dramatic rendition of
        "Mary's Night Ride" won for him most heart applause. The
        performance was closed with a personal reminiscence by Mark
        Twain detailing his experience with the duello in his days
        of roughing it in the rowdy west.</p>
