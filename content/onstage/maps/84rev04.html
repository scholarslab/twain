          <b>The Mark Twain-Cable Readings.</b>
        </center><br />
        <br />
        Major J.B. Pond has brought before the public for three
        readings in this city the names Mark Twain and George W.
        Cable, and they have proved a powerful attraction among the
        most cultivated and intelligent people of this city. The
        first reading was given last night at Association Hall,
        where a very select audience assembled, filling three
        circles of the pretty auditorium.

        <p>It is "too late a week" to criticize work so artistic
        and so well known. Suffice it to say that Mr. Cable gave
        "Narcisse and John and Mary Richling," from "Dr. Sevier,"
        the courting scene in the same book in which Kate Riley so
        amusingly chaffs Ristofalo, "Narcisse in Mourning for Lady
        Byron," and the great humorist recited, while tears ran
        down his listeners' cheeks, some scenes from the advance
        sheets of the "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" and the
        "Tragic Tale of the Fishwife," described "A Trying
        Situation," one of his funniest efforts, in which a
        gentleman who does not recognize a lady, who does recognize
        him, is utterly mystified and overwhelmingly embarrassed by
        her questioning him about a fictitious past, in what she
        calls "a delightful talk about old times," and wound up
        with a ghost story which convulsed his audience. The next
        entertainments will take place at Association Hall on the
        afternoon and evening of Wednesday, November 26, when, as
        Mr. Clemens expresses it, he will "continue to make his
        last, final farewell appearance."</p>

          <b>Mark Twain's Humorous Sayings.</b>
        </center><br />
        <br />
        <p>A very appreciative audience gathered last evening at
        Association Hall to listen to the readings of Mark Twain
        and George W. Cable. Mr. Cable gave some of his inimitable
        stories of Southern life and thrilling romances of the war,
        which were generously applauded. Alternately the audience
        was kept rollicking with laughter at the droll yarns of
        America's prince of humorists, the ever-comical Mark Twain.
        A vein of dry humor ran through all of his tales, and made
        him, as usual, popular with the audience.</p>

        <p>One of his yarns contemplated the reform of the human
        race by preventing the habit of profanity among men. The
        reform was to be accomplished by substituting mechanical
        swearing through the means of the phonograph. The effect of
        this contrivance on shipboard, colored by all the
        possibilities of swearing in foreign languages, and
        swearing backwards and multiplying the force of it by
        placing as many as one hundred and fifty phonographs in
        different parts of the ship was too much for the most
        serious audience in the world, and there was a continuous
        burst of laughter.</p>

          <b>TWAIN AND CABLE.</b><br />
The First of This Season's Star Course<br />
Entertainments a Success
        </center><br />
        <br />

<p> &nbsp; Last night's audience at the Academy of Music was a strong assurance that the Star Course, now in its sixteenth year, is as popular as ever with the public.  There was not a vacant seat in the parquet and balcony, and even the family circle was comfortably filled.  The aisles of the balcony and parquet circle were also packed, and did not furnish standing room after the readings began.  Colonel McClure made an introductory address, in which he pronounced Miss Harris, the new manager of the Course, a worthy successor to T. B. Pugh, and then presented the entertainers of the evening, Mark Twain and George W. Cable, to the audience.  After Mr. Cable had opened the entertainment, Mark Twain appeared.</p>

<p> &nbsp;  He dragged himself to the front of the stage with that inimitable and characteristic laziness of his which always provokes a roar of laughter.</p>

<p> &nbsp; "Colonel McClure has introduced one of the confederates in this moral and intellectual conspiracy," he drawled.  "I am the other one.  A good many of you have had a great deal to do with boys," he continued, "and the rest of you have been boys, so you all know what boys are."</p>

<p> &nbsp; He then told the story of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer's brilliant achievement.  Both were white boys.  Tom's uncle had imprisoned Jim, a negro slave, in a log cabin for having run away.  The boys visited Jim whenever they pleased, and could have released him by merely leaving the door open.  But Tom had read of hairbreadth escapes from prison, and determined to get him out in the most elegant and romantic manner.  They dug a hole under the cabin, sent him a rope ladder in a pie, and having read that noted prisoners always had pets in their solitude, brought him a large assortment of spiders, snakes and other reptiles and bugs.  Fearing that his uncle's family was not taking enough interest in the matter to make it exciting, Tom wrote a series of anonymous letters, couched in blood-curdling language, which caused a reign of terror in the household.  The last missive said: "A desperit gang ov cut-throats from Indian Territory will sneak down at mid-night to steal your runaway nigger.  I am one of the gang, but I got religion."  The result of this letter was that Tom's uncle had a number of armed men in readiness to prevent the escape.  The boys were successful, however, and reached an island on the river, after Tom had received a bullet in his leg.</p>

<p> &nbsp; The gifted humorist also told the story of a blue jay's mistake, which had been related to him by a man who understood bird language, and concluded with the tale of the jumping frog.</p>

<p> &nbsp; Mr. Cable gave a description of Narcisse, a character in one of his novels, who was a great admirer of Bryon's poetry, and consequently of Byron himself.  Having heard that Lady Bryon was dead, Narcisse thought it proper to show his respect for her memory by putting on mourning.  He then delighted the audience with a number of African-Creole songs.  In his recital of "Mary Richling's Night Ride Through the Confederate Lines" he showed strong dramatic power, and received a hearty encore.</p>

<p> &nbsp; "I will now close these solemnities," said Mark Twain, coming forward.

<p> &nbsp; Just then a number of people began to leave.  Twain looked at them and told them that if they wanted to catch a train they should go right ahead.</p>

<p> &nbsp; "If anybody wants to go out I don't care," he said, dryly, but nobody else seemed inclined to leave, and he told another amusing story.</p>

<p> &nbsp; Next Monday evening George R. Wendling will give an illustrated lecture on "Dickens," comprising more than two hundred illustrations, representing famous scenes from the great novelist's stories.</p>
