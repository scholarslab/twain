          Mark Twain's Entertainment at the Grand Opera House Last
          Night.</b>
        </center><br />
        An audience which packed the Grand opera house from the
        orchestra railing to the top row of the rear gallery
        greeted Mark Twain when the curtain rose last night. Every
        seat was sold and over a hundred chairs were brought in to
        try to accommodate those who wished to see America's great
        humorist, and even then many were turned away. It was the
        largest, the most cultured, and the best audience ever seen
        in Petoskey, the receipts being $524.

        <p>The lecturer was not at his best last night, having but
        recently left the bed to which he was confined for weeks
        with a carbuncle that at one time threatened his life.
        Indeed he was obliged to go to bed immediately upon his
        arrival in the afternoon. But notwithstanding his condition
        he kept the vast audience in a constant ripple of laughter
        from first to last, and when he suggested stopping he was
        greeted by cries of "go on, go on," accompanied by
        enthusiastic applause. He was however compelled to cut his
        time somewhat, only speaking about an hour and twenty
        minutes.</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens is a small, slight man, with spare face, a
        little the worse for wear, with shaggy eyebrows about his
        twinkling eyes and a drooping mustache falling over his
        mouth. But the distinguishing mark of the man -- a
        unconscious pun -- is the mass of bushy iron gray hair
        which encircles his head like a halo to speak poetically,
        or like the Wild Man of Borneo to be literal. He speaks
        with a peculiar drawl, and in a sort of confidentially
        conversational manner which makes everything wonderfully
        effective. If what he said were printed word for word it
        would not seem particularly humorous, but told in his
        inimitable style it is irresistably funny.</p>

        <p>The program last night began with an account of the
        lecturer's first theft. He thought it was the first
        watermelon he ever stole, but was not entirely clear on
        that point. By what he is still compelled to consider an
        inexcusable mistake he took a green melon from the wagon of
        a farmer who was peddling them out. When he realized the
        true character of his act he immediately repented. He felt
        a moral uplifting which compelled him to restore the melon
        to the farmer. He delivered it, accompanied by a lecture on
        the sin of selling green melons which led the farmer to
        reform, so that Mark was rewarded by the consciousness of
        leading a fellow creature into the paths of rectitude,
        besides getting a ripe melon for the green one which the
        farmer supposed he had sold.</p>

        <p>One of his most graphic descriptions was an account of a
        boyhood's experience, sneaking into his father's office at
        midnight to sleep on the couch, where unknown to him a
        murdered man had been stretched out awaiting an inquest.
        The people held their breath as a told how his hair rose
        when he discovered a nameless something on the floor, but
        the gruesome feeling changed to uproarious hilarity when he
        told how, when the moonlight finally gleamed upon the
        corpse, he "went away," taking the window sash with him,
        "not that I needed the sash, but it was more convenient to
        take it."</p>

        <p>The crowd was also immensely "tickled" over the story of
        the jumping frog. An extract from Tom Sawyer, the plan for
        the crusade, afforded an excellent opportunity for the
        dialect work of which Twain is a master.</p>

        <p>The Arlington orchestra furnished several choice
        selections while the audience was gathering, and at the
        close of the entertainment.</p>
