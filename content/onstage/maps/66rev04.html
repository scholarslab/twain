      We have been an admirer of the inimitable humor of the
      lecturer, as shown in his numerous letters and sketches, that
      have been so widely published, but confess that the lecture
      disappointed us. We expected to hear the Kanakas "Joked
      blind," but had no idea of being treated to such an
      intellectual feast as he served up to his audience. We never
      heard or read anything half so beautiful as his description
      when he laid aside the role of the humorist and gave rein to
      his fancy. To use the expression of a rapt listener to the
      lecture, "He's lightenin'."</td>
