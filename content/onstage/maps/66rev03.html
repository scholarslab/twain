The enthusiasm with which his lecture was
        everywhere greeted is still ringing throughout California,
        and now that his foot is in his native heath we expect to
        see the very mountains shake with a tempest of approval.<br /><br />

        </center>
An immense success. One of the largest and most
        fashionable audiences that ever graced the Opera House, . .
        . all of the available seats and standing room were
        occupied. It was a magnificent tribute to the lecturer from
        his old friends. . . . Combining the most valuable and
        statistical and general information with passages of
        drollest humor--all delivered in the peculiar and
        inimitable style of the author--and rising occasionally to
        lofty flights of descriptive eloquence--the lecture
        constitutes an entertainment of rare excellence and
        interest.
