      <td><font size="+1">Between 1866 and 1895 MT gave over 200
      lecture performances in the United States and Canada, most on
      eight different tours. The maps in this section will enable
      you to see where he went, and in many places to get an idea
      of how his performance was received in the cities and towns
      he spoke to. When you click on the buttons <i>at left</i>,
      you'll see the approximate area of one tour laid out on a map
      of the United States. Clicking on that map will take you to
      another, showing all the stops on that lecture tour. Whenever
      a place name is <u>underlined</u> on these maps, you can
      click on it to read at least one review from a local
      paper.<br />
      <br />
      MT performed live in 23 states. It's also interesting to see
      where he didn't go, what areas of the country he never
      lectured in. Two final maps allow you to see that part of the
      story.</font> <b>STATES</b> <font size="+1">identifies the
      states he did and didn't visit.</font> <b>TOURS</b>
      <font size="+1">tries, by plotting all the tours on top of
      the same map of North America, to indicate graphically how
      often he lectured in the different regions of the
      country.<br /></font></td>
