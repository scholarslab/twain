        <br />

        <p>The largest audience ever assembled in Sprague's Hall
        was packed there on Thursday evening to listen to the
        author of "The Innocents Abroad." Every available foot of
        space was occupied; many persons had come from miles
        outside to the entertainment. "Mark" had taken a dislike to
        his lecture on Artemus Ward; and his desire to repeat it
        was not heightened by the knowledge that a paper
        circulating several hundred copies here had published, with
        "enterprise" hardly fair toward one of the guild, a long
        report of it as delivered in Brooklyn. He had prepared a
        new lecture that day, drawn chiefly from his forthcoming
        new book, which a few hours' more time would have enabled
        him to deliver without notes; but, being assured that he
        would find a bright and quickly-responsive audience, he
        decided to try his new lecture here. It is entitled
        "Roughing It"; and the general character of the lecture, as
        well as the success of the venture, are very well indicated
        in the extract from "The Buffalo Courier," published in our
        Localized Items to-day. It treats of various scenes and
        episodes in Mark's overland journey to California some ten
        years ago, and is interspersed and enlivened with some
        thoroughly Twain-ish stories, told in a manner that seemed
        to us the perfection of art for this style of humor. It
        abounded in descriptive passages of rare beauty,--really
        classic in their conception and expression, and delivered
        with all the effect of finished eloquence, holding the
        crowded audience in the perfect stillness of rapt attention
        which marks the fine periods of Curtis or Anna Dickinson.
        Equally well done, to our mind, were the humorous passages.
        The slightly-drawling and apparently seriously-unconscious
        manner seems to us perfectly adapted to the droll,
        extravagant humor of Ward and Twain. With the latter it is
        entirely natural, and not assumed, as some suppose. Aside
        from the fine descriptive passages, and the inimitable
        stories, his effort abounded in bits of sentiment and
        flashes of wit that would alone redeem many a dull lecture.
        The audience were "with" him from the introduction to the
        close; and the hour and a half seemed robbed of half its
        clock-ticks.</p>
