        Mark Twain discourse about "The Vandal Abroad," and we fear
        were generally disappointed. As a lecture it was a humbug.
        As an occasion for laughter on very small capital of wit or
        ideas it was a success. There were one or two passages of
        some merit. His apostrophe to the Sphinx was decidedly
        good, as was also his description of the ruins of the
        Parthenon, and of Athens by moonlight. Some touches of
        Venice did very well, but it was impossible to know when he
        was talking in earnest and when in burlesque. It was
        amusing and interesting to see such a crowd of people
        laughing together, even though we knew half of them were
        ashamed that they were laughing at such very small
        witticisms. We were very much disappointed that there was
        so little substance to his lecture. We would not give two
        cents to hear him again.</p>

        <p>But, lest he might not have succeeded with his "Vandal
        Abroad," he illustrated the character at the Clinton House,
        where he stopped. The morning after the lecture nothing was
        seen of him up to nine o'clock, and the landlord, in his
        kindness, went to his room to see if he might not be in
        want of something, but received a storm of curses and abuse
        for disturbing him. Of course the landlord retreated and
        left him. After a while a terrible racket was heard, and
        unearthly screams which frightened the women of the house.
        The landlord rushed to the room and there found a splendid
        specimen of the vandal and his works. There, before him,
        was the veritable animal, with his skin on at least, but
        not much else, and in a towering rage. He had kicked the
        fastenings from the door, not deigning to open it in the
        usual way -- that would have been too much like other
        folks. He poured upon the landlord another torrent of
        curses, impudence and abuse. He demanded to know where the
        bell-pull was. The landlord told him they were not up yet,
        and they had not yet got the house fully completed. His
        kicking the door open and his lung performance were his
        substitute for a bell. At two o'clock P.M. he had not
        dressed, and whether he did before he left on the five
        o'clock train we did not learn. The Y.M.C.A. were
        wretchedly imposed upon by Mark Twain, and so of course
        were the audience. He is the only one engaged for the
        course whose personal character was unknown. In great
        contrast will he be followed by the glorious Howard, the
        Christian Hero and Soldier, who gave his own right arm to
        his country, and who was ever true to her cause and the
        cause of his great Master above.</p>
