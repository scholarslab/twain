          <b>Amusements. The Cable-Twain Readings.</b>
        </center><br />

        <p>The 800 persons who braved last night's storm to listen
        to the "Mark Twain"-Cable readings, so-called, were more
        than repaid for their fortitude. The entertainment was a
        novel one in that the selections rendered by Messrs.
        Clemens and Cable were confined entirely to their own
        writings. The public familiarity with the literary
        productions of both authors made the readings very
        enjoyable, however. There is a wide diversity in the
        manners, methods, and styles of the two men, but a contrast
        only brings out in stronger relief the merits of both. Mark
        Twain is funny in every movement, word, and, it may be
        truly said, thought. The very awkwardness of his gait and
        the homeliness of the words he uses create a laugh, while
        the drolleries that persist in rolling from his lips set
        his auditors off into uncontrollable roars. The muscles of
        his face and mouth are rigid while he relates an anecdote,
        but his little, twinkling eyes have a power of expression
        that is wonderful, making his fun irresistible. He draws
        his words out in a strong, resonant voice, and has a habit
        of making comparisons with a sort of negative simile that
        is simply delicious.</p>

        <p>Mr. Cable's humor--for he is humorous--is of a deeper
        quality, and last night was greatly appreciated. He is
        quiet in demeanor on the stage and always dignified, except
        when delineating some ridiculous character. Being a
        Southerner, he has mastered all the Southern dialects from
        that of the planter to the creole and common negro. He is
        not deficient in Irish and Italian dialects. He has a
        pliable countenance that is powerful in the expression of
        the different emotions; and, having made a careful study of
        fireside scenes and conversations in every-day life, he is
        especially fitted to portray the actions, mannerisms, and
        expressions of the characters in his "Dr. Sevier," from
        which he read entirely last night. His first selection did
        not seem to awake his hearers, but his second--a love scene
        between a coy Irish widow and a phlegmatic Italian (the
        first phlegmatic Italian ever discovered)--was so true to
        life that he earned a well-merited encore, to which he
        responded with a simple bow. His third number consisted of
        Creole-negro songs in the French patois used by that race
        in their weird dances and incantations. "Pauvre Petite
        Mam'zelle Zizi" was so full of sweet, appealing, touching
        music, and was sung so well the audience asked for a
        repetition, which was not given because of a lack of time.
        Mr. Cable's qualities as a reader came out in the rendition
        of "Mary's Night Ride," a beautiful but strong poem in
        prose, and he was hardly permitted to leave the stage. He
        had achieved a triumph over the audience that had greeted
        him so coldly on his first appearance.</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens was recalled after every recitation. He kept
        his hearers in a perpetual roar, and he did his best
        undoubtedly, as during the evening he took occasion to
        thank his audience for their attendance upon such a
        blustering night. He unwittingly created a great deal of
        merriment by failing to find the proper exit leading to the
        waiting-room, where he sat during his associate's
        recitations. He crossed the stage twice, tried every door,
        and was amazed at the great number of wrong doors he could
        find. He appeared to be as greatly amused as the laughing
        lookers-on, and finally dove through a doorway after
        murmuring "Guess I rehearsed with the wrong door." "I
        admire this elegant building," said Mr. Cable, laughing
        heartily at the other's discomfiture, "but I do think a
        guide should be provided for strangers." All of Mark
        Twain's selections were from his "Innocents Abroad," except
        one from the advance sheets of his latest production, "The
        Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."</p>

          <b>Twain and Cable.</b>
        </center>

        <p>A large audience again met George W. Cable and Mark
        Twain at Central Music Hall last night, leaving only a few
        seats vacant on the outskirts of the hall. Mr. Cable's
        recitations again received intelligent and smiling
        consideration, while Mr. Clemens convulsed the house with
        uncontrollable mirth. His account of the runaway slave's
        escape from the log cabin under the auspices of Tom Sawyer
        and Huckleberry Finn was irresistible. There will be
        another reading tonight.</p>
