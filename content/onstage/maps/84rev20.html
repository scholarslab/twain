        Mark Twain and Geo. W. Cable entertained a crowded house at
        the Methodist church last evening. The audience was kept in
        a continual roar of laughter for two hours and went home
        with the assurance that the "troop," as Mark Twain called
        it, would return to Madison on the 27th of this
        month.<br />

        At the Methodist church Mark Twain and Geo. W. Cable
        entertained a goodly audience for two hours, with their
        joint readings. They were both very clever all the way
        through. The programme was an excellent one; entirely
        different from the one presented on their appearance a week
        or more ago.

        &nbsp; Mark Twain and George W. Cable will entertain the
        public at the M. E. church this evening, with their joint
        readings. Their appearance here a few evenings since formed
        the occasion for a larger turn-out, and at that time many
        people were not able to secure seats. That the attendance
        will be liberal to-night is a foregone conclusion. These
        two gentlemen are drawing marvelously wherever they appear
        and the greatest satisfaction is expressed at their
        readings. To-night a new programme throughout will be
        presented.<br />

          <b>Stage and Rostrum. TWAIN-CABLE.</b>
        </center><br />
        &nbsp; The basement of the M. E. church was again well
        filled last evening, to listen to the readings of Mark
        Twain and George W. Cable. The entertainment was of that
        novel and really rare class with which these gentlemen are
        making such a great success throughout the country. The men
        are as different in their appearance as in their readings,
        and the contrast but enhances the character of the
        entertainment. To those who had never before seen Mr.
        Cable, his advent before them as he stepped from a rear
        room upon the rostrum last evening was something of a
        surprise. He is an unusually small man physically, but
        though short of stature he is symmetrically proportioned.
        His weight must be in the neighborhood of 95 lbs. He is
        erect, bears himself handsomely and gracefully, and is the
        embodiment of refinement and culture. His complexion is
        dark, and harmonizes with his hair. A full beard adorns his
        face, and his moustaches are long and twisted into a
        suggestion of his name. His features are delicately
        moulded, and the brow is broad and full, and indicative of
        the intellectuality of its possessor. Mr. Cable has a voice
        which, though of a tenor turn, possesses a nasal twang. Mr.
        Clemens, or Mark Twain, is a finely constituted man, whose
        weight is probably about 160 lbs. He is evenly
        proportioned, and active in his movements. His face is an
        admirable one. The features are all strong and masculine.
        The nose is full and straight; the jaws are the embodiment
        of firmness; the eyes are somewhat sunken and seem to be on
        the constant alert to spring something surprising on his
        auditors, and the forehead is high and full, with a few
        wrinkles extending across it. The mouth is partially hidden
        by a heavy, gray-besprinkled moustache which drops over it,
        while a thick mass of hair, well tinged with age, crowns
        the head, drooping down somewhat over both the forehead and
        right ear. While giving his readings, Twain, as he is
        better known, stands carelessly, with his left hand in his
        pantaloons' pocket, while his right has an amusing habit of
        playing with his mouth, as in the case of some awkward,
        overgrown boy. The expression of his face scarcely changes
        during an entertainment, though when the audience laughs
        loudest there is the greatest air of injury about it.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; Mr. Cable entertained his auditors with two
        interesting selections from Dr. Sevier, in which the
        peculiar dialect of the Creole was pleasantly employed. He
        substituted several Creole songs for the fifth number upon
        the programme, and rendered the strange airs with so much
        feeling and beauty that he was recalled. His recitation of
        Mary's Night Ride was, however, the crowning effort of the
        evening, and his depiction of the wild ride of the brave
        mother and her child away from the rebel ambush, while the
        bullets whistled about her, was so vivid and thrilling that
        the audience held its very breath as it watched the
        thrilling chase.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; It would be impossible to do justice to the richness
        of the treat which Mark Twain offered. His dry recital of
        the desperate encounter he had with an interviewer was
        ludicrous in the extreme, and could only be appreciated
        upon being heard. The story of Huck Finn and Tom's Sawyer's
        brilliant achievement in rescuing a negro captive who was
        imprisoned in a cabin on the farm of Huck's uncle, kept the
        audience in a constant roar of laughter, while the
        stuttering story was unique and highly amusing. The
        anecdote of how Smiley's frog was charged with shot by a
        clever stranger, who afterwards won $40 from the owner in a
        jumping contest between a fresh frog from the marsh and the
        trained pet of Smiley's, was very entertaining. Twain
        closed by giving in all its details the narrow escape from
        a duel which he had with a rival editor while running a
        western paper, and claimed that the practice of dueling was
        pernicious and ought to be frowned down by all good
        citizens. He said that if he were challenged now, he would
        take the challenging party by the hand, gently lead him off
        into some quiet, secluded place and there--kill him.<br />
