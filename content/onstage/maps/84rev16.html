          <b>AMUSEMENTS.<br />
          The Twain-Cable Readings.</b>
        </center>

        <p>The most unique and thoroughly enjoyable entertainment
        ever given in Indianapolis was the Mark Twain- George W.
        Cable readings at Plymouth Church, last night, and they
        were given before one of the finest audiences that could be
        gathered, the auditorium of the church being completely
        filled in parquette and galleries. From first to last the
        immense assembly was in hearty sympathy with the readers,
        and, for a time, it looked as if the intention was to hold
        them all night. Mr. Cable's readings were entirely from Dr.
        Sevier, and they introduced Mary Richling Narcisse, Kate
        Riley and Ristofalo, and, incidentally, Mr. Richling. They
        were, in substance, the same selections he read here last
        winter; but he has them now in much better control, and is
        enabled to give more attention to nicety of expression than
        then, for he was then too closely confined to the printed
        page before him. For the third number, "Narcisse Putting on
        Mourning for Lord Byron," Mr. Cable substituted some Creole
        songs, which were received with great favor and heartily
        encored, to which he responded with the one he sang here at
        his former appearance. The best contribution he made to the
        evening's entertainment was Mary Richling's night ride,
        probably because of its serious contrast to the prevalent
        humorous tone of the programme. It was a fine rendering of
        a fine bit of descriptive writing, a real picture painted
        by an artist. Mark Twain is simply indescribable. The
        drollery of his appearance and manner invests the
        commonplace and wearisome with a freshness and comicality
        that is irresistible. The story of King Sollermun, printed
        in the last Century, is by no means easy reading. In cold
        type it seems to be trivial to the last degree; but as Mr.
        Clemens gave it last night, it set the audience in a
        perfect storm of boisterous merriment. His introductory
        dissertation on the peculiar grammatical construction of
        the German language, and the "whistling story" he told in
        answer to one of the furious encores given him, were his
        best numbers, although there was a verisimilitude about his
        conversation with the lady at the Lucerne Sweitzer-Rof,
        wherein they talked about old times of which he knew and
        remembered nothing, that appealed to everybody's experience
        in a like "trying situation." The last number of Twain, and
        of the programme, was the ghost story of the golden arm,
        which ended with a thump, starting everyone out of their
        seats at a quarter past 10 o'clock, after two hours of
        thoroughly enjoyable fun and sentiment. The large,
        intelligent and appreciative audience was an indication of
        the standing of these two writers in American literature as
        recognized in Indianapolis.</p>

          <b>THE TWAIN-CABLE COMBINATION.</b>
        </center><br />
        A very fine audience greeted Mr. George W. Cable and Mr.
        Samuel L. Clemens, at the Plymouth Church, last night, but
        not so large as the one they faced when here less than a
        month ago. This is to be accounted for, probably, because
        of the matinee in the afternoon, when the programme was the
        same as that given at night, and also because it is easy to
        have the taste palled with the peculiar entertainment they
        give. Mr. Cable's principle selections were from the
        Grandissimes, introducing the character of Ravel
        Innerarity, with his wonderful picture of "Louisiana
        Refusing to Enter the Union," and the announcement of his
        marriage as he changes boats on the beautiful waters of
        Lake Catharine. The preamble to this latter appearance of
        the Creole artist was a splendid bit of landscape painting,
        soft and sensuous with the beauty of that Southern sky, air
        and water in and about the chain of lakes forming the back
        water-way between New Orleans and the gulf. He again
        interpolated three of the creole love songs, and closed his
        part of the programme with "Mary's Night Ride," from Dr.
        Sevier, a bit of artistic work, eager and intense both in
        the writing and the reading. It is much the best thing Mr.
        Cable gave. Mark Twain was as funny as ever. His encounter
        with the newspaper interviewer, in which he broke down that
        redoubtable personage with his atrocious burlesques upon
        fact, put the audience in a mood to be tickled to death
        with the story of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer in their
        arrangement of "Jim's" escape from the cabin in accordance
        with the dramatic unities of history and romance; with the
        mistake of the Blue Jay, who attempted to fill up the
        dismantled cabin with acorns dropped through a knot-hole in
        the roof; and the story of his duel in Nevada, in which he
        was converted from a blood-thirsty hunter of men into a
        mild and cooing dove, who, having a controversy with a
        person now, would take him out quietly and talk with him,
        and reason with him -- and kill him. In answer to a furious
        encore, Twain gave the adventure of the miner's cat, which
        was blown up in a blast, and ever afterward exhibited an
        unconquerable aversion to quartz mining. As an entirety the
        evening was most enjoyable, and if it seemed less full of
        zest than the previous one, it was because the novelty had
        somewhat worn away, and not that the performance was below
        standard. The general verdict was expressed by a fair
        auditor in the gallery, who, while Mr. Twain was telling of
        his duel, gave a long-protracted half-musical shriek, dying
        away in a hysteria and a rupture of whalebone.
