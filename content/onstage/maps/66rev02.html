        The lecturer entertained the audience for about an hour,
        discoursing in an easy colloquial style, . . . seasoning a
        large dish of information with spicy anecdotes, depicting
        the lights and shades of Kanaka society with a freedom,
        vividness and humor quite delightful, rendering a just
        tribute to the laborious missionaries, . . . and sketching
        the magnificent scenery of the volcanic mountains with
        peculiar force.

        Mark--His Mission--Mark--not the apostle, but other of the
        twain, the missionary--made his advent . . . last evening.
        . . . Mark has been on a mission to the Sandwich Islands,
        and returning has rendered an account of his stewardship. .
        . . Mark was in good trim. Instead of having been made a
        meal of by the cannibals, . . . he came back to us in the
        flesh. . . . It was pleasant to listen to a lecturer who
        felt so well and talked so wisely, mixing (so to speak) as
        with a blender the pathetic with the humorous. There was
        more, however, of the humorous than the pathetic, and the
        transitions were so sudden that before a tear had time to
        gather head enough to fall, the laughing came in.
        Occasionally it was just the other way--the tears came from
        the overflow of laughter.
