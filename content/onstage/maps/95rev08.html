          He Pleases a Large Audience in Evans' Opera House.</b>

        Samuel L. Clemens, known to the world as Mark Twain, stood
        before an audience composed of some of the best people of
        Anaconda, in Evans' opera house last evening. The
        entertainment was characteristic, it was as original in
        style as are the writings of the man. It was not a lecture,
        not exactly readings, the author simply ascended the
        platform and began to talk as though he were in a parlor,
        and in the course of a one-sided conversation he told six
        or seven stories, one after the other, until an hour and a
        half went by and no one had noticed the time in its flight.

        <p>Mark Twain in a dress suit and an immaculate expanse of
        white shirt front has none of the slouchy appearance that
        his latest pictures give to him, on the contrary, he is
        spruce and trim. He has a shaggy bunch of iron-gray hair
        about his head, and his eyes are set deep under a broad
        forehead. He speaks with a twang and a drawl that is in
        keeping with his humor and would be amusing if he were
        speaking solemnly, but when it is used in telling funny
        stories it is more than amusing, it produces spontaneous
        laughter in every audience he has ever tried it on.
        Acaconda people were no exception, they are enjoyed the
        programme and will long remember the night they saw and
        heard Mark Twain.</p>
