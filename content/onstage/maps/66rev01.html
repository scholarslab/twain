        The Academy of Music was stuffed . . . to repletion. . . .
        It is perhaps fortunate that the King of Hawaii did not
        arrive in time to attend, for unless he had gone early he
        would have been turned away, as many others were who could
        not gain admittance.

        <p>The appearance of the lecturer was the signal for
        applause and from the time he commenced until he closed,
        the greatest good feeling existed. He commenced by
        apologizing for the absence of an orchestra, he wasn't used
        to getting up operas of this sort. He had engaged a
        musician to come and play the trombone, but, after the
        bargain was closed, the trombone player insisted upon
        having some other musicians to help him. He had hired the
        man to work, and wouldn't stand any such nonsense, and so
        discharged him on the spot. The lecturer then proceeded
        with his subject, and delivered one of the most interesting
        and amusing lectures ever delivered in this city. It was
        replete with information of that character which is seldom
        got from books, describing all those minor traits of
        character, custom and habits which are only noted by a
        close observer, and yet the kind of information which gives
        the most correct idea of the people described. Their
        virtues were set forth generously, while their vices were
        touched off in a humourous style, which kept the audience
        in a constant state of merriment. From the lecturer's
        reputation as a humorist, the audience were unprepared for
        the eloquent description of the volcano of Kilauea, a
        really magnificent piece of word-painting, their
        appreciation of which was shown by long and continued
        applause. Important facts concerning the resources of the
        Islands were given, interspersed with pointed anecdotes and
        side-splitting jokes. Their history, traditions, religions,
        politics, aristocracy, royalty, manners and customs were
        all described in brief and in the humorous vein peculiar to
        the speaker. . . . The lecturer held his audience
        constantly interested and amused for an hour and a half,
        and the lecture was unanimously pronounced a brilliant
        success. After its close, and the audience had risen to
        leave he was called out again, and in his funny style
        apologized for the "infliction," giving as an excuse that
        he was about writing a book on the Sandwich Islands, and
        needed funds for its publication.</p>

        <p>The lecture was superior to Artemus Ward's "Babes in the
        Woods" in point of humor. It evinced none of that straining
        after effect that was manifested by the great showman, and
        possessed some solid qualities to which Ward can make no
        pretensions. As a humorous writer Mark Twain stands in the
        foremost rank, while his effort of last evening affords
        reason for the belief that he can establish an equal
        reputation as a humorous and original lecturer.</p>

        At times he would soar to the sublime and his description
        of the volcano of Kilauea was as graphic and magnificent a
        piece of word painting as we have listened to for many a
        day. As an entirety, the lecture was preeminently humorous.
        There was, however, much information conveyed in this
        effort which never appeared in any history of the Hawaiian
        Islands. . . . Mark Twain has thoroughly established
        himself as the most piquant and humorous writer and
        lecturer on this coast since the days of the lamented "John
        Phoenix."

        <br />
        A rousing audience last Tuesday greeted St. Mark, the
        missionary, on the occasion of his first appearance on the
        lyceum stage--we were on the point of saying "on any
        stage," but having once travelled with him inside of Billy
        Wilson's from Virginia to Carson, candor compels us to
        sacrifice effect to accuracy. The Academy was packed from
        pit to dome, standing room crowded, while a number were
        unable to obtain admission. The audience embraced "our best
        people."

        <p>We had hoped to secure the lecturer's sermon to prepare
        our little notice of the occasion, but even his fine sense
        of humor is surpassed by his acute moral perception, and he
        declined on the score of unbecomingness to the missionary
        character--it would savor of the vanity of the flesh!
        Perhaps nothing in his career gives so vivid an impression
        of his uncompromising devotion to the principle as the
        refusal of our munificent proposition for a sonorous blast
        upon his own trumpet. Justice to ourselves compels us to
        mention our princely offer, that he should name his own
        terms. In justice to him we give his noble reply, "I
        believe it would be wrong, untold gold shall not tempt me."
        This grand utterance will be handed down to generations yet
        unborn, stimulating them to virtue, nerving them to resist
        the seduction of vice. The future school-boy shall learn to
        associate together these two sublime sentiments--one by the
        youthful Washington, "Father I cannot tell a lie!" the
        other by St. Mark, the missionary, "I believe it is wrong;
        gold cannot tempt me! . . . Pax tuiscum, sancto Marcus,
        missionarius."</p>

        <p>We regret to notice one serious fault--it was too short.
        It was exceedingly good what there was of it. In fact it
        could not well have been better, but its delivery occupied
        only an hour and fifteen minuters, while it appeared to the
        audience fifteen minutes without the hour. . . . If the
        missionary would appropriate half a column of any one of
        the recent <i>Alta</i>'s editorials upon the Hawaiian
        question, and judiciously interpolate it about the middle
        of his lecture it would rest the attention of the audience,
        and, while really not occupying five minutes in delivery,
        would effectively remove the impression of brevity. But
        really the lecture was "tip top," . . . interesting,
        instructive, . . . delivery happy, success complete.</p>

        <font size="-1">MARK TWAIN</font>--We regard this subject
        with mingled admiration and awe, and approach him with
        hesitation. Nature must have been in one of her funniest
        moods when she fashioned this mixture of the sublime and
        the ridiculous. The house was crowded when the festive
        juvenile sauntered bashfully, hand in pocket and mouth too
        full for utterance, to the position which he will grace
        till time interposes his restraining protest across the
        path of the successful humorist. Never did aspirant for
        public favor take more rapid stride than did the future
        historian of the Sandwich Islands on that momentous
        evening. Quote Artemus Ward no more; our Pacific slopes can
        discount him. True, he displayed not the polish of the
        finished lecturer--nor did he need it; the crude, quaint
        delivery was infinitely preferable. In original humor and
        the way of putting it, Artemus can hide his diminished
        Luminary under several bushels; he is as a penn'orth of
        tallow to a mammoth circus chandelier. It was a clever
        interruption of Twain's--that of apology. He wished to
        write a history of Kanakadom and needed the wherewithal. He
        did not state, however, the number of volumes required.
        Several, we hope, and a lecture to a volume.

        The genial lecturer entertained his audience with a
        mingling of fact, fun, and fancy, which was as delightful
        as it was instructive. Probably never before was so much
        actual information imparted in such an agreeable manner as
        in Mark's lecture, which might be called the sugar-coated
        pill of traveler's lore. This popular lecturer has struck a
        new lead in the vast field of literary research, and his
        multitudinous friends will all hope that his "prospects"
        will "pan out" rich.

        A highly intelligent and appreciative audience . . .
        assembled last night . . . to hear the last public lecture
        of Mark Twain, prior to his departure for "missionary
        labor" in other climes. The subject of the lecture and the
        droll humor of the lecturer have been so frequently
        commented on that further mention on those heads is, at
        present, needless. In every respect, whether in regard to
        the subject matter of the lecture, manner of delivery, and
        amendment of some blemishes apparent on the first occasion,
        the lecture was a decided success.
