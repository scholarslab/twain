        <p>T<font size="-1">WAIN'S</font> L<font size=
        "-1">ECTURE.</font>--Mark Twain was greeted Saturday
        evening by an audience that any man might be proud of. With
        a condition of streets that under ordinary circumstances
        would keep people by their firesides, Doolittle Hall was
        more completely filled than we remember ever to have seen
        it before on the occasion of a lecture. In fact, there was
        not sitting room enough, and the aisles were pretty well
        filled with chairs and benches. Twain appeared pretty
        punctually, attended by the chairman and a member of the
        lecture committee, both of whom he unceremoniously
        dismissed from the stage and took the programme into his
        own hands. After announcing the next lecture of the course
        by Prof. Winchell, on the "Stone Folk," under which head,
        as Twain remarked, the Cardiff Giant is included, Twain
        introduced himself in the following highly unique
        manner:</p>

        <p>"<i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i>.--The <i>next</i> lecture
        of the course will be delivered this evening by Samuel L.
        Clemens, otherwise Mark Twain, a gentleman whose high
        character and unimpeachable integrity are only equalled by
        his comeliness of person and grace of manner. And I am the
        man. You will excuse me for introducing myself, for I have
        just excused the chairman from introducing me. I know it's
        not the ordinary way, but the fact is I never yet have
        found a chairman of a lecture committee who was equal to
        the task of introducing me as I ought to be
        introduced."</p>

        <p>This decidedly original introduction was greeted with
        shouts of laughter and is a fair specimen of the vein in
        which the lecture on "Our Fellow Savages of the Sandwich
        Islands" was delivered. It was a good sample of his style
        of humor, and threw the audience into frequent convulsions
        of laughter. Twain is a fair looking model of humanity, and
        his manner is sufficient to provoke a smile. He talks with
        great deliberation and brings out his words with a nasal
        accent long drawn out which smacks of Yankeeism. Twain has
        roamed over the world considerable, and wherever the
        ridiculous side of human nature sticks out he has not
        failed to see and remember it. He is a humorist in the
        radical sense of the word, and his wit crystallizes around
        an atom of fun and makes it sparkle like a diamond.</p>

        <p>The lecture committee have given us two heavy
        lectures--Duryea's and Tilton's--and Twain's was thrown in
        at just the right nick of time to make the course rest a
        little easier on our stomachs, so to speak--like the wine
        after dinner.</p>
