          <b>MARK TWAIN.<br />
          The Great Humorist's Lecture at Washington Hall<br />
          Last Evening.<br />
          A Large and Well Pleased Audience.</b>
        </center>

        <p>Samuel L. Clemens, whose literary name is "Mark Twain,"
        delivered his Lecture on "Roughing It" in Nevada, last
        evening at Washington Hall. The hall was crowded with the
        most intelligent and refined people of the city, who had a
        high appreciation of the lecture, if we may judge from the
        almost continuous laughter and applause that greeted
        it.</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens came upon the stage without attendance, and
        introduced himself in a manner at once droll and novel. He
        always does this for reasons which he gives his audiences.
        In personal appearance he very much resembles the pictures
        that are meant to represent him in his great book,
        "Innocents Abroad," except that he don't wear the check
        trousers on the lecture stand that he wore in the holy
        land. He is a youngish-looking man of somewhere about
        thirty-five, not handsome, but having a bright and
        intelligent look, and eyes with a merry twinkle that put
        him at once <i>en rapport</i> with an audience, and that
        have a habit of snapping just as he comes to the crisis of
        the joke. He was dressed very neatly in a black suit, the
        upper garment being black frock coat, closely buttoned. He
        is clean shaven except with a heavy dark moustache; and his
        manner of wearing his hair, which is very abundant, shows
        that he is his own tonsorial artist. His style of oratory
        is not unlike that of Artemus Ward. He has the same dry,
        hesitating, stammering manner, and his face, aside from the
        merry light in his eyes, is as grave as the visage of an
        undertaker when screwing down the coffin lid. He appears to
        labor under some embarrassment in not knowing just how to
        dispose of his arms and hands, but this only heightens the
        drollery of his manner, and may merely be a "stage trick."
        If we remember aright Artemus Ward labored under a like
        difficulty, real or assumed.</p>
