          <b>Mark Twain's Lecture.</b>

        <p>Mr. Clemens, author of "The Innocents Abroad," gave an
        oral entertainment before the Lyceum, at the Town Hall,
        last Monday evening, on Artemus Ward. The speaker broke
        loose from red tape by introducing himself, and taking off,
        in an amusing manner, the encomiastic style of Lyceum
        presidents when discharging that formal duty of prefatory
        etiquette. The so-called lecture consisted of a collection
        of anecdotal beads, threaded with a constrained filament of
        tattered biography. How many of the laughable humorisms
        attributed to Artemus Ward were A. W's., and how many Mark
        Twain's, is a conundrum not easily guessed. Mr. Clemens's
        homely face, and drawling, tipsy style of speech, are
        somewhat against him, though we suppose they are natural.
        On the whole the patch-work entertainment was pleasing, and
        in our estimation, well worth $15,or even $20.</p>

          <b>Mark Twain's Lecture.</b>
        </center><br />

        <p>One of the largest and most critical audiences ever
        assembled in Malden, gathered in the Town Hall on Monday
        evening to listen to one of America's greatest humorists.
        The names of Nasby, Twain, Billings and Artemus Ward,
        suggest wit, humor and fun, and the anxiety to see and hear
        those whose profession, or rather whose mental
        characteristics are all turned to the absurd and comical
        side of things, is greater than to look upon celebrities of
        a severer cast. Mark Twain's book, "Innocents Abroad, or
        the new Pilgrim's Progress" has given him a world-wide
        reputation, and is pronounced the greatest work of its kind
        ever published in America. It has already realized a sale
        of upwards of 110,000 copies; an immense demand, and an
        evidence of its wonderful merits and attraction. Of course
        the author of such a work has long since become a "literary
        lion," and as such, a sight of him is considered an event.
        In order to "show him up" the lyceum platform becomes a
        cage whereon he can be exhibited. The lecture is the
        opportunity, and no matter whether he has a gift for
        oratory or not, no matter if he, (this "he" is the generic
        term for the whole class of peripatetic celebrities) is
        utterly devoid of all those graces and attractions which
        constitute an acceptable speaker, the people must see him.
        The more outre the better, as the lack of grace and finish
        is regarded as a proof of genius, and awkward gesticulation
        as the more natural method of impressing an audience.
        Taking this as the stand-point from which to view that
        class of lecturers of which "Mark Twain" is a specimen, we
        can readily understand the source of his attraction. His
        first lecture in Boston some two or three years ago,
        entitled "Our Fellow Savages in the Sandwich Islands," was
        immensely successful, principally on account of its oddity,
        crudeness, fun and complete contrast to those productions
        which usually find expression upon the platform. If Mark
        Twain had not secured a deserved reputation as one of the
        greatest humorists of the present century, by his book, his
        lectures would be considered as unfit to present to the
        enlightened and fastidious audiences of New England.</p>

        <p>His lecture on Monday evening was a medley of fact and
        fiction, garnished with stories and droll experiences of
        "Artemus Ward," whose real name was Charles F. Brown.
        Although the lecture was evidently intended as a
        biographial sketch of this remarkable man, it was so
        patched up that it was difficult to tell which was Ward and
        which was Twain. It served to keep the large audience in
        good humor, and whatever verdict each listener gave as to
        the merits or de-merits of the lecture, they were all
        gratified to see "Mark Twain."</p>

        <p>As a lecturer, he is awkward, uncouth, and his manner of
        speaking is such as to impress those who hear him for the
        first time that he is slightly inebriated. This however is
        one of the idiosyncracies of genius, and is as natural to
        him, as Josh Billing's style of walk and manner is peculiar
        to himself. Of the American Humorists -- Twain, Nasby and
        Billings, -- we regard the first as the least entertaining
        as a lecturer. Nevertheless, everybody was delighted to see
        and hear "Mark Twain."</p>
