          <b>Mark Twain's Lecture.</b>
        </center>

        <p>Artemus Ward wouldn't be a promising subject for a
        lecture in the hands of Charles Sumner, nor of any one not
        born with a genius for humor akin to that of Charles F.
        Browne; but Mr. Clemens gave the vast audience at Allyn
        Hall last night a long hour's hearty enjoyment, rippling
        into continual merriment and bursting often into hearty
        laughter. Indeed the lecture was over an hour long, and one
        of the best testimonies to its entertaining character was
        that the lecturer seemed to have been speaking not more
        than half an hour, and the close was a surprise to
        everybody, so rapt was the attention of the audience. There
        is not an abundance of material for a sketch of Artemus
        Ward, but Mr. Clemens made the most of it, and the slender
        thread of the narrative was a string for endless stories
        and happy hits, which illustrated the subject and kept the
        audience in a perpetual state of pleasant excitement. Mr.
        Clemens is infinitely droll in his manner of telling a
        story, and we doubt if the facetiae of Ward himself were
        ever so telling when he uttered them as they were last
        night in the repetition. The lecturer made to stand out
        very clearly the character of Artemus, the humbug showman,
        which Mr. Browne created; he did not cover the failings of
        the humorist, but he gave him credit for his manliness, his
        hatred of shams and pretensions; and in a very simple words
        he made very pathetic the story of his last days in London.
        The man who can give such an audience as that last evening
        an hour of innocent laughter is a public benefactor, and
        this we consider Mr. Clemens. No lecturer of the season has
        had such a hearty welcome.</p>
