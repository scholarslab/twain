      <br />
      The Twain and Cable entertainment given on Wednesday evening,
      Feb. 11, under the auspices of the U. L. A., was the most
      enjoyable which we have had here for several years. Twain
      fully met the expectations of his many admiring readers,
      adding the peculiar force of his recitations to the unlimited
      humor of his own compositions. Cable, though not as
      universally known to the audience as Twain, was received with
      high expectations. He proved himself the peer of his
      companion in the humorous, while he excelled in the pathetic
      at which Twain made no attempt. Cable's elocutionary ability
      is of the first rank; his rendition of "Mary's Ride" was an
      excellent model recitation. The audience was unanimous in the
      expression of satisfaction, while T. &amp; C. were equally
      well pleased with the appreciation shown by the audience. In
      spite of the extreme cold, the entertainment netted a
      handsome profit for U. L. A.</td>
