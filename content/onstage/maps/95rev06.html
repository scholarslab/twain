          Delighted a Large Audience Last Night at the Opera

        The inimitable Mark Twain, who has chased away somber
        thoughts and straightened out the creases in millions of
        brows by his quaint humor, visited Great Falls for the
        first time yesterday. He was accompanied by his wife and
        daughter and Maj. Pond, who is so well known as the veteran
        lecture bureau man. Mrs. Pond also accompanies the party,
        who are bent on making a trip around the world.

        <p>The lecture last night was attended by the best people
        in the city and thoroughly enjoyed by them. It was largely
        made up from selections from his works. The quaintness and
        originality of the man and his manner gave an added charm
        to the stories. The finale of the lecture was a ghost
        story, which ended with a surprise to the audience, and
        illustrated as well perhaps as anything the peculiar humor
        of the man.</p>

        <p>After the lecture Mr. Clemens (Mark Twain) and Maj. Pond
        were the guests of the Electric club, and it is unnecessary
        to say that they had a jolly good time.</p>
