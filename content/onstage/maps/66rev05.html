      Reprehensible--The gentleman who enjoys a wide celebrity on
      this coast as a spicy writer, over the "<i>nom de plume</i>"
      of "Mark Twain" delivered his lecture on the "Sandwich
      Islands," in this city on Monday evening last. While we
      accord to him the merit of being a spicy writer, candor
      compels us to say that as a lecturer he is not a success. We
      say this with no desire to be captious, but simply because it
      is literally true. As a newspaper correspondent Mark Twain is
      a racy and humorous writer, but as a lecturer he falls below
      mediocrity. In this connection we think it is not
      inapproriate to address ourself to the editorial fraternity
      on this Coast, and to our San Francisco contemporaries in
      particular, in relation to the reprehensible practice of
      disguising the truth in reference to the qualifications and
      ability of persons who sell their talents for a valuable
      consideration, and too frequently "sell" those who go to hear
      them, innocently expecting to be instructed or amused.</td>
