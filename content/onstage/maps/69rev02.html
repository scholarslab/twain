        <p>Mark Twain discoursed about the Sandwich Islands for an
        hour last night at the Music Hall, and although at the
        early part of the lecture there was evidently some
        disappointment, he soon was in favor with his hearers, and
        the last two-thirds of the production were richly enjoyed.
        Mr. Clemens is truly an original lecturer, his manner being
        as unique as his matter. He spoke without notes, walked
        about the stage most of the time, and was dry and droll,
        serious and even pathetic. His matter was a series of
        surprises, it being difficult for the listener to know what
        was earnest and what was fun. His most ludicrous jokes were
        related with a serious air, that imparted a fresh flavor to
        them. The entertainment, for such indeed it was, was a very
        enjoyable one, so enjoyable and peculiar that all attempts
        to describe it would fail. The hearty applause given
        indicated that the audience were pleased.</p>

        </center><br />
        Boston had a very novel, if not a very startling, sensation
        last evening in the shape of a lecture from Mr. Samuel L.
        Clemens, who is known to fame as the humorist Mark Twain.
        Known to fame, we say, for who that breathes the vital air
        in America has not heard of the jumping frog of Calaveras
        County, California? and who has not read of the "new
        specimen" which Mark Twain made by combining a hawk and a
        crow in "one neat job"? A company, even greater than that
        which usually attends the Bureau lectures, assembled in the
        Music Hall that night with faces primed for merriment, and
        punctually to the hour Mr. Clemens and Mr. Redpath appeared
        upon the platform. This was of course, and it was also of
        course that for fifteen minutes afterwards the speaker's
        voice should be made inaudible by the rustling and creaking
        and tramping of the regular crowd of the tardy.

        <p>Mark Twain is a very good looking man. He is of medium
        height and moderately slender build, has light brown hair,
        a reddish brown moustache, regular features and a fresh
        complexion; and he has a queer way of wrinkling up his nose
        and half closing his eyes when he speaks. The expression of
        his face is as calm and imperturbable as that of the
        sphinx. Looking at him you feel it to be an impossibility
        that he should ever hurry or ever be out of temper, and you
        might suppose him to be incapable of a joke, if it were not
        for the peculiar twinkle in his merry eyes. His voice is
        remarkably light and remarkably dry--like some German
        wines--and it seems to be modulated to only two keys. His
        style of speaking is unique to the last degree. It is all
        of a piece with the quality of his humor, and fits him like
        a glove. He delivers his sentences without haste, and in a
        tone of utter indifference, marking the highest waves of
        his thought only by a strong flavor of nasality, and
        knowing for the most part only the rising inflection at the
        beginning, middle and end of his sentences. The rising
        inflection is not native here, nor is it born in the manner
        of any of our own speakers. Mr. Dickens first taught us how
        it might be used to advantage; and Mark Twain, doubtless
        without borrowing a leaf from Mr. Dickens's note-book, has
        found out for himself how effective an adjunct it is to
        humorous speech. In short, the platform manner of Mr.
        Clemens is the exact reflection in speech of his peculiar
        style of composition. The fun of both is genuine enough;
        but the perception of the fun is unmeasurably heightened by
        the apparently serious intention of the general discourse,
        and at times by an air of half seriousness in the joke
        itself. The audience gets into a queer state after a while.
        It knows not what to trust; for while much is meant to be
        seriously taken, the fun is felt to be the real life of the
        thing; and yet they never know where the fun will come in.
        Even when Mr. Clemens has made a really fine period, or
        introduced a brilliant descriptive passage, he takes pains
        to turn the affair into a joke at the end. As, for
        instance, after a very graphic and well written description
        of the great volcanic eruption in the Sandwich Islands,
        delivered with perfect indifference and almost as if with
        an effort--he paused for just an instant, and then said in
        the same passionless tone--"There! I'm glad I've got that
        volcano off my mind." The manner is a direct resultant of
        the matter; and the manner of his speech does a great deal
        for the substance of his discourse. The story of "Our
        Fellow-Savages in the Sandwich Islands" would not be nearly
        so funny to read as it is to hear from Mark Twain's
        lips;--though we do not mean to deny that there is a great
        deal of genuine and irresistible humor in the texture of
        the discourse. Indeed, we mean to say, distinctly, that the
        contrary was the fact, and that Mr. Clemens showed himself
        last night in the character of a very quaint, peculiar, and
        eminently original humorist. America has produced, at
        least, a quintette of genuine humorists, whose productions
        have many of the <i>indicia</i> of genius, if they are not
        wholly inspired by it.</p>

        <p>We are obliged to say again, as we said in the cases of
        Nasby and Josh Billings, that there is little use in trying
        to write a sketch of the discourse. But we must attempt to
        give our readers a little taste of the speaker's quality.
        Mr. Clemens devoted the first ten minutes of his lecture to
        a painfully accurate description of a person afflicted with
        the most loathsome form of Oriental leprosy; and then he
        gave five minutes to the narration of a boyish adventure
        which ended in his seeing the horrible face of a dead man
        in the moonlight. And all this mass of horror for what?
        Simply that he might say that his memory was full of
        unpleasant things so linked together that when he thought
        of one he inevitably thought of another, and so on through
        the entire series; and starting with leprosy and dead faces
        in the moonlight his mind necessarily ran through other
        unpleasant things until it brought him to the Sandwich
        Islands and his lecture. The position of the islands he
        gave geographically; but why they were placed so far away
        from everything and in such an inconvenient space, he
        declined to consider. The man who would have discovered the
        islands but did not, he said, was diverted from his course
        by a manuscript found in a bottle; and this, said Mark
        Twain, is not the only case in which a man has been turned
        from the true path by suggestions drawn from a bottle. The
        European nations brought into the islands their own
        diseases, together with civilization, education and other
        calamities. The effect of this had been to diminish the
        native population;--education in particular causing a
        frightful mortality as the facilities for learning were
        multiplied. But fifty thousand natives are now left upon
        the islands, and it is proposed to start a few more
        seminaries to finish them. The country people of the
        islands, the women, he said, wear a single garment made of
        one piece; "and the men don't." But when the weather is
        inclement the men wear cotton in their ears. The
        hospitality of the people he declared to be of a very high
        and generous order. A stranger might enter any house and
        straightway his host would set before him raw fresh fish
        with the scales on, baked dogs, fricasseed cats, and all
        the luxuries of the season. But in trade they were
        exceedingly sharp and deceitful,--lying invariably from one
        end of the transaction to the other; not descending to
        common lies either, but indulging in lies that are
        "gorgeously imposing and that awe you by their grandeur."
        The fondness of the islanders for dogs he declared to be
        intense. Dogs had the best of everything and were the close
        companions of the men. "They fondle and caress the dog
        until he is a full grown dog, and then they eat him." "I
        couldn't do that," said Mr. Clemens, in one of his dryest
        and funniest passages; "I'd rather go hungry two days than
        eat an old personal friend in that way."</p>

        <p>At one point in his lecture, namely, in the midst of a
        discussion of cannibalism, Mark Twain paused and said with
        an indescribable look: "At this point I usually illustrate
        cannibalism before the audience: but I am a stranger here,
        and feel diffident about asking favors." However, he said,
        if there is any one present who is willing to contribute a
        baby for the purposes of the lecture, I should be glad to
        know it now. I am aware, though, that children have become
        scarce and high of late, having been thinned out by neglect
        and ill treatment since the woman movement began.</p>

        <p>But we must leave the rest to the imagination of our
        readers, only saying that Mr. Clemens told two of the
        funniest of exaggerated stories in the most irresistible
        fashion, and concluded his lecture with a few graceful
        words of thanks to the audience for their attention.
        Perhaps he is not a great humorist, but he is a genuine
        humorist. The man who can say that the Islanders' dish of
        plain dog "is only our cherished American sausage with the
        mystery removed" is one whose reputation fame will not
        suffer to die; and if Mr. Clemens can please everywhere as
        he pleased in Boston last night, he will be sure to make
        his fortune if he does not become a standard author.</p>
