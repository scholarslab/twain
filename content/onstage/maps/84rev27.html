        The second entertainment of the Star Course was given last
        night before a full house. The entertainment consisted of
        readings by Mark Twain and Geo. W. Cable from their own
        works. The entertainment in itself was good, the reading,
        with one exception, being very funny and well rendered. But
        what the mass of people went for was to see the two
        gentlemen themselves. The readings from any one else would
        not, perhaps, have been so entertaining, but Twain in his
        intensely humorous way of acting and talking, and Cable
        with his Irish brogue and mimicry were very much relished.
        Mark Twain's readings were all humorous, his story of the
        reporter interviewing him being greeted with roars of
        laughter and applause. Mr. Cable rendered several parts of
        his works, entitled "Dr. Sevier." They were chiefly in an
        Irish brogue which Mr. Cable imitates almost to perfection.
        Mr. Cable's last reading, entitled "Mary's Night Ride," was
        a thrilling tale of a woman's ride for life through the
        Confederate lines during the war. The piece was rendered in
        a highly dramatic manner and took the house by storm.
