          <b>Mark Twain and Mr. Cable.</b>
        </center><br />
        George W. Cable, the novelist, and Samuel L. Clemens, known
        to the world as Mark Twain, entertained a very large
        audience, last evening, at Music Hall, in the fifth of the
        Bay State course. Mr. Cable gave selections from his own
        writings. He was in admirable voice and some of the touches
        reminded one of some of the best passages of Dickens. To
        see Mark Twain is to laugh and to hear him is to laugh
        still more. His drollery is perennial, always fresh and
        always entertaining. His struggle with the German language
        and his trying conversation with the young American lady in
        the hotel dining-room at Lucerne were especially funny,
        while the ghost story had a startling conclusion.

        <p>Rev. Henry Ward Beecher appears in the next
        entertainment of the course, next Thursday evening.</p>

        &nbsp; Music hall was crowded full Thursday evening to
        listen to the unique entertainment in the Old Bay State
        course given by Mark Twain and George W. Cable, who read
        from their own works. It was a most enjoyable evening. The
        great humorist is inimitable in his natural manner of
        reciting his and other people's adventures. He is one of
        the most successful entertainers of the time. Mr. Cable is
        amateurish in his manner, but the dialects of his
        characters are given well, and all that he says is clear
        and intelligible. He was received with marked favor, and in
        response to an encore at the close of one of his
        selections, sung a volksong in a language unfamiliar to the
        audience, but as he prefaced the singing with a translation
        of the words, the number was exceedingly pleasing. His
        tenor voice is sweet and strong, and it is evident that the
        novelist is a musician also. There are such marked
        contrasts in the style of the two authors, and both are so
        interesting, that it would be hard to find another
        combination of talent so satisfactory in a long
        programme.<br />

          <b>LECTURES AND READINGS.</b>
        </center><br />
        &nbsp; <i>The Twain-Cable Entertainment</i>--the fifth in
        the Union Course--at the Music Hall last evening, drew a
        very large audience, and, judging from the frequent
        applause, was highly successful. Mr. Cable's voice has
        gained in volume since his last appearance here, but it is
        still hardly equal to the capacity of the great auditorium,
        and, on the whole, he was not heard with so much
        satisfaction as in Chickering Hall. But he has so improved
        in elocution and in dramatic expression that when he reads
        he now gives to each character a pronounced individuality
        that adds much to the general effect. What seemed, however,
        to please his audience best was his singing of a number of
        those quaint songs peculiar to the creoles of New Orleans.
        He read selections from his novel, "Dr. Sevier," including
        Richling's visit to Kate Riley, an interview between Kate
        Riley and Ristofolo, and Narcisse in mourning for Lady
        Byron. Mr. Clemens, who has not been seen on the platform
        in eight years, received a warm welcome as his frowzled
        head appeared from the ante-room. He read selections from
        his new book, now in press, in which "Huckleberry Finn"
        again figures; narrated his struggles with the German
        language and its unreasonable genders, described his
        adventure with the young woman at Lucerne whom he pretended
        to know, and gave other samples of his odd humor. Mr. Cable
        and Mr. Clemens alternated in the programme, an arrangement
        admirably suited to this sort of combination entertainment.
        For the sixth entertainment, next Thursday, a lecture by
        Rev. Henry Ward Beecher is announced.<br />
