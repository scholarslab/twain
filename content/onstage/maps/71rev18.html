        <p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size=
        "-1">WAIN'S</font> lecture drew a large audience, though on
        a stormy night. We regret to add that the listeners were
        generally disappointed. The speaker announced that he was
        tired of the Ward lecture, and had just compiled a new one
        from his forthcoming book. The result was a hash of
        anecdotes, jokes and descriptions which would have been
        considered good as part of a well arranged lecture, but
        made themselves rather thin diet for an evening's
        entertainment. Mr. Clemens is a writer of ability, his
        published work shows that; and his lecture here two years
        ago was very satisfactory. In appearing this season with
        such evident lack of careful preparation, making a tour "on
        his reputation," as the showmen say, he does injustice both
        to himself and the societies employing him.</p>
