        <p>Mr. S. T. Clemens, otherwise more commonly known as Mark
        Twain, delivered his lecture on "Artemus Ward, Humorist,"
        last Tuesday evening, before the lecture association. One
        of the largest audiences of the season had assembled, drawn
        together partly out of curiosity, considerably on account
        of the notoreity of "Innocents Abroad," and largely for the
        purpose of having a good laugh. All appeared satisfied when
        the lecture closed. A critical review of the lecture would
        be as absurd as to adopt "Innocents Abroad" as a textbook
        for classes in history. There are but few men that could
        present and illustrate properly the subject of that
        lecture. And Twain is "one of the few the immortal" ones
        who can do it in an eminently successful manner. The
        lecture was for the most part narrative and illustrative in
        character, but the occasional scintillations from the
        lecturer himself showed that his reputation has not been
        gained without true merit. He drew finely and accurately
        the character of Artemus Ward, and described his death in a
        vivid and effective manner. There were but few of the
        audience who did not enter into a nearer sympathy with the
        great humorist through the sketch of his life which the
        lecturer produced. One of the strikingly amusing features
        was the fact that the lecturer introduced himself in a
        novel and entertaining manner. The applause throughout
        showed the appreciation which the lecture deserved, but the
        manifest boorishness of certain members of the professional
        departments and others, previous to the opening of the
        lecture, was a fact to be regretted and severely
        reproved.</p>
