        advertisement, Mark Twain delivered his wonderful lecture,
        on the Sandwich Islands, at the Mercantile Library Hall
        last night. The audience was large and appreciative, and
        financially and every other way the entertainment proved a
        complete success. In fact, Mark Twain achieved a very
        decided success. He succeeded in doing what we have seen
        Emerson and other literary magnates fail in attempting. He
        interested and amused a large and promiscuous audience.</p>

        <p>Mark has the gift of a bright and happy fancy, and
        expresses his thoughts with no ordinary force and
        gracefulness of language. His descriptive powers are good,
        and his descriptive powers very fair for a young
        lecturer.</p>

        <p>We shall attempt no synopsis of his entertainment.
        Ostensibly it was on the Sandwich Islands, but while it
        contained not a little valuable information and many
        passages of felicitious description, it also embraced many
        other topics geographically and otherwise foreign to the
        matter in hand, and had many a piquant piece of humor
        interwoven, which, with the bright flash of genuine wit,
        startled with laughter and kept alive the attention of the
        audience. As to the wonderful [feats?] promised in the
        advertisement they were forgotten in the intellectual
        amusement afforded; and in the minor matter of swallowing a
        child Mark failed to come to time, possibly because no lady
        volunteered an infant for the occasion. We did not learn
        who was lucky enough to win Lafayette Park.</p>

        <p>Our readers are aware this lecture was delivered for the
        benefit of the South St. Louis Mission Sunday School -- a
        most worthy object and certainly calling for the patronage
        of the Christian community.</p>

        <p>This evening the lecture will be repeated at the same
        place and for the same object. Let all go who wish to be
        instructed and amused, and at the same time assist a
        deserving cause. "The wisdom will begin to flow at eight
        o'clock, and not a drop should be lost."</p>

          TUESDAY NIGHT.</b>
        </center><br />

        <p>A gentleman stepped on the stage and announced that
        wisdom would commence to flow precisely at eight o'clock.
        To while away the time till then, he said he "would treat
        them with a whistling, which some called foolish," and a
        song, "The moon shines bright," both of which won loud and
        prolonged applause. Precisely at eight o'clock, at
        previously announced, the veritable Mark Twain himself
        appeared, to the great delight of the audience. As he
        informed the audience, he had been residing in the Sandwich
        Islands. Being one of the wandering Bohemians, he had
        devoted his time to obtaining information to let the public
        know of the result of his travels. After his residence
        there, he was well-qualified to deliver an interesting,
        instructive and amusing lecture. He certainly succeeded in
        making it all three. His remarks were witty and humorous.
        He kept his audience in a roar of laughter and a perpetual
        chuckle. His wit was not of the evanescent kind. One was
        not obliged to be always on the qui vive to catch the
        brilliant flashes of wit that he dealt with so much ease.
        Neither was it of that kind which Douglas Jerrold defines
        dogmatism, "puppyism come to maturity."</p>

        <p>He was decidedly humorous also. He did not cut the
        audience short. His humor was tangible, and the laugh
        raised at the first hearing of his remarks died not away
        with the conclusion of the sentence. One seemed to be
        chuckling incessantly, and with faces wreathed in smiles,
        the audience listened for the next remarks, which increased
        the chuckles to a hearty laugh.</p>

        <p>He commenced his lecture on the Sandwich Islands by
        stating: "That when at Julesberg, which is about four
        hundred miles west of St. Louis, he heard a little anecdote
        of Horace Greeley, going to lecture at Carson, from a man
        who said he was afraid that he would be too late to hear
        him. Further westward still, he heard the same anecdote, or
        a pleasing incident about the mail service, in connection
        with Horace Greeley, and again he heard it in Nevada, or
        was about to hear it, when he stopped the story teller, and
        inquired of him, if the anecdote was about Horace Greeley,
        the mail service, the lecture and Carson City. On being
        told it was, he declined hearing it. On coming east, he had
        seen that anecdote in almost every newspaper, but he had
        not heard it in St. Louis, and therefore he thought he
        would tell it, as a pleasing incident about the mail
        service, in connection with Horace Greeley going to lecture
        at Carson City. . . .</p>

        <p>The talented young lecturer closed his flow of wisdom,
        by stating that by an inadvertence, he had forgotten to
        inform his appreciative audience "that the Reverend Robert
        Colyer was lecturing at the Philharmonic hall, and it
        seemed by that omission he had swindled the reverend
        gentleman out of a crowd." Everyone retired highly
        delighted with the irrepressible Californian.</p>
