          <b>Cable and Twain's Reading</b>
        </center><br />

        <p>Despite the rain there was a large audience at
        Leiderkranz Hall last night to hear Cable and Mark Twain
        read. Mr. Cable last year prepared for himself a welcome to
        Louisville, and the people were ready with a hearty
        greeting for Mr. Clemens.</p>

        <p>Mr. Cable's selections were familiar to the audience, as
        was the manner of his interpretation, but they lost none of
        their charm on this account. "Narcisse" and "Kate Riley"
        and "Richling" and "Restofalo" delighted every one last
        night with their strange and fascinating humor, of which
        one never wearies, but the most striking and effective of
        the pieces recited by Mr. Cable was "Mary Richling's Night
        Ride." There is no more pathetic, no more moving story in
        all Mr. Cable has written than that which recounts the
        weary wandering of "Mary Richling." Caught in the North
        when the war broke over the land with her child, whom her
        husband has never seen, she started for New Orleans,
        confident she could somewhere pierce the line. One
        disappointment followed another, but the brave-hearted
        woman never lost courage. Finally it seemed all obstacles
        were conquered, and, under the guidance and protection of a
        spy, she rode through the lines, avoiding the pickets and
        escaping the scouts. It is this last ride Mr. Cable reads
        with such dramatic force, and it is wise to repeat it
        to-night.</p>

        <p>Mark Twain's humor is indescribable, as it is
        inimitable. His "Tragic Tale of a Fishwife," in its wild
        absurdities and extravagant incongruities, was greeted with
        continuous laughter, the appreciation of the situation, no
        doubt, being heightened by the recollection that last
        winter there was in Louisville a professor who promised to
        teach the German language in six weeks, and in the audience
        there were several score who once thought they had learned
        it in that time. Mark Twain promises to-night, in addition
        to regular programme, to tell the story of the "Jumping
        Frog." There should be to-night even a larger audience than
        on last night, and it is to be hoped those who secure seats
        in advance will obtain them, and the annoyance experienced
        last night be avoided.</p>

        <p>The following is the programme for this evening:</p>

        Mr. Cable at Leiderkranz Hall drew a crowded house last
        night. The evening was in every way delightful and both
        gentlemen were applauded again and again. Mark Twain's
        story of "How he Ceased to be an Editor" and Mr. Cable's
        account of "Mary Richling's Midnight Ride" were the hits of
        the evening.
