          <b>MARK TWAIN. Roughing It at Library Hall.</b>
        </center><br />

        <p>Mark Twain gave his new lecture "Roughing It" at Library
        Hall last night. The audience upon the occasion, evinced in
        a melancholy degree the truth of the oft quoted assertion
        that the "public are fickle," for when the genial humorist
        and man who, by his own confession, says he <i>can</i> tell
        a lie, but <i>wont</i>, appeared in our city the last time
        there were many who registered secret and open vows that
        they never would hear him again being so influenced, partly
        from the fact that his lecture then was not altogether so
        brilliant as was anticipated, and partly perhaps because of
        the exhaustion produced from the merriment occasioned by
        the few "humorous remarks" he then did make. The vows were
        doubtless meant to be kept, and may be they were; but
        somehow there seemed to be no dimunition of the familiar
        faces at Library Hall last night, and the company being
        further increased by a large concourse who do not generally
        find attraction in the lecture hall, the consequence was
        that Mark was greeted with an immeasurably larger audience
        than he had heretofore looked upon in Pittsburgh, and one
        which in every respect has never perhaps been excelled.
        Some of the people dropped in on Wednesday evening, it is
        said to "be in time to get a seat." We don't endorse that,
        but certainly a great many dropped in quite early last
        evening, and they kept coming until there was no room in
        the parquette, nor in the parquette circle, nor in the
        balcony, nor in the gallery away back, and then the aisles
        were filled with ladies and gentlemen standing and the
        boxes, even the highest tier could hold no more, and the
        stage last of all provided accommodation for over a
        hundred. There would still have been many more in
        attendance, but they couldn't get in nor within earshot of
        the speaker, and they formed a mournful procession on the
        retreat.</p>

        <p>The lecturer was somewhat late in coming and in response
        to the occasional expressions of impatience from the
        audience, Mr. W. N. Howard about eight o'clock announced
        that he had arrived in the city but half an hour previous,
        and was then winding his devious way through Pittsburgh's
        thoroughfares to the hall. Twenty minutes later a small
        man, with half-shut dreamy eyes, and a queer, comical
        expression of countenance, as if its possessor was in doubt
        whether to laugh or cry, the mouth on the upper side
        trimmed in with a short, thick, sandy-colored moustache and
        the chin barren of any hirsute adornment -- a little man
        arrayed in a black dress suit and supporting a glittering
        diamond ring on one finger, quietly edged his way through
        the crowd on the stage, and so quickly that he stood in the
        centre of the small space reserved for the lecturer before
        the audience knew what the movement meant. He introduced
        himself as Mark Twain, adopting as he said that method of
        getting in all the facts before proceeding with the details
        of his discourse.</p>

        <p>Then audience then for an hour and a quarter were
        treated to a literary compound of brilliant description and
        hard material facts, giving the romance and reality of
        "roughing it" in Nevada, and all picturesquely interwoven
        with jokes and happy strokes of wit, which came so frequent
        and were to transparent that the merriment seemed hardly
        for an instant to cease. And then the most consummate
        stroke of all was that of which five reporters were made
        the victims -- five indefatigable pencil destroyers, who
        for all that hour and a quarter, repressing every outflow
        of humor, had sedately toiled at their craft and retired
        elate with the prospect of the rich feast in store for
        their readers to-day -- prospects which were, alas,
        dispelled by a call from the genial joker himself, who
        suavely preferred his request for a suppression of the
        "notes" taken, for the good of the community and the
        happiness of himself, as he "traveled some on those
        remarks." A brother journalist could not be denied, and
        thus the vision melted away.</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens seemed to be in his happiest vein last
        night, and never in manner or matter compressed more that
        was enjoyable. His "roughing it" in the lecture field has
        evidently given him a new insight into popular feeling, of
        which he has not been slow to avail himself. The effort
        financially to the managers, happily to the lecturer, and
        enjoyably in the highest degree to the people, was a signal
        success, which has doubly increased the hold of the
        humorist on popular favor in this community.</p>

        <p>The next lecture of the course will be delivered on
        Tuesday evening next by Olive Logan, who will <a name="a"
        id="a">talk of</a> "Nice Young Men."</p>

          <b>MARK TWAIN. The Lecture Last Evening.</b>
        </center>

        <p>Library Hall was crowded to repletion last evening, to
        listen to Mark Twain's lecture, "Roughing It." The
        gentleman did not arrive in the city until a short time
        before the hour announced for his appearance, and the
        consequence was that the large audience was kept in waiting
        for some time before Mr. Twain made his appearance. He was
        preceded by Mr. Howard, of the Lecture Committee, who
        announced that the next lecture of the course would be
        delivered on Tuesday evening by Olive Logan, when she will
        discourse on "Nice Young Men."</p>

        <p>On making his appearance Mr. Twain introduced himself in
        a very humorous manner. He then gave some very interesting
        descriptions of life in Nevada, its mountains, lakes and
        rivers; the inhabitants, soil, birds, beasts, &amp;c.,
        which were most pleasantly interwoven with a series of
        telling jokes, humorous hits, and apparently unconsciously
        delivered sallies of wit which convulsed the entire
        audience in the most uproarious laughter. To publish one of
        the lecturer's humorous points would be but to debar a host
        of the readers of the C<font size="-1">OMMERCIAL</font> in
        other cities in this vicinity, where Mr. Clemens will
        appear, from enjoying them as they fall from the lecturer's
        lips.</p>

        <p>All present last evening appeared to thoroughly enjoy
        "Roughing It," and manifested their delight in the most
        effective manner. Mr. Clemens lectures in Kittanning
        to-night.</p>
