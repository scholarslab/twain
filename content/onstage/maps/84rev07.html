      -- The unique entertainment given by Mark Twain and George W.
      Cable at Music Hall last evening was attended by an audience
      which filled nearly every seat on the floor and in the
      galleries. Mr. Cable has taken his place among the best
      American novelists and has created a unique and striking
      original style of story. There was much curiosity, therefore,
      to see the author of the Creole tales which have won such
      remarkable popularity with the reading public of late years.
      Mr. Cable is not a handsome man, but his face and head show
      an active intellect and a vivid imagination. His recitations,
      which were all taken from his strongest work, "Dr. Sevier,"
      were delivered in a striking and pleasing though not artistic
      manner. His singing of Creole songs was warmly applauded.
      Mark Twain, though laboring under a severe cold, managed to
      make himself heard by the large audience, which showed a
      disposition to laugh whether he spoke or was silent. There
      was nothing remarkably witty in his remarks, but his manner
      and the humorous expression of his mouth and eyes would
      create laughter if he should read an act of congress to an
      audience. Altogether, the entertainment was pleasing, not
      only from its novelty, but from the originality of the men
      who conducted it. It did not drag, and the audience as it
      retired at 10:45 o'clock was by no means weary of listening
      to the pathos and humor of Cable and the laughable remarks of
      Mark Twain. A literary entertainment is a success if the
      auditors remain in their places to the end. Few, if any, left
      the hall last evening till they were startled from their
      seats by the sudden ending of Mark Twain's ghost story.</td>
