<br />

<p>Mark had a crowded house last night.  Tacoma's very best people were out in force to listen to
him, and they were ready to laugh upon the slightest provocation.  That is, the most of them were.
There were some very intelligent people in the audience who were unable to swing into line with
Mark's peculiar kind of humor and they looked tired, too tired even to smile.  But he tickled the
risibilities of all the rest, and they enjoyed themselves thoroughly and paid no attention to the
folks who were too opaque to appreciate the fun.  His evening in Tacoma was a big success.</p>
