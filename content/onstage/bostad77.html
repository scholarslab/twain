<title>Daily Advertiser Report of Whittier Dinner</title>
</head>

<body background="../bkgrnd2.gif">

<font size="+1"><b>from the <i>Boston Daily Advertiser</i><br />
18 December 1877</b></font><br /><br />
<table align="center" width="600">

<p>If a painter could have caught for his canvas the picture presented when the hosts and guests
were all seated, the scene would, as reality, have rivalled the imaginary one of Shakespeare and
his friends.  At the head of the table sat the chief host, Mr. H.O. Houghton.  At his right was the
honored guest and centre of loyal, loving interest, Mr. Whittier.  Next to him sat the Concord
philsopher, and at Mr. Emerson's right was Mr. Longfellow.  The trio -- Whittier, Emerson,
Longfellow -- gave a reverend, almost holy air to the place, and their gray hairs and expressive,
joyful faces formed a beautiful group.  On Mr. Houghton's left was Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes;
next to him was Mr. William D. Howells, the editor of the magazine, and at the extreme left, Mr.
Charles Dudley Warner.</p>

<p>[<i>As part of its report the </i>Daily Advertiser <i>reprinted MT's speech, under the
heading "Mark Twain's Remarks," but made no comment on it.</i>]</p>
