<center><h2>Major Pond's Tour Photos</h2></center>

<p>Major and Mrs. Pond accompanied MT, his wife and his daughter Clara on the North
American segment of MT's world tour.  In the Barrett Collection is a 100-year old Kodak film
envelope with 32 photographs taken by Pond along the way, with captions on the backs that
seem to be by the Major himself.  Here, in chronological order, are 8 of them, with those
captions.  (Pond also kept a journal of the trip.  The links within the captions are to the relevant entries in that journal.  By reading them, for example, you learn that the walk MT took at Great Falls was the first time on the trip he had felt well enough to venture into the local countryside.)</p>
