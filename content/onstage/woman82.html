<br />On Plymouth Rock Again. The Pilgrims Sons Talking of Their Forefathers. New-England
men in
New-York Congratulating Themselves and the Country on Their Ancestors' Virtues and the
Resultant
Blessings.</b>

<p>The seventy-seventh annual dinner of the New-England Society of New-York was given at
Delmonicos last evening, and about 250 gentlemen, members of the society and their friends,
braved the
inclement weather and celebrated the two hundred and sixty-second anniversary of the landing of
the
Pilgrims by attending the banquet. The banquet hall was decorated simply with American flags
and
streamers, and the shields of the 11 original States were scattered in convenient positions about the
walls.
The raised table for the officers and distinguished guests extended along the entire western end of
the
room, and below this five lower tables stretched down the hall. These, however, were found
insufficient to
accommodate the large number of guests, and one of the parlors was transformed into a
dining-room, in
which covers were laid for about 25 of the guests. A string band enlivened the dinner with popular
music.
Josiah M. Fiske, President of the Society, presided at the dinner, supported on the left by Gen.
U.S. Grant,
and on the right by Joseph B. Choate. The other guests at the principal table were Senator Miller,
of
California; Gov. John D. Long, of Massachusetts; Gen. Horace Porter, Samuel L. Clemens,
(Mark Twain),
the Rev. J. R. Paxton, Commodore Upshur, of the Brooklyn Navy Yard; Col. W.T. Villas, of
Madison,
Wis.; Gov. Hobart V. Bigelow, of Connecticut; Mayor Grace, Benjamin D. Stillman, President of
the Brooklyn New-England Society; Judge Abram R. Lawrence, Chauncey M. Depew, F.W. Hurst, and the
Rev. Arthur Brooks....</p>

<p>It was nearly 9 o'clock before the descendants of the Pilgrims concluded the frugal repast which Delmonico had provided for them, and when cigars were lighted, the President, Josiah M. Fiske, called the assembly to order....</p>

<p><b>The New England Society. Last Night's Dinner--The Speeches.</b></p>
<p> The seventy-seventh annual dinner of the New England Society took place at Delmonicos
last
evening. Josiah M. Fiske presided and about two hundred and fifty guests were present, including
many
prominent persons. After dinner Mr. Fiske called the company to order and Mr. Choate replied to
the first
toast, Forefathers Day, in his usual happy style.</p>

<p>Mark Twain next spoke on Woman, and kept the tables in a roar by comparing the dress
fashions
prevailing among savages and the belles of modern society to the disadvantage of the latter. In the
course
of his remarks, he said: Among the Fans, a great negro tribe, a woman when dressed for home,
or to go
to market, or to go out calling, does not wear anything at all but just her complexion. That is all;
that is
her entire outfit. It is the lightest costume in the world, but is made of the darkest material. It has
often
been mistaken for mourning. It is the trimmest, and neatest, and gracefulest costume that is now
in
fashion; it wears well, is fast colors, doesnt show dirt. You dont have to send it down town
to wash and
have some of it come back scorched with the flatiron, and some of it with the buttons ironed off,
and some
of it petrified with starch, and some of it chewed by the calf, and some of it exchanged for other
customers things that havent any virtue but holiness, and ten-twelfths of the pieces
overcharged for, and
the rest of the dozen mislaid. And it always fits; it is the perfection of a fit. And it is the
handiest dress
in the whole realm of fashion. It is always ready, always done up. When you call on a Fan lady
and send
up your card, the hired girl never says: Please take a seat;   Madame is dressing--she will be
down in three-quarters of an hour. No, Madame is always ready dressed, always ready to receive: and
before you
can get the door mat before your eyes she is in you midst. Then, again, the Fan ladies dont go
to church
to see what each other has got on; and they dont go back home and describe it and slander it.
 Such is the dark child of savagery as to every-day toilet, and thus, curiously enough, she finds a
point of
contact with the fair daughter of civilization and high fashion--who often has nothing to
wear--and thus
these widely-separated types of the sex meet upon common ground. Yes; such is the Fan-woman,
as she
appears in her simple, unostentatious every-day toilet. But on state occasions she is more dressy.
At a
banquet she wears bracelets; at a lecture she wears earrings and a belt; at a ball she wears
stockings, and,
with true feminine fondness for display, she wears them on her arms; at a funeral she wears a
jacket of tar
and ashes; at a wedding the bride who can afford it puts on pantaloons. Thus the dark child of
savagery
and the fair daughter of civilization meet once more upon common ground, and these two touches
of
nature make their whole world kin.</p>

<b>Forefathers' Day. Seventy-Seventh Annual Dinner of the New England Society. Glorifying
the
Pilgrims. Speeches by Joseph H. Choate, General Grant, "Mark Twain" and Others. Mayor Grace
on
Home Rule.</b><br />

<p>About four hundred members and friends of the New England Society of this city sat down to
the
seventy-seventh annual dinner, at Delmonico's, last night. At the guests' table sat President
Josiah M.
Fiske, with General Grant upon his left hand and Joseph H. Choate upon his right. Ranged on
either side
were also Governor Long, of Massachusetts; Mayor Grace, Chauncey M. Depew, Samuel L.
Clemens
(Mark Twain), General Horace K. Porter, Senator Miller, of California; Governor Hobart V.
Bigelow,
General W.F. Vilas, Walter Watson, Judge Lawrence, F.W. J. Hurst, Commodore Upshur, John
Savage,
President Benjamin S. Silliman, of the New England Society of Brooklyn; Rev. Dr. Paxum and
Rev.
Arthur Brooks. At the heads of the five lower tables sat respectively Messrs. C.N. Bliss, Julius
Catlin,
Judge Horace Russell, William B. Dinsmore and C.W. Griswold, and among others present were
Mr.
Russell Sage, Mr. George C. Wilson, Mr.Whitelaw Reid, Colonel Ferdinand P. Earle, Mr. Henry
C.
Bowen, Mr. Jonathan Marshall, Colonel John H. Kemp, Mr. Charles Besman and General Stewart
L.
Woodford. </p>
<p> Grace was asked by Rev. Dr. Paxum and then the music sounded, the oysters were served
and the
descendants of the Pilgrims fell to with a will. When coffee was placed on the board thanks were
returned
by Rev. Arthur Brooks, and then President Fiske made a brief address, welcoming the guests to
the
seventy-seventh annual feast of the society. He announced that the statue to the Pilgrims in
Central park
would probably be unveiled during the ensuing year. One of the needs of the city, he said, was a
"New
England Hall," and it was hoped that this want might be filled. Mr. Fiske then announced the first
toast of
the evening, "Forefathers' Day," and introduced Mr. Joseph H. Choate, one of the ex-presidents
of the
society, to speak to it.</p>
<p> [<i> other speeches deleted</i>]</p>
<p>"<b>Mark Twain" on Woman.</b></p>
<p>"Woman--God Bless Her," was the toast assigned to "Mark Twain." The toast, he said,
includes the
sex universally; it is to woman comprehensively wheresoever she may be found. Let us consider
her ways.
First comes the matter of dress. This is a most important consideration in a subject of this nature,
and
must be disposed of before we can intelligently proceed to examine the profounder depths of the
theme.
(Laughter.) For text let us take the dress of two antipodal types--the savage woman of Central
Africa and the
cultivated daughter of our high modern civilization. Among the Fans a great negro tribe, a
woman, when
dressed for home or to go to market or out calling, does not wear anything at all but just her
complexion--(laughter)--that is all; that is her entire outfit. It is the lightest costume in the world, but is made of
the
darkest material. It has often been mistaken for mourning. It is the trimmest and neatest and
gracefullest
costume that is now in fashion. It wears well, is fast colors, does not show dirt. You don't have
to send it
down town to wash and have some of it come back scorched with the flat iron, and some of it
with the
buttons ironed off, and some of it petrified with starch, and some of it chewed by the calf, and
some of it
exchanged for other customers' things that haven't any virtue but holiness, and ten-twelfths of
the pieces
overcharged for the rest "mislaid." And it always fits. And it is the handiest dress in the whole
realm of
fashion. It is always ready "done up." When you call on a Fan lady and send up your card the
hired girl
never says, "Please take a seat; madame is dressing--she will be down in three-quarters of an
hour." No,
madame is always ready dressed--always ready to receive--and before you can get the door mat
before your
eyes she is in your midst. Then, again, the Fan ladies don't go to church to see what each other
has got on
and they don't go back home and describe it and slander it.</p>
<p> Such is the child of savagery as to everyday toilet, and thus, curiously enough, she finds a
point of
contact with the fair daughter of civilization and high position who often has "nothing to wear,"
and thus
these widely separated types of the sex meet upon common ground. Yes; such is the Fan woman
as she
appears in her simple unostentatious everyday toilet. But on state occasions she is more dressy. At
a
banquet she wears bracelets; at a lecture she wears earrings and a belt; at a ball she wears
stockings, and,
with the true feminine fondness for display, she wears them on her arms; at a funeral she wears a
jacket of
tar and ashes; at a wedding the bride who can afford it puts on pantaloons. Thus the dark child of
savagery and the fair daughter of civilization meet once more upon common ground, and these
two
touches of nature make their whole world kin.</p>
<b>The Other Type</b>
<p>Now we will consider the dress of our other type. A large part of the daughter of civilization
is her
dress--as it should be. Some civilized women would lose half their charm without dress, and some
would
lose all of it. The daughter of modern civilization dressed at her utmost best is a marvel of
exquisite and
beautiful art and--expense. All the lands and all the climes and all the arts are laid under tribute to
furnish
her forth. Her linen is from Belfast, her robe is from Paris, her lace is from Venice or France or
Spain, her
feathers are from the remote regions of Southern Africa, her furs from the remoter home of the
iceberg
and the aurora, her fan from Japan, her diamonds from Brazil, her bracelets from California, her
pearls
from Ceylon; her cameos from Rome. She has gems and trinkets from buried Pompeii and others
that
graced comely Egyptian forms that have been dust and ashes now for forty centuries, her watch is
from
Geneva, her cardcase is from China, her hair (laughter) is from--from--I don't know where her
hair is
from; I never could find out that. That is her other hair, her public hair, her Sunday hair; I don't mean the
hair she goes to bed with. Why, you ought to know the hair I mean; it's that thing which she
calls a
switch, and which resembles a switch as much as it does a brickbat--(laughter)--or a shotgun or
any other
thing which you can correct people with. It's that thing which she twists and then coils round
and round
her head, beehive fashion, and then tucks the end in under the hive and harpoons it with a hairpin.
And
that reminds me of a trifle:--Any time you want to you can glance around the carpet of a Pullman
car and
go and pick up a hairpin; but not to save your life can you get any woman in that car to
acknowledge that
hairpin. Now isn't that strange? But it's true. The woman who has never swerved from cast
iron morality
and fidelity in her whole life, will, when confronted with this crucial test, deny her hairpin.
(Laughter.)
She will deny that hairpin before a hundred witnesses. I have stupidly got into more trouble and
more hot
water trying to hunt up the owner of a hairpin in a Pullman car than by any other indiscretion in
my life.
(Laughter.)</p>
<p> Well, you see what the daughter of civilization is when she is dressed, and you have seen
what the
daughter of savagery is when she is not. Such is woman as to costume. I come now to consider her
in her
higher and nobler aspects--as mother, wife, widow--(laughter)--grass widow, mother-in-law,
hired girl,
telegraph operator, telephone halloer, queen, book agent, wet nurse, stepmother, boss,
professional
double-headed woman, professional beauty and so forth and so on. We will simply discuss these
few--let
the rest of the sex tarry in Jericho till we come again. First on the list of right and first on our list
comes a
woman who--why, dear me, I've been talking three-quarters of an hour. I beg a thousand
pardons. But you
see yourselves that I had a large contract. I have accomplished something anyway. I have
introduced my
subject, and if I had till next Forefathers' Day I am satisfied that I could discuss it as adequately
and
appreciatively a glorious and noble theme deserves. But, as the matter stands now, let us finish as
we began
and say, without jesting but with all sincerity, Woman--God Bless her! (Applause.)</p>
