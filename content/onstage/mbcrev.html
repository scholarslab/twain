<center><h3>MARK TWAIN AS A READER</h3></center>

M<font size="-1">Y DEAR</font> M<font size="-1">R</font>. H<font size="-1">OWELLS</font>,
-- No one has especially noticed, so far as I know, the remarkable skill of Mr. Clemens in reading
aloud the works of Robert Browning, and perhaps you would like to have me tell you what I
know about it, for the reason that it is interesting not only as throwing light upon Mr. Clemens,
but as illustrating effectively what loud reading ought to aim at and do.</p><p>

When Mr. Clemens was living in his Farmington Avenue home, and Mrs. Clemens, at the request
of a friend or two, invited some ladies who were old friends of them both to come to their house
one morning a week through the winter to hear some reading by Mr. Clemens from the works of
Robert Browing, the object of these readings being to make those books comprehensible and not
to display the qualities of the reader.  In fact, I think the intelligence of these sympathetic hearers
was to Mr. Clemens a test of the accuracy of his own interpretations.  The readings had already
been given during one winter, and another year with almost the same members of the club was
under way when Mrs. Clemens graciously invited me to come.  I think I had asked for this
invitation in a round about way and was much delighted when it came.  I had not been a reader of
Browning, and was a commonplace doubter of his comprehensibility, even to the point of
wondering whether Browning himself knew or cared very much what he meant.  When I took my
seat first in the library in which they lived, I looked about the carved black oak panelling of the
walls imported from an English house and the books and little pictures which broke their dark
surface, and perceived that the place was in itself a sort of revelation of poetic meanings.  The
fine, smooth outlines of the head of our hostess came out with wonderful clearness against the
dark background, and seemed fitting and in perfect keeping with the flowers and filtered sunshine
of the little conservatory.  This was no surprise.  But when I had settled into my place and began
to take observations, I was astonished to find what an exquisite clearness and refinement radiated
from Mr. Clemens.  His features were clear-cut and delicate and had the cast of high breeding. 
His head had the fine, luminous effect of a cameo, and intellectual discernment and critical power
were its most striking mental characteristics.  I had known Mark Twain for years, and had
appreciated him, or thought I did, but now I saw him in a wholly new light; no longer as a
humorist who plays with his subject as a cat does with a mouse, but as a man of the highest
literary quality responsive to the imaginative suggestions of a poet.  I had wondered what he
would do with his drawl, but for the most part it simply disappeared.  He was reading
continuously <i>The Ring and the Book</i>.  The preliminaries of the opening cantos had been
worked through in a previous reading.  Soon he was in the flowing tide of the subject and all else
was forgotten in its strong thoughts and brilliant sentences.  The reading was not oratorical and
aimed at no effects of cadence.  Free from self-consciousness, attempting only to let those
sentences speak for themselves as the author meant to have them, mastering in the easiest way the
parenthetic style so habitual with Browning, sentence within sentence conveying the thought, Mr.
Clemens interpreted the master or let him interpret himself with no intrusion of his own
personality.  Other men have tried to read Browning in a dramatic way with swelling voice and
tragic emphasis, and their ornamentation served merely to confuse the meaning.  In the method of
Mr. Clemens the thought was the thread he followed and which he was usually able to keep clear
and free from entanglements.</p><p>

It was his custom, I believe, to read over beforehand what he intended to give us from the author. 
He needed only to know what was coming.  There was no difficulty in following him for the most
part.  In <i>Sordello</i> only we saw him confused and perplexed, and after two readings the
book was abandoned.  But in <i>Strafford</i> the grand character of that man and the nation-wide canvas of the drama were brought out conspicuously and to our intense delight.  Never was
reading so much a revelation as with Mr. Clemens.  It seemed as high an art as that of the actor. 
To be able with the voice so to interpret a thinker, one ordinarily not easy of comprehension,
shows inspirability of a high order.  Other readers have seemed to me since then superficial in
comparison with him.</p><p>

As his hearers in this club were all women, it may be that the abilities that came out in him as a
reader were not generally understood outside of that small circle, and that hence you may
welcome these few words from one of them. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
