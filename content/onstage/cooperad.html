[<i>As publicity for his first lecture in the East MT prepared the following prospectus of the
Sandwich Islands lecture.  According to his autobiographical account of the performance,
copies of this prospectus were hung in the New York busses on strings in bunches of fifty:
"You could see them swinging and dangling around in every omnibus."   The list of topics
gives us access to the earliest form of the lecture, as MT brought it with him from the West.

<center>COOPER INSTITUTE<br />
THE SANDWICH ISLANDS<br />
<br />
By Invitation of a large number of<br /> prominent Californians and Citizens<br /> of New
York.<br />
<br />
MARK TWAIN<br />
<br />
will deliver a <br />
<br />
SERIO-HUMOROUS LECTURE<br />
concerning<br />
KANAKADOM<br />
or,<br />
THE SANDWICH ISLANDS,<br />
at<br />
COOPER INSTITUTE,<br />
On Monday Evening, May 6, 1867<br />
TICKETS FIFTY CENTS.<br />
For Sale at Chickering &amp; Sons, 652<br /> Broadway, and at the Principal Hotels.<br />
<br />
Doors open at 7 o'clock.  The Wisdom<br />
will begin to flow at 8.<br />
<br />
In which the following topics will<br /> receive marked attention:<br />
<br />
1. Horace Greeley and Hank Monk<br />--a topic which is new to Californians--<br />maybe
(sarcasm).<br />
2. Where Kanakadom is situated.<br />
3. What it was situated there for.<br />
4. Its dimensions.<br />
5. What it is made of--and why.<br />
6. Its population, and who killed it.<br />
7. How the natives dress, and, more<br /> particularly, how they don't dress.<br />
8. The King.<br />
9. The other natives.<br />
10. The Tabu.<br />
11. The Missionaries.<br />
12. Native hospitality.<br />
13. Native rascality.<br />
14. The multiplicity of mothers.<br />
15. Their talent for dying when they<br /> have got ready to die.<br />
16. A singular custom.<br />
17. How they dispose of their dogs.<br />
18. Another singular custom.<br />
19. A wicked slander refuted.<br />
20. Why the natives don't walk<br /> much, as a general thing.<br />
21. What becomes of the surplus children.<br />
22. The cheerful spirit of Kanakadom,<br /> under any and all circumstances.<br />
23. How they do almost everything wrong-end<br /> foremost; however, no attempt<br />
will be made to explain this<br /> peculiarity.<br />
24. A powerful description of a volcanic<br /> eruption.  The lecturer knows<br /> it is
powerful because it has got<br /> so many long words in it.<br />
25. The Boo-hoo fever.<br />
26. A word about the religious aspect<br /> of Kanakadom.<br />
27. The white people, and their peculiarities.<br />
28. Terrific drinkers.<br />
29. A unpalatable subject.<br />
30. The only joke achieved in Kanakadom<br /> after five months of persevering<br />
effort.<br />
31. Kanakadom as a really useful and<br /> valuable companion purchase to our<br />
ornamental Russian Possessions.<br />
32. The style of government, and<br /> what became of universal suffrage.<br />
33. Chance for Barnum.<br />
34. Accessories to royalty, and indifference<br /> to official distinction.<br />
35. The absurdities of strangers.<br />
36. Passing mention of certain diabolical<br /> amateur linguists.<br />
37. Climatic felicities--or facilities--<br /> as you please.<br />
38. The performance to conclude<br /> with a joke which cannot fail to<br /> amuse such
persons as may<br /> chance to be amused by it.<br />
<br />
CAREFULLY ELABORATED JOKES</center>
will be attached to each of these thirty-eight subjects--some of them being fearfully and
wonderfully made; but everything in the discourse except those jokes, can be relied upon as
useful and accurate information.<br /><br />

Some little pathos will be infused into this lecture, and persons who are overcome by it, may
go out for a few minutes; but no weeping will be allowed on the premises.<br /><br />

N.B. This Establishment Advertises where it pleases.<br />
