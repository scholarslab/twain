<center><h3>The Whittier Birthday Dinner Speech</h3></center>
<center><b>17 December 1877</b></center>

<p><font size="+1">T</font>HIS is an occasion peculiarly meet for the digging up of pleasant
reminiscences concerning literary folk; therefore I will drop lightly into history myself. Standing
here on the shore of the Atlantic and contemplating certain of its largest literary billows, I am
reminded of a thing which happened to me thirteen years ago, when I had just succeeded in
stirring up a little Nevadian literary puddle myself, whose spume-flakes were beginning to blow
thinly Californiaward. I started an inspection tramp through the southern mines of California. I
was callow and conceited, and I resolved to try the virtue of my nom de guerre.</p>

<p>I very soon had an opportunity. I knocked at a miner's lonely log cabin in the foot-hills of the
Sierras just at nightfall. It was snowing at the time. A jaded, melancholy man of fifty, barefooted,
opened the door to me. When he heard my nom de guerre he looked more dejected
than before. He let me in -- pretty reluctantly, I thought -- and after the customary bacon and
beans, black coffee and hot whiskey, I took a pipe.  This sorrowful man had not said three words
up to this time. Now he spoke up and said, in the voice of one who is secretly suffering, "You're
the fourth -- I'm going to move." "The fourth what?" said I. "The fourth littery man that has been
here in twenty-four hours -- I'm going to move." "You don't tell me!" said I; "who were the
others?" "Mr. Longfellow, Mr. Emerson, and Mr. Oliver Wendell Holmes -- consound the
lot!"</p>
 
<p>You can easily believe I was interested. I supplicated -- three hot whiskeys did the rest -- and
finally the melancholy miner began. Said he: "They came here just at dark yesterday evening, and I
let them in of course. Said they were going to the Yosemite. They were a rough lot, but that's
nothing; everybody looks rough that travels afoot. Mr. Emerson was a seedy little bit of a chap,
red-headed. Mr. Holmes was as fat as a balloon; he weighed as much as three hundred, and had
double chins all the way down to his stomach. Mr. Longfellow was built like a prize-fighter. His
head was cropped and bristly, like as if he had a wig made of hair-brushes. His nose lay straight
down his face, like a finger with the end joint tilted up. They had been drinking, I could see that.
And what queer talk they used!  Mr. Holmes inspected this cabin, then he took me by the
buttonhole, and says he:</p>

<p> "'Through the deep caves of thought<br />
 I hear a voice that sings,<br />
Build thee more stately mansions,<br />
O my soul!'</p>

<p>"Says I, 'I can't afford it, Mr. Holmes, and moreover I don't want to.' Blamed if I liked it
pretty well, either, coming from a stranger, that way. However, I started to get out my bacon and
beans, when Mr. Emerson came and looked on awhile, and then he takes me aside by the
buttonhole and says:</p>

<p>"'Give me agates for my meat;<br />
Give me cantharids to eat;<br />
From air and ocean bring me foods,<br />
From all zones and altitudes.'</p>

<p>"Says I, 'Mr. Emerson, if you'll excuse me, this ain't no hotel.' You see it sort of riled me -- I
warn't used to the ways of littery swells. But I went on a-sweating over my work, and next comes
Mr. Longfellow and buttonholes me, and interrupts me. Says he:</p>

<p>"'Honor be to Mudjekeewis!<br />
You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis--'</p>

<p>"But I broke in, and says I, 'Beg your pardon, Mr. Longfellow, if you'll be so kind as to hold
your yawp for about five minutes and let me get this grub ready, you'll do me proud.' Well, sir,
after they'd filled up I set out the jug. Mr. Holmes looks at it, and then he fires up all of a sudden
and yells:</p>

<p>"'Flash out a stream of blood-red wine!<br />
For I would drink to other days.'</p>

<p>"By George, I was getting kind of worked up.  I don't deny it, I was getting kind of worked
up.  I turns to Mr. Holmes, and says I, 'Looky here, my fat friend, I'm a-running this shanty, and if
the court knows herself, you'll take whiskey straight or you'll go dry.' Them's the very words I
said to him. Now I don't want to sass such famous littery people, but you see they kind of forced
me.  There ain't nothing onreasonable 'bout me; I don't mind a passer of guests a-treadin' on my 
tail three or four times, but when it comes to standing on it it's different, 'and if the court knows
herself,' I says, 'you'll take whiskey straight or you'll go dry.' Well, between drinks they'd swell
around the cabin and strike attitudes and spout; and pretty soon they got out a greasy old deck
and went to playing euchre at ten cents a corner -- on trust.  I began to notice some pretty
suspicious things.  Mr. Emerson dealt, looked at his hand, shook his head, says:</p>

<p>"'I am the doubter and the doubt --'</p>

<p>and ca'mly bunched the hands and went to shuffling for a new layout.  Says he:</p>

<p>"'They reckon ill who leave me out;<br />
They know now well the subtle ways I keep.<br />
I pass and deal <i>again!</i>'</p>

<p>Hang'd if he didn't go ahead and do it, too!  Oh, he was a cool one!  Well, in a minute things
were running pretty tight, but all of a sudden I see by Mr. Emerson's eye he judged he had 'em. 
He had already corralled two tricks, and each of the others one.  So now he kind of lifts a little in
his chair and says:</p>

<p>"'I tire of globes and aces! --<br />
Too long the game is played!'</p>

<p>-- and down he fetched a right bower.  Mr. Longfellow smiles as sweet as pie and says:</p>

<p>"'Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,<br />
For the lesson thou has taught,'</p>

<p>-- and blamed if he didn't down with <i>another</i> right bower!  Emerson claps his hand on
his bowie,  Longfellow claps his on his revolver, and I went under a bunk. There was going to be
trouble; but that monstrous Holmes rose up, wobbling his double chins, and says he, 'Order,
gentlemen; the first man that draws, I'll lay down on him and smother him!'  All quiet on the
Potomac, you bet!</p>

<p>"They were pretty how-come-you-so by now, and they begun to blow. Emerson says, 'The
nobbiest thing I ever wrote was " Barbara Frietchie."' Says Longfellow, 'It don't begin with my
"Biglow Papers."'  Says Holmes, 'My "Thanatopsis" lays over 'em both.' They mighty near ended
in a fight. Then they wished they had some more company -- and Mr. Emerson pointed to me and
says:</p>

<p>"'Is yonder squalid peasant all<br />
That this proud nursery could breed?'</p>

<p>He was a-whetting his bowie on his boot -- so I let it pass. Well, sir, next they took it into
their heads that they would like some music; so they made me stand up and sing "When Johnny
Comes Marching Home" till I dropped -- at thirteen minutes past four this morning. That's what
I've been through, my friend. When I woke at seven, they were leaving, thank goodness, and Mr.
Longfellow had my only boots on, and his'n under his arm. Says I, 'Hold on, there, Evangeline,
what are you going to do with them?' He says, 'Going to make tracks with 'em; because:</p>

<p>"'Lives of great men all remind us<br />
We can make our lives sublime;<br />
And, departing, leave behind us<br />
Footprints on the sands of time.'</p>

<p>As I said, Mr. Twain, you are the fourth in twenty-four hours -- and I'm going to move; I ain't
suited to a littery atmosphere."</p>

<p>I said to the miner, "Why, my dear sir, these were not the gracious singers to whom we and
the world pay loving reverence alla homage; these were impostors."</p>

<p>The miner investigated me with a calm eye for a while; then said he, "Ah! impostors, were
they?  Are <i>you?</i></p>

<p>I did not pursue the subject, and since then I have not travelled on my nom de guerre enough
to hurt. Such was the reminiscence I was moved to contribute, Mr. Chairman. In my enthusiasm I
may have exaggerated the details a little, but you will easily forgive me that fault, since I believe it
is the first time I have ever deflected from perpendicular fact on an occasion like this.</p>
