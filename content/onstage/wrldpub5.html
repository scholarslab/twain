<center><h2>ENTERTAINMENTS.</h2></center>
<p>Each succeeding day has marked a steady increase in the advance sale of seats for the Mark
Twain entertainment at the Metropolitan theater next Tuesday evening.  This eminent humorist
and literary genius promises to entertain a large audience.  It is said, to make a good lecture, the
first thing is to know what to leave out, the second thing what to put in, and the third third when
to leave off.  Mark Twain knows all these and his greatest failing is that he leaves off all too soon.
We think he has hardly begun when his hour of talking is passed and he bids us good night.
Twain can paint a picture when he pleases and it is hoped he will paint his vision of Athens by
moonlight.  His description of French lackeys and Swiss scullions is very amusing. In comparison
he says: "If you hire one to sneeze for you and another chooses to help him, you have got to pay
both," and he adds: "How it must have surprised such people to hear of the way of salvation
offered them without money and without price."</p><p>

There are still many seats to be had and there is every evidence that most of them will be filled
next Tuesday evening.</p>

<center><h2>Mark Twain's Lecture</h2></center>
<p>Gladstone does not shine as a Biblical critic, nor Mark Twain as a critic of Italian art nor a guide
to the Holy Land, but as brilliant humorist he reigns supreme.  If critics who think art should
imitate nature so far as to leave things at loose ends are right, "Huckleberry Finn," which tells of
Southern lawlessness, life in little innocent towns, and leaves murders unavenged and lovers in full
flight, should satisfy them.  Already "Huckleberry Finn" is an historical novel, and probably more
valuable to the historian than "Uncle Tom's Cabin," for it is written without partisanship and
without "a purpose."  Again, where is the woman more masterly drawn than the one who detects
"Huck" in a girl's attire? This book may have defects and deficiencies in taste, but it remains a
nearly flawless gem of romance and humor.  A two-shilling novel by Mark Twain, with an ugly
picture on the cover, may "have no show," and perhaps one is enough for him to "live by," but let
us pray that his life may be spared until he shall produce such another.</p><p>

In the early 60's Mark Twain, after his failure as a miner on account of its being too laborious,
took a position as local editor on the Enterprise in Virginia City, Nev.  (He had written for
newspapers before; few Americans escape that fate), and it was then that he took the pseudonym
of Mark Twain, which he borrowed from the vernacular of the river, when the man heaving the
lead calls out "Mark twain," instead of "Mark two."  The habit of putting his own life into his
books is only one phase of the frankness of Mr. Clemens' humorous attitude.  He asks nothing but
the transparent disguise of the pseudonym granted him.  In this he differs from Mr. Locke, who
likes to figure as "Petroleum V. Nasby," the crossroads politician; Mr. Shaw, who chooses to
masquerade as "Josh Billings," and Chas. F. Brown, "delicious" as he was when he dealt with us
directly, preferred to disguise himself as "Artemus Ward," the showman, each of whom appeals to
the grotesqueness of misspelling to help out his fun; but it was for Mr. Clemens to reconcile the
public to humor which contented itself with established absurdities of English orthography.
Formerly many American humorists were on the side of slavery, drunkenness and irreligion.
Before "John Phoenix" there was scarcely an American humorist with whom one could smile and
keep his own self-respect. But Mark Twain, the most popular humorist that ever lived, has never
published anything to make one morally ashamed of liking him.  As Shakespeare was the first to
make poetry all poetical, Mark Twain was the first to make all humor humorous.</p><p>

An original vein of humor is shown in his appreciation of the many congratulatory messages
received when he reached his half-century of life, where he writes to a friend: "Every mail brings
me letters from people who seem glad that I am 50 years told.  I don't see what I have done to
have so many enemies. I have never congratulated a person on being 50 years of age.  It is true I
have shot at people in the dark when I have had something against them, but I have drawn the line
there."  Many people regard Twain as an extravagant wag with a long bow, yet every English-speaking market is flooded with his "Innocents" of all sorts.  He is supposed to lie like truth, but
he as often speaks truth like lies, and utters many verities in jest -- yes, and in earnest too.  You
can easily tell when he has the long bow and when he is shooting fair.</p><p>

Mr. Twain's strong points are his facile but minute observation, his power of description, which is
so vivid as to make you feel, after listening to him, that you know all about those places and do
not have to go there; and his vein of peculiar, I almost said personal, humor, which stand out in all
their glory while he is on the platform.  Those who are to hear Mark Twain next Tuesday evening
at the Metropolitan Opera House have a rare treat in store, and if the advance sale of seats is any
indication of the sales to be from now on until that evening, Mark Twain will have a royal
reception.</p><p>

Mark Twain's secret is a tolerably open one.  He is always wide awake; full of observation, not
too full, so he is not a bore. He continually jokes, and his jokes are generally easy ones, so they
make you laugh while they do not make you think, which is important, for the slow discovery of a
joke is a very wearing process.  And, last, but not least, Twain has shown that he can go on, for
he is endowed with more than one idea.  What can be more unlike any of his previous works than
"The Prince and the Pauper," where he pictures Edward VI. as changing clothes with a romantic
beggar boy who resembles him?  The beggar boy is found in the palace, and the courtiers cannot
be persuaded that he is not Edward VI., gone mad, and the prince, once in the beggar's clothes,
cannot convince anyone that he is not a beggar.  How very unlike "The Jumping Frog," his horse,
"Jerico," and the bucking "Mexican Plug."  Had he done no more than all these he would have
deserved well.  But he has done more, and in all he has done he is oddly sound and quaintly
thorough besides; but his use of commas and full stops would have run any office dry, to say
nothing of the hyphens.</p><p>

He has made a number of lecturing tours, all of which have been very successful.  His stage
deportment is his very own.  Someone said of him: "He spoke more slowly than any man I ever
heard.  We never laughed loud nor long; we sat throughout with a gently simmering amusement.
His description of the old Magdalen ivy-covered collegiate buildings at Oxford University was
exquisitely charming. He told of a duel which never came off and of another one where no one
was injured in a semi-pathetic way peculiarly belonging to him.  Suddenly Twain made his bow
and went off.  It was over.  I looked at my watch.  I was never more taken back.  I had been
sitting there exactly one hour and 20 minutes.  It seemed 10 minutes at the outside.  If you have
ever tried to address a public meeting you will know what this means.  It means that Mark Twain
is a consummate public speaker, and in the art of saying nothing in an hour he surpasses our most
accomplished parliamentary speakers."</p>

<center><h2>ENTERTAINMENTS.</h2></center>

<p>This city will have the pleasure tomorrow, of entertaining for a brief time, one of the most unique
and distinguished characters of American literature.  When one considers Mark Twain's present
age, it is more probable that this visit tomorrow will be his last to this city.  As is well known, he
is now on a trip around the world, and by fall he will be far away in some of the Pacific islands; it
will therefore be a rare opportunity to listen to his unique readings which are to take place at the
Metropolitan Opera House Tuesday evening.</p><p>

There are thousands in Minneapolis who have been delighted for hours at a time in reading Mark
Twain's various works, and that element will doubtless be curiously interested in obtaining a
personal view of the author, and hearing from his own lips something about the various characters
of which he has from time to time written so interestingly.</p><p>

After the lecture Mark Twain will be given a reception by the members of the Minneapolis Press
Club, jointly, at the rooms of the Commercial Club.  Those living at the lake will have special
trains run for them, leaving the lake at 7 o'clock, arriving in this city before 8 o'clock, and again
leaving for the lake immediately after the lecture.</p>

<center><h2>ENTERTAINMENTS.</h2></center>
<p>Mark Twain, the most celebrated and widely known literateur that has ever visited this city in
many years, will arrive at Minneapolis this morning from Duluth.  Anticipating his coming visit to
this city, the famous writer has been flooded with requests from various prominent people here
who have been desirous of showing him some special attention during his brief sojourn.  Mr.
Clemens is deeply grateful for the evidence of kindly feeling shown by his friends and admirers
here, but feels that it will be necessary to forego all pleasures of that sort in order to be in prime
metal for his lecture this evening at the Metropolitan and the additional duties that may possibly
be asked of him at the public reception to be tendered him this evening at 10:30 by the
Minneapolis Press Club and the Commercial Club at the latter's quarters in the Kasota Block.</p><p>

In all probability citizens of Minneapolis will tonight be given the last opportunity of ever listening
in this city to Mark Twain's unalloyed fun from his own lips.  The program this evening will be
made up of all sorts of the best selections from his numerous stories, and many pertinent remarks
will be added to give special zest to the occasion.  The audience which will be present at the
Metropolitan Opera House this evening promises to be one of the most select gatherings that has
occurred here in a very long time.  It will certainly be one of the most distinguished audiences that
has, possibly, ever greeted a literary luminary in Minneapolis.  The sale of seats will continue
uninterruptedly throughout the day at the box office in question, and it is believed that by 7
o'clock tonight all of the seats on the two lower floors of the spacious theater will be purchased.
After the lecture a committee composed of the Press and Commercial Clubs will escort Mr.
Clemens to the place where the reception is to be held.  The lecture promises to be a feast for
those of a literary turn of mind, and it is also safe to assume there will be plenty of fun in it, too,
as a letter received yesterday from Maj. Pond states that Mr. Clemens is in great health and fine
trim generally.</p>
