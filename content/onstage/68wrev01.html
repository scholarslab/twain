<p>"M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN'S</font>" L<font size="-1">ECTURE</font>.--Platt's Hall was crowded to excess to hear the Holy Land Excursionist personally narrate his experience on that memorable voyage.  The lecture was not so well prepared at the first one he delivered on the Sandwich Islands, though two bursts of eloquence called out hearty applause--on the ruins of Palestine, and on what the Pilgrims will not forget.  The interview with the Emperor of Russia was adroitly turned by the lecturer against himself.  The innuendo on the rapacity of office-holders, and the narration of the discomfort of the Sultan in his married life, provoked a deal of merriment.  The lecture will be repeated to-night, at the same place, to accommodate those who were unable to procure seats last evening.</p>

<p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN'S</font> L<font size="-1">ECTURE</font>.--This renowned humorist gave a graphic account of his notorious pilgrimage to the Holy Land in his bruited inimitable style last Tuesday evening.  As was duly announced, the doors were surrounded at the appointed hour and the insurrection which followed was fully in accordance with prediction.  When it is stated that the gentleman was in every respect alive with his usual characteristics, it will be understood that his hearers were well pleased.  The lecture was repeated to accommodate those who were unable to obtain seats the first evening.</p>

<p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN'S</font> L<font size="-1">ECTURE</font>.--Mark Twain appeared in a singular disguise before an immense audience in Platt's Hall last evening, but his voice and humor betrayed him.  He asked his friends of the press to refrain from publishing any synopsis of his discourse, and, having arranged that matter satisfactorily, he proceeded with his lecture.  There were many telling points in it--flashes of humor which convulsed his hearers with laughter, and gleams of sentiment which almost induced the wish that he might not resume the humorist's vein.  Several passages--descriptive of the solemn grandeur of Rome's gray ruins, and the dreary desolation of the cities of Palestine--were really eloquent.  But, on the whole, the lecture was not as completely prepared or warmly received as his first one on the Hawaiian Islands, and after he dismissed the audience there was a general expression of regret that he had not said more about Palestine, etc., and less about the bald-headed, spectacled and sedate old pilgrims on the <i>Quaker City</i>.  He said he was disguised for a masquerade last evening, and his desire to attend may have led him to curtail his discourse; if so, those who go this evening may hear more about the cities and countries which he visited.</p>

<p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN'S</font> L<font size="-1">ECTURE</font>.--Platt's Hall was crowded to suffocation on the occasion of the first public appearance, in California, of "Mark Twain," since his memorable voyage on the <i>Quaker City</i>.  As the lecture is to be repeated this evening, we refrain from giving a synopsis of it, until there shall be no danger of taking the bloom off this pleasant humorist's fancies.

<p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN'S</font> L<font size="-1">ECTURE</font> R<font size="-1">EPEATED</font>.--The repetition of the lecture on the Holy Land Excursion last night, was vastly gratifying to the audience and the lecturer; he had "got the hang of the sermon" and delivered it with more nonchalance, assuming that confidential conversational tone that breaks down all barriers between the man on the stage and the people occupying the seats.  The description of Palestine as it is, the compressed substance of a dozen volumes of travels, is the gem in the lecture, though for poetic eloquence, the summary of things that cannot be forgotten, bears off the palm.  The lecture is to be repeated at Sacramento, on Friday night.

<br />
<p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN'S</font> L<font size="-1">ECTURE</font>.--Mark Twain repeated his lecture last evening.  His journey to the Holy Land has been called a pilgrimage.  It was more properly a <i>crusade</i>--a humorous tilting against shams and sentiment.  He battered the casques of friends and foes, perhaps not always fairly, but always effectively.  He was a crusader on his own hook--a kind of free lance, working himself into a grotesque rage over dulness, carving the sconces of proper folk, and making it lively for infinite respectability.  There were passages graphic, eloquent, complete and elegant enough to stand out in glaring contrast with more slipshod, doubtful jokes, and make Mark Twain himself his own severest critic.

<p>"M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN'S</font>" L<font size="-1">ECTURE</font> L<font size="-1">AST</font> N<font size="-1">IGHT</font>.--The lecture-room of the Mercantile Library Building was well filled with admirers of "Mark Twain" (Mr. Samuel L. Clemens), to hear his lecture on "The Oldest of the Republics--Venice: Past and Present."  At a few minutes after eight o'clock (the hour announced for "the orgies" to commence,) the lecturer stepped out from a side door, advanced to the front of the platform, looked around anxiously for a few seconds, and then made the following preliminary remarks:</p>
<p>"<i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i>: If any one in San Francisco has a just right this evening to feel gratified--more, to feel proud--it is I, who stand before you.  The compliment of your attendance here I thoroughly appreciate.  It is a greater compliment than I really deserve, perhaps--but for that matter I have always been rather better treated in San Francisco than I actually deserved.  I am willing to say that.  I appreciate your attendance here to-night all the more because there was such a wide-spread, such a furious, such a determined opposition to my lecturing upon this occasion. [Laughter.]  Pretty much the entire community wrote petitions imploring me <i>not</i> to lecture--to forbear--to have compassion upon a persecuted people.  [Laughter.]  I have never had such a unanimous call to--to--to leave, before.  [Great laughter.] But I resisted, and am here; and I am glad that I am privileged to address a full house, instead of having to pour out this cataract of wisdom upon empty benches.  [Applause.]  I do not exactly propose to <i>instruct</i> you this evening, but rather to tell you a good many things which you have known very well before, no doubt, but which may have grown dim in your memories--for the multifarious duties and annoyances of daily life are apt to drive from our minds a large part of what we learn, and that knowledge is of little use which we cannot recall.  So I simply propose to refresh your memories.  I trust this will be considered sufficient apology for making this lecture somewhat didactic.  I don't know what didactic means, [laughter] but it is a good, high-sounding word, and I wish to use it, meaning no harm whatever."</p>
<p>He then gave a sort of compressed history of Venice, the youngest of the Italian cities, and contrasted it in its palmy times with the Venice of to-day, as seen in the glare of sunlight, and not in the charitable rays of the moon--likened it to Sacramento when overflowed; stripped the romance from the gondola (a canoe with a hearse body) and the gondolier; pictured the ladies going shopping, the lover slyly stealing up to the old man's house, the merchant going to his counting-room--all in gondolas, making the place a paradise for cripples.  The lecture was interspersed with humorous allusions, anecdotes, and sarcastic allusions to the Americans abroad who affect foreign airs and especially to the dilletanti, but wound up with a burst of glowing rhetoric on the city which is yearly wedded to the sea by solemn ceremonies.  The applause was frequent and appreciative throughout the lecture, which lasted one hour and fifty minutes, though it was not a minute too long.  Mr. Clemens leaves for the East on Monday, and may be proud to leave with such a tribute to his popularity as the attendance of last night.</p>

<p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN</font> L<font size="-1">AST</font> N<font size="-1">IGHT</font>.--Mark's lecture on "Venice" at the Mercantile Library Hall last night was greeted by a full house, composed of the aristocratic and <i>elite</i> of the city, who were quite liberal in their applause of the many good and "telling" points.  The lecture was a perfect success both in a literary and financial point of view; it deserves and will no doubt have a successful run in the Atlantic cities.</p>
