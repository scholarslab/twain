<p>According to the chronology at the end of Paul Fatout's <i>Mark Twain Speaking</i>, in the
course of his career MT gave over 150 after-dinner speeches.  The typical context for one of
these performances was a lavish dinner, in honor of someone (like Whittier) or something (like the
landing on Plymouth Rock), attended mainly by male notables.  A couple hours of eating and
drinking was followed by a couple of hours of ceremonial toasting, which allowed for more
drinking and also fed the era's appetite for oratory.  As comic relief to the standard grandiloquent
rhetoric, MT was invited to many of these dinners.  By the end of his career "Mark Twain" was
himself the guest of honor at such affairs, as the four-page souvenir menu (<i>below left</i>) from a December, 1900, banquet
thrown by <i>The Aldine</i> magazine attests.  Although they were exhausting events, he never
lost his enthusiasm for being there and, when his turn came, "making the tables roar with
laughter," as newspaper reports often put it.  By starting with the 1882 toast "To Woman" listed
first below, you can get an idea how much of his care and energy MT invested in these ephemeral
performances.  The rest of the sampling below includes some of the best, and in some cases dramatic, of
MT's speeches.  Along with each text you will find newspaper reports and other contextualizing
items.</p>
