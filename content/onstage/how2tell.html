<center><b><font size="-1">THE HUMOROUS STORY AN AMERICAN<br />
DEVELOPMENT.--IT'S DIFFERENCE<br />
FROM COMIC AND WITTY STORIES.</font></b>
</center>

<p>
I do not claim that I can tell a story as it ought to be told. I only claim to know how a story ought
to be told, for I have been almost daily in the company of the most expert storytellers for many
years.</p><p>

There are several kinds of stories, but only one difficult kind--the humorous. I will talk mainly
about that one. The humorous story is American, the comic story is English, the witty story is
French. The humorous story depends for its effect upon the <i>manner</i> of the telling; the
comic story and the witty story upon the <i>matter</i>.</p><p>

The humorous story may be spun out to great length, and may wander around as much as it
pleases, and arrive nowhere in particular; but the comic and witty stories must be brief and end
with a point. The humorous story bubbles gently along, the others burst.</p><p>

The humorous story is strictly a work of art,--high and delicate art,--and only an artist can tell it;
but no art is necessary in telling the comic and the witty story; anybody can do it. The art of
telling a humorous story--understand, I mean by word of mouth, not print--was created in
America, and has remained at home.</p><p>

The humorous story is told gravely; the teller does his best to conceal the fact that he even dimly
suspects that there is anything funny about it; but the teller of the comic story tells you beforehand
that it is one of the funniest things he has ever heard, then tells it with eager delight, and is the
first person to laugh when he gets through. And sometimes, if he has had good success, he is so
glad and happy that he will repeat the "nub" of it and glance around from face to face, collecting
applause, and then repeat it again. It is a pathetic thing to see.</p><p>

Very often, of course, the rambling and disjointed humorous story finishes with a nub, point,
snapper, or whatever you like to call it. Then the listener must be alert, for in many cases the teller
will divert attention from that nub by dropping it in a carefully casual and indifferent way, with the
pretense that he does not know it is a nub.</p><p>

Artemus Ward used that trick a good deal; then when the belated audience presently caught the
joke he would look up with innocent surprise, as if wondering what they had found to laugh at.
Dan Setchell used it before him, Nye and Riley and others use it to-day.</p><p>

But the teller of the comic story does not slur the nub; he shouts at you--every time. And when he
prints it, in England, France, Germany and Italy, he italicises it, puts some whooping
exclamation-points after it, and sometimes explains it in a parenthesis. All of which is very
depressing, and makes one want to renounce joking and lead a better life.</p><p>

Let me set down an instance of the comic method, using an anecdote which has been popular all
over the world for twelve or fifteen hundred years. The teller tells it in this way:</p>

<center><b>THE WOUNDED SOLDIER</b></center>

<p>
In the course of a certain battle a soldier whose leg had been shot off appealed to another soldier
who was hurrying by to carry him to the rear, informing him at the same time of the loss which he
had sustained; whereupon the generous son of Mars, shouldering the unfortunate, proceeded to
carry out his desire. The bullets and cannon-balls were flying in all directions, and presently one of
the latter took the wounded man's head off--without, however, his deliverer being aware of it. In
no long time he was hailed by an officer, who said:</p><p>

"Where are you going with that carcass?"</p><p>

"To the rear, sir--he's lost his leg!"</p><p>

"His leg, forsooth?" responded the astonished officer; "you mean his head, you booby."</p><p>

Whereupon the soldier dispossessed himself of his burden, and stood looking down upon it in
great perplexity. At length he said:</p><p>

"It is true, sir, just as you have said." Then after a pause he added, "<i>But he</i> <font
size="-1">TOLD</font> <i>me</i> IT WAS HIS LEG!!!!!"</p>
<hr width="10%" />

<p>
Here the narrator bursts into explosion after explosion of thunderous horse-laughter, repeating
that nub from time to time through his gaspings and shriekings and suffocatings.</p><p>

It takes only a minute and a half to tell that in its comic-story form; and isn't worth the telling,
after all. Put into the humorous-story form it takes ten minutes, and is about the funniest thing I
have ever listened to--as James Whitcomb Riley tells it.</p><p>

He tells it in the character of a dull-witted old farmer who has just heard it for the first time,
thinks it unspeakably funny, and is trying to repeat it to a neighbor. But he can't remember it; so
he gets it all mixed up and wanders helplessly round and round, putting in tedious details that
don't belong in the tale and only retard it; taking them out conscientiously and putting in others
that are just as useless; making minor mistakes now and then and stopping to correct them and
explain how he came to make them; remembering things which he forgot to put in in their proper
place and going back to put them in there; stopping his narrative a good while in order to try to
recall the name of the soldier that was hurt, and finally remembering that the soldier's name was
not mentioned, and remarking placidly that the name is of no real importance, after all,--and so
on, and so on, and so on.</p><p>

The teller is innocent and happy and pleased with himself, and has to stop every little while to
hold himself in and keep from laughing outright; and does hold in, but his body quakes in a
jelly-like way with interior chuckles; and at the end of the ten minutes the audience have laughed
until they are exhausted, and the tears are running down their faces.</p><p>

The simplicity and innocence and sincerity and unconsciousness of the old farmer are perfectly
simulated, and the result is a performance which is thoroughly charming and delicious. This is
art--and fine and beautiful, and only a master can compass it; but a machine could tell the other
story.</p><p>

To string incongruities and absurdities together in a wandering and sometimes purposeless way,
and seem innocently unaware that they are absurdities, is the basis of the American art, if my
position is correct. Another feature is the slurring of the point. A third is the dropping of a studied
remark apparently without knowing it, as if one were thinking aloud. The fourth and last is the
pause.</p><p>

Artemus Ward dealt in numbers three and four a good deal. He would begin to tell with great
animation something which he seemed to think was wonderful; then lose confidence, and after an
apparently absent-minded pause add an incongruous remark in a soliloquizing way; and that was
the remark intended to explode the mine--and it did.</p><p>

For instance, he would say eagerly, excitedly, "I once knew a man in New Zealand who hadn't a
tooth in his head"--here his animation would die out; a silent, reflective pause would follow, then
he would say dreamily, and as if to himself, "and yet that man could beat a drum better than any
man I ever saw."</p><p>

The pause is an exceedingly important feature in any kind of story, and a frequently recurring
feature, too. It is a dainty thing, and delicate, and also uncertain and treacherous; for it must be
exactly the right length--no more and no less--or it fails of its purpose and makes trouble. If the
pause is too short the impressive point is passed, and the audience have had time to divine that a
surprise is intended--and then you can't surprise them, of course.</p><p>

On the platform I used to tell a negro ghost story that had a pause in front of the snapper on the
end, and that pause was the most important thing in the whole story. If I got it the right length
precisely, I could spring the finishing ejaculation with effect enough to make some impressionable
girl deliver a startled little yelp and jump out of her seat--and that was what I was after. This story
was called "The Golden Arm," and was told in this fashion. You can practise with it yourself--and
mind you look out for the pause and get it right.</p>

<center><b>THE GOLDEN ARM</b></center>

<p>
Once 'pon a time dey wuz a monsus mean man, en he live 'way out in de prairie all 'lone by hisself,
'cep'n he had a wife. En bimeby she died, en he tuck en toted her way out dah in de prairie en
buried her. Well, she had a golden arm--all solid gold, fum de shoulder down. He wuz pow'ful
mean--pow'ful; en dat night he couldn't sleep, caze he want dat golden arm so bad.</p><p>

When it come midnight he couldn't stan' it no mo'; so he git up, he did, en tuck his lantern en
shoved out thoo de storm en dug her up en got de golden arm; en he bent his head down 'gin de
win', en plowed en plowed en plowed thoo de snow. Den all on a sudden he stop (make a
considerable pause here, and look startled, and take a listening attitude) en say: "My <i>lan'</i>,
what's dat!"</p><p>

En he listen--en listen--en de win' say (set your teeth together and imitate the wailing and
wheezing singsong of the wind), "Bzzz-z-zzz"--en den, way back yonder what de grave is, he hear
a <i>voice!</i>--he hear a voice all mix' up in de win'--can't hardly tell 'em
'part--"Bzzz-zzz--W-h-o--g-o-t--m-y--g-o-l-d-e-n--<i>arm?</i>--zzz--zzz--W-h-o g-o-t m-y
g-o-l-d-e-n <i>arm?</i>" (You must begin to shiver violently now.)</p><p>

En he begin to shiver en shake, en say, "Oh, my! <i>Oh</i>, my lan'!" en de win' blow de lantern
out, en de snow en sleet blow in his face en mos' choke him, en he start a-plowin' knee-deep
toward home mos' dead, he so sk'yerd--en pooty soon he hear de voice agin, en (pause) it 'us
comin' <i>after</i> him! "Bzzz--zzz--zzz--W-h-o--g-o-t--m-y g-o-l-d-e-n--<i>arm?</i>"</p><p>

When he git to de pasture he hear it agin--closter now, en a-<i>comin'!</i>--a-comin' back dah in
de dark en de storm--(repeat the wind and the voice). When he git to de house he rush up-stairs
en jump in de bed en kiver up, head and years, en lay dah shiverin' en shakin'--en den way out dah
he hear it <i>again!</i>--en a-<i>comin'!</i> En bimeby he hear (pause--awed, listening
attitude)--pat--pat--pat--<i>hit's a-comin' up-stairs!</i> Den he hear de latch, en he <i>know</i>
it's in de room!</p><p>

Den pooty soon he know it's a-<i>stannin' by de bed!</i> (Pause.) Den--he know it's
a--<i>bendin' down over him</i>--en he cain't skasely git his breath! Den--den--he seem to feel
someth'n <i>c-o-l-d</i>, right down 'most agin his head! (Pause.)</p><p>

Den de voice say, <i>right at his year</i>--"W-h-o--g-o-t--m-y--g-o-l-d-e-n <i>arm?</i>" (You
must wail it out very plaintively and accusingly; then you stare steadily and impressively into the
face of the farthest-gone auditor,--a girl, preferably,--and let that awe-inspiring pause begin to
build itself in the deep hush. When it has reached exactly the right length, jump suddenly at that
girl and yell, "<i>You've</i> got it!"</p><p>

If you've got the <i>pause</i> right, she'll fetch a dear little yelp and spring right out of her shoes.
But you <i>must</i> get the pause right; and you will find it the most troublesome and
aggravating and uncertain thing you ever undertook.)</p>
