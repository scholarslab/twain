<center><b>Mark Twain's Savages.</b></center>
<p>Everybody went to Lincoln Hall to laugh last night, and everybody did so, partly because they came with that intent and partly because they couldn't help it.  At 8:10 P.M. the lecturer made his appearance on the stage, accompanied by Colonel Burnside, of the Grand Army of the Republic, and was greeted with applause from some portions of the hall, the majority of those present seeming to be in doubt whether the tall, slight individual with the Colonel was Mark or somebody else.  All doubts were resolved in a few moments, however, when the party referred to walked forward, with a slight stoop, to the stand, and in a very deliberate manner proceeded to introduce, with many highly complimentary allusions, Mr. Samuel L. Clemens, otherwise "Mark Twain"--otherwise himself.  He stated that Colonel Burnside had kindly offered to introduce him, but as he (Colonel Burnside) knew him only by his <i>nom de plume</i>, and as he (Mark Twain) knew considerably more about himself, he thought he was better qualified to perform that ceremony.  He had studied the usual form, and he thought he had finally mastered it.  After considerable humorous circumlocution, the lecturer got at his subject, "Our Fellow-savages, the Sandwich Islanders," and for an hour and a half kept the unfaltering attention of his audience by a serio-comic description of the islands and their inhabitants.</p>
