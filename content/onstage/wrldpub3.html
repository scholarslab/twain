<center><h2>Mark Twain This Week.</h2></center>
<br />

<p>For two decades, Samuel L. Clemens, known wherever the English language is spoken by his nom
de plume "Mark Twain," has been recognized as the world's leading humorist.  The originality of
his style defies plagiarism and baffles imitation.  Whether he treats of typical Americans, as in
"Innocents Abroad," or of traditionary characters, as in "A Yankee in King Arthur's Court," Mark
Twain always preserves the consistencies and at the same time with fine satire touches and
exposes the foibles and weak sides of his characters in such a way as to render his writings at the
same time intensely interesting and irresistibly mirth-provoking.  So keen is his penetration into
human nature that no characteristic of his subjects, however well hidden, escapes him, and he
portrays the concealed skeletons in their closets as accurately as a camera produces a
photograph.</p><p>

With rare versatility, Mark Twain not only excels with his pen, but is equally at home on the
platform, and captivates his audiences by the dry, droll, almost apathetic manner in which he
brings out the wit and humor of his own productions.  In easy attitude, with a scowling
countenance and an inimitable drawl, Mark Twain's first utterances never fail to excite the
risibilities of his audience.  A gale of laughter speedily follows which continues unintermittently
until his last numbers have been rendered.  Other humorists may interest for a time, but sooner or
later become tedious and wearisome.</p><p>

Wherever English is spoken a longing is felt to spend a delightful evening with the great humorist
and satirist, and it is in response to this desire that Mark Twain is now making a tour of the world.
After delighting thousands of people in Cleveland and throughout the Northwest, he is now
approaching Portland, and will appear at the Marquam Grand next Friday, August 9.</p>
