[<i>From the</i> Poughkeepsie Daily Eagle<i>, 2 December 1869:</i>]<br />
<br />
<p>L<font size="-1">YCEUM</font>. -- Mark Twain (Samuel L. Clemens) will lecture before the
Lyceum, on Friday evening of this week.  This is "Mark's" first appearance in our city.  We would
advise all who can appreciate sparkling wit and genial humor, to provide themselves with a ticket
and wend their way to Collingwood's Opera House, on Friday evening, nothing fearing that they
will receive an adequate return from their investment.</p>

<p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN</font>. -- There was a fine audience at
Collingwood Opera House last evening, the occasion being a lecture on the Sandwich Islands by
Mark Twain. -- There was much original humor in the lecturer, and too at times he gave splendid
illustrations of natural scenery on that far off land.  It was a very enjoyable entertainment, and
every one in the audience seemed pleased.</p>
