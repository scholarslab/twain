<p><i>A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur</i>, by Mark Twain
(Samuel L. Clemens), published by Messrs. Chatto & Windus, is a
rather laborious piece of fun with a sort of purpose in it. One of the
illustrations, early in the volume, represents a Yankee tickling with a
straw the nose of a gigantic statue of a lion, and indicates the general
nature of the serious purport of the 525 pages of that very American
kind of American humour of which "Mark Twain" is the chief master.
Laughing at British institutions, and showing that the good old times
were uncommonly bad times for the people, and that not a few of the
historical privileges which still exist do not suit the ideas of the great
republic of the West, afford a good deal of harmless amusement and
opportunities for very trite comment. It is a mistake to decide that
ridicule cast upon the story of Arthur is an offence in any way other
than in the matter of taste in jokes. Sir Thomas Malory and Lord
Tennyson will survive. Masterpieces will stand any amount of parody.
"The Burial of Sir John Moore" and Gray's "Elegy" are just as
impressive and admirable as if they had not been parodied with all
sorts of jocularity and ribaldry scores of times. One may easily read
Mark Twain's book without any ill will; but it is a harder task to read it
with sustained merriment. By writing so much the author has shown
how mechanical his method really is, and, with all respect for the
cleverness of the writers of Gaiety burlesques, one doubts if anybody
could be amused by reading one of them if it ran to five hundred
pages. That is, however, the sort of task which Mark Twain offers to
his readers. One may be pardoned for confessing that the task has
proved too severe. A trial of several chapters taken at random shows
that the author is still as fresh as ever in his racy contrasts between
things ancient and modern, and as quaint in his droll expressions. He
can raise a laugh once, twice, or even twenty times, but not a
thousand.</p>

<p>Of all the extraordinary conceits that have germinated in his fruitful
imagination, nothing more delicious has ever occurred to Mark Twain
than that of running riot among the legendary times of our ancestral race
by placing "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court." These
quoted  words form the title of the latest successor to<i> Innocents
Abroad</i>. Here is a rare field for the unbridled play of fancy, and right
bravely has the author used his opportunity. There is a most audacious
rollicking around among the dusty bric-a-brac of chivalry -- which is not
handled at all gently -- and a merry tossing about of poetic finery in a
way that  ruthlessly exposes in their literal ugliness the illusively mantled
facts. Of course there is most abundant fun, and Mark Twain's rich
humor never coursed more freely than here, where just provocation is
never absent.  But there is much more than this; the sources of the
claims of aristocratic privileges and royal prerogatives that yet linger in
the world  are so exposed to the full glare of the sun of 19th century
common sense, are shown in so ridiculous an aspect, that the work can
hardly fail to do yeoman service in destroying the still existing remnants
of respect for  such pretensions. Through the book there is a steady
flowing undercurrent of earnest purpose, and the pages are eloquent
with a true American love of freedom, a sympathy with the rights of the
common people, and an indignant hatred of oppression of the poor, the
lowly and the weak, by the rich, the powerful and the  proud. While
much false glamour is dispelled by resolving it into  absurdity under the
touchstone of truth, the book is marked by real beauty, by a poetry of
style worthy of its rich material, with much sympathetic tenderness, as
well as frankness of speech. The quaint early English speech is handled
with the same artistic skill that characterized the author's facile handling
of the stately Elizabethan in  that lovely idyll of childhood, <i>The
Prince and the Pauper</i>, and the constant admixture of a concisely
expressive American vernacular thereto makes a contrast of lingual
coloring that is unspeakably delightful.</p>

<p>We may fancy that the same matter-of-fact Englishman who
seriously reasoned that certain statements in <i>Innocents Abroad</i>
were preposterously absurd, and could not be based upon fact, might
again step forward to break a lance against this book by showing, from
historical and philological data, that such a language could not possibly
have been spoken in the sixth century, since the English tongue did not
exist, and that the use of Norman French names before the conquest is
anachronistic in the highest degree! But this is an excursion back into
the England of the chronicles, and not of strict chronology, and that
eminent ethnologist, Tylor, would undoubtedly perceive with delight the
accuracy of scientific perception in the treatment of human nature which
marks the book. For, in order to characterize with truth a past period
we must make ourselves familiar with some existing state of society that
is analogous therewith. Only under such conditions can a faithful
historical romance be written, for otherwise the writer cannot fail to
modernize his work, and falsify its life with 19th century sentiments that
could not have been known in a previous age. By resorting to the
principle that "distribution in time" is paralleled by "distribution in
space," we may solve many a problem. So there is a certain aspect of
sober truth  in this most fanciful tale, and, just as the Connecticut
Yankee went back into the days of King Arthur's court, so might he go
out into the world today, into Central Asia or Africa, or even into
certain spots in this United States of ours, find himself amidst social
conditions very similar to those of 1300 years ago, and even work his
astonishing 19th century miracles with like result. For it is a fact that,
when Frank Hamilton Cushing astounded the Zuni Indians with an
acoustic telephone constructed of two tomato cans and a string, they
deemed him a magician, and tried him for witchcraft. And, for parallels
of the inhumanities which, as we here read of them, seem to have been
left far behind us in the track of the centuries, we have but to look with
George Kennan into the dungeons of Siberia; and, in our own country,
read the records of the investigations into the horrors of the almshouses,
jails and lunatic hospitals here in this enlightened commonwealth of
Massachusetts so late as the time of Horace Mann, or look to the record
of the nameless barbarities of negro slavery alive in the memories of men
still young. How the conscience and the sympathies of the world have
quickened with the advent of the railway, the steamship and the
telegraph! We have, after all, but just passed out across the threshold of
the dark ages, and, in view of the few steps we have taken, we can
hardly doubt that we are yet to make an infinitely mightier progress into
the light of a genuine civilization, putting far behind us the veneered
barbarism of the present, that still retains the old standards of conduct
and intercourse for our guidance in all "practical" affairs.</p>
<p>As an instance of the scientific fidelity of this book in its picture of
mediaeval society, we may take this from the description of the
company at King Arthur's Round Table, around which there was an
average of about two dogs to one man, watching for bones:</p>
<center>LINK CY1</center>

<p>The following also illustrates an exact perception of the essentially
savage traits of such a people: "Finally it occurred to me all of a sudden
that these animals didn't reason; that they never put this and that
together; that all their talk showed that they didn't know a discrepancy
when they saw it." Again, when Sir Sagramour le Desirous caught a
chance remark of the Yankee applied to some one else and thought it
meant for him, and so challenged him to the memorable encounter that
took place several years after, and was fought with lariat versus lance,
the "Sir Boss," as he was called said: "Whenever one of those people
got a thing into his head, there was no getting it out again. I knew that,
so I saved my breath, and offered no explanations." The foregoing
characterizations might apply equally well to a tribe of Dakota Indians,
to their hardly more civilized foes, the cowboys of the plains, to the
mountaineers of Tennessee and Georgia, or even to the savages in our
great city slums.</p>

<p>By some strange means, perhaps more marvellous than those by
which Edward Bellamy transferred the hero of <i>Looking
Backward</i> forward to the year 2000, the Yankee is carried back
1300 years in time, and in the record of his adventures affords us
another and very instructive sort of <i>Looking Backward</i>.</p>

<p>The advance in the art of popular bookmaking in the past two
decades is illustrated by the contrast between <i>Innocents Abroad</i>
and this volume. In illustration, the progress is particularly notable. Even
a child of today would turn in contempt from the crude woodcuts of the
former to the beautiful pen-and-ink drawings by Dan Beard that adorn
the new work. These drawings are graceful, picturesque and thoroughly
characteristic of the spirit of the book. Many of them embody instructive
allegories, as, for instance, in a cut of Justice, with her scales, one
containing the heavy hammer of "Labor" and the other the baubles of
"Aristocracy," but the latter made to outweigh the former by means of
the string of "Self-interest," artfully attached to the toe of "Law," who
stands by; another, in a similar vein, shows the Justice of the 19th
century and Justice of the sixth century standing opposite each other,
and simultaneously remarking, "Sister, your blind is disarranged," for,
with the same manner of string attached to the toe of each, "Money" is
made to outweigh "Labor" by the former, just as titles are made heavier
in the balance by the latter. One little cut shows "Decorations of Sixth
Century Aristocracy" as "Rewards for all Babes Born Under Specified
Conditions," such as "Slave Driver," "Robber of Unarmed Savages,"
"Robber of Orphans," "Absorber of Taxes," "Murderer of Rivals," etc.,
the whole supported by "Honi soit qui mal y pense!" Another illustrates
the remark of the king concerning a peasant: "Brother! to dirt like this?"
by depicting the three phases of oppression of man by man, first by
violence under the sword of royal power, then by the book of "law,"
making man subject to the slave driver's lash, and last, the subjection of
the workingman to the millions of the monopolist. A strong and spirited
picture of an arrogant slave driver shows in its face the unmistakable
portrait of a celebrated American billionaire and stock gambler.</p>

<p>We are so accustomed to regard England of today as "essentially a
republic, with a monarchical head," that it seems strange that the
utterances of this book, so thoroughly in accordance with accepted
American ideas, should find any difficulty in obtaining publicity in
England, yet so strong is the prejudice there still that its English
publisher has cut out some of the best passages, including a portion of
the preface, with some persiflage about "the divine right of kings."</p>

<P>Mark Twain's latest book, which his publishers have brought out
in a handsome volume, seems to us the poorest of all his productions
thus far. The conceit of taking a Yankee of this generation of
telephones and the electric light back to King Arthur's Court may
please some minds, if presented in a story of moderate length, but
there can be few who will really enjoy it when long-drawn out to the
extent of nearly six hundred pages. Whatever value Mr. Clemens might
have incidentally imparted to his burlesque by giving something like a
correct picture of the customs of the time in which the mythical King
flourished is entirely absent. He has crowded into his picture a great
number of episodes illustrating "ungentle laws and customs" which are
historical, indeed; but he says:</p>

<p><font size=-1>It is not pretended that these laws and customs
existed in England in the sixth century; no, it is only pretended that,
inasmuch as they existed in the English and other civilizations of far
later times, it is safe to consider that it is no libel upon the sixth
century to suppose them to have been in practice in that day also. One
is quite justified in inferring that wherever one of these laws or
customs was lacking in that remote time, its place was competently
filled by a worse one.</font></p>

<p>Mr. Clemens' method of writing history would justify him in
picturing the Connecticut of the seventeenth century as afflicted with
loose divorce customs and great corruption at the polls -- or
something worse -- simply because these are vices of the nineteenth
century! To crowd into a representation of one age the social evils of
all its successors known to us, and to omit those special redeeming
features of the time which made life tolerable, is a very irrational
proceeding.</p>
<p>The serious aim under Mark Twain's travesty is the glorification of
American Protestant democracy. The effort fails through the extreme
partiality of the procedure. Even a Mark Twain, the persistent teacher
of irreverence for great men and great events, should have some little
respect left for fair play. Mr. Clemens' previous books have been bad
enough in their strong encouragement of one of the worst tendencies
in a democratic State, the inclination to sheer flippancy and unmanly
irreverence in the face of the natural sanctities of private life and the
grand heroisms of human history. But this volume goes much further
in its endeavor to belittle a century surrounded with romantic light by
men of later times, who thus fell back upon poetry as a slight relief to
the hard prose of their actual lot. A buffoon, like the hero of this tale,
playing his contemptible tricks where Sir Thomas Malory has trod with
a noble teaching of knightly courtesy, and uttering his witless jokes
where Tennyson has drawn so many a high moral of true gentleness, is
a sorry spectacle. It is not calculated to make a reflecting person proud
of a shallow and self-complacent generation which can enjoy such
so-called humor.</p>

<p>The one consolation to be derived from this melancholy product of
the American mind in the ninth decade of the nineteenth century is
that, equally in its serious and in its jesting parts, it must bring about a
healthy reaction in some of its admiring readers because it overshoots
the mark; because its history is perverse, in its one-sided accumulation
of evils; and because its humor will be wearisome in the extreme when
its falsity is seen.</p>

<p>When Mr. Clemens relates his Life on the Mississippi with
characteristic American exaggeration, we cannot fail to laugh and
become friends. But when he prostitutes his humorous gift to the base
uses of historical injustice, democratic bigotry, Protestant intolerance,
and nineteenth-century vainglory, we must express the very sincere
animosity we feel at such a performance. If anything could be less of a
credit to our literature than the matter of this book, it certainly is the
illustrations which disfigure it. A Protestant of the Protestants himself,
the writer of this review cannot refrain from thus freeing his soul in the
cause of literary decency when the Roman Catholic Church, that is to
say the Christian Church in one of the noblest periods of its history, is
thus grossly assailed by the writer and the illustrator of this tiresome
travesty.</p>

<p>...Mr. Clemens, we call him, rather than Mark Twain, because we
feel that in this book our arch-humorist imparts more of his personal
quality than in anything else he has done. Here he is to the full the
humorist, as we know him; but he is very much more, and his strong,
indignant, often infuriate hate of injustice, and his love of equality, burn
hot through the manifold adventures and experiences of the tale. What
he thought about prescriptive right and wrong, we had partly learned in
<i>The Prince and the  Pauper</i>, and in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, but
it is this last book which gives his whole mind. The elastic scheme of the
romance allows it to play freely back and forward between the sixth
century and the nineteenth century; and often while it is working the
reader up to a blasting contempt of monarchy and aristocracy in King
Arthur's time, the dates are magically shifted under him, and he is
confronted with exactly the same principles in Queen Victoria's time.
The delicious satire, the marvellous wit, the wild, free, fantastic humor
are the colors of the tapestry, while the texture is a humanity that lives
in every fibre. At every moment the scene amuses, but it is all the time
an object-lesson in democracy. It makes us glad of our republic and our
epoch; but it does not flatter us into a fond content with them; there are
passages in which we see that the noble of Arthur's day, who battened
on the blood and sweat of his bondmen, is one in essence with the
capitalist of Mr. Harrison's day who grows rich on the labor of his
underpaid wagemen. Our incomparable humorist, whose sarcasm is so
pitiless to the greedy and superstitious clerics of Britain, is in fact of the
same spirit and intention as those bishops who, true to their office,
wrote the other day from New York to all their churches in the
land:</p><lb>
<p>It is a fallacy in social economics, as well as in Christian thinking, to
look upon the labor of men and women and children as a commercial
commodity, to be bought and sold as an inanimate and irresponsible
thing.... The heart and soul of a man cannot be bought or hired in any
market, and to act as if they were not needed in the doing of the world's
vast work is as unchristian as it is unwise. </p><lb>
<p>Mr. Clemens's glimpses of monastic life in Arthur's realm are true
enough; and if they are not the whole truth of the matter, one may easily
get it in some such book as Mr. Brace's <i>Gesta Christi</i>, where the
full light of history is thrown upon the transformation of the world, if
not the church, under the influence of Christianity. In the mean time, if
any one feels that the justice done the churchmen of King Arthur's time
is too much of one kind, let him turn to that heart-breaking scene where
the brave monk stands with the mother and her babe on the scaffold,
and execrates the hideous law which puts her to death for stealing
enough to keep her from starving. It is one of many passages in the
story where our civilization of to-day sees itself mirrored in the cruel
barbarism of the past, the same in principle, and only softened in
custom. With shocks of consciousness, one recognizes in such episodes
that the laws are still made for the few against the many, and that the
preservation of things, not men, is still the ideal of legislation. But we do
not wish to leave the reader with the notion that Mr. Clemens's work is
otherwise than obliquely serious. Upon the face of it you have a story no
more openly didactic than <i>Don Quixote</i>, which we found
ourselves more than once thinking of, as we read, though always with
the sense of the kindlier and truer heart of our time. Never once, we
believe, has Mark Twain been funny at the cost of the weak, the
unfriended, the helpless; and this is rather more than you can say of Cid
Hamet ben Engeli. But the two writers are of the same humorous
largeness; and when the Connecticut man rides out at dawn, in a suit of
Arthurian armor, and gradually heats up under the mounting sun in what
he calls that stove; and a fly gets between the bars of his visor; and he
cannot reach his handkerchief in his helmet to wipe the sweat from his
streaming face; and at last when he cannot bear it any longer, and
dismounts at the side of a brook, and makes the distressed damsel who
has been riding behind him take off his helmet, and fill it with water, and
pour gallon after gallon down the collar of his wrought-iron cutaway,
you have a situation of as huge a grotesqueness as any that Cervantes
conceived.</p>

<p>The distressed damsel is the Lady Corisande; he calls her Sandy, and
he is troubled in mind at riding about the country with her in that way;
for he is not only very doubtful that there is nothing in the castle where
she says there are certain princesses imprisoned and persecuted by
certain giants, but he feels that it is not quite nice: he is engaged to a
young lady in East Hartford, and he finds Sandy a fearful bore at first,
though in the end he loves and marries her, finding that he hopelessly
antedates the East Hartford young lady by thirteen centuries. How he
gets into King Arthur's realm, the author concerns himself as little as any
of us do with the mechanism of our dreams. In fact the whole story has
the lawless operation of a dream; none of its prodigies are accounted
for: they take themselves for granted, and neither explain nor justify
themselves. Here he is, that Connecticut man, foreman of one of the
shops in Colt's pistol factory, and full to the throat of the invention and
the self-satisfaction of the nineteenth century, at the court of the mythic
Arthur. He is promptly recognized as a being of extraordinary powers,
and becomes the king's right-hand man, with the title of The Boss; but
as he has apparently no lineage or blazon, he has no social standing, and
the meanest noble has precedence of him, just as would happen in
England to-day. The reader may faintly fancy the consequences flowing
from this situation, which he will find so vividly fancied for him in the
book; but they are simply irreportable. The scheme confesses allegiance
to nothing; the incidents, the facts follow as they will. The Boss cannot
rest from introducing the apparatus of our time, and he tries to impart
its spirit, with a thousand most astonishing effects. He starts a daily
paper in Camelot; he torpedoes a holy well; he blows up a party of
insolent knights with a dynamite bomb; when he and the king disguise
themselves as peasants, in order to learn the real life of the people, and
are taken and sold for slaves, and then sent to the gallows for the
murder of their master, Launcelot arrives to their rescue with live
hundred knights on bicycles. It all ends with the Boss's proclamation of
the Republic after Arthur's death, and his destruction of the whole
chivalry of England by electricity.</p>

<p>We can give no proper notion of the measureless play of an
imagination which has a gigantic jollity in its feats, together with the
tenderest sympathy. There are incidents in this wonder-book which
wring the heart for what has been of cruelty and wrong in the past, and
leave it burning with shame and hate for the conditions which are of like
effect in the present. It is one of its magical properties that the fantastic
fable of Arthur's far-off time is also too often the sad truth of ours; and
the magician who makes us feel in it that we have just begun to know
his power, teaches equality and fraternity in every phase of his
phantasmagory.</p>

<p>He leaves, to be sure, little of the romance of the olden time, but no
one is more alive to the simple, mostly tragic poetry of it; and we do not
remember any book which imparts so clear a sense of what was truly
heroic in it. With all his scorn of kingcraft, and all his ireful contempt of
caste, no one yet has been fairer to the nobility of character which they
cost so much too much to develop. The mainly ridiculous Arthur of Mr.
Clemens has his moments of being as fine and high as the Arthur of
Lord Tennyson; and the keener light which shows his knights and ladies
in their childlike simplicity and their innocent coarseness throws all their
best qualities into relief. This book is in its last effect the most
matter-of-fact narrative, for it is always true to human nature, the only
truth possible, the only truth essential, to fiction. The humor of the
conception and of the performance is simply immense; but more than
ever Mr. Clemens's humor seems the sunny break of his intense
conviction. We must all recognize him here as first of those who laugh,
not merely because his fun is unrivalled, but because there is a force of
right feeling and clear thinking in it that never got into fun before,
except in <i>The Bigelow Papers</i>. Throughout, the text in all its
circumstance and meaning is supplemented by the illustrations of an
artist who has entered into the wrath and the pathos as well as the fun of
the thing, and made them his own.</p>

<p>This kind of humor, the American kind, the kind employed in the
service of democracy, of humanity, began with us a long time ago; in
fact Franklin may be said to have torn it with the lightning from the
skies. Some time, some such critic as Mr. T. S. Perry (if we ever have
another such) will study its evolution in the century of our literature and
civilization; but no one need deny himself meanwhile the pleasure we
feel in Mr. Clemens's book as its highest development.</p>

At this holiday season, in books and newspapers, on stage and in
drawing-room, the poet and the painter, the author, the actor, and
the dramatist compete with one another to bring before young and
old scenes and suggestions of beauty, heroism, purity, and truth. One
writer is an exception. M<font size=-1>ARK</font> T<font size=-1>WAIN</font>
sets himself to show the seamy side of the
legendary Round Table of King A<font size=-1>RTHUR'S</font>
time. He depicts all the vices of feudalism -- the licentiousness of the
nobles, their arrogance and insolence to the middle classes, their
neglect of the poor, their hours of gluttony and idleness, varied by
raids and brawls and riotous disorders. He describes how a Yankee
visiting the Court uses modern inventions, defeats the best warriors,
and redresses the wrongs of the poor. It is quite possible that a
serious purpose underlies what otherwise seems a vulgar travesty.
We have every regard for M<font size=-1>ARK</font> T<font
size=-1>WAIN</font> -- a writer who has enriched English
literature by admirable descriptions of boy life, and who in <i>The
Prince and the Pauper</i> has given a vivid picture of
medi&aedig;val times. A book, however, that tries to deface our
moral and literary currency by bruising and soiling the image of King
A<font size=-1>RTHUR</font>, as left to us by legend and
consecrated by poetry, is a very unworthy production of the great
humourist's pen. No doubt there is one element of wit -- incongruity
-- in bringing a Yankee from Connecticut face to face with feudal
knights; but sharp contrast between vulgar facts and antique ideas is
not the only thing necessary for humour. If it were, then a travelling
Cockney putting a flaming tie round the neck of the "Apollo
Belvidere," or sticking a clay pipe between the lips of the "Venus de
Medici," would be a matter-of fact M<font size=-1>ARK</font>
T<font size=-1>WAIN</font>, and as much entitled to respect.
Burlesque and travesty are satire brought down to the meanest
capacity, and they have their proper province when pretentious
falsehoods put on the masks of solemnity and truth. Stilted tragedies,
artificial melodramas, unnatural acting, are properly held up to
ridicule on the stage or in parodies. The mannerisms of a popular
writer like C<font size=-1>ARLYLE</font>, B<font size=-1>ROWNING</font>,
or even T<font size=-1>ENNYSON</font>,
may, through caricature, be good-humouredly exposed; but an attack
on the ideals associated with King A<font size=-1>RTHUR</font> is
a coarse pandering to that passion for irreverence which is at the
basis of a great deal of Yankee wit. To make a jest of facts, phrases,
or words -- Scriptural, heroic, or legendary -- that are held in awe or
reverence by other men is the open purpose of every witling on a
Western print, who  endeavours to follow in the footsteps of A<font
size=-1>RTEMUS</font> W<font size=-1>ARD</font>, B<font
size=-1>RET</font>  H<font size=-1>ARTE</font>, and M<font
size=-1>ARK</font> T<font size=-1>WAIN</font>. They may
finally be successful enough to destroy their own trade. They now
live by shocking decent people who still retain love for the Bible,
H<font size=-1>OMER</font>, S<font size=-1>HAKESPEARE</font>, S<font
size=-1>COTT</font>, and
T<font size=-1>ENNYSON</font>; but when they have thoroughly
trained a rising generation  to respect nothing their irreverence will
fall flat.</p>

<p>The stories of King A<font size=-1>RTHUR</font> that have
come down to us represent in  legendary form not any historical fact,
but an ideal of kingship and  knighthood which had birth in the hearts
and aspirations of medi&aelig;val men. This was their ideal of what a
King amongst his warriors ought to be, and the beautiful image has
fired the thoughts and purified the imagination of millions of men and
women for many generations. Will this shrine in human souls be
destroyed because a Yankee scribe chooses to fling pellets of mud
upon the high altar? The instincts of the past and the genius of
T<font size=-1>ENNYSON</font> have consecrated for ever "the
goodliest fellowship of famous knights Whereof this world holds
record." The Round Table is dissolved, but we can still "delight our
souls with talk of knightly deeds," as they at Camelot in the storied
past. We can still apply the image of the ideal knight as a criterion of
modern worth. King A<font size=-1>RTHUR</font> swore each of
his followers to "reverence his conscience as his King, To ride abroad
redressing human wrongs, To speak no slander, no, nor listen to it,
To honour his own word as if his G<font size=-1>OD'S</font>, To
lead sweet lives in purest chastity. To love one maiden only, cleave
to her, And worship her by years of noble deeds." Such an oath
presented to a modern Yankee would seem to convey in almost every
phrase a covert insult to American institutions. In a land where
commercial fraud and industrial adulteration are fine arts we had
better  omit appeals to "conscience." The United States are not likely
to "ride abroad redressing human wrong" -- as they never gave a
dollar or a man to help Greece, Poland, Hungary, or Italy in their
struggles to be free. "To speak no slander, no, nor listen to it," would
utterly uproot America's free press -- based to a great extent on
scandalous personalities. Loving one maiden only and cleaving to
her must seem too "high-toned" in the States, where there are many
facilities for ready divorce. So far M<font size=-1>ARK</font>
T<font size=-1>WAIN</font> is right as a Western iconoclast to pelt
with sarcasm ideals which are not included in the Constitution or
customs of the United States. Yet, in spite of all that America has
done or can do to deface images of self-sacrifice and beauty, there
are chosen souls in her own borders who have fulfilled the heroic
ideals of the olden time. The Abolitionists of New England
encountered great perils when they first set out to redress the great
human wrong of negro slavery, and they fought as noble a contest
against organised iniquity as any knight of A<font size=-1>RTHUR'S</font> Court.
They faced political obloquy, mob
violence, loss of limb, sometimes of life, and the falling away of
friends and relatives, because they had inherited the old instinct of
knights, to lead lives of duty to their fellow-men. They were jeered
and derided by the M<font size=-1>ARK</font> T<font size=-1>WAINS</font> of
the day, but their foresight was proved at the
end of the war, when the world recognised the two-fold result, "a
nation saved, a race delivered." What, too, would have been the fate
of the Republic if no ideal image of their country shone before the
souls of the men who died to save the Union? Coward souls at the
North said, "It will cost much money and many lives to re-conquer
the South: let them go; let the Republic break up; what is a country
to us?" but a chivalry that came down from British ancestors
animated the  men who followed G<font size=-1>RANT</font>, and
they kept to their high purpose until the field was won. Where was
M<font size=-1>ARK</font> T<font size=-1>WAIN</font> then?
Why did he not satirise the patriotism that would not let a Republic
be  mutilated? Why did he not sneer at Yankee reverence for a paper
Constitution not a hundred years old? Why did he not sing the glories
of trade as better than any preservation of the Union or liberation of
negro slaves?</p>

<p>Even if we look at the real feudalism idealised in the legends of
King A<font size=-1>RTHUR</font>, it was not all evil. No doubt
there were licentious nobles at all times, and there were great
landlords who were occasionally cruel to the peasants in their fields.
The  change to modern times, however, is not all a gain. A great lord
of old held his possessions by "suit and service"; he was bound to
follow his King to the wars. Now he owns his broad lands free of
duty, and may live a life of shameful luxury when he likes. The
peasant of the olden times was not always in distress. The country
was thinly peopled; he had as much land as he wanted;  the woods
were full of wild game, the streams of fish; except on occasions of
rare famine he was fed well. Such a thing as an eviction was
unknown, and for one good reason -- the lord was not only bound to
serve the King, but to bring men for his army; consequently he had an
interest in raising on his estates a body of faithful followers. The
modern landlord drives his peasants into the towns, where, uncared
for by him, they degenerate and die in slums. We must remember,
too, that the vices of the past were characteristic of rough times; they
were the sins of brutality, not of fraud. A bad knight of the feudal age
wronged a maid or widow, and refused redress; but what are the
offences of a commercial age? In America and in England, to a lesser
extent, financial swindling is elaborately organised. The wicked man
of  modern times does not couch his lance against the weak or lowly;
he sends out a prospectus. In twelve months the widow and orphan
are breadless; the promoter and the financier have added another
twenty thousand to their stores. Were King A<font size=-1>RTHUR</font> to descend in
New York to-morrow he would
make for Wall-street, where he would find a host of men whose word
is as good, and as bad, as their bond -- railway schemers who plunder
the shareholders of a continent, and are ever intent by every device of
falsehood and of plot to deceive each other and to defraud the public.
Talk of the inequality of man! King A<font size=-1>RTHUR</font>
and the meanest menial in his halls were nearer to each other in
conditions of life than the cramp in the slums of New York and the
A<font size=-1>STORS</font>, V<font size=-1>ANDERBILTS</font>, and J<font
size=-1>AY</font> G<font
size=-1>OULDS</font> who have piled up millions extracted from
the pockets of less successful men. The Republic is a 'land of liberty,'
yet its commerce, its railways, and is manufactures are in the hands
of a few cliques of almost irresponsible capitalists, who control
tariffs, markets, and politics in order that they may be enriched, to
the disadvantage of the masses. Which, then, is to be most admired --
the supremacy of a knight or the success of a financier?  Under which
King will the Americans serve -- the ideal or the real?  Will they own
allegiance to King A<font size=-1>RTHUR</font> or J<font size=-1>AY</font>
G<font size=-1>OULD</font>?</p>

<p>Mark Twain has never written anything brighter and wittier
than <i>A Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i>, his latest book,
which is now issued with all the advantages of illustrations that add
zest to the great humorist's fun and satire. The book is as able and
original as <i>The Innocents Abroad</i> or <i>Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn</i>, while it bids fair to be fully as popular with
the American public as either of these books. It is one long satire on
modern England and Englishmen, under the clever guise of an
attempt to picture the England of the sixth century and of Arthurian
legend. It is said that Mark wrote the story about seven years ago,
but about the time he had completed it he paid a visit to England
and was received so handsomely that he didn't have the heart to
print his bitter satire, that in places reminds one of Swift. Mark
Twain has come up from the people. He is American to the
backbone, and the assumption of natural superiority by titled
English aristocrats and the terrible wrongs inflicted on the working
people, evidently galled him beyond endurance. He has taken his
revenge in this volume, and a thorough going over it is, for he has
mercilessly flayed the follies, vices, cruelties and false pretensions of
English royalty and aristocracy.</p>

<p>A mere statement of the plot of the story shows the ample field
it gives for "most excellent fooling." Mark pretends to find a
Connecticut Yankee in London who recalls his experiences in the
age of King Arthur. The story is told with great realistic effect, and
the extraordinary contrasts of modern slang and archaic speech, of
nineteenth-century progress and sixth-century superstition, when
developed by a master of the art of humor, are inexpressibly droll.
The Yankee is captured by one of the Knights of the Round Table
and brought to the court, where he is about to be executed as a
curious monster, when he chances to remember that an eclipse
occurs on that day. So he adopts the device which Rider Haggard
has used with so much effect in his African romances, and threatens
to destroy the sun unless he is released. The sun's disk begins to be
obscured and before the eclipse is ended he has been made a great
noble, Sir Boss, with ample revenue, and the office of chief adviser
of the King. Then begin contests with jealous knights and especially
bouts of witchcraft with Merlin, in which the famous magician is
completely vanquished by modern science.</p>

<p>Mark's picture of the deficiencies of the Arthurian court in little
conveniences is very droll. "No soap, no matches, no looking glass,
except a metal one about as powerful as a pail of water, and not a
chromo. I had been used to chromos for years and I saw now that
without my suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the
fabric of my being and had become a part of me." And then the
makeshifts for light -- "a bronze dish half full of boarding-house
butter with a blazing rag floating in it was the thing that produced
what is regarded as a light."</p>

<p>And here is the picture of the people of England at the time of
King Arthur, which, curiously enough, is as applicable to the great
body of Englishmen of to-day as to those of thirteen centuries
ago:</p>


<p>These extracts give a fair idea of the sarcasm which the author
heaps upon England. He is in dead earnest when he gets to tilting at
the divine right of kings and aristocrats to make the people slave
and sweat blood for them, but he unbends when he deals with
chivalry. He has no more reverence for the beautiful legends which
Tennyson has embalmed in his <i>Idyles of the King</i> than Bob
Ingersoll has for St. Peter's or the best works of some of the old
masters. Some of his caricature is very funny, as, for instance, this
bit about the search for the Holy Grail:</p>
<lb>

<p>In the last chapters the author puts no bridle on his
extravagance, and the book ends in scenes of warfare that will make
Haggard green with envy. The illustrations by Dan Beard are full of
humor, and bring out the fun of the story. The book is finely printed
and bound and  lavishly illustrated. For sale by subscription only by
A. L. Bancroft &  Co., 132 Post Street, sole agents for the
coast.</p>

<P>In selecting as the Novel of the Month Mark Twain's new
story, <i>A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur</i>, I am aware
that I expose myself to many remonstrances. There is a certain
profanation in the subject, and withal a certain dulness in its
treatment. It is not a novel; it is a ponderous political pamphlet, and
so forth and so forth. Nevertheless, to those who endeavour to
understand what the mass of men who speak English are thinking,
as opposed to those who merely care about what they think they
ought to be thinking, this book of Mark Twain's is one of the most
significant of our time. It is notable for its faults quite as much as
for its virtues, and for the irreverent audacity of its original
conception as much as for the cumbrous and strenuous moralising
which makes it at times more like one of Jonathan Edwards'
sermons than a mere buoyant and farcical bubbling up of American
humour.</p>

<p>Mark Twain is one of the few American authors whose writings
are popular throughout the English-speaking world. Our superfine
literary men of culture who pooh-pooh the rough rude vigour of the
American humorist represent a small clique. Mark Twain gets
"directlier at the heart" of the masses than any of the blue-china set
of nimminy-pimminy criticasters. In his own country, if we may
judge from the remarks in the January <i>Harper</i>, <i>A Yankee
at the Court of King Arthur</i> has been received with an
enthusiasm which it has hitherto failed to evoke on this side of the
Atlantic. We read there that</p>
<p>the delicious satire, the marvellous wit, the wild, free, fantastic
humour, are the colours of the tapestry, while the texture is a
humanity that lives in every fibre. We can give no proper notion of
the measureless play of an imagination which has a gigantic jollity in
its feats, together with the tenderest sympathy. The humour of the
conception and of the performance is simply immense; but more
than ever Mr. Clemens's humour seems the sunny break of his
intense conviction.</p>

<p>What a contrast this to the frigid condemnation of the
<i>Speaker</i>: "In his last book Mr. Clemens fails to make us
laugh by any method, even the worst. He is not only dull when he is
offensive, but perhaps even more dull when he is didactic." Yet I
make free to say that the vote of the mass of English people would
be on the side of the American and against the English critic. For
what our critical class has failed to appreciate is that the Education
Act has turned out and is turning out millions of readers who are
much more like the Americans in their tastes, their ideas, and their
sympathies than they are to the English of the cultured, pampered,
and privileged classes. The average English speaking man is the
product of the common school in America, of the public elementary
school in Britain and Australia. His literary taste is not classical but
popular. He prefers Longfellow to Browning, and as a humorist he
enjoys Mark Twain more than all the dainty wits whose delicately
flavoured quips and cranks delight the boudoir and the
drawing-room. This may be most deplorable from the point of view
of the supercilious &aelig;sthetes, but the fact in all its brutality
cannot be too frankly recognised.</p>

<p>Another circumstance which gives significance to the book is
the fact that it is the latest among the volumes whereby Americans
are revolutionising the old country. The two books which have
given the greatest impetus to the social-democratic movement in
recent years have both come to us from America. Henry George's
land nationalisation theories were scouted by the superfine, but they
have gained a firm hold of the public mind. His book has circulated
everywhere, and is still circulating. Of another kind, but operating
in the same direction, is Edward Bellamy's <i>Looking
Backwards</i>, which has supplied our people with a clearly
written-out apocalypse of the new heaven and the new earth that
are to come after the acceptance of the Evangel of Socialism. Mark
Twain's book is a third contribution in the same direction. His
Yankee is a fierce and furious propagandist of anti-monarchical and
aristocratic ideas. Under the veil of sarcasms levelled at King
Arthur we see a genial mockery of the British monarchy of to-day,
with its Royal grants and all its semi-feudal paraphernalia. Nor is it
only at British abuses Mark Twain levels his burly jests. He thwacks
the protectionist American as readily as the aristocratic Briton.
There is something infinitely significant in the very form of his
satire. If there is nothing sacred to a sapper, neither can there be
anything sacred to a descendant of the men of the
<i>Mayflower</i>, who has all the fervour of Mr.
Zeal-for-the-Lord-Busy and the confident, complacent assurance of
Sam Slick, who dismissed unceremoniously the authority of Plato
or Aristotle with the observation that we need not heed what they
said as there were no railways in their times. Here is the New
England Democrat and Puritan as passionately sympathetic with the
common man as the nobles and knights whom he scourges were
sympathetic with men of their order, determined to avenge the
injustice of centuries and by holding the mirror up to fact to punish
the chivalric age by showing how it treated the common man. It is
not longer enough to judge systems of to-day by the effect which
they have upon Hodge the ploughman and Bottom the weaver; the
war must be carried into the enemy's camp, the verdict of history
must be reversed, and all our ideals of the past transformed in the
light of this new and imperious interrogation -- The labouring man,
what did that age or that institution make of him?</p>

<p>Tennyson sang the idyls of the King, and as long as the world
lasts Sir Thomas Malory's marvellous old Romance will fill the
hearts and imaginations of men with some far-off reflection of the
splendours and the glories of that child-like age. But truly he sang
"the old order changeth, giving place to the new," of which can we
have a more notable and even brutal illustration than the apparition
of this vulgar Yankee realist, with his telephones and his dynamite,
his insufferable slang and his infinite self-conceit, in the midst of
King Arthur's Court applying to all the knighthood of the Round
Table the measure of his yard-stick, -- the welfare of the common
man? It is the supreme assertion of the law of numbers, of the
application of the patent arithmetical proposition that ten is more
than one, to the problems of politics and of history.
Tennyson himself, in the "Last Tournament," supplied a vivid
picture, which may well serve as a frontispiece of Mark Twain's
vision:</p>
<p>Into the hall swaggered, his visage ribbed<lb>
From ear to ear with dog whip-weals, his nose<lb>
Bridge-broken, one eye out and one hand off,<lb>
And one with shattered fingers dangling, lame;<lb>
A churl, to whom indignantly the king,<lb>
"My churl, for whom Christ died; what evil beast<lb>
Hath drawn his claws athwart thy face? or fiend,<lb>
Man, was it who marr'd heaven's image in thee thus?"</p>

<p>The churl for whom Christ died is the centre of Mark Twain's
story, which is a long and a passionate attempt to suggest that the
evil beast who marred the visage of the poor wretch was the
three-headed chimera of Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Church. There
is much strange misreading of history caused by the extent to which
Mark Twain has allowed the abuses of institutions to obscure their
use.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smedes' <i>A Southern Planter</i> and Mark Twain's
new lapse into Ibsenity and the cultus of the thesis, <i>A Yankee at
the Court of King Arthur</i>, appear about the same time, and both
are pretty sure to be widely read in Britain: the latter because Mark
Twain is currently believed to have been once a writer of funny
books, and the former because the Sage of Hawarden has blessed it.
He is not always happy, is the Sage of Hawarden, in his selection of
books to dignify with his <i>imprimatur</i>, having a natural and
peculiar leaning to religious fiction; but in commending <i>A
Southern Planter</i> to British readers he has done well. Mrs.
Smedes' book and Mark Twain's have at first sight little enough in
common but their transatlantic origin; but that view is naught.
Nothing could be further removed from the blatant frivolity of the
Yankee exwag -- "our arch-humourist," as Mr. de Howells styles
him in the current <i>Harper</i>, not without a hint of unconscious
pathos -- than the record of a noble life which Mrs. Smedes has
written with such simple piety; and had Mr. Clemens been content
to write about the court of King Arthur as he wrote about Arkansas
and the Mexican Plug no one would have mentioned the two in the
same breath.</p>

<p>For in those days Mr. Clemens lived to make the light-hearted
laugh; and his life was a success. But he has exhausted his vein, and
with faded cap and fools' bells jangled has got bewrayed with
seriousness and bedevilled with a purpose. He treats you to a
"lecture" in dispraise of monarchical institutions and religious
establishments as the roots of all evil, and in praise of Yankee
'cuteness and Wall Street chicanery as compared to the simple
fidelity and devotion of the knightly ideal. The key to this precious
piece of apostolics is contained in a frontispiece where the Supreme
Yank, the Connecticut man in a state of heroism, the Bagman <i>in
excelsis</i>, is pictured in the act of tickling the nose of the British
Lion with a switch. Now the life of Thomas Dabney -- Virginian
aristocrat and slave-owner-- is an effective commentary on such
violent vulgarity. He was full of just those qualities which make the
memory of King Arthur fragrant. The mainspring of his life was not
the almighty dollar but <i>noblesse oblige</i>. Amid the prosperity
of his plantation times, as amid the havoc wrought on his and his
country's fortunes by the war, his supreme purpose was to fulfil the
honourable ideal of a gentleman. Such an ideal is no doubt
inconsistent with the democratic notions of the superior Yank; but
it is not the least precious heritage in the world's history for all that,
and Mr. Clemens stamps himself when he makes the bagman's
mistake of bedaubing it with cheap wit. It is the ideal which in
English literature animated Sir Roger de Coverley, and Mr.
Allworthy, and Colonel Newcome, of whose virtues, indeed, the life
of Thomas Dabney was in many ways a realisation. Mrs. Smedes
has done her part of the work very well, except that she might have
cut down the correspondences with advantage. As for Mark Twain,
he has turned didactic, and being ignorant is also misleading and
offensive. His method, which was that of Hamibel Chollop, consists
in attributing every social, political, and economic evil to the Crown
and the Church. That slavery and Protection have flourished under
American republican institutions does not hinder the ingenious
creature from attributing their existence to monarchy and what he
calls the Established Roman Catholic Church. To him that is
decorous and just. But then he is a bagman with a thesis, and his
notions of justice and decorum are of those that commend
themselves to none but renegade Europians -- Europians of the
stamp of Mr. Andrew Carnegie. To add to all this that Mr. W. de
Howells has taken occasion to contrast him and his achievement in
bagmanising with Cervantes and <i>Don Quixote</i>, somewhat to
the disadvantage of the latter, is to begin to pity the poor devil.
After all, he knows no better; after all, he is the parent of Huck Finn
and Jim the Nigger and the genuine Mexican Plug and the
incomparable Blue Jay.  What should he do where Arthur first in
court began whose  proper place is the Capitol, or Tammany Hall,
or the shadow of  the Saint Louis Bridge? What should he do with
a thesis? What  he really wants is a wooden nutmeg or a
razor-strop.</p>

<p>Mark Twain is also somewhat affected by the Spirit of his Time,
which is didactic; and by the Spirit of his Nation, which is inventive,
but not refined. Mr. Lewis Carroll is far beyond Mr. Clemens in points
of delicacy and taste; but it may be doubted whether any English
author of repute would have tried to win a laugh by an irreverant
treatment of the legend of the Holy Grail, as Mr. Clemens has done in
<i>A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur</i>. It is quite certain that
there are few English readers who will care to see the subject begrimed
with prime American jests. Mr. Clemens used to be able to make us
laugh without resorting to this easy and distressing method; in his last
book he fails to make us laugh by any method, even the worst.</p>

<p>But Mr. Clemens is not only dull when he is offensive; he is
perhaps even more dull when he is didactic. His views on the peerage,
religious tolerance, republics, political economy, and the application of
electricity to warfare, may be -- some of them are -- admirable. But
they are out of place in a farcical book: the satire is not fresh; the
information is second-hand or inaccurate; and the moral -- or immoral,
as the case may be -- is clumsily enforced and unduly prominent.
Tediousness is still further ensured by the length of the book. The joke
is a long joke, and the author has not "gompressed him." It would be
idle to point out that the book is not a sketch of the sixth century;
because Mr. Clemens is careful to remove by a prefatory note any such
objection. But he must not think that his confession of incompetence
will make him seem any the less incompetent to the intelligent
reader.</p>

<p>The illustrations to the book are occasionally allegorical, and
remind us of the hieroglyphic which is to be found at the beginning of
prophetic almanacks. In one of them the root of a tree is marked
Religious Intolerence; but the artist spells quite as well as he draws.
They are very badly arranged; they seldom occur at the right place;
and they break into text, making the task of reading very difficult. The
task was hard enough, too, without that. We hope -- we may even
believe --  that we have seen the artist at his worst; we certainly have
not seen the author at his best.</p>

<p>Sometimes we think that we shall never see the author at his best
again. American humour depended much upon quaint and happy
phrase. When these phrases are repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>, their
quaintness and happiness seem to disappear. But we have been
saddened and depressed by reading two long and humorous books,
and are, perhaps unduly inclined to be pessimistic. We had expected to
laugh a little; and, instead of that, we have learned much -- much that
we knew before. And, after all, it must be easy for Mr. Clemens to do
better; and we know why it must.</p>

<p>My dear Mr. Wyndham, -- It has occurred to a good many prophets
since Lord Lytton wrote <i>The Coming Race</i>, -- </p>

<p><font size=-1>To dip into the future, far as human eye could
see,<lb>
Show the vision of the world, and all the wonders that would
be.</font></p>

<p>but it was reserved, I think, for Mark Twain to put on Hans Andersen's
Goloshes of Happiness and go back to the past, carrying with him all the
wonders of the present. <i>A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur</i> is
a bizarre book, full of all kinds of laughable and delightful incongruities --
the most striking of its incongruities, however, being unconscious, grim,
and disenchanting. For Mark Twain, as he goes on, gets into a fury so
ferocious (and natural) with the infernal oppression of the people by the
Nobles, the King, and the Church that he passes in a sentence from
laughing into raving at the "good old times"; and, like Macbeth at sight of
Banquo's ghost, he "displaces the mirth" of the feast he had prepared for
us. His fooling is admirable and his preaching is admirable, but they are
mutually destructive. In every page he preaches pretty much what Richard
Rumbold preached two centuries since -- "I never could believe that
Providence had sent a few men into the world ready booted and spurred
to ride, and millions ready saddled and bridled to be ridden" -- but
Rumbold preached it from the most commanding of pulpits -- the scaffold
-- whereas Mark Twain preaches it from the sawdust of the circus and in
the intervals between a couple of jests or a couple of summersaults. But it
is thoroughly sound doctrine, and is needed still so sorely in England and
Ireland that it is ungracious to grumble at the mode of its delivery. It will
reach a larger audience, and, perhaps, strike many of them more by its
grotesque presentation than if  the preacher wore a less bizarre garb than
motley.</p>
<p><font size=-1>  Ridentem dicere verum<lb>
 Quid vetat? </font></p>

<p>Still, such frightful episodes as that of the woman who was burned to
make a fire to warm a slave gang, or that of the hanging of the young
mother -- wife of the "pressed" man-o'-war's man -- with her baby at her
breast (an incident, by the way, Mr. Mark Twain, not of the sixth century,
but of the beginning of the nineteenth), freeze the laughter on our lips.</p>
