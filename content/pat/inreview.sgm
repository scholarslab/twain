<p>
But for the Introduction to this book, we should have little
difficulty in assigning it its proper place in literature. We should
say at once that the author was draping himself in the garb of one
of those typical Yankee tourists of whom we hear so often, and
whom we do meet occasionally,  --  the tourists who "do"
Europe in six weeks,  --  whose comment on Venice is that
they do not care much for those old towns, and on the Venus de'
Medici that they do not like them stone gals. If we thought at all
about the name on the title-page, we should put it down as a
pseudonym, though the probability is that we should not think
about it. Anyhow, we should come to the conclusion that Mark
Twain, whoever he might be, had hit off the oddities of some of
his countrymen very well; that many of his remarks were
amusing, and almost witty; and that he was certainly not such a
fool as he tried to look. But when Mr. Hingston tells us seriously
that Mark Twain is really the pseudonym of the sub-editor of a
daily paper in a Western city a few months old, that he is a
flower of the wilderness, a thoroughly untravelled American
applying the standard of Nevada to historical Europe, we are
fairly puzzled. We can readily believe that the writer of this book
is ignorant of many of those things which would be familiar to
an English tourist. His remark that "Raphael, Angelo, Canova
 --  giants like these gave birth to the designs" of the statues
on the Cathedral at Milan, is not much more than the hasty
generalization of one who takes his facts from guides and
guide-books. The statement that "Raphael pictured such infernal
villains as Catherine de' Medici seated in heaven and conversing
familiarly with the Virgin Mary and the angels," may surprise
those who remember that Catherine de' Medici was only born
one year before the death of Raphael. Again, we are told that
Raphael is buried in Santa Croce, instead of in the Pantheon; but
we may conclude from this that in Mark Twain's opinion every
great artist should be buried in several places, just as each relic
of a saint is multiplied. We owe this suggestion to what Mark
Twain says of an important fellow-passenger calling himself
Commissioner of the United States of America to Europe, Asia,
and Africa. The comment on this "titular avalanche" is, "to my
thinking, when the United States considered it necessary to send
a dignitary of that tonnage across the ocean, it would be in better
taste and safer to take him apart and cart him over in sections in
several ships."

</p><p>In all these mistakes there is nothing unnatural. Most
men who are not learned, and who do not take the precaution of
using books of reference before they speak, may fall into the
same errors. The only thing that characterizes Mark Twain is the
reckless manner in which he makes his assertions. The greater
his blunder, the more assurance there is in his language. Thus he
says, without the slightest reserve, that the Emperor of the
French "kept his faithful watch and walked his weary beat as a
common policeman of London" as if the special constable of
1848 had been Z 264. Yet it is not till we get beyond the
mistakes that we light on the genuine untravelled American. It
is significant of him that he does not commit himself to facts of
his own, because he is sceptical as to the existence of everything.
He listens gravely to the guide's stories, and then asks some
question which reduces them to an absurdity. He finds everybody
else admiring a picture, and that is enough to set him against it.
By putting a number of exaggerations together he deprives any
little grain of truth of its value. This is the man who, in the
present volume, remarks that the Italians spell a word Vinci and
pronounce it Vinchy, adding calmly, "foreigners always spell
better shall they pronounce." He, too, when shown the writing of
Christopher Columbus observes, "Why, I have seen boys in
America only fourteen years old that could write better than that.
You mustn't think you can impose on us because we are
strangers. We are not fools by a good deal. If you have got any
specimens of penmanship of real merit, trot them out, and if you
haven't, drive on!" There are a good many comments on pictures
from the same point of view. Take this on the characters of
Sacred Art:  "When we see a monk sitting on a rock, looking
tranquilly up to heaven, with a human skull beside him and
without other baggage, we know that is St. Jerome; because we
know that he always went flying light in the matter  of baggage.
When we see a party looking tranquilly up to heaven,
unconscious that his body is shot through and through with
arrows, we know that that is St. Sebastian. When we see other
monks looking tranquilly up to heaven, but <i>having no
trade-mark,</i> we always ask who those parties are." Another
question on which the untravelled American is worth hearing is
the ubiquity of guides, with their constant repetition of legends
and their unceasing exaggeration. At Gibraltar one story was
dinned into the tourist's ear, till at last he exclaimed to the
narrator, "Sir, I am a helpless orphan in a foreign land; have pity
on me." One supposed safeguard against invention is that a guide
"would hardly try so hazardous an experiment as the telling of a
falsehood when it is all he can do to speak the truth in English
without getting the lockjaw." But even this seems to have failed
in Rome, if we may judge from the following tirade against the
mythical being to whom the guides give the name of Michael
<a name="1">Angelo:</a>
</p><p>
<xref doc="http://etext.virginia.edu/railton/innocent/linkia4.html">[LINK IA4]</xref>
</p><p>
This last touch is exactly characteristic of the untravelled
American.  In other places, however, the exaggeration to which
Mark Twain gives way shows that he is consciously acting a
part. We do not like him any the worse for that, and without the
preface we should have been easily reconciled to his
eccentricities. His incidental remarks about things in general are
sufficiently humorous to ensure his book a hearing, though they
have the misfortune to contradict Mr. Hingston's theory. The
genuine Yankee tourist would never sneer at one of his fellow
countrymen for ignorance of French manners and assumption of
native superiority. When Mark Twain finds an American
proclaiming his nationality in this offensive way  --  "I am
a freeborn sovereign, Sir, an American, Sir, and I want
everybody to know it"  --  he adds, "the fellow did not
mention that he was a lineal descendant of Balaam's ass, but
everybody knew that without his telling it." Does this come
under the rule of <i>Quis tulerit Gracchos?</i>  We think not.
In our opinion Mark Twain  is merely showing the prevalence of
the faults which he satirizes. He  wishes to remind us that,
whether we take Mr. Hingston's view or the  more natural one,
he is not the only untravellcd American in his party, and that he
is always on the look-out for incidents which may serve his
purpose. In this respect Mark Twain's travels remind us of
<i>The Book of Snobs, </i>where the fancy picture of the author
wholly eclipsed his characters.

<p>The character of American humor, and its want of
resemblance to the humor of Kamtschatka and Patagonia,
 --  will the reader forgive us if we fail to set down here
the thoughts suggested by these fresh and apposite topics? Will
he credit us with a self-denial proportioned to the vastness of
Mr. Clements's very amusing book, if we spare to state why he
is so droll, or  --  which is as much to the purpose  --
why we do not know? This reticence will leave us very little to
say by way of analysis; and, indeed, there is very little to say of
<i>The Innocents Abroad </i>which is not of the most obvious
and easy description. The idea of a steamer-load of Americans
going on a prolonged picnic to Europe and the Holy Land is
itself almost sufficiently delightful, and it is perhaps praise
enough for the author to add that it suffers nothing from his
handling. If one considers the fun of making a volume of six
hundred octavo pages upon this subject, in compliance with one
of the main conditions of a subscription book's success, bigness
namely, one has a tolerably fair piece of humor, without
troubling Mr. Clements further. It is out of the bounty and
abundance of his own nature that he is as amusing in the
execution as in the conception of his work. And it is always
good-humored humor, too, that he lavishes on his reader, and
even in its impudence it is charming; we do not remember
where it is indulged at the cost of the weak or helpless side, or
where it is insolent, with all its sauciness and irreverence. The
standard shams of travel which everybody sees through suffer
possibly more than they ought, but not so much as they might;
and one readily forgives the harsh treatment of them in
consideration of the novel piece of justice done on such a
traveller as suffers under the pseudonyme of Grimes. It is
impossible also that the quality of humor should not sometimes
be strained in the course of so long a narrative; but the wonder
is rather in the fact that it is strained so seldom.
</p><p>
Mr. Clements gets a good deal of his fun out of his
fellow-passengers, whom he makes us know pretty well,
whether he presents them somewhat caricatured, as in the case
of the "Oracle" of the ship, or carefully and exactly done, as in
the case of such a shrewd, droll, business-like, sensible, kindly
type of the American young man as "Dan."  We must say also
that the artist who has so copiously illustrated the volume has
nearly always helped the author in the portraiture of his
fellow-passengers, instead of hurting him, which is saying a
good deal for an artist; in fact, we may go further and apply the
commendation to all the illustrations; and this in spite of the
variety of figures in which the same persons are represented,
and the artist's tendency to show the characters on mules where
the author says they rode horseback.
</p><p>
Of course the instructive portions of Mr. Clements's book are
of a general rather than particular character, and the reader gets
as travel very little besides series of personal adventures and
impressions; he is taught next to nothing about the population
of the cities and the character of the rocks in the different
localities. Yet the man who can be honest enough to let himself
see the realities of human life everywhere, or who has only seen
Americans as they are abroad, has not travelled in vain and is
far from a useless guide. The very young American who told the
English officers that a couple of our gunboats could come and
knock Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea; the American who
at a French restaurant "talked very loudly and coarsely, and
laughed boisterously, where all others were so quiet and well
behaved," and who ordered "wine, sir!" adding, to raise
admiration in a country where wine is as much a matter of
course as soup, "I never dine without wine, sir"; the American
who had to be addressed several times as Gordon, being so
accustomed to hear the name pronounced Gorrdong, and who
had forgotten most English words during a three months'
sojourn in Paris; the Americans who pitilessly made a three
days' journey in Palestine within two days, cruelly overworking
the poor beasts they rode, and overtaxing the strength of their
comrades, in order not to break the Sabbath; the American
Pilgrims who travelled half round the world to be able to take
a sail on the Sea of Galilee, and then missed their sole
opportunity because they required the boatman to take them for
one napoleon when he wanted two;  --   these are all
Americans who are painted to peculiar advantage by Mr.
Clements, and who will be easily recognized by such as have
had the good fortune to meet them abroad.
</p><p>
The didactic, however, is not Mr. Clements's prevailing mood,
nor his best, by any means. The greater part of his book is in the
vein of irony, which, with a delicious impudence, he attributes
to Saint Luke, declaring that Luke, in speaking of the winding
"street, called Straight" in Damascus, "is careful not to commit
himself; he does not say it is the street which <i>is </i>straight,
but the  street which is <i>called </i>Straight.' It is a fine piece
of irony; it is the only facetious remark in the Bible, I believe."
At Tiberias our author saw the women who wear their dowry in
their head-dresses of coins. "Most of these maidens were not
wealthy, but some few have been kindly dealt with by fortune.
I saw heiresses there, worth, in their own right,  --  worth,
well, I suppose I might venture to say as much as nine dollars
and a half.  But such cases are rare. When you come across one
of these, she naturally puts on airs." He thinks the owner of the
horse "Jericho," on which he travelled towards Jerusalem, "had
a wrong opinion about him. He had an idea that he was one of
those fiery, untamed, steeds, but he is not of that character. I
know the Arab had this idea, because when he brought the horse
out for inspection in Beirout, he kept jerking at the bridle and
shouting in Arabic,  Ho! will you? Do you want to run away,
you ferocious beast, and break your neck?' when all the time the
horse was not doing anything in the world, and only looked like
he wanted to lean up against something and think. Whenever he
is not shying at things or reaching after a fly, he wants to do that
yet. How it would surprise his owner to know this!"  In this vein
of ironical drollery is that now celebrated passage in which Mr.
Clements states that he was affected to tears on coming, a
stranger in a strange land, upon the grave of a blood-relation,
 --  the tomb of Adam; but that passage is somewhat more
studied in tone than most parts of the book, which are written
with a very successful approach in style to colloquial drolling.
As Mr. Clements writes of his experiences, we imagine he
would talk of them; and very amusing talk it would be: often
not at all fine in matter or manner, but full of touches of humor,
 --  which if not delicate are nearly always easy,  --
and having a base of excellent sense and good feeling. There is
an amount of pure human nature in the book, that rarely gets
into literature; the depths of our poor unregeneracy  --
dubious even of the blissfulness of bliss  --  are sounded
by such a simple confession as Mr. Clements makes in telling
of his visit to the Emperor of Russia: "I would as soon have
thought of being cheerful in Abraham's bosom as in the palace
of an Emperor." Almost any topic, and any event of the author's
past life, he finds pertinent to the story of European and Oriental
travel, and if the reader finds it impertinent, he does not find it
the less amusing. The effect is dependent in so great degree
upon this continuous incoherence, that no chosen passage can
illustrate the spirit of the whole, while the passage itself loses
half in separation from the context. Nevertheless, here is part of
the account given by Mr. Clements of the Pilgrims' excursion to
the river Jordan, over roads supposed to be infested by
Bedouins; and the reader who does not think it droll as it stands
can go to our author for the <a name="1">rest</a>.

</p><p>
Under his <i>nom de plume</i> of Mark Twain, Mr. Clements
is well known to the very large world of newspaper-readers; and
this book ought to secure him something better than the
uncertain standing of a popular favorite. It is no business of ours
to fix his rank among the humorists California has given us, but
we think he is, in an entirely different way from all the others,
quite worthy of the company of the best.

<p>[These excerpts from newspaper reviews of <i>Innocents Abroad</i> were originally
published by MT in the Buffalo <i>Express</i> (9 October 1869), then included at the end of
the salesman's dummy edition of the book, under the title given above.  Six notices of the lecture

</p>
<hr>

<p>From the Hartford (Ct.) Courant.

</p><p>That the odd genius who described the "Jumping Frog," should go to see and describe
the art-treasures of Europe and the ruins of Egypt and the Holy Land, has something in it very
comical. Mark Twain is a true Californian, with the original, quaint humor of the Pacific; a very
shrewd observer, not by any means unpoetical, but yet delighting to take the traditional poetry
out of things. You may be sure that if he went to Italy or Jerusalem he would not idealize, but
would try to photograph. His very exaggerations are all of the disenchanting sort, and are a very
fair set-off to the usual rhapsodies of most tourists, who see what they have been educated to
expect, and who have tradition so soaked into them that if they sat shivering in Naples in
January, with snow in the streets and ice in the fountains, they would write home about sunny,
delicious Italy. We doubt if the classic lands ever had exactly such a traveler through them as
Mark Twain, who went out on the famous Quaker City excursion to the Holy Land, with a lot of
passengers collected especially, it seemed to him, for the Holy Land, and this book is a dreadfully
real, also a whimsical record of what they did and what they didn't do and see, with sketches of
the pilgrims that all of them cannot regard with complacency. This record has been put into a
large and handsomely printed volume of 651-pages, illustrated with two hundred and thirty-four
cuts of various sorts, views from photographs, portraits, odd costumes, characters, scenes
occurring on shipboard and on land, grave, funny, absurd, but a very good accompaniment to the
text. The book has a great deal of entertainment in it. It has bits of excellent real description, and
when Twain tries to reproduce a scene or describe a place, he does it with wonderful faithfulness.
The author is not straining to be funny; he is not trying to make a joke book; and there is nothing
in it of that painfully unnatural sort of wit that is so wearisome. Very few will be able to read it
without laughing at least half the time. It may be absurd, but it certainly is funny. In the midst of
the most serious passages, some quaint observation is dropped that has a good deal of the quality
of the best humor. To attempt anything like a criticism of Mark Twain's peculiar humor, or to try
to explain why it is that he is able to make people laugh in spite of themselves, is unnecessary
now. The book is full of bright things, shrewd observations, that lurk here and there, and must be
read with the context to be appreciated.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the National (N.J.) Standard.

</p><p>This is the raciest book we have met with for many a day. Much as we had expected to
be pleased, we must truthfully say that we had no idea so much humor, wit, geniality, fine
description and good sense, could be contained within the covers of any one book. It is a splendid
book in every meaning of the word. It is readable, enjoyable, laughable; it is keen, satirical,
comical, and funny; its descriptions are beautiful, and its style is unique, and not of a common
stamp; its morals are of a high tone, and cannot be impeached; it will give the reader a new view
of the countries and people that it describes, showing them upon a side never before exposed. It
is not a book filled with caricature and stale jokes, but a clear, well-written volume upon most
interesting subjects, yet viewing them from an entirely new stand-point, and portraying them in
an original and characteristic manner. We turned over the pages, without selection of pieces, and
commenced reading, and invariably in less than two minutes we were boiling over with laughter.
Our sides ache, and we lay aside the volume to rest, and to advise our friends and readers, one
and all, to buy the book at the first opportunity, and read it through. It is full of excellent
illustrations, in fact, taken all in all, is the jolliest, pleasantest, most fascinating, and handsomest
volume we know of.

</p>
<hr>
<p>From the Meriden (Ct.) Republican.

</p><p>We hope our readers will purchase one new book just as soon as the Agent for this place
shall put in an appearance. We refer to Mark Twain's new book entitled the "New Pilgrim's
Progress." Mark Twain, always interesting, in this book has outrivaled himself. It is instructive,
humorous, racy, full of quaint expressions that make you laugh unexpectedly, and before you are
quite ready; critical, sometimes caustic, but always good natured; never prosy or wearisome. You
begin the book and do not want to leave it till the last line is reached. Mark never describes a
place, or sees a sight as others do. He is intensely original; and for us there is where the charm
lies. It is a work permanently adapted for home reading aloud, and will invariably call up around
the fireside a spirit of mirth and congeniality. No one can read its pages without feeling there is
still beauty and sunshine in the world.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New York Express.

</p><p>It is one of the most quaint and enjoyable books of travel that has been issued from the
press. Certainly, Mark Twain succeeds in dispelling many of the old traditions which travelers
have so long inflicted upon a confiding and long suffering public. He has gone over the ground
with a genuine Yankee spirit, determining to see everything that is to be seen, to see it thoroughly
and like a man of sense, to go into ecstacies [sic] over but few things, and to speak the plain,
unvarnished truth under all circumstances. And this truth is told to us in such a winsome form,
that we cannot but listen to it with agreeable sensations. Throughout runs an undercurrent of
genuine native humor. Not what we are so apt to accept as such, and which is principally
remarkable for its vulgarity and insipidity, but a real, crisp, tangible wit, that speaks in every line
of the vitality, the vigorous honesty of the man, and of how fully he is imbued with all the better
of the national characteristics. The book is a Golconda of wit and a very mine of sparkling
entertainment.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Newark (N.J.) Register.

</p><p>It is a rare and wonderful combination. The humor is natural, never forced; the narrative
is instructive, and the descriptive passages are some of the finest in the English language,
abounding in choice expressions and beautiful metaphor.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Winsted (Ct.) Herald.

</p><p>The book opens richer and richer with every leaf you turn. The next best thing to having
been one of this Holy Land excursion party, is to read this enchanting account of it. Indeed we
guess the book will afford more enjoyment, in proportion to the cost, than did the trip itself. The
book and the trip are just alike in one respect,--when you once get aboard you cannot get away
from it. Perhaps, however, there will be no danger in accompanying the author as far as off Sandy
Hook.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New York Leader.

</p><p>Twain's irony is delicious and far-reaching; his facetious satire penetrates the very soul
of appreciation. His drolleries are wickedly amusing. No one in full sympathy with humor can
read Mark Twain's best things and not laugh heartily over them. Of course his latest work is his
best, as it is his most elaborate effort.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Norwich Bulletin.

</p><p>If people don't stop laughing so immoderately in the dead hours of the night as to keep
their neighbors awake, there will probably be trouble, that's all. The cause is said to be Mark
Twain's new book, which everybody is reading. But that is no excuse.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New York Herald.

</p><p>The "Innocents Abroad" must be read to be thoroughly enjoyed. It is an oasis in the
desert of works on foreign travel, with which we are deluged at the present day. We have read it
through with pleasure, and if Mark Twain will do no worse in future efforts at Book Making, we
will always heartily welcome him at our desk.

</p>
<hr>
<p>From the Mohawk Valley Register.

</p><p>Buy it, and you will bless Mark Twain to the end of your existence.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Liberal Christian, N.Y.

</p><p>It is the record of a party on a holiday excursion, and every page is touched with the
mirth of the happy merry-makers, and in every paragraph you feel a giggle if you do not hear a
laugh. Here are no homilies; no essays on politics, no discussion of philosophies, or art, or
archaeology; yet the book preaches nevertheless, and is full of health and aglow with that
cheerful, hopeful, wholesome religion which has so much faith that it does not fear to crack a
joke or to make one. It tells a great deal that other and more serious writers consider it beneath
their dignity to tell, and it keeps striking the spear-point of its shrewd Yankee common sense into
the cracks and crevices of antique customs and institutions until we half expect a general
tumbling down of European civilization upon the Pilgrims' heads.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New York Evening Post.

</p><p>It contains many scenes of real merriment that few can read without laughter. The
cleverness, frankness, and catholic spirit of the writer are everywhere apparent.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Central Baptist, St. Louis, Mo.

</p>

<p>It abounds in historical and legendary lore, and written in the quaint and serio-comic strain
peculiar to the author, will readily recommend itself to the public.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New York Tribune.

</p><p>It is refreshing to find a tourist who does not care what other tourists have said before
him. Mark Twain must be rated as the chief representative of that peculiar kind of humor whose
principal elements are not bad spelling and verbal burlesque, for he does not practice these arts.
The greater part of his book is pure fun, and its freshness is wonderfully well sustained.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the True American, Trenton, N.J.

</p><p>The work abounds in historical facts, descriptions of different countries and important
personages, scenes and incidents, so bound together by wit, pleasantry and flashes of grotesque
humor, as to make one of the most readable and amusing books of the period.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Providence (R.I.) Morning Herald.

</p><p>He has described with his rare skill and in his best style, the adventures of the company,
as well as his own, which are among the best things in the book. He has left the beaten path of
tourists, and has never pretended an admiration which he did not feel, or which was yielded in
obedience merely to invariable custom. He claims to adhere to the truth and to facts, and in his
book has shorn many of the venerable shams of the old world of the false charms they have
pretended. The stand-point of the traveler is certainly new, and the book throughout bears the
impress of originality. The piquant humor and rare felicity of the text is well sustained by the
numerous engravings, upwards of two hundred in number, with which the book is embellished.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Providence (R.I.) Journal.

</p><p>The book is funny clear through; and if any doubt that fun can be sustained through so
many pages, they can be cured by entering their names upon the subscription list.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Norwich (Ct.) Daily Advertiser.

</p><p>The drollest, funniest, most truthful and readable book of the season is Mark Twain's
account of the pleasure trip of a party on the Quaker City, up the Mediterranean. The writer sees
the humorous side of every thing, or gives a humorous side to serious things, but is not lacking in
power to be sober and wise, and even eloquent, when those qualities seem necessary for effect. If
any one wants a book that will really interest and instruct him about one of the most remarkable
portions of the earth, and at the same time to keep in rollicking good humor, he cannot afford to
be without this book.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New York Times.

</p><p>About one-third of this pleasant book is given to the sacred parts of Asia Minor and
Egypt--showing the mental proclivity of the majority on board the Quaker City. The volume is a
large one of 650 pages, beautifully printed, and swarming with illustrations which, in their own
way, are as effective and amusing as the letter press. It is altogether a very taking book; and a
great many persons who would not care to read the graver accounts of travel through these
world-renowned places, will find themselves very much interested in Mark Twain's humorous
way of getting over the same ground.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Rochester Chronicle.

</p><p>Twain's book is valuable for pricking many of the bubbles and exploding the humbugs
of European travel.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Newark (N.J.) Daily Advertiser.

</p><p>We have one earnest caution for our readers who may buy this book. The writers seeks
to rest your ribs by occassional [sic] fine passages of true eloquence, or sentiment, or sensible
description. But he does not succeed. The book must be taken in interrupted doses. There is more
fun in it than it is safe to swallow at once.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Hartford (Ct.) Times.

</p><p>We are indebted to the publishers for a copy of a new and really unique volume of
travels by that rollicking humorist, "Mark Twain." It is a lively, laughter-exciting book, such as
one rarely meets among volumes of travels; yet the fun is not the only feature of the book. It
abounds in interesting information, conveyed in a wide range of facts, adventures, and personal
experiences. It is fresh, racy and sparkling as a glass of iced champagne, and a good deal better
for the health and digestion. Seated under a shady tree, with this instructive picture book before
him, one can, in most moods, be better entertained than with a living companion. It gives us
living scenes and pictures of life and experience in far distant lands, so graphically portrayed that
the book will make an attractive addition to the treasures of the library and the drawing-table, for
the benefit of one's self or friends in a winter evening. Everybody should buy and read it.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New Jersey Journal.

</p><p>Criticism of the work is almost impossible; as sufficient gravity of countenance for the
purpose, can hardly be maintained over the volume. To think of, or look at it, is to smile, but to
read it is to overwhelm all criticism with uncontrolable [sic] laughter. It is truly an original affair,
and does credit to its author. He treats of subjects of which we supposed we were fully
acquainted in such a manner that we come to the conclusion finally that we are swallowing
sugar-coated statistics,--and are aware that we are digesting much useful and important
information,--learning facts we never knew before,--getting glimpses of scenes and places from
entirely new stand-points, and catching new and quaint ideas, expressed in the most original and
funny manner. Altogether the book is a good one; one we can heartily recommend to our readers.
It is pure in morals, and just the thing for fire-side reading. Buy this Book, say we, and, our word
for it, you will not regret the outlay.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Springfield (Mass.) Union.

</p><p>This is one of the most readable and entertaining books of the season. For years the
quaint humor of Mark Twain has enlivened the columns of the newspapers, and few readers
finish a column of his correspondence without wishing, like Oliver Twist, for more. The present
volume, while brimfull [sic] of humor in almost every page, is by no means a mere jest book, but
contains more information in regard to the places visited by the "Pilgrims" than would be
gathered from many dry books of travel. It is profusely illustrated, and the views, which profess
to be real, are authentic and well-executed; while the comic and fancy sketches aptly illustrate the
drollery of the text.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Springfield (Mass.) Republican.

</p><p>Mr. Clemens brings to his work a free spirit, a lively fancy and an indescribable
emancipation from old trammels of thought and feeling. He is as different from the stock traveler
as he is from Montague or Bunyan's Pilgrim,--sees things that nobody else saw, says things that
nobody else ever thought of saying, and throws over his whole work the charm of an uncouth
freshness.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New York World.

</p><p>No American book of travels contains so much genuine fun. It aims to entertain and it
does. There is a genuine American tone about it which is refreshing to see after the snobberies of
some other American travelers.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New York Sun.

</p><p>He pricks a great many bubbles blown by previous travelers, both in print and out of it;
and where anything seemed to him an imposition or a delusion, he bluntly says so. One cannot
read half a dozen pages of the book without enjoying as many hearty laughs at droll fancies of the
author and the comical tint which he gives to every picture. Aside from its mirth the book
abounds in clear and graphic description, and now and then the author indulges in sentimental
writing and bursts of eloquence quite in contrast with his levity on other pages. Altogether this
book is both instructive and entertaining, which is more than can be said of all travelers' tales.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Paterson Daily Guardian, N.J.

</p><p>It is a large book, but a reading of a few pages is sufficient to convince the reader that
Mark is equal to it, and could stand a good deal larger one. The public could also.

</p>
<hr>
<hr>
<p>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.

</p><p>The author of this work during the past winter delivered in scores of cities in the West,
his popular lecture termed "The American Vandal Abroad," to large and delighted audiences. The
material for that lecture was drawn from this book, and is a fair specimen of its style and quality.
The lecture is spoken of in the following manner by the press:

</p>
<hr>
<p>At Cleveland, Ohio.

</p><p>LIBRARY ASSOCIATION--LECTURE OF "MARK TWAIN."--We shall attempt no
transcript of this lecture, lest with unskillful hands we mar its beauty, for beauty and poetry it
certainly possessed, though the production of a professed humorist.

</p><p>We know not which most to commend, the quaint utterances, the funny incidents, the
good-natured recital of the characteristics of his harmless "Vandal," or the gems of beautiful
description which sparkled all through his lecture. We expected to be amused, but we were taken
by surprise when he carried us on the wings of his redundant fancy, away to the ruins, the
cathedrals, and the monuments of the old world. There are some passages of gorgeous
word-painting which haunt us like a remembered picture. We congratulate Mr. Twain upon
having
taken the tide of public favor "at the flood" in the lecture field, and having conclusively proved
that a man may be a humorist without being a clown. He has elevated the profession by his
graceful delivery and by recognizing in his audience something higher than merely a desire to
laugh. We can assure the cities who are awaiting his coming, that a rich feast is in store for them,
and Cleveland is proud to offer him the first laurel leaf in his role as lecturer, this side the "Rocky
slope."

</p>
<hr>
<p>At Toledo, Ohio.

</p><p>MARK TWAIN'S LECTURE.--White's Hall was filled from cellar to garret, last night,
by one of the best tickled audiences that ever assembled there to hear a lecture or see the speaker.
Mark Twain tickled them. And he did it so easily and almost constantly, that they didn't know
what they were laughing at more than half the time. Twain is witty, and his wit comes from his
own fertile brain. His style is original; and his manner of speaking is not after the manner of men
generally. His serious face and long drawn words are, of themselves, sufficient to make one
laugh, even if there were not in every sentence expressed a sparkling gem of humor and original
idea. His anecdotes, with which the lecture is replete, are rich, and, as he tells them, irresistibly
funny. In some of his descriptions of European places and characters the lecturer delivers, at
times, most eloquent passages, brilliant in thought and word. That Mark Twain is a success as a
lecturer, as well as writer, we think no one who heard "The American Vandal Abroad," last night,
will dispute.

</p>
<hr>
<p>At Sharon, Penn.

</p><p>MARK TWAIN.--This combination of letters spells a name and designates a man for
whom we have the most intense veneration. We had the privilege and pleasure of hearing his
quaint and instructive lecture, the "American Vandal Abroad," on Saturday Evening last. A large
and appreciative audience greeted him, all anxious to hear and see the man who had placed
himself so high in their esteem by the many brilliant witticisms from time to time seized with
avidity by the public press, and through it placed before the world. Mr. Twain was heard and
admired. New and warm friends were added to his list and the old ones retained. Such a deep
interest was manifested in the lecture that at the close a general dissatisfaction was apparent that
he did not speak longer. It seemed too short, but upon consulting the time it was discovered to
the great surprise of all that he had talked one hour and a half. A sermon of the same dimensions
to the self-same audience would have found many dozing, and at the hour of high noon! The
lecture was a grand success. Everybody was pleased. He is about to issue a work of some six
hundred pages, "The Innocents Abroad, or the New Pilgrim's Progress."  We long to see it, and
predict for it an extensive sale.

</p>
<hr>
<p>At Chicago.

</p><p>"MARK TWAIN" ON THE SPHYNX [sic].--Among the gems of fine description in the
lecture of Mark Twain, Tuesday evening, that of the mysterious Sphynx thrilled his audience
with admiration.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Elmira, N.Y., Daily Gazette.

</p><p>MARK TWAIN'S NEW BOOK, "THE INNOCENTS ABROAD, OR THE NEW
PILGRIM'S PROGRESS."--Advance sheets of the new work have incidentally come under our
notice--and from them we are prepared to speak highly of Mr. Clemens' prospective book. It has
for its foundation a description of the sights and scenes of famous places abroad, while they are
treated in that peculiarly attractive vein of power and genuine humor, which has made him
widely famous, and placed him at the head of the witty writers of America. Mr. Clemens,
however, is something besides a literary humorist. There occurs in his writing a blending of
sentiment and thought as fine and striking as they are beautiful and sparkling--ideas as clear and
penetrating as his humor is fresh. From what we have seen of his new book we are led to believe
that it will do much towards advancing his reputation, and establish it on an enduring basis. That
it will be a success is already assured.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Mohawk Valley, N.Y, Register.

</p><p>By a private note from "Mark Twain," we learn that he is about to issue his new book,
"The New Pilgrim's Progress," and then transform himself into a pilgrim again and start for
California. The first part of the information we hail with the utmost satisfaction, but we regret
that he is soon to leave the Atlantic coast. However, as many people will kill themselves with
laughter over his book, he might be subject here to the annoyance of frequent arrests for being
accessory before the fact to numerous cases of manslaughter. In California he would be safe
among his earlier friends, who know him better, and would let him off more easily.

MARK TWAIN'S NEW BOOK. What would the great old romantic voyagers and travellers, the
heroes of Hackluyt and Purchas, say of the monster Yankee picnic to Europe and the Holy Land?
I
think that if those worthies were to get hold of a copy of Mark Twain's account of the excursion,
there would be laughter in Elysium. At any rate, I can hardly believe it possible for an earthly
reader
 --  unless, indeed, like Charles Lamb's Scotchman, he is joke-proof  -- to peruse Twain's
new book, <i>The Innocents Abroad, </i>without "laughing consumedly." The work, however,
though rich in joke and jest is not, like Gilbert a Becket's dreary comic histories, a merely funny
book. On the contrary, it is a very full and matter-of-fact record of travel in Europe and the East,
delightfully flavored with humor and plentifully spiced with wit. Addison's sober citizen
complained
that there were too many plums and no suet in his pudding, but no one can say that Twain's
literary
pudding is wanting in suet or too full of plums.
</p><p>
Our author is not one of the "one-eyed travellers," mentioned by Whateley, who see "a great deal
of some particular class of objects, and are blind to all others," but a shrewd, quick-witted person,
who travelled with his eyes very wide open, and saw things as they were, not as they have been
described by poets and romancers. It is not, however, so much for its new, truthful and pleasant
pictures of Old World places and people, as for the delicious wit and humor scattered so freely
up
and down the book, that one praises and prizes <i>The Innocents Abroad. </i>And it is such
good
humor, too, most of it, and with all its freedom and riot, touching gently and lovingly all serious
things. I have been reading Fuller's <i>Pisgah Sight of Palestine,</i> and derived no little
amusement by comparing his descriptions of the Holy Land with Mark Twain's. Fuller, though as
pious and reverent as a saint, was a rare wit and humorist, and his book on Palestine is brimming
over with merry quibbles and jocular humor. Although some of Mark Twain's levities might have
displeased the witty old divine, I think that he would have laughed loud and long at the passage
concerning the tomb of Adam.
</p><p>
<i>The Innocents Abroad</i> is issued by the American Publishing Company of Hartford, and
is sold only by subscription. The Boston agents are George M. Smith & Co., No. 6 Tremont
Street.

<p>If any book of late years has so generally interested the press
of the country and received so extensive and favorable an
introduction to the public as has Mark Twain's <i>Innocents
Abroad, </i>since its appearance, we fail to remember the
instance. We gave to our readers last week, in a supplementary
sheet, some specimens of the notices we have found in our
exchanges. Numerous as were the excerpts here collected, they
represent but a fraction of what have fallen under our
observation, and the notable fact is, that, instead of the mere
mention so commonly accorded to a new book, almost every
journal has given it an unusually elaborate review, written not in
a simple spirit of courtesy, but evidentally with an inspiration of
interest excited by reading the work. The truth is, we believe,
that no one of an ordinary disposition of mind can dip into the
volume without being snared by a curious fascination. It is so
different from any narrative of travel that ever was written
before. The mere tickle of an ever pervading humor is not all
that makes it delightful, but that humor is like an atmosphere, in
which the old world scenes that so many tourists and travellers
have led us into, take on a new and altogether novel appearance,
so that we follow our droll excursionist from place to place as
eagerly as though we had never been carried to them by any
narrative before. It would be a great mistake to suppose that the
book is just a big package of Mark Twain's jokes, to be read with
laughter, and for the sake of laughter. It is the panorama of
Europe and the Holy Land as they were seen by one who went
abroad with no illusions; who carried about with him a shrewd
pair of American eyes, and used them to get his own impressions
of things, as they actually presented themselves, not as he had
been taught to expect them; who bore with him, moreover, as
acute an appreciation of sham and humbug as his sense of the
humorous and ludicrous was keen. What he saw he tells, and we
believe there is more true description in his book than in any
other of the kind that we have read. What is to be told soberly he
tells soberly, and with all the admiration or reverence that is due
to the subject. But he does like to wash off false colors, to scrape
away putty and varnish, to stick a pin into venerable moss grown
shams  --  and it is a perpetual delight to his reader to see
him do it in his droll, dry way. We have yet to find the person
who could open the book and willingly lay it down again, for,
certainly, it is not often that more or livelier entertainment can
be had in the same compass. The work has been published by
the American Publishing Company, at Hartford, and is sold by
agents who canvass for subscriptions.

<h2>AN ENTERTAINING ARTICLE</h2>

<p>I take the following paragraph from an article in the Boston
"Advertiser":

</p><p>AN ENGLISH CRITIC ON MARK TWAIN.--
</p><p>Perhaps the most successful flights of the humor of
Mark Twain have been descriptions of the persons who did not
appreciate his humor at all.  We have become familiar with the
Californians who were thrilled with terror by his burlesque of
a newspaper reporter's way of telling a story, and we have heard
of the Pennsylvania clergyman who sadly returned his
"Innocents Abroad" to the book-agent with the remark that "the
man who could shed tears over the tomb of Adam must be an
idiot."  But Mark Twain may now add a much more glorious
instance to his string of trophies.  The "Saturday Review," in its
number of October 8, reviews his book of travels, which has
been republished in England, and reviews it seriously.  We can
imagine the delight of the humorist in reading this tribute to his
power; and indeed it is so amusing in itself that he can hardly
do better than reproduce the article in full in his next monthly
Memoranda.
</p><p>(Publishing the above paragraph thus gives me a sort
of authority for reproducing the "Saturday Review's" article in
full in these pages.  I dearly wanted to do it, for I cannot write
anything half so delicious myself.  If I had a cast-iron dog that
could read this English criticism and preserve his austerity, I
would drive him off the doorstep.--EDITOR MEMORANDA.)

</p><p>
REVIEWS OF NEW BOOKS.
</p><p>
THE INNOCENTS ABROAD.  A Book of Travels.  By<lb>
Mark Twain.  London: Hotten, publisher.  1870.
</p><p>
Lord Macaulay died too soon.  We never felt this so deeply as
when we finished the last chapter of the above-named
extravagant work.  Macaulay died too soon--for none but he
could mete out complete and comprehensive justice to the
insolence, the impertinence, the presumption, the mendacity,
and, above all, the majestic ignorance of this author.
</p><p>To say that the "Innocents Abroad" is a curious book,
would be to use the faintest language--would be to speak of the
Matterhorn as a neat elevation, or of Niagara as being "nice" or
"pretty."  "Curious" is too tame a word wherewith the describe
the imposing insanity of this work.  There is no word that is
large enough or long enough.  Let us, therefore, photograph a
passing glimpse of book and author, and trust the rest to the
reader.  Let the cultivated English student of human nature
picture to himself this Mark Twain as a person capable of doing
the following-described things--and not only doing them, but
with incredible innocence <i>printing them</i> calmly and
tranquilly in a book.  For instance:
</p><p>He states that he entered a hair-dresser's in Paris to get
shaved, and the first "rake" the barber gave with his razor it
<i>loosened his "hide" and lifted him out of his chair</i>.
</p><p>This is unquestionably exaggerated.  In Florence he
was so annoyed by beggars that he pretends to have seized and
eaten one in a frantic spirit of revenge.  There is of course no
truth in this.  He gives at full length a theatrical programme
seventeen or eighteen hundred years old, which he professes to
have found in the ruins of the Coliseum, among the dirt and
mould and rubbish.  It is a sufficient comment upon this
statement to remark that even a cast iron programme would not
have lasted so long under such circumstances.  In Greece he
plainly betrays both fright and flight upon one occasion, but
with frozen effrontery puts the latter in this falsely tame form:
"We <i>sidled</i> toward the Piraeus."  "Sidled," indeed!  He
does not hesitate to intimate that at Ephesus, when his mule
strayed from the proper course, he got down, took him under
his arm, carried him to the road again, pointed him right,
remounted, and went to sleep contentedly till it was time to
restore the beast to the path once more.  He states that a
growing youth among his ship's passengers was in the constant
habit of appeasing his hunger with soap and oakum between
meals.  In Palestine he tells of ants that came eleven miles to
spend the summer in the desert and brought their provisions
with them; yet he shows by his description of the country that
the feat was an impossibility.  He mentions, as if it were the
most commonplace of matters, that he cut a Moslem in two in
broad daylight in Jerusalem, with Godfrey de Bouillon's sword,
and would have shed more blood <i>if he had had a graveyard
of his own</i>.  These statements are unworthy a moment's
attention.  Mr. Twain or any other foreigner who did such a
thing in Jerusalem would be mobbed, and would infallibly lose
his life.  But why go on?  Why repeat more of his audacious
and exasperating falsehoods?  Let us close fittingly with this
one: he affirms that "in the mosque of St. Sophia at
Constantinople I got my feet so stuck up with a complication of
gums, slime, and general impurity, that <i>I wore out more
than two thousand pair of bootjacks</i> getting my books off
that night, and even then some Christian hide peeled off with
them."  It is monstrous.  Such statements are simply
<i>lies</i>--there is no other name for them.  Will the reader
longer marvel at the brutal ignorance that pervades the
American nation when we tell him that we are informed upon
perfectly good authority that this extravagant compilation of
falsehoods, this exhaustless mine of stupendous lies, this
"Innocents Abroad," has actually been adopted by the schools
and colleges of several of the States as a text-book!
</p><p>But if his falsehoods are distressing, his innocence and
his ignorance are enough to make one burn the book and
despise the author.  In one place he was so appalled at the
sudden spectacle of a murdered man, unveiled by the
moonlight, that he jumped out of window, going through sash
and all, and then remarks with the most childlike simplicity that
he "was not scared, but was considerably agitated."  It puts us
out of patience to note that the simpleton is densely
unconscious that Lucrezia Borgia ever existed off the stage.  He
is vulgarly ignorant of all foreign languages, but is frank
enough to criticize the Italians' use of their own tongue.  He
says they spell the name of their great painter "Vinci, but
pronounce it Vinchy"--and then adds with a naivete possible
only to helpless ignorance, "<i>foreigners always spell better
than they pronounce</i>."  In another place he commits the
bald absurdity of putting the phrase "tare an ouns" into an
Italian's mouth.  In Rome he unhesitatingly believes the legend
that St. Philip Neri's heart was so inflamed with divine love that
it burst his ribs--believes it wholly because an author with a
learned list of university degrees strung after his name endorses
it--"otherwise," says this gentle idiot, "I should have felt a
curiosity to know what Philip had for dinner."  Our author
makes a long, fatiguing journey to the Grotto del Cane on
purpose to test its poisoning powers on a dog--got elaborately
ready for the experiment, and then discovered that he had no
dog.  A wiser person would have kept such a thing discreetly to
himself, but with this harmless creature everything comes out.
He hurts his foot in a rut two thousand years old in exhumed
Pompeii, and presently, when staring at one of the cinder-like
corpses unearthed in the next square, conceives the idea that
may be it is the remains of the ancient Street Commissioner,
and straightway his horror softens down to a sort of chirpy
contentment with the condition of things.  In Damascus he
visits the well of Ananias, three thousand years old, and is as
surprised and delighted as a child to find that the water is "as
pure and fresh as if the well had been dug yesterday."  In the
Holy Land he gags desperately at the hard Arabic and Hebrew
Biblical names, and finally concludes to call them
Baldwinsville, Williamsburgh, and so on, "<i>for convenience
of spelling!</i>"
</p><p>We have spoken thus freely of this man's stupefying
simplicity and innocence, but we cannot deal similarly with his
colossal ignorance.  We do not know where to begin.  And if
we knew where to begin, we certainly would not know where
to leave off.  We will give one more specimen, and one only.
He did not know, until he got to Rome, that Michael Angelo
was dead!  And then, instead of crawling away and hiding his
shameful ignorance somewhere, he proceeds to express a pious,
grateful sort of satisfaction that he is gone and out of his
troubles!
</p><p>No, the reader may seek out the author's exhibitions of
his uncultivation for himself.  The book is absolutely
dangerous, considering the multitude and variety of its
misstatements, and the convincing confidence with which they
are made.  And yet it is a text-book in the schools of America.
</p><p>The poor blunderer mouses among the sublime
creations of the Old Masters, trying to acquire the elegant
proficiency in art-knowledge, which he has a groping sort of
comprehension is a proper thing for the travelled man to be
able to display.  But what is the manner of his study?  And
what is the progress he achieves?  To what extent does he
familiarize himself with the great pictures of Italy, and what
degree of appreciation does he arrive at?  Read:
<blockquote>
When we see a monk going about with a lion and looking up
into heaven, we know that that is St. Mark.  When we see a
monk with a book and a pen, looking tranquilly up to heaven,
trying to think of a word, we know that that is St. Matthew.
When we see a monk sitting on a rock, looking tranquilly up to
heaven, with a human skull beside him, and without other
baggage, we know that that is St. Jerome.  Because we know
that he is always flying light in the matter of baggage.  When
we see other monks looking tranquilly up to heaven, but having
no trade-mark, we always ask who those parties are.  We do
this because we humbly wish to learn.
</blockquote>
</p><p>He then enumerates the thousands and thousands of
copies of these several pictures which he has seen, and adds
with accustomed simplicity that he feels encouraged to believe
that when he has seen "SOME MORE" of each, and had a larger
experience, he will eventually "begin to take an absorbing
interest in them"--the vulgar boor.
</p><p>That we have shown this to be a remarkable book, we
think no one will deny.  That it is a pernicious book to place in
the hands of the confiding and uninformed, we think we have
also shown.  That the book is a deliberate and wicked creation
of a diseased mind, is apparent upon every page.  Having
placed our judgment thus upon record, let us close with what
charity we can, by remarking that even in this volume there is
some good to be found; for whenever the author talks of his
own country and lets Europe alone, he never fails to make
himself interesting; and not only interesting, but instructive.
No one can read without benefit his occasional chapters and
paragraphs, about life in the gold and silver mines of California
and Nevada; about the Indians of the plains and deserts of the
West, and their cannibalism; about the raising of vegetables in
kegs of gunpowder by the aid of two or three teaspoonfuls of
guano; about the moving of small farms from place to place at
night in wheelbarrows to avoid taxes; and about a sort of cows
and mules in the Humboldt mines, that climb down chimneys
and disturb the people at night.  These matters are not only
new, but are well worth knowing.* It is a pity the author did not
put in more of the same kind.  His book is well-written and is
exceedingly entertaining, and so it just barely escaped being
quite valuable also.
</p>
<p>*Yes, I calculated they were pretty new.  I invented them myself.--MARK TWAIN.

Mr. Samuel L. Clemens, who is known to many of us, and
ought to be known to all of us, as Mark Twain, was one of the
passengers on the <i>Quaker City </i>when she took her
ill-assorted party of excursionists to Europe and the East, and
he has just given us, in a thick book of more than six hundred
pages, a record of the tour. It might better have been a thinner
book, for there is some dead wood in it, as there has to be in all
books which are sold by book-agents and are not to be bought
in  stores. The rural-district reader likes to see that he has got
his money's worth even more than he likes wood-engravings.
At least, such is the faith in Hartford; and no man ever saw a
book-agent with a small volume in his hand.
</p><p>
But if some of the book is needless, none of it is really poor,
and much of it very good. Mr. Clemens's plan of delivering an
unvarnished tale, of giving just his own impressions of what he
saw, at once made his work sure of some real value as well as
much freshness, and his book is one to be commended merely
as a book of travels. But, of course, the "American humor" is
the great thing. It is not in the light of  a traveller that one
regards a gentleman who when during his wanderings in the
Holy Land he comes upon the "tomb of Adam," which the
monks exhibit, thus gives utterance to a natural burst of
sentiment:

</p><p>
All the prominent characteristics of our peculiar school of
humorists  --  their audacity, their extravagance and
exaggeration  --  Mr. Clemens displays in fulness in the
course of his ramblings, and he has some  merits which belong
to his individual self, and which make him a very agreeable
companion when he is at ease and natural  --  which is not
always; for as he pads so, we must make free to tell him, does
he sometimes grimace, and is professionally a humorist as he
was  professionally a book-maker. It will be a just punishment
for him to reflect that no doubt many a farmer will read all his
jokes  --  the good ones as well as these bad ones we are
speaking to him about  --  with profound gravity and
unshaking belief in them as so much serious log-book.
</p><p>
There is, besides those we have mentioned, another
characteristic of "American humor," which consists in a certain
sort of what may be called fatuousness. When the man in the
stage-coach, riding along with "the great moral showman"
without knowing him, kept on telling him, "some of Artemus
Ward's jokes," and at the end of each one of them punched his
companion in the side and said, "What a damned fool the
fellow is!" he was not the worst critic that Artemus ever had.
NearIy all his jokes have in them a display of mental
helplessness  --  not to say imbecility  --  a drifting
along of the mind from one topic to another, suggested but not
really connected, topic, and are largely dependent upon this for
their humorous effect. The same thing may be seen  --
though not nearly so unmixed nor so often  --  in the
efforts of Mr. Josh Billings. The humor in the Nasby Papers
consists rather in Mr. Locke's conception of the low,
"dough-face" Democrat than in anything strictly humorous that
is said or done by him after he is made, and the Cross-roads
pastor and postrmaster gives no exhibition of the trait
mentioned. But the author of <i>The Innocents Abroad
</i>has some of it  --  though something of what he has
is acquired and imitative, we should say  --  and may be
taken to be rather more nearly Artemus Ward's successor in this
line than either of the other humorists to whom we have
referred.  </p>

Six hundred and fifty pages of open and declared fun  --
very strongly accented with wood-cuts at that  --  might
go far toward frightening the fastidious reader. But the Hartford
publishers, we imagine, do not print for the fastidious reader,
nor do traveling book agents sell much to that rarely occurring
man, who prefers to find books rather than let them find
<i>him. So </i> that, unless he has already made "Mark
Twain's" acquaintance through the press, he will not probably
meet him until, belated in the rural districts, he takes from the
parlor table of a country farm-house an illustrated Bible,
Greeley's <i>American Conflict, </i>Mr. Parton's apocryphal
<i>Biographies, </i>successively and listlessly, and so comes
at last upon "Mark Twain's" <i>Innocents </i>like a joyous
revelation  --  an Indian spring in an alkaline literary
desert. For the book has that intrinsic worth of bigness and
durability which commends itself to the rural economist, who
likes to get a material return for his money. It is about the size
of <i>The Family Physician, </i>for which it will doubtless be
often mistaken  --  with great advantage to the patient.
The entire six hundred and fifty pages are devoted to an
account of the "steamship <i>Quaker City's</i> excursion to
Europe and the Holy Land," with a description of certain
famous localities of which a great many six hundred and fifty
pages have been, at various times, written by various tourists.
Yet there is hardly a line of Mr. Clemens' account that is not
readable; and none the less, ccrtainly, from the fact that he
pokes fun at other tourists, and that the reader becomes dimly
conscious that Mr. Clemens' fellow-passengers would have
probably estopped this gentle satirist from going with them
could they have forecast his book. The very title<i>  --
The Innocents Abroad  --  is </i>a suggestive hint of the
lawlessness and audacity in which the trip is treated. We shall
not stop to question the propriety of this feature: it is only just
to Mr. Clemens to say, that the best satirists have generally
found their quarry in thc circle in which they moved, and
among their best friends; but we contend that if he has, by this
act, choked off and prevented the enthusiastic chronicling of
the voyage by any of his fellow-passengers, who may have been
sentimentally inclined, he is entitled to the consideration of a
suffering world; and it shall stand in extenuation of some
mannerism that is only slang, some skepticism that lacks the
cultivation which only makes skepticism tolerable, and some
sentiment that is only rhetoric. And so, with an irreverence for
his fellow-pilgrims which was equaled only by his scorn for
what they admired, this hilarious image-breaker started upon
his mission. The situation was felicitous, the conditions perfect
for the indulgence of an humor that seems to have had very
little moral or esthetic limitation. The whole affair was a huge
practical joke, of which not the least amusing feature was the
fact that "Mark Twain" had embarked in it. Before the
<i>Quaker</i> <i>City</i> reached Fayal, the first
stopping-place, he had worked himself into a grotesque rage at
every thing and every body. In this mock assumption of a
righteous indignation, lies, we think, the real power of the
book, and the decided originality of Mr. Clemens' humor. It
enables him to say his most deliberately funny things with all
the haste and exaggeration of rage; it gives him an opportunity
to invent such epithets as "animated outrage," and
"spider-legged gorilla," and apply them, with no sense of
personal responsibility on the part of reader or writer. And the
rage is always ludicrously disproportionate to the cause. It is
"Mr. Boythorn," without his politeness, or his cheerful
intervals. For, when "Mark Twain" is not simulating
indignation, he is <i>really </i>sentimental. He shows it in
fine writing  --  in really admirable rhetoric, vigorous and
picturesque  --  but too apt, at times, to suggest the
lecturing attitude, or the reporter's flourish. Yet it is so much
better than what one had any right to expect, and is such an
agreeable relief to long passages of extravagant humor, that the
reader is very apt to overlook the real fact, that it is often quite
as extravagant.  Yet, with all his independence, "Mark Twain"
seems to have followed his guide and guidebooks with a
simple, unconscious fidelity. He was quite content to see only
that which every body else sees, even if he was not content to
see it with the same eyes. His record contains no new facts or
features of the countries visited. He has always his own
criticism, his own comments, his own protests, but always
concerning the same old facts. Either from lack of time or
desire, he never stepped out of the tread-mill round of "sights."
His remarks might have been penciled on the margins of
Murray. This is undoubtedly a good way to correct the
enthusiasm or misstatements of other tourists; but is, perhaps,
hardly the best method of getting at the truth for one's self. As
a conscientious, painstaking traveler, "Mark Twain," we fear,
is not to be commended. But that his book would have been as
amusing, if he had been, is a matter of doubt.  Most of the
criticism is just in spirit, although extravagant, and often too
positive in style. But it should be remembered that the style
itself is a professional exaggeration, and that the irascible
pilgrim, "Mark Twain," is a very eccentric creation of Mr.
Clemens'. We can, perhaps, no more fairly hold Mr. Clemens
responsible for "Mark Twain's" irreverence than we could have
held the late Mr. Charles F. Browne to account for "Artemus
Ward's" meanness and humbuggery. There may be a question
of taste in Mr. Clemens permitting such a man as "Mark
Twain" to go to the Holy Land at all; but we contend that such
a traveler would be more likely to report its external aspect
truthfully than a man of larger reverence. And are there not
Lamartines, Primes, and unnumbered sentimental and pious
pilgrims to offset these losel skeptics  --  or, as our author
would say, such "animated outrages"  --  as Ross Browne,
Swift, "Mark Twain," <i>et al</i>.
</p>
<p>To subject Mr. Clemens to any of those delicate tests by
which we are supposed to detect the true humorist, might not
be either fair or convincing. He has caught, with great
appreciation and skill, that ungathered humor and extravagance
which belong to pioneer communities  --  which have
been current in bar-rooms, on railways, and in stages  --
and which sometimes get crudely into literature, as "a fellow
out West says." A good deal of this is that picturesque Western
talk which we call "slang," in default of a better term for
inchoate epigram. His characters speak naturally, and in their
own tongue. If he has not it that balance of pathos which we
deem essential to complete humor, he has something very like
it in that serious eloquence to which we have before alluded.
Like all materialists, he is an honest hater of all cant  --
except, of course, the cant of materialism  --  which, it is
presumed, is perfectly right and proper. To conclude: after a
perusal of this volume, we see no reason for withholding the
opinion we entertained before taking it up, that Mr. Clemens
deserves to rank foremost among Western humorists; and, in
California, above his only rival, "John Phoenix," whose fun,
though more cultivated and spontaneous,  lacked the sincere
purpose and larger intent of "Mark Twain's."

<i>The Innocents Abroad; or, The New Pilgrim's Progress,</i> is the title of Mark Twain's latest
appearance between covers. The book is a ponderous one, containing over 650 pages, splendidly
illustrated, and produced in the best style of art by the American Publishing Company, of
Hartford.
No ordinary "notice" can do justice to this work. In the language of many others, "it must be seen
(and read) to be appreciated." It is a curious account of the famous Quaker City pleasure trip to
the
Mediterranean and the Holy Land, which was conceived by and executed under command of
Captain
Duncan, in the summer of 1867. There were many intelligent sight-seers among "the innocents";
but
few, we are inclined to believe, who got as much out of the trip as did the author of this book.
Mark
Twain is a born journalist, besides being at the present time first among American humorists. It
is,
indeed, doubtful if he has ever had an equal; he certainly has not had in his line  --  that of dry,
self-contained, unobtrusive and pervading fun. There is no glare in his emanations  --  no
blinding coruscations of wit, which, flashing suddenly upon you, as suddenly go out, leaving you
in
darkness and uncertainty; no apparent striving after sharp effects; no digging in poor soil for
poorer
puns. What is said is most naturally said, and if there is humor in it, it is because the writer could
not
express it otherwise. Whatever may be the quality of the wine which fills your glass, you never
feel
that it is being drawn from an empty cask, or that its flavor is at all dependent upon the
abundance
of its supply. When Mr. Beecher was reprimanded for saying so many funny things in the pulpit,
he
replied, "Oh, but if you only knew the number of funny things I do not say!" And this is the
impression left upon the reader of Mark Twain. Whatever good things he may choose to fasten
with
his pen, one cannot but feel that his best things are yet untold. There is one species of poor wit
that
Mark has not yet found it necessary to attempt, and we trust he never will, and that is poor
orthography and worse grammar. It is not to be denied that a telling point may sometimes be
made
by a violent assault upon the barriers of "good English." Artemus Ward achieved some glory in
this
field; and his literary successor, Josh Billings, sometimes unearths a nugget; but the game thus
far
has not been worth the candle, and we doubt if it ever will be. At all events, Mark Twain has no
such
weak necessity, and we are glad of it. Some portions of the book are devoted to correct,
unexaggerated descriptions of the country, and matters requiring historical accuracy; but there is
no
pretence, other than of a humorous and extravagant account of a memorable voyage. There will
be
those who will see in the descriptions of the Holy Land a conspicuous lack of reverence for
sacred
associations, and the contrast between this and ordinary guide-books will not need to be pointed
out;
but the artistic and effectual disposal of the romantic tales of tourists, which have enveloped
these
scenes with a mysterious beauty and awe not to be penetrated or approached, will be at least
satisfactory to the matter-of-fact reader.                                                                     </p>

Here is his quiet style of getting down from a high state of mental exhilaration to every-day
considerations:

Every traveller on the Continent has met the American tourist, and  formed some opinion of his
merits. We do not speak of that variety of  American who comes over to spend five or six years
in
Europe and finds himself rather more at home on the Parisian boulevards than on the New York
Broadway. Nor do we refer to the Americans who have been too highly cultivated to obtrude
their
national peculiarities upon us in any disagreeable form. There is no pleasanter acquaintance than
the
gentleman, or still more the lady, of this class who has just enough American flavour to be
amusingly
original. But, besides these types, the United States are kind enough to provide us with a vast
number
of travellers corresponding in refinement and intelligence to Mr. Cook's tourists. They are the
people
who do Europe in six weeks, and throw in the Holy Land and Egypt to fill up their spare time.
They
are gloriously ignorant of any language but their own, supremely contemptuous of every country
that
had no interest in thc Declaration of Independence,  and occasionally, it must be admitted, as
offensive as the worst kind of Cockney tourist, whilst even less inclined to hide their light under
a
bushel. Comparing them with the most nearly analogous class of British  travellers, it is rather
hard
to determine which should have the  preference. The American is generally the noisier and more
actively disagreeable, but, on the other hand, he often partly redeems his absurdity by a certain
naivete and half-conscious humour. He is often laughing in his sleeve at his own preposterous
brags,
and does not take himself quite so seriously as his British rival. He is vulgar, and even
ostentatiously
and atrociously vulgar; but the vulgarity is mixed with a real shrewdness which rescues it from
simple insipidity. We laugh at him, and we would rather not have too much of his company; but
we
do not feel altogether safe in despising him. We may save ourselves the trouble of any further
attempts at description by quoting a few illustrative passages from the book before us. Mr. Mark
Twain, as the author chooses to call himself, is a Californian humourist after the fashion of
Artemus
Ward. He came to Europe on a grand excursion trip, and describes his impressions of France and
Italy in the true tourist style. He parades his utter ignorance of Continental languages and
manners,
and expresses his very original judgments on various wonders of art and nature with a
praiseworthy
frankness. We are sometimes left in doubt whether he is speaking in all sincerity, or whether he
is
having a sly laugh at himself and his readers. To do him justice, however, we must observe that
he
has a strong tinge of the peculiar national humour; and, though not equal to the best performers
on
the same instrument, manages to be an amusing representative of his class. The dry joke, which
apes
seriousness, is a favourite device of his countrymen; and Mr. Mark Twain is of course not as
simple
as he affects to be. We merely say this to guard ourselves against the imputation of taking a
professional jester seriously; but, whether he speaks in downright earnest or with a
half-concealed
twinkle of the eye, his remarks will serve equally well as an illustration of the genuine
unmistakable
convictions of many of his countrymen.
</p><p>
Without further preface we will quote some of Mr. Twain's remarks upon foreign countries. And,
first of all, he exhibits that charming ignorance of all languages but English which is so common
amongst his fellows. French newspapers, he tells us, "have a strange fashion of telling a perfectly
straight story till you get to the  nub' of it, and then a word drops in that no man can translate, and
that story is ruined." He is seriously aggrieved by the names of places, and says that the nearest
approach which anybody can make to the true pronunciation of Dijon is "demijohn." The spelling
is not much assistance under such circumstances. Speaking of a certain distinguished artist, he
observes, "they spell it Vinci, and pronounce it Vinchy; foreigners always spell better than they
pronounce." Gentlemen who labour under this difficulty of communicating with the natives
naturally
fall into the hands of guides, and Mr. Twain and his friends appear to have suffered terribly from
the
persons whom they hired to take them to the sights of foreign towns. Their system on arriving at
any
large place was to engage a <i>valet de place, </i>whom they always called "Ferguson," to save
the
trouble of pronouncing a new name, and were carried about as helpless victims to such places as
he
preferred, besides having to swallow his stories. They took a characteristic revenge, which
appears
to have afforded them immense satisfaction. The way to bully your guide is to affect a profound
ignorance  --  if you have not got it naturally  --  and a stony indifference to his
information. They therefore told off a gentleman called the Doctor, to ask questions of the said
guide,
because he could "look more like an inspired idiot, and throw more imbecility into the tone of his
voice, than any man that lives. It comes natural to him." Thus, for example, it was assumed that
as
Americans they would take a special interest in an autograph letter of Columbus. The Doctor,
after
asking some irrelevant questions, pronounced it the worst specimen of handwriting he ever saw,
and
added, "If you have got any specimens of penmanship of real merit, trot them out; and, if you
haven't,
drive on." The guide, we are told, was "considerably shaken up." On the same principle, when
shown
an Egyptian monument, the Doctor asked indignantly, "What is the use of imposing your vile
secondhand carcases on us? If you've got a nice fresh corpse, fetch him out! or, by George, we'll
brain you." The most irritating question you can put to such a guide is to ask concerning any
distinguished character to whom he refers  --  such, for example, as Columbus or Michael
Angelo  --  "Is he dead?" And this seems to have met with such success that Mr. Twain scarcely
restrained his companions from putting the inquiry to a monk in a Capuchin convent, who
showed
them some of the personal remains of his predecessors.
</p><p>We may imagine the temper in which some of the remarkable sights of the Old World
would be
contemplated under such circumstances. Mr. Twain, indeed, was much impressed by the
cathedral
at Milan. The bill for mere workmanship, he says, "foots up six hundred and eighty-four millions
of
francs, thus far (considerably over a hundred millions of dollars), and it is estimated that it will
take
a hundred and twenty years yet to finish the cathedral." When he gets to St. Peter's, however, he
declares that it did not look nearly so large as the capitol at Washington, and certainly not a
twentieth
part as beautiful from the outside. Even natural wonders are generally surpassed by their rivals in
the
United States. The Lake of Como, for example, is pronounced to be very inferior to Lake Tahoe.
In
clearness it is not to be compared to it. "I speak," he says, "of the north shore of Lake Tahoe,
where
we can count the scales on a trout at a depth of 180 feet."  Mr. Twain, however, feels constrained
to
add, "I have tried to get this statement off at par here, but with no success; so I have been obliged
to negotiate it at fifty per cent. discount." Tahoe, we may explain in passing, for the benefit of
philological readers, is Indian for grasshopper soup  --  so, at least, Mr. Twain believes. The
objects, however, against which Mr. Twain feels a special indignation, to which he tells us he is
bound to give vent in spite of the remonstrances of his friends, are pictures by the old masters.
The
old masters irritate him incessantly; and the apparent reason of his objection is characteristic.
"Wherever you  find a Raphael, a Rubens, a Michael Angelo, &c.," he says, "you find  artists
copying
them, and the copies are always the handsomest. Maybe the originals were handsome when they
were new, but they are not now."  He "harbours no animosity" against the deluded persons who
think
otherwise; but he regards them as about as wise as men who should stand opposite a desert of
charred stumps and say, What a noble forest!   Michael Angelo appears to have been a special
annoyance to him. "I never felt so fervently thankful," he exclaims, "so soothed, so tranquil, so
filled
with a blessed peace, as I did yesterday, when I leamt that Michael Angelo was dead." One would
rather like to know how many of Mr. Cook's tourists share this feeling in their hearts, if they only
dared to avow their ignorance with an equally touching frankness. Mr. Twain took his revenge by
asking the wretched "Ferguson" of the moment, whenever he came to a "statoo brunzo" (Italian
for
a bronze statue), or an Egyptian obelisk, or the Forum or any other work of art, ancient or
modern,
whether it too was by Michael Angelo; thus at any rate making  somebody else share in his
tortures.
In presence of the ancients he  generally indulges in facetiousness of a rather low order. He goes,
for
example, to some amphitheatre and tries to realize the scene which it once presented. His most
vivid
picture is that of a Roman youth, who took "some other fellow's young lady" to a gladiatorial
show
and amused her and himself during the acts by "approaching the cage and stirring up the martyrs
with
his whalebone cane." But, to say the truth, Mr. Twain here verges upon buffoonery. Once or
twice
he is driven to what is happily described in the heading of the page as "general execration." Here,
for example, is a burst of patriotic eloquence. "O, sons of classic Italy, is the spirit of enterprise,
of
self-reliance, of noble endeavour utterly dead within ye? Curse your indolent worthlessness, why
don't you rob your Church?" And he is very great on occasion in explaining the many advantages
of
a free and independent Republic as compared with a land groaning under priestly dominion and
grovelling superstition. That notion of robbing the Church occurs to him very forcibly at
intervals,
and he seems to think that, so far as the plan has been carried out, it is the best chance for Italy.
</p><p>
Perhaps we have persuaded our readers by this time that Mr. Twain is a very offensive specimen
of the vulgarest kind of Yankee. And yet, to say the truth, we have a kind of liking for him. There
is a frankness and originality about his remarks which is pleasanter than the mere repetition of
stale
raptures; and his fun, if not very refined, is often tolerable in its way. In short, his pages may be
turned over with amusement, as exhibiting more or less consciously a very lively portrait of the
uncultivated American tourist, who may be more obtrusive and misjudging, but is not quite so
stupidly unobservant as our native product. We should not choose either of them for our
companions
on a visit to a church or a picture-gallery, but we should expect most amusement from the
Yankee
as long as we could stand him.
