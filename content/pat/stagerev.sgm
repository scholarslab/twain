[<i>The following excerpts from newspaper reviews of MT's first lecture tour, through California
and the Nevada Territory in 1866, are taken from Frear's</i> Mark Twain and Hawaii<i>,
Appendix D3, "Contemporary Newspaper Comments on the Lectures."</i>]
</p>

<p>
The Academy of Music was stuffed . . . to repletion. . . . It is perhaps fortunate that the King of
Hawaii did not arrive in time to attend, for unless he had gone early he would have been turned
away, as many others were who could not gain admittance.

<p>
The appearance of the lecturer was the signal for applause and from the time he commenced until
he closed, the greatest good feeling existed.  He commenced by apologizing for the absence of an
orchestra, he wasn't used to getting up operas of this sort.  He had engaged a musician to come
and play the trombone, but, after the bargain was closed, the trombone player insisted upon
having some other musicians to help him.  He had hired the man to work, and wouldn't stand any
such nonsense, and so discharged him on the spot.  The lecturer then proceeded with his subject,
and delivered one of the most interesting and amusing lectures ever delivered in this city.  It was
replete with information of that character which is seldom got from books, describing all those
minor traits of character, custom and habits which are only noted by a close observer, and yet the
kind of information which gives the most correct idea of the people described.  Their virtues were
set forth generously, while their vices were touched off in a humourous style, which kept the
audience in a constant state of merriment.  From the lecturer's reputation as a humorist, the
audience were unprepared for the eloquent description of the volcano of Kilauea, a really
magnificent piece of word-painting, their appreciation of which was shown by long and continued
applause.  Important facts concerning the resources of the Islands were given, interspersed with
pointed anecdotes and side-splitting jokes.  Their history, traditions, religions, politics,
aristocracy, royalty, manners and customs were all described in brief and in the humorous vein
peculiar to the speaker. . . . The lecturer held his audience constantly interested and amused for an
hour and a half, and the lecture was unanimously pronounced a brilliant success.  After its close,
and the audience had risen to leave he was called out again, and in his funny style apologized for
the "infliction," giving as an excuse that he was about writing a book on the Sandwich Islands,
and needed funds for its publication.<p>

The lecture was superior to Artemus Ward's "Babes in the Woods" in point of humor.  It evinced
none of that straining after effect that was manifested by the great showman, and possessed some
solid qualities to which Ward can make no pretensions.  As a humorous writer Mark Twain stands
in the foremost rank, while his effort of last evening affords reason for the belief that he can
establish an equal reputation as a humorous and original lecturer.<p><br>

<font size=+1>San Francisco <i>Alta California</i>, 3 October 1866:</font><p>

At times he would soar to the sublime and his description of the volcano of Kilauea was as
graphic and magnificent a piece of word painting as we have listened to for many a day.  As an
entirety, the lecture was preeminently humorous.  There was, however, much information
conveyed in this effort which never appeared in any history of the Hawaiian Islands. . . . Mark
Twain has thoroughly established himself as the most piquant and humorous writer and lecturer
on this coast since the days of the lamented "John Phoenix."<p><br>

<font size=+1>San Francisco <i>News Letter</i>, 6 October 1866:</font><p>

A rousing audience last Tuesday greeted St. Mark, the missionary, on the occasion of his first
appearance on the lyceum stage--we were on the point of saying "on any stage," but having once
travelled with him inside of Billy Wilson's from Virginia to Carson, candor compels us to sacrifice
effect to accuracy.  The Academy was packed from pit to dome, standing room crowded, while a
number were unable to obtain admission.  The audience embraced "our best people."<p>

We had hoped to secure the lecturer's sermon to prepare our little notice of the occasion, but even
his fine sense of humor is surpassed by his acute moral perception, and he declined on the score of
unbecomingness to the missionary character--it would savor of the vanity of the flesh!  Perhaps
nothing in his career gives so vivid an impression of his uncompromising devotion to the principle
as the refusal of our munificent proposition for a sonorous blast upon his own trumpet.  Justice to
ourselves compels us to mention our princely offer, that he should name his own terms.  In justice
to him we give his noble reply, "I believe it would be wrong, untold gold shall not tempt me."
This grand utterance will be handed down to generations yet unborn, stimulating them to virtue,
nerving them to resist the seduction of vice.  The future school-boy shall learn to associate
together these two sublime sentiments--one by the youthful Washington, "Father I cannot tell a
lite!" the other by St. Mark, the missionary, "I believe it is wrong; gold cannot tempt me! . . . Pax
tuiscum, sancto Marcus, missionarius."<p>

We regret to notice one serious fault--it was too short.  It was exceedingly good what there was
of it.  In fact it could not well have been better, but its delivery occupied only an hour and fifteen
minuters, while it appeared to the audience fifteen minutes without the hour. . . . If the missionary
would appropriate half a column of any one of the recent <i>Alta</i>'s editorials upon the
Hawaiian question, and judiciously interpolate it about the middle of his lecture it would rest the
attention of the audience, and, while really not occupying five minutes in delivery, would
effectively remove the impression of brevity.  But really the lecture was "tip top," . . . interesting,
instructive, . . . delivery happy, success complete.<p><br>

<font size=+1>San Francisco <i>Golden Era</i>, 7 October 1866:</font><p>

<font size=-1>MARK TWAIN</font>--We regard this subject with mingled admiration and awe,
and approach him with hesitation.  Nature must have been in one of her funniest moods when she
fashioned this mixture of the sublime and the ridiculous.  The house was crowded when the
festive juvenile sauntered bashfully, hand in pocket and mouth too full for utterance, to the
position which he will grace till time interposes his restraining protest across the path of the
successful humorist.  Never did aspirant for public favor take more rapid stride than did the future
historian of the Sandwich Islands on that momentous evening.  Quote Artemus Ward no more;
our Pacific slopes can discount him.  True, he displayed not the polish of the finished lecturer--nor
did he need it; the crude, quaint delivery was infinitely preferable.  In original humor and the way
of putting it, Artemus can hide his diminished Luminary under several bushels; he is as a penn'orth
of tallow to a mammoth circus chandelier.  It was a clever interruption of Twain's--that of
apology.  He wished to write a history of Kanakadom and needed the wherewithal.  He did not
state, however, the number of volumes required.  Several, we hope, and a lecture to a
volume.<p>

<br><br><br>

<font size=+1><a name="b">Sacramento</a> <i>Daily Union</i>, 12 October 1866:<p></font>

The lecturer entertained the audience for about an hour, discoursing in an easy colloquial style, . .
. seasoning a large dish of information with spicy anecdotes, depicting the lights and shades of
Kanaka society with a freedom, vividness and humor quite delightful, rendering a just tribute to
the laborious missionaries, . . . and sketching the magnificent scenery of the volcanic mountains
with peculiar force.<p><br>


<font size=+1>Sacramento <i>Bee</i>, 12 October 1866:</font><p>

Mark--His Mission--Mark--not the apostle, but other of the twain, the missionary--made his
advent . . . last evening. . . . Mark has been on a mission to the Sandwich Islands, and returning
has rendered an account of his stewardship. . . . Mark was in good trim.  Instead of having been
made a meal of by the cannibals, . . . he came back to us in the flesh. . . . It was pleasant to listen
to a lecturer who felt so well and talked so wisely, mixing (so to speak) as with a blender the
pathetic with the humorous.  There was more, however, of the humorous than the pathetic, and
the transitions were so sudden that before a tear had time to gather head enough to fall, the
laughing came in.  Occasionally it was just the other way--the tears came from the overflow of
laughter.<p>


<br><br><br>

<font size=+1><a name="c">Virginia City</a> <i>Daily Territorial Enterprise</i>,</font><br>
30 October 1866 [the day before the lecture]:<p>

The enthusiasm with which his lecture was everywhere greeted is still ringing throughout
California, and now that his foot is in his native heath we expect to see the very mountains shake
with a tempest of approval.<p>

1 November 1866 [the day after the lecture]:<p>

An immense success.  One of the largest and most fashionable audiences that ever graced the
Opera House, . . . all of the available seats and standing room were occupied.  It was a
magnificent tribute to the lecturer from his old friends. . . . Combining the most valuable and
statistical and general information with passages of drollest humor--all delivered in the peculiar
and inimitable style of the author--and rising occasionally to lofty flights of descriptive
eloquence--the lecture constitutes an entertainment of rare excellence and interest.<p>

<br><br><br>

<font size=+1><a name="d">San Jose</a> <i>Mercury</i>, 26 November 1866:</font><p>

We have been an admirer of the inimitable humor of the lecturer, as shown in his numerous letters
and sketches, that have been so widely published, but confess that the lecture disappointed us.
The expected to hear the Kanakas "Joked blind," but had no idea of being treated to such an
intellectual feast as he served up to his audience.  We never heard or read anything half so
beautiful as his description when he laid aside the role of the humorist and gave rein to his fancy.
To use the expression of a rapt listener to the lecture, "He's lightenin'."<p>
<br><br><br>

<font size=+1><a name="e"><i>Petaluma</a> Journal and Argus</i>, 29 November
1866:</font><p>

[<i>According to Frear, the real basis for this critique was that no advertising was bought from
the paper and no complimentary tickets sent to its editor.  Frear sets it off in Appendix D4 as the
most negative review MT received on his first lecture tour.</i>]<p>

Reprehensible--The gentleman who enjoys a wide celebrity on this coast as a spicy writer, over
the "<i>nom de plume</i>" of "Mark Twain" delivered his lecture on the "Sandwich Islands," in
this city on Monday evening last.  While we accord to him the merit of being a spicy writer,
candor compels us to say that as a lecturer he is not a success.  We say this with no desire to be
captious, but simply because it is literally true.  As a newspaper correspondent Mark Twain is a
racy and humorous writer, but as a lecturer he falls below mediocrity.  In this connection we think
it is not inapproriate to address ourself to the editorial fraternity on this Coast, and to our San
Francisco contemporaries in particular, in relation to the reprehensible practice of disguising the
truth in reference to the qualifications and ability of persons who sell their talents for a valuable
consideration, and too frequently "sell" those who go to hear them, innocently expecting to be
instructed or amused.<p>

<br><br><br>

<font size=+1><a name="f">San Francisco</a> <i>Times</i>, 11 December 1866:</font><p>

The genial lecturer entertained his audience with a mingling of fact, fun, and fancy, which was as
delightful as it was instructive.  Probably never before was so much actual information imparted in
such an agreeable manner as in Mark's lecture, which might be called the sugar-coated pill of
traveler's lore.  This popular lecturer has struck a new lead in the vast field of literary research,
and his multitudinous friends will all hope that his "prospects" will "pan out" rich.<p><br>

<font size=+1>San Francisco<i>Alta California</i>, 11 December 1866:</font><p>

A highly intelligent and appreciative audience . . . assembled last night . . . to hear the last public
lecture of Mark Twain, prior to his departure for "missionary labor" in other climes.  The subject
of the lecture and the droll humor of the lecturer have been so frequently commented on that
further mention on those heads is, at present, needless.  In every respect, whether in regard to the
subject matter of the lecture, manner of delivery, and amendment of some blemishes apparent on
the first occasion, the lecture was a decided success.<p>

THE</font> S<font size=-1>ANDWICH</font> I<font size=-1>SLANDS</font>. -- In
accordance with his humorous advertisement, Mark Twain delivered his wonderful lecture, on the
Sandwich Islands, at the Mercantile Library Hall last night.  The audience was large and
appreciative, and financially and every other way the entertainment proved a complete success.  In
fact, Mark Twain achieved a very decided success.  He succeeded in doing what we have seen
Emerson and other literary magnates fail in attempting.  He interested and amused a large and
promiscuous audience.</p>

<p>Mark has the gift of a bright and happy fancy, and expresses his thoughts with no ordinary
force and gracefulness of language.  His descriptive powers are good, and his descriptive powers
very fair for a young lecturer.</p>

<p>We shall attempt no synopsis of his entertainment.  Ostensibly it was on the Sandwich Islands,
but while it contained not a little valuable information and many passages of felicitious
description, it also embraced many other topics geographically and otherwise foreign to the
matter in hand, and had many a piquant piece of humor interwoven, which, with the bright flash of
genuine wit, startled with laughter and kept alive the attention of the audience.  As to the
wonderful [feats?] promised in the advertisement they were forgotten in the intellectual
amusement afforded; and in the minor matter of swallowing a child Mark failed to come to time,
possibly because no lady volunteered an infant for the occasion.  We did not learn who was lucky
enough to win Lafayette Park.</p>

<p>Our readers are aware this lecture was delivered for the benefit of the South St. Louis
Mission Sunday School -- a most worthy object and certainly calling for the patronage of the
Christian community.</p>

<p>This evening the lecture will be repeated at the same place and for the same object.  Let all go
who wish to be instructed and amused, and at the same time assist a deserving cause.  "The
wisdom will begin to flow at eight o'clock, and not a drop should be lost."</p>

<center><b><font size=+1>MARK TWAIN</font><br>
<font size=-1>AT THE MERCANTILE LIBRARY HALL</font><br>
TUESDAY NIGHT.</b></center>
<br>
<p>A gentleman stepped on the stage and announced that wisdom would commence to flow
precisely at eight o'clock.  To while away the time till then, he said he "would treat them with a
whistling, which some called foolish," and a song, "The moon shines bright," both of which won
loud and prolonged applause.  Precisely at eight o'clock, at previously announced, the veritable
Mark Twain himself appeared, to the great delight of the audience.  As he informed the audience,
he had been residing in the Sandwich Islands.  Being one of the wandering Bohemians, he had
devoted his time to obtaining information to let the public know of the result of his travels.  After
his residence there, he was well-qualified to deliver an interesting, instructive and amusing lecture.
He certainly succeeded in making it all three.  His remarks were witty and humorous.  He kept his
audience in a roar of laughter and a perpetual chuckle.  His wit was not of the evanescent kind.
One was not obliged to be always on the qui vive to catch the brilliant flashes of wit that he dealt
with so much ease.  Neither was it of that kind which Douglas Jerrold defines dogmatism,
"puppyism come to maturity."</p>

<p>He was decidedly humorous also.  He did not cut the audience short.  His humor was
tangible, and the laugh raised at the first hearing of his remarks died not away with the conclusion
of the sentence.  One seemed to be chuckling incessantly, and with faces wreathed in smiles, the
audience listened for the next remarks, which increased the chuckles to a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>He commenced his lecture on the Sandwich Islands by stating: "That when at Julesberg,
which is about four hundred miles west of St. Louis, he heard a little anecdote of Horace Greeley,
going to lecture at Carson, from a man who said he was afraid that he would be too late to hear
him.  Further westward still, he heard the same anecdote, or a pleasing incident about the mail
service, in connection with Horace Greeley, and again he heard it in Nevada, or was about to hear
it, when he stopped the story teller, and inquired of him, if the anecdote was about Horace
Greeley, the mail service, the lecture and Carson City.  On being told it was, he declined hearing
it.  On coming east, he had seen that anecdote in almost every newspaper, but he had not heard it
in St. Louis, and therefore he thought he would tell it, as a pleasing incident about the mail
service, in connection with Horace Greeley going to lecture at Carson City.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I suppose you are all interested in the Sandwich Islands; of course you
must be, because it is the center of missionary labor. And you all know that hymn which so aptly
refers to it; (he repeats)<br>
<center>"From Greenland's icy mountains," &c.</center>
As no one was going to lead the singing, he would leave it where it was.</p>

<p>Sandwich Islands are situated about 2100 miles west of San Francisco.  I wonder why they
were placed in the middle of the ocean; as it is none of our business we won't talk any more about
it.  It is a splendid sugar country, better than the best of Louisiana land, can get from 5,000 to
13,000 pounds of sugar raised to the acre, but I own no acre there.</p>

<p>The islands are twelve in number, and have volcanoes, the largest dead volcanoes in the
world.  Eighty years ago, there was a population of 400,000 people.  The white men came,
brought civilization and several other diseases, and now the race is fast dying out, and will be
extinct in about fifty years hence.  They got consumptive when civilization got there, and they will
shortly retire from business.  When they pack up and leave, we will take possession as lawful
heirs.  There are 3000 whites there, mostly Americans, and they are still increasing.  They own all
the money, control all the commerce, and own all the ships.  They have a constitutional monarchy,
but they have no constitution, and the monarchy is only an empty name.  A Kanaka or native is
nobody unless he has a princely income of $75 annually, or a splendid estate worth $100.  The
country is full of office-holders and office-seekers; there are plenty of such noble patriots.  Of
almost any party of three men, two would be office-holders and one an office-seeker.  In a little
island, half the size of one of the wards of St. Louis, there are lots of noblemen, princes, and men
of high degree, with grand titles, holding big offices, receiving immense salaries--such as ministers
of war, secretaries of the navy, secretaries of state and ministers of justice.  They make a fine
display of uniforms, and are very imposing at a funeral.  That's the country for a petty hero to go
to, he would soon have the conceit taken out of him.  There are so many of them, that a noble
from any other country would be nobody.  They only lionize their own people, and therefore they
lionize everybody.  In education, refinement, and culture, the sons and daughters of our
missionaries there need not be ashamed to compare themselves with their brothers and sisters in
the United States.  And there has never been a stain upon any of their names.  The first thing a
stranger does, on arriving at the Islands, is to collect shinbones of dead Kanakas, fossils and coral,
but he never succeeds in carrying any of them away, because he soon gets tired of it--the novelty
wears off.  A stranger going there now need not be looking for curiosities, for in the back-yard of
every house he will see piles of shinbones of dead Kanakas, heaps of fossils and stacks of coral.
He will also, as a first experiment, pick up about a dozen Kanaka words; he won't talk English; he
won't say good morning, like a Christian; he will say all-ay-ho.  One man had been there three
weeks, and he came to breakfast with me.  I asked him how he would have his beefsteak--rare or
well-done.  He replied, "Muckee--muckee--guckee," &c.  Well, said I, you can muckee, muckee,
guckee yourself out of this.  I won't have anything to do with you.  We can have any climate we
want on the Sandwich Islands.  On the summits, which are 16,000 feet above the level of the
valley, whose tops are whitened by perpetual snow, we can have everlasting winter, and near the
sea shore everlasting summer.  A single glance of the eye takes in all the climates on the earth.  It
was so cold on the tops of the mountains that I could not speak the truth, but on level ground, I
can speak the truth as well--as any other man.</p>

<p>The climate is wonderfully healthy, for white people in particular, so healthy that white people
venture on the most reckless imprudence.  They get up too early; you can see them as early as half
past seven in the morning, and they attend to all their business, and keep it up till sundown.  It
don't hurt 'em, it don't kill 'em, and yet it ought to do so.  I have seen it so hot in California that
greenbacks went up 142 in the shade.</p>

<p>The volcano of Kee-law-ay-oh is 17,000 feet in diameter, and from 700 to 800 feet deep.
Vesuvius is nowhere.  It is the largest dead volcano in the world.  You witness a scene of
unrivaled sublimity, and witness the most astonishing sights.  When the volcano of Kee-law-ay-oh
broke through a few years ago, lava flowed out of it for twenty days and twenty nights, and made
a stream forty miles in length, till it reached the sea, tearing up forests in its awful fiery path,
swallowing up huts, destroying all vegetation, rioting through shady dells and sinuous canyons.
Amidst this carnival of destruction, majestic columns of smoke ascended, and formed a cloudy
murky pall overhead.  Sheets of green, blue, lambent flame were shot upwards and pierced this
vast gloom, making all sublimely grand. [After this burst of eloquence, he clapped his hands and
the audience joined, making the vaulted roof of the Library hall reverberate with the sounds of
enthusiastic applause.]</p>

<p>I once knew a great, tall gawky country editor, near Sacramento,to whom I sent an ode of the
sea, starting with "The long, green swell of the Pacific."  The country editor sent back a letter and
stated that I couldn't fool him, and he didn't want any base insinuations from me.  He knew who I
meant when I wrote "the long, green swell of the Pacific."</p>

<p>There is one thing characteristic of the tropics that a stranger must have, whether he likes it or
not, and that is the boo-hoo fever.  Its symptoms are nausea of the stomach, severe headache,
backache and bellyache, and a general utter indifference whether the school keeps or not.  You
can't be a full citizen of the Sandwich Island unless you have had the boo-hoo fever.  You will
never forget it.  I remember a little boy who had it once there.  A New Yorker asked him if he
was afraid to die.  He said, no; I am not afraid to die of anything, except the boo-hoo fever.  The
moral force used by the missionaries, in the Sandwich Islands, is not much.  But they are the right
kind of men there--they have just the grit, to hold on like grim death.  Bishop Staley of the
English Missionary church is not very popular.  The societies in London have ceased to support
him, and his mission has a dull, unhealthy look.  The King belongs to the church, but he never
goes there, and he still adheres to the pagan form of worship.  The king is a gentleman, but the
American missionaries made him so.  The bishop's church is making some progress, and there is
plenty of room for it; but they will never succeed in ousting the American missionaries. [After
another burst of eloquence about some perennial flower, he applauds himself; would repeat it
again if requested to by the audience; the audience requests him to proceed, but the lecturer
declines with such a comical gesture, that it sends the audience into convulsions.]</p>

<p>In Honolulu, merchants go to their business at nine <font size=-1>A.M.</font>, and cease
business at four <font size=-1>P.M.</font> They will have nothing to do with business till next
morning.  Why cannot we do so?  But I did not come here to preach a sermon to you, although I
would as soon do it as not.  A street fight keeps the people excited for about two weeks; an
elopement gives them something to converse about for one year, but a murder they will never get
over talking about it.  The whites of Honolulu have no jokes to indulge in.  They are not imbued
with the spirit of joking.  I told some jokes to a quiet, sober-looking, grave, and demure
missionary, and I believe he is exercised over some of the subtler ones to this day.  The
missionaries do not know one third the names of sins which figure in the sin calendar.  Pity we are
not more like them.  The people do not get often drunk in that country; the duties are too high.
But I saw some of the wild ranchmen of Hawaii drink kerosene and aquafortis, and I saw some of
them get drunk on a whole barrel of Mustang Liniment.  When the natives eat, they all eat
socially, from the same calabash, one after the other, with their fingers.  They are not very
particular or careful whether these hands are washed or not.  It is not absolutely necessary that
they should wash their hands.  They have a fish called poy which they eat.  Eating poy will cure a
drunkard.  In order to like the poy you must get used to it.  It smells a good deal worse than it
tastes, and it tastes a good deal worse than it looks.  I am sending all my friends there.</p>

<p>The natives are of a rich, dark brown color, lazy, perhaps, but not vicious, nor very virtuous.
The women wear a long, loose calico garment, but the men don't. [Loud and continued applause.]
Guess I won't continue that subject any longer.  In former times the King's person was sacred, he
was the supreme head of the Church and State, he was the captain over all, the arbiter of fate, the
Lord of life.  There was a law that if a man came to the king with a wet head, he should die; if any
man's shadow fell on the king he had to die.  If the king put his taboo on anyone, there was no
hope for him (by the bye, from there we got our word tabooed).  In former times the women were
abject slaves of the whole party.  By the ancient taboo, (law of the land,) death was the
punishment of a woman who dared to sit at the same table as a man.  If she ate choice fruit, she
was to suffer the death penalty.  The poor degraded savages of these islands found out somehow
that a woman ate some fruit in the Garden of Eden, and the whole human race were suffering
from that thing ever since, and therefore they were not willing to take the chance of some other
evil overtaking them, by letting women eat any fruit.  But the American missionaries came, broke
off the shackles from the whole race, broke the power of the King, the State and the clergy, and
elevated the women to be the equal of the men.  To-day, it is the best educated nation in the
world, of its size.  Our missionaries did it all.  Every Kanaka has a dozen mothers.  If they like a
woman, they call her mother.  A Los Angelos man got there once, and being boss over a party of
Kanakas, one day one of them came to him, and asked leave of absence to go and bury his
mother.  Of course the leave was granted.  In about a month he came to ask for another leave of
absence, for the same purpose, he got that also.  For several times he obtained leave of absence to
go and bury a mother.  On the fifth demand, the Los Angelos man asked him how many mothers
he had.  He answered--twelve--well, go and bury them all, but don't let me see you again.</p>

<p>Those natives are strange folk.  They are not afraid of death, no, no more than a jilted
Frenchman.  If they take a notion to die, nothing will stop them, you can't argue it out of them.
They are also fond of dogs.  Such dogs that a white man would condemn at first right on general
principles.  They are not large dogs, neither; neither are they useful ones, but ugly curs.  They love
the pups, better than any of their own family.  They will take care of a pup--pet him--feed
him--caress him--fondle him, and when he has become fat, they kill him--cook him--and then eat
him.
The natives are very fond of raw fish, they will bite into a living fish, and then eat him up.  There
used to be some cannnibals, but they are almost played out.  One cannibal once, after eating
several specimens of his own race, caught a missionary--killed him--and served him up, but he
could not digest the old missionary, no more than he could a keg of nails; he died--miserably died.
They are also very fond of horses.  These are probably worth about seven dollars and a half--the
scrubbiest lot of horses in the world.  They have eleven distinct styles of gallop.  When one of
them gallops he mixes them all up at once, making it rather uncomfortable.  The women all ride
like men.  I wish to introduce that reform in this country.  Our ladies ought, by all means to ride
like men, these side saddles are so dangerous.  When women meet each other on the road, they
run and kiss and hug each other, and they don't blackguard each other behind each other's backs.
I would like to introduce that reform, also.  I am not married, myself, but yet I have no right to
advertise myself this way publicly.  Still I am not married.  In former times, when a great noble
died, they bit pieces of their own bodies off--knocked two or three teeth out.  They would also
kill now and then an infant--bury him alive sometimes.  But the missionaries have annihilated
infanticide.  The American missionaries are opposed to infanticide--for my part, I can't see why.
It is an old adage, be virtuous and you will be happy.  The nation are not virtuous and yet they are
happy.  When a woman cries, a dozen others will congregate around and they will whine, blubber,
bawl and sniffle for an hour together.  Rare sympathizing crowd.  I will end this chapter and the
lecture by stating that they do everything wrong end foremost, dismount from a horse the wrong
side, and mounting a horse on the wrong side.  The same word stands for good-bye and how do
you do.  In the noble American game of high-low-jack or seven-up, they deal the cards to the left
instead of the right.  They bathe in the middle of the day, and are liable to kill themselves.  When
inviting a person to approach, they make a sign, that with us is considered a repulsive motion.
The duck, a water bird, lives 5000 feet above the level of the water.  They dance at funerals, and
spit on a spoon when they want to clean it.  They wash their shirts with a club, and iron them with
a brick-bat.</p>

<p>The talented young lecturer closed his flow of wisdom, by stating that by an inadvertence, he
had forgotten to inform his appreciative audience "that the Reverend Robert Colyer was lecturing
at the Philharmonic hall, and it seemed by that omission he had swindled the reverend gentleman
out of a crowd."  Everyone retired highly delighted with the irrepressible Californian.</p>

<p>We had a call, yesterday, from an old friend, Mark Twain (Sam Clemens, Esq.), the
California humorist whom we had not seen since we parted from him on the sunward side of
the Sierra Nevadas some three years ago.  The aroma of sage brush does not hang around him
still.  The gentle "Washoe Zephyrs," which lifted a loaded quartz wagon with remarkable ease,
have left no rough traces upon his good-humored face.  The many feet which he once owned in
Washoe, "wild cat" claims, out of which he expected to realize untold wealth, have long since
been "sold for assessments," and yet he can still laugh, and make others laugh.  He is, indeed,
"a fellow of infinite jest" -- as our friends may learn to their entire satisfaction by attending a
lecture which he proposes to give in this city on Tuesday next.</p>

<p>Mark's funny stories and quaint sayings are not so well known here as in California,
where they have secured for him a reputation not surpassed by any humorist that ever
attempted to amuse that people, who are, perhaps, more critical than any other community in
the Union.</p>

<p>His wit and his style are peculiarly his own -- original, racy and irresistible.</p>

<p>The first time we heard Mark was at Carson City, the capital of the State of Nevada, on
the assembling of the Territorial Legislature in the winter of 1863-4.  Hon. James W. Nye
(now U.S. Senator) was then Governor of the Territory.  After the delivery of the inaugural to
the "assembled wisdom" of Silverland, Mark Twain took the speaker's stand and delivered his
inaugural as Governor of the Territory chosen by the "Third House," to a very large audience
of gentlemen and about all the ladies then in Carson City.  It was received with great applause
and roars of laughter.  Mark gave the Governor some hard hits, in a sly way, but no one
enjoyed the fun more than rotund and rubicund Nye.</p>

<p>The lovers of genial humor will find nothing coarse or vulgar in MArk Twain's lecture.
He also sometimes (by mistake, he says) indulges in beautiful flights of fancy and eloquence.
But of his talent as a lecturer, our citizens will soon have an opportunity of judging, and we
bespeak for him, in advance, a fair audience.</p>

<b>From the New York <i>Times</i>, <br>
May 7, 1867</b><br><br>


A full and attentive audience assembled at the Cooper Institute last evening to listen to the recital
of Mark Twain's experiences in the Sandwich Islands. Nearly every one present came prepared
for considerable provocation for enjoyable laughter, and from the appearance of the mirthful faces
leaving the hall at the conclusion of the lecture, but few were disappointed, and it not too much to
say that seldom has so large an audience been so uniformly pleased as the one that listened to
Mark Twain's quaint remarks last evening. The large hall of the Union was filled to its utmost
capacity by fully two thousand persons, which fact spoke well for the brilliant reputation of the
lecturer and his future success. Mr. Twain's style is a quaint one, both in manner and method, and
throughout his discourse he managed to keep on the right side of his audience and frequently
convulsed it with hearty laughter. Some of the anecdotes related were wittily told, and so
embellished as to be doubly enjoyed by his hearers. While the speaker made some very amusing
comments upon the habits and customs of the Sandwich Islanders, he stated that all the facts
related by him were strictly true. The speaker gave the American missionaries great credit for
their work in civilizing and converting the Islanders, and spoke of the singular fact that the
descendants of these missionaries have no stain upon their moral character, being exemplary
citizens.<p>

During his description of the topography of the Sandwich Islands, the lecturer surprised his
hearers by a graphic and eloquent description of the irruption of the great volcano which occurred
in 1840, and his language was loudly applauded.<p>

Judging from the success achieved by the lecturer last evening, he should repeat the experiment
at an early day.<p>

<h3>Mark Twain as a Lecturer</h3>
</center>

About a year and a half ago, a communication entitled "Joe Smiley and his Jumping Frog," with
the hitherto unknown signature of "Mark Twain," appeared in <I>The Saturday Press</I> of this
city. The name, though new, was not remarkable, but the style of the letter was so singularly
fresh, original, and full of character as to attract prompt and universal attention among the readers
of light humorous literature. Mark Twain was immediately entered as a candidate for high
position among writers of his class, and passages from his first contribution to the metropolitan
press became proverbs in the mouths of his admirers. No reputation was ever more rapidly won.
The only doubt appeared to be whether he could satisfactorily sustain it. Subsequent productions,
however--most of them reproduced from California periodicals--confirmed the good opinion so
suddenly vouchsafed him, and abundantly vindicated the applause with which his first essay had
been received. In his case, as in that of many other American humorous writers, it was only the
first step that cost. Since that time he has walked easily--let us hope not too easily--over his
special course.<p>

His writings being comparatively new to the public, and his position having been so recently
established, it might perhaps, have been doubted whether his name would at present be sufficient
to attract an audience of any magnitude to witness his debut as a lecturer. But the proof of the
general good-will in which he is already held was manifested last Monday evening by his brilliant
reception at the Cooper Institute. The hall was crowded beyond all expectation. Not a seat was
vacant, and all the aisles were filled with attentive listeners. The chance offering of "The Jumping
Frog," carelessly cast, eighteen months ago, upon the Atlantic waters, returned to him in the most
agreeable form which a young aspirant for popular fame could desire. The wind that was sowed
with probably very little calculation as to its effect upon its future prospects, now enables him to
reap quite a respectable tempest of encouragement and cordiality. His greeting was such as to
inspire the utmost ease and confidence, and it is pleasant to add that his performance in every way
justified the favor bestowed upon him. No other lecturer, of course excepting Artemus Ward, has
so thoroughly succeeded in exciting the mirthful curiosity, and compelling the laughter of his
hearers.<p>

The subject of his address, "The Sandwich Islands," was treated mainly from a comic stand-point,
although scraps of practical information and occasional picturesque descriptions of scenery and
natural phenomena peculiar to that region were liberally interspersed. The scheme of the lecturer
appeared to be to employ the various facts he had gathered as bases upon which to build fanciful
illustrations of character, which were furthermore embellished with a multitude of fantastic
anecdotes and personal reminiscences. The frequent incongruities of the narration--evidently
intentional--made it all the more diverting, and the artifice of its partial incoherence was so
cleverly contrived as to intensify the amusement of the audience, while leaving them for the most
part in ignorance of the means employed. As to the manner of the speaker, it is difficult to write
explicitly. It was certainly peculiar and original. Perhaps no better idea of it could be conveyed
than by saying it is in almost every respect the exact opposite to that of the late Artemus Ward. It
suited that admirable lecturer's humor to exhibit a nervous quickness and a vivacity which always
communicated itself to those who surrounded him, and his best "points" were made by the droll
affection of complete unconsciousness with which he uttered the most telling jests. Mark Twain's
delivery, on the other hand, is deliberate and measured to the last degree. He lounges comfortably
around his platform, seldom referring to notes, and seeks to establish a sort of button-hole
relationship with his audience at the earliest possible moment. He is even willing to exchange
confidences of the most literal nature. Having made an accidental error in figures, last Monday
evening, at which there was great laughter, he paused and requested to be informed "what he had
said," and was indisposed to proceed until his curiosity should be gratified. Instead of manifesting
indifference to his own good jokes, he appears to relish them as heartily as anybody--a
characteristic, by the bye, which also belongs to the most eminent "reader" now known to the
British public. The only obvious preconcerted "effect" which he employs is a momentary
hesitation or break in his narration before touching the climax of an anecdote or a witticism. But
his style is his own, and needs to be seen to be understood. A second opportunity for this, we
learn, is presently to be afforded, to which, when it approaches, we shall invite particular
attention.

Mark Twain discoursed about the Sandwich Islands for an hour last night at the Music Hall, and
although at the early part of the lecture there was evidently some disappointment, he soon was in
favor with his hearers, and the last two-thirds of the production were richly enjoyed. Mr. Clemens
is truly an original lecturer, his manner being as unique as his matter. He spoke without notes,
walked about the stage most of the time, and was dry and droll, serious and even pathetic. His
matter was a series of surprises, it being difficult for the listener to know what was earnest and
what was fun. His most ludicrous jokes were related with a serious air, that imparted a fresh
flavor to them. The entertainment, for such indeed it was, was a very enjoyable one, so enjoyable
and peculiar that all attempts to describe it would fail. The hearty applause given indicated that
the audience were pleased.<p>

<h3>Mark Twain on "The Sandwich Islands."</h3>
</center>

Boston had a very novel, if not a very startling, sensation last evening in the shape of a lecture
from Mr. Samuel L. Clemens, who is known to fame as the humorist Mark Twain. Known to
fame, we say, for who that breathes the vital air in America has not heard of the jumping frog of
Calaveras County, California? and who has not read of the "new specimen" which Mark Twain
made by combining a hawk and a crow in "one neat job"? A company, even greater than that
which usually attends the Bureau lectures, assembled in the Music Hall that night with faces
primed for merriment, and punctually to the hour Mr. Clemens and Mr. Redpath appeared upon
the platform. This was of course, and it was also of course that for fifteen minutes afterwards the
speaker's voice should be made inaudible by the rustling and creaking and tramping of the regular
crowd of the tardy.<p>

Mark Twain is a very good looking man. He is of medium height and moderately slender build,
has light brown hair, a reddish brown moustache, regular features and a fresh complexion; and he
has a queer way of wrinkling up his nose and half closing his eyes when he speaks. The expression
of his face is as calm and imperturbable as that of the sphinx. Looking at him you feel it to be an
impossibility that he should ever hurry or ever be out of temper, and you might suppose him to be
incapable of a joke, if it were not for the peculiar twinkle in his merry eyes. His voice is
remarkably light and remarkably dry--like some German wines--and it seems to be modulated to
only two keys. His style of speaking is unique to the last degree. It is all of a piece with the quality
of his humor, and fits him like a glove. He delivers his sentences without haste, and in a tone of
utter indifference, marking the highest waves of his thought only by a strong flavor of nasality,
and knowing for the most part only the rising inflection at the beginning, middle and end of his
sentences. The rising inflection is not native here, nor is it born in the manner of any of our own
speakers. Mr. Dickens first taught us how it might be used to advantage; and Mark Twain,
doubtless without borrowing a leaf from Mr. Dickens's note-book, has found out for himself how
effective an adjunct it is to humorous speech. In short, the platform manner of Mr. Clemens is the
exact reflection in speech of his peculiar style of composition. The fun of both is genuine enough;
but the perception of the fun is unmeasurably heightened by the apparently serious intention of the
general discourse, and at times by an air of half seriousness in the joke itself. The audience gets
into a queer state after a while. It knows not what to trust; for while much is meant to be seriously
taken, the fun is felt to be the real life of the thing; and yet they never know where the fun will
come in. Even when Mr. Clemens has made a really fine period, or introduced a brilliant
descriptive passage, he takes pains to turn the affair into a joke at the end. As, for instance, after a
very graphic and well written description of the great volcanic eruption in the Sandwich Islands,
delivered with perfect indifference and almost as if with an effort--he paused for just an instant,
and then said in the same passionless tone--"There! I'm glad I've got that volcano off my mind."
The manner is a direct resultant of the matter; and the manner of his speech does a great deal for
the substance of his discourse. The story of "Our Fellow-Savages in the Sandwich Islands" would
not be nearly so funny to read as it is to hear from Mark Twain's lips;--though we do not mean to
deny that there is a great deal of genuine and irresistible humor in the texture of the discourse.
Indeed, we mean to say, distinctly, that the contrary was the fact, and that Mr. Clemens showed
himself last night in the character of a very quaint, peculiar, and eminently original humorist.
America has produced, at least, a quintette of genuine humorists, whose productions have many
of the <i>indicia</i> of genius, if they are not wholly inspired by it.<p>

We are obliged to say again, as we said in the cases of Nasby and Josh Billings, that there is little
use in trying to write a sketch of the discourse. But we must attempt to give our readers a little
taste of the speaker's quality. Mr. Clemens devoted the first ten minutes of his lecture to a
painfully accurate description of a person afflicted with the most loathsome form of Oriental
leprosy; and then he gave five minutes to the narration of a boyish adventure which ended in his
seeing the horrible face of a dead man in the moonlight. And all this mass of horror for what?
Simply that he might say that his memory was full of unpleasant things so linked together that
when he thought of one he inevitably thought of another, and so on through the entire series; and
starting with leprosy and dead faces in the moonlight his mind necessarily ran through other
unpleasant things until it brought him to the Sandwich Islands and his lecture. The position of the
islands he gave geographically; but why they were placed so far away from everything and in such
an inconvenient space, he declined to consider. The man who would have discovered the islands
but did not, he said, was diverted from his course by a manuscript found in a bottle; and this, said
Mark Twain, is not the only case in which a man has been turned from the true path by
suggestions drawn from a bottle. The European nations brought into the islands their own
diseases, together with civilization, education and other calamities. The effect of this had been to
diminish the native population;--education in particular causing a frightful mortality as the
facilities for learning were multiplied. But fifty thousand natives are now left upon the islands, and
it is proposed to start a few more seminaries to finish them. The country people of the islands, the
women, he said, wear a single garment made of one piece; "and the men don't." But when the
weather is inclement the men wear cotton in their ears. The hospitality of the people he declared
to be of a very high and generous order. A stranger might enter any house and straightway his
host would set before him raw fresh fish with the scales on, baked dogs, fricasseed cats, and all
the luxuries of the season. But in trade they were exceedingly sharp and deceitful,--lying
invariably from one end of the transaction to the other; not descending to common lies either, but
indulging in lies that are "gorgeously imposing and that awe you by their grandeur." The fondness
of the islanders for dogs he declared to be intense. Dogs had the best of everything and were the
close companions of the men. "They fondle and caress the dog until he is a full grown dog, and
then they eat him." "I couldn't do that," said Mr. Clemens, in one of his dryest and funniest
passages; "I'd rather go hungry two days than eat an old personal friend in that way."<p>

At one point in his lecture, namely, in the midst of a discussion of cannibalism, Mark Twain
paused and said with an indescribable look: "At this point I usually illustrate cannibalism before
the audience: but I am a stranger here, and feel diffident about asking favors." However, he said,
if there is any one present who is willing to contribute a baby for the purposes of the lecture, I
should be glad to know it now. I am aware, though, that children have become scarce and high of
late, having been thinned out by neglect and ill treatment since the woman movement began.<p>


But we must leave the rest to the imagination of our readers, only saying that Mr. Clemens told
two of the funniest of exaggerated stories in the most irresistible fashion, and concluded his
lecture with a few graceful words of thanks to the audience for their attention. Perhaps he is not a
great humorist, but he is a genuine humorist. The man who can say that the Islanders' dish of plain
dog "is only our cherished American sausage with the mystery removed" is one whose reputation
fame will not suffer to die; and if Mr. Clemens can please everywhere as he pleased in Boston last
night, he will be sure to make his fortune if he does not become a standard author.<p>

<font size=-1>THE LECTURE SEASON.<br>
NABBY--MARK TWAIN--DE CORDOVA.</font>
</center>
<p>
I was going to head this paragraph "The Humorist Lecturers," but the only professed humorist
among the three men I have named is Mark Twain. De Cordova is not a humorist at all; and
Nasby's humor is subordinate to his radicalism and reformatory power. De Cordova is a nice
looking person and is well dressed. "He is put upon the stage unexceptionably," as the theatrical
critics say of a new piece at Selwyn's. The screen, the foot-lights, the music stand on which he
places his manuscript, are all very nice, and you are somewhat reminded of Dickens when you
look at the whole arrangement. And De Cordova is not unlike Dickens in his gesticulation, being
very active and sprightly and dramatic on his platform. But his lecture is very thin stuff. I heard
him describe the sham family. Ezra Penniman and Anastasia Johnson,--if I have their names
right,--were portrayed justly enough, and all the others of the intermarried Penniman-Johnson
family; and the bits were all fair, and in the direction of justice and good sense. But the satire was
of the mildest sort. Mr De Cordova is, among the lecturers, what one of the illustrated weeklies of
the poorer sort would be among newspapers, provided it were better printed and on better paper.
There is no wit in him, and no humor. His audience, however, seemed pleased, and not bored by
his vivacious nothingness. Nasby applied his remarkable powers of irony and fun to the woman
question. I have a little doubt whether his lecture was enjoyed by all his hearers. In the first place
the woman cause is not so far advanced that a lecturer who supports the common sense view can
be sure of the entire sympathy of an average Boston audience. The Fraternity ticket holders may
be supposed to be more radically inclined than any others, but there must be, even among these,
many ignorant persons, such as follow Fulton, who are not converted, and are probably incapable
of conversion. Then the finest irony, such as Nasby's requires, except in the quickest witted, rather
too great a strain of attention for its full appreciation, and for this reason I think Nasby would do
well to make his lecture (at least until the people become familiar with the woman question,)
mainly argumentative, and let the irony and fun come in frequently and in spurts. I noticed that
when, near the close of his speech, he left his assumed character of the conservative, and spoke
earnestly in his true radical shape, he got the largest amount of applause. By and by, when the
apologists for the subjection of woman are as few and as bad-charactered as the apologists for
slavery, Nasby's lecture will be as greatly relished as his wonderful letters. His manner on the
stage is not specially happy. He reads, and hurries through his lecture. Lowell says of Alcott,
comparing him to a lamb, that "he goes to sure death when he goes to his pen," and I might
almost say, so great is the difference between Nasby as a lecturer and as a writer, that he goes to
his death when he goes <i>from</i> his pen. But this would not be true. His lecture was a
success. It was in argument admirable. Nobody in this country has so keen a scent for a humbug
as Nasby. How much he did for us by his inimitable satires upon Johnson and the negro-hating
democracy. And now, as I am rejoiced to see, he makes his quarry that glorified and ermined
imposture, Chief Justice Chase, and I wish him equal success in hunting him down. May he live
long to lecture as well as to write. Mark Twain is a man of a different sort. He (and Nasby also as
I am informed), was very nervous at the idea of meeting a Boston audience, though what there is
in a Boston audience to frighten anybody I cannot imagine. Boston people are moved by the same
appeals, they laugh at the same jokes, yawn at the same dullness, wonder at the same platitudes,
as other people. There was no occasion for anxiety in either case. Twain cut his lecture short,
finishing it at about 20 minutes before nine, evidently afraid that he was boring his hearers. The
best tribute I can give to his performance is to say that I was very sorry to lose the other half
hour, to which, as a paying dead-head critic, I thought myself entitled. The lecture was delivered
without notes, and so, prima facie, had an advantage over Nasby's. Voice, manner, gesticulation,
were all good; and the drawl, whether natural or a trick of art, was an effective aid to the story
and the joke. There was no inconsiderable amount of information about the Sandwich Islands and
the Kanakas, and some admirable bits of description, so admirable, indeed, that I felt myself a
little misused when, getting ready to applaud a genuine piece of eloquence, I was interrupted by
the remark, in a low tone, "There, I'm glad I've got that volcano off my mind." Or, "There, I call
that rather neat." The Advertiser has so cleverly picked out the plums of this discourse, that I will
not quote much. The remark about the islanders' dish of plain dog, that "it is only our cherished
American sausage with the mystery removed," is likely to live as long as the best of the
anti-sausage jokes. The story of the man who was thrown into the air by the premature explosion
of a blast, while he was tamping the charge, and who went up and up till he was but a speck in the
sky, and then came down and down and struck his crowbar into the same hole and went on
tamping again, was irresistibly funny, and its nub, viz: that the man, though gone only fifteen
minutes, had that amount of time deducted from his pay, was better even than the story itself. The
proposition to illlustrate cannibalism by an experiment if anyone among the audience would
contribute a baby for the purpose, was perhaps the funniest thing in the lecture, and it is hard to
describe the dry style of his following remark, quoted in the Advertiser, "I am aware, though, that
children have become scarce and high of late, having been thinned out by neglect and ill-treatment
since the woman movement began." On the whole, Mark Twain is not only a genuine
humorist,--that we all know,--but an enjoyable and successful lecturer.</p>

<p>Last evening the Academy was filled to overflowing, to partake of the literary Sandwich
prepared and offered by that mirth-provoking humorist, Mark Twain.  His lecture was appositely
introduced by a series of witty generalities closely connected with cannibalism and craters. . . .
The Sandwich Islands have a very limited area--scarcely enough, indeed, to contain a voluminous
thought. . . . Mr. Twain, Esq., lecturer, etc., was a success. . . . Twain is not riotous with his
fancy; he is tenderly poetical and discreet.  His descriptions of the volcanoes of the islands were
very fine.  They were exquisite set-offs to the humorous or rather buttery parts of his ragout.  We
are at a loss to know whether he is a wit or a humorist.  At one time we had some distinct idea of
the difference between these two qualities, but Twain has literally jumbled us all up.  If it were not
for Twain we should set him down as a wit, but the inevitable presence causes us to classify him
with the humorists. . . . He is a rare combination of wit and humor.  He abounds in seasonable
hits.  He has no elocution, but simply a style that knows no restraints but simply those necessary
to provoke mirth.  His "Sandwich" is admirable for dyspepsia; even a roast dog and fricasseed cat
become agreeable after a little familiarity. . . . The man who can administer to the mind healthful
relaxatives, and thereby restore the stomach, is certainly entitled to rank with those who do the
same with the stomach and thereby restore the mind.</p>

<h2>Mark Twain.</h2>
</center>

Mark Twain, the celebrated humorist, was honored last night with one of the largest audiences
ever assembled in the Academy of Music. He lectured upon "The Sandwich Islands," and mingled
with much very interesting information a vast amount of humorous anecdote, witty allusion, and
of that odd, incongruous, surprising divergence from his theme, which is his charming
characteristic. Mr. Clemens deserved the compliment bestowed upon him. We regard him as the
very best of the humorists of his class. He is more extravagant and preposterous than John
Phoenix; he is superior to Artemus Ward, not only in the delicate quality of his humor, but
because he has a decent regard for the English language, and does not depend for his effects upon
barbarous orthography. John Billings is not to be compared with him. Billings is merely a
proverbial philosopher who has some wit, plenty of hard common sense, a shrewd knowledge of
human nature, but not one particle of genuine, irrepressible fun. He has said some good things,
but they are all marred by the wretched spelling which the author considers necessary to his
success. Mark Twain indulges in humor because it is his nature to do so. It is impossible to read
his productions or to hear him speak without being impressed with the conviction that his
cleverest utterances are spontaneous, natural, unpremeditated. Like all men of his temperament he
has a hearty hatred of sham, hypocrisy and cant, whether in religion, social life or politics. Some
of his sturdiest blows have been aimed at the follies of the times; and we believe that he may, if he
chooses, exercise a very considerable influence as a reformer. Ridicule, cleverly used, is one of the
most powerful weapons against pretension and humbug; for it not only robs them of their false
dignity, but it appeals strongly to the popular reader, and finds ready acceptance where serious
discussion would not be permitted. We do not suppose that Mr. Clemens has any notion of
starting out upon a mission of reformation; but unconsciously he may do a good work in this
direction, while at the same time he furnishes the nation with the purest and best entertainment in
his lectures and his screeds. There may be some who will regard his calling as of smaller dignity
than that of other men. Perhaps this is the class with which he is at war. The mass of intelligent
people will agree with us that genuine humor is as rare and excellent a quality as any other, and
that it is as respectable to amuse mankind as to stupefy them. The number of persons engaged in
the former work is small; those who attempt the latter abound in quantities.

Every one who went to Music Hall last evening--and there was a good house despite the mist and
mud--expected to go home splitting their sides with laughter. People everywhere are familiar with
"Mark Twain," but comparatively few have yet had an opportunity of seeing Mr. Samuel H.
Clemens. An hour with Mark is like gentle dew upon a withering flower; when he lifts the curtain
and comes as Mr. Clemens, the lecturer, it is like the tickling of a sleepy boy with a
feather--perfectly ravishing until the eyes are opened, but which he doesn't care to experience a
second time. Mr. Clemens is a true wit, with his pen, and his works will live after he has gone, but
his course as a lecturer will end when the curiosity of his thousands of readers shall have been
satisfied by a good square look at him. His lecture on "Our Fellow Savages of the Sandwich
Islands," is a tissue of nonsense from beginning to end, and his delivery is as disgusting as the
lecture is foolish. Still, people clamor for a look, and we are inclined to think one dose will be
enough for the most admiring. The audience last evening enjoyed, not the hearty laugh they
anticipated, but a protracted, vexatious titter, and felt relieved when the end came.<p>

<center><b>Review of Mark Twain's Lecture.--<br>
Respectfully Dedicated to those People who admire Gough<br>
and can't bear Independent Criticism.--</b></center>
</p>
<p>
Mark Twain lectured at Institute Hall last evening. At an early hour the intelligent, virtuous,
high-minded, patriotic and well-dressed people of this enterprising and lovely village might have
been seen wending their way to the Hall, &c., &c. The Hall was well filled, all the seats that were
occupied being crowded. As Mr. Byron (whom some of our readers may remember sometimes
made up verses out of his head), once said, "the lamps shone bright o'er fair women and brave
men and all went merry as a marriage bell." (Lest any one should take offense however, we
explain that the Hall was <i>not</i> lighted with "lamps" but with gas, manufactured by our
intelligent, efficient and high-minded Gas Co. Bryon is to blame for the word "lamps" in this
quotation, not we. We hope this explanation will prevent the Gas Co. shutting off our gas again,
or any one else being offended and stopping his paper.) The <i>elite</i> of this place was
assembled, &c., &c. It is rarely seldom that so select an audience fills Institute Hall. The lecturer
no doubt felt highly honored and flattered at his reception, &c., &c.<p>

Of the lecture we need say nothing, &c. Mr. Twain spoke for himself, &c. We only need say that
it was fully up to expectations, and exceeded the anticipations of the most sanguine and skillful
anticipatist in this section. While we do not wish to wound by harsh criticism, we have no
hesitation in saying and we say it boldly that this lecture gave entire satisfaction to that numerous
class of our readers who like that kind of a lecture. Still, we may be mistaken in this opinion and if
so we are willing to be corrected; we trust that like Mr. Heap we are "umble" and would not
venture to make so broad a declaration as the above without offering to take it back if it did not
prove satisfactory to the intelligent readers of our widely-circulated and influential J<font
size=-1>OURNAL</font>.<p>

We cannot better and less offensively sum up the merits of this delightful, beautiful, eloquent,
grand, extraordinary, lovely, forcible, convincing, pious, exciting, splendid lecture than in the one
word with which the fascinating and fashionably-haired young lady so fitly described Niagara
Falls--<i>pretty</i>. It should have been heard to be appreciated, &c., &c. Time and space will
not allow us to say anything about the lecture here and at this time. We leave that disreputable
task to the heartless wretch who so audaciously refused to admire the transcendant merits of
Gough's temperance lecture and walk around. Those of our citizens who did not attend missed a
rare treat. (Lest our temperance friends should be offended we explain that "treat" here does not
refer to anything ardent.) Mr. Twain entered fully into the spirit of his performance. (Our readers
who tie to spiritual manifestations will take no offense at the word "spirit;" it is not used in a
supernatural sense.) To say this lecture was well received is only the naked truth (no offense
meant to our lady readers by the term here applied to truth.) Mr. Twain's lecture should be in
every library, and on every centre table, and on every faro table, and every bar, and in every livery
stable, and in all other places which deserve mention here; we hope we shall not be deemed
invidious in not naming them all.<p>

We should be guilty of the blackest hearted ingratitude, sacrilege, and inattention to a blessed
institution did we neglect to introduce in this connection a silver-plated puff on the Y. M. C. A.,
and the managers of the lecture course. By bringing Mr. Twain here they have conferred a great
benefit on our people, have given the prosperity of the place a substantial boost, have placed us
under renewed obligations to them, &c., &c. The citizens will hold them in grateful memory and
future generations will inscribe their names

<b>Mark Twain Criticised--An Indignant Spectator.--</b>
</center>
<p>
Mr. Editor.--As your paper professes to allow free criticism, I wish you would give me a chance
to pitch into Mark Twain's lecture. I was one of the victims. I confess I did not comprehend his
lecture, as I did not the subject announced on the bills. "Our fellow cannibals!" Now what does
that mean? Cannibals are men who eat folks, ain't they? And if they are our fellows it means
<i>we</i> eat folks too, if I understand it correctly, don't it? Is this true? If not it is a slander on
the people of this great and enlightened nation.<p>

Starting out with a theme that either is a falsehood, or else means nothing, the whole lecture was
the same. He commenced by <i>introducing himself</i>--an unusual procedure and I believe an
undeserved slight on the lecture committee who were present and ready to introduce him.<p>

And then he proceeded to his lecture--and what did it amount to? What new or valuable thing did
he tell us of the Sandwich Islands? What that we could not read at home? He says he has been
there, but he must have used his senses to little purpose if he could not pick up more interesting
facts than he narrated in his lecture. His intimation that <i>civilization</i> was responsible for the
decrease of population there is another insult to America. And what sense is there in describing a
man as being <i>dressed in an umbrella?</i> Like a fool, he omitted to tell what the personal
costume of the Islander is, only saying that it wouldn't take more than a minute to tell it; if it was
so easy to tell why omit it? Where is the sense in referring to a thing and then telling nothing
about it? Then, could there be anything more disgusting than his talk about the baked dogs? Well
enough, perhaps, to explain that the Islanders eat dogs, but why dwell on it with such gusto when
he said himself that he had no appetite for the dish? Did he suppose <i>we</i> had, that he talked
so about it?<p>

In equally bad taste was his reference to cannibalism. That incident about the poor old sea-captain
who was so barbarously devoured was of course affecting, but why need he introduce it without
giving the <i>moral</i> to it--especially as he said he told it only for the moral that was in it? Is it
not an evidence of Twain's excessive stupidity that he could tell that story, as he confessed, forty
or fifty times without once giving the moral to it.<p>

And I think every intelligent person in the audience must have felt insulted, actually insulted, at his
telling about a man being blown up out of sight and gone fifteen minutes and coming down in the
very same identical spot and going to work again and the company docking him for 15 minutes
lost time, expecting us to believe it. I consider the story preposterously unlikely. I don't doubt a
company being mean enough to dock him, but could any man go up and come down again and go
right to work without stopping to rest? Even if the story is true, I don't see what it has to do with
the Sandwich Islands. You complain that our glorious Gough introduced matter foreign to his
subject and yet say nothing about this unwarranted, absurd digression of Twain's. It makes a
difference whose ox is gored, I notice!<p>

And what sense was there in the lecturer's offering to illustrate cannibalism if any one would send
up a baby to the platform. He knew perfectly well that in such an advanced community as this,
infants are not allowed in the lecture room. And even if they were, did he suppose any mother
would send up her child for such a purpose. It is a significant comment on this proposition that,
inhuman as it was, it was the <i>only part</i> of his lecture that was <i>strictly relevant</i> to
the subject; have your readers thought of that? It reveals the only glimmer of sense there is in the
expression "our fellow-cannibals." Mr. Twain may be correct in using that expression for himself,
but not in including others in the barbarous imputation, as he does when he uses the pronoun
"<i>our</i>." He should announce as his theme, "<i>My</i> fellow-cannibals."<p>

Another disgusting thing was the conceited manner and egotism of the speaker. He seemed to
think himself smart, &c., and did not hesitate to boldly hint that he thought so. If he has any
friends they should tell him what a silly appearance he makes.<p>

And so I might go on, showing the irrelevancy and senselessness of nearly all his lecture. It was
entirely worthless. I never was so disappointed in a performance in my life. I went there expecting
to hear something thrilling and original about those interesting islands and this trash was all he had
to offer. Some silly young people laughed, though what they could see to laugh at I don't know. I
felt more like hiding my head in shame, disgust, annoyance, chagrin and mortification. I could not
help thinking of our noble missionaries in those far-away Islands, and how pained they would feel
when they came to know that the field of their labors had been so abominably and jestingly
represented here.<p>

Instead of joining you in the opinion that our Lecture Committee has won fame by getting Mark
Twain here to lecture, I declare that they have offended the good taste and religious scruples of
the sober portion of this community by introducing his ill-timed levity and in this opinion I am
sustained by nine-tenths of that portion of the community. I therefore enter a solemn protest
against Mark Twain, and in behalf of the serious portion of this community, sign myself,<p>

<h3>Mark Twain's Lecture.</h3>
</center>

We had not opportunity last week of speaking particularly of the entertainment furnished by Mr.
Twain in his lecture at Egberts' Hall on Friday evening. It was altogether a novel production, so
different, in fact, from what people usually hear from the platform, that the audience was
somewhat disappointed; but quite agreeably so, however, for all complained that the lecture was
too short, notwithstanding the speaker occupied a full hour in the delivery of his queer, quaint and
quizzical remarks. His introduction of himself was remarkably Twain-ish and placed him and his
hearers upon good terms at once. He gave many interesting facts concerning the Sandwich
Islands, as well as funny incidents, and droll experiences which were all jumbled together in a
promiscuous manner that was quite fascinating. From some of his best stories we select the
following which "brought down the house":<p>

He said that there was a sort of tradition or belief in the Sandwich Islands, that every great and
noted liar always brings up there, in some time of his life. Of course, they stayed there for good
and did not come back delivering lectures. One of the greatest of these was a man by the name of
Morgan. After he died the natives venerated his memory and recollected him with affection. Once
when he was asked if he had ever heard of the Natural Bridge of Virginia, he answered. "Of
course, didn't my father help to build it?" Another time, when he was telling about a fast horse he
once owned, he said that, "In a thunder storm one day, he rode eighteen miles without getting a
drop of water on him, while his dog was swimming along behind!"<p>

One day, while the company were telling stories of mean men, this Morgan capped the climax by
telling about a corporation of mean men. "This corporation were having some blasting done, and
one day, while one of the men was drilling away, he by chance struck a spark, and the result was a
premature blast which blew the man up straight in the air. For a little while he appeared as large as
a man, then went up till he looked as large as a boy, then higher till he looked like a doll, then till
he looked as large as a bee, and then out of sight. He soon came back again looking as large as a
bee, then down till he looked as large as a doll, nearer, till he looked like a boy, then a man again,
and came down with his crowbar in precisely the same spot as before, and began drilling away.
Now this man was not gone more than fifteen minutes, and this corporation of mean men
<i>docked him for lost time!</i>"<p>

We regret that so few were present at this and other lectures given under the auspices of the Sons
of Temperance and the "Grand Army of the Republic." The gentlemen composing these
associations have, at great sacrifice of time and money, furnished our citizens with quite as good a
course of lectures as have been given in our neighboring cities, yet we regret to say, they have as
a whole, been poorly patronized, and in many cases found fault with. Some say, "why don't you
get Beecher?" Others, "why don't you get Gough or George W. Curtis?" We will answer for
them. Mr. Beecher would not come at any price, and the sum asked by Mr. Gough was entirely
beyond the possibility of raising even if the hall were filled at fifty cents for each ticket, which,
judging by past experience, could not be done; for only a few seasons since, that celebrated
lecturer was advertised to speak in the M. E. Church, in behalf of the temperance cause, at
twenty-five cents admission, and the house was not half filled,--a fact not at all creditable to our
citizens. George W. Curtis might be obtained if the people would come out; but as in the case of
Mr. Gough, the last time he appeared before a Cohoes audience, the receipts failed to pay
expenses, and the association were compelled to make up the deficiency. This ought not to be, for
there is a sufficient number of intelligent people in our large population to sustain one or even two
courses of lectures creditably, if not profitably to those who take the trouble to secure them.<p>

In closing, we will state that the Sons of temperance have engaged George Francis Train, and the
G. A. R. have made an engagement with Dr. Hays, the celebrated Arctic explorer, and also with
Mr. J. Mines the editor of the Troy <i>Times</i>, to lecture before our citizens in a short time,
and we sincerely hope that they may have an audience, not only commensurate with their
reputation and talents as lecturers, but that the associations under whose auspices they are to
appear, may, to some extent, at least, be reimbursed for the losses they have sustained on former
occasions.<p>

<p>T<font size=-1>WAIN'S</font> L<font size=-1>ECTURE.</font>--Mark Twain was
greeted Saturday evening by an audience that any man might be proud of.  With a condition of
streets that under ordinary circumstances would keep people by their firesides, Doolittle Hall was
more completely filled than we remember ever to have seen it before on the occasion of a lecture.
In fact, there was not sitting room enough, and the aisles were pretty well filled with chairs and
benches.  Twain appeared pretty punctually, attended by the chairman and a member of the
lecture committee, both of whom he unceremoniously dismissed from the stage and took the
programme into his own hands.  After announcing the next lecture of the course by Prof.
Winchell, on the "Stone Folk," under which head, as Twain remarked, the Cardiff Giant is
included, Twain introduced himself in the following highly unique manner:</p>

<p><i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i>.--The <i>next</i> lecture of the course will be delivered this
evening by Samuel L. Clemens, otherwise Mark Twain, a gentleman whose high character and
unimpeachable integrity are only equalled by his comeliness of person and grace of manner.  And I
am the man.  You will excuse me for introducing myself, for I have just excused the chairman
from introducing me.  I know it's not the ordinary way, but the fact is I never yet have found a
chairman of a lecture committee who was equal to the task of introducing me as I ought to be
introduced."</p>

<p>This decidedly original introduction was greeted with shouts of laughter and is a fair specimen
of the vein in which the lecture on "Our Fellow Savages of the Sandwich Islands" was delivered.
It was a good sample of his style of humor, and threw the audience into frequent convulsions of
laughter.  Twain is a fair looking model of humanity, and his manner is sufficient to provoke a
smile.  He talks with great deliberation and brings out his words with a nasal accent long drawn
out which smacks of Yankeeism.  Twain has roamed over the world considerable, and wherever
the ridiculous side of human nature sticks out he has not failed to see and remember it.  He is a
humorist in the radical sense of the word, and his wit crystallizes around an atom of fun and
makes it sparkle like a diamond.</p>

<p>The lecture committee have given us two heavy lectures--Duryea's and Tilton's--and Twain's
was thrown in at just the right nick of time to make the course rest a little easier on our stomachs,
so to speak--like the wine after dinner.</p>

<center><b>MARK TWAIN.<br>
<hr width="30%">
"Our Fellow Citizens of the Sandwich<br>
Islands."</b></center>

<p>Samuel L. Clemens, better known perhaps as Mark Twain, the humorist, lectured in Union
Place Hall, West Troy, last night upon the above interesting topic.  Mr. C. came hither under the
auspices of Roy steamer company, and was greeted with a full house.  The lecture gave a world
of satisfaction.  Those who went to laugh were abundantly satisfied; those who went from any
other cause must have been likewise well pleased, for notwithstanding some things that are
repulsive about them no one can fail to like "our fellow savages."  Mr. Twain is a man about
thirty-five or forty years of age, somewhat tall and spare-built, and has the regular Western knack
of telling a story.  Next Winter Mark must make his bow to a Troy audience.  We present a brief
report of the lecture below:</p>

<p><i>Ladies and Gentlemen:</i> The--next--lecture--in--this--course--will--be--delivered this
evening, by Samuel L. Clemens,--a gentleman--whose--high--character and unimpeachable
integrity--are only equalled by his--comeliness--of--person--and--grace--of--manner.
And--I--am--the--man!  You will excuse me for introducing myself, for I have just excused the
chairman from
introducing me.  The fact is no chairman can introduce me as I ought to be introduced.
(Laughter.)</p>

<p>I come now to the Sandwich Islands, and shall tell the truth about them as nearly as I can.  If I
do embellish with some nonsense it is of no consequence.  This nonsense is the ornamental
barnacle that clings to the oyster.  As I was reared a good way from tide-water, I don't really
know whether the barnacle clings to the oyster or not--but I do.</p>

<p>When Capt. Cook discovered these islands, though another man came very near discovering
them two weeks before, they contained four hundred thousand souls.  White men came and
brought complicated diseases, civilization, education and other calamities, and shortly the natives
began to die off with commendable zeal.  Forty years ago they were reduced to two hundred
thousand, and by the last census they had dwindled down to fifty-five thousand.  It is proposed to
start a few more seminaries of learning and finish them off.  It is not education or civilization that
is doing this--it is the importation of disease.  Owing to consumption and other reliable diseases,
the natives are retiring from business very fast.  In color the natives are a rich, dark brown--a sort
of black and tan.  A very pleasing tint.  The easy-going ways they have inherited from their
ancestors have made them idle, but not vicious.  They are a very excellent people.  The native
women wear a single, long, loose garment.  But the men don't.  When there is a public ceremony
the men wear cotton umbrellas, or some little fancy article like that; but further than this, they
don't seem to have any inclination to gorgeousness of attire.  After speaking of the absolute sway
of the old-time kings, and the degradation of their subjects, the lecturer spoke of the women.</p>

<p>Down at the bottom of all this degradation and misery came the women.  They were abject
slaves--degraded to the ranks of brutes and beasts.  No better.  They had no privileges.  It was
death for a woman to eat at the table with her own husband.  Death for her to eat of the choice
fruits.  Even those poor debased savages had a notion of what had come by woman's eating the
forbidden fruit.  By and by the American missionaries broke the power of the chiefs, and lifted the
wives to an equality with the men.  The missionaries set up schools and taught them to read and
write with facility, and there is not a single ignorant person there now.  They are the best educated
people in the world.  I can testify to the zeal of the missionaries, and to their faith and devotion.
Still, all this work, extending over so many years and costing so much, was carried on by Sunday
school children.  We all took part in it.  True, the system gave opportunities to bad boys.  Many a
bad boy acquired the habit of confiscating pennies of the missionary cause.  But it is the proudest
reflection of my life that I never did that--at least not more than once or twice.</p>

<p>The natives are very hospitable.  They will give you a seat in their cabin, and fresh fish, raw
salt pork, baked dog, stewed cats, and all the luxuries of the season.  But when it comes to
business matters it is a different thing entirely--they will tell you one falsehood after another--lies
that will awe you with their grandeur--that are stunning in sublimity.  It doesn't discommode the
native in the least to do this.  And he slides out of it with an ease that is charming.  Every one of
them has half a dozen mothers.  I don't mean to say natural mothers, but adopted ones.  They
have a custom of calling any woman "mother" that they have taken a fancy to.  You see at once
that a native may have one hundred and fifty mothers.  This custom breeds some curious
incidents.  A California gentleman who owned a sugar plantation hired one of these natives to
work for him in the busy season.  He soon came to ask leave to bury his mother.  Shortly after he
came again with the same request.  "I thought you buried her last week," said the gentleman.
"This is another one," said the native.  "All right," said the gentleman, "go and plant her."  After a
few more such requests the planter said that he thought that his stock of mothers held out pretty
well, and told him to clear out and not come back again till he had buried every mother he had in
the world.</p>

<p>The natives of these islands are very fond of dogs.  Not the magnificent Newfoundlands nor
the graceful greyhound--but insignificant curs that a white man would despise.  There is not a
handsome feature about them unless it is their tail.  And there is nothing extraordinary about that.
A friend of mine said that if he owned one he would cut his tail off and throw the balance of the
dog away.  But the natives love these pups--they feed them from their own hands, sleep with
them, pet them, till they have grown to mature doghood, and then eat them.  Now I couldn't do
that.  I would rather go hungry two days than devour an old personal friend.  A native of these
islands will eat anything that he can bite.  They will take a fresh fish right out of the water and eat
him.  Of course it is inconvenient to the fish, but the native enjoys it.  It used to be a popular belief
that these islanders were cannibals.  But cannibalism never existed there, except in one instance.
And this cannibal was a foreigner who opened an office there and ate a good many of the natives.
He did a large business in this line.  In other cities, at this point in my discourse, it is my custom to
illustrate cannibalism.  But being a stranger here I don't feel at liberty to ask favors.  Still, if any
one in the audience would lend me an infant. [Laughter.] However, it doesn't matter.  I know that
little children have grown scarce and high, on account of neglect and inattention since the woman
movement set in.</p>

<p>Well, as I say, the cannibal opened his establishment there, but they say that by and by he got
tired of his diet.  Well, anybody would.  So he thought he would like to try and see how a white
man would go--and so he lay in wait, and captured a venerable whaling-ship captain, sixty-five
years in the service.  The cannibal did the best he could, but it was the worst thing he ever did.  Of
course, he could no more digest that old whaler than a keg of nails.  He suffered.  There is no
telling how much he suffered, with this sin on his conscience and the whaler on his stomach.  He
lingered for a few days, and then died.  Let this be a warning to you.  I don't know myself why it
should be a warning to you, but I notice that when other lecturers mention a historical fact they
do not believe in themselves, they always back it up with a moral.</p>

<p>With all their kindly ways these people practice some cruelties.  They will put a live chicken
into hot ashes simply to see it hop about.  They would burn the flesh before the missionaries
came, and would put out an eye, or a tooth, when a chief died.  And if their grief was deep, and
they could get relief in no other way, they would go out and scalp a neighbor.  In the season of
mourning for a great person they permit any crime that will best express great sorrow.</p>

<p>They do everything differently from other people. They mount a horse from the off side.
They turn to the left instead of the right.  They say the same words for "good bye" and "how do
you do."  They always, in beckoning for you to come, motion in the opposite direction.  Even the
birds partake of this peculiarity.  The native duck lives four thousand feet above the level of the
sea, and never sees water except when it rains.  They (the islanders) grown in a heart-broken way
when they are particularly happy.   They have some customs we might import to advantage.  I
don't call any to mind just now.</p>

<p>In Honolulu, they are the most easy-going people in the world.  Some of our people are not
acquainted with their customs.  They started a gas company once, and put the gas at $13 a
thousand feet.  They only took in $16 the first month.  They all went to bed at dark.  They are an
excellent people.  I speak earnestly.  They do not even know the name of some of the vices in this
country.  A lady called on a doctor.  She wanted something for general debility.  He ordered her
to drink porter.  She called him again.  The porter had done her no good.  He asked her how
much porter she had taken.  She said a tablespoonful in a tumbler of water.  I wish we could
import such a blessed ignorance into this country.  There are low white people in Hawaii who
would drink liquors if they could get them.  They drink kerosene, aqua fortis, hair oil, turpentine.
They do say that the whole population got terrifically drunk on the Fourth of July on a barrel of
Mrs. Winslow's soothing syrup.</p>

<p>The islands are delightful, because they are in the tropics.  The thermometer doesn't change
more than 12 degrees in twelve months.  It stands at about 70 the year round.  You can have any
climate you want.  Mountains that rise to a prodigious height, with eternal snows on the tops.
And as you come down you go through the climates of all the zones, and have the vegetation of
all the climes.</p>

<p>I must mention one feature of the place before I close.  It would not be proper to close
without speaking of it.  The white people there have a tradition that all the supremely gifted liars
in the world are confined to the Sandwich Islands.  They say that a man named Morgan there will
never permit anybody to beat him in telling a story.  When asked if he had heard of the Natural
Bridge, Virginia, he said of course he had, his father helped to build it.  He had the fastest horse in
the world, and in a thunder shower once he ran him eighteen miles and not a single drop of water
touched him, while he dog was swimming all the way behind the wagon.  He told of a company he
belonged to in California who hired one fellow to blast some rock.  Owing to carelessness there
was an explosion, and this fellow was blown up in the air till he didn't look any larger than a little
boy--then he looked no larger than a dog--then no larger than a bird--finally than a bee.  And then
he began to descend, and increased in size from a bee to a bird--and a dog--and a boy--and finally
to a full-sized man--coming down in exactly the same spot where he went up, and began to blast
rock immediately on landing.  Morgan said that fellow was gone only fifteen minutes, and yet they
docked him for lost time.</p>

<p>The lecturer here closed his address by thanking his audience for their attention and wishing
them a very pleasant good night.</p>

<p>Mark Twain is, to our taste, and in our judgment, the best humorist now before the public.
His humor is in the idea, and not in the mere use or misuse of words and phrases, which
unfortunately seem to constitute the sole resort of most of the so-called humorists of the day.  In
genuine fun, both in the idea and in the setting, Mark Twain is immeasurably in advance of
"Nasby," "Josh Billings" and the whole miscellaneous tribe of bad spellers and verbal
contortionists who assume to play a funny part among the ephemera of literature.  The very
"Petroleum" of Nasby is affected, and his peculiarities give zest rather to partisan politics than to
the multitude.  "Josh Billings" has a deal of humor but both he and Nasby shroud themselves in a
mystery of infamous orthography, which becomes tiresome and even painful in a short time, and
makes us turn with unmindful satisfaction to the natural and occasionally most singular humor of
Twain. . . . "Artemus Ward" in his well known lecture on "Babes in the Woods," made a point of
constantly avoiding his subject.  "Mark Twain" does nothing of the kind.  His lecture with the fun
out, would make a telling and accurate sketch of the Sandwich Islands and the natives thereof; but
with the fun in, it is a lecture that both amuses and instructs.</p>

from the Philadelphia <i>Press</i>,<br>
8 December 1869<br>

<p>Last evening the Academy was filled to overflowing, to partake of the literary Sandwich
prepared and offered by that mirth-provoking humorist, Mark Twain.  His lecture was appositely
introduced by a series of witty generalities closely connected with cannibalism and craters. . . .
The Sandwich Islands have a very limited area--scarcely enough, indeed, to contain a voluminous
thought. . . . Mr. Twain, Esq., lecturer, etc., was a success. . . . Twain is not riotous with his
fancy; he is tenderly poetical and discreet.  His descriptions of the volcanoes of the islands were
very fine.  They were exquisite set-offs to the humorous or rather buttery parts of his ragout.  We
are at a loss to know whether he is a wit or a humorist.  At one time we had some distinct idea of
the difference between these two qualities, but Twain has literally jumbled us all up.  If it were not
for Twain we should set him down as a wit, but the inevitable presence causes us to classify him
with the humorists. . . . He is a rare combination of wit and humor.  He abounds in seasonable
hits.  He has no elocution, but simply a style that knows no restraints but simply those necessary
to provoke mirth.  His "Sandwich" is admirable for dyspepsia; even a roast dog and fricasseed cat
become agreeable after a little familiarity. . . . The man who can administer to the mind healthful
relaxatives, and thereby restore the stomach, is certainly entitled to rank with those who do the
same with the stomach and thereby restore the mind.</p>

<p><center><i>MARK TWAIN'S LECTURE.</i><br>
<hr width="40%">
<font size=-1>"OUR FELLOW SAVAGES IN THE SANDWICH<br>
ISLANDS."</font></center>
</p>
<p>The second lecture of the Franklin Lyceum course was delivered last evening, at Harrington's
Opera House, by Samuel L. Clemens, of the Buffalo <i>Express</i>, familiarly known as "Mark
Twain."  We give the following extracts:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the first object I ever saw in the Sandwich Islands was a repulsive one.  It was
a case of Oriental leprosy, of so dreadful a nature that I have never been able to get it out of my
mind since.  I don't intend that it shall give a disagreeable complexion to this lecture at all, but
inasmuch as it was the first thing I saw in those islands, it naturally suggested itself first when I
proposed to talk about the islands.  It is a very hard matter to get a disagreeable object out of
one's memory.  I discovered that a good while ago.  A year or two ago, in one of the great
cathedrals in Milan, they showed me a great many curiosities, very interesting, but they all faded
out of my memory except just the one thing, and that was an unpleasant one.  It was a curious
ancient piece of statuary.  They don't know where it came from, or who made it; they only know
they have had it some five hundred years; but they imagine it must have come from Phidias,
because they suppose no other artist could have copied human nature with such faultless accuracy
of touch.  It is the figure of a man without a skin -- the figure of a freshly skinned man.  Every
fibre, tendon and tissue of the human frame was represented in minutest detail.  It was the
heaviest thing, and yet there was something fascinating about it.  It looked so natural; it looked as
if it was in pain, and you know a freshly skinned man would naturally look that way.  He would
unless his attention was occupied with some other matter.  It was a dreadful object, and I have
been sorry many a time since that I ever saw that man.  Sometimes I dream of him, sometimes he
is standing by my bedpost, sometimes he is stretched between the sheets, touching me -- the most
uncomfortable bedfellow I ever had.</p>

<p>One memory of a repulsive object leads to another, and that to another, and so on until I
finally come down to my lecture on the Sandwich Islands.  Now if an impression has gotten
abroad in the land that the Sandwich Islands are in South America, that is the error I wish to
attack; that is the error which I wish to combat.  I wish to remove it from your minds.  These
islands are situated some twenty-one hundred miles southwest from San Francisco, but why they
were put so far away in such an inconvenient locality is probably none of our business, and we
won't discuss that question at all.  The islands are a dozen in number, and their entire area is not
greater I suppose than that of Rhode Island and Connecticut combined.  They are of volcanic
origin, of volcanic construction I should say.  They are composed of lava, harder than any
statement I have made in fifteen years.  There is not a spoonful of legitimate dirt in the whole
group, unless it has been imported.  These islands were discovered some eighty or ninety years
ago by Captain Cook, though another man came very near discovering them before, and he was
diverted out of his course by suggestions he got out of a bottle. He wasn't the first man who has
been degraded by suggestions got out of a bottle.</p>

<p>The natives of the Sandwich Islands of color are a rich dark brown, a kind of black and tan.
The tropical sun and the easy-going ways inherited from their ancestors, have made them rather
idle, but they are not vicious at all, they are good people.  The native women in the rural districts
wear a single long loose garment.  Men don't.  When the weather is inclement, men wear cotton in
their ears -- some little fancy article like that -- further than this they have no inclination towards
gorgeousness of costume.  In ancient times the King was ruler of all the land, and supreme head
of the church and State; his voice was superior to all law; he was absolute; his power was sacred.
After the King in authority came the high priests of the ancient superstition, and after them the
great chiefs, little better than slaves to the King.  Next came the common plebians, and they were
slaves to the whole party, were abused and killed at the slightest pretext.  And below them, away
down at the bottom of this pile of tyranny and superstition, came the women, and they were the
abject slaves of all; they were degraded to the level of the beasts, and thought to be no better.
They were cruelly maltreated.  By the law of the land it was death for a woman to eat at table
with her husband, or to eat out of the same dish with him.  Even those darkened people seemed to
have a glimmering idea of the danger of women eating forbidden fruit, and they didn't want to
take the risk.</p>

<p>Now the Sandwich Islanders are the best educated of any people on the earth.  And all this
wonderful work was accomplishedby our American missionaries.  And what is curious further,
this great work was paid for in great part by the American Sunday School children with their
pennies.  Though it is beyond all doubt that many a bad little boy has reaped a lucrative income,
by confiscating the pennies given him for missionary contributions.  It is the proudest reflection of
my life that I hever did that -- never did it more than once or twice, anyhow.</p>

<p>These natives are an exceedingly hospitable people, if I haven't lost my place.  If you want to
stay two or three days and nights in a native cabin you will be welcome.  They will feast you on
raw fish, with the scales on, cocoanuts, plantains, baked dogs and fricasseed cats, all the luxuries
of the season.  But if you want to trade with one of them, that's business.  He will tell one
falsehood after another, right straight along, and not ordinary lies either, but monstrous incredible
ones; and when a native is caught in a lie it doesn't discommode him at all.  All these natives have
a dozen mothers at least, not natural mothers, but adopted ones.  They are very fond of dogs,
these people; not the great Newfoundland or the stately mastiff, but a species of little mean,
contemptible cur, that a white man would condemn to death on general principles.  There is
nothing attractive about those dogs, there is not a handsome feature about them, unless it is their
bushy tails.  A friend of mine said if he had one of those dogs he would cut off its tail and throw
the rest of the dog away.  They feed this dog, pet him, take ever so much care of him, and then
cook and eat him.  I couldn't do that.  I would rather go hungry for two days than devour an old
personal friend in that way.</p>

<p>The ladies of the Sandwich Islands have a great many pleasant customs which I don't know
but we might practice with profit here.  You never see two of those ladies rush together and kiss
each other and then go away and talk about each other behind their backs.  I don't suppose our
ladies do it, but they might.  But I believe I am getting on dangerous ground.  I won't pursue that
any further.</p>

<p>The climate of these Islands is delightful, it is beautiful.  In Honolulu the thermometer stands
at about 80 or 82 degrees pretty much all the year round -- don't change more than 12 degrees in
twelve months.  In the sugar districts the thermometer stands at 70 and does not change at all.
Any kind of thermometer will do -- one without any quicksilver is just as good.  The climate is
very healthy.  A man told me it was so hot in New York a little while ago that <i>gold</i> went
up to 160 in the shade.</p>

<p>There are about three thousand white people in the islands; they are mostly Americans.  In
fact they are the kings of the Sandwich Islands, the monarchy is not much more than a mere name.
These people stand as high in the scale of character as any people in the world, and some of them
who were born and educated in those islands don't even know what vice is.</p>

<p>George Vandenhoff, Esq., is to read before the Lyceum, on Wednesday evening of next
week.</p>
