Tom Sawyer was a boy, not one of the sort that you read about in
good books, but a
little devil, never malicious and always at some trick, and in the
course of years he
engaged in a multitude, all of which are here recorded in Twain's
style.  He had
special aversions for church, Sunday school, pious people, devout
conversation and
the company of his sedate but good old aunt.  In spite of his
efforts to escape from
such inflictions he had to suffer them once in a while, but in his
efforts to get some
diversion on such occasions he more than once made lively
sensations.  Too lazy to
get his Sunday school lessons, he managed by sharp trading to buy
up a lot of the
tickets given to the best pupils, and when a distinguished visitor
came the children
were requested to step forward with their tickets so that the one
who had the most
should receive the prize.  To the astonishment of all Tom Sawyer
was the hero, and,
after a great time had been made over him, the visitor thought Tom
should have a
chance to show his learning, so he asked him who were the first two
of the twelve
Apostles to follow Jesus, it being presumed that the prize boy knew
such things
perfectly, for the lesson of the term had been in the study of the
four Gospels.  Tom
felt the necessity of giving some answer, and his was "David and
Goliath," to the
surprise of the visitor, the consternation of the head teacher and
the amusement of the
school.  When Tom went to church he took a large snapping bug
(which has a grip
like a crab) with him, and it got hold of a church-going dog, which
rushed around the
building and howled in a manner highly unbecoming to the place.
When he was sick
his aunt gave him pain-killer, and when she went out he gave a dose
to the cat, which
squawled, rushed around like mad, upsetting everything, and then
jumped through
the window, breaking a pane of glass in the way.  Aunt Polly
hearing the disturbance
and finding the cause, scolded Tom for being so cruel to the cat,
but Tom said she
had compelled him to take pain-killer when he protested, and he had
not given it to
pussy till she came and begged for a taste when she saw him pour it
into a spoon.  He
went to school, and got into trouble on account of a little
girl--both about ten years
old.  Having read about the romantic life of pirates, Tom and two
companions of the
same age stole a little raft, on which they floated a few miles on
the Mississippi to
a small uninhabited island, where they remained three days, while
their relatives
mourned their supposed death by drowning, and when they were
discovered and
brought back  there was great rejoicing, and Tom was looked at by
other little boys
as a wonderful hero, and he put on awful airs on account of the
sensation he made.
What we have told here is merely part of the outline of the story;
the chief merit is
in the filling in, which is full of humorous and acute delineation
of the follies,
superstitions and peculiarities of boys, girls and older people.

<p>The name of Mark Twain is known throughout the length
and breadth of England. Wherever there is a railway-station with
a bookstall his jokes are household words. Those whose usual
range in literature does not extend beyond the sporting
newspapers, the <i>Racing Calendar, </i>and the "Diseases of
Dogs," have allowed him a place with Artemus Ward alongside
of the handful of books which forms their library. For ourselves,
we cannot dissociate him from the railway-station, and his jokes
always rise in our mind with a background of Brown & Polson's
Corn Flour and Taylor's system of removing furniture. We have
read <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer </i>with different
surroundings, and still have been made to laugh; and that ought
to be taken as high praise. Indeed, the earlier part of the book
is,
to our thinking, the most amusing thing Mark Twain has written.
The humour is not always uproarious, but it is always genuine
and sometimes almost pathetic, and it is only now and then that
the heartiness of a laugh is spoilt by one of those pieces of
self-consciousness which are such common blots on Mark
Twain's other books. <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> is
an attempt in a new direction. It is consecutive, and much longer
than the former books, and as it is not put forward as a mere
collection of <i>Screamers, </i>we laugh more easily, and find
some relief in being able to relax the conventional grin expected
from the reader of the little volumes of railway humour. The
present book is not, and does not pretend to be a novel, in the
ordinary sense of the word; it is not even a story, for that
presupposes a climax and a finish; nor is it a mere boys' book of
adventures. In the Preface the author says, "Although my book
is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls, I hope
it will not be shunned by men and women on that account, for
part of my plan has been to try pleasantly to remind adults of
what they once were themselves, and of how they felt and
thought and talked, and what queer enterprises they sometimes
engaged in." Questions of intention are always difficult to
decide. The book will amuse grown-up people in the way that
humorous books written for children have amused before, but
(perhaps fortunately) it does not seem to us calculated to carry
out the intention here expressed. With regard to the style, of
course there are plenty of slang words and racy expressions,
which are quite in place in the conversations, but it is just a
question whether it would not have been as well if the remainder
of the book had not been written more uniformly in English.

Mr. Aldrich has studied the life of A Bad Boy as the pleasant
reprobate led it in a quiet old New England town twenty-five or
thirty years ago, where in spite of the natural outlawry of
boyhood he was more or less part of a settled order of things,
and was hemmed in, to some measure, by the traditions of an
established civilization. Mr. Clemens, on the contrary, has taken
the boy of the Southwest for the hero of his new book, and has
presented him with a fidelity to circumstance which loses no
charm by being realistic in the highest degree, and which gives
incomparably the best picture of life in that region as yet known
to fiction. The town where Tom Sawyer was born and brought
up is some such idle, shabby little Mississippi River town as Mr.
Clemens has so well described in his piloting reminiscences, but
Tom belongs to the better sort of people in it, and has been bred
to fear God and dread the Sunday-school according to the
strictest rite of the faiths that have characterized all the
respectability of the West. His subjection in these respects does
not so deeply affect his inherent tendencies but that he makes
himself a beloved burden to the poor, tender-hearted old aunt
who brings him up with his orphan brother and sister, and
struggles vainly with his manifold sins, actual and imaginary.
The limitations of his transgressions are nicely and artistically
traced. He is mischievous, but not vicious; he is ready for almost
any depredation that involves the danger and honor of
adventure, but profanity he knows may provoke a thunderbolt
upon the heart of the blasphemer, and he almost never swears;
he resorts to any stratagem to keep out of school, but he is not
a downright liar, except upon terms of after shame and remorse
that make his falsehood bitter to him. He is cruel, as all children
are, but chiefly because he is ignorant; he is not mean, but there
are very definite bounds to his generosity; and his courage is the
Indian sort, full of prudence and mindful of retreat as one of the
conditions of prolonged hostilities. In a word, he is a boy, and
merely and exactly an ordinary boy on the moral side. What
makes him delightful to the reader is that on the imaginative
side he is very much more, and though every boy has wild and
fantastic dreams, this boy cannot rest till he has somehow
realized them. Till he has actually run off with two other boys
in the character of buccaneer, and lived for a week on an island
in the Mississippi, he has lived in vain; and this passage is but
the prelude to more thrilling adventures, in which he finds
hidden treasures, traces the bandits to their cave, and is himself
lost in its recesses. The local material and the incidents with
which his career is worked up are excellent, and throughout
there is scrupulous regard for the boy's point of view in
reference to his surroundings and himself, which shows how
rapidly Mr. Clemens has grown as an artist. We do not
remember anything in which this propriety is violated, and its
preservation adds immensely to the grown-up reader's
satisfaction in the amusing and exciting story. There is a boy's
love-affair, but it is never treated otherwise than as a boy's
love-affair. When the half-breed has murdered the young doctor,
Tom and his friend, Huckleberry Finn, are really, in their boyish
terror and superstition, going to let the poor old town-drunkard
be hanged for the crime, till the terror of that becomes
unendurable. The story is a wonderful study of the boy-mind,
which inhabits a world quite distinct from that in which he is
bodily present with his elders, and in this lies its great charm
and its universality, for boy-nature, however human nature
varies, is the same everywhere.
</p><p>
The tale is very dramatically wrought, and the subordinate
characters are treated with the same graphic force that sets Tom
alive before us. The worthless vagabond, Huck Finn, is entirely
delightful throughout, and in his promised reform his identity is
respected: he will lead a decent life in order that he may one day
be thought worthy to become a member of that gang of robbers
which Tom is to organize. Tom's aunt is excellent, with her kind
heart's sorrow and secret pride in Tom; and so is his sister Mary,
one of those good girls who are born to usefulness and charity
and forbearance and unvarying rectitude. Many village people
and local notables are introduced in well-conceived character;
the whole little town lives in the reader's sense, with its
religiousness, its lawlessness, its droll social distinctions, its
civilization qualified by its slave-holding, and its traditions of
the wilder West which has passed away. The picture will be
instructive to those who have fancied the whole Southwest a
sort of vast Pike County, and have not conceived of a sober and
serious and orderly contrast to the sort of life that has come to
represent the Southwest in literature. Mr. William M. Baker
gives a notion of this in his stories, and Mr. Clemens has again
enforced the fact here, in a book full of entertaining character,
and of the greatest artistic sincerity.
</p><p>
Tom Brown and Tom Bailey are, among boys in books, alone
deserving to be named with Tom Sawyer.

<p>Tom Sawyer is a bit of a scamp, a kind of juvenile Gil Blas, an
<i>enfant
terrible</i>, a schoolboy full of practical jokes and solemn
impositions, who wins
a Sunday-school Bible by buying tickets, and proves his assiduous
study by the
astounding answer to the question, "Who were the first two
apostles?"  "David and
Goliath."  He absconds from school, and with a village
ne'er-do-well sets up for a
pirate on an island in the river, then steals home at night to
listen to his old aunt
weeping over him as drowned, and is furtively present on Sunday to
hear his funeral
sermon preached.  In one of his escapades he is witness of a
midnight murder--gets
lost in a cave on the Mississippi, finds the murderer and his
treasure, and ends his
schoolboy days by being a hero.  The book is full of roaring fun,
interspersed with
touches of true pathos.  It will have the effect of making boys
think that an
unscrupulous scapegrace is sure to turn out a noble man; it might
therefore have
given more emphasis to truth and straightforwardness.  But it is
irresistible; fully up
to the mark of the "Innocents Abroad."

<p>
Mark Twain's <i>Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> was published in
England last
June, and immediately many of the most easily detached and quotable
portions of it
found their way into the American press, and a wide circulation.
The COURANT
printed at the time two or three extracts from the book--Tom's
adventure with the
beetle in church, a most delightful study as well as a piece of
profound philosophy,
and the whitewashing of the fence, a bit of genuine fun with an
artistic finish that
would give the author a deserved reputation if he had never written
anything else.
The volume has just been brought out here in a very handsome style,
copiously
illustrated with drawings by Mr. J. W. Williams, who has happily
entered into the
spirit of the book, and produced excellent and on the whole the
best set of character
sketches we have ever seen from his pencil.  The engravings do not
all do justice to
the original drawings, but they are more than fair, and as the text
is beautifully
printed on broad pages, the whole effect is very pleasing, and the
volume is attractive
at the first glance.
</p><p><i>Tom Sawyer</i> is in some respects an advance on anything
that Mr.
Clemens has before done--an advance we mean as a piece of literary
work, careful
in finish, and thought out more maturely.  It has not the large,
original force of the
uncontrollable, spontaneous humor that in "The Innocents Abroad"
carried an
irrepressible burst of merriment round the globe, from San
Francisco to India by way
of Europe, but it has passages as exquisitely humorous as any in
that book, and as a
general thing it is more finely wrought.  The passages we have
spoken of above
amply sustain this assertion; you can read them again and again
with new delight, and
indeed, we find it difficult not to read them every time we take up
the book.  They
could not have been written without the spark of genius.  We find
in this book, too,
the author's style, not more virile and sparklingly clear than
formerly, but more
carefully finished; and the author has toned down a little those
excursions into the
impossible, which are intensely amusing, but do not commend
themselves to the
judgment on a second reading.  And in doing this he has lost
nothing of his
extraordinarily forceful use of the English language.  There is no
one writing today
who has a finer intuitive sense of the right word in the right
place.
</p><p>The book is all about boys, and it is said to be written for
boys.  It is a
masterly reproduction of boy's life and feeling, but, at the same
time, it is written
above boys: that is, the best part of it--the wit, the humor, the
genius of it will fly
miles above every boy's head in the country.  The boys can
appreciate the adventure
in it as a mere narrative, but not that which makes the adventure
valuable to older
readers, who recall their own boyhood in it.  The boy has not the
least sense of
humor; that is nothing funny to him in having his pocket in measure
of useless trash;
the tricks he plays upon his comrades are not amusing to him; he is
a non-humorous,
dead, in earnest creature, and it is this characteristic that makes
him amusing to us
(to himself in retrospect); but his serious life does not take in
what we call humor.
It is for this reason that we say that Tom Sawyer will be enjoyed
most by mature
readers, who will have a great delight in seeing how faithfully boy
life is recalled.
</p><p>Boy nature is the same everywhere, and the characteristics
here given are of
universal acceptance; but local coloring (as it is now called) is
different, and the boys
of this book are of Missouri and not of New England in a good many
of their ways;
and so they ought to be, being studies from life.  We should not
counsel New
England boys to expect or to imitate some of the adventures in this
book, but they
doubtless are true enough to the society they sketch.  The Missouri
boy who has
mighty stirrings in his soul and feels deeply the desperate
injustice of his tender
home, may want to go away and be a noble river pirate, just as the
New England boy
is sometimes moved to run away to sea.  But neither of them we
fancy ever finds or
makes a pot of money by any sudden streak of luck.
</p><p>We do not believe that Tom Sawyer or his comrades have the
least idea how
bright a boy he is, or what exceedingly funny things he says; he is
as bright as Mark
Twain himself.  And probably no boy will appreciate the deep fun
and satire of the
following passage.  In a midnight adventure of Tom and his
companion, Huckleberry,
the boys think they are lost and fall into a panic.  Huckleberry
<a name="7">whispers:--</a>
<lb><lb>
<xref doc="http:/etext.virginia.edu/railton/tomsawye/tomrevlink7.html">[LINK TS7]</xref>
<lb>
</p><p>The Sunday-school chapter, in which Tom's financial
abilities come out
strong, and he trades himself into the possession of the first
prize, and in which he
exhibits his Biblical knowledge, is saturated with the keenest
humor; but a boy will
hardly comprehend the fine observation and deep satirical humor of
the scene.  It is
prize day and company is present.  On the platform is the great
Judge Thatcher, the
county judge, and it is an important hour for Mr. Walters, the
superintendent, and for
the whole school.  It was an impressive silence when Jeff Thatcher,
the brother of the
judge, observed by "ranks of staring eyes," went forward to be
familiar with the great
man and be envied by the <a name="8">school:--</a>

<lb>
</p><p>Tom is a genuine boy and his Aunt Polly is a genuine woman;
both are
capitally drawn; and the author has given to both some noble traits
and elements of
pathos which make them remain our friends long after the laughter
they excite has
ceased.  The book is full of quotable things, scenes as amusing as
anything Mr.
Clemens has written, with now and then a stroke of good humored
satire that is as
well deserved as it is artistically administered--take the school
examination and
exhibition as a specimen; the remarks on the "compositions" of the
young ladies
might well be framed and hung up in every school room.  But it is
unnecessary to
quote from a book which everybody will read.

<p>The American Publishing company of this city have just issued
Mark Twain's
book, "Tom Sawyer."  It is a beautiful book, both outside and in,
as one might
naturally expect to find it on seeing the imprint of this
publishing house upon it--a
house that has established a well-earned reputation in the book
publishing lines.  The
illustrations in the book are of a merit beyond praise.  They are
of the eloquent kind
that speak for themselves, as well as for the print they
illustrate.  Those who imagine
this to be a tame story for little boys will discover their mistake
on reading it.  It is
safe to predict that no one will read the first page without
reading all the rest.  There
is a power of attraction about it that doesn't "let up," but grows
stronger to the end.
Though claiming to be a book for boys and girls it will not be
monopolized by them.
There's rich entertainment in it for both young and old.  The
author says most of the
adventures recorded in it really occurred, and that one or two of
them were his own.
Perhaps his well-known modesty forbids his claiming any larger
proportion.  The
story dates back some forty years ago, in one of the southwestern
slave states.  The
hero, Tom Sawyer, is a unique individual, to state it mildly.  The
author says he
belongs to the composite order of architecture.  Perhaps that is as
good a description
of him as can be given in brief.  He isn't one of the orthodox boys
who love their
Sunday schools, and love to read about the good little boys who die
early and go to
heaven.  He evidently preferred the other place where they don't
have any Sunday
schools, and the boys don't have to keep quiet every seventh day in
the week.  He
doesn't believe in early deaths, nor early piety.  Tom is a
reckless, daredevil fellow,
ready to hazard life for an adventure any time; but under the
rollicking air of the book
there appears an occasional bit of philosophy in the peculiarly
dry, sarcastic vein of
the author, as this, for <a name="3">instance</a>:

During the sermon that followed--a sermon that thinned the elect
down to a company
so small as to be "hardly worth the saving"--Tom had further
interesting adventures
which helped to give variety and keep awake "other people
uninterested in the
sermon" as well as himself.
</p><p>The account, some chapters further along, of the village
school graduating
exercises, and the prize poems and compositions of the young
ladies, is racy and rich,
but not in the least exaggerated.  Its beauty consists in its truth
to life.  The slim,
melancholy girl, with a cast of countenance "that comes of pills
and indigestion,"
who reads a poem as indigestible as her ordinary diet, is to be
found in any average
school of the present day, as can likewise be found her bilious
companion who reads
a composition which "wound up with a sermon so destructive of all
hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the first prize."
</p><p>Perhaps the most pointed paragraph in the book is the
following in relation
to a petition for pardon for a <a name="6">murderer</a>:

If there is any defect in the book it is in the love scenes, where
a boy of Tom Sawyer's
size wanders off to be an outlaw.  This part is a little overdrawn.
But the whole story
is so exquisitely told that the book will be widely sought.  It is
a capital gift for the
holidays.

This newest work of Mark Twain increases the difficulty of
assigning that author a literary <i>habitat. </i>"American
humorist" has for some time been recognised as too vague a
label to attach to a writer whose "Jumping Frog" and other early
sketches have been reduced to mere fragments and ventures by
such productions as <i>The Innocents Abroad  </i>and <i>The
New Pilgrim's Progress, </i>in which, while the humour is still
fresh, there is present an equal art in graphic description of
natural scenery,  and a fine sense of what is genuinely
impressive in the grandeurs of the past. Those who have
travelled with Mark Twain with some curiosity to observe the
effect of the ancient world interpreted by a very shrewd eye,
fresh from the newest outcome of civilisation, may have
expected to find antiquity turned into a solemn joke, but they
can hardly have failed to discover a fine discrimination present
at each step in the path of the "new pilgrim"; while he sheds
tears of a kind hardly relished by the  superstitious or
sentimental over the supposed grave of his deceased parent
Adam, he can "listen deep" when any true theme from the
buried world reaches his ear. Without being pathetic he is
sympathetic, and there is also an innate refinement in his genius
felt in every subject it selects and in his treatment of it. <i>Tom
Sawyer </i>carries us to an altogether novel region, and along
with these characteristics displays a somewhat puzzling variety
of abilities. There is something almost stately in the simplicity
with which he invites us to turn our attention to the affairs of
some boys and girls growing up on the far frontiers of American
civilisation. With the Eastern Question upon us, and crowned
heads arrayed on the political stage, it may be with some
surprise that we find our interest demanded in sundry Western
questions that are solving themselves through a <i>dramatis
personae </i>of humble folk whose complications occur in a St.
Petersburg situated on the Missouri river. Our manager, we feel
quite sure, would not for a moment allow us to consider that any
other St. Petersburg is of equal importance to that for which he
claims our attention. What is the deposition, death, or
enthronement of a Sultan compared with the tragical death of
"Injun Joe," the murderer, accidentally buried and entombed in
the cavern where his stolen treasures are hid? There he was
<a name="a">found. </a>

In such writing as this we seem to be reading some classic
fable, such as the Persian Sadi might point with his moral, "Set
not your heart on things that are transitory; the Tigris will run
through Bagdat after the race of Caliphs is extinct." Nor is this
feeling of the dignity of his subject absent when the author is
describing the most amusing incidents.  Indeed, a great deal of
Mark Twain's humour consists in the serious -- or even
at times severe -- style in which he narrates his stories
and portrays his scenes, as one who feels that the universal laws
are playing through the very slightest of them. The following is
a scene in  which the principal actors are a dog, a boy, and a
beetle, the place being the <a name="b">chapel:</a> --

some others in the volume, but it indicates very well the kind of
art in which Mark Twain is pre-eminent in our time. Every
movement of boy, beetle, and poodle, is described not merely
with precision, but with a subtle sense of meaning in every
movement. Everything is alive, and every face physiognomical.
From a novel so replete with good things, and one so full of
significance, as it brings before us what we can feel is the real
spirit of home life in the far West, there is no possibility of
obtaining extracts which will convey to the reader any idea of
the purport of the book. The scenes and characters cannot be
really seen apart from their grouping and environment. The
book will no doubt be a great favourite with boys, for whom it
must in good part have been intended; but next to boys we
should say that it might be most prized by philosophers and
poets. The interior life, the everyday experiences, of a small
village on the confines of civilisation and in the direction of its
advance, may appear, antecedently, to supply but thin material
for a romance; but still it is at just that same little pioneer
point
that humanity is growing with the greatest freedom, and
unfolding some of its unprescribed tendencies. We can, indeed,
hardly imagine a more felicitous task for a man of genius to
have accomplished than to have seized the salient, picturesque,
droll, and at the same time most significant features of human
life, as he has himself lived it and witnessed it, in a region
where it is continually modified in relation to new
circumstances. The chief fault of the story is its brevity, and it
will, we doubt not, be widely and thoroughly enjoyed by young
and old for its fun and its philosophy.

Mark Twain belongs to a somewhat different school of writers
from Miss Yonge, and <i>Tom Sawyer </i>is a characteristic
production of his genius. We  recognize the germ of it in the
stories of the good and bad little boys,  which went some way
towards making their author's popularity.  <i>Tom Sawyer,
</i>as we are told in the Preface, is intended primarily for the
amusement of children, but it is hoped that "it will not be
shunned by men  and women on that account, for part of my
plan has been to try  pleasantly to remind adults of what they
once were themselves." How far Master Sawyer's eccentric
experiences may come home in that way to American citizens
we cannot pretend to say. To our English notions, Tom appears
to have been a portentous phenomenon, and his eventful career
exhibits an unprecedented precocity. His conceptions were as
romantic as their execution was audacious. Holding all
sedentary occupations in aversion, his cast of thought was as
original as his quaint felicity of picturesque expression. We are
very sure there are no such boys in this country, and even in the
States it may be supposed that the breed has been dying out, for
fully more than a generation has gone by since Tom was the
glory and plague of his native village on the Mississippi. His
remarkable talent for mischief would have made him an
intolerable thorn in the flesh of the aunt who acted as a mother
to him had it not been that his pranks and misconduct endeared
him to that much-enduring woman. "Cuteness" is scarcely the
word for Tom's ingrained artfulness. Take, by way of example,
one of his earliest achievements. He is caught by his aunt in
some flagrant delict, and condemned to whitewash the fence
that runs in front of her cottage.  Tom had planned to make one
of a swimming party, and, what is more, he  knows that he will
be jeered by his playmates, and contempt is  intolerable to his
soaring spirit. So, when he sees Ben Rogers, whose satire he
stands most in dread of, come puffing along the  road,
personating a high-pressure steamer, Tom buckles himself to his
task with a will. He is so absorbed, in fact, in artistic
enthusiasm
that Ben's ribald mockery falls on unheeding ears, and Tom has
actually to be twitched by the jacket before he turns to recognize
his friend. Ere long Ben, who was bound for the river, is
begging and praying to be permitted to have a turn with the
brush. Tom is slow to be persuaded; had it been the back fence
it might have been different, but his aunt is awful particular
about this front one --
</p><p>
"Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly -- well, Jim
wanted to do it,  but she wouldn't let him. Sid wanted to do it,
but she wouldn't let Sid.  Now, don't you see how I'm fixed? If
you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it."
</p><p>
The result is that Tom, as an immense favour, trades the
privilege of a few minutes' painting for an apple. Each of the
other boys, as he comes up in Ben's wake, makes a similar deal
on his own account. Tom amasses a wealth of miscellaneous
treasure, which he subsequently barters for a sufficiency of
tickets of merit at the Sunday school to entitle him to walk off
with the honours for which meritorious children have been
toiling;  while his aunt, to her intense surprise, finds her fence
covered with  several coatings of whitewash, and goes into
raptures over Tom's capacity for work on the rare occasions
when he chooses to apply himself.  But, though anything but a
bookish boy, Tom had paid considerable attention to literature
of an eccentric kind, and, indeed, his knowledge of men and
things was very much taken from his favourite authors. He runs
away with a couple of comrades to follow the calling of  pirates
on an island of the Mississippi, the grand inducement being
"that  you don't have to get up mornings, and you don't have to
go to school and wash and all that blame foolishness." After
some days, when the trio are bored and half-starved and rather
frightened, Tom plans a melo-dramatic return, and the missing
ones emerge from the disused gallery of the church and present
themselves to the congregation of weeping mourners, just as the
clergyman's moving eloquence is dwelling on the virtues of the
dear departed. Afterwards Tom, who "all along has been
wanting to be a robber," but has never been able to find the
indispensable cave, stumbles on the very thing to suit him. So
he  carries off a devoted follower who has been hardened for an
outlaw's life by the habit of living on scraps and sleeping in
empty hogsheads -- Republican freedom from class
prejudices seems to have been a marked feature among the boys
of the Transatlantic St. Petersburg. He teaches Huck his duties
as they are flying from the society of their kind out of the
accumulated stores of his own erudition. "Who'll we rob?" asks
Huck. "Oh, most anybody  -- waylay people; that's mostly
the way."  "And kill them?"  "No, not always. Hide them in the
cave till they can raise a ransom. You make them raise all they
can off o' their friends, and after you've kept them a year, if it
ain't raised, then you kill them. That's the general way. Only you
don't kill the women; you shut up the women, but you don't kill
them. They're always beautiful and rich and awfully scared. You
take their watches and things, but you always take off your hat
and talk polite. There ain't everybody as polite as robbers; you'll
see that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you; and
after they've been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop
crying, and after that you couldn't get them to leave. If you
drove them out they'd turn right round and come back. It's so in
all the books.' In the course of their researches in the cavern
they come on what Tom pronounces "an awful snug place for
orgies." "What's orgies?" inquires Huck. "I dunno," says Tom
very frankly; "but robbers always have orgies, and of course
we've got to have them too."
</p><p>
We fear these elegant extracts give but a faint idea of the
drollery in which the book abounds; for the fact is that the best
part of the fun lies in the ludicrous individuality of Tom
himself, with whom we have been gradually growing familiar.
But we should say that a perusal of <i>Tom Sawyer</i> is as
fair a test as one could suggest of anybody's appreciation of the
humorous. The drollery is often grotesque and extravagant, and
there is at least as much in the queer Americanizing of the
language as in the ideas it expresses. Practical people who pride
themselves on strong common sense will have no patience with
such vulgar trifling. But those who are alive to the pleasure of
relaxing from serious thought and grave occupation will catch
themselves smiling over every page and exploding outright over
some of the choicer passages.

"Mark Twain" has dropped the humorous exaggerations of his "Jumping
Frog" and
"Innocents Abroad" in his fresh and racy story of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>
(Chatto and
Windus).  "Although," writes this popular American humorist in his
preface, "my
book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls, I
hope it will not be
shunned by men and women on that account; for part of my plan has
been to try to
write pleasantly, to remind adults of what they once were
themselves, and of how
they felt and thought and talked, and what queer enterprises they
sometimes engaged
in."  So very human is "Tom Sawyer" in its faithful delineation of
boy-life that it
cannot fail to realize the hope of "Mark Twain," and amuse everyone
who in the
words of the song, "would" he "were a boy again."  All the love of
mischief, hopes
and fears, joys and sorrows, foolhardy pranks and acts of bravery
that make Tom
Sawyer stand out as a veritable portrait from the life are set down
by Mr. Clemens
with unfailing fidelity to nature; and that element of adventure so
dear to boys is
supplied in a manner to satisfy the appetite for the strangest
sensational fare.  It is the
faithful portrayal of boy-life, however--not the midnight murder in
a churchyard of
which Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn are eye-witnesses, nor the piratical
venture of
Tom and his mates, nor even the wanderings of Tom and his
sweetheart whilst lost
in the cave--that makes "Mark Twain's" last volume so welcome, and
that will,
doubtless, win for him even a wider circle of readers that he has
at present.

We have already alluded to Mark Twain's new book, "The Adventures
of Tom
Sawyer."  The work has just been published, and is a most capital
subject for a
holiday gift.  Like all of its author's works, it overflows with
rare and quaint humor;
and, in addition to its attractive subject-matter, it has the
advantage of being bound
very handsomely, printed on heavy tinted paper, and beautified with
150 illustrations,
and is to be obtained at a far lower price than Twain's other
works.  It contains about
300 pages.  The lady agent for this city may be found at 88 Court
Street, where any
subscriber omitted by her may obtain the book.

Shades of the venerable Mr. Day, of the instructive Mrs.
Barbauld, of the persuasive Miss Edgeworth! Had you the
power of sitting today beside the reviewer's desk, and were
called upon to pass judgment on the books written and printed
for the boys and girls of today, would you not have groaned and
moaned over their perusal? If such superlatively good children
as Harry and Lucy could have existed, or even such nondescript
prigs as Sandford and Merton had abnormal being, this other
question presents itself to our mind: "How would these precious
children have enjoyed Mark Twain's <i>Tom Sawyer</i>"?  In
all books written for the amusement of children there are two
distinct phases of appreciation. What the parent thinks of the
book is one thing; what the child thinks of it is another. It is
fortunate when both parent and child agree in their conclusions.
Such double appreciation may, in most instances, simply be one
in regard to the fitness of the book on the part of the parent. A
course of reading entirely devoted to juvenile works must be to
an adult a tax on time and patience. It is only once in many
years that such a charming book as <i>Little Alice in
Wonderland</i> is produced, which old and young could read
with thorough enjoyment.  If, thirty  years ago, <i>Tom Sawyer
</i>had been placed in a careful father's hands to read, the
probabilities would have been that he would have hesitated
before giving the book to his boy &ndash; not that Mr. Clemens'
book is exceptional in character, or differs in the least, save in
its cleverness, from a host of similar books on like topics which
are universally read by children today. It is the judgment of the
book-givers which has undoubtedly undergone a change, while
youthful minds, being free from warp, twist, or dogma, have
remained ever the same.
</p><p>Returning then to these purely intellectual
monstrosities, mostly the pen-and-ink offspring of authors and
authoresses who never had any real flesh and blood creations of
their own, there can be no doubt that had Sandford or Merton
ever for a single moment dipped inside of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>'s
pages, astronomy and physics, with all the musty old farrago of
Greek and Latin history, would have been thrown to the dogs.
Despite tasseled caps, starched collars, and all the proprieties,
these children would have laughed uproariously over Tom
Sawyer's "cat and the pain-killer," and certain new ideas might
have had birth in their brains. Perhaps had these children
actually lived in our times, Sandford might have been a Western
steam-boat captain, or Merton a fillibuster. <i>Tom Sawyer</i>
is likely to inculcate the idea that there are certain lofty
aspirations which Plutarch never ascribed to his more prosaic
heroes. Books for children in former bygone periods were
mostly constructed in one monotonous key. A child was
supposed to be a vessel which was to be constantly filled up.
Facts and morals had to be taken like bitter draughts or acrid
pills. In order that they should be absorbed like medicines it was
perhaps a kindly thinker who disguised these facts and morals.
The real education swallowed in those doses by the children we
are inclined to think was in small proportion to the quantity
administered. Was it not good old Peter Parley who in this
country first broke loose from conventional trammels, and made
American children truly happy? We have certainly gone far
beyond Mr. Goodrich's manner. There has come an amount of
ugly realism into children's story-books, the advantages of
which we are very much in doubt about.
</p><p>
Now, it is perfectly true that many boys do not adopt drawing-room
manners. Perhaps it is better that little paragons &ndash;
pocket Crichtons &ndash; are so rare. Still, courage, frankness,
truthfulness, and self-reliance are to be inculcated in our lads.
Since association is everything, it is not desirable that in real
life
we should familiarize our children with those of their age who
are lawless or dare-devils. Granting that the natural is the true,
and the true is the best, and that we may describe things as they
are for adult readers, it is proper that we should discriminate a
great deal more as to the choice of subjects in books intended
for children. Today a majority of the heroes in such books have
longings to be pirates, want to run away with vessels, and
millions of our American boys read and delight in such stories.
ln olden times the <i>Pirate's Own Book </i>with its
death's-head and crossbones on the back had no concealment
about it. It is true, edition after edition was sold. There it was.
You saw it palpably. There was no disguise about it. If a father
or mother objected to their child's reading the <i>Pirate's Own
Book, </i>a pair of tongs and a convenient fireplace ended the
whole matter. Today the trouble is: that there is a decidedly
sanguinary tendency in juvenile books. No matter how innocent,
quiet, or tame may be the title of a child's book, there is no
guarantee that the volume your curlyhcaded little boy may be
devouring may not contain a series of adventures recalling Capt.
Kidd's horrors. In the short preface of <i>Tom Sawyer </i>Mr.
Clemens writes, "Although my book is intended mainly for the
entertainment of boys and girls, I hope it will not be shunned by
men and women on that account." We have before expressed
the idea that a truly clever child's book is one in which both the
man and the boy can find pleasure. No child's book can be
perfectly acceptable otherwise. Is <i>Tom Sawyer
</i>amusing? It is incomparably so. It is the story of a Western
boy, born and bred on the banks of one of the big rivers, and
there is exactly that wild village life which has schooled many
a man to self-reliance and energy. Mr. Clemens has a
remarkable memory for those peculiarities of American boy-talk
which the grown man may have forgotten, but which return to
him not unpleasantly when once the proper key is sounded.
There is one scene of a quarrel, with a dialogue, between Tom
and a city boy which is perfect of its kind. Certain chapters in
Tom's life, where his love for the schoolgirls is told, make us
believe that for an urchin who had just lost his milk-teeth the
affections out West have an awakening even earlier than in
Oriental climes. In fact, Tom is a preternaturally precocious
urchin. One admirable character in the book, and touched with
the hand of a master, is that of Huckleberry Finn. Thcre is a
reality about this boy which is striking. An honest old aunt, who
adores her scapegrace nephew, is a homely picture worked with
exceeding grace. Mr. Clemens must have had just such a
lovable old aunt. An ugly murder in the book, overminutely
described and too fully illustrated, which Tom and Huck see, of
course, in a graveyard, leads, somehow or other, to the
discovery of a cave, in which treasures are concealed, and to
which Tom and Huck fall heirs. There is no cant about Mr.
Clemens. A description of a Sunday-school in <i>Tom
Sawyer</i> is true to the letter. Matters are not told as they are
fancied to be, but as they actually are.
</p><p>
If Mr. Clemens has been wanting in continuity in his longer
sketches, and that sustained inventive power necessary in
dovetailing incidents, Tom, as a story, though slightly
disjointed, has this defect less apparent. As a humorist, Mr.
Clemens has a great deal of fun in him, of the true American
kind, which crops out all over thc book. Mr. Clemens has an
audience both here and in England, and doubtless his friends
across the water will re-echo "the hearty laughs which the
reading of <i>Tom Sawyer </i>will cause on this side of the
world."   We are rather inclined to treat books intended for boys
and girls, written by men of accredited talent and reputation, in
a serious manner. Early impressions are the lasting ones. It is
exactly such a clever book as <i>Tom Sawyer </i>which is sure
to leave its stamp on younger minds. We like, then, the true
boyish fun of Tom and Huck, and have a foible for the mischief
these children engage in. We have not the least objection that
rough boys be the heroes of a story-book. Restless spirits of
energy only require judicious training in order to bring them
into proper use. In the books to be placed into children's hands
for purposes of recreation, we have a preference for those of a
milder type than <i>Tom Sawyer. </i>Excitements derived
from reading should be administered with a certain degree of
circumspection. A sprinkling of salt in mental food is both
natural and wholesome; any cravings for the contents of the
castors, the cayenne and the mustard, by children, should not be
gratified. With less, then, of Injun Joe and "revenge," and
"slitting women's ears," and the shadow of the gallows, which
throws an unnecessarily sinister tinge over the story, (if the
book really is intended for boys and girls) we should have liked
<i>Tom Sawyer </i>better.

Our city of Hartford can boast the greatest humorist in current
literature.  Mr.
Clemens owes nothing to erratic spelling like "Artemas Ward," or to
exciting
political themes like some other witty writers.  He is altogether
original and unique.
"The Innocents Abroad," is an exhaustless feast vastly entertaining
and full of
information as a book of travels.   The same charm of genius in an
unusual direction
fills the fascinating pages of "Tom Sawyer."  The boy hero and the
other children are
so lifelike that the reader hardly needs the author's assurance
that real boys and
genuine parts are in the book.  One gets very fond of Tom
notwithstanding his grave
faults, some of which you almost wish had been omitted.  But he is
a brave, manly
boy after all, and the finest scene in the whole story to one
reader at least, is where
he receives a whipping to shield a little, terrified girl.  The
childish attachment
between these two and the manly protection Tom accords to little
Becky both at
school and amid the horrors of being lost in the cave, are very
finely described.  To
one who had only seen the other side of Tom's character these noble
traits would
have seemed impossible.  The "pain-killer" adventure is funny
beyond expression as
is much of Tom's career.  The last few chapters are extremely
sensational and strike
one as too remarkable to be natural adventures for little boys.
One cannot help
regretting that so fine a fellow as Tom lies and smokes, but the
intention was not to
describe a model boy.  Yet these traits solely detract from the
hero.  Those who
regard Mark Twain as only "a funny man," greatly underestimate his
power.  Wit is
the spice of his books not the substance.  In this story are some
most exquisitely
beautiful descriptions.  That of early morning in one place
particularly, is delicious
in its perfect picture of nature and its beautiful poetry.
