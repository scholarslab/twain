A very deplorable fact is that the great body of literary criticism
is mainly perfunctory. This is not due to a lack of ability or to
a lack of knowledge. It is due to the fact that most of it is from
the pens of newspaper writers who have no time to elaborate their
ideas. They are in a hurry, and what they write is hurried. Under
these circumstances it is not unnatural that they should take their
cues from inadequate sources and give to the public opinions that
are either conventional or that have no reasonable basis.
</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the conditions and circumstances of
American life. There is no demand for sound criticism any more than
there is a demand for great poetry. We have a leisure class, but
its tastes run towards horses, yachting and athletic sports, in
imitation of the English young men who occasionally honor these
shores with their presence. The imitation, after all, is a limping
one. The young Englishman of leisure is not only fond of outdoor
sports, but of books. He has culture and taste, and patronizes
literature with as much enthusiasm as he does physical amusements.
If our leisure class is to imitate the English, it would be better
if the imitation extended somewhat in the direction of culture.
</p>
<p>The American leisure class--the class that might be expected to
patronize good literature and to create a  demand for sound,
conservative criticism--is not only fond of horses, but is
decidedly horsey. It is coarse and uncultivated. It has no taste in
either literature or art. It reads few books and buys its pictures
in Europe by the yard.
</p>
<p>We are led to these remarks by the wholly inadequate verdict
that has recently been given in some of the most prominent
newspapers as to the merits of Mark Twain's new book, "The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn." The critics seem to have gotten
their cue in this instance from the action of the Concord library,
the directors of which refused the book a place on their shelves.
This action, as was afterwards explained, was based on the fact
that the book was a work of fiction, and not because of the
humorous characteristics that are popularly supposed to attach to
the writings of Mr. Clemens. But the critics had got their cue
before the explanation was made, and they straightway proceeded to
inform the reading public that the book was gratuitously coarse,
its humor unneccessarily broad, and its purpose crude and
inartistic.

</p><p>Now, nothing could be more misleading than such a criticism
as this. It is difficult to believe that the critics who have
condemned the book as coarse, vulgar and inartistic can have read
it. Taken in connection with "The Prince and the Pauper," it marks
a clear and distinct advance in Mr. Clemens's literary methods. It
presents an almost artistically perfect picture of the life and
character in the southwest, and it will be equally valuable to the
historian and to the student of sociology. Its humor, which is
genuine and never-failing, is relieved by little pathetic touches
here and there that vouch for its literary value.

</p><p>It is the story of a half illiterate, high-spirited boy
whose adventures are related by himself. The art with which this
conception is dealt with is perfect in all its details. The boy's
point of view is never for a moment lost sight of, and the moral of
the whole is that this half illiterate boy can be made to present,
with perfect consistency, not only the characters of the people
whom he meets, but an accurate picture of their social life. From
the artistic point of view, there is not a coarse nor vulgar
suggestion from the beginning to the end of the book. Whatever is
coarse and crude is in the life that is pictured, and the picture
is perfect. It may be said that the humor is sometimes excessive,
but it is genuine humor--and the moral of the book, though it is
not scrawled across every page, teaches the necessity of manliness
and self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>Mark Twain's "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" had a certain
relishable flavor when mixed up with the miscellaneous assortment
of magazine literature; but in a book form, and covering more than
350 pages, they are wearisome and labored. It would be about as
easy to read through a jest book, as to keep up one's interest in
the monotonous humor and the dialectic variations of  "Huck Finn's"
narrative. Here and there are spatches of Mark Twain's best work,
which could be read over and over again, and yet bring each time an
outburst of laugher; but one cannot have the book long in his hands
without being tempted to regret that the author should so often
have laid himself open to the charge of coarseness and bad taste.
The illustrations are admirable in their way. As to the general
character of the book, it may be sufficient to remind the reader of
the author's notice, that "all persons attempting to find a motive
in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a
moral in it will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in
it will be shot." </P>

<p>It is little wonder that Mr. Samuel Clemens, otherwise Mark
Twain, resorted to real or mock lawsuits, as may be, to restrain
some real or imaginary selling of "The Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn" as a means of advertising that extraordinarily senseless
publication. Before the work is disposed of, Mr. Mark Twain will
probably have to resort to law to compel some to sell it by any
sort of bribery or corruption. It is doubtful if the edition could
be disposed of to people of average intellect at anything short of
the point of the bayonet. This publication rejoices in two
frontispieces, of which the one is supposed to be a faithful
portrait of Huckleberry Finn, and the other an engraving of the
classic features of Mr. Mark Twain as seen in the bust made by Karl
Gerhardt. The taste of this gratuitous presentation is as bad as is
the book itself, which is an extreme statement. Mr. Clemens has
contributed some humorous literature that is excellent and will
hold its place, but his Huckleberry Finn appears to be singularly
flat, stale and unprofitable. The book is sold by subscription.

<p>In his latest story, <I> Huckleberry Finn </i> (Tom Sawyer's
Comrade), by Mark Twain, Mr. Clemens has made a very distinct
literary advance over Tom Sawyer, as an interpreter of human nature
and a contributor to our stock of original pictures of American
life. Still adhering to his plan of narrating the adventures of
boys, with a primeval and Robin Hood freshness, he has broadened
his canvas and given us a picture of a people, of a geographical
region, of a life that is new in the world. The scene of his
romance is the Mississippi river. Mr. Clemens has written of this
river before specifically, but he has not before presented it to
the imagination so distinctly nor so powerfully. Huck Finn's voyage
down the Mississippi with the run away nigger Jim, and with
occasionally other companions, is an adventure fascinating in
itself as any of the classic outlaw stories, but in order that the
reader may know what the author has done for him, let him notice
the impression left on his mind of this lawless, mysterious,
wonderful Mississippi, when he has closed the book. But it is not
alone the river that is indelibly impressed upon the mind, the life
that went up and down it and went on along its banks are projected
with extraordinary power. Incidentally, and with a true artistic
instinct, the villages, the cabins, the people of this river become
startlingly real. The beauty of this is that it is apparently done
without effort. Huck floating down the river happens to see these
things and to encounter the people and the characters that made the
river famous forty years ago--that is all. They do not have the air
of being invented, but of being found. And the dialects of the
people, white and black--what a study are they; and yet nobody
talks for the sake of exhibiting a dialect. It is not necessary to
believe the surprising adventures that Huck engages in, but no one
will have a moment's doubt of the reality of the country and the
people he meets.

<p></p>Another thing to be marked in the story is its dramatic
power. Take the story of the Southern Vendetta--a marvelous piece
of work in a purely literary point of view--and the episode of the
duke and the king, with its pictures of Mississippi communities,
both of which our readers probably saw in the <i>Century </i>
magazine. They are equaled in dramatic force by nothing recently in
literature.

<p></p>We are not in this notice telling the story or quoting from
a book that nearly everybody is sure to read, but it is proper to
say that Mr. Clemens strikes in a very amusing way certain
psychological problems. What, for instance, in the case of Huck,
the son of the town drunkard, perverted from the time of his birth,
is conscience, and how does it work? Most amusing is the struggle
Huck has with his conscience in regard to slavery. His conscience
tells him, the way it has been instructed, that to help the
runaway, nigger Jim to escape--to aid in stealing the property of
Miss Watson, who has never injured him, is an enormous offense that
will no doubt carry him to the bad place; but his affection for Jim
finally induces him to violate his conscience and risk eternal
punishment in helping Jim to escape. The whole study of Huck's
moral nature is as serious as it is amusing, his confusion of wrong
as right and his abnormal mendacity, traceable to his training from
infancy, is a singular contribution to the investigation of human
nature.

<p></p>These contradictions, however, do not interfere with the fun
of the story, which has all the comicality, all the odd way of
looking at life, all the whimsical turns of thought and expression
that have given the author his wide fame and made him <I> sui
generis. </i> The story is so interesting so full of life and
dramatic force, that the reader will be carried along irresistibly,
and the time he loses in laughing he will make up in diligence to
hurry along and find out how things come out.

<p></p>The book is a small quarto, handsomely printed and bound,
and illustrated by 174 drawings which enter fully into the spirit
of the book, and really help to set forth the characters.

For some time past Mr. Clemens has been carried away by the
ambition of seriousness and fine writing. In <i>Huckleberry
Finn</i>
he returns to his right mind, and is again the Mark Twain of old
time.
It is such a book as he, and he only, could have written. It is
meant for
boys; but there are few men (we should hope) who, once they take it
up, will not delight in it. It forms a companion or sequel, to
<i>Tom
Sawyer</i>. Huckleberry Finn, as everybody knows, is one of Tom's
closest friends; and the present volume is a record of the
adventures
which befell him soon after the event which made him a person of
property and brought Tom Sawyer's story to a becoming conclusion.
They are of the most surprising and delightful kind imaginable, and
in
the course of them we fall in with a number of types of character
of
singular freshness and novelty, besides being schooled in half a
dozen
extraordinary dialects -- the Pike County dialect in all its forms,
the
dialect of the Missouri negro, and 'the extremest form of the
backwoods South-Western dialect,' to wit. Huckleberry, it may be
noted, is stolen by his disreputable father, to escape from whom he
contrives an appearance of robbery and murder in the paternal hut,
goes off in a canoe, watches from afar the townsfolk hunting for
his
dead body, and encounters a runaway negro -- Miss Watson's Jim --
an old particular friend of Tom Sawyer and himself. With Jim he
goes
south down the river, and is the hero of such scrapes and
experiences
as make your mouth water (if you have ever been a boy) to read of
them. We do not purpose to tell a single one; it would be unfair to
author and reader alike. We shall content ourselves with repeating
that
the book is Mark Twain at his best, and remarking that Jim and
Huckleberry are real creations, and the worthy peers of the
illustrious
Tom Sawyer.

Mark Twain is a humorist or nothing. He is well aware of the fact
himself, for he prefaces the "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" with
a brief notice, warning persons in search of a moral, motive or
plot that they are liable to be prosecuted, banished or shot. This
is a nice little artifice to scare off the critics--a kind of
"trespassers on these grounds will be dealt with according to law."
</P>
</P><p>However, as there is no penalty attached, we organized a
search expedition for the humorous qualities of this book with the
following hilarious results:
</P><p>A very refined and delicate piece of narration by Huck Finn,
describin his venerable and dilapidated "pap" as afflicted with
delirium tremens, rolling over and over, "kicking things eveyr
which way," and "saying there are devils ahold of him." This
chapter is especially suited to amuse the children on long, rainy
afternoons.
</P><p>An elevating and laughable description of how Huck killed a
pig, smeared its blood on an axe and mixed in a little of his own
hair, and then ran off, setting up a job on the old man and the
community, and leading them to believe him murdered. This little
joke can be repeated by any smart boy for the amusement of his fond
parents.
</P><p>A graphic and romantic tale of a Southern family feud, which
resulted in an elopement and from six to eight choice corpses.
</P><p>A polite version of the "Giascutus" story, in which a nude
man, striped with the colors of the rainbow, is exhibited as "The
King's Camelopard; or, The Royal Nonesuch." This is a chapter for
lenten parlor entertainments and church festivals.
</P><p>A side-splitting account of a funeral, enlivened by a "sick
melodeun," a "long-legged undertaker," and  rat episode in the
cellar. </P>

<p>MARK TWAIN'S "Tom Sawyer" is an interesting record of boyish
adventure; but, amusing as it is, it may yet be fair to ask whether
its most marked fault is not too strong adherence to conventional
literary models? A glance at the book certainly does not confirm
this opinion, but those who recall the precocious affection of Tom
Sawyer, at the age when he is losing his first teeth, for a little
girl whom he has seen once or twice, will confess that the modern
novel exercises a very great influence. What is best in the book,
what one remembers, is the light we get into the boy's heart. The
romantic devotion to the little girl, the terrible adventures with
murderers and in huge caves, have the air of concessions to jaded
readers. But when Tom gives the cat Pain-Killer, is restless in
church, and is recklessly and eternally deceiving his aunt, we are
on firm ground--the author is doing sincere work.

</p><p>This later book, "Huckleberry Finn," has the great advantage
of being written in autobiographical form. This secures a unity in
the narration that is most valuable; every scene is given, not
described; and the result is a vivid picture of Western life forty
or fifty years ago. While "Tom Sawyer" is scarcely more than an
apparently fortuitous collection of incidents, and its thread is
one that has to do with murders, this story has a more intelligible
plot. Huckleberry, its immortal hero, runs away from his worthless
father, and floats down the Mississippi on a raft, in company with
Jim, a runaway negro. This plot gives great opportunity for varying
incidents. The travelers spend some time on an island; they outwit
every one they meet; they acquire full knowledge of the hideous
fringe of civilization that then adorned that valley; and the book
is a most valuable record of an important part of our motley
American civilization.

</p><p>What makes it valuable is the evident truthfulness of the
narrative, and where this is lacking and its place is taken by
ingenious invention, the book suffers. What is inimitable, however,
is the reflection of the whole varied series of adventures in the
mind of the young scapegrace of a hero. His undying fertility of
invention, his courage, his manliness in every trial, are an
incarnation of the better side of the ruffianism that is one result
of the independence of Americans, just as hypocrisy is one result
of the English respect for civilization. The total absence of
morbidness in the book--for the <i>mal du siecle </i> has not yet
reached Arkansas--gives it a genuine charm; and it is interesting
to notice the art with which this is brought out. The best instance
is perhaps to be found in the account of the feud between the
Shepherdsons and the Grangerfords, which is described only as it
would appear to a semi-civilized boy of fourteen, without the
slightest condemnation or surprise,--either of which would be bad
art,--and yet nothing more vivid can be imagined. That is the way
that a story is best told, by telling it, and letting it go to the
reader unaccompanied by sign-posts or directions how he shall
understand it and profit by it. Life teaches its lessons by
implication, not by didactic preaching; and literature is at its
best when it is an imitation of life and not an excuse for
instruction.

</p><p>As to the humor of Mark Twain, it is scarcely necessary to
speak. It lends vividness to every page. The little touch in "Tom
Sawyer," page 105, where after the murder of which  Tom was an
eye-witness, it seemed "that his school-mates would never get done
holding inquests on dead cats and thus keeping the trouble present
to his mind," and that in the account of the spidery six-armed girl
of Emmeline's picture in "Huckleberry Finn," are in the author's
happiest vein. Another admirable instance is to be seen in
Huckleberry Finn's mixed feelings about rescuing Jim, the negro,
from slavery. His perverted views regarding the unholiness of his
actions are most instructive and amusing. It is possible to feel,
however, that the fun in the long account of Tom Sawyer's
artificial imitation of escapes from prison is somewhat forced;
everywhere simplicity is a good rule, and while the account of the
Southern <i>vendetta </i> is a masterpiece, the caricature of books
of adventure leaves us cold. In one we have a bit of life; in the
other Mark Twain is demolishing something that has no place in the
book.

</p><p>Yet the story is capital reading, and the reason of its
great superiority to "Tom Sawyer" is that is it, for the most part,
a consistent whole. If Mark Twain would follow his hero through
manhood, he would condense a side of American life that, in a few
years, will have to be delved out of newspapers, government
reports, county histories, and misleading traditions by
unsympathetic sociologists.</p><lb>

<p>
The boy of to-day is fortunate indeed, and, of a truth, he is to be
congratulated. While the boy of yesterday had to stay his stomach
with the unconscious humour of <i>Sandford and Merton</i>, the boy
of to-day may get his fill of fun and of romance and of adventure
in
<i>Treasure Island</i> and in <i>Tom Brown</i> and in <i>Tom
Sawyer</i>, and now in a sequel to <i>TomSawyer</i>, wherein Tom
himself appears in the very nick of time, like a young god from the
machine. Sequels of stories which have been widely popular are not
a little risky. <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> is a sharp exception to
this
general rule. Although it is a sequel, it is quite as worthy of
wide
popularity as <i>Tom Sawyer</i>. An American critic once neatly
declared that the late G. P. R. James hit the bull's-eye of success
with
his first shot, and that for ever thereafter he went on firing
through the
same hole. Now this is just what Mark Twain has not done.
<i>Huckleberry Finn</i> is not an attempt to do <i>Tom Sawyer</i>
over again. It is a story quite as unlike its predecessor as it is
like.
Although Huck Finn appeared first in the earlier book, and although
Tom Sawyer reappears in the later, the scenes and the characters
are
otherwise wholly different. Above all, the  atmosphere of the story
is
different. <i>Tom Sawyer</i> was a tale of boyish adventure in a
village in Missouri, on the Mississippi river, and it was told by
the
author. <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> is autobiographic; it is a tale of
boyish adventure along the Mississippi river told as it appeared to
Huck Finn. There is not in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> any one scene
quite as funny as those in which Tom Sawyer gets his friends to
whitewash the fence for him, and then uses the spoils thereby
acquired
to attain the highest  situation of the Sunday school the next
morning.
Nor is there any  description quite as thrilling as that awful
moment in
the cave when the  boy and the girl are lost in the darkness, and
when
Tom Sawyer  suddenly sees a human hand bearing a light, and then
finds that the  hand is the hand of Indian Joe, his one mortal
enemy;
we have always  thought that the vision of the hand in the cave in
<i>Tom Sawyer</i> is one of  the very finest things in the
literature
of adventure since Robinson  Crusoe first saw a single footprint in
the
sand of the seashore. But  though Huckleberry Finn may not quite
reach these two highest points  of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>, we incline to
the opinion that the general level of the later story is perhaps
higher
than that of the earlier. For one thing, the skill with which the
character of Huck Finn is maintained is marvellous. We see
everything
through his eyes -- they are his eyes and not a pair of Mark
Twain's
spectacles. And the comments on what he sees are his comments --
the comments of an ignorant, superstitious, sharp, healthy boy,
brought up as Huck Finn had been brought up; they are not speeches
put into his mouth by the author. One of the most artistic things
in the
book --and that Mark Twain is a literary artist of a very high
order all
who have considered his later writings critically cannot but
confess
--one of the most artistic things in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> is the
sober self-restraint with which Mr. Clemens lets Huck Finn set
down,
without any comment at all, scenes which would have afforded the
ordinary writer matter for endless moral and political and
sociological
disquisition. We refer particularly to the account of the
Grangerford-Shepherdson feud, and of the shooting of Boggs by
Colonel Sherburn. Here are two incidents of the rough old life of
the
South-Western States, and of the Mississippi Valley forty or fifty
years ago, of the old life which is now rapidly passing away under
the
influence of advancing civilization and increasing commercial
prosperity, but which has not wholly disappeared even yet, although
a slow revolution in public sentiment is taking place. The
Grangerford-Shepherdson feud is a vendetta as deadly as any
Corsican
could wish, yet the parties to it were honest, brave, sincere, good
Christian people, probably people of deep religious sentiment. Not
the
less we see them taking their guns to church, and, when occasion
serves, joining in what is little better than a general massacre.
The
killing of Boggs by Colonel Sherburn is told with equal sobriety
and
truth; and the later scene in which Colonel Sherburn cows and
lashes
the mob which has set out to Iynch him is one of the most vigorous
bits of writing Mark Twain has done.
</p><p>
     In <i>Tom Sawyer</i> we saw Huckleberry Finn from the outside;
in the  present volume we see him from the inside. He is almost as
much a  delight to any one who has been a boy as was Tom Sawyer.
But only he or she who has been a boy can truly enjoy this record
of
his adventures, and of his sentiments and of his sayings. Old maids
of
either sex will wholly fail to understand him or to like him, or to
see
his significance and his value. Like Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn is a
genuine boy; he is neither a girl in boy's clothes like many of the
modern heroes of juvenile fiction, nor is he a 'little man,' a
full-grown
man cut down; he is a boy, just a boy, only a boy. And his ways and
modes of thought are boyish. As Mr. F. Anstey understands the
English boy, and especially the English boy of the middle classes,
so
Mark Twain understands the American boy, and especially the
American boy of the Mississippi Valley of forty or fifty years ago.
The
contrast between Tom Sawyer, who is the child of respectable
parents, decently brought up, and Huckleberry Finn, who is the
child
of the town drunkard, not brought up at all, is made distinct by a
hundred artistic touches, not the least natural of which is Huck's
constant reference to Tom as his ideal of what a boy should be.
When
Huck escapes from the cabin where his drunken and worthless father
had confined him, carefully manufacturing a mass of very
circumstantial evidence to prove his own murder by robbers, he
cannot help saying, 'I did wish Tom Sawyer was there. I knowed he
would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the
fancy
touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a
thing as that.' Both boys have their full share of boyish
imagination;
and Tom Sawyer, being given to books, lets his imagination run on
robbers and pirates and genies, with a perfect understanding with
himself that, if you want to get fun out of this life, you must
never
hesitate to make believe very hard; and, with Tom's youth and
health,
he never finds it hard to make believe and to be a pirate at will,
or to
summon an attendant spirit, or to rescue a prisoner from the
deepest
dungeon 'neath the castle moat. But in Huck this imagination has
turned to superstition; he is a walking repository of the juvenile
folklore of the Mississippi Valley --a folklore partly traditional
among
the white settlers, but largely influenced by intimate association
with
the negroes. When Huck was in his room at night all by himself
waiting for the signal Tom Sawyer was to give him at midnight, he
felt
so lonesome he <a name="1">wished</a> he was dead:</p><lb>
<lb>

<xref doc="http://etext.virginia.edu/railton/huckfinn/hflink1.html">LINK HF1</xref>
<lb></p>
<p>And, again, later in the story, not at night this time, but in
broad
daylight, Huck walks along a road:
</p><p>
When I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and
sunshiny
-- the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of
faint
dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so
lonesome
and  like everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and
quivers  the leaves, it makes you feel mournful, because you feel
like
it's spirits  whispering --spirits that's been dead ever so many
years
--and you always think they're talking about  you. As a general
thing
it makes a body wish he was dead, too, and done with it all.
</p><p>
Now, none of these sentiments arc appropriate to Tom Sawyer, who
had none of the feeling for nature which Huck Finn had caught
during
his numberless days and nights in the open air. Nor could Tom
Sawyer
either have seen or set down this instantaneous
photograph of a summer storm: -</p><lb>

<lb>
</p><p>
The romantic side of Tom Sawyer is shown in most delightfully
humorous fashion in the account of his difficult devices to aid in
the
easy escape of Jim, a runaway negro. Jim is an admirably drawn
character. There have been not a few fine and firm portraits of
negroes
in recent American fiction, of which Mr. Cable's Bras-Coup&eacute;
in the <i>Grandissimes</i> is perhaps the most vigorous, and Mr.
Harris's Mingo and Uncle Remus and Blue Dave are the most gentle.
Jim is worthy to rank with these; and the essential simplicity and
kindliness and generosity of the Southern negro have never been
better shown than here by Mark Twain. Nor are Tom Sawyer and
Huck Finn and Jim the only fresh and original figures in Mr.
Clemens's
new book; on the contrary, there is scarcely a character of the
many
introduced who does not impress the reader at once as true to life
--
and therefore as new, for life is so varied that a portrait from
life is
sure to be as good as new. That Mr. Clemens draws from life, and
yet
lifts his work from the domain of the photograph to the region of
art,
is evident to any one who will give his work the honest attention
which it deserves. Mr. John T. Raymond, the American comedian,
who performs the character of Colonel Sellers to perfection, is
wont
to say that there is scarcely a town in the West and South-West
where
some man did not claim to be the original of the character. And as
Mark Twain made Colonel Sellers, so has he made the chief players
in the present drama of boyish adventure; they are taken from life,
no
doubt, but they are so aptly chosen and so broadly drawn that they
are
quite as typical as they are actual. They have one great charm, all
of
them  they are not written about and about; they are not described
and dissected and analysed; they appear and play their parts and
disappear; and yet they leave a sharp impression of indubitable
vitality
and individuality. No one, we venture to say, who reads this book
will
readily forget the Duke and the King, a pair of as pleasant
'confidence
operators' as one may meet in a day's journey, who leave the story
in
the most appropriate fashion, being clothed in tar and feathers and
ridden on a rail. Of the more broadly humorous passages -- and they
abound -- we have not left ourselves space to speak; they are to
the
full as funny as in any of Mark Twain's other books; and, perhaps,
in
no other book has the humourist shown so much artistic restraint,
for
there is in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> no mere 'comic copy,' no
straining
after effect; one  might almost say that there is no waste word in
it.
Nor have we left  ourselves room to do more than say a good word
for the illustrations,  which, although slight and unpretending,
are far
better than those to be  found in most of Mark Twain's books. For
one
thing, they actually  illustrate -- and this is a rare quality in
illustrations
nowadays. They give  the reader a distinct idea of the Duke and the
King, of Jim and of Colonel Sherburn, of the Shepherdsons and the
Grangerfords. They are all by one artist, Mr. E. W. Kemble,
hitherto
known to us only as the illustrator of the <i>Thompson Street Poker
Club</i>, an amusing romance of highly-coloured life in New York.

<p>Mark Twain long since learned the art of writing for the market.
His recent books have the character of commercial ventures. He
probably estimates in advance his profits. His books are not sold
to any great extent over the counters of booksellers, but are
circulated by subscription agents. Lately Mark Twain, it is
reported, has become the silent partner in a publishing house, the
imprint of which is on the present volume. Those who read "Tom
Sawyer" and like it will probably read "Huckleberry Finn," and like
it in a less degree. No book has been put on the market with more
advertising. When Mark Twain represented "Tom Sawyer" as getting a
job of free white-washing done by his cronies, because there was
fun in it, and only just enough to go around, he disclosed his own
tactics in the matter of free advertising. When it was given out
that some one had tampered with the engravings in the printing
office, in a mysterious way, that accounted for the delay in
bringing out the book, it secured at the same time many thousand
dollars' worth of free advertising. Then the <i>Century</i> gave
the enterprise a lift by publishing a chapter of the book in
advance, which, while an advertisement, was still a readable
article. "Huckleberry Finn" has been introduced to the world as it
were with the blare of trumpets. It comes also with this warning:
"Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be
prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral in it will be
banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot." So
then there is neither motive, moral, nor plot. But there still
remain one hundred and seventy-four wood cuts, which, according to
the view of the author, ought to be liberally peppered through the
volume. Many of the designs are drawn with spirit, and are all
executed well enough for the plan of the book.

</P><p>The tone of the volume is indicated in the opening
paragraphs:</P>
<lb>
<p>
You don't know me, without you have read a book by the name of "The
Adventures of 'Tom Sawyer,' " but that ain't no matter. That book
was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth mainly. There
were things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That
is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied, one time or another,
without it was "Aunt Polly" or the widow, or maybe "Mary." "Aunt
Polly"--Tom's "Aunt Polly," she is--and "Mary," and the "widow
Douglas," is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true
book; with stretchers, as I said before.</P>
<lb>
<p>The author starts out by telling his juvenile readers that there
are some lies in his book--that most people lie, and that it is not
very bad after all. Of course the warning is timely that persons
attempting to seek a moral in the story should be banished.</P>
<lb>
<p>Now the way the book winds up is this: "Tom" and me found the
money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got
$6,000 a piece--all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it
was piled up. Well, "Judge Thatcher," he took it and put it out at
interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year
round--more than a body could tell what to do with. The "widow
Douglas," she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize
me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering
how dismal, regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and
so, when I could stand it no longer, I lit out. I got into my old
rags and my sugar hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But
"Tom Sawyer," he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band
of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be
respectable. So I went back.</P>
<lb>
<p>It is an amusing story if such scrap-work can be called a story.
The author rarely fails when he sets out to tickle the ribs of
young or old. There is so little genuine wit in the world, that the
little must be made to go a great way. Mark Twain has the genuine
vein; it nearly pinches out here and there, and in many places it
is hardly an inch wide by miners' measurement. The funny book will
always be read in this world of dryness and dearth. Many fastidious
people hide their scruples, because they want to be amused. Comedy
pays better than tragedy. The author contrives to puncture a great
many shams. His satire in this respect, even when he declares that
it is aimless, is directed with a purpose. Whether young people who
read this volume will be the better for it will be an open
question. Here is another paragraph where the warning not to seek
for a moral might be applicable: </P>
<lb>
<p>Every night, now I used to slip ashore, towards 10 o'clock, at
some little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal,
or bacon, or other stuff to eat, and sometimes I lifted a chicken
that warn't roosting comfortable, and took him along. Pap always
said, take a chicken when you get a chance, because if you don't
want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good
deed ain't ever forgot. I never see pap when he didn't want the
chicken himself, but that is what he used to say, anyway.</P>
<lb>
<p>The author turns his knowledge of Western dialects to account.
Mississippi river scenes and associations are always available. The
art of book-making from Twain's point of view is well illustrated
here. He is alive always to the fact that young people will not
read a dull book. He never makes a dull one. There is very little
of literary art in the story. It is a string of incidents
ingeniously fastened together. The spice of juvenile wickedness and
dare-deviltry give a zest to the book. "Huckleberry Finn" is, in a
restricted sense, a typical character. Yet the type is not
altogether desirable, nor is it one that most parents who want a
future of promise for their young folks would select without some
hesitation. The trouble with "Tom Sawyer" and "Huckleberry Finn" is
not that they are too good for this world; even as the world goes,
they are not good enough. Beyond the recognition that there is a
great deal of "fun," as boys would put the case, it must also be
admitted that not a little of the "assisted wit" is of the more
dreary sort, as if the author was subjected to a pretty hard strain
at times to work his facetious vein. The book is attractive enough
to command commercial success, and that, it may be supposed, was
the inspiring motive in its production. </P>

"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" must be pronounced the most
amusing book Mark Twain has written for years. It is a  more minute
and faithful picture of Southwestern manners and customs fifty
years ago than was "Life on the Mississippi," while in regard to
the dialect it surpasses any of the author's previous stories in
the command of the half-dozen species of patois which passed for
the  English language in old Missouri. Mark Twain may be called the
Edison of our literature. There is no limit to his inventive
genius, and the best proof of its range and originality is found in
this book, in which the reader's interest is so strongly enlisted
in the fortunes of two boys and a runaway negro that he follows
their adventures with keen curiosity, although his common sense
tells him that the incidents are as absurd and fantastic in many
was as the "Arabian Nights." Here is where the genius and the human
nature of the author come in. Nothing else can explain such a
<i>tour de force</i> as this, in which the most unlikely materials
are transmuted into a work of literary art. The plot is extremely
simple. Huckleberry Finn, who appeared incidentally in the
veracious adventuers of Tom Sawyer, concludes to go down the
Mississippi to get rid of his drunken father. He falls in with a
runaway negor, and the book is given up to the adventures of this
coupe on a raft on the river, re-enforced by two sharpers known as
the Duke and the King, and afterward by Tom Sawyer. In many parts
of the book, but especially at the outset, some of the
conversations are unnecessarily spun out, on the style of the elder
Dumas when he was writing at so much the word, but when the story
gets under good headway it is remarkably well proportioned, and the
interest is never allowed to flag for a moment. The very best
episodes are those which detail the swindling schemes of the two
river sharpers, who impose upon Huckleberry and the negro by
declaring that they are scions of royalty. These chapters were
printed in the <i>Century</i> under the title of "Royalty on the
Mississippi," but they left the fate of the two heroes in doubt, so
that most readers of the performances of the "Royal Nonesuch," and
the personation of the two brothers from England will want to know
what was the final result of their schemes.
</P><p>The incidental descriptions of character are always good.
Take, for instance, this small picture of Huck's father--a typical
Pike county drunkard:</P>
<lb>
<p>He was most 50, and he looked it. His hair was long and tangled
and greasy and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining
through it like he was behind vines. It was all black, no gray; so
was his long, mixed-up whiskers. There warn't no colorin his face,
where his face showed--it was white; not like another man's white,
but a white to make a body sick, a whote to make a body's flesh
crawl--a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white. As for his
clothes--just rags, that was all.</P>
<lb>
<p>On the raft, while floating down the Mississippi, Huck has an
excellent opportunity to exercise his gift for lying. This is
simply phenomenal. The boy enjoys mendacity; he lies for the mere
lust of lying, and the ingenuity with which he piles one fiction on
top of another will excite the reader's wonder and admiration. Just
before the runaways get fairly started, Huck visits a neighboring
town to get information and encounters a farmer's wife. He is
dressed up in an old calico gown and pretends to be a girl
searching for her relations. The woman suspects his sex and tries
various devices to ascertain if her suspicions are true. Among
these is threading a needle and throwing a bar of lead at the rats
which swarm around the house. Finally she makes Huck own up that he
is a boy, and then gives him this sound advice in regard to
personating a girl:</P>
<lb>
<p>"Don't you go about women in that old calico. You do a girl
tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe. Bless you, child,
when you set out to thread a needle, don't hold the thread still
and fetch the needle up to it. Hold the needle still and poke the
thread at it--that's the way a woman most always does, but a man
always does 'tother way. And when you throw at a rat or anything
hitch yourself up a-tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as
awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot.
Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there
for it to turn on--like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with
your arm out to one side, like a boy. And mind you, when a girl
tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she
don't clap them together the way you did when you catched the lump
of lead. Why, I spotted you for a  boy when you was threading the
needle, and I contrived the other things just to make certain."</P>
<lb>
<p>Some of the most succulent homor is connected with the swindling
exploits of the Duke and the King, who "work" the towns along the
bank and make considerable money. Their crowning work was in
playing the role of the English heirs of old Peter Wilks, a moneyed
resident of one of the river towns, who had just died. In the
construction of this plot Mark Twain surpasses himself and the
amount of really plausible lies which he manages to dovetail
together is something extraordinary. A half-dozen times the
adventurers are on the eve of exposure, but their fertility and
luck save them. Space is lacking to do more than give one extract
from this episode, which is a story in itself, descriptive of the
Arkansas undertaker at the funeral of old Peter: </P>
<lb>
<p>When the place was packed full the undertaker he
slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways,
putting on
the last touches, and getting
people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and
making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke;
he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he
opened up passageways, and done it with nods, and
signs with his hands. Then he took his place over
against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest,
stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn't no more
smile to him than there is to a ham.
 </p>
<p>They had borrowed a melodeum  --  a sick one; and
when everything was ready a young woman set down
and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky,
and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the
only one that had a good thing, according to my
notion. Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow
and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the
most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body
ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most
powerful racket, and he kept it up right along; the
parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait
 --  you couldn't hear yourself think. It was right
down awkward, and nobody didn't seem to know what
to do. But pretty soon they see that long-legged
undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to
say, "Don't you worry  --  just depend on me." Then
he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall,
just his shoulders showing over the people's heads.
So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and more

outrageous all the time; and at
last, when he had gone around two sides of the room,
he disappears down cellar. Then in about two seconds
we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a
most amazing howl or two, and then everything was
dead still, and the parson begun his solemn talk where
he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker's back
and
shoulders gliding along the wall
again; and so he glided and glided around three sides
of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth
with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the
preacher, over the people's heads, and says, in a kind
of a coarse whisper, "He had a rat!" Then he
drooped down and glided along the wall again to his
place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to the
people, because naturally they wanted to know. A
little thing like that don't cost nothing, and it's just the
little things that makes a man to be looked up to and
liked. There warn't no more popular man in town
than what that undertaker was.</p>
<lb>
<p>There are dozens of descriptive bits as good as this and others
in which there is no attempt at caricature, such, for instance, as
the picture of the old one-horse cotton plantation of Phelps, which
any one who has seen the South will recognize as a type. What Mark
Twain can do in short sketches of persons is shown by the portrait
of old Mrs. Hotchkiss, which is one of the best things in the book.
Any one who has ever lived in the Southwest, or who has visited
that section, will recognize the truth of all these sketches and
the art with which they are brought into this story. To all readers
we can commend the story as eminently readable. The person who can
withstand the abounding humor of this book must be proof against
all jokes except of the Joe Miller order. The volume is very well
gotten up, the illustrations adding materially to the fun of the
story.

<p>The San Francisco agents of this book give notice that, though
some unavoidable delays have occurred, this volume is now ready for
delivery to subscribers. As to the work itself, it is well
described by the author, as being without a motive, a moral, or a
plot. The only reason to be, as the French say, is probably that
the author thought he could make some money by publishing a book of
some kind, and here it is--such as it is. It is apparently, as the
art critics say, a pot-boiler in its baldest form. AS a picture of
life in the Southwest, however, there is little to be said in the
book's favor, though there are several passages which are drawn
with much ability, with occasionally a touch of a sort of grotesque
pathos which greatly interests the reader. As to the rest, it is
very much of the same character as many of the author's Pacific
Coast sketches, in the utter absence of truth and being unlike
anything that ever existed in the earth, above the earth, or in the
waters under the earth. Some twenty-two years since, when Mr.
Clemens was working as a reporter on the <i>Territorial
Enterprise,</i> published in Virginia City, Nevada, he signalized
his career by getting up a series of startling stories, the most
prominent feature of which was the lack of a grain of fact. One of
Clemens' most notorious lucutrations in this line was the report of
the massacre of a whole family at Van Sickles or Empire City, which
caused much horror and also great annoyance. Mark Twain contended
that this was a good joke, and the parties who were inconvenienced
should not have got angry. When, however, it was his ox that was
gored, there were no such feelings of equanimity exhibited on his
side of the house. For instance, afterward, when he paid a visit to
his old haunts on the Comstock, a party of his former intimates
played a practical joke on him, he was one of the maddest mortals
who could be seen in a day's march. Something, however, should be
said in praise of the style in which the book has been published.
It is plentifully illustrated with engravings of no mean skill, and
is well printed in fine, clear type.
