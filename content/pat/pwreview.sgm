<p>The best thing in <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>, by Mark Twain
(Chatto & Windus), is the picture of the negro slave Roxana, the
cause of all the trouble which gives scope to Mr. Wilson's ingenious
discovery about finger-marks. Her gusts of passion or of despair, her
vanity, her motherly love, and the glimpses of nobler feelings that are
occasionally seen in her elementary code of morals, make her very
human, and create a sympathy for her in spite of her unscrupulous
actions. But hers is the only character that is really striking. Her son
is a poor creature, as he is meant to be, but he does not arrest the
reader with the same unmistakable reality: his actions are what might
be expected, but his conversations, especially with Wilson and the
Twins, seem artificial and forced. Wilson, the nominal hero, appears
to most advantage in the extracts from his calendar which head the
chapters, but as a personage he is rather too shadowy for a hero. And
what has to be said about the book must be chiefly about the
individuals in it, for the story in itself is not much credit to Mark
Twain's skill as a novelist. The idea of the change of babies is happy,
and the final trial scene is a good piece of effect; but the story at
times rambles on in an almost incomprehensible way. Why drag in,
for example, all the business about the election, which is quite
irrelevant? and the Twins altogether seem to have very little
<i>raison d'etre</i> in the book. Of course there are some funny
things in the story, it would not be by Mark Twain if there were
not, but the humour of the preface might very well be spared; it is in
bad taste. Still, if the preface be skipped the book well repays reading
just for the really excellent picture of Roxana.</p>

<p>Every scientific experiment or discovery of direct human import is
soon followed by fiction of which it forms the basis. That the
finger-print method of identification has not sooner provided the matter
of a tale is surprising. Mark Twain uses it here ingeniously.
"Pudd'nhead" is another name for fool; it is applied hastily to Mr. David
Wilson, a lawyer and surveyor, who in his leisure hours amuses himself
with making "records" of the finger tips of his acquaintances. In the case
of two children born on the same day, and bearing a strong resemblance to
each other, one a child of consequence, the other the child of a slave
girl, he made continuous records. Then one of them, the wrong one of
course, was sold with the slave mother. The reader can develop the story
from that point, or if not, Mark Twain will do it for him. As the mistake
lasts for twenty-three hard years, in spite of Pudd'nhead Wilson's
cleverness, the end is prevented from being a very cheerful one. </p>

<p>Let me add, for the sake of a transition, that Mark Twain, whose
"Puddin'-Head Wilson" I have just finished, is even more unique among
humorists. Here we have a novel of the ante-bellum days in Missouri,
rather melodramatic in plot, and full of the liveliest kind of action. If
anybody but Mark Twain had undertaken to tell that kind of story, with
exchanges of infants in the cradle, a hero with negro taint in his blood
substituted for the legitimate white heir, midnight encounters in a
haunted house between the false heir and his colored mother, murder by the
villain of his supposed uncle and benefactor, accusation of an innocent
foreigner, and final sensational acquittal and general unraveling of the
tangled skein -- if, I say, anybody else had had the hardihood to utilize
afresh this venerable stage machinery of fiction, we should have been
tempted to class his work with such cheap stuff as that of Wilkie Collins,
Hugh Conway, and the dime novelists. But Mark Twain, somehow, has lifted
it all into the region of literature. In the first place, the alleged
extracts from Puddin'-Head Wilson's calendar are inimitably droll and
witty. Take, for instance, this: </p>
<p>
	"There is no character, howsoever good and fine, but it can be
destroyed by ridicule, howsoever poor and witless. Observe the ass, for
instance: his character is about perfect; he is the choicest spirit among
the humbler animals; yet see what ridicule has brought him to. Instead of
feeling complimented, when we are called an ass, we are left in doubt."</p>
<p>
	Then again, the Missouri village in which the scene is laid, is so
vividly realized in its minutest details; and the people, in all their
fatuous prejudice and stolidity, are so credible and authentic, so steeped
in the local atmosphere, that the illusion becomes perfect, and we swallow
the melodrama without a qualm, -- exchange of heirs, haunted house, murder,
and all, -- and scarcely dream that we have been duped, until we wake up
with a start at the end of the last chapter. "Tell the truth, or trump,
-- but take the trick," is one of Puddin'-Head Wilson's maxims; and the
author, to make assurance doubly sure, has done both. He evidently has an
ample fund of experience to draw upon; and he possesses, also, that high
imaginative faculty which does not consist in crude invention, but in
shaping remembered truth into logical and artistic coherence. His people
stand squarely upon their feet, not because he has so constructed them,
but because he has known their type and been familiar with their looks,
speech, and habits. How deliciously rich, racy, and copious is, for
instance, his negro talk. The very gurgling laugh and cooing cadence
seem, somehow, implied in the text; and the fancy instinctively adds the
vivid miens and gestures. Since Mark Twain wrote his "Tom Sawyer" and
"Roughing It," he has published no book comparable in interest to
"Puddin'-Head Wilson."</p>

<head>The Critic Reviews Pudd'nhead

<i>Critic</i> [unsigned]<lb>
1895: May 11</head>

<ref><date> 1895</date>
<nation> British</nation>
<favor> Mixed </favor></ref>

<p>The literary critic is often puzzled how to classify the intellectual
phenomena that come within his ken. His business is of course
primarily with <i>literature</i>. A work may be infinitely amusing, it
may abound even with flashes and touches of genius, and yet the form
in which it comes into the world may be so crude, so coarse, so erring
from the ways of true classicism, so offensive to immemorial canons of
taste, that the critic, in spite of his enjoyment and wonder, puts it
reluctantly down in the category of unclassifiable literary things only
to take it up and enjoy it again!</p>

<p>Of such is <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>, and, for that matter, Mark
Twain in general. The author is a signal example of sheer genius,
without training or culture in the university sense, setting forth to
conquer the world with laughter whether it will or no, and to get
himself thereby acknowledged to be the typical writer of the West. He
is the most successful of a class of American humorists whose impulse
to write off their rush of animal spirits is irresistible, and who snatch at
the first pen within reach as the conductor of their animal electricity. If
we look at other national humorists, like Aristophanes, Cervantes,
Moliere or Swift, we find their humor expressed in an exquisite literary
form, in which a certain polish tempers the extravagance, and annoying
metrical (or it may be imaginative) difficulties have been overcome.
What wonderful bird-rhythms and wasp melodies and
cloud-architecture, so to speak, emerge from the marvellous choral
interludes of the Greek comedian; what suave literary graces enclose
the gaunt outlines of Don Quixote; in what honeyed verse are Alceste
and Tartuffe entangled, and what new, nervous, powerful prose
describes the adventures of Gulliver! When we turn our eyes westward
we encounter Judge Haliburton, Hosea Biglow, Uncle Remus, Mark
Twain -- an absolutely new <i>genre</i> distinct from what we had
previously studied in the line of originalities. The one accomplished
artist among these is Lowell, whose university traditions were very
strong and controlled his bubbling humor. The others are pure
"naturalists" -- men of instinctive genius, who have relied on their own
conscious strength to produce delight in the reader, irrespective of
classicity of form, literary grace or any other of the beloved
conventions on which literature as literature has hitherto depended.
This is true in a less degree of Uncle Rcmus than of Judge Haliburton
and Mark Twain.</p>

<p><i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> is no exception to the rule. It is a
Missouri tale of changelings "befo' the wah," admirable in atmosphere,
local color and dialect, a drama in its way, full of powerful situations,
thrilling even; but it cannot be called in any sense literature. In it Mark
Twain's brightness and grotesqueness and funniness revel and sparkle,
and in the absurd extravaganza, "Those Extraordinary Twins," all
these comicalities reach the buffoon point; one is amused and laughs
unrestrainedly but then the irksome question comes up: What <i>is</i>
this? is it literature? is Mr. Clemens a "writer" at all? must he not after
all be described as an admirable after-dinner storyteller -- humorous,
imaginative, dramatic, like Dickens -- who in an evil moment, urged by
admiring friends, has put pen to paper and written down his stories?
Adapted to the stage and played by Frank Mayo, the thing has met
with immediate success.</p>

<p>[<i>This review seems to be based on the story's serial publication in</i> The Century<i>, where it had just finished appearing in June. The novel was not published until November.</i>]</p><lb>

<p><i>Puddenhead Wilson</i>, Mark Twain's latest story, is the work
of a novelist, rather than of a "funny man." There is plenty of humour in
it of the genuine Mark Twain brand, but it is as a carefully painted
picture of life in a Mississippi town in the days of slavery that its chief
merit lies. In point of construction it is much the best story that Mark
Twain has written, and of men and women in the book at least four are
undeniably creations, and not one of them is overdrawn or caricatured,
as are some of the most popular of the author's lay figures. There is but
one false note in the picture, and that is the introduction of the two
alleged Italian noblemen. These two young men are as little like Italians
as they are like Apaches. When challenged to fight a duel, one of them,
having the choice of weapons, chooses revolvers instead of swords. This
incident alone is sufficient to show how little Italian blood there is in
Mark Twain's Italians. But this is a small blemish, and if Mark Twain, in
his future novels, can maintain the proportion of only two lay figures to
four living characters, he will do better than most novelists. The extracts
from "Puddenhead Wilson's Almanac," which are prefixed to each
chapter of the book, simply "pizon us for more," to use Huck Finn's
forcible metaphor. Let us hope that a complete edition of that unrivalled
almanac will be issued at no distant day.</p>

[<i>This unusual "review" seems to assume everyone is already familiar with the story of MT's novel, and focuses its attention almost exclusively on the illustrations in the American edition. It ignores or forgets about the illustrations that appeared with the novel in</i> The Century Magazine<i>, and it attributes all the marginal illustrations to one artist, though two different names are attached to the pictures themselves.</i>]<lb><lb>

<center><font size=+1>Mark Twain's New Volume.</font></b></center><lb>

Thanks to an artist who, though he does not draw well, is clever in grasping ideas, the fun and
drollery and the comedy and tragedy of two of Mark Twain's most interesting stories have been
multiplied many times. Those who have enjoyed "Pudd'nhead Wilson," with nothing but their
imaginations to help them picture what sort of man the hero of the story was and what the scenes
were in which he acted his part, will be glad to run through the story again along with the artist,
who, it may be assumed, has recorded in his marginal pictures the author's material conceptions of
the things he has written about.<p>

They may see that "well-fed, well-petted, and properly-revered" cat stretched at full length on the
window ledge, "asleep and blissful with her furry belly to the sun and a paw curved over her
nose." That was one of the sight's of Dawson's Landing. They may see the tinmonger's pole
standing on one of the chief corners of the village, "wreathed from top to bottom with tin pots
and pans and cups," giving noisy notice to the world, when the wind blew, that the tinmonger was
close at hand ready for business. They may look upon Wilson when, as he entered the village
intent upon establishing himself in the law business, he made the remark that ruined him for the
time being. "I wish I owned half that dog," said Wilson. "Why?" somebody asked. "Because,"
answered Wilson, "I'd kill my half." The villagers decided promptly that a man who did not know
that to kill half a dog would be death to the entire animal was without that important requisite for
a lawyer, a legal mind.<p>

So all through the story the illustrator accompanies the text. He shows the village firemen
drowning the old market house with water pumped through the little hand engine; he shows
Wilson, when he had come to be somebody, addressing a mass meeting, a flag flying over him
bearing the announcement that he is conducting a campaign for the Mayoralty, and in one of his
best pictures he illustrates the text, "A devil born to a young couple is measurably recognizable by
them before long; but a devil adopted by an old couple is an angel to them and remains so through
thick and thin."<p>

But it is in "Those Extraordinary Twins," which is the second part of the volume, that the artist
has done his cleverest work. This undoubtedly is because the story is the funnier of the two.
There is an almost infinite amount of suggestion for an artist of the humorous vein in the story of
the two-headed man whom Twain persists in regarding as really two men -- making one man sick
while the other is well; making one fight a duel while the other protests against the performance;
baptizing the good one while the other sputters curses; hanging the bad one while the other looks
indignant, though he finally does consent to join in the kicking.<p>

[<i>This isn't really a review of the novel, but it is interesting as a first response to the story. A
regular feature of</i> The Review of Reviews <i> was "The Periodicals Reviewed," a summary of
some of the main articles in many American, British and French magazines and quarterlies. The
following is from the account of the contents of</i> The Century<i>, written after the first
installment of</i> Pudd'nhead Wilson <i>had appeared there in December, 1893. MT's novel ran
in</i> The Century <i>until June, 1894, but for some reason</i> The Review of Reviews
<i>never discussed or mentioned the story again. It would have been interesting to know what "moral" about race the author of this comment felt the novel finally pointed.</i>]
<lb><lb>

The feature of the number [i.e. the December <i>Century</i>] so far as fiction is concerned is the
beginning of Mark Twain's serial novel, "Pudd'n Head Wilson," the scene of which is laid in
Southwest Missouri thirty-five years ago. The first chapters give but small indication of that
humor which made Mr. Clemens' fame.  Curiously enough, the plot, if one may presume to
prophesy from the first chapters, is going to center around the mixing up of two babies, one of
whom is a white child and the other a mulatto with a slight strain of negro blood, the two being
under the charge of the fond mulatto mother; so that we may expect to find Mark Twain drawing
some healthy moral concerning the race problem before we are through with "Pudd'n Head
Wilson."<p>

<p>Mark Twain's last book is a story of mixed babies and the
ingenious detection of crime. It is not altogether another
<i>Huckleberry Finn</i>. On the other hand, it is a relief to find that
it is not another <i>Yankee at King Arthur's Court</i>. Roxy, the slave
woman, who changes the babies, is a delightful character, who stirs us
with a warm and ready interest. For the rest, there is little that can
be said to rouse enthusiasm. Pudd'nhead Wilson himself is a little
unreal, too much of the <i>deus ex machina</i>, though there is much that
is Twainian in the specimen sayings that illustrate his wisdom. Every
chapter is headed with these extracts, and it is clear that Pudd'nhead
Wilson is to Mark Twain what Poor Richard was to Franklin. In the means
by which Wilson detects the murderer of Judge Driscoll we have an
ingenious adaptation of the system of thumb-impressions, originated by
Sir W. Herschell in India, as a method of identifying criminals. It is
cleverly, if not entirely persuasively, worked out in the story. But the
sketch of Roxy, the negress, is by far the finest thing in the book.</p>

<center><font size="+1">IN RE "PUDD'NHEAD WILSON."</font></center><lb>
<p>
  A better title, perhaps, would be "The
  Decline and Fall of Mark Twain;" for,
  looking at it solely as a piece of literature,
  there is no denying, that his much-advertised serial is tremendously stupid.
  If it were nothing more, the reading, even
  the critical, world could afford to receive
  it in the charity of silence, remembering
  the merry heart it has had these twenty
  years past whenever it pleased Mr.
  Clemens to amuse it.</p>

<p>
  "Pudd'nhead Wilson" is more than
  stupid. So far as it has appeared -- to
  the end of the second installment, that
  is -- it is at once malicious and misleading.
  So much so, indeed, that involuntarily
  one recalls the gentleman who, it
  was said, "went to his memory for his
  wit, and his imagination for his facts."</p>

<p>
  It certainly seems to me that Mr.
  Clemens must have imagined all the local
  color of his tale. It has to do with
  Dawson's Landing, a small Missouri
  town on the Mississippi, populated largely
  with F. F. V.'s, all of whom are slave-holders, as are the rest of the inhabitants.
  Right here I wish to ask why it is that
  the Southern man who has an honest
  and decent pride in the fact that he
  comes of good stock fares so ill at the
  hands of certain literary gentlemen?
  Bret Harte gives us Colonel Starbottle as
  his type. Mr. Cable has won fame and
  fortune and the heart of the whole North
  by demonstrating to its entire satisfaction
  how heartlessly and continually all his
  well-born gentlemen overstep the color
  line. Last of all, Mark Twain has set
  himself the task of showing how impossible
  it is for a man to have a great-grandfather
  and, at the same time, any
  regard for the Decalogue.</p>

<p>

  Perhaps the gentlemen are bent on
  gleaning the full harvest of "Uncle
  Tom's Cabin." Perhaps, too, they are
  wise in so doing. In my seven years
  North, I have more than once been
  asked by people who regarded themselves
  as very well informed "if there
  were still in the South any pure blacks
  at all, or any pure-blooded whites?"
  At first such questioning made me angry.
  Later, I have come to recognize it as the
  legitimate outcome of the deliverances
  of Mr. Cable and his school. Now that
  Mark Twain has come under their banner,
  the impression will doubtless become
  more than ever current. For he
  has -- and has deserved -- the widest public
  of any living American writer. And
  it is a melancholy fact that the sheep
  instinct of humanity is so strong as to
  make it follow <i>en masse</i> into any pasture
  of opinion where he may lead. A still
  more melancholy fact is the inability of
  many folk to judge a thing with eyes
  blinded by the glamour of a great reputation.</p>

<p>

  Otherwise, I think, some one would
  have risen ere this to protest against
  some of Mr. Clemens' gentle idiosyncrasies
  displayed in the first installment.
  For instance, the character of Pembroke
  Howard, introduced solely that the
  author might tell us that Howard, too,
  was an F. F. V., also that "he was
  popular with the people" -- and that the
  story has no sort of concern with him.
  A while later he is permitted to die. At
  least there is a line to that effect. What
  I want to know, and would like to ask
  Mr Clemens, is how a man can be
  "popular with the people," since popular
  means of, by, or with the people. It
  does assuredly seem to me pretty queer
  usage for a man who was so lately toasted
  and feted by the Lotos Club, as the leading
  exponent of literary art.</p>

<p>

  That is by no means a solitary gem of
  its kind. Careful reading shows the like
  upon almost every page. It is not too
  much to say, in fact, that there is slovenly
  construction in every other paragraph.
  But the manner is a trifling burden compared
  with the matter of it. First to
  last, the writer seemed to feel his burden
  of humor-with-malice-aforethought. He
  had chosen his place, his people. If the
  facts about them are not humorous, so
  much the worse for facts.</p>

<p>

  Witness the naming of the hero. He
  had come out of Western New York to
  practice law in the Missouri town. One
  day, hearing a dog bark, be indulges in
  the Joe-Millerism of wishing he owned
  half the dog so he might make an end of
  it. Thereupon the bystanders "fell away
  from him as something uncanny, and went
  into privacy to discuss him, One said;
 "'Pears to be a fool.'</p>

<p>

 "'Pears? ' said another. '<i>Is</i>, I reckon.
  Said he wished he owned half the dog.'</p>

<p>

 "'The idiot,' said a third. ' What did
  he reckon would become of the other
  half if he killed his half? Do you reckon
  he thought it would live ?'</p>

<p>

  "' In my opinion he ain't got any
  mind.'</p>

<p>

  " No. 3 said: 'Well, he's a lummox,,
  anyway.'</p>

<p>

  "'That's what he is,' said No. 4
  'He's a labrick; just a Simon pure
  labrick: if ever there was one.'</p>

<p>

  "'Yes, sir, he's a damn fool, that's the
 way I put him up,' said No, 5. 'Any
  body can think different that wants to.
  but those are my sentiments '</p>
<p>
  "'I am with you gentlemen,' said No.
  6. 'Perfect jackass -- yes, and it ain't
  going too far to say he is a pudd'nhead.
  If he ain't a pudd'nhead, I ain't no judge,
  that's all.'</p>
<p>
  "Mr. Wilson stood elected. The
  incident was told all over town and
  gravely discussed by everybody. Within
  a week he had lost his first name. Pudd'nhead
  took its place."</p>
<p>
  This is humor, as the great editors
  understand it. To one a little bit
  conversant with the folk who are supposed
  to be humorous, it seems, contrariwise,
  something cheap and thin. Throughout
  the Southwest, for at least seventy five
  years, "I'd like to own that dog -- and
  kill my half " has been a cant saying so
  commonly current that it is laughed at
  only out of compliment to the user of it.
  The men who should now perpetrate it
  as original would perhaps be called something
  worse than a "pudd'nhead," but
  very certainly nobody -- not the most
  ignorant -- would find in it a suggestion
  of uncanniness. For the thing is so
  common and proverbial that little
  children make use of it, or rather of its
  implication. More than one small lad
  has told me, rejoicing, "Ma has stopped
  her half of me from going to school."
  And one shrewd young person within
  my knowledge bought half of a coveted
  dolly, then insisted on a property-right to
  play with it all the time.</p>
<p>
  So, too, of Mr. Clemens' young man
  who went away East to college, and
  came back with "Eastern polish,"
  whatever that may be -- perhaps perfect
  fitting clothes and a habit of wearing
  gloves. His old friends overlooked the
  polish of the clothes, but could not forgive
  the glove habit, so he was left
  solitary. This is some more, doubtless,
  of Mr. Clemens' very peculiar humor.
  He ought, however, to have stated the
  fact in a foot note. He might have been
  at the same pains about the reception to
  the Brothers Capollo. His account of
  the honors thrust upon them is doubtless
  a sly revenge upon the misguided Southern
  communities, which have stretched
  out admiring hands to Mr. Clemens
  when he would rather they did not.</p>
<p>
  So much for the accidentals of the tale.
  To deal adequately with the story itself,
  either in motif or atmosphere, would
  require more time and space than I, at
  present, command. It is built around
  the exchange of two children, born the
  same day, to one father. One his wife's
  son; the other, his slave's. The wife dies;
  the slave mother, who has sixteen parts
  of white blood to one of black, has sole
  charge of both babies. After a while,
  her master (as is the custom of Virginia
  gentlemen in the hands of high literary
  persons),for some biding fault, sells all
  the other house servants, though as a
  mark of magnanimity he sells them at
  home instead of sending them down the
  river. The life-likeness of this part will
  be apparent to every ex slave owner,
  especially to such as remember how far
  beyond rubies was in those days the
  price of a thoroughly excellent servant.
  Setting wholly aside the human affection
  that often subsisted between white and
  black, few men were so foolish as to
  inconvenience themselves by entire
  change of <i>menege</i>, without the most
  imperative necessity for such a proceeding.
  All that is, however, beside the mark.
  This sale goes forward, and as a result,
  Roxy, the white slave, puts her son in
  his half brother's place to save him from
  the possibility of such a fate.</p>
<p>
  She also puts her creator -- Mark Twain
  -- in rather a hard dilemma. To his mind
  the only man worth either saving or damning
  in all the South country is the black
  man. The exigencies of fiction, however,
  make it necessary that the grave baby, who
  normally would grow up a pen feathered
  angel, shall, as his own young master,
  grow up a pretty respectable devil.
  Similarly, the white child must be, by
  the change of position, endowed with
  all the virtue and grace of the subject
  race. Anybody can see that it is hard
  lines for the writer, One can fancy him
  apologizing beforehand to the little
  negro for the violence he is compelled to
  do his character. He makes the plunge
  and the double transformation boldly. It
  is more than a little amusing, though, to
  one who knows experimentally the autocracy
  of a "black mammy," to read
  how Roxy, after the exchange, was
  surprised to see how steadily and surely the
  awe which had kept her tongue reverent,
  her manner humble towards her young
  master, was transferring itself to her
  speech and manner toward the usurper.
  Roxy must have been a mighty exceptional
  character if she did not spank her
  charges with natural and noble impartiality,
  whether they were white or black.</p>
<p>
  She had christened her own child
  "Valet de Chambre -- no surname.
  Slaves hadn't the privilege." That is some
  more news to us who owned them, and
  who keep lively memories of their pride
  in their surnames; and how tenaciously,
  after freedom came, they clung to the
  appellations whereunto they felt themselves
  born. In founding their families
  under the new conditions, it was often
  laughable to see the leaning to aristocracy.
  In more than one case within
  my own knowledge, negroes abandoned
  the names of the living masters, in favor
  of that of the master's grandfather from
  whom they were inherited and to whose
  family they leaned because of is
  greater distinction. Truly, if they had
  had no privilege of surnames, there must
  have been confusion worse confounded
  in the era '65.</p>
<p>
  Time and patience fell alike in bringing
  to book all such matters here set
  down. Suffice it to say that, first to last,
  the whole recital is unveracious. If it is
  meant for caricature, the result is the
  same as would come from exaggerating
  the ear, nose, and coat-tails of a Bowery
  tough, and labelling the picture "Ward
  McAllister." So far as I know, all that
  the South, either "Old" or "New," has
  ever done to Mr. Clemens has been to buy
  his books, when it had precious little
  money to buy anything, and to set him
  upon a pedestal as the very prince of
  humorists. Wherefore, I quite fail to
  comprehend why it pleases him to villify
  us as he is doing in this book.</p>
<p>
  Let me add that I am no bigot in
  behalf of mine own people. Some have
  foibles, faults galore, even sins of
  deepest dye. There are knaves and fools
  among them -- uncouth fellows not a few,
  So much I readily grant. I will go
  further and admit that there is that in the
  social constitution which, rightly handled,
  might give a humorist scope to add
  largely to the gaiety of nations. But
  take them by little and large, they are
  neither sordid nor stolid, nor lacking in
  the finer parts of humanity. All this
  Mr. Clemens makes them out to be.
  And because he is who he is, a large
  part of our common country will take
  his circus-posters for accurate photographs
  of life and people in the South.
  Solely for that reason, I make, here and
  now, my protest against this injustice. I
  can not comfort myself with the belief
  that he has sinned ignorantly against
  half his countrymen. His experience
  has been too wide, his intelligence is too
  keen, for that. He is, it seems to me,
  thus unveracious for revenue only. He
  has found out the sort of book that soils
  [sells?] best. It is not that which speaks the
  truth as it is, but as the reader wishes to
  believe it to be. Beside, it is only against
  a background so lurid as the one be he
  manufactured that the action of his story
  could possibly take place. As an
  occasional dabbler in fiction, I recognize
  the strength of that necessity. But I
  can not hold that it is sufficient to justify
  the falsification of all historic conditions.
  A long time ago, I read a speech of Mr.
  Clemens in which he said, at the
  outset, that he had chosen something he
  knew nothing whatever about so as to be
  quite unhampered by facts. To judge
  from "Pudd'nhead Wilson," he has
  contracted a habit of being unhampered by
  facts -- a habit which seems to grow
  stronger with age.</p>

<p>--Has Mr. Samuel L. Clemens found Missouri audiences or readers slow to
appreciate his jokes? Mr. David Wilson comes to a Missouri town to
push his fortunes. Unluckily his first utterance when he lands from a
steamer -- did steamboats pass "every hour or so" up and down the
Mississippi in 1830? -- is about a yelping dog, that if he owned half of
the beast he would kill his half. This would have been a fair joke in
New York; to the Missourians it seemed proof positive that the speaker
was a fool. Hence the sobriquet of "Pudd'nhead" which the public
opinion of the town fastens upon him. But he doesn't deserve it. On the
contrary, he is a clever fellow. He understands, for instance, how
the impressions of finger-tips may be made proofs of identity -- is
not this again a little before date in 1830? This is the point of the
story, which is a somewhat gloomy but powerful tale of the slavery
times. "Mark Twain's" negroes are not of the Uncle Tom type; but the
story is not on that account a less vigorous indictment of the old
social order of the South.</p>
