<p>
But for the Introduction to this book, we should have little
difficulty in assigning it its proper place in literature. We should
say at once that the author was draping himself in the garb of one
of those typical Yankee tourists of whom we hear so often, and
whom we do meet occasionally,  --  the tourists who "do"
Europe in six weeks,  --  whose comment on Venice is that
they do not care much for those old towns, and on the Venus de'
Medici that they do not like them stone gals. If we thought at all
about the name on the title-page, we should put it down as a
pseudonym, though the probability is that we should not think
about it. Anyhow, we should come to the conclusion that Mark
Twain, whoever he might be, had hit off the oddities of some of
his countrymen very well; that many of his remarks were
amusing, and almost witty; and that he was certainly not such a
fool as he tried to look. But when Mr. Hingston tells us seriously
that Mark Twain is really the pseudonym of the sub-editor of a
daily paper in a Western city a few months old, that he is a
flower of the wilderness, a thoroughly untravelled American
applying the standard of Nevada to historical Europe, we are
fairly puzzled. We can readily believe that the writer of this book
is ignorant of many of those things which would be familiar to
an English tourist. His remark that "Raphael, Angelo, Canova
 --  giants like these gave birth to the designs" of the statues
on the Cathedral at Milan, is not much more than the hasty
generalization of one who takes his facts from guides and
guide-books. The statement that "Raphael pictured such infernal
villains as Catherine de' Medici seated in heaven and conversing
familiarly with the Virgin Mary and the angels," may surprise
those who remember that Catherine de' Medici was only born
one year before the death of Raphael. Again, we are told that
Raphael is buried in Santa Croce, instead of in the Pantheon; but
we may conclude from this that in Mark Twain's opinion every
great artist should be buried in several places, just as each relic
of a saint is multiplied. We owe this suggestion to what Mark
Twain says of an important fellow-passenger calling himself
Commissioner of the United States of America to Europe, Asia,
and Africa. The comment on this "titular avalanche" is, "to my
thinking, when the United States considered it necessary to send
a dignitary of that tonnage across the ocean, it would be in better
taste and safer to take him apart and cart him over in sections in
several ships."

</p><p>In all these mistakes there is nothing unnatural. Most
men who are not learned, and who do not take the precaution of
using books of reference before they speak, may fall into the
same errors. The only thing that characterizes Mark Twain is the
reckless manner in which he makes his assertions. The greater
his blunder, the more assurance there is in his language. Thus he
says, without the slightest reserve, that the Emperor of the
French "kept his faithful watch and walked his weary beat as a
common policeman of London" as if the special constable of
1848 had been Z 264. Yet it is not till we get beyond the
mistakes that we light on the genuine untravelled American. It
is significant of him that he does not commit himself to facts of
his own, because he is sceptical as to the existence of everything.
He listens gravely to the guide's stories, and then asks some
question which reduces them to an absurdity. He finds everybody
else admiring a picture, and that is enough to set him against it.
By putting a number of exaggerations together he deprives any
little grain of truth of its value. This is the man who, in the
present volume, remarks that the Italians spell a word Vinci and
pronounce it Vinchy, adding calmly, "foreigners always spell
better shall they pronounce." He, too, when shown the writing of
Christopher Columbus observes, "Why, I have seen boys in
America only fourteen years old that could write better than that.
You mustn't think you can impose on us because we are
strangers. We are not fools by a good deal. If you have got any
specimens of penmanship of real merit, trot them out, and if you
haven't, drive on!" There are a good many comments on pictures
from the same point of view. Take this on the characters of
Sacred Art:  "When we see a monk sitting on a rock, looking
tranquilly up to heaven, with a human skull beside him and
without other baggage, we know that is St. Jerome; because we
know that he always went flying light in the matter  of baggage.
When we see a party looking tranquilly up to heaven,
unconscious that his body is shot through and through with
arrows, we know that that is St. Sebastian. When we see other
monks looking tranquilly up to heaven, but <i>having no
trade-mark,</i> we always ask who those parties are." Another
question on which the untravelled American is worth hearing is
the ubiquity of guides, with their constant repetition of legends
and their unceasing exaggeration. At Gibraltar one story was
dinned into the tourist's ear, till at last he exclaimed to the
narrator, "Sir, I am a helpless orphan in a foreign land; have pity
on me." One supposed safeguard against invention is that a guide
"would hardly try so hazardous an experiment as the telling of a
falsehood when it is all he can do to speak the truth in English
without getting the lockjaw." But even this seems to have failed
in Rome, if we may judge from the following tirade against the
mythical being to whom the guides give the name of Michael
<a name="1">Angelo:</a>
</p><p>
<xref doc="http://etext.virginia.edu/railton/innocent/linkia4.html">[LINK IA4]</xref>
</p><p>
This last touch is exactly characteristic of the untravelled
American.  In other places, however, the exaggeration to which
Mark Twain gives way shows that he is consciously acting a
part. We do not like him any the worse for that, and without the
preface we should have been easily reconciled to his
eccentricities. His incidental remarks about things in general are
sufficiently humorous to ensure his book a hearing, though they
have the misfortune to contradict Mr. Hingston's theory. The
genuine Yankee tourist would never sneer at one of his fellow
countrymen for ignorance of French manners and assumption of
native superiority. When Mark Twain finds an American
proclaiming his nationality in this offensive way  --  "I am
a freeborn sovereign, Sir, an American, Sir, and I want
everybody to know it"  --  he adds, "the fellow did not
mention that he was a lineal descendant of Balaam's ass, but
everybody knew that without his telling it." Does this come
under the rule of <i>Quis tulerit Gracchos?</i>  We think not.
In our opinion Mark Twain  is merely showing the prevalence of
the faults which he satirizes. He  wishes to remind us that,
whether we take Mr. Hingston's view or the  more natural one,
he is not the only untravellcd American in his party, and that he
is always on the look-out for incidents which may serve his
purpose. In this respect Mark Twain's travels remind us of
<i>The Book of Snobs, </i>where the fancy picture of the author
wholly eclipsed his characters.

<p>The character of American humor, and its want of
resemblance to the humor of Kamtschatka and Patagonia,
 --  will the reader forgive us if we fail to set down here
the thoughts suggested by these fresh and apposite topics? Will
he credit us with a self-denial proportioned to the vastness of
Mr. Clements's very amusing book, if we spare to state why he
is so droll, or  --  which is as much to the purpose  --
why we do not know? This reticence will leave us very little to
say by way of analysis; and, indeed, there is very little to say of
<i>The Innocents Abroad </i>which is not of the most obvious
and easy description. The idea of a steamer-load of Americans
going on a prolonged picnic to Europe and the Holy Land is
itself almost sufficiently delightful, and it is perhaps praise
enough for the author to add that it suffers nothing from his
handling. If one considers the fun of making a volume of six
hundred octavo pages upon this subject, in compliance with one
of the main conditions of a subscription book's success, bigness
namely, one has a tolerably fair piece of humor, without
troubling Mr. Clements further. It is out of the bounty and
abundance of his own nature that he is as amusing in the
execution as in the conception of his work. And it is always
good-humored humor, too, that he lavishes on his reader, and
even in its impudence it is charming; we do not remember
where it is indulged at the cost of the weak or helpless side, or
where it is insolent, with all its sauciness and irreverence. The
standard shams of travel which everybody sees through suffer
possibly more than they ought, but not so much as they might;
and one readily forgives the harsh treatment of them in
consideration of the novel piece of justice done on such a
traveller as suffers under the pseudonyme of Grimes. It is
impossible also that the quality of humor should not sometimes
be strained in the course of so long a narrative; but the wonder
is rather in the fact that it is strained so seldom.
</p><p>
Mr. Clements gets a good deal of his fun out of his
fellow-passengers, whom he makes us know pretty well,
whether he presents them somewhat caricatured, as in the case
of the "Oracle" of the ship, or carefully and exactly done, as in
the case of such a shrewd, droll, business-like, sensible, kindly
type of the American young man as "Dan."  We must say also
that the artist who has so copiously illustrated the volume has
nearly always helped the author in the portraiture of his
fellow-passengers, instead of hurting him, which is saying a
good deal for an artist; in fact, we may go further and apply the
commendation to all the illustrations; and this in spite of the
variety of figures in which the same persons are represented,
and the artist's tendency to show the characters on mules where
the author says they rode horseback.
</p><p>
Of course the instructive portions of Mr. Clements's book are
of a general rather than particular character, and the reader gets
as travel very little besides series of personal adventures and
impressions; he is taught next to nothing about the population
of the cities and the character of the rocks in the different
localities. Yet the man who can be honest enough to let himself
see the realities of human life everywhere, or who has only seen
Americans as they are abroad, has not travelled in vain and is
far from a useless guide. The very young American who told the
English officers that a couple of our gunboats could come and
knock Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea; the American who
at a French restaurant "talked very loudly and coarsely, and
laughed boisterously, where all others were so quiet and well
behaved," and who ordered "wine, sir!" adding, to raise
admiration in a country where wine is as much a matter of
course as soup, "I never dine without wine, sir"; the American
who had to be addressed several times as Gordon, being so
accustomed to hear the name pronounced Gorrdong, and who
had forgotten most English words during a three months'
sojourn in Paris; the Americans who pitilessly made a three
days' journey in Palestine within two days, cruelly overworking
the poor beasts they rode, and overtaxing the strength of their
comrades, in order not to break the Sabbath; the American
Pilgrims who travelled half round the world to be able to take
a sail on the Sea of Galilee, and then missed their sole
opportunity because they required the boatman to take them for
one napoleon when he wanted two;  --   these are all
Americans who are painted to peculiar advantage by Mr.
Clements, and who will be easily recognized by such as have
had the good fortune to meet them abroad.
</p><p>
The didactic, however, is not Mr. Clements's prevailing mood,
nor his best, by any means. The greater part of his book is in the
vein of irony, which, with a delicious impudence, he attributes
to Saint Luke, declaring that Luke, in speaking of the winding
"street, called Straight" in Damascus, "is careful not to commit
himself; he does not say it is the street which <i>is </i>straight,
but the  street which is <i>called </i>Straight.' It is a fine piece
of irony; it is the only facetious remark in the Bible, I believe."
At Tiberias our author saw the women who wear their dowry in
their head-dresses of coins. "Most of these maidens were not
wealthy, but some few have been kindly dealt with by fortune.
I saw heiresses there, worth, in their own right,  --  worth,
well, I suppose I might venture to say as much as nine dollars
and a half.  But such cases are rare. When you come across one
of these, she naturally puts on airs." He thinks the owner of the
horse "Jericho," on which he travelled towards Jerusalem, "had
a wrong opinion about him. He had an idea that he was one of
those fiery, untamed, steeds, but he is not of that character. I
know the Arab had this idea, because when he brought the horse
out for inspection in Beirout, he kept jerking at the bridle and
shouting in Arabic,  Ho! will you? Do you want to run away,
you ferocious beast, and break your neck?' when all the time the
horse was not doing anything in the world, and only looked like
he wanted to lean up against something and think. Whenever he
is not shying at things or reaching after a fly, he wants to do that
yet. How it would surprise his owner to know this!"  In this vein
of ironical drollery is that now celebrated passage in which Mr.
Clements states that he was affected to tears on coming, a
stranger in a strange land, upon the grave of a blood-relation,
 --  the tomb of Adam; but that passage is somewhat more
studied in tone than most parts of the book, which are written
with a very successful approach in style to colloquial drolling.
As Mr. Clements writes of his experiences, we imagine he
would talk of them; and very amusing talk it would be: often
not at all fine in matter or manner, but full of touches of humor,
 --  which if not delicate are nearly always easy,  --
and having a base of excellent sense and good feeling. There is
an amount of pure human nature in the book, that rarely gets
into literature; the depths of our poor unregeneracy  --
dubious even of the blissfulness of bliss  --  are sounded
by such a simple confession as Mr. Clements makes in telling
of his visit to the Emperor of Russia: "I would as soon have
thought of being cheerful in Abraham's bosom as in the palace
of an Emperor." Almost any topic, and any event of the author's
past life, he finds pertinent to the story of European and Oriental
travel, and if the reader finds it impertinent, he does not find it
the less amusing. The effect is dependent in so great degree
upon this continuous incoherence, that no chosen passage can
illustrate the spirit of the whole, while the passage itself loses
half in separation from the context. Nevertheless, here is part of
the account given by Mr. Clements of the Pilgrims' excursion to
the river Jordan, over roads supposed to be infested by
Bedouins; and the reader who does not think it droll as it stands
can go to our author for the <a name="1">rest</a>.

</p><p>
Under his <i>nom de plume</i> of Mark Twain, Mr. Clements
is well known to the very large world of newspaper-readers; and
this book ought to secure him something better than the
uncertain standing of a popular favorite. It is no business of ours
to fix his rank among the humorists California has given us, but
we think he is, in an entirely different way from all the others,
quite worthy of the company of the best.

<p>[These excerpts from newspaper reviews of <i>Innocents Abroad</i> were originally

</p>
<hr>

<p>From the Hartford (Ct.) Courant.

</p><p>That the odd genius who described the "Jumping Frog," should go to see and describe
the art-treasures of Europe and the ruins of Egypt and the Holy Land, has something in it very
comical. Mark Twain is a true Californian, with the original, quaint humor of the Pacific; a very
shrewd observer, not by any means unpoetical, but yet delighting to take the traditional poetry
out of things. You may be sure that if he went to Italy or Jerusalem he would not idealize, but
would try to photograph. His very exaggerations are all of the disenchanting sort, and are a very
fair set-off to the usual rhapsodies of most tourists, who see what they have been educated to
expect, and who have tradition so soaked into them that if they sat shivering in Naples in
January, with snow in the streets and ice in the fountains, they would write home about sunny,
delicious Italy. We doubt if the classic lands ever had exactly such a traveler through them as
Mark Twain, who went out on the famous Quaker City excursion to the Holy Land, with a lot of
passengers collected especially, it seemed to him, for the Holy Land, and this book is a dreadfully
real, also a whimsical record of what they did and what they didn't do and see, with sketches of
the pilgrims that all of them cannot regard with complacency. This record has been put into a
large and handsomely printed volume of 651-pages, illustrated with two hundred and thirty-four
cuts of various sorts, views from photographs, portraits, odd costumes, characters, scenes
occurring on shipboard and on land, grave, funny, absurd, but a very good accompaniment to the
text. The book has a great deal of entertainment in it. It has bits of excellent real description, and
when Twain tries to reproduce a scene or describe a place, he does it with wonderful faithfulness.
The author is not straining to be funny; he is not trying to make a joke book; and there is nothing
in it of that painfully unnatural sort of wit that is so wearisome. Very few will be able to read it
without laughing at least half the time. It may be absurd, but it certainly is funny. In the midst of
the most serious passages, some quaint observation is dropped that has a good deal of the quality
of the best humor. To attempt anything like a criticism of Mark Twain's peculiar humor, or to try
to explain why it is that he is able to make people laugh in spite of themselves, is unnecessary
now. The book is full of bright things, shrewd observations, that lurk here and there, and must be
read with the context to be appreciated.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the National (N.J.) Standard.

</p><p>This is the raciest book we have met with for many a day. Much as we had expected to
be pleased, we must truthfully say that we had no idea so much humor, wit, geniality, fine
description and good sense, could be contained within the covers of any one book. It is a splendid
book in every meaning of the word. It is readable, enjoyable, laughable; it is keen, satirical,
comical, and funny; its descriptions are beautiful, and its style is unique, and not of a common
stamp; its morals are of a high tone, and cannot be impeached; it will give the reader a new view
of the countries and people that it describes, showing them upon a side never before exposed. It
is not a book filled with caricature and stale jokes, but a clear, well-written volume upon most
interesting subjects, yet viewing them from an entirely new stand-point, and portraying them in
an original and characteristic manner. We turned over the pages, without selection of pieces, and
commenced reading, and invariably in less than two minutes we were boiling over with laughter.
Our sides ache, and we lay aside the volume to rest, and to advise our friends and readers, one
and all, to buy the book at the first opportunity, and read it through. It is full of excellent
illustrations, in fact, taken all in all, is the jolliest, pleasantest, most fascinating, and handsomest
volume we know of.

</p>
<hr>
<p>From the Meriden (Ct.) Republican.

</p><p>We hope our readers will purchase one new book just as soon as the Agent for this place
shall put in an appearance. We refer to Mark Twain's new book entitled the "New Pilgrim's
Progress." Mark Twain, always interesting, in this book has outrivaled himself. It is instructive,
humorous, racy, full of quaint expressions that make you laugh unexpectedly, and before you are
quite ready; critical, sometimes caustic, but always good natured; never prosy or wearisome. You
begin the book and do not want to leave it till the last line is reached. Mark never describes a
place, or sees a sight as others do. He is intensely original; and for us there is where the charm
lies. It is a work permanently adapted for home reading aloud, and will invariably call up around
the fireside a spirit of mirth and congeniality. No one can read its pages without feeling there is
still beauty and sunshine in the world.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New York Express.

</p><p>It is one of the most quaint and enjoyable books of travel that has been issued from the
press. Certainly, Mark Twain succeeds in dispelling many of the old traditions which travelers
have so long inflicted upon a confiding and long suffering public. He has gone over the ground
with a genuine Yankee spirit, determining to see everything that is to be seen, to see it thoroughly
and like a man of sense, to go into ecstacies [sic] over but few things, and to speak the plain,
unvarnished truth under all circumstances. And this truth is told to us in such a winsome form,
that we cannot but listen to it with agreeable sensations. Throughout runs an undercurrent of
genuine native humor. Not what we are so apt to accept as such, and which is principally
remarkable for its vulgarity and insipidity, but a real, crisp, tangible wit, that speaks in every line
of the vitality, the vigorous honesty of the man, and of how fully he is imbued with all the better
of the national characteristics. The book is a Golconda of wit and a very mine of sparkling
entertainment.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Newark (N.J.) Register.

</p><p>It is a rare and wonderful combination. The humor is natural, never forced; the narrative
is instructive, and the descriptive passages are some of the finest in the English language,
abounding in choice expressions and beautiful metaphor.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Winsted (Ct.) Herald.

</p><p>The book opens richer and richer with every leaf you turn. The next best thing to having
been one of this Holy Land excursion party, is to read this enchanting account of it. Indeed we
guess the book will afford more enjoyment, in proportion to the cost, than did the trip itself. The
book and the trip are just alike in one respect,--when you once get aboard you cannot get away
from it. Perhaps, however, there will be no danger in accompanying the author as far as off Sandy
Hook.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New York Leader.

</p><p>Twain's irony is delicious and far-reaching; his facetious satire penetrates the very soul
of appreciation. His drolleries are wickedly amusing. No one in full sympathy with humor can
read Mark Twain's best things and not laugh heartily over them. Of course his latest work is his
best, as it is his most elaborate effort.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Norwich Bulletin.

</p><p>If people don't stop laughing so immoderately in the dead hours of the night as to keep
their neighbors awake, there will probably be trouble, that's all. The cause is said to be Mark
Twain's new book, which everybody is reading. But that is no excuse.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New York Herald.

</p><p>The "Innocents Abroad" must be read to be thoroughly enjoyed. It is an oasis in the
desert of works on foreign travel, with which we are deluged at the present day. We have read it
through with pleasure, and if Mark Twain will do no worse in future efforts at Book Making, we
will always heartily welcome him at our desk.

</p>
<hr>
<p>From the Mohawk Valley Register.

</p><p>Buy it, and you will bless Mark Twain to the end of your existence.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Liberal Christian, N.Y.

</p><p>It is the record of a party on a holiday excursion, and every page is touched with the
mirth of the happy merry-makers, and in every paragraph you feel a giggle if you do not hear a
laugh. Here are no homilies; no essays on politics, no discussion of philosophies, or art, or
archaeology; yet the book preaches nevertheless, and is full of health and aglow with that
cheerful, hopeful, wholesome religion which has so much faith that it does not fear to crack a
joke or to make one. It tells a great deal that other and more serious writers consider it beneath
their dignity to tell, and it keeps striking the spear-point of its shrewd Yankee common sense into
the cracks and crevices of antique customs and institutions until we half expect a general
tumbling down of European civilization upon the Pilgrims' heads.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New York Evening Post.

</p><p>It contains many scenes of real merriment that few can read without laughter. The
cleverness, frankness, and catholic spirit of the writer are everywhere apparent.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Central Baptist, St. Louis, Mo.

</p>

<p>It abounds in historical and legendary lore, and written in the quaint and serio-comic strain
peculiar to the author, will readily recommend itself to the public.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New York Tribune.

</p><p>It is refreshing to find a tourist who does not care what other tourists have said before
him. Mark Twain must be rated as the chief representative of that peculiar kind of humor whose
principal elements are not bad spelling and verbal burlesque, for he does not practice these arts.
The greater part of his book is pure fun, and its freshness is wonderfully well sustained.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the True American, Trenton, N.J.

</p><p>The work abounds in historical facts, descriptions of different countries and important
personages, scenes and incidents, so bound together by wit, pleasantry and flashes of grotesque
humor, as to make one of the most readable and amusing books of the period.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Providence (R.I.) Morning Herald.

</p><p>He has described with his rare skill and in his best style, the adventures of the company,
as well as his own, which are among the best things in the book. He has left the beaten path of
tourists, and has never pretended an admiration which he did not feel, or which was yielded in
obedience merely to invariable custom. He claims to adhere to the truth and to facts, and in his
book has shorn many of the venerable shams of the old world of the false charms they have
pretended. The stand-point of the traveler is certainly new, and the book throughout bears the
impress of originality. The piquant humor and rare felicity of the text is well sustained by the
numerous engravings, upwards of two hundred in number, with which the book is embellished.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Providence (R.I.) Journal.

</p><p>The book is funny clear through; and if any doubt that fun can be sustained through so
many pages, they can be cured by entering their names upon the subscription list.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Norwich (Ct.) Daily Advertiser.

</p><p>The drollest, funniest, most truthful and readable book of the season is Mark Twain's
account of the pleasure trip of a party on the Quaker City, up the Mediterranean. The writer sees
the humorous side of every thing, or gives a humorous side to serious things, but is not lacking in
power to be sober and wise, and even eloquent, when those qualities seem necessary for effect. If
any one wants a book that will really interest and instruct him about one of the most remarkable
portions of the earth, and at the same time to keep in rollicking good humor, he cannot afford to
be without this book.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New York Times.

</p><p>About one-third of this pleasant book is given to the sacred parts of Asia Minor and
Egypt--showing the mental proclivity of the majority on board the Quaker City. The volume is a
large one of 650 pages, beautifully printed, and swarming with illustrations which, in their own
way, are as effective and amusing as the letter press. It is altogether a very taking book; and a
great many persons who would not care to read the graver accounts of travel through these
world-renowned places, will find themselves very much interested in Mark Twain's humorous
way of getting over the same ground.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Rochester Chronicle.

</p><p>Twain's book is valuable for pricking many of the bubbles and exploding the humbugs
of European travel.

</p>

From the Newark (N.J.) Daily Advertiser.

</p><p>We have one earnest caution for our readers who may buy this book. The writers seeks
to rest your ribs by occassional [sic] fine passages of true eloquence, or sentiment, or sensible
description. But he does not succeed. The book must be taken in interrupted doses. There is more
fun in it than it is safe to swallow at once.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Hartford (Ct.) Times.

</p><p>We are indebted to the publishers for a copy of a new and really unique volume of
travels by that rollicking humorist, "Mark Twain." It is a lively, laughter-exciting book, such as
one rarely meets among volumes of travels; yet the fun is not the only feature of the book. It
abounds in interesting information, conveyed in a wide range of facts, adventures, and personal
experiences. It is fresh, racy and sparkling as a glass of iced champagne, and a good deal better
for the health and digestion. Seated under a shady tree, with this instructive picture book before
him, one can, in most moods, be better entertained than with a living companion. It gives us
living scenes and pictures of life and experience in far distant lands, so graphically portrayed that
the book will make an attractive addition to the treasures of the library and the drawing-table, for
the benefit of one's self or friends in a winter evening. Everybody should buy and read it.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New Jersey Journal.

</p><p>Criticism of the work is almost impossible; as sufficient gravity of countenance for the
purpose, can hardly be maintained over the volume. To think of, or look at it, is to smile, but to
read it is to overwhelm all criticism with uncontrolable [sic] laughter. It is truly an original affair,
and does credit to its author. He treats of subjects of which we supposed we were fully
acquainted in such a manner that we come to the conclusion finally that we are swallowing
sugar-coated statistics,--and are aware that we are digesting much useful and important
information,--learning facts we never knew before,--getting glimpses of scenes and places from
entirely new stand-points, and catching new and quaint ideas, expressed in the most original and
funny manner. Altogether the book is a good one; one we can heartily recommend to our readers.
It is pure in morals, and just the thing for fire-side reading. Buy this Book, say we, and, our word
for it, you will not regret the outlay.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Springfield (Mass.) Union.

</p><p>This is one of the most readable and entertaining books of the season. For years the
quaint humor of Mark Twain has enlivened the columns of the newspapers, and few readers
finish a column of his correspondence without wishing, like Oliver Twist, for more. The present
volume, while brimfull [sic] of humor in almost every page, is by no means a mere jest book, but
contains more information in regard to the places visited by the "Pilgrims" than would be
gathered from many dry books of travel. It is profusely illustrated, and the views, which profess
to be real, are authentic and well-executed; while the comic and fancy sketches aptly illustrate the
drollery of the text.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Springfield (Mass.) Republican.

</p><p>Mr. Clemens brings to his work a free spirit, a lively fancy and an indescribable
emancipation from old trammels of thought and feeling. He is as different from the stock traveler
as he is from Montague or Bunyan's Pilgrim,--sees things that nobody else saw, says things that
nobody else ever thought of saying, and throws over his whole work the charm of an uncouth
freshness.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New York World.

</p><p>No American book of travels contains so much genuine fun. It aims to entertain and it
does. There is a genuine American tone about it which is refreshing to see after the snobberies of
some other American travelers.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the New York Sun.

</p><p>He pricks a great many bubbles blown by previous travelers, both in print and out of it;
and where anything seemed to him an imposition or a delusion, he bluntly says so. One cannot
read half a dozen pages of the book without enjoying as many hearty laughs at droll fancies of the
author and the comical tint which he gives to every picture. Aside from its mirth the book
abounds in clear and graphic description, and now and then the author indulges in sentimental
writing and bursts of eloquence quite in contrast with his levity on other pages. Altogether this
book is both instructive and entertaining, which is more than can be said of all travelers' tales.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Paterson Daily Guardian, N.J.

</p><p>It is a large book, but a reading of a few pages is sufficient to convince the reader that
Mark is equal to it, and could stand a good deal larger one. The public could also.

</p>
<hr>
<hr>
<p>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.

</p><p>The author of this work during the past winter delivered in scores of cities in the West,
his popular lecture termed "The American Vandal Abroad," to large and delighted audiences. The
material for that lecture was drawn from this book, and is a fair specimen of its style and quality.
The lecture is spoken of in the following manner by the press:

</p>
<hr>
<p>At Cleveland, Ohio.

</p><p>LIBRARY ASSOCIATION--LECTURE OF "MARK TWAIN."--We shall attempt no
transcript of this lecture, lest with unskillful hands we mar its beauty, for beauty and poetry it
certainly possessed, though the production of a professed humorist.

</p><p>We know not which most to commend, the quaint utterances, the funny incidents, the
good-natured recital of the characteristics of his harmless "Vandal," or the gems of beautiful
description which sparkled all through his lecture. We expected to be amused, but we were taken
by surprise when he carried us on the wings of his redundant fancy, away to the ruins, the
cathedrals, and the monuments of the old world. There are some passages of gorgeous
word-painting which haunt us like a remembered picture. We congratulate Mr. Twain upon
having
taken the tide of public favor "at the flood" in the lecture field, and having conclusively proved
that a man may be a humorist without being a clown. He has elevated the profession by his
graceful delivery and by recognizing in his audience something higher than merely a desire to
laugh. We can assure the cities who are awaiting his coming, that a rich feast is in store for them,
and Cleveland is proud to offer him the first laurel leaf in his role as lecturer, this side the "Rocky
slope."

</p>
<hr>
<p>At Toledo, Ohio.

</p><p>MARK TWAIN'S LECTURE.--White's Hall was filled from cellar to garret, last night,
by one of the best tickled audiences that ever assembled there to hear a lecture or see the speaker.
Mark Twain tickled them. And he did it so easily and almost constantly, that they didn't know
what they were laughing at more than half the time. Twain is witty, and his wit comes from his
own fertile brain. His style is original; and his manner of speaking is not after the manner of men
generally. His serious face and long drawn words are, of themselves, sufficient to make one
laugh, even if there were not in every sentence expressed a sparkling gem of humor and original
idea. His anecdotes, with which the lecture is replete, are rich, and, as he tells them, irresistibly
funny. In some of his descriptions of European places and characters the lecturer delivers, at
times, most eloquent passages, brilliant in thought and word. That Mark Twain is a success as a
lecturer, as well as writer, we think no one who heard "The American Vandal Abroad," last night,
will dispute.

</p>
<hr>
<p>At Sharon, Penn.

</p><p>MARK TWAIN.--This combination of letters spells a name and designates a man for
whom we have the most intense veneration. We had the privilege and pleasure of hearing his
quaint and instructive lecture, the "American Vandal Abroad," on Saturday Evening last. A large
and appreciative audience greeted him, all anxious to hear and see the man who had placed
himself so high in their esteem by the many brilliant witticisms from time to time seized with
avidity by the public press, and through it placed before the world. Mr. Twain was heard and
admired. New and warm friends were added to his list and the old ones retained. Such a deep
interest was manifested in the lecture that at the close a general dissatisfaction was apparent that
he did not speak longer. It seemed too short, but upon consulting the time it was discovered to
the great surprise of all that he had talked one hour and a half. A sermon of the same dimensions
to the self-same audience would have found many dozing, and at the hour of high noon! The
lecture was a grand success. Everybody was pleased. He is about to issue a work of some six
hundred pages, "The Innocents Abroad, or the New Pilgrim's Progress."  We long to see it, and
predict for it an extensive sale.

</p>
<hr>
<p>At Chicago.

</p><p>"MARK TWAIN" ON THE SPHYNX [sic].--Among the gems of fine description in the
lecture of Mark Twain, Tuesday evening, that of the mysterious Sphynx thrilled his audience
with admiration.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Elmira, N.Y., Daily Gazette.

</p><p>MARK TWAIN'S NEW BOOK, "THE INNOCENTS ABROAD, OR THE NEW
PILGRIM'S PROGRESS."--Advance sheets of the new work have incidentally come under our
notice--and from them we are prepared to speak highly of Mr. Clemens' prospective book. It has
for its foundation a description of the sights and scenes of famous places abroad, while they are
treated in that peculiarly attractive vein of power and genuine humor, which has made him
widely famous, and placed him at the head of the witty writers of America. Mr. Clemens,
however, is something besides a literary humorist. There occurs in his writing a blending of
sentiment and thought as fine and striking as they are beautiful and sparkling--ideas as clear and
penetrating as his humor is fresh. From what we have seen of his new book we are led to believe
that it will do much towards advancing his reputation, and establish it on an enduring basis. That
it will be a success is already assured.

</p>
<hr>
<p>
From the Mohawk Valley, N.Y, Register.

</p><p>By a private note from "Mark Twain," we learn that he is about to issue his new book,
"The New Pilgrim's Progress," and then transform himself into a pilgrim again and start for
California. The first part of the information we hail with the utmost satisfaction, but we regret
that he is soon to leave the Atlantic coast. However, as many people will kill themselves with
laughter over his book, he might be subject here to the annoyance of frequent arrests for being
accessory before the fact to numerous cases of manslaughter. In California he would be safe
among his earlier friends, who know him better, and would let him off more easily.

MARK TWAIN'S NEW BOOK. What would the great old romantic voyagers and travellers, the
heroes of Hackluyt and Purchas, say of the monster Yankee picnic to Europe and the Holy Land?
I
think that if those worthies were to get hold of a copy of Mark Twain's account of the excursion,
there would be laughter in Elysium. At any rate, I can hardly believe it possible for an earthly
reader
 --  unless, indeed, like Charles Lamb's Scotchman, he is joke-proof  -- to peruse Twain's
new book, <i>The Innocents Abroad, </i>without "laughing consumedly." The work, however,
though rich in joke and jest is not, like Gilbert a Becket's dreary comic histories, a merely funny
book. On the contrary, it is a very full and matter-of-fact record of travel in Europe and the East,
delightfully flavored with humor and plentifully spiced with wit. Addison's sober citizen
complained
that there were too many plums and no suet in his pudding, but no one can say that Twain's
literary
pudding is wanting in suet or too full of plums.
</p><p>
Our author is not one of the "one-eyed travellers," mentioned by Whateley, who see "a great deal
of some particular class of objects, and are blind to all others," but a shrewd, quick-witted person,
who travelled with his eyes very wide open, and saw things as they were, not as they have been
described by poets and romancers. It is not, however, so much for its new, truthful and pleasant
pictures of Old World places and people, as for the delicious wit and humor scattered so freely
up
and down the book, that one praises and prizes <i>The Innocents Abroad. </i>And it is such
good
humor, too, most of it, and with all its freedom and riot, touching gently and lovingly all serious
things. I have been reading Fuller's <i>Pisgah Sight of Palestine,</i> and derived no little
amusement by comparing his descriptions of the Holy Land with Mark Twain's. Fuller, though as
pious and reverent as a saint, was a rare wit and humorist, and his book on Palestine is brimming
over with merry quibbles and jocular humor. Although some of Mark Twain's levities might have
displeased the witty old divine, I think that he would have laughed loud and long at the passage
concerning the tomb of Adam.
</p><p>
<i>The Innocents Abroad</i> is issued by the American Publishing Company of Hartford, and
is sold only by subscription. The Boston agents are George M. Smith & Co., No. 6 Tremont
Street.

<p>If any book of late years has so generally interested the press
of the country and received so extensive and favorable an
introduction to the public as has Mark Twain's <i>Innocents
Abroad, </i>since its appearance, we fail to remember the
instance. We gave to our readers last week, in a supplementary
sheet, some specimens of the notices we have found in our
exchanges. Numerous as were the excerpts here collected, they
represent but a fraction of what have fallen under our
observation, and the notable fact is, that, instead of the mere
mention so commonly accorded to a new book, almost every
journal has given it an unusually elaborate review, written not in
a simple spirit of courtesy, but evidentally with an inspiration of
interest excited by reading the work. The truth is, we believe,
that no one of an ordinary disposition of mind can dip into the
volume without being snared by a curious fascination. It is so
different from any narrative of travel that ever was written
before. The mere tickle of an ever pervading humor is not all
that makes it delightful, but that humor is like an atmosphere, in
which the old world scenes that so many tourists and travellers
have led us into, take on a new and altogether novel appearance,
so that we follow our droll excursionist from place to place as
eagerly as though we had never been carried to them by any
narrative before. It would be a great mistake to suppose that the
book is just a big package of Mark Twain's jokes, to be read with
laughter, and for the sake of laughter. It is the panorama of
Europe and the Holy Land as they were seen by one who went
abroad with no illusions; who carried about with him a shrewd
pair of American eyes, and used them to get his own impressions
of things, as they actually presented themselves, not as he had
been taught to expect them; who bore with him, moreover, as
acute an appreciation of sham and humbug as his sense of the
humorous and ludicrous was keen. What he saw he tells, and we
believe there is more true description in his book than in any
other of the kind that we have read. What is to be told soberly he
tells soberly, and with all the admiration or reverence that is due
to the subject. But he does like to wash off false colors, to scrape
away putty and varnish, to stick a pin into venerable moss grown
shams  --  and it is a perpetual delight to his reader to see
him do it in his droll, dry way. We have yet to find the person
who could open the book and willingly lay it down again, for,
certainly, it is not often that more or livelier entertainment can
be had in the same compass. The work has been published by
the American Publishing Company, at Hartford, and is sold by
agents who canvass for subscriptions.

<h2>AN ENTERTAINING ARTICLE</h2>

<p>I take the following paragraph from an article in the Boston
"Advertiser":

</p><p>AN ENGLISH CRITIC ON MARK TWAIN.--
</p><p>Perhaps the most successful flights of the humor of
Mark Twain have been descriptions of the persons who did not
appreciate his humor at all.  We have become familiar with the
Californians who were thrilled with terror by his burlesque of
a newspaper reporter's way of telling a story, and we have heard
of the Pennsylvania clergyman who sadly returned his
"Innocents Abroad" to the book-agent with the remark that "the
man who could shed tears over the tomb of Adam must be an
idiot."  But Mark Twain may now add a much more glorious
instance to his string of trophies.  The "Saturday Review," in its
number of October 8, reviews his book of travels, which has
been republished in England, and reviews it seriously.  We can
imagine the delight of the humorist in reading this tribute to his
power; and indeed it is so amusing in itself that he can hardly
do better than reproduce the article in full in his next monthly
Memoranda.
</p><p>(Publishing the above paragraph thus gives me a sort
of authority for reproducing the "Saturday Review's" article in
full in these pages.  I dearly wanted to do it, for I cannot write
anything half so delicious myself.  If I had a cast-iron dog that
could read this English criticism and preserve his austerity, I
would drive him off the doorstep.--EDITOR MEMORANDA.)

</p><p>
REVIEWS OF NEW BOOKS.
</p><p>
THE INNOCENTS ABROAD.  A Book of Travels.  By<lb>
Mark Twain.  London: Hotten, publisher.  1870.
</p><p>
Lord Macaulay died too soon.  We never felt this so deeply as
when we finished the last chapter of the above-named
extravagant work.  Macaulay died too soon--for none but he
could mete out complete and comprehensive justice to the
insolence, the impertinence, the presumption, the mendacity,
and, above all, the majestic ignorance of this author.
</p><p>To say that the "Innocents Abroad" is a curious book,
would be to use the faintest language--would be to speak of the
Matterhorn as a neat elevation, or of Niagara as being "nice" or
"pretty."  "Curious" is too tame a word wherewith the describe
the imposing insanity of this work.  There is no word that is
large enough or long enough.  Let us, therefore, photograph a
passing glimpse of book and author, and trust the rest to the
reader.  Let the cultivated English student of human nature
picture to himself this Mark Twain as a person capable of doing
the following-described things--and not only doing them, but
with incredible innocence <i>printing them</i> calmly and
tranquilly in a book.  For instance:
</p><p>He states that he entered a hair-dresser's in Paris to get
shaved, and the first "rake" the barber gave with his razor it
<i>loosened his "hide" and lifted him out of his chair</i>.
</p><p>This is unquestionably exaggerated.  In Florence he
was so annoyed by beggars that he pretends to have seized and
eaten one in a frantic spirit of revenge.  There is of course no
truth in this.  He gives at full length a theatrical programme
seventeen or eighteen hundred years old, which he professes to
have found in the ruins of the Coliseum, among the dirt and
mould and rubbish.  It is a sufficient comment upon this
statement to remark that even a cast iron programme would not
have lasted so long under such circumstances.  In Greece he
plainly betrays both fright and flight upon one occasion, but
with frozen effrontery puts the latter in this falsely tame form:
"We <i>sidled</i> toward the Piraeus."  "Sidled," indeed!  He
does not hesitate to intimate that at Ephesus, when his mule
strayed from the proper course, he got down, took him under
his arm, carried him to the road again, pointed him right,
remounted, and went to sleep contentedly till it was time to
restore the beast to the path once more.  He states that a
growing youth among his ship's passengers was in the constant
habit of appeasing his hunger with soap and oakum between
meals.  In Palestine he tells of ants that came eleven miles to
spend the summer in the desert and brought their provisions
with them; yet he shows by his description of the country that
the feat was an impossibility.  He mentions, as if it were the
most commonplace of matters, that he cut a Moslem in two in
broad daylight in Jerusalem, with Godfrey de Bouillon's sword,
and would have shed more blood <i>if he had had a graveyard
of his own</i>.  These statements are unworthy a moment's
attention.  Mr. Twain or any other foreigner who did such a
thing in Jerusalem would be mobbed, and would infallibly lose
his life.  But why go on?  Why repeat more of his audacious
and exasperating falsehoods?  Let us close fittingly with this
one: he affirms that "in the mosque of St. Sophia at
Constantinople I got my feet so stuck up with a complication of
gums, slime, and general impurity, that <i>I wore out more
than two thousand pair of bootjacks</i> getting my books off
that night, and even then some Christian hide peeled off with
them."  It is monstrous.  Such statements are simply
<i>lies</i>--there is no other name for them.  Will the reader
longer marvel at the brutal ignorance that pervades the
American nation when we tell him that we are informed upon
perfectly good authority that this extravagant compilation of
falsehoods, this exhaustless mine of stupendous lies, this
"Innocents Abroad," has actually been adopted by the schools
and colleges of several of the States as a text-book!
</p><p>But if his falsehoods are distressing, his innocence and
his ignorance are enough to make one burn the book and
despise the author.  In one place he was so appalled at the
sudden spectacle of a murdered man, unveiled by the
moonlight, that he jumped out of window, going through sash
and all, and then remarks with the most childlike simplicity that
he "was not scared, but was considerably agitated."  It puts us
out of patience to note that the simpleton is densely
unconscious that Lucrezia Borgia ever existed off the stage.  He
is vulgarly ignorant of all foreign languages, but is frank
enough to criticize the Italians' use of their own tongue.  He
says they spell the name of their great painter "Vinci, but
pronounce it Vinchy"--and then adds with a naivete possible
only to helpless ignorance, "<i>foreigners always spell better
than they pronounce</i>."  In another place he commits the
bald absurdity of putting the phrase "tare an ouns" into an
Italian's mouth.  In Rome he unhesitatingly believes the legend
that St. Philip Neri's heart was so inflamed with divine love that
it burst his ribs--believes it wholly because an author with a
learned list of university degrees strung after his name endorses
it--"otherwise," says this gentle idiot, "I should have felt a
curiosity to know what Philip had for dinner."  Our author
makes a long, fatiguing journey to the Grotto del Cane on
purpose to test its poisoning powers on a dog--got elaborately
ready for the experiment, and then discovered that he had no
dog.  A wiser person would have kept such a thing discreetly to
himself, but with this harmless creature everything comes out.
He hurts his foot in a rut two thousand years old in exhumed
Pompeii, and presently, when staring at one of the cinder-like
corpses unearthed in the next square, conceives the idea that
may be it is the remains of the ancient Street Commissioner,
and straightway his horror softens down to a sort of chirpy
contentment with the condition of things.  In Damascus he
visits the well of Ananias, three thousand years old, and is as
surprised and delighted as a child to find that the water is "as
pure and fresh as if the well had been dug yesterday."  In the
Holy Land he gags desperately at the hard Arabic and Hebrew
Biblical names, and finally concludes to call them
Baldwinsville, Williamsburgh, and so on, "<i>for convenience
of spelling!</i>"
</p><p>We have spoken thus freely of this man's stupefying
simplicity and innocence, but we cannot deal similarly with his
colossal ignorance.  We do not know where to begin.  And if
we knew where to begin, we certainly would not know where
to leave off.  We will give one more specimen, and one only.
He did not know, until he got to Rome, that Michael Angelo
was dead!  And then, instead of crawling away and hiding his
shameful ignorance somewhere, he proceeds to express a pious,
grateful sort of satisfaction that he is gone and out of his
troubles!
</p><p>No, the reader may seek out the author's exhibitions of
his uncultivation for himself.  The book is absolutely
dangerous, considering the multitude and variety of its
misstatements, and the convincing confidence with which they
are made.  And yet it is a text-book in the schools of America.
</p><p>The poor blunderer mouses among the sublime
creations of the Old Masters, trying to acquire the elegant
proficiency in art-knowledge, which he has a groping sort of
comprehension is a proper thing for the travelled man to be
able to display.  But what is the manner of his study?  And
what is the progress he achieves?  To what extent does he
familiarize himself with the great pictures of Italy, and what
degree of appreciation does he arrive at?  Read:
<blockquote>
When we see a monk going about with a lion and looking up
into heaven, we know that that is St. Mark.  When we see a
monk with a book and a pen, looking tranquilly up to heaven,
trying to think of a word, we know that that is St. Matthew.
When we see a monk sitting on a rock, looking tranquilly up to
heaven, with a human skull beside him, and without other
baggage, we know that that is St. Jerome.  Because we know
that he is always flying light in the matter of baggage.  When
we see other monks looking tranquilly up to heaven, but having
no trade-mark, we always ask who those parties are.  We do
this because we humbly wish to learn.
</blockquote>
</p><p>He then enumerates the thousands and thousands of
copies of these several pictures which he has seen, and adds
with accustomed simplicity that he feels encouraged to believe
that when he has seen "SOME MORE" of each, and had a larger
experience, he will eventually "begin to take an absorbing
interest in them"--the vulgar boor.
</p><p>That we have shown this to be a remarkable book, we
think no one will deny.  That it is a pernicious book to place in
the hands of the confiding and uninformed, we think we have
also shown.  That the book is a deliberate and wicked creation
of a diseased mind, is apparent upon every page.  Having
placed our judgment thus upon record, let us close with what
charity we can, by remarking that even in this volume there is
some good to be found; for whenever the author talks of his
own country and lets Europe alone, he never fails to make
himself interesting; and not only interesting, but instructive.
No one can read without benefit his occasional chapters and
paragraphs, about life in the gold and silver mines of California
and Nevada; about the Indians of the plains and deserts of the
West, and their cannibalism; about the raising of vegetables in
kegs of gunpowder by the aid of two or three teaspoonfuls of
guano; about the moving of small farms from place to place at
night in wheelbarrows to avoid taxes; and about a sort of cows
and mules in the Humboldt mines, that climb down chimneys
and disturb the people at night.  These matters are not only
new, but are well worth knowing.* It is a pity the author did not
put in more of the same kind.  His book is well-written and is
exceedingly entertaining, and so it just barely escaped being
quite valuable also.
</p>
<p>*Yes, I calculated they were pretty new.  I invented them myself.--MARK TWAIN.

Mr. Samuel L. Clemens, who is known to many of us, and
ought to be known to all of us, as Mark Twain, was one of the
passengers on the <i>Quaker City </i>when she took her
ill-assorted party of excursionists to Europe and the East, and
he has just given us, in a thick book of more than six hundred
pages, a record of the tour. It might better have been a thinner
book, for there is some dead wood in it, as there has to be in all
books which are sold by book-agents and are not to be bought
in  stores. The rural-district reader likes to see that he has got
his money's worth even more than he likes wood-engravings.
At least, such is the faith in Hartford; and no man ever saw a
book-agent with a small volume in his hand.
</p><p>
But if some of the book is needless, none of it is really poor,
and much of it very good. Mr. Clemens's plan of delivering an
unvarnished tale, of giving just his own impressions of what he
saw, at once made his work sure of some real value as well as
much freshness, and his book is one to be commended merely
as a book of travels. But, of course, the "American humor" is
the great thing. It is not in the light of  a traveller that one
regards a gentleman who when during his wanderings in the
Holy Land he comes upon the "tomb of Adam," which the
monks exhibit, thus gives utterance to a natural burst of
sentiment:
</p>
<p>

</p><p>
All the prominent characteristics of our peculiar school of
humorists  --  their audacity, their extravagance and
exaggeration  --  Mr. Clemens displays in fulness in the
course of his ramblings, and he has some  merits which belong
to his individual self, and which make him a very agreeable
companion when he is at ease and natural  --  which is not
always; for as he pads so, we must make free to tell him, does
he sometimes grimace, and is professionally a humorist as he
was  professionally a book-maker. It will be a just punishment
for him to reflect that no doubt many a farmer will read all his
jokes  --  the good ones as well as these bad ones we are
speaking to him about  --  with profound gravity and
unshaking belief in them as so much serious log-book.
</p><p>
There is, besides those we have mentioned, another
characteristic of "American humor," which consists in a certain
sort of what may be called fatuousness. When the man in the
stage-coach, riding along with "the great moral showman"
without knowing him, kept on telling him, "some of Artemus
Ward's jokes," and at the end of each one of them punched his
companion in the side and said, "What a damned fool the
fellow is!" he was not the worst critic that Artemus ever had.
NearIy all his jokes have in them a display of mental
helplessness  --  not to say imbecility  --  a drifting
along of the mind from one topic to another, suggested but not
really connected, topic, and are largely dependent upon this for
their humorous effect. The same thing may be seen  --
though not nearly so unmixed nor so often  --  in the
efforts of Mr. Josh Billings. The humor in the Nasby Papers
consists rather in Mr. Locke's conception of the low,
"dough-face" Democrat than in anything strictly humorous that
is said or done by him after he is made, and the Cross-roads
pastor and postrmaster gives no exhibition of the trait
mentioned. But the author of <i>The Innocents Abroad
</i>has some of it  --  though something of what he has
is acquired and imitative, we should say  --  and may be
taken to be rather more nearly Artemus Ward's successor in this
line than either of the other humorists to whom we have
referred.  </p>

Six hundred and fifty pages of open and declared fun  --
very strongly accented with wood-cuts at that  --  might
go far toward frightening the fastidious reader. But the Hartford
publishers, we imagine, do not print for the fastidious reader,
nor do traveling book agents sell much to that rarely occurring
man, who prefers to find books rather than let them find
<i>him. So </i> that, unless he has already made "Mark
Twain's" acquaintance through the press, he will not probably
meet him until, belated in the rural districts, he takes from the
parlor table of a country farm-house an illustrated Bible,
Greeley's <i>American Conflict, </i>Mr. Parton's apocryphal
<i>Biographies, </i>successively and listlessly, and so comes
at last upon "Mark Twain's" <i>Innocents </i>like a joyous
revelation  --  an Indian spring in an alkaline literary
desert. For the book has that intrinsic worth of bigness and
durability which commends itself to the rural economist, who
likes to get a material return for his money. It is about the size
of <i>The Family Physician, </i>for which it will doubtless be
often mistaken  --  with great advantage to the patient.
The entire six hundred and fifty pages are devoted to an
account of the "steamship <i>Quaker City's</i> excursion to
Europe and the Holy Land," with a description of certain
famous localities of which a great many six hundred and fifty
pages have been, at various times, written by various tourists.
Yet there is hardly a line of Mr. Clemens' account that is not
readable; and none the less, ccrtainly, from the fact that he
pokes fun at other tourists, and that the reader becomes dimly
conscious that Mr. Clemens' fellow-passengers would have
probably estopped this gentle satirist from going with them
could they have forecast his book. The very title<i>  --
The Innocents Abroad  --  is </i>a suggestive hint of the
lawlessness and audacity in which the trip is treated. We shall
not stop to question the propriety of this feature: it is only just
to Mr. Clemens to say, that the best satirists have generally
found their quarry in thc circle in which they moved, and
among their best friends; but we contend that if he has, by this
act, choked off and prevented the enthusiastic chronicling of
the voyage by any of his fellow-passengers, who may have been
sentimentally inclined, he is entitled to the consideration of a
suffering world; and it shall stand in extenuation of some
mannerism that is only slang, some skepticism that lacks the
cultivation which only makes skepticism tolerable, and some
sentiment that is only rhetoric. And so, with an irreverence for
his fellow-pilgrims which was equaled only by his scorn for
what they admired, this hilarious image-breaker started upon
his mission. The situation was felicitous, the conditions perfect
for the indulgence of an humor that seems to have had very
little moral or esthetic limitation. The whole affair was a huge
practical joke, of which not the least amusing feature was the
fact that "Mark Twain" had embarked in it. Before the
<i>Quaker</i> <i>City</i> reached Fayal, the first
stopping-place, he had worked himself into a grotesque rage at
every thing and every body. In this mock assumption of a
righteous indignation, lies, we think, the real power of the
book, and the decided originality of Mr. Clemens' humor. It
enables him to say his most deliberately funny things with all
the haste and exaggeration of rage; it gives him an opportunity
to invent such epithets as "animated outrage," and
"spider-legged gorilla," and apply them, with no sense of
personal responsibility on the part of reader or writer. And the
rage is always ludicrously disproportionate to the cause. It is
"Mr. Boythorn," without his politeness, or his cheerful
intervals. For, when "Mark Twain" is not simulating
indignation, he is <i>really </i>sentimental. He shows it in
fine writing  --  in really admirable rhetoric, vigorous and
picturesque  --  but too apt, at times, to suggest the
lecturing attitude, or the reporter's flourish. Yet it is so much
better than what one had any right to expect, and is such an
agreeable relief to long passages of extravagant humor, that the
reader is very apt to overlook the real fact, that it is often quite
as extravagant.  Yet, with all his independence, "Mark Twain"
seems to have followed his guide and guidebooks with a
simple, unconscious fidelity. He was quite content to see only
that which every body else sees, even if he was not content to
see it with the same eyes. His record contains no new facts or
features of the countries visited. He has always his own
criticism, his own comments, his own protests, but always
concerning the same old facts. Either from lack of time or
desire, he never stepped out of the tread-mill round of "sights."
His remarks might have been penciled on the margins of
Murray. This is undoubtedly a good way to correct the
enthusiasm or misstatements of other tourists; but is, perhaps,
hardly the best method of getting at the truth for one's self. As
a conscientious, painstaking traveler, "Mark Twain," we fear,
is not to be commended. But that his book would have been as
amusing, if he had been, is a matter of doubt.  Most of the
criticism is just in spirit, although extravagant, and often too
positive in style. But it should be remembered that the style
itself is a professional exaggeration, and that the irascible
pilgrim, "Mark Twain," is a very eccentric creation of Mr.
Clemens'. We can, perhaps, no more fairly hold Mr. Clemens
responsible for "Mark Twain's" irreverence than we could have
held the late Mr. Charles F. Browne to account for "Artemus
Ward's" meanness and humbuggery. There may be a question
of taste in Mr. Clemens permitting such a man as "Mark
Twain" to go to the Holy Land at all; but we contend that such
a traveler would be more likely to report its external aspect
truthfully than a man of larger reverence. And are there not
Lamartines, Primes, and unnumbered sentimental and pious
pilgrims to offset these losel skeptics  --  or, as our author
would say, such "animated outrages"  --  as Ross Browne,
Swift, "Mark Twain," <i>et al</i>.
</p>
<p>To subject Mr. Clemens to any of those delicate tests by
which we are supposed to detect the true humorist, might not
be either fair or convincing. He has caught, with great
appreciation and skill, that ungathered humor and extravagance
which belong to pioneer communities  --  which have
been current in bar-rooms, on railways, and in stages  --
and which sometimes get crudely into literature, as "a fellow
out West says." A good deal of this is that picturesque Western
talk which we call "slang," in default of a better term for
inchoate epigram. His characters speak naturally, and in their
own tongue. If he has not it that balance of pathos which we
deem essential to complete humor, he has something very like
it in that serious eloquence to which we have before alluded.
Like all materialists, he is an honest hater of all cant  --
except, of course, the cant of materialism  --  which, it is
presumed, is perfectly right and proper. To conclude: after a
perusal of this volume, we see no reason for withholding the
opinion we entertained before taking it up, that Mr. Clemens
deserves to rank foremost among Western humorists; and, in
California, above his only rival, "John Phoenix," whose fun,
though more cultivated and spontaneous,  lacked the sincere
purpose and larger intent of "Mark Twain's."

<i>The Innocents Abroad; or, The New Pilgrim's Progress,</i> is the title of Mark Twain's latest
appearance between covers. The book is a ponderous one, containing over 650 pages, splendidly
illustrated, and produced in the best style of art by the American Publishing Company, of
Hartford.
No ordinary "notice" can do justice to this work. In the language of many others, "it must be seen
(and read) to be appreciated." It is a curious account of the famous Quaker City pleasure trip to
the
Mediterranean and the Holy Land, which was conceived by and executed under command of
Captain
Duncan, in the summer of 1867. There were many intelligent sight-seers among "the innocents";
but
few, we are inclined to believe, who got as much out of the trip as did the author of this book.
Mark
Twain is a born journalist, besides being at the present time first among American humorists. It
is,
indeed, doubtful if he has ever had an equal; he certainly has not had in his line  --  that of dry,
self-contained, unobtrusive and pervading fun. There is no glare in his emanations  --  no
blinding coruscations of wit, which, flashing suddenly upon you, as suddenly go out, leaving you
in
darkness and uncertainty; no apparent striving after sharp effects; no digging in poor soil for
poorer
puns. What is said is most naturally said, and if there is humor in it, it is because the writer could
not
express it otherwise. Whatever may be the quality of the wine which fills your glass, you never
feel
that it is being drawn from an empty cask, or that its flavor is at all dependent upon the
abundance
of its supply. When Mr. Beecher was reprimanded for saying so many funny things in the pulpit,
he
replied, "Oh, but if you only knew the number of funny things I do not say!" And this is the
impression left upon the reader of Mark Twain. Whatever good things he may choose to fasten
with
his pen, one cannot but feel that his best things are yet untold. There is one species of poor wit
that
Mark has not yet found it necessary to attempt, and we trust he never will, and that is poor
orthography and worse grammar. It is not to be denied that a telling point may sometimes be
made
by a violent assault upon the barriers of "good English." Artemus Ward achieved some glory in
this
field; and his literary successor, Josh Billings, sometimes unearths a nugget; but the game thus
far
has not been worth the candle, and we doubt if it ever will be. At all events, Mark Twain has no
such
weak necessity, and we are glad of it. Some portions of the book are devoted to correct,
unexaggerated descriptions of the country, and matters requiring historical accuracy; but there is
no
pretence, other than of a humorous and extravagant account of a memorable voyage. There will
be
those who will see in the descriptions of the Holy Land a conspicuous lack of reverence for
sacred
associations, and the contrast between this and ordinary guide-books will not need to be pointed
out;
but the artistic and effectual disposal of the romantic tales of tourists, which have enveloped
these
scenes with a mysterious beauty and awe not to be penetrated or approached, will be at least
satisfactory to the matter-of-fact reader.

Here is his quiet style of getting down from a high state of mental exhilaration to every-day

Every traveller on the Continent has met the American tourist, and  formed some opinion of his
merits. We do not speak of that variety of  American who comes over to spend five or six years
in
Europe and finds himself rather more at home on the Parisian boulevards than on the New York
Broadway. Nor do we refer to the Americans who have been too highly cultivated to obtrude
their
national peculiarities upon us in any disagreeable form. There is no pleasanter acquaintance than
the
gentleman, or still more the lady, of this class who has just enough American flavour to be
amusingly
original. But, besides these types, the United States are kind enough to provide us with a vast
number
of travellers corresponding in refinement and intelligence to Mr. Cook's tourists. They are the
people
who do Europe in six weeks, and throw in the Holy Land and Egypt to fill up their spare time.
They
are gloriously ignorant of any language but their own, supremely contemptuous of every country
that
had no interest in thc Declaration of Independence,  and occasionally, it must be admitted, as
offensive as the worst kind of Cockney tourist, whilst even less inclined to hide their light under
a
bushel. Comparing them with the most nearly analogous class of British  travellers, it is rather
hard
to determine which should have the  preference. The American is generally the noisier and more
actively disagreeable, but, on the other hand, he often partly redeems his absurdity by a certain
naivete and half-conscious humour. He is often laughing in his sleeve at his own preposterous
brags,
and does not take himself quite so seriously as his British rival. He is vulgar, and even
ostentatiously
and atrociously vulgar; but the vulgarity is mixed with a real shrewdness which rescues it from
simple insipidity. We laugh at him, and we would rather not have too much of his company; but
we
do not feel altogether safe in despising him. We may save ourselves the trouble of any further
attempts at description by quoting a few illustrative passages from the book before us. Mr. Mark
Twain, as the author chooses to call himself, is a Californian humourist after the fashion of
Artemus
Ward. He came to Europe on a grand excursion trip, and describes his impressions of France and
Italy in the true tourist style. He parades his utter ignorance of Continental languages and
manners,
and expresses his very original judgments on various wonders of art and nature with a
praiseworthy
frankness. We are sometimes left in doubt whether he is speaking in all sincerity, or whether he
is
having a sly laugh at himself and his readers. To do him justice, however, we must observe that
he
has a strong tinge of the peculiar national humour; and, though not equal to the best performers
on
the same instrument, manages to be an amusing representative of his class. The dry joke, which
apes
seriousness, is a favourite device of his countrymen; and Mr. Mark Twain is of course not as
simple
as he affects to be. We merely say this to guard ourselves against the imputation of taking a
professional jester seriously; but, whether he speaks in downright earnest or with a
half-concealed
twinkle of the eye, his remarks will serve equally well as an illustration of the genuine
unmistakable
convictions of many of his countrymen.
</p><p>
Without further preface we will quote some of Mr. Twain's remarks upon foreign countries. And,
first of all, he exhibits that charming ignorance of all languages but English which is so common
amongst his fellows. French newspapers, he tells us, "have a strange fashion of telling a perfectly
straight story till you get to the  nub' of it, and then a word drops in that no man can translate, and
that story is ruined." He is seriously aggrieved by the names of places, and says that the nearest
approach which anybody can make to the true pronunciation of Dijon is "demijohn." The spelling
is not much assistance under such circumstances. Speaking of a certain distinguished artist, he
observes, "they spell it Vinci, and pronounce it Vinchy; foreigners always spell better than they
pronounce." Gentlemen who labour under this difficulty of communicating with the natives
naturally
fall into the hands of guides, and Mr. Twain and his friends appear to have suffered terribly from
the
persons whom they hired to take them to the sights of foreign towns. Their system on arriving at
any
large place was to engage a <i>valet de place, </i>whom they always called "Ferguson," to save
the
trouble of pronouncing a new name, and were carried about as helpless victims to such places as
he
preferred, besides having to swallow his stories. They took a characteristic revenge, which
appears
to have afforded them immense satisfaction. The way to bully your guide is to affect a profound
ignorance  --  if you have not got it naturally  --  and a stony indifference to his
information. They therefore told off a gentleman called the Doctor, to ask questions of the said
guide,
because he could "look more like an inspired idiot, and throw more imbecility into the tone of his
voice, than any man that lives. It comes natural to him." Thus, for example, it was assumed that
as
Americans they would take a special interest in an autograph letter of Columbus. The Doctor,
after
asking some irrelevant questions, pronounced it the worst specimen of handwriting he ever saw,
and
added, "If you have got any specimens of penmanship of real merit, trot them out; and, if you
haven't,
drive on." The guide, we are told, was "considerably shaken up." On the same principle, when
shown
an Egyptian monument, the Doctor asked indignantly, "What is the use of imposing your vile
secondhand carcases on us? If you've got a nice fresh corpse, fetch him out! or, by George, we'll
brain you." The most irritating question you can put to such a guide is to ask concerning any
distinguished character to whom he refers  --  such, for example, as Columbus or Michael
Angelo  --  "Is he dead?" And this seems to have met with such success that Mr. Twain scarcely
restrained his companions from putting the inquiry to a monk in a Capuchin convent, who
showed
them some of the personal remains of his predecessors.
</p><p>We may imagine the temper in which some of the remarkable sights of the Old World
would be
contemplated under such circumstances. Mr. Twain, indeed, was much impressed by the
cathedral
at Milan. The bill for mere workmanship, he says, "foots up six hundred and eighty-four millions
of
francs, thus far (considerably over a hundred millions of dollars), and it is estimated that it will
take
a hundred and twenty years yet to finish the cathedral." When he gets to St. Peter's, however, he
declares that it did not look nearly so large as the capitol at Washington, and certainly not a
twentieth
part as beautiful from the outside. Even natural wonders are generally surpassed by their rivals in
the
United States. The Lake of Como, for example, is pronounced to be very inferior to Lake Tahoe.
In
clearness it is not to be compared to it. "I speak," he says, "of the north shore of Lake Tahoe,
where
we can count the scales on a trout at a depth of 180 feet."  Mr. Twain, however, feels constrained
to
add, "I have tried to get this statement off at par here, but with no success; so I have been obliged
to negotiate it at fifty per cent. discount." Tahoe, we may explain in passing, for the benefit of
philological readers, is Indian for grasshopper soup  --  so, at least, Mr. Twain believes. The
objects, however, against which Mr. Twain feels a special indignation, to which he tells us he is
bound to give vent in spite of the remonstrances of his friends, are pictures by the old masters.
The
old masters irritate him incessantly; and the apparent reason of his objection is characteristic.
"Wherever you  find a Raphael, a Rubens, a Michael Angelo, &c.," he says, "you find  artists
copying
them, and the copies are always the handsomest. Maybe the originals were handsome when they
were new, but they are not now."  He "harbours no animosity" against the deluded persons who
think
otherwise; but he regards them as about as wise as men who should stand opposite a desert of
charred stumps and say, What a noble forest!   Michael Angelo appears to have been a special
annoyance to him. "I never felt so fervently thankful," he exclaims, "so soothed, so tranquil, so
filled
with a blessed peace, as I did yesterday, when I leamt that Michael Angelo was dead." One would
rather like to know how many of Mr. Cook's tourists share this feeling in their hearts, if they only
dared to avow their ignorance with an equally touching frankness. Mr. Twain took his revenge by
asking the wretched "Ferguson" of the moment, whenever he came to a "statoo brunzo" (Italian
for
a bronze statue), or an Egyptian obelisk, or the Forum or any other work of art, ancient or
modern,
whether it too was by Michael Angelo; thus at any rate making  somebody else share in his
tortures.
In presence of the ancients he  generally indulges in facetiousness of a rather low order. He goes,
for
example, to some amphitheatre and tries to realize the scene which it once presented. His most
vivid
picture is that of a Roman youth, who took "some other fellow's young lady" to a gladiatorial
show
and amused her and himself during the acts by "approaching the cage and stirring up the martyrs
with
his whalebone cane." But, to say the truth, Mr. Twain here verges upon buffoonery. Once or
twice
he is driven to what is happily described in the heading of the page as "general execration." Here,
for example, is a burst of patriotic eloquence. "O, sons of classic Italy, is the spirit of enterprise,
of
self-reliance, of noble endeavour utterly dead within ye? Curse your indolent worthlessness, why
don't you rob your Church?" And he is very great on occasion in explaining the many advantages
of
a free and independent Republic as compared with a land groaning under priestly dominion and
grovelling superstition. That notion of robbing the Church occurs to him very forcibly at
intervals,
and he seems to think that, so far as the plan has been carried out, it is the best chance for Italy.
</p><p>
Perhaps we have persuaded our readers by this time that Mr. Twain is a very offensive specimen
of the vulgarest kind of Yankee. And yet, to say the truth, we have a kind of liking for him. There
is a frankness and originality about his remarks which is pleasanter than the mere repetition of
stale
raptures; and his fun, if not very refined, is often tolerable in its way. In short, his pages may be
turned over with amusement, as exhibiting more or less consciously a very lively portrait of the
uncultivated American tourist, who may be more obtrusive and misjudging, but is not quite so
stupidly unobservant as our native product. We should not choose either of them for our
companions
on a visit to a church or a picture-gallery, but we should expect most amusement from the
Yankee
as long as we could stand him.

Tom Sawyer was a boy, not one of the sort that you read about in
good books, but a
little devil, never malicious and always at some trick, and in the
course of years he
engaged in a multitude, all of which are here recorded in Twain's
style.  He had
special aversions for church, Sunday school, pious people, devout
conversation and
the company of his sedate but good old aunt.  In spite of his
efforts to escape from
such inflictions he had to suffer them once in a while, but in his
efforts to get some
diversion on such occasions he more than once made lively
sensations.  Too lazy to
get his Sunday school lessons, he managed by sharp trading to buy
up a lot of the
tickets given to the best pupils, and when a distinguished visitor
came the children
were requested to step forward with their tickets so that the one
who had the most
should receive the prize.  To the astonishment of all Tom Sawyer
was the hero, and,
after a great time had been made over him, the visitor thought Tom
should have a
chance to show his learning, so he asked him who were the first two
of the twelve
Apostles to follow Jesus, it being presumed that the prize boy knew
such things
perfectly, for the lesson of the term had been in the study of the
four Gospels.  Tom
felt the necessity of giving some answer, and his was "David and
Goliath," to the
surprise of the visitor, the consternation of the head teacher and
the amusement of the
school.  When Tom went to church he took a large snapping bug
(which has a grip
like a crab) with him, and it got hold of a church-going dog, which
rushed around the
building and howled in a manner highly unbecoming to the place.
When he was sick
his aunt gave him pain-killer, and when she went out he gave a dose
to the cat, which
squawled, rushed around like mad, upsetting everything, and then
jumped through
the window, breaking a pane of glass in the way.  Aunt Polly
hearing the disturbance
and finding the cause, scolded Tom for being so cruel to the cat,
but Tom said she
had compelled him to take pain-killer when he protested, and he had
not given it to
pussy till she came and begged for a taste when she saw him pour it
into a spoon.  He
went to school, and got into trouble on account of a little
girl--both about ten years
old.  Having read about the romantic life of pirates, Tom and two
companions of the
same age stole a little raft, on which they floated a few miles on
the Mississippi to
a small uninhabited island, where they remained three days, while
their relatives
mourned their supposed death by drowning, and when they were
discovered and
brought back  there was great rejoicing, and Tom was looked at by
other little boys
as a wonderful hero, and he put on awful airs on account of the
sensation he made.
What we have told here is merely part of the outline of the story;
the chief merit is
in the filling in, which is full of humorous and acute delineation
of the follies,
superstitions and peculiarities of boys, girls and older people.

<p>The name of Mark Twain is known throughout the length
and breadth of England. Wherever there is a railway-station with
a bookstall his jokes are household words. Those whose usual
range in literature does not extend beyond the sporting
newspapers, the <i>Racing Calendar, </i>and the "Diseases of
Dogs," have allowed him a place with Artemus Ward alongside
of the handful of books which forms their library. For ourselves,
we cannot dissociate him from the railway-station, and his jokes
always rise in our mind with a background of Brown & Polson's
Corn Flour and Taylor's system of removing furniture. We have
read <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer </i>with different
surroundings, and still have been made to laugh; and that ought
to be taken as high praise. Indeed, the earlier part of the book
is,
to our thinking, the most amusing thing Mark Twain has written.
The humour is not always uproarious, but it is always genuine
and sometimes almost pathetic, and it is only now and then that
the heartiness of a laugh is spoilt by one of those pieces of
self-consciousness which are such common blots on Mark
Twain's other books. <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> is
an attempt in a new direction. It is consecutive, and much longer
than the former books, and as it is not put forward as a mere
collection of <i>Screamers, </i>we laugh more easily, and find
some relief in being able to relax the conventional grin expected
from the reader of the little volumes of railway humour. The
present book is not, and does not pretend to be a novel, in the
ordinary sense of the word; it is not even a story, for that
presupposes a climax and a finish; nor is it a mere boys' book of
adventures. In the Preface the author says, "Although my book
is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls, I hope
it will not be shunned by men and women on that account, for
part of my plan has been to try pleasantly to remind adults of
what they once were themselves, and of how they felt and
thought and talked, and what queer enterprises they sometimes
engaged in." Questions of intention are always difficult to
decide. The book will amuse grown-up people in the way that
humorous books written for children have amused before, but
(perhaps fortunately) it does not seem to us calculated to carry
out the intention here expressed. With regard to the style, of
course there are plenty of slang words and racy expressions,
which are quite in place in the conversations, but it is just a
question whether it would not have been as well if the remainder
of the book had not been written more uniformly in English.

Mr. Aldrich has studied the life of A Bad Boy as the pleasant
reprobate led it in a quiet old New England town twenty-five or
thirty years ago, where in spite of the natural outlawry of
boyhood he was more or less part of a settled order of things,
and was hemmed in, to some measure, by the traditions of an
established civilization. Mr. Clemens, on the contrary, has taken
the boy of the Southwest for the hero of his new book, and has
presented him with a fidelity to circumstance which loses no
charm by being realistic in the highest degree, and which gives
incomparably the best picture of life in that region as yet known
to fiction. The town where Tom Sawyer was born and brought
up is some such idle, shabby little Mississippi River town as Mr.
Clemens has so well described in his piloting reminiscences, but
Tom belongs to the better sort of people in it, and has been bred
to fear God and dread the Sunday-school according to the
strictest rite of the faiths that have characterized all the
respectability of the West. His subjection in these respects does
not so deeply affect his inherent tendencies but that he makes
himself a beloved burden to the poor, tender-hearted old aunt
who brings him up with his orphan brother and sister, and
struggles vainly with his manifold sins, actual and imaginary.
The limitations of his transgressions are nicely and artistically
traced. He is mischievous, but not vicious; he is ready for almost
any depredation that involves the danger and honor of
adventure, but profanity he knows may provoke a thunderbolt
upon the heart of the blasphemer, and he almost never swears;
he resorts to any stratagem to keep out of school, but he is not
a downright liar, except upon terms of after shame and remorse
that make his falsehood bitter to him. He is cruel, as all children
are, but chiefly because he is ignorant; he is not mean, but there
are very definite bounds to his generosity; and his courage is the
Indian sort, full of prudence and mindful of retreat as one of the
conditions of prolonged hostilities. In a word, he is a boy, and
merely and exactly an ordinary boy on the moral side. What
makes him delightful to the reader is that on the imaginative
side he is very much more, and though every boy has wild and
fantastic dreams, this boy cannot rest till he has somehow
realized them. Till he has actually run off with two other boys
in the character of buccaneer, and lived for a week on an island
in the Mississippi, he has lived in vain; and this passage is but
the prelude to more thrilling adventures, in which he finds
hidden treasures, traces the bandits to their cave, and is himself
lost in its recesses. The local material and the incidents with
which his career is worked up are excellent, and throughout
there is scrupulous regard for the boy's point of view in
reference to his surroundings and himself, which shows how
rapidly Mr. Clemens has grown as an artist. We do not
remember anything in which this propriety is violated, and its
preservation adds immensely to the grown-up reader's
satisfaction in the amusing and exciting story. There is a boy's
love-affair, but it is never treated otherwise than as a boy's
love-affair. When the half-breed has murdered the young doctor,
Tom and his friend, Huckleberry Finn, are really, in their boyish
terror and superstition, going to let the poor old town-drunkard
be hanged for the crime, till the terror of that becomes
unendurable. The story is a wonderful study of the boy-mind,
which inhabits a world quite distinct from that in which he is
bodily present with his elders, and in this lies its great charm
and its universality, for boy-nature, however human nature
varies, is the same everywhere.
</p><p>
The tale is very dramatically wrought, and the subordinate
characters are treated with the same graphic force that sets Tom
alive before us. The worthless vagabond, Huck Finn, is entirely
delightful throughout, and in his promised reform his identity is
respected: he will lead a decent life in order that he may one day
be thought worthy to become a member of that gang of robbers
which Tom is to organize. Tom's aunt is excellent, with her kind
heart's sorrow and secret pride in Tom; and so is his sister Mary,
one of those good girls who are born to usefulness and charity
and forbearance and unvarying rectitude. Many village people
and local notables are introduced in well-conceived character;
the whole little town lives in the reader's sense, with its
religiousness, its lawlessness, its droll social distinctions, its
civilization qualified by its slave-holding, and its traditions of
the wilder West which has passed away. The picture will be
instructive to those who have fancied the whole Southwest a
sort of vast Pike County, and have not conceived of a sober and
serious and orderly contrast to the sort of life that has come to
represent the Southwest in literature. Mr. William M. Baker
gives a notion of this in his stories, and Mr. Clemens has again
enforced the fact here, in a book full of entertaining character,
and of the greatest artistic sincerity.
</p><p>
Tom Brown and Tom Bailey are, among boys in books, alone
deserving to be named with Tom Sawyer.

<p>Tom Sawyer is a bit of a scamp, a kind of juvenile Gil Blas, an
<i>enfant
terrible</i>, a schoolboy full of practical jokes and solemn
impositions, who wins
a Sunday-school Bible by buying tickets, and proves his assiduous
study by the
astounding answer to the question, "Who were the first two
apostles?"  "David and
Goliath."  He absconds from school, and with a village
ne'er-do-well sets up for a
pirate on an island in the river, then steals home at night to
listen to his old aunt
weeping over him as drowned, and is furtively present on Sunday to
hear his funeral
sermon preached.  In one of his escapades he is witness of a
midnight murder--gets
lost in a cave on the Mississippi, finds the murderer and his
treasure, and ends his
schoolboy days by being a hero.  The book is full of roaring fun,
interspersed with
touches of true pathos.  It will have the effect of making boys
think that an
unscrupulous scapegrace is sure to turn out a noble man; it might
therefore have
given more emphasis to truth and straightforwardness.  But it is
irresistible; fully up
to the mark of the "Innocents Abroad."

Mark Twain's <i>Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> was published in
England last
June, and immediately many of the most easily detached and quotable
portions of it
found their way into the American press, and a wide circulation.
The COURANT
printed at the time two or three extracts from the book--Tom's
adventure with the
beetle in church, a most delightful study as well as a piece of
profound philosophy,
and the whitewashing of the fence, a bit of genuine fun with an
artistic finish that
would give the author a deserved reputation if he had never written
anything else.
The volume has just been brought out here in a very handsome style,
copiously
illustrated with drawings by Mr. J. W. Williams, who has happily
entered into the
spirit of the book, and produced excellent and on the whole the
best set of character
sketches we have ever seen from his pencil.  The engravings do not
all do justice to
the original drawings, but they are more than fair, and as the text
is beautifully
printed on broad pages, the whole effect is very pleasing, and the
volume is attractive
at the first glance.
</p><p><i>Tom Sawyer</i> is in some respects an advance on anything
that Mr.
Clemens has before done--an advance we mean as a piece of literary
work, careful
in finish, and thought out more maturely.  It has not the large,
original force of the
uncontrollable, spontaneous humor that in "The Innocents Abroad"
carried an
irrepressible burst of merriment round the globe, from San
Francisco to India by way
of Europe, but it has passages as exquisitely humorous as any in
that book, and as a
general thing it is more finely wrought.  The passages we have
spoken of above
amply sustain this assertion; you can read them again and again
with new delight, and
indeed, we find it difficult not to read them every time we take up
the book.  They
could not have been written without the spark of genius.  We find
in this book, too,
the author's style, not more virile and sparklingly clear than
formerly, but more
carefully finished; and the author has toned down a little those
excursions into the
impossible, which are intensely amusing, but do not commend
themselves to the
judgment on a second reading.  And in doing this he has lost
nothing of his
extraordinarily forceful use of the English language.  There is no
one writing today
who has a finer intuitive sense of the right word in the right
place.
</p><p>The book is all about boys, and it is said to be written for
boys.  It is a
masterly reproduction of boy's life and feeling, but, at the same
time, it is written
above boys: that is, the best part of it--the wit, the humor, the
genius of it will fly
miles above every boy's head in the country.  The boys can
appreciate the adventure
in it as a mere narrative, but not that which makes the adventure
valuable to older
readers, who recall their own boyhood in it.  The boy has not the
least sense of
humor; that is nothing funny to him in having his pocket in measure
of useless trash;
the tricks he plays upon his comrades are not amusing to him; he is
a non-humorous,
dead, in earnest creature, and it is this characteristic that makes
him amusing to us
(to himself in retrospect); but his serious life does not take in
what we call humor.
It is for this reason that we say that Tom Sawyer will be enjoyed
most by mature
readers, who will have a great delight in seeing how faithfully boy
life is recalled.
</p><p>Boy nature is the same everywhere, and the characteristics
here given are of
universal acceptance; but local coloring (as it is now called) is
different, and the boys
of this book are of Missouri and not of New England in a good many
of their ways;
and so they ought to be, being studies from life.  We should not
counsel New
England boys to expect or to imitate some of the adventures in this
book, but they
doubtless are true enough to the society they sketch.  The Missouri
boy who has
mighty stirrings in his soul and feels deeply the desperate
injustice of his tender
home, may want to go away and be a noble river pirate, just as the
New England boy
is sometimes moved to run away to sea.  But neither of them we
fancy ever finds or
makes a pot of money by any sudden streak of luck.
</p><p>We do not believe that Tom Sawyer or his comrades have the
least idea how
bright a boy he is, or what exceedingly funny things he says; he is
as bright as Mark
Twain himself.  And probably no boy will appreciate the deep fun
and satire of the
following passage.  In a midnight adventure of Tom and his
companion, Huckleberry,
the boys think they are lost and fall into a panic.  Huckleberry
<a name="7">whispers:--</a>
<lb><lb>
<xref doc="http:/etext.virginia.edu/railton/tomsawye/tomrevlink7.html">[LINK TS7]</xref>
<lb>
</p><p>The Sunday-school chapter, in which Tom's financial
abilities come out
strong, and he trades himself into the possession of the first
prize, and in which he
exhibits his Biblical knowledge, is saturated with the keenest
humor; but a boy will
hardly comprehend the fine observation and deep satirical humor of
the scene.  It is
prize day and company is present.  On the platform is the great
Judge Thatcher, the
county judge, and it is an important hour for Mr. Walters, the
superintendent, and for
the whole school.  It was an impressive silence when Jeff Thatcher,
the brother of the
judge, observed by "ranks of staring eyes," went forward to be
familiar with the great
man and be envied by the <a name="8">school:--</a>
<lb><lb>

<xref doc="http:/etext.virginia.edu/railton/tomsawye/tomrevlink8.html">[LINK TS8]</xref>
<lb>
</p><p>Tom is a genuine boy and his Aunt Polly is a genuine woman;
both are
capitally drawn; and the author has given to both some noble traits
and elements of
pathos which make them remain our friends long after the laughter
they excite has
ceased.  The book is full of quotable things, scenes as amusing as
anything Mr.
Clemens has written, with now and then a stroke of good humored
satire that is as
well deserved as it is artistically administered--take the school
examination and
exhibition as a specimen; the remarks on the "compositions" of the
young ladies
might well be framed and hung up in every school room.  But it is
unnecessary to
quote from a book which everybody will read.

<p>The American Publishing company of this city have just issued
Mark Twain's
book, "Tom Sawyer."  It is a beautiful book, both outside and in,
as one might
naturally expect to find it on seeing the imprint of this
publishing house upon it--a
house that has established a well-earned reputation in the book
publishing lines.  The
illustrations in the book are of a merit beyond praise.  They are
of the eloquent kind
that speak for themselves, as well as for the print they
illustrate.  Those who imagine
this to be a tame story for little boys will discover their mistake
on reading it.  It is
safe to predict that no one will read the first page without
reading all the rest.  There
is a power of attraction about it that doesn't "let up," but grows
stronger to the end.
Though claiming to be a book for boys and girls it will not be
monopolized by them.
There's rich entertainment in it for both young and old.  The
author says most of the
adventures recorded in it really occurred, and that one or two of
them were his own.
Perhaps his well-known modesty forbids his claiming any larger
proportion.  The
story dates back some forty years ago, in one of the southwestern
slave states.  The
hero, Tom Sawyer, is a unique individual, to state it mildly.  The
author says he
belongs to the composite order of architecture.  Perhaps that is as
good a description
of him as can be given in brief.  He isn't one of the orthodox boys
who love their
Sunday schools, and love to read about the good little boys who die
early and go to
heaven.  He evidently preferred the other place where they don't
have any Sunday
schools, and the boys don't have to keep quiet every seventh day in
the week.  He
doesn't believe in early deaths, nor early piety.  Tom is a
reckless, daredevil fellow,
ready to hazard life for an adventure any time; but under the
rollicking air of the book
there appears an occasional bit of philosophy in the peculiarly
dry, sarcastic vein of
the author, as this, for <a name="3">instance</a>:

During the sermon that followed--a sermon that thinned the elect
down to a company
so small as to be "hardly worth the saving"--Tom had further
interesting adventures
which helped to give variety and keep awake "other people
uninterested in the
sermon" as well as himself.
</p><p>The account, some chapters further along, of the village
school graduating
exercises, and the prize poems and compositions of the young
ladies, is racy and rich,
but not in the least exaggerated.  Its beauty consists in its truth
to life.  The slim,
melancholy girl, with a cast of countenance "that comes of pills
and indigestion,"
who reads a poem as indigestible as her ordinary diet, is to be
found in any average
school of the present day, as can likewise be found her bilious
companion who reads
a composition which "wound up with a sermon so destructive of all
hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the first prize."
</p><p>Perhaps the most pointed paragraph in the book is the
following in relation
to a petition for pardon for a <a name="6">murderer</a>:

If there is any defect in the book it is in the love scenes, where
a boy of Tom Sawyer's
size wanders off to be an outlaw.  This part is a little overdrawn.
But the whole story
is so exquisitely told that the book will be widely sought.  It is
a capital gift for the
holidays.

This newest work of Mark Twain increases the difficulty of
assigning that author a literary <i>habitat. </i>"American
humorist" has for some time been recognised as too vague a
label to attach to a writer whose "Jumping Frog" and other early
sketches have been reduced to mere fragments and ventures by
such productions as <i>The Innocents Abroad  </i>and <i>The
New Pilgrim's Progress, </i>in which, while the humour is still
fresh, there is present an equal art in graphic description of
natural scenery,  and a fine sense of what is genuinely
impressive in the grandeurs of the past. Those who have
travelled with Mark Twain with some curiosity to observe the
effect of the ancient world interpreted by a very shrewd eye,
fresh from the newest outcome of civilisation, may have
expected to find antiquity turned into a solemn joke, but they
can hardly have failed to discover a fine discrimination present
at each step in the path of the "new pilgrim"; while he sheds
tears of a kind hardly relished by the  superstitious or
sentimental over the supposed grave of his deceased parent
Adam, he can "listen deep" when any true theme from the
buried world reaches his ear. Without being pathetic he is
sympathetic, and there is also an innate refinement in his genius
felt in every subject it selects and in his treatment of it. <i>Tom
Sawyer </i>carries us to an altogether novel region, and along
with these characteristics displays a somewhat puzzling variety
of abilities. There is something almost stately in the simplicity
with which he invites us to turn our attention to the affairs of
some boys and girls growing up on the far frontiers of American
civilisation. With the Eastern Question upon us, and crowned
heads arrayed on the political stage, it may be with some
surprise that we find our interest demanded in sundry Western
questions that are solving themselves through a <i>dramatis
personae </i>of humble folk whose complications occur in a St.
Petersburg situated on the Missouri river. Our manager, we feel
quite sure, would not for a moment allow us to consider that any
other St. Petersburg is of equal importance to that for which he
claims our attention. What is the deposition, death, or
enthronement of a Sultan compared with the tragical death of
"Injun Joe," the murderer, accidentally buried and entombed in
the cavern where his stolen treasures are hid? There he was
<a name="a">found. </a>

In such writing as this we seem to be reading some classic
fable, such as the Persian Sadi might point with his moral, "Set
not your heart on things that are transitory; the Tigris will run
through Bagdat after the race of Caliphs is extinct." Nor is this
feeling of the dignity of his subject absent when the author is
describing the most amusing incidents.  Indeed, a great deal of
Mark Twain's humour consists in the serious -- or even
at times severe -- style in which he narrates his stories
and portrays his scenes, as one who feels that the universal laws
are playing through the very slightest of them. The following is
a scene in  which the principal actors are a dog, a boy, and a
beetle, the place being the <a name="b">chapel:</a> --

<lb><lb>
The scene we have selected is not so laughable, perhaps, as
some others in the volume, but it indicates very well the kind of
art in which Mark Twain is pre-eminent in our time. Every
movement of boy, beetle, and poodle, is described not merely
with precision, but with a subtle sense of meaning in every
movement. Everything is alive, and every face physiognomical.
From a novel so replete with good things, and one so full of
significance, as it brings before us what we can feel is the real
spirit of home life in the far West, there is no possibility of
obtaining extracts which will convey to the reader any idea of
the purport of the book. The scenes and characters cannot be
really seen apart from their grouping and environment. The
book will no doubt be a great favourite with boys, for whom it
must in good part have been intended; but next to boys we
should say that it might be most prized by philosophers and
poets. The interior life, the everyday experiences, of a small
village on the confines of civilisation and in the direction of its
advance, may appear, antecedently, to supply but thin material
for a romance; but still it is at just that same little pioneer
point
that humanity is growing with the greatest freedom, and
unfolding some of its unprescribed tendencies. We can, indeed,
hardly imagine a more felicitous task for a man of genius to
have accomplished than to have seized the salient, picturesque,
droll, and at the same time most significant features of human
life, as he has himself lived it and witnessed it, in a region
where it is continually modified in relation to new
circumstances. The chief fault of the story is its brevity, and it
will, we doubt not, be widely and thoroughly enjoyed by young
and old for its fun and its philosophy.

Mark Twain belongs to a somewhat different school of writers
from Miss Yonge, and <i>Tom Sawyer </i>is a characteristic
production of his genius. We  recognize the germ of it in the
stories of the good and bad little boys,  which went some way
towards making their author's popularity.  <i>Tom Sawyer,
</i>as we are told in the Preface, is intended primarily for the
amusement of children, but it is hoped that "it will not be
shunned by men  and women on that account, for part of my
plan has been to try  pleasantly to remind adults of what they
once were themselves." How far Master Sawyer's eccentric
experiences may come home in that way to American citizens
we cannot pretend to say. To our English notions, Tom appears
to have been a portentous phenomenon, and his eventful career
exhibits an unprecedented precocity. His conceptions were as
romantic as their execution was audacious. Holding all
sedentary occupations in aversion, his cast of thought was as
original as his quaint felicity of picturesque expression. We are
very sure there are no such boys in this country, and even in the
States it may be supposed that the breed has been dying out, for
fully more than a generation has gone by since Tom was the
glory and plague of his native village on the Mississippi. His
remarkable talent for mischief would have made him an
intolerable thorn in the flesh of the aunt who acted as a mother
to him had it not been that his pranks and misconduct endeared
him to that much-enduring woman. "Cuteness" is scarcely the
word for Tom's ingrained artfulness. Take, by way of example,
one of his earliest achievements. He is caught by his aunt in
some flagrant delict, and condemned to whitewash the fence
that runs in front of her cottage.  Tom had planned to make one
of a swimming party, and, what is more, he  knows that he will
be jeered by his playmates, and contempt is  intolerable to his
soaring spirit. So, when he sees Ben Rogers, whose satire he
stands most in dread of, come puffing along the  road,
personating a high-pressure steamer, Tom buckles himself to his
task with a will. He is so absorbed, in fact, in artistic
enthusiasm
that Ben's ribald mockery falls on unheeding ears, and Tom has
actually to be twitched by the jacket before he turns to recognize
his friend. Ere long Ben, who was bound for the river, is
begging and praying to be permitted to have a turn with the
brush. Tom is slow to be persuaded; had it been the back fence
it might have been different, but his aunt is awful particular
about this front one --
</p><p>
"Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly -- well, Jim
wanted to do it,  but she wouldn't let him. Sid wanted to do it,
but she wouldn't let Sid.  Now, don't you see how I'm fixed? If
you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it."
</p><p>
The result is that Tom, as an immense favour, trades the
privilege of a few minutes' painting for an apple. Each of the
other boys, as he comes up in Ben's wake, makes a similar deal
on his own account. Tom amasses a wealth of miscellaneous
treasure, which he subsequently barters for a sufficiency of
tickets of merit at the Sunday school to entitle him to walk off
with the honours for which meritorious children have been
toiling;  while his aunt, to her intense surprise, finds her fence
covered with  several coatings of whitewash, and goes into
raptures over Tom's capacity for work on the rare occasions
when he chooses to apply himself.  But, though anything but a
bookish boy, Tom had paid considerable attention to literature
of an eccentric kind, and, indeed, his knowledge of men and
things was very much taken from his favourite authors. He runs
away with a couple of comrades to follow the calling of  pirates
on an island of the Mississippi, the grand inducement being
"that  you don't have to get up mornings, and you don't have to
go to school and wash and all that blame foolishness." After
some days, when the trio are bored and half-starved and rather
frightened, Tom plans a melo-dramatic return, and the missing
ones emerge from the disused gallery of the church and present
themselves to the congregation of weeping mourners, just as the
clergyman's moving eloquence is dwelling on the virtues of the
dear departed. Afterwards Tom, who "all along has been
wanting to be a robber," but has never been able to find the
indispensable cave, stumbles on the very thing to suit him. So
he  carries off a devoted follower who has been hardened for an
outlaw's life by the habit of living on scraps and sleeping in
empty hogsheads -- Republican freedom from class
prejudices seems to have been a marked feature among the boys
of the Transatlantic St. Petersburg. He teaches Huck his duties
as they are flying from the society of their kind out of the
accumulated stores of his own erudition. "Who'll we rob?" asks
Huck. "Oh, most anybody  -- waylay people; that's mostly
the way."  "And kill them?"  "No, not always. Hide them in the
cave till they can raise a ransom. You make them raise all they
can off o' their friends, and after you've kept them a year, if it
ain't raised, then you kill them. That's the general way. Only you
don't kill the women; you shut up the women, but you don't kill
them. They're always beautiful and rich and awfully scared. You
take their watches and things, but you always take off your hat
and talk polite. There ain't everybody as polite as robbers; you'll
see that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you; and
after they've been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop
crying, and after that you couldn't get them to leave. If you
drove them out they'd turn right round and come back. It's so in
all the books.' In the course of their researches in the cavern
they come on what Tom pronounces "an awful snug place for
orgies." "What's orgies?" inquires Huck. "I dunno," says Tom
very frankly; "but robbers always have orgies, and of course
we've got to have them too."
</p><p>
We fear these elegant extracts give but a faint idea of the
drollery in which the book abounds; for the fact is that the best
part of the fun lies in the ludicrous individuality of Tom
himself, with whom we have been gradually growing familiar.
But we should say that a perusal of <i>Tom Sawyer</i> is as
fair a test as one could suggest of anybody's appreciation of the
humorous. The drollery is often grotesque and extravagant, and
there is at least as much in the queer Americanizing of the
language as in the ideas it expresses. Practical people who pride
themselves on strong common sense will have no patience with
such vulgar trifling. But those who are alive to the pleasure of
relaxing from serious thought and grave occupation will catch
themselves smiling over every page and exploding outright over
some of the choicer passages.

"Mark Twain" has dropped the humorous exaggerations of his "Jumping
Frog" and
"Innocents Abroad" in his fresh and racy story of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>
(Chatto and
Windus).  "Although," writes this popular American humorist in his
preface, "my
book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls, I
hope it will not be
shunned by men and women on that account; for part of my plan has
been to try to
write pleasantly, to remind adults of what they once were
themselves, and of how
they felt and thought and talked, and what queer enterprises they
sometimes engaged
in."  So very human is "Tom Sawyer" in its faithful delineation of
boy-life that it
cannot fail to realize the hope of "Mark Twain," and amuse everyone
who in the
words of the song, "would" he "were a boy again."  All the love of
mischief, hopes
and fears, joys and sorrows, foolhardy pranks and acts of bravery
that make Tom
Sawyer stand out as a veritable portrait from the life are set down
by Mr. Clemens
with unfailing fidelity to nature; and that element of adventure so
dear to boys is
supplied in a manner to satisfy the appetite for the strangest
sensational fare.  It is the
faithful portrayal of boy-life, however--not the midnight murder in
a churchyard of
which Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn are eye-witnesses, nor the piratical
venture of
Tom and his mates, nor even the wanderings of Tom and his
sweetheart whilst lost
in the cave--that makes "Mark Twain's" last volume so welcome, and
that will,
doubtless, win for him even a wider circle of readers that he has
at present.

We have already alluded to Mark Twain's new book, "The Adventures
of Tom
Sawyer."  The work has just been published, and is a most capital
subject for a
holiday gift.  Like all of its author's works, it overflows with
rare and quaint humor;
and, in addition to its attractive subject-matter, it has the
advantage of being bound
very handsomely, printed on heavy tinted paper, and beautified with
150 illustrations,
and is to be obtained at a far lower price than Twain's other
works.  It contains about
300 pages.  The lady agent for this city may be found at 88 Court
Street, where any
subscriber omitted by her may obtain the book.

<p>
Shades of the venerable Mr. Day, of the instructive Mrs.
Barbauld, of the persuasive Miss Edgeworth! Had you the
power of sitting today beside the reviewer's desk, and were
called upon to pass judgment on the books written and printed
for the boys and girls of today, would you not have groaned and
moaned over their perusal? If such superlatively good children
as Harry and Lucy could have existed, or even such nondescript
prigs as Sandford and Merton had abnormal being, this other
question presents itself to our mind: "How would these precious
children have enjoyed Mark Twain's <i>Tom Sawyer</i>"?  In
all books written for the amusement of children there are two
distinct phases of appreciation. What the parent thinks of the
book is one thing; what the child thinks of it is another. It is
fortunate when both parent and child agree in their conclusions.
Such double appreciation may, in most instances, simply be one
in regard to the fitness of the book on the part of the parent. A
course of reading entirely devoted to juvenile works must be to
an adult a tax on time and patience. It is only once in many
years that such a charming book as <i>Little Alice in
Wonderland</i> is produced, which old and young could read
with thorough enjoyment.  If, thirty  years ago, <i>Tom Sawyer
</i>had been placed in a careful father's hands to read, the
probabilities would have been that he would have hesitated
before giving the book to his boy &ndash; not that Mr. Clemens'
book is exceptional in character, or differs in the least, save in
its cleverness, from a host of similar books on like topics which
are universally read by children today. It is the judgment of the
book-givers which has undoubtedly undergone a change, while
youthful minds, being free from warp, twist, or dogma, have
remained ever the same.
</p><p>Returning then to these purely intellectual
monstrosities, mostly the pen-and-ink offspring of authors and
authoresses who never had any real flesh and blood creations of
their own, there can be no doubt that had Sandford or Merton
ever for a single moment dipped inside of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>'s
pages, astronomy and physics, with all the musty old farrago of
Greek and Latin history, would have been thrown to the dogs.
Despite tasseled caps, starched collars, and all the proprieties,
these children would have laughed uproariously over Tom
Sawyer's "cat and the pain-killer," and certain new ideas might
have had birth in their brains. Perhaps had these children
actually lived in our times, Sandford might have been a Western
steam-boat captain, or Merton a fillibuster. <i>Tom Sawyer</i>
is likely to inculcate the idea that there are certain lofty
aspirations which Plutarch never ascribed to his more prosaic
heroes. Books for children in former bygone periods were
mostly constructed in one monotonous key. A child was
supposed to be a vessel which was to be constantly filled up.
Facts and morals had to be taken like bitter draughts or acrid
pills. In order that they should be absorbed like medicines it was
perhaps a kindly thinker who disguised these facts and morals.
The real education swallowed in those doses by the children we
are inclined to think was in small proportion to the quantity
administered. Was it not good old Peter Parley who in this
country first broke loose from conventional trammels, and made
American children truly happy? We have certainly gone far
beyond Mr. Goodrich's manner. There has come an amount of
ugly realism into children's story-books, the advantages of
which we are very much in doubt about.
</p><p>
Now, it is perfectly true that many boys do not adopt drawing-room
manners. Perhaps it is better that little paragons &ndash;
pocket Crichtons &ndash; are so rare. Still, courage, frankness,
truthfulness, and self-reliance are to be inculcated in our lads.
Since association is everything, it is not desirable that in real
life
we should familiarize our children with those of their age who
are lawless or dare-devils. Granting that the natural is the true,
and the true is the best, and that we may describe things as they
are for adult readers, it is proper that we should discriminate a
great deal more as to the choice of subjects in books intended
for children. Today a majority of the heroes in such books have
longings to be pirates, want to run away with vessels, and
millions of our American boys read and delight in such stories.
ln olden times the <i>Pirate's Own Book </i>with its
death's-head and crossbones on the back had no concealment
about it. It is true, edition after edition was sold. There it was.
You saw it palpably. There was no disguise about it. If a father
or mother objected to their child's reading the <i>Pirate's Own
Book, </i>a pair of tongs and a convenient fireplace ended the
whole matter. Today the trouble is: that there is a decidedly
sanguinary tendency in juvenile books. No matter how innocent,
quiet, or tame may be the title of a child's book, there is no
guarantee that the volume your curlyhcaded little boy may be
devouring may not contain a series of adventures recalling Capt.
Kidd's horrors. In the short preface of <i>Tom Sawyer </i>Mr.
Clemens writes, "Although my book is intended mainly for the
entertainment of boys and girls, I hope it will not be shunned by
men and women on that account." We have before expressed
the idea that a truly clever child's book is one in which both the
man and the boy can find pleasure. No child's book can be
perfectly acceptable otherwise. Is <i>Tom Sawyer
</i>amusing? It is incomparably so. It is the story of a Western
boy, born and bred on the banks of one of the big rivers, and
there is exactly that wild village life which has schooled many
a man to self-reliance and energy. Mr. Clemens has a
remarkable memory for those peculiarities of American boy-talk
which the grown man may have forgotten, but which return to
him not unpleasantly when once the proper key is sounded.
There is one scene of a quarrel, with a dialogue, between Tom
and a city boy which is perfect of its kind. Certain chapters in
Tom's life, where his love for the schoolgirls is told, make us
believe that for an urchin who had just lost his milk-teeth the
affections out West have an awakening even earlier than in
Oriental climes. In fact, Tom is a preternaturally precocious
urchin. One admirable character in the book, and touched with
the hand of a master, is that of Huckleberry Finn. Thcre is a
reality about this boy which is striking. An honest old aunt, who
adores her scapegrace nephew, is a homely picture worked with
exceeding grace. Mr. Clemens must have had just such a
lovable old aunt. An ugly murder in the book, overminutely
described and too fully illustrated, which Tom and Huck see, of
course, in a graveyard, leads, somehow or other, to the
discovery of a cave, in which treasures are concealed, and to
which Tom and Huck fall heirs. There is no cant about Mr.
Clemens. A description of a Sunday-school in <i>Tom
Sawyer</i> is true to the letter. Matters are not told as they are
fancied to be, but as they actually are.
</p><p>
If Mr. Clemens has been wanting in continuity in his longer
sketches, and that sustained inventive power necessary in
dovetailing incidents, Tom, as a story, though slightly
disjointed, has this defect less apparent. As a humorist, Mr.
Clemens has a great deal of fun in him, of the true American
kind, which crops out all over thc book. Mr. Clemens has an
audience both here and in England, and doubtless his friends
across the water will re-echo "the hearty laughs which the
reading of <i>Tom Sawyer </i>will cause on this side of the
world."   We are rather inclined to treat books intended for boys
and girls, written by men of accredited talent and reputation, in
a serious manner. Early impressions are the lasting ones. It is
exactly such a clever book as <i>Tom Sawyer </i>which is sure
to leave its stamp on younger minds. We like, then, the true
boyish fun of Tom and Huck, and have a foible for the mischief
these children engage in. We have not the least objection that
rough boys be the heroes of a story-book. Restless spirits of
energy only require judicious training in order to bring them
into proper use. In the books to be placed into children's hands
for purposes of recreation, we have a preference for those of a
milder type than <i>Tom Sawyer. </i>Excitements derived
from reading should be administered with a certain degree of
circumspection. A sprinkling of salt in mental food is both
natural and wholesome; any cravings for the contents of the
castors, the cayenne and the mustard, by children, should not be
gratified. With less, then, of Injun Joe and "revenge," and
"slitting women's ears," and the shadow of the gallows, which
throws an unnecessarily sinister tinge over the story, (if the
book really is intended for boys and girls) we should have liked
<i>Tom Sawyer </i>better.

Our city of Hartford can boast the greatest humorist in current
literature.  Mr.
Clemens owes nothing to erratic spelling like "Artemas Ward," or to
exciting
political themes like some other witty writers.  He is altogether
original and unique.
"The Innocents Abroad," is an exhaustless feast vastly entertaining
and full of
information as a book of travels.   The same charm of genius in an
unusual direction
fills the fascinating pages of "Tom Sawyer."  The boy hero and the
other children are
so lifelike that the reader hardly needs the author's assurance
that real boys and
genuine parts are in the book.  One gets very fond of Tom
notwithstanding his grave
faults, some of which you almost wish had been omitted.  But he is
a brave, manly
boy after all, and the finest scene in the whole story to one
reader at least, is where
he receives a whipping to shield a little, terrified girl.  The
childish attachment
between these two and the manly protection Tom accords to little
Becky both at
school and amid the horrors of being lost in the cave, are very
finely described.  To
one who had only seen the other side of Tom's character these noble
traits would
have seemed impossible.  The "pain-killer" adventure is funny
beyond expression as
is much of Tom's career.  The last few chapters are extremely
sensational and strike
one as too remarkable to be natural adventures for little boys.
One cannot help
regretting that so fine a fellow as Tom lies and smokes, but the
intention was not to
describe a model boy.  Yet these traits solely detract from the
hero.  Those who
regard Mark Twain as only "a funny man," greatly underestimate his
power.  Wit is
the spice of his books not the substance.  In this story are some
most exquisitely
beautiful descriptions.  That of early morning in one place
particularly, is delicious
in its perfect picture of nature and its beautiful poetry.

A very deplorable fact is that the great body of literary criticism
is mainly perfunctory. This is not due to a lack of ability or to
a lack of knowledge. It is due to the fact that most of it is from
the pens of newspaper writers who have no time to elaborate their
ideas. They are in a hurry, and what they write is hurried. Under
these circumstances it is not unnatural that they should take their
cues from inadequate sources and give to the public opinions that
are either conventional or that have no reasonable basis.
</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the conditions and circumstances of
American life. There is no demand for sound criticism any more than
there is a demand for great poetry. We have a leisure class, but
its tastes run towards horses, yachting and athletic sports, in
imitation of the English young men who occasionally honor these
shores with their presence. The imitation, after all, is a limping
one. The young Englishman of leisure is not only fond of outdoor
sports, but of books. He has culture and taste, and patronizes
literature with as much enthusiasm as he does physical amusements.
If our leisure class is to imitate the English, it would be better
if the imitation extended somewhat in the direction of culture.
</p>
<p>The American leisure class--the class that might be expected to
patronize good literature and to create a  demand for sound,
conservative criticism--is not only fond of horses, but is
decidedly horsey. It is coarse and uncultivated. It has no taste in
either literature or art. It reads few books and buys its pictures
in Europe by the yard.
</p>
<p>We are led to these remarks by the wholly inadequate verdict
that has recently been given in some of the most prominent
newspapers as to the merits of Mark Twain's new book, "The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn." The critics seem to have gotten
their cue in this instance from the action of the Concord library,
the directors of which refused the book a place on their shelves.
This action, as was afterwards explained, was based on the fact
that the book was a work of fiction, and not because of the
humorous characteristics that are popularly supposed to attach to
the writings of Mr. Clemens. But the critics had got their cue
before the explanation was made, and they straightway proceeded to
inform the reading public that the book was gratuitously coarse,
its humor unneccessarily broad, and its purpose crude and
inartistic.

</p><p>Now, nothing could be more misleading than such a criticism
as this. It is difficult to believe that the critics who have
condemned the book as coarse, vulgar and inartistic can have read
it. Taken in connection with "The Prince and the Pauper," it marks
a clear and distinct advance in Mr. Clemens's literary methods. It
presents an almost artistically perfect picture of the life and
character in the southwest, and it will be equally valuable to the
historian and to the student of sociology. Its humor, which is
genuine and never-failing, is relieved by little pathetic touches
here and there that vouch for its literary value.

</p><p>It is the story of a half illiterate, high-spirited boy
whose adventures are related by himself. The art with which this
conception is dealt with is perfect in all its details. The boy's
point of view is never for a moment lost sight of, and the moral of
the whole is that this half illiterate boy can be made to present,
with perfect consistency, not only the characters of the people
whom he meets, but an accurate picture of their social life. From
the artistic point of view, there is not a coarse nor vulgar
suggestion from the beginning to the end of the book. Whatever is
coarse and crude is in the life that is pictured, and the picture
is perfect. It may be said that the humor is sometimes excessive,
but it is genuine humor--and the moral of the book, though it is
not scrawled across every page, teaches the necessity of manliness
and self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>Mark Twain's "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" had a certain
relishable flavor when mixed up with the miscellaneous assortment
of magazine literature; but in a book form, and covering more than
350 pages, they are wearisome and labored. It would be about as
easy to read through a jest book, as to keep up one's interest in
the monotonous humor and the dialectic variations of  "Huck Finn's"
narrative. Here and there are spatches of Mark Twain's best work,
which could be read over and over again, and yet bring each time an
outburst of laugher; but one cannot have the book long in his hands
without being tempted to regret that the author should so often
have laid himself open to the charge of coarseness and bad taste.
The illustrations are admirable in their way. As to the general
character of the book, it may be sufficient to remind the reader of
the author's notice, that "all persons attempting to find a motive
in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a
moral in it will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in
it will be shot." </p>

<p>It is little wonder that Mr. Samuel Clemens, otherwise Mark
Twain, resorted to real or mock lawsuits, as may be, to restrain
some real or imaginary selling of "The Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn" as a means of advertising that extraordinarily senseless
publication. Before the work is disposed of, Mr. Mark Twain will
probably have to resort to law to compel some to sell it by any
sort of bribery or corruption. It is doubtful if the edition could
be disposed of to people of average intellect at anything short of
the point of the bayonet. This publication rejoices in two
frontispieces, of which the one is supposed to be a faithful
portrait of Huckleberry Finn, and the other an engraving of the
classic features of Mr. Mark Twain as seen in the bust made by Karl
Gerhardt. The taste of this gratuitous presentation is as bad as is
the book itself, which is an extreme statement. Mr. Clemens has
contributed some humorous literature that is excellent and will
hold its place, but his Huckleberry Finn appears to be singularly

<p>In his latest story, <I> Huckleberry Finn </i> (Tom Sawyer's
Comrade), by Mark Twain, Mr. Clemens has made a very distinct
literary advance over Tom Sawyer, as an interpreter of human nature
and a contributor to our stock of original pictures of American
life. Still adhering to his plan of narrating the adventures of
boys, with a primeval and Robin Hood freshness, he has broadened
his canvas and given us a picture of a people, of a geographical
region, of a life that is new in the world. The scene of his
romance is the Mississippi river. Mr. Clemens has written of this
river before specifically, but he has not before presented it to
the imagination so distinctly nor so powerfully. Huck Finn's voyage
down the Mississippi with the run away nigger Jim, and with
occasionally other companions, is an adventure fascinating in
itself as any of the classic outlaw stories, but in order that the
reader may know what the author has done for him, let him notice
the impression left on his mind of this lawless, mysterious,
wonderful Mississippi, when he has closed the book. But it is not
alone the river that is indelibly impressed upon the mind, the life
that went up and down it and went on along its banks are projected
with extraordinary power. Incidentally, and with a true artistic
instinct, the villages, the cabins, the people of this river become
startlingly real. The beauty of this is that it is apparently done
without effort. Huck floating down the river happens to see these
things and to encounter the people and the characters that made the
river famous forty years ago--that is all. They do not have the air
of being invented, but of being found. And the dialects of the
people, white and black--what a study are they; and yet nobody
talks for the sake of exhibiting a dialect. It is not necessary to
believe the surprising adventures that Huck engages in, but no one
will have a moment's doubt of the reality of the country and the
people he meets.

</p><p>Another thing to be marked in the story is its dramatic
power. Take the story of the Southern Vendetta--a marvelous piece
of work in a purely literary point of view--and the episode of the
duke and the king, with its pictures of Mississippi communities,
both of which our readers probably saw in the <i>Century </i>
magazine. They are equaled in dramatic force by nothing recently in
literature.

</p><p>We are not in this notice telling the story or quoting from
a book that nearly everybody is sure to read, but it is proper to
say that Mr. Clemens strikes in a very amusing way certain
psychological problems. What, for instance, in the case of Huck,
the son of the town drunkard, perverted from the time of his birth,
is conscience, and how does it work? Most amusing is the struggle
Huck has with his conscience in regard to slavery. His conscience
tells him, the way it has been instructed, that to help the
runaway, nigger Jim to escape--to aid in stealing the property of
Miss Watson, who has never injured him, is an enormous offense that
will no doubt carry him to the bad place; but his affection for Jim
finally induces him to violate his conscience and risk eternal
punishment in helping Jim to escape. The whole study of Huck's
moral nature is as serious as it is amusing, his confusion of wrong
as right and his abnormal mendacity, traceable to his training from
infancy, is a singular contribution to the investigation of human
nature.

</p><p>These contradictions, however, do not interfere with the fun
of the story, which has all the comicality, all the odd way of
looking at life, all the whimsical turns of thought and expression
that have given the author his wide fame and made him <I> sui
generis. </i> The story is so interesting so full of life and
dramatic force, that the reader will be carried along irresistibly,
and the time he loses in laughing he will make up in diligence to
hurry along and find out how things come out.

</p><p>The book is a small quarto, handsomely printed and bound,
and illustrated by 174 drawings which enter fully into the spirit
of the book, and really help to set forth the characters.

For some time past Mr. Clemens has been carried away by the
ambition of seriousness and fine writing. In <i>Huckleberry
Finn</i>
he returns to his right mind, and is again the Mark Twain of old
time.
It is such a book as he, and he only, could have written. It is
meant for
boys; but there are few men (we should hope) who, once they take it
up, will not delight in it. It forms a companion or sequel, to
<i>Tom
Sawyer</i>. Huckleberry Finn, as everybody knows, is one of Tom's
closest friends; and the present volume is a record of the
adventures
which befell him soon after the event which made him a person of
property and brought Tom Sawyer's story to a becoming conclusion.
They are of the most surprising and delightful kind imaginable, and
in
the course of them we fall in with a number of types of character
of
singular freshness and novelty, besides being schooled in half a
dozen
extraordinary dialects -- the Pike County dialect in all its forms,
the
dialect of the Missouri negro, and 'the extremest form of the
backwoods South-Western dialect,' to wit. Huckleberry, it may be
noted, is stolen by his disreputable father, to escape from whom he
contrives an appearance of robbery and murder in the paternal hut,
goes off in a canoe, watches from afar the townsfolk hunting for
his
dead body, and encounters a runaway negro -- Miss Watson's Jim --
an old particular friend of Tom Sawyer and himself. With Jim he
goes
south down the river, and is the hero of such scrapes and
experiences
as make your mouth water (if you have ever been a boy) to read of
them. We do not purpose to tell a single one; it would be unfair to
author and reader alike. We shall content ourselves with repeating
that
the book is Mark Twain at his best, and remarking that Jim and
Huckleberry are real creations, and the worthy peers of the
illustrious
Tom Sawyer.

Mark Twain is a humorist or nothing. He is well aware of the fact
himself, for he prefaces the "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" with
a brief notice, warning persons in search of a moral, motive or
plot that they are liable to be prosecuted, banished or shot. This
is a nice little artifice to scare off the critics--a kind of
"trespassers on these grounds will be dealt with according to law."
</p>
<p>However, as there is no penalty attached, we organized a
search expedition for the humorous qualities of this book with the
following hilarious results:
</p><p>A very refined and delicate piece of narration by Huck Finn,
describin his venerable and dilapidated "pap" as afflicted with
delirium tremens, rolling over and over, "kicking things eveyr
which way," and "saying there are devils ahold of him." This
chapter is especially suited to amuse the children on long, rainy
afternoons.
</p><p>An elevating and laughable description of how Huck killed a
pig, smeared its blood on an axe and mixed in a little of his own
hair, and then ran off, setting up a job on the old man and the
community, and leading them to believe him murdered. This little
joke can be repeated by any smart boy for the amusement of his fond
parents.
</p><p>A graphic and romantic tale of a Southern family feud, which
resulted in an elopement and from six to eight choice corpses.
</p><p>A polite version of the "Giascutus" story, in which a nude
man, striped with the colors of the rainbow, is exhibited as "The
King's Camelopard; or, The Royal Nonesuch." This is a chapter for
lenten parlor entertainments and church festivals.
</p><p>A side-splitting account of a funeral, enlivened by a "sick
melodeun," a "long-legged undertaker," and  rat episode in the
cellar. </p>

<p>MARK TWAIN'S "Tom Sawyer" is an interesting record of boyish
adventure; but, amusing as it is, it may yet be fair to ask whether
its most marked fault is not too strong adherence to conventional
literary models? A glance at the book certainly does not confirm
this opinion, but those who recall the precocious affection of Tom
Sawyer, at the age when he is losing his first teeth, for a little
girl whom he has seen once or twice, will confess that the modern
novel exercises a very great influence. What is best in the book,
what one remembers, is the light we get into the boy's heart. The
romantic devotion to the little girl, the terrible adventures with
murderers and in huge caves, have the air of concessions to jaded
readers. But when Tom gives the cat Pain-Killer, is restless in
church, and is recklessly and eternally deceiving his aunt, we are
on firm ground--the author is doing sincere work.

</p><p>This later book, "Huckleberry Finn," has the great advantage
of being written in autobiographical form. This secures a unity in
the narration that is most valuable; every scene is given, not
described; and the result is a vivid picture of Western life forty
or fifty years ago. While "Tom Sawyer" is scarcely more than an
apparently fortuitous collection of incidents, and its thread is
one that has to do with murders, this story has a more intelligible
plot. Huckleberry, its immortal hero, runs away from his worthless
father, and floats down the Mississippi on a raft, in company with
Jim, a runaway negro. This plot gives great opportunity for varying
incidents. The travelers spend some time on an island; they outwit
every one they meet; they acquire full knowledge of the hideous
fringe of civilization that then adorned that valley; and the book
is a most valuable record of an important part of our motley
American civilization.

</p><p>What makes it valuable is the evident truthfulness of the
narrative, and where this is lacking and its place is taken by
ingenious invention, the book suffers. What is inimitable, however,
is the reflection of the whole varied series of adventures in the
mind of the young scapegrace of a hero. His undying fertility of
invention, his courage, his manliness in every trial, are an
incarnation of the better side of the ruffianism that is one result
of the independence of Americans, just as hypocrisy is one result
of the English respect for civilization. The total absence of
morbidness in the book--for the <i>mal du siecle </i> has not yet
reached Arkansas--gives it a genuine charm; and it is interesting
to notice the art with which this is brought out. The best instance
is perhaps to be found in the account of the feud between the
Shepherdsons and the Grangerfords, which is described only as it
would appear to a semi-civilized boy of fourteen, without the
slightest condemnation or surprise,--either of which would be bad
art,--and yet nothing more vivid can be imagined. That is the way
that a story is best told, by telling it, and letting it go to the
reader unaccompanied by sign-posts or directions how he shall
understand it and profit by it. Life teaches its lessons by
implication, not by didactic preaching; and literature is at its
best when it is an imitation of life and not an excuse for
instruction.

</p><p>As to the humor of Mark Twain, it is scarcely necessary to
speak. It lends vividness to every page. The little touch in "Tom
Sawyer," page 105, where after the murder of which  Tom was an
eye-witness, it seemed "that his school-mates would never get done
holding inquests on dead cats and thus keeping the trouble present
to his mind," and that in the account of the spidery six-armed girl
of Emmeline's picture in "Huckleberry Finn," are in the author's
happiest vein. Another admirable instance is to be seen in
Huckleberry Finn's mixed feelings about rescuing Jim, the negro,
from slavery. His perverted views regarding the unholiness of his
actions are most instructive and amusing. It is possible to feel,
however, that the fun in the long account of Tom Sawyer's
artificial imitation of escapes from prison is somewhat forced;
everywhere simplicity is a good rule, and while the account of the
Southern <i>vendetta </i> is a masterpiece, the caricature of books
of adventure leaves us cold. In one we have a bit of life; in the
other Mark Twain is demolishing something that has no place in the
book.

</p><p>Yet the story is capital reading, and the reason of its
great superiority to "Tom Sawyer" is that is it, for the most part,
a consistent whole. If Mark Twain would follow his hero through
manhood, he would condense a side of American life that, in a few
years, will have to be delved out of newspapers, government
reports, county histories, and misleading traditions by
unsympathetic sociologists.</p><lb>

The boy of to-day is fortunate indeed, and, of a truth, he is to be
congratulated. While the boy of yesterday had to stay his stomach
with the unconscious humour of <i>Sandford and Merton</i>, the boy
of to-day may get his fill of fun and of romance and of adventure
in
<i>Treasure Island</i> and in <i>Tom Brown</i> and in <i>Tom
Sawyer</i>, and now in a sequel to <i>TomSawyer</i>, wherein Tom
himself appears in the very nick of time, like a young god from the
machine. Sequels of stories which have been widely popular are not
a little risky. <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> is a sharp exception to
this
general rule. Although it is a sequel, it is quite as worthy of
wide
popularity as <i>Tom Sawyer</i>. An American critic once neatly
declared that the late G. P. R. James hit the bull's-eye of success
with
his first shot, and that for ever thereafter he went on firing
through the
same hole. Now this is just what Mark Twain has not done.
<i>Huckleberry Finn</i> is not an attempt to do <i>Tom Sawyer</i>
over again. It is a story quite as unlike its predecessor as it is
like.
Although Huck Finn appeared first in the earlier book, and although
Tom Sawyer reappears in the later, the scenes and the characters
are
otherwise wholly different. Above all, the  atmosphere of the story
is
different. <i>Tom Sawyer</i> was a tale of boyish adventure in a
village in Missouri, on the Mississippi river, and it was told by
the
author. <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> is autobiographic; it is a tale of
boyish adventure along the Mississippi river told as it appeared to
Huck Finn. There is not in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> any one scene
quite as funny as those in which Tom Sawyer gets his friends to
whitewash the fence for him, and then uses the spoils thereby
acquired
to attain the highest  situation of the Sunday school the next
morning.
Nor is there any  description quite as thrilling as that awful
moment in
the cave when the  boy and the girl are lost in the darkness, and
when
Tom Sawyer  suddenly sees a human hand bearing a light, and then
finds that the  hand is the hand of Indian Joe, his one mortal
enemy;
we have always  thought that the vision of the hand in the cave in
<i>Tom Sawyer</i> is one of  the very finest things in the
literature
of adventure since Robinson  Crusoe first saw a single footprint in
the
sand of the seashore. But  though Huckleberry Finn may not quite
reach these two highest points  of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>, we incline to
the opinion that the general level of the later story is perhaps
higher
than that of the earlier. For one thing, the skill with which the
character of Huck Finn is maintained is marvellous. We see
everything
through his eyes -- they are his eyes and not a pair of Mark
Twain's
spectacles. And the comments on what he sees are his comments --
the comments of an ignorant, superstitious, sharp, healthy boy,
brought up as Huck Finn had been brought up; they are not speeches
put into his mouth by the author. One of the most artistic things
in the
book --and that Mark Twain is a literary artist of a very high
order all
who have considered his later writings critically cannot but
confess
--one of the most artistic things in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> is the
sober self-restraint with which Mr. Clemens lets Huck Finn set
down,
without any comment at all, scenes which would have afforded the
ordinary writer matter for endless moral and political and
sociological
disquisition. We refer particularly to the account of the
Grangerford-Shepherdson feud, and of the shooting of Boggs by
Colonel Sherburn. Here are two incidents of the rough old life of
the
South-Western States, and of the Mississippi Valley forty or fifty
years ago, of the old life which is now rapidly passing away under
the
influence of advancing civilization and increasing commercial
prosperity, but which has not wholly disappeared even yet, although
a slow revolution in public sentiment is taking place. The
Grangerford-Shepherdson feud is a vendetta as deadly as any
Corsican
could wish, yet the parties to it were honest, brave, sincere, good
Christian people, probably people of deep religious sentiment. Not
the
less we see them taking their guns to church, and, when occasion
serves, joining in what is little better than a general massacre.
The
killing of Boggs by Colonel Sherburn is told with equal sobriety
and
truth; and the later scene in which Colonel Sherburn cows and
lashes
the mob which has set out to Iynch him is one of the most vigorous
bits of writing Mark Twain has done.
</p><p>
     In <i>Tom Sawyer</i> we saw Huckleberry Finn from the outside;
in the  present volume we see him from the inside. He is almost as
much a  delight to any one who has been a boy as was Tom Sawyer.
But only he or she who has been a boy can truly enjoy this record
of
his adventures, and of his sentiments and of his sayings. Old maids
of
either sex will wholly fail to understand him or to like him, or to
see
his significance and his value. Like Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn is a
genuine boy; he is neither a girl in boy's clothes like many of the
modern heroes of juvenile fiction, nor is he a 'little man,' a
full-grown
man cut down; he is a boy, just a boy, only a boy. And his ways and
modes of thought are boyish. As Mr. F. Anstey understands the
English boy, and especially the English boy of the middle classes,
so
Mark Twain understands the American boy, and especially the
American boy of the Mississippi Valley of forty or fifty years ago.
The
contrast between Tom Sawyer, who is the child of respectable
parents, decently brought up, and Huckleberry Finn, who is the
child
of the town drunkard, not brought up at all, is made distinct by a
hundred artistic touches, not the least natural of which is Huck's
constant reference to Tom as his ideal of what a boy should be.
When
Huck escapes from the cabin where his drunken and worthless father
had confined him, carefully manufacturing a mass of very
circumstantial evidence to prove his own murder by robbers, he
cannot help saying, 'I did wish Tom Sawyer was there. I knowed he
would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the
fancy
touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a
thing as that.' Both boys have their full share of boyish
imagination;
and Tom Sawyer, being given to books, lets his imagination run on
robbers and pirates and genies, with a perfect understanding with
himself that, if you want to get fun out of this life, you must
never
hesitate to make believe very hard; and, with Tom's youth and
health,
he never finds it hard to make believe and to be a pirate at will,
or to
summon an attendant spirit, or to rescue a prisoner from the
deepest
dungeon 'neath the castle moat. But in Huck this imagination has
turned to superstition; he is a walking repository of the juvenile
folklore of the Mississippi Valley --a folklore partly traditional
among
the white settlers, but largely influenced by intimate association
with
the negroes. When Huck was in his room at night all by himself
waiting for the signal Tom Sawyer was to give him at midnight, he
felt
so lonesome he <a name="1">wished</a> he was dead:</p><lb>
<lb>
<p>
<xref doc="http://etext.virginia.edu/railton/huckfinn/hflink1.html">LINK HF1</xref>
<lb>
</p>
<p>And, again, later in the story, not at night this time, but in
broad
daylight, Huck walks along a road:
</p><p>
When I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and
sunshiny
-- the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of
faint
dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so
lonesome
and  like everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and
quivers  the leaves, it makes you feel mournful, because you feel
like
it's spirits  whispering --spirits that's been dead ever so many
years
--and you always think they're talking about  you. As a general
thing
it makes a body wish he was dead, too, and done with it all.
</p><p>
Now, none of these sentiments arc appropriate to Tom Sawyer, who
had none of the feeling for nature which Huck Finn had caught
during
his numberless days and nights in the open air. Nor could Tom
Sawyer
either have seen or set down this instantaneous
photograph of a summer storm: -</p><lb>

<lb>
</p>

<p>
The romantic side of Tom Sawyer is shown in most delightfully
humorous fashion in the account of his difficult devices to aid in
the
easy escape of Jim, a runaway negro. Jim is an admirably drawn
character. There have been not a few fine and firm portraits of
negroes
in recent American fiction, of which Mr. Cable's Bras-Coup&eacute;
in the <i>Grandissimes</i> is perhaps the most vigorous, and Mr.
Harris's Mingo and Uncle Remus and Blue Dave are the most gentle.
Jim is worthy to rank with these; and the essential simplicity and
kindliness and generosity of the Southern negro have never been
better shown than here by Mark Twain. Nor are Tom Sawyer and
Huck Finn and Jim the only fresh and original figures in Mr.
Clemens's
new book; on the contrary, there is scarcely a character of the
many
introduced who does not impress the reader at once as true to life
--
and therefore as new, for life is so varied that a portrait from
life is
sure to be as good as new. That Mr. Clemens draws from life, and
yet
lifts his work from the domain of the photograph to the region of
art,
is evident to any one who will give his work the honest attention
which it deserves. Mr. John T. Raymond, the American comedian,
who performs the character of Colonel Sellers to perfection, is
wont
to say that there is scarcely a town in the West and South-West
where
some man did not claim to be the original of the character. And as
Mark Twain made Colonel Sellers, so has he made the chief players
in the present drama of boyish adventure; they are taken from life,
no
doubt, but they are so aptly chosen and so broadly drawn that they
are
quite as typical as they are actual. They have one great charm, all
of
them  they are not written about and about; they are not described
and dissected and analysed; they appear and play their parts and
disappear; and yet they leave a sharp impression of indubitable
vitality
and individuality. No one, we venture to say, who reads this book
will
readily forget the Duke and the King, a pair of as pleasant
'confidence
operators' as one may meet in a day's journey, who leave the story
in
the most appropriate fashion, being clothed in tar and feathers and
ridden on a rail. Of the more broadly humorous passages -- and they
abound -- we have not left ourselves space to speak; they are to
the
full as funny as in any of Mark Twain's other books; and, perhaps,
in
no other book has the humourist shown so much artistic restraint,
for
there is in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> no mere 'comic copy,' no
straining
after effect; one  might almost say that there is no waste word in
it.
Nor have we left  ourselves room to do more than say a good word
for the illustrations,  which, although slight and unpretending,
are far
better than those to be  found in most of Mark Twain's books. For
one
thing, they actually  illustrate -- and this is a rare quality in
illustrations
nowadays. They give  the reader a distinct idea of the Duke and the
King, of Jim and of Colonel Sherburn, of the Shepherdsons and the
Grangerfords. They are all by one artist, Mr. E. W. Kemble,
hitherto
known to us only as the illustrator of the <i>Thompson Street Poker
Club</i>, an amusing romance of highly-coloured life in New York.

<p>Mark Twain long since learned the art of writing for the market.
His recent books have the character of commercial ventures. He
probably estimates in advance his profits. His books are not sold
to any great extent over the counters of booksellers, but are
circulated by subscription agents. Lately Mark Twain, it is
reported, has become the silent partner in a publishing house, the
imprint of which is on the present volume. Those who read "Tom
Sawyer" and like it will probably read "Huckleberry Finn," and like
it in a less degree. No book has been put on the market with more
advertising. When Mark Twain represented "Tom Sawyer" as getting a
job of free white-washing done by his cronies, because there was
fun in it, and only just enough to go around, he disclosed his own
tactics in the matter of free advertising. When it was given out
that some one had tampered with the engravings in the printing
office, in a mysterious way, that accounted for the delay in
bringing out the book, it secured at the same time many thousand
dollars' worth of free advertising. Then the <i>Century</i> gave
the enterprise a lift by publishing a chapter of the book in
advance, which, while an advertisement, was still a readable
article. "Huckleberry Finn" has been introduced to the world as it
were with the blare of trumpets. It comes also with this warning:
"Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be
prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral in it will be
banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot." So
then there is neither motive, moral, nor plot. But there still
remain one hundred and seventy-four wood cuts, which, according to
the view of the author, ought to be liberally peppered through the
volume. Many of the designs are drawn with spirit, and are all
executed well enough for the plan of the book.

</p><p>The tone of the volume is indicated in the opening
paragraphs:</p>
<lb>
<p>
You don't know me, without you have read a book by the name of "The
Adventures of 'Tom Sawyer,' " but that ain't no matter. That book
was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth mainly. There
were things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That
is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied, one time or another,
without it was "Aunt Polly" or the widow, or maybe "Mary." "Aunt
Polly"--Tom's "Aunt Polly," she is--and "Mary," and the "widow
Douglas," is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true
book; with stretchers, as I said before.</p>
<lb>
<p>The author starts out by telling his juvenile readers that there
are some lies in his book--that most people lie, and that it is not
very bad after all. Of course the warning is timely that persons
attempting to seek a moral in the story should be banished.</p>
<lb>
<p>Now the way the book winds up is this: "Tom" and me found the
money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got
$6,000 a piece--all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it
was piled up. Well, "Judge Thatcher," he took it and put it out at
interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year
round--more than a body could tell what to do with. The "widow
Douglas," she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize
me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering
how dismal, regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and
so, when I could stand it no longer, I lit out. I got into my old
rags and my sugar hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But
"Tom Sawyer," he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band
of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be
respectable. So I went back.</p>
<lb>
<p>It is an amusing story if such scrap-work can be called a story.
The author rarely fails when he sets out to tickle the ribs of
young or old. There is so little genuine wit in the world, that the
little must be made to go a great way. Mark Twain has the genuine
vein; it nearly pinches out here and there, and in many places it
is hardly an inch wide by miners' measurement. The funny book will
always be read in this world of dryness and dearth. Many fastidious
people hide their scruples, because they want to be amused. Comedy
pays better than tragedy. The author contrives to puncture a great
many shams. His satire in this respect, even when he declares that
it is aimless, is directed with a purpose. Whether young people who
read this volume will be the better for it will be an open
question. Here is another paragraph where the warning not to seek
for a moral might be applicable: </p>
<lb>
<p>Every night, now I used to slip ashore, towards 10 o'clock, at
some little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal,
or bacon, or other stuff to eat, and sometimes I lifted a chicken
that warn't roosting comfortable, and took him along. Pap always
said, take a chicken when you get a chance, because if you don't
want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good
deed ain't ever forgot. I never see pap when he didn't want the
chicken himself, but that is what he used to say, anyway.</p>
<lb>
<p>The author turns his knowledge of Western dialects to account.
Mississippi river scenes and associations are always available. The
art of book-making from Twain's point of view is well illustrated
here. He is alive always to the fact that young people will not
read a dull book. He never makes a dull one. There is very little
of literary art in the story. It is a string of incidents
ingeniously fastened together. The spice of juvenile wickedness and
dare-deviltry give a zest to the book. "Huckleberry Finn" is, in a
restricted sense, a typical character. Yet the type is not
altogether desirable, nor is it one that most parents who want a
future of promise for their young folks would select without some
hesitation. The trouble with "Tom Sawyer" and "Huckleberry Finn" is
not that they are too good for this world; even as the world goes,
they are not good enough. Beyond the recognition that there is a
great deal of "fun," as boys would put the case, it must also be
admitted that not a little of the "assisted wit" is of the more
dreary sort, as if the author was subjected to a pretty hard strain
at times to work his facetious vein. The book is attractive enough
to command commercial success, and that, it may be supposed, was
the inspiring motive in its production. </p>

"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" must be pronounced the most
amusing book Mark Twain has written for years. It is a  more minute
and faithful picture of Southwestern manners and customs fifty
years ago than was "Life on the Mississippi," while in regard to
the dialect it surpasses any of the author's previous stories in
the command of the half-dozen species of patois which passed for
the  English language in old Missouri. Mark Twain may be called the
Edison of our literature. There is no limit to his inventive
genius, and the best proof of its range and originality is found in
this book, in which the reader's interest is so strongly enlisted
in the fortunes of two boys and a runaway negro that he follows
their adventures with keen curiosity, although his common sense
tells him that the incidents are as absurd and fantastic in many
was as the "Arabian Nights." Here is where the genius and the human
nature of the author come in. Nothing else can explain such a
<i>tour de force</i> as this, in which the most unlikely materials
are transmuted into a work of literary art. The plot is extremely
simple. Huckleberry Finn, who appeared incidentally in the
veracious adventuers of Tom Sawyer, concludes to go down the
Mississippi to get rid of his drunken father. He falls in with a
runaway negor, and the book is given up to the adventures of this
coupe on a raft on the river, re-enforced by two sharpers known as
the Duke and the King, and afterward by Tom Sawyer. In many parts
of the book, but especially at the outset, some of the
conversations are unnecessarily spun out, on the style of the elder
Dumas when he was writing at so much the word, but when the story
gets under good headway it is remarkably well proportioned, and the
interest is never allowed to flag for a moment. The very best
episodes are those which detail the swindling schemes of the two
river sharpers, who impose upon Huckleberry and the negro by
declaring that they are scions of royalty. These chapters were
printed in the <i>Century</i> under the title of "Royalty on the
Mississippi," but they left the fate of the two heroes in doubt, so
that most readers of the performances of the "Royal Nonesuch," and
the personation of the two brothers from England will want to know
what was the final result of their schemes.
</p><p>The incidental descriptions of character are always good.
Take, for instance, this small picture of Huck's father--a typical
Pike county drunkard:</p>
<lb>
<p>He was most 50, and he looked it. His hair was long and tangled
and greasy and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining
through it like he was behind vines. It was all black, no gray; so
was his long, mixed-up whiskers. There warn't no colorin his face,
where his face showed--it was white; not like another man's white,
but a white to make a body sick, a whote to make a body's flesh
crawl--a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white. As for his
clothes--just rags, that was all.</p>
<lb>
<p>On the raft, while floating down the Mississippi, Huck has an
excellent opportunity to exercise his gift for lying. This is
simply phenomenal. The boy enjoys mendacity; he lies for the mere
lust of lying, and the ingenuity with which he piles one fiction on
top of another will excite the reader's wonder and admiration. Just
before the runaways get fairly started, Huck visits a neighboring
town to get information and encounters a farmer's wife. He is
dressed up in an old calico gown and pretends to be a girl
searching for her relations. The woman suspects his sex and tries
various devices to ascertain if her suspicions are true. Among
these is threading a needle and throwing a bar of lead at the rats
which swarm around the house. Finally she makes Huck own up that he
is a boy, and then gives him this sound advice in regard to
personating a girl:</p>
<lb>
<p>"Don't you go about women in that old calico. You do a girl
tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe. Bless you, child,
when you set out to thread a needle, don't hold the thread still
and fetch the needle up to it. Hold the needle still and poke the
thread at it--that's the way a woman most always does, but a man
always does 'tother way. And when you throw at a rat or anything
hitch yourself up a-tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as
awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot.
Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there
for it to turn on--like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with
your arm out to one side, like a boy. And mind you, when a girl
tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she
don't clap them together the way you did when you catched the lump
of lead. Why, I spotted you for a  boy when you was threading the
needle, and I contrived the other things just to make certain."</p>
<lb>
<p>Some of the most succulent homor is connected with the swindling
exploits of the Duke and the King, who "work" the towns along the
bank and make considerable money. Their crowning work was in
playing the role of the English heirs of old Peter Wilks, a moneyed
resident of one of the river towns, who had just died. In the
construction of this plot Mark Twain surpasses himself and the
amount of really plausible lies which he manages to dovetail
together is something extraordinary. A half-dozen times the
adventurers are on the eve of exposure, but their fertility and
luck save them. Space is lacking to do more than give one extract
from this episode, which is a story in itself, descriptive of the
Arkansas undertaker at the funeral of old Peter: </p>
<lb>
<p>When the place was packed full the undertaker he
slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways,
putting on
the last touches, and getting
people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and
making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke;
he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he
opened up passageways, and done it with nods, and
signs with his hands. Then he took his place over
against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest,
stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn't no more
smile to him than there is to a ham.
 </p>
<p>They had borrowed a melodeum  --  a sick one; and
when everything was ready a young woman set down
and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky,
and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the
only one that had a good thing, according to my
notion. Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow
and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the
most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body
ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most
powerful racket, and he kept it up right along; the
parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait
 --  you couldn't hear yourself think. It was right
down awkward, and nobody didn't seem to know what
to do. But pretty soon they see that long-legged
undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to
say, "Don't you worry  --  just depend on me." Then
he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall,
just his shoulders showing over the people's heads.
So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and more

outrageous all the time; and at
last, when he had gone around two sides of the room,
he disappears down cellar. Then in about two seconds
we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a
most amazing howl or two, and then everything was
dead still, and the parson begun his solemn talk where
he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker's back
and
shoulders gliding along the wall
again; and so he glided and glided around three sides
of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth
with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the
preacher, over the people's heads, and says, in a kind
of a coarse whisper, "He had a rat!" Then he
drooped down and glided along the wall again to his
place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to the
people, because naturally they wanted to know. A
little thing like that don't cost nothing, and it's just the
little things that makes a man to be looked up to and
liked. There warn't no more popular man in town
than what that undertaker was.</p>
<lb>
<p>There are dozens of descriptive bits as good as this and others
in which there is no attempt at caricature, such, for instance, as
the picture of the old one-horse cotton plantation of Phelps, which
any one who has seen the South will recognize as a type. What Mark
Twain can do in short sketches of persons is shown by the portrait
of old Mrs. Hotchkiss, which is one of the best things in the book.
Any one who has ever lived in the Southwest, or who has visited
that section, will recognize the truth of all these sketches and
the art with which they are brought into this story. To all readers
we can commend the story as eminently readable. The person who can
withstand the abounding humor of this book must be proof against
all jokes except of the Joe Miller order. The volume is very well
gotten up, the illustrations adding materially to the fun of the
story.

<p>The San Francisco agents of this book give notice that, though
some unavoidable delays have occurred, this volume is now ready for
delivery to subscribers. As to the work itself, it is well
described by the author, as being without a motive, a moral, or a
plot. The only reason to be, as the French say, is probably that
the author thought he could make some money by publishing a book of
some kind, and here it is--such as it is. It is apparently, as the
art critics say, a pot-boiler in its baldest form. AS a picture of
life in the Southwest, however, there is little to be said in the
book's favor, though there are several passages which are drawn
with much ability, with occasionally a touch of a sort of grotesque
pathos which greatly interests the reader. As to the rest, it is
very much of the same character as many of the author's Pacific
Coast sketches, in the utter absence of truth and being unlike
anything that ever existed in the earth, above the earth, or in the
waters under the earth. Some twenty-two years since, when Mr.
Clemens was working as a reporter on the <i>Territorial
Enterprise,</i> published in Virginia City, Nevada, he signalized
his career by getting up a series of startling stories, the most
prominent feature of which was the lack of a grain of fact. One of
Clemens' most notorious lucutrations in this line was the report of
the massacre of a whole family at Van Sickles or Empire City, which
caused much horror and also great annoyance. Mark Twain contended
that this was a good joke, and the parties who were inconvenienced
should not have got angry. When, however, it was his ox that was
gored, there were no such feelings of equanimity exhibited on his
side of the house. For instance, afterward, when he paid a visit to
his old haunts on the Comstock, a party of his former intimates
played a practical joke on him, he was one of the maddest mortals
who could be seen in a day's march. Something, however, should be
said in praise of the style in which the book has been published.
It is plentifully illustrated with engravings of no mean skill, and
is well printed in fine, clear type.

<p><i>A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur</i>, by Mark Twain
(Samuel L. Clemens), published by Messrs. Chatto & Windus, is a
rather laborious piece of fun with a sort of purpose in it. One of the
illustrations, early in the volume, represents a Yankee tickling with a
straw the nose of a gigantic statue of a lion, and indicates the general
nature of the serious purport of the 525 pages of that very American
kind of American humour of which "Mark Twain" is the chief master.
Laughing at British institutions, and showing that the good old times
were uncommonly bad times for the people, and that not a few of the
historical privileges which still exist do not suit the ideas of the great
republic of the West, afford a good deal of harmless amusement and
opportunities for very trite comment. It is a mistake to decide that
ridicule cast upon the story of Arthur is an offence in any way other
than in the matter of taste in jokes. Sir Thomas Malory and Lord
Tennyson will survive. Masterpieces will stand any amount of parody.
"The Burial of Sir John Moore" and Gray's "Elegy" are just as
impressive and admirable as if they had not been parodied with all
sorts of jocularity and ribaldry scores of times. One may easily read
Mark Twain's book without any ill will; but it is a harder task to read it
with sustained merriment. By writing so much the author has shown
how mechanical his method really is, and, with all respect for the
cleverness of the writers of Gaiety burlesques, one doubts if anybody
could be amused by reading one of them if it ran to five hundred
pages. That is, however, the sort of task which Mark Twain offers to
his readers. One may be pardoned for confessing that the task has
proved too severe. A trial of several chapters taken at random shows
that the author is still as fresh as ever in his racy contrasts between
things ancient and modern, and as quaint in his droll expressions. He
can raise a laugh once, twice, or even twenty times, but not a
thousand.</p>

<p>Of all the extraordinary conceits that have germinated in his fruitful
imagination, nothing more delicious has ever occurred to Mark Twain
than that of running riot among the legendary times of our ancestral race
by placing "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court." These
quoted  words form the title of the latest successor to<i> Innocents
Abroad</i>. Here is a rare field for the unbridled play of fancy, and right
bravely has the author used his opportunity. There is a most audacious
rollicking around among the dusty bric-a-brac of chivalry -- which is not
handled at all gently -- and a merry tossing about of poetic finery in a
way that  ruthlessly exposes in their literal ugliness the illusively mantled
facts. Of course there is most abundant fun, and Mark Twain's rich
humor never coursed more freely than here, where just provocation is
never absent.  But there is much more than this; the sources of the
claims of aristocratic privileges and royal prerogatives that yet linger in
the world  are so exposed to the full glare of the sun of 19th century
common sense, are shown in so ridiculous an aspect, that the work can
hardly fail to do yeoman service in destroying the still existing remnants
of respect for  such pretensions. Through the book there is a steady
flowing undercurrent of earnest purpose, and the pages are eloquent
with a true American love of freedom, a sympathy with the rights of the
common people, and an indignant hatred of oppression of the poor, the
lowly and the weak, by the rich, the powerful and the  proud. While
much false glamour is dispelled by resolving it into  absurdity under the
touchstone of truth, the book is marked by real beauty, by a poetry of
style worthy of its rich material, with much sympathetic tenderness, as
well as frankness of speech. The quaint early English speech is handled
with the same artistic skill that characterized the author's facile handling
of the stately Elizabethan in  that lovely idyll of childhood, <i>The
Prince and the Pauper</i>, and the constant admixture of a concisely
expressive American vernacular thereto makes a contrast of lingual
coloring that is unspeakably delightful.</p>

<p>We may fancy that the same matter-of-fact Englishman who
seriously reasoned that certain statements in <i>Innocents Abroad</i>
were preposterously absurd, and could not be based upon fact, might
again step forward to break a lance against this book by showing, from
historical and philological data, that such a language could not possibly
have been spoken in the sixth century, since the English tongue did not
exist, and that the use of Norman French names before the conquest is
anachronistic in the highest degree! But this is an excursion back into
the England of the chronicles, and not of strict chronology, and that
eminent ethnologist, Tylor, would undoubtedly perceive with delight the
accuracy of scientific perception in the treatment of human nature which
marks the book. For, in order to characterize with truth a past period
we must make ourselves familiar with some existing state of society that
is analogous therewith. Only under such conditions can a faithful
historical romance be written, for otherwise the writer cannot fail to
modernize his work, and falsify its life with 19th century sentiments that
could not have been known in a previous age. By resorting to the
principle that "distribution in time" is paralleled by "distribution in
space," we may solve many a problem. So there is a certain aspect of
sober truth  in this most fanciful tale, and, just as the Connecticut
Yankee went back into the days of King Arthur's court, so might he go
out into the world today, into Central Asia or Africa, or even into
certain spots in this United States of ours, find himself amidst social
conditions very similar to those of 1300 years ago, and even work his
astonishing 19th century miracles with like result. For it is a fact that,
when Frank Hamilton Cushing astounded the Zuni Indians with an
acoustic telephone constructed of two tomato cans and a string, they
deemed him a magician, and tried him for witchcraft. And, for parallels
of the inhumanities which, as we here read of them, seem to have been
left far behind us in the track of the centuries, we have but to look with
George Kennan into the dungeons of Siberia; and, in our own country,
read the records of the investigations into the horrors of the almshouses,
jails and lunatic hospitals here in this enlightened commonwealth of
Massachusetts so late as the time of Horace Mann, or look to the record
of the nameless barbarities of negro slavery alive in the memories of men
still young. How the conscience and the sympathies of the world have
quickened with the advent of the railway, the steamship and the
telegraph! We have, after all, but just passed out across the threshold of
the dark ages, and, in view of the few steps we have taken, we can
hardly doubt that we are yet to make an infinitely mightier progress into
the light of a genuine civilization, putting far behind us the veneered
barbarism of the present, that still retains the old standards of conduct
and intercourse for our guidance in all "practical" affairs.</p>
<p>As an instance of the scientific fidelity of this book in its picture of
mediaeval society, we may take this from the description of the
company at King Arthur's Round Table, around which there was an
average of about two dogs to one man, watching for bones:</p>
<center>LINK CY1</center>

<p>The following also illustrates an exact perception of the essentially
savage traits of such a people: "Finally it occurred to me all of a sudden
that these animals didn't reason; that they never put this and that
together; that all their talk showed that they didn't know a discrepancy
when they saw it." Again, when Sir Sagramour le Desirous caught a
chance remark of the Yankee applied to some one else and thought it
meant for him, and so challenged him to the memorable encounter that
took place several years after, and was fought with lariat versus lance,
the "Sir Boss," as he was called said: "Whenever one of those people
got a thing into his head, there was no getting it out again. I knew that,
so I saved my breath, and offered no explanations." The foregoing
characterizations might apply equally well to a tribe of Dakota Indians,
to their hardly more civilized foes, the cowboys of the plains, to the
mountaineers of Tennessee and Georgia, or even to the savages in our
great city slums.</p>

<p>By some strange means, perhaps more marvellous than those by
which Edward Bellamy transferred the hero of <i>Looking
Backward</i> forward to the year 2000, the Yankee is carried back
1300 years in time, and in the record of his adventures affords us
another and very instructive sort of <i>Looking Backward</i>.</p>

<p>The advance in the art of popular bookmaking in the past two
decades is illustrated by the contrast between <i>Innocents Abroad</i>
and this volume. In illustration, the progress is particularly notable. Even
a child of today would turn in contempt from the crude woodcuts of the
former to the beautiful pen-and-ink drawings by Dan Beard that adorn
the new work. These drawings are graceful, picturesque and thoroughly
characteristic of the spirit of the book. Many of them embody instructive
allegories, as, for instance, in a cut of Justice, with her scales, one
containing the heavy hammer of "Labor" and the other the baubles of
"Aristocracy," but the latter made to outweigh the former by means of
the string of "Self-interest," artfully attached to the toe of "Law," who
stands by; another, in a similar vein, shows the Justice of the 19th
century and Justice of the sixth century standing opposite each other,
and simultaneously remarking, "Sister, your blind is disarranged," for,
with the same manner of string attached to the toe of each, "Money" is
made to outweigh "Labor" by the former, just as titles are made heavier
in the balance by the latter. One little cut shows "Decorations of Sixth
Century Aristocracy" as "Rewards for all Babes Born Under Specified
Conditions," such as "Slave Driver," "Robber of Unarmed Savages,"
"Robber of Orphans," "Absorber of Taxes," "Murderer of Rivals," etc.,
the whole supported by "Honi soit qui mal y pense!" Another illustrates
the remark of the king concerning a peasant: "Brother! to dirt like this?"
by depicting the three phases of oppression of man by man, first by
violence under the sword of royal power, then by the book of "law,"
making man subject to the slave driver's lash, and last, the subjection of
the workingman to the millions of the monopolist. A strong and spirited
picture of an arrogant slave driver shows in its face the unmistakable
portrait of a celebrated American billionaire and stock gambler.</p>

<p>We are so accustomed to regard England of today as "essentially a
republic, with a monarchical head," that it seems strange that the
utterances of this book, so thoroughly in accordance with accepted
American ideas, should find any difficulty in obtaining publicity in
England, yet so strong is the prejudice there still that its English
publisher has cut out some of the best passages, including a portion of
the preface, with some persiflage about "the divine right of kings."</p>

<p>Mark Twain's latest book, which his publishers have brought out
in a handsome volume, seems to us the poorest of all his productions
thus far. The conceit of taking a Yankee of this generation of
telephones and the electric light back to King Arthur's Court may
please some minds, if presented in a story of moderate length, but
there can be few who will really enjoy it when long-drawn out to the
extent of nearly six hundred pages. Whatever value Mr. Clemens might
have incidentally imparted to his burlesque by giving something like a
correct picture of the customs of the time in which the mythical King
flourished is entirely absent. He has crowded into his picture a great
number of episodes illustrating "ungentle laws and customs" which are
historical, indeed; but he says:</p>

<p><font size=-1>It is not pretended that these laws and customs
existed in England in the sixth century; no, it is only pretended that,
inasmuch as they existed in the English and other civilizations of far
later times, it is safe to consider that it is no libel upon the sixth
century to suppose them to have been in practice in that day also. One
is quite justified in inferring that wherever one of these laws or
customs was lacking in that remote time, its place was competently
filled by a worse one.</font></p>

<p>Mr. Clemens' method of writing history would justify him in
picturing the Connecticut of the seventeenth century as afflicted with
loose divorce customs and great corruption at the polls -- or
something worse -- simply because these are vices of the nineteenth
century! To crowd into a representation of one age the social evils of
all its successors known to us, and to omit those special redeeming
features of the time which made life tolerable, is a very irrational
proceeding.</p>
<p>The serious aim under Mark Twain's travesty is the glorification of
American Protestant democracy. The effort fails through the extreme
partiality of the procedure. Even a Mark Twain, the persistent teacher
of irreverence for great men and great events, should have some little
respect left for fair play. Mr. Clemens' previous books have been bad
enough in their strong encouragement of one of the worst tendencies
in a democratic State, the inclination to sheer flippancy and unmanly
irreverence in the face of the natural sanctities of private life and the
grand heroisms of human history. But this volume goes much further
in its endeavor to belittle a century surrounded with romantic light by
men of later times, who thus fell back upon poetry as a slight relief to
the hard prose of their actual lot. A buffoon, like the hero of this tale,
playing his contemptible tricks where Sir Thomas Malory has trod with
a noble teaching of knightly courtesy, and uttering his witless jokes
where Tennyson has drawn so many a high moral of true gentleness, is
a sorry spectacle. It is not calculated to make a reflecting person proud
of a shallow and self-complacent generation which can enjoy such
so-called humor.</p>

<p>The one consolation to be derived from this melancholy product of
the American mind in the ninth decade of the nineteenth century is
that, equally in its serious and in its jesting parts, it must bring about a
healthy reaction in some of its admiring readers because it overshoots
the mark; because its history is perverse, in its one-sided accumulation
of evils; and because its humor will be wearisome in the extreme when
its falsity is seen.</p>

<p>When Mr. Clemens relates his Life on the Mississippi with
characteristic American exaggeration, we cannot fail to laugh and
become friends. But when he prostitutes his humorous gift to the base
uses of historical injustice, democratic bigotry, Protestant intolerance,
and nineteenth-century vainglory, we must express the very sincere
animosity we feel at such a performance. If anything could be less of a
credit to our literature than the matter of this book, it certainly is the
illustrations which disfigure it. A Protestant of the Protestants himself,
the writer of this review cannot refrain from thus freeing his soul in the
cause of literary decency when the Roman Catholic Church, that is to
say the Christian Church in one of the noblest periods of its history, is
thus grossly assailed by the writer and the illustrator of this tiresome
travesty.</p>

<p>...Mr. Clemens, we call him, rather than Mark Twain, because we
feel that in this book our arch-humorist imparts more of his personal
quality than in anything else he has done. Here he is to the full the
humorist, as we know him; but he is very much more, and his strong,
indignant, often infuriate hate of injustice, and his love of equality, burn
hot through the manifold adventures and experiences of the tale. What
he thought about prescriptive right and wrong, we had partly learned in
<i>The Prince and the  Pauper</i>, and in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, but
it is this last book which gives his whole mind. The elastic scheme of the
romance allows it to play freely back and forward between the sixth
century and the nineteenth century; and often while it is working the
reader up to a blasting contempt of monarchy and aristocracy in King
Arthur's time, the dates are magically shifted under him, and he is
confronted with exactly the same principles in Queen Victoria's time.
The delicious satire, the marvellous wit, the wild, free, fantastic humor
are the colors of the tapestry, while the texture is a humanity that lives
in every fibre. At every moment the scene amuses, but it is all the time
an object-lesson in democracy. It makes us glad of our republic and our
epoch; but it does not flatter us into a fond content with them; there are
passages in which we see that the noble of Arthur's day, who battened
on the blood and sweat of his bondmen, is one in essence with the
capitalist of Mr. Harrison's day who grows rich on the labor of his
underpaid wagemen. Our incomparable humorist, whose sarcasm is so
pitiless to the greedy and superstitious clerics of Britain, is in fact of the
same spirit and intention as those bishops who, true to their office,
wrote the other day from New York to all their churches in the
land:</p><lb>
<p>It is a fallacy in social economics, as well as in Christian thinking, to
look upon the labor of men and women and children as a commercial
commodity, to be bought and sold as an inanimate and irresponsible
thing.... The heart and soul of a man cannot be bought or hired in any
market, and to act as if they were not needed in the doing of the world's
vast work is as unchristian as it is unwise. </p><lb>
<p>Mr. Clemens's glimpses of monastic life in Arthur's realm are true
enough; and if they are not the whole truth of the matter, one may easily
get it in some such book as Mr. Brace's <i>Gesta Christi</i>, where the
full light of history is thrown upon the transformation of the world, if
not the church, under the influence of Christianity. In the mean time, if
any one feels that the justice done the churchmen of King Arthur's time
is too much of one kind, let him turn to that heart-breaking scene where
the brave monk stands with the mother and her babe on the scaffold,
and execrates the hideous law which puts her to death for stealing
enough to keep her from starving. It is one of many passages in the
story where our civilization of to-day sees itself mirrored in the cruel
barbarism of the past, the same in principle, and only softened in
custom. With shocks of consciousness, one recognizes in such episodes
that the laws are still made for the few against the many, and that the
preservation of things, not men, is still the ideal of legislation. But we do
not wish to leave the reader with the notion that Mr. Clemens's work is
otherwise than obliquely serious. Upon the face of it you have a story no
more openly didactic than <i>Don Quixote</i>, which we found
ourselves more than once thinking of, as we read, though always with
the sense of the kindlier and truer heart of our time. Never once, we
believe, has Mark Twain been funny at the cost of the weak, the
unfriended, the helpless; and this is rather more than you can say of Cid
Hamet ben Engeli. But the two writers are of the same humorous
largeness; and when the Connecticut man rides out at dawn, in a suit of
Arthurian armor, and gradually heats up under the mounting sun in what
he calls that stove; and a fly gets between the bars of his visor; and he
cannot reach his handkerchief in his helmet to wipe the sweat from his
streaming face; and at last when he cannot bear it any longer, and
dismounts at the side of a brook, and makes the distressed damsel who
has been riding behind him take off his helmet, and fill it with water, and
pour gallon after gallon down the collar of his wrought-iron cutaway,
you have a situation of as huge a grotesqueness as any that Cervantes
conceived.</p>

<p>The distressed damsel is the Lady Corisande; he calls her Sandy, and
he is troubled in mind at riding about the country with her in that way;
for he is not only very doubtful that there is nothing in the castle where
she says there are certain princesses imprisoned and persecuted by
certain giants, but he feels that it is not quite nice: he is engaged to a
young lady in East Hartford, and he finds Sandy a fearful bore at first,
though in the end he loves and marries her, finding that he hopelessly
antedates the East Hartford young lady by thirteen centuries. How he
gets into King Arthur's realm, the author concerns himself as little as any
of us do with the mechanism of our dreams. In fact the whole story has
the lawless operation of a dream; none of its prodigies are accounted
for: they take themselves for granted, and neither explain nor justify
themselves. Here he is, that Connecticut man, foreman of one of the
shops in Colt's pistol factory, and full to the throat of the invention and
the self-satisfaction of the nineteenth century, at the court of the mythic
Arthur. He is promptly recognized as a being of extraordinary powers,
and becomes the king's right-hand man, with the title of The Boss; but
as he has apparently no lineage or blazon, he has no social standing, and
the meanest noble has precedence of him, just as would happen in
England to-day. The reader may faintly fancy the consequences flowing
from this situation, which he will find so vividly fancied for him in the
book; but they are simply irreportable. The scheme confesses allegiance
to nothing; the incidents, the facts follow as they will. The Boss cannot
rest from introducing the apparatus of our time, and he tries to impart
its spirit, with a thousand most astonishing effects. He starts a daily
paper in Camelot; he torpedoes a holy well; he blows up a party of
insolent knights with a dynamite bomb; when he and the king disguise
themselves as peasants, in order to learn the real life of the people, and
are taken and sold for slaves, and then sent to the gallows for the
murder of their master, Launcelot arrives to their rescue with live
hundred knights on bicycles. It all ends with the Boss's proclamation of
the Republic after Arthur's death, and his destruction of the whole
chivalry of England by electricity.</p>

<p>We can give no proper notion of the measureless play of an
imagination which has a gigantic jollity in its feats, together with the
tenderest sympathy. There are incidents in this wonder-book which
wring the heart for what has been of cruelty and wrong in the past, and
leave it burning with shame and hate for the conditions which are of like
effect in the present. It is one of its magical properties that the fantastic
fable of Arthur's far-off time is also too often the sad truth of ours; and
the magician who makes us feel in it that we have just begun to know
his power, teaches equality and fraternity in every phase of his
phantasmagory.</p>

<p>He leaves, to be sure, little of the romance of the olden time, but no
one is more alive to the simple, mostly tragic poetry of it; and we do not
remember any book which imparts so clear a sense of what was truly
heroic in it. With all his scorn of kingcraft, and all his ireful contempt of
caste, no one yet has been fairer to the nobility of character which they
cost so much too much to develop. The mainly ridiculous Arthur of Mr.
Clemens has his moments of being as fine and high as the Arthur of
Lord Tennyson; and the keener light which shows his knights and ladies
in their childlike simplicity and their innocent coarseness throws all their
best qualities into relief. This book is in its last effect the most
matter-of-fact narrative, for it is always true to human nature, the only
truth possible, the only truth essential, to fiction. The humor of the
conception and of the performance is simply immense; but more than
ever Mr. Clemens's humor seems the sunny break of his intense
conviction. We must all recognize him here as first of those who laugh,
not merely because his fun is unrivalled, but because there is a force of
right feeling and clear thinking in it that never got into fun before,
except in <i>The Bigelow Papers</i>. Throughout, the text in all its
circumstance and meaning is supplemented by the illustrations of an
artist who has entered into the wrath and the pathos as well as the fun of
the thing, and made them his own.</p>

<p>This kind of humor, the American kind, the kind employed in the
service of democracy, of humanity, began with us a long time ago; in
fact Franklin may be said to have torn it with the lightning from the
skies. Some time, some such critic as Mr. T. S. Perry (if we ever have
another such) will study its evolution in the century of our literature and
civilization; but no one need deny himself meanwhile the pleasure we
feel in Mr. Clemens's book as its highest development.</p>

At this holiday season, in books and newspapers, on stage and in
drawing-room, the poet and the painter, the author, the actor, and
the dramatist compete with one another to bring before young and
old scenes and suggestions of beauty, heroism, purity, and truth. One
writer is an exception. M<font size=-1>ARK</font> T<font size=-1>WAIN</font>
sets himself to show the seamy side of the
legendary Round Table of King A<font size=-1>RTHUR'S</font>
time. He depicts all the vices of feudalism -- the licentiousness of the
nobles, their arrogance and insolence to the middle classes, their
neglect of the poor, their hours of gluttony and idleness, varied by
raids and brawls and riotous disorders. He describes how a Yankee
visiting the Court uses modern inventions, defeats the best warriors,
and redresses the wrongs of the poor. It is quite possible that a
serious purpose underlies what otherwise seems a vulgar travesty.
We have every regard for M<font size=-1>ARK</font> T<font
size=-1>WAIN</font> -- a writer who has enriched English
literature by admirable descriptions of boy life, and who in <i>The
Prince and the Pauper</i> has given a vivid picture of
medi&aedig;val times. A book, however, that tries to deface our
moral and literary currency by bruising and soiling the image of King
A<font size=-1>RTHUR</font>, as left to us by legend and
consecrated by poetry, is a very unworthy production of the great
humourist's pen. No doubt there is one element of wit -- incongruity
-- in bringing a Yankee from Connecticut face to face with feudal
knights; but sharp contrast between vulgar facts and antique ideas is
not the only thing necessary for humour. If it were, then a travelling
Cockney putting a flaming tie round the neck of the "Apollo
Belvidere," or sticking a clay pipe between the lips of the "Venus de
Medici," would be a matter-of fact M<font size=-1>ARK</font>
T<font size=-1>WAIN</font>, and as much entitled to respect.
Burlesque and travesty are satire brought down to the meanest
capacity, and they have their proper province when pretentious
falsehoods put on the masks of solemnity and truth. Stilted tragedies,
artificial melodramas, unnatural acting, are properly held up to
ridicule on the stage or in parodies. The mannerisms of a popular
writer like C<font size=-1>ARLYLE</font>, B<font size=-1>ROWNING</font>,
or even T<font size=-1>ENNYSON</font>,
may, through caricature, be good-humouredly exposed; but an attack
on the ideals associated with King A<font size=-1>RTHUR</font> is
a coarse pandering to that passion for irreverence which is at the
basis of a great deal of Yankee wit. To make a jest of facts, phrases,
or words -- Scriptural, heroic, or legendary -- that are held in awe or
reverence by other men is the open purpose of every witling on a
Western print, who  endeavours to follow in the footsteps of A<font
size=-1>RTEMUS</font> W<font size=-1>ARD</font>, B<font
size=-1>RET</font>  H<font size=-1>ARTE</font>, and M<font
size=-1>ARK</font> T<font size=-1>WAIN</font>. They may
finally be successful enough to destroy their own trade. They now
live by shocking decent people who still retain love for the Bible,
H<font size=-1>OMER</font>, S<font size=-1>HAKESPEARE</font>, S<font
size=-1>COTT</font>, and
T<font size=-1>ENNYSON</font>; but when they have thoroughly
trained a rising generation  to respect nothing their irreverence will
fall flat.
</p>

<p>The stories of King A<font size=-1>RTHUR</font> that have
come down to us represent in  legendary form not any historical fact,
but an ideal of kingship and  knighthood which had birth in the hearts
and aspirations of medi&aelig;val men. This was their ideal of what a
King amongst his warriors ought to be, and the beautiful image has
fired the thoughts and purified the imagination of millions of men and
women for many generations. Will this shrine in human souls be
destroyed because a Yankee scribe chooses to fling pellets of mud
upon the high altar? The instincts of the past and the genius of
T<font size=-1>ENNYSON</font> have consecrated for ever "the
goodliest fellowship of famous knights Whereof this world holds
record." The Round Table is dissolved, but we can still "delight our
souls with talk of knightly deeds," as they at Camelot in the storied
past. We can still apply the image of the ideal knight as a criterion of
modern worth. King A<font size=-1>RTHUR</font> swore each of
his followers to "reverence his conscience as his King, To ride abroad
redressing human wrongs, To speak no slander, no, nor listen to it,
To honour his own word as if his G<font size=-1>OD'S</font>, To
lead sweet lives in purest chastity. To love one maiden only, cleave
to her, And worship her by years of noble deeds." Such an oath
presented to a modern Yankee would seem to convey in almost every
phrase a covert insult to American institutions. In a land where
commercial fraud and industrial adulteration are fine arts we had
better  omit appeals to "conscience." The United States are not likely
to "ride abroad redressing human wrong" -- as they never gave a
dollar or a man to help Greece, Poland, Hungary, or Italy in their
struggles to be free. "To speak no slander, no, nor listen to it," would
utterly uproot America's free press -- based to a great extent on
scandalous personalities. Loving one maiden only and cleaving to
her must seem too "high-toned" in the States, where there are many
facilities for ready divorce. So far M<font size=-1>ARK</font>
T<font size=-1>WAIN</font> is right as a Western iconoclast to pelt
with sarcasm ideals which are not included in the Constitution or
customs of the United States. Yet, in spite of all that America has
done or can do to deface images of self-sacrifice and beauty, there
are chosen souls in her own borders who have fulfilled the heroic
ideals of the olden time. The Abolitionists of New England
encountered great perils when they first set out to redress the great
human wrong of negro slavery, and they fought as noble a contest
against organised iniquity as any knight of A<font size=-1>RTHUR'S</font> Court.
They faced political obloquy, mob
violence, loss of limb, sometimes of life, and the falling away of
friends and relatives, because they had inherited the old instinct of
knights, to lead lives of duty to their fellow-men. They were jeered
and derided by the M<font size=-1>ARK</font> T<font size=-1>WAINS</font> of
the day, but their foresight was proved at the
end of the war, when the world recognised the two-fold result, "a
nation saved, a race delivered." What, too, would have been the fate
of the Republic if no ideal image of their country shone before the
souls of the men who died to save the Union? Coward souls at the
North said, "It will cost much money and many lives to re-conquer
the South: let them go; let the Republic break up; what is a country
to us?" but a chivalry that came down from British ancestors
animated the  men who followed G<font size=-1>RANT</font>, and
they kept to their high purpose until the field was won. Where was
M<font size=-1>ARK</font> T<font size=-1>WAIN</font> then?
Why did he not satirise the patriotism that would not let a Republic
be  mutilated? Why did he not sneer at Yankee reverence for a paper
Constitution not a hundred years old? Why did he not sing the glories
of trade as better than any preservation of the Union or liberation of
negro slaves?</p>

<p>Even if we look at the real feudalism idealised in the legends of
King A<font size=-1>RTHUR</font>, it was not all evil. No doubt
there were licentious nobles at all times, and there were great
landlords who were occasionally cruel to the peasants in their fields.
The  change to modern times, however, is not all a gain. A great lord
of old held his possessions by "suit and service"; he was bound to
follow his King to the wars. Now he owns his broad lands free of
duty, and may live a life of shameful luxury when he likes. The
peasant of the olden times was not always in distress. The country
was thinly peopled; he had as much land as he wanted;  the woods
were full of wild game, the streams of fish; except on occasions of
rare famine he was fed well. Such a thing as an eviction was
unknown, and for one good reason -- the lord was not only bound to
serve the King, but to bring men for his army; consequently he had an
interest in raising on his estates a body of faithful followers. The
modern landlord drives his peasants into the towns, where, uncared
for by him, they degenerate and die in slums. We must remember,
too, that the vices of the past were characteristic of rough times; they
were the sins of brutality, not of fraud. A bad knight of the feudal age
wronged a maid or widow, and refused redress; but what are the
offences of a commercial age? In America and in England, to a lesser
extent, financial swindling is elaborately organised. The wicked man
of  modern times does not couch his lance against the weak or lowly;
he sends out a prospectus. In twelve months the widow and orphan
are breadless; the promoter and the financier have added another
twenty thousand to their stores. Were King A<font size=-1>RTHUR</font> to descend in
New York to-morrow he would
make for Wall-street, where he would find a host of men whose word
is as good, and as bad, as their bond -- railway schemers who plunder
the shareholders of a continent, and are ever intent by every device of
falsehood and of plot to deceive each other and to defraud the public.
Talk of the inequality of man! King A<font size=-1>RTHUR</font>
and the meanest menial in his halls were nearer to each other in
conditions of life than the cramp in the slums of New York and the
A<font size=-1>STORS</font>, V<font size=-1>ANDERBILTS</font>, and J<font
size=-1>AY</font> G<font
size=-1>OULDS</font> who have piled up millions extracted from
the pockets of less successful men. The Republic is a 'land of liberty,'
yet its commerce, its railways, and is manufactures are in the hands
of a few cliques of almost irresponsible capitalists, who control
tariffs, markets, and politics in order that they may be enriched, to
the disadvantage of the masses. Which, then, is to be most admired --
the supremacy of a knight or the success of a financier?  Under which
King will the Americans serve -- the ideal or the real?  Will they own
allegiance to King A<font size=-1>RTHUR</font> or J<font size=-1>AY</font>
G<font size=-1>OULD</font>?</p>

<p>Mark Twain has never written anything brighter and wittier
than <i>A Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i>, his latest book,
which is now issued with all the advantages of illustrations that add
zest to the great humorist's fun and satire. The book is as able and
original as <i>The Innocents Abroad</i> or <i>Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn</i>, while it bids fair to be fully as popular with
the American public as either of these books. It is one long satire on
modern England and Englishmen, under the clever guise of an
attempt to picture the England of the sixth century and of Arthurian
legend. It is said that Mark wrote the story about seven years ago,
but about the time he had completed it he paid a visit to England
and was received so handsomely that he didn't have the heart to
print his bitter satire, that in places reminds one of Swift. Mark
Twain has come up from the people. He is American to the
backbone, and the assumption of natural superiority by titled
English aristocrats and the terrible wrongs inflicted on the working
people, evidently galled him beyond endurance. He has taken his
revenge in this volume, and a thorough going over it is, for he has
mercilessly flayed the follies, vices, cruelties and false pretensions of
English royalty and aristocracy.</p>

<p>A mere statement of the plot of the story shows the ample field
it gives for "most excellent fooling." Mark pretends to find a
Connecticut Yankee in London who recalls his experiences in the
age of King Arthur. The story is told with great realistic effect, and
the extraordinary contrasts of modern slang and archaic speech, of
nineteenth-century progress and sixth-century superstition, when
developed by a master of the art of humor, are inexpressibly droll.
The Yankee is captured by one of the Knights of the Round Table
and brought to the court, where he is about to be executed as a
curious monster, when he chances to remember that an eclipse
occurs on that day. So he adopts the device which Rider Haggard
has used with so much effect in his African romances, and threatens
to destroy the sun unless he is released. The sun's disk begins to be
obscured and before the eclipse is ended he has been made a great
noble, Sir Boss, with ample revenue, and the office of chief adviser
of the King. Then begin contests with jealous knights and especially
bouts of witchcraft with Merlin, in which the famous magician is
completely vanquished by modern science.</p>

<p>Mark's picture of the deficiencies of the Arthurian court in little
conveniences is very droll. "No soap, no matches, no looking glass,
except a metal one about as powerful as a pail of water, and not a
chromo. I had been used to chromos for years and I saw now that
without my suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the
fabric of my being and had become a part of me." And then the
makeshifts for light -- "a bronze dish half full of boarding-house
butter with a blazing rag floating in it was the thing that produced
what is regarded as a light."</p>

<p>And here is the picture of the people of England at the time of
King Arthur, which, curiously enough, is as applicable to the great
body of Englishmen of to-day as to those of thirteen centuries
ago:</p>


<p>These extracts give a fair idea of the sarcasm which the author
heaps upon England. He is in dead earnest when he gets to tilting at
the divine right of kings and aristocrats to make the people slave
and sweat blood for them, but he unbends when he deals with
chivalry. He has no more reverence for the beautiful legends which
Tennyson has embalmed in his <i>Idyles of the King</i> than Bob
Ingersoll has for St. Peter's or the best works of some of the old
masters. Some of his caricature is very funny, as, for instance, this
bit about the search for the Holy Grail:</p>
<lb>

<p>In the last chapters the author puts no bridle on his
extravagance, and the book ends in scenes of warfare that will make
Haggard green with envy. The illustrations by Dan Beard are full of
humor, and bring out the fun of the story. The book is finely printed
and bound and  lavishly illustrated. For sale by subscription only by
A. L. Bancroft &  Co., 132 Post Street, sole agents for the

<p>In selecting as the Novel of the Month Mark Twain's new
story, <i>A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur</i>, I am aware
that I expose myself to many remonstrances. There is a certain
profanation in the subject, and withal a certain dulness in its
treatment. It is not a novel; it is a ponderous political pamphlet, and
so forth and so forth. Nevertheless, to those who endeavour to
understand what the mass of men who speak English are thinking,
as opposed to those who merely care about what they think they
ought to be thinking, this book of Mark Twain's is one of the most
significant of our time. It is notable for its faults quite as much as
for its virtues, and for the irreverent audacity of its original
conception as much as for the cumbrous and strenuous moralising
which makes it at times more like one of Jonathan Edwards'
sermons than a mere buoyant and farcical bubbling up of American
humour.</p>

<p>Mark Twain is one of the few American authors whose writings
are popular throughout the English-speaking world. Our superfine
literary men of culture who pooh-pooh the rough rude vigour of the
American humorist represent a small clique. Mark Twain gets
"directlier at the heart" of the masses than any of the blue-china set
of nimminy-pimminy criticasters. In his own country, if we may
judge from the remarks in the January <i>Harper</i>, <i>A Yankee
at the Court of King Arthur</i> has been received with an
enthusiasm which it has hitherto failed to evoke on this side of the
Atlantic. We read there that</p>
<p>the delicious satire, the marvellous wit, the wild, free, fantastic
humour, are the colours of the tapestry, while the texture is a
humanity that lives in every fibre. We can give no proper notion of
the measureless play of an imagination which has a gigantic jollity in
its feats, together with the tenderest sympathy. The humour of the
conception and of the performance is simply immense; but more
than ever Mr. Clemens's humour seems the sunny break of his
intense conviction.</p>

<p>What a contrast this to the frigid condemnation of the
<i>Speaker</i>: "In his last book Mr. Clemens fails to make us
laugh by any method, even the worst. He is not only dull when he is
offensive, but perhaps even more dull when he is didactic." Yet I
make free to say that the vote of the mass of English people would
be on the side of the American and against the English critic. For
what our critical class has failed to appreciate is that the Education
Act has turned out and is turning out millions of readers who are
much more like the Americans in their tastes, their ideas, and their
sympathies than they are to the English of the cultured, pampered,
and privileged classes. The average English speaking man is the
product of the common school in America, of the public elementary
school in Britain and Australia. His literary taste is not classical but
popular. He prefers Longfellow to Browning, and as a humorist he
enjoys Mark Twain more than all the dainty wits whose delicately
flavoured quips and cranks delight the boudoir and the
drawing-room. This may be most deplorable from the point of view
of the supercilious &aelig;sthetes, but the fact in all its brutality
cannot be too frankly recognised.</p>

<p>Another circumstance which gives significance to the book is
the fact that it is the latest among the volumes whereby Americans
are revolutionising the old country. The two books which have
given the greatest impetus to the social-democratic movement in
recent years have both come to us from America. Henry George's
land nationalisation theories were scouted by the superfine, but they
have gained a firm hold of the public mind. His book has circulated
everywhere, and is still circulating. Of another kind, but operating
in the same direction, is Edward Bellamy's <i>Looking
Backwards</i>, which has supplied our people with a clearly
written-out apocalypse of the new heaven and the new earth that
are to come after the acceptance of the Evangel of Socialism. Mark
Twain's book is a third contribution in the same direction. His
Yankee is a fierce and furious propagandist of anti-monarchical and
aristocratic ideas. Under the veil of sarcasms levelled at King
Arthur we see a genial mockery of the British monarchy of to-day,
with its Royal grants and all its semi-feudal paraphernalia. Nor is it
only at British abuses Mark Twain levels his burly jests. He thwacks
the protectionist American as readily as the aristocratic Briton.
There is something infinitely significant in the very form of his
satire. If there is nothing sacred to a sapper, neither can there be
anything sacred to a descendant of the men of the
<i>Mayflower</i>, who has all the fervour of Mr.
Zeal-for-the-Lord-Busy and the confident, complacent assurance of
Sam Slick, who dismissed unceremoniously the authority of Plato
or Aristotle with the observation that we need not heed what they
said as there were no railways in their times. Here is the New
England Democrat and Puritan as passionately sympathetic with the
common man as the nobles and knights whom he scourges were
sympathetic with men of their order, determined to avenge the
injustice of centuries and by holding the mirror up to fact to punish
the chivalric age by showing how it treated the common man. It is
not longer enough to judge systems of to-day by the effect which
they have upon Hodge the ploughman and Bottom the weaver; the
war must be carried into the enemy's camp, the verdict of history
must be reversed, and all our ideals of the past transformed in the
light of this new and imperious interrogation -- The labouring man,
what did that age or that institution make of him?</p>

<p>Tennyson sang the idyls of the King, and as long as the world
lasts Sir Thomas Malory's marvellous old Romance will fill the
hearts and imaginations of men with some far-off reflection of the
splendours and the glories of that child-like age. But truly he sang
"the old order changeth, giving place to the new," of which can we
have a more notable and even brutal illustration than the apparition
of this vulgar Yankee realist, with his telephones and his dynamite,
his insufferable slang and his infinite self-conceit, in the midst of
King Arthur's Court applying to all the knighthood of the Round
Table the measure of his yard-stick, -- the welfare of the common
man? It is the supreme assertion of the law of numbers, of the
application of the patent arithmetical proposition that ten is more
than one, to the problems of politics and of history.
Tennyson himself, in the "Last Tournament," supplied a vivid
picture, which may well serve as a frontispiece of Mark Twain's
vision:</p>
<p>Into the hall swaggered, his visage ribbed<lb>
From ear to ear with dog whip-weals, his nose<lb>
Bridge-broken, one eye out and one hand off,<lb>
And one with shattered fingers dangling, lame;<lb>
A churl, to whom indignantly the king,<lb>
"My churl, for whom Christ died; what evil beast<lb>
Hath drawn his claws athwart thy face? or fiend,<lb>
Man, was it who marr'd heaven's image in thee thus?"</p>

<p>The churl for whom Christ died is the centre of Mark Twain's
story, which is a long and a passionate attempt to suggest that the
evil beast who marred the visage of the poor wretch was the
three-headed chimera of Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Church. There
is much strange misreading of history caused by the extent to which
Mark Twain has allowed the abuses of institutions to obscure their
use.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smedes' <i>A Southern Planter</i> and Mark Twain's
new lapse into Ibsenity and the cultus of the thesis, <i>A Yankee at
the Court of King Arthur</i>, appear about the same time, and both
are pretty sure to be widely read in Britain: the latter because Mark
Twain is currently believed to have been once a writer of funny
books, and the former because the Sage of Hawarden has blessed it.
He is not always happy, is the Sage of Hawarden, in his selection of
books to dignify with his <i>imprimatur</i>, having a natural and
peculiar leaning to religious fiction; but in commending <i>A
Southern Planter</i> to British readers he has done well. Mrs.
Smedes' book and Mark Twain's have at first sight little enough in
common but their transatlantic origin; but that view is naught.
Nothing could be further removed from the blatant frivolity of the
Yankee exwag -- "our arch-humourist," as Mr. de Howells styles
him in the current <i>Harper</i>, not without a hint of unconscious
pathos -- than the record of a noble life which Mrs. Smedes has
written with such simple piety; and had Mr. Clemens been content
to write about the court of King Arthur as he wrote about Arkansas
and the Mexican Plug no one would have mentioned the two in the
same breath.</p>

<p>For in those days Mr. Clemens lived to make the light-hearted
laugh; and his life was a success. But he has exhausted his vein, and
with faded cap and fools' bells jangled has got bewrayed with
seriousness and bedevilled with a purpose. He treats you to a
"lecture" in dispraise of monarchical institutions and religious
establishments as the roots of all evil, and in praise of Yankee
'cuteness and Wall Street chicanery as compared to the simple
fidelity and devotion of the knightly ideal. The key to this precious
piece of apostolics is contained in a frontispiece where the Supreme
Yank, the Connecticut man in a state of heroism, the Bagman <i>in
excelsis</i>, is pictured in the act of tickling the nose of the British
Lion with a switch. Now the life of Thomas Dabney -- Virginian
aristocrat and slave-owner-- is an effective commentary on such
violent vulgarity. He was full of just those qualities which make the
memory of King Arthur fragrant. The mainspring of his life was not
the almighty dollar but <i>noblesse oblige</i>. Amid the prosperity
of his plantation times, as amid the havoc wrought on his and his
country's fortunes by the war, his supreme purpose was to fulfil the
honourable ideal of a gentleman. Such an ideal is no doubt
inconsistent with the democratic notions of the superior Yank; but
it is not the least precious heritage in the world's history for all that,
and Mr. Clemens stamps himself when he makes the bagman's
mistake of bedaubing it with cheap wit. It is the ideal which in
English literature animated Sir Roger de Coverley, and Mr.
Allworthy, and Colonel Newcome, of whose virtues, indeed, the life
of Thomas Dabney was in many ways a realisation. Mrs. Smedes
has done her part of the work very well, except that she might have
cut down the correspondences with advantage. As for Mark Twain,
he has turned didactic, and being ignorant is also misleading and
offensive. His method, which was that of Hamibel Chollop, consists
in attributing every social, political, and economic evil to the Crown
and the Church. That slavery and Protection have flourished under
American republican institutions does not hinder the ingenious
creature from attributing their existence to monarchy and what he
calls the Established Roman Catholic Church. To him that is
decorous and just. But then he is a bagman with a thesis, and his
notions of justice and decorum are of those that commend
themselves to none but renegade Europians -- Europians of the
stamp of Mr. Andrew Carnegie. To add to all this that Mr. W. de
Howells has taken occasion to contrast him and his achievement in
bagmanising with Cervantes and <i>Don Quixote</i>, somewhat to
the disadvantage of the latter, is to begin to pity the poor devil.
After all, he knows no better; after all, he is the parent of Huck Finn
and Jim the Nigger and the genuine Mexican Plug and the
incomparable Blue Jay.  What should he do where Arthur first in
court began whose  proper place is the Capitol, or Tammany Hall,
or the shadow of  the Saint Louis Bridge? What should he do with
a thesis? What  he really wants is a wooden nutmeg or a
razor-strop.</p>

<p>Mark Twain is also somewhat affected by the Spirit of his Time,
which is didactic; and by the Spirit of his Nation, which is inventive,
but not refined. Mr. Lewis Carroll is far beyond Mr. Clemens in points
of delicacy and taste; but it may be doubted whether any English
author of repute would have tried to win a laugh by an irreverant
treatment of the legend of the Holy Grail, as Mr. Clemens has done in
<i>A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur</i>. It is quite certain that
there are few English readers who will care to see the subject begrimed
with prime American jests. Mr. Clemens used to be able to make us
laugh without resorting to this easy and distressing method; in his last
book he fails to make us laugh by any method, even the worst.</p>

<p>But Mr. Clemens is not only dull when he is offensive; he is
perhaps even more dull when he is didactic. His views on the peerage,
religious tolerance, republics, political economy, and the application of
electricity to warfare, may be -- some of them are -- admirable. But
they are out of place in a farcical book: the satire is not fresh; the
information is second-hand or inaccurate; and the moral -- or immoral,
as the case may be -- is clumsily enforced and unduly prominent.
Tediousness is still further ensured by the length of the book. The joke
is a long joke, and the author has not "gompressed him." It would be
idle to point out that the book is not a sketch of the sixth century;
because Mr. Clemens is careful to remove by a prefatory note any such
objection. But he must not think that his confession of incompetence
will make him seem any the less incompetent to the intelligent
reader.</p>

<p>The illustrations to the book are occasionally allegorical, and
remind us of the hieroglyphic which is to be found at the beginning of
prophetic almanacks. In one of them the root of a tree is marked
Religious Intolerence; but the artist spells quite as well as he draws.
They are very badly arranged; they seldom occur at the right place;
and they break into text, making the task of reading very difficult. The
task was hard enough, too, without that. We hope -- we may even
believe --  that we have seen the artist at his worst; we certainly have
not seen the author at his best.</p>

<p>Sometimes we think that we shall never see the author at his best
again. American humour depended much upon quaint and happy
phrase. When these phrases are repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>, their
quaintness and happiness seem to disappear. But we have been
saddened and depressed by reading two long and humorous books,
and are, perhaps unduly inclined to be pessimistic. We had expected to
laugh a little; and, instead of that, we have learned much -- much that
we knew before. And, after all, it must be easy for Mr. Clemens to do
better; and we know why it must.</p>

<p>My dear Mr. Wyndham, -- It has occurred to a good many prophets
since Lord Lytton wrote <i>The Coming Race</i>, -- </p>

<p><font size=-1>To dip into the future, far as human eye could
see,<lb>
Show the vision of the world, and all the wonders that would
be.</font></p>

<p>but it was reserved, I think, for Mark Twain to put on Hans Andersen's
Goloshes of Happiness and go back to the past, carrying with him all the
wonders of the present. <i>A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur</i> is
a bizarre book, full of all kinds of laughable and delightful incongruities --
the most striking of its incongruities, however, being unconscious, grim,
and disenchanting. For Mark Twain, as he goes on, gets into a fury so
ferocious (and natural) with the infernal oppression of the people by the
Nobles, the King, and the Church that he passes in a sentence from
laughing into raving at the "good old times"; and, like Macbeth at sight of
Banquo's ghost, he "displaces the mirth" of the feast he had prepared for
us. His fooling is admirable and his preaching is admirable, but they are
mutually destructive. In every page he preaches pretty much what Richard
Rumbold preached two centuries since -- "I never could believe that
Providence had sent a few men into the world ready booted and spurred
to ride, and millions ready saddled and bridled to be ridden" -- but
Rumbold preached it from the most commanding of pulpits -- the scaffold
-- whereas Mark Twain preaches it from the sawdust of the circus and in
the intervals between a couple of jests or a couple of summersaults. But it
is thoroughly sound doctrine, and is needed still so sorely in England and
Ireland that it is ungracious to grumble at the mode of its delivery. It will
reach a larger audience, and, perhaps, strike many of them more by its
grotesque presentation than if  the preacher wore a less bizarre garb than
motley.</p>
<p><font size=-1>  Ridentem dicere verum<lb>
 Quid vetat? </font></p>

<p>Still, such frightful episodes as that of the woman who was burned to
make a fire to warm a slave gang, or that of the hanging of the young
mother -- wife of the "pressed" man-o'-war's man -- with her baby at her
breast (an incident, by the way, Mr. Mark Twain, not of the sixth century,
but of the beginning of the nineteenth), freeze the laughter on our lips.</p>
