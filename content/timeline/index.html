      <font size="+1">In 1885 Mark Twain designed and patented a
      game intended to help people keep historical facts straight.
      Curiously, his Memory Builder focused specifically on
      European royalty. This game is based only loosely on his
      (with some features borrowed from the <i>Carmen San Diego</i>
      series). Its focus is on MT and his times.</font>
    </p>

  <p>
      <font size="+1">The game is divided into four sections, each with eight
      questions: two sections on Sam Clemens' life and MT's career,
      and two on America between 1840 and 1910. There are plenty of
      facts and dates, and also a lot of pictures. As you play, you
      may also meet a few or a lot of MT's intimates and
      associates; they're here to help you find the dates you're
      looking for. Good luck!</font>
