            the summer of 1876, in his study at Quarry Farm
            (<i>shown here</i>). This was even before <i>Tom
            Sawyer</i> was published in America. He didn't finish
            it, however, until 1884. <i>Huck Finn</i> took him
            longer than any other book to write. "If I'd a knowed
            what a trouble it was to make a book," Huck says in the
            novel's last paragraph, "I wouldn't a tackled
            it."</font></p>
