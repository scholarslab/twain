<h3>Searching Mark Twain:</h3>
<h3>Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer, Puddn'head Wilson, and Conn. Yankee
</h3>
This search tool allows users to search all four works in this
database, or to limit a search to any single work.  The principal 
categories are:

<ul>
<li>All

<li>Huck Finn

<li>Puddn'head Wilson

<li>Tom Sawyer

<li>Connecticut Yankee

<li>Those Extraordinary Twins

<li>Innocents Abroad

</ul>

The results are returned first as a KWIC (keyword in context)
one-line display.  

<br>
The KWIC display leads to a larger context display for any result;
from here users can view the search result in the following contexts:

<ul>
<li>Section (usually a chapter)
<li>All (the entire work -- this may take a few seconds)
</ul>
One can also ask for the bibliographic record for the text.

<hr>

The <b>compound search</b> choice allows one to search for two 
words or phrases within some proximity to each other.  For example,
while a simple phrase search for <tt>slave child</tt> yields no
results, a compound search for 
<br><br>
<tt>slave</tt> near <tt>child</tt> within <tt>120</tt> characters
<br><br>
yields several results.  You could further limit this search to a
single work, rather than to all of them.
When in the "compound search", the works are identified by the followin
abbreviations:
