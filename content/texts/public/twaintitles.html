<h1>To Limit a Search to a Single Title</h1>

<p>To limit a search to a particular title, enter its name in the
"title" box: e.g., to search the 
<i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>, you could enter either the full
title -- <tt>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</tt> -- or some part of it
-- <tt>Huckleberry Finn</tt>.

</p>

<p>
Moreover, to limit a search to all texts that have a common element in
their title -- <i>Letters</i>, for example -- it is enough to limit
your search simply to <tt>Letters</tt>.
