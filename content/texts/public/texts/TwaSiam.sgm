</p>

<p>I do not wish to write of the personal <hi>habits</hi> of these strange
creatures solely, but also of certain curious details of various
kinds concerning them, which, belonging only to their private life, have
never crept into print. Knowing the Twins intimately, I feel that I am
peculiarly well qualified for the task I have taken upon myself.

</p><p>The Siamese Twins are naturally tender and affectionate in disposition, and
have clung to each other with singular fidelity throughout a long and
eventful life. Even as children they were inseparable companions; and it was
noticed that they always seemed to prefer each other's society to that of
any other persons. They nearly always played together; and, so accustomed
was their mother to this peculiarity, that, whenever both of them chance to
be lost, she usually only hunted for one of them--satisfied that when she
found that one she would find his brother somewhere in the immediate
neighborhood. And yet these creatures were ignorant and
unlettered--barbarians themselves and the offspring of barbarians, who knew
not the light of philosophy and science. What a withering rebuke is this to
our boasted civilization, with its quarrelings, its wrangling, and its
separations of brothers!

</p><p>As men, the Twins have not always lived in perfect accord; but, still, there
has always been a bond between them which made them unwilling to go away
from each other and dwell apart. They have even occupied the same house, as
a general thing, and it is believed that they have never failed to even
sleep together on any night since they were born. How surely do the habits
of a lifetime become second nature to us! The Twins always go to bed at the
same time; but Chang usually gets up about an hour before his brother. By an
understanding between themselves, Chang does all the in-door work and Eng
runs all the errands. This is because Eng likes to go out; Chang's habits
are sedentary. However, Chang always goes along. Eng is a Baptist, but Chang
is a Roman Catholic; still, to please his brother, Chang consented to be
baptized at the same time that Eng was, on condition that it should not
"count." During the War they were strong partisans, and both fought
gallantly all through the great struggle--Eng on the Union side and Chang on
the Confederate. They took each other prisoners at Seven Oaks, but the
proofs of capture were so evenly balanced in favor of each that a general
army court had to be assembled to determine which one was properly the
captor and which the captive. The jury was unable to agree for a long time;
but the vexed question was finally decided by agreeing to consider them both
prisoners, and then exchanging them. At one time Chang was convicted of
disobedience of orders, and sentenced to ten days in the guard house; but
Eng, in spite of all arguments, felt obliged to share his imprisonment,
notwithstanding he himself was entirely innocent; and so, to save the
blameless brother from suffering, they had to discharge both from
custody--the just reward of faithfulness.

</p><p>Upon one occasion the brothers fell out about something, and Chang knocked
Eng down, and then tripped and fell on him, whereupon both clinched and
began to beat and gouge each other without mercy. The bystanders interfered
and tried to separate them, but they could not do it, and so allowed them to
fight it out. In the end both were disabled, and were carried to the
hospital on one and the same shutter.

</p><p>Their ancient habit of going always together had its drawbacks when they
reached man's estate and entered upon the luxury of courting. Both fell in
love with the same girl. Each tried to steal clandestine interviews with
her, but at the critical moment the other would always turn up. By-and bye
Eng saw, with distraction, that Chang had won the girl's affections; and,
from that day forth, he had to bear with the agony of being a witness to all
their dainty billing and cooing. But, with a magnanimity that did him
infinite credit, he succumbed to his fate, and gave countenance and
encouragement to a state of things that bade fair to sunder his generous
heart-strings. He sat from seven every evening until two in the morning
listening to the fond foolishness of the two lovers, and to the concussion
of hundreds of squandered kisses--for the privilege of sharing only one of
which he would have given his right hand. But he sat patiently, and waited,
and gaped, and yawned, and stretched, and longed for two o'clock to come.
And he took long walks with the lovers on moonlight evenings--sometimes
traversing ten miles, notwithstanding he was usually suffering from
rheumatism. He is an inveterate smoker; but he could not smoke on these
occasions, because the young lady was painfully sensitive to the smell of
tobacco. Eng cordially wanted them married, and done with it; but, although
Chang often asked the momentous question, the young lady could not gather
sufficient courage to answer it while Eng was by. However, on one occasion,
after having walked some sixteen miles, and sat up till nearly daylight, Eng
dropped asleep, from sheer exhaustion, and then the question was asked and
answered. The lovers were married. All acquainted with the circumstances
applauded the noble brother-in-law. His unwavering faithfulness was the
theme of every tongue. He had staid by them all through their long and
arduous courtship; and when, at last, they were married, he lifted his hands
above their heads, and said with impressive unction, "Bless ye, my children,
I will never desert ye!" and he kept his word. Magnanimity like this is all
too rare in this cold world.

</p><p>By-and-bye Eng fell in love with his sister-in-law's sister, and married
her, and since that day they have all lived together, night and day, in an
exceeding sociability which is touching and beautiful to behold, and is a
scathing rebuke to our boasted civilization.

</p><p>The sympathy existing between these two brothers is so close and so
refined that the feelings, the impulses, the emotions of the one are
instantly experienced by the other. When one is sick, the other is sick;
when one feels pain, the other feels it; when one is angered, the other's
temper takes fire. We have already seen with what happy facility they both
fell in love with the same girl. Now, Chang is bitterly opposed to all forms
of intemperance, on principle; but Eng is the reverse--for, while these
men's feelings and emotions are so closely wedded, their reasoning faculties
are unfettered; their <hi>thoughts</hi> are free. Chang belongs to the Good Templars,
and is a hard-working and enthusiastic supporter of all temperance reforms.
But, to his bitter distress, every now and then Eng gets drunk, and, of
course, that makes Chang drunk too. This unfortunate thing has been a great
sorrow to Chang, for it almost destroys his usefulness in his favorite field
of effort. As sure as he is to head a great temperance procession Eng ranges
up alongside of him, prompt to the minute and drunk as a lord; but yet no
more dismally and hopelessly drunk than his brother who has not tasted a
drop. And so the two begin to hoot and yell, and throw mud and bricks at the
Good Templars; and, of course, they break up the procession. It would be
manifestly wrong to punish Chang for what Eng does, and, therefore, the Good
Templars accept the untoward situation, and suffer in silence and sorrow.
They have officially and deliberately examined into the matter, and find
Chang blameless. They have taken the two brothers and filled Chang full of
warm water and sugar and Eng full of whiskey, and in twenty-five minutes it
was not possible to tell which was the drunkest. Both were as drunk as
loons--and on hot whiskey punches, by the smell of their breath. Yet all the
while Chang's moral principles were unsullied, his conscience clear; and so
all just men were forced to confess that he was not morally, but only
physically drunk. By every right and by every moral evidence the man was
strictly sober; and, therefore, it caused his friends all the more anguish
to see him shake hands with the pump and try to wind his watch with his
night-key.

</p><p>There is a moral in these solemn warnings--or, at least, a warning in these
solemn morals; one or the other. No matter, it is somehow. Let us heed it;
let us profit by it.

</p><p>I could say more of an instructive nature about these interesting beings,
but let what I have written suffice.

</p><p>Having forgotten to mention it sooner, I will remark, in conclusion, that
the ages of the Siamese Twins are respectively fifty-one and fifty-three
years.
