<note>This toast was delivered at the Annual Dinner of the
New England Society of New York, at Delmonico's,
on 22 December 1882.  Twain added the signature
at the end of the manuscript, with the unusual
complete use of Langhorne, almost ten years after
giving this toast, presumably when he made
a present of the manuscript to someone.
</note>
<note>
On several pages (6-9, 13, 15-16) Twain has crossed out the original
page number at the top of the page, and added a corrected page number.
</note>
<note>
The first page of the manuscript contains pencilled annotations in
an unidentified hand -- apparently bookseller's markings.

<del type="overstrike"></del>The toast includes<lb>
the sex, universally: it is to Woman,<lb>

matter of dress.  This is a most<lb>

<add place="supralinear">intelligently</add> proceed to examine the profounder<lb>
depths of the theme.  For text, let<lb>
us take the dress of two antipodal<lb>
types    &mdash;    the savage woman of<lb>
<hi rend="triple underline">C</hi>entral Africa, &amp; the cultivated<lb>
daughter of our high modern<lb>
civilization. Among the<lb>
Fans, a great negro tribe, a woman,<lb>

at all but just her complexion.<lb>
That is all; that is her entire<lb>
outfit.  It is the lightest <orig reg="costume">cos-<lb>
tume</orig> in the world, but is made<lb>
of the darkest material.  It has<lb>
often been mistaken for mourning.<lb>
It is the trimmest, &amp; neatest, &amp; <orig reg="gracefulest">grace-<lb>
fulest</orig> costume that is now in<lb>
fashion; it wears well, is fast<lb>
colors, doesn't show dirt; you<lb>
don't have to send it down town<lb>
to wash, &amp; have some of it come<lb>
back scorched with the flat-iron, &amp;<lb>
some of it with the buttons ironed<lb>
off, &amp; some of it petrified with<lb>
starch, &amp; some of it chewed by the<lb>

perfection of a fit.  And it is the<lb>
handiest dress in the whole realm<lb>
of fashion.  It is always ready, <add place="supralinear">always "done up."</add><lb>
When you call on a Fan lady &amp;<lb>
send up your card, the hired<lb>
girl never says, "Please take<lb>
a seat, madam is dressing    &mdash;    <lb>
she will be down in three-quarters<lb>
of an hour."  No, madam is<lb>
always dressed, always ready<lb>

girl never has to say to a lady<lb>
visitor, "Please excuse madam,<lb>
she is undressing;" &amp; even if<lb>
she ever had to bring such an<lb>
excuse at all, she wouldn't say<lb>
it in that way: she would say,<lb>
"Please excuse madam, she's skins,<lb>
not herself!"</unclear></del>  Then again, the<lb>
Fan ladies don't go to church to<lb>
see what each other has got on;<lb>
&amp; they don't go back home &amp; describe<lb>
it &amp; slander it.  <del type="overstrike">The farthest they<lb>

   Such is the dark child of<lb>
savagery, as to every-day<lb>
toilette; &amp; <del type="overstrike"></del> thus, curiously<lb>
enough, she finds a point of<lb>
contact with the fair daughter<lb>
of civilization &amp; high fashion<lb>
   &mdash;    who has often has "nothing to wear;"<lb>
&amp; thus these widely separated types<lb>
of the sex meet upon common<lb>
ground.  Yes, such is the Fan<lb>
woman, as she appears in her<lb>
simple, unostentatious <orig reg="every-day">every-<lb>
day</orig> toilette.  But on state<lb>
occasions she is more dressy.<lb>
<del type="overstrike">much more dressy.</del>  At a<lb>
banquet she <del type="overstrike">wears</del> <add place="supralinear">wears</add> bracelets; at<lb>

&amp; with the true feminine fondness<lb>
for display, she wears them on her<lb>
arms; at a funeral she wears a<lb>
jacket of tar &amp; ashes; at a <orig reg="wedding">wed-<lb>

it puts on pantaloons.  Thus the<lb>
dark child of savagery &amp; the<lb>
fair daughter of civilization<lb>
meet once more upon <orig reg="common">com-<lb>
mon</orig> ground; &amp; these two<lb>
touches of nature make<lb>
their whole world kin.
</p>

<p>
     Now we will consider<lb>
the dress of our other type.  A<lb>
large part of the daughter of<lb>
civilization is her dress    &mdash;    as<lb>
it should be.  Some civilized<lb>

women would lose half their<lb>
charm without dress; &amp; some<lb>
would lose all of it.  The daughter<lb>
of modern civilization, dressed<lb>
at her utmost best, is a marvel<lb>
of exquisite &amp; beautiful art, &amp; <orig reg="expense">ex-<lb>
