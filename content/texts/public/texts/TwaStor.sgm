<p>
By all accounts, including his own, the speech MT gave at the dinner
for John Greenleaf Whittier was the most dramatic episode in his career on
the dais.  The date was 17 December 1877.  The scene, Boston's Hotel
Brunswick.  The specific occasion, a celebration of Whittier's 70th
birthday sponsored by <hi>The Atlantic Monthly</hi>.  The larger occasion,
as Henry Nash Smith points out, was a ceremonial tribute to the New
England man of letters, as epitomized by Whittier and Emerson, Longfellow
and Holmes (who were also at the banquet), as the guardian of American
cultural values.  In its account the next morning, the <hi>Boston Daily
Advertiser</hi> called the assemblage "without doubt the most notable that
has ever been seen in this country within four walls," and used names
like "Shakespeare" and words like "holy" to express the event's
significance (<xref doc="bostad77.html">see excerpt</xref>). The
<xref doc="whitnews.html">long account in the <hi>Boston Daily
Globe</hi></xref> ran as the lead article, and printed many of the
toasts and speeches, including MT's.
</p><p>
In his analysis of this event in <hi>Mark Twain: The Development of a
Writer</hi>, Smith provides an excellent account of both MT's motivation
for using his humor to deconstruct this cultural idol and middle-brow
American society's angry response to the speech.  On December 26, for
example, the <hi>Globe</hi> reprinted <xref doc="commcrit.html">an
attack from the <hi>Cincinnati Commercial</hi></xref> that accused MT
of lacking "the instincts of a gentleman."
</p><p>
Below is the speech as MT re-presented it in the volume <hi>Mark
Twain's Speeches</hi> (1910), where he followed it with his own "story"
of its delivery and reception.  His account, written almost 30 years
later, only begins to indicate what was going on between the lines of
the speech.  His account can't quite speak for itself.  It exaggerates,
for example, the effect MT's irreverence had on
the banquet; the scheduled speeches went on after he'd finished.  And it
doesn't mention the abject apology MT wrote a week afterwards to
Longfellow, Emerson and Holmes.  But the account is certainly a good guide
to MT's emotional investment in the performance.  (The best guide to the
dynamics of his culture's response is Smith's chapter.)  The one thing
I've added, here, to MT's account are pictures of Longfellow, Emerson
and Holmes -- as MT's audience at the time would have seen them.

The Story of a Speech
</head>
<p>
<hi>An address delivered in 1877, and a review of it twenty-nine years
later. The original speech was delivered at a dinner given by the
publishers of</hi> The Atlantic Monthly <hi>in honor of the seventieth
anniversary of the birth of John Greenleaf Whittier, at the Hotel
Brunswick, Boston, December 17, 1877.</hi>
</p><p>
THIS is an occasion peculiarly meet for the
digging up of pleasant reminiscences concerning literary folk; therefore I
will drop lightly into history myself. Standing here on the shore of the
Atlantic and contemplating certain of its largest literary billows, I am
reminded of a thing which happened to me thirteen years ago, when I had
just succeeded in stirring up a little Nevadian literary puddle myself,
whose spume-flakes were beginning to blow thinly Californiaward. I started
an inspection tramp through the southern mines of California. I was callow
and conceited, and I resolved to try the virtue of my nom de guerre.
</p><p>
I very soon had an opportunity. I knocked at a miner's lonely log cabin
in the foot-hills of the Sierras just at nightfall. It was snowing at the
time. A jaded, melancholy man of fifty, barefooted, opened the door to me.
When he heard my nom de guerre he looked more dejected than before. He let
me in -- pretty reluctantly, I thought -- and after the customary bacon
and beans, black coffee and hot whiskey, I took a pipe.  This sorrowful
man had not said three words up to this time. Now he spoke up and said, in
the voice of one who is secretly suffering, "You're the fourth -- I'm
going to move." "The fourth what?" said I. "The fourth littery man that
has been here in twenty-four hours -- I'm going to move." "You don't tell
me!" said I; "who were the others?" "Mr. Longfellow, Mr. Emerson, and Mr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes -- consound the lot!"
</p><p>

</p><p>
You can easily believe I was interested. I supplicated -- three hot
whiskeys did the rest -- and finally the melancholy miner began. Said he:
"They came here just at dark yesterday evening, and I let them in of
course. Said they were going to the Yosemite. They were a rough lot, but
that's nothing; everybody looks rough that travels afoot. Mr. Emerson was
a seedy little bit of a chap, red-headed. Mr. Holmes was as fat as a
balloon; he weighed as much as three hundred, and had double chins all the
way down to his stomach. Mr. Longfellow was built like a prize-fighter.
His head was cropped and bristly, like as if he had a wig made of
hair-brushes. His nose lay straight down his face, like a finger with the
end joint tilted up. They had been drinking, I could see that.  And what
queer talk they used!  Mr. Holmes inspected this cabin, then he took me by
the buttonhole, and says he:
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>"'Through the deep caves of thought</l>
<l>I hear a voice that sings,</l>
<l>Build thee more stately mansions,</l>
<l>O my soul!'</l>
</lg>
<p>
"Says I, 'I can't afford it, Mr. Holmes, and moreover I don't want to.'
Blamed if I liked it pretty well, either, coming from a stranger, that
way. However, I started to get out my bacon and beans, when Mr. Emerson
came and looked on awhile, and then he takes me aside by the buttonhole
and says:
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>"'Give me agates for my meat;</l>
<l>Give me cantharids to eat;</l>
<l>From air and ocean bring me foods,</l>
<l>From all zones and altitudes.'</l>
</lg>
<p>
"Says I, 'Mr. Emerson, if you'll excuse me, this ain't no hotel.' You
see it sort of riled me -- I warn't used to the ways of littery swells.
But I went on a-sweating over my work, and next comes Mr. Longfellow and
buttonholes me, and interrupts me. Says he:
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>"'Honor be to Mudjekeewis!</l>
<l>You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis--'</l>
</lg>
<p>
"But I broke in, and says I, 'Beg your pardon, Mr. Longfellow, if
you'll be so kind as to hold your yawp for about five minutes and let me
get this grub ready, you'll do me proud.' Well, sir, after they'd filled
up I set out the jug. Mr. Holmes looks at it, and then he fires up all of
a sudden and yells:
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>"'Flash out a stream of blood-red wine!</l>
<l>For I would drink to other days.'</l>
</lg>
<p>
"By George, I was getting kind of worked up.  I don't deny it, I was
getting kind of worked up.  I turns to Mr. Holmes, and says I, 'Looky
here, my fat friend, I'm a-running this shanty, and if the court knows
herself, you'll take whiskey straight or you'll go dry.' Them's the very
words I said to him. Now I don't want to sass such famous littery people,
but you see they kind of forced me.  There ain't nothing onreasonable
'bout me; I don't mind a passer of guests a-treadin' on my tail three or
four times, but when it comes to standing on it it's different, 'and if
the court knows herself,' I says, 'you'll take whiskey straight or you'll
go dry.' Well, between drinks they'd swell around the cabin and strike
attitudes and spout; and pretty soon they got out a greasy old deck and
went to playing euchre at ten cents a corner -- on trust.  I began to
notice some pretty suspicious things.  Mr. Emerson dealt, looked at his
hand, shook his head, says:
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>"'I am the doubter and the doubt --'</l>
</lg>
<p>
and ca'mly bunched the hands and went to shuffling for a new layout.
Says he:
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>"'They reckon ill who leave me out;</l>
<l>They know now well the subtle ways I keep.</l>
<l>I pass and deal <hi>again!</hi>'</l>
</lg>
<p>
<figure entity="TwaStor3">

</p>
<p>
Hang'd if he didn't go ahead and do it, too!  Oh, he was a cool one! Well, in a minute things were running pretty tight, but all of a sudden I
see by Mr. Emerson's eye he judged he had 'em. He had already corralled
two tricks, and each of the others one.  So now he kind of lifts a little
in his chair and says:
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>"'I tire of globes and aces! --</l>
<l>Too long the game is played!'</l>
</lg>
<p>
-- and down he fetched a right bower.  Mr. Longfellow smiles as sweet
as pie and says:
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>"'Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,</l>
<l>For the lesson thou has taught,'</l>
</lg>
<p>
-- and blamed if he didn't down with <hi>another</hi> right bower!
Emerson claps his hand on his bowie, Longfellow claps his on his revolver,
and I went under a bunk. There was going to be trouble; but that monstrous
Holmes rose up, wobbling his double chins, and says he, 'Order, gentlemen;
the first man that draws, I'll lay down on him and smother him!' All quiet
on the Potomac, you bet!

"They were pretty how-come-you-so by now, and they begun to blow.
Emerson says, 'The nobbiest thing I ever wrote was " Barbara Frietchie."'
Says Longfellow, 'It don't begin with my "Biglow Papers."' Says Holmes,
'My "Thanatopsis" lays over 'em both.' They mighty near ended in a fight.
Then they wished they had some more company -- and Mr. Emerson pointed to
me and says:
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>"'Is yonder squalid peasant all</l>
<l>That this proud nursery could breed?'</l>
</lg>
<p>
He was a-whetting his bowie on his boot -- so I let it pass. Well, sir,
next they took it into their heads that they would like some music; so
they made me stand up and sing "When Johnny Comes Marching Home" till I
dropped -- at thirteen minutes past four this morning. That's what I've
been through, my friend. When I woke at seven, they were leaving, thank
goodness, and Mr.  Longfellow had my only boots on, and his'n under his
arm. Says I, 'Hold on, there, Evangeline, what are you going to do with
them?' He says, 'Going to make tracks with 'em; because:
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>"'Lives of great men all remind us</l>
<l>We can make our lives sublime;</l>
<l>And, departing, leave behind us</l>
<l>Footprints on the sands of time.'</l>
</lg>
<p>
As I said, Mr. Twain, you are the fourth in twenty-four hours -- and
I'm going to move; I ain't suited to a littery atmosphere."
</p><p>
I said to the miner, "Why, my dear sir, these were not the gracious
singers to whom we and the world pay loving reverence alla homage; these
were impostors."
</p><p>
The miner investigated me with a calm eye for a while; then said he,
"Ah! impostors, were they?  Are <hi>you?</hi>
</p><p>
I did not pursue the subject, and since then I have not travelled on my
nom de guerre enough to hurt. Such was the reminiscence I was moved to
contribute, Mr. Chairman. In my enthusiasm I may have exaggerated the
details a little, but you will easily forgive me that fault, since I
believe it is the first time I have ever deflected from perpendicular fact
on an occasion like this.

<hi>From Mark Twain's Autobiography.</hi><lb>
<hi>January</hi> 11, 1906.<lb>
Answer to a letter received this morning:
</head>
<p>
DEAR MRS. H., -- I am forever
your debtor for reminding me of that curious passage in my life. During
the first year or two after it happened, I could not bear to think of it.
My pain and shame were so intense, and my sense of having been an imbecile
so settled, established and confirmed, that I drove the episode entirely
from my mind -- and so all these twenty-eight or twenty-nine years I have
lived in the conviction that my performance of that time was coarse,
vulgar, and destitute of humor. But your suggestion that you and your
family found humor in it twenty-eight years ago moved me to look into the
matter.  So I commissioned a Boston typewriter to delve among the Boston
papers of that bygone time and send me a copy of it.  It came this
morning, and if there is any vulgarity about it I am not able to discover
it. If it isn't innocently and ridiculously funny, I am no judge. I will
see to it that you get a copy.
</p><p>
What I have said to Mrs. H. is true. I did suffer during a year or two
from the deep humiliations of that episode. But at last, in 1888, in
Venice, my wife and I came across Mr. and Mrs. A. P. C., of Concord,
Massachusetts, and a friendship began then of the sort which nothing but
death terminates. The C's were very bright people and in every way
charming and companionable. We were together a month or two in Venice and
several months in Rome, afterward, and one day that lamented break of mine
was mentioned. And when I was on the point of lathering those people for
bringing it to my mind when I had gotten the memory of it almost
squelched, I perceived with joy that the C's were indignant about the way
that my performance had been received in Boston. They poured out their
opinions most freely and frankly about the frosty attitude of the people
who were present at that performance, and about the Boston newspapers for
the position they had taken in regard to the matter. That position was
that I had been irreverent beyond belief, beyond imagination. Very well; I
had accepted that as a fact for a year or two, and had been thoroughly
miserable about it whenever I thought of it -- which was not frequently,
if I could help it. Whenever I thought of it I wondered how I ever could
have been inspired to do so unholy a thing. Well, the C's comforted me,
but they did not persuade me to continue to think about the unhappy
episode.  I resisted that. I tried to get it out of my mind, and let it
die, and I succeeded. Until Mrs. H.'s letter came, it had been a good
twenty-five years since I had thought of that matter; and when she said
that the thing was funny I wondered if possibly she might be right. At any
rate, my curiosity was aroused, and I wrote to Boston and got the whole
thing copied, as above set forth.  I vaguely remember some of the details
of that gathering -- dimly I can see a hundred people -- no, perhaps fifty
-- shadowy figures sitting at tables feeding, ghosts now to me, and
nameless forevermore. I don't know who they were, but I can very
distinctly see, seated at the grand table and facing the rest of us, Mr.
Emerson, supernaturally grave, unsmiling; Mr. Whittier, grave, lovely, hls
beautiful spirit shining out of hls face; Mr.  Longfellow, with his silken
white hair and his benignant face; Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, flashing
smiles and affection and all good-fellowship everywhere like a
rose-diamond whose facets are being turned toward the light first one way
and then another -- a charming man, and always fascinating, whether he was
talklng or whether he was sittlng still (what <hi>he</hi> would call still,
but what would be more or less motion to other people). I can see those
figures wlth entire distinctness across this abyss of time.
</p><p>
One other feature is clear -- Willie Winter (for these past thousand
years dramatic editor of the <hi>New York Tribune</hi>, and still occupying
that high post in his old age) was there. He was much younger then than he
is now, and he showed it.  It was always a pleasure to me to see Willie
Winter at a banquet. During a matter of twenty years I was seldom at a
banquet where Willie Winter was not also present, and where he did not
read a charming poem written for the occasion. He did it this time, and it
was up to standard: dainty, happy, choicely phrased, and as good to listen
to as music, and sounding exactly as if it was pouring unprepared out of
heart and brain.
</p><p>
Now at that point ends all that was pleasurable about that notable
celebration of Mr.  Whittier's seventieth birthday -- because <hi>I</hi> got
up at that point and followed Winter, with what I have no doubt I supposed
would be the gem of the evening -- the gay oration above quoted from the
Boston paper. I had written it all out the day before and had perfectly
memorized it, and I stood up there at my genial and happy and
self-satisfied ease, and began to deliver it.  Those majestic guests, that
row of venerable and still active volcanoes, listened, as did everybody
else in the house, with attentive interest. Well, I delivered myself of --
we'll say the first two hundred words of my speech. I was expecting no
returns from that part of the speech, but this was not the case as
regarded the rest of it. I arrived now at the dialogue: "The old miner
said, 'You are the fourth, I'm going to move.' 'The fourth what?' said I.
He answered, 'The fourth littery man that has been here in twenty-four
hours. I am going to move.' 'Why, you don't tell me,' said I. 'Who were
the others ?' 'Mr. Longfellow, Mr. Emerson, Mr. Oliver Wendell Holmes,
consound the lot --'"
</p><p>
Now, then, the house's <hi>attention</hi> continued, but the expression
of interest in the faces turned to a sort of black frost. I wondered what
the trouble was. I didn't know. I went on, but with difficulty -- I
struggled along, and entered upon that miner's fearful description of the
bogus Emerson, the bogus Holmes, tbe bogus Longfellow, always
hoping -- but with a gradually perishing hope -- that somebody would laugh,
or that somebody would at least smile, but nobody did. I didn't know enough to
give it up and sit down, I was too new to public speaking, and so I went
on with this awful performance, and carried it clear through to the end,
in front of a body of people who seemed turned to stone with horror. It
was the sort of expression their faces would have worn if I had been
making these remarks about the Deity and the rest of the Trinity; there is
no milder way in which to describe the petrified condition and the ghastly
expression of those people.  When I sat down it was with a heart which had
long ceased to beat. I shall never be as dead again as I was then. I shall
never be as miserable again as I was then. I speak now as one who doesn't
know what the condition of things may be in the next world, but in this
one I shall never be as wretched again as I was then.  Howells, who was
near me, tried to say a comforting word, but couldn't get beyond a gasp.
There was no use -- he understood the whole size of the disaster. He had
good intentions, but the words froze before they could get out. It was an
atmosphere that would freeze anything. If Benvenuto Cellini's salamander
had been in that place he would not have survived to be put into Cellini's
autobiography. There was a frightful pause. There was an awful silence,
a desolating silence. Then the next man on the list had to get
up -- there was no help for it. That was Bishop -- Bishop had
just burst handsomely upon the world with a most acceptable
novel, which had appeared in The Atlantic Monthly, a place which would
make any novel respectable and any author noteworthy. In this case the
novel itself was recognized as being, without extraneous help,
respectable. Bishop was away up in the public favor, and he was an object
of high interest, consequently there was a sort of national expectancy in
the air; we may say our American millions were standing, from Maine to
Texas and from Alaska to Florida, holding their breath, their lips parted,
their hands ready to applaud, when Bishop should get up on that occasion,
and for the first time in his life speak in public. It was under these
damaging conditions that he got up to "make good," as the vulgar say. I
had spoken several times before, and that is the reason why I was able to
go on without dying in my tracks, as I ought to have done -- but Bishop
had had no experience. He was up facing those awful deities
 -- facing those other people, those strangers -- facing human beings for
the first time in his life, with a speech to utter. No doubt it was well
packed away in his memory, no doubt it was fresh and usable, until I had
been heard from.  I suppose that after that, and under the smothering pall
of that dreary silence, it began to waste away and disappear out of his
head like the rags breaking from the edge of a fog, and presently there
wasn't any fog left. He didn't go on -- he didn't last long. It was not
many sentences after his first before he began to hesitate, and break, and
lose his grip, and totter, and wobble, and at last he slumped down in a
limp and mushy pile.
</p><p>
Well, the programme for the occasion was probably not more than
one-third finished, but it ended there. Nobody rose. The next man hadn't
strength enough to get up, and everybody looked so dazed, so stupefied,
paralyzed, it was impossible for anybody to do anything, or even try.
Nothing could go on in that strange atmosphere. Howells mournfully, and
without words, hitched himself to Bishop and me and supported us out of
the room. It was very kind -- he was most generous. He towed us tottering
away into some room in that building, and we sat down there. I don't know
what my remark was now, but I know the nature of it. It was the kind of
remark you make when you know that nothing in the world can help your
case. But Howells was honest -- he had to say the heart-breaking things he
did say: that there was no help for this calamity, this shipwreck, this
cataclysm, that this was the most disastrous thing that had ever happened
in anybody's history -- and then he added, "That is, for you -- and
consider what you have done for Bishop. It is bad enough in your case, you
deserve to suffer. You have committed this crime, and you deserve to have
all you are going to get. But here is an innocent man. Bishop had never
done you any harm, and see what you have done to him. He can never hold
his head up again. The world can never look upon Bishop as being a live
person. He is a corpse."
</p><p>
That is the history of that episode of twenty-eight years ago, which
pretty nearly killed me with shame during that first year or two whenever
it forced its way into my mind.
</p><p>
Now then, I take that speech up and examine it. As I said, it arrived
this morning, from Boston. I have read it twice, and unless I am an idiot,
it hasn't a single defect in it from the first word to the last. It is
just as good as good can be. It is smart; it is saturated with humor.
There isn't a suggestion of coarseness or vulgarity in it anywhere. What
could have been the matter with that house? It is amazing, it is
incredible, that they didn't shout with laughter, and those deities the
loudest of them all. Could the fault have been with me ? Did I lose
courage when I saw those great men up there whom I was going to describe
in such a strange fashion? If that happened, if I showed doubt, that can
account for it, for you can't be successfully funny if you show that you
are afraid of it. Well, I can't account for it, but if I had those beloved
and revered old literary immortals back here now on the platform at
Carnegie Hall I would take that same old speech, deliver it, word for
word, and melt them till they'd run all over that stage. Oh, the fault
must have been with me, it is not in the speech at all.

<note n="1"><p>As Smith points out, not even this is the end of the story.  A few days
after dictating the above account, MT told Twichell that, "I have examined
that speech a couple of times since, and have changed my notion about it
-- changed it entirely.  I find it gross, coarse -- well, I needn't go
on with particulars.  I didn't like any part of it . . . I found it
always offensive and detestable. . . . I expect this latest version to
remain."</p><p>Nor is that his last word.  In 1906 he added a footnote to this
passage, as typed for the manuscript of his autobiography, to say about
"this latest version": "It did remain -- until the day before yesterday;
then I gave it a final and vigorous reading -- <hi>aloud</hi> -- and
dropped straight back to my former admiration of
cd it. M.T." [Look at Mother Eve!] You need not look at her unless you want
to, but Eve was ornamental, sir -- particularly before the fashions
changed!</p></note></div1>
