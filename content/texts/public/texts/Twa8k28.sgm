<note>Images of the manuscript have been included.  
</note>   
<note>The bottom of the last page of the letter is torn, leaving a gap 
at the beginning of the last sentence.  We are assuming that the word 
"I" appears in the gap. 
</note>  
<note>The electronic text contains a transcription of the letterhead and 
the preprinted segments of the dateline, as well as of Twain's 
manuscript which fills in the date and annotates the letter as 
"Private."  In the list of the names at the head of the 
document, the third name, Wm. A.  Ma(?)terstock, was difficult to 
decipher.  We have transcribed it as "Mauterstock," with a fair degree 
of certainty. 
</note>   
<note>An unidentified hand has written "158" in the upper right corner 
of the first manuscript page of the letter.  This annotation has not been  
transcribed.
