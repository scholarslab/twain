<head>To Woman: An Irregular Toast</head>

<p>This toast, delivered 11 January 1868 to a banquet room full of
journalists, was one of MT's first great public successes in the east.
Below is the text, as published in the paper the next day
and widely reprinted across the country in the following weeks,
preceded by part of the story of MT's own mixed feelings about the
address.</p>
</div1>

<pb>
<div1 type="context">
<head>BEHIND THE SCENES</head>

<p>The <hi>Star</hi>'s transcript is a good one, but the paper left out
two of MT's most risque jokes -- their places are marked in the text at
left with asterisks, and can be accessed by clicking on the (*).  MT was
initially delighted with both his live performance and the subsequent
publicity:  he sent copies of this article to <hi>his</hi> "own mother!"
and to the <hi>Alta California</hi>.  Soon, however, he became anxious
about how well the performance would play with the genteel audiences he
was trying to adapt his persona to.  That audience was, at this point,
epitomized by Mrs. Mary Fairbanks, the slightly older wife of a
Cleveland publisher whom MT met on the<hi> Quaker City</hi> tour and was
soon calling "Mother."  To her he wrote on January 24:
</p>
<q><p>Dear Mother -- Don't abuse me on account of that dinner-speech in
reply to the toast to Woman, if you should see it floating around in the
papers. -- It had slang in it, but they had no business to report it so
<hi>verbatimly</hi>. . . . I am not going to make any more slang speeches
in public.  You will forgive me, now, won't you?
</p></q>

<p><hi>Apparently Mrs. Fairbanks did see the speech, and did abuse him
for it.  On January 30 he wrote:</hi>
</p>

<q><p>P.S. -- I confess, humbly, that I deserve all you have said, &amp;
promise that I will rigidly eschew slang &amp; vulgarity in future, even in
foolish dinner speeches, when on my guard.
</p></q>

<p>Although the record of the performance seems lost, within a month
MT seems to addressed himself again "To Woman."  This time, he felt, his
speech was one "Mother" Fairbanks would be pleased with, as he told her
in a letter dated February 20:

</p>

<q><p>I acknowledge -- I acknowledge -- that I <hi>can</hi> be most
laceratingly "funny without being vulgar."  In proof whereof I responded
again to the regular toast to Woman at a grand banquet night before
last, &amp; was frigidly proper in language &amp; sentiment. . . . <hi>Now</hi>
haven't I vindicated myself &amp; shed honor upon my teacher &amp; done credit
to her teachings?  With head uncovered, &amp; in attitude suppliant but yet
expressive of conscious merit, I stand before you in spirit &amp; wait my
earned "Well done," &amp; augmented emolument of bread &amp; butter -- to the
end that I may go &amp; slide on the cellar door &amp; be happy.
</p></q>

<p>MT knew that people laugh when they are uncomfortable, so he was
always working right at the line between teasing or provoking his
audience and shocking or offending them.  Except for a few very private
performances (<hi>1602 </hi>and <hi>"Some Remarks on the Science of
Onanism"</hi>) MT made little use of sexual humor -- less, probably, than
even his repressive culture would have allowed him, and amazingly little
by the standards of modern comedy.  It does not seem that many people
besides Mrs. Fairbanks would have objected to this 1868 toast, at least
as reprinted in the<hi> Star </hi>.  Apparently his own mother, from a
less refined realm than Mary Fairbanks, enjoyed it. On the other hand,
MT's speech at the Whittier Birthday Dinner set off a number of critics.
It treated with slang and irreverence another of Victorian America's
sacred icons -- not woman, but the gentleman man-of-letters.

<head>The Washington <hi>Star</hi><lb>
13 January 1868<lb>
<lb>Mark Twain's Eulogy of the Fair Sex.</head>

<p>The Washington Correspondents' Club held its anniversary on Saturday
night.  Mr. Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, responded to the toast
"Woman, the pride of the professions and the jewel of ours."  He
said: </p>
<p>MR. PRESIDENT: I do not know why I should have been singled out to
receive the greatest distinction of the evening -- for so the office of
replying to the toast to woman has been regarded in every age.
[Applause.] I do not know why I have received this distinction, unless
it be that I am a trifle less homely than the other members of the Club.
But, be this as I may, Mr. President, I am proud of the position, and
you could not have chosen anyone who would have accepted it more gladly,
or labored with a heartier good will to do the subject justice, than I.
Because, sir, I love the sex. [Laughter.] I love <hi>all</hi> the women,
sir, irrespective of age or color. [Laughter.]
</p><p>Human intelligence cannot estimate what we owe to woman, sir.
She sews our buttons [laughter], she mends our clothes [laughter], she
ropes us in at the church fairs -- she confides in us; she tells us
whatever she can find out about the little private affairs of the
neighbors -- she gives us good advice, and plenty of it -- she gives us
a piece of her mind, sometimes -- and sometimes all of it -- she soothes
our aching brows -- she bears our children
<xref doc="woman68c.html">(*)</xref>.  In all the relations of life, sir, it
is but just, and a graceful tribute to woman to say of her that she is a
brick.  [Great laughter.]
</p><p>Wheresoever you place woman, sir -- in whatever position or estate --
she is an ornament to that place she occupies, and a treasure to the
world. [Here Mr. Twain paused, looked inquiringly at his hearers and
remarked that the applause should come in at this point.  It came in.
Mr. Twain resumed his eulogy.] Look at the noble names of history!  Look
at Cleopatra! look at Desdemona! look at Florence Nightengale! look at
Joan of Arc! look at Lucretia Borgia!  [Disapprobriation expressed.
"Well," said Mr. Twain, scratching his head doubtfully, "suppose we let
Lucretia slide."] Look at Joyce Heth! look at Mother Eve!
<xref doc="woman68b.html">(*)</xref> I repeat, sir, look at
the illustrious names of history!  Look at the Widow Machree!  Look at
Lucy Stone!  Look at Elizabeth Cady Stanton!  Look at George Francis
Train! [Great laughter.] And, sir, I say with bowed head and deepest
veneration, look at the mother of Washington!  She raised a boy that
could not lie -- <hi>could not lie</hi>. [Applause.] But he <hi>never had
any chance</hi>.  It might have been different with him if he had
belonged to a newspaper correspondent's club. [Laughter, groans, hisses,
cries of "put him out."  Mark looked around placidly upon his excited
audience and resumed.]
</p><p>I repeat, sir, that in whatever position you place a woman she is an
ornament to society and a treasure to the world.  As a sweetheart she
has few equals and no superiors -- [laughter;] -- as a cousin she is
convenient; as a wealthy grandmother with an incurable distemper, she is
precious; as a wet nurse she has no equal among men! [Laughter.]

</p><p>What, sir, would the people of this earth be, without woman?  They
would be scarce, sir.  Then let us cherish her -- let us protect her --
let us give her our support, our encouragement, our sympathies --
ourselves, if we get the chance. [Laughter.]

</p><p>But, jesting aside, Mr. President, woman is lovable, gracious, kind
of heart, beautiful -- worthy of all respect, of all esteem, of all
deference.  Not any here will refuse to drink her health right
cordially, for each and every one of us has personally known, and loved,
and honored, the very best one of them all -- his own mother!
[Applause.]
