<p>MT jumped into national prominence on the basis of this tale about 
Jim Smiley and his frog, first published in a New York newspaper in 
November 1865 and quickly reprinted around the country.  Though MT 
later discounted it as a "villainous backwoods sketch," it already 
adumbrates motifs that would stick with him throughout his career -- 
including the use of a vernacular speaker and the unexplained appearance 
of a mysterious stranger.  MT also kept returning to the tale itself, 
often giving a shortened version of it in his lectures and readings -- 
including the tour with Cable he arranged to promote <hi>Huck Finn</hi>. 
I include it among the sources of <hi>Huck Finn</hi>, though, essentially 
for the way it shows MT developing the possibilities of a deadpan 
 narrator.  Like Simon Wheeler, Huck tells a tale that is designed to 
make readers laugh without, as MT puts it below, "without ever smiling." 
From early on in his career, MT believed that when a humorist gave no 
sign that he understood the meaning of the story he was telling it made 
the audience that much more likely to laugh.  Of course, in <hi>Huck 
Finn</hi> the narrative "innocence" of the storyteller is being put to 
much more profound thematic uses. 
 
</p><p>MT revised his most famous sketch several times, in modest ways.  The 
text below is the 1865 version, which was titled "Jim Smiley and His 
Jumping Frog."  The cover at left is from the first (1867) British 
publication of the sketch.  This rare edition is one of the most recent 
additions to the Barrett Collection.

<q><p>Mr. A. Ward,<lb> 
</p><p>Dear Sir: -- Well, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon 
Wheeler, and inquired after your friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as you 
requested me to do, and I hereunto append the result. If you can get 
any information out of it you are cordially welcome to it.  I have a 
lurking suspicion that your Leonidas W. Smiley is a myth -- that you 
never knew such a personage, and that you only conjectured that if I 
asked old Wheeler about him it would remind him of his infamous 
<hi>Jim</hi> Smiley, and he would go to work and bore me nearly to 
death with some infernal reminiscence of him as long and tedious as 
it should be useless to me. If that was your design, Mr. Ward, it 
will gratify you to know that it succeeded.   
</p></q> 
 
<p>I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room stove of 
the old, dilapidated tavern in the ancient mining camp of Boomerang, 
and I noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had an expression 
of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. 
He roused up and gave me good-day. I told him a friend of mine had 
commissioned me to make some inquiries about a cherished companion 
of his boyhood named Leonidas W. Smiley -- Rev. Leonidas W.  Smiley 
-- a young minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time 
a resident of this village of Boomerang. I added that if Mr. Wheeler 
could tell me any thing about this Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, I would 
feel under many obligations to him. 
 
</p><p>Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with 
his chair -- and then sat me down and reeled off the monotonous 
narrative which follows this paragraph. He never smiled, he never 
frowned, he never changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key to 
which he tuned the initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest 
suspicion of enthusiasm -- but all through the interminable 
narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and sincerity, 
which showed me plainly that, so far from his imagining that there 
was any thing ridiculous or funny about his story, he regarded it as 
a really important matter, and admired its two heroes as men of 
transcendent genius in finesse.  To me, the spectacle of a man 
drifting serenely along through such a queer yarn without ever 
smiling was exquisitely absurd. As I said before, I asked him to 
tell me what he knew of Rev. Leonidas W.  Smiley, and he replied as 
follows. I let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him 
once:   
 
</p><p>There was a feller here once by the name of <hi>Jim</hi> Smiley, in 
the winter of '49 -- or maybe it was the spring of '50 -- I don't 
recollect exactly, somehow, though what makes me think it was one or 
the other is because I remember the big flume wasn't finished when 
he first came to the camp; but any way, he was the curiosest man 
about always betting on any thing that turned up you ever see, if he 
could get any body to bet on the other side, and if he couldn't he'd 
change sides -- any way that suited the other man would suit 
<hi>him</hi> -- any way just so's he got a bet, <hi>he</hi> was 
satisfied. But still, he was lucky -- uncommon lucky; he most always 
come out winner. He was always ready and laying for a chance; there 
couldn't be no solitry thing mentioned but that feller'd offer to 
bet on it -- and take any side you please, as I was just telling 
you. If there was a horse-race, you'd find him flush, or you'd find 
him busted at the end of it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on 
it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a 
chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting 
on a fence, he would bet you which one would fly first -- or if 
there was a camp-meeting, he would be there reglar, to bet on Parson 
Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and so 
he was, too, and a good man. If he even seen a straddle-bug start to 
go any wheres, he would bet you how long it would take him to get 
wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he would foller 
that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was 
bound for and how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has 
seen that Smiley, and can tell you about him. Why, it never made no 
difference to <hi>him</hi> -- he would bet on <hi>anything</hi> -- the 
dangdest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick, once, for a 
good while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but 
one morning he come in, and Smiley asked him how she was, and he 
said she was considerable better -- thank the Lord for his inf'nit 
mercy -- and coming on so smart that, with the blessing of 
Providence, she'd get well yet -- and Smiley, before he thought, 
says, "Well, I'll resk two-and-a-half that she don't, anyway."   
 
</p><p>Thish-yer Smiley had a mare -- the boys called her the 
fifteen-minute nag, but that was only in fun, you know, because, of 
course, she was faster than that -- and he used to win money on that 
horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or the 
distemper, or the consumption, or something of that kind. They used 
to give her two or three hundred yards' start, and then pass her 
under way; but always at the fag-end of the race she'd get excited 
and desperate-like, and come cavorting and straddling up, and 
scattering her legs around limber, sometimes in the air, and 
sometimes out to one side amongst the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e 
dust, and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and 
blowing her nose -- and always fetch up at the stand just about a 
neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down.   
 
</p><p>And he had a little small bull pup, that to look at him you'd 
think he warn't worth a cent, but to set around and look ornery, and 
lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon as money was up on 
him, he was a different dog -- his underjaw'd begin to stick out 
like the fo'castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover, and 
shine savage like the furnaces. And a dog might tackle him, and 
bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him over his shoulder two or 
three times, and Andrew Jackson -- which was the name of the pup -- 
Andrew Jackson would never let on but what he was satisfied, and 
hadn't expected nothing else -- and the bets being doubled and 
doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up -- 
and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the 
j'int of his hind leg and freeze to it -- not chaw, you understand, 
but only jest grip and hang on till they thronged up the sponge, if 
it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he 
harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd 
been sawed off in a circular saw, and when the thing had gone along 
far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to make a snatch 
for his pet holt, he saw in a minute how he'd been imposed on, and 
how the other dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared 
surprised, and then he looked sorter discouraged-like, and didn't 
try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad.  He 
give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it 
was <hi>his</hi> fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs 
for him to take holt of, which was his main dependence in a fight, 
and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It was a good 
pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself 
if he'd lived, for the stuff was in him, and he had genius -- I know 
it, because he hadn't had no opportunities to speak of, and it don't 
stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under 
them circumstances, if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel 
sorry when I think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it 
turned out.   
 
</p><p>Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and 
tom-cats, and all of them kind of things, till you couldn't rest, 
and you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but he'd match you. 
He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'klated 
to edercate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but 
set in his back yard and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he 
<hi>did</hi> learn him, too. He'd give him a little hunch behind, and 
the next minute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a 
doughnut -- see him turn one summerset, or may be a couple, if he 
got a good start, and come down flat-footed and all right, like a 
cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching flies, and kept him 
in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as far as 
he could see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and 
he could do most anything -- and I believe him. Why, I've seen him 
set Dan'l Webster down here on this floor -- Dan'l Webster was the 
name of the frog -- and sing out, "Flies, Dan'l, flies!" and 
quicker'n you could wink, he'd spring straight up, and snake a fly 
off'n the counter there, and flop down on the floor again as solid 
as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with 
his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' 
any more'n any frog might do.  You never see a frog so modest and 
straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And when it 
come to fair-and-square jumping on a dead level, he could get over 
more ground at one straddle than any animal of his breed you ever 
see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong suit, you understand, 
and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long 
as he had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he 
might be, for fellers that had traveled and ben everywheres, all 
said he laid over any frog that ever <hi>they</hi> see.   
 
</p><p> Well, Smiley kept the beast in a little lattice box, and he used 
to fetch him down town sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller 
-- a stranger in the camp, he was -- come across him with his box, 
and says:   
 
</p><p>"What might it be that you've got in the box?"   
 
</p><p>And Smiley says, sorter indifferent like, "It might be a parrot, 
or it might be a canary, may be, but it ain't -- it's only just a 
frog."   
 
</p><p> And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it 
round this way and that, and says, "H'm -- so 'tis. Well, what's 
<hi>he</hi> good for?"   
 
</p><p>"Well," Smiley says, easy and careless, "He's good enough for 
<hi>one</hi> thing, I should judge -- he can out-jump ary frog in 
Calaveras county."   
 
</p><p>The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular 
look, and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, "Well 
-- I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any 
other frog."   
 
</p><p>"Maybe you don't," Smiley says. "Maybe you 
understand frogs, and maybe you don't understand 'em; maybe you've 
had experience, and maybe you ain't only a amature, as it were. 
Anyways, I've got <hi>my</hi> opinion, and I'll resk forty dollars 
that he can outjump ary frog in Calaveras county."   
 
</p><p>And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad, 
like, "Well, I'm only a stranger here, and I ain't got no frog -- 
but if I had a frog, I'd bet you."   
 
</p><p>And then Smiley says, "That's all right -- that's all right -- if 
you'll hold my box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog." And so the 
feller took the box, and put up his forty dollars along with 
Smiley's, and set down to wait.  
 
</p><p>So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself, 
and then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a 
tea-spoon and filled him full of quail shot -- filled him pretty 
near up to his chin -- and set him on the floor.  Smiley he went to 
the swamp and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally 
he ketched a frog, and fetched him in, and give him to this feller, 
and says:   
 
</p><p>"Now if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his 
fore-paws just even with Dan'l's, and I'll give the word."  Then he 
says, "One -- two -- three -- jump!"  and him and the feller touched 
up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off, but Dan'l 
give a heave, and hysted up his shoulders -- so -- like a Frenchman, 
but it wasn't no use -- he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid 
as an anvil, and he couldn't no more stir than if he was anchored 
out.  Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, 
but he didn't have no idea what the matter was, of course. 
  
</p><p>The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out 
at the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulders -- this 
way -- at Dan'l, and says again, very deliberate, "Well, <hi>I</hi> 
don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other 
frog." 
 
</p><p>Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long 
time, and at last he says, "I do wonder what in the nation that frog 
throw'd off for -- I wonder if there ain't something the matter with 
him -- he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow" -- and he ketched 
Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and lifted him up and says, "Why, 
blame my cats, if he don't weigh five pound!" -- and turned him 
upside down, and he belched out a double-handful of shot.  And then 
he see how it was, and he was the maddest man -- he set the frog 
down and took out after that feller, but he never ketchd him. 
And----  
 
</p><p>[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front 
yard, and got up to go and see what was wanted.] And turning to me 
as he moved away, he said: "Just set where you are, stranger, and 
rest easy -- I an't going to be gone a second." 
 
</p><p>But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the 
history of the enterprising vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely to 
afford me much information concerning the Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, 
and so I started away.   
 
</p><p>At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he 
button-holed me and recommenced:   
 
</p><p>"Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yeller one-eyed cow that didn't 
have no tail, only jest a short stump like a bannanner, and " </p> 
<p>
"O, curse Smiley and his afflicted cow!" I muttered, good-naturedly, 
and bidding the old gentleman good-day, I departed.
