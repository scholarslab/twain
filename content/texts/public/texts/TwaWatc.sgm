MY beautiful new watch had run eighteen months 
without losing or gaining, and without breaking  
any part of its machinery or stopping. I had 
come to believe it infallible in its judgments about 
the time of day, and to consider its constitution and 
its anatomy imperishable. But at last, one night, I 
let it run down. I grieved about it as if it were a 
recognized messenger and forerunner of calamity. 
But by and by I cheered up, set the watch by guess, 
and commanded my bodings and superstitions to 
depart. Next day I stepped into the chief jeweler's 
to set it by the exact

time, and the head of the 
establishment took it out of my hand and proceeded 
to set it for me. Then he said, "She is four minutes  
slow -- regulator wants pushing up." I tried 
to stop him -- tried to make him understand that 
the watch kept perfect time. But no; all this 
human cabbage could see was that the watch was 
four minutes slow, and the regulator <hi>must</hi> be pushed 
up a little; and so, while I danced around him in 
anguish, and implored him to let the watch alone, 
he calmly and cruelly did the shameful deed. My 
watch began to gain. It gained faster and faster 
day by day. Within the week it sickened to a 
raging fever, and its pulse went up to a hundred 
and fifty in the shade. At the end of two months 
it had left all the timepieces of the town far in the 
rear, and was a fraction over thirteen days ahead of 
the almanac. It was away into November enjoying 
the snow, while the October leaves were still turning.  
It hurried up house rent, bills payable, and such 
things, in such a ruinous way that I could not abide 
it. I took it to the watchmaker to be regulated. 
He asked me if I had ever had it repaired. I said 
no, it had never needed any repairing. He looked 
a look of vicious happiness and eagerly pried the 
watch open, and then put a small dice box into his 
eye and peered into its machinery. He said it 
wanted cleaning and oiling, besides regulating -- 
come in a week. After being cleaned and oiled, 
and regulated, my watch slowed down to that degree 
that it ticked like a tolling bell. I began to be left 
by trains, I failed all appointments, I got to missing 
my dinner; my watch strung out three days' grace 
to four and let me go to protest; I gradually drifted 
back into yesterday, then day before, then into last 
week, and by and by the comprehension came upon 
me that all solitary and alone I was lingering along 
in week before last, and the

world was out of sight. 
I seemed to detect in myself a sort of sneaking 
fellow-feeling for the mummy in the museum, and 
desire to swap news with him. I went to a watch 
maker again. He took the watch all to pieces while 
I waited, and then said the barrel was "swelled." 
He said he could reduce it in three days. After this 
the watch <hi>averaged</hi> well, but nothing more. For 
half a day it would go like the very mischief, and 
keep up such a barking and wheezing and whooping 
and sneezing and snorting, that I could not hear 
myself think for the disturbance; and as long as it 
held out there was not a watch in the land that stood 
any chance against it. But the rest of the day it 
would keep on slowing down and fooling along until 
all the clocks it had left behind caught up again. 
So at last, at the end of twenty-four hours, it would 
trot up to the judges' stand all right and just in 
time. It would show a fair and square average, and 
no man could say it had done more or less than its 
duty. But a correct average is only a mild virtue in 
a watch, and I took this instrument to another 
watchmaker. He said the kingbolt was broken. I 
said I was glad it was nothing more serious. To 
tell the plain truth, I had no idea what the kingbolt 
was, but I did not choose to appear ignorant to a 
stranger. He repaired the kingbolt, but what the 
watch gained in one way it lost in another. It would 
run awhile and then stop awhile, and then run awhile 
again, and so on, using its own discretion about the 
intervals. And every time it went off it kicked back 
like a musket. I padded my breast for a few days, 
but finally took the watch to another watchmaker. 
He picked it all to pieces, and turned the ruin over 
and over under his glass; and then he said there 
appeared to be something the matter with the hair- 
trigger. He  
 
<pb n="20"> 
 
fixed it, and gave it a fresh start. It 
did well now, except that always at ten minutes to 
ten the hands would shut together like a pair of 
scissors, and from that time forth they would travel 
together. The oldest man in the world could not 
make head or tail of the time of day by such a 
watch, and so I went again to have the thing repaired.  
This person said that the crystal had got 
bent, and that the mainspring was not straight. He 
also remarked that part of the works needed half- 
soling. He made these things all right, and then 
my timepiece performed unexceptionably, save that 
now and then, after working along quietly for nearly 
eight hours, everything inside would let go all of a 
sudden and begin to buzz like a bee, and the hands 
would straightway begin to spin round and round so 
fast that their individuality was lost completely, and 
they simply seemed a delicate spider's web over the 
face of the watch. She would reel off the next 
twenty-four hours in six or seven minutes, and then 
stop with a bang. I went with a heavy heart to one 
more watchmaker, and looked on while he took her 
to pieces. Then I prepared to cross-question him 
rigidly, for this thing was getting serious. The watch 
had cost two hundred dollars originally, and I 
seemed to have paid out two or three thousand for 
repairs. While I waited and looked on I presently 
recognized in this watchmaker an old acquaintance 
-- a steamboat engineer of other days, and not a 
good engineer, either. He examined all the parts 
carefully, just as the other watchmakers had done, 
and then delivered his verdict with the same confidence  
of manner. 
</p> 
<p> 
He said: 
</p> 
<p> 
"She makes too much steam -- you want to hang 
the monkey-wrench on the safety-valve!" 
</p> 
<p> 
I brained him on the spot, and had him buried at 
my own expense. 
</p> 
<p> 
My uncle William (now deceased, alas!) used to 
say that a good horse was a good horse until it had 
run away once, and that a good watch was a good 
watch until the repairers got a chance at it. And he 
used to wonder what became of all the unsuccessful 
tinkers, and gunsmiths, and shoemakers, and engineers,  
and blacksmiths; but nobody could ever tell 
him.
