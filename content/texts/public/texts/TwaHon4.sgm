HONOLULU, MARCH, 1866.
</head>

<div2 type="section" n="1">
<head>OUR ARRIVAL ELABORATED A LITTLE MORE</head>

<p>We came in sight of two of this group of islands, Oahu and Molokai (pronounced
O-waw-hoo and Mollo-<hi>ki</hi>), on the morning of the 18th, and soon exchanged the
dark blue waters of the deep sea for the brilliant light blue of "sounding." The fat, ugly
birds (said to be a species of albatross) which had skimmed after us on tireless wings
clear across the ocean, left us, and an occasional flying fish went skimming over the
water in their stead. Oahu loomed high, rugged, treeless, barren, black and dreary, out of
the sea, and in the distance Molokai lay like a homely swaybacked whale on the water.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="2">
<head>THE HAWAIIAN FLAG</head>
<p>	As we rounded the promontory of Diamond Head (bringing into view a grove of
coconut trees, first ocular proof that we were in the tropics), we ran up the Stars and
Stripes at the main spencer gaff, and the Hawaiian flag at the fore. The latter is suggestive
of the prominent political elements of the Islands. It is part French, part English, part
American, and is Hawaiian in general. The union is the English cross; the remainder of
the flag (horizontal stripes) looks American, but has a blue French stripe in addition to
our red and white ones. The flag was gotten up by foreign legations in council with the
Hawaiian Government. The eight stripes refer to the eight islands which are inhabited;
the other four are barren rocks incapable of supporting a population.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="3">
<head>REFLECTIONS</head>
<p>	As we came in sight we fired a gun, and a good part of Honolulu turned out to
welcome the steamer. It was Sunday morning, and about church time, and we steamed
through the narrow channel to the music of six different church bells, which sent their
mellow tones far and wide, over hills and valleys, which were peopled by naked, savage,
thundering barbarians only fifty years ago! Six Christian churches within five miles of
the ruins of a pagan temple, where human sacrifices were daily offered up to hideous
idols in the last century! We were within pistol shot of one of a group of islands whose
ferocious inhabitants closed in upon the doomed and helpless Captain Cook and
murdered him, eighty-seven years ago; and lo! their descendants were at church! Behold
what the missionaries have wrought!</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="4">
<head>THE CROWD ON THE PIER</head>

<p>	By the time we had worked our slow way up to the wharf, under the guidance of
McIntyre, the pilot, a mixed crowd of four or five hundred people had assembled:
Chinamen, in the costume of their country; foreigners and the better class of natives, and
"half whites" in carriages and dressed in Sacramento summer fashion; other native men
on foot, some in the cast-off clothing of white folks, and a few wearing a battered hat, an
old ragged vest, and nothing else--at least nothing but an unnecessarily slender rag passed
between the legs; native women clad in a single garment--a bright colored robe or
wrapper as voluminous as a balloon, with full sleeves. This robe is "gathered" from
shoulder to shoulder, before and behind, and then descends in ample folds to the feet--seldom a chemise or any other undergarment--fits like a circus tent fits the tent pole, and
no hoops. These robes were bright yellow, or bright crimson, or pure black occasionally,
or gleaming white; but "solid colors" and "stunning" ones were the rule. They wore little
hats such as the sex wear in your cities, and some of the younger women had very pretty
faces and splendid black eyes and heavy masses of long black hair, occasionally put up in
a "net"; some of these dark, gingerbread colored beauties were on foot--generally on bare
foot, I may add--and others were on horseback--astraddle; they never ride any other way,
and they ought to know which way is best, for there are no more accomplished
horsewomen in the world, it is said. The balance of the crowd consisted chiefly of little
half-naked native boys and girls. All were chattering in the catchy, chopped-up Kanaka
language; but what they were chattering about will always remain a mystery to me.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="5">
<head>THE KING</head>
<p>	Captain Fitch said, "There's the King! that's him in the buggy! I know him far as I
can see him."</p>

<p>	I had never seen a king in my life, and I naturally took out my notebook and put
him down: "Tall, slender, dark; full-bearded; green frock coat, with lapels and collar
bordered with gold band an inch wide; plug hat--broad gold band around it; royal
costume looks too much like a livery; this man isn't as fleshy as I thought he was."</p>

<p>	I had just got these notes entered when Captain Fitch discovered that he had got
hold of the wrong King--or, rather, that he had got hold of the King's driver or a carriage--driver of one of the nobility. The King was not present at all. It was a great
disappointment to me. I heard afterward that the comfortable, easy-going King
Kamehameha (pronounced Ka-may-ah-may-ah) V had been seen sitting on a barrel on
the wharf, the day before, fishing; but there was no consolation in that; that did not
restore to me my lost King. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="6">
<head>HONOLULU</head>
<p>The town of Honolulu (said to contain between twelve thousand and fifteen
thousand inhabitants) is spread over a dead level; has streets from twenty to thirty feet
wide, solid and level as a floor, most of them straight as a line and a few as crooked as a
corkscrew; houses one and two stories high, built of wood, straw, 'dobes, and dull cream-colored
pebble-and-shell-conglomerated coral cut into oblong square blocks and laid in
cement, but no brick houses; there are great yards, more like plazas, about a large number
of the dwelling houses, and these are carpeted with bright green grass, into which your
foot sinks out of sight; and they are ornamented by a hundred species of beautiful flowers
and blossoming shrubs, and shaded by noble tamarind trees and the "Pride of India," with
its fragrant flower, and by the "Umbrella Tree," and I do not know how many more. I had
rather smell Honolulu at sunset than the old police courtroom in San Francisco. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="7">
<head>ALMOST A KING</head>
<p>	I had not shaved since I left San Francisco--ten days. As soon as I got ashore, I
hunted for a striped pole, and shortly found one. I always had a yearning to be a king.
This may never be, I suppose. But at any rate it will always be a satisfaction to me to
know that if I am not a king, I am the next thing to it--I have been shaved by the King's
barber. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="8">
<head>LANDSMEN ON "SEA LEGS"</head>

<p>	Walking about on shore was very uncomfortable at first; there was no spring to
the solid ground, and I missed the heaving and rolling of the ship's deck; it was
unpleasant to lean unconsciously to an anticipated lurch of the world and find that the
world did not lurch, as it should have done. And there was something else missed--something gone something wanting, I could not tell what--a dismal vacuum of some kind
or other--a sense of emptiness. But I found out what it was presently. It was the absence
of the ceaseless dull hum of beating waves and whipping sails and fluttering of the
propeller, and creaking of the ship--sounds I had become so accustomed to that I had
ceased to notice them and had become unaware of their existence until the deep Sunday
stillness on shore made me vaguely conscious that a familiar spirit of some kind or other
was gone from me. Walking on the solid earth with legs used to the "giving" of the decks
under his tread made Brown sick, and he went off to bed and left me to wander alone
about this odd-looking city of the tropics.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="9">
<head>NEW SCENES AND STRONG CONTRASTS</head>
<p>The further I traveled through the town the better I liked it. Every step revealed a
new contrast--disclosed something I was unaccustomed to. In place of the grand mud-colored brown stone fronts of San Francisco, I saw neat white cottages, with green
window shutters; in place of front yards like billiard tables with iron fences around them,
I saw those cottages surrounded by ample yards, about like Portsmouth Square (as to
size), thickly clad with green grass, and shaded by tall trees, through whose dense foliage
the sun could scarcely penetrate; in place of the customary infernal geranium languishing
in dust and general debility on tin-roofed rear additions or in bedroom windows, I saw
luxurious banks and thickets of flowers, fresh as a meadow after a rain, and glowing with
the richest dyes; in place of the dingy horrors of the "Willows," and the painful sharp-pointed shrubbery of that funny caricature of nature which they call "South Park," I saw
huge-bodied, wide-spreading forest trees, with strange names and stranger appearance--trees that cast a shadow like a thundercloud, and were able to stand alone without being
tied to green poles; in place of those vile, tiresome, stupid, everlasting goldfish, wiggling
around in glass globes and assuming all shades and degrees of distortion through the
magnifying and diminishing qualities of their transparent prison houses, I saw cats--Tom
cats, Mary Ann cats, long-tailed cats, bobtail cats, blind cats, one-eyed cats, walleyed
cats, cross-eyed cats, gray cats, black cats, white cats, yellow cats, striped cats, spotted
cats, tame cats, wild cats, singed cats, individual cats, groups of cats, platoons of cats,
companies of cats, regiments of cats, armies of cats, multitudes of cats, millions of cats,
and all of them sleek, fat, lazy, and sound asleep; in place of roughs and rowdies staring
and blackguarding on the corners, I saw long-haired, saddle-colored Sandwich Island
maidens sitting on the ground in the shade of corner houses, gazing indolently at
whatever or whoever happened along; instead of that wretched cobblestone pavement
nuisance, I walked on a firm foundation of coral, built up from the bottom of the sea by
the absurd but persevering insect of that name, with a light layer of lava and cinders
overlying the coral, belched up out of fathomless hell long ago through the seared and
blackened crater that stands dead and cold and harmless yonder in the distance now;
instead of cramped and crowded streetcars, I met dusky native women sweeping by, free
as the wind, on fleet horses and astraddle, with gaudy riding sashes streaming like
banners behind them; instead of the combined stenches of Sacramento Street, Chinadom,
and Brannan Street slaughterhouses, I breathed the balmy fragrance of jessamine,
oleander, and the Pride of India; in place of the hurry and bustle and noisy confusion of
San Francisco, I moved in the midst of a summer calm as tranquil as dawn in the Garden
of Eden; in place of our familiar skirting sand hills and the placid bay, I saw on the one
side a framework of tall, precipitous mountains close at hand, clad in refreshing green,
and cleft by deep, cool, chasmlike valleys--and in front the grand sweep of the ocean; a
brilliant, transparent green near the shore, bound and bordered by a long white line of
foamy spray dashing against the reef, and further out the dead blue water of the deep sea,
flecked with "white caps," and in the far horizon a single, lonely sail--</p>

<p>	At this moment, this man Brown, who has no better manners than to read over
one's shoulder, observes: </p>

<p>	"Yes, and hot. Oh, I reckon not (only 82 in the shade)! Go on, now, and put it all
down, now that you've begun; just say, 'And more "santipedes," and cockroaches, and
fleas, and lizards, and red ants, and scorpions, and spiders, and mosquitoes and
missionaries'--oh, blame my cats if I'd live here two months, not if I was High-You-Muck-a-Muck and King of Wawhoo, and had a harem full of hyenas!" (Wahine, most
generally pronounced Wyheeny, seems to answer for wife, woman, and female of
questionable character, indifferently. I never can get this man Brown to understand that
"hyena" is not the proper pronunciation. He says "It ain't any odds; it describes some of
 'em, anyway.") </p>

<p>	I remarked: "But, Mr. Brown, these are trifles."</p>

<p>"Trifles be--blowed! You get nipped by one of them scorpions once, and see how
you like it! There was Mrs. Jones, swabbing her face with a sponge; she felt something
grab her cheek; she dropped the sponge and out popped a scorpion an inch and a half
long! Well, she just got up and danced the Highland fling for two hours and a half--and
yell!--why, you could have heard her from Lu-wow to Hoolahoola, with the wind fair!
and for three days she soaked her cheek in brandy and salt, and it swelled up as big as
your two fists. And you want to know what made me light out of bed so sudden last
night? Only a 'santipede'--nothing, only a 'santipede,' with forty-two legs on a side, and
every foot hot enough to burn a hole through a rawhide. Don't you know one of them
things grabbed Miss Boone's foot when she was riding one day? He was hid in the
stirrup, and just clamped himself around her foot and sunk his fangs plum through her
shoe; and she just throwed her whole soul into one war whoop and then fainted. And she
didn't get out of bed nor set that foot on the floor again for three weeks. And how did
Captain Godfrey always get off so easy? Why, because he always carried a bottle full of
scorpions and santipedes soaked in alcohol, and whenever he got bit he bathed the place
with that devilish mixture or took a drink out of it, I don't recollect which. And how did
he have to do once, when he hadn't his bottle along? He had to cut out the bite with his
knife and fill up the hole with arnica, and then prop his mouth open with the bootjack to
keep from getting the lockjaw. Oh, fill me up about this lovely country! You can go on
writing that slop about balmy breezes and fragrant flowers, and all that sort of truck, but
you're not going to leave out them santipedes and things for want of being reminded of it,
you know." </p>

<p> I said mildly: "But, Mr. Brown, these are the mere--" </p>

<p>	"Mere--your grandmother! they ain't the mere anything! What's the use of you
telling me they're the mere--mere--whatever it was you was going to call it? You look at
them raw splotches all over my face--all over my arms--all over my body! Mosquito
bites! Don't tell me about mere--mere things! You can't get around them mosquito bites. I
took and brushed out my bar [mosquito net] good night before last, and tucked it in all
around, and before morning I was eternally thawed up, anyhow. And the night before I
fastened her up all right, and got in bed and smoked that old strong pipe until I got
strangled and smothered and couldn't get out, and then they swarmed in there and
jammed their bills through my shirt and sucked me as dry as a life preserver before I got
my breath again. And how did that deadfall work? I was two days making it, and sweated
two buckets full of brine, and blame the mosquito even went under it; and sloshing
around in my sleep I ketched my foot in it and got it	flattened out so that it wouldn't go
into a green turtle shell forty-four inches across the back. Jim Ayers grinding out seven
double verses of poetry about Waw-<hi>hoo</hi>! and crying about leaving the blasted
place in the two last verses; and you slobbering here about--there you are!  Now--<hi>now</hi>, what do you say? That yellow spider could straddle over a saucer just like
nothing--and if I hadn't been here to set that spittoon on him, he would have been between
your sheets in a minute--he was traveling straight for your bed--he had his eye on it. Just
pull at that web that he's been stringing after him--pretty near as hard to break as sewing
silk; and look at his feet sticking out all round the spittoon. Oh, confound Waw-<hi>hoo</hi>!" </p>

<p>  I am glad Brown has got disgusted at that murdered spider and gone; I don't like to be
interrupted when I am writing--especially by Brown, who is one of those men who
always looks at the unpleasant side of every thing, and I seldom do. </p>
