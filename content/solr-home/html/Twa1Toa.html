               <br> Woman — God bless her. <p id="Twa1Toad1e153">
               <span class="del"></span>The toast includes<br> the sex, universally: it
               is to Woman,<br> comprehensively, wheresoever<br> she may be found. Let us con-<br> sider her ways. First, comes the<br> matter of
               dress. This is a most<br> important consideration, in a<br>
               <hr> subject of this nature, &amp; must<br> be disposed of
               before we can<br>
               <span class="add">intelligently</span> proceed to examine the
               profounder<br> depths of the theme. For text, let<br> us take the dress of two
               antipodal<br> types — the savage woman of<br>
               entral Africa, &amp; the cultivated<br> daughter of our
               high modern<br> civilization. Among the<br> Fans, a great negro tribe, a
               woman,<br> when dressed for <span class="del">breakfast, or</span><br>
               <span class="add">home, or to go to market, or go out</span><br>
               <span class="del">a pick-up dinner, or to sit at home,<br> or to go
                  out calling, or to a simple or to take a simple tea with<br>
                  friends &amp; neighbors, or to go out</span><br> calling, does not wear anything<br>
               <hr> at all but just her complexion.<br> That is all; that
               is her entire<br> outfit. It is the lightest cos-<br>
                  tume in the world, but is made<br> of the darkest material. It has<br>
               often been mistaken for mourning.<br> It is the trimmest, &amp; neatest, &amp; grace-<br> fulest costume that is now in<br> fashion;
               it wears well, is fast<br> colors, doesn't show dirt; you<br> don't have to send it
               down town<br> to wash, &amp; have some of it come<br> back scorched with the
               flat-iron, &amp;<br> some of it with the buttons ironed<br> off, &amp; some of it
               petrified with<br> starch, &amp; some of it chewed by the<br>
               <hr> calf, &amp; some of it rotted with<br> acids, &amp;
               some of it exchanged<br> for other customers' things that <span class="del"></span><br>
               <span class="add">haven't any virtue but holiness,</span><br>
               <span class="del"></span><span class="del">&amp; don't
                  fit you anyhow,</span><br> &amp; ten-twelfths of the pieces over-<br> charged for, &amp; the rest of the dozen<br>
               <span class="del">stolen</span><span class="add">"mislaid."</span> And it always fits; it is the<br> perfection of a fit. And it
               is the<br> handiest dress in the whole realm<br> of fashion. It is always ready,
                  <span class="add">always "done up."</span><br> When you call on a
               Fan lady &amp;<br> send up your card, the hired<br> girl never says, "Please
               take<br> a seat, madam is dressing — <br> she will be down in
               three-quarters<br> of an hour." No, madam is<br> always dressed, always ready<br>
               <hr> to receive; &amp; before you can get<br> the door-mat
               before your eyes, she<br> is in your midst. <span class="del">And the hired<br> girl never has to say to a lady<br> visitor,
                     "Please excuse madam,<br> she is undressing;" &amp; even if<br> she ever had
                     to bring such an<br> excuse at all, she wouldn't say<br> it in that way: she
                     would say,<br> "Please excuse madam, she's skins,<br> not
                  herself!"</span> Then again, the<br> Fan ladies don't go to church
               to<br> see what each other has got on;<br> &amp; they don't go back home &amp;
               describe<br> it &amp; slander it. <span class="del">The farthest
                  they<br> ever go is to say some little biting<br> thing about the ultra
                  fashionables</span></p><hr><p id="Twa1Toad1e371"> Such is the dark child of<br> savagery, as to every-day<br> toilette; &amp; <span class="del"></span> thus, curiously<br> enough, she finds a point
               of<br> contact with the fair daughter<br> of civilization &amp; high fashion<br>
               — who has often has "nothing to wear;"<br> &amp; thus these widely separated
               types<br> of the sex meet upon common<br> ground. Yes, such is the Fan<br> woman,
               as she appears in her<br> simple, unostentatious every-<br>
                  day toilette. But on state<br> occasions she is more dressy.<br>
               <span class="del">much more dressy.</span> At a<br> banquet she <span class="del">wears</span>
               <span class="add">wears</span> bracelets; at<br> a lecture she wears
               earrings &amp; a<br> belt; at a ball she wears stockings — <br>
               <hr> &amp; with the true feminine fondness<br> for display,
               she wears them on her<br> arms; at a funeral she wears a<br> jacket of tar &amp;
               ashes; at a wed-<br> ding the bride who can afford<br>
               it puts on pantaloons. Thus the<br> dark child of savagery &amp; the<br> fair
               daughter of civilization<br> meet once more upon com-<br>
                  mon ground; &amp; these two<br> touches of nature make<br> their whole
               world kin. </p><p id="Twa1Toad1e458"> Now we will consider<br> the dress of our other type. A<br> large part of the
               daughter of<br> civilization is her dress — as<br> it should be. Some civilized<br>
               <hr> women would lose half their<br> charm without dress;
               &amp; some<br> would lose all of it. The daughter<br> of modern civilization,
               dressed<br> at her utmost best, is a marvel<br> of exquisite &amp; beautiful art,
               &amp; ex-<br> pense. All the lands, all the climes,<br>
               &amp; all the arts are laid under tribute<br> to furnish her forth. Her linen<br>
               is from <span class="del"></span><span class="add">Belfast,</span> her robe is<br> from Paris, her lace is from<br> Venice, or
               Spain, or France;<br> her feathers are from the remote<br> regions of Southern
               Africa,<br> her furs from the remoter<br> home of the iceberg &amp; the au-<br> rora; her fan from Japan,<br>
               <hr> her diamonds from Brazil,<br> her bracelets from
               California,<br> her pearls from Ceylon, her<br> cameos from Rome; she has<br>
               <span class="del">glass</span> gems &amp; trinkets
               from<br> buried Pompeii; &amp; others<br> that graced comely Egyptian<br> forms
               that have been dust &amp;<br> ashes, now, for forty centuries;<br> her watch is
               from Geneva, her<br> card-case is from China,<br> her hair is from — from
               — <span class="del">I</span><br>
               <span class="del">from the store, I believe. That</span><br>
               <span class="add">I don't know where her hair is from; I never</span>
               <br>
               <span class="add">could find out. That</span> is, her other hair
               — her public<br> hair, her Sunday hair; I don't<br> mean the hair she goes to
               bed with.<br>
               <hr> Why, you <span class="del">ought
                  to</span>
               <span class="add">ought to</span> know the hair<br> I mean; it's
               that thing which<br> she calls a switch, &amp; which<br> resembles a switch as<br>
               much as it resembles a<br> brickbat, or a shotgun,<br> or any other thing
               which<br> you correct people with.<br> It's that thing which she<br> twists, &amp;
               then coils round<br> &amp; round her head, beehive-<br>
                  fashion, &amp; then tucks the end<br> in under the hive &amp;
               harpoons<br> it with a hairpin. And that<br> reminds me of a trifle: any<br>
               <span class="del">time</span> time you want to, you<br>
               <hr>
               <span class="del"></span>can glance around the<br> carpet of a
               Pullman<br> car &amp; go &amp; pick up a<br> hairpin; but not to<br> save your
               life can you<br> get any woman in that<br> car to acknowledge that<br> hairpin.
               Now isn't<br> that strange? But it's<br> true. The woman who<br> has never swerved
               from<br> cast-iron veracity &amp; fi-<br> delity in her
               whole life, will,<br> when confronted with this<br> crucial test, deny her hair-<br>
               <hr>
               pin. She will deny that<br> hairpin before a
               hundred<br> witnesses. I have <span class="add">stupidly</span>
               got<br> into more trouble, &amp; more<br> hot water trying to<br> hunt up the
               owner<br> of a hairpin in a<br> Pullman car than by<br> any other indiscre-<br> tion of my life. </p><hr><p id="Twa1Toad1e697"> Well, you can see what the daugh-<br> ter of
               civilization is, when she<br> is dressed; &amp; you have seen what<br> the daughter
               of savagery is<br> when she isn't. Such is Woman,<br> as to costume. I come,
               now,<br> to consider her in her higher &amp;<br> nobler aspects — as <span class="del">sister,</span> mother, <span class="del">sweetheart,</span>
               <span class="del"><span class="add">sister,
                     daughter</span></span> wife, widow,<br>
               <span class="del">neighbor, poor relation</span>
               <span class="add">grass-widow,</span>
               mother-<br> in-law,
               <span class="del">woman's-rights skir-<br>
                     misher, platform-reader, actress,</span><br>
               <span class="del"></span> hired girl, tele-<br>
                  graph operator, telephone helloer,<br>
               <span class="del">store clerk, washer-woman, school-<br> marm, queen,</span>
               <span class="add">queen,</span> book-agent, wet-<br>
               <hr>
               nurse, step-mother, boss, pro-<br> fessional fat woman, pro-<br>
                  fessional double-headed<br> woman, professional beauty,<br> &amp; so
               forth &amp; so on. </p><p id="Twa1Toad1e795"> We will simply discuss<br> these few — let the rest of the<br> sex <span class="del">wait</span>
               <span class="add">tarry in Jericho till we come again.</span> First
               in the list, of<br> right, &amp; first in <hr> our
               gratitude, comes a woman <span class="add">who — </span>
               <span class="add">why,</span><br>
               <span class="del">without whom, I ask you, where<br> would be those
                  priceless treasures<br> without which are all that make<br> our lives worth the
                  living. Yes,<br> where would be our wives &amp; chil-<br>
                     dren if there hadn't been any<br> mother-in-law? She — why,</span>
               <span class="del"></span>
               <span class="add">dear me, I've been talking three-quarters of
                  an<br> hour!</span> I beg a thousand pardons. But<br> you see, yourselves, that I
               had a<br> large contract. I have accom-<br> plished
               something, anyway: I<br> have introduced my subject; &amp; if I<br> had till next

               that I could discuss it as<br> adequately &amp; appreciatively as a<br>
               <hr> so gracious &amp; noble a theme de-<br> serves. But as the matter stands,<br> now, let us finish as we
               began<br> — &amp; say, without jesting, but with<br> all sincerity, "Woman

                  mon ground; &amp; these two<br> touches of nature make<br> their whole
               world kin. </p><p id="Twa1Toad1e458"> Now we will consider<br> the dress of our other type. A<br> large part of the
               daughter of<br> civilization is her dress — as<br> it should be. Some civilized<br>
               <hr> women would lose half their<br> charm without dress;
               &amp; some<br> would lose all of it. The daughter<br> of modern civilization,
               dressed<br> at her utmost best, is a marvel<br> of exquisite &amp; beautiful art,

               &amp; all the arts are laid under tribute<br> to furnish her forth. Her linen<br>

               <hr> her diamonds from Brazil,<br> her bracelets from

               <span class="del">glass</span> gems &amp; trinkets

               that have been dust &amp;<br> ashes, now, for forty centuries;<br> her watch is
               from Geneva, her<br> card-case is from China,<br> her hair is from — from
               — <span class="del">I</span><br>
               <span class="del">from the store, I believe. That</span><br>
               <span class="add">I don't know where her hair is from; I never</span>
               <br>
               <span class="add">could find out. That</span> is, her other hair
               — her public<br> hair, her Sunday hair; I don't<br> mean the hair she goes to
               bed with.<br>
               <hr> Why, you <span class="del">ought
                  to</span>
               <span class="add">ought to</span> know the hair<br> I mean; it's
               that thing which<br> she calls a switch, &amp; which<br> resembles a switch as<br>
               much as it resembles a<br> brickbat, or a shotgun,<br> or any other thing
               which<br> you correct people with.<br> It's that thing which she<br> twists, &amp;
               then coils round<br> &amp; round her head, beehive-<br>
                  fashion, &amp; then tucks the end<br> in under the hive &amp;
               harpoons<br> it with a hairpin. And that<br> reminds me of a trifle: any<br>
               <span class="del">time</span> time you want to, you<br>

               Now isn't<br> that strange? But it's<br> true. The woman who<br> has never swerved
               from<br> cast-iron veracity &amp; fi-<br> delity in her
               whole life, will,<br> when confronted with this<br> crucial test, deny her hair-<br>
               <hr>
               pin. She will deny that<br> hairpin before a

               got<br> into more trouble, &amp; more<br> hot water trying to<br> hunt up the

               <br> Woman — God bless her. <p id="Twa1Toad1e153">
               <span class="del"></span>The toast includes<br> the sex, universally: it
               is to Woman,<br> comprehensively, wheresoever<br> she may be found. Let us con-<br> sider her ways. First, comes the<br> matter of
               dress. This is a most<br> important consideration, in a<br>
               <hr> subject of this nature, &amp; must<br> be disposed of
               before we can<br>
               <span class="add">intelligently</span> proceed to examine the
               profounder<br> depths of the theme. For text, let<br> us take the dress of two
               antipodal<br> types — the savage woman of<br>
               entral Africa, &amp; the cultivated<br> daughter of our
               high modern<br> civilization. Among the<br> Fans, a great negro tribe, a
               woman,<br> when dressed for <span class="del">breakfast, or</span><br>
               <span class="add">home, or to go to market, or go out</span><br>
               <span class="del">a pick-up dinner, or to sit at home,<br> or to go
                  out calling, or to a simple or to take a simple tea with<br>
                  friends &amp; neighbors, or to go out</span><br> calling, does not wear anything<br>
               <hr> at all but just her complexion.<br> That is all; that
               is her entire<br> outfit. It is the lightest cos-<br>
                  tume in the world, but is made<br> of the darkest material. It has<br>
               often been mistaken for mourning.<br> It is the trimmest, &amp; neatest, &amp; grace-<br> fulest costume that is now in<br> fashion;
               it wears well, is fast<br> colors, doesn't show dirt; you<br> don't have to send it
               down town<br> to wash, &amp; have some of it come<br> back scorched with the
               flat-iron, &amp;<br> some of it with the buttons ironed<br> off, &amp; some of it
               petrified with<br> starch, &amp; some of it chewed by the<br>
               <hr> calf, &amp; some of it rotted with<br> acids, &amp;
               some of it exchanged<br> for other customers' things that <span class="del"></span><br>
               <span class="add">haven't any virtue but holiness,</span><br>
               <span class="del"></span><span class="del">&amp; don't
                  fit you anyhow,</span><br> &amp; ten-twelfths of the pieces over-<br> charged for, &amp; the rest of the dozen<br>
               <span class="del">stolen</span><span class="add">"mislaid."</span> And it always fits; it is the<br> perfection of a fit. And it
               is the<br> handiest dress in the whole realm<br> of fashion. It is always ready,
                  <span class="add">always "done up."</span><br> When you call on a
               Fan lady &amp;<br> send up your card, the hired<br> girl never says, "Please
               take<br> a seat, madam is dressing — <br> she will be down in
               three-quarters<br> of an hour." No, madam is<br> always dressed, always ready<br>
               <hr> to receive; &amp; before you can get<br> the door-mat
               before your eyes, she<br> is in your midst. <span class="del">And the hired<br> girl never has to say to a lady<br> visitor,
                     "Please excuse madam,<br> she is undressing;" &amp; even if<br> she ever had
                     to bring such an<br> excuse at all, she wouldn't say<br> it in that way: she
                     would say,<br> "Please excuse madam, she's skins,<br> not
                  herself!"</span> Then again, the<br> Fan ladies don't go to church
               to<br> see what each other has got on;<br> &amp; they don't go back home &amp;
               describe<br> it &amp; slander it. <span class="del">The farthest
                  they<br> ever go is to say some little biting<br> thing about the ultra
                  fashionables</span></p><hr><p id="Twa1Toad1e371"> Such is the dark child of<br> savagery, as to every-day<br> toilette; &amp; <span class="del"></span> thus, curiously<br> enough, she finds a point
               of<br> contact with the fair daughter<br> of civilization &amp; high fashion<br>
               — who has often has "nothing to wear;"<br> &amp; thus these widely separated
               types<br> of the sex meet upon common<br> ground. Yes, such is the Fan<br> woman,
               as she appears in her<br> simple, unostentatious every-<br>
                  day toilette. But on state<br> occasions she is more dressy.<br>
               <span class="del">much more dressy.</span> At a<br> banquet she <span class="del">wears</span>
               <span class="add">wears</span> bracelets; at<br> a lecture she wears
               earrings &amp; a<br> belt; at a ball she wears stockings — <br>
               <hr> &amp; with the true feminine fondness<br> for display,
               she wears them on her<br> arms; at a funeral she wears a<br> jacket of tar &amp;
               ashes; at a wed-<br> ding the bride who can afford<br>
               it puts on pantaloons. Thus the<br> dark child of savagery &amp; the<br> fair
               daughter of civilization<br> meet once more upon com-<br>
                  mon ground; &amp; these two<br> touches of nature make<br> their whole
               world kin. </p><p id="Twa1Toad1e458"> Now we will consider<br> the dress of our other type. A<br> large part of the

               <span class="del"></span>The toast includes<br> the sex, universally: it
               is to Woman,<br> comprehensively, wheresoever<br> she may be found. Let us con-<br> sider her ways. First, comes the<br> matter of
               dress. This is a most<br> important consideration, in a<br>
               <hr> subject of this nature, &amp; must<br> be disposed of
               before we can<br>
               <span class="add">intelligently</span> proceed to examine the
               profounder<br> depths of the theme. For text, let<br> us take the dress of two
               antipodal<br> types — the savage woman of<br>
               entral Africa, &amp; the cultivated<br> daughter of our
               high modern<br> civilization. Among the<br> Fans, a great negro tribe, a
               woman,<br> when dressed for <span class="del">breakfast, or</span><br>
               <span class="add">home, or to go to market, or go out</span><br>
               <span class="del">a pick-up dinner, or to sit at home,<br> or to go
                  out calling, or to a simple or to take a simple tea with<br>
                  friends &amp; neighbors, or to go out</span><br> calling, does not wear anything<br>
               <hr> at all but just her complexion.<br> That is all; that
               is her entire<br> outfit. It is the lightest cos-<br>
                  tume in the world, but is made<br> of the darkest material. It has<br>
               often been mistaken for mourning.<br> It is the trimmest, &amp; neatest, &amp; grace-<br> fulest costume that is now in<br> fashion;
               it wears well, is fast<br> colors, doesn't show dirt; you<br> don't have to send it
               down town<br> to wash, &amp; have some of it come<br> back scorched with the
               flat-iron, &amp;<br> some of it with the buttons ironed<br> off, &amp; some of it
               petrified with<br> starch, &amp; some of it chewed by the<br>
               <hr> calf, &amp; some of it rotted with<br> acids, &amp;
               some of it exchanged<br> for other customers' things that <span class="del"></span><br>
               <span class="add">haven't any virtue but holiness,</span><br>
               <span class="del"></span><span class="del">&amp; don't
                  fit you anyhow,</span><br> &amp; ten-twelfths of the pieces over-<br> charged for, &amp; the rest of the dozen<br>
               <span class="del">stolen</span><span class="add">"mislaid."</span> And it always fits; it is the<br> perfection of a fit. And it
               is the<br> handiest dress in the whole realm<br> of fashion. It is always ready,
                  <span class="add">always "done up."</span><br> When you call on a
               Fan lady &amp;<br> send up your card, the hired<br> girl never says, "Please
               take<br> a seat, madam is dressing — <br> she will be down in
               three-quarters<br> of an hour." No, madam is<br> always dressed, always ready<br>
               <hr> to receive; &amp; before you can get<br> the door-mat
               before your eyes, she<br> is in your midst. <span class="del">And the hired<br> girl never has to say to a lady<br> visitor,
                     "Please excuse madam,<br> she is undressing;" &amp; even if<br> she ever had
                     to bring such an<br> excuse at all, she wouldn't say<br> it in that way: she
                     would say,<br> "Please excuse madam, she's skins,<br> not
                  herself!"</span> Then again, the<br> Fan ladies don't go to church
               to<br> see what each other has got on;<br> &amp; they don't go back home &amp;
               describe<br> it &amp; slander it. <span class="del">The farthest
                  they<br> ever go is to say some little biting<br> thing about the ultra
                  fashionables</span></p><hr><p id="Twa1Toad1e371"> Such is the dark child of<br> savagery, as to every-day<br> toilette; &amp; <span class="del"></span> thus, curiously<br> enough, she finds a point
               of<br> contact with the fair daughter<br> of civilization &amp; high fashion<br>
               — who has often has "nothing to wear;"<br> &amp; thus these widely separated
               types<br> of the sex meet upon common<br> ground. Yes, such is the Fan<br> woman,
               as she appears in her<br> simple, unostentatious every-<br>
                  day toilette. But on state<br> occasions she is more dressy.<br>
               <span class="del">much more dressy.</span> At a<br> banquet she <span class="del">wears</span>
               <span class="add">wears</span> bracelets; at<br> a lecture she wears
               earrings &amp; a<br> belt; at a ball she wears stockings — <br>
               <hr> &amp; with the true feminine fondness<br> for display,
               she wears them on her<br> arms; at a funeral she wears a<br> jacket of tar &amp;
               ashes; at a wed-<br> ding the bride who can afford<br>
               it puts on pantaloons. Thus the<br> dark child of savagery &amp; the<br> fair
               daughter of civilization<br> meet once more upon com-<br>
                  mon ground; &amp; these two<br> touches of nature make<br> their whole
               world kin. </p><p id="Twa1Toad1e458"> Now we will consider<br> the dress of our other type. A<br> large part of the
               daughter of<br> civilization is her dress — as<br> it should be. Some civilized<br>
               <hr> women would lose half their<br> charm without dress;
               &amp; some<br> would lose all of it. The daughter<br> of modern civilization,
               dressed<br> at her utmost best, is a marvel<br> of exquisite &amp; beautiful art,
               &amp; ex-<br> pense. All the lands, all the climes,<br>
               &amp; all the arts are laid under tribute<br> to furnish her forth. Her linen<br>
               is from <span class="del"></span><span class="add">Belfast,</span> her robe is<br> from Paris, her lace is from<br> Venice, or
               Spain, or France;<br> her feathers are from the remote<br> regions of Southern
               Africa,<br> her furs from the remoter<br> home of the iceberg &amp; the au-<br> rora; her fan from Japan,<br>
               <hr> her diamonds from Brazil,<br> her bracelets from
               California,<br> her pearls from Ceylon, her<br> cameos from Rome; she has<br>
               <span class="del">glass</span> gems &amp; trinkets
               from<br> buried Pompeii; &amp; others<br> that graced comely Egyptian<br> forms
               that have been dust &amp;<br> ashes, now, for forty centuries;<br> her watch is
               from Geneva, her<br> card-case is from China,<br> her hair is from — from
               — <span class="del">I</span><br>
               <span class="del">from the store, I believe. That</span><br>
               <span class="add">I don't know where her hair is from; I never</span>
               <br>
               <span class="add">could find out. That</span> is, her other hair
               — her public<br> hair, her Sunday hair; I don't<br> mean the hair she goes to
               bed with.<br>
               <hr> Why, you <span class="del">ought
                  to</span>
               <span class="add">ought to</span> know the hair<br> I mean; it's
               that thing which<br> she calls a switch, &amp; which<br> resembles a switch as<br>
               much as it resembles a<br> brickbat, or a shotgun,<br> or any other thing
               which<br> you correct people with.<br> It's that thing which she<br> twists, &amp;
               then coils round<br> &amp; round her head, beehive-<br>
                  fashion, &amp; then tucks the end<br> in under the hive &amp;
               harpoons<br> it with a hairpin. And that<br> reminds me of a trifle: any<br>
               <span class="del">time</span> time you want to, you<br>
               <hr>
               <span class="del"></span>can glance around the<br> carpet of a
               Pullman<br> car &amp; go &amp; pick up a<br> hairpin; but not to<br> save your
               life can you<br> get any woman in that<br> car to acknowledge that<br> hairpin.
               Now isn't<br> that strange? But it's<br> true. The woman who<br> has never swerved
               from<br> cast-iron veracity &amp; fi-<br> delity in her
               whole life, will,<br> when confronted with this<br> crucial test, deny her hair-<br>
               <hr>
               pin. She will deny that<br> hairpin before a
               hundred<br> witnesses. I have <span class="add">stupidly</span>
               got<br> into more trouble, &amp; more<br> hot water trying to<br> hunt up the
               owner<br> of a hairpin in a<br> Pullman car than by<br> any other indiscre-<br> tion of my life. </p><hr><p id="Twa1Toad1e697"> Well, you can see what the daugh-<br> ter of
               civilization is, when she<br> is dressed; &amp; you have seen what<br> the daughter
               of savagery is<br> when she isn't. Such is Woman,<br> as to costume. I come,
               now,<br> to consider her in her higher &amp;<br> nobler aspects — as <span class="del">sister,</span> mother, <span class="del">sweetheart,</span>
               <span class="del"><span class="add">sister,
                     daughter</span></span> wife, widow,<br>
               <span class="del">neighbor, poor relation</span>
               <span class="add">grass-widow,</span>
               mother-<br> in-law,
               <span class="del">woman's-rights skir-<br>
                     misher, platform-reader, actress,</span><br>
               <span class="del"></span> hired girl, tele-<br>
                  graph operator, telephone helloer,<br>
               <span class="del">store clerk, washer-woman, school-<br> marm, queen,</span>
               <span class="add">queen,</span> book-agent, wet-<br>

               nurse, step-mother, boss, pro-<br> fessional fat woman, pro-<br>
                  fessional double-headed<br> woman, professional beauty,<br> &amp; so
               forth &amp; so on. </p><p id="Twa1Toad1e795"> We will simply discuss<br> these few — let the rest of the<br> sex <span class="del">wait</span>

                     would say,<br> "Please excuse madam, she's skins,<br> not
                  herself!"</span> Then again, the<br> Fan ladies don't go to church
               to<br> see what each other has got on;<br> &amp; they don't go back home &amp;
               describe<br> it &amp; slander it. <span class="del">The farthest
                  they<br> ever go is to say some little biting<br> thing about the ultra

               — who has often has "nothing to wear;"<br> &amp; thus these widely separated
               types<br> of the sex meet upon common<br> ground. Yes, such is the Fan<br> woman,
               as she appears in her<br> simple, unostentatious every-<br>
                  day toilette. But on state<br> occasions she is more dressy.<br>
               <span class="del">much more dressy.</span> At a<br> banquet she <span class="del">wears</span>
               <span class="add">wears</span> bracelets; at<br> a lecture she wears

               ashes; at a wed-<br> ding the bride who can afford<br>
               it puts on pantaloons. Thus the<br> dark child of savagery &amp; the<br> fair
               daughter of civilization<br> meet once more upon com-<br>
                  mon ground; &amp; these two<br> touches of nature make<br> their whole
               world kin. </p><p id="Twa1Toad1e458"> Now we will consider<br> the dress of our other type. A<br> large part of the
               daughter of<br> civilization is her dress — as<br> it should be. Some civilized<br>
               <hr> women would lose half their<br> charm without dress;
               &amp; some<br> would lose all of it. The daughter<br> of modern civilization,
               dressed<br> at her utmost best, is a marvel<br> of exquisite &amp; beautiful art,
               &amp; ex-<br> pense. All the lands, all the climes,<br>
               &amp; all the arts are laid under tribute<br> to furnish her forth. Her linen<br>
               is from <span class="del"></span><span class="add">Belfast,</span> her robe is<br> from Paris, her lace is from<br> Venice, or
               Spain, or France;<br> her feathers are from the remote<br> regions of Southern

               <hr> her diamonds from Brazil,<br> her bracelets from
               California,<br> her pearls from Ceylon, her<br> cameos from Rome; she has<br>
               <span class="del">glass</span> gems &amp; trinkets
               from<br> buried Pompeii; &amp; others<br> that graced comely Egyptian<br> forms
               that have been dust &amp;<br> ashes, now, for forty centuries;<br> her watch is
               from Geneva, her<br> card-case is from China,<br> her hair is from — from
               — <span class="del">I</span><br>
               <span class="del">from the store, I believe. That</span><br>
               <span class="add">I don't know where her hair is from; I never</span>
               <br>
               <span class="add">could find out. That</span> is, her other hair
               — her public<br> hair, her Sunday hair; I don't<br> mean the hair she goes to
               bed with.<br>
               <hr> Why, you <span class="del">ought
                  to</span>
               <span class="add">ought to</span> know the hair<br> I mean; it's
               that thing which<br> she calls a switch, &amp; which<br> resembles a switch as<br>
               much as it resembles a<br> brickbat, or a shotgun,<br> or any other thing
               which<br> you correct people with.<br> It's that thing which she<br> twists, &amp;
               then coils round<br> &amp; round her head, beehive-<br>
                  fashion, &amp; then tucks the end<br> in under the hive &amp;
               harpoons<br> it with a hairpin. And that<br> reminds me of a trifle: any<br>
               <span class="del">time</span> time you want to, you<br>
               <hr>

               life can you<br> get any woman in that<br> car to acknowledge that<br> hairpin.
               Now isn't<br> that strange? But it's<br> true. The woman who<br> has never swerved
               from<br> cast-iron veracity &amp; fi-<br> delity in her
               whole life, will,<br> when confronted with this<br> crucial test, deny her hair-<br>
               <hr>
               pin. She will deny that<br> hairpin before a
               hundred<br> witnesses. I have <span class="add">stupidly</span>
               got<br> into more trouble, &amp; more<br> hot water trying to<br> hunt up the
               owner<br> of a hairpin in a<br> Pullman car than by<br> any other indiscre-<br> tion of my life. </p><hr><p id="Twa1Toad1e697"> Well, you can see what the daugh-<br> ter of

               <span class="del"></span>The toast includes<br> the sex, universally: it
               is to Woman,<br> comprehensively, wheresoever<br> she may be found. Let us con-<br> sider her ways. First, comes the<br> matter of
               dress. This is a most<br> important consideration, in a<br>
               <hr> subject of this nature, &amp; must<br> be disposed of
               before we can<br>
               <span class="add">intelligently</span> proceed to examine the
               profounder<br> depths of the theme. For text, let<br> us take the dress of two
               antipodal<br> types — the savage woman of<br>
               entral Africa, &amp; the cultivated<br> daughter of our
               high modern<br> civilization. Among the<br> Fans, a great negro tribe, a
               woman,<br> when dressed for <span class="del">breakfast, or</span><br>
               <span class="add">home, or to go to market, or go out</span><br>
               <span class="del">a pick-up dinner, or to sit at home,<br> or to go
                  out calling, or to a simple or to take a simple tea with<br>
                  friends &amp; neighbors, or to go out</span><br> calling, does not wear anything<br>
               <hr> at all but just her complexion.<br> That is all; that
               is her entire<br> outfit. It is the lightest cos-<br>
                  tume in the world, but is made<br> of the darkest material. It has<br>
               often been mistaken for mourning.<br> It is the trimmest, &amp; neatest, &amp; grace-<br> fulest costume that is now in<br> fashion;
               it wears well, is fast<br> colors, doesn't show dirt; you<br> don't have to send it
               down town<br> to wash, &amp; have some of it come<br> back scorched with the
               flat-iron, &amp;<br> some of it with the buttons ironed<br> off, &amp; some of it
               petrified with<br> starch, &amp; some of it chewed by the<br>
               <hr> calf, &amp; some of it rotted with<br> acids, &amp;
               some of it exchanged<br> for other customers' things that <span class="del"></span><br>
               <span class="add">haven't any virtue but holiness,</span><br>
               <span class="del"></span><span class="del">&amp; don't
                  fit you anyhow,</span><br> &amp; ten-twelfths of the pieces over-<br> charged for, &amp; the rest of the dozen<br>
               <span class="del">stolen</span><span class="add">"mislaid."</span> And it always fits; it is the<br> perfection of a fit. And it
               is the<br> handiest dress in the whole realm<br> of fashion. It is always ready,
                  <span class="add">always "done up."</span><br> When you call on a
               Fan lady &amp;<br> send up your card, the hired<br> girl never says, "Please
               take<br> a seat, madam is dressing — <br> she will be down in
               three-quarters<br> of an hour." No, madam is<br> always dressed, always ready<br>
               <hr> to receive; &amp; before you can get<br> the door-mat
               before your eyes, she<br> is in your midst. <span class="del">And the hired<br> girl never has to say to a lady<br> visitor,

               <span class="del"></span>The toast includes<br> the sex, universally: it
               is to Woman,<br> comprehensively, wheresoever<br> she may be found. Let us con-<br> sider her ways. First, comes the<br> matter of
               dress. This is a most<br> important consideration, in a<br>
               <hr> subject of this nature, &amp; must<br> be disposed of
               before we can<br>
               <span class="add">intelligently</span> proceed to examine the
               profounder<br> depths of the theme. For text, let<br> us take the dress of two
               antipodal<br> types — the savage woman of<br>
               entral Africa, &amp; the cultivated<br> daughter of our
               high modern<br> civilization. Among the<br> Fans, a great negro tribe, a
               woman,<br> when dressed for <span class="del">breakfast, or</span><br>
               <span class="add">home, or to go to market, or go out</span><br>
               <span class="del">a pick-up dinner, or to sit at home,<br> or to go
                  out calling, or to a simple or to take a simple tea with<br>
                  friends &amp; neighbors, or to go out</span><br> calling, does not wear anything<br>
               <hr> at all but just her complexion.<br> That is all; that
               is her entire<br> outfit. It is the lightest cos-<br>
                  tume in the world, but is made<br> of the darkest material. It has<br>
               often been mistaken for mourning.<br> It is the trimmest, &amp; neatest, &amp; grace-<br> fulest costume that is now in<br> fashion;
               it wears well, is fast<br> colors, doesn't show dirt; you<br> don't have to send it
               down town<br> to wash, &amp; have some of it come<br> back scorched with the
               flat-iron, &amp;<br> some of it with the buttons ironed<br> off, &amp; some of it
               petrified with<br> starch, &amp; some of it chewed by the<br>
               <hr> calf, &amp; some of it rotted with<br> acids, &amp;
               some of it exchanged<br> for other customers' things that <span class="del"></span><br>
               <span class="add">haven't any virtue but holiness,</span><br>
               <span class="del"></span><span class="del">&amp; don't
                  fit you anyhow,</span><br> &amp; ten-twelfths of the pieces over-<br> charged for, &amp; the rest of the dozen<br>
               <span class="del">stolen</span><span class="add">"mislaid."</span> And it always fits; it is the<br> perfection of a fit. And it
               is the<br> handiest dress in the whole realm<br> of fashion. It is always ready,
                  <span class="add">always "done up."</span><br> When you call on a
               Fan lady &amp;<br> send up your card, the hired<br> girl never says, "Please
               take<br> a seat, madam is dressing — <br> she will be down in
               three-quarters<br> of an hour." No, madam is<br> always dressed, always ready<br>
               <hr> to receive; &amp; before you can get<br> the door-mat
               before your eyes, she<br> is in your midst. <span class="del">And the hired<br> girl never has to say to a lady<br> visitor,
                     "Please excuse madam,<br> she is undressing;" &amp; even if<br> she ever had
                     to bring such an<br> excuse at all, she wouldn't say<br> it in that way: she
                     would say,<br> "Please excuse madam, she's skins,<br> not
                  herself!"</span> Then again, the<br> Fan ladies don't go to church
               to<br> see what each other has got on;<br> &amp; they don't go back home &amp;
               describe<br> it &amp; slander it. <span class="del">The farthest
                  they<br> ever go is to say some little biting<br> thing about the ultra
                  fashionables</span></p><hr><p id="Twa1Toad1e371"> Such is the dark child of<br> savagery, as to every-day<br> toilette; &amp; <span class="del"></span> thus, curiously<br> enough, she finds a point
               of<br> contact with the fair daughter<br> of civilization &amp; high fashion<br>
               — who has often has "nothing to wear;"<br> &amp; thus these widely separated
               types<br> of the sex meet upon common<br> ground. Yes, such is the Fan<br> woman,
               as she appears in her<br> simple, unostentatious every-<br>
                  day toilette. But on state<br> occasions she is more dressy.<br>
               <span class="del">much more dressy.</span> At a<br> banquet she <span class="del">wears</span>
               <span class="add">wears</span> bracelets; at<br> a lecture she wears
               earrings &amp; a<br> belt; at a ball she wears stockings — <br>
               <hr> &amp; with the true feminine fondness<br> for display,
               she wears them on her<br> arms; at a funeral she wears a<br> jacket of tar &amp;
               ashes; at a wed-<br> ding the bride who can afford<br>
               it puts on pantaloons. Thus the<br> dark child of savagery &amp; the<br> fair
               daughter of civilization<br> meet once more upon com-<br>
                  mon ground; &amp; these two<br> touches of nature make<br> their whole
               world kin. </p><p id="Twa1Toad1e458"> Now we will consider<br> the dress of our other type. A<br> large part of the
               daughter of<br> civilization is her dress — as<br> it should be. Some civilized<br>
               <hr> women would lose half their<br> charm without dress;
               &amp; some<br> would lose all of it. The daughter<br> of modern civilization,
               dressed<br> at her utmost best, is a marvel<br> of exquisite &amp; beautiful art,
               &amp; ex-<br> pense. All the lands, all the climes,<br>
               &amp; all the arts are laid under tribute<br> to furnish her forth. Her linen<br>
               is from <span class="del"></span><span class="add">Belfast,</span> her robe is<br> from Paris, her lace is from<br> Venice, or
               Spain, or France;<br> her feathers are from the remote<br> regions of Southern
               Africa,<br> her furs from the remoter<br> home of the iceberg &amp; the au-<br> rora; her fan from Japan,<br>
               <hr> her diamonds from Brazil,<br> her bracelets from
               California,<br> her pearls from Ceylon, her<br> cameos from Rome; she has<br>
               <span class="del">glass</span> gems &amp; trinkets
               from<br> buried Pompeii; &amp; others<br> that graced comely Egyptian<br> forms
               that have been dust &amp;<br> ashes, now, for forty centuries;<br> her watch is
               from Geneva, her<br> card-case is from China,<br> her hair is from — from
               — <span class="del">I</span><br>
               <span class="del">from the store, I believe. That</span><br>
               <span class="add">I don't know where her hair is from; I never</span>
               <br>
               <span class="add">could find out. That</span> is, her other hair
               — her public<br> hair, her Sunday hair; I don't<br> mean the hair she goes to
               bed with.<br>
               <hr> Why, you <span class="del">ought
                  to</span>
               <span class="add">ought to</span> know the hair<br> I mean; it's
               that thing which<br> she calls a switch, &amp; which<br> resembles a switch as<br>
               much as it resembles a<br> brickbat, or a shotgun,<br> or any other thing
               which<br> you correct people with.<br> It's that thing which she<br> twists, &amp;
               then coils round<br> &amp; round her head, beehive-<br>
                  fashion, &amp; then tucks the end<br> in under the hive &amp;
               harpoons<br> it with a hairpin. And that<br> reminds me of a trifle: any<br>
               <span class="del">time</span> time you want to, you<br>
               <hr>
               <span class="del"></span>can glance around the<br> carpet of a
               Pullman<br> car &amp; go &amp; pick up a<br> hairpin; but not to<br> save your
               life can you<br> get any woman in that<br> car to acknowledge that<br> hairpin.
               Now isn't<br> that strange? But it's<br> true. The woman who<br> has never swerved
               from<br> cast-iron veracity &amp; fi-<br> delity in her
               whole life, will,<br> when confronted with this<br> crucial test, deny her hair-<br>
               <hr>
               pin. She will deny that<br> hairpin before a
               hundred<br> witnesses. I have <span class="add">stupidly</span>
               got<br> into more trouble, &amp; more<br> hot water trying to<br> hunt up the
               owner<br> of a hairpin in a<br> Pullman car than by<br> any other indiscre-<br> tion of my life. </p><hr><p id="Twa1Toad1e697"> Well, you can see what the daugh-<br> ter of

               often been mistaken for mourning.<br> It is the trimmest, &amp; neatest, &amp; grace-<br> fulest costume that is now in<br> fashion;
               it wears well, is fast<br> colors, doesn't show dirt; you<br> don't have to send it
               down town<br> to wash, &amp; have some of it come<br> back scorched with the
               flat-iron, &amp;<br> some of it with the buttons ironed<br> off, &amp; some of it
               petrified with<br> starch, &amp; some of it chewed by the<br>
               <hr> calf, &amp; some of it rotted with<br> acids, &amp;
               some of it exchanged<br> for other customers' things that <span class="del"></span><br>

               <span class="del">stolen</span><span class="add">"mislaid."</span> And it always fits; it is the<br> perfection of a fit. And it
               is the<br> handiest dress in the whole realm<br> of fashion. It is always ready,
                  <span class="add">always "done up."</span><br> When you call on a
               Fan lady &amp;<br> send up your card, the hired<br> girl never says, "Please
               take<br> a seat, madam is dressing — <br> she will be down in
               three-quarters<br> of an hour." No, madam is<br> always dressed, always ready<br>
               <hr> to receive; &amp; before you can get<br> the door-mat
               before your eyes, she<br> is in your midst. <span class="del">And the hired<br> girl never has to say to a lady<br> visitor,
                     "Please excuse madam,<br> she is undressing;" &amp; even if<br> she ever had
                     to bring such an<br> excuse at all, she wouldn't say<br> it in that way: she
                     would say,<br> "Please excuse madam, she's skins,<br> not
                  herself!"</span> Then again, the<br> Fan ladies don't go to church
               to<br> see what each other has got on;<br> &amp; they don't go back home &amp;
               describe<br> it &amp; slander it. <span class="del">The farthest
                  they<br> ever go is to say some little biting<br> thing about the ultra
                  fashionables</span></p><hr><p id="Twa1Toad1e371"> Such is the dark child of<br> savagery, as to every-day<br> toilette; &amp; <span class="del"></span> thus, curiously<br> enough, she finds a point

               — who has often has "nothing to wear;"<br> &amp; thus these widely separated
               types<br> of the sex meet upon common<br> ground. Yes, such is the Fan<br> woman,
               as she appears in her<br> simple, unostentatious every-<br>
                  day toilette. But on state<br> occasions she is more dressy.<br>
               <span class="del">much more dressy.</span> At a<br> banquet she <span class="del">wears</span>
               <span class="add">wears</span> bracelets; at<br> a lecture she wears

               <hr> &amp; with the true feminine fondness<br> for display,
               she wears them on her<br> arms; at a funeral she wears a<br> jacket of tar &amp;
               ashes; at a wed-<br> ding the bride who can afford<br>
               it puts on pantaloons. Thus the<br> dark child of savagery &amp; the<br> fair
               daughter of civilization<br> meet once more upon com-<br>
                  mon ground; &amp; these two<br> touches of nature make<br> their whole
               world kin. </p><p id="Twa1Toad1e458"> Now we will consider<br> the dress of our other type. A<br> large part of the
               daughter of<br> civilization is her dress — as<br> it should be. Some civilized<br>
               <hr> women would lose half their<br> charm without dress;
               &amp; some<br> would lose all of it. The daughter<br> of modern civilization,
               dressed<br> at her utmost best, is a marvel<br> of exquisite &amp; beautiful art,
               &amp; ex-<br> pense. All the lands, all the climes,<br>
               &amp; all the arts are laid under tribute<br> to furnish her forth. Her linen<br>
               is from <span class="del"></span><span class="add">Belfast,</span> her robe is<br> from Paris, her lace is from<br> Venice, or
               Spain, or France;<br> her feathers are from the remote<br> regions of Southern
               Africa,<br> her furs from the remoter<br> home of the iceberg &amp; the au-<br> rora; her fan from Japan,<br>
               <hr> her diamonds from Brazil,<br> her bracelets from
               California,<br> her pearls from Ceylon, her<br> cameos from Rome; she has<br>
               <span class="del">glass</span> gems &amp; trinkets
               from<br> buried Pompeii; &amp; others<br> that graced comely Egyptian<br> forms
               that have been dust &amp;<br> ashes, now, for forty centuries;<br> her watch is
               from Geneva, her<br> card-case is from China,<br> her hair is from — from
               — <span class="del">I</span><br>
               <span class="del">from the store, I believe. That</span><br>
               <span class="add">I don't know where her hair is from; I never</span>
               <br>
               <span class="add">could find out. That</span> is, her other hair
               — her public<br> hair, her Sunday hair; I don't<br> mean the hair she goes to
               bed with.<br>
               <hr> Why, you <span class="del">ought
                  to</span>
               <span class="add">ought to</span> know the hair<br> I mean; it's
               that thing which<br> she calls a switch, &amp; which<br> resembles a switch as<br>
               much as it resembles a<br> brickbat, or a shotgun,<br> or any other thing
               which<br> you correct people with.<br> It's that thing which she<br> twists, &amp;
               then coils round<br> &amp; round her head, beehive-<br>
                  fashion, &amp; then tucks the end<br> in under the hive &amp;
               harpoons<br> it with a hairpin. And that<br> reminds me of a trifle: any<br>
               <span class="del">time</span> time you want to, you<br>
               <hr>
               <span class="del"></span>can glance around the<br> carpet of a
               Pullman<br> car &amp; go &amp; pick up a<br> hairpin; but not to<br> save your
               life can you<br> get any woman in that<br> car to acknowledge that<br> hairpin.
               Now isn't<br> that strange? But it's<br> true. The woman who<br> has never swerved
               from<br> cast-iron veracity &amp; fi-<br> delity in her
               whole life, will,<br> when confronted with this<br> crucial test, deny her hair-<br>
               <hr>
               pin. She will deny that<br> hairpin before a
               hundred<br> witnesses. I have <span class="add">stupidly</span>
               got<br> into more trouble, &amp; more<br> hot water trying to<br> hunt up the
               owner<br> of a hairpin in a<br> Pullman car than by<br> any other indiscre-<br> tion of my life. </p><hr><p id="Twa1Toad1e697"> Well, you can see what the daugh-<br> ter of

               dress. This is a most<br> important consideration, in a<br>
               <hr> subject of this nature, &amp; must<br> be disposed of

               antipodal<br> types — the savage woman of<br>
               entral Africa, &amp; the cultivated<br> daughter of our
               high modern<br> civilization. Among the<br> Fans, a great negro tribe, a

               <hr> Why, you <span class="del">ought

               much as it resembles a<br> brickbat, or a shotgun,<br> or any other thing
               which<br> you correct people with.<br> It's that thing which she<br> twists, &amp;
               then coils round<br> &amp; round her head, beehive-<br>
                  fashion, &amp; then tucks the end<br> in under the hive &amp;
               harpoons<br> it with a hairpin. And that<br> reminds me of a trifle: any<br>
               <span class="del">time</span> time you want to, you<br>
               <hr>

               life can you<br> get any woman in that<br> car to acknowledge that<br> hairpin.
               Now isn't<br> that strange? But it's<br> true. The woman who<br> has never swerved
               from<br> cast-iron veracity &amp; fi-<br> delity in her
               whole life, will,<br> when confronted with this<br> crucial test, deny her hair-<br>
               <hr>
               pin. She will deny that<br> hairpin before a
               hundred<br> witnesses. I have <span class="add">stupidly</span>
               got<br> into more trouble, &amp; more<br> hot water trying to<br> hunt up the
               owner<br> of a hairpin in a<br> Pullman car than by<br> any other indiscre-<br> tion of my life. </p><hr><p id="Twa1Toad1e697"> Well, you can see what the daugh-<br> ter of

               <br> Woman — God bless her. <p id="Twa1Toad1e153">
               <span class="del"></span>The toast includes<br> the sex, universally: it
               is to Woman,<br> comprehensively, wheresoever<br> she may be found. Let us con-<br> sider her ways. First, comes the<br> matter of
               dress. This is a most<br> important consideration, in a<br>
               <hr> subject of this nature, &amp; must<br> be disposed of
               before we can<br>
               <span class="add">intelligently</span> proceed to examine the
               profounder<br> depths of the theme. For text, let<br> us take the dress of two
               antipodal<br> types — the savage woman of<br>
               entral Africa, &amp; the cultivated<br> daughter of our
               high modern<br> civilization. Among the<br> Fans, a great negro tribe, a
               woman,<br> when dressed for <span class="del">breakfast, or</span><br>
               <span class="add">home, or to go to market, or go out</span><br>
               <span class="del">a pick-up dinner, or to sit at home,<br> or to go
                  out calling, or to a simple or to take a simple tea with<br>
                  friends &amp; neighbors, or to go out</span><br> calling, does not wear anything<br>
               <hr> at all but just her complexion.<br> That is all; that
               is her entire<br> outfit. It is the lightest cos-<br>
                  tume in the world, but is made<br> of the darkest material. It has<br>
               often been mistaken for mourning.<br> It is the trimmest, &amp; neatest, &amp; grace-<br> fulest costume that is now in<br> fashion;
               it wears well, is fast<br> colors, doesn't show dirt; you<br> don't have to send it
               down town<br> to wash, &amp; have some of it come<br> back scorched with the
               flat-iron, &amp;<br> some of it with the buttons ironed<br> off, &amp; some of it
               petrified with<br> starch, &amp; some of it chewed by the<br>
               <hr> calf, &amp; some of it rotted with<br> acids, &amp;
               some of it exchanged<br> for other customers' things that <span class="del"></span><br>
               <span class="add">haven't any virtue but holiness,</span><br>
               <span class="del"></span><span class="del">&amp; don't
                  fit you anyhow,</span><br> &amp; ten-twelfths of the pieces over-<br> charged for, &amp; the rest of the dozen<br>
               <span class="del">stolen</span><span class="add">"mislaid."</span> And it always fits; it is the<br> perfection of a fit. And it
               is the<br> handiest dress in the whole realm<br> of fashion. It is always ready,
                  <span class="add">always "done up."</span><br> When you call on a
               Fan lady &amp;<br> send up your card, the hired<br> girl never says, "Please
               take<br> a seat, madam is dressing — <br> she will be down in
               three-quarters<br> of an hour." No, madam is<br> always dressed, always ready<br>
               <hr> to receive; &amp; before you can get<br> the door-mat
               before your eyes, she<br> is in your midst. <span class="del">And the hired<br> girl never has to say to a lady<br> visitor,
                     "Please excuse madam,<br> she is undressing;" &amp; even if<br> she ever had
                     to bring such an<br> excuse at all, she wouldn't say<br> it in that way: she
                     would say,<br> "Please excuse madam, she's skins,<br> not
                  herself!"</span> Then again, the<br> Fan ladies don't go to church
               to<br> see what each other has got on;<br> &amp; they don't go back home &amp;
               describe<br> it &amp; slander it. <span class="del">The farthest
                  they<br> ever go is to say some little biting<br> thing about the ultra
                  fashionables</span></p><hr><p id="Twa1Toad1e371"> Such is the dark child of<br> savagery, as to every-day<br> toilette; &amp; <span class="del"></span> thus, curiously<br> enough, she finds a point
               of<br> contact with the fair daughter<br> of civilization &amp; high fashion<br>
               — who has often has "nothing to wear;"<br> &amp; thus these widely separated
               types<br> of the sex meet upon common<br> ground. Yes, such is the Fan<br> woman,
               as she appears in her<br> simple, unostentatious every-<br>
                  day toilette. But on state<br> occasions she is more dressy.<br>
               <span class="del">much more dressy.</span> At a<br> banquet she <span class="del">wears</span>
               <span class="add">wears</span> bracelets; at<br> a lecture she wears
               earrings &amp; a<br> belt; at a ball she wears stockings — <br>
               <hr> &amp; with the true feminine fondness<br> for display,
               she wears them on her<br> arms; at a funeral she wears a<br> jacket of tar &amp;
               ashes; at a wed-<br> ding the bride who can afford<br>
               it puts on pantaloons. Thus the<br> dark child of savagery &amp; the<br> fair
               daughter of civilization<br> meet once more upon com-<br>
                  mon ground; &amp; these two<br> touches of nature make<br> their whole
               world kin. </p><p id="Twa1Toad1e458"> Now we will consider<br> the dress of our other type. A<br> large part of the
               daughter of<br> civilization is her dress — as<br> it should be. Some civilized<br>
               <hr> women would lose half their<br> charm without dress;
               &amp; some<br> would lose all of it. The daughter<br> of modern civilization,
               dressed<br> at her utmost best, is a marvel<br> of exquisite &amp; beautiful art,
               &amp; ex-<br> pense. All the lands, all the climes,<br>
               &amp; all the arts are laid under tribute<br> to furnish her forth. Her linen<br>
               is from <span class="del"></span><span class="add">Belfast,</span> her robe is<br> from Paris, her lace is from<br> Venice, or
               Spain, or France;<br> her feathers are from the remote<br> regions of Southern
               Africa,<br> her furs from the remoter<br> home of the iceberg &amp; the au-<br> rora; her fan from Japan,<br>
               <hr> her diamonds from Brazil,<br> her bracelets from
               California,<br> her pearls from Ceylon, her<br> cameos from Rome; she has<br>
               <span class="del">glass</span> gems &amp; trinkets
               from<br> buried Pompeii; &amp; others<br> that graced comely Egyptian<br> forms
               that have been dust &amp;<br> ashes, now, for forty centuries;<br> her watch is
               from Geneva, her<br> card-case is from China,<br> her hair is from — from
               — <span class="del">I</span><br>
               <span class="del">from the store, I believe. That</span><br>
               <span class="add">I don't know where her hair is from; I never</span>
               <br>
               <span class="add">could find out. That</span> is, her other hair
               — her public<br> hair, her Sunday hair; I don't<br> mean the hair she goes to

               <span class="add">ought to</span> know the hair<br> I mean; it's
               that thing which<br> she calls a switch, &amp; which<br> resembles a switch as<br>

               <br> Woman — God bless her. <p id="Twa1Toad1e153">
               <span class="del"></span>The toast includes<br> the sex, universally: it
               is to Woman,<br> comprehensively, wheresoever<br> she may be found. Let us con-<br> sider her ways. First, comes the<br> matter of
               dress. This is a most<br> important consideration, in a<br>
               <hr> subject of this nature, &amp; must<br> be disposed of
               before we can<br>
               <span class="add">intelligently</span> proceed to examine the
               profounder<br> depths of the theme. For text, let<br> us take the dress of two
               antipodal<br> types — the savage woman of<br>
               entral Africa, &amp; the cultivated<br> daughter of our
               high modern<br> civilization. Among the<br> Fans, a great negro tribe, a
               woman,<br> when dressed for <span class="del">breakfast, or</span><br>
               <span class="add">home, or to go to market, or go out</span><br>
               <span class="del">a pick-up dinner, or to sit at home,<br> or to go
                  out calling, or to a simple or to take a simple tea with<br>
                  friends &amp; neighbors, or to go out</span><br> calling, does not wear anything<br>
               <hr> at all but just her complexion.<br> That is all; that
               is her entire<br> outfit. It is the lightest cos-<br>
                  tume in the world, but is made<br> of the darkest material. It has<br>
               often been mistaken for mourning.<br> It is the trimmest, &amp; neatest, &amp; grace-<br> fulest costume that is now in<br> fashion;
               it wears well, is fast<br> colors, doesn't show dirt; you<br> don't have to send it
               down town<br> to wash, &amp; have some of it come<br> back scorched with the
               flat-iron, &amp;<br> some of it with the buttons ironed<br> off, &amp; some of it
               petrified with<br> starch, &amp; some of it chewed by the<br>
               <hr> calf, &amp; some of it rotted with<br> acids, &amp;
               some of it exchanged<br> for other customers' things that <span class="del"></span><br>
               <span class="add">haven't any virtue but holiness,</span><br>
               <span class="del"></span><span class="del">&amp; don't
                  fit you anyhow,</span><br> &amp; ten-twelfths of the pieces over-<br> charged for, &amp; the rest of the dozen<br>
               <span class="del">stolen</span><span class="add">"mislaid."</span> And it always fits; it is the<br> perfection of a fit. And it
               is the<br> handiest dress in the whole realm<br> of fashion. It is always ready,
                  <span class="add">always "done up."</span><br> When you call on a
               Fan lady &amp;<br> send up your card, the hired<br> girl never says, "Please
               take<br> a seat, madam is dressing — <br> she will be down in
               three-quarters<br> of an hour." No, madam is<br> always dressed, always ready<br>
               <hr> to receive; &amp; before you can get<br> the door-mat
               before your eyes, she<br> is in your midst. <span class="del">And the hired<br> girl never has to say to a lady<br> visitor,
                     "Please excuse madam,<br> she is undressing;" &amp; even if<br> she ever had
                     to bring such an<br> excuse at all, she wouldn't say<br> it in that way: she
                     would say,<br> "Please excuse madam, she's skins,<br> not
                  herself!"</span> Then again, the<br> Fan ladies don't go to church
               to<br> see what each other has got on;<br> &amp; they don't go back home &amp;
               describe<br> it &amp; slander it. <span class="del">The farthest
                  they<br> ever go is to say some little biting<br> thing about the ultra
                  fashionables</span></p><hr><p id="Twa1Toad1e371"> Such is the dark child of<br> savagery, as to every-day<br> toilette; &amp; <span class="del"></span> thus, curiously<br> enough, she finds a point
               of<br> contact with the fair daughter<br> of civilization &amp; high fashion<br>
               — who has often has "nothing to wear;"<br> &amp; thus these widely separated
               types<br> of the sex meet upon common<br> ground. Yes, such is the Fan<br> woman,
               as she appears in her<br> simple, unostentatious every-<br>
                  day toilette. But on state<br> occasions she is more dressy.<br>
               <span class="del">much more dressy.</span> At a<br> banquet she <span class="del">wears</span>
               <span class="add">wears</span> bracelets; at<br> a lecture she wears
               earrings &amp; a<br> belt; at a ball she wears stockings — <br>
               <hr> &amp; with the true feminine fondness<br> for display,
               she wears them on her<br> arms; at a funeral she wears a<br> jacket of tar &amp;
               ashes; at a wed-<br> ding the bride who can afford<br>
               it puts on pantaloons. Thus the<br> dark child of savagery &amp; the<br> fair
               daughter of civilization<br> meet once more upon com-<br>
                  mon ground; &amp; these two<br> touches of nature make<br> their whole
               world kin. </p><p id="Twa1Toad1e458"> Now we will consider<br> the dress of our other type. A<br> large part of the
               daughter of<br> civilization is her dress — as<br> it should be. Some civilized<br>
               <hr> women would lose half their<br> charm without dress;
               &amp; some<br> would lose all of it. The daughter<br> of modern civilization,
               dressed<br> at her utmost best, is a marvel<br> of exquisite &amp; beautiful art,
               &amp; ex-<br> pense. All the lands, all the climes,<br>
               &amp; all the arts are laid under tribute<br> to furnish her forth. Her linen<br>
               is from <span class="del"></span><span class="add">Belfast,</span> her robe is<br> from Paris, her lace is from<br> Venice, or
               Spain, or France;<br> her feathers are from the remote<br> regions of Southern
               Africa,<br> her furs from the remoter<br> home of the iceberg &amp; the au-<br> rora; her fan from Japan,<br>
               <hr> her diamonds from Brazil,<br> her bracelets from
               California,<br> her pearls from Ceylon, her<br> cameos from Rome; she has<br>
               <span class="del">glass</span> gems &amp; trinkets
               from<br> buried Pompeii; &amp; others<br> that graced comely Egyptian<br> forms
               that have been dust &amp;<br> ashes, now, for forty centuries;<br> her watch is
               from Geneva, her<br> card-case is from China,<br> her hair is from — from
               — <span class="del">I</span><br>
               <span class="del">from the store, I believe. That</span><br>
               <span class="add">I don't know where her hair is from; I never</span>
               <br>
               <span class="add">could find out. That</span> is, her other hair
               — her public<br> hair, her Sunday hair; I don't<br> mean the hair she goes to
               bed with.<br>
               <hr> Why, you <span class="del">ought
                  to</span>
               <span class="add">ought to</span> know the hair<br> I mean; it's
               that thing which<br> she calls a switch, &amp; which<br> resembles a switch as<br>
               much as it resembles a<br> brickbat, or a shotgun,<br> or any other thing
               which<br> you correct people with.<br> It's that thing which she<br> twists, &amp;
               then coils round<br> &amp; round her head, beehive-<br>
                  fashion, &amp; then tucks the end<br> in under the hive &amp;
               harpoons<br> it with a hairpin. And that<br> reminds me of a trifle: any<br>
               <span class="del">time</span> time you want to, you<br>
               <hr>
               <span class="del"></span>can glance around the<br> carpet of a
               Pullman<br> car &amp; go &amp; pick up a<br> hairpin; but not to<br> save your
               life can you<br> get any woman in that<br> car to acknowledge that<br> hairpin.
               Now isn't<br> that strange? But it's<br> true. The woman who<br> has never swerved
               from<br> cast-iron veracity &amp; fi-<br> delity in her
               whole life, will,<br> when confronted with this<br> crucial test, deny her hair-<br>
               <hr>
               pin. She will deny that<br> hairpin before a
               hundred<br> witnesses. I have <span class="add">stupidly</span>
               got<br> into more trouble, &amp; more<br> hot water trying to<br> hunt up the
               owner<br> of a hairpin in a<br> Pullman car than by<br> any other indiscre-<br> tion of my life. </p><hr><p id="Twa1Toad1e697"> Well, you can see what the daugh-<br> ter of
               civilization is, when she<br> is dressed; &amp; you have seen what<br> the daughter
               of savagery is<br> when she isn't. Such is Woman,<br> as to costume. I come,
               now,<br> to consider her in her higher &amp;<br> nobler aspects — as <span class="del">sister,</span> mother, <span class="del">sweetheart,</span>
               <span class="del"><span class="add">sister,
                     daughter</span></span> wife, widow,<br>

               <span class="add">grass-widow,</span>
               mother-<br> in-law,
               <span class="del">woman's-rights skir-<br>

               <span class="del"></span> hired girl, tele-<br>
                  graph operator, telephone helloer,<br>
               <span class="del">store clerk, washer-woman, school-<br> marm, queen,</span>
               <span class="add">queen,</span> book-agent, wet-<br>

                  fessional double-headed<br> woman, professional beauty,<br> &amp; so
               forth &amp; so on. </p><p id="Twa1Toad1e795"> We will simply discuss<br> these few — let the rest of the<br> sex <span class="del">wait</span>
               <span class="add">tarry in Jericho till we come again.</span> First
               in the list, of<br> right, &amp; first in <hr> our
               gratitude, comes a woman <span class="add">who — </span>
               <span class="add">why,</span><br>
               <span class="del">without whom, I ask you, where<br> would be those
                  priceless treasures<br> without which are all that make<br> our lives worth the
                  living. Yes,<br> where would be our wives &amp; chil-<br>
                     dren if there hadn't been any<br> mother-in-law? She — why,</span>
               <span class="del"></span>
               <span class="add">dear me, I've been talking three-quarters of
                  an<br> hour!</span> I beg a thousand pardons. But<br> you see, yourselves, that I
               had a<br> large contract. I have accom-<br> plished
               something, anyway: I<br> have introduced my subject; &amp; if I<br> had till next
