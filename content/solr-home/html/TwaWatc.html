                </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e147"> MY beautiful new watch had run eighteen months without losing or gaining, and
                    without breaking any part of its machinery or stopping. I had come to believe it
                    infallible in its judgments about the time of day, and to consider its
                    constitution and its anatomy imperishable. But at last, one night, I let it run
                    down. I grieved about it as if it were a recognized messenger and forerunner of
                    calamity. But by and by I cheered up, set the watch by guess, and commanded my
                    bodings and superstitions to depart. Next day I stepped into the chief jeweler's
                    to set it by the exact </p><hr><p id="TwaWatcd1e150">

                </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e154"> time, and the head of the establishment took it out of my hand and proceeded to
                    set it for me. Then he said, "She is four minutes slow — regulator wants
                    pushing up." I tried to stop him — tried to make him understand that the
                    watch kept perfect time. But no; all this human cabbage could see was that the
                    watch was four minutes slow, and the regulator <i>must</i> be
                    pushed up a little; and so, while I danced around him in anguish, and implored
                    him to let the watch alone, he calmly and cruelly did the shameful deed. My
                    watch began to gain. It gained faster and faster day by day. Within the week it
                    sickened to a raging fever, and its pulse went up to a hundred and fifty in the
                    shade. At the end of two months it had left all the timepieces of the town far
                    in the rear, and was a fraction over thirteen days ahead of the almanac. It was
                    away into November enjoying the snow, while the October leaves were still
                    turning. It hurried up house rent, bills payable, and such things, in such a
                    ruinous way that I could not abide it. I took it to the watchmaker to be
                    regulated. He asked me if I had ever had it repaired. I said no, it had never
                    needed any repairing. He looked a look of vicious happiness and eagerly pried
                    the watch open, and then put a small dice box into his eye and peered into its
                    machinery. He said it wanted cleaning and oiling, besides regulating —
                    come in a week. After being cleaned and oiled, and regulated, my watch slowed
                    down to that degree that it ticked like a tolling bell. I began to be left by
                    trains, I failed all appointments, I got to missing my dinner; my watch strung
                    out three days' grace to four and let me go to protest; I gradually drifted back
                    into yesterday, then day before, then into last week, and by and by the
                    comprehension came upon me that all solitary and alone I was lingering along in
                    week before last, and the </p><hr><p id="TwaWatcd1e160">

                </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e164"> world was out of sight. I seemed to detect in myself a sort of sneaking
                    fellow-feeling for the mummy in the museum, and desire to swap news with him. I
                    went to a watch maker again. He took the watch all to pieces while I waited, and
                    then said the barrel was "swelled." He said he could reduce it in three days.
                    After this the watch <i>averaged</i> well, but nothing more. For
                    half a day it would go like the very mischief, and keep up such a barking and
                    wheezing and whooping and sneezing and snorting, that I could not hear myself
                    think for the disturbance; and as long as it held out there was not a watch in
                    the land that stood any chance against it. But the rest of the day it would keep
                    on slowing down and fooling along until all the clocks it had left behind caught
                    up again. So at last, at the end of twenty-four hours, it would trot up to the
                    judges' stand all right and just in time. It would show a fair and square
                    average, and no man could say it had done more or less than its duty. But a
                    correct average is only a mild virtue in a watch, and I took this instrument to
                    another watchmaker. He said the kingbolt was broken. I said I was glad it was
                    nothing more serious. To tell the plain truth, I had no idea what the kingbolt
                    was, but I did not choose to appear ignorant to a stranger. He repaired the
                    kingbolt, but what the watch gained in one way it lost in another. It would run
                    awhile and then stop awhile, and then run awhile again, and so on, using its own
                    discretion about the intervals. And every time it went off it kicked back like a
                    musket. I padded my breast for a few days, but finally took the watch to another
                    watchmaker. He picked it all to pieces, and turned the ruin over and over under
                    his glass; and then he said there appeared to be something the matter with the
                    hair-trigger. He <hr> fixed it, and gave it a fresh start. It did well
                    now, except that always at ten minutes to ten the hands would shut together like
                    a pair of scissors, and from that time forth they would travel together. The
                    oldest man in the world could not make head or tail of the time of day by such a
                    watch, and so I went again to have the thing repaired. This person said that the
                    crystal had got bent, and that the mainspring was not straight. He also remarked
                    that part of the works needed half-soling. He made these things all right, and
                    then my timepiece performed unexceptionably, save that now and then, after
                    working along quietly for nearly eight hours, everything inside would let go all
                    of a sudden and begin to buzz like a bee, and the hands would straightway begin
                    to spin round and round so fast that their individuality was lost completely,
                    and they simply seemed a delicate spider's web over the face of the watch. She
                    would reel off the next twenty-four hours in six or seven minutes, and then stop
                    with a bang. I went with a heavy heart to one more watchmaker, and looked on
                    while he took her to pieces. Then I prepared to cross-question him rigidly, for
                    this thing was getting serious. The watch had cost two hundred dollars
                    originally, and I seemed to have paid out two or three thousand for repairs.
                    While I waited and looked on I presently recognized in this watchmaker an old
                    acquaintance — a steamboat engineer of other days, and not a good
                    engineer, either. He examined all the parts carefully, just as the other
                    watchmakers had done, and then delivered his verdict with the same confidence of
                    manner. </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e171"> He said: </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e174"> "She makes too much steam — you want to hang the monkey-wrench on the

                    the repairers got a chance at it. And he used to wonder what became of all the
                    unsuccessful tinkers, and gunsmiths, and shoemakers, and engineers, and
                    blacksmiths; but nobody could ever tell him. </p></div></div></div>

                    in the rear, and was a fraction over thirteen days ahead of the almanac. It was
                    away into November enjoying the snow, while the October leaves were still
                    turning. It hurried up house rent, bills payable, and such things, in such a
                    ruinous way that I could not abide it. I took it to the watchmaker to be
                    regulated. He asked me if I had ever had it repaired. I said no, it had never
                    needed any repairing. He looked a look of vicious happiness and eagerly pried
                    the watch open, and then put a small dice box into his eye and peered into its
                    machinery. He said it wanted cleaning and oiling, besides regulating —
                    come in a week. After being cleaned and oiled, and regulated, my watch slowed
                    down to that degree that it ticked like a tolling bell. I began to be left by
                    trains, I failed all appointments, I got to missing my dinner; my watch strung
                    out three days' grace to four and let me go to protest; I gradually drifted back
                    into yesterday, then day before, then into last week, and by and by the
                    comprehension came upon me that all solitary and alone I was lingering along in
                    week before last, and the </p><hr><p id="TwaWatcd1e160">

                </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e164"> world was out of sight. I seemed to detect in myself a sort of sneaking
                    fellow-feeling for the mummy in the museum, and desire to swap news with him. I
                    went to a watch maker again. He took the watch all to pieces while I waited, and
                    then said the barrel was "swelled." He said he could reduce it in three days.
                    After this the watch <i>averaged</i> well, but nothing more. For
                    half a day it would go like the very mischief, and keep up such a barking and
                    wheezing and whooping and sneezing and snorting, that I could not hear myself
                    think for the disturbance; and as long as it held out there was not a watch in
                    the land that stood any chance against it. But the rest of the day it would keep
                    on slowing down and fooling along until all the clocks it had left behind caught
                    up again. So at last, at the end of twenty-four hours, it would trot up to the
                    judges' stand all right and just in time. It would show a fair and square
                    average, and no man could say it had done more or less than its duty. But a
                    correct average is only a mild virtue in a watch, and I took this instrument to
                    another watchmaker. He said the kingbolt was broken. I said I was glad it was
                    nothing more serious. To tell the plain truth, I had no idea what the kingbolt
                    was, but I did not choose to appear ignorant to a stranger. He repaired the
                    kingbolt, but what the watch gained in one way it lost in another. It would run
                    awhile and then stop awhile, and then run awhile again, and so on, using its own
                    discretion about the intervals. And every time it went off it kicked back like a
                    musket. I padded my breast for a few days, but finally took the watch to another
                    watchmaker. He picked it all to pieces, and turned the ruin over and over under
                    his glass; and then he said there appeared to be something the matter with the
                    hair-trigger. He <hr> fixed it, and gave it a fresh start. It did well
                    now, except that always at ten minutes to ten the hands would shut together like
                    a pair of scissors, and from that time forth they would travel together. The
                    oldest man in the world could not make head or tail of the time of day by such a
                    watch, and so I went again to have the thing repaired. This person said that the
                    crystal had got bent, and that the mainspring was not straight. He also remarked
                    that part of the works needed half-soling. He made these things all right, and
                    then my timepiece performed unexceptionably, save that now and then, after
                    working along quietly for nearly eight hours, everything inside would let go all
                    of a sudden and begin to buzz like a bee, and the hands would straightway begin
                    to spin round and round so fast that their individuality was lost completely,
                    and they simply seemed a delicate spider's web over the face of the watch. She
                    would reel off the next twenty-four hours in six or seven minutes, and then stop
                    with a bang. I went with a heavy heart to one more watchmaker, and looked on
                    while he took her to pieces. Then I prepared to cross-question him rigidly, for
                    this thing was getting serious. The watch had cost two hundred dollars
                    originally, and I seemed to have paid out two or three thousand for repairs.
                    While I waited and looked on I presently recognized in this watchmaker an old
                    acquaintance — a steamboat engineer of other days, and not a good
                    engineer, either. He examined all the parts carefully, just as the other
                    watchmakers had done, and then delivered his verdict with the same confidence of
                    manner. </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e171"> He said: </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e174"> "She makes too much steam — you want to hang the monkey-wrench on the

                    the repairers got a chance at it. And he used to wonder what became of all the
                    unsuccessful tinkers, and gunsmiths, and shoemakers, and engineers, and
                    blacksmiths; but nobody could ever tell him. </p></div></div></div>

                    without breaking any part of its machinery or stopping. I had come to believe it
                    infallible in its judgments about the time of day, and to consider its
                    constitution and its anatomy imperishable. But at last, one night, I let it run
                    down. I grieved about it as if it were a recognized messenger and forerunner of
                    calamity. But by and by I cheered up, set the watch by guess, and commanded my
                    bodings and superstitions to depart. Next day I stepped into the chief jeweler's
                    to set it by the exact </p><hr><p id="TwaWatcd1e150">

                    set it for me. Then he said, "She is four minutes slow — regulator wants
                    pushing up." I tried to stop him — tried to make him understand that the
                    watch kept perfect time. But no; all this human cabbage could see was that the
                    watch was four minutes slow, and the regulator <i>must</i> be
                    pushed up a little; and so, while I danced around him in anguish, and implored
                    him to let the watch alone, he calmly and cruelly did the shameful deed. My
                    watch began to gain. It gained faster and faster day by day. Within the week it
                    sickened to a raging fever, and its pulse went up to a hundred and fifty in the
                    shade. At the end of two months it had left all the timepieces of the town far

                    wheezing and whooping and sneezing and snorting, that I could not hear myself
                    think for the disturbance; and as long as it held out there was not a watch in
                    the land that stood any chance against it. But the rest of the day it would keep
                    on slowing down and fooling along until all the clocks it had left behind caught
                    up again. So at last, at the end of twenty-four hours, it would trot up to the
                    judges' stand all right and just in time. It would show a fair and square
                    average, and no man could say it had done more or less than its duty. But a
                    correct average is only a mild virtue in a watch, and I took this instrument to
                    another watchmaker. He said the kingbolt was broken. I said I was glad it was
                    nothing more serious. To tell the plain truth, I had no idea what the kingbolt
                    was, but I did not choose to appear ignorant to a stranger. He repaired the
                    kingbolt, but what the watch gained in one way it lost in another. It would run
                    awhile and then stop awhile, and then run awhile again, and so on, using its own
                    discretion about the intervals. And every time it went off it kicked back like a
                    musket. I padded my breast for a few days, but finally took the watch to another
                    watchmaker. He picked it all to pieces, and turned the ruin over and over under
                    his glass; and then he said there appeared to be something the matter with the
                    hair-trigger. He <hr> fixed it, and gave it a fresh start. It did well
                    now, except that always at ten minutes to ten the hands would shut together like
                    a pair of scissors, and from that time forth they would travel together. The
                    oldest man in the world could not make head or tail of the time of day by such a
                    watch, and so I went again to have the thing repaired. This person said that the
                    crystal had got bent, and that the mainspring was not straight. He also remarked
                    that part of the works needed half-soling. He made these things all right, and
                    then my timepiece performed unexceptionably, save that now and then, after
                    working along quietly for nearly eight hours, everything inside would let go all
                    of a sudden and begin to buzz like a bee, and the hands would straightway begin
                    to spin round and round so fast that their individuality was lost completely,
                    and they simply seemed a delicate spider's web over the face of the watch. She
                    would reel off the next twenty-four hours in six or seven minutes, and then stop
                    with a bang. I went with a heavy heart to one more watchmaker, and looked on
                    while he took her to pieces. Then I prepared to cross-question him rigidly, for
                    this thing was getting serious. The watch had cost two hundred dollars
                    originally, and I seemed to have paid out two or three thousand for repairs.
                    While I waited and looked on I presently recognized in this watchmaker an old
                    acquaintance — a steamboat engineer of other days, and not a good
                    engineer, either. He examined all the parts carefully, just as the other
                    watchmakers had done, and then delivered his verdict with the same confidence of
                    manner. </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e171"> He said: </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e174"> "She makes too much steam — you want to hang the monkey-wrench on the

                    the repairers got a chance at it. And he used to wonder what became of all the
                    unsuccessful tinkers, and gunsmiths, and shoemakers, and engineers, and
                    blacksmiths; but nobody could ever tell him. </p></div></div></div>

                </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e147"> MY beautiful new watch had run eighteen months without losing or gaining, and
                    without breaking any part of its machinery or stopping. I had come to believe it
                    infallible in its judgments about the time of day, and to consider its
                    constitution and its anatomy imperishable. But at last, one night, I let it run
                    down. I grieved about it as if it were a recognized messenger and forerunner of
                    calamity. But by and by I cheered up, set the watch by guess, and commanded my
                    bodings and superstitions to depart. Next day I stepped into the chief jeweler's
                    to set it by the exact </p><hr><p id="TwaWatcd1e150">

                </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e154"> time, and the head of the establishment took it out of my hand and proceeded to
                    set it for me. Then he said, "She is four minutes slow — regulator wants
                    pushing up." I tried to stop him — tried to make him understand that the
                    watch kept perfect time. But no; all this human cabbage could see was that the
                    watch was four minutes slow, and the regulator <i>must</i> be
                    pushed up a little; and so, while I danced around him in anguish, and implored
                    him to let the watch alone, he calmly and cruelly did the shameful deed. My
                    watch began to gain. It gained faster and faster day by day. Within the week it
                    sickened to a raging fever, and its pulse went up to a hundred and fifty in the
                    shade. At the end of two months it had left all the timepieces of the town far
                    in the rear, and was a fraction over thirteen days ahead of the almanac. It was
                    away into November enjoying the snow, while the October leaves were still
                    turning. It hurried up house rent, bills payable, and such things, in such a
                    ruinous way that I could not abide it. I took it to the watchmaker to be
                    regulated. He asked me if I had ever had it repaired. I said no, it had never
                    needed any repairing. He looked a look of vicious happiness and eagerly pried
                    the watch open, and then put a small dice box into his eye and peered into its
                    machinery. He said it wanted cleaning and oiling, besides regulating —
                    come in a week. After being cleaned and oiled, and regulated, my watch slowed
                    down to that degree that it ticked like a tolling bell. I began to be left by
                    trains, I failed all appointments, I got to missing my dinner; my watch strung
                    out three days' grace to four and let me go to protest; I gradually drifted back
                    into yesterday, then day before, then into last week, and by and by the
                    comprehension came upon me that all solitary and alone I was lingering along in
                    week before last, and the </p><hr><p id="TwaWatcd1e160">

                </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e164"> world was out of sight. I seemed to detect in myself a sort of sneaking
                    fellow-feeling for the mummy in the museum, and desire to swap news with him. I
                    went to a watch maker again. He took the watch all to pieces while I waited, and
                    then said the barrel was "swelled." He said he could reduce it in three days.
                    After this the watch <i>averaged</i> well, but nothing more. For
                    half a day it would go like the very mischief, and keep up such a barking and

                    watch, and so I went again to have the thing repaired. This person said that the
                    crystal had got bent, and that the mainspring was not straight. He also remarked
                    that part of the works needed half-soling. He made these things all right, and
                    then my timepiece performed unexceptionably, save that now and then, after
                    working along quietly for nearly eight hours, everything inside would let go all
                    of a sudden and begin to buzz like a bee, and the hands would straightway begin
                    to spin round and round so fast that their individuality was lost completely,
                    and they simply seemed a delicate spider's web over the face of the watch. She
                    would reel off the next twenty-four hours in six or seven minutes, and then stop
                    with a bang. I went with a heavy heart to one more watchmaker, and looked on
                    while he took her to pieces. Then I prepared to cross-question him rigidly, for
                    this thing was getting serious. The watch had cost two hundred dollars
                    originally, and I seemed to have paid out two or three thousand for repairs.
                    While I waited and looked on I presently recognized in this watchmaker an old
                    acquaintance — a steamboat engineer of other days, and not a good
                    engineer, either. He examined all the parts carefully, just as the other
                    watchmakers had done, and then delivered his verdict with the same confidence of
                    manner. </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e171"> He said: </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e174"> "She makes too much steam — you want to hang the monkey-wrench on the

                    unsuccessful tinkers, and gunsmiths, and shoemakers, and engineers, and
                    blacksmiths; but nobody could ever tell him. </p></div></div></div>

                </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e147"> MY beautiful new watch had run eighteen months without losing or gaining, and
                    without breaking any part of its machinery or stopping. I had come to believe it
                    infallible in its judgments about the time of day, and to consider its
                    constitution and its anatomy imperishable. But at last, one night, I let it run
                    down. I grieved about it as if it were a recognized messenger and forerunner of
                    calamity. But by and by I cheered up, set the watch by guess, and commanded my
                    bodings and superstitions to depart. Next day I stepped into the chief jeweler's
                    to set it by the exact </p><hr><p id="TwaWatcd1e150">

                </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e154"> time, and the head of the establishment took it out of my hand and proceeded to
                    set it for me. Then he said, "She is four minutes slow — regulator wants
                    pushing up." I tried to stop him — tried to make him understand that the
                    watch kept perfect time. But no; all this human cabbage could see was that the
                    watch was four minutes slow, and the regulator <i>must</i> be
                    pushed up a little; and so, while I danced around him in anguish, and implored
                    him to let the watch alone, he calmly and cruelly did the shameful deed. My
                    watch began to gain. It gained faster and faster day by day. Within the week it
                    sickened to a raging fever, and its pulse went up to a hundred and fifty in the
                    shade. At the end of two months it had left all the timepieces of the town far
                    in the rear, and was a fraction over thirteen days ahead of the almanac. It was
                    away into November enjoying the snow, while the October leaves were still
                    turning. It hurried up house rent, bills payable, and such things, in such a
                    ruinous way that I could not abide it. I took it to the watchmaker to be
                    regulated. He asked me if I had ever had it repaired. I said no, it had never
                    needed any repairing. He looked a look of vicious happiness and eagerly pried
                    the watch open, and then put a small dice box into his eye and peered into its
                    machinery. He said it wanted cleaning and oiling, besides regulating —
                    come in a week. After being cleaned and oiled, and regulated, my watch slowed
                    down to that degree that it ticked like a tolling bell. I began to be left by
                    trains, I failed all appointments, I got to missing my dinner; my watch strung
                    out three days' grace to four and let me go to protest; I gradually drifted back
                    into yesterday, then day before, then into last week, and by and by the
                    comprehension came upon me that all solitary and alone I was lingering along in
                    week before last, and the </p><hr><p id="TwaWatcd1e160">

                </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e164"> world was out of sight. I seemed to detect in myself a sort of sneaking
                    fellow-feeling for the mummy in the museum, and desire to swap news with him. I
                    went to a watch maker again. He took the watch all to pieces while I waited, and
                    then said the barrel was "swelled." He said he could reduce it in three days.
                    After this the watch <i>averaged</i> well, but nothing more. For
                    half a day it would go like the very mischief, and keep up such a barking and
                    wheezing and whooping and sneezing and snorting, that I could not hear myself
                    think for the disturbance; and as long as it held out there was not a watch in
                    the land that stood any chance against it. But the rest of the day it would keep
                    on slowing down and fooling along until all the clocks it had left behind caught
                    up again. So at last, at the end of twenty-four hours, it would trot up to the
                    judges' stand all right and just in time. It would show a fair and square
                    average, and no man could say it had done more or less than its duty. But a
                    correct average is only a mild virtue in a watch, and I took this instrument to
                    another watchmaker. He said the kingbolt was broken. I said I was glad it was
                    nothing more serious. To tell the plain truth, I had no idea what the kingbolt
                    was, but I did not choose to appear ignorant to a stranger. He repaired the
                    kingbolt, but what the watch gained in one way it lost in another. It would run
                    awhile and then stop awhile, and then run awhile again, and so on, using its own
                    discretion about the intervals. And every time it went off it kicked back like a
                    musket. I padded my breast for a few days, but finally took the watch to another
                    watchmaker. He picked it all to pieces, and turned the ruin over and over under
                    his glass; and then he said there appeared to be something the matter with the
                    hair-trigger. He <hr> fixed it, and gave it a fresh start. It did well
                    now, except that always at ten minutes to ten the hands would shut together like
                    a pair of scissors, and from that time forth they would travel together. The
                    oldest man in the world could not make head or tail of the time of day by such a

                </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e147"> MY beautiful new watch had run eighteen months without losing or gaining, and
                    without breaking any part of its machinery or stopping. I had come to believe it
                    infallible in its judgments about the time of day, and to consider its
                    constitution and its anatomy imperishable. But at last, one night, I let it run
                    down. I grieved about it as if it were a recognized messenger and forerunner of
                    calamity. But by and by I cheered up, set the watch by guess, and commanded my
                    bodings and superstitions to depart. Next day I stepped into the chief jeweler's
                    to set it by the exact </p><hr><p id="TwaWatcd1e150">

                </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e154"> time, and the head of the establishment took it out of my hand and proceeded to
                    set it for me. Then he said, "She is four minutes slow — regulator wants
                    pushing up." I tried to stop him — tried to make him understand that the
                    watch kept perfect time. But no; all this human cabbage could see was that the
                    watch was four minutes slow, and the regulator <i>must</i> be
                    pushed up a little; and so, while I danced around him in anguish, and implored
                    him to let the watch alone, he calmly and cruelly did the shameful deed. My
                    watch began to gain. It gained faster and faster day by day. Within the week it
                    sickened to a raging fever, and its pulse went up to a hundred and fifty in the
                    shade. At the end of two months it had left all the timepieces of the town far
                    in the rear, and was a fraction over thirteen days ahead of the almanac. It was
                    away into November enjoying the snow, while the October leaves were still
                    turning. It hurried up house rent, bills payable, and such things, in such a
                    ruinous way that I could not abide it. I took it to the watchmaker to be
                    regulated. He asked me if I had ever had it repaired. I said no, it had never
                    needed any repairing. He looked a look of vicious happiness and eagerly pried
                    the watch open, and then put a small dice box into his eye and peered into its
                    machinery. He said it wanted cleaning and oiling, besides regulating —
                    come in a week. After being cleaned and oiled, and regulated, my watch slowed
                    down to that degree that it ticked like a tolling bell. I began to be left by
                    trains, I failed all appointments, I got to missing my dinner; my watch strung
                    out three days' grace to four and let me go to protest; I gradually drifted back
                    into yesterday, then day before, then into last week, and by and by the
                    comprehension came upon me that all solitary and alone I was lingering along in
                    week before last, and the </p><hr><p id="TwaWatcd1e160">

                </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e164"> world was out of sight. I seemed to detect in myself a sort of sneaking
                    fellow-feeling for the mummy in the museum, and desire to swap news with him. I
                    went to a watch maker again. He took the watch all to pieces while I waited, and
                    then said the barrel was "swelled." He said he could reduce it in three days.
                    After this the watch <i>averaged</i> well, but nothing more. For
                    half a day it would go like the very mischief, and keep up such a barking and
                    wheezing and whooping and sneezing and snorting, that I could not hear myself
                    think for the disturbance; and as long as it held out there was not a watch in
                    the land that stood any chance against it. But the rest of the day it would keep
                    on slowing down and fooling along until all the clocks it had left behind caught
                    up again. So at last, at the end of twenty-four hours, it would trot up to the
                    judges' stand all right and just in time. It would show a fair and square
                    average, and no man could say it had done more or less than its duty. But a
                    correct average is only a mild virtue in a watch, and I took this instrument to
                    another watchmaker. He said the kingbolt was broken. I said I was glad it was
                    nothing more serious. To tell the plain truth, I had no idea what the kingbolt
                    was, but I did not choose to appear ignorant to a stranger. He repaired the
                    kingbolt, but what the watch gained in one way it lost in another. It would run
                    awhile and then stop awhile, and then run awhile again, and so on, using its own
                    discretion about the intervals. And every time it went off it kicked back like a
                    musket. I padded my breast for a few days, but finally took the watch to another
                    watchmaker. He picked it all to pieces, and turned the ruin over and over under
                    his glass; and then he said there appeared to be something the matter with the
                    hair-trigger. He <hr> fixed it, and gave it a fresh start. It did well
                    now, except that always at ten minutes to ten the hands would shut together like
                    a pair of scissors, and from that time forth they would travel together. The
                    oldest man in the world could not make head or tail of the time of day by such a
                    watch, and so I went again to have the thing repaired. This person said that the
                    crystal had got bent, and that the mainspring was not straight. He also remarked
                    that part of the works needed half-soling. He made these things all right, and
                    then my timepiece performed unexceptionably, save that now and then, after
                    working along quietly for nearly eight hours, everything inside would let go all
                    of a sudden and begin to buzz like a bee, and the hands would straightway begin
                    to spin round and round so fast that their individuality was lost completely,
                    and they simply seemed a delicate spider's web over the face of the watch. She
                    would reel off the next twenty-four hours in six or seven minutes, and then stop
                    with a bang. I went with a heavy heart to one more watchmaker, and looked on
                    while he took her to pieces. Then I prepared to cross-question him rigidly, for
                    this thing was getting serious. The watch had cost two hundred dollars
                    originally, and I seemed to have paid out two or three thousand for repairs.
                    While I waited and looked on I presently recognized in this watchmaker an old
                    acquaintance — a steamboat engineer of other days, and not a good
                    engineer, either. He examined all the parts carefully, just as the other
                    watchmakers had done, and then delivered his verdict with the same confidence of
                    manner. </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e171"> He said: </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e174"> "She makes too much steam — you want to hang the monkey-wrench on the

                    bodings and superstitions to depart. Next day I stepped into the chief jeweler's
                    to set it by the exact </p><hr><p id="TwaWatcd1e150">

                </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e154"> time, and the head of the establishment took it out of my hand and proceeded to
                    set it for me. Then he said, "She is four minutes slow — regulator wants
                    pushing up." I tried to stop him — tried to make him understand that the
                    watch kept perfect time. But no; all this human cabbage could see was that the
                    watch was four minutes slow, and the regulator <i>must</i> be
                    pushed up a little; and so, while I danced around him in anguish, and implored
                    him to let the watch alone, he calmly and cruelly did the shameful deed. My
                    watch began to gain. It gained faster and faster day by day. Within the week it
                    sickened to a raging fever, and its pulse went up to a hundred and fifty in the
                    shade. At the end of two months it had left all the timepieces of the town far
                    in the rear, and was a fraction over thirteen days ahead of the almanac. It was
                    away into November enjoying the snow, while the October leaves were still
                    turning. It hurried up house rent, bills payable, and such things, in such a
                    ruinous way that I could not abide it. I took it to the watchmaker to be
                    regulated. He asked me if I had ever had it repaired. I said no, it had never
                    needed any repairing. He looked a look of vicious happiness and eagerly pried
                    the watch open, and then put a small dice box into his eye and peered into its
                    machinery. He said it wanted cleaning and oiling, besides regulating —
                    come in a week. After being cleaned and oiled, and regulated, my watch slowed
                    down to that degree that it ticked like a tolling bell. I began to be left by
                    trains, I failed all appointments, I got to missing my dinner; my watch strung
                    out three days' grace to four and let me go to protest; I gradually drifted back
                    into yesterday, then day before, then into last week, and by and by the
                    comprehension came upon me that all solitary and alone I was lingering along in
                    week before last, and the </p><hr><p id="TwaWatcd1e160">

                </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e164"> world was out of sight. I seemed to detect in myself a sort of sneaking
                    fellow-feeling for the mummy in the museum, and desire to swap news with him. I
                    went to a watch maker again. He took the watch all to pieces while I waited, and
                    then said the barrel was "swelled." He said he could reduce it in three days.
                    After this the watch <i>averaged</i> well, but nothing more. For
                    half a day it would go like the very mischief, and keep up such a barking and
                    wheezing and whooping and sneezing and snorting, that I could not hear myself
                    think for the disturbance; and as long as it held out there was not a watch in
                    the land that stood any chance against it. But the rest of the day it would keep
                    on slowing down and fooling along until all the clocks it had left behind caught
                    up again. So at last, at the end of twenty-four hours, it would trot up to the
                    judges' stand all right and just in time. It would show a fair and square
                    average, and no man could say it had done more or less than its duty. But a
                    correct average is only a mild virtue in a watch, and I took this instrument to
                    another watchmaker. He said the kingbolt was broken. I said I was glad it was
                    nothing more serious. To tell the plain truth, I had no idea what the kingbolt
                    was, but I did not choose to appear ignorant to a stranger. He repaired the
                    kingbolt, but what the watch gained in one way it lost in another. It would run
                    awhile and then stop awhile, and then run awhile again, and so on, using its own
                    discretion about the intervals. And every time it went off it kicked back like a
                    musket. I padded my breast for a few days, but finally took the watch to another
                    watchmaker. He picked it all to pieces, and turned the ruin over and over under
                    his glass; and then he said there appeared to be something the matter with the
                    hair-trigger. He <hr> fixed it, and gave it a fresh start. It did well
                    now, except that always at ten minutes to ten the hands would shut together like
                    a pair of scissors, and from that time forth they would travel together. The
                    oldest man in the world could not make head or tail of the time of day by such a
                    watch, and so I went again to have the thing repaired. This person said that the
                    crystal had got bent, and that the mainspring was not straight. He also remarked
                    that part of the works needed half-soling. He made these things all right, and
                    then my timepiece performed unexceptionably, save that now and then, after
                    working along quietly for nearly eight hours, everything inside would let go all
                    of a sudden and begin to buzz like a bee, and the hands would straightway begin
                    to spin round and round so fast that their individuality was lost completely,
                    and they simply seemed a delicate spider's web over the face of the watch. She
                    would reel off the next twenty-four hours in six or seven minutes, and then stop
                    with a bang. I went with a heavy heart to one more watchmaker, and looked on
                    while he took her to pieces. Then I prepared to cross-question him rigidly, for
                    this thing was getting serious. The watch had cost two hundred dollars
                    originally, and I seemed to have paid out two or three thousand for repairs.
                    While I waited and looked on I presently recognized in this watchmaker an old
                    acquaintance — a steamboat engineer of other days, and not a good
                    engineer, either. He examined all the parts carefully, just as the other
                    watchmakers had done, and then delivered his verdict with the same confidence of
                    manner. </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e171"> He said: </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e174"> "She makes too much steam — you want to hang the monkey-wrench on the
                    safety-valve!" </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e176"> I brained him on the spot, and had him buried at my own expense. </p><p id="TwaWatcd1e178"> My uncle William (now deceased, alas!) used to say that a good horse was a good
                    horse until it had run away once, and that a good watch was a good watch until
                    the repairers got a chance at it. And he used to wonder what became of all the
                    unsuccessful tinkers, and gunsmiths, and shoemakers, and engineers, and
                    blacksmiths; but nobody could ever tell him. </p></div></div></div>
