Ward,<br>
     </p><p id="TwaCeled1e165">Dear Sir: — Well, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and
      inquired after your friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as you requested me to do, and I hereunto
      append the result. If you can get any information out of it you are cordially welcome to it. I
      have a lurking suspicion that your Leonidas W. Smiley is a myth — that you never knew
      such a personage, and that you only conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler about him it would
      remind him of his infamous <i>Jim</i> Smiley, and he would go to work and bore
      me nearly to death with some infernal reminiscence of him as long and tedious as it should be
      useless to me. If that was your design, Mr. Ward, it will gratify you to know that it
      succeeded. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e170">I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room stove of the old, dilapidated tavern
     in the ancient mining camp of Boomerang, and I noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had
     an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He roused up
     and gave me good-day. I told him a friend of mine had commissioned me to make some inquiries
     about a cherished companion of his boyhood named Leonidas W. Smiley — Rev. Leonidas W.
     Smiley — a young minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident of
     this village of Boomerang. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me any thing about this Rev.
     Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to him. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e172">Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his chair — and then
     sat me down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never
     smiled, he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he
     tuned the initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm — but
     all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and
     sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from his imagining that there was any thing
     ridiculous or funny about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired
     its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in finesse. To me, the spectacle of a man drifting
     serenely along through such a queer yarn without ever smiling was exquisitely absurd. As I said
     before, I asked him to tell me what he knew of Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and he replied as
     follows. I let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e174">There was a feller here once by the name of <i>Jim</i> Smiley, in the winter
     of '49 — or maybe it was the spring of '50 — I don't recollect exactly, somehow,
     though what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume wasn't
     finished when he first came to the camp; but any way, he was the curiosest man about always
     betting on any thing that turned up you ever see, if he could get any body to bet on the other
     side, and if he couldn't he'd change sides — any way that suited the other man would suit
      <i>him</i> — any way just so's he got a bet, <i>he</i>
     was satisfied. But still, he was lucky — uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner.
     He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solitry thing mentioned but
     that feller'd offer to bet on it — and take any side you please, as I was just telling
     you. If there was a horse-race, you'd find him flush, or you'd find him busted at the end of
     it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if
     there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he
     would bet you which one would fly first — or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be
     there reglar, to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and
     so he was, too, and a good man. If he even seen a straddle-bug start to go any wheres, he would
     bet you how long it would take him to get wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he
     would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and
     how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about
     him. Why, it never made no difference to <i>him</i> — he would bet on <i>anything</i> — the dangdest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick,
     once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one morning he
     come in, and Smiley asked him how she was, and he said she was considerable better —
     thank the Lord for his inf'nit mercy — and coming on so smart that, with the blessing of
     Providence, she'd get well yet — and Smiley, before he thought, says, "Well, I'll resk
     two-and-a-half that she don't, anyway." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e191">Thish-yer Smiley had a mare — the boys called her the fifteen-minute nag, but that was
     only in fun, you know, because, of course, she was faster than that — and he used to win
     money on that horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or
     the consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred yards'
     start, and then pass her under way; but always at the fag-end of the race she'd get excited and
     desperate-like, and come cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber,
     sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e
     dust, and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose —
     and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e193">And he had a little small bull pup, that to look at him you'd think he warn't worth a cent,
     but to set around and look ornery, and lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon as
     money was up on him, he was a different dog — his underjaw'd begin to stick out like the
     fo'castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover, and shine savage like the furnaces. And
     a dog might tackle him, and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him over his shoulder two or
     three times, and Andrew Jackson — which was the name of the pup — Andrew Jackson
     would never let on but what he was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else — and the
     bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up
     — and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg
     and freeze to it — not chaw, you understand, but only jest grip and hang on till they
     thronged up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he
     harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off in a circular
     saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to
     make a snatch for his pet holt, he saw in a minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other
     dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter
     discouraged-like, and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He
     give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was <i>his</i> fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs for him to take holt of, which
     was his main dependence in a fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It
     was a good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if he'd lived,
     for the stuff was in him, and he had genius — I know it, because he hadn't had no
     opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as
     he could under them circumstances, if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I
     think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e198">Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tom-cats, and all of them
     kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but
     he'd match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'klated to
     edercate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn
     that frog to jump. And you bet you he <i>did</i> learn him, too. He'd give him
     a little hunch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a
     doughnut — see him turn one summerset, or may be a couple, if he got a good start, and
     come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching
     flies, and kept him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as far as he could
     see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do most anything — and
     I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down here on this floor — Dan'l
     Webster was the name of the frog — and sing out, "Flies, Dan'l, flies!" and quicker'n you
     could wink, he'd spring straight up, and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on
     the floor again as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his
     hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do.
     You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And
     when it come to fair-and-square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one
     straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong
     suit, you understand, and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he
     had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had
     traveled and ben everywheres, all said he laid over any frog that ever <i>they</i> see. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e206"> Well, Smiley kept the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to fetch him down town
     sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller — a stranger in the camp, he was —
     come across him with his box, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e208">"What might it be that you've got in the box?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e211">And Smiley says, sorter indifferent like, "It might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, may
     be, but it ain't — it's only just a frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e213"> And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round this way and that, and
     says, "H'm — so 'tis. Well, what's <i>he</i> good for?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e218">"Well," Smiley says, easy and careless, "He's good enough for <i>one</i>
     thing, I should judge — he can out-jump ary frog in Calaveras county." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e223">The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look, and give it back to
     Smiley, and says, very deliberate, "Well — I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's
     any better'n any other frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e225">"Maybe you don't," Smiley says. "Maybe you understand frogs, and maybe you don't understand
     'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you ain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've
     got <i>my</i> opinion, and I'll resk forty dollars that he can outjump ary frog
     in Calaveras county." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e230">And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad, like, "Well, I'm only a stranger
     here, and I ain't got no frog — but if I had a frog, I'd bet you." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e232">And then Smiley says, "That's all right — that's all right — if you'll hold my
     box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog." And so the feller took the box, and put up his forty
     dollars along with Smiley's, and set down to wait. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e234">So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself, and then he got the frog out
     and prized his mouth open and took a tea-spoon and filled him full of quail shot — filled
     him pretty near up to his chin — and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp
     and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him
     in, and give him to this feller, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e236">"Now if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore-paws just even with Dan'l's,
     and I'll give the word." Then he says, "One — two — three — jump!" and him
     and the feller touched up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off, but Dan'l give a
     heave, and hysted up his shoulders — so — like a Frenchman, but it wasn't no use
     — he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as an anvil, and he couldn't no more stir
     than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he
     didn't have no idea what the matter was, of course. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e238">The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at the door, he sorter
     jerked his thumb over his shoulders — this way — at Dan'l, and says again, very
     deliberate, "Well, <i>I</i> don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any
     better'n any other frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e243">Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long time, and at last he
     says, "I do wonder what in the nation that frog throw'd off for — I wonder if there ain't
     something the matter with him — he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow" — and he
     ketched Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and lifted him up and says, "Why, blame my cats, if he
     don't weigh five pound!" — and turned him upside down, and he belched out a
     double-handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man — he set
     the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketchd him. And— </p><p id="TwaCeled1e246">[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to go and see what
     was wanted.] And turning to me as he moved away, he said: "Just set where you are, stranger,
     and rest easy — I an't going to be gone a second." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e248">But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising
     vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely to afford me much information concerning the Rev. Leonidas
     W. Smiley, and so I started away. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e250">At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he button-holed me and recommenced: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e252">"Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yeller one-eyed cow that didn't have no tail, only jest a short
     stump like a bannanner, and " </p><p id="TwaCeled1e254"> "O, curse Smiley and his afflicted cow!" I muttered, good-naturedly, and bidding the old
     gentleman good-day, I departed. </p></div></div></div>

     when it come to fair-and-square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one
     straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong
     suit, you understand, and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he
     had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had
     traveled and ben everywheres, all said he laid over any frog that ever <i>they</i> see. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e206"> Well, Smiley kept the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to fetch him down town
     sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller — a stranger in the camp, he was —
     come across him with his box, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e208">"What might it be that you've got in the box?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e211">And Smiley says, sorter indifferent like, "It might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, may
     be, but it ain't — it's only just a frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e213"> And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round this way and that, and
     says, "H'm — so 'tis. Well, what's <i>he</i> good for?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e218">"Well," Smiley says, easy and careless, "He's good enough for <i>one</i>
     thing, I should judge — he can out-jump ary frog in Calaveras county." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e223">The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look, and give it back to
     Smiley, and says, very deliberate, "Well — I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's
     any better'n any other frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e225">"Maybe you don't," Smiley says. "Maybe you understand frogs, and maybe you don't understand
     'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you ain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've
     got <i>my</i> opinion, and I'll resk forty dollars that he can outjump ary frog
     in Calaveras county." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e230">And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad, like, "Well, I'm only a stranger
     here, and I ain't got no frog — but if I had a frog, I'd bet you." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e232">And then Smiley says, "That's all right — that's all right — if you'll hold my
     box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog." And so the feller took the box, and put up his forty
     dollars along with Smiley's, and set down to wait. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e234">So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself, and then he got the frog out
     and prized his mouth open and took a tea-spoon and filled him full of quail shot — filled
     him pretty near up to his chin — and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp
     and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him
     in, and give him to this feller, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e236">"Now if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore-paws just even with Dan'l's,
     and I'll give the word." Then he says, "One — two — three — jump!" and him
     and the feller touched up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off, but Dan'l give a
     heave, and hysted up his shoulders — so — like a Frenchman, but it wasn't no use
     — he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as an anvil, and he couldn't no more stir
     than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he
     didn't have no idea what the matter was, of course. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e238">The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at the door, he sorter
     jerked his thumb over his shoulders — this way — at Dan'l, and says again, very
     deliberate, "Well, <i>I</i> don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any
     better'n any other frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e243">Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long time, and at last he
     says, "I do wonder what in the nation that frog throw'd off for — I wonder if there ain't
     something the matter with him — he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow" — and he
     ketched Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and lifted him up and says, "Why, blame my cats, if he
     don't weigh five pound!" — and turned him upside down, and he belched out a
     double-handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man — he set
     the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketchd him. And— </p><p id="TwaCeled1e246">[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to go and see what
     was wanted.] And turning to me as he moved away, he said: "Just set where you are, stranger,
     and rest easy — I an't going to be gone a second." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e248">But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising

Ward,<br>
     </p><p id="TwaCeled1e165">Dear Sir: — Well, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and
      inquired after your friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as you requested me to do, and I hereunto
      append the result. If you can get any information out of it you are cordially welcome to it. I
      have a lurking suspicion that your Leonidas W. Smiley is a myth — that you never knew
      such a personage, and that you only conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler about him it would
      remind him of his infamous <i>Jim</i> Smiley, and he would go to work and bore
      me nearly to death with some infernal reminiscence of him as long and tedious as it should be
      useless to me. If that was your design, Mr. Ward, it will gratify you to know that it
      succeeded. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e170">I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room stove of the old, dilapidated tavern
     in the ancient mining camp of Boomerang, and I noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had
     an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He roused up
     and gave me good-day. I told him a friend of mine had commissioned me to make some inquiries
     about a cherished companion of his boyhood named Leonidas W. Smiley — Rev. Leonidas W.
     Smiley — a young minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident of
     this village of Boomerang. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me any thing about this Rev.
     Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to him. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e172">Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his chair — and then
     sat me down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never
     smiled, he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he
     tuned the initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm — but
     all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and
     sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from his imagining that there was any thing
     ridiculous or funny about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired
     its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in finesse. To me, the spectacle of a man drifting
     serenely along through such a queer yarn without ever smiling was exquisitely absurd. As I said
     before, I asked him to tell me what he knew of Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and he replied as
     follows. I let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e174">There was a feller here once by the name of <i>Jim</i> Smiley, in the winter
     of '49 — or maybe it was the spring of '50 — I don't recollect exactly, somehow,
     though what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume wasn't
     finished when he first came to the camp; but any way, he was the curiosest man about always
     betting on any thing that turned up you ever see, if he could get any body to bet on the other
     side, and if he couldn't he'd change sides — any way that suited the other man would suit
      <i>him</i> — any way just so's he got a bet, <i>he</i>
     was satisfied. But still, he was lucky — uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner.
     He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solitry thing mentioned but
     that feller'd offer to bet on it — and take any side you please, as I was just telling
     you. If there was a horse-race, you'd find him flush, or you'd find him busted at the end of
     it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if
     there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he
     would bet you which one would fly first — or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be
     there reglar, to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and
     so he was, too, and a good man. If he even seen a straddle-bug start to go any wheres, he would
     bet you how long it would take him to get wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he
     would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and
     how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about
     him. Why, it never made no difference to <i>him</i> — he would bet on <i>anything</i> — the dangdest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick,
     once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one morning he
     come in, and Smiley asked him how she was, and he said she was considerable better —
     thank the Lord for his inf'nit mercy — and coming on so smart that, with the blessing of
     Providence, she'd get well yet — and Smiley, before he thought, says, "Well, I'll resk
     two-and-a-half that she don't, anyway." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e191">Thish-yer Smiley had a mare — the boys called her the fifteen-minute nag, but that was
     only in fun, you know, because, of course, she was faster than that — and he used to win
     money on that horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or
     the consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred yards'
     start, and then pass her under way; but always at the fag-end of the race she'd get excited and
     desperate-like, and come cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber,
     sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e
     dust, and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose —
     and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e193">And he had a little small bull pup, that to look at him you'd think he warn't worth a cent,
     but to set around and look ornery, and lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon as
     money was up on him, he was a different dog — his underjaw'd begin to stick out like the
     fo'castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover, and shine savage like the furnaces. And
     a dog might tackle him, and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him over his shoulder two or
     three times, and Andrew Jackson — which was the name of the pup — Andrew Jackson
     would never let on but what he was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else — and the
     bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up
     — and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg
     and freeze to it — not chaw, you understand, but only jest grip and hang on till they
     thronged up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he
     harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off in a circular
     saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to
     make a snatch for his pet holt, he saw in a minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other
     dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter
     discouraged-like, and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He
     give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was <i>his</i> fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs for him to take holt of, which
     was his main dependence in a fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It
     was a good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if he'd lived,
     for the stuff was in him, and he had genius — I know it, because he hadn't had no
     opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as
     he could under them circumstances, if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I
     think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e198">Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tom-cats, and all of them
     kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but
     he'd match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'klated to
     edercate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn
     that frog to jump. And you bet you he <i>did</i> learn him, too. He'd give him
     a little hunch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a
     doughnut — see him turn one summerset, or may be a couple, if he got a good start, and
     come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching
     flies, and kept him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as far as he could
     see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do most anything — and
     I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down here on this floor — Dan'l
     Webster was the name of the frog — and sing out, "Flies, Dan'l, flies!" and quicker'n you
     could wink, he'd spring straight up, and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on
     the floor again as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his
     hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do.
     You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And
     when it come to fair-and-square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one
     straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong
     suit, you understand, and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he
     had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had
     traveled and ben everywheres, all said he laid over any frog that ever <i>they</i> see. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e206"> Well, Smiley kept the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to fetch him down town
     sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller — a stranger in the camp, he was —
     come across him with his box, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e208">"What might it be that you've got in the box?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e211">And Smiley says, sorter indifferent like, "It might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, may

     was satisfied. But still, he was lucky — uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner.
     He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solitry thing mentioned but
     that feller'd offer to bet on it — and take any side you please, as I was just telling
     you. If there was a horse-race, you'd find him flush, or you'd find him busted at the end of
     it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if
     there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he
     would bet you which one would fly first — or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be
     there reglar, to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and
     so he was, too, and a good man. If he even seen a straddle-bug start to go any wheres, he would
     bet you how long it would take him to get wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he
     would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and
     how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about
     him. Why, it never made no difference to <i>him</i> — he would bet on <i>anything</i> — the dangdest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick,
     once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one morning he
     come in, and Smiley asked him how she was, and he said she was considerable better —
     thank the Lord for his inf'nit mercy — and coming on so smart that, with the blessing of
     Providence, she'd get well yet — and Smiley, before he thought, says, "Well, I'll resk
     two-and-a-half that she don't, anyway." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e191">Thish-yer Smiley had a mare — the boys called her the fifteen-minute nag, but that was
     only in fun, you know, because, of course, she was faster than that — and he used to win
     money on that horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or
     the consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred yards'
     start, and then pass her under way; but always at the fag-end of the race she'd get excited and
     desperate-like, and come cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber,
     sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e
     dust, and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose —
     and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e193">And he had a little small bull pup, that to look at him you'd think he warn't worth a cent,
     but to set around and look ornery, and lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon as
     money was up on him, he was a different dog — his underjaw'd begin to stick out like the
     fo'castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover, and shine savage like the furnaces. And
     a dog might tackle him, and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him over his shoulder two or
     three times, and Andrew Jackson — which was the name of the pup — Andrew Jackson
     would never let on but what he was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else — and the
     bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up
     — and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg
     and freeze to it — not chaw, you understand, but only jest grip and hang on till they
     thronged up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he
     harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off in a circular
     saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to
     make a snatch for his pet holt, he saw in a minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other
     dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter
     discouraged-like, and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He
     give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was <i>his</i> fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs for him to take holt of, which
     was his main dependence in a fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It
     was a good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if he'd lived,
     for the stuff was in him, and he had genius — I know it, because he hadn't had no
     opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as
     he could under them circumstances, if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I
     think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e198">Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tom-cats, and all of them
     kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but
     he'd match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'klated to
     edercate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn
     that frog to jump. And you bet you he <i>did</i> learn him, too. He'd give him
     a little hunch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a
     doughnut — see him turn one summerset, or may be a couple, if he got a good start, and
     come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching
     flies, and kept him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as far as he could
     see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do most anything — and
     I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down here on this floor — Dan'l
     Webster was the name of the frog — and sing out, "Flies, Dan'l, flies!" and quicker'n you
     could wink, he'd spring straight up, and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on
     the floor again as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his
     hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do.
     You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And
     when it come to fair-and-square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one
     straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong
     suit, you understand, and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he
     had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had
     traveled and ben everywheres, all said he laid over any frog that ever <i>they</i> see. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e206"> Well, Smiley kept the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to fetch him down town
     sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller — a stranger in the camp, he was —
     come across him with his box, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e208">"What might it be that you've got in the box?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e211">And Smiley says, sorter indifferent like, "It might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, may
     be, but it ain't — it's only just a frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e213"> And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round this way and that, and
     says, "H'm — so 'tis. Well, what's <i>he</i> good for?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e218">"Well," Smiley says, easy and careless, "He's good enough for <i>one</i>
     thing, I should judge — he can out-jump ary frog in Calaveras county." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e223">The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look, and give it back to
     Smiley, and says, very deliberate, "Well — I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's
     any better'n any other frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e225">"Maybe you don't," Smiley says. "Maybe you understand frogs, and maybe you don't understand
     'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you ain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've
     got <i>my</i> opinion, and I'll resk forty dollars that he can outjump ary frog
     in Calaveras county." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e230">And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad, like, "Well, I'm only a stranger
     here, and I ain't got no frog — but if I had a frog, I'd bet you." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e232">And then Smiley says, "That's all right — that's all right — if you'll hold my
     box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog." And so the feller took the box, and put up his forty
     dollars along with Smiley's, and set down to wait. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e234">So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself, and then he got the frog out
     and prized his mouth open and took a tea-spoon and filled him full of quail shot — filled
     him pretty near up to his chin — and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp
     and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him
     in, and give him to this feller, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e236">"Now if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore-paws just even with Dan'l's,
     and I'll give the word." Then he says, "One — two — three — jump!" and him
     and the feller touched up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off, but Dan'l give a
     heave, and hysted up his shoulders — so — like a Frenchman, but it wasn't no use
     — he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as an anvil, and he couldn't no more stir
     than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he
     didn't have no idea what the matter was, of course. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e238">The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at the door, he sorter
     jerked his thumb over his shoulders — this way — at Dan'l, and says again, very
     deliberate, "Well, <i>I</i> don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any
     better'n any other frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e243">Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long time, and at last he
     says, "I do wonder what in the nation that frog throw'd off for — I wonder if there ain't
     something the matter with him — he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow" — and he
     ketched Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and lifted him up and says, "Why, blame my cats, if he
     don't weigh five pound!" — and turned him upside down, and he belched out a
     double-handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man — he set
     the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketchd him. And— </p><p id="TwaCeled1e246">[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to go and see what
     was wanted.] And turning to me as he moved away, he said: "Just set where you are, stranger,
     and rest easy — I an't going to be gone a second." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e248">But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising
     vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely to afford me much information concerning the Rev. Leonidas
     W. Smiley, and so I started away. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e250">At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he button-holed me and recommenced: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e252">"Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yeller one-eyed cow that didn't have no tail, only jest a short
     stump like a bannanner, and " </p><p id="TwaCeled1e254"> "O, curse Smiley and his afflicted cow!" I muttered, good-naturedly, and bidding the old
     gentleman good-day, I departed. </p></div></div></div>

Ward,<br>
     </p><p id="TwaCeled1e165">Dear Sir: — Well, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and
      inquired after your friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as you requested me to do, and I hereunto
      append the result. If you can get any information out of it you are cordially welcome to it. I
      have a lurking suspicion that your Leonidas W. Smiley is a myth — that you never knew
      such a personage, and that you only conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler about him it would
      remind him of his infamous <i>Jim</i> Smiley, and he would go to work and bore
      me nearly to death with some infernal reminiscence of him as long and tedious as it should be
      useless to me. If that was your design, Mr. Ward, it will gratify you to know that it
      succeeded. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e170">I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room stove of the old, dilapidated tavern
     in the ancient mining camp of Boomerang, and I noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had
     an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He roused up
     and gave me good-day. I told him a friend of mine had commissioned me to make some inquiries
     about a cherished companion of his boyhood named Leonidas W. Smiley — Rev. Leonidas W.
     Smiley — a young minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident of
     this village of Boomerang. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me any thing about this Rev.
     Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to him. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e172">Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his chair — and then
     sat me down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never
     smiled, he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he
     tuned the initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm — but
     all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and
     sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from his imagining that there was any thing
     ridiculous or funny about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired
     its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in finesse. To me, the spectacle of a man drifting
     serenely along through such a queer yarn without ever smiling was exquisitely absurd. As I said
     before, I asked him to tell me what he knew of Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and he replied as
     follows. I let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e174">There was a feller here once by the name of <i>Jim</i> Smiley, in the winter
     of '49 — or maybe it was the spring of '50 — I don't recollect exactly, somehow,
     though what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume wasn't
     finished when he first came to the camp; but any way, he was the curiosest man about always
     betting on any thing that turned up you ever see, if he could get any body to bet on the other
     side, and if he couldn't he'd change sides — any way that suited the other man would suit
      <i>him</i> — any way just so's he got a bet, <i>he</i>
     was satisfied. But still, he was lucky — uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner.
     He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solitry thing mentioned but
     that feller'd offer to bet on it — and take any side you please, as I was just telling

     it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if
     there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he
     would bet you which one would fly first — or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be
     there reglar, to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and
     so he was, too, and a good man. If he even seen a straddle-bug start to go any wheres, he would

     — he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as an anvil, and he couldn't no more stir

     ketched Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and lifted him up and says, "Why, blame my cats, if he
     don't weigh five pound!" — and turned him upside down, and he belched out a
     double-handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man — he set
     the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketchd him. And— </p><p id="TwaCeled1e246">[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to go and see what

Ward,<br>
     </p><p id="TwaCeled1e165">Dear Sir: — Well, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and
      inquired after your friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as you requested me to do, and I hereunto
      append the result. If you can get any information out of it you are cordially welcome to it. I
      have a lurking suspicion that your Leonidas W. Smiley is a myth — that you never knew
      such a personage, and that you only conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler about him it would
      remind him of his infamous <i>Jim</i> Smiley, and he would go to work and bore
      me nearly to death with some infernal reminiscence of him as long and tedious as it should be
      useless to me. If that was your design, Mr. Ward, it will gratify you to know that it
      succeeded. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e170">I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room stove of the old, dilapidated tavern
     in the ancient mining camp of Boomerang, and I noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had
     an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He roused up
     and gave me good-day. I told him a friend of mine had commissioned me to make some inquiries
     about a cherished companion of his boyhood named Leonidas W. Smiley — Rev. Leonidas W.
     Smiley — a young minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident of
     this village of Boomerang. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me any thing about this Rev.
     Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to him. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e172">Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his chair — and then
     sat me down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never
     smiled, he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he
     tuned the initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm — but
     all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and
     sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from his imagining that there was any thing
     ridiculous or funny about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired
     its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in finesse. To me, the spectacle of a man drifting
     serenely along through such a queer yarn without ever smiling was exquisitely absurd. As I said
     before, I asked him to tell me what he knew of Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and he replied as
     follows. I let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e174">There was a feller here once by the name of <i>Jim</i> Smiley, in the winter
     of '49 — or maybe it was the spring of '50 — I don't recollect exactly, somehow,
     though what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume wasn't
     finished when he first came to the camp; but any way, he was the curiosest man about always
     betting on any thing that turned up you ever see, if he could get any body to bet on the other
     side, and if he couldn't he'd change sides — any way that suited the other man would suit
      <i>him</i> — any way just so's he got a bet, <i>he</i>
     was satisfied. But still, he was lucky — uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner.
     He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solitry thing mentioned but
     that feller'd offer to bet on it — and take any side you please, as I was just telling
     you. If there was a horse-race, you'd find him flush, or you'd find him busted at the end of
     it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if
     there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he
     would bet you which one would fly first — or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be
     there reglar, to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and
     so he was, too, and a good man. If he even seen a straddle-bug start to go any wheres, he would
     bet you how long it would take him to get wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he
     would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and
     how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about
     him. Why, it never made no difference to <i>him</i> — he would bet on <i>anything</i> — the dangdest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick,
     once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one morning he
     come in, and Smiley asked him how she was, and he said she was considerable better —
     thank the Lord for his inf'nit mercy — and coming on so smart that, with the blessing of
     Providence, she'd get well yet — and Smiley, before he thought, says, "Well, I'll resk
     two-and-a-half that she don't, anyway." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e191">Thish-yer Smiley had a mare — the boys called her the fifteen-minute nag, but that was
     only in fun, you know, because, of course, she was faster than that — and he used to win
     money on that horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or
     the consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred yards'
     start, and then pass her under way; but always at the fag-end of the race she'd get excited and
     desperate-like, and come cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber,
     sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e
     dust, and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose —
     and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e193">And he had a little small bull pup, that to look at him you'd think he warn't worth a cent,
     but to set around and look ornery, and lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon as
     money was up on him, he was a different dog — his underjaw'd begin to stick out like the
     fo'castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover, and shine savage like the furnaces. And
     a dog might tackle him, and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him over his shoulder two or
     three times, and Andrew Jackson — which was the name of the pup — Andrew Jackson
     would never let on but what he was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else — and the
     bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up
     — and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg
     and freeze to it — not chaw, you understand, but only jest grip and hang on till they
     thronged up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he
     harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off in a circular
     saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to
     make a snatch for his pet holt, he saw in a minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other
     dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter
     discouraged-like, and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He
     give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was <i>his</i> fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs for him to take holt of, which
     was his main dependence in a fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It
     was a good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if he'd lived,
     for the stuff was in him, and he had genius — I know it, because he hadn't had no
     opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as
     he could under them circumstances, if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I
     think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e198">Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tom-cats, and all of them
     kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but
     he'd match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'klated to
     edercate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn
     that frog to jump. And you bet you he <i>did</i> learn him, too. He'd give him
     a little hunch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a
     doughnut — see him turn one summerset, or may be a couple, if he got a good start, and
     come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching
     flies, and kept him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as far as he could
     see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do most anything — and
     I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down here on this floor — Dan'l
     Webster was the name of the frog — and sing out, "Flies, Dan'l, flies!" and quicker'n you
     could wink, he'd spring straight up, and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on
     the floor again as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his
     hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do.
     You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And
     when it come to fair-and-square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one
     straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong
     suit, you understand, and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he
     had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had
     traveled and ben everywheres, all said he laid over any frog that ever <i>they</i> see. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e206"> Well, Smiley kept the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to fetch him down town
     sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller — a stranger in the camp, he was —
     come across him with his box, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e208">"What might it be that you've got in the box?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e211">And Smiley says, sorter indifferent like, "It might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, may
     be, but it ain't — it's only just a frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e213"> And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round this way and that, and
     says, "H'm — so 'tis. Well, what's <i>he</i> good for?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e218">"Well," Smiley says, easy and careless, "He's good enough for <i>one</i>
     thing, I should judge — he can out-jump ary frog in Calaveras county." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e223">The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look, and give it back to
     Smiley, and says, very deliberate, "Well — I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's
     any better'n any other frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e225">"Maybe you don't," Smiley says. "Maybe you understand frogs, and maybe you don't understand
     'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you ain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've
     got <i>my</i> opinion, and I'll resk forty dollars that he can outjump ary frog
     in Calaveras county." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e230">And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad, like, "Well, I'm only a stranger
     here, and I ain't got no frog — but if I had a frog, I'd bet you." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e232">And then Smiley says, "That's all right — that's all right — if you'll hold my
     box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog." And so the feller took the box, and put up his forty
     dollars along with Smiley's, and set down to wait. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e234">So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself, and then he got the frog out
     and prized his mouth open and took a tea-spoon and filled him full of quail shot — filled
     him pretty near up to his chin — and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp
     and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him
     in, and give him to this feller, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e236">"Now if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore-paws just even with Dan'l's,
     and I'll give the word." Then he says, "One — two — three — jump!" and him
     and the feller touched up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off, but Dan'l give a
     heave, and hysted up his shoulders — so — like a Frenchman, but it wasn't no use
     — he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as an anvil, and he couldn't no more stir
     than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he
     didn't have no idea what the matter was, of course. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e238">The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at the door, he sorter

     deliberate, "Well, <i>I</i> don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any
     better'n any other frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e243">Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long time, and at last he

     — and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg
     and freeze to it — not chaw, you understand, but only jest grip and hang on till they
     thronged up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he
     harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off in a circular
     saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to
     make a snatch for his pet holt, he saw in a minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other
     dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter
     discouraged-like, and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He
     give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was <i>his</i> fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs for him to take holt of, which
     was his main dependence in a fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It
     was a good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if he'd lived,
     for the stuff was in him, and he had genius — I know it, because he hadn't had no
     opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as
     he could under them circumstances, if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I
     think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e198">Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tom-cats, and all of them
     kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but
     he'd match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'klated to
     edercate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn
     that frog to jump. And you bet you he <i>did</i> learn him, too. He'd give him
     a little hunch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a
     doughnut — see him turn one summerset, or may be a couple, if he got a good start, and
     come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching
     flies, and kept him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as far as he could
     see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do most anything — and
     I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down here on this floor — Dan'l
     Webster was the name of the frog — and sing out, "Flies, Dan'l, flies!" and quicker'n you
     could wink, he'd spring straight up, and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on
     the floor again as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his
     hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do.
     You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And
     when it come to fair-and-square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one
     straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong
     suit, you understand, and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he
     had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had
     traveled and ben everywheres, all said he laid over any frog that ever <i>they</i> see. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e206"> Well, Smiley kept the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to fetch him down town
     sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller — a stranger in the camp, he was —
     come across him with his box, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e208">"What might it be that you've got in the box?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e211">And Smiley says, sorter indifferent like, "It might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, may
     be, but it ain't — it's only just a frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e213"> And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round this way and that, and
     says, "H'm — so 'tis. Well, what's <i>he</i> good for?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e218">"Well," Smiley says, easy and careless, "He's good enough for <i>one</i>
     thing, I should judge — he can out-jump ary frog in Calaveras county." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e223">The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look, and give it back to
     Smiley, and says, very deliberate, "Well — I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's
     any better'n any other frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e225">"Maybe you don't," Smiley says. "Maybe you understand frogs, and maybe you don't understand
     'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you ain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've
     got <i>my</i> opinion, and I'll resk forty dollars that he can outjump ary frog
     in Calaveras county." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e230">And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad, like, "Well, I'm only a stranger
     here, and I ain't got no frog — but if I had a frog, I'd bet you." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e232">And then Smiley says, "That's all right — that's all right — if you'll hold my
     box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog." And so the feller took the box, and put up his forty
     dollars along with Smiley's, and set down to wait. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e234">So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself, and then he got the frog out
     and prized his mouth open and took a tea-spoon and filled him full of quail shot — filled
     him pretty near up to his chin — and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp
     and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him
     in, and give him to this feller, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e236">"Now if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore-paws just even with Dan'l's,
     and I'll give the word." Then he says, "One — two — three — jump!" and him
     and the feller touched up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off, but Dan'l give a
     heave, and hysted up his shoulders — so — like a Frenchman, but it wasn't no use
     — he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as an anvil, and he couldn't no more stir
     than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he
     didn't have no idea what the matter was, of course. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e238">The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at the door, he sorter
     jerked his thumb over his shoulders — this way — at Dan'l, and says again, very
     deliberate, "Well, <i>I</i> don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any
     better'n any other frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e243">Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long time, and at last he
     says, "I do wonder what in the nation that frog throw'd off for — I wonder if there ain't
     something the matter with him — he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow" — and he
     ketched Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and lifted him up and says, "Why, blame my cats, if he
     don't weigh five pound!" — and turned him upside down, and he belched out a
     double-handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man — he set
     the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketchd him. And— </p><p id="TwaCeled1e246">[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to go and see what
     was wanted.] And turning to me as he moved away, he said: "Just set where you are, stranger,
     and rest easy — I an't going to be gone a second." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e248">But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising
     vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely to afford me much information concerning the Rev. Leonidas

     stump like a bannanner, and " </p><p id="TwaCeled1e254"> "O, curse Smiley and his afflicted cow!" I muttered, good-naturedly, and bidding the old

Ward,<br>
     </p><p id="TwaCeled1e165">Dear Sir: — Well, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and
      inquired after your friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as you requested me to do, and I hereunto
      append the result. If you can get any information out of it you are cordially welcome to it. I
      have a lurking suspicion that your Leonidas W. Smiley is a myth — that you never knew
      such a personage, and that you only conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler about him it would
      remind him of his infamous <i>Jim</i> Smiley, and he would go to work and bore
      me nearly to death with some infernal reminiscence of him as long and tedious as it should be
      useless to me. If that was your design, Mr. Ward, it will gratify you to know that it
      succeeded. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e170">I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room stove of the old, dilapidated tavern
     in the ancient mining camp of Boomerang, and I noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had
     an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He roused up
     and gave me good-day. I told him a friend of mine had commissioned me to make some inquiries
     about a cherished companion of his boyhood named Leonidas W. Smiley — Rev. Leonidas W.
     Smiley — a young minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident of
     this village of Boomerang. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me any thing about this Rev.
     Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to him. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e172">Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his chair — and then
     sat me down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never
     smiled, he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he
     tuned the initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm — but
     all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and
     sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from his imagining that there was any thing
     ridiculous or funny about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired
     its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in finesse. To me, the spectacle of a man drifting
     serenely along through such a queer yarn without ever smiling was exquisitely absurd. As I said
     before, I asked him to tell me what he knew of Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and he replied as
     follows. I let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e174">There was a feller here once by the name of <i>Jim</i> Smiley, in the winter
     of '49 — or maybe it was the spring of '50 — I don't recollect exactly, somehow,
     though what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume wasn't
     finished when he first came to the camp; but any way, he was the curiosest man about always
     betting on any thing that turned up you ever see, if he could get any body to bet on the other
     side, and if he couldn't he'd change sides — any way that suited the other man would suit
      <i>him</i> — any way just so's he got a bet, <i>he</i>
     was satisfied. But still, he was lucky — uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner.
     He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solitry thing mentioned but
     that feller'd offer to bet on it — and take any side you please, as I was just telling
     you. If there was a horse-race, you'd find him flush, or you'd find him busted at the end of
     it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if
     there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he
     would bet you which one would fly first — or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be
     there reglar, to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and
     so he was, too, and a good man. If he even seen a straddle-bug start to go any wheres, he would
     bet you how long it would take him to get wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he
     would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and
     how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about
     him. Why, it never made no difference to <i>him</i> — he would bet on <i>anything</i> — the dangdest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick,
     once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one morning he
     come in, and Smiley asked him how she was, and he said she was considerable better —
     thank the Lord for his inf'nit mercy — and coming on so smart that, with the blessing of
     Providence, she'd get well yet — and Smiley, before he thought, says, "Well, I'll resk
     two-and-a-half that she don't, anyway." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e191">Thish-yer Smiley had a mare — the boys called her the fifteen-minute nag, but that was
     only in fun, you know, because, of course, she was faster than that — and he used to win
     money on that horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or
     the consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred yards'
     start, and then pass her under way; but always at the fag-end of the race she'd get excited and
     desperate-like, and come cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber,
     sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e
     dust, and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose —
     and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e193">And he had a little small bull pup, that to look at him you'd think he warn't worth a cent,
     but to set around and look ornery, and lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon as
     money was up on him, he was a different dog — his underjaw'd begin to stick out like the
     fo'castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover, and shine savage like the furnaces. And
     a dog might tackle him, and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him over his shoulder two or
     three times, and Andrew Jackson — which was the name of the pup — Andrew Jackson
     would never let on but what he was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else — and the
     bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up
     — and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg
     and freeze to it — not chaw, you understand, but only jest grip and hang on till they
     thronged up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he
     harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off in a circular
     saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to
     make a snatch for his pet holt, he saw in a minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other
     dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter
     discouraged-like, and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He
     give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was <i>his</i> fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs for him to take holt of, which
     was his main dependence in a fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It
     was a good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if he'd lived,
     for the stuff was in him, and he had genius — I know it, because he hadn't had no
     opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as
     he could under them circumstances, if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I
     think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e198">Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tom-cats, and all of them

     You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And

     </p><p id="TwaCeled1e165">Dear Sir: — Well, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and
      inquired after your friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as you requested me to do, and I hereunto
      append the result. If you can get any information out of it you are cordially welcome to it. I
      have a lurking suspicion that your Leonidas W. Smiley is a myth — that you never knew
      such a personage, and that you only conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler about him it would
      remind him of his infamous <i>Jim</i> Smiley, and he would go to work and bore
      me nearly to death with some infernal reminiscence of him as long and tedious as it should be
      useless to me. If that was your design, Mr. Ward, it will gratify you to know that it
      succeeded. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e170">I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room stove of the old, dilapidated tavern
     in the ancient mining camp of Boomerang, and I noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had
     an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He roused up
     and gave me good-day. I told him a friend of mine had commissioned me to make some inquiries
     about a cherished companion of his boyhood named Leonidas W. Smiley — Rev. Leonidas W.
     Smiley — a young minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident of
     this village of Boomerang. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me any thing about this Rev.
     Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to him. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e172">Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his chair — and then
     sat me down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never
     smiled, he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he
     tuned the initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm — but
     all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and
     sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from his imagining that there was any thing
     ridiculous or funny about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired
     its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in finesse. To me, the spectacle of a man drifting
     serenely along through such a queer yarn without ever smiling was exquisitely absurd. As I said
     before, I asked him to tell me what he knew of Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and he replied as
     follows. I let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e174">There was a feller here once by the name of <i>Jim</i> Smiley, in the winter
     of '49 — or maybe it was the spring of '50 — I don't recollect exactly, somehow,
     though what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume wasn't
     finished when he first came to the camp; but any way, he was the curiosest man about always
     betting on any thing that turned up you ever see, if he could get any body to bet on the other
     side, and if he couldn't he'd change sides — any way that suited the other man would suit
      <i>him</i> — any way just so's he got a bet, <i>he</i>
     was satisfied. But still, he was lucky — uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner.
     He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solitry thing mentioned but
     that feller'd offer to bet on it — and take any side you please, as I was just telling
     you. If there was a horse-race, you'd find him flush, or you'd find him busted at the end of
     it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if
     there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he
     would bet you which one would fly first — or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be
     there reglar, to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and
     so he was, too, and a good man. If he even seen a straddle-bug start to go any wheres, he would
     bet you how long it would take him to get wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he
     would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and
     how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about
     him. Why, it never made no difference to <i>him</i> — he would bet on <i>anything</i> — the dangdest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick,
     once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one morning he
     come in, and Smiley asked him how she was, and he said she was considerable better —
     thank the Lord for his inf'nit mercy — and coming on so smart that, with the blessing of
     Providence, she'd get well yet — and Smiley, before he thought, says, "Well, I'll resk
     two-and-a-half that she don't, anyway." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e191">Thish-yer Smiley had a mare — the boys called her the fifteen-minute nag, but that was
     only in fun, you know, because, of course, she was faster than that — and he used to win
     money on that horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or
     the consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred yards'
     start, and then pass her under way; but always at the fag-end of the race she'd get excited and
     desperate-like, and come cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber,
     sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e
     dust, and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose —
     and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e193">And he had a little small bull pup, that to look at him you'd think he warn't worth a cent,
     but to set around and look ornery, and lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon as
     money was up on him, he was a different dog — his underjaw'd begin to stick out like the
     fo'castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover, and shine savage like the furnaces. And
     a dog might tackle him, and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him over his shoulder two or
     three times, and Andrew Jackson — which was the name of the pup — Andrew Jackson
     would never let on but what he was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else — and the
     bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up
     — and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg
     and freeze to it — not chaw, you understand, but only jest grip and hang on till they
     thronged up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he
     harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off in a circular
     saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to
     make a snatch for his pet holt, he saw in a minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other
     dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter
     discouraged-like, and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He
     give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was <i>his</i> fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs for him to take holt of, which
     was his main dependence in a fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It
     was a good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if he'd lived,
     for the stuff was in him, and he had genius — I know it, because he hadn't had no
     opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as
     he could under them circumstances, if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I
     think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e198">Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tom-cats, and all of them
     kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but
     he'd match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'klated to
     edercate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn
     that frog to jump. And you bet you he <i>did</i> learn him, too. He'd give him
     a little hunch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a
     doughnut — see him turn one summerset, or may be a couple, if he got a good start, and
     come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching
     flies, and kept him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as far as he could
     see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do most anything — and
     I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down here on this floor — Dan'l
     Webster was the name of the frog — and sing out, "Flies, Dan'l, flies!" and quicker'n you
     could wink, he'd spring straight up, and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on
     the floor again as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his
     hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do.
     You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And
     when it come to fair-and-square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one
     straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong
     suit, you understand, and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he
     had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had
     traveled and ben everywheres, all said he laid over any frog that ever <i>they</i> see. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e206"> Well, Smiley kept the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to fetch him down town
     sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller — a stranger in the camp, he was —
     come across him with his box, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e208">"What might it be that you've got in the box?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e211">And Smiley says, sorter indifferent like, "It might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, may
     be, but it ain't — it's only just a frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e213"> And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round this way and that, and
     says, "H'm — so 'tis. Well, what's <i>he</i> good for?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e218">"Well," Smiley says, easy and careless, "He's good enough for <i>one</i>
     thing, I should judge — he can out-jump ary frog in Calaveras county." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e223">The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look, and give it back to
     Smiley, and says, very deliberate, "Well — I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's
     any better'n any other frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e225">"Maybe you don't," Smiley says. "Maybe you understand frogs, and maybe you don't understand
     'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you ain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've
     got <i>my</i> opinion, and I'll resk forty dollars that he can outjump ary frog
     in Calaveras county." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e230">And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad, like, "Well, I'm only a stranger
     here, and I ain't got no frog — but if I had a frog, I'd bet you." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e232">And then Smiley says, "That's all right — that's all right — if you'll hold my
     box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog." And so the feller took the box, and put up his forty
     dollars along with Smiley's, and set down to wait. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e234">So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself, and then he got the frog out
     and prized his mouth open and took a tea-spoon and filled him full of quail shot — filled
     him pretty near up to his chin — and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp
     and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him
     in, and give him to this feller, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e236">"Now if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore-paws just even with Dan'l's,
     and I'll give the word." Then he says, "One — two — three — jump!" and him
     and the feller touched up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off, but Dan'l give a
     heave, and hysted up his shoulders — so — like a Frenchman, but it wasn't no use
     — he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as an anvil, and he couldn't no more stir
     than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he
     didn't have no idea what the matter was, of course. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e238">The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at the door, he sorter
     jerked his thumb over his shoulders — this way — at Dan'l, and says again, very
     deliberate, "Well, <i>I</i> don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any
     better'n any other frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e243">Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long time, and at last he
     says, "I do wonder what in the nation that frog throw'd off for — I wonder if there ain't
     something the matter with him — he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow" — and he
     ketched Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and lifted him up and says, "Why, blame my cats, if he
     don't weigh five pound!" — and turned him upside down, and he belched out a
     double-handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man — he set
     the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketchd him. And— </p><p id="TwaCeled1e246">[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to go and see what
     was wanted.] And turning to me as he moved away, he said: "Just set where you are, stranger,
     and rest easy — I an't going to be gone a second." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e248">But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising
     vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely to afford me much information concerning the Rev. Leonidas
     W. Smiley, and so I started away. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e250">At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he button-holed me and recommenced: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e252">"Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yeller one-eyed cow that didn't have no tail, only jest a short
     stump like a bannanner, and " </p><p id="TwaCeled1e254"> "O, curse Smiley and his afflicted cow!" I muttered, good-naturedly, and bidding the old
     gentleman good-day, I departed. </p></div></div></div>

     Webster was the name of the frog — and sing out, "Flies, Dan'l, flies!" and quicker'n you
     could wink, he'd spring straight up, and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on
     the floor again as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his
     hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do.
     You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And
     when it come to fair-and-square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one
     straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong
     suit, you understand, and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he
     had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had
     traveled and ben everywheres, all said he laid over any frog that ever <i>they</i> see. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e206"> Well, Smiley kept the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to fetch him down town
     sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller — a stranger in the camp, he was —
     come across him with his box, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e208">"What might it be that you've got in the box?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e211">And Smiley says, sorter indifferent like, "It might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, may
     be, but it ain't — it's only just a frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e213"> And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round this way and that, and
     says, "H'm — so 'tis. Well, what's <i>he</i> good for?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e218">"Well," Smiley says, easy and careless, "He's good enough for <i>one</i>
     thing, I should judge — he can out-jump ary frog in Calaveras county." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e223">The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look, and give it back to
     Smiley, and says, very deliberate, "Well — I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's
     any better'n any other frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e225">"Maybe you don't," Smiley says. "Maybe you understand frogs, and maybe you don't understand
     'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you ain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've
     got <i>my</i> opinion, and I'll resk forty dollars that he can outjump ary frog
     in Calaveras county." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e230">And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad, like, "Well, I'm only a stranger
     here, and I ain't got no frog — but if I had a frog, I'd bet you." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e232">And then Smiley says, "That's all right — that's all right — if you'll hold my
     box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog." And so the feller took the box, and put up his forty
     dollars along with Smiley's, and set down to wait. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e234">So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself, and then he got the frog out
     and prized his mouth open and took a tea-spoon and filled him full of quail shot — filled
     him pretty near up to his chin — and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp
     and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him
     in, and give him to this feller, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e236">"Now if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore-paws just even with Dan'l's,
     and I'll give the word." Then he says, "One — two — three — jump!" and him
     and the feller touched up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off, but Dan'l give a
     heave, and hysted up his shoulders — so — like a Frenchman, but it wasn't no use
     — he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as an anvil, and he couldn't no more stir
     than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he
     didn't have no idea what the matter was, of course. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e238">The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at the door, he sorter
     jerked his thumb over his shoulders — this way — at Dan'l, and says again, very
     deliberate, "Well, <i>I</i> don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any
     better'n any other frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e243">Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long time, and at last he
     says, "I do wonder what in the nation that frog throw'd off for — I wonder if there ain't
     something the matter with him — he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow" — and he
     ketched Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and lifted him up and says, "Why, blame my cats, if he
     don't weigh five pound!" — and turned him upside down, and he belched out a
     double-handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man — he set
     the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketchd him. And— </p><p id="TwaCeled1e246">[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to go and see what
     was wanted.] And turning to me as he moved away, he said: "Just set where you are, stranger,
     and rest easy — I an't going to be gone a second." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e248">But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising

Ward,<br>
     </p><p id="TwaCeled1e165">Dear Sir: — Well, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and
      inquired after your friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as you requested me to do, and I hereunto
      append the result. If you can get any information out of it you are cordially welcome to it. I
      have a lurking suspicion that your Leonidas W. Smiley is a myth — that you never knew
      such a personage, and that you only conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler about him it would
      remind him of his infamous <i>Jim</i> Smiley, and he would go to work and bore
      me nearly to death with some infernal reminiscence of him as long and tedious as it should be
      useless to me. If that was your design, Mr. Ward, it will gratify you to know that it
      succeeded. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e170">I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room stove of the old, dilapidated tavern
     in the ancient mining camp of Boomerang, and I noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had
     an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He roused up
     and gave me good-day. I told him a friend of mine had commissioned me to make some inquiries
     about a cherished companion of his boyhood named Leonidas W. Smiley — Rev. Leonidas W.
     Smiley — a young minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident of
     this village of Boomerang. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me any thing about this Rev.
     Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to him. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e172">Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his chair — and then
     sat me down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never
     smiled, he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he
     tuned the initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm — but
     all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and
     sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from his imagining that there was any thing
     ridiculous or funny about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired
     its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in finesse. To me, the spectacle of a man drifting
     serenely along through such a queer yarn without ever smiling was exquisitely absurd. As I said
     before, I asked him to tell me what he knew of Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and he replied as
     follows. I let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e174">There was a feller here once by the name of <i>Jim</i> Smiley, in the winter
     of '49 — or maybe it was the spring of '50 — I don't recollect exactly, somehow,
     though what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume wasn't
     finished when he first came to the camp; but any way, he was the curiosest man about always
     betting on any thing that turned up you ever see, if he could get any body to bet on the other
     side, and if he couldn't he'd change sides — any way that suited the other man would suit
      <i>him</i> — any way just so's he got a bet, <i>he</i>
     was satisfied. But still, he was lucky — uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner.
     He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solitry thing mentioned but
     that feller'd offer to bet on it — and take any side you please, as I was just telling
     you. If there was a horse-race, you'd find him flush, or you'd find him busted at the end of
     it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if
     there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he
     would bet you which one would fly first — or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be
     there reglar, to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and
     so he was, too, and a good man. If he even seen a straddle-bug start to go any wheres, he would
     bet you how long it would take him to get wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he
     would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and
     how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about
     him. Why, it never made no difference to <i>him</i> — he would bet on <i>anything</i> — the dangdest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick,
     once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one morning he
     come in, and Smiley asked him how she was, and he said she was considerable better —
     thank the Lord for his inf'nit mercy — and coming on so smart that, with the blessing of
     Providence, she'd get well yet — and Smiley, before he thought, says, "Well, I'll resk
     two-and-a-half that she don't, anyway." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e191">Thish-yer Smiley had a mare — the boys called her the fifteen-minute nag, but that was
     only in fun, you know, because, of course, she was faster than that — and he used to win
     money on that horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or
     the consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred yards'
     start, and then pass her under way; but always at the fag-end of the race she'd get excited and
     desperate-like, and come cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber,
     sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e
     dust, and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose —
     and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e193">And he had a little small bull pup, that to look at him you'd think he warn't worth a cent,
     but to set around and look ornery, and lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon as
     money was up on him, he was a different dog — his underjaw'd begin to stick out like the
     fo'castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover, and shine savage like the furnaces. And
     a dog might tackle him, and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him over his shoulder two or
     three times, and Andrew Jackson — which was the name of the pup — Andrew Jackson
     would never let on but what he was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else — and the
     bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up
     — and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg
     and freeze to it — not chaw, you understand, but only jest grip and hang on till they
     thronged up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he
     harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off in a circular
     saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to
     make a snatch for his pet holt, he saw in a minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other
     dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter
     discouraged-like, and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He
     give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was <i>his</i> fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs for him to take holt of, which
     was his main dependence in a fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It
     was a good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if he'd lived,
     for the stuff was in him, and he had genius — I know it, because he hadn't had no
     opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as
     he could under them circumstances, if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I
     think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e198">Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tom-cats, and all of them
     kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but
     he'd match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'klated to
     edercate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn
     that frog to jump. And you bet you he <i>did</i> learn him, too. He'd give him
     a little hunch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a
     doughnut — see him turn one summerset, or may be a couple, if he got a good start, and
     come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching
     flies, and kept him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as far as he could
     see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do most anything — and
     I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down here on this floor — Dan'l
     Webster was the name of the frog — and sing out, "Flies, Dan'l, flies!" and quicker'n you
     could wink, he'd spring straight up, and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on
     the floor again as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his
     hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do.
     You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And
     when it come to fair-and-square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one
     straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong
     suit, you understand, and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he

     of '49 — or maybe it was the spring of '50 — I don't recollect exactly, somehow,
     though what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume wasn't
     finished when he first came to the camp; but any way, he was the curiosest man about always
     betting on any thing that turned up you ever see, if he could get any body to bet on the other
     side, and if he couldn't he'd change sides — any way that suited the other man would suit
      <i>him</i> — any way just so's he got a bet, <i>he</i>
     was satisfied. But still, he was lucky — uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner.
     He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solitry thing mentioned but
     that feller'd offer to bet on it — and take any side you please, as I was just telling
     you. If there was a horse-race, you'd find him flush, or you'd find him busted at the end of
     it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if
     there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he
     would bet you which one would fly first — or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be
     there reglar, to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and
     so he was, too, and a good man. If he even seen a straddle-bug start to go any wheres, he would
     bet you how long it would take him to get wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he
     would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and
     how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about
     him. Why, it never made no difference to <i>him</i> — he would bet on <i>anything</i> — the dangdest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick,
     once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one morning he
     come in, and Smiley asked him how she was, and he said she was considerable better —
     thank the Lord for his inf'nit mercy — and coming on so smart that, with the blessing of
     Providence, she'd get well yet — and Smiley, before he thought, says, "Well, I'll resk
     two-and-a-half that she don't, anyway." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e191">Thish-yer Smiley had a mare — the boys called her the fifteen-minute nag, but that was
     only in fun, you know, because, of course, she was faster than that — and he used to win
     money on that horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or
     the consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred yards'
     start, and then pass her under way; but always at the fag-end of the race she'd get excited and
     desperate-like, and come cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber,
     sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e
     dust, and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose —
     and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e193">And he had a little small bull pup, that to look at him you'd think he warn't worth a cent,
     but to set around and look ornery, and lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon as
     money was up on him, he was a different dog — his underjaw'd begin to stick out like the
     fo'castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover, and shine savage like the furnaces. And
     a dog might tackle him, and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him over his shoulder two or
     three times, and Andrew Jackson — which was the name of the pup — Andrew Jackson
     would never let on but what he was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else — and the
     bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up
     — and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg
     and freeze to it — not chaw, you understand, but only jest grip and hang on till they
     thronged up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he
     harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off in a circular
     saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to
     make a snatch for his pet holt, he saw in a minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other
     dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter
     discouraged-like, and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He
     give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was <i>his</i> fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs for him to take holt of, which
     was his main dependence in a fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It
     was a good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if he'd lived,
     for the stuff was in him, and he had genius — I know it, because he hadn't had no
     opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as
     he could under them circumstances, if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I
     think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e198">Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tom-cats, and all of them
     kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but
     he'd match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'klated to
     edercate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn
     that frog to jump. And you bet you he <i>did</i> learn him, too. He'd give him
     a little hunch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a
     doughnut — see him turn one summerset, or may be a couple, if he got a good start, and
     come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching
     flies, and kept him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as far as he could
     see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do most anything — and
     I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down here on this floor — Dan'l
     Webster was the name of the frog — and sing out, "Flies, Dan'l, flies!" and quicker'n you
     could wink, he'd spring straight up, and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on
     the floor again as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his
     hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do.
     You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And
     when it come to fair-and-square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one
     straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong
     suit, you understand, and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he
     had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had
     traveled and ben everywheres, all said he laid over any frog that ever <i>they</i> see. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e206"> Well, Smiley kept the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to fetch him down town
     sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller — a stranger in the camp, he was —
     come across him with his box, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e208">"What might it be that you've got in the box?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e211">And Smiley says, sorter indifferent like, "It might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, may
     be, but it ain't — it's only just a frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e213"> And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round this way and that, and
     says, "H'm — so 'tis. Well, what's <i>he</i> good for?" </p><p id="TwaCeled1e218">"Well," Smiley says, easy and careless, "He's good enough for <i>one</i>
     thing, I should judge — he can out-jump ary frog in Calaveras county." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e223">The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look, and give it back to
     Smiley, and says, very deliberate, "Well — I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's
     any better'n any other frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e225">"Maybe you don't," Smiley says. "Maybe you understand frogs, and maybe you don't understand
     'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you ain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've
     got <i>my</i> opinion, and I'll resk forty dollars that he can outjump ary frog
     in Calaveras county." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e230">And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad, like, "Well, I'm only a stranger
     here, and I ain't got no frog — but if I had a frog, I'd bet you." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e232">And then Smiley says, "That's all right — that's all right — if you'll hold my
     box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog." And so the feller took the box, and put up his forty
     dollars along with Smiley's, and set down to wait. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e234">So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself, and then he got the frog out
     and prized his mouth open and took a tea-spoon and filled him full of quail shot — filled
     him pretty near up to his chin — and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp
     and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him
     in, and give him to this feller, and says: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e236">"Now if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore-paws just even with Dan'l's,
     and I'll give the word." Then he says, "One — two — three — jump!" and him
     and the feller touched up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off, but Dan'l give a
     heave, and hysted up his shoulders — so — like a Frenchman, but it wasn't no use
     — he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as an anvil, and he couldn't no more stir
     than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he
     didn't have no idea what the matter was, of course. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e238">The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at the door, he sorter
     jerked his thumb over his shoulders — this way — at Dan'l, and says again, very
     deliberate, "Well, <i>I</i> don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any
     better'n any other frog." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e243">Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long time, and at last he
     says, "I do wonder what in the nation that frog throw'd off for — I wonder if there ain't
     something the matter with him — he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow" — and he
     ketched Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and lifted him up and says, "Why, blame my cats, if he
     don't weigh five pound!" — and turned him upside down, and he belched out a
     double-handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man — he set
     the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketchd him. And— </p><p id="TwaCeled1e246">[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to go and see what
     was wanted.] And turning to me as he moved away, he said: "Just set where you are, stranger,
     and rest easy — I an't going to be gone a second." </p><p id="TwaCeled1e248">But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising
     vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely to afford me much information concerning the Rev. Leonidas
     W. Smiley, and so I started away. </p><p id="TwaCeled1e250">At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he button-holed me and recommenced: </p><p id="TwaCeled1e252">"Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yeller one-eyed cow that didn't have no tail, only jest a short
     stump like a bannanner, and " </p><p id="TwaCeled1e254"> "O, curse Smiley and his afflicted cow!" I muttered, good-naturedly, and bidding the old
     gentleman good-day, I departed. </p></div></div></div>
