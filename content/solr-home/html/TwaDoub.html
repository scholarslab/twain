There has been a
            wedding, between a handsome young man of slender means and a rich young girl—a
            case of love at first sight and a precipitate marriage; a marriage bitterly opposed by
            the girl's widowed father. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e140">Jacob Fuller, the bridegroom, is twenty-six years old, is of an old but unconsidered
            family which had by compulsion emigrated from Sedgemoor, and for King James's purse's
            profit, so everybody said—some maliciously the rest merely because they believed
            it. The bride is nineteen and beautiful. She is intense, high-strung, romantic,
            immeasurably proud of her Cavalier blood, and passionate in her love for her young
            husband. For its sake she braved her father's displeasure, endured his reproaches,
            listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions and went from his house
            without his blessing, proud and happy in the proofs she was thus giving of the quality
            of the affection which had made its home in her heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e142">The morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her. Her husband put aside
            her proffered caresses, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e144">"Sit down. I have something to say to you. I loved you. That was before I asked your
            father to give you to me. His refusal is not my grievance—I could have endured
            that. But the things he said of me to you—that is a different matter.
            There—you needn't speak; I know quite well what they were; I got them from
            authentic sources. Among other things he said that my character was written in my face;
            that I was treacherous, a dissembler, a coward, and a brute without sense of pity or
            compassion: the 'Sedgemoor trade-mark,' he called it—and 'white-sleeve badge.' Any
            other man in my place would have gone to his house and shot him down like a dog. I
            wanted to do it, and was minded to do it, but a better thought came to me: to put him to
            shame; to break his heart; to kill him by inches. How to do it? Through my treatment of
            you, his idol! I would marry you; and then—Have patience. You will see. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e146">From that moment onward, for three months, the young wife suffered all the
            humiliations, all the insults, all the miseries that the diligent and inventive mind of
            the husband could contrive, save physical injuries only. Her strong pride stood by her,
            and she kept the secret of her troubles. Now and then the husband said, "Why don't you
            go to your father and tell him?" Then he invented new tortures, applied them, and asked
            again. She always answered, "He shall never know by my mouth," and taunted him with his
            origin; said she was the lawful slave of a scion of slaves, and must obey, and
            would—up to that point, but no further; he could kill her if he liked, but he
            could not break her; it was not in the Sedgemoor breed to do it. At the end of the three
            months he said, with a dark significance in his manner, "I have tried all things but
            one"—and waited for her reply. "Try that," she said, and curled her lip in
            mockery. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e148">That night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes, then said to her: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e150">"Get up and dress!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e152">She obeyed—as always, without a word. He led her half a mile from the house, and
            proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public road; and succeeded, she
            screaming and struggling. He gagged her then, struck her across the face with his
            cowhide, and set his bloodhounds on her. They tore the clothes off her, and she was
            naked. He called the dogs off, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e154">"You will be found—by the passing public. They will be dropping along about three
            hours from now, and will spread the news—do you hear? Good-by. You have seen the
            last of me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e156">He went away then. She moaned to herself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e159">"I shall bear a child—to <i>him!</i> God grant it may be a boy!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e164">The farmers released her by and by—and spread the news, which was natural. They
            raised the country with lynching intentions, but the bird had flown. The young wife shut
            herself up in her father's house; he shut himself up with her, and thenceforth would see
            no one. His pride was broken, and his heart; so he wasted away, day by day, and even his
            daughter rejoiced when death relieved him. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e166">Then she sold the estate and disappeared.</p>Chapter 2<p id="TwaDoubd1e171">In 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded New England village,
            with no company but a little boy about five years old. She did her own work, she
            discouraged acquaintanceships, and had none. The butcher, the baker, and the others that
            served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was
            Stillman, and that she called the child Archy. Whence she came they had not been able to
            find out, but they said she talked like a Southerner. The child had no playmates and no
            comrade, and no teacher but the mother. She taught him diligently and intelligently, and
            was satisfied with the results—even a little proud of them. One day Archy said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e173">"Mamma, am I different from other children?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e175">"Well, I suppose not. Why?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e177">"There was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had been by and I
            said yes, and she said how long since I saw him and I said I hadn't seen him at all, and
            she said how did I know he'd been by, then, and I said because I smelt his track on the
            sidewalk, and she said I was a dum fool and made a mouth at me. What did she do that
            for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e179">The young woman turned white, and said to herself, "It's a birth mark! The gift of the
            bloodhound is in him." She snatched the boy to her breast and hugged him passionately,
            saying, "God has appointed the way!" Her eyes were burning with a fierce light, and her
            breath came short and quick with excitement. She said to herself: "The puzzle is solved
            now; many a time it has been a mystery to me, the impossible things the child has done
            in the dark, but it is all clear to me now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e181">She set him in his small chair, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e183">"Wait a little till I come, dear; then we will talk about the matter." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e185">She went up to her room and took from her dressing-table several small articles and put
            them out of sight: a nail-file on the floor under the bed; a pair of nail-scissors under
            the bureau; a small ivory paper-knife under the wardrobe. Then she returned, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e187">"There! I have left some things which I ought to have brought down." She named them,
            and said, "Run up and bring them, dear." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e189">The child hurried away on his errand and was soon back again with the things. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e192">"Did you have any difficulty, dear?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e194">"No, mamma; I only went where you went." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e196">During his absence she had stepped to the bookcase, taken several books from the bottom
            shelf, opened each, passed her hand over a page, noting its number in her memory, then
            restored them to their places. Now she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e198">"I have been doing something while you have been gone, Archy. Do you think you can find
            out what it was?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e200">The boy went to the bookcase and got out the books that had been touched, and opened
            them at the pages which had been stroked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e202">The mother took him in her lap, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e204">"I will answer your question now, dear. I have found out that in one way you are quite
            different from other people. You can see in the dark, you can smell what other people
            cannot, you have the talents of a bloodhound. They are good and valuable things to have,
            but you must keep the matter a secret. If people found it out, they would speak of you
            as an odd child, a strange child, and children would be disagreeable to you, and give
            you nicknames. In this world one must be like everybody else if he doesn't want to
            provoke scorn or envy or jealousy. It is a great and fine distinction which has been
            born to you, and I am glad; but you will keep it a secret, for mamma's sake, won't you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e206">The child promised, without understanding. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e208">All the rest of the day the mother's brain was busy with excited thinkings; with plans,
            projects, schemes, each and all of them uncanny, grim, and dark. Yet they lit up her
            face; lit it with a fell light of their own; lit it with vague fires of hell. She was in
            a fever of unrest; she could not sit, stand, read, sew; there was no relief for her but
            in movement. She tested her boy's gift in twenty ways, and kept saying to herself all
            the time, with her mind in the past: "He broke my father's heart, and night and day all
            these years I have tried, and all in vain, to think out a way to break his. I have found
            it now—I have found it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e210">When night fell, the demon of unrest still possessed her. She went on with her tests;
            with a candle she traversed the house from garret to cellar, hiding pins, needles,
            thimbles, spools, under pillows, under carpets, in cracks in the walls, under the coal
            in the bin; then sent the little fellow in the dark to find them; which he did, and was
            happy and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e212">From this time forward life took on a new complexion for her. She said, "The future is
            secure—I can wait, and enjoy the waiting." The most of her lost interests revived.
            She took up music again, and languages, drawing, painting, and the other long-discarded
            delights of her maidenhood. She was happy once more, and felt again the zest of life. As
            the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy, and was contented with it.
            Not altogether, but nearly that. The soft side of his heart was larger than the other
            side of it. It was his only defect, in her eyes. But she considered that his love for
            her and worship of her made up for it. He was a good hater—that was well; but it
            was a question if the materials of his hatreds were of as tough and enduring a quality
            as those of his friendships—and that was not so well. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e215">The years drifted on. Archy was become a handsome, shapely, athletic youth, courteous,
            dignified, companionable, pleasant in his ways, and looking perhaps a trifle older than
            he was, which was sixteen. One evening his mother said she had something of grave
            importance to say to him, adding that he was old enough to hear it now, and old enough
            and possessed of character enough and stability enough to carry out a stern plan which
            she had been for years contriving and maturing. Then she told him her bitter story, in
            all its naked atrociousness. For a while the boy was paralyzed; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e217">"I understand. We are Southerners; and by our custom and nature there is but one
            atonement. I will search him out and kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e219">"Kill him? No! Death is release, emancipation; death is a favor. Do I owe him favors?
            You must not hurt a hair of his head." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e221">The boy was lost in thought awhile; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e223">"You are all the world to me, and your desire is my law and my pleasure. Tell me what
            to do and I will do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e225">The mother's eyes beamed with satisfaction, and she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e227">"You will go and find him. I have known his hiding-place for eleven years; it cost me
            five years and more of inquiry, and much money, to locate it. He is a quartz-miner in
            Colorado, and well-to-do. He lives in Denver. His name is Jacob Fuller. There—it
            is the first time I have spoken it since that unforgettable night. Think! That name
            could have been yours if I had not saved you that shame and furnished you a cleaner one.
            You will drive him from that place; you will hunt him down and drive him again; and yet
            again, and again, and again, persistently, relentlessly, poisoning his life, filling it
            with mysterious terrors, loading it with weariness and misery, making him wish for
            death, and that he had a suicide's courage; you will make of him another Wandering Jew;
            he shall know no rest any more, no peace of mind, no placid sleep; you shall shadow him,
            cling to him, persecute him, till you break his heart, as he broke my father's and
            mine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e229">"I will obey, mother." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e231">"I believe it, my child. The preparations are all made; everything is ready. Here is a
            letter of credit; spend freely, there is no lack of money. At times you may need
            disguises. I have provided them; also some other conveniences." She took from the drawer
            of the typewriter-table several squares of paper. They all bore these typewritten
            words:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e233"><i>$10,000 REWARD</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e237"><i>It is believed that a certain man who is wanted in an Eastern
                state is sojourning here. In 1880, in the night, he tied his young wife to a tree by
                the public road, cut her across the face with a cowhide, and made his dogs tear her
                clothes from her, leaving her naked. He left her there, and fled the country. A
                blood-relative of hers has searched for him for seventeen years. Address . . . . . .

                the person who will furnish the seeker, in a personal interview, the criminal's
                address.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e242">"When you have found him and acquainted yourself with his scent, you will go in the
            night and placard one of these upon the building he occupies, and another one upon the
            post-office or in some other prominent place. It will be the talk of the region. At
            first you must give him several days in which to force a sale of his belongings at
            something approaching their value. We will ruin him by and by, but gradually; we must
            not impoverish him at once, for that could bring him to despair and injure his health,
            possibly kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e244">She took three or four more typewritten forms from the
            drawer—duplicates—and read one:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e246">. . . . . . . . . ., . . . . . . . . . ., 18. . . .</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e249"><i>To Jacob Fuller:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e253"><i>You have . . . . . . days in which to settle your affairs. You

                after the named hour, I will placard you on all the dead walls, detailing your crime

                including your own. Have no fear of bodily injury—it will in no circumstances
                ever be inflicted upon you. You brought misery upon an old man, and ruined his life

            Afterward, when you are ready for him to vanish out of a place, see that he gets a copy
            of <i>this</i> form, which merely says:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e266"><i>MOVE ON. You have . . . . . . days.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e270">"He will obey. That is sure."</p>Chapter III<p id="TwaDoubd1e275">Extracts from letters to the mother:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e277">DENVER, <i>April 3, 1897</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e282"><i>I have now been living several days in the same hotel with Jacob
                Fuller. I have his scent; I could track him through ten divisions of infantry and
                find him. I have often been near him and heard him talk. He owns a good mine, and
                has a fair income from it; but he is not rich. He learned mining in a good
                way—by working at it for wages. He is a cheerful creature, and his forty-three
                years sit lightly upon him; he could pass for a younger man—say thirty-six or
                thirty-seven. He has never married again—passes himself off for a widower. He
                stands well, is liked, is popular, and has many friends. Even I feel a drawing
                toward him—the paternal blood in me making its claim. How blind and
                unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature—the most of them, in
                fact! My task is become hard now—you realize it? you comprehend, and make
                allowances?—and the fire of it has cooled, more than I like to confess to
                myself, But I will carry it out. Even with the pleasure paled, the duty remains, and
                I will not spare him.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e286"><i>And for my help, a sharp resentment rises in me when I reflect
                that he who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not suffered by it.
                The lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character, and in the change he is
                happy. He, the guilty party, is absolved from all suffering; you, the innocent, are
                borne down with it. But be comforted—he shall harvest his share.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e290">SILVER GULCH, <i>May 19</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e295"><i>I placarded Form No. 1 at midnight of April 3; an hour later I

                before 11.50 the night of the 14th.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e299"><i>Some late bird of a reporter stole one of my placards, then hunted
                the town over and found the other one, and stole that. In this manner he
                accomplished what the profession call a "scoop"—that is, he got a valuable
                item, and saw to it that no other paper got it. And so his paper—the principal
                one in the town—had it in glaring type on the editorial page in the morning,
                followed by a Vesuvian opinion of our wretch a column long, which wound up by adding
                a thousand dollars to our reward on the paper's account! The journals out here know
                how to do the noble thing—when there's business in it.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e303"><i>At breakfast I occupied my usual seat—selected because it
                afforded a view of papa Fuller's face, and was near enough for me to hear the talk
                that went on at his table. Seventy-five or a hundred people were in the room, and
                all discussing that item, and saying they hoped the seeker would find that rascal
                and remove the pollution of his presence from the town—with a rail, or a
                bullet, or something.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e307"><i>When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leave—folded
                up—in one hand, and the newspaper in the other; and it gave me more than half
                a pang to see him. His cheerfulness was all gone, and he looked old and pinched and
                ashy. And then—only think of the things he had to listen to! Mamma, he heard
                his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and characterizations drawn
                from the very dictionaries and phrase-books of Satan's own authorized editions down
                below. And more than that, he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them. His
                applause tasted bitter in his mouth, though; he could not disguise that from me; and
                it was observable that his appetite was gone; he only nibbled; he couldn't eat.
                Finally a man said:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e311"><i>"It is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing
                what this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel. I hope so."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e316"><i>Ah, dear, it was pitiful the way Fuller winced, and glanced around
                scared! He couldn't endure any more, and got up and left.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e320"><i>During several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in
                Mexico, and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could, and give the
                property his personal attention. He played his cards well; said he would take
                $40,000—a quarter in cash, the rest in safe notes; but that as he greatly
                needed money on account of his new purchase, he would diminish his terms for cash in
                full, He sold out for $30,000. And then, what do you think he did? He asked for
                greenbacks, and took them, saying the man in Mexico was a New-Englander, with a head
                full of crotchets, and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts. People thought it
                queer, since a draft on New York could produce greenbacks quite conveniently. There
                was talk of this odd thing, but only for a day; that is as long as any topic lasts
                in Denver.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e324"><i>I was watching, all the time. As soon as the sale was completed
                and the money paid—which was on the 11th—I began to stick to Fuller's
                track without dropping it for a moment. That night—no, 12th, for it was a
                little past midnight—I tracked him to his room, which was four doors from mine
                in the same hall; then I went back and put on my muddy day-laborer disguise,
                darkened my complexion, and sat down in my room in the gloom, with a gripsack handy,
                with a change in it, and my door ajar. For I suspected that the bird would take wing
                now. In half an hour an old woman passed by, carrying a grip: I caught the familiar
                whiff, and followed with my grip, for it was Fuller. He left the hotel by a side
                entrance, and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three
                blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness, and got into a two-horse hack, which of
                course was waiting for him by appointment. I took a seat (uninvited) on the trunk
                platform behind, and we drove briskly off. We drove ten miles, and the hack stopped
                at a way-station and was discharged. Fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow
                under the awning, as far as he could get from the light; I went inside, and watched
                the ticket-office. Fuller bought no ticket; I bought none. Presently the train came
                along, and he boarded a car; I entered the same car at the other end, and came down
                the aisle and took the seat behind him. When he paid the conductor and named his
                objective point, I dropped back several seats, while the conductor was changing a
                bill, and when he came to me I paid to the same place—about a hundred miles
                westward.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e328"><i>From that time for a week on end he led me a dance. He traveled
                here and there and yonder—always on a general westward trend—but he boas
                not a woman after the first day. He was a laborer, like myself, and wore bushy false
                whiskers. His outfit was perfect, and he could do the character without thinking
                about it, for he had served the trade for wages. His nearest friend could not have
                recognized him. At last he located himself here, the obscurest little mountain camp
                in Montana; he has a shanty, and goes out prospecting daily; is gone all day, and
                avoids society. I am living at a miner's boardinghouse, and it is an awful place:
                the bunks, the food, the dirt—everything.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e332"><i>We have been here four weeks, and in that time I have seen him but
                once; but every night I go over his track and post myself. As soon as he engaged a
                shanty here I went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed that Denver hotel to
                keep my baggage till I should send for it. I need nothing here but a change of army
                shirts, and I brought that with me.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e336">SILVER GULCH, <i>June 12</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e341"><i>The Denver episode has never found its way here, I think. I know
                the most of the men in camp, and they have never referred to it, at least in my
                hearing. Fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions. He has located a
                claim, two miles away, in an out-of-the-way place in the mountains; it promises very
                well, and he is working it diligently. Ah, but the change in him! He never smiles,
                and he keeps quite to himself, consorting with no one—he who was so fond of
                company and so cheery only two months ago. I have seen him passing along several
                times recently—drooping, forlorn, the spring gone from his step, a pathetic
                figure. He calls himself David Wilson.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e345"><i>I can trust him to remain here until we disturb him. Since you

                and edible food, and endurable beds, and bodily decency; then I will fetch my

                than the other one; he came here a young widower in '79, aged twenty-one—a
                year before you were married; and the documents to prove it are innumerable. Last
                night I talked with familiar friends of his who have known him from the day of his
                arrival. I said nothing, but a few days from now I will land him in this town again,
                with the loss upon his mine made good; and there will be a banquet, and a
                torch-light procession, and there will not be any expense on anybody but me. Do you

                have not been able to think it out, and I have tried till my brains are addled. "If
                the gentleman who lately bought a mine in Mexico and sold one in Denver will send
                his address to" (to whom, mother!), "it will be explained to him that it was all a
                mistake; his forgiveness will be asked, and full reparation made for a loss which he
                sustained in a certain matter." Do you see? He would think it a trap. Well, any one
                would. If I should say, "It is now known that he was not the man wanted, but another
                man—a man who once bore the same name, but discarded it for good
                reasons"—would that answer? But the Denver people would wake up then and say
                "Oho!" and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks, and say, "Why did he
                run away if he wasn't the right man?—it is too thin." If I failed to find him
                he would be ruined there—there where there is no taint upon him now. You have

                mistake; a dog would have gone the other way. But I am only part dog, and can get
                very humanly stupid when excited. He had been stopping in that house ten days; I
                almost know, now, that he stops long nowhere, the past six or eight months, but is
                restless and has to keep moving. I understand that feeling! and I know what it is to
                feel it. He still uses the name he had registered when I came so near catching him
                nine months ago—"James Walker"; doubtless the same he adopted when he fled
                from Silver Gulch. An unpretending man, and has small taste for fancy names. I
                recognized the hand easily, through its slight disguise. A square man, and not good

                horizon! I should have saved half on hour if I had gone in the right direction at

                Hope Cañon; I traced him to a point thirty miles from here, but there I lost
                the trail; some one gave him a lift in a wagon, I suppose. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e463"><i>I am taking a rest, now—modified by searchings for the lost
                trail. I was tired to death, mother, and low-spirited, and sometimes coming
                uncomfortably near to losing hope; but the miners in this little camp are good
                fellows, and I am used to their sort this long time back; and their breezy ways
                freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles. I have been here a month. I am
                cabining with a young fellow named "Sammy" Hillyer, about twenty-five, the only son
                of his mother—like me—and loves her dearly, and writes to her every
                week—part of which is like me. He is a timid body, and in the matter of
                intellect—well, he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire; but no
                matter, he is well liked; he is good and fine, and it is meat and bread and rest and
                luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again. I wish "James Walker"
                could have it. He had friends; he liked company. That brings up that picture of him,
                the time that I saw him last. The pathos of it! It comes before me often and often.
                At that very time, poor thing, I was girding up my conscience to make him move on
                again!</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e467"><i>Hillyer's heart is better than mine, better than anybody's in the
                community, I suppose, for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the
                camp—Flint Buckner—and the only man Flint ever talks with or allows to
                talk with him. He says he knows Flint's history, and that it is trouble that has
                made him what he is, and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can. Now
                none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a lodger like Flint
                Buckner, from all I hear about him outside. I think that this one detail will give
                you a better idea of Sammy's character than any labored-out description I could
                furnish you of him. In one of our talks he said something about like this: "Flint is
                a kinsman of mine, and he pours out all his troubles to me—empties his breast
                from time to time, or I reckon it would burst. There couldn't be any unhappier man,
                Archy Stillman; his life had been made up of misery of mind—he isn't near as
                old as he looks. He has lost the feel of reposefulness and peace—oh, years and
                years ago! He doesn't know what good luck is—never has had any; often says he
                wishes he was in the other hell, he is so tired of this one."</i></p>Chapter IV<p id="TwaDoubd1e474"><i>No real gentleman will tell the naked truth in the presence of
              ladies.</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e478">It was a crisp and spicy morning in early October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with
            the glory-fires of autumn, hung burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge
            provided by kind Nature for the wingless wild things that have their homes in the
            tree-tops and would visit together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and
            yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the
            sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere;
            far in he empty sky a solitary esophagus[1] slept upon motionless
            wing; everywhere brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e483">October is the time—1900; Hope Cañon is the place, a silver-mining camp
            away down in the Esmeralda region. It is a secluded spot, high and remote; recent as to
            discovery; thought by its occupants to be rich in metal—a year or two's
            prospecting will decide that matter one way or the other. For inhabitants, the camp has
            about two hundred miners, one white woman and child, several Chinese washermen, five
            squaws, and a dozen vagrant buck Indians in rabbit-skin robes, battered plug hats, and
            tin-can necklaces. There are no mills as yet; no church, no newspaper. The camp has
            existed but two years; it has made no big strike; the world is ignorant of its name and
            place. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e485">On both sides of the cañon the mountains rise wall-like, three thousand feet,
            and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the
            sun only once a day, when he sails over at noon. The village is a couple of miles long;
            the cabins stand well apart from each other. The tavern is the only "frame"
            house—the only house, one might say. It occupies a central position, and is the
            evening resort of the population. They drink there, and play seven-up and dominoes; also
            billiards, for there is a table, crossed all over with torn places repaired with
            court-plaster; there are some cues, but no leathers; some chipped balls which clatter
            when they run, and do not slow up gradually, but stop suddenly and sit down; there is a
            part of a cube of chalk, with a projecting jag of flint in it; and the man who can score
            six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bar's expense. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e487">Flint Buckner's cabin was the last one of the village, going south; his silver-claim
            was at the other end of the village, northward, and a little beyond the last hut in that
            direction. He was a sour creature, unsociable, and had no companionships. People who had
            tried to get acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him. His history was not
            known. Some believed that Sammy Hillyer knew it; others said no. If asked, Hillyer said
            no, he was not acquainted with it. Flint had a meek English youth of sixteen or
            seventeen with him, whom he treated roughly, both in public and in private; and of
            course this lad was applied to for information, but with no success. Fetlock
            Jones—name of the youth—said that Flint picked him up on a prospecting
            tramp, and as he had neither home nor friends in America, he had found it wise to stay
            and take Buckner's hard usage for the sake of the salary, which was bacon and beans.
            Further than this he could offer no testimony. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e489">Fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now, and under his meek exterior he was
            slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and humiliations which his master had put
            upon him. For the meek suffer bitterly from these hurts; more bitterly, perhaps, than do
            the manlier sort, who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the limit of
            endurance has been reached. Good-hearted people wanted to help Fetlock out of his
            trouble, and tried to get him to leave Buckner; but the boy showed fright at the
            thought, and said he "dasn't." Pat Riley urged him, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e491">"You leave the damned hunks and come with me; don't you be afraid. I'll take care of
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e496">The boy thanked him with tears in his eyes, but shuddered and said he "dasn't risk it";
            he said Flint would catch him alone, some time, in the night, and then—"Oh, it
            makes me sick, Mr. Riley, to think of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e498">Others said, "Run away from him; we'll stake you; skip out for the coast some night."
            But all these suggestions failed; he said Flint would hunt him down and fetch him back,
            just for meanness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e500">The people could not understand this. The boy's miseries went steadily on, week after
            week. It is quite likely that the people would have understood if they had known how he
            was employing his spare time. He slept in an out-cabin near Flint's; and there, nights,
            he nursed his bruises and his humiliations, and studied and studied over a single
            problem—how he could murder Flint Buckner and not be found out. It was the only
            joy he had in life; these hours were the only ones in the twenty-four which he looked
            forward to with eagerness and spent in happiness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e503">He thought of poison. No—that would not serve; the inquest would reveal where it
            was procured and who had procured it. He thought of a shot in the back in a lonely place
            when Flint would be homeward bound at midnight—his unvarying hour for the trip.
            No—somebody might be near, and catch him. He thought of stabbing him in his sleep.
            No—he might strike an inefficient blow, and Flint would seize him. He examined a
            hundred different ways—none of them would answer; for in even the very obscurest
            and secretest of them there was always the fatal defect of a <i>risk,</i> a chance, a possibility that he might be found out. He would have none of
            that. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e508">But he was patient, endlessly patient. There was no hurry, he said to himself. He would
            never leave Flint till he left him a corpse; there was no hurry—he would find the
            way. It was somewhere, and he would endure shame and pain and misery until he found it.
            Yes, somewhere there was a way which would leave not a trace, not even the faintest clue
            to the murderer—there was no hurry—he would find that way, and
            then—oh, then, it would just be good to be alive! Meantime he would diligently
            keep up his reputation for meekness; and also, as always theretofore, he would allow no
            one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about his oppressor. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e510">Two days before the before-mentioned October morning Flint had bought some things, and
            he and Fetlock had brought them home to Flint's cabin: a fresh box of candles, which
            they put in the corner; a tin can of blasting-powder, which they placed upon the
            candle-box; a keg of blasting-powder, which they placed under Flint's bunk; a huge coil
            of fuse, which they hung on a peg. Fetlock reasoned that Flint's mining operations had
            outgrown the pick, and that blasting was about to begin now. He had seen blasting done,
            and he had a notion of the process, but he had never helped in it. His conjecture was
            right—blasting-time had come. In the morning the pair carried fuse, drills, and
            the powder-can to the shaft; it was now eight feet deep, and to get into it and out of
            it a short ladder was used. They descended, and by command Fetlock held the
            drill—without any instructions as to the right way to hold it—and Flint
            proceeded to strike. The sledge came down; the drill sprang out of Fetlock's hand,
            almost as a matter of course. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e512">"You mangy son of a nigger, is that any way to hold a drill? Pick it up! Stand it up!
            There—hold fast. D— you! <i>I'll</i> teach you!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e517">At the end of an hour the drilling was finished. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e519">"Now, then, charge it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e521">The boy started to pour in the powder. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e523">"Idiot!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e525">A heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e527">"Get up! You can't lie sniveling there. Now, then, stick in the fuse <i>first. Now</i> put in the powder. Hold on, hold on! Are you going to fill the hole
              <i>all</i> up? Of all the sap-headed milksops I—Put in some
            dirt! Put in some gravel! Tamp it down! Hold on, hold on! Oh, great Scott! get out of
            the way!" He snatched the iron and tamped the charge himself, meantime cursing and
            blaspheming like a fiend. Then he fired the fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and ran
            fifty yards away, Fetlock following. They stood waiting a few minutes, then a great
            volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion; after a
            little there was a shower of descending stones; then all was serene again. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e535">"I wish to God you'd been in it!" remarked the master. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e538">They went down the shaft, cleaned it out, drilled another hole, and put in another
            charge. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e540">"Look here! How much fuse are you proposing to waste? Don't you know how to time a
            fuse?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e542">"No, sir." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e544">"You <i>don't!</i> Well, if you don't beat anything <i>I</i> ever saw!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e552">He climbed out of the shaft and spoke down: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e554">"Well, idiot, are you going to be all day? Cut the fuse and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e556">The trembling creature began: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e558">"If you please, sir, I—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e560">"You talk back to <i>me?</i> Cut it and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e565">The boy cut and lit. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e567">"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! I wish you were in—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e570">In his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft and ran. The boy was aghast. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e572">"Oh, my God! Help. Help! Oh, save me!" he implored. "Oh, what can I do! What <i>can</i> I do!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e577">He backed against the wall as tightly as he could; the sputtering fuse frightened the
            voice out of him; his breath stood still; he stood gazing and impotent; in two seconds,
            three seconds, four he would be flying toward the sky torn to fragments. Then he had an
            inspiration. He sprang at the fuse; severed the inch of it that was left above ground,
            and was saved. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e579">He sank down limp and half lifeless with fright, his strength gone; but he muttered
            with a deep joy: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e581">"He has learnt me! I knew there was a way, if I would wait." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e583">After a matter of five minutes Buckner stole to the shaft, looking worried and uneasy,
            and peered down into it. He took in the situation; he saw what had happened. He lowered
            the ladder, and the boy dragged himself weakly up it. He was very white. His appearance
            added something to Buckner's uncomfortable state, and he said, with a show of regret and
            sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from lack of practice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e585">"It was an accident, you know. Don't say anything about it to anybody; I was excited,
            and didn't notice what I was doing. You're not looking well; you've worked enough for
            to-day; go down to my cabin and eat what you want, and rest. It's just an accident, you
            know, on account of my being excited." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e587">"It scared me," said the lad, as he started away; "but I learnt something, so I don't
            mind it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e589">"Damned easy to please!" muttered Buckner, following him with his eye. I wonder if
            he'll tell? Mightn't he?... I wish it <i>had</i> killed him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e594">The boy took no advantage of his holiday in the matter of resting; he employed it in
            work, eager and feverish and happy work. A thick growth of chaparral extended down the
            mountainside clear to Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's labor was done in the dark
            intricacies of that stubborn growth; the rest of it was done in his own shanty. At last
            all was complete, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e596">"If he's got any suspicions that I'm going to tell on him, he won't keep them long,
            to-morrow. He will see that I am the same milksop as I always was—all day and the
            next. And the day after to-morrow night there 'll be an end of him; nobody will ever
            guess who finished him up nor how it was done. He dropped me the idea his own self, and
            that's odd."</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e602"> From the Springfield <i>Republican,</i> April 12, 1902.</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e607">To the Editor of the
                  Republican:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e610"><i>One of your citizens has asked me a
                  question about the "esophagus," and I wish to answer him through you. This in the
                  hope that the answer will get around, and save me some penmanship, for I have
                  already replied to the same question more than several times, and am not getting
                  as much holiday as I ought to have.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e614"><i>I
                  published a short story lately, and it was in that that I put the esophagus. I
                  will say privately that I expected it to bother some people—in fact, that
                  was the intention—but the harvest has been larger than I was calculating
                  upon. The esophagus has gathered in the guilty and the innocent alike, whereas I
                  was only fishing for the innocent—the innocent and confiding. I knew a few
                  of these would write and ask me; that would give me but little trouble; but, I was
                  not expecting that the wise and the learned would call upon me for succor.
                  However, that has happened, and it is time for me to speak up and stop the
                  inquiries if I can, for letter-writing is not restful to me, and I am not having
                  so much fun out of this thing as I counted on. That you may understand the
                  situation, I will insert a couple of sample inquiries. The first is from a public
                  instructor in the Philippines: </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e618">SANTA CRUZ, <i>Ilocos, Sur, P. I. </i><br><i>February 13,
                  1902</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e626"><i>My dear Sir,—I have just been
                  reading the first part of your latest story, entitled "A Double-barreled Detective
                  Story," and am very much delighted with it. In Part IV, page 264,</i> Harper's
                Magazine <i>for January, occurs this passage: "far in the empty sky a
                  solitary 'esophagus' slept upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness,
                  serenity, and the peace of God." Now, there is one word I do not understand,
                  namely, "esophagus." My only work of reference is the</i> Standard Dictionary,
                  <i>but that fails to explain the meaning. If you can spare the
                  time, I would be glad to have the meaning cleared up, as I consider the passage a
                  very touching and beautiful one. It may seem foolish to you, but consider my lack
                  of means away out in the northern part of Luzon.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e636"><i>Yours very truly.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e640"><i>Do you notice?
                  Nothing in the paragraph disturbed him but that one word. It shows that the
                  paragraph was most ably constructed for the deception it was intended to put upon
                  the reader. It was my intention that it should read plausibly, and it is now plain
                  that it does; it was my intention that it should be emotional and touching, and
                  you see, yourself, that it fetched this public instructor. Alas, If I had but left
                  that one treacherous word out, I should have scored! scored everywhere; and the
                  paragraph would have slidden through every reader's sensibilities like oil, and
                  left not a suspicion behind.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e644"><i>The other sample
                  inquiry is from a professor in a New England university. It contains one naughty
                  word (which I cannot bear to suppress), but he is not in the theological
                  department, so it is no harm:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e648"><i>Dear Mr.
                  Clemens: "Far in the empty sky a "solitary esophagus slept upon motionless
                  wing."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e653"><i>It is not often I get a chance to read
                  much periodical literature, but I have just gone through at this belated period,
                  with much gratification and edification, your "Double-barreled Detective
                  Story."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e657"><i>But what in hell is an esophagus? I
                  keep one myself, but it never sleeps in the air or anywhere else. My profession is
                  to deal with words, and esophagus interested me the moment I lighted upon it. But
                  as a companion of my youth used to say, "I'll be eternally, co-eternally cussed"
                  if l can make it out. Is it a joke, or I an ignoramus?</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e661"><i>Between you and me, I was almost ashamed of having fooled that man,
                  but for pride's sake I was not going to say so. I wrote and told him it was a
                  joke—and that is what I am now saying to my Springfield inquirer. And I told
                  him to carefully read the whole paragraph, and he would find not a vestige of
                  sense in any detail of it. This also I commend to my Springfield
                inquirer.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e665"><i>I have confessed. I am
                  sorry—partially. I will not do so any more—for the present. Don't ask
                  me any more questions; let the esophagus have a rest—on his same old
                  motionless wing. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e669">MARK TWAIN</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e672">New York City, <i>April 10, 1902</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e677"><i>( Editorial

                  appeared in</i> Harper's Magazine <i>for January and February
                  last, is the most elaborate of burlesques on detective fiction, with striking
                  melodramatic passages in which it is difficult to detect the deception, so ably is
                  it done. But the illusion ought not to endure even the first incident in the
                  February number. As for the paragraph which has so admirably illustrated the skill
                  of Mr. Clemens's ensemble and the carelessness of readers, here it
              is:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e688"><i>"It was a crisp and spicy morning in early
                  October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung
                  burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind nature for
                  the wingless wild things that have their home in the tree-tops and would visit
                  together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow flames in
                  brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the sensuous
                  fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere; far
                  in the empty sky a solitary esophagus slept upon motionless wings; everywhere
                  brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e692"><i>The success of Mark Twain's joke recalls to mind his story of the
                  petrified man in the cavern, whom he described most punctiliously, first giving a
                  picture of the scene, its impressive solitude, and all that; then going on to
                  describe the majesty of the figure, casually mentioning that the thumb of his
                  right hand rested against the side of his nose; then after further description
                  observing that the fingers of the right hand were extended in a radiating fashion;
                  and, recurring to the dignified attitude and position of the man, incidentally
                  remarked that the thumb of the left hand was in contact with the little finger of
                  the right—and so on. But was it so ingeniously written that Mark, relating
                  the history years later in an article which appeared in that excellent magazine of
                  the past, the</i> Galaxy, <i>declared that no one ever found out
                  the joke, and, if we remember aright, that that astonishing old mockery was
                  actually looked for in the region where he, as a Nevada newspaper editor, had
                  located it. It is certain that Mark Twain's jumping frog has a good many more
                  "pints" than any other frog.</i></p>Chapter V<p id="TwaDoubd1e702">The next day came and went. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e704">It is now almost midnight, and in five minutes the new morning will begin. The scene is
            in the tavern billiard-room. Rough men in rough clothing, slouch-hats, breeches stuffed
            into boot-tops, some with vests, none with coats, are grouped about the boiler-iron
            stove, which has ruddy cheeks and is distributing a grateful warmth; the billiard-balls
            are clacking; there is no other sound—that is, within; the wind is fitfully
            moaning without. The men look bored; also expectant. A hulking broad-shouldered miner,
            of middle age, with grizzled whiskers, and an unfriendly eye set in an unsociable face,
            rises, slips a coil of fuse upon his arm, gathers up some other personal properties, and
            departs without word or greeting to anybody. It is Flint Buckner. As the door closes
            behind him a buzz of talk breaks out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e706">"The regularest man that ever was," said Jake Parker, the blacksmith: "you can tell
            when it's twelve just by him leaving, without looking at your Waterbury." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e708">"And it's the only virtue he's got, as fur as I know," said Peter Hawes, miner. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e710">"He's just a blight on this society," said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "If I was
            running this shop I'd make him say something, <i>some</i> time or other,
            or vamos the ranch." This with a suggestive glance at the barkeeper, who did not choose
            to see it, since the man under discussion was a good customer, and went home pretty well
            set up, every night, with refreshments furnished from the bar. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e715">"Say," said Ham Sandwich, miner, "does any of you boys ever recollect of him asking you
            to take a drink?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e717"><i>"Him?</i> Flint <i>Buckner?</i> Oh, Laura!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e724">This sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous general outburst in one form of words or
            another from the crowd. After a brief silence, Pat Riley, miner, said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e726">"He's the 15-puzzle, that cuss. And his boy's another one. <i>I
            </i>can't make them out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e731">"Nor anybody else," said Ham Sandwich; "and if they are 15-puzzles how are you going to
            rank up that other one? When it comes to A 1 right-down solid mysteriousness, he lays
            over both of them. <i>Easy—</i>don't he?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e737">"You bet!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e739">Everybody said it. Every man but one. He was the new-comer-Peterson. He ordered the
            drinks all round, and asked who No. 3 might be. All answered at once, "Archy Stillman!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e741">"Is he a mystery?" asked Peterson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e743">"Is <i>he</i> a mystery? Is Archy <i>Stillman a</i>
            mystery?" said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "Why, the fourth dimension's foolishness to
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e754">For Ferguson was learned. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e756">Peterson wanted to hear all about him; everybody wanted to tell him; everybody began.
            But Billy Stevens, the barkeeper, called the house to order, and said one at a time was
            best. He distributed the drinks, and appointed Ferguson to lead. Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e758">"Well, he's a boy. And that is just about all we know about him. You can pump him till
            you are tired; it ain't any use; you won't get anything. At least about his intentions,
            or line of business, or where he's from, and such things as that. And as for getting at
            the nature and get-up of his main big chief mystery, why, he'll just change the subject,
            that's all. You can <i>guess</i> till you're black in the
            face—it's your privilege—but suppose you do, where do you arrive at?
            Nowhere, as near as I can make out," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e763">"What <i>is</i> his big chief one?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e768">"Sight, maybe. Hearing, maybe. Instinct, maybe. Magic, maybe. Take your
            choice—grownups, twenty-five; children and servants, half price. Now I'll tell you
            what he can do. You can start here, and just disappear; you can go and hide wherever you
            want to, I don't care where it is, nor how far—and he'll go straight and put his
            finger on you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e770">"You don't mean it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e772">"I just do, though. Weather's nothing to him—elemental conditions is nothing to
            him—he don't even take notice of them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e775">"Oh, come! Dark? Rain? Snow? Hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e777">"It's all the same to <i>him.</i> He don't give a damn." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e782">"Oh, <i>say—</i>including <i>fog,</i> per'aps?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e790"><i>"Fog!</i> he's got an eye 't can plunk through it like a bullet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e794">"Now, boys, honor bright, what's he giving me?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e796">"It's a fact!" they all shouted. "Go on, Wells-Fargo." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e798">"Well, sir, you can leave him here, chatting with the boys, and you can slip out and go
            to any cabin in this camp and open a book—yes, sir, a dozen of them—and take
            the page in your memory, and he'll start out and go straight to that cabin and open
            every one of them books at the right page, and call it off, and never make a mistake." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e800">"He must be the devil!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e802">"More than one has thought it. Now I'll tell you a perfectly wonderful thing that he
            done. The other night he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e804">There was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside, the door flew open, and an excited
            crowd burst in, with the camp's one white woman in the lead and crying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e806">"My child! my child! she's lost and gone! For the love of God help me to find Archy
            Stillman; we've hunted everywhere!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e809">Said the barkeeper: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e811">"Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, and don't worry. He asked for a bed three hours ago,
            tuckered out tramping the trails the way he's always doing, and went up-stairs. Ham
            Sandwich, run up and roust him out; he's in No. 14." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e813">The youth was soon down-stairs and ready. He asked Mrs. Hogan for particulars. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e815">"Bless you, dear, there ain't any; I wish there was. I put her to sleep at seven in the
            evening, and when I went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself, she was gone. I
            rushed for your cabin, dear, and you wasn't there, and I've hunted for you ever since,
            at every cabin down the gulch, and now I've come up again, and I'm that distracted and
            scared and heartbroke; but, thanks to God, I've found you at last, dear heart, and
            you'll find my child. Come on! come quick!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e817">"Move right along; I'm with you, madam. Go to your cabin first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e819">The whole company streamed out to join the hunt. All the southern half of the village
            was up, a hundred men strong, and waiting outside, a vague dark mass sprinkled with
            twinkling lanterns. The mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself
            to the narrow road, and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders. In a
            few minutes the Hogan cabin was reached. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e821">"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Hogan; "there's where she was; it's where I laid her at
            seven o'clock; but where she is now, God only knows." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e823">"Hand me a lantern," said Archy. He set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it,
            pretending to examine the ground closely. "Here's her track," he said, touching the
            ground here and there and yonder with his finger. "Do you see?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e825">Several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see. One or two
            thought they discerned something like a track; the others shook their heads and
            confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp
            enough to discover. One said, "Maybe a child's foot could make a mark on it, but <i>I</i> don't see how." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e830">Young Stillman stepped outside, held the light to the ground, turned leftward, and
            moved three steps, closely examining; then said, "I've got the direction—come
            along; take the lantern, somebody." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e832">He strode off swiftly southward, the files following, swaying and bending in and out
            with the deep curves of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the mouth of the gorge was reached;
            before them stretched the sagebrush plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman called a halt,
            saying, "We mustn't start wrong, now; we must take the direction again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e835">He took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards; then said,
            "Come on; it's all right," and gave up the lantern. In and out among the sage-bushes he
            marched, a quarter of a mile, bearing gradually to the right; then took a new direction
            and made another great semicircle; then changed again and moved due west nearly half a
            mile—and stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e837">"She gave it up, here, poor little chap. Hold the lantern. You can see where she sat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e839">But this was in a slick alkali flat which was surfaced like steel, and no person in the
            party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a
            cushion on a veneer like that. The bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the
            spot, lamenting. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e841">"But where is she, then?" some one said. "She didn't stay here. We can see <i>that</i> much, anyway." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e846">Stillman moved about in a circle around the place, with the lantern, pretending to hunt
            for tracks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e848">"Well!" he said presently, in an annoyed tone, "I don't understand it." He examined
            again. "No use. She was here—that's certain; she never <i>walked</i> away from here—and that's certain. It's a puzzle; I can't make it
            out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e853">The mother lost heart then. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e855">"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! some flying beast has got her. I'll never see her
            again!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e857">"Ah, <i>don't</i> give up," said Archy. "We'll find her—don't
            give up." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e862">"God bless you for the words, Archy Stillman!" and she seized his hand and kissed it
            fervently. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e864">Peterson, the new-comer, whispered satirically in Ferguson's ear: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e867">"Wonderful performance to find this place, wasn't it? Hardly worth while to come so
            far, though; any other supposititious place would have answered just as well—hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e869">Ferguson was not pleased with the innuendo. He said, with some warmth: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e871">"Do you mean to insinuate that the child hasn't been here? I tell you the child <i>has</i> been here! Now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a
            little fuss as—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e876">"All right!" sang out Stillman. "Come, everybody, and look at this! It was right under
            our noses all the time, and we didn't see it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e878">There was a general plunge for the ground at the place where the child was alleged to
            have rested, and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to see the thing that Archy's finger
            was resting upon. There was a pause, then a several-barreled sigh of disappointment. Pat
            Riley and Ham Sandwich said, in the one breath: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e880">"What is it, Archy? There's nothing here." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e882">"Nothing? Do you call <i>that</i> nothing?" and he swiftly traced upon
            the ground a form with his finger. "There—don't you recognize it now? It's Injun
            Billy's track. He's got the child." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e887">"God be praised !" from the mother. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e889">"Take away the lantern. I've got the direction. Follow!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e891">He started on a run, racing in and out among the sage-bushes a matter of three hundred
            yards, and disappeared over a sand-wave; the others struggled after him, caught him up,
            and found him waiting. Ten steps away was a little wickiup, a dim and formless shelter
            of rags and old horse-blankets, a dull light showing through its chinks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e893">"You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the lad. "It's your privilege to be first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e896">All followed the sprint she made for the wickiup, and saw, with her, the picture its
            interior afforded. Injun Billy was sitting on the ground; the child was asleep beside
            him. The mother hugged it with a wild embrace, which included Archy Stillman, the
            grateful tears running down her face, and in a choked and broken voice she poured out a
            golden stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments which has its home in full
            richness nowhere but in the Irish heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e898">"I find her bymeby it is ten o'clock," Billy explained. "She 'sleep out yonder, ve'y
            tired—face wet, been cryin', 'spose; fetch her home, feed her, she heap much
            hungry—go 'sleep 'gin." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e900">In her limitless gratitude the happy mother waived rank and hugged him too, calling him
            "the angel of God in disguise." And he probably was in disguise if he was that kind of
            an official. He was dressed for the character. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e902">At half past one in the morning the procession burst into the village singing, "When
            Johnny Comes Marching Home," waving its lanterns and swallowing the drinks that were
            brought out all along its course. It concentrated at the tavern, and made a night of
            what was left of the morning.</p>Chapter VI<p id="TwaDoubd1e907">The next afternoon the village was electrified with an immense sensation. A grave and
            dignified foreigner of distinguished bearing and appearance had arrived at the tavern,
            and entered this formidable name upon the register: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e909">SHERLOCK HOLMES
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e913">The news buzzed from cabin to cabin, from claim to claim; tools were dropped, and the
            town swarmed toward the center of interest. A man passing out at the northern end of the
            village shouted it to Pat Riley, whose claim was the next one to Flint Buckner's. At
            that time Fetlock Jones seemed to turn sick. He muttered to himself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e915">"Uncle <i>Sherlock!</i> The mean luck of it!—that <i>he </i>should come just when..." He dropped into a reverie, and
            presently said to himself: "But what's the use of being afraid of <i>him?
            </i>Anybody that knows him the way I do knows he can't detect a crime except where he
            plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and hires some fellow to commit it
            according to instructions.... Now there ain't going to <i>be</i> any
            clues this time—so, what show has he got? None at all. No, sir; everything's
            ready. If I was to risk putting it off—...No, I won't run any risk like that.
            Flint Buckner goes out of this world to-night, for sure." Then another trouble presented
            itself. "Uncle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening, and
            how am I going to get rid of him? for I've <i>got</i> to be at my cabin
            a minute or two about eight o'clock." This was an awkward matter, and cost him much
            thought. But he found a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll go for a walk, and I'll leave
            him in the road a minute, so that he won't see what it is I do: the best way to throw a
            detective off the track, anyway, is to have him along when you are preparing the thing.
            Yes, that's the safest—I'll take him with me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e932">Meantime the road in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping
            for a glimpse of the great man. But he kept his room, and did not appear. None but
            Ferguson, Jake Parker the blacksmith, and Ham Sandwich had any luck. These enthusiastic
            admirers of the great scientific detective hired the tavern's detained-baggage lockup,
            which looked into the detective's room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide,
            ambushed themselves in it, and cut some peep-holes in the window-blind. Mr. Holmes's
            blinds were down; but by and by he raised them. It gave the spies a hair-lifting but
            pleasurable thrill to find themselves face to face with the Extraordinary Man who had
            filled the world with the fame of his more than human ingenuities. There he
            sat—not a myth, not a shadow, but real, alive, compact of substance, and almost
            within touching distance with the hand. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e934">"Look at that head!" said Ferguson, in an awed voice. "By gracious! <i>that's</i> a head!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e939">"You bet!" said the blacksmith, with deep reverence. "Look at his nose! look at his
            eyes! Intellect? Just a battery of it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e941">"And that paleness," said Ham Sandwich. "Comes from thought—that's what it comes
            from. Hell! duffers like us don't know what real thought <i>is."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e946">"No more we don't," said Ferguson. "What we take for thinking is just
            blubber-and-slush," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e948">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo. And look at that frown—that's <i>deep</i> thinking—away down, down, forty fathom into the bowels of things.
            He's on the track of something." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e954">"Well, he is, and don't you forget it. Say—look at that awful gravity—look
            at that pallid solemness—there ain't any corpse can lay over it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e956">"No, sir, not for dollars! And it's his'n by hereditary rights, too; he's been dead
            four times a'ready, and there's history for it. Three times natural, once by accident.
            I've heard say he smells damp and cold, like a grave. And he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e958">" 'Sh! Watch him! There—he's got his thumb on the bump on the near corner of his
            forehead, and his forefinger on the off one. His think-works is just a-<i>grinding</i> now, you bet your other shirt." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e963">"That's so. And now he's gazing up toward heaven and stroking his mustache slow,
            and—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e965">"Now he has rose up standing, and is putting his clues together on his left fingers
            with his right finger. See? he touches the forefinger—now middle finger—now
            ring-finger—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e967">"Stuck!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e969">"Look at him scowl! He can't seem to make out <i>that</i> clue. So
            he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e974">"See him smile!—like a tiger—and tally off the other fingers like nothing!
            He's got it, boys; he's got it sure!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e976">"Well, I should <i>say!</i> I'd hate to be in that man's place that
            he's after." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e981">Mr. Holmes drew a table to the window, sat down with his back to the spies, and
            proceeded to write. The spies withdrew their eyes from the peep-holes, lit their pipes,
            and settled themselves for a comfortable smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with conviction: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e983">"Boys, it's no use talking, he's a wonder! He's got the signs of it all over him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e986">"You hain't ever said a truer word than that, Wells-Fargo," said Jake Parker. "Say,
            wouldn't it 'a' been nuts if he'd a-been here last night?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e988">"Oh, by George, but wouldn't it!" said Ferguson. "Then we'd have seen <i>scientific</i> work. Intellect—just pure intellect—away up on the upper
            levels, dontchuknow. Archy is all right, and it don't become anybody to belittle <i>him,</i> I can tell you. But his gift is only just eyesight, sharp as
            an owl's, as near as I can make it out just a grand natural animal talent, no more, no
            less, and prime as far as it goes, but no intellect in it, and for awfulness and
            marvelousness no more to be compared to what this man does than—than—Why,
            let me tell you what <i>he'd</i> have done. He'd have stepped over to
            Hogan's and glanced—just <i>glanced,</i> that's all—at the
            premises, and that's enough. See everything? Yes, sir, to the last little detail; and
            he'll know more about that place than the Hogans would know in seven years. Next, he
            would sit down on the bunk, just as ca'm, and say to Mrs. Hogan—<i>Say,</i> Ham, consider that you are Mrs. Hogan. I'll ask the questions; you answer
            them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1005">"All right; go on." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1007">" 'Madam, if you please—attention—do not let your mind wander. Now,
            then—sex of the child?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1009">" 'Female, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1011">" 'Um—female. Very good, very good. Age?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1013">" 'Turned six, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1015">" 'Um—young, weak—two miles. Weariness will overtake it then. It will sink
            down and sleep. We shall find it two miles away, or less. Teeth?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1017">" 'Five, your Honor, and one a-coming.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1019">" 'Very good, very good, <i>very</i> good, indeed.' You see, boys, <i>he</i> knows a clue when he sees it, when it wouldn't mean a dern thing
            to anybody else. 'Stockings, madam? Shoes?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1027">" 'Yes, your Honor—both.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1030">" 'Yarn, perhaps? Morocco?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1032">" 'Yarn, your Honor. And kip.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1034">" 'Um—kip. This complicates the matter. However, let it go—we shall manage.
            Religion?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1036">" 'Catholic, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1038">" 'Very good. Snip me a bit from the bed blanket, please. Ah, thanks. Part
            wool—foreign make. Very well. A snip from some garment of the child's, please.
            Thanks. Cotton. Shows wear. An excellent clue, excellent. Pass me a pallet of the floor
            dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, many thanks. Ah, admirable, admirable! <i>Now</i> we know where we are, I think.' You see, boys, he's got all the
            clues he wants now; he don't need anything more. Now, then, what does this Extraordinary
            Man do? He lays those snips and that dirt out on the table and leans over them on his
            elbows, and puts them together side by side and studies them—mumbles to himself,
            'Female'; changes them around—mumbles, 'Six years old'; changes them this way and
            that—again mumbles: 'Five teeth—one
            a-coming—Catholic—yarn—cotton—kip—damn that kip.' Then he
            straightens up and gazes toward heaven, and plows his hands through his hair—plows
            and plows, muttering, 'Damn that kip!' Then he stands up and frowns, and begins to tally
            off his clues on his fingers—and gets stuck at the ring-finger. But only just a
            minute—then his face glares all up in a smile like a house afire, and he
            straightens up stately and majestic, and says to the crowd, 'Take a lantern, a couple of
            you, and go down to Injun Billy's and fetch the child—the rest of you go 'long
            home to bed; good-night, madam; good-night, gents.' And he bows like the Matterhorn, and
            pulls out for the tavern. That's <i>his</i> style, and the <i>Only—</i>scientific, intellectual—all over in fifteen
            minutes—no poking around all over the sage-brush range an hour and a half in a
            mass-meeting crowd for <i>him,</i> boys—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1055">"By Jackson, it's grand!" said Ham Sandwich. "Wells-Fargo, you've got him down to a
            dot. He ain't painted up any exacter to the life in the books. By George, I can juse <i>see</i> him—can't you, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1060">"You bet you! It's just a photograft, that's what it is." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1062">Ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success, and grateful. He sat silently
            enjoying his happiness a little while, then he murmured, with a deep awe in his voice, </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1064">"I wonder if God made him?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1066">There was no response for a moment; then Ham Sandwich said, reverently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1068">"Not all at one time, I reckon."</p>Chapter VII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1073">At eight o'clock that evening two persons were groping their way past Flint Buckner's
            cabin in the frosty gloom. They were Sherlock Holmes and his nephew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1075">"Stop here in the road a moment, uncle," said Fetlock, "while I run to my cabin; I
            won't be gone a minute." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1077">He asked for something—the uncle furnished it—then he disappeared in the
            darkness, but soon returned, and the talking-walk was resumed. By nine o'clock they had
            wandered back to the tavern. They worked their way through the billiard-room, where a
            crowd had gathered in the hope of getting a glimpse of the Extraordinary Man. A royal
            cheer was raised. Mr. Holmes acknowledged the compliment with a series of courtly bows,
            and as he was passing out his nephew said to the assemblage: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1079">"Uncle Sherlock's got some work to do, gentlemen, that 'll keep him till twelve or one;
            but he'll be down again then, or earlier if he can, and hopes some of you'll be left to
            take a drink with him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1081">"By George, he's just a duke, boys! Three cheers for Sherlock Holmes, the greatest man
            that ever lived!" shouted Ferguson. "Hip, hip, hip—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1083">"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Tiger!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1085">The uproar shook the building, so hearty was the feeling the boys put into their
            welcome. Up-stairs the uncle reproached the nephew gently, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1087">"What did you get me into that engagement for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1089">"I reckon you don't want to be unpopular, do you, uncle? Well, then, don't you put on
            any exclusiveness in a mining-camp, that's all. The boys admire you; but if you was to
            leave without taking a drink with them, they'd set you down for a snob. And besides, you
            said you had home talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1091">The boy was right, and wise—the uncle acknowledged it. The boy was wise in
            another detail which he did not mention—except to himself: "Uncle and the others
            will come handy—in the way of nailing an <i>alibi </i>where it
            can't be budged." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1097">He and his uncle talked diligently about three hours. Then, about midnight, Fetlock
            stepped down-stairs and took a position in the dark a dozen steps from the tavern, and
            waited. Five minutes later Flint Buckner came rocking out of the billiard-room and
            almost brushed him as he passed. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1099">"I've <i>got</i> him!" muttered the boy. He continued to himself,
            looking after the shadowy form: "Good-by—good-by for good, Flint Buckner; you
            called my mother a—well, never mind what: it's all right, now; you're taking your
            last walk, friend." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1104">He went musing back into the tavern. "From now till one is an hour. We'll spend it with
            the boys; it's good for the <i>alibi."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1109">He brought Sherlock Holmes to the billiard-room, which was jammed with eager and
            admiring miners; the guest called the drinks, and the fun began. Everybody was happy;
            everybody was complimentary; the ice was soon broken, songs, anecdotes, and more drinks
            followed, and the pregnant minutes flew. At six minutes to one, when the jollity was at
            its highest— </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1111"><i>Boom!</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1115">There was silence instantly. The deep sound came rolling and rumbling frown peak to
            peak up the gorge, then died down, and ceased. The spell broke, then, and the men made a
            rush for the door, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1117">"Something's blown up!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1119">Outside, a voice in the darkness said, "It's away down the gorge; I saw the flash." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1121">The crowd poured down the cañon—Holmes, Fetlock, Archy Stillman,
            everybody. They made the mile in a few minutes. By the light of a lantern they found the
            smooth and solid dirt floor of Flint Buckner's cabin; of the cabin itself not a vestige
            remained, not a rag nor a splinter. Nor any sign of Flint. Search-parties sought here
            and there and yonder, and presently a cry went up. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1123">"Here he is!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1125">It was true. Fifty yards down the gulch they had found him—that is, they had
            found a crushed and lifeless mass which represented him. Fetlock Jones hurried thither
            with the others and looked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1128">The inquest was a fifteen-minute affair. Ham Sandwich, foreman of the jury, handed up
            the verdict, which was phrased with a certain unstudied literary grace, and closed with
            this finding, to wit: that "deceased came to his death by his own act or some other
            person or persons unknown to this jury not leaving any family or similar effects behind
            but his cabin which was blown away and God have mercy on his soul amen." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1130">Then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd, for the storm-center of interest was
            there—Sherlock Holmes. The miners stood silent and reverent in a half-circle,
            inclosing a large vacant space which included the front exposure of the site of the late
            premises. In this considerable space the Extraordinary Man was moving about, attended by
            his nephew with a lantern. With a tape he took measurements of the cabin site; of the
            distance from the wall of chaparral to the road; of the height of the chaparral bushes;
            also various other measurements. He gathered a rag here, a splinter there, and a pinch
            of earth yonder, inspected them profoundly, and preserved them. He took the "lay" of the
            place with a pocket-compass, allowing two seconds for magnetic variation. He took the
            time (Pacific) by his watch, correcting it for local time. He paced off the distance
            from the cabin site to the corpse, and corrected that for tidal differentiation. He took
            the altitude with a pocket-aneroid, and the temperature with a pocket-thermometer.
            Finally he said, with a stately bow: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1132">"It is finished. Shall we return, gentlemen?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1134">He took up the line of march for the tavern, and the crowd fell into his wake,
            earnestly discussing and admiring the Extraordinary Man, and interlarding guesses as to
            the origin of the tragedy and who the author of it might he. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1136">"My, but it's grand luck having him here—hey, boys?" said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1138">"It's the biggest thing of the century," said Ham Sandwich. "It 'll go all over the
            world; you mark my words." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1140"><i>"You</i> bet!" said Jake Parker, the blacksmith. "It 'll boom this
            camp. Ain't it so, Wells-Fargo?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1144">"Well, as you want my opinion—if it's any sign of how <i>I
            </i>think about it, I can tell you this: yesterday I was holding the Straight Flush
            claim at two dollars a foot; I'd like to see the man that can get it at sixteen to-day." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1149">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo! It's the grandest luck a new camp ever struck. Say, did
            you see him collar them little rags and dirt and things? What an eye! He just can't
            overlook a clue—'tain't <i>in </i>him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1154">"That's so. And they wouldn't mean a thing to anybody else; but to him, why, they're
            just a book—large print at that." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1156">"Sure's you're born! Them odds and ends have got their little old secret, and they
            think there ain't anybody can pull it; but, land! when he sets his grip there they've
            got to squeal, and don't you forget it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1159">"Boys, I ain't sorry, now, that he wasn't here to roust out the child; this is a bigger
            thing, by a long sight. Yes, sir, and more tangled up and scientific and intellectual." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1161">"I reckon we're all of us glad it's turned out this way. Glad? 'George! it ain't any
            name for it. Dontchuknow, Archy could 've <i>learnt</i> something if
            he'd had the nous to stand by and take notice of how that man works the system. But no;
            he went poking up into the chaparral and just missed the whole thing." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1166">"It's true as gospel; I seen it myself. Well, Archy's young. He'll know better one of
            these days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1168">"Say, boys, who do you reckon done it?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1170">That was a difficult question, and brought out a world of unsatisfying conjecture.
            Various men were mentioned as possibilities, but one by one they were discarded as not
            being eligible. No one but young Hillyer had been intimate with Flint Buckner; no one
            had really had a quarrel with him; he had affronted every man who had tried to make up
            to him, although not quite offensively enough to require bloodshed. There was one name
            that was upon every tongue from the start, but it <i>was</i> the last to
            get utterance—Fetlock Jones's. It was Pat Riley that mentioned it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1175">"Oh, well," the boys said, "of course we've all thought of him, because he had a
            million rights to kill Flint Buckner, and it was just his plain duty to do it. But all
            the same there's two things we can't get around: for one thing, he hasn't got the sand;
            and for another, he wasn't anywhere near the place when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1177">"I know it," said Pat. "He was there in the billiard-room with us when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1179">"Yes, and was there all the time for an hour <i>before</i> it
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1184">"It's so. And lucky for him, too. He'd have been suspected in a minute if it hadn't
            been for that."</p>Chapter VIII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1189">The tavern dining-room had been cleared of all its furniture save one six-foot pine
            table and a chair. This table was against one end of the room; the chair was on it;
            Sherlock Holmes, stately, imposing, impressive, sat in the chair. The public stood. The
            room was full. The tobacco-smoke was dense, the stillness profound. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1191">The Extraordinary Man raised his hand to command additional silence; held it in the air
            a few moments; then, in brief, crisp terms he put forward question after question, and
            noted the answers with "Um-ums," nods of the head, and so on. By this process he learned
            all about Flint Buckner, his character, conduct, and habits, that the people were able
            to tell him. It thus transpired that the Extraordinary Man's nephew was the only person
            in the camp who had a killing-grudge against Flint Buckner. Mr. Holmes smiled
            compassionately upon the witness, and asked, languidly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1193">"Do any of you gentlemen chance to know where the lad Fetlock Jones was at the time of
            the explosion?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1195">A thunderous response followed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1197">"In the billiard-room of this house!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1199">"Ah. And had he just come in?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1201">"Been there all of an hour!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1203">"Ah. It is about—about—well, about how far might it be to the scene of the
            explosions" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1205">"All of a mile!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1207">"Ah. It isn't <i>much</i> of an alibi, 'tis true, but—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1213">A storm-burst of laughter, mingled with shouts of "By jiminy, but he's
            chain-lightning!" and "Ain't you sorry you spoke, Sandy?" shut off the rest of the
            sentence, and the crushed witness drooped his blushing face in pathetic shame. The
            inquisitor resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1215">"The lad Jones's somewhat <i>distant</i> connection with the case"
              (laughter<i>) "</i>having been disposed of, let us now call the
            eye-witnesses of the tragedy, and listen to what they have to say." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1223">He got out his fragmentary clues and arranged them on a sheet of cardboard on his knee.
            The house held its breath and watched. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1225">"We have the longitude and the latitude, corrected for magnetic variation, and this
            gives us the exact location of the tragedy. We have the altitude, the temperature, and
            the degree of humidity prevailing—inestimably valuable, since they enable us to
            estimate with precision the degree of influence which they would exercise upon the mood
            and disposition of the assassin at that time of the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1227"><i>(Buzz of admiration; muttered remark, "By George, but he's
              deep.")</i> He fingered his clues. "And now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak
            to us. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1231">"Here we have an empty linen shot-bag. What is its message? This: that robbery was the
            motive, not revenge. What is its further message? This: that the assassin was of
            inferior intelligence—shall we say light-witted, or perhaps approaching that? How
            do we know this? Because a person of sound intelligence would not have proposed to rob
            the man Buckner, who never had much money with him. But the assassin might have been a
            stranger? Let the bag speak again. I take from it this article. It is a bit of
            silver-bearing quartz. It is peculiar. Examine it, please—you—and
            you—and you. Now pass it back, please. There is but one lode on this coast which
            produces just that character and color of quartz; and that is a lode which crops out for
            nearly two miles on a stretch, and in my opinion is destined, at no distant day, to
            confer upon its locality a globe-girdling celebrity, and upon its two hundred owners
            riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Name that lode, please." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1233">"The Consolidated Christian Science and Mary Ann!" was the prompt response. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1235">A wild crash of hurrahs followed, and every man reached for his neighbor's hand and
            wrung it, with tears in his eyes; and Wells-Fargo Ferguson shouted, "The Straight Flush
            is on the lode, and up she goes to a hunched and fifty a foot—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1240">When quiet fell, Mr. Holmes resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1242">"We perceive, then, that three facts are established, to wit: the assassin was
            approximately light-witted; he was not a stranger; his motive was robbery, not revenge.
            Let us proceed. I hold in my hand a small fragment of fuse, with the recent smell of
            fire upon it. What is its testimony? Taken with the corroborative evidence of the
            quartz, it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner. What does it tell us further?
            This, gentlemen: that the assassination was consummated by means of an explosive. What
            else does it say? This: that the explosive was located against the side of the cabin
            nearest the road—the front side—for within six feet of that spot I found it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1244">"I hold in my fingers a burnt Swedish match—the kind one rubs on a safety-box. I
            found it in the road, six hundred and twenty-two feet from the abolished cabin. What
            does it say? This: that the train was fired from that point. What further does it tell
            us? This: that the assassin was left-handed. How do I know this? I should not be able to
            explain to you, gentlemen, how I know it, the signs being so subtle that only long
            experience and deep study can enable one to detect them. But the signs are here, and
            they are reinforced by a fact which you must have often noticed in the great detective
            narratives—that <i>all </i>assassins are left-handed." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1250">"By Jackson, <i>that's</i> so." said Ham Sandwich, bringing his great
            hand down with a resounding slap upon his thigh; "blamed if I ever thought of it
            before." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1255">"Nor I!" "Nor I!" cried several. "Oh, there can't anything escape <i>him—</i>look at his eye!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1260">"Gentlemen, distant as the murderer was from his doomed victim, he did not wholly
            escape injury. This fragment of wood which I now exhibit to you struck him. It drew
            blood. Wherever he is, he bears the telltale mark. I picked it up where he stood when he
            fired the fatal train," He looked out over the house from his high perch, and his
            countenance began to darken; he slowly raised his hand, and pointed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1262">"There stands the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1264">For a moment the house was paralyzed with amazement; then twenty voices burst out with: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1266">"Sammy Hillyer? Oh, <i>hell,</i> no! <i>Him?</i> It's
            pure foolishness!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1274">"Take care, gentlemen—be not hasty. Observe—he has the blood-mark on his
            brow." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1276">Hillyer turned white with fright. He was near to crying. He turned this way and that,
            appealing to every face for help and sympathy; and held out his supplicating hands
            toward Holmes and began to plead: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1278"><i>"Don't,</i> oh, don't! I never did it; I give my word I never did
            it. The way I got this hurt on my forehead was—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1282">"Arrest him, constable!" cried Holmes. "I will swear out the warrant" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1284">The constable moved reluctantly forward—hesitated—stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1287">Hillyer broke out with another appeal. "Oh, Archy, don't let them do it; it would kill
            mother! <i>You</i> know how I got the hurt. Tell them, and save me,
            Archy; save me!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1292">Stillman worked his way to the front, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1294">"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be afraid." Then he said to the house, "Never mind how he
            got the hurt; it hasn't anything to do with this case, and isn't of any consequence." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1296">"God bless you, Archy, for a true friend!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1298">"Hurrah for Archy! Go in, boy, and play 'em a knock-down flush to their two pair 'n' a
            jack!" shouted the house, pride in their home talent and a patriotic sentiment of
            loyalty to it rising suddenly in the public heart and changing the whole attitude of the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1300">Young Stillman waited for the noise to cease; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1302">"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand by that door yonder, and Constable Harris to stand by
            the other one here, and not let anybody leave the room. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1304">"Said and done. Go on, old man!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1306">"The criminal is present, I believe. I will show him to you before long, in case I am
            right in my guess. Now I will tell you all about the tragedy, from start to finish. The
            motive <i>wasn't </i>robbery; it was revenge. The murderer <i>wasn't</i> light-witted. He <i>didn't</i> stand six
            hundred and twenty-two feet away. He <i>didn't </i>get hit with a piece
            of wood. He <i>didn't</i> place the explosive against the cabin. He <i>didn't</i> bring a shot-bag with him, and he <i>wasn't</i> left-handed. With the exception of these errors, the distinguished
            guest's statement of the case is substantially correct." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1330">A comfortable laugh rippled over the house; friend nodded to friend, as much as to say,
            "That's the word, with the bark <i>on</i> it. Good lad, good boy. <i>He</i> ain't lowering his flag any!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1338">The guest's serenity was not disturbed. Stillman resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1341">"I also have some witnesses; and I will presently tell you where you can find some
            more." He held up a piece of coarse wire; the crowd craned their necks to see. "It has a
            smooth coating of melted tallow on it. And here is a candle which is burned half-way
            down. The remaining half of it has marks cut upon it an inch apart. Soon I will tell you
            where I found these things. I will now put aside reasonings, guesses, the impressive
            hitchings of odds and ends of clues together, and the other showy theatricals of the
            detective trade, and tell you in a plain, straightforward way just how this dismal thing
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1343">He paused a moment, for effect—to allow silence and suspense to intensify and
            concentrate the house's interest; then he went on: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1345">"The assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains. It was a good plan, very
            ingenious, and showed an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. It was a plan which was
            well calculated to ward off all suspicion from its inventor. In the <i>first</i> place, he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart, and lit it and timed
            it. He found it took three hours to burn four inches of it. I tried it myself for half
            an hour, awhile ago, up-stairs here, while the inquiry into Flint Buckner's character
            and ways was being conducted in this room, and I arrived in that way at the rate of a
            candle's consumption when sheltered from the wind. Having proved his trial candle's
            rate, he blew it out—I have already shown it to you—and put <i>his</i> inch-marks on a fresh one. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1353">"He put the fresh one into a tin candlestick. Then at the five-hour mark he bored a
            hole through the candle with a red-hot wire. I have already shown you the wire, with a
            smooth coat of tallow on it—tallow that had been melted and had cooled. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1355">"With labor—very hard labor, I should say—he struggled up through the stiff
            chaparral that clothes the steep hillside back of Flint Buckner's place, tugging an
            empty flour-barrel with him. He placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place, and in
            the bottom of it he set the candlestick. Then he measured off about thirty-five feet of
            fuse—the barrel's distance from the back of the cabin. He bored a hole in the side
            of the barrel—here is the large gimlet he did it with. He went on and finished his
            work; and when it was done, one end of the fuse was in Buckner's cabin, and the other
            end, with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder, was in the hole in the
            candle—timed to blow the place up at one o'clock this morning, provided the candle
            was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening—which I am betting it was—and
            provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the
            fuse—which I am also betting there was, though I can't prove it. Boys, the barrel
            is there in the chaparral, the candle's remains are in it in the tin stick; the
            burnt-out fuse is in the gimlet-hole, the other end is down the hill where the late
            cabin stood. I saw them all an hour or two ago, when the Professor here was measuring
            off unimplicated vacancies and collecting relics that hadn't anything to do with the
            case." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1357">He paused. The house drew a long, deep breath, shook its strained cords and muscles
            free and burst into cheers. "Dang him!" said Ham Sandwich, "that's why he was snooping
            around in the chaparral, instead of picking up points out of the P'fessor's game. Looky
            here—he ain't no fool, boys." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1359">"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1361">But Stillman was resuming: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1363">"While we were out yonder an hour or two ago, the owner of the gimlet and the trial
            candle took them from a place where he had concealed them—it was not a good
            place—and carried them to what he probably thought was a better one, two hundred
            yards up in the pine woods, and hid them there, covering them over with pine needles. It
            was there that I found them. The gimlet exactly fits the hole in the barrel. And
            now—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1365">The Extraordinary Man interrupted him. He said, sarcastically: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1367">"We have had a very pretty fairy tale, gentlemen—very pretty indeed. Now I would
            like to ask this young man a question or two." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1370">Some of the boys winced, and Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1372">"I'm afraid Archy's going to catch it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1374">The others lost their smiles and sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1376">"Let us proceed to examine into this fairy tale in a consecutive and orderly
            way—by geometrical progression, so to speak—linking detail to detail in a
            steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent and unassailable march upon this tinsel
            toy fortress of error, the dream fabric of a callow imagination. To begin with, young
            sir, I desire to ask you but three questions at present—<i>at
              present.</i> Did I understand you to say it was your opinion that the supposititious
            candle was lighted at about eight o'clock yesterday evening?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1381">"Yes, sir—about eight." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1383">"Could you say exactly eight?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1385">"Well, no, I couldn't be that exact." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1387">"Um. If a person had been passing along there just about that time, he would have been
            almost sure to encounter that assassin, do you think?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1389">"Yes, I should think so." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1391">"Thank you, that is all. For the present. I say, all <i>for the
              present."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1396">"Dern him. he's laying for Archy," said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1399">"It's so," said Ham Sandwich. "I don't like the look of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1401">Stillman said, glancing at the guest, "I was along there myself at half-past
            eight—no, about nine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1403">"In-deed? This is interesting—this is very interesting. Perhaps you encountered
            the assassin?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1405">"No, I encountered no one." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1407">"Ah. Then—if you will excuse the remark—I do not quite see the relevancy of
            the information." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1409">"It has none. At present. I say it has none—at present." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1411">He paused. Presently he resumed: "I did not encounter the assassin, but I am on his
            track, I am sure, for I believe he is in this room. I will ask you all to pass one by
            one in front of me—here, where there is a good light—so that I can see your
            feet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1413">A buzz of excitement swept the place, and the march began, the guest looking on with an
            iron attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified success. Stillman stooped, shaded
            his eyes with his hand, and gazed down intently at each pair of feet as it passed. Fifty
            men tramped monotonously by—with no result. Sixty. Seventy. The thing was
            beginning to look absurd. The guest remarked, with suave irony:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1415">"Stillman Accuses Sherlock Holmes"Image of Stillman pointing a finger at Sherlock Holmes</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1421">"Assassins appear to be scarce this evening." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1423">The house saw the humor if it, and refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. Ten or twelve
            more candidates tramped by—no, <i>danced </i>by, with airy and
            ridiculous capers which convulsed the spectators—then suddenly Stillman put out
            his hand and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1429">"This is the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1431">"Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhedrim!" roared the crowd; and at once let fly a
            pyrotechnic explosion and dazzle and confusion of stirring remarks inspired by the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1433">At the height of the turmoil the guest stretched out his hand, commanding peace. The
            authority of a great name and a great personality laid its mysterious compulsion upon
            the house, and it obeyed. Out of the panting calm which succeeded, the guest spoke,
            saying, with dignity and feeling: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1435"><i>"This</i> is serious. It strikes at an innocent life. Innocent
            beyond suspicion! Innocent beyond peradventure! Hear me <i>prove</i> it;
            observe how simple a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie. Listen. My
            friends, that lad was never out of my sight yesterday evening at <i>any</i> time!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1445">It made a deep impression. Men turned their eyes upon Stillman with grave inquiry in
            them. His face brightened, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1447">"I <i>knew</i> there was another one!" He stepped briskly to the table
            and glanced at the guest's feet, then up at his face, and said: "You were <i>with</i> him! You were not fifty steps from him when he lit the candle
            that by and by fired the powder!" <i>(Sensation.) "</i>And what is more,
            you furnished the matches yourself !" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1458">Plainly the guest seemed hit; it looked so to the public. He opened his mouth to speak;
            the words did not come freely. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1460">"This—er—this is insanity—this—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1462">Stillman pressed his evident advantage home. He held up a charred match. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1464">"Here <i>is</i> one of them. I found it in the barrel—and there's
              <i>another</i> one there." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1472">The guest found his voice at once. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1475"><i>"Yes—</i>and put them there yourself!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1479">It was recognized a good shot. Stillman retorted. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1481">"It is <i>wax—</i>a breed unknown to this camp. I am ready to be
            searched for the box. Are you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1486">The guest was staggered this time—the dullest eye could see it. He fumbled with
            his hands; once or twice his lips moved, but the words did not come. The house waited
            and watched, in tense suspense, the stillness adding effect to the situation. Presently
            Stillman said, gently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1488">"We are waiting for your decision." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1490">There was silence again during several moments; then the guest answered, in a low
            voice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1492">"I refuse to be searched." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1494">There was no noisy demonstration, but all about the house one voice after another
            muttered: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1496">"That settles it! He's Archy's meat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1498">What to do now? Nobody seemed to know. It was an embarrassing situation for the
            moment—merely, of course, because matters had taken such a sudden and unexpected
            turn that these unpractised minds were not prepared for it, and had come to a
            standstill, like a stopped clock, under the shock. But after a little the machinery
            began to work again, tentatively, and by twos and threes the men put their heads
            together and privately buzzed over this and that and the other proposition. One of these
            propositions met with much favor; it was, to confer upon the assassin a vote of thanks
            for removing Flint Buckner, and let him go. But the cooler heads opposed it, pointing
            out that addled brains in the Eastern states would pronounce it a scandal, and make no
            end of foolish noise about it. Finally the cool heads got the upper hand, and obtained
            general consent to a proposition of their own; their leader then called the house to
            order and stated it—to this effect: that Fetlock Jones be jailed and put upon
            trial. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1500">The motion was carried. Apparently there was nothing further to do now, and the people
            were glad, for, privately, they were impatient to get out and rush to the scene of the
            tragedy, and see whether that barrel and the other things were really there or not. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1503">But no—the break-up got a check. The surprises were not over yet. For a while
            Fetlock Jones had been silently sobbing, unnoticed in the absorbing excitements which
            had been following one another so persistently for some time; but when his arrest and
            trial were decreed, he broke out despairingly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1505">"No! it's no use. I don't want any jail, I don't want any trial; I've had all the hard
            luck I want, and all the miseries. Hang me now, and let me out! It would all come out,
            anyway—there couldn't anything save me. He has told it all, just as if he'd been
            with me and seen it—<i>I</i> don't know how he found out; and
            you'll find the barrel and things, and then I wouldn't have any chance any more. I
            killed him; and <i>you'd</i> have done it too, if he'd treated you like
            a dog, and you only a boy, and weak and poor, and not a friend to help you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1513">"And served him damned well right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. "Looky here, boys—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1515">From the constable: "Order! Order, gentlemen!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1517">A voice: "Did your uncle know what you was up to?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1519">"No, he didn't." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1521">"Did he give you the matches, sure enough?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1523">"Yes, he did; but he didn't know what I wanted them for." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1525">"When you was out on such a business as that, how did you venture to risk having him
            along—and him a <i>detective?</i> How's that?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1530">The boy hesitated, fumbled with his buttons in an embarrassed way, then said, shyly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1532">"I know about detectives, on account of having them in the family; and if you don't
            want them to find out about a thing, it's best to have them around when you do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1535">The cyclone of laughter which greeted this native discharge of wisdom did not modify
            the poor little waif's embarrassment in any large degree.</p>Chapter IX<p id="TwaDoubd1e1540">From a letter to Mrs. Stillman, dated merely "Tuesday." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1542">Fetlock Jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log cabin, and left there
              to await his trial. Constable Harris provided him with a couple of days' rations,
              instructed him to keep a good guard over himself, and promised to look in on him as
              soon as further supplies should be due. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1545">Next morning a score of us went with Hillyer, out of friendship, and helped him bury
              his late relative, the unlamented Buckner, and I acted as first assistant pall-bearer,
              Hillyer acting as chief. Just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy
              stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, limped by with his head down, and I caught the
              scent I had chased around the globe! It was the odor of Paradise to my perishing hope!
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1548">In a moment I was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder. He
              slumped to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had withered him in his tracks; and
              as the boys came running he struggled to his knees and put up his pleading hands to
              me, and out of his chattering jaws he begged me to persecute him no more, and said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1551">"You have hunted me around the world, Sherlock Holmes, yet God is my witness I have
              never done any man harm!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1554">A glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane. That was my work, mother!
              The tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery I felt in that moment, but
              nothing else can ever do it. The boys lifted him up, and gathered about him, and were
              full of pity of him, and said the gentlest and touchingest things to him, and said
              cheer up and don't be troubled, he was among friends now, and they would take care of
              him, and protect him, and hang any man that laid a hand on him. They are just like so
              many mothers, the rough mining-camp boys are, when you wake up the south side of their
              hearts; yes, and just like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up
              the opposite of that muscle. They did everything they could think of to comfort him,
              but nothing succeeded until Wells-Fargo Ferguson, who is a clever strategist, said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1557">"If it's only Sherlock Holmes that's troubling you, you needn't worry any more."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1560">"Why?" asked the forlorn lunatic, eagerly. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1563">"Because he's dead again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1566">"Dead! Dead! Oh, don't trifle with a poor wreck like me. <i>Is
              </i>he dead? On honor, now—is he telling me true, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1573">"True as you're standing there!" said Ham Sandwich, and they all backed up the
              statement in a body. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1576">"They hung him in San Bernardino last week," added Ferguson, clinching the matter,
              "whilst he was searching around after you. Mistook him for another man. They're sorry,
              but they can't help it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1579">"They're a-building him a monument," said Ham Sandwich, with the air of a person who
              had contributed to it, and knew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1582">"James Walker" drew a deep sigh—evidently a sigh of relief—and said
              nothing; but his eyes lost something of their wildness, his countenance cleared
              visibly, and its drawn look relaxed a little. We all went to our cabin, and the boys
              cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for, and while they
              were about it Hillyer and I outfitted him from hat to shoe-leather with new clothes of
              ours, and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him. "Old" is the right word,
              and a pity, too: old by the droop of him, and the frost upon his hair, and the marks
              which sorrow and distress have left upon his face; though he is only in his prime in
              the matter of years. While he ate, we smoked and chatted; and when he was finishing he
              found his voice at last, and of his own accord broke out with his personal history. I
              cannot furnish his exact words, but I will come as near it as I can. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1585">THE "WRONG MAN'S" STORY </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1588">It happened like this: I was in Denver. I had been there many years; sometimes I
              remember how many, sometimes I don't—but it isn't any matter. All of a sudden I
              got a notice to leave, or I would be exposed for a horrible crime committed long
              before—years and years before—in the East. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1591">I knew about that crime, but I was not the criminal; it was a cousin of mine of the
              same name. What should I better do? My head was all disordered by fear, and I didn't
              know. I was allowed very little time—only one day, I think it was. I would be
              ruined if I was published, and the people would lynch me, and not believe what I said.
              It is always the way with lynchings: when they find out it is a mistake they are
              sorry, but it is too late—the same as it was with Mr. Holmes, you see. So I said
              I would sell out and get money to live on, and run away until it blew over and I could
              come back with my proofs. Then I escaped in the night and went a long way off in the
              mountains somewhere, and lived disguised and had a false name. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1594">I got more and more troubled and worried, and my troubles made me see spirits and
              hear voices, and I could not think straight and clear on any subject, but got confused
              and involved and had to give it up, because my head hurt so. It got to be worse and
              worse; more spirits and more voices. They were about me all the time; at first only in
              the night, then in the day too. They were always whispering around my bed and plotting
              against me, and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out, because I got no good rest.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1597">And then came the worst. One night the whispers said, "We'll never manage, because
              we can't <i>see</i> him, and so can't point him out to the people."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1603">They sighed; then one said: "We must bring Sherlock Holmes. He can be here in twelve
              days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1606">They all agreed, and whispered and jibbered with joy. But my heart broke; for I had
              read about that man, and knew what it would be to have him upon my track, with his
              superhuman penetration and tireless energies. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1610">The spirits went away to fetch him, and I got up at once in the middle of the night
              and fled away, carrying nothing but the hand-bag that had my money in it—thirty
              thousand dollars; two-thirds of it are in the bag there yet. It was forty days before
              that man caught up on my track. I just escaped. From habit he had written his real
              name on a tavern register, but had scratched it out and written "Dagget Barclay" in
              the place of it. But fear gives you a watchful eye and keen, and I read the true name
              through the scratches, and fled like a deer. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1613">He has hunted me all over this world for three years and a half—the Pacific
              states, Australasia, India—everywhere you can think of; then back to Mexico and
              up to California again, giving me hardly any rest; but that name on the registers
              always saved me, and what is left of me is alive yet. And I am <i>so</i> tired! A cruel time he has given me, yet I give you my honor I have never
              harmed him nor any man. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1619">That was the end of the story, and it stirred those boys to bloodheat, he sure of
              it. As for me—each word burnt a hole in me where it struck. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1622">We voted that the old man should bunk with us, and be my guest and Hillyer's. I
              shall keep my own counsel, naturally; but as soon as he is well rested and nourished,
              I shall take him to Denver and rehabilitate his fortunes. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1625">The boys gave the old fellow the bone-smashing good-fellowship handshake of the
              mines, and then scattered away to spread the news. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1628">At dawn next morning Wells-Fargo Ferguson and Ham Sandwich called us softly out, and
              said, privately: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1631">"That news about the way that old stranger has been treated has spread all around,
              and the camps are up. They are piling in from everywhere, and are going to lynch the
              P'fessor. Constable Harris is in a dead funk, and has telephoned the sheriff. Come
              along!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1634">We started on a run. The others were privileged to feel as they chose, but in my
              heart's privacy I hoped the sheriff would arrive in time; for I had small desire that
              Sherlock Holmes should hang for my deeds, as you can easily believe. I had heard a
              good deal about the sheriff, but </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1637">for reassurance's sake I asked: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1640">"Can he stop a mob?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1643">"Can <i>he</i> stop a mob! Can Jack <i>Fairfax</i>
              stop a mob! Well, I should smile! Ex-desperado—nineteen scalps on his string.
              Can <i>he!</i> Oh, I <i>say!"</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1659">As we tore up the gulch, distant cries and shouts and yells rose faintly on the
              still air, and grew steadily in strength as we raced along. Roar after roar burst out,
              stronger and stronger, nearer and nearer; and at last, when we closed up upon the
              multitude massed in the open area in front of the tavern, the crash of sound was
              deafening. Some brutal roughs from Daly's gorge had Holmes in their grip, and he was
              the calmest man there; a contemptuous smile played about his lips, and if any fear of
              death was in his British heart, his iron personality was master of it and no sign of
              it was allowed to appear. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1662">"Come to a vote, men!" This from one of the Daly gang, Shadbelly Higgins. "Quick! is
              it hang, or shoot?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1665">"Neither!" shouted one of his comrades. "He'll he alive again in a week; burning's
              the only permanency for <i>him."</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1671">The gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a thundercrash of approval, and
              went struggling and surging toward the prisoner, and closed around him, shouting,
              "Fire! fire's the ticket!" They dragged him to the horse-post, backed him against it,
              chained him to it, and piled wood and pine cones around him waist-deep. Still the
              strong face did not blench, and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1674">"A match! fetch a match!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1677">Shadbelly struck it, shaded it with his hand, stooped, and held it under a pine
              cone. A deep silence fell upon the mob. The cone caught, a tiny flame flickered about
              it a moment or two. I seemed to catch the sound of distant hoofs—it grew more
              distinct—still more and more distinct, more and more definite, but the absorbed
              crowd did not appear to notice it. The match went out. The man struck another,
              stooped, and again the flame rose; this time it took hold and began to
              spread—here and there men turned away their faces. The executioner stood with
              the charred match in his fingers, watching his work. The hoof-beats turned a
              projecting crag, and now they came thundering down upon us. Almost the next moment
              there was a shout: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1680">"The sheriff!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1683">And straightway he came tearing into the midst, stood his horse almost on his hind
              feet, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1686">"Fall back, you gutter-snipes!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1689">He was obeyed. By all but their leader. He stood his ground, and his hand went to
              his revolver. The sheriff covered him promptly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1692">"Drop your hand, you parlor desperado. Kick the fire away. Now unchain the
              stranger." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1696">The parlor desperado obeyed. Then the sheriff made a speech; sitting his horse at
              martial ease, and not warming his words with any touch of fire, but delivering them in
              a measured and deliberate way, and in a tone which harmonized with their character and
              made them impressively disrespectful. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1699">"You're a nice lot—now ain't you? Just about eligible to travel with this bilk
              here—Shadbelly Higgins—this loud-mouthed sneak that shoots people in the
              back and calls himself a desperado. If there's anything I do particularly despise,
              it's a lynching mob; I've never seen one that had a man in it. It has to tally up a
              hundred against one before it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor. It's
              made up of cowards, and so is the community that breeds it; and ninety-nine times out
              of a hundred the sheriff's another one." He paused—apparently to turn that last
              idea over in his mind and taste the juice of it—then he went on: "The sheriff
              that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the lowest-down coward there is. By
              the statistics there was a hundred and eighty-two of them drawing sneak pay in America
              last year. By the way it's going, pretty soon there 'll be a new disease in the
                doctor-books—<i>sheriff complaint."</i> That idea pleased
              him—any one could see it. "People will say, 'Sheriff sick again?' 'Yes; got the
              same old thing.' And next there 'll be a new title. People won't say, 'He's running
              for sheriff of Rapaho County,' for instance; they'll say, 'He's running for Coward of
              Rapaho.' Lord, the idea of a grown-up person being afraid of a lynch mob!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1705">He turned an eye on the captive, and said, "Stranger, who are you, and what have you
              been doing?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1708">"My name is Sherlock Holmes, and I have not been doing anything." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1711">It was wonderful, the impression which the sound of that name made on the sheriff,
              notwithstanding he must have come posted. He spoke up with feeling, and said it was a
              blot on the county that a man whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their
              fame and their ingenuity, and whose histories of them had won every reader's heart by
              the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting, should be visited under the Stars
              and Stripes by an outrage like this. He apologized in the name of the whole nation,
              and made Holmes a most handsome bow, and told Constable Harris to see him to his
              quarters, and hold himself personally responsible if he was molested again. Then he
              turned to the mob and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1714">"Hunt your holes, you scum!" which they did; then he said: "Follow me, Shadbelly;
              I'll take care of your case myself. No—keep your popgun; whenever I see the day
              that I'll be afraid to have you behind me with that thing, it 'll be time for me to
              join last year's hundred and eighty-two"; and he rode off in a walk, Shadbelly
              following. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1717">When we were on our way back to our cabin, toward breakfast-time, we ran upon the
              news that Fetlock Jones had escaped from his lock-up in the night and is gone! Nobody
              is sorry. Let his uncle track him out if he likes; it is in his line; the camp is not
              interested.</p>Chapter X<p id="TwaDoubd1e1723"><i>Ten days later.</i>

There has been a
            wedding, between a handsome young man of slender means and a rich young girl—a
            case of love at first sight and a precipitate marriage; a marriage bitterly opposed by
            the girl's widowed father. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e140">Jacob Fuller, the bridegroom, is twenty-six years old, is of an old but unconsidered
            family which had by compulsion emigrated from Sedgemoor, and for King James's purse's
            profit, so everybody said—some maliciously the rest merely because they believed
            it. The bride is nineteen and beautiful. She is intense, high-strung, romantic,
            immeasurably proud of her Cavalier blood, and passionate in her love for her young
            husband. For its sake she braved her father's displeasure, endured his reproaches,
            listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions and went from his house
            without his blessing, proud and happy in the proofs she was thus giving of the quality
            of the affection which had made its home in her heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e142">The morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her. Her husband put aside
            her proffered caresses, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e144">"Sit down. I have something to say to you. I loved you. That was before I asked your
            father to give you to me. His refusal is not my grievance—I could have endured
            that. But the things he said of me to you—that is a different matter.
            There—you needn't speak; I know quite well what they were; I got them from
            authentic sources. Among other things he said that my character was written in my face;
            that I was treacherous, a dissembler, a coward, and a brute without sense of pity or
            compassion: the 'Sedgemoor trade-mark,' he called it—and 'white-sleeve badge.' Any
            other man in my place would have gone to his house and shot him down like a dog. I
            wanted to do it, and was minded to do it, but a better thought came to me: to put him to
            shame; to break his heart; to kill him by inches. How to do it? Through my treatment of
            you, his idol! I would marry you; and then—Have patience. You will see. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e146">From that moment onward, for three months, the young wife suffered all the
            humiliations, all the insults, all the miseries that the diligent and inventive mind of
            the husband could contrive, save physical injuries only. Her strong pride stood by her,
            and she kept the secret of her troubles. Now and then the husband said, "Why don't you
            go to your father and tell him?" Then he invented new tortures, applied them, and asked
            again. She always answered, "He shall never know by my mouth," and taunted him with his
            origin; said she was the lawful slave of a scion of slaves, and must obey, and
            would—up to that point, but no further; he could kill her if he liked, but he
            could not break her; it was not in the Sedgemoor breed to do it. At the end of the three
            months he said, with a dark significance in his manner, "I have tried all things but
            one"—and waited for her reply. "Try that," she said, and curled her lip in
            mockery. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e148">That night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes, then said to her: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e150">"Get up and dress!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e152">She obeyed—as always, without a word. He led her half a mile from the house, and
            proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public road; and succeeded, she
            screaming and struggling. He gagged her then, struck her across the face with his
            cowhide, and set his bloodhounds on her. They tore the clothes off her, and she was
            naked. He called the dogs off, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e154">"You will be found—by the passing public. They will be dropping along about three
            hours from now, and will spread the news—do you hear? Good-by. You have seen the
            last of me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e156">He went away then. She moaned to herself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e159">"I shall bear a child—to <i>him!</i> God grant it may be a boy!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e164">The farmers released her by and by—and spread the news, which was natural. They
            raised the country with lynching intentions, but the bird had flown. The young wife shut
            herself up in her father's house; he shut himself up with her, and thenceforth would see
            no one. His pride was broken, and his heart; so he wasted away, day by day, and even his
            daughter rejoiced when death relieved him. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e166">Then she sold the estate and disappeared.</p>Chapter 2<p id="TwaDoubd1e171">In 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded New England village,
            with no company but a little boy about five years old. She did her own work, she
            discouraged acquaintanceships, and had none. The butcher, the baker, and the others that
            served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was
            Stillman, and that she called the child Archy. Whence she came they had not been able to
            find out, but they said she talked like a Southerner. The child had no playmates and no
            comrade, and no teacher but the mother. She taught him diligently and intelligently, and
            was satisfied with the results—even a little proud of them. One day Archy said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e173">"Mamma, am I different from other children?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e175">"Well, I suppose not. Why?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e177">"There was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had been by and I
            said yes, and she said how long since I saw him and I said I hadn't seen him at all, and
            she said how did I know he'd been by, then, and I said because I smelt his track on the
            sidewalk, and she said I was a dum fool and made a mouth at me. What did she do that
            for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e179">The young woman turned white, and said to herself, "It's a birth mark! The gift of the
            bloodhound is in him." She snatched the boy to her breast and hugged him passionately,
            saying, "God has appointed the way!" Her eyes were burning with a fierce light, and her
            breath came short and quick with excitement. She said to herself: "The puzzle is solved
            now; many a time it has been a mystery to me, the impossible things the child has done
            in the dark, but it is all clear to me now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e181">She set him in his small chair, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e183">"Wait a little till I come, dear; then we will talk about the matter." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e185">She went up to her room and took from her dressing-table several small articles and put
            them out of sight: a nail-file on the floor under the bed; a pair of nail-scissors under
            the bureau; a small ivory paper-knife under the wardrobe. Then she returned, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e187">"There! I have left some things which I ought to have brought down." She named them,
            and said, "Run up and bring them, dear." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e189">The child hurried away on his errand and was soon back again with the things. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e192">"Did you have any difficulty, dear?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e194">"No, mamma; I only went where you went." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e196">During his absence she had stepped to the bookcase, taken several books from the bottom
            shelf, opened each, passed her hand over a page, noting its number in her memory, then
            restored them to their places. Now she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e198">"I have been doing something while you have been gone, Archy. Do you think you can find
            out what it was?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e200">The boy went to the bookcase and got out the books that had been touched, and opened
            them at the pages which had been stroked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e202">The mother took him in her lap, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e204">"I will answer your question now, dear. I have found out that in one way you are quite
            different from other people. You can see in the dark, you can smell what other people
            cannot, you have the talents of a bloodhound. They are good and valuable things to have,
            but you must keep the matter a secret. If people found it out, they would speak of you
            as an odd child, a strange child, and children would be disagreeable to you, and give
            you nicknames. In this world one must be like everybody else if he doesn't want to
            provoke scorn or envy or jealousy. It is a great and fine distinction which has been
            born to you, and I am glad; but you will keep it a secret, for mamma's sake, won't you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e206">The child promised, without understanding. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e208">All the rest of the day the mother's brain was busy with excited thinkings; with plans,
            projects, schemes, each and all of them uncanny, grim, and dark. Yet they lit up her
            face; lit it with a fell light of their own; lit it with vague fires of hell. She was in
            a fever of unrest; she could not sit, stand, read, sew; there was no relief for her but
            in movement. She tested her boy's gift in twenty ways, and kept saying to herself all
            the time, with her mind in the past: "He broke my father's heart, and night and day all
            these years I have tried, and all in vain, to think out a way to break his. I have found
            it now—I have found it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e210">When night fell, the demon of unrest still possessed her. She went on with her tests;
            with a candle she traversed the house from garret to cellar, hiding pins, needles,
            thimbles, spools, under pillows, under carpets, in cracks in the walls, under the coal
            in the bin; then sent the little fellow in the dark to find them; which he did, and was
            happy and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e212">From this time forward life took on a new complexion for her. She said, "The future is
            secure—I can wait, and enjoy the waiting." The most of her lost interests revived.
            She took up music again, and languages, drawing, painting, and the other long-discarded
            delights of her maidenhood. She was happy once more, and felt again the zest of life. As
            the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy, and was contented with it.
            Not altogether, but nearly that. The soft side of his heart was larger than the other
            side of it. It was his only defect, in her eyes. But she considered that his love for
            her and worship of her made up for it. He was a good hater—that was well; but it
            was a question if the materials of his hatreds were of as tough and enduring a quality
            as those of his friendships—and that was not so well. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e215">The years drifted on. Archy was become a handsome, shapely, athletic youth, courteous,
            dignified, companionable, pleasant in his ways, and looking perhaps a trifle older than
            he was, which was sixteen. One evening his mother said she had something of grave
            importance to say to him, adding that he was old enough to hear it now, and old enough
            and possessed of character enough and stability enough to carry out a stern plan which
            she had been for years contriving and maturing. Then she told him her bitter story, in
            all its naked atrociousness. For a while the boy was paralyzed; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e217">"I understand. We are Southerners; and by our custom and nature there is but one
            atonement. I will search him out and kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e219">"Kill him? No! Death is release, emancipation; death is a favor. Do I owe him favors?
            You must not hurt a hair of his head." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e221">The boy was lost in thought awhile; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e223">"You are all the world to me, and your desire is my law and my pleasure. Tell me what
            to do and I will do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e225">The mother's eyes beamed with satisfaction, and she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e227">"You will go and find him. I have known his hiding-place for eleven years; it cost me
            five years and more of inquiry, and much money, to locate it. He is a quartz-miner in
            Colorado, and well-to-do. He lives in Denver. His name is Jacob Fuller. There—it
            is the first time I have spoken it since that unforgettable night. Think! That name
            could have been yours if I had not saved you that shame and furnished you a cleaner one.
            You will drive him from that place; you will hunt him down and drive him again; and yet
            again, and again, and again, persistently, relentlessly, poisoning his life, filling it
            with mysterious terrors, loading it with weariness and misery, making him wish for
            death, and that he had a suicide's courage; you will make of him another Wandering Jew;
            he shall know no rest any more, no peace of mind, no placid sleep; you shall shadow him,
            cling to him, persecute him, till you break his heart, as he broke my father's and
            mine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e229">"I will obey, mother." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e231">"I believe it, my child. The preparations are all made; everything is ready. Here is a

                Fuller. I have his scent; I could track him through ten divisions of infantry and
                find him. I have often been near him and heard him talk. He owns a good mine, and
                has a fair income from it; but he is not rich. He learned mining in a good
                way—by working at it for wages. He is a cheerful creature, and his forty-three
                years sit lightly upon him; he could pass for a younger man—say thirty-six or
                thirty-seven. He has never married again—passes himself off for a widower. He
                stands well, is liked, is popular, and has many friends. Even I feel a drawing
                toward him—the paternal blood in me making its claim. How blind and
                unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature—the most of them, in
                fact! My task is become hard now—you realize it? you comprehend, and make
                allowances?—and the fire of it has cooled, more than I like to confess to
                myself, But I will carry it out. Even with the pleasure paled, the duty remains, and
                I will not spare him.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e286"><i>And for my help, a sharp resentment rises in me when I reflect
                that he who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not suffered by it.
                The lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character, and in the change he is
                happy. He, the guilty party, is absolved from all suffering; you, the innocent, are
                borne down with it. But be comforted—he shall harvest his share.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e290">SILVER GULCH, <i>May 19</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e295"><i>I placarded Form No. 1 at midnight of April 3; an hour later I
                slipped Form No. 2 under his chamber door, notifying him to leave Denver at or
                before 11.50 the night of the 14th.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e299"><i>Some late bird of a reporter stole one of my placards, then hunted
                the town over and found the other one, and stole that. In this manner he
                accomplished what the profession call a "scoop"—that is, he got a valuable
                item, and saw to it that no other paper got it. And so his paper—the principal
                one in the town—had it in glaring type on the editorial page in the morning,
                followed by a Vesuvian opinion of our wretch a column long, which wound up by adding
                a thousand dollars to our reward on the paper's account! The journals out here know
                how to do the noble thing—when there's business in it.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e303"><i>At breakfast I occupied my usual seat—selected because it
                afforded a view of papa Fuller's face, and was near enough for me to hear the talk
                that went on at his table. Seventy-five or a hundred people were in the room, and
                all discussing that item, and saying they hoped the seeker would find that rascal
                and remove the pollution of his presence from the town—with a rail, or a
                bullet, or something.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e307"><i>When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leave—folded
                up—in one hand, and the newspaper in the other; and it gave me more than half
                a pang to see him. His cheerfulness was all gone, and he looked old and pinched and
                ashy. And then—only think of the things he had to listen to! Mamma, he heard
                his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and characterizations drawn
                from the very dictionaries and phrase-books of Satan's own authorized editions down
                below. And more than that, he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them. His
                applause tasted bitter in his mouth, though; he could not disguise that from me; and
                it was observable that his appetite was gone; he only nibbled; he couldn't eat.
                Finally a man said:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e311"><i>"It is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing
                what this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel. I hope so."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e316"><i>Ah, dear, it was pitiful the way Fuller winced, and glanced around
                scared! He couldn't endure any more, and got up and left.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e320"><i>During several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in
                Mexico, and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could, and give the
                property his personal attention. He played his cards well; said he would take
                $40,000—a quarter in cash, the rest in safe notes; but that as he greatly
                needed money on account of his new purchase, he would diminish his terms for cash in
                full, He sold out for $30,000. And then, what do you think he did? He asked for
                greenbacks, and took them, saying the man in Mexico was a New-Englander, with a head
                full of crotchets, and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts. People thought it
                queer, since a draft on New York could produce greenbacks quite conveniently. There
                was talk of this odd thing, but only for a day; that is as long as any topic lasts
                in Denver.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e324"><i>I was watching, all the time. As soon as the sale was completed
                and the money paid—which was on the 11th—I began to stick to Fuller's
                track without dropping it for a moment. That night—no, 12th, for it was a
                little past midnight—I tracked him to his room, which was four doors from mine
                in the same hall; then I went back and put on my muddy day-laborer disguise,
                darkened my complexion, and sat down in my room in the gloom, with a gripsack handy,
                with a change in it, and my door ajar. For I suspected that the bird would take wing
                now. In half an hour an old woman passed by, carrying a grip: I caught the familiar
                whiff, and followed with my grip, for it was Fuller. He left the hotel by a side
                entrance, and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three
                blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness, and got into a two-horse hack, which of
                course was waiting for him by appointment. I took a seat (uninvited) on the trunk
                platform behind, and we drove briskly off. We drove ten miles, and the hack stopped
                at a way-station and was discharged. Fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow
                under the awning, as far as he could get from the light; I went inside, and watched
                the ticket-office. Fuller bought no ticket; I bought none. Presently the train came
                along, and he boarded a car; I entered the same car at the other end, and came down
                the aisle and took the seat behind him. When he paid the conductor and named his
                objective point, I dropped back several seats, while the conductor was changing a
                bill, and when he came to me I paid to the same place—about a hundred miles
                westward.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e328"><i>From that time for a week on end he led me a dance. He traveled
                here and there and yonder—always on a general westward trend—but he boas
                not a woman after the first day. He was a laborer, like myself, and wore bushy false
                whiskers. His outfit was perfect, and he could do the character without thinking
                about it, for he had served the trade for wages. His nearest friend could not have
                recognized him. At last he located himself here, the obscurest little mountain camp
                in Montana; he has a shanty, and goes out prospecting daily; is gone all day, and
                avoids society. I am living at a miner's boardinghouse, and it is an awful place:
                the bunks, the food, the dirt—everything.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e332"><i>We have been here four weeks, and in that time I have seen him but
                once; but every night I go over his track and post myself. As soon as he engaged a
                shanty here I went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed that Denver hotel to
                keep my baggage till I should send for it. I need nothing here but a change of army
                shirts, and I brought that with me.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e336">SILVER GULCH, <i>June 12</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e341"><i>The Denver episode has never found its way here, I think. I know
                the most of the men in camp, and they have never referred to it, at least in my
                hearing. Fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions. He has located a
                claim, two miles away, in an out-of-the-way place in the mountains; it promises very
                well, and he is working it diligently. Ah, but the change in him! He never smiles,
                and he keeps quite to himself, consorting with no one—he who was so fond of
                company and so cheery only two months ago. I have seen him passing along several
                times recently—drooping, forlorn, the spring gone from his step, a pathetic
                figure. He calls himself David Wilson.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e345"><i>I can trust him to remain here until we disturb him. Since you
                insist, I will banish him again, but I do not see how he can be unhappier than he
                already is. I will go hack to Denver and treat myself to a little season of comfort,
                and edible food, and endurable beds, and bodily decency; then I will fetch my

                than the other one; he came here a young widower in '79, aged twenty-one—a
                year before you were married; and the documents to prove it are innumerable. Last
                night I talked with familiar friends of his who have known him from the day of his
                arrival. I said nothing, but a few days from now I will land him in this town again,
                with the loss upon his mine made good; and there will be a banquet, and a
                torch-light procession, and there will not be any expense on anybody but me. Do you

                have not been able to think it out, and I have tried till my brains are addled. "If
                the gentleman who lately bought a mine in Mexico and sold one in Denver will send
                his address to" (to whom, mother!), "it will be explained to him that it was all a
                mistake; his forgiveness will be asked, and full reparation made for a loss which he
                sustained in a certain matter." Do you see? He would think it a trap. Well, any one
                would. If I should say, "It is now known that he was not the man wanted, but another
                man—a man who once bore the same name, but discarded it for good
                reasons"—would that answer? But the Denver people would wake up then and say
                "Oho!" and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks, and say, "Why did he
                run away if he wasn't the right man?—it is too thin." If I failed to find him
                he would be ruined there—there where there is no taint upon him now. You have
                a better head than mine. Help me.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e412"><i>I have one clue, and only one. I know his handwriting. If he puts

                mistake; a dog would have gone the other way. But I am only part dog, and can get
                very humanly stupid when excited. He had been stopping in that house ten days; I
                almost know, now, that he stops long nowhere, the past six or eight months, but is
                restless and has to keep moving. I understand that feeling! and I know what it is to
                feel it. He still uses the name he had registered when I came so near catching him
                nine months ago—"James Walker"; doubtless the same he adopted when he fled
                from Silver Gulch. An unpretending man, and has small taste for fancy names. I
                recognized the hand easily, through its slight disguise. A square man, and not good

                Hope Cañon; I traced him to a point thirty miles from here, but there I lost
                the trail; some one gave him a lift in a wagon, I suppose. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e463"><i>I am taking a rest, now—modified by searchings for the lost
                trail. I was tired to death, mother, and low-spirited, and sometimes coming
                uncomfortably near to losing hope; but the miners in this little camp are good
                fellows, and I am used to their sort this long time back; and their breezy ways
                freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles. I have been here a month. I am
                cabining with a young fellow named "Sammy" Hillyer, about twenty-five, the only son
                of his mother—like me—and loves her dearly, and writes to her every
                week—part of which is like me. He is a timid body, and in the matter of
                intellect—well, he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire; but no
                matter, he is well liked; he is good and fine, and it is meat and bread and rest and
                luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again. I wish "James Walker"
                could have it. He had friends; he liked company. That brings up that picture of him,
                the time that I saw him last. The pathos of it! It comes before me often and often.
                At that very time, poor thing, I was girding up my conscience to make him move on
                again!</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e467"><i>Hillyer's heart is better than mine, better than anybody's in the
                community, I suppose, for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the
                camp—Flint Buckner—and the only man Flint ever talks with or allows to
                talk with him. He says he knows Flint's history, and that it is trouble that has
                made him what he is, and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can. Now
                none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a lodger like Flint
                Buckner, from all I hear about him outside. I think that this one detail will give
                you a better idea of Sammy's character than any labored-out description I could
                furnish you of him. In one of our talks he said something about like this: "Flint is
                a kinsman of mine, and he pours out all his troubles to me—empties his breast
                from time to time, or I reckon it would burst. There couldn't be any unhappier man,
                Archy Stillman; his life had been made up of misery of mind—he isn't near as
                old as he looks. He has lost the feel of reposefulness and peace—oh, years and
                years ago! He doesn't know what good luck is—never has had any; often says he
                wishes he was in the other hell, he is so tired of this one."</i></p>Chapter IV<p id="TwaDoubd1e474"><i>No real gentleman will tell the naked truth in the presence of
              ladies.</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e478">It was a crisp and spicy morning in early October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with
            the glory-fires of autumn, hung burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge
            provided by kind Nature for the wingless wild things that have their homes in the
            tree-tops and would visit together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and
            yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the
            sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere;
            far in he empty sky a solitary esophagus[1] slept upon motionless
            wing; everywhere brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e483">October is the time—1900; Hope Cañon is the place, a silver-mining camp
            away down in the Esmeralda region. It is a secluded spot, high and remote; recent as to
            discovery; thought by its occupants to be rich in metal—a year or two's
            prospecting will decide that matter one way or the other. For inhabitants, the camp has
            about two hundred miners, one white woman and child, several Chinese washermen, five
            squaws, and a dozen vagrant buck Indians in rabbit-skin robes, battered plug hats, and
            tin-can necklaces. There are no mills as yet; no church, no newspaper. The camp has
            existed but two years; it has made no big strike; the world is ignorant of its name and
            place. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e485">On both sides of the cañon the mountains rise wall-like, three thousand feet,
            and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the
            sun only once a day, when he sails over at noon. The village is a couple of miles long;
            the cabins stand well apart from each other. The tavern is the only "frame"
            house—the only house, one might say. It occupies a central position, and is the
            evening resort of the population. They drink there, and play seven-up and dominoes; also
            billiards, for there is a table, crossed all over with torn places repaired with
            court-plaster; there are some cues, but no leathers; some chipped balls which clatter
            when they run, and do not slow up gradually, but stop suddenly and sit down; there is a
            part of a cube of chalk, with a projecting jag of flint in it; and the man who can score
            six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bar's expense. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e487">Flint Buckner's cabin was the last one of the village, going south; his silver-claim
            was at the other end of the village, northward, and a little beyond the last hut in that
            direction. He was a sour creature, unsociable, and had no companionships. People who had
            tried to get acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him. His history was not
            known. Some believed that Sammy Hillyer knew it; others said no. If asked, Hillyer said
            no, he was not acquainted with it. Flint had a meek English youth of sixteen or
            seventeen with him, whom he treated roughly, both in public and in private; and of
            course this lad was applied to for information, but with no success. Fetlock
            Jones—name of the youth—said that Flint picked him up on a prospecting
            tramp, and as he had neither home nor friends in America, he had found it wise to stay
            and take Buckner's hard usage for the sake of the salary, which was bacon and beans.
            Further than this he could offer no testimony. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e489">Fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now, and under his meek exterior he was
            slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and humiliations which his master had put
            upon him. For the meek suffer bitterly from these hurts; more bitterly, perhaps, than do
            the manlier sort, who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the limit of
            endurance has been reached. Good-hearted people wanted to help Fetlock out of his
            trouble, and tried to get him to leave Buckner; but the boy showed fright at the
            thought, and said he "dasn't." Pat Riley urged him, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e491">"You leave the damned hunks and come with me; don't you be afraid. I'll take care of
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e496">The boy thanked him with tears in his eyes, but shuddered and said he "dasn't risk it";
            he said Flint would catch him alone, some time, in the night, and then—"Oh, it
            makes me sick, Mr. Riley, to think of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e498">Others said, "Run away from him; we'll stake you; skip out for the coast some night."
            But all these suggestions failed; he said Flint would hunt him down and fetch him back,
            just for meanness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e500">The people could not understand this. The boy's miseries went steadily on, week after
            week. It is quite likely that the people would have understood if they had known how he
            was employing his spare time. He slept in an out-cabin near Flint's; and there, nights,
            he nursed his bruises and his humiliations, and studied and studied over a single
            problem—how he could murder Flint Buckner and not be found out. It was the only
            joy he had in life; these hours were the only ones in the twenty-four which he looked
            forward to with eagerness and spent in happiness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e503">He thought of poison. No—that would not serve; the inquest would reveal where it
            was procured and who had procured it. He thought of a shot in the back in a lonely place
            when Flint would be homeward bound at midnight—his unvarying hour for the trip.
            No—somebody might be near, and catch him. He thought of stabbing him in his sleep.
            No—he might strike an inefficient blow, and Flint would seize him. He examined a
            hundred different ways—none of them would answer; for in even the very obscurest
            and secretest of them there was always the fatal defect of a <i>risk,</i> a chance, a possibility that he might be found out. He would have none of
            that. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e508">But he was patient, endlessly patient. There was no hurry, he said to himself. He would
            never leave Flint till he left him a corpse; there was no hurry—he would find the
            way. It was somewhere, and he would endure shame and pain and misery until he found it.
            Yes, somewhere there was a way which would leave not a trace, not even the faintest clue
            to the murderer—there was no hurry—he would find that way, and
            then—oh, then, it would just be good to be alive! Meantime he would diligently
            keep up his reputation for meekness; and also, as always theretofore, he would allow no
            one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about his oppressor. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e510">Two days before the before-mentioned October morning Flint had bought some things, and
            he and Fetlock had brought them home to Flint's cabin: a fresh box of candles, which
            they put in the corner; a tin can of blasting-powder, which they placed upon the
            candle-box; a keg of blasting-powder, which they placed under Flint's bunk; a huge coil
            of fuse, which they hung on a peg. Fetlock reasoned that Flint's mining operations had
            outgrown the pick, and that blasting was about to begin now. He had seen blasting done,
            and he had a notion of the process, but he had never helped in it. His conjecture was
            right—blasting-time had come. In the morning the pair carried fuse, drills, and
            the powder-can to the shaft; it was now eight feet deep, and to get into it and out of
            it a short ladder was used. They descended, and by command Fetlock held the
            drill—without any instructions as to the right way to hold it—and Flint
            proceeded to strike. The sledge came down; the drill sprang out of Fetlock's hand,
            almost as a matter of course. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e512">"You mangy son of a nigger, is that any way to hold a drill? Pick it up! Stand it up!
            There—hold fast. D— you! <i>I'll</i> teach you!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e517">At the end of an hour the drilling was finished. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e519">"Now, then, charge it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e521">The boy started to pour in the powder. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e523">"Idiot!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e525">A heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e527">"Get up! You can't lie sniveling there. Now, then, stick in the fuse <i>first. Now</i> put in the powder. Hold on, hold on! Are you going to fill the hole
              <i>all</i> up? Of all the sap-headed milksops I—Put in some
            dirt! Put in some gravel! Tamp it down! Hold on, hold on! Oh, great Scott! get out of
            the way!" He snatched the iron and tamped the charge himself, meantime cursing and
            blaspheming like a fiend. Then he fired the fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and ran
            fifty yards away, Fetlock following. They stood waiting a few minutes, then a great
            volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion; after a
            little there was a shower of descending stones; then all was serene again. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e535">"I wish to God you'd been in it!" remarked the master. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e538">They went down the shaft, cleaned it out, drilled another hole, and put in another
            charge. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e540">"Look here! How much fuse are you proposing to waste? Don't you know how to time a
            fuse?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e542">"No, sir." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e544">"You <i>don't!</i> Well, if you don't beat anything <i>I</i> ever saw!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e552">He climbed out of the shaft and spoke down: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e554">"Well, idiot, are you going to be all day? Cut the fuse and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e556">The trembling creature began: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e558">"If you please, sir, I—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e560">"You talk back to <i>me?</i> Cut it and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e565">The boy cut and lit. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e567">"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! I wish you were in—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e570">In his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft and ran. The boy was aghast. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e572">"Oh, my God! Help. Help! Oh, save me!" he implored. "Oh, what can I do! What <i>can</i> I do!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e577">He backed against the wall as tightly as he could; the sputtering fuse frightened the
            voice out of him; his breath stood still; he stood gazing and impotent; in two seconds,
            three seconds, four he would be flying toward the sky torn to fragments. Then he had an
            inspiration. He sprang at the fuse; severed the inch of it that was left above ground,
            and was saved. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e579">He sank down limp and half lifeless with fright, his strength gone; but he muttered
            with a deep joy: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e581">"He has learnt me! I knew there was a way, if I would wait." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e583">After a matter of five minutes Buckner stole to the shaft, looking worried and uneasy,
            and peered down into it. He took in the situation; he saw what had happened. He lowered
            the ladder, and the boy dragged himself weakly up it. He was very white. His appearance
            added something to Buckner's uncomfortable state, and he said, with a show of regret and
            sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from lack of practice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e585">"It was an accident, you know. Don't say anything about it to anybody; I was excited,
            and didn't notice what I was doing. You're not looking well; you've worked enough for
            to-day; go down to my cabin and eat what you want, and rest. It's just an accident, you
            know, on account of my being excited." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e587">"It scared me," said the lad, as he started away; "but I learnt something, so I don't
            mind it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e589">"Damned easy to please!" muttered Buckner, following him with his eye. I wonder if
            he'll tell? Mightn't he?... I wish it <i>had</i> killed him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e594">The boy took no advantage of his holiday in the matter of resting; he employed it in
            work, eager and feverish and happy work. A thick growth of chaparral extended down the
            mountainside clear to Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's labor was done in the dark
            intricacies of that stubborn growth; the rest of it was done in his own shanty. At last
            all was complete, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e596">"If he's got any suspicions that I'm going to tell on him, he won't keep them long,
            to-morrow. He will see that I am the same milksop as I always was—all day and the
            next. And the day after to-morrow night there 'll be an end of him; nobody will ever
            guess who finished him up nor how it was done. He dropped me the idea his own self, and
            that's odd."</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e602"> From the Springfield <i>Republican,</i> April 12, 1902.</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e607">To the Editor of the
                  Republican:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e610"><i>One of your citizens has asked me a
                  question about the "esophagus," and I wish to answer him through you. This in the
                  hope that the answer will get around, and save me some penmanship, for I have
                  already replied to the same question more than several times, and am not getting
                  as much holiday as I ought to have.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e614"><i>I
                  published a short story lately, and it was in that that I put the esophagus. I
                  will say privately that I expected it to bother some people—in fact, that
                  was the intention—but the harvest has been larger than I was calculating
                  upon. The esophagus has gathered in the guilty and the innocent alike, whereas I
                  was only fishing for the innocent—the innocent and confiding. I knew a few
                  of these would write and ask me; that would give me but little trouble; but, I was
                  not expecting that the wise and the learned would call upon me for succor.
                  However, that has happened, and it is time for me to speak up and stop the
                  inquiries if I can, for letter-writing is not restful to me, and I am not having
                  so much fun out of this thing as I counted on. That you may understand the
                  situation, I will insert a couple of sample inquiries. The first is from a public
                  instructor in the Philippines: </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e618">SANTA CRUZ, <i>Ilocos, Sur, P. I. </i><br><i>February 13,

                  reading the first part of your latest story, entitled "A Double-barreled Detective
                  Story," and am very much delighted with it. In Part IV, page 264,</i> Harper's
                Magazine <i>for January, occurs this passage: "far in the empty sky a
                  solitary 'esophagus' slept upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness,
                  serenity, and the peace of God." Now, there is one word I do not understand,
                  namely, "esophagus." My only work of reference is the</i> Standard Dictionary,
                  <i>but that fails to explain the meaning. If you can spare the
                  time, I would be glad to have the meaning cleared up, as I consider the passage a
                  very touching and beautiful one. It may seem foolish to you, but consider my lack
                  of means away out in the northern part of Luzon.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e636"><i>Yours very truly.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e640"><i>Do you notice?
                  Nothing in the paragraph disturbed him but that one word. It shows that the
                  paragraph was most ably constructed for the deception it was intended to put upon
                  the reader. It was my intention that it should read plausibly, and it is now plain
                  that it does; it was my intention that it should be emotional and touching, and
                  you see, yourself, that it fetched this public instructor. Alas, If I had but left
                  that one treacherous word out, I should have scored! scored everywhere; and the
                  paragraph would have slidden through every reader's sensibilities like oil, and
                  left not a suspicion behind.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e644"><i>The other sample
                  inquiry is from a professor in a New England university. It contains one naughty
                  word (which I cannot bear to suppress), but he is not in the theological
                  department, so it is no harm:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e648"><i>Dear Mr.
                  Clemens: "Far in the empty sky a "solitary esophagus slept upon motionless
                  wing."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e653"><i>It is not often I get a chance to read
                  much periodical literature, but I have just gone through at this belated period,
                  with much gratification and edification, your "Double-barreled Detective
                  Story."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e657"><i>But what in hell is an esophagus? I
                  keep one myself, but it never sleeps in the air or anywhere else. My profession is
                  to deal with words, and esophagus interested me the moment I lighted upon it. But
                  as a companion of my youth used to say, "I'll be eternally, co-eternally cussed"
                  if l can make it out. Is it a joke, or I an ignoramus?</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e661"><i>Between you and me, I was almost ashamed of having fooled that man,
                  but for pride's sake I was not going to say so. I wrote and told him it was a
                  joke—and that is what I am now saying to my Springfield inquirer. And I told
                  him to carefully read the whole paragraph, and he would find not a vestige of
                  sense in any detail of it. This also I commend to my Springfield

                  appeared in</i> Harper's Magazine <i>for January and February
                  last, is the most elaborate of burlesques on detective fiction, with striking
                  melodramatic passages in which it is difficult to detect the deception, so ably is
                  it done. But the illusion ought not to endure even the first incident in the
                  February number. As for the paragraph which has so admirably illustrated the skill
                  of Mr. Clemens's ensemble and the carelessness of readers, here it
              is:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e688"><i>"It was a crisp and spicy morning in early
                  October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung
                  burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind nature for
                  the wingless wild things that have their home in the tree-tops and would visit
                  together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow flames in
                  brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the sensuous
                  fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere; far
                  in the empty sky a solitary esophagus slept upon motionless wings; everywhere
                  brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e692"><i>The success of Mark Twain's joke recalls to mind his story of the
                  petrified man in the cavern, whom he described most punctiliously, first giving a
                  picture of the scene, its impressive solitude, and all that; then going on to
                  describe the majesty of the figure, casually mentioning that the thumb of his
                  right hand rested against the side of his nose; then after further description
                  observing that the fingers of the right hand were extended in a radiating fashion;
                  and, recurring to the dignified attitude and position of the man, incidentally
                  remarked that the thumb of the left hand was in contact with the little finger of
                  the right—and so on. But was it so ingeniously written that Mark, relating
                  the history years later in an article which appeared in that excellent magazine of
                  the past, the</i> Galaxy, <i>declared that no one ever found out
                  the joke, and, if we remember aright, that that astonishing old mockery was
                  actually looked for in the region where he, as a Nevada newspaper editor, had
                  located it. It is certain that Mark Twain's jumping frog has a good many more
                  "pints" than any other frog.</i></p>Chapter V<p id="TwaDoubd1e702">The next day came and went. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e704">It is now almost midnight, and in five minutes the new morning will begin. The scene is
            in the tavern billiard-room. Rough men in rough clothing, slouch-hats, breeches stuffed
            into boot-tops, some with vests, none with coats, are grouped about the boiler-iron
            stove, which has ruddy cheeks and is distributing a grateful warmth; the billiard-balls
            are clacking; there is no other sound—that is, within; the wind is fitfully
            moaning without. The men look bored; also expectant. A hulking broad-shouldered miner,
            of middle age, with grizzled whiskers, and an unfriendly eye set in an unsociable face,
            rises, slips a coil of fuse upon his arm, gathers up some other personal properties, and
            departs without word or greeting to anybody. It is Flint Buckner. As the door closes
            behind him a buzz of talk breaks out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e706">"The regularest man that ever was," said Jake Parker, the blacksmith: "you can tell
            when it's twelve just by him leaving, without looking at your Waterbury." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e708">"And it's the only virtue he's got, as fur as I know," said Peter Hawes, miner. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e710">"He's just a blight on this society," said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "If I was
            running this shop I'd make him say something, <i>some</i> time or other,
            or vamos the ranch." This with a suggestive glance at the barkeeper, who did not choose
            to see it, since the man under discussion was a good customer, and went home pretty well
            set up, every night, with refreshments furnished from the bar. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e715">"Say," said Ham Sandwich, miner, "does any of you boys ever recollect of him asking you
            to take a drink?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e717"><i>"Him?</i> Flint <i>Buckner?</i> Oh, Laura!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e724">This sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous general outburst in one form of words or
            another from the crowd. After a brief silence, Pat Riley, miner, said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e726">"He's the 15-puzzle, that cuss. And his boy's another one. <i>I
            </i>can't make them out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e731">"Nor anybody else," said Ham Sandwich; "and if they are 15-puzzles how are you going to
            rank up that other one? When it comes to A 1 right-down solid mysteriousness, he lays
            over both of them. <i>Easy—</i>don't he?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e737">"You bet!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e739">Everybody said it. Every man but one. He was the new-comer-Peterson. He ordered the
            drinks all round, and asked who No. 3 might be. All answered at once, "Archy Stillman!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e741">"Is he a mystery?" asked Peterson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e743">"Is <i>he</i> a mystery? Is Archy <i>Stillman a</i>
            mystery?" said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "Why, the fourth dimension's foolishness to
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e754">For Ferguson was learned. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e756">Peterson wanted to hear all about him; everybody wanted to tell him; everybody began.
            But Billy Stevens, the barkeeper, called the house to order, and said one at a time was
            best. He distributed the drinks, and appointed Ferguson to lead. Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e758">"Well, he's a boy. And that is just about all we know about him. You can pump him till
            you are tired; it ain't any use; you won't get anything. At least about his intentions,
            or line of business, or where he's from, and such things as that. And as for getting at
            the nature and get-up of his main big chief mystery, why, he'll just change the subject,
            that's all. You can <i>guess</i> till you're black in the
            face—it's your privilege—but suppose you do, where do you arrive at?
            Nowhere, as near as I can make out," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e763">"What <i>is</i> his big chief one?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e768">"Sight, maybe. Hearing, maybe. Instinct, maybe. Magic, maybe. Take your
            choice—grownups, twenty-five; children and servants, half price. Now I'll tell you
            what he can do. You can start here, and just disappear; you can go and hide wherever you
            want to, I don't care where it is, nor how far—and he'll go straight and put his
            finger on you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e770">"You don't mean it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e772">"I just do, though. Weather's nothing to him—elemental conditions is nothing to
            him—he don't even take notice of them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e775">"Oh, come! Dark? Rain? Snow? Hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e777">"It's all the same to <i>him.</i> He don't give a damn." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e782">"Oh, <i>say—</i>including <i>fog,</i> per'aps?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e790"><i>"Fog!</i> he's got an eye 't can plunk through it like a bullet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e794">"Now, boys, honor bright, what's he giving me?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e796">"It's a fact!" they all shouted. "Go on, Wells-Fargo." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e798">"Well, sir, you can leave him here, chatting with the boys, and you can slip out and go
            to any cabin in this camp and open a book—yes, sir, a dozen of them—and take
            the page in your memory, and he'll start out and go straight to that cabin and open
            every one of them books at the right page, and call it off, and never make a mistake." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e800">"He must be the devil!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e802">"More than one has thought it. Now I'll tell you a perfectly wonderful thing that he
            done. The other night he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e804">There was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside, the door flew open, and an excited
            crowd burst in, with the camp's one white woman in the lead and crying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e806">"My child! my child! she's lost and gone! For the love of God help me to find Archy
            Stillman; we've hunted everywhere!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e809">Said the barkeeper: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e811">"Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, and don't worry. He asked for a bed three hours ago,
            tuckered out tramping the trails the way he's always doing, and went up-stairs. Ham
            Sandwich, run up and roust him out; he's in No. 14." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e813">The youth was soon down-stairs and ready. He asked Mrs. Hogan for particulars. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e815">"Bless you, dear, there ain't any; I wish there was. I put her to sleep at seven in the
            evening, and when I went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself, she was gone. I
            rushed for your cabin, dear, and you wasn't there, and I've hunted for you ever since,
            at every cabin down the gulch, and now I've come up again, and I'm that distracted and
            scared and heartbroke; but, thanks to God, I've found you at last, dear heart, and
            you'll find my child. Come on! come quick!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e817">"Move right along; I'm with you, madam. Go to your cabin first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e819">The whole company streamed out to join the hunt. All the southern half of the village
            was up, a hundred men strong, and waiting outside, a vague dark mass sprinkled with
            twinkling lanterns. The mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself
            to the narrow road, and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders. In a
            few minutes the Hogan cabin was reached. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e821">"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Hogan; "there's where she was; it's where I laid her at
            seven o'clock; but where she is now, God only knows." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e823">"Hand me a lantern," said Archy. He set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it,
            pretending to examine the ground closely. "Here's her track," he said, touching the
            ground here and there and yonder with his finger. "Do you see?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e825">Several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see. One or two
            thought they discerned something like a track; the others shook their heads and
            confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp
            enough to discover. One said, "Maybe a child's foot could make a mark on it, but <i>I</i> don't see how." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e830">Young Stillman stepped outside, held the light to the ground, turned leftward, and
            moved three steps, closely examining; then said, "I've got the direction—come
            along; take the lantern, somebody." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e832">He strode off swiftly southward, the files following, swaying and bending in and out
            with the deep curves of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the mouth of the gorge was reached;
            before them stretched the sagebrush plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman called a halt,
            saying, "We mustn't start wrong, now; we must take the direction again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e835">He took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards; then said,
            "Come on; it's all right," and gave up the lantern. In and out among the sage-bushes he
            marched, a quarter of a mile, bearing gradually to the right; then took a new direction
            and made another great semicircle; then changed again and moved due west nearly half a
            mile—and stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e837">"She gave it up, here, poor little chap. Hold the lantern. You can see where she sat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e839">But this was in a slick alkali flat which was surfaced like steel, and no person in the
            party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a
            cushion on a veneer like that. The bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the
            spot, lamenting. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e841">"But where is she, then?" some one said. "She didn't stay here. We can see <i>that</i> much, anyway." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e846">Stillman moved about in a circle around the place, with the lantern, pretending to hunt
            for tracks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e848">"Well!" he said presently, in an annoyed tone, "I don't understand it." He examined
            again. "No use. She was here—that's certain; she never <i>walked</i> away from here—and that's certain. It's a puzzle; I can't make it
            out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e853">The mother lost heart then. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e855">"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! some flying beast has got her. I'll never see her
            again!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e857">"Ah, <i>don't</i> give up," said Archy. "We'll find her—don't
            give up." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e862">"God bless you for the words, Archy Stillman!" and she seized his hand and kissed it
            fervently. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e864">Peterson, the new-comer, whispered satirically in Ferguson's ear: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e867">"Wonderful performance to find this place, wasn't it? Hardly worth while to come so
            far, though; any other supposititious place would have answered just as well—hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e869">Ferguson was not pleased with the innuendo. He said, with some warmth: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e871">"Do you mean to insinuate that the child hasn't been here? I tell you the child <i>has</i> been here! Now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a
            little fuss as—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e876">"All right!" sang out Stillman. "Come, everybody, and look at this! It was right under
            our noses all the time, and we didn't see it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e878">There was a general plunge for the ground at the place where the child was alleged to
            have rested, and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to see the thing that Archy's finger
            was resting upon. There was a pause, then a several-barreled sigh of disappointment. Pat
            Riley and Ham Sandwich said, in the one breath: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e880">"What is it, Archy? There's nothing here." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e882">"Nothing? Do you call <i>that</i> nothing?" and he swiftly traced upon
            the ground a form with his finger. "There—don't you recognize it now? It's Injun
            Billy's track. He's got the child." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e887">"God be praised !" from the mother. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e889">"Take away the lantern. I've got the direction. Follow!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e891">He started on a run, racing in and out among the sage-bushes a matter of three hundred
            yards, and disappeared over a sand-wave; the others struggled after him, caught him up,
            and found him waiting. Ten steps away was a little wickiup, a dim and formless shelter
            of rags and old horse-blankets, a dull light showing through its chinks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e893">"You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the lad. "It's your privilege to be first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e896">All followed the sprint she made for the wickiup, and saw, with her, the picture its
            interior afforded. Injun Billy was sitting on the ground; the child was asleep beside
            him. The mother hugged it with a wild embrace, which included Archy Stillman, the
            grateful tears running down her face, and in a choked and broken voice she poured out a
            golden stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments which has its home in full
            richness nowhere but in the Irish heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e898">"I find her bymeby it is ten o'clock," Billy explained. "She 'sleep out yonder, ve'y
            tired—face wet, been cryin', 'spose; fetch her home, feed her, she heap much
            hungry—go 'sleep 'gin." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e900">In her limitless gratitude the happy mother waived rank and hugged him too, calling him
            "the angel of God in disguise." And he probably was in disguise if he was that kind of
            an official. He was dressed for the character. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e902">At half past one in the morning the procession burst into the village singing, "When
            Johnny Comes Marching Home," waving its lanterns and swallowing the drinks that were
            brought out all along its course. It concentrated at the tavern, and made a night of
            what was left of the morning.</p>Chapter VI<p id="TwaDoubd1e907">The next afternoon the village was electrified with an immense sensation. A grave and
            dignified foreigner of distinguished bearing and appearance had arrived at the tavern,
            and entered this formidable name upon the register: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e909">SHERLOCK HOLMES
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e913">The news buzzed from cabin to cabin, from claim to claim; tools were dropped, and the
            town swarmed toward the center of interest. A man passing out at the northern end of the
            village shouted it to Pat Riley, whose claim was the next one to Flint Buckner's. At
            that time Fetlock Jones seemed to turn sick. He muttered to himself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e915">"Uncle <i>Sherlock!</i> The mean luck of it!—that <i>he </i>should come just when..." He dropped into a reverie, and
            presently said to himself: "But what's the use of being afraid of <i>him?
            </i>Anybody that knows him the way I do knows he can't detect a crime except where he
            plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and hires some fellow to commit it
            according to instructions.... Now there ain't going to <i>be</i> any
            clues this time—so, what show has he got? None at all. No, sir; everything's
            ready. If I was to risk putting it off—...No, I won't run any risk like that.
            Flint Buckner goes out of this world to-night, for sure." Then another trouble presented
            itself. "Uncle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening, and
            how am I going to get rid of him? for I've <i>got</i> to be at my cabin
            a minute or two about eight o'clock." This was an awkward matter, and cost him much
            thought. But he found a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll go for a walk, and I'll leave
            him in the road a minute, so that he won't see what it is I do: the best way to throw a
            detective off the track, anyway, is to have him along when you are preparing the thing.
            Yes, that's the safest—I'll take him with me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e932">Meantime the road in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping
            for a glimpse of the great man. But he kept his room, and did not appear. None but
            Ferguson, Jake Parker the blacksmith, and Ham Sandwich had any luck. These enthusiastic
            admirers of the great scientific detective hired the tavern's detained-baggage lockup,
            which looked into the detective's room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide,
            ambushed themselves in it, and cut some peep-holes in the window-blind. Mr. Holmes's
            blinds were down; but by and by he raised them. It gave the spies a hair-lifting but
            pleasurable thrill to find themselves face to face with the Extraordinary Man who had
            filled the world with the fame of his more than human ingenuities. There he
            sat—not a myth, not a shadow, but real, alive, compact of substance, and almost
            within touching distance with the hand. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e934">"Look at that head!" said Ferguson, in an awed voice. "By gracious! <i>that's</i> a head!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e939">"You bet!" said the blacksmith, with deep reverence. "Look at his nose! look at his
            eyes! Intellect? Just a battery of it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e941">"And that paleness," said Ham Sandwich. "Comes from thought—that's what it comes
            from. Hell! duffers like us don't know what real thought <i>is."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e946">"No more we don't," said Ferguson. "What we take for thinking is just

            He's on the track of something." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e954">"Well, he is, and don't you forget it. Say—look at that awful gravity—look
            at that pallid solemness—there ain't any corpse can lay over it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e956">"No, sir, not for dollars! And it's his'n by hereditary rights, too; he's been dead
            four times a'ready, and there's history for it. Three times natural, once by accident.
            I've heard say he smells damp and cold, like a grave. And he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e958">" 'Sh! Watch him! There—he's got his thumb on the bump on the near corner of his
            forehead, and his forefinger on the off one. His think-works is just a-<i>grinding</i> now, you bet your other shirt." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e963">"That's so. And now he's gazing up toward heaven and stroking his mustache slow,
            and—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e965">"Now he has rose up standing, and is putting his clues together on his left fingers
            with his right finger. See? he touches the forefinger—now middle finger—now
            ring-finger—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e967">"Stuck!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e969">"Look at him scowl! He can't seem to make out <i>that</i> clue. So
            he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e974">"See him smile!—like a tiger—and tally off the other fingers like nothing!
            He's got it, boys; he's got it sure!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e976">"Well, I should <i>say!</i> I'd hate to be in that man's place that
            he's after." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e981">Mr. Holmes drew a table to the window, sat down with his back to the spies, and
            proceeded to write. The spies withdrew their eyes from the peep-holes, lit their pipes,
            and settled themselves for a comfortable smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with conviction: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e983">"Boys, it's no use talking, he's a wonder! He's got the signs of it all over him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e986">"You hain't ever said a truer word than that, Wells-Fargo," said Jake Parker. "Say,
            wouldn't it 'a' been nuts if he'd a-been here last night?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e988">"Oh, by George, but wouldn't it!" said Ferguson. "Then we'd have seen <i>scientific</i> work. Intellect—just pure intellect—away up on the upper

            an owl's, as near as I can make it out just a grand natural animal talent, no more, no

            marvelousness no more to be compared to what this man does than—than—Why,

            premises, and that's enough. See everything? Yes, sir, to the last little detail; and
            he'll know more about that place than the Hogans would know in seven years. Next, he
            would sit down on the bunk, just as ca'm, and say to Mrs. Hogan—<i>Say,</i> Ham, consider that you are Mrs. Hogan. I'll ask the questions; you answer

            dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, many thanks. Ah, admirable, admirable! <i>Now</i> we know where we are, I think.' You see, boys, he's got all the
            clues he wants now; he don't need anything more. Now, then, what does this Extraordinary
            Man do? He lays those snips and that dirt out on the table and leans over them on his
            elbows, and puts them together side by side and studies them—mumbles to himself,
            'Female'; changes them around—mumbles, 'Six years old'; changes them this way and
            that—again mumbles: 'Five teeth—one
            a-coming—Catholic—yarn—cotton—kip—damn that kip.' Then he
            straightens up and gazes toward heaven, and plows his hands through his hair—plows
            and plows, muttering, 'Damn that kip!' Then he stands up and frowns, and begins to tally
            off his clues on his fingers—and gets stuck at the ring-finger. But only just a
            minute—then his face glares all up in a smile like a house afire, and he
            straightens up stately and majestic, and says to the crowd, 'Take a lantern, a couple of
            you, and go down to Injun Billy's and fetch the child—the rest of you go 'long
            home to bed; good-night, madam; good-night, gents.' And he bows like the Matterhorn, and
            pulls out for the tavern. That's <i>his</i> style, and the <i>Only—</i>scientific, intellectual—all over in fifteen
            minutes—no poking around all over the sage-brush range an hour and a half in a

          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1055">"By Jackson, it's grand!" said Ham Sandwich. "Wells-Fargo, you've got him down to a

It's just a photograft, that's what it is." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1062">Ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success, and grateful. He sat silently
            enjoying his happiness a little while, then he murmured, with a deep awe in his voice, </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1064">"I wonder if God made him?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1066">There was no response for a moment; then Ham Sandwich said, reverently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1068">"Not all at one time, I reckon."</p>Chapter VII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1073">At eight o'clock that evening two persons were groping their way past Flint Buckner's
            cabin in the frosty gloom. They were Sherlock Holmes and his nephew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1075">"Stop here in the road a moment, uncle," said Fetlock, "while I run to my cabin; I
            won't be gone a minute." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1077">He asked for something—the uncle furnished it—then he disappeared in the
            darkness, but soon returned, and the talking-walk was resumed. By nine o'clock they had
            wandered back to the tavern. They worked their way through the billiard-room, where a
            crowd had gathered in the hope of getting a glimpse of the Extraordinary Man. A royal
            cheer was raised. Mr. Holmes acknowledged the compliment with a series of courtly bows,
            and as he was passing out his nephew said to the assemblage: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1079">"Uncle Sherlock's got some work to do, gentlemen, that 'll keep him till twelve or one;
            but he'll be down again then, or earlier if he can, and hopes some of you'll be left to
            take a drink with him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1081">"By George, he's just a duke, boys! Three cheers for Sherlock Holmes, the greatest man
            that ever lived!" shouted Ferguson. "Hip, hip, hip—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1083">"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Tiger!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1085">The uproar shook the building, so hearty was the feeling the boys put into their
            welcome. Up-stairs the uncle reproached the nephew gently, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1087">"What did you get me into that engagement for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1089">"I reckon you don't want to be unpopular, do you, uncle? Well, then, don't you put on
            any exclusiveness in a mining-camp, that's all. The boys admire you; but if you was to
            leave without taking a drink with them, they'd set you down for a snob. And besides, you
            said you had home talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1091">The boy was right, and wise—the uncle acknowledged it. The boy was wise in
            another detail which he did not mention—except to himself: "Uncle and the others
            will come handy—in the way of nailing an <i>alibi </i>where it
            can't be budged." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1097">He and his uncle talked diligently about three hours. Then, about midnight, Fetlock
            stepped down-stairs and took a position in the dark a dozen steps from the tavern, and
            waited. Five minutes later Flint Buckner came rocking out of the billiard-room and
            almost brushed him as he passed. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1099">"I've <i>got</i> him!" muttered the boy. He continued to himself,
            looking after the shadowy form: "Good-by—good-by for good, Flint Buckner; you
            called my mother a—well, never mind what: it's all right, now; you're taking your
            last walk, friend." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1104">He went musing back into the tavern. "From now till one is an hour. We'll spend it with
            the boys; it's good for the <i>alibi."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1109">He brought Sherlock Holmes to the billiard-room, which was jammed with eager and
            admiring miners; the guest called the drinks, and the fun began. Everybody was happy;
            everybody was complimentary; the ice was soon broken, songs, anecdotes, and more drinks
            followed, and the pregnant minutes flew. At six minutes to one, when the jollity was at
            its highest— </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1111"><i>Boom!</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1115">There was silence instantly. The deep sound came rolling and rumbling frown peak to
            peak up the gorge, then died down, and ceased. The spell broke, then, and the men made a
            rush for the door, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1117">"Something's blown up!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1119">Outside, a voice in the darkness said, "It's away down the gorge; I saw the flash." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1121">The crowd poured down the cañon—Holmes, Fetlock, Archy Stillman,
            everybody. They made the mile in a few minutes. By the light of a lantern they found the
            smooth and solid dirt floor of Flint Buckner's cabin; of the cabin itself not a vestige
            remained, not a rag nor a splinter. Nor any sign of Flint. Search-parties sought here
            and there and yonder, and presently a cry went up. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1123">"Here he is!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1125">It was true. Fifty yards down the gulch they had found him—that is, they had
            found a crushed and lifeless mass which represented him. Fetlock Jones hurried thither
            with the others and looked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1128">The inquest was a fifteen-minute affair. Ham Sandwich, foreman of the jury, handed up
            the verdict, which was phrased with a certain unstudied literary grace, and closed with
            this finding, to wit: that "deceased came to his death by his own act or some other
            person or persons unknown to this jury not leaving any family or similar effects behind
            but his cabin which was blown away and God have mercy on his soul amen." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1130">Then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd, for the storm-center of interest was
            there—Sherlock Holmes. The miners stood silent and reverent in a half-circle,
            inclosing a large vacant space which included the front exposure of the site of the late
            premises. In this considerable space the Extraordinary Man was moving about, attended by
            his nephew with a lantern. With a tape he took measurements of the cabin site; of the
            distance from the wall of chaparral to the road; of the height of the chaparral bushes;
            also various other measurements. He gathered a rag here, a splinter there, and a pinch
            of earth yonder, inspected them profoundly, and preserved them. He took the "lay" of the
            place with a pocket-compass, allowing two seconds for magnetic variation. He took the
            time (Pacific) by his watch, correcting it for local time. He paced off the distance
            from the cabin site to the corpse, and corrected that for tidal differentiation. He took
            the altitude with a pocket-aneroid, and the temperature with a pocket-thermometer.
            Finally he said, with a stately bow: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1132">"It is finished. Shall we return, gentlemen?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1134">He took up the line of march for the tavern, and the crowd fell into his wake,
            earnestly discussing and admiring the Extraordinary Man, and interlarding guesses as to
            the origin of the tragedy and who the author of it might he. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1136">"My, but it's grand luck having him here—hey, boys?" said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1138">"It's the biggest thing of the century," said Ham Sandwich. "It 'll go all over the
            world; you mark my words." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1140"><i>"You</i> bet!" said Jake Parker, the blacksmith. "It 'll boom this
            camp. Ain't it so, Wells-Fargo?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1144">"Well, as you want my opinion—if it's any sign of how <i>I
            </i>think about it, I can tell you this: yesterday I was holding the Straight Flush
            claim at two dollars a foot; I'd like to see the man that can get it at sixteen to-day." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1149">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo! It's the grandest luck a new camp ever struck. Say, did
            you see him collar them little rags and dirt and things? What an eye! He just can't
            overlook a clue—'tain't <i>in </i>him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1154">"That's so. And they wouldn't mean a thing to anybody else; but to him, why, they're
            just a book—large print at that." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1156">"Sure's you're born! Them odds and ends have got their little old secret, and they
            think there ain't anybody can pull it; but, land! when he sets his grip there they've
            got to squeal, and don't you forget it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1159">"Boys, I ain't sorry, now, that he wasn't here to roust out the child; this is a bigger
            thing, by a long sight. Yes, sir, and more tangled up and scientific and intellectual." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1161">"I reckon we're all of us glad it's turned out this way. Glad? 'George! it ain't any
            name for it. Dontchuknow, Archy could 've <i>learnt</i> something if
            he'd had the nous to stand by and take notice of how that man works the system. But no;
            he went poking up into the chaparral and just missed the whole thing." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1166">"It's true as gospel; I seen it myself. Well, Archy's young. He'll know better one of
            these days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1168">"Say, boys, who do you reckon done it?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1170">That was a difficult question, and brought out a world of unsatisfying conjecture.
            Various men were mentioned as possibilities, but one by one they were discarded as not
            being eligible. No one but young Hillyer had been intimate with Flint Buckner; no one
            had really had a quarrel with him; he had affronted every man who had tried to make up
            to him, although not quite offensively enough to require bloodshed. There was one name
            that was upon every tongue from the start, but it <i>was</i> the last to
            get utterance—Fetlock Jones's. It was Pat Riley that mentioned it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1175">"Oh, well," the boys said, "of course we've all thought of him, because he had a
            million rights to kill Flint Buckner, and it was just his plain duty to do it. But all
            the same there's two things we can't get around: for one thing, he hasn't got the sand;
            and for another, he wasn't anywhere near the place when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1177">"I know it," said Pat. "He was there in the billiard-room with us when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1179">"Yes, and was there all the time for an hour <i>before</i> it
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1184">"It's so. And lucky for him, too. He'd have been suspected in a minute if it hadn't
            been for that."</p>Chapter VIII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1189">The tavern dining-room had been cleared of all its furniture save one six-foot pine
            table and a chair. This table was against one end of the room; the chair was on it;
            Sherlock Holmes, stately, imposing, impressive, sat in the chair. The public stood. The
            room was full. The tobacco-smoke was dense, the stillness profound. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1191">The Extraordinary Man raised his hand to command additional silence; held it in the air
            a few moments; then, in brief, crisp terms he put forward question after question, and
            noted the answers with "Um-ums," nods of the head, and so on. By this process he learned
            all about Flint Buckner, his character, conduct, and habits, that the people were able
            to tell him. It thus transpired that the Extraordinary Man's nephew was the only person
            in the camp who had a killing-grudge against Flint Buckner. Mr. Holmes smiled
            compassionately upon the witness, and asked, languidly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1193">"Do any of you gentlemen chance to know where the lad Fetlock Jones was at the time of
            the explosion?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1195">A thunderous response followed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1197">"In the billiard-room of this house!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1199">"Ah. And had he just come in?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1201">"Been there all of an hour!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1203">"Ah. It is about—about—well, about how far might it be to the scene of the
            explosions" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1205">"All of a mile!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1207">"Ah. It isn't <i>much</i> of an alibi, 'tis true, but—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1213">A storm-burst of laughter, mingled with shouts of "By jiminy, but he's
            chain-lightning!" and "Ain't you sorry you spoke, Sandy?" shut off the rest of the
            sentence, and the crushed witness drooped his blushing face in pathetic shame. The
            inquisitor resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1215">"The lad Jones's somewhat <i>distant</i> connection with the case"
              (laughter<i>) "</i>having been disposed of, let us now call the
            eye-witnesses of the tragedy, and listen to what they have to say." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1223">He got out his fragmentary clues and arranged them on a sheet of cardboard on his knee.
            The house held its breath and watched. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1225">"We have the longitude and the latitude, corrected for magnetic variation, and this
            gives us the exact location of the tragedy. We have the altitude, the temperature, and
            the degree of humidity prevailing—inestimably valuable, since they enable us to
            estimate with precision the degree of influence which they would exercise upon the mood
            and disposition of the assassin at that time of the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1227"><i>(Buzz of admiration; muttered remark, "By George, but he's
              deep.")</i> He fingered his clues. "And now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak
            to us. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1231">"Here we have an empty linen shot-bag. What is its message? This: that robbery was the
            motive, not revenge. What is its further message? This: that the assassin was of
            inferior intelligence—shall we say light-witted, or perhaps approaching that? How
            do we know this? Because a person of sound intelligence would not have proposed to rob
            the man Buckner, who never had much money with him. But the assassin might have been a
            stranger? Let the bag speak again. I take from it this article. It is a bit of
            silver-bearing quartz. It is peculiar. Examine it, please—you—and
            you—and you. Now pass it back, please. There is but one lode on this coast which
            produces just that character and color of quartz; and that is a lode which crops out for
            nearly two miles on a stretch, and in my opinion is destined, at no distant day, to
            confer upon its locality a globe-girdling celebrity, and upon its two hundred owners
            riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Name that lode, please." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1233">"The Consolidated Christian Science and Mary Ann!" was the prompt response. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1235">A wild crash of hurrahs followed, and every man reached for his neighbor's hand and
            wrung it, with tears in his eyes; and Wells-Fargo Ferguson shouted, "The Straight Flush
            is on the lode, and up she goes to a hunched and fifty a foot—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1240">When quiet fell, Mr. Holmes resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1242">"We perceive, then, that three facts are established, to wit: the assassin was
            approximately light-witted; he was not a stranger; his motive was robbery, not revenge.
            Let us proceed. I hold in my hand a small fragment of fuse, with the recent smell of
            fire upon it. What is its testimony? Taken with the corroborative evidence of the
            quartz, it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner. What does it tell us further?
            This, gentlemen: that the assassination was consummated by means of an explosive. What
            else does it say? This: that the explosive was located against the side of the cabin
            nearest the road—the front side—for within six feet of that spot I found it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1244">"I hold in my fingers a burnt Swedish match—the kind one rubs on a safety-box. I
            found it in the road, six hundred and twenty-two feet from the abolished cabin. What
            does it say? This: that the train was fired from that point. What further does it tell
            us? This: that the assassin was left-handed. How do I know this? I should not be able to
            explain to you, gentlemen, how I know it, the signs being so subtle that only long
            experience and deep study can enable one to detect them. But the signs are here, and
            they are reinforced by a fact which you must have often noticed in the great detective
            narratives—that <i>all </i>assassins are left-handed." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1250">"By Jackson, <i>that's</i> so." said Ham Sandwich, bringing his great
            hand down with a resounding slap upon his thigh; "blamed if I ever thought of it
            before." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1255">"Nor I!" "Nor I!" cried several. "Oh, there can't anything escape <i>him—</i>look at his eye!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1260">"Gentlemen, distant as the murderer was from his doomed victim, he did not wholly
            escape injury. This fragment of wood which I now exhibit to you struck him. It drew
            blood. Wherever he is, he bears the telltale mark. I picked it up where he stood when he
            fired the fatal train," He looked out over the house from his high perch, and his
            countenance began to darken; he slowly raised his hand, and pointed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1262">"There stands the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1264">For a moment the house was paralyzed with amazement; then twenty voices burst out with: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1266">"Sammy Hillyer? Oh, <i>hell,</i> no! <i>Him?</i> It's
            pure foolishness!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1274">"Take care, gentlemen—be not hasty. Observe—he has the blood-mark on his
            brow." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1276">Hillyer turned white with fright. He was near to crying. He turned this way and that,
            appealing to every face for help and sympathy; and held out his supplicating hands
            toward Holmes and began to plead: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1278"><i>"Don't,</i> oh, don't! I never did it; I give my word I never did
            it. The way I got this hurt on my forehead was—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1282">"Arrest him, constable!" cried Holmes. "I will swear out the warrant" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1284">The constable moved reluctantly forward—hesitated—stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1287">Hillyer broke out with another appeal. "Oh, Archy, don't let them do it; it would kill
            mother! <i>You</i> know how I got the hurt. Tell them, and save me,
            Archy; save me!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1292">Stillman worked his way to the front, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1294">"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be afraid." Then he said to the house, "Never mind how he
            got the hurt; it hasn't anything to do with this case, and isn't of any consequence." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1296">"God bless you, Archy, for a true friend!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1298">"Hurrah for Archy! Go in, boy, and play 'em a knock-down flush to their two pair 'n' a
            jack!" shouted the house, pride in their home talent and a patriotic sentiment of
            loyalty to it rising suddenly in the public heart and changing the whole attitude of the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1300">Young Stillman waited for the noise to cease; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1302">"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand by that door yonder, and Constable Harris to stand by
            the other one here, and not let anybody leave the room. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1304">"Said and done. Go on, old man!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1306">"The criminal is present, I believe. I will show him to you before long, in case I am
            right in my guess. Now I will tell you all about the tragedy, from start to finish. The
            motive <i>wasn't </i>robbery; it was revenge. The murderer <i>wasn't</i> light-witted. He <i>didn't</i> stand six
            hundred and twenty-two feet away. He <i>didn't </i>get hit with a piece
            of wood. He <i>didn't</i> place the explosive against the cabin. He <i>didn't</i> bring a shot-bag with him, and he <i>wasn't</i> left-handed. With the exception of these errors, the distinguished
            guest's statement of the case is substantially correct." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1330">A comfortable laugh rippled over the house; friend nodded to friend, as much as to say,
            "That's the word, with the bark <i>on</i> it. Good lad, good boy. <i>He</i> ain't lowering his flag any!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1338">The guest's serenity was not disturbed. Stillman resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1341">"I also have some witnesses; and I will presently tell you where you can find some
            more." He held up a piece of coarse wire; the crowd craned their necks to see. "It has a
            smooth coating of melted tallow on it. And here is a candle which is burned half-way
            down. The remaining half of it has marks cut upon it an inch apart. Soon I will tell you
            where I found these things. I will now put aside reasonings, guesses, the impressive
            hitchings of odds and ends of clues together, and the other showy theatricals of the
            detective trade, and tell you in a plain, straightforward way just how this dismal thing
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1343">He paused a moment, for effect—to allow silence and suspense to intensify and
            concentrate the house's interest; then he went on: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1345">"The assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains. It was a good plan, very
            ingenious, and showed an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. It was a plan which was
            well calculated to ward off all suspicion from its inventor. In the <i>first</i> place, he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart, and lit it and timed
            it. He found it took three hours to burn four inches of it. I tried it myself for half
            an hour, awhile ago, up-stairs here, while the inquiry into Flint Buckner's character
            and ways was being conducted in this room, and I arrived in that way at the rate of a
            candle's consumption when sheltered from the wind. Having proved his trial candle's
            rate, he blew it out—I have already shown it to you—and put <i>his</i> inch-marks on a fresh one. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1353">"He put the fresh one into a tin candlestick. Then at the five-hour mark he bored a
            hole through the candle with a red-hot wire. I have already shown you the wire, with a
            smooth coat of tallow on it—tallow that had been melted and had cooled. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1355">"With labor—very hard labor, I should say—he struggled up through the stiff
            chaparral that clothes the steep hillside back of Flint Buckner's place, tugging an
            empty flour-barrel with him. He placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place, and in
            the bottom of it he set the candlestick. Then he measured off about thirty-five feet of
            fuse—the barrel's distance from the back of the cabin. He bored a hole in the side
            of the barrel—here is the large gimlet he did it with. He went on and finished his
            work; and when it was done, one end of the fuse was in Buckner's cabin, and the other
            end, with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder, was in the hole in the
            candle—timed to blow the place up at one o'clock this morning, provided the candle
            was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening—which I am betting it was—and
            provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the
            fuse—which I am also betting there was, though I can't prove it. Boys, the barrel
            is there in the chaparral, the candle's remains are in it in the tin stick; the
            burnt-out fuse is in the gimlet-hole, the other end is down the hill where the late
            cabin stood. I saw them all an hour or two ago, when the Professor here was measuring
            off unimplicated vacancies and collecting relics that hadn't anything to do with the
            case." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1357">He paused. The house drew a long, deep breath, shook its strained cords and muscles
            free and burst into cheers. "Dang him!" said Ham Sandwich, "that's why he was snooping
            around in the chaparral, instead of picking up points out of the P'fessor's game. Looky
            here—he ain't no fool, boys." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1359">"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1361">But Stillman was resuming: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1363">"While we were out yonder an hour or two ago, the owner of the gimlet and the trial
            candle took them from a place where he had concealed them—it was not a good
            place—and carried them to what he probably thought was a better one, two hundred
            yards up in the pine woods, and hid them there, covering them over with pine needles. It
            was there that I found them. The gimlet exactly fits the hole in the barrel. And
            now—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1365">The Extraordinary Man interrupted him. He said, sarcastically: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1367">"We have had a very pretty fairy tale, gentlemen—very pretty indeed. Now I would
            like to ask this young man a question or two." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1370">Some of the boys winced, and Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1372">"I'm afraid Archy's going to catch it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1374">The others lost their smiles and sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1376">"Let us proceed to examine into this fairy tale in a consecutive and orderly
            way—by geometrical progression, so to speak—linking detail to detail in a
            steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent and unassailable march upon this tinsel
            toy fortress of error, the dream fabric of a callow imagination. To begin with, young
            sir, I desire to ask you but three questions at present—<i>at
              present.</i> Did I understand you to say it was your opinion that the supposititious
            candle was lighted at about eight o'clock yesterday evening?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1381">"Yes, sir—about eight." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1383">"Could you say exactly eight?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1385">"Well, no, I couldn't be that exact." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1387">"Um. If a person had been passing along there just about that time, he would have been
            almost sure to encounter that assassin, do you think?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1389">"Yes, I should think so." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1391">"Thank you, that is all. For the present. I say, all <i>for the
              present."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1396">"Dern him. he's laying for Archy," said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1399">"It's so," said Ham Sandwich. "I don't like the look of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1401">Stillman said, glancing at the guest, "I was along there myself at half-past
            eight—no, about nine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1403">"In-deed? This is interesting—this is very interesting. Perhaps you encountered
            the assassin?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1405">"No, I encountered no one." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1407">"Ah. Then—if you will excuse the remark—I do not quite see the relevancy of
            the information." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1409">"It has none. At present. I say it has none—at present." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1411">He paused. Presently he resumed: "I did not encounter the assassin, but I am on his
            track, I am sure, for I believe he is in this room. I will ask you all to pass one by
            one in front of me—here, where there is a good light—so that I can see your
            feet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1413">A buzz of excitement swept the place, and the march began, the guest looking on with an
            iron attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified success. Stillman stooped, shaded
            his eyes with his hand, and gazed down intently at each pair of feet as it passed. Fifty
            men tramped monotonously by—with no result. Sixty. Seventy. The thing was
            beginning to look absurd. The guest remarked, with suave irony:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1415">"Stillman Accuses Sherlock Holmes"Image of Stillman pointing a finger at Sherlock Holmes</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1421">"Assassins appear to be scarce this evening." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1423">The house saw the humor if it, and refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. Ten or twelve
            more candidates tramped by—no, <i>danced </i>by, with airy and
            ridiculous capers which convulsed the spectators—then suddenly Stillman put out
            his hand and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1429">"This is the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1431">"Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhedrim!" roared the crowd; and at once let fly a
            pyrotechnic explosion and dazzle and confusion of stirring remarks inspired by the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1433">At the height of the turmoil the guest stretched out his hand, commanding peace. The
            authority of a great name and a great personality laid its mysterious compulsion upon
            the house, and it obeyed. Out of the panting calm which succeeded, the guest spoke,
            saying, with dignity and feeling: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1435"><i>"This</i> is serious. It strikes at an innocent life. Innocent
            beyond suspicion! Innocent beyond peradventure! Hear me <i>prove</i> it;
            observe how simple a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie. Listen. My
            friends, that lad was never out of my sight yesterday evening at <i>any</i> time!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1445">It made a deep impression. Men turned their eyes upon Stillman with grave inquiry in
            them. His face brightened, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1447">"I <i>knew</i> there was another one!" He stepped briskly to the table
            and glanced at the guest's feet, then up at his face, and said: "You were <i>with</i> him! You were not fifty steps from him when he lit the candle
            that by and by fired the powder!" <i>(Sensation.) "</i>And what is more,
            you furnished the matches yourself !" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1458">Plainly the guest seemed hit; it looked so to the public. He opened his mouth to speak;
            the words did not come freely. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1460">"This—er—this is insanity—this—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1462">Stillman pressed his evident advantage home. He held up a charred match. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1464">"Here <i>is</i> one of them. I found it in the barrel—and there's
              <i>another</i> one there." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1472">The guest found his voice at once. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1475"><i>"Yes—</i>and put them there yourself!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1479">It was recognized a good shot. Stillman retorted. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1481">"It is <i>wax—</i>a breed unknown to this camp. I am ready to be
            searched for the box. Are you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1486">The guest was staggered this time—the dullest eye could see it. He fumbled with
            his hands; once or twice his lips moved, but the words did not come. The house waited
            and watched, in tense suspense, the stillness adding effect to the situation. Presently
            Stillman said, gently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1488">"We are waiting for your decision." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1490">There was silence again during several moments; then the guest answered, in a low
            voice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1492">"I refuse to be searched." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1494">There was no noisy demonstration, but all about the house one voice after another
            muttered: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1496">"That settles it! He's Archy's meat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1498">What to do now? Nobody seemed to know. It was an embarrassing situation for the
            moment—merely, of course, because matters had taken such a sudden and unexpected
            turn that these unpractised minds were not prepared for it, and had come to a
            standstill, like a stopped clock, under the shock. But after a little the machinery
            began to work again, tentatively, and by twos and threes the men put their heads
            together and privately buzzed over this and that and the other proposition. One of these
            propositions met with much favor; it was, to confer upon the assassin a vote of thanks
            for removing Flint Buckner, and let him go. But the cooler heads opposed it, pointing
            out that addled brains in the Eastern states would pronounce it a scandal, and make no
            end of foolish noise about it. Finally the cool heads got the upper hand, and obtained
            general consent to a proposition of their own; their leader then called the house to
            order and stated it—to this effect: that Fetlock Jones be jailed and put upon
            trial. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1500">The motion was carried. Apparently there was nothing further to do now, and the people
            were glad, for, privately, they were impatient to get out and rush to the scene of the
            tragedy, and see whether that barrel and the other things were really there or not. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1503">But no—the break-up got a check. The surprises were not over yet. For a while
            Fetlock Jones had been silently sobbing, unnoticed in the absorbing excitements which
            had been following one another so persistently for some time; but when his arrest and
            trial were decreed, he broke out despairingly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1505">"No! it's no use. I don't want any jail, I don't want any trial; I've had all the hard
            luck I want, and all the miseries. Hang me now, and let me out! It would all come out,
            anyway—there couldn't anything save me. He has told it all, just as if he'd been
            with me and seen it—<i>I</i> don't know how he found out; and
            you'll find the barrel and things, and then I wouldn't have any chance any more. I
            killed him; and <i>you'd</i> have done it too, if he'd treated you like
            a dog, and you only a boy, and weak and poor, and not a friend to help you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1513">"And served him damned well right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. "Looky here, boys—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1515">From the constable: "Order! Order, gentlemen!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1517">A voice: "Did your uncle know what you was up to?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1519">"No, he didn't." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1521">"Did he give you the matches, sure enough?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1523">"Yes, he did; but he didn't know what I wanted them for." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1525">"When you was out on such a business as that, how did you venture to risk having him
            along—and him a <i>detective?</i> How's that?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1530">The boy hesitated, fumbled with his buttons in an embarrassed way, then said, shyly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1532">"I know about detectives, on account of having them in the family; and if you don't
            want them to find out about a thing, it's best to have them around when you do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1535">The cyclone of laughter which greeted this native discharge of wisdom did not modify
            the poor little waif's embarrassment in any large degree.</p>Chapter IX<p id="TwaDoubd1e1540">From a letter to Mrs. Stillman, dated merely "Tuesday." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1542">Fetlock Jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log cabin, and left there
              to await his trial. Constable Harris provided him with a couple of days' rations,
              instructed him to keep a good guard over himself, and promised to look in on him as
              soon as further supplies should be due. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1545">Next morning a score of us went with Hillyer, out of friendship, and helped him bury
              his late relative, the unlamented Buckner, and I acted as first assistant pall-bearer,
              Hillyer acting as chief. Just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy
              stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, limped by with his head down, and I caught the
              scent I had chased around the globe! It was the odor of Paradise to my perishing hope!
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1548">In a moment I was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder. He
              slumped to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had withered him in his tracks; and
              as the boys came running he struggled to his knees and put up his pleading hands to
              me, and out of his chattering jaws he begged me to persecute him no more, and said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1551">"You have hunted me around the world, Sherlock Holmes, yet God is my witness I have
              never done any man harm!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1554">A glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane. That was my work, mother!
              The tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery I felt in that moment, but
              nothing else can ever do it. The boys lifted him up, and gathered about him, and were
              full of pity of him, and said the gentlest and touchingest things to him, and said
              cheer up and don't be troubled, he was among friends now, and they would take care of
              him, and protect him, and hang any man that laid a hand on him. They are just like so
              many mothers, the rough mining-camp boys are, when you wake up the south side of their
              hearts; yes, and just like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up
              the opposite of that muscle. They did everything they could think of to comfort him,
              but nothing succeeded until Wells-Fargo Ferguson, who is a clever strategist, said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1557">"If it's only Sherlock Holmes that's troubling you, you needn't worry any more."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1560">"Why?" asked the forlorn lunatic, eagerly. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1563">"Because he's dead again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1566">"Dead! Dead! Oh, don't trifle with a poor wreck like me. <i>Is
              </i>he dead? On honor, now—is he telling me true, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1573">"True as you're standing there!" said Ham Sandwich, and they all backed up the
              statement in a body. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1576">"They hung him in San Bernardino last week," added Ferguson, clinching the matter,
              "whilst he was searching around after you. Mistook him for another man. They're sorry,
              but they can't help it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1579">"They're a-building him a monument," said Ham Sandwich, with the air of a person who
              had contributed to it, and knew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1582">"James Walker" drew a deep sigh—evidently a sigh of relief—and said
              nothing; but his eyes lost something of their wildness, his countenance cleared
              visibly, and its drawn look relaxed a little. We all went to our cabin, and the boys
              cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for, and while they
              were about it Hillyer and I outfitted him from hat to shoe-leather with new clothes of
              ours, and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him. "Old" is the right word,
              and a pity, too: old by the droop of him, and the frost upon his hair, and the marks
              which sorrow and distress have left upon his face; though he is only in his prime in
              the matter of years. While he ate, we smoked and chatted; and when he was finishing he
              found his voice at last, and of his own accord broke out with his personal history. I
              cannot furnish his exact words, but I will come as near it as I can. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1585">THE "WRONG MAN'S" STORY </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1588">It happened like this: I was in Denver. I had been there many years; sometimes I
              remember how many, sometimes I don't—but it isn't any matter. All of a sudden I
              got a notice to leave, or I would be exposed for a horrible crime committed long
              before—years and years before—in the East. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1591">I knew about that crime, but I was not the criminal; it was a cousin of mine of the
              same name. What should I better do? My head was all disordered by fear, and I didn't
              know. I was allowed very little time—only one day, I think it was. I would be
              ruined if I was published, and the people would lynch me, and not believe what I said.
              It is always the way with lynchings: when they find out it is a mistake they are
              sorry, but it is too late—the same as it was with Mr. Holmes, you see. So I said
              I would sell out and get money to live on, and run away until it blew over and I could
              come back with my proofs. Then I escaped in the night and went a long way off in the
              mountains somewhere, and lived disguised and had a false name. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1594">I got more and more troubled and worried, and my troubles made me see spirits and
              hear voices, and I could not think straight and clear on any subject, but got confused
              and involved and had to give it up, because my head hurt so. It got to be worse and
              worse; more spirits and more voices. They were about me all the time; at first only in
              the night, then in the day too. They were always whispering around my bed and plotting
              against me, and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out, because I got no good rest.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1597">And then came the worst. One night the whispers said, "We'll never manage, because
              we can't <i>see</i> him, and so can't point him out to the people."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1603">They sighed; then one said: "We must bring Sherlock Holmes. He can be here in twelve
              days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1606">They all agreed, and whispered and jibbered with joy. But my heart broke; for I had
              read about that man, and knew what it would be to have him upon my track, with his
              superhuman penetration and tireless energies. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1610">The spirits went away to fetch him, and I got up at once in the middle of the night
              and fled away, carrying nothing but the hand-bag that had my money in it—thirty
              thousand dollars; two-thirds of it are in the bag there yet. It was forty days before
              that man caught up on my track. I just escaped. From habit he had written his real
              name on a tavern register, but had scratched it out and written "Dagget Barclay" in
              the place of it. But fear gives you a watchful eye and keen, and I read the true name
              through the scratches, and fled like a deer. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1613">He has hunted me all over this world for three years and a half—the Pacific
              states, Australasia, India—everywhere you can think of; then back to Mexico and
              up to California again, giving me hardly any rest; but that name on the registers
              always saved me, and what is left of me is alive yet. And I am <i>so</i> tired! A cruel time he has given me, yet I give you my honor I have never
              harmed him nor any man. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1619">That was the end of the story, and it stirred those boys to bloodheat, he sure of
              it. As for me—each word burnt a hole in me where it struck. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1622">We voted that the old man should bunk with us, and be my guest and Hillyer's. I
              shall keep my own counsel, naturally; but as soon as he is well rested and nourished,
              I shall take him to Denver and rehabilitate his fortunes. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1625">The boys gave the old fellow the bone-smashing good-fellowship handshake of the
              mines, and then scattered away to spread the news. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1628">At dawn next morning Wells-Fargo Ferguson and Ham Sandwich called us softly out, and
              said, privately: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1631">"That news about the way that old stranger has been treated has spread all around,
              and the camps are up. They are piling in from everywhere, and are going to lynch the
              P'fessor. Constable Harris is in a dead funk, and has telephoned the sheriff. Come
              along!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1634">We started on a run. The others were privileged to feel as they chose, but in my
              heart's privacy I hoped the sheriff would arrive in time; for I had small desire that
              Sherlock Holmes should hang for my deeds, as you can easily believe. I had heard a
              good deal about the sheriff, but </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1637">for reassurance's sake I asked: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1640">"Can he stop a mob?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1643">"Can <i>he</i> stop a mob! Can Jack <i>Fairfax</i>
              stop a mob! Well, I should smile! Ex-desperado—nineteen scalps on his string.
              Can <i>he!</i> Oh, I <i>say!"</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1659">As we tore up the gulch, distant cries and shouts and yells rose faintly on the
              still air, and grew steadily in strength as we raced along. Roar after roar burst out,
              stronger and stronger, nearer and nearer; and at last, when we closed up upon the
              multitude massed in the open area in front of the tavern, the crash of sound was
              deafening. Some brutal roughs from Daly's gorge had Holmes in their grip, and he was
              the calmest man there; a contemptuous smile played about his lips, and if any fear of
              death was in his British heart, his iron personality was master of it and no sign of
              it was allowed to appear. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1662">"Come to a vote, men!" This from one of the Daly gang, Shadbelly Higgins. "Quick! is
              it hang, or shoot?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1665">"Neither!" shouted one of his comrades. "He'll he alive again in a week; burning's
              the only permanency for <i>him."</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1671">The gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a thundercrash of approval, and
              went struggling and surging toward the prisoner, and closed around him, shouting,
              "Fire! fire's the ticket!" They dragged him to the horse-post, backed him against it,
              chained him to it, and piled wood and pine cones around him waist-deep. Still the
              strong face did not blench, and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1674">"A match! fetch a match!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1677">Shadbelly struck it, shaded it with his hand, stooped, and held it under a pine
              cone. A deep silence fell upon the mob. The cone caught, a tiny flame flickered about
              it a moment or two. I seemed to catch the sound of distant hoofs—it grew more
              distinct—still more and more distinct, more and more definite, but the absorbed
              crowd did not appear to notice it. The match went out. The man struck another,
              stooped, and again the flame rose; this time it took hold and began to
              spread—here and there men turned away their faces. The executioner stood with
              the charred match in his fingers, watching his work. The hoof-beats turned a
              projecting crag, and now they came thundering down upon us. Almost the next moment
              there was a shout: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1680">"The sheriff!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1683">And straightway he came tearing into the midst, stood his horse almost on his hind
              feet, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1686">"Fall back, you gutter-snipes!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1689">He was obeyed. By all but their leader. He stood his ground, and his hand went to
              his revolver. The sheriff covered him promptly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1692">"Drop your hand, you parlor desperado. Kick the fire away. Now unchain the
              stranger." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1696">The parlor desperado obeyed. Then the sheriff made a speech; sitting his horse at
              martial ease, and not warming his words with any touch of fire, but delivering them in
              a measured and deliberate way, and in a tone which harmonized with their character and
              made them impressively disrespectful. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1699">"You're a nice lot—now ain't you? Just about eligible to travel with this bilk
              here—Shadbelly Higgins—this loud-mouthed sneak that shoots people in the
              back and calls himself a desperado. If there's anything I do particularly despise,
              it's a lynching mob; I've never seen one that had a man in it. It has to tally up a
              hundred against one before it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor. It's
              made up of cowards, and so is the community that breeds it; and ninety-nine times out
              of a hundred the sheriff's another one." He paused—apparently to turn that last
              idea over in his mind and taste the juice of it—then he went on: "The sheriff
              that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the lowest-down coward there is. By
              the statistics there was a hundred and eighty-two of them drawing sneak pay in America
              last year. By the way it's going, pretty soon there 'll be a new disease in the
                doctor-books—<i>sheriff complaint."</i> That idea pleased
              him—any one could see it. "People will say, 'Sheriff sick again?' 'Yes; got the
              same old thing.' And next there 'll be a new title. People won't say, 'He's running
              for sheriff of Rapaho County,' for instance; they'll say, 'He's running for Coward of
              Rapaho.' Lord, the idea of a grown-up person being afraid of a lynch mob!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1705">He turned an eye on the captive, and said, "Stranger, who are you, and what have you
              been doing?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1708">"My name is Sherlock Holmes, and I have not been doing anything." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1711">It was wonderful, the impression which the sound of that name made on the sheriff,
              notwithstanding he must have come posted. He spoke up with feeling, and said it was a
              blot on the county that a man whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their
              fame and their ingenuity, and whose histories of them had won every reader's heart by
              the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting, should be visited under the Stars
              and Stripes by an outrage like this. He apologized in the name of the whole nation,
              and made Holmes a most handsome bow, and told Constable Harris to see him to his
              quarters, and hold himself personally responsible if he was molested again. Then he
              turned to the mob and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1714">"Hunt your holes, you scum!" which they did; then he said: "Follow me, Shadbelly;
              I'll take care of your case myself. No—keep your popgun; whenever I see the day
              that I'll be afraid to have you behind me with that thing, it 'll be time for me to
              join last year's hundred and eighty-two"; and he rode off in a walk, Shadbelly
              following. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1717">When we were on our way back to our cabin, toward breakfast-time, we ran upon the
              news that Fetlock Jones had escaped from his lock-up in the night and is gone! Nobody
              is sorry. Let his uncle track him out if he likes; it is in his line; the camp is not
              interested.</p>Chapter X<p id="TwaDoubd1e1723"><i>Ten days later.</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1728">"James Walker" is all right in body now, and his mind shows improvement too. I start
              with him for Denver to-morrow morning. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1731"><i>Next night. Brief note, mailed at a way-station.</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1736">As we were starting, this morning, Hillyer whispered to me: "Keep this news from

There has been a
            wedding, between a handsome young man of slender means and a rich young girl—a
            case of love at first sight and a precipitate marriage; a marriage bitterly opposed by
            the girl's widowed father. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e140">Jacob Fuller, the bridegroom, is twenty-six years old, is of an old but unconsidered
            family which had by compulsion emigrated from Sedgemoor, and for King James's purse's
            profit, so everybody said—some maliciously the rest merely because they believed
            it. The bride is nineteen and beautiful. She is intense, high-strung, romantic,
            immeasurably proud of her Cavalier blood, and passionate in her love for her young
            husband. For its sake she braved her father's displeasure, endured his reproaches,
            listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions and went from his house
            without his blessing, proud and happy in the proofs she was thus giving of the quality
            of the affection which had made its home in her heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e142">The morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her. Her husband put aside
            her proffered caresses, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e144">"Sit down. I have something to say to you. I loved you. That was before I asked your
            father to give you to me. His refusal is not my grievance—I could have endured
            that. But the things he said of me to you—that is a different matter.
            There—you needn't speak; I know quite well what they were; I got them from
            authentic sources. Among other things he said that my character was written in my face;
            that I was treacherous, a dissembler, a coward, and a brute without sense of pity or
            compassion: the 'Sedgemoor trade-mark,' he called it—and 'white-sleeve badge.' Any
            other man in my place would have gone to his house and shot him down like a dog. I
            wanted to do it, and was minded to do it, but a better thought came to me: to put him to
            shame; to break his heart; to kill him by inches. How to do it? Through my treatment of
            you, his idol! I would marry you; and then—Have patience. You will see. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e146">From that moment onward, for three months, the young wife suffered all the
            humiliations, all the insults, all the miseries that the diligent and inventive mind of
            the husband could contrive, save physical injuries only. Her strong pride stood by her,
            and she kept the secret of her troubles. Now and then the husband said, "Why don't you
            go to your father and tell him?" Then he invented new tortures, applied them, and asked
            again. She always answered, "He shall never know by my mouth," and taunted him with his
            origin; said she was the lawful slave of a scion of slaves, and must obey, and
            would—up to that point, but no further; he could kill her if he liked, but he
            could not break her; it was not in the Sedgemoor breed to do it. At the end of the three
            months he said, with a dark significance in his manner, "I have tried all things but
            one"—and waited for her reply. "Try that," she said, and curled her lip in
            mockery. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e148">That night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes, then said to her: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e150">"Get up and dress!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e152">She obeyed—as always, without a word. He led her half a mile from the house, and
            proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public road; and succeeded, she
            screaming and struggling. He gagged her then, struck her across the face with his
            cowhide, and set his bloodhounds on her. They tore the clothes off her, and she was
            naked. He called the dogs off, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e154">"You will be found—by the passing public. They will be dropping along about three
            hours from now, and will spread the news—do you hear? Good-by. You have seen the
            last of me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e156">He went away then. She moaned to herself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e159">"I shall bear a child—to <i>him!</i> God grant it may be a boy!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e164">The farmers released her by and by—and spread the news, which was natural. They
            raised the country with lynching intentions, but the bird had flown. The young wife shut
            herself up in her father's house; he shut himself up with her, and thenceforth would see
            no one. His pride was broken, and his heart; so he wasted away, day by day, and even his
            daughter rejoiced when death relieved him. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e166">Then she sold the estate and disappeared.</p>Chapter 2<p id="TwaDoubd1e171">In 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded New England village,
            with no company but a little boy about five years old. She did her own work, she
            discouraged acquaintanceships, and had none. The butcher, the baker, and the others that
            served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was
            Stillman, and that she called the child Archy. Whence she came they had not been able to
            find out, but they said she talked like a Southerner. The child had no playmates and no
            comrade, and no teacher but the mother. She taught him diligently and intelligently, and
            was satisfied with the results—even a little proud of them. One day Archy said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e173">"Mamma, am I different from other children?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e175">"Well, I suppose not. Why?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e177">"There was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had been by and I
            said yes, and she said how long since I saw him and I said I hadn't seen him at all, and
            she said how did I know he'd been by, then, and I said because I smelt his track on the
            sidewalk, and she said I was a dum fool and made a mouth at me. What did she do that
            for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e179">The young woman turned white, and said to herself, "It's a birth mark! The gift of the
            bloodhound is in him." She snatched the boy to her breast and hugged him passionately,
            saying, "God has appointed the way!" Her eyes were burning with a fierce light, and her
            breath came short and quick with excitement. She said to herself: "The puzzle is solved
            now; many a time it has been a mystery to me, the impossible things the child has done
            in the dark, but it is all clear to me now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e181">She set him in his small chair, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e183">"Wait a little till I come, dear; then we will talk about the matter." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e185">She went up to her room and took from her dressing-table several small articles and put
            them out of sight: a nail-file on the floor under the bed; a pair of nail-scissors under
            the bureau; a small ivory paper-knife under the wardrobe. Then she returned, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e187">"There! I have left some things which I ought to have brought down." She named them,
            and said, "Run up and bring them, dear." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e189">The child hurried away on his errand and was soon back again with the things. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e192">"Did you have any difficulty, dear?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e194">"No, mamma; I only went where you went." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e196">During his absence she had stepped to the bookcase, taken several books from the bottom
            shelf, opened each, passed her hand over a page, noting its number in her memory, then
            restored them to their places. Now she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e198">"I have been doing something while you have been gone, Archy. Do you think you can find
            out what it was?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e200">The boy went to the bookcase and got out the books that had been touched, and opened
            them at the pages which had been stroked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e202">The mother took him in her lap, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e204">"I will answer your question now, dear. I have found out that in one way you are quite
            different from other people. You can see in the dark, you can smell what other people
            cannot, you have the talents of a bloodhound. They are good and valuable things to have,
            but you must keep the matter a secret. If people found it out, they would speak of you
            as an odd child, a strange child, and children would be disagreeable to you, and give
            you nicknames. In this world one must be like everybody else if he doesn't want to
            provoke scorn or envy or jealousy. It is a great and fine distinction which has been
            born to you, and I am glad; but you will keep it a secret, for mamma's sake, won't you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e206">The child promised, without understanding. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e208">All the rest of the day the mother's brain was busy with excited thinkings; with plans,
            projects, schemes, each and all of them uncanny, grim, and dark. Yet they lit up her
            face; lit it with a fell light of their own; lit it with vague fires of hell. She was in
            a fever of unrest; she could not sit, stand, read, sew; there was no relief for her but
            in movement. She tested her boy's gift in twenty ways, and kept saying to herself all
            the time, with her mind in the past: "He broke my father's heart, and night and day all
            these years I have tried, and all in vain, to think out a way to break his. I have found
            it now—I have found it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e210">When night fell, the demon of unrest still possessed her. She went on with her tests;
            with a candle she traversed the house from garret to cellar, hiding pins, needles,
            thimbles, spools, under pillows, under carpets, in cracks in the walls, under the coal
            in the bin; then sent the little fellow in the dark to find them; which he did, and was
            happy and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e212">From this time forward life took on a new complexion for her. She said, "The future is
            secure—I can wait, and enjoy the waiting." The most of her lost interests revived.
            She took up music again, and languages, drawing, painting, and the other long-discarded
            delights of her maidenhood. She was happy once more, and felt again the zest of life. As
            the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy, and was contented with it.
            Not altogether, but nearly that. The soft side of his heart was larger than the other
            side of it. It was his only defect, in her eyes. But she considered that his love for
            her and worship of her made up for it. He was a good hater—that was well; but it
            was a question if the materials of his hatreds were of as tough and enduring a quality
            as those of his friendships—and that was not so well. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e215">The years drifted on. Archy was become a handsome, shapely, athletic youth, courteous,
            dignified, companionable, pleasant in his ways, and looking perhaps a trifle older than
            he was, which was sixteen. One evening his mother said she had something of grave
            importance to say to him, adding that he was old enough to hear it now, and old enough
            and possessed of character enough and stability enough to carry out a stern plan which
            she had been for years contriving and maturing. Then she told him her bitter story, in
            all its naked atrociousness. For a while the boy was paralyzed; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e217">"I understand. We are Southerners; and by our custom and nature there is but one
            atonement. I will search him out and kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e219">"Kill him? No! Death is release, emancipation; death is a favor. Do I owe him favors?
            You must not hurt a hair of his head." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e221">The boy was lost in thought awhile; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e223">"You are all the world to me, and your desire is my law and my pleasure. Tell me what
            to do and I will do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e225">The mother's eyes beamed with satisfaction, and she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e227">"You will go and find him. I have known his hiding-place for eleven years; it cost me
            five years and more of inquiry, and much money, to locate it. He is a quartz-miner in
            Colorado, and well-to-do. He lives in Denver. His name is Jacob Fuller. There—it
            is the first time I have spoken it since that unforgettable night. Think! That name
            could have been yours if I had not saved you that shame and furnished you a cleaner one.
            You will drive him from that place; you will hunt him down and drive him again; and yet
            again, and again, and again, persistently, relentlessly, poisoning his life, filling it
            with mysterious terrors, loading it with weariness and misery, making him wish for
            death, and that he had a suicide's courage; you will make of him another Wandering Jew;
            he shall know no rest any more, no peace of mind, no placid sleep; you shall shadow him,
            cling to him, persecute him, till you break his heart, as he broke my father's and
            mine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e229">"I will obey, mother." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e231">"I believe it, my child. The preparations are all made; everything is ready. Here is a
            letter of credit; spend freely, there is no lack of money. At times you may need
            disguises. I have provided them; also some other conveniences." She took from the drawer
            of the typewriter-table several squares of paper. They all bore these typewritten
            words:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e233"><i>$10,000 REWARD</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e237"><i>It is believed that a certain man who is wanted in an Eastern
                state is sojourning here. In 1880, in the night, he tied his young wife to a tree by
                the public road, cut her across the face with a cowhide, and made his dogs tear her
                clothes from her, leaving her naked. He left her there, and fled the country. A

                address.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e242">"When you have found him and acquainted yourself with his scent, you will go in the
            night and placard one of these upon the building he occupies, and another one upon the
            post-office or in some other prominent place. It will be the talk of the region. At
            first you must give him several days in which to force a sale of his belongings at
            something approaching their value. We will ruin him by and by, but gradually; we must
            not impoverish him at once, for that could bring him to despair and injure his health,
            possibly kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e244">She took three or four more typewritten forms from the
            drawer—duplicates—and read one:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e246">. . . . . . . . . ., . . . . . . . . . ., 18. . . .</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e249"><i>To Jacob Fuller:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e253"><i>You have . . . . . . days in which to settle your affairs. You

That is sure."</p>Chapter III<p id="TwaDoubd1e275">Extracts from letters to the mother:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e277">DENVER, <i>April 3, 1897</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e282"><i>I have now been living several days in the same hotel with Jacob
                Fuller. I have his scent; I could track him through ten divisions of infantry and
                find him. I have often been near him and heard him talk. He owns a good mine, and
                has a fair income from it; but he is not rich. He learned mining in a good
                way—by working at it for wages. He is a cheerful creature, and his forty-three
                years sit lightly upon him; he could pass for a younger man—say thirty-six or
                thirty-seven. He has never married again—passes himself off for a widower. He
                stands well, is liked, is popular, and has many friends. Even I feel a drawing
                toward him—the paternal blood in me making its claim. How blind and
                unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature—the most of them, in
                fact! My task is become hard now—you realize it? you comprehend, and make
                allowances?—and the fire of it has cooled, more than I like to confess to
                myself, But I will carry it out. Even with the pleasure paled, the duty remains, and
                I will not spare him.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e286"><i>And for my help, a sharp resentment rises in me when I reflect
                that he who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not suffered by it.
                The lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character, and in the change he is
                happy. He, the guilty party, is absolved from all suffering; you, the innocent, are
                borne down with it. But be comforted—he shall harvest his share.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e290">SILVER GULCH, <i>May 19</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e295"><i>I placarded Form No. 1 at midnight of April 3; an hour later I
                slipped Form No. 2 under his chamber door, notifying him to leave Denver at or
                before 11.50 the night of the 14th.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e299"><i>Some late bird of a reporter stole one of my placards, then hunted
                the town over and found the other one, and stole that. In this manner he
                accomplished what the profession call a "scoop"—that is, he got a valuable
                item, and saw to it that no other paper got it. And so his paper—the principal
                one in the town—had it in glaring type on the editorial page in the morning,
                followed by a Vesuvian opinion of our wretch a column long, which wound up by adding
                a thousand dollars to our reward on the paper's account! The journals out here know
                how to do the noble thing—when there's business in it.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e303"><i>At breakfast I occupied my usual seat—selected because it
                afforded a view of papa Fuller's face, and was near enough for me to hear the talk
                that went on at his table. Seventy-five or a hundred people were in the room, and
                all discussing that item, and saying they hoped the seeker would find that rascal
                and remove the pollution of his presence from the town—with a rail, or a
                bullet, or something.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e307"><i>When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leave—folded
                up—in one hand, and the newspaper in the other; and it gave me more than half
                a pang to see him. His cheerfulness was all gone, and he looked old and pinched and
                ashy. And then—only think of the things he had to listen to! Mamma, he heard
                his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and characterizations drawn
                from the very dictionaries and phrase-books of Satan's own authorized editions down
                below. And more than that, he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them. His
                applause tasted bitter in his mouth, though; he could not disguise that from me; and
                it was observable that his appetite was gone; he only nibbled; he couldn't eat.
                Finally a man said:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e311"><i>"It is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing
                what this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel. I hope so."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e316"><i>Ah, dear, it was pitiful the way Fuller winced, and glanced around
                scared! He couldn't endure any more, and got up and left.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e320"><i>During several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in
                Mexico, and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could, and give the
                property his personal attention. He played his cards well; said he would take
                $40,000—a quarter in cash, the rest in safe notes; but that as he greatly
                needed money on account of his new purchase, he would diminish his terms for cash in
                full, He sold out for $30,000. And then, what do you think he did? He asked for
                greenbacks, and took them, saying the man in Mexico was a New-Englander, with a head
                full of crotchets, and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts. People thought it
                queer, since a draft on New York could produce greenbacks quite conveniently. There
                was talk of this odd thing, but only for a day; that is as long as any topic lasts
                in Denver.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e324"><i>I was watching, all the time. As soon as the sale was completed
                and the money paid—which was on the 11th—I began to stick to Fuller's
                track without dropping it for a moment. That night—no, 12th, for it was a
                little past midnight—I tracked him to his room, which was four doors from mine
                in the same hall; then I went back and put on my muddy day-laborer disguise,
                darkened my complexion, and sat down in my room in the gloom, with a gripsack handy,
                with a change in it, and my door ajar. For I suspected that the bird would take wing
                now. In half an hour an old woman passed by, carrying a grip: I caught the familiar
                whiff, and followed with my grip, for it was Fuller. He left the hotel by a side
                entrance, and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three
                blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness, and got into a two-horse hack, which of
                course was waiting for him by appointment. I took a seat (uninvited) on the trunk
                platform behind, and we drove briskly off. We drove ten miles, and the hack stopped
                at a way-station and was discharged. Fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow
                under the awning, as far as he could get from the light; I went inside, and watched
                the ticket-office. Fuller bought no ticket; I bought none. Presently the train came
                along, and he boarded a car; I entered the same car at the other end, and came down
                the aisle and took the seat behind him. When he paid the conductor and named his
                objective point, I dropped back several seats, while the conductor was changing a
                bill, and when he came to me I paid to the same place—about a hundred miles
                westward.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e328"><i>From that time for a week on end he led me a dance. He traveled
                here and there and yonder—always on a general westward trend—but he boas
                not a woman after the first day. He was a laborer, like myself, and wore bushy false
                whiskers. His outfit was perfect, and he could do the character without thinking
                about it, for he had served the trade for wages. His nearest friend could not have
                recognized him. At last he located himself here, the obscurest little mountain camp
                in Montana; he has a shanty, and goes out prospecting daily; is gone all day, and
                avoids society. I am living at a miner's boardinghouse, and it is an awful place:
                the bunks, the food, the dirt—everything.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e332"><i>We have been here four weeks, and in that time I have seen him but
                once; but every night I go over his track and post myself. As soon as he engaged a
                shanty here I went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed that Denver hotel to
                keep my baggage till I should send for it. I need nothing here but a change of army
                shirts, and I brought that with me.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e336">SILVER GULCH, <i>June 12</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e341"><i>The Denver episode has never found its way here, I think. I know
                the most of the men in camp, and they have never referred to it, at least in my
                hearing. Fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions. He has located a
                claim, two miles away, in an out-of-the-way place in the mountains; it promises very
                well, and he is working it diligently. Ah, but the change in him! He never smiles,
                and he keeps quite to himself, consorting with no one—he who was so fond of

                year before you were married; and the documents to prove it are innumerable. Last

                would. If I should say, "It is now known that he was not the man wanted, but another
                man—a man who once bore the same name, but discarded it for good
                reasons"—would that answer? But the Denver people would wake up then and say
                "Oho!" and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks, and say, "Why did he
                run away if he wasn't the right man?—it is too thin." If I failed to find him

                very humanly stupid when excited. He had been stopping in that house ten days; I
                almost know, now, that he stops long nowhere, the past six or eight months, but is
                restless and has to keep moving. I understand that feeling! and I know what it is to
                feel it. He still uses the name he had registered when I came so near catching him
                nine months ago—"James Walker"; doubtless the same he adopted when he fled
                from Silver Gulch. An unpretending man, and has small taste for fancy names. I
                recognized the hand easily, through its slight disguise. A square man, and not good

                Hope Cañon; I traced him to a point thirty miles from here, but there I lost
                the trail; some one gave him a lift in a wagon, I suppose. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e463"><i>I am taking a rest, now—modified by searchings for the lost
                trail. I was tired to death, mother, and low-spirited, and sometimes coming
                uncomfortably near to losing hope; but the miners in this little camp are good
                fellows, and I am used to their sort this long time back; and their breezy ways
                freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles. I have been here a month. I am
                cabining with a young fellow named "Sammy" Hillyer, about twenty-five, the only son
                of his mother—like me—and loves her dearly, and writes to her every
                week—part of which is like me. He is a timid body, and in the matter of
                intellect—well, he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire; but no
                matter, he is well liked; he is good and fine, and it is meat and bread and rest and
                luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again. I wish "James Walker"
                could have it. He had friends; he liked company. That brings up that picture of him,
                the time that I saw him last. The pathos of it! It comes before me often and often.
                At that very time, poor thing, I was girding up my conscience to make him move on
                again!</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e467"><i>Hillyer's heart is better than mine, better than anybody's in the
                community, I suppose, for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the
                camp—Flint Buckner—and the only man Flint ever talks with or allows to
                talk with him. He says he knows Flint's history, and that it is trouble that has
                made him what he is, and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can. Now
                none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a lodger like Flint
                Buckner, from all I hear about him outside. I think that this one detail will give
                you a better idea of Sammy's character than any labored-out description I could
                furnish you of him. In one of our talks he said something about like this: "Flint is
                a kinsman of mine, and he pours out all his troubles to me—empties his breast
                from time to time, or I reckon it would burst. There couldn't be any unhappier man,
                Archy Stillman; his life had been made up of misery of mind—he isn't near as
                old as he looks. He has lost the feel of reposefulness and peace—oh, years and
                years ago! He doesn't know what good luck is—never has had any; often says he
                wishes he was in the other hell, he is so tired of this one."</i></p>Chapter IV<p id="TwaDoubd1e474"><i>No real gentleman will tell the naked truth in the presence of
              ladies.</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e478">It was a crisp and spicy morning in early October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with
            the glory-fires of autumn, hung burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge
            provided by kind Nature for the wingless wild things that have their homes in the
            tree-tops and would visit together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and
            yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the
            sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere;
            far in he empty sky a solitary esophagus[1] slept upon motionless
            wing; everywhere brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e483">October is the time—1900; Hope Cañon is the place, a silver-mining camp
            away down in the Esmeralda region. It is a secluded spot, high and remote; recent as to
            discovery; thought by its occupants to be rich in metal—a year or two's
            prospecting will decide that matter one way or the other. For inhabitants, the camp has
            about two hundred miners, one white woman and child, several Chinese washermen, five
            squaws, and a dozen vagrant buck Indians in rabbit-skin robes, battered plug hats, and
            tin-can necklaces. There are no mills as yet; no church, no newspaper. The camp has
            existed but two years; it has made no big strike; the world is ignorant of its name and
            place. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e485">On both sides of the cañon the mountains rise wall-like, three thousand feet,
            and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the
            sun only once a day, when he sails over at noon. The village is a couple of miles long;
            the cabins stand well apart from each other. The tavern is the only "frame"
            house—the only house, one might say. It occupies a central position, and is the
            evening resort of the population. They drink there, and play seven-up and dominoes; also
            billiards, for there is a table, crossed all over with torn places repaired with
            court-plaster; there are some cues, but no leathers; some chipped balls which clatter
            when they run, and do not slow up gradually, but stop suddenly and sit down; there is a
            part of a cube of chalk, with a projecting jag of flint in it; and the man who can score
            six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bar's expense. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e487">Flint Buckner's cabin was the last one of the village, going south; his silver-claim
            was at the other end of the village, northward, and a little beyond the last hut in that
            direction. He was a sour creature, unsociable, and had no companionships. People who had
            tried to get acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him. His history was not
            known. Some believed that Sammy Hillyer knew it; others said no. If asked, Hillyer said
            no, he was not acquainted with it. Flint had a meek English youth of sixteen or
            seventeen with him, whom he treated roughly, both in public and in private; and of
            course this lad was applied to for information, but with no success. Fetlock
            Jones—name of the youth—said that Flint picked him up on a prospecting
            tramp, and as he had neither home nor friends in America, he had found it wise to stay
            and take Buckner's hard usage for the sake of the salary, which was bacon and beans.
            Further than this he could offer no testimony. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e489">Fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now, and under his meek exterior he was
            slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and humiliations which his master had put
            upon him. For the meek suffer bitterly from these hurts; more bitterly, perhaps, than do
            the manlier sort, who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the limit of
            endurance has been reached. Good-hearted people wanted to help Fetlock out of his
            trouble, and tried to get him to leave Buckner; but the boy showed fright at the
            thought, and said he "dasn't." Pat Riley urged him, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e491">"You leave the damned hunks and come with me; don't you be afraid. I'll take care of
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e496">The boy thanked him with tears in his eyes, but shuddered and said he "dasn't risk it";
            he said Flint would catch him alone, some time, in the night, and then—"Oh, it
            makes me sick, Mr. Riley, to think of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e498">Others said, "Run away from him; we'll stake you; skip out for the coast some night."
            But all these suggestions failed; he said Flint would hunt him down and fetch him back,
            just for meanness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e500">The people could not understand this. The boy's miseries went steadily on, week after
            week. It is quite likely that the people would have understood if they had known how he
            was employing his spare time. He slept in an out-cabin near Flint's; and there, nights,
            he nursed his bruises and his humiliations, and studied and studied over a single
            problem—how he could murder Flint Buckner and not be found out. It was the only
            joy he had in life; these hours were the only ones in the twenty-four which he looked
            forward to with eagerness and spent in happiness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e503">He thought of poison. No—that would not serve; the inquest would reveal where it
            was procured and who had procured it. He thought of a shot in the back in a lonely place
            when Flint would be homeward bound at midnight—his unvarying hour for the trip.
            No—somebody might be near, and catch him. He thought of stabbing him in his sleep.
            No—he might strike an inefficient blow, and Flint would seize him. He examined a
            hundred different ways—none of them would answer; for in even the very obscurest
            and secretest of them there was always the fatal defect of a <i>risk,</i> a chance, a possibility that he might be found out. He would have none of
            that. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e508">But he was patient, endlessly patient. There was no hurry, he said to himself. He would
            never leave Flint till he left him a corpse; there was no hurry—he would find the
            way. It was somewhere, and he would endure shame and pain and misery until he found it.
            Yes, somewhere there was a way which would leave not a trace, not even the faintest clue
            to the murderer—there was no hurry—he would find that way, and
            then—oh, then, it would just be good to be alive! Meantime he would diligently
            keep up his reputation for meekness; and also, as always theretofore, he would allow no
            one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about his oppressor. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e510">Two days before the before-mentioned October morning Flint had bought some things, and
            he and Fetlock had brought them home to Flint's cabin: a fresh box of candles, which
            they put in the corner; a tin can of blasting-powder, which they placed upon the
            candle-box; a keg of blasting-powder, which they placed under Flint's bunk; a huge coil
            of fuse, which they hung on a peg. Fetlock reasoned that Flint's mining operations had
            outgrown the pick, and that blasting was about to begin now. He had seen blasting done,
            and he had a notion of the process, but he had never helped in it. His conjecture was
            right—blasting-time had come. In the morning the pair carried fuse, drills, and
            the powder-can to the shaft; it was now eight feet deep, and to get into it and out of
            it a short ladder was used. They descended, and by command Fetlock held the
            drill—without any instructions as to the right way to hold it—and Flint
            proceeded to strike. The sledge came down; the drill sprang out of Fetlock's hand,
            almost as a matter of course. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e512">"You mangy son of a nigger, is that any way to hold a drill? Pick it up! Stand it up!
            There—hold fast. D— you! <i>I'll</i> teach you!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e517">At the end of an hour the drilling was finished. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e519">"Now, then, charge it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e521">The boy started to pour in the powder. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e523">"Idiot!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e525">A heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e527">"Get up! You can't lie sniveling there. Now, then, stick in the fuse <i>first. Now</i> put in the powder. Hold on, hold on! Are you going to fill the hole
              <i>all</i> up? Of all the sap-headed milksops I—Put in some
            dirt! Put in some gravel! Tamp it down! Hold on, hold on! Oh, great Scott! get out of
            the way!" He snatched the iron and tamped the charge himself, meantime cursing and
            blaspheming like a fiend. Then he fired the fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and ran
            fifty yards away, Fetlock following. They stood waiting a few minutes, then a great
            volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion; after a
            little there was a shower of descending stones; then all was serene again. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e535">"I wish to God you'd been in it!" remarked the master. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e538">They went down the shaft, cleaned it out, drilled another hole, and put in another
            charge. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e540">"Look here! How much fuse are you proposing to waste? Don't you know how to time a
            fuse?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e542">"No, sir." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e544">"You <i>don't!</i> Well, if you don't beat anything <i>I</i> ever saw!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e552">He climbed out of the shaft and spoke down: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e554">"Well, idiot, are you going to be all day? Cut the fuse and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e556">The trembling creature began: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e558">"If you please, sir, I—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e560">"You talk back to <i>me?</i> Cut it and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e565">The boy cut and lit. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e567">"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! I wish you were in—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e570">In his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft and ran. The boy was aghast. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e572">"Oh, my God! Help. Help! Oh, save me!" he implored. "Oh, what can I do! What <i>can</i> I do!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e577">He backed against the wall as tightly as he could; the sputtering fuse frightened the
            voice out of him; his breath stood still; he stood gazing and impotent; in two seconds,
            three seconds, four he would be flying toward the sky torn to fragments. Then he had an
            inspiration. He sprang at the fuse; severed the inch of it that was left above ground,
            and was saved. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e579">He sank down limp and half lifeless with fright, his strength gone; but he muttered
            with a deep joy: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e581">"He has learnt me! I knew there was a way, if I would wait." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e583">After a matter of five minutes Buckner stole to the shaft, looking worried and uneasy,
            and peered down into it. He took in the situation; he saw what had happened. He lowered
            the ladder, and the boy dragged himself weakly up it. He was very white. His appearance
            added something to Buckner's uncomfortable state, and he said, with a show of regret and
            sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from lack of practice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e585">"It was an accident, you know. Don't say anything about it to anybody; I was excited,
            and didn't notice what I was doing. You're not looking well; you've worked enough for
            to-day; go down to my cabin and eat what you want, and rest. It's just an accident, you
            know, on account of my being excited." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e587">"It scared me," said the lad, as he started away; "but I learnt something, so I don't
            mind it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e589">"Damned easy to please!" muttered Buckner, following him with his eye. I wonder if
            he'll tell? Mightn't he?... I wish it <i>had</i> killed him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e594">The boy took no advantage of his holiday in the matter of resting; he employed it in
            work, eager and feverish and happy work. A thick growth of chaparral extended down the
            mountainside clear to Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's labor was done in the dark
            intricacies of that stubborn growth; the rest of it was done in his own shanty. At last
            all was complete, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e596">"If he's got any suspicions that I'm going to tell on him, he won't keep them long,
            to-morrow. He will see that I am the same milksop as I always was—all day and the
            next. And the day after to-morrow night there 'll be an end of him; nobody will ever
            guess who finished him up nor how it was done. He dropped me the idea his own self, and
            that's odd."</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e602"> From the Springfield <i>Republican,</i> April 12, 1902.</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e607">To the Editor of the
                  Republican:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e610"><i>One of your citizens has asked me a
                  question about the "esophagus," and I wish to answer him through you. This in the
                  hope that the answer will get around, and save me some penmanship, for I have
                  already replied to the same question more than several times, and am not getting
                  as much holiday as I ought to have.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e614"><i>I
                  published a short story lately, and it was in that that I put the esophagus. I
                  will say privately that I expected it to bother some people—in fact, that
                  was the intention—but the harvest has been larger than I was calculating
                  upon. The esophagus has gathered in the guilty and the innocent alike, whereas I
                  was only fishing for the innocent—the innocent and confiding. I knew a few
                  of these would write and ask me; that would give me but little trouble; but, I was
                  not expecting that the wise and the learned would call upon me for succor.
                  However, that has happened, and it is time for me to speak up and stop the
                  inquiries if I can, for letter-writing is not restful to me, and I am not having
                  so much fun out of this thing as I counted on. That you may understand the
                  situation, I will insert a couple of sample inquiries. The first is from a public
                  instructor in the Philippines: </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e618">SANTA CRUZ, <i>Ilocos, Sur, P. I. </i><br><i>February 13,
                  1902</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e626"><i>My dear Sir,—I have just been
                  reading the first part of your latest story, entitled "A Double-barreled Detective
                  Story," and am very much delighted with it. In Part IV, page 264,</i> Harper's
                Magazine <i>for January, occurs this passage: "far in the empty sky a
                  solitary 'esophagus' slept upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness,
                  serenity, and the peace of God." Now, there is one word I do not understand,
                  namely, "esophagus." My only work of reference is the</i> Standard Dictionary,
                  <i>but that fails to explain the meaning. If you can spare the
                  time, I would be glad to have the meaning cleared up, as I consider the passage a
                  very touching and beautiful one. It may seem foolish to you, but consider my lack
                  of means away out in the northern part of Luzon.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e636"><i>Yours very truly.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e640"><i>Do you notice?
                  Nothing in the paragraph disturbed him but that one word. It shows that the
                  paragraph was most ably constructed for the deception it was intended to put upon
                  the reader. It was my intention that it should read plausibly, and it is now plain
                  that it does; it was my intention that it should be emotional and touching, and
                  you see, yourself, that it fetched this public instructor. Alas, If I had but left
                  that one treacherous word out, I should have scored! scored everywhere; and the
                  paragraph would have slidden through every reader's sensibilities like oil, and
                  left not a suspicion behind.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e644"><i>The other sample
                  inquiry is from a professor in a New England university. It contains one naughty
                  word (which I cannot bear to suppress), but he is not in the theological
                  department, so it is no harm:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e648"><i>Dear Mr.
                  Clemens: "Far in the empty sky a "solitary esophagus slept upon motionless
                  wing."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e653"><i>It is not often I get a chance to read
                  much periodical literature, but I have just gone through at this belated period,
                  with much gratification and edification, your "Double-barreled Detective
                  Story."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e657"><i>But what in hell is an esophagus? I
                  keep one myself, but it never sleeps in the air or anywhere else. My profession is
                  to deal with words, and esophagus interested me the moment I lighted upon it. But
                  as a companion of my youth used to say, "I'll be eternally, co-eternally cussed"
                  if l can make it out. Is it a joke, or I an ignoramus?</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e661"><i>Between you and me, I was almost ashamed of having fooled that man,
                  but for pride's sake I was not going to say so. I wrote and told him it was a
                  joke—and that is what I am now saying to my Springfield inquirer. And I told
                  him to carefully read the whole paragraph, and he would find not a vestige of
                  sense in any detail of it. This also I commend to my Springfield
                inquirer.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e665"><i>I have confessed. I am
                  sorry—partially. I will not do so any more—for the present. Don't ask
                  me any more questions; let the esophagus have a rest—on his same old
                  motionless wing. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e669">MARK TWAIN</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e672">New York City, <i>April 10, 1902</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e677"><i>( Editorial

                  appeared in</i> Harper's Magazine <i>for January and February
                  last, is the most elaborate of burlesques on detective fiction, with striking
                  melodramatic passages in which it is difficult to detect the deception, so ably is
                  it done. But the illusion ought not to endure even the first incident in the
                  February number. As for the paragraph which has so admirably illustrated the skill
                  of Mr. Clemens's ensemble and the carelessness of readers, here it
              is:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e688"><i>"It was a crisp and spicy morning in early
                  October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung
                  burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind nature for
                  the wingless wild things that have their home in the tree-tops and would visit
                  together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow flames in
                  brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the sensuous
                  fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere; far
                  in the empty sky a solitary esophagus slept upon motionless wings; everywhere
                  brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e692"><i>The success of Mark Twain's joke recalls to mind his story of the
                  petrified man in the cavern, whom he described most punctiliously, first giving a
                  picture of the scene, its impressive solitude, and all that; then going on to
                  describe the majesty of the figure, casually mentioning that the thumb of his
                  right hand rested against the side of his nose; then after further description
                  observing that the fingers of the right hand were extended in a radiating fashion;
                  and, recurring to the dignified attitude and position of the man, incidentally
                  remarked that the thumb of the left hand was in contact with the little finger of
                  the right—and so on. But was it so ingeniously written that Mark, relating
                  the history years later in an article which appeared in that excellent magazine of
                  the past, the</i> Galaxy, <i>declared that no one ever found out
                  the joke, and, if we remember aright, that that astonishing old mockery was
                  actually looked for in the region where he, as a Nevada newspaper editor, had
                  located it. It is certain that Mark Twain's jumping frog has a good many more
                  "pints" than any other frog.</i></p>Chapter V<p id="TwaDoubd1e702">The next day came and went. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e704">It is now almost midnight, and in five minutes the new morning will begin. The scene is
            in the tavern billiard-room. Rough men in rough clothing, slouch-hats, breeches stuffed
            into boot-tops, some with vests, none with coats, are grouped about the boiler-iron
            stove, which has ruddy cheeks and is distributing a grateful warmth; the billiard-balls
            are clacking; there is no other sound—that is, within; the wind is fitfully
            moaning without. The men look bored; also expectant. A hulking broad-shouldered miner,
            of middle age, with grizzled whiskers, and an unfriendly eye set in an unsociable face,
            rises, slips a coil of fuse upon his arm, gathers up some other personal properties, and
            departs without word or greeting to anybody. It is Flint Buckner. As the door closes
            behind him a buzz of talk breaks out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e706">"The regularest man that ever was," said Jake Parker, the blacksmith: "you can tell
            when it's twelve just by him leaving, without looking at your Waterbury." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e708">"And it's the only virtue he's got, as fur as I know," said Peter Hawes, miner. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e710">"He's just a blight on this society," said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "If I was
            running this shop I'd make him say something, <i>some</i> time or other,
            or vamos the ranch." This with a suggestive glance at the barkeeper, who did not choose
            to see it, since the man under discussion was a good customer, and went home pretty well
            set up, every night, with refreshments furnished from the bar. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e715">"Say," said Ham Sandwich, miner, "does any of you boys ever recollect of him asking you
            to take a drink?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e717"><i>"Him?</i> Flint <i>Buckner?</i> Oh, Laura!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e724">This sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous general outburst in one form of words or
            another from the crowd. After a brief silence, Pat Riley, miner, said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e726">"He's the 15-puzzle, that cuss. And his boy's another one. <i>I
            </i>can't make them out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e731">"Nor anybody else," said Ham Sandwich; "and if they are 15-puzzles how are you going to
            rank up that other one? When it comes to A 1 right-down solid mysteriousness, he lays
            over both of them. <i>Easy—</i>don't he?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e737">"You bet!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e739">Everybody said it. Every man but one. He was the new-comer-Peterson. He ordered the
            drinks all round, and asked who No. 3 might be. All answered at once, "Archy Stillman!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e741">"Is he a mystery?" asked Peterson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e743">"Is <i>he</i> a mystery? Is Archy <i>Stillman a</i>
            mystery?" said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "Why, the fourth dimension's foolishness to
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e754">For Ferguson was learned. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e756">Peterson wanted to hear all about him; everybody wanted to tell him; everybody began.
            But Billy Stevens, the barkeeper, called the house to order, and said one at a time was
            best. He distributed the drinks, and appointed Ferguson to lead. Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e758">"Well, he's a boy. And that is just about all we know about him. You can pump him till
            you are tired; it ain't any use; you won't get anything. At least about his intentions,
            or line of business, or where he's from, and such things as that. And as for getting at
            the nature and get-up of his main big chief mystery, why, he'll just change the subject,
            that's all. You can <i>guess</i> till you're black in the
            face—it's your privilege—but suppose you do, where do you arrive at?
            Nowhere, as near as I can make out," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e763">"What <i>is</i> his big chief one?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e768">"Sight, maybe. Hearing, maybe. Instinct, maybe. Magic, maybe. Take your
            choice—grownups, twenty-five; children and servants, half price. Now I'll tell you
            what he can do. You can start here, and just disappear; you can go and hide wherever you
            want to, I don't care where it is, nor how far—and he'll go straight and put his
            finger on you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e770">"You don't mean it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e772">"I just do, though. Weather's nothing to him—elemental conditions is nothing to
            him—he don't even take notice of them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e775">"Oh, come! Dark? Rain? Snow? Hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e777">"It's all the same to <i>him.</i> He don't give a damn." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e782">"Oh, <i>say—</i>including <i>fog,</i> per'aps?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e790"><i>"Fog!</i> he's got an eye 't can plunk through it like a bullet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e794">"Now, boys, honor bright, what's he giving me?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e796">"It's a fact!" they all shouted. "Go on, Wells-Fargo." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e798">"Well, sir, you can leave him here, chatting with the boys, and you can slip out and go
            to any cabin in this camp and open a book—yes, sir, a dozen of them—and take
            the page in your memory, and he'll start out and go straight to that cabin and open
            every one of them books at the right page, and call it off, and never make a mistake." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e800">"He must be the devil!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e802">"More than one has thought it. Now I'll tell you a perfectly wonderful thing that he
            done. The other night he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e804">There was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside, the door flew open, and an excited
            crowd burst in, with the camp's one white woman in the lead and crying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e806">"My child! my child! she's lost and gone! For the love of God help me to find Archy
            Stillman; we've hunted everywhere!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e809">Said the barkeeper: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e811">"Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, and don't worry. He asked for a bed three hours ago,
            tuckered out tramping the trails the way he's always doing, and went up-stairs. Ham
            Sandwich, run up and roust him out; he's in No. 14." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e813">The youth was soon down-stairs and ready. He asked Mrs. Hogan for particulars. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e815">"Bless you, dear, there ain't any; I wish there was. I put her to sleep at seven in the
            evening, and when I went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself, she was gone. I
            rushed for your cabin, dear, and you wasn't there, and I've hunted for you ever since,
            at every cabin down the gulch, and now I've come up again, and I'm that distracted and
            scared and heartbroke; but, thanks to God, I've found you at last, dear heart, and
            you'll find my child. Come on! come quick!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e817">"Move right along; I'm with you, madam. Go to your cabin first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e819">The whole company streamed out to join the hunt. All the southern half of the village
            was up, a hundred men strong, and waiting outside, a vague dark mass sprinkled with
            twinkling lanterns. The mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself
            to the narrow road, and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders. In a
            few minutes the Hogan cabin was reached. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e821">"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Hogan; "there's where she was; it's where I laid her at
            seven o'clock; but where she is now, God only knows." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e823">"Hand me a lantern," said Archy. He set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it,
            pretending to examine the ground closely. "Here's her track," he said, touching the
            ground here and there and yonder with his finger. "Do you see?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e825">Several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see. One or two
            thought they discerned something like a track; the others shook their heads and
            confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp
            enough to discover. One said, "Maybe a child's foot could make a mark on it, but <i>I</i> don't see how." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e830">Young Stillman stepped outside, held the light to the ground, turned leftward, and
            moved three steps, closely examining; then said, "I've got the direction—come
            along; take the lantern, somebody." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e832">He strode off swiftly southward, the files following, swaying and bending in and out
            with the deep curves of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the mouth of the gorge was reached;
            before them stretched the sagebrush plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman called a halt,
            saying, "We mustn't start wrong, now; we must take the direction again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e835">He took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards; then said,
            "Come on; it's all right," and gave up the lantern. In and out among the sage-bushes he
            marched, a quarter of a mile, bearing gradually to the right; then took a new direction
            and made another great semicircle; then changed again and moved due west nearly half a
            mile—and stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e837">"She gave it up, here, poor little chap. Hold the lantern. You can see where she sat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e839">But this was in a slick alkali flat which was surfaced like steel, and no person in the
            party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a
            cushion on a veneer like that. The bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the
            spot, lamenting. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e841">"But where is she, then?" some one said. "She didn't stay here. We can see <i>that</i> much, anyway." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e846">Stillman moved about in a circle around the place, with the lantern, pretending to hunt
            for tracks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e848">"Well!" he said presently, in an annoyed tone, "I don't understand it." He examined
            again. "No use. She was here—that's certain; she never <i>walked</i> away from here—and that's certain. It's a puzzle; I can't make it
            out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e853">The mother lost heart then. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e855">"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! some flying beast has got her. I'll never see her
            again!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e857">"Ah, <i>don't</i> give up," said Archy. "We'll find her—don't
            give up." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e862">"God bless you for the words, Archy Stillman!" and she seized his hand and kissed it
            fervently. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e864">Peterson, the new-comer, whispered satirically in Ferguson's ear: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e867">"Wonderful performance to find this place, wasn't it? Hardly worth while to come so
            far, though; any other supposititious place would have answered just as well—hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e869">Ferguson was not pleased with the innuendo. He said, with some warmth: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e871">"Do you mean to insinuate that the child hasn't been here? I tell you the child <i>has</i> been here! Now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a
            little fuss as—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e876">"All right!" sang out Stillman. "Come, everybody, and look at this! It was right under
            our noses all the time, and we didn't see it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e878">There was a general plunge for the ground at the place where the child was alleged to
            have rested, and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to see the thing that Archy's finger
            was resting upon. There was a pause, then a several-barreled sigh of disappointment. Pat
            Riley and Ham Sandwich said, in the one breath: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e880">"What is it, Archy? There's nothing here." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e882">"Nothing? Do you call <i>that</i> nothing?" and he swiftly traced upon
            the ground a form with his finger. "There—don't you recognize it now? It's Injun
            Billy's track. He's got the child." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e887">"God be praised !" from the mother. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e889">"Take away the lantern. I've got the direction. Follow!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e891">He started on a run, racing in and out among the sage-bushes a matter of three hundred
            yards, and disappeared over a sand-wave; the others struggled after him, caught him up,
            and found him waiting. Ten steps away was a little wickiup, a dim and formless shelter
            of rags and old horse-blankets, a dull light showing through its chinks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e893">"You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the lad. "It's your privilege to be first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e896">All followed the sprint she made for the wickiup, and saw, with her, the picture its
            interior afforded. Injun Billy was sitting on the ground; the child was asleep beside
            him. The mother hugged it with a wild embrace, which included Archy Stillman, the
            grateful tears running down her face, and in a choked and broken voice she poured out a
            golden stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments which has its home in full
            richness nowhere but in the Irish heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e898">"I find her bymeby it is ten o'clock," Billy explained. "She 'sleep out yonder, ve'y
            tired—face wet, been cryin', 'spose; fetch her home, feed her, she heap much
            hungry—go 'sleep 'gin." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e900">In her limitless gratitude the happy mother waived rank and hugged him too, calling him
            "the angel of God in disguise." And he probably was in disguise if he was that kind of
            an official. He was dressed for the character. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e902">At half past one in the morning the procession burst into the village singing, "When
            Johnny Comes Marching Home," waving its lanterns and swallowing the drinks that were
            brought out all along its course. It concentrated at the tavern, and made a night of
            what was left of the morning.</p>Chapter VI<p id="TwaDoubd1e907">The next afternoon the village was electrified with an immense sensation. A grave and
            dignified foreigner of distinguished bearing and appearance had arrived at the tavern,
            and entered this formidable name upon the register: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e909">SHERLOCK HOLMES
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e913">The news buzzed from cabin to cabin, from claim to claim; tools were dropped, and the
            town swarmed toward the center of interest. A man passing out at the northern end of the
            village shouted it to Pat Riley, whose claim was the next one to Flint Buckner's. At
            that time Fetlock Jones seemed to turn sick. He muttered to himself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e915">"Uncle <i>Sherlock!</i> The mean luck of it!—that <i>he </i>should come just when..." He dropped into a reverie, and
            presently said to himself: "But what's the use of being afraid of <i>him?
            </i>Anybody that knows him the way I do knows he can't detect a crime except where he
            plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and hires some fellow to commit it
            according to instructions.... Now there ain't going to <i>be</i> any
            clues this time—so, what show has he got? None at all. No, sir; everything's
            ready. If I was to risk putting it off—...No, I won't run any risk like that.
            Flint Buckner goes out of this world to-night, for sure." Then another trouble presented
            itself. "Uncle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening, and
            how am I going to get rid of him? for I've <i>got</i> to be at my cabin
            a minute or two about eight o'clock." This was an awkward matter, and cost him much
            thought. But he found a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll go for a walk, and I'll leave
            him in the road a minute, so that he won't see what it is I do: the best way to throw a
            detective off the track, anyway, is to have him along when you are preparing the thing.
            Yes, that's the safest—I'll take him with me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e932">Meantime the road in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping
            for a glimpse of the great man. But he kept his room, and did not appear. None but
            Ferguson, Jake Parker the blacksmith, and Ham Sandwich had any luck. These enthusiastic
            admirers of the great scientific detective hired the tavern's detained-baggage lockup,
            which looked into the detective's room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide,
            ambushed themselves in it, and cut some peep-holes in the window-blind. Mr. Holmes's
            blinds were down; but by and by he raised them. It gave the spies a hair-lifting but
            pleasurable thrill to find themselves face to face with the Extraordinary Man who had
            filled the world with the fame of his more than human ingenuities. There he
            sat—not a myth, not a shadow, but real, alive, compact of substance, and almost
            within touching distance with the hand. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e934">"Look at that head!" said Ferguson, in an awed voice. "By gracious! <i>that's</i> a head!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e939">"You bet!" said the blacksmith, with deep reverence. "Look at his nose! look at his
            eyes! Intellect? Just a battery of it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e941">"And that paleness," said Ham Sandwich. "Comes from thought—that's what it comes
            from. Hell! duffers like us don't know what real thought <i>is."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e946">"No more we don't," said Ferguson. "What we take for thinking is just
            blubber-and-slush," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e948">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo. And look at that frown—that's <i>deep</i> thinking—away down, down, forty fathom into the bowels of things.
            He's on the track of something." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e954">"Well, he is, and don't you forget it. Say—look at that awful gravity—look
            at that pallid solemness—there ain't any corpse can lay over it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e956">"No, sir, not for dollars! And it's his'n by hereditary rights, too; he's been dead
            four times a'ready, and there's history for it. Three times natural, once by accident.
            I've heard say he smells damp and cold, like a grave. And he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e958">" 'Sh! Watch him! There—he's got his thumb on the bump on the near corner of his
            forehead, and his forefinger on the off one. His think-works is just a-<i>grinding</i> now, you bet your other shirt." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e963">"That's so. And now he's gazing up toward heaven and stroking his mustache slow,
            and—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e965">"Now he has rose up standing, and is putting his clues together on his left fingers
            with his right finger. See? he touches the forefinger—now middle finger—now
            ring-finger—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e967">"Stuck!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e969">"Look at him scowl! He can't seem to make out <i>that</i> clue. So
            he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e974">"See him smile!—like a tiger—and tally off the other fingers like nothing!
            He's got it, boys; he's got it sure!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e976">"Well, I should <i>say!</i> I'd hate to be in that man's place that
            he's after." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e981">Mr. Holmes drew a table to the window, sat down with his back to the spies, and
            proceeded to write. The spies withdrew their eyes from the peep-holes, lit their pipes,
            and settled themselves for a comfortable smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with conviction: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e983">"Boys, it's no use talking, he's a wonder! He's got the signs of it all over him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e986">"You hain't ever said a truer word than that, Wells-Fargo," said Jake Parker. "Say,
            wouldn't it 'a' been nuts if he'd a-been here last night?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e988">"Oh, by George, but wouldn't it!" said Ferguson. "Then we'd have seen <i>scientific</i> work. Intellect—just pure intellect—away up on the upper
            levels, dontchuknow. Archy is all right, and it don't become anybody to belittle <i>him,</i> I can tell you. But his gift is only just eyesight, sharp as
            an owl's, as near as I can make it out just a grand natural animal talent, no more, no
            less, and prime as far as it goes, but no intellect in it, and for awfulness and
            marvelousness no more to be compared to what this man does than—than—Why,
            let me tell you what <i>he'd</i> have done. He'd have stepped over to
            Hogan's and glanced—just <i>glanced,</i> that's all—at the
            premises, and that's enough. See everything? Yes, sir, to the last little detail; and
            he'll know more about that place than the Hogans would know in seven years. Next, he
            would sit down on the bunk, just as ca'm, and say to Mrs. Hogan—<i>Say,</i> Ham, consider that you are Mrs. Hogan. I'll ask the questions; you answer
            them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1005">"All right; go on." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1007">" 'Madam, if you please—attention—do not let your mind wander. Now,
            then—sex of the child?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1009">" 'Female, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1011">" 'Um—female. Very good, very good. Age?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1013">" 'Turned six, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1015">" 'Um—young, weak—two miles. Weariness will overtake it then. It will sink
            down and sleep. We shall find it two miles away, or less. Teeth?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1017">" 'Five, your Honor, and one a-coming.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1019">" 'Very good, very good, <i>very</i> good, indeed.' You see, boys, <i>he</i> knows a clue when he sees it, when it wouldn't mean a dern thing
            to anybody else. 'Stockings, madam? Shoes?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1027">" 'Yes, your Honor—both.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1030">" 'Yarn, perhaps? Morocco?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1032">" 'Yarn, your Honor. And kip.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1034">" 'Um—kip. This complicates the matter. However, let it go—we shall manage.
            Religion?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1036">" 'Catholic, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1038">" 'Very good. Snip me a bit from the bed blanket, please. Ah, thanks. Part
            wool—foreign make. Very well. A snip from some garment of the child's, please.
            Thanks. Cotton. Shows wear. An excellent clue, excellent. Pass me a pallet of the floor
            dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, many thanks. Ah, admirable, admirable! <i>Now</i> we know where we are, I think.' You see, boys, he's got all the
            clues he wants now; he don't need anything more. Now, then, what does this Extraordinary
            Man do? He lays those snips and that dirt out on the table and leans over them on his
            elbows, and puts them together side by side and studies them—mumbles to himself,
            'Female'; changes them around—mumbles, 'Six years old'; changes them this way and
            that—again mumbles: 'Five teeth—one
            a-coming—Catholic—yarn—cotton—kip—damn that kip.' Then he
            straightens up and gazes toward heaven, and plows his hands through his hair—plows
            and plows, muttering, 'Damn that kip!' Then he stands up and frowns, and begins to tally
            off his clues on his fingers—and gets stuck at the ring-finger. But only just a
            minute—then his face glares all up in a smile like a house afire, and he
            straightens up stately and majestic, and says to the crowd, 'Take a lantern, a couple of
            you, and go down to Injun Billy's and fetch the child—the rest of you go 'long
            home to bed; good-night, madam; good-night, gents.' And he bows like the Matterhorn, and
            pulls out for the tavern. That's <i>his</i> style, and the <i>Only—</i>scientific, intellectual—all over in fifteen
            minutes—no poking around all over the sage-brush range an hour and a half in a
            mass-meeting crowd for <i>him,</i> boys—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1055">"By Jackson, it's grand!" said Ham Sandwich. "Wells-Fargo, you've got him down to a
            dot. He ain't painted up any exacter to the life in the books. By George, I can juse <i>see</i> him—can't you, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1060">"You bet you! It's just a photograft, that's what it is." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1062">Ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success, and grateful. He sat silently
            enjoying his happiness a little while, then he murmured, with a deep awe in his voice, </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1064">"I wonder if God made him?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1066">There was no response for a moment; then Ham Sandwich said, reverently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1068">"Not all at one time, I reckon."</p>Chapter VII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1073">At eight o'clock that evening two persons were groping their way past Flint Buckner's
            cabin in the frosty gloom. They were Sherlock Holmes and his nephew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1075">"Stop here in the road a moment, uncle," said Fetlock, "while I run to my cabin; I
            won't be gone a minute." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1077">He asked for something—the uncle furnished it—then he disappeared in the
            darkness, but soon returned, and the talking-walk was resumed. By nine o'clock they had
            wandered back to the tavern. They worked their way through the billiard-room, where a
            crowd had gathered in the hope of getting a glimpse of the Extraordinary Man. A royal
            cheer was raised. Mr. Holmes acknowledged the compliment with a series of courtly bows,
            and as he was passing out his nephew said to the assemblage: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1079">"Uncle Sherlock's got some work to do, gentlemen, that 'll keep him till twelve or one;
            but he'll be down again then, or earlier if he can, and hopes some of you'll be left to
            take a drink with him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1081">"By George, he's just a duke, boys! Three cheers for Sherlock Holmes, the greatest man
            that ever lived!" shouted Ferguson. "Hip, hip, hip—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1083">"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Tiger!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1085">The uproar shook the building, so hearty was the feeling the boys put into their
            welcome. Up-stairs the uncle reproached the nephew gently, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1087">"What did you get me into that engagement for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1089">"I reckon you don't want to be unpopular, do you, uncle? Well, then, don't you put on
            any exclusiveness in a mining-camp, that's all. The boys admire you; but if you was to
            leave without taking a drink with them, they'd set you down for a snob. And besides, you
            said you had home talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1091">The boy was right, and wise—the uncle acknowledged it. The boy was wise in
            another detail which he did not mention—except to himself: "Uncle and the others
            will come handy—in the way of nailing an <i>alibi </i>where it
            can't be budged." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1097">He and his uncle talked diligently about three hours. Then, about midnight, Fetlock
            stepped down-stairs and took a position in the dark a dozen steps from the tavern, and
            waited. Five minutes later Flint Buckner came rocking out of the billiard-room and
            almost brushed him as he passed. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1099">"I've <i>got</i> him!" muttered the boy. He continued to himself,
            looking after the shadowy form: "Good-by—good-by for good, Flint Buckner; you
            called my mother a—well, never mind what: it's all right, now; you're taking your
            last walk, friend." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1104">He went musing back into the tavern. "From now till one is an hour. We'll spend it with
            the boys; it's good for the <i>alibi."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1109">He brought Sherlock Holmes to the billiard-room, which was jammed with eager and
            admiring miners; the guest called the drinks, and the fun began. Everybody was happy;
            everybody was complimentary; the ice was soon broken, songs, anecdotes, and more drinks
            followed, and the pregnant minutes flew. At six minutes to one, when the jollity was at
            its highest— </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1111"><i>Boom!</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1115">There was silence instantly. The deep sound came rolling and rumbling frown peak to
            peak up the gorge, then died down, and ceased. The spell broke, then, and the men made a
            rush for the door, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1117">"Something's blown up!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1119">Outside, a voice in the darkness said, "It's away down the gorge; I saw the flash." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1121">The crowd poured down the cañon—Holmes, Fetlock, Archy Stillman,
            everybody. They made the mile in a few minutes. By the light of a lantern they found the
            smooth and solid dirt floor of Flint Buckner's cabin; of the cabin itself not a vestige
            remained, not a rag nor a splinter. Nor any sign of Flint. Search-parties sought here
            and there and yonder, and presently a cry went up. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1123">"Here he is!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1125">It was true. Fifty yards down the gulch they had found him—that is, they had
            found a crushed and lifeless mass which represented him. Fetlock Jones hurried thither
            with the others and looked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1128">The inquest was a fifteen-minute affair. Ham Sandwich, foreman of the jury, handed up
            the verdict, which was phrased with a certain unstudied literary grace, and closed with
            this finding, to wit: that "deceased came to his death by his own act or some other
            person or persons unknown to this jury not leaving any family or similar effects behind
            but his cabin which was blown away and God have mercy on his soul amen." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1130">Then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd, for the storm-center of interest was
            there—Sherlock Holmes. The miners stood silent and reverent in a half-circle,
            inclosing a large vacant space which included the front exposure of the site of the late
            premises. In this considerable space the Extraordinary Man was moving about, attended by
            his nephew with a lantern. With a tape he took measurements of the cabin site; of the
            distance from the wall of chaparral to the road; of the height of the chaparral bushes;
            also various other measurements. He gathered a rag here, a splinter there, and a pinch
            of earth yonder, inspected them profoundly, and preserved them. He took the "lay" of the
            place with a pocket-compass, allowing two seconds for magnetic variation. He took the
            time (Pacific) by his watch, correcting it for local time. He paced off the distance
            from the cabin site to the corpse, and corrected that for tidal differentiation. He took
            the altitude with a pocket-aneroid, and the temperature with a pocket-thermometer.
            Finally he said, with a stately bow: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1132">"It is finished. Shall we return, gentlemen?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1134">He took up the line of march for the tavern, and the crowd fell into his wake,
            earnestly discussing and admiring the Extraordinary Man, and interlarding guesses as to
            the origin of the tragedy and who the author of it might he. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1136">"My, but it's grand luck having him here—hey, boys?" said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1138">"It's the biggest thing of the century," said Ham Sandwich. "It 'll go all over the
            world; you mark my words." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1140"><i>"You</i> bet!" said Jake Parker, the blacksmith. "It 'll boom this
            camp. Ain't it so, Wells-Fargo?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1144">"Well, as you want my opinion—if it's any sign of how <i>I
            </i>think about it, I can tell you this: yesterday I was holding the Straight Flush
            claim at two dollars a foot; I'd like to see the man that can get it at sixteen to-day." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1149">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo! It's the grandest luck a new camp ever struck. Say, did
            you see him collar them little rags and dirt and things? What an eye! He just can't
            overlook a clue—'tain't <i>in </i>him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1154">"That's so. And they wouldn't mean a thing to anybody else; but to him, why, they're
            just a book—large print at that." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1156">"Sure's you're born! Them odds and ends have got their little old secret, and they
            think there ain't anybody can pull it; but, land! when he sets his grip there they've
            got to squeal, and don't you forget it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1159">"Boys, I ain't sorry, now, that he wasn't here to roust out the child; this is a bigger
            thing, by a long sight. Yes, sir, and more tangled up and scientific and intellectual." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1161">"I reckon we're all of us glad it's turned out this way. Glad? 'George! it ain't any
            name for it. Dontchuknow, Archy could 've <i>learnt</i> something if
            he'd had the nous to stand by and take notice of how that man works the system. But no;
            he went poking up into the chaparral and just missed the whole thing." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1166">"It's true as gospel; I seen it myself. Well, Archy's young. He'll know better one of
            these days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1168">"Say, boys, who do you reckon done it?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1170">That was a difficult question, and brought out a world of unsatisfying conjecture.
            Various men were mentioned as possibilities, but one by one they were discarded as not
            being eligible. No one but young Hillyer had been intimate with Flint Buckner; no one
            had really had a quarrel with him; he had affronted every man who had tried to make up
            to him, although not quite offensively enough to require bloodshed. There was one name
            that was upon every tongue from the start, but it <i>was</i> the last to
            get utterance—Fetlock Jones's. It was Pat Riley that mentioned it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1175">"Oh, well," the boys said, "of course we've all thought of him, because he had a
            million rights to kill Flint Buckner, and it was just his plain duty to do it. But all
            the same there's two things we can't get around: for one thing, he hasn't got the sand;
            and for another, he wasn't anywhere near the place when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1177">"I know it," said Pat. "He was there in the billiard-room with us when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1179">"Yes, and was there all the time for an hour <i>before</i> it
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1184">"It's so. And lucky for him, too. He'd have been suspected in a minute if it hadn't
            been for that."</p>Chapter VIII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1189">The tavern dining-room had been cleared of all its furniture save one six-foot pine
            table and a chair. This table was against one end of the room; the chair was on it;
            Sherlock Holmes, stately, imposing, impressive, sat in the chair. The public stood. The
            room was full. The tobacco-smoke was dense, the stillness profound. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1191">The Extraordinary Man raised his hand to command additional silence; held it in the air
            a few moments; then, in brief, crisp terms he put forward question after question, and
            noted the answers with "Um-ums," nods of the head, and so on. By this process he learned
            all about Flint Buckner, his character, conduct, and habits, that the people were able
            to tell him. It thus transpired that the Extraordinary Man's nephew was the only person
            in the camp who had a killing-grudge against Flint Buckner. Mr. Holmes smiled
            compassionately upon the witness, and asked, languidly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1193">"Do any of you gentlemen chance to know where the lad Fetlock Jones was at the time of
            the explosion?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1195">A thunderous response followed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1197">"In the billiard-room of this house!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1199">"Ah. And had he just come in?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1201">"Been there all of an hour!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1203">"Ah. It is about—about—well, about how far might it be to the scene of the
            explosions" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1205">"All of a mile!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1207">"Ah. It isn't <i>much</i> of an alibi, 'tis true, but—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1213">A storm-burst of laughter, mingled with shouts of "By jiminy, but he's
            chain-lightning!" and "Ain't you sorry you spoke, Sandy?" shut off the rest of the
            sentence, and the crushed witness drooped his blushing face in pathetic shame. The
            inquisitor resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1215">"The lad Jones's somewhat <i>distant</i> connection with the case"
              (laughter<i>) "</i>having been disposed of, let us now call the
            eye-witnesses of the tragedy, and listen to what they have to say." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1223">He got out his fragmentary clues and arranged them on a sheet of cardboard on his knee.
            The house held its breath and watched. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1225">"We have the longitude and the latitude, corrected for magnetic variation, and this
            gives us the exact location of the tragedy. We have the altitude, the temperature, and
            the degree of humidity prevailing—inestimably valuable, since they enable us to
            estimate with precision the degree of influence which they would exercise upon the mood
            and disposition of the assassin at that time of the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1227"><i>(Buzz of admiration; muttered remark, "By George, but he's
              deep.")</i> He fingered his clues. "And now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak
            to us. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1231">"Here we have an empty linen shot-bag. What is its message? This: that robbery was the
            motive, not revenge. What is its further message? This: that the assassin was of
            inferior intelligence—shall we say light-witted, or perhaps approaching that? How
            do we know this? Because a person of sound intelligence would not have proposed to rob
            the man Buckner, who never had much money with him. But the assassin might have been a
            stranger? Let the bag speak again. I take from it this article. It is a bit of
            silver-bearing quartz. It is peculiar. Examine it, please—you—and
            you—and you. Now pass it back, please. There is but one lode on this coast which
            produces just that character and color of quartz; and that is a lode which crops out for
            nearly two miles on a stretch, and in my opinion is destined, at no distant day, to
            confer upon its locality a globe-girdling celebrity, and upon its two hundred owners
            riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Name that lode, please." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1233">"The Consolidated Christian Science and Mary Ann!" was the prompt response. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1235">A wild crash of hurrahs followed, and every man reached for his neighbor's hand and
            wrung it, with tears in his eyes; and Wells-Fargo Ferguson shouted, "The Straight Flush
            is on the lode, and up she goes to a hunched and fifty a foot—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1240">When quiet fell, Mr. Holmes resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1242">"We perceive, then, that three facts are established, to wit: the assassin was
            approximately light-witted; he was not a stranger; his motive was robbery, not revenge.
            Let us proceed. I hold in my hand a small fragment of fuse, with the recent smell of
            fire upon it. What is its testimony? Taken with the corroborative evidence of the
            quartz, it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner. What does it tell us further?
            This, gentlemen: that the assassination was consummated by means of an explosive. What
            else does it say? This: that the explosive was located against the side of the cabin
            nearest the road—the front side—for within six feet of that spot I found it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1244">"I hold in my fingers a burnt Swedish match—the kind one rubs on a safety-box. I
            found it in the road, six hundred and twenty-two feet from the abolished cabin. What
            does it say? This: that the train was fired from that point. What further does it tell
            us? This: that the assassin was left-handed. How do I know this? I should not be able to
            explain to you, gentlemen, how I know it, the signs being so subtle that only long
            experience and deep study can enable one to detect them. But the signs are here, and
            they are reinforced by a fact which you must have often noticed in the great detective
            narratives—that <i>all </i>assassins are left-handed." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1250">"By Jackson, <i>that's</i> so." said Ham Sandwich, bringing his great
            hand down with a resounding slap upon his thigh; "blamed if I ever thought of it
            before." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1255">"Nor I!" "Nor I!" cried several. "Oh, there can't anything escape <i>him—</i>look at his eye!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1260">"Gentlemen, distant as the murderer was from his doomed victim, he did not wholly
            escape injury. This fragment of wood which I now exhibit to you struck him. It drew
            blood. Wherever he is, he bears the telltale mark. I picked it up where he stood when he
            fired the fatal train," He looked out over the house from his high perch, and his
            countenance began to darken; he slowly raised his hand, and pointed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1262">"There stands the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1264">For a moment the house was paralyzed with amazement; then twenty voices burst out with: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1266">"Sammy Hillyer? Oh, <i>hell,</i> no! <i>Him?</i> It's
            pure foolishness!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1274">"Take care, gentlemen—be not hasty. Observe—he has the blood-mark on his
            brow." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1276">Hillyer turned white with fright. He was near to crying. He turned this way and that,
            appealing to every face for help and sympathy; and held out his supplicating hands
            toward Holmes and began to plead: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1278"><i>"Don't,</i> oh, don't! I never did it; I give my word I never did
            it. The way I got this hurt on my forehead was—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1282">"Arrest him, constable!" cried Holmes. "I will swear out the warrant" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1284">The constable moved reluctantly forward—hesitated—stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1287">Hillyer broke out with another appeal. "Oh, Archy, don't let them do it; it would kill
            mother! <i>You</i> know how I got the hurt. Tell them, and save me,
            Archy; save me!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1292">Stillman worked his way to the front, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1294">"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be afraid." Then he said to the house, "Never mind how he
            got the hurt; it hasn't anything to do with this case, and isn't of any consequence." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1296">"God bless you, Archy, for a true friend!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1298">"Hurrah for Archy! Go in, boy, and play 'em a knock-down flush to their two pair 'n' a
            jack!" shouted the house, pride in their home talent and a patriotic sentiment of
            loyalty to it rising suddenly in the public heart and changing the whole attitude of the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1300">Young Stillman waited for the noise to cease; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1302">"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand by that door yonder, and Constable Harris to stand by
            the other one here, and not let anybody leave the room. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1304">"Said and done. Go on, old man!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1306">"The criminal is present, I believe. I will show him to you before long, in case I am
            right in my guess. Now I will tell you all about the tragedy, from start to finish. The
            motive <i>wasn't </i>robbery; it was revenge. The murderer <i>wasn't</i> light-witted. He <i>didn't</i> stand six
            hundred and twenty-two feet away. He <i>didn't </i>get hit with a piece
            of wood. He <i>didn't</i> place the explosive against the cabin. He <i>didn't</i> bring a shot-bag with him, and he <i>wasn't</i> left-handed. With the exception of these errors, the distinguished
            guest's statement of the case is substantially correct." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1330">A comfortable laugh rippled over the house; friend nodded to friend, as much as to say,
            "That's the word, with the bark <i>on</i> it. Good lad, good boy. <i>He</i> ain't lowering his flag any!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1338">The guest's serenity was not disturbed. Stillman resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1341">"I also have some witnesses; and I will presently tell you where you can find some
            more." He held up a piece of coarse wire; the crowd craned their necks to see. "It has a
            smooth coating of melted tallow on it. And here is a candle which is burned half-way
            down. The remaining half of it has marks cut upon it an inch apart. Soon I will tell you
            where I found these things. I will now put aside reasonings, guesses, the impressive
            hitchings of odds and ends of clues together, and the other showy theatricals of the
            detective trade, and tell you in a plain, straightforward way just how this dismal thing
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1343">He paused a moment, for effect—to allow silence and suspense to intensify and
            concentrate the house's interest; then he went on: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1345">"The assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains. It was a good plan, very
            ingenious, and showed an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. It was a plan which was
            well calculated to ward off all suspicion from its inventor. In the <i>first</i> place, he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart, and lit it and timed
            it. He found it took three hours to burn four inches of it. I tried it myself for half
            an hour, awhile ago, up-stairs here, while the inquiry into Flint Buckner's character
            and ways was being conducted in this room, and I arrived in that way at the rate of a
            candle's consumption when sheltered from the wind. Having proved his trial candle's
            rate, he blew it out—I have already shown it to you—and put <i>his</i> inch-marks on a fresh one. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1353">"He put the fresh one into a tin candlestick. Then at the five-hour mark he bored a
            hole through the candle with a red-hot wire. I have already shown you the wire, with a
            smooth coat of tallow on it—tallow that had been melted and had cooled. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1355">"With labor—very hard labor, I should say—he struggled up through the stiff
            chaparral that clothes the steep hillside back of Flint Buckner's place, tugging an
            empty flour-barrel with him. He placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place, and in
            the bottom of it he set the candlestick. Then he measured off about thirty-five feet of
            fuse—the barrel's distance from the back of the cabin. He bored a hole in the side
            of the barrel—here is the large gimlet he did it with. He went on and finished his
            work; and when it was done, one end of the fuse was in Buckner's cabin, and the other
            end, with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder, was in the hole in the
            candle—timed to blow the place up at one o'clock this morning, provided the candle
            was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening—which I am betting it was—and
            provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the
            fuse—which I am also betting there was, though I can't prove it. Boys, the barrel
            is there in the chaparral, the candle's remains are in it in the tin stick; the
            burnt-out fuse is in the gimlet-hole, the other end is down the hill where the late
            cabin stood. I saw them all an hour or two ago, when the Professor here was measuring
            off unimplicated vacancies and collecting relics that hadn't anything to do with the
            case." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1357">He paused. The house drew a long, deep breath, shook its strained cords and muscles
            free and burst into cheers. "Dang him!" said Ham Sandwich, "that's why he was snooping
            around in the chaparral, instead of picking up points out of the P'fessor's game. Looky
            here—he ain't no fool, boys." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1359">"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1361">But Stillman was resuming: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1363">"While we were out yonder an hour or two ago, the owner of the gimlet and the trial
            candle took them from a place where he had concealed them—it was not a good
            place—and carried them to what he probably thought was a better one, two hundred
            yards up in the pine woods, and hid them there, covering them over with pine needles. It
            was there that I found them. The gimlet exactly fits the hole in the barrel. And
            now—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1365">The Extraordinary Man interrupted him. He said, sarcastically: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1367">"We have had a very pretty fairy tale, gentlemen—very pretty indeed. Now I would
            like to ask this young man a question or two." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1370">Some of the boys winced, and Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1372">"I'm afraid Archy's going to catch it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1374">The others lost their smiles and sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1376">"Let us proceed to examine into this fairy tale in a consecutive and orderly
            way—by geometrical progression, so to speak—linking detail to detail in a
            steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent and unassailable march upon this tinsel
            toy fortress of error, the dream fabric of a callow imagination. To begin with, young
            sir, I desire to ask you but three questions at present—<i>at
              present.</i> Did I understand you to say it was your opinion that the supposititious
            candle was lighted at about eight o'clock yesterday evening?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1381">"Yes, sir—about eight." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1383">"Could you say exactly eight?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1385">"Well, no, I couldn't be that exact." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1387">"Um. If a person had been passing along there just about that time, he would have been
            almost sure to encounter that assassin, do you think?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1389">"Yes, I should think so." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1391">"Thank you, that is all. For the present. I say, all <i>for the
              present."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1396">"Dern him. he's laying for Archy," said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1399">"It's so," said Ham Sandwich. "I don't like the look of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1401">Stillman said, glancing at the guest, "I was along there myself at half-past
            eight—no, about nine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1403">"In-deed? This is interesting—this is very interesting. Perhaps you encountered
            the assassin?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1405">"No, I encountered no one." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1407">"Ah. Then—if you will excuse the remark—I do not quite see the relevancy of
            the information." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1409">"It has none. At present. I say it has none—at present." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1411">He paused. Presently he resumed: "I did not encounter the assassin, but I am on his
            track, I am sure, for I believe he is in this room. I will ask you all to pass one by
            one in front of me—here, where there is a good light—so that I can see your
            feet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1413">A buzz of excitement swept the place, and the march began, the guest looking on with an
            iron attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified success. Stillman stooped, shaded
            his eyes with his hand, and gazed down intently at each pair of feet as it passed. Fifty
            men tramped monotonously by—with no result. Sixty. Seventy. The thing was
            beginning to look absurd. The guest remarked, with suave irony:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1415">"Stillman Accuses Sherlock Holmes"Image of Stillman pointing a finger at Sherlock Holmes</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1421">"Assassins appear to be scarce this evening." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1423">The house saw the humor if it, and refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. Ten or twelve
            more candidates tramped by—no, <i>danced </i>by, with airy and
            ridiculous capers which convulsed the spectators—then suddenly Stillman put out
            his hand and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1429">"This is the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1431">"Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhedrim!" roared the crowd; and at once let fly a
            pyrotechnic explosion and dazzle and confusion of stirring remarks inspired by the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1433">At the height of the turmoil the guest stretched out his hand, commanding peace. The
            authority of a great name and a great personality laid its mysterious compulsion upon
            the house, and it obeyed. Out of the panting calm which succeeded, the guest spoke,
            saying, with dignity and feeling: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1435"><i>"This</i> is serious. It strikes at an innocent life. Innocent
            beyond suspicion! Innocent beyond peradventure! Hear me <i>prove</i> it;
            observe how simple a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie. Listen. My
            friends, that lad was never out of my sight yesterday evening at <i>any</i> time!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1445">It made a deep impression. Men turned their eyes upon Stillman with grave inquiry in
            them. His face brightened, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1447">"I <i>knew</i> there was another one!" He stepped briskly to the table
            and glanced at the guest's feet, then up at his face, and said: "You were <i>with</i> him! You were not fifty steps from him when he lit the candle
            that by and by fired the powder!" <i>(Sensation.) "</i>And what is more,
            you furnished the matches yourself !" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1458">Plainly the guest seemed hit; it looked so to the public. He opened his mouth to speak;
            the words did not come freely. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1460">"This—er—this is insanity—this—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1462">Stillman pressed his evident advantage home. He held up a charred match. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1464">"Here <i>is</i> one of them. I found it in the barrel—and there's
              <i>another</i> one there." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1472">The guest found his voice at once. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1475"><i>"Yes—</i>and put them there yourself!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1479">It was recognized a good shot. Stillman retorted. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1481">"It is <i>wax—</i>a breed unknown to this camp. I am ready to be
            searched for the box. Are you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1486">The guest was staggered this time—the dullest eye could see it. He fumbled with
            his hands; once or twice his lips moved, but the words did not come. The house waited
            and watched, in tense suspense, the stillness adding effect to the situation. Presently
            Stillman said, gently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1488">"We are waiting for your decision." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1490">There was silence again during several moments; then the guest answered, in a low
            voice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1492">"I refuse to be searched." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1494">There was no noisy demonstration, but all about the house one voice after another
            muttered: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1496">"That settles it! He's Archy's meat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1498">What to do now? Nobody seemed to know. It was an embarrassing situation for the
            moment—merely, of course, because matters had taken such a sudden and unexpected
            turn that these unpractised minds were not prepared for it, and had come to a
            standstill, like a stopped clock, under the shock. But after a little the machinery
            began to work again, tentatively, and by twos and threes the men put their heads
            together and privately buzzed over this and that and the other proposition. One of these
            propositions met with much favor; it was, to confer upon the assassin a vote of thanks
            for removing Flint Buckner, and let him go. But the cooler heads opposed it, pointing
            out that addled brains in the Eastern states would pronounce it a scandal, and make no
            end of foolish noise about it. Finally the cool heads got the upper hand, and obtained
            general consent to a proposition of their own; their leader then called the house to
            order and stated it—to this effect: that Fetlock Jones be jailed and put upon
            trial. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1500">The motion was carried. Apparently there was nothing further to do now, and the people
            were glad, for, privately, they were impatient to get out and rush to the scene of the
            tragedy, and see whether that barrel and the other things were really there or not. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1503">But no—the break-up got a check. The surprises were not over yet. For a while
            Fetlock Jones had been silently sobbing, unnoticed in the absorbing excitements which
            had been following one another so persistently for some time; but when his arrest and
            trial were decreed, he broke out despairingly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1505">"No! it's no use. I don't want any jail, I don't want any trial; I've had all the hard
            luck I want, and all the miseries. Hang me now, and let me out! It would all come out,
            anyway—there couldn't anything save me. He has told it all, just as if he'd been
            with me and seen it—<i>I</i> don't know how he found out; and
            you'll find the barrel and things, and then I wouldn't have any chance any more. I
            killed him; and <i>you'd</i> have done it too, if he'd treated you like
            a dog, and you only a boy, and weak and poor, and not a friend to help you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1513">"And served him damned well right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. "Looky here, boys—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1515">From the constable: "Order! Order, gentlemen!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1517">A voice: "Did your uncle know what you was up to?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1519">"No, he didn't." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1521">"Did he give you the matches, sure enough?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1523">"Yes, he did; but he didn't know what I wanted them for." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1525">"When you was out on such a business as that, how did you venture to risk having him
            along—and him a <i>detective?</i> How's that?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1530">The boy hesitated, fumbled with his buttons in an embarrassed way, then said, shyly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1532">"I know about detectives, on account of having them in the family; and if you don't
            want them to find out about a thing, it's best to have them around when you do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1535">The cyclone of laughter which greeted this native discharge of wisdom did not modify
            the poor little waif's embarrassment in any large degree.</p>Chapter IX<p id="TwaDoubd1e1540">From a letter to Mrs. Stillman, dated merely "Tuesday." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1542">Fetlock Jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log cabin, and left there
              to await his trial. Constable Harris provided him with a couple of days' rations,
              instructed him to keep a good guard over himself, and promised to look in on him as
              soon as further supplies should be due. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1545">Next morning a score of us went with Hillyer, out of friendship, and helped him bury
              his late relative, the unlamented Buckner, and I acted as first assistant pall-bearer,
              Hillyer acting as chief. Just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy
              stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, limped by with his head down, and I caught the
              scent I had chased around the globe! It was the odor of Paradise to my perishing hope!
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1548">In a moment I was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder. He
              slumped to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had withered him in his tracks; and
              as the boys came running he struggled to his knees and put up his pleading hands to
              me, and out of his chattering jaws he begged me to persecute him no more, and said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1551">"You have hunted me around the world, Sherlock Holmes, yet God is my witness I have
              never done any man harm!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1554">A glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane. That was my work, mother!
              The tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery I felt in that moment, but
              nothing else can ever do it. The boys lifted him up, and gathered about him, and were
              full of pity of him, and said the gentlest and touchingest things to him, and said
              cheer up and don't be troubled, he was among friends now, and they would take care of
              him, and protect him, and hang any man that laid a hand on him. They are just like so
              many mothers, the rough mining-camp boys are, when you wake up the south side of their
              hearts; yes, and just like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up
              the opposite of that muscle. They did everything they could think of to comfort him,
              but nothing succeeded until Wells-Fargo Ferguson, who is a clever strategist, said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1557">"If it's only Sherlock Holmes that's troubling you, you needn't worry any more."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1560">"Why?" asked the forlorn lunatic, eagerly. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1563">"Because he's dead again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1566">"Dead! Dead! Oh, don't trifle with a poor wreck like me. <i>Is
              </i>he dead? On honor, now—is he telling me true, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1573">"True as you're standing there!" said Ham Sandwich, and they all backed up the
              statement in a body. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1576">"They hung him in San Bernardino last week," added Ferguson, clinching the matter,
              "whilst he was searching around after you. Mistook him for another man. They're sorry,
              but they can't help it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1579">"They're a-building him a monument," said Ham Sandwich, with the air of a person who
              had contributed to it, and knew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1582">"James Walker" drew a deep sigh—evidently a sigh of relief—and said
              nothing; but his eyes lost something of their wildness, his countenance cleared
              visibly, and its drawn look relaxed a little. We all went to our cabin, and the boys
              cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for, and while they
              were about it Hillyer and I outfitted him from hat to shoe-leather with new clothes of
              ours, and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him. "Old" is the right word,
              and a pity, too: old by the droop of him, and the frost upon his hair, and the marks
              which sorrow and distress have left upon his face; though he is only in his prime in
              the matter of years. While he ate, we smoked and chatted; and when he was finishing he
              found his voice at last, and of his own accord broke out with his personal history. I
              cannot furnish his exact words, but I will come as near it as I can. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1585">THE "WRONG MAN'S" STORY </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1588">It happened like this: I was in Denver. I had been there many years; sometimes I
              remember how many, sometimes I don't—but it isn't any matter. All of a sudden I
              got a notice to leave, or I would be exposed for a horrible crime committed long
              before—years and years before—in the East. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1591">I knew about that crime, but I was not the criminal; it was a cousin of mine of the
              same name. What should I better do? My head was all disordered by fear, and I didn't
              know. I was allowed very little time—only one day, I think it was. I would be
              ruined if I was published, and the people would lynch me, and not believe what I said.
              It is always the way with lynchings: when they find out it is a mistake they are
              sorry, but it is too late—the same as it was with Mr. Holmes, you see. So I said
              I would sell out and get money to live on, and run away until it blew over and I could
              come back with my proofs. Then I escaped in the night and went a long way off in the
              mountains somewhere, and lived disguised and had a false name. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1594">I got more and more troubled and worried, and my troubles made me see spirits and
              hear voices, and I could not think straight and clear on any subject, but got confused
              and involved and had to give it up, because my head hurt so. It got to be worse and
              worse; more spirits and more voices. They were about me all the time; at first only in
              the night, then in the day too. They were always whispering around my bed and plotting
              against me, and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out, because I got no good rest.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1597">And then came the worst. One night the whispers said, "We'll never manage, because
              we can't <i>see</i> him, and so can't point him out to the people."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1603">They sighed; then one said: "We must bring Sherlock Holmes. He can be here in twelve
              days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1606">They all agreed, and whispered and jibbered with joy. But my heart broke; for I had
              read about that man, and knew what it would be to have him upon my track, with his
              superhuman penetration and tireless energies. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1610">The spirits went away to fetch him, and I got up at once in the middle of the night
              and fled away, carrying nothing but the hand-bag that had my money in it—thirty
              thousand dollars; two-thirds of it are in the bag there yet. It was forty days before
              that man caught up on my track. I just escaped. From habit he had written his real
              name on a tavern register, but had scratched it out and written "Dagget Barclay" in
              the place of it. But fear gives you a watchful eye and keen, and I read the true name
              through the scratches, and fled like a deer. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1613">He has hunted me all over this world for three years and a half—the Pacific
              states, Australasia, India—everywhere you can think of; then back to Mexico and
              up to California again, giving me hardly any rest; but that name on the registers
              always saved me, and what is left of me is alive yet. And I am <i>so</i> tired! A cruel time he has given me, yet I give you my honor I have never
              harmed him nor any man. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1619">That was the end of the story, and it stirred those boys to bloodheat, he sure of
              it. As for me—each word burnt a hole in me where it struck. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1622">We voted that the old man should bunk with us, and be my guest and Hillyer's. I
              shall keep my own counsel, naturally; but as soon as he is well rested and nourished,
              I shall take him to Denver and rehabilitate his fortunes. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1625">The boys gave the old fellow the bone-smashing good-fellowship handshake of the
              mines, and then scattered away to spread the news. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1628">At dawn next morning Wells-Fargo Ferguson and Ham Sandwich called us softly out, and
              said, privately: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1631">"That news about the way that old stranger has been treated has spread all around,
              and the camps are up. They are piling in from everywhere, and are going to lynch the
              P'fessor. Constable Harris is in a dead funk, and has telephoned the sheriff. Come
              along!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1634">We started on a run. The others were privileged to feel as they chose, but in my
              heart's privacy I hoped the sheriff would arrive in time; for I had small desire that
              Sherlock Holmes should hang for my deeds, as you can easily believe. I had heard a
              good deal about the sheriff, but </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1637">for reassurance's sake I asked: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1640">"Can he stop a mob?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1643">"Can <i>he</i> stop a mob! Can Jack <i>Fairfax</i>
              stop a mob! Well, I should smile! Ex-desperado—nineteen scalps on his string.
              Can <i>he!</i> Oh, I <i>say!"</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1659">As we tore up the gulch, distant cries and shouts and yells rose faintly on the
              still air, and grew steadily in strength as we raced along. Roar after roar burst out,
              stronger and stronger, nearer and nearer; and at last, when we closed up upon the
              multitude massed in the open area in front of the tavern, the crash of sound was
              deafening. Some brutal roughs from Daly's gorge had Holmes in their grip, and he was
              the calmest man there; a contemptuous smile played about his lips, and if any fear of
              death was in his British heart, his iron personality was master of it and no sign of
              it was allowed to appear. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1662">"Come to a vote, men!" This from one of the Daly gang, Shadbelly Higgins. "Quick! is
              it hang, or shoot?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1665">"Neither!" shouted one of his comrades. "He'll he alive again in a week; burning's
              the only permanency for <i>him."</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1671">The gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a thundercrash of approval, and
              went struggling and surging toward the prisoner, and closed around him, shouting,
              "Fire! fire's the ticket!" They dragged him to the horse-post, backed him against it,
              chained him to it, and piled wood and pine cones around him waist-deep. Still the
              strong face did not blench, and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1674">"A match! fetch a match!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1677">Shadbelly struck it, shaded it with his hand, stooped, and held it under a pine
              cone. A deep silence fell upon the mob. The cone caught, a tiny flame flickered about
              it a moment or two. I seemed to catch the sound of distant hoofs—it grew more
              distinct—still more and more distinct, more and more definite, but the absorbed
              crowd did not appear to notice it. The match went out. The man struck another,
              stooped, and again the flame rose; this time it took hold and began to
              spread—here and there men turned away their faces. The executioner stood with
              the charred match in his fingers, watching his work. The hoof-beats turned a
              projecting crag, and now they came thundering down upon us. Almost the next moment
              there was a shout: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1680">"The sheriff!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1683">And straightway he came tearing into the midst, stood his horse almost on his hind
              feet, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1686">"Fall back, you gutter-snipes!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1689">He was obeyed. By all but their leader. He stood his ground, and his hand went to
              his revolver. The sheriff covered him promptly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1692">"Drop your hand, you parlor desperado. Kick the fire away. Now unchain the
              stranger." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1696">The parlor desperado obeyed. Then the sheriff made a speech; sitting his horse at
              martial ease, and not warming his words with any touch of fire, but delivering them in
              a measured and deliberate way, and in a tone which harmonized with their character and
              made them impressively disrespectful. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1699">"You're a nice lot—now ain't you? Just about eligible to travel with this bilk
              here—Shadbelly Higgins—this loud-mouthed sneak that shoots people in the
              back and calls himself a desperado. If there's anything I do particularly despise,
              it's a lynching mob; I've never seen one that had a man in it. It has to tally up a
              hundred against one before it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor. It's
              made up of cowards, and so is the community that breeds it; and ninety-nine times out
              of a hundred the sheriff's another one." He paused—apparently to turn that last
              idea over in his mind and taste the juice of it—then he went on: "The sheriff
              that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the lowest-down coward there is. By
              the statistics there was a hundred and eighty-two of them drawing sneak pay in America
              last year. By the way it's going, pretty soon there 'll be a new disease in the
                doctor-books—<i>sheriff complaint."</i> That idea pleased
              him—any one could see it. "People will say, 'Sheriff sick again?' 'Yes; got the
              same old thing.' And next there 'll be a new title. People won't say, 'He's running
              for sheriff of Rapaho County,' for instance; they'll say, 'He's running for Coward of
              Rapaho.' Lord, the idea of a grown-up person being afraid of a lynch mob!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1705">He turned an eye on the captive, and said, "Stranger, who are you, and what have you
              been doing?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1708">"My name is Sherlock Holmes, and I have not been doing anything." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1711">It was wonderful, the impression which the sound of that name made on the sheriff,
              notwithstanding he must have come posted. He spoke up with feeling, and said it was a
              blot on the county that a man whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their
              fame and their ingenuity, and whose histories of them had won every reader's heart by
              the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting, should be visited under the Stars
              and Stripes by an outrage like this. He apologized in the name of the whole nation,
              and made Holmes a most handsome bow, and told Constable Harris to see him to his
              quarters, and hold himself personally responsible if he was molested again. Then he
              turned to the mob and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1714">"Hunt your holes, you scum!" which they did; then he said: "Follow me, Shadbelly;
              I'll take care of your case myself. No—keep your popgun; whenever I see the day
              that I'll be afraid to have you behind me with that thing, it 'll be time for me to
              join last year's hundred and eighty-two"; and he rode off in a walk, Shadbelly
              following. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1717">When we were on our way back to our cabin, toward breakfast-time, we ran upon the
              news that Fetlock Jones had escaped from his lock-up in the night and is gone! Nobody
              is sorry. Let his uncle track him out if he likes; it is in his line; the camp is not
              interested.</p>Chapter X<p id="TwaDoubd1e1723"><i>Ten days later.</i>

            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1736">As we were starting, this morning, Hillyer whispered to me: "Keep this news from

There has been a
            wedding, between a handsome young man of slender means and a rich young girl—a
            case of love at first sight and a precipitate marriage; a marriage bitterly opposed by
            the girl's widowed father. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e140">Jacob Fuller, the bridegroom, is twenty-six years old, is of an old but unconsidered
            family which had by compulsion emigrated from Sedgemoor, and for King James's purse's
            profit, so everybody said—some maliciously the rest merely because they believed
            it. The bride is nineteen and beautiful. She is intense, high-strung, romantic,
            immeasurably proud of her Cavalier blood, and passionate in her love for her young
            husband. For its sake she braved her father's displeasure, endured his reproaches,
            listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions and went from his house
            without his blessing, proud and happy in the proofs she was thus giving of the quality
            of the affection which had made its home in her heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e142">The morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her. Her husband put aside
            her proffered caresses, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e144">"Sit down. I have something to say to you. I loved you. That was before I asked your
            father to give you to me. His refusal is not my grievance—I could have endured
            that. But the things he said of me to you—that is a different matter.
            There—you needn't speak; I know quite well what they were; I got them from
            authentic sources. Among other things he said that my character was written in my face;
            that I was treacherous, a dissembler, a coward, and a brute without sense of pity or
            compassion: the 'Sedgemoor trade-mark,' he called it—and 'white-sleeve badge.' Any
            other man in my place would have gone to his house and shot him down like a dog. I
            wanted to do it, and was minded to do it, but a better thought came to me: to put him to
            shame; to break his heart; to kill him by inches. How to do it? Through my treatment of
            you, his idol! I would marry you; and then—Have patience. You will see. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e146">From that moment onward, for three months, the young wife suffered all the
            humiliations, all the insults, all the miseries that the diligent and inventive mind of
            the husband could contrive, save physical injuries only. Her strong pride stood by her,
            and she kept the secret of her troubles. Now and then the husband said, "Why don't you
            go to your father and tell him?" Then he invented new tortures, applied them, and asked
            again. She always answered, "He shall never know by my mouth," and taunted him with his
            origin; said she was the lawful slave of a scion of slaves, and must obey, and
            would—up to that point, but no further; he could kill her if he liked, but he
            could not break her; it was not in the Sedgemoor breed to do it. At the end of the three
            months he said, with a dark significance in his manner, "I have tried all things but
            one"—and waited for her reply. "Try that," she said, and curled her lip in
            mockery. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e148">That night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes, then said to her: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e150">"Get up and dress!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e152">She obeyed—as always, without a word. He led her half a mile from the house, and
            proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public road; and succeeded, she
            screaming and struggling. He gagged her then, struck her across the face with his
            cowhide, and set his bloodhounds on her. They tore the clothes off her, and she was
            naked. He called the dogs off, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e154">"You will be found—by the passing public. They will be dropping along about three
            hours from now, and will spread the news—do you hear? Good-by. You have seen the
            last of me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e156">He went away then. She moaned to herself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e159">"I shall bear a child—to <i>him!</i> God grant it may be a boy!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e164">The farmers released her by and by—and spread the news, which was natural. They
            raised the country with lynching intentions, but the bird had flown. The young wife shut
            herself up in her father's house; he shut himself up with her, and thenceforth would see
            no one. His pride was broken, and his heart; so he wasted away, day by day, and even his
            daughter rejoiced when death relieved him. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e166">Then she sold the estate and disappeared.</p>Chapter 2<p id="TwaDoubd1e171">In 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded New England village,
            with no company but a little boy about five years old. She did her own work, she
            discouraged acquaintanceships, and had none. The butcher, the baker, and the others that
            served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was
            Stillman, and that she called the child Archy. Whence she came they had not been able to
            find out, but they said she talked like a Southerner. The child had no playmates and no
            comrade, and no teacher but the mother. She taught him diligently and intelligently, and
            was satisfied with the results—even a little proud of them. One day Archy said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e173">"Mamma, am I different from other children?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e175">"Well, I suppose not. Why?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e177">"There was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had been by and I
            said yes, and she said how long since I saw him and I said I hadn't seen him at all, and
            she said how did I know he'd been by, then, and I said because I smelt his track on the
            sidewalk, and she said I was a dum fool and made a mouth at me. What did she do that
            for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e179">The young woman turned white, and said to herself, "It's a birth mark! The gift of the
            bloodhound is in him." She snatched the boy to her breast and hugged him passionately,
            saying, "God has appointed the way!" Her eyes were burning with a fierce light, and her
            breath came short and quick with excitement. She said to herself: "The puzzle is solved
            now; many a time it has been a mystery to me, the impossible things the child has done
            in the dark, but it is all clear to me now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e181">She set him in his small chair, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e183">"Wait a little till I come, dear; then we will talk about the matter." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e185">She went up to her room and took from her dressing-table several small articles and put
            them out of sight: a nail-file on the floor under the bed; a pair of nail-scissors under
            the bureau; a small ivory paper-knife under the wardrobe. Then she returned, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e187">"There! I have left some things which I ought to have brought down." She named them,
            and said, "Run up and bring them, dear." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e189">The child hurried away on his errand and was soon back again with the things. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e192">"Did you have any difficulty, dear?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e194">"No, mamma; I only went where you went." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e196">During his absence she had stepped to the bookcase, taken several books from the bottom
            shelf, opened each, passed her hand over a page, noting its number in her memory, then
            restored them to their places. Now she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e198">"I have been doing something while you have been gone, Archy. Do you think you can find
            out what it was?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e200">The boy went to the bookcase and got out the books that had been touched, and opened
            them at the pages which had been stroked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e202">The mother took him in her lap, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e204">"I will answer your question now, dear. I have found out that in one way you are quite
            different from other people. You can see in the dark, you can smell what other people
            cannot, you have the talents of a bloodhound. They are good and valuable things to have,
            but you must keep the matter a secret. If people found it out, they would speak of you
            as an odd child, a strange child, and children would be disagreeable to you, and give
            you nicknames. In this world one must be like everybody else if he doesn't want to
            provoke scorn or envy or jealousy. It is a great and fine distinction which has been
            born to you, and I am glad; but you will keep it a secret, for mamma's sake, won't you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e206">The child promised, without understanding. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e208">All the rest of the day the mother's brain was busy with excited thinkings; with plans,
            projects, schemes, each and all of them uncanny, grim, and dark. Yet they lit up her
            face; lit it with a fell light of their own; lit it with vague fires of hell. She was in
            a fever of unrest; she could not sit, stand, read, sew; there was no relief for her but
            in movement. She tested her boy's gift in twenty ways, and kept saying to herself all
            the time, with her mind in the past: "He broke my father's heart, and night and day all
            these years I have tried, and all in vain, to think out a way to break his. I have found
            it now—I have found it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e210">When night fell, the demon of unrest still possessed her. She went on with her tests;
            with a candle she traversed the house from garret to cellar, hiding pins, needles,
            thimbles, spools, under pillows, under carpets, in cracks in the walls, under the coal
            in the bin; then sent the little fellow in the dark to find them; which he did, and was
            happy and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e212">From this time forward life took on a new complexion for her. She said, "The future is
            secure—I can wait, and enjoy the waiting." The most of her lost interests revived.
            She took up music again, and languages, drawing, painting, and the other long-discarded
            delights of her maidenhood. She was happy once more, and felt again the zest of life. As
            the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy, and was contented with it.
            Not altogether, but nearly that. The soft side of his heart was larger than the other
            side of it. It was his only defect, in her eyes. But she considered that his love for
            her and worship of her made up for it. He was a good hater—that was well; but it
            was a question if the materials of his hatreds were of as tough and enduring a quality
            as those of his friendships—and that was not so well. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e215">The years drifted on. Archy was become a handsome, shapely, athletic youth, courteous,
            dignified, companionable, pleasant in his ways, and looking perhaps a trifle older than
            he was, which was sixteen. One evening his mother said she had something of grave
            importance to say to him, adding that he was old enough to hear it now, and old enough
            and possessed of character enough and stability enough to carry out a stern plan which
            she had been for years contriving and maturing. Then she told him her bitter story, in
            all its naked atrociousness. For a while the boy was paralyzed; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e217">"I understand. We are Southerners; and by our custom and nature there is but one
            atonement. I will search him out and kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e219">"Kill him? No! Death is release, emancipation; death is a favor. Do I owe him favors?
            You must not hurt a hair of his head." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e221">The boy was lost in thought awhile; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e223">"You are all the world to me, and your desire is my law and my pleasure. Tell me what
            to do and I will do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e225">The mother's eyes beamed with satisfaction, and she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e227">"You will go and find him. I have known his hiding-place for eleven years; it cost me
            five years and more of inquiry, and much money, to locate it. He is a quartz-miner in
            Colorado, and well-to-do. He lives in Denver. His name is Jacob Fuller. There—it
            is the first time I have spoken it since that unforgettable night. Think! That name
            could have been yours if I had not saved you that shame and furnished you a cleaner one.
            You will drive him from that place; you will hunt him down and drive him again; and yet
            again, and again, and again, persistently, relentlessly, poisoning his life, filling it
            with mysterious terrors, loading it with weariness and misery, making him wish for
            death, and that he had a suicide's courage; you will make of him another Wandering Jew;
            he shall know no rest any more, no peace of mind, no placid sleep; you shall shadow him,
            cling to him, persecute him, till you break his heart, as he broke my father's and
            mine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e229">"I will obey, mother." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e231">"I believe it, my child. The preparations are all made; everything is ready. Here is a
            letter of credit; spend freely, there is no lack of money. At times you may need
            disguises. I have provided them; also some other conveniences." She took from the drawer
            of the typewriter-table several squares of paper. They all bore these typewritten
            words:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e233"><i>$10,000 REWARD</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e237"><i>It is believed that a certain man who is wanted in an Eastern
                state is sojourning here. In 1880, in the night, he tied his young wife to a tree by
                the public road, cut her across the face with a cowhide, and made his dogs tear her
                clothes from her, leaving her naked. He left her there, and fled the country. A

            night and placard one of these upon the building he occupies, and another one upon the
            post-office or in some other prominent place. It will be the talk of the region. At
            first you must give him several days in which to force a sale of his belongings at
            something approaching their value. We will ruin him by and by, but gradually; we must
            not impoverish him at once, for that could bring him to despair and injure his health,
            possibly kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e244">She took three or four more typewritten forms from the
            drawer—duplicates—and read one:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e246">. . . . . . . . . ., . . . . . . . . . ., 18. . . .</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e249"><i>To Jacob Fuller:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e253"><i>You have . . . . . . days in which to settle your affairs. You

That is sure."</p>Chapter III<p id="TwaDoubd1e275">Extracts from letters to the mother:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e277">DENVER, <i>April 3, 1897</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e282"><i>I have now been living several days in the same hotel with Jacob
                Fuller. I have his scent; I could track him through ten divisions of infantry and
                find him. I have often been near him and heard him talk. He owns a good mine, and
                has a fair income from it; but he is not rich. He learned mining in a good
                way—by working at it for wages. He is a cheerful creature, and his forty-three
                years sit lightly upon him; he could pass for a younger man—say thirty-six or
                thirty-seven. He has never married again—passes himself off for a widower. He
                stands well, is liked, is popular, and has many friends. Even I feel a drawing
                toward him—the paternal blood in me making its claim. How blind and
                unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature—the most of them, in
                fact! My task is become hard now—you realize it? you comprehend, and make
                allowances?—and the fire of it has cooled, more than I like to confess to
                myself, But I will carry it out. Even with the pleasure paled, the duty remains, and
                I will not spare him.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e286"><i>And for my help, a sharp resentment rises in me when I reflect

                happy. He, the guilty party, is absolved from all suffering; you, the innocent, are
                borne down with it. But be comforted—he shall harvest his share.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e290">SILVER GULCH, <i>May 19</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e295"><i>I placarded Form No. 1 at midnight of April 3; an hour later I
                slipped Form No. 2 under his chamber door, notifying him to leave Denver at or
                before 11.50 the night of the 14th.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e299"><i>Some late bird of a reporter stole one of my placards, then hunted
                the town over and found the other one, and stole that. In this manner he
                accomplished what the profession call a "scoop"—that is, he got a valuable
                item, and saw to it that no other paper got it. And so his paper—the principal
                one in the town—had it in glaring type on the editorial page in the morning,
                followed by a Vesuvian opinion of our wretch a column long, which wound up by adding
                a thousand dollars to our reward on the paper's account! The journals out here know
                how to do the noble thing—when there's business in it.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e303"><i>At breakfast I occupied my usual seat—selected because it
                afforded a view of papa Fuller's face, and was near enough for me to hear the talk
                that went on at his table. Seventy-five or a hundred people were in the room, and
                all discussing that item, and saying they hoped the seeker would find that rascal
                and remove the pollution of his presence from the town—with a rail, or a
                bullet, or something.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e307"><i>When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leave—folded
                up—in one hand, and the newspaper in the other; and it gave me more than half
                a pang to see him. His cheerfulness was all gone, and he looked old and pinched and
                ashy. And then—only think of the things he had to listen to! Mamma, he heard
                his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and characterizations drawn
                from the very dictionaries and phrase-books of Satan's own authorized editions down
                below. And more than that, he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them. His
                applause tasted bitter in his mouth, though; he could not disguise that from me; and
                it was observable that his appetite was gone; he only nibbled; he couldn't eat.
                Finally a man said:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e311"><i>"It is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing
                what this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel. I hope so."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e316"><i>Ah, dear, it was pitiful the way Fuller winced, and glanced around
                scared! He couldn't endure any more, and got up and left.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e320"><i>During several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in
                Mexico, and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could, and give the
                property his personal attention. He played his cards well; said he would take
                $40,000—a quarter in cash, the rest in safe notes; but that as he greatly
                needed money on account of his new purchase, he would diminish his terms for cash in
                full, He sold out for $30,000. And then, what do you think he did? He asked for
                greenbacks, and took them, saying the man in Mexico was a New-Englander, with a head
                full of crotchets, and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts. People thought it
                queer, since a draft on New York could produce greenbacks quite conveniently. There
                was talk of this odd thing, but only for a day; that is as long as any topic lasts
                in Denver.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e324"><i>I was watching, all the time. As soon as the sale was completed
                and the money paid—which was on the 11th—I began to stick to Fuller's
                track without dropping it for a moment. That night—no, 12th, for it was a
                little past midnight—I tracked him to his room, which was four doors from mine
                in the same hall; then I went back and put on my muddy day-laborer disguise,
                darkened my complexion, and sat down in my room in the gloom, with a gripsack handy,
                with a change in it, and my door ajar. For I suspected that the bird would take wing
                now. In half an hour an old woman passed by, carrying a grip: I caught the familiar
                whiff, and followed with my grip, for it was Fuller. He left the hotel by a side
                entrance, and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three
                blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness, and got into a two-horse hack, which of
                course was waiting for him by appointment. I took a seat (uninvited) on the trunk
                platform behind, and we drove briskly off. We drove ten miles, and the hack stopped
                at a way-station and was discharged. Fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow
                under the awning, as far as he could get from the light; I went inside, and watched
                the ticket-office. Fuller bought no ticket; I bought none. Presently the train came
                along, and he boarded a car; I entered the same car at the other end, and came down
                the aisle and took the seat behind him. When he paid the conductor and named his
                objective point, I dropped back several seats, while the conductor was changing a
                bill, and when he came to me I paid to the same place—about a hundred miles
                westward.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e328"><i>From that time for a week on end he led me a dance. He traveled
                here and there and yonder—always on a general westward trend—but he boas
                not a woman after the first day. He was a laborer, like myself, and wore bushy false
                whiskers. His outfit was perfect, and he could do the character without thinking
                about it, for he had served the trade for wages. His nearest friend could not have
                recognized him. At last he located himself here, the obscurest little mountain camp
                in Montana; he has a shanty, and goes out prospecting daily; is gone all day, and
                avoids society. I am living at a miner's boardinghouse, and it is an awful place:
                the bunks, the food, the dirt—everything.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e332"><i>We have been here four weeks, and in that time I have seen him but
                once; but every night I go over his track and post myself. As soon as he engaged a
                shanty here I went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed that Denver hotel to
                keep my baggage till I should send for it. I need nothing here but a change of army
                shirts, and I brought that with me.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e336">SILVER GULCH, <i>June 12</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e341"><i>The Denver episode has never found its way here, I think. I know
                the most of the men in camp, and they have never referred to it, at least in my
                hearing. Fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions. He has located a
                claim, two miles away, in an out-of-the-way place in the mountains; it promises very
                well, and he is working it diligently. Ah, but the change in him! He never smiles,
                and he keeps quite to himself, consorting with no one—he who was so fond of
                company and so cheery only two months ago. I have seen him passing along several
                times recently—drooping, forlorn, the spring gone from his step, a pathetic

                and edible food, and endurable beds, and bodily decency; then I will fetch my

                than the other one; he came here a young widower in '79, aged twenty-one—a
                year before you were married; and the documents to prove it are innumerable. Last
                night I talked with familiar friends of his who have known him from the day of his

                with the loss upon his mine made good; and there will be a banquet, and a
                torch-light procession, and there will not be any expense on anybody but me. Do you

                have not been able to think it out, and I have tried till my brains are addled. "If
                the gentleman who lately bought a mine in Mexico and sold one in Denver will send
                his address to" (to whom, mother!), "it will be explained to him that it was all a
                mistake; his forgiveness will be asked, and full reparation made for a loss which he
                sustained in a certain matter." Do you see? He would think it a trap. Well, any one
                would. If I should say, "It is now known that he was not the man wanted, but another
                man—a man who once bore the same name, but discarded it for good
                reasons"—would that answer? But the Denver people would wake up then and say
                "Oho!" and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks, and say, "Why did he
                run away if he wasn't the right man?—it is too thin." If I failed to find him
                he would be ruined there—there where there is no taint upon him now. You have

                mistake; a dog would have gone the other way. But I am only part dog, and can get
                very humanly stupid when excited. He had been stopping in that house ten days; I
                almost know, now, that he stops long nowhere, the past six or eight months, but is
                restless and has to keep moving. I understand that feeling! and I know what it is to
                feel it. He still uses the name he had registered when I came so near catching him
                nine months ago—"James Walker"; doubtless the same he adopted when he fled
                from Silver Gulch. An unpretending man, and has small taste for fancy names. I

                Hope Cañon; I traced him to a point thirty miles from here, but there I lost
                the trail; some one gave him a lift in a wagon, I suppose. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e463"><i>I am taking a rest, now—modified by searchings for the lost

                uncomfortably near to losing hope; but the miners in this little camp are good
                fellows, and I am used to their sort this long time back; and their breezy ways
                freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles. I have been here a month. I am
                cabining with a young fellow named "Sammy" Hillyer, about twenty-five, the only son
                of his mother—like me—and loves her dearly, and writes to her every
                week—part of which is like me. He is a timid body, and in the matter of
                intellect—well, he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire; but no
                matter, he is well liked; he is good and fine, and it is meat and bread and rest and
                luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again. I wish "James Walker"
                could have it. He had friends; he liked company. That brings up that picture of him,
                the time that I saw him last. The pathos of it! It comes before me often and often.
                At that very time, poor thing, I was girding up my conscience to make him move on
                again!</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e467"><i>Hillyer's heart is better than mine, better than anybody's in the
                community, I suppose, for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the
                camp—Flint Buckner—and the only man Flint ever talks with or allows to
                talk with him. He says he knows Flint's history, and that it is trouble that has
                made him what he is, and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can. Now
                none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a lodger like Flint
                Buckner, from all I hear about him outside. I think that this one detail will give
                you a better idea of Sammy's character than any labored-out description I could
                furnish you of him. In one of our talks he said something about like this: "Flint is
                a kinsman of mine, and he pours out all his troubles to me—empties his breast
                from time to time, or I reckon it would burst. There couldn't be any unhappier man,
                Archy Stillman; his life had been made up of misery of mind—he isn't near as
                old as he looks. He has lost the feel of reposefulness and peace—oh, years and
                years ago! He doesn't know what good luck is—never has had any; often says he
                wishes he was in the other hell, he is so tired of this one."</i></p>Chapter IV<p id="TwaDoubd1e474"><i>No real gentleman will tell the naked truth in the presence of

          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e478">It was a crisp and spicy morning in early October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with
            the glory-fires of autumn, hung burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge
            provided by kind Nature for the wingless wild things that have their homes in the
            tree-tops and would visit together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and
            yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the
            sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere;
            far in he empty sky a solitary esophagus[1] slept upon motionless

            away down in the Esmeralda region. It is a secluded spot, high and remote; recent as to
            discovery; thought by its occupants to be rich in metal—a year or two's
            prospecting will decide that matter one way or the other. For inhabitants, the camp has
            about two hundred miners, one white woman and child, several Chinese washermen, five
            squaws, and a dozen vagrant buck Indians in rabbit-skin robes, battered plug hats, and
            tin-can necklaces. There are no mills as yet; no church, no newspaper. The camp has
            existed but two years; it has made no big strike; the world is ignorant of its name and
            place. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e485">On both sides of the cañon the mountains rise wall-like, three thousand feet,
            and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the
            sun only once a day, when he sails over at noon. The village is a couple of miles long;
            the cabins stand well apart from each other. The tavern is the only "frame"
            house—the only house, one might say. It occupies a central position, and is the
            evening resort of the population. They drink there, and play seven-up and dominoes; also
            billiards, for there is a table, crossed all over with torn places repaired with
            court-plaster; there are some cues, but no leathers; some chipped balls which clatter
            when they run, and do not slow up gradually, but stop suddenly and sit down; there is a
            part of a cube of chalk, with a projecting jag of flint in it; and the man who can score
            six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bar's expense. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e487">Flint Buckner's cabin was the last one of the village, going south; his silver-claim
            was at the other end of the village, northward, and a little beyond the last hut in that
            direction. He was a sour creature, unsociable, and had no companionships. People who had
            tried to get acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him. His history was not
            known. Some believed that Sammy Hillyer knew it; others said no. If asked, Hillyer said
            no, he was not acquainted with it. Flint had a meek English youth of sixteen or
            seventeen with him, whom he treated roughly, both in public and in private; and of
            course this lad was applied to for information, but with no success. Fetlock
            Jones—name of the youth—said that Flint picked him up on a prospecting
            tramp, and as he had neither home nor friends in America, he had found it wise to stay
            and take Buckner's hard usage for the sake of the salary, which was bacon and beans.
            Further than this he could offer no testimony. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e489">Fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now, and under his meek exterior he was
            slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and humiliations which his master had put
            upon him. For the meek suffer bitterly from these hurts; more bitterly, perhaps, than do
            the manlier sort, who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the limit of
            endurance has been reached. Good-hearted people wanted to help Fetlock out of his
            trouble, and tried to get him to leave Buckner; but the boy showed fright at the
            thought, and said he "dasn't." Pat Riley urged him, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e491">"You leave the damned hunks and come with me; don't you be afraid. I'll take care of
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e496">The boy thanked him with tears in his eyes, but shuddered and said he "dasn't risk it";
            he said Flint would catch him alone, some time, in the night, and then—"Oh, it
            makes me sick, Mr. Riley, to think of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e498">Others said, "Run away from him; we'll stake you; skip out for the coast some night."
            But all these suggestions failed; he said Flint would hunt him down and fetch him back,
            just for meanness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e500">The people could not understand this. The boy's miseries went steadily on, week after
            week. It is quite likely that the people would have understood if they had known how he
            was employing his spare time. He slept in an out-cabin near Flint's; and there, nights,
            he nursed his bruises and his humiliations, and studied and studied over a single
            problem—how he could murder Flint Buckner and not be found out. It was the only
            joy he had in life; these hours were the only ones in the twenty-four which he looked
            forward to with eagerness and spent in happiness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e503">He thought of poison. No—that would not serve; the inquest would reveal where it
            was procured and who had procured it. He thought of a shot in the back in a lonely place
            when Flint would be homeward bound at midnight—his unvarying hour for the trip.
            No—somebody might be near, and catch him. He thought of stabbing him in his sleep.
            No—he might strike an inefficient blow, and Flint would seize him. He examined a
            hundred different ways—none of them would answer; for in even the very obscurest
            and secretest of them there was always the fatal defect of a <i>risk,</i> a chance, a possibility that he might be found out. He would have none of
            that. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e508">But he was patient, endlessly patient. There was no hurry, he said to himself. He would
            never leave Flint till he left him a corpse; there was no hurry—he would find the
            way. It was somewhere, and he would endure shame and pain and misery until he found it.
            Yes, somewhere there was a way which would leave not a trace, not even the faintest clue
            to the murderer—there was no hurry—he would find that way, and
            then—oh, then, it would just be good to be alive! Meantime he would diligently
            keep up his reputation for meekness; and also, as always theretofore, he would allow no
            one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about his oppressor. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e510">Two days before the before-mentioned October morning Flint had bought some things, and
            he and Fetlock had brought them home to Flint's cabin: a fresh box of candles, which
            they put in the corner; a tin can of blasting-powder, which they placed upon the
            candle-box; a keg of blasting-powder, which they placed under Flint's bunk; a huge coil
            of fuse, which they hung on a peg. Fetlock reasoned that Flint's mining operations had
            outgrown the pick, and that blasting was about to begin now. He had seen blasting done,
            and he had a notion of the process, but he had never helped in it. His conjecture was
            right—blasting-time had come. In the morning the pair carried fuse, drills, and
            the powder-can to the shaft; it was now eight feet deep, and to get into it and out of
            it a short ladder was used. They descended, and by command Fetlock held the
            drill—without any instructions as to the right way to hold it—and Flint
            proceeded to strike. The sledge came down; the drill sprang out of Fetlock's hand,
            almost as a matter of course. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e512">"You mangy son of a nigger, is that any way to hold a drill? Pick it up! Stand it up!
            There—hold fast. D— you! <i>I'll</i> teach you!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e517">At the end of an hour the drilling was finished. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e519">"Now, then, charge it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e521">The boy started to pour in the powder. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e523">"Idiot!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e525">A heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e527">"Get up! You can't lie sniveling there. Now, then, stick in the fuse <i>first. Now</i> put in the powder. Hold on, hold on! Are you going to fill the hole
              <i>all</i> up? Of all the sap-headed milksops I—Put in some
            dirt! Put in some gravel! Tamp it down! Hold on, hold on! Oh, great Scott! get out of
            the way!" He snatched the iron and tamped the charge himself, meantime cursing and
            blaspheming like a fiend. Then he fired the fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and ran
            fifty yards away, Fetlock following. They stood waiting a few minutes, then a great
            volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion; after a
            little there was a shower of descending stones; then all was serene again. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e535">"I wish to God you'd been in it!" remarked the master. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e538">They went down the shaft, cleaned it out, drilled another hole, and put in another
            charge. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e540">"Look here! How much fuse are you proposing to waste? Don't you know how to time a
            fuse?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e542">"No, sir." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e544">"You <i>don't!</i> Well, if you don't beat anything <i>I</i> ever saw!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e552">He climbed out of the shaft and spoke down: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e554">"Well, idiot, are you going to be all day? Cut the fuse and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e556">The trembling creature began: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e558">"If you please, sir, I—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e560">"You talk back to <i>me?</i> Cut it and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e565">The boy cut and lit. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e567">"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! I wish you were in—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e570">In his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft and ran. The boy was aghast. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e572">"Oh, my God! Help. Help! Oh, save me!" he implored. "Oh, what can I do! What <i>can</i> I do!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e577">He backed against the wall as tightly as he could; the sputtering fuse frightened the
            voice out of him; his breath stood still; he stood gazing and impotent; in two seconds,
            three seconds, four he would be flying toward the sky torn to fragments. Then he had an
            inspiration. He sprang at the fuse; severed the inch of it that was left above ground,
            and was saved. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e579">He sank down limp and half lifeless with fright, his strength gone; but he muttered
            with a deep joy: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e581">"He has learnt me! I knew there was a way, if I would wait." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e583">After a matter of five minutes Buckner stole to the shaft, looking worried and uneasy,
            and peered down into it. He took in the situation; he saw what had happened. He lowered
            the ladder, and the boy dragged himself weakly up it. He was very white. His appearance
            added something to Buckner's uncomfortable state, and he said, with a show of regret and
            sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from lack of practice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e585">"It was an accident, you know. Don't say anything about it to anybody; I was excited,
            and didn't notice what I was doing. You're not looking well; you've worked enough for
            to-day; go down to my cabin and eat what you want, and rest. It's just an accident, you
            know, on account of my being excited." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e587">"It scared me," said the lad, as he started away; "but I learnt something, so I don't
            mind it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e589">"Damned easy to please!" muttered Buckner, following him with his eye. I wonder if
            he'll tell? Mightn't he?... I wish it <i>had</i> killed him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e594">The boy took no advantage of his holiday in the matter of resting; he employed it in
            work, eager and feverish and happy work. A thick growth of chaparral extended down the
            mountainside clear to Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's labor was done in the dark
            intricacies of that stubborn growth; the rest of it was done in his own shanty. At last
            all was complete, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e596">"If he's got any suspicions that I'm going to tell on him, he won't keep them long,
            to-morrow. He will see that I am the same milksop as I always was—all day and the
            next. And the day after to-morrow night there 'll be an end of him; nobody will ever
            guess who finished him up nor how it was done. He dropped me the idea his own self, and
            that's odd."</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e602"> From the Springfield <i>Republican,</i> April 12, 1902.</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e607">To the Editor of the
                  Republican:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e610"><i>One of your citizens has asked me a
                  question about the "esophagus," and I wish to answer him through you. This in the
                  hope that the answer will get around, and save me some penmanship, for I have
                  already replied to the same question more than several times, and am not getting
                  as much holiday as I ought to have.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e614"><i>I
                  published a short story lately, and it was in that that I put the esophagus. I
                  will say privately that I expected it to bother some people—in fact, that
                  was the intention—but the harvest has been larger than I was calculating
                  upon. The esophagus has gathered in the guilty and the innocent alike, whereas I
                  was only fishing for the innocent—the innocent and confiding. I knew a few
                  of these would write and ask me; that would give me but little trouble; but, I was
                  not expecting that the wise and the learned would call upon me for succor.
                  However, that has happened, and it is time for me to speak up and stop the
                  inquiries if I can, for letter-writing is not restful to me, and I am not having
                  so much fun out of this thing as I counted on. That you may understand the
                  situation, I will insert a couple of sample inquiries. The first is from a public
                  instructor in the Philippines: </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e618">SANTA CRUZ, <i>Ilocos, Sur, P. I. </i><br><i>February 13,
                  1902</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e626"><i>My dear Sir,—I have just been
                  reading the first part of your latest story, entitled "A Double-barreled Detective
                  Story," and am very much delighted with it. In Part IV, page 264,</i> Harper's
                Magazine <i>for January, occurs this passage: "far in the empty sky a
                  solitary 'esophagus' slept upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness,
                  serenity, and the peace of God." Now, there is one word I do not understand,
                  namely, "esophagus." My only work of reference is the</i> Standard Dictionary,
                  <i>but that fails to explain the meaning. If you can spare the
                  time, I would be glad to have the meaning cleared up, as I consider the passage a
                  very touching and beautiful one. It may seem foolish to you, but consider my lack
                  of means away out in the northern part of Luzon.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e636"><i>Yours very truly.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e640"><i>Do you notice?
                  Nothing in the paragraph disturbed him but that one word. It shows that the
                  paragraph was most ably constructed for the deception it was intended to put upon
                  the reader. It was my intention that it should read plausibly, and it is now plain
                  that it does; it was my intention that it should be emotional and touching, and
                  you see, yourself, that it fetched this public instructor. Alas, If I had but left
                  that one treacherous word out, I should have scored! scored everywhere; and the
                  paragraph would have slidden through every reader's sensibilities like oil, and
                  left not a suspicion behind.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e644"><i>The other sample
                  inquiry is from a professor in a New England university. It contains one naughty
                  word (which I cannot bear to suppress), but he is not in the theological
                  department, so it is no harm:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e648"><i>Dear Mr.

                  wing."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e653"><i>It is not often I get a chance to read
                  much periodical literature, but I have just gone through at this belated period,
                  with much gratification and edification, your "Double-barreled Detective
                  Story."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e657"><i>But what in hell is an esophagus? I
                  keep one myself, but it never sleeps in the air or anywhere else. My profession is
                  to deal with words, and esophagus interested me the moment I lighted upon it. But
                  as a companion of my youth used to say, "I'll be eternally, co-eternally cussed"
                  if l can make it out. Is it a joke, or I an ignoramus?</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e661"><i>Between you and me, I was almost ashamed of having fooled that man,
                  but for pride's sake I was not going to say so. I wrote and told him it was a
                  joke—and that is what I am now saying to my Springfield inquirer. And I told
                  him to carefully read the whole paragraph, and he would find not a vestige of
                  sense in any detail of it. This also I commend to my Springfield

                  melodramatic passages in which it is difficult to detect the deception, so ably is
                  it done. But the illusion ought not to endure even the first incident in the
                  February number. As for the paragraph which has so admirably illustrated the skill
                  of Mr. Clemens's ensemble and the carelessness of readers, here it
              is:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e688"><i>"It was a crisp and spicy morning in early
                  October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung
                  burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind nature for
                  the wingless wild things that have their home in the tree-tops and would visit
                  together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow flames in
                  brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the sensuous
                  fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere; far
                  in the empty sky a solitary esophagus slept upon motionless wings; everywhere
                  brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e692"><i>The success of Mark Twain's joke recalls to mind his story of the
                  petrified man in the cavern, whom he described most punctiliously, first giving a
                  picture of the scene, its impressive solitude, and all that; then going on to
                  describe the majesty of the figure, casually mentioning that the thumb of his
                  right hand rested against the side of his nose; then after further description
                  observing that the fingers of the right hand were extended in a radiating fashion;
                  and, recurring to the dignified attitude and position of the man, incidentally
                  remarked that the thumb of the left hand was in contact with the little finger of
                  the right—and so on. But was it so ingeniously written that Mark, relating
                  the history years later in an article which appeared in that excellent magazine of
                  the past, the</i> Galaxy, <i>declared that no one ever found out
                  the joke, and, if we remember aright, that that astonishing old mockery was
                  actually looked for in the region where he, as a Nevada newspaper editor, had
                  located it. It is certain that Mark Twain's jumping frog has a good many more

            in the tavern billiard-room. Rough men in rough clothing, slouch-hats, breeches stuffed
            into boot-tops, some with vests, none with coats, are grouped about the boiler-iron
            stove, which has ruddy cheeks and is distributing a grateful warmth; the billiard-balls
            are clacking; there is no other sound—that is, within; the wind is fitfully
            moaning without. The men look bored; also expectant. A hulking broad-shouldered miner,
            of middle age, with grizzled whiskers, and an unfriendly eye set in an unsociable face,
            rises, slips a coil of fuse upon his arm, gathers up some other personal properties, and
            departs without word or greeting to anybody. It is Flint Buckner. As the door closes

            when it's twelve just by him leaving, without looking at your Waterbury." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e708">"And it's the only virtue he's got, as fur as I know," said Peter Hawes, miner. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e710">"He's just a blight on this society," said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "If I was
            running this shop I'd make him say something, <i>some</i> time or other,
            or vamos the ranch." This with a suggestive glance at the barkeeper, who did not choose
            to see it, since the man under discussion was a good customer, and went home pretty well
            set up, every night, with refreshments furnished from the bar. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e715">"Say," said Ham Sandwich, miner, "does any of you boys ever recollect of him asking you
            to take a drink?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e717"><i>"Him?</i> Flint <i>Buckner?</i> Oh, Laura!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e724">This sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous general outburst in one form of words or
            another from the crowd. After a brief silence, Pat Riley, miner, said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e726">"He's the 15-puzzle, that cuss. And his boy's another one. <i>I
            </i>can't make them out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e731">"Nor anybody else," said Ham Sandwich; "and if they are 15-puzzles how are you going to
            rank up that other one? When it comes to A 1 right-down solid mysteriousness, he lays
            over both of them. <i>Easy—</i>don't he?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e737">"You bet!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e739">Everybody said it. Every man but one. He was the new-comer-Peterson. He ordered the
            drinks all round, and asked who No. 3 might be. All answered at once, "Archy Stillman!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e741">"Is he a mystery?" asked Peterson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e743">"Is <i>he</i> a mystery? Is Archy <i>Stillman a</i>
            mystery?" said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "Why, the fourth dimension's foolishness to
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e754">For Ferguson was learned. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e756">Peterson wanted to hear all about him; everybody wanted to tell him; everybody began.
            But Billy Stevens, the barkeeper, called the house to order, and said one at a time was
            best. He distributed the drinks, and appointed Ferguson to lead. Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e758">"Well, he's a boy. And that is just about all we know about him. You can pump him till
            you are tired; it ain't any use; you won't get anything. At least about his intentions,
            or line of business, or where he's from, and such things as that. And as for getting at
            the nature and get-up of his main big chief mystery, why, he'll just change the subject,
            that's all. You can <i>guess</i> till you're black in the
            face—it's your privilege—but suppose you do, where do you arrive at?
            Nowhere, as near as I can make out," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e763">"What <i>is</i> his big chief one?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e768">"Sight, maybe. Hearing, maybe. Instinct, maybe. Magic, maybe. Take your
            choice—grownups, twenty-five; children and servants, half price. Now I'll tell you
            what he can do. You can start here, and just disappear; you can go and hide wherever you
            want to, I don't care where it is, nor how far—and he'll go straight and put his
            finger on you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e770">"You don't mean it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e772">"I just do, though. Weather's nothing to him—elemental conditions is nothing to
            him—he don't even take notice of them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e775">"Oh, come! Dark? Rain? Snow? Hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e777">"It's all the same to <i>him.</i> He don't give a damn." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e782">"Oh, <i>say—</i>including <i>fog,</i> per'aps?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e790"><i>"Fog!</i> he's got an eye 't can plunk through it like a bullet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e794">"Now, boys, honor bright, what's he giving me?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e796">"It's a fact!" they all shouted. "Go on, Wells-Fargo." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e798">"Well, sir, you can leave him here, chatting with the boys, and you can slip out and go
            to any cabin in this camp and open a book—yes, sir, a dozen of them—and take
            the page in your memory, and he'll start out and go straight to that cabin and open
            every one of them books at the right page, and call it off, and never make a mistake." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e800">"He must be the devil!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e802">"More than one has thought it. Now I'll tell you a perfectly wonderful thing that he
            done. The other night he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e804">There was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside, the door flew open, and an excited
            crowd burst in, with the camp's one white woman in the lead and crying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e806">"My child! my child! she's lost and gone! For the love of God help me to find Archy
            Stillman; we've hunted everywhere!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e809">Said the barkeeper: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e811">"Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, and don't worry. He asked for a bed three hours ago,
            tuckered out tramping the trails the way he's always doing, and went up-stairs. Ham
            Sandwich, run up and roust him out; he's in No. 14." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e813">The youth was soon down-stairs and ready. He asked Mrs. Hogan for particulars. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e815">"Bless you, dear, there ain't any; I wish there was. I put her to sleep at seven in the
            evening, and when I went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself, she was gone. I
            rushed for your cabin, dear, and you wasn't there, and I've hunted for you ever since,
            at every cabin down the gulch, and now I've come up again, and I'm that distracted and
            scared and heartbroke; but, thanks to God, I've found you at last, dear heart, and
            you'll find my child. Come on! come quick!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e817">"Move right along; I'm with you, madam. Go to your cabin first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e819">The whole company streamed out to join the hunt. All the southern half of the village
            was up, a hundred men strong, and waiting outside, a vague dark mass sprinkled with
            twinkling lanterns. The mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself
            to the narrow road, and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders. In a
            few minutes the Hogan cabin was reached. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e821">"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Hogan; "there's where she was; it's where I laid her at
            seven o'clock; but where she is now, God only knows." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e823">"Hand me a lantern," said Archy. He set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it,
            pretending to examine the ground closely. "Here's her track," he said, touching the
            ground here and there and yonder with his finger. "Do you see?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e825">Several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see. One or two
            thought they discerned something like a track; the others shook their heads and
            confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp
            enough to discover. One said, "Maybe a child's foot could make a mark on it, but <i>I</i> don't see how." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e830">Young Stillman stepped outside, held the light to the ground, turned leftward, and
            moved three steps, closely examining; then said, "I've got the direction—come
            along; take the lantern, somebody." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e832">He strode off swiftly southward, the files following, swaying and bending in and out
            with the deep curves of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the mouth of the gorge was reached;
            before them stretched the sagebrush plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman called a halt,
            saying, "We mustn't start wrong, now; we must take the direction again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e835">He took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards; then said,
            "Come on; it's all right," and gave up the lantern. In and out among the sage-bushes he
            marched, a quarter of a mile, bearing gradually to the right; then took a new direction
            and made another great semicircle; then changed again and moved due west nearly half a
            mile—and stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e837">"She gave it up, here, poor little chap. Hold the lantern. You can see where she sat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e839">But this was in a slick alkali flat which was surfaced like steel, and no person in the
            party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a
            cushion on a veneer like that. The bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the
            spot, lamenting. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e841">"But where is she, then?" some one said. "She didn't stay here. We can see <i>that</i> much, anyway." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e846">Stillman moved about in a circle around the place, with the lantern, pretending to hunt
            for tracks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e848">"Well!" he said presently, in an annoyed tone, "I don't understand it." He examined
            again. "No use. She was here—that's certain; she never <i>walked</i> away from here—and that's certain. It's a puzzle; I can't make it
            out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e853">The mother lost heart then. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e855">"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! some flying beast has got her. I'll never see her
            again!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e857">"Ah, <i>don't</i> give up," said Archy. "We'll find her—don't
            give up." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e862">"God bless you for the words, Archy Stillman!" and she seized his hand and kissed it
            fervently. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e864">Peterson, the new-comer, whispered satirically in Ferguson's ear: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e867">"Wonderful performance to find this place, wasn't it? Hardly worth while to come so
            far, though; any other supposititious place would have answered just as well—hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e869">Ferguson was not pleased with the innuendo. He said, with some warmth: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e871">"Do you mean to insinuate that the child hasn't been here? I tell you the child <i>has</i> been here! Now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a
            little fuss as—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e876">"All right!" sang out Stillman. "Come, everybody, and look at this! It was right under
            our noses all the time, and we didn't see it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e878">There was a general plunge for the ground at the place where the child was alleged to
            have rested, and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to see the thing that Archy's finger
            was resting upon. There was a pause, then a several-barreled sigh of disappointment. Pat
            Riley and Ham Sandwich said, in the one breath: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e880">"What is it, Archy? There's nothing here." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e882">"Nothing? Do you call <i>that</i> nothing?" and he swiftly traced upon
            the ground a form with his finger. "There—don't you recognize it now? It's Injun
            Billy's track. He's got the child." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e887">"God be praised !" from the mother. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e889">"Take away the lantern. I've got the direction. Follow!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e891">He started on a run, racing in and out among the sage-bushes a matter of three hundred
            yards, and disappeared over a sand-wave; the others struggled after him, caught him up,
            and found him waiting. Ten steps away was a little wickiup, a dim and formless shelter
            of rags and old horse-blankets, a dull light showing through its chinks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e893">"You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the lad. "It's your privilege to be first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e896">All followed the sprint she made for the wickiup, and saw, with her, the picture its
            interior afforded. Injun Billy was sitting on the ground; the child was asleep beside
            him. The mother hugged it with a wild embrace, which included Archy Stillman, the
            grateful tears running down her face, and in a choked and broken voice she poured out a
            golden stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments which has its home in full
            richness nowhere but in the Irish heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e898">"I find her bymeby it is ten o'clock," Billy explained. "She 'sleep out yonder, ve'y
            tired—face wet, been cryin', 'spose; fetch her home, feed her, she heap much
            hungry—go 'sleep 'gin." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e900">In her limitless gratitude the happy mother waived rank and hugged him too, calling him
            "the angel of God in disguise." And he probably was in disguise if he was that kind of
            an official. He was dressed for the character. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e902">At half past one in the morning the procession burst into the village singing, "When
            Johnny Comes Marching Home," waving its lanterns and swallowing the drinks that were
            brought out all along its course. It concentrated at the tavern, and made a night of
            what was left of the morning.</p>Chapter VI<p id="TwaDoubd1e907">The next afternoon the village was electrified with an immense sensation. A grave and
            dignified foreigner of distinguished bearing and appearance had arrived at the tavern,
            and entered this formidable name upon the register: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e909">SHERLOCK HOLMES
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e913">The news buzzed from cabin to cabin, from claim to claim; tools were dropped, and the
            town swarmed toward the center of interest. A man passing out at the northern end of the
            village shouted it to Pat Riley, whose claim was the next one to Flint Buckner's. At
            that time Fetlock Jones seemed to turn sick. He muttered to himself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e915">"Uncle <i>Sherlock!</i> The mean luck of it!—that <i>he </i>should come just when..." He dropped into a reverie, and
            presently said to himself: "But what's the use of being afraid of <i>him?
            </i>Anybody that knows him the way I do knows he can't detect a crime except where he
            plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and hires some fellow to commit it
            according to instructions.... Now there ain't going to <i>be</i> any
            clues this time—so, what show has he got? None at all. No, sir; everything's
            ready. If I was to risk putting it off—...No, I won't run any risk like that.
            Flint Buckner goes out of this world to-night, for sure." Then another trouble presented
            itself. "Uncle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening, and
            how am I going to get rid of him? for I've <i>got</i> to be at my cabin
            a minute or two about eight o'clock." This was an awkward matter, and cost him much
            thought. But he found a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll go for a walk, and I'll leave
            him in the road a minute, so that he won't see what it is I do: the best way to throw a
            detective off the track, anyway, is to have him along when you are preparing the thing.
            Yes, that's the safest—I'll take him with me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e932">Meantime the road in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping
            for a glimpse of the great man. But he kept his room, and did not appear. None but
            Ferguson, Jake Parker the blacksmith, and Ham Sandwich had any luck. These enthusiastic
            admirers of the great scientific detective hired the tavern's detained-baggage lockup,
            which looked into the detective's room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide,
            ambushed themselves in it, and cut some peep-holes in the window-blind. Mr. Holmes's
            blinds were down; but by and by he raised them. It gave the spies a hair-lifting but
            pleasurable thrill to find themselves face to face with the Extraordinary Man who had
            filled the world with the fame of his more than human ingenuities. There he
            sat—not a myth, not a shadow, but real, alive, compact of substance, and almost
            within touching distance with the hand. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e934">"Look at that head!" said Ferguson, in an awed voice. "By gracious! <i>that's</i> a head!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e939">"You bet!" said the blacksmith, with deep reverence. "Look at his nose! look at his
            eyes! Intellect? Just a battery of it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e941">"And that paleness," said Ham Sandwich. "Comes from thought—that's what it comes
            from. Hell! duffers like us don't know what real thought <i>is."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e946">"No more we don't," said Ferguson. "What we take for thinking is just
            blubber-and-slush," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e948">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo. And look at that frown—that's <i>deep</i> thinking—away down, down, forty fathom into the bowels of things.
            He's on the track of something." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e954">"Well, he is, and don't you forget it. Say—look at that awful gravity—look
            at that pallid solemness—there ain't any corpse can lay over it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e956">"No, sir, not for dollars! And it's his'n by hereditary rights, too; he's been dead
            four times a'ready, and there's history for it. Three times natural, once by accident.
            I've heard say he smells damp and cold, like a grave. And he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e958">" 'Sh! Watch him! There—he's got his thumb on the bump on the near corner of his
            forehead, and his forefinger on the off one. His think-works is just a-<i>grinding</i> now, you bet your other shirt." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e963">"That's so. And now he's gazing up toward heaven and stroking his mustache slow,
            and—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e965">"Now he has rose up standing, and is putting his clues together on his left fingers
            with his right finger. See? he touches the forefinger—now middle finger—now
            ring-finger—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e967">"Stuck!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e969">"Look at him scowl! He can't seem to make out <i>that</i> clue. So
            he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e974">"See him smile!—like a tiger—and tally off the other fingers like nothing!
            He's got it, boys; he's got it sure!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e976">"Well, I should <i>say!</i> I'd hate to be in that man's place that
            he's after." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e981">Mr. Holmes drew a table to the window, sat down with his back to the spies, and
            proceeded to write. The spies withdrew their eyes from the peep-holes, lit their pipes,
            and settled themselves for a comfortable smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with conviction: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e983">"Boys, it's no use talking, he's a wonder! He's got the signs of it all over him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e986">"You hain't ever said a truer word than that, Wells-Fargo," said Jake Parker. "Say,
            wouldn't it 'a' been nuts if he'd a-been here last night?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e988">"Oh, by George, but wouldn't it!" said Ferguson. "Then we'd have seen <i>scientific</i> work. Intellect—just pure intellect—away up on the upper
            levels, dontchuknow. Archy is all right, and it don't become anybody to belittle <i>him,</i> I can tell you. But his gift is only just eyesight, sharp as
            an owl's, as near as I can make it out just a grand natural animal talent, no more, no
            less, and prime as far as it goes, but no intellect in it, and for awfulness and
            marvelousness no more to be compared to what this man does than—than—Why,
            let me tell you what <i>he'd</i> have done. He'd have stepped over to
            Hogan's and glanced—just <i>glanced,</i> that's all—at the
            premises, and that's enough. See everything? Yes, sir, to the last little detail; and
            he'll know more about that place than the Hogans would know in seven years. Next, he
            would sit down on the bunk, just as ca'm, and say to Mrs. Hogan—<i>Say,</i> Ham, consider that you are Mrs. Hogan. I'll ask the questions; you answer
            them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1005">"All right; go on." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1007">" 'Madam, if you please—attention—do not let your mind wander. Now,

            Thanks. Cotton. Shows wear. An excellent clue, excellent. Pass me a pallet of the floor
            dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, many thanks. Ah, admirable, admirable! <i>Now</i> we know where we are, I think.' You see, boys, he's got all the
            clues he wants now; he don't need anything more. Now, then, what does this Extraordinary
            Man do? He lays those snips and that dirt out on the table and leans over them on his
            elbows, and puts them together side by side and studies them—mumbles to himself,
            'Female'; changes them around—mumbles, 'Six years old'; changes them this way and
            that—again mumbles: 'Five teeth—one
            a-coming—Catholic—yarn—cotton—kip—damn that kip.' Then he
            straightens up and gazes toward heaven, and plows his hands through his hair—plows
            and plows, muttering, 'Damn that kip!' Then he stands up and frowns, and begins to tally
            off his clues on his fingers—and gets stuck at the ring-finger. But only just a
            minute—then his face glares all up in a smile like a house afire, and he
            straightens up stately and majestic, and says to the crowd, 'Take a lantern, a couple of
            you, and go down to Injun Billy's and fetch the child—the rest of you go 'long
            home to bed; good-night, madam; good-night, gents.' And he bows like the Matterhorn, and
            pulls out for the tavern. That's <i>his</i> style, and the <i>Only—</i>scientific, intellectual—all over in fifteen
            minutes—no poking around all over the sage-brush range an hour and a half in a
            mass-meeting crowd for <i>him,</i> boys—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1055">"By Jackson, it's grand!" said Ham Sandwich. "Wells-Fargo, you've got him down to a
            dot. He ain't painted up any exacter to the life in the books. By George, I can juse <i>see</i> him—can't you, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1060">"You bet you! It's just a photograft, that's what it is." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1062">Ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success, and grateful. He sat silently
            enjoying his happiness a little while, then he murmured, with a deep awe in his voice, </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1064">"I wonder if God made him?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1066">There was no response for a moment; then Ham Sandwich said, reverently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1068">"Not all at one time, I reckon."</p>Chapter VII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1073">At eight o'clock that evening two persons were groping their way past Flint Buckner's
            cabin in the frosty gloom. They were Sherlock Holmes and his nephew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1075">"Stop here in the road a moment, uncle," said Fetlock, "while I run to my cabin; I
            won't be gone a minute." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1077">He asked for something—the uncle furnished it—then he disappeared in the
            darkness, but soon returned, and the talking-walk was resumed. By nine o'clock they had
            wandered back to the tavern. They worked their way through the billiard-room, where a
            crowd had gathered in the hope of getting a glimpse of the Extraordinary Man. A royal
            cheer was raised. Mr. Holmes acknowledged the compliment with a series of courtly bows,
            and as he was passing out his nephew said to the assemblage: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1079">"Uncle Sherlock's got some work to do, gentlemen, that 'll keep him till twelve or one;
            but he'll be down again then, or earlier if he can, and hopes some of you'll be left to
            take a drink with him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1081">"By George, he's just a duke, boys! Three cheers for Sherlock Holmes, the greatest man
            that ever lived!" shouted Ferguson. "Hip, hip, hip—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1083">"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Tiger!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1085">The uproar shook the building, so hearty was the feeling the boys put into their
            welcome. Up-stairs the uncle reproached the nephew gently, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1087">"What did you get me into that engagement for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1089">"I reckon you don't want to be unpopular, do you, uncle? Well, then, don't you put on
            any exclusiveness in a mining-camp, that's all. The boys admire you; but if you was to
            leave without taking a drink with them, they'd set you down for a snob. And besides, you
            said you had home talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1091">The boy was right, and wise—the uncle acknowledged it. The boy was wise in
            another detail which he did not mention—except to himself: "Uncle and the others
            will come handy—in the way of nailing an <i>alibi </i>where it
            can't be budged." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1097">He and his uncle talked diligently about three hours. Then, about midnight, Fetlock
            stepped down-stairs and took a position in the dark a dozen steps from the tavern, and
            waited. Five minutes later Flint Buckner came rocking out of the billiard-room and
            almost brushed him as he passed. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1099">"I've <i>got</i> him!" muttered the boy. He continued to himself,
            looking after the shadowy form: "Good-by—good-by for good, Flint Buckner; you
            called my mother a—well, never mind what: it's all right, now; you're taking your
            last walk, friend." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1104">He went musing back into the tavern. "From now till one is an hour. We'll spend it with
            the boys; it's good for the <i>alibi."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1109">He brought Sherlock Holmes to the billiard-room, which was jammed with eager and
            admiring miners; the guest called the drinks, and the fun began. Everybody was happy;
            everybody was complimentary; the ice was soon broken, songs, anecdotes, and more drinks
            followed, and the pregnant minutes flew. At six minutes to one, when the jollity was at
            its highest— </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1111"><i>Boom!</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1115">There was silence instantly. The deep sound came rolling and rumbling frown peak to
            peak up the gorge, then died down, and ceased. The spell broke, then, and the men made a
            rush for the door, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1117">"Something's blown up!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1119">Outside, a voice in the darkness said, "It's away down the gorge; I saw the flash." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1121">The crowd poured down the cañon—Holmes, Fetlock, Archy Stillman,
            everybody. They made the mile in a few minutes. By the light of a lantern they found the
            smooth and solid dirt floor of Flint Buckner's cabin; of the cabin itself not a vestige
            remained, not a rag nor a splinter. Nor any sign of Flint. Search-parties sought here
            and there and yonder, and presently a cry went up. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1123">"Here he is!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1125">It was true. Fifty yards down the gulch they had found him—that is, they had
            found a crushed and lifeless mass which represented him. Fetlock Jones hurried thither
            with the others and looked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1128">The inquest was a fifteen-minute affair. Ham Sandwich, foreman of the jury, handed up
            the verdict, which was phrased with a certain unstudied literary grace, and closed with
            this finding, to wit: that "deceased came to his death by his own act or some other
            person or persons unknown to this jury not leaving any family or similar effects behind
            but his cabin which was blown away and God have mercy on his soul amen." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1130">Then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd, for the storm-center of interest was
            there—Sherlock Holmes. The miners stood silent and reverent in a half-circle,
            inclosing a large vacant space which included the front exposure of the site of the late
            premises. In this considerable space the Extraordinary Man was moving about, attended by
            his nephew with a lantern. With a tape he took measurements of the cabin site; of the
            distance from the wall of chaparral to the road; of the height of the chaparral bushes;
            also various other measurements. He gathered a rag here, a splinter there, and a pinch
            of earth yonder, inspected them profoundly, and preserved them. He took the "lay" of the
            place with a pocket-compass, allowing two seconds for magnetic variation. He took the
            time (Pacific) by his watch, correcting it for local time. He paced off the distance
            from the cabin site to the corpse, and corrected that for tidal differentiation. He took
            the altitude with a pocket-aneroid, and the temperature with a pocket-thermometer.
            Finally he said, with a stately bow: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1132">"It is finished. Shall we return, gentlemen?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1134">He took up the line of march for the tavern, and the crowd fell into his wake,
            earnestly discussing and admiring the Extraordinary Man, and interlarding guesses as to
            the origin of the tragedy and who the author of it might he. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1136">"My, but it's grand luck having him here—hey, boys?" said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1138">"It's the biggest thing of the century," said Ham Sandwich. "It 'll go all over the
            world; you mark my words." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1140"><i>"You</i> bet!" said Jake Parker, the blacksmith. "It 'll boom this
            camp. Ain't it so, Wells-Fargo?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1144">"Well, as you want my opinion—if it's any sign of how <i>I
            </i>think about it, I can tell you this: yesterday I was holding the Straight Flush
            claim at two dollars a foot; I'd like to see the man that can get it at sixteen to-day." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1149">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo! It's the grandest luck a new camp ever struck. Say, did
            you see him collar them little rags and dirt and things? What an eye! He just can't
            overlook a clue—'tain't <i>in </i>him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1154">"That's so. And they wouldn't mean a thing to anybody else; but to him, why, they're
            just a book—large print at that." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1156">"Sure's you're born! Them odds and ends have got their little old secret, and they
            think there ain't anybody can pull it; but, land! when he sets his grip there they've
            got to squeal, and don't you forget it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1159">"Boys, I ain't sorry, now, that he wasn't here to roust out the child; this is a bigger
            thing, by a long sight. Yes, sir, and more tangled up and scientific and intellectual." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1161">"I reckon we're all of us glad it's turned out this way. Glad? 'George! it ain't any
            name for it. Dontchuknow, Archy could 've <i>learnt</i> something if
            he'd had the nous to stand by and take notice of how that man works the system. But no;
            he went poking up into the chaparral and just missed the whole thing." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1166">"It's true as gospel; I seen it myself. Well, Archy's young. He'll know better one of
            these days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1168">"Say, boys, who do you reckon done it?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1170">That was a difficult question, and brought out a world of unsatisfying conjecture.
            Various men were mentioned as possibilities, but one by one they were discarded as not
            being eligible. No one but young Hillyer had been intimate with Flint Buckner; no one
            had really had a quarrel with him; he had affronted every man who had tried to make up
            to him, although not quite offensively enough to require bloodshed. There was one name
            that was upon every tongue from the start, but it <i>was</i> the last to
            get utterance—Fetlock Jones's. It was Pat Riley that mentioned it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1175">"Oh, well," the boys said, "of course we've all thought of him, because he had a
            million rights to kill Flint Buckner, and it was just his plain duty to do it. But all
            the same there's two things we can't get around: for one thing, he hasn't got the sand;
            and for another, he wasn't anywhere near the place when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1177">"I know it," said Pat. "He was there in the billiard-room with us when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1179">"Yes, and was there all the time for an hour <i>before</i> it
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1184">"It's so. And lucky for him, too. He'd have been suspected in a minute if it hadn't
            been for that."</p>Chapter VIII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1189">The tavern dining-room had been cleared of all its furniture save one six-foot pine
            table and a chair. This table was against one end of the room; the chair was on it;
            Sherlock Holmes, stately, imposing, impressive, sat in the chair. The public stood. The
            room was full. The tobacco-smoke was dense, the stillness profound. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1191">The Extraordinary Man raised his hand to command additional silence; held it in the air
            a few moments; then, in brief, crisp terms he put forward question after question, and
            noted the answers with "Um-ums," nods of the head, and so on. By this process he learned
            all about Flint Buckner, his character, conduct, and habits, that the people were able
            to tell him. It thus transpired that the Extraordinary Man's nephew was the only person
            in the camp who had a killing-grudge against Flint Buckner. Mr. Holmes smiled
            compassionately upon the witness, and asked, languidly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1193">"Do any of you gentlemen chance to know where the lad Fetlock Jones was at the time of
            the explosion?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1195">A thunderous response followed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1197">"In the billiard-room of this house!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1199">"Ah. And had he just come in?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1201">"Been there all of an hour!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1203">"Ah. It is about—about—well, about how far might it be to the scene of the
            explosions" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1205">"All of a mile!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1207">"Ah. It isn't <i>much</i> of an alibi, 'tis true, but—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1213">A storm-burst of laughter, mingled with shouts of "By jiminy, but he's
            chain-lightning!" and "Ain't you sorry you spoke, Sandy?" shut off the rest of the
            sentence, and the crushed witness drooped his blushing face in pathetic shame. The
            inquisitor resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1215">"The lad Jones's somewhat <i>distant</i> connection with the case"
              (laughter<i>) "</i>having been disposed of, let us now call the
            eye-witnesses of the tragedy, and listen to what they have to say." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1223">He got out his fragmentary clues and arranged them on a sheet of cardboard on his knee.
            The house held its breath and watched. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1225">"We have the longitude and the latitude, corrected for magnetic variation, and this
            gives us the exact location of the tragedy. We have the altitude, the temperature, and
            the degree of humidity prevailing—inestimably valuable, since they enable us to
            estimate with precision the degree of influence which they would exercise upon the mood
            and disposition of the assassin at that time of the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1227"><i>(Buzz of admiration; muttered remark, "By George, but he's
              deep.")</i> He fingered his clues. "And now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak
            to us. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1231">"Here we have an empty linen shot-bag. What is its message? This: that robbery was the
            motive, not revenge. What is its further message? This: that the assassin was of
            inferior intelligence—shall we say light-witted, or perhaps approaching that? How
            do we know this? Because a person of sound intelligence would not have proposed to rob
            the man Buckner, who never had much money with him. But the assassin might have been a
            stranger? Let the bag speak again. I take from it this article. It is a bit of
            silver-bearing quartz. It is peculiar. Examine it, please—you—and
            you—and you. Now pass it back, please. There is but one lode on this coast which
            produces just that character and color of quartz; and that is a lode which crops out for
            nearly two miles on a stretch, and in my opinion is destined, at no distant day, to
            confer upon its locality a globe-girdling celebrity, and upon its two hundred owners
            riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Name that lode, please." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1233">"The Consolidated Christian Science and Mary Ann!" was the prompt response. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1235">A wild crash of hurrahs followed, and every man reached for his neighbor's hand and
            wrung it, with tears in his eyes; and Wells-Fargo Ferguson shouted, "The Straight Flush
            is on the lode, and up she goes to a hunched and fifty a foot—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1240">When quiet fell, Mr. Holmes resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1242">"We perceive, then, that three facts are established, to wit: the assassin was
            approximately light-witted; he was not a stranger; his motive was robbery, not revenge.
            Let us proceed. I hold in my hand a small fragment of fuse, with the recent smell of
            fire upon it. What is its testimony? Taken with the corroborative evidence of the
            quartz, it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner. What does it tell us further?
            This, gentlemen: that the assassination was consummated by means of an explosive. What
            else does it say? This: that the explosive was located against the side of the cabin
            nearest the road—the front side—for within six feet of that spot I found it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1244">"I hold in my fingers a burnt Swedish match—the kind one rubs on a safety-box. I
            found it in the road, six hundred and twenty-two feet from the abolished cabin. What
            does it say? This: that the train was fired from that point. What further does it tell
            us? This: that the assassin was left-handed. How do I know this? I should not be able to
            explain to you, gentlemen, how I know it, the signs being so subtle that only long
            experience and deep study can enable one to detect them. But the signs are here, and
            they are reinforced by a fact which you must have often noticed in the great detective
            narratives—that <i>all </i>assassins are left-handed." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1250">"By Jackson, <i>that's</i> so." said Ham Sandwich, bringing his great
            hand down with a resounding slap upon his thigh; "blamed if I ever thought of it
            before." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1255">"Nor I!" "Nor I!" cried several. "Oh, there can't anything escape <i>him—</i>look at his eye!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1260">"Gentlemen, distant as the murderer was from his doomed victim, he did not wholly
            escape injury. This fragment of wood which I now exhibit to you struck him. It drew
            blood. Wherever he is, he bears the telltale mark. I picked it up where he stood when he
            fired the fatal train," He looked out over the house from his high perch, and his
            countenance began to darken; he slowly raised his hand, and pointed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1262">"There stands the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1264">For a moment the house was paralyzed with amazement; then twenty voices burst out with: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1266">"Sammy Hillyer? Oh, <i>hell,</i> no! <i>Him?</i> It's
            pure foolishness!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1274">"Take care, gentlemen—be not hasty. Observe—he has the blood-mark on his
            brow." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1276">Hillyer turned white with fright. He was near to crying. He turned this way and that,
            appealing to every face for help and sympathy; and held out his supplicating hands
            toward Holmes and began to plead: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1278"><i>"Don't,</i> oh, don't! I never did it; I give my word I never did
            it. The way I got this hurt on my forehead was—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1282">"Arrest him, constable!" cried Holmes. "I will swear out the warrant" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1284">The constable moved reluctantly forward—hesitated—stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1287">Hillyer broke out with another appeal. "Oh, Archy, don't let them do it; it would kill
            mother! <i>You</i> know how I got the hurt. Tell them, and save me,
            Archy; save me!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1292">Stillman worked his way to the front, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1294">"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be afraid." Then he said to the house, "Never mind how he
            got the hurt; it hasn't anything to do with this case, and isn't of any consequence." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1296">"God bless you, Archy, for a true friend!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1298">"Hurrah for Archy! Go in, boy, and play 'em a knock-down flush to their two pair 'n' a
            jack!" shouted the house, pride in their home talent and a patriotic sentiment of
            loyalty to it rising suddenly in the public heart and changing the whole attitude of the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1300">Young Stillman waited for the noise to cease; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1302">"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand by that door yonder, and Constable Harris to stand by
            the other one here, and not let anybody leave the room. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1304">"Said and done. Go on, old man!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1306">"The criminal is present, I believe. I will show him to you before long, in case I am
            right in my guess. Now I will tell you all about the tragedy, from start to finish. The
            motive <i>wasn't </i>robbery; it was revenge. The murderer <i>wasn't</i> light-witted. He <i>didn't</i> stand six
            hundred and twenty-two feet away. He <i>didn't </i>get hit with a piece
            of wood. He <i>didn't</i> place the explosive against the cabin. He <i>didn't</i> bring a shot-bag with him, and he <i>wasn't</i> left-handed. With the exception of these errors, the distinguished
            guest's statement of the case is substantially correct." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1330">A comfortable laugh rippled over the house; friend nodded to friend, as much as to say,
            "That's the word, with the bark <i>on</i> it. Good lad, good boy. <i>He</i> ain't lowering his flag any!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1338">The guest's serenity was not disturbed. Stillman resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1341">"I also have some witnesses; and I will presently tell you where you can find some
            more." He held up a piece of coarse wire; the crowd craned their necks to see. "It has a
            smooth coating of melted tallow on it. And here is a candle which is burned half-way
            down. The remaining half of it has marks cut upon it an inch apart. Soon I will tell you
            where I found these things. I will now put aside reasonings, guesses, the impressive
            hitchings of odds and ends of clues together, and the other showy theatricals of the
            detective trade, and tell you in a plain, straightforward way just how this dismal thing
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1343">He paused a moment, for effect—to allow silence and suspense to intensify and
            concentrate the house's interest; then he went on: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1345">"The assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains. It was a good plan, very
            ingenious, and showed an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. It was a plan which was
            well calculated to ward off all suspicion from its inventor. In the <i>first</i> place, he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart, and lit it and timed
            it. He found it took three hours to burn four inches of it. I tried it myself for half
            an hour, awhile ago, up-stairs here, while the inquiry into Flint Buckner's character
            and ways was being conducted in this room, and I arrived in that way at the rate of a
            candle's consumption when sheltered from the wind. Having proved his trial candle's
            rate, he blew it out—I have already shown it to you—and put <i>his</i> inch-marks on a fresh one. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1353">"He put the fresh one into a tin candlestick. Then at the five-hour mark he bored a
            hole through the candle with a red-hot wire. I have already shown you the wire, with a
            smooth coat of tallow on it—tallow that had been melted and had cooled. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1355">"With labor—very hard labor, I should say—he struggled up through the stiff
            chaparral that clothes the steep hillside back of Flint Buckner's place, tugging an
            empty flour-barrel with him. He placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place, and in
            the bottom of it he set the candlestick. Then he measured off about thirty-five feet of
            fuse—the barrel's distance from the back of the cabin. He bored a hole in the side
            of the barrel—here is the large gimlet he did it with. He went on and finished his
            work; and when it was done, one end of the fuse was in Buckner's cabin, and the other
            end, with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder, was in the hole in the
            candle—timed to blow the place up at one o'clock this morning, provided the candle
            was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening—which I am betting it was—and
            provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the
            fuse—which I am also betting there was, though I can't prove it. Boys, the barrel
            is there in the chaparral, the candle's remains are in it in the tin stick; the
            burnt-out fuse is in the gimlet-hole, the other end is down the hill where the late
            cabin stood. I saw them all an hour or two ago, when the Professor here was measuring
            off unimplicated vacancies and collecting relics that hadn't anything to do with the
            case." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1357">He paused. The house drew a long, deep breath, shook its strained cords and muscles
            free and burst into cheers. "Dang him!" said Ham Sandwich, "that's why he was snooping
            around in the chaparral, instead of picking up points out of the P'fessor's game. Looky
            here—he ain't no fool, boys." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1359">"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1361">But Stillman was resuming: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1363">"While we were out yonder an hour or two ago, the owner of the gimlet and the trial
            candle took them from a place where he had concealed them—it was not a good
            place—and carried them to what he probably thought was a better one, two hundred
            yards up in the pine woods, and hid them there, covering them over with pine needles. It
            was there that I found them. The gimlet exactly fits the hole in the barrel. And
            now—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1365">The Extraordinary Man interrupted him. He said, sarcastically: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1367">"We have had a very pretty fairy tale, gentlemen—very pretty indeed. Now I would
            like to ask this young man a question or two." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1370">Some of the boys winced, and Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1372">"I'm afraid Archy's going to catch it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1374">The others lost their smiles and sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1376">"Let us proceed to examine into this fairy tale in a consecutive and orderly
            way—by geometrical progression, so to speak—linking detail to detail in a
            steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent and unassailable march upon this tinsel
            toy fortress of error, the dream fabric of a callow imagination. To begin with, young
            sir, I desire to ask you but three questions at present—<i>at
              present.</i> Did I understand you to say it was your opinion that the supposititious
            candle was lighted at about eight o'clock yesterday evening?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1381">"Yes, sir—about eight." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1383">"Could you say exactly eight?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1385">"Well, no, I couldn't be that exact." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1387">"Um. If a person had been passing along there just about that time, he would have been
            almost sure to encounter that assassin, do you think?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1389">"Yes, I should think so." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1391">"Thank you, that is all. For the present. I say, all <i>for the
              present."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1396">"Dern him. he's laying for Archy," said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1399">"It's so," said Ham Sandwich. "I don't like the look of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1401">Stillman said, glancing at the guest, "I was along there myself at half-past
            eight—no, about nine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1403">"In-deed? This is interesting—this is very interesting. Perhaps you encountered
            the assassin?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1405">"No, I encountered no one." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1407">"Ah. Then—if you will excuse the remark—I do not quite see the relevancy of
            the information." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1409">"It has none. At present. I say it has none—at present." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1411">He paused. Presently he resumed: "I did not encounter the assassin, but I am on his
            track, I am sure, for I believe he is in this room. I will ask you all to pass one by
            one in front of me—here, where there is a good light—so that I can see your
            feet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1413">A buzz of excitement swept the place, and the march began, the guest looking on with an
            iron attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified success. Stillman stooped, shaded
            his eyes with his hand, and gazed down intently at each pair of feet as it passed. Fifty
            men tramped monotonously by—with no result. Sixty. Seventy. The thing was
            beginning to look absurd. The guest remarked, with suave irony:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1415">"Stillman Accuses Sherlock Holmes"Image of Stillman pointing a finger at Sherlock Holmes</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1421">"Assassins appear to be scarce this evening." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1423">The house saw the humor if it, and refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. Ten or twelve
            more candidates tramped by—no, <i>danced </i>by, with airy and
            ridiculous capers which convulsed the spectators—then suddenly Stillman put out
            his hand and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1429">"This is the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1431">"Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhedrim!" roared the crowd; and at once let fly a
            pyrotechnic explosion and dazzle and confusion of stirring remarks inspired by the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1433">At the height of the turmoil the guest stretched out his hand, commanding peace. The
            authority of a great name and a great personality laid its mysterious compulsion upon
            the house, and it obeyed. Out of the panting calm which succeeded, the guest spoke,
            saying, with dignity and feeling: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1435"><i>"This</i> is serious. It strikes at an innocent life. Innocent
            beyond suspicion! Innocent beyond peradventure! Hear me <i>prove</i> it;
            observe how simple a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie. Listen. My
            friends, that lad was never out of my sight yesterday evening at <i>any</i> time!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1445">It made a deep impression. Men turned their eyes upon Stillman with grave inquiry in
            them. His face brightened, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1447">"I <i>knew</i> there was another one!" He stepped briskly to the table
            and glanced at the guest's feet, then up at his face, and said: "You were <i>with</i> him! You were not fifty steps from him when he lit the candle
            that by and by fired the powder!" <i>(Sensation.) "</i>And what is more,
            you furnished the matches yourself !" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1458">Plainly the guest seemed hit; it looked so to the public. He opened his mouth to speak;
            the words did not come freely. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1460">"This—er—this is insanity—this—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1462">Stillman pressed his evident advantage home. He held up a charred match. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1464">"Here <i>is</i> one of them. I found it in the barrel—and there's
              <i>another</i> one there." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1472">The guest found his voice at once. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1475"><i>"Yes—</i>and put them there yourself!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1479">It was recognized a good shot. Stillman retorted. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1481">"It is <i>wax—</i>a breed unknown to this camp. I am ready to be
            searched for the box. Are you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1486">The guest was staggered this time—the dullest eye could see it. He fumbled with
            his hands; once or twice his lips moved, but the words did not come. The house waited
            and watched, in tense suspense, the stillness adding effect to the situation. Presently
            Stillman said, gently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1488">"We are waiting for your decision." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1490">There was silence again during several moments; then the guest answered, in a low
            voice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1492">"I refuse to be searched." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1494">There was no noisy demonstration, but all about the house one voice after another
            muttered: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1496">"That settles it! He's Archy's meat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1498">What to do now? Nobody seemed to know. It was an embarrassing situation for the
            moment—merely, of course, because matters had taken such a sudden and unexpected
            turn that these unpractised minds were not prepared for it, and had come to a
            standstill, like a stopped clock, under the shock. But after a little the machinery
            began to work again, tentatively, and by twos and threes the men put their heads
            together and privately buzzed over this and that and the other proposition. One of these
            propositions met with much favor; it was, to confer upon the assassin a vote of thanks
            for removing Flint Buckner, and let him go. But the cooler heads opposed it, pointing
            out that addled brains in the Eastern states would pronounce it a scandal, and make no
            end of foolish noise about it. Finally the cool heads got the upper hand, and obtained
            general consent to a proposition of their own; their leader then called the house to
            order and stated it—to this effect: that Fetlock Jones be jailed and put upon
            trial. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1500">The motion was carried. Apparently there was nothing further to do now, and the people
            were glad, for, privately, they were impatient to get out and rush to the scene of the
            tragedy, and see whether that barrel and the other things were really there or not. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1503">But no—the break-up got a check. The surprises were not over yet. For a while
            Fetlock Jones had been silently sobbing, unnoticed in the absorbing excitements which
            had been following one another so persistently for some time; but when his arrest and
            trial were decreed, he broke out despairingly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1505">"No! it's no use. I don't want any jail, I don't want any trial; I've had all the hard
            luck I want, and all the miseries. Hang me now, and let me out! It would all come out,
            anyway—there couldn't anything save me. He has told it all, just as if he'd been
            with me and seen it—<i>I</i> don't know how he found out; and
            you'll find the barrel and things, and then I wouldn't have any chance any more. I
            killed him; and <i>you'd</i> have done it too, if he'd treated you like
            a dog, and you only a boy, and weak and poor, and not a friend to help you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1513">"And served him damned well right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. "Looky here, boys—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1515">From the constable: "Order! Order, gentlemen!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1517">A voice: "Did your uncle know what you was up to?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1519">"No, he didn't." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1521">"Did he give you the matches, sure enough?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1523">"Yes, he did; but he didn't know what I wanted them for." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1525">"When you was out on such a business as that, how did you venture to risk having him
            along—and him a <i>detective?</i> How's that?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1530">The boy hesitated, fumbled with his buttons in an embarrassed way, then said, shyly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1532">"I know about detectives, on account of having them in the family; and if you don't
            want them to find out about a thing, it's best to have them around when you do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1535">The cyclone of laughter which greeted this native discharge of wisdom did not modify
            the poor little waif's embarrassment in any large degree.</p>Chapter IX<p id="TwaDoubd1e1540">From a letter to Mrs. Stillman, dated merely "Tuesday." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1542">Fetlock Jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log cabin, and left there
              to await his trial. Constable Harris provided him with a couple of days' rations,
              instructed him to keep a good guard over himself, and promised to look in on him as
              soon as further supplies should be due. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1545">Next morning a score of us went with Hillyer, out of friendship, and helped him bury
              his late relative, the unlamented Buckner, and I acted as first assistant pall-bearer,
              Hillyer acting as chief. Just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy
              stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, limped by with his head down, and I caught the
              scent I had chased around the globe! It was the odor of Paradise to my perishing hope!
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1548">In a moment I was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder. He
              slumped to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had withered him in his tracks; and
              as the boys came running he struggled to his knees and put up his pleading hands to
              me, and out of his chattering jaws he begged me to persecute him no more, and said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1551">"You have hunted me around the world, Sherlock Holmes, yet God is my witness I have
              never done any man harm!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1554">A glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane. That was my work, mother!
              The tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery I felt in that moment, but
              nothing else can ever do it. The boys lifted him up, and gathered about him, and were
              full of pity of him, and said the gentlest and touchingest things to him, and said
              cheer up and don't be troubled, he was among friends now, and they would take care of
              him, and protect him, and hang any man that laid a hand on him. They are just like so
              many mothers, the rough mining-camp boys are, when you wake up the south side of their
              hearts; yes, and just like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up
              the opposite of that muscle. They did everything they could think of to comfort him,
              but nothing succeeded until Wells-Fargo Ferguson, who is a clever strategist, said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1557">"If it's only Sherlock Holmes that's troubling you, you needn't worry any more."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1560">"Why?" asked the forlorn lunatic, eagerly. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1563">"Because he's dead again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1566">"Dead! Dead! Oh, don't trifle with a poor wreck like me. <i>Is
              </i>he dead? On honor, now—is he telling me true, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1573">"True as you're standing there!" said Ham Sandwich, and they all backed up the
              statement in a body. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1576">"They hung him in San Bernardino last week," added Ferguson, clinching the matter,
              "whilst he was searching around after you. Mistook him for another man. They're sorry,
              but they can't help it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1579">"They're a-building him a monument," said Ham Sandwich, with the air of a person who
              had contributed to it, and knew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1582">"James Walker" drew a deep sigh—evidently a sigh of relief—and said
              nothing; but his eyes lost something of their wildness, his countenance cleared
              visibly, and its drawn look relaxed a little. We all went to our cabin, and the boys
              cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for, and while they
              were about it Hillyer and I outfitted him from hat to shoe-leather with new clothes of
              ours, and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him. "Old" is the right word,
              and a pity, too: old by the droop of him, and the frost upon his hair, and the marks
              which sorrow and distress have left upon his face; though he is only in his prime in
              the matter of years. While he ate, we smoked and chatted; and when he was finishing he
              found his voice at last, and of his own accord broke out with his personal history. I
              cannot furnish his exact words, but I will come as near it as I can. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1585">THE "WRONG MAN'S" STORY </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1588">It happened like this: I was in Denver. I had been there many years; sometimes I
              remember how many, sometimes I don't—but it isn't any matter. All of a sudden I
              got a notice to leave, or I would be exposed for a horrible crime committed long
              before—years and years before—in the East. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1591">I knew about that crime, but I was not the criminal; it was a cousin of mine of the
              same name. What should I better do? My head was all disordered by fear, and I didn't
              know. I was allowed very little time—only one day, I think it was. I would be
              ruined if I was published, and the people would lynch me, and not believe what I said.
              It is always the way with lynchings: when they find out it is a mistake they are
              sorry, but it is too late—the same as it was with Mr. Holmes, you see. So I said
              I would sell out and get money to live on, and run away until it blew over and I could
              come back with my proofs. Then I escaped in the night and went a long way off in the
              mountains somewhere, and lived disguised and had a false name. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1594">I got more and more troubled and worried, and my troubles made me see spirits and
              hear voices, and I could not think straight and clear on any subject, but got confused
              and involved and had to give it up, because my head hurt so. It got to be worse and
              worse; more spirits and more voices. They were about me all the time; at first only in
              the night, then in the day too. They were always whispering around my bed and plotting
              against me, and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out, because I got no good rest.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1597">And then came the worst. One night the whispers said, "We'll never manage, because
              we can't <i>see</i> him, and so can't point him out to the people."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1603">They sighed; then one said: "We must bring Sherlock Holmes. He can be here in twelve
              days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1606">They all agreed, and whispered and jibbered with joy. But my heart broke; for I had
              read about that man, and knew what it would be to have him upon my track, with his
              superhuman penetration and tireless energies. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1610">The spirits went away to fetch him, and I got up at once in the middle of the night
              and fled away, carrying nothing but the hand-bag that had my money in it—thirty
              thousand dollars; two-thirds of it are in the bag there yet. It was forty days before
              that man caught up on my track. I just escaped. From habit he had written his real
              name on a tavern register, but had scratched it out and written "Dagget Barclay" in
              the place of it. But fear gives you a watchful eye and keen, and I read the true name
              through the scratches, and fled like a deer. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1613">He has hunted me all over this world for three years and a half—the Pacific
              states, Australasia, India—everywhere you can think of; then back to Mexico and
              up to California again, giving me hardly any rest; but that name on the registers
              always saved me, and what is left of me is alive yet. And I am <i>so</i> tired! A cruel time he has given me, yet I give you my honor I have never
              harmed him nor any man. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1619">That was the end of the story, and it stirred those boys to bloodheat, he sure of
              it. As for me—each word burnt a hole in me where it struck. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1622">We voted that the old man should bunk with us, and be my guest and Hillyer's. I
              shall keep my own counsel, naturally; but as soon as he is well rested and nourished,
              I shall take him to Denver and rehabilitate his fortunes. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1625">The boys gave the old fellow the bone-smashing good-fellowship handshake of the
              mines, and then scattered away to spread the news. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1628">At dawn next morning Wells-Fargo Ferguson and Ham Sandwich called us softly out, and
              said, privately: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1631">"That news about the way that old stranger has been treated has spread all around,
              and the camps are up. They are piling in from everywhere, and are going to lynch the
              P'fessor. Constable Harris is in a dead funk, and has telephoned the sheriff. Come
              along!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1634">We started on a run. The others were privileged to feel as they chose, but in my
              heart's privacy I hoped the sheriff would arrive in time; for I had small desire that
              Sherlock Holmes should hang for my deeds, as you can easily believe. I had heard a
              good deal about the sheriff, but </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1637">for reassurance's sake I asked: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1640">"Can he stop a mob?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1643">"Can <i>he</i> stop a mob! Can Jack <i>Fairfax</i>
              stop a mob! Well, I should smile! Ex-desperado—nineteen scalps on his string.
              Can <i>he!</i> Oh, I <i>say!"</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1659">As we tore up the gulch, distant cries and shouts and yells rose faintly on the
              still air, and grew steadily in strength as we raced along. Roar after roar burst out,
              stronger and stronger, nearer and nearer; and at last, when we closed up upon the
              multitude massed in the open area in front of the tavern, the crash of sound was
              deafening. Some brutal roughs from Daly's gorge had Holmes in their grip, and he was
              the calmest man there; a contemptuous smile played about his lips, and if any fear of
              death was in his British heart, his iron personality was master of it and no sign of
              it was allowed to appear. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1662">"Come to a vote, men!" This from one of the Daly gang, Shadbelly Higgins. "Quick! is
              it hang, or shoot?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1665">"Neither!" shouted one of his comrades. "He'll he alive again in a week; burning's
              the only permanency for <i>him."</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1671">The gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a thundercrash of approval, and
              went struggling and surging toward the prisoner, and closed around him, shouting,
              "Fire! fire's the ticket!" They dragged him to the horse-post, backed him against it,
              chained him to it, and piled wood and pine cones around him waist-deep. Still the
              strong face did not blench, and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1674">"A match! fetch a match!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1677">Shadbelly struck it, shaded it with his hand, stooped, and held it under a pine
              cone. A deep silence fell upon the mob. The cone caught, a tiny flame flickered about
              it a moment or two. I seemed to catch the sound of distant hoofs—it grew more
              distinct—still more and more distinct, more and more definite, but the absorbed
              crowd did not appear to notice it. The match went out. The man struck another,
              stooped, and again the flame rose; this time it took hold and began to
              spread—here and there men turned away their faces. The executioner stood with
              the charred match in his fingers, watching his work. The hoof-beats turned a
              projecting crag, and now they came thundering down upon us. Almost the next moment
              there was a shout: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1680">"The sheriff!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1683">And straightway he came tearing into the midst, stood his horse almost on his hind
              feet, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1686">"Fall back, you gutter-snipes!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1689">He was obeyed. By all but their leader. He stood his ground, and his hand went to
              his revolver. The sheriff covered him promptly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1692">"Drop your hand, you parlor desperado. Kick the fire away. Now unchain the
              stranger." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1696">The parlor desperado obeyed. Then the sheriff made a speech; sitting his horse at
              martial ease, and not warming his words with any touch of fire, but delivering them in
              a measured and deliberate way, and in a tone which harmonized with their character and
              made them impressively disrespectful. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1699">"You're a nice lot—now ain't you? Just about eligible to travel with this bilk
              here—Shadbelly Higgins—this loud-mouthed sneak that shoots people in the
              back and calls himself a desperado. If there's anything I do particularly despise,
              it's a lynching mob; I've never seen one that had a man in it. It has to tally up a
              hundred against one before it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor. It's
              made up of cowards, and so is the community that breeds it; and ninety-nine times out
              of a hundred the sheriff's another one." He paused—apparently to turn that last
              idea over in his mind and taste the juice of it—then he went on: "The sheriff
              that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the lowest-down coward there is. By
              the statistics there was a hundred and eighty-two of them drawing sneak pay in America
              last year. By the way it's going, pretty soon there 'll be a new disease in the
                doctor-books—<i>sheriff complaint."</i> That idea pleased
              him—any one could see it. "People will say, 'Sheriff sick again?' 'Yes; got the
              same old thing.' And next there 'll be a new title. People won't say, 'He's running
              for sheriff of Rapaho County,' for instance; they'll say, 'He's running for Coward of
              Rapaho.' Lord, the idea of a grown-up person being afraid of a lynch mob!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1705">He turned an eye on the captive, and said, "Stranger, who are you, and what have you
              been doing?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1708">"My name is Sherlock Holmes, and I have not been doing anything." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1711">It was wonderful, the impression which the sound of that name made on the sheriff,
              notwithstanding he must have come posted. He spoke up with feeling, and said it was a
              blot on the county that a man whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their
              fame and their ingenuity, and whose histories of them had won every reader's heart by
              the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting, should be visited under the Stars
              and Stripes by an outrage like this. He apologized in the name of the whole nation,
              and made Holmes a most handsome bow, and told Constable Harris to see him to his
              quarters, and hold himself personally responsible if he was molested again. Then he
              turned to the mob and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1714">"Hunt your holes, you scum!" which they did; then he said: "Follow me, Shadbelly;
              I'll take care of your case myself. No—keep your popgun; whenever I see the day
              that I'll be afraid to have you behind me with that thing, it 'll be time for me to
              join last year's hundred and eighty-two"; and he rode off in a walk, Shadbelly
              following. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1717">When we were on our way back to our cabin, toward breakfast-time, we ran upon the
              news that Fetlock Jones had escaped from his lock-up in the night and is gone! Nobody
              is sorry. Let his uncle track him out if he likes; it is in his line; the camp is not
              interested.</p>Chapter X<p id="TwaDoubd1e1723"><i>Ten days later.</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1728">"James Walker" is all right in body now, and his mind shows improvement too. I start
              with him for Denver to-morrow morning. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1731"><i>Next night. Brief note, mailed at a way-station.</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1736">As we were starting, this morning, Hillyer whispered to me: "Keep this news from

              day—the unhappiest man that has lived in a century—Flint Buckner. His real
              name was Jacob Fuller!" There, mother, by help of me, an unwitting mourner, your
              husband and my father is in his grave.

There has been a
            wedding, between a handsome young man of slender means and a rich young girl—a
            case of love at first sight and a precipitate marriage; a marriage bitterly opposed by
            the girl's widowed father. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e140">Jacob Fuller, the bridegroom, is twenty-six years old, is of an old but unconsidered
            family which had by compulsion emigrated from Sedgemoor, and for King James's purse's
            profit, so everybody said—some maliciously the rest merely because they believed
            it. The bride is nineteen and beautiful. She is intense, high-strung, romantic,
            immeasurably proud of her Cavalier blood, and passionate in her love for her young
            husband. For its sake she braved her father's displeasure, endured his reproaches,
            listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions and went from his house
            without his blessing, proud and happy in the proofs she was thus giving of the quality
            of the affection which had made its home in her heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e142">The morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her. Her husband put aside
            her proffered caresses, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e144">"Sit down. I have something to say to you. I loved you. That was before I asked your
            father to give you to me. His refusal is not my grievance—I could have endured
            that. But the things he said of me to you—that is a different matter.
            There—you needn't speak; I know quite well what they were; I got them from
            authentic sources. Among other things he said that my character was written in my face;
            that I was treacherous, a dissembler, a coward, and a brute without sense of pity or
            compassion: the 'Sedgemoor trade-mark,' he called it—and 'white-sleeve badge.' Any
            other man in my place would have gone to his house and shot him down like a dog. I
            wanted to do it, and was minded to do it, but a better thought came to me: to put him to
            shame; to break his heart; to kill him by inches. How to do it? Through my treatment of
            you, his idol! I would marry you; and then—Have patience. You will see. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e146">From that moment onward, for three months, the young wife suffered all the
            humiliations, all the insults, all the miseries that the diligent and inventive mind of
            the husband could contrive, save physical injuries only. Her strong pride stood by her,
            and she kept the secret of her troubles. Now and then the husband said, "Why don't you
            go to your father and tell him?" Then he invented new tortures, applied them, and asked
            again. She always answered, "He shall never know by my mouth," and taunted him with his
            origin; said she was the lawful slave of a scion of slaves, and must obey, and
            would—up to that point, but no further; he could kill her if he liked, but he
            could not break her; it was not in the Sedgemoor breed to do it. At the end of the three
            months he said, with a dark significance in his manner, "I have tried all things but
            one"—and waited for her reply. "Try that," she said, and curled her lip in
            mockery. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e148">That night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes, then said to her: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e150">"Get up and dress!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e152">She obeyed—as always, without a word. He led her half a mile from the house, and
            proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public road; and succeeded, she
            screaming and struggling. He gagged her then, struck her across the face with his
            cowhide, and set his bloodhounds on her. They tore the clothes off her, and she was
            naked. He called the dogs off, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e154">"You will be found—by the passing public. They will be dropping along about three
            hours from now, and will spread the news—do you hear? Good-by. You have seen the
            last of me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e156">He went away then. She moaned to herself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e159">"I shall bear a child—to <i>him!</i> God grant it may be a boy!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e164">The farmers released her by and by—and spread the news, which was natural. They
            raised the country with lynching intentions, but the bird had flown. The young wife shut
            herself up in her father's house; he shut himself up with her, and thenceforth would see
            no one. His pride was broken, and his heart; so he wasted away, day by day, and even his
            daughter rejoiced when death relieved him. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e166">Then she sold the estate and disappeared.</p>Chapter 2<p id="TwaDoubd1e171">In 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded New England village,
            with no company but a little boy about five years old. She did her own work, she
            discouraged acquaintanceships, and had none. The butcher, the baker, and the others that
            served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was
            Stillman, and that she called the child Archy. Whence she came they had not been able to
            find out, but they said she talked like a Southerner. The child had no playmates and no
            comrade, and no teacher but the mother. She taught him diligently and intelligently, and
            was satisfied with the results—even a little proud of them. One day Archy said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e173">"Mamma, am I different from other children?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e175">"Well, I suppose not. Why?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e177">"There was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had been by and I
            said yes, and she said how long since I saw him and I said I hadn't seen him at all, and
            she said how did I know he'd been by, then, and I said because I smelt his track on the
            sidewalk, and she said I was a dum fool and made a mouth at me. What did she do that
            for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e179">The young woman turned white, and said to herself, "It's a birth mark! The gift of the
            bloodhound is in him." She snatched the boy to her breast and hugged him passionately,
            saying, "God has appointed the way!" Her eyes were burning with a fierce light, and her
            breath came short and quick with excitement. She said to herself: "The puzzle is solved
            now; many a time it has been a mystery to me, the impossible things the child has done
            in the dark, but it is all clear to me now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e181">She set him in his small chair, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e183">"Wait a little till I come, dear; then we will talk about the matter." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e185">She went up to her room and took from her dressing-table several small articles and put
            them out of sight: a nail-file on the floor under the bed; a pair of nail-scissors under
            the bureau; a small ivory paper-knife under the wardrobe. Then she returned, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e187">"There! I have left some things which I ought to have brought down." She named them,
            and said, "Run up and bring them, dear." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e189">The child hurried away on his errand and was soon back again with the things. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e192">"Did you have any difficulty, dear?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e194">"No, mamma; I only went where you went." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e196">During his absence she had stepped to the bookcase, taken several books from the bottom
            shelf, opened each, passed her hand over a page, noting its number in her memory, then
            restored them to their places. Now she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e198">"I have been doing something while you have been gone, Archy. Do you think you can find
            out what it was?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e200">The boy went to the bookcase and got out the books that had been touched, and opened
            them at the pages which had been stroked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e202">The mother took him in her lap, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e204">"I will answer your question now, dear. I have found out that in one way you are quite
            different from other people. You can see in the dark, you can smell what other people
            cannot, you have the talents of a bloodhound. They are good and valuable things to have,
            but you must keep the matter a secret. If people found it out, they would speak of you
            as an odd child, a strange child, and children would be disagreeable to you, and give
            you nicknames. In this world one must be like everybody else if he doesn't want to
            provoke scorn or envy or jealousy. It is a great and fine distinction which has been
            born to you, and I am glad; but you will keep it a secret, for mamma's sake, won't you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e206">The child promised, without understanding. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e208">All the rest of the day the mother's brain was busy with excited thinkings; with plans,
            projects, schemes, each and all of them uncanny, grim, and dark. Yet they lit up her
            face; lit it with a fell light of their own; lit it with vague fires of hell. She was in
            a fever of unrest; she could not sit, stand, read, sew; there was no relief for her but
            in movement. She tested her boy's gift in twenty ways, and kept saying to herself all
            the time, with her mind in the past: "He broke my father's heart, and night and day all
            these years I have tried, and all in vain, to think out a way to break his. I have found
            it now—I have found it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e210">When night fell, the demon of unrest still possessed her. She went on with her tests;
            with a candle she traversed the house from garret to cellar, hiding pins, needles,
            thimbles, spools, under pillows, under carpets, in cracks in the walls, under the coal
            in the bin; then sent the little fellow in the dark to find them; which he did, and was
            happy and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e212">From this time forward life took on a new complexion for her. She said, "The future is
            secure—I can wait, and enjoy the waiting." The most of her lost interests revived.
            She took up music again, and languages, drawing, painting, and the other long-discarded
            delights of her maidenhood. She was happy once more, and felt again the zest of life. As
            the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy, and was contented with it.
            Not altogether, but nearly that. The soft side of his heart was larger than the other
            side of it. It was his only defect, in her eyes. But she considered that his love for
            her and worship of her made up for it. He was a good hater—that was well; but it
            was a question if the materials of his hatreds were of as tough and enduring a quality
            as those of his friendships—and that was not so well. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e215">The years drifted on. Archy was become a handsome, shapely, athletic youth, courteous,
            dignified, companionable, pleasant in his ways, and looking perhaps a trifle older than
            he was, which was sixteen. One evening his mother said she had something of grave
            importance to say to him, adding that he was old enough to hear it now, and old enough
            and possessed of character enough and stability enough to carry out a stern plan which
            she had been for years contriving and maturing. Then she told him her bitter story, in
            all its naked atrociousness. For a while the boy was paralyzed; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e217">"I understand. We are Southerners; and by our custom and nature there is but one
            atonement. I will search him out and kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e219">"Kill him? No! Death is release, emancipation; death is a favor. Do I owe him favors?
            You must not hurt a hair of his head." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e221">The boy was lost in thought awhile; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e223">"You are all the world to me, and your desire is my law and my pleasure. Tell me what
            to do and I will do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e225">The mother's eyes beamed with satisfaction, and she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e227">"You will go and find him. I have known his hiding-place for eleven years; it cost me
            five years and more of inquiry, and much money, to locate it. He is a quartz-miner in
            Colorado, and well-to-do. He lives in Denver. His name is Jacob Fuller. There—it
            is the first time I have spoken it since that unforgettable night. Think! That name
            could have been yours if I had not saved you that shame and furnished you a cleaner one.
            You will drive him from that place; you will hunt him down and drive him again; and yet
            again, and again, and again, persistently, relentlessly, poisoning his life, filling it
            with mysterious terrors, loading it with weariness and misery, making him wish for
            death, and that he had a suicide's courage; you will make of him another Wandering Jew;
            he shall know no rest any more, no peace of mind, no placid sleep; you shall shadow him,
            cling to him, persecute him, till you break his heart, as he broke my father's and
            mine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e229">"I will obey, mother." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e231">"I believe it, my child. The preparations are all made; everything is ready. Here is a
            letter of credit; spend freely, there is no lack of money. At times you may need
            disguises. I have provided them; also some other conveniences." She took from the drawer
            of the typewriter-table several squares of paper. They all bore these typewritten
            words:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e233"><i>$10,000 REWARD</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e237"><i>It is believed that a certain man who is wanted in an Eastern

                clothes from her, leaving her naked. He left her there, and fled the country. A

            night and placard one of these upon the building he occupies, and another one upon the
            post-office or in some other prominent place. It will be the talk of the region. At
            first you must give him several days in which to force a sale of his belongings at
            something approaching their value. We will ruin him by and by, but gradually; we must
            not impoverish him at once, for that could bring him to despair and injure his health,
            possibly kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e244">She took three or four more typewritten forms from the
            drawer—duplicates—and read one:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e246">. . . . . . . . . ., . . . . . . . . . ., 18. . . .</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e249"><i>To Jacob Fuller:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e253"><i>You have . . . . . . days in which to settle your affairs. You

                Fuller. I have his scent; I could track him through ten divisions of infantry and
                find him. I have often been near him and heard him talk. He owns a good mine, and
                has a fair income from it; but he is not rich. He learned mining in a good
                way—by working at it for wages. He is a cheerful creature, and his forty-three
                years sit lightly upon him; he could pass for a younger man—say thirty-six or
                thirty-seven. He has never married again—passes himself off for a widower. He
                stands well, is liked, is popular, and has many friends. Even I feel a drawing
                toward him—the paternal blood in me making its claim. How blind and
                unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature—the most of them, in
                fact! My task is become hard now—you realize it? you comprehend, and make
                allowances?—and the fire of it has cooled, more than I like to confess to
                myself, But I will carry it out. Even with the pleasure paled, the duty remains, and
                I will not spare him.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e286"><i>And for my help, a sharp resentment rises in me when I reflect
                that he who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not suffered by it.
                The lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character, and in the change he is
                happy. He, the guilty party, is absolved from all suffering; you, the innocent, are
                borne down with it. But be comforted—he shall harvest his share.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e290">SILVER GULCH, <i>May 19</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e295"><i>I placarded Form No. 1 at midnight of April 3; an hour later I
                slipped Form No. 2 under his chamber door, notifying him to leave Denver at or
                before 11.50 the night of the 14th.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e299"><i>Some late bird of a reporter stole one of my placards, then hunted
                the town over and found the other one, and stole that. In this manner he
                accomplished what the profession call a "scoop"—that is, he got a valuable
                item, and saw to it that no other paper got it. And so his paper—the principal
                one in the town—had it in glaring type on the editorial page in the morning,
                followed by a Vesuvian opinion of our wretch a column long, which wound up by adding
                a thousand dollars to our reward on the paper's account! The journals out here know
                how to do the noble thing—when there's business in it.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e303"><i>At breakfast I occupied my usual seat—selected because it
                afforded a view of papa Fuller's face, and was near enough for me to hear the talk
                that went on at his table. Seventy-five or a hundred people were in the room, and
                all discussing that item, and saying they hoped the seeker would find that rascal
                and remove the pollution of his presence from the town—with a rail, or a
                bullet, or something.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e307"><i>When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leave—folded
                up—in one hand, and the newspaper in the other; and it gave me more than half
                a pang to see him. His cheerfulness was all gone, and he looked old and pinched and
                ashy. And then—only think of the things he had to listen to! Mamma, he heard
                his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and characterizations drawn
                from the very dictionaries and phrase-books of Satan's own authorized editions down
                below. And more than that, he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them. His
                applause tasted bitter in his mouth, though; he could not disguise that from me; and
                it was observable that his appetite was gone; he only nibbled; he couldn't eat.
                Finally a man said:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e311"><i>"It is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing
                what this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel. I hope so."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e316"><i>Ah, dear, it was pitiful the way Fuller winced, and glanced around
                scared! He couldn't endure any more, and got up and left.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e320"><i>During several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in
                Mexico, and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could, and give the
                property his personal attention. He played his cards well; said he would take
                $40,000—a quarter in cash, the rest in safe notes; but that as he greatly
                needed money on account of his new purchase, he would diminish his terms for cash in
                full, He sold out for $30,000. And then, what do you think he did? He asked for
                greenbacks, and took them, saying the man in Mexico was a New-Englander, with a head
                full of crotchets, and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts. People thought it
                queer, since a draft on New York could produce greenbacks quite conveniently. There
                was talk of this odd thing, but only for a day; that is as long as any topic lasts
                in Denver.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e324"><i>I was watching, all the time. As soon as the sale was completed
                and the money paid—which was on the 11th—I began to stick to Fuller's
                track without dropping it for a moment. That night—no, 12th, for it was a
                little past midnight—I tracked him to his room, which was four doors from mine
                in the same hall; then I went back and put on my muddy day-laborer disguise,
                darkened my complexion, and sat down in my room in the gloom, with a gripsack handy,
                with a change in it, and my door ajar. For I suspected that the bird would take wing
                now. In half an hour an old woman passed by, carrying a grip: I caught the familiar
                whiff, and followed with my grip, for it was Fuller. He left the hotel by a side
                entrance, and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three
                blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness, and got into a two-horse hack, which of
                course was waiting for him by appointment. I took a seat (uninvited) on the trunk
                platform behind, and we drove briskly off. We drove ten miles, and the hack stopped
                at a way-station and was discharged. Fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow
                under the awning, as far as he could get from the light; I went inside, and watched
                the ticket-office. Fuller bought no ticket; I bought none. Presently the train came
                along, and he boarded a car; I entered the same car at the other end, and came down
                the aisle and took the seat behind him. When he paid the conductor and named his
                objective point, I dropped back several seats, while the conductor was changing a
                bill, and when he came to me I paid to the same place—about a hundred miles
                westward.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e328"><i>From that time for a week on end he led me a dance. He traveled
                here and there and yonder—always on a general westward trend—but he boas
                not a woman after the first day. He was a laborer, like myself, and wore bushy false
                whiskers. His outfit was perfect, and he could do the character without thinking
                about it, for he had served the trade for wages. His nearest friend could not have
                recognized him. At last he located himself here, the obscurest little mountain camp
                in Montana; he has a shanty, and goes out prospecting daily; is gone all day, and
                avoids society. I am living at a miner's boardinghouse, and it is an awful place:
                the bunks, the food, the dirt—everything.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e332"><i>We have been here four weeks, and in that time I have seen him but
                once; but every night I go over his track and post myself. As soon as he engaged a
                shanty here I went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed that Denver hotel to
                keep my baggage till I should send for it. I need nothing here but a change of army
                shirts, and I brought that with me.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e336">SILVER GULCH, <i>June 12</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e341"><i>The Denver episode has never found its way here, I think. I know
                the most of the men in camp, and they have never referred to it, at least in my
                hearing. Fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions. He has located a
                claim, two miles away, in an out-of-the-way place in the mountains; it promises very
                well, and he is working it diligently. Ah, but the change in him! He never smiles,
                and he keeps quite to himself, consorting with no one—he who was so fond of
                company and so cheery only two months ago. I have seen him passing along several
                times recently—drooping, forlorn, the spring gone from his step, a pathetic
                figure. He calls himself David Wilson.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e345"><i>I can trust him to remain here until we disturb him. Since you
                insist, I will banish him again, but I do not see how he can be unhappier than he
                already is. I will go hack to Denver and treat myself to a little season of comfort,
                and edible food, and endurable beds, and bodily decency; then I will fetch my

                than the other one; he came here a young widower in '79, aged twenty-one—a
                year before you were married; and the documents to prove it are innumerable. Last
                night I talked with familiar friends of his who have known him from the day of his
                arrival. I said nothing, but a few days from now I will land him in this town again,
                with the loss upon his mine made good; and there will be a banquet, and a
                torch-light procession, and there will not be any expense on anybody but me. Do you

                to-night, in a wagon—two or three hours of that, then I get a train. I don't
                know where I'm going, but I must go; to try to keep still would be

                advertise for him. But if there is any way to do it that would not frighten him, I
                have not been able to think it out, and I have tried till my brains are addled. "If
                the gentleman who lately bought a mine in Mexico and sold one in Denver will send
                his address to" (to whom, mother!), "it will be explained to him that it was all a
                mistake; his forgiveness will be asked, and full reparation made for a loss which he
                sustained in a certain matter." Do you see? He would think it a trap. Well, any one
                would. If I should say, "It is now known that he was not the man wanted, but another
                man—a man who once bore the same name, but discarded it for good
                reasons"—would that answer? But the Denver people would wake up then and say
                "Oho!" and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks, and say, "Why did he
                run away if he wasn't the right man?—it is too thin." If I failed to find him
                he would be ruined there—there where there is no taint upon him now. You have

                to the Pacific, and how nearly I came to getting him once. Well, I have had another
                close miss. It was here, yesterday. I struck his trail,</i> hot, <i>on the street, and followed it on a run to a cheap hotel. That was a costly
                mistake; a dog would have gone the other way. But I am only part dog, and can get
                very humanly stupid when excited. He had been stopping in that house ten days; I
                almost know, now, that he stops long nowhere, the past six or eight months, but is
                restless and has to keep moving. I understand that feeling! and I know what it is to
                feel it. He still uses the name he had registered when I came so near catching him
                nine months ago—"James Walker"; doubtless the same he adopted when he fled
                from Silver Gulch. An unpretending man, and has small taste for fancy names. I
                recognized the hand easily, through its slight disguise. A square man, and not good
                at shams and pretenses.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e428"><i>They said he was just gone, on a journey; left no address; didn't
                say where he was going; looked frightened when asked to leave his address; had no
                baggage but a cheap valise; carried it off on foot—a "stingy old person, and
                not much loss to the house." "</i>Old!" <i>I suppose he is, now I
                hardly heard; I was there but a moment. I rushed along his trail, and it led me to a
                wharf. Mother, the smoke of the steamer he had taken was just fading out on the
                horizon! I should have saved half on hour if I had gone in the right direction at
                first. I could have taken a fast tug, and should have stood a chance of catching
                that vessel. She is bound for Melbourne.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e436">HOPE CAÑON, CALIFORNIA, <i>October 3, 1900 </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e441"><i>You have a right to complain. "A letter a year"</i> is <i>a paucity; I freely acknowledge it; but how can one write when there

                first of last January down to a month ago. I feel almost sure he is not far from
                Hope Cañon; I traced him to a point thirty miles from here, but there I lost
                the trail; some one gave him a lift in a wagon, I suppose. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e463"><i>I am taking a rest, now—modified by searchings for the lost
                trail. I was tired to death, mother, and low-spirited, and sometimes coming
                uncomfortably near to losing hope; but the miners in this little camp are good
                fellows, and I am used to their sort this long time back; and their breezy ways
                freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles. I have been here a month. I am
                cabining with a young fellow named "Sammy" Hillyer, about twenty-five, the only son
                of his mother—like me—and loves her dearly, and writes to her every
                week—part of which is like me. He is a timid body, and in the matter of
                intellect—well, he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire; but no
                matter, he is well liked; he is good and fine, and it is meat and bread and rest and
                luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again. I wish "James Walker"
                could have it. He had friends; he liked company. That brings up that picture of him,
                the time that I saw him last. The pathos of it! It comes before me often and often.
                At that very time, poor thing, I was girding up my conscience to make him move on
                again!</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e467"><i>Hillyer's heart is better than mine, better than anybody's in the
                community, I suppose, for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the
                camp—Flint Buckner—and the only man Flint ever talks with or allows to
                talk with him. He says he knows Flint's history, and that it is trouble that has
                made him what he is, and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can. Now
                none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a lodger like Flint
                Buckner, from all I hear about him outside. I think that this one detail will give
                you a better idea of Sammy's character than any labored-out description I could
                furnish you of him. In one of our talks he said something about like this: "Flint is
                a kinsman of mine, and he pours out all his troubles to me—empties his breast
                from time to time, or I reckon it would burst. There couldn't be any unhappier man,
                Archy Stillman; his life had been made up of misery of mind—he isn't near as
                old as he looks. He has lost the feel of reposefulness and peace—oh, years and
                years ago! He doesn't know what good luck is—never has had any; often says he
                wishes he was in the other hell, he is so tired of this one."</i></p>Chapter IV<p id="TwaDoubd1e474"><i>No real gentleman will tell the naked truth in the presence of
              ladies.</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e478">It was a crisp and spicy morning in early October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with
            the glory-fires of autumn, hung burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge
            provided by kind Nature for the wingless wild things that have their homes in the
            tree-tops and would visit together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and
            yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the
            sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere;
            far in he empty sky a solitary esophagus[1] slept upon motionless
            wing; everywhere brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e483">October is the time—1900; Hope Cañon is the place, a silver-mining camp
            away down in the Esmeralda region. It is a secluded spot, high and remote; recent as to
            discovery; thought by its occupants to be rich in metal—a year or two's
            prospecting will decide that matter one way or the other. For inhabitants, the camp has
            about two hundred miners, one white woman and child, several Chinese washermen, five
            squaws, and a dozen vagrant buck Indians in rabbit-skin robes, battered plug hats, and
            tin-can necklaces. There are no mills as yet; no church, no newspaper. The camp has
            existed but two years; it has made no big strike; the world is ignorant of its name and
            place. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e485">On both sides of the cañon the mountains rise wall-like, three thousand feet,
            and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the
            sun only once a day, when he sails over at noon. The village is a couple of miles long;
            the cabins stand well apart from each other. The tavern is the only "frame"
            house—the only house, one might say. It occupies a central position, and is the
            evening resort of the population. They drink there, and play seven-up and dominoes; also
            billiards, for there is a table, crossed all over with torn places repaired with
            court-plaster; there are some cues, but no leathers; some chipped balls which clatter
            when they run, and do not slow up gradually, but stop suddenly and sit down; there is a
            part of a cube of chalk, with a projecting jag of flint in it; and the man who can score
            six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bar's expense. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e487">Flint Buckner's cabin was the last one of the village, going south; his silver-claim
            was at the other end of the village, northward, and a little beyond the last hut in that
            direction. He was a sour creature, unsociable, and had no companionships. People who had
            tried to get acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him. His history was not
            known. Some believed that Sammy Hillyer knew it; others said no. If asked, Hillyer said
            no, he was not acquainted with it. Flint had a meek English youth of sixteen or
            seventeen with him, whom he treated roughly, both in public and in private; and of
            course this lad was applied to for information, but with no success. Fetlock
            Jones—name of the youth—said that Flint picked him up on a prospecting
            tramp, and as he had neither home nor friends in America, he had found it wise to stay
            and take Buckner's hard usage for the sake of the salary, which was bacon and beans.
            Further than this he could offer no testimony. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e489">Fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now, and under his meek exterior he was
            slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and humiliations which his master had put
            upon him. For the meek suffer bitterly from these hurts; more bitterly, perhaps, than do
            the manlier sort, who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the limit of
            endurance has been reached. Good-hearted people wanted to help Fetlock out of his
            trouble, and tried to get him to leave Buckner; but the boy showed fright at the
            thought, and said he "dasn't." Pat Riley urged him, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e491">"You leave the damned hunks and come with me; don't you be afraid. I'll take care of
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e496">The boy thanked him with tears in his eyes, but shuddered and said he "dasn't risk it";
            he said Flint would catch him alone, some time, in the night, and then—"Oh, it
            makes me sick, Mr. Riley, to think of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e498">Others said, "Run away from him; we'll stake you; skip out for the coast some night."
            But all these suggestions failed; he said Flint would hunt him down and fetch him back,
            just for meanness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e500">The people could not understand this. The boy's miseries went steadily on, week after
            week. It is quite likely that the people would have understood if they had known how he
            was employing his spare time. He slept in an out-cabin near Flint's; and there, nights,
            he nursed his bruises and his humiliations, and studied and studied over a single
            problem—how he could murder Flint Buckner and not be found out. It was the only
            joy he had in life; these hours were the only ones in the twenty-four which he looked
            forward to with eagerness and spent in happiness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e503">He thought of poison. No—that would not serve; the inquest would reveal where it
            was procured and who had procured it. He thought of a shot in the back in a lonely place
            when Flint would be homeward bound at midnight—his unvarying hour for the trip.
            No—somebody might be near, and catch him. He thought of stabbing him in his sleep.
            No—he might strike an inefficient blow, and Flint would seize him. He examined a
            hundred different ways—none of them would answer; for in even the very obscurest
            and secretest of them there was always the fatal defect of a <i>risk,</i> a chance, a possibility that he might be found out. He would have none of
            that. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e508">But he was patient, endlessly patient. There was no hurry, he said to himself. He would
            never leave Flint till he left him a corpse; there was no hurry—he would find the
            way. It was somewhere, and he would endure shame and pain and misery until he found it.
            Yes, somewhere there was a way which would leave not a trace, not even the faintest clue
            to the murderer—there was no hurry—he would find that way, and
            then—oh, then, it would just be good to be alive! Meantime he would diligently
            keep up his reputation for meekness; and also, as always theretofore, he would allow no
            one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about his oppressor. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e510">Two days before the before-mentioned October morning Flint had bought some things, and
            he and Fetlock had brought them home to Flint's cabin: a fresh box of candles, which
            they put in the corner; a tin can of blasting-powder, which they placed upon the
            candle-box; a keg of blasting-powder, which they placed under Flint's bunk; a huge coil
            of fuse, which they hung on a peg. Fetlock reasoned that Flint's mining operations had
            outgrown the pick, and that blasting was about to begin now. He had seen blasting done,
            and he had a notion of the process, but he had never helped in it. His conjecture was
            right—blasting-time had come. In the morning the pair carried fuse, drills, and
            the powder-can to the shaft; it was now eight feet deep, and to get into it and out of
            it a short ladder was used. They descended, and by command Fetlock held the
            drill—without any instructions as to the right way to hold it—and Flint
            proceeded to strike. The sledge came down; the drill sprang out of Fetlock's hand,
            almost as a matter of course. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e512">"You mangy son of a nigger, is that any way to hold a drill? Pick it up! Stand it up!
            There—hold fast. D— you! <i>I'll</i> teach you!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e517">At the end of an hour the drilling was finished. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e519">"Now, then, charge it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e521">The boy started to pour in the powder. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e523">"Idiot!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e525">A heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e527">"Get up! You can't lie sniveling there. Now, then, stick in the fuse <i>first. Now</i> put in the powder. Hold on, hold on! Are you going to fill the hole
              <i>all</i> up? Of all the sap-headed milksops I—Put in some
            dirt! Put in some gravel! Tamp it down! Hold on, hold on! Oh, great Scott! get out of
            the way!" He snatched the iron and tamped the charge himself, meantime cursing and
            blaspheming like a fiend. Then he fired the fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and ran
            fifty yards away, Fetlock following. They stood waiting a few minutes, then a great
            volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion; after a
            little there was a shower of descending stones; then all was serene again. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e535">"I wish to God you'd been in it!" remarked the master. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e538">They went down the shaft, cleaned it out, drilled another hole, and put in another
            charge. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e540">"Look here! How much fuse are you proposing to waste? Don't you know how to time a
            fuse?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e542">"No, sir." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e544">"You <i>don't!</i> Well, if you don't beat anything <i>I</i> ever saw!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e552">He climbed out of the shaft and spoke down: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e554">"Well, idiot, are you going to be all day? Cut the fuse and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e556">The trembling creature began: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e558">"If you please, sir, I—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e560">"You talk back to <i>me?</i> Cut it and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e565">The boy cut and lit. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e567">"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! I wish you were in—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e570">In his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft and ran. The boy was aghast. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e572">"Oh, my God! Help. Help! Oh, save me!" he implored. "Oh, what can I do! What <i>can</i> I do!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e577">He backed against the wall as tightly as he could; the sputtering fuse frightened the
            voice out of him; his breath stood still; he stood gazing and impotent; in two seconds,
            three seconds, four he would be flying toward the sky torn to fragments. Then he had an
            inspiration. He sprang at the fuse; severed the inch of it that was left above ground,
            and was saved. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e579">He sank down limp and half lifeless with fright, his strength gone; but he muttered
            with a deep joy: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e581">"He has learnt me! I knew there was a way, if I would wait." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e583">After a matter of five minutes Buckner stole to the shaft, looking worried and uneasy,
            and peered down into it. He took in the situation; he saw what had happened. He lowered
            the ladder, and the boy dragged himself weakly up it. He was very white. His appearance
            added something to Buckner's uncomfortable state, and he said, with a show of regret and
            sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from lack of practice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e585">"It was an accident, you know. Don't say anything about it to anybody; I was excited,
            and didn't notice what I was doing. You're not looking well; you've worked enough for
            to-day; go down to my cabin and eat what you want, and rest. It's just an accident, you
            know, on account of my being excited." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e587">"It scared me," said the lad, as he started away; "but I learnt something, so I don't
            mind it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e589">"Damned easy to please!" muttered Buckner, following him with his eye. I wonder if
            he'll tell? Mightn't he?... I wish it <i>had</i> killed him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e594">The boy took no advantage of his holiday in the matter of resting; he employed it in
            work, eager and feverish and happy work. A thick growth of chaparral extended down the
            mountainside clear to Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's labor was done in the dark
            intricacies of that stubborn growth; the rest of it was done in his own shanty. At last
            all was complete, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e596">"If he's got any suspicions that I'm going to tell on him, he won't keep them long,
            to-morrow. He will see that I am the same milksop as I always was—all day and the
            next. And the day after to-morrow night there 'll be an end of him; nobody will ever
            guess who finished him up nor how it was done. He dropped me the idea his own self, and
            that's odd."</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e602"> From the Springfield <i>Republican,</i> April 12, 1902.</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e607">To the Editor of the

                  question about the "esophagus," and I wish to answer him through you. This in the
                  hope that the answer will get around, and save me some penmanship, for I have
                  already replied to the same question more than several times, and am not getting
                  as much holiday as I ought to have.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e614"><i>I
                  published a short story lately, and it was in that that I put the esophagus. I
                  will say privately that I expected it to bother some people—in fact, that
                  was the intention—but the harvest has been larger than I was calculating
                  upon. The esophagus has gathered in the guilty and the innocent alike, whereas I
                  was only fishing for the innocent—the innocent and confiding. I knew a few
                  of these would write and ask me; that would give me but little trouble; but, I was
                  not expecting that the wise and the learned would call upon me for succor.
                  However, that has happened, and it is time for me to speak up and stop the
                  inquiries if I can, for letter-writing is not restful to me, and I am not having
                  so much fun out of this thing as I counted on. That you may understand the
                  situation, I will insert a couple of sample inquiries. The first is from a public
                  instructor in the Philippines: </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e618">SANTA CRUZ, <i>Ilocos, Sur, P. I. </i><br><i>February 13,
                  1902</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e626"><i>My dear Sir,—I have just been
                  reading the first part of your latest story, entitled "A Double-barreled Detective
                  Story," and am very much delighted with it. In Part IV, page 264,</i> Harper's
                Magazine <i>for January, occurs this passage: "far in the empty sky a
                  solitary 'esophagus' slept upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness,
                  serenity, and the peace of God." Now, there is one word I do not understand,
                  namely, "esophagus." My only work of reference is the</i> Standard Dictionary,
                  <i>but that fails to explain the meaning. If you can spare the
                  time, I would be glad to have the meaning cleared up, as I consider the passage a
                  very touching and beautiful one. It may seem foolish to you, but consider my lack
                  of means away out in the northern part of Luzon.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e636"><i>Yours very truly.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e640"><i>Do you notice?
                  Nothing in the paragraph disturbed him but that one word. It shows that the
                  paragraph was most ably constructed for the deception it was intended to put upon
                  the reader. It was my intention that it should read plausibly, and it is now plain
                  that it does; it was my intention that it should be emotional and touching, and
                  you see, yourself, that it fetched this public instructor. Alas, If I had but left
                  that one treacherous word out, I should have scored! scored everywhere; and the
                  paragraph would have slidden through every reader's sensibilities like oil, and
                  left not a suspicion behind.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e644"><i>The other sample
                  inquiry is from a professor in a New England university. It contains one naughty
                  word (which I cannot bear to suppress), but he is not in the theological
                  department, so it is no harm:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e648"><i>Dear Mr.
                  Clemens: "Far in the empty sky a "solitary esophagus slept upon motionless
                  wing."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e653"><i>It is not often I get a chance to read
                  much periodical literature, but I have just gone through at this belated period,
                  with much gratification and edification, your "Double-barreled Detective
                  Story."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e657"><i>But what in hell is an esophagus? I
                  keep one myself, but it never sleeps in the air or anywhere else. My profession is
                  to deal with words, and esophagus interested me the moment I lighted upon it. But
                  as a companion of my youth used to say, "I'll be eternally, co-eternally cussed"
                  if l can make it out. Is it a joke, or I an ignoramus?</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e661"><i>Between you and me, I was almost ashamed of having fooled that man,
                  but for pride's sake I was not going to say so. I wrote and told him it was a
                  joke—and that is what I am now saying to my Springfield inquirer. And I told
                  him to carefully read the whole paragraph, and he would find not a vestige of
                  sense in any detail of it. This also I commend to my Springfield
                inquirer.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e665"><i>I have confessed. I am
                  sorry—partially. I will not do so any more—for the present. Don't ask
                  me any more questions; let the esophagus have a rest—on his same old
                  motionless wing. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e669">MARK TWAIN</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e672">New York City, <i>April 10, 1902</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e677"><i>( Editorial
                  )</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e681"><i>The "Double-barreled Detective Story," which
                  appeared in</i> Harper's Magazine <i>for January and February
                  last, is the most elaborate of burlesques on detective fiction, with striking
                  melodramatic passages in which it is difficult to detect the deception, so ably is
                  it done. But the illusion ought not to endure even the first incident in the
                  February number. As for the paragraph which has so admirably illustrated the skill
                  of Mr. Clemens's ensemble and the carelessness of readers, here it
              is:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e688"><i>"It was a crisp and spicy morning in early
                  October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung
                  burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind nature for
                  the wingless wild things that have their home in the tree-tops and would visit
                  together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow flames in
                  brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the sensuous
                  fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere; far
                  in the empty sky a solitary esophagus slept upon motionless wings; everywhere
                  brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e692"><i>The success of Mark Twain's joke recalls to mind his story of the
                  petrified man in the cavern, whom he described most punctiliously, first giving a
                  picture of the scene, its impressive solitude, and all that; then going on to
                  describe the majesty of the figure, casually mentioning that the thumb of his
                  right hand rested against the side of his nose; then after further description
                  observing that the fingers of the right hand were extended in a radiating fashion;
                  and, recurring to the dignified attitude and position of the man, incidentally
                  remarked that the thumb of the left hand was in contact with the little finger of
                  the right—and so on. But was it so ingeniously written that Mark, relating
                  the history years later in an article which appeared in that excellent magazine of
                  the past, the</i> Galaxy, <i>declared that no one ever found out
                  the joke, and, if we remember aright, that that astonishing old mockery was
                  actually looked for in the region where he, as a Nevada newspaper editor, had
                  located it. It is certain that Mark Twain's jumping frog has a good many more
                  "pints" than any other frog.</i></p>Chapter V<p id="TwaDoubd1e702">The next day came and went. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e704">It is now almost midnight, and in five minutes the new morning will begin. The scene is
            in the tavern billiard-room. Rough men in rough clothing, slouch-hats, breeches stuffed
            into boot-tops, some with vests, none with coats, are grouped about the boiler-iron
            stove, which has ruddy cheeks and is distributing a grateful warmth; the billiard-balls
            are clacking; there is no other sound—that is, within; the wind is fitfully
            moaning without. The men look bored; also expectant. A hulking broad-shouldered miner,
            of middle age, with grizzled whiskers, and an unfriendly eye set in an unsociable face,
            rises, slips a coil of fuse upon his arm, gathers up some other personal properties, and
            departs without word or greeting to anybody. It is Flint Buckner. As the door closes
            behind him a buzz of talk breaks out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e706">"The regularest man that ever was," said Jake Parker, the blacksmith: "you can tell
            when it's twelve just by him leaving, without looking at your Waterbury." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e708">"And it's the only virtue he's got, as fur as I know," said Peter Hawes, miner. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e710">"He's just a blight on this society," said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "If I was
            running this shop I'd make him say something, <i>some</i> time or other,
            or vamos the ranch." This with a suggestive glance at the barkeeper, who did not choose
            to see it, since the man under discussion was a good customer, and went home pretty well
            set up, every night, with refreshments furnished from the bar. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e715">"Say," said Ham Sandwich, miner, "does any of you boys ever recollect of him asking you
            to take a drink?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e717"><i>"Him?</i> Flint <i>Buckner?</i> Oh, Laura!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e724">This sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous general outburst in one form of words or
            another from the crowd. After a brief silence, Pat Riley, miner, said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e726">"He's the 15-puzzle, that cuss. And his boy's another one. <i>I
            </i>can't make them out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e731">"Nor anybody else," said Ham Sandwich; "and if they are 15-puzzles how are you going to
            rank up that other one? When it comes to A 1 right-down solid mysteriousness, he lays
            over both of them. <i>Easy—</i>don't he?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e737">"You bet!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e739">Everybody said it. Every man but one. He was the new-comer-Peterson. He ordered the
            drinks all round, and asked who No. 3 might be. All answered at once, "Archy Stillman!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e741">"Is he a mystery?" asked Peterson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e743">"Is <i>he</i> a mystery? Is Archy <i>Stillman a</i>
            mystery?" said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "Why, the fourth dimension's foolishness to
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e754">For Ferguson was learned. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e756">Peterson wanted to hear all about him; everybody wanted to tell him; everybody began.
            But Billy Stevens, the barkeeper, called the house to order, and said one at a time was
            best. He distributed the drinks, and appointed Ferguson to lead. Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e758">"Well, he's a boy. And that is just about all we know about him. You can pump him till
            you are tired; it ain't any use; you won't get anything. At least about his intentions,
            or line of business, or where he's from, and such things as that. And as for getting at
            the nature and get-up of his main big chief mystery, why, he'll just change the subject,
            that's all. You can <i>guess</i> till you're black in the
            face—it's your privilege—but suppose you do, where do you arrive at?
            Nowhere, as near as I can make out," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e763">"What <i>is</i> his big chief one?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e768">"Sight, maybe. Hearing, maybe. Instinct, maybe. Magic, maybe. Take your
            choice—grownups, twenty-five; children and servants, half price. Now I'll tell you
            what he can do. You can start here, and just disappear; you can go and hide wherever you
            want to, I don't care where it is, nor how far—and he'll go straight and put his
            finger on you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e770">"You don't mean it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e772">"I just do, though. Weather's nothing to him—elemental conditions is nothing to
            him—he don't even take notice of them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e775">"Oh, come! Dark? Rain? Snow? Hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e777">"It's all the same to <i>him.</i> He don't give a damn." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e782">"Oh, <i>say—</i>including <i>fog,</i> per'aps?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e790"><i>"Fog!</i> he's got an eye 't can plunk through it like a bullet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e794">"Now, boys, honor bright, what's he giving me?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e796">"It's a fact!" they all shouted. "Go on, Wells-Fargo." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e798">"Well, sir, you can leave him here, chatting with the boys, and you can slip out and go
            to any cabin in this camp and open a book—yes, sir, a dozen of them—and take
            the page in your memory, and he'll start out and go straight to that cabin and open
            every one of them books at the right page, and call it off, and never make a mistake." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e800">"He must be the devil!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e802">"More than one has thought it. Now I'll tell you a perfectly wonderful thing that he
            done. The other night he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e804">There was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside, the door flew open, and an excited
            crowd burst in, with the camp's one white woman in the lead and crying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e806">"My child! my child! she's lost and gone! For the love of God help me to find Archy
            Stillman; we've hunted everywhere!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e809">Said the barkeeper: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e811">"Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, and don't worry. He asked for a bed three hours ago,
            tuckered out tramping the trails the way he's always doing, and went up-stairs. Ham
            Sandwich, run up and roust him out; he's in No. 14." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e813">The youth was soon down-stairs and ready. He asked Mrs. Hogan for particulars. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e815">"Bless you, dear, there ain't any; I wish there was. I put her to sleep at seven in the
            evening, and when I went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself, she was gone. I
            rushed for your cabin, dear, and you wasn't there, and I've hunted for you ever since,
            at every cabin down the gulch, and now I've come up again, and I'm that distracted and
            scared and heartbroke; but, thanks to God, I've found you at last, dear heart, and
            you'll find my child. Come on! come quick!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e817">"Move right along; I'm with you, madam. Go to your cabin first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e819">The whole company streamed out to join the hunt. All the southern half of the village
            was up, a hundred men strong, and waiting outside, a vague dark mass sprinkled with
            twinkling lanterns. The mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself
            to the narrow road, and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders. In a
            few minutes the Hogan cabin was reached. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e821">"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Hogan; "there's where she was; it's where I laid her at
            seven o'clock; but where she is now, God only knows." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e823">"Hand me a lantern," said Archy. He set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it,
            pretending to examine the ground closely. "Here's her track," he said, touching the
            ground here and there and yonder with his finger. "Do you see?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e825">Several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see. One or two
            thought they discerned something like a track; the others shook their heads and
            confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp
            enough to discover. One said, "Maybe a child's foot could make a mark on it, but <i>I</i> don't see how." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e830">Young Stillman stepped outside, held the light to the ground, turned leftward, and
            moved three steps, closely examining; then said, "I've got the direction—come
            along; take the lantern, somebody." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e832">He strode off swiftly southward, the files following, swaying and bending in and out
            with the deep curves of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the mouth of the gorge was reached;
            before them stretched the sagebrush plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman called a halt,
            saying, "We mustn't start wrong, now; we must take the direction again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e835">He took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards; then said,
            "Come on; it's all right," and gave up the lantern. In and out among the sage-bushes he
            marched, a quarter of a mile, bearing gradually to the right; then took a new direction
            and made another great semicircle; then changed again and moved due west nearly half a
            mile—and stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e837">"She gave it up, here, poor little chap. Hold the lantern. You can see where she sat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e839">But this was in a slick alkali flat which was surfaced like steel, and no person in the
            party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a
            cushion on a veneer like that. The bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the
            spot, lamenting. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e841">"But where is she, then?" some one said. "She didn't stay here. We can see <i>that</i> much, anyway." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e846">Stillman moved about in a circle around the place, with the lantern, pretending to hunt
            for tracks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e848">"Well!" he said presently, in an annoyed tone, "I don't understand it." He examined
            again. "No use. She was here—that's certain; she never <i>walked</i> away from here—and that's certain. It's a puzzle; I can't make it
            out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e853">The mother lost heart then. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e855">"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! some flying beast has got her. I'll never see her
            again!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e857">"Ah, <i>don't</i> give up," said Archy. "We'll find her—don't
            give up." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e862">"God bless you for the words, Archy Stillman!" and she seized his hand and kissed it
            fervently. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e864">Peterson, the new-comer, whispered satirically in Ferguson's ear: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e867">"Wonderful performance to find this place, wasn't it? Hardly worth while to come so
            far, though; any other supposititious place would have answered just as well—hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e869">Ferguson was not pleased with the innuendo. He said, with some warmth: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e871">"Do you mean to insinuate that the child hasn't been here? I tell you the child <i>has</i> been here! Now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a
            little fuss as—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e876">"All right!" sang out Stillman. "Come, everybody, and look at this! It was right under
            our noses all the time, and we didn't see it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e878">There was a general plunge for the ground at the place where the child was alleged to
            have rested, and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to see the thing that Archy's finger
            was resting upon. There was a pause, then a several-barreled sigh of disappointment. Pat
            Riley and Ham Sandwich said, in the one breath: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e880">"What is it, Archy? There's nothing here." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e882">"Nothing? Do you call <i>that</i> nothing?" and he swiftly traced upon
            the ground a form with his finger. "There—don't you recognize it now? It's Injun
            Billy's track. He's got the child." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e887">"God be praised !" from the mother. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e889">"Take away the lantern. I've got the direction. Follow!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e891">He started on a run, racing in and out among the sage-bushes a matter of three hundred
            yards, and disappeared over a sand-wave; the others struggled after him, caught him up,
            and found him waiting. Ten steps away was a little wickiup, a dim and formless shelter
            of rags and old horse-blankets, a dull light showing through its chinks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e893">"You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the lad. "It's your privilege to be first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e896">All followed the sprint she made for the wickiup, and saw, with her, the picture its
            interior afforded. Injun Billy was sitting on the ground; the child was asleep beside
            him. The mother hugged it with a wild embrace, which included Archy Stillman, the
            grateful tears running down her face, and in a choked and broken voice she poured out a
            golden stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments which has its home in full
            richness nowhere but in the Irish heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e898">"I find her bymeby it is ten o'clock," Billy explained. "She 'sleep out yonder, ve'y
            tired—face wet, been cryin', 'spose; fetch her home, feed her, she heap much
            hungry—go 'sleep 'gin." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e900">In her limitless gratitude the happy mother waived rank and hugged him too, calling him
            "the angel of God in disguise." And he probably was in disguise if he was that kind of
            an official. He was dressed for the character. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e902">At half past one in the morning the procession burst into the village singing, "When
            Johnny Comes Marching Home," waving its lanterns and swallowing the drinks that were
            brought out all along its course. It concentrated at the tavern, and made a night of
            what was left of the morning.</p>Chapter VI<p id="TwaDoubd1e907">The next afternoon the village was electrified with an immense sensation. A grave and
            dignified foreigner of distinguished bearing and appearance had arrived at the tavern,
            and entered this formidable name upon the register: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e909">SHERLOCK HOLMES
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e913">The news buzzed from cabin to cabin, from claim to claim; tools were dropped, and the
            town swarmed toward the center of interest. A man passing out at the northern end of the
            village shouted it to Pat Riley, whose claim was the next one to Flint Buckner's. At
            that time Fetlock Jones seemed to turn sick. He muttered to himself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e915">"Uncle <i>Sherlock!</i> The mean luck of it!—that <i>he </i>should come just when..." He dropped into a reverie, and
            presently said to himself: "But what's the use of being afraid of <i>him?
            </i>Anybody that knows him the way I do knows he can't detect a crime except where he
            plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and hires some fellow to commit it
            according to instructions.... Now there ain't going to <i>be</i> any
            clues this time—so, what show has he got? None at all. No, sir; everything's
            ready. If I was to risk putting it off—...No, I won't run any risk like that.
            Flint Buckner goes out of this world to-night, for sure." Then another trouble presented
            itself. "Uncle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening, and
            how am I going to get rid of him? for I've <i>got</i> to be at my cabin
            a minute or two about eight o'clock." This was an awkward matter, and cost him much
            thought. But he found a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll go for a walk, and I'll leave
            him in the road a minute, so that he won't see what it is I do: the best way to throw a
            detective off the track, anyway, is to have him along when you are preparing the thing.
            Yes, that's the safest—I'll take him with me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e932">Meantime the road in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping
            for a glimpse of the great man. But he kept his room, and did not appear. None but
            Ferguson, Jake Parker the blacksmith, and Ham Sandwich had any luck. These enthusiastic
            admirers of the great scientific detective hired the tavern's detained-baggage lockup,
            which looked into the detective's room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide,
            ambushed themselves in it, and cut some peep-holes in the window-blind. Mr. Holmes's
            blinds were down; but by and by he raised them. It gave the spies a hair-lifting but
            pleasurable thrill to find themselves face to face with the Extraordinary Man who had
            filled the world with the fame of his more than human ingenuities. There he
            sat—not a myth, not a shadow, but real, alive, compact of substance, and almost
            within touching distance with the hand. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e934">"Look at that head!" said Ferguson, in an awed voice. "By gracious! <i>that's</i> a head!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e939">"You bet!" said the blacksmith, with deep reverence. "Look at his nose! look at his
            eyes! Intellect? Just a battery of it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e941">"And that paleness," said Ham Sandwich. "Comes from thought—that's what it comes
            from. Hell! duffers like us don't know what real thought <i>is."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e946">"No more we don't," said Ferguson. "What we take for thinking is just
            blubber-and-slush," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e948">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo. And look at that frown—that's <i>deep</i> thinking—away down, down, forty fathom into the bowels of things.
            He's on the track of something." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e954">"Well, he is, and don't you forget it. Say—look at that awful gravity—look
            at that pallid solemness—there ain't any corpse can lay over it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e956">"No, sir, not for dollars! And it's his'n by hereditary rights, too; he's been dead
            four times a'ready, and there's history for it. Three times natural, once by accident.
            I've heard say he smells damp and cold, like a grave. And he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e958">" 'Sh! Watch him! There—he's got his thumb on the bump on the near corner of his
            forehead, and his forefinger on the off one. His think-works is just a-<i>grinding</i> now, you bet your other shirt." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e963">"That's so. And now he's gazing up toward heaven and stroking his mustache slow,
            and—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e965">"Now he has rose up standing, and is putting his clues together on his left fingers
            with his right finger. See? he touches the forefinger—now middle finger—now
            ring-finger—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e967">"Stuck!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e969">"Look at him scowl! He can't seem to make out <i>that</i> clue. So
            he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e974">"See him smile!—like a tiger—and tally off the other fingers like nothing!
            He's got it, boys; he's got it sure!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e976">"Well, I should <i>say!</i> I'd hate to be in that man's place that
            he's after." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e981">Mr. Holmes drew a table to the window, sat down with his back to the spies, and
            proceeded to write. The spies withdrew their eyes from the peep-holes, lit their pipes,
            and settled themselves for a comfortable smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with conviction: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e983">"Boys, it's no use talking, he's a wonder! He's got the signs of it all over him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e986">"You hain't ever said a truer word than that, Wells-Fargo," said Jake Parker. "Say,
            wouldn't it 'a' been nuts if he'd a-been here last night?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e988">"Oh, by George, but wouldn't it!" said Ferguson. "Then we'd have seen <i>scientific</i> work. Intellect—just pure intellect—away up on the upper
            levels, dontchuknow. Archy is all right, and it don't become anybody to belittle <i>him,</i> I can tell you. But his gift is only just eyesight, sharp as
            an owl's, as near as I can make it out just a grand natural animal talent, no more, no
            less, and prime as far as it goes, but no intellect in it, and for awfulness and
            marvelousness no more to be compared to what this man does than—than—Why,
            let me tell you what <i>he'd</i> have done. He'd have stepped over to
            Hogan's and glanced—just <i>glanced,</i> that's all—at the
            premises, and that's enough. See everything? Yes, sir, to the last little detail; and
            he'll know more about that place than the Hogans would know in seven years. Next, he
            would sit down on the bunk, just as ca'm, and say to Mrs. Hogan—<i>Say,</i> Ham, consider that you are Mrs. Hogan. I'll ask the questions; you answer
            them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1005">"All right; go on." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1007">" 'Madam, if you please—attention—do not let your mind wander. Now,
            then—sex of the child?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1009">" 'Female, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1011">" 'Um—female. Very good, very good. Age?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1013">" 'Turned six, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1015">" 'Um—young, weak—two miles. Weariness will overtake it then. It will sink
            down and sleep. We shall find it two miles away, or less. Teeth?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1017">" 'Five, your Honor, and one a-coming.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1019">" 'Very good, very good, <i>very</i> good, indeed.' You see, boys, <i>he</i> knows a clue when he sees it, when it wouldn't mean a dern thing
            to anybody else. 'Stockings, madam? Shoes?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1027">" 'Yes, your Honor—both.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1030">" 'Yarn, perhaps? Morocco?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1032">" 'Yarn, your Honor. And kip.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1034">" 'Um—kip. This complicates the matter. However, let it go—we shall manage.
            Religion?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1036">" 'Catholic, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1038">" 'Very good. Snip me a bit from the bed blanket, please. Ah, thanks. Part
            wool—foreign make. Very well. A snip from some garment of the child's, please.
            Thanks. Cotton. Shows wear. An excellent clue, excellent. Pass me a pallet of the floor
            dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, many thanks. Ah, admirable, admirable! <i>Now</i> we know where we are, I think.' You see, boys, he's got all the
            clues he wants now; he don't need anything more. Now, then, what does this Extraordinary
            Man do? He lays those snips and that dirt out on the table and leans over them on his
            elbows, and puts them together side by side and studies them—mumbles to himself,
            'Female'; changes them around—mumbles, 'Six years old'; changes them this way and
            that—again mumbles: 'Five teeth—one
            a-coming—Catholic—yarn—cotton—kip—damn that kip.' Then he
            straightens up and gazes toward heaven, and plows his hands through his hair—plows
            and plows, muttering, 'Damn that kip!' Then he stands up and frowns, and begins to tally
            off his clues on his fingers—and gets stuck at the ring-finger. But only just a
            minute—then his face glares all up in a smile like a house afire, and he
            straightens up stately and majestic, and says to the crowd, 'Take a lantern, a couple of
            you, and go down to Injun Billy's and fetch the child—the rest of you go 'long
            home to bed; good-night, madam; good-night, gents.' And he bows like the Matterhorn, and
            pulls out for the tavern. That's <i>his</i> style, and the <i>Only—</i>scientific, intellectual—all over in fifteen
            minutes—no poking around all over the sage-brush range an hour and a half in a
            mass-meeting crowd for <i>him,</i> boys—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1055">"By Jackson, it's grand!" said Ham Sandwich. "Wells-Fargo, you've got him down to a
            dot. He ain't painted up any exacter to the life in the books. By George, I can juse <i>see</i> him—can't you, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1060">"You bet you! It's just a photograft, that's what it is." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1062">Ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success, and grateful. He sat silently
            enjoying his happiness a little while, then he murmured, with a deep awe in his voice, </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1064">"I wonder if God made him?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1066">There was no response for a moment; then Ham Sandwich said, reverently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1068">"Not all at one time, I reckon."</p>Chapter VII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1073">At eight o'clock that evening two persons were groping their way past Flint Buckner's
            cabin in the frosty gloom. They were Sherlock Holmes and his nephew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1075">"Stop here in the road a moment, uncle," said Fetlock, "while I run to my cabin; I
            won't be gone a minute." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1077">He asked for something—the uncle furnished it—then he disappeared in the
            darkness, but soon returned, and the talking-walk was resumed. By nine o'clock they had
            wandered back to the tavern. They worked their way through the billiard-room, where a
            crowd had gathered in the hope of getting a glimpse of the Extraordinary Man. A royal
            cheer was raised. Mr. Holmes acknowledged the compliment with a series of courtly bows,
            and as he was passing out his nephew said to the assemblage: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1079">"Uncle Sherlock's got some work to do, gentlemen, that 'll keep him till twelve or one;
            but he'll be down again then, or earlier if he can, and hopes some of you'll be left to
            take a drink with him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1081">"By George, he's just a duke, boys! Three cheers for Sherlock Holmes, the greatest man
            that ever lived!" shouted Ferguson. "Hip, hip, hip—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1083">"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Tiger!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1085">The uproar shook the building, so hearty was the feeling the boys put into their
            welcome. Up-stairs the uncle reproached the nephew gently, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1087">"What did you get me into that engagement for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1089">"I reckon you don't want to be unpopular, do you, uncle? Well, then, don't you put on
            any exclusiveness in a mining-camp, that's all. The boys admire you; but if you was to
            leave without taking a drink with them, they'd set you down for a snob. And besides, you
            said you had home talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1091">The boy was right, and wise—the uncle acknowledged it. The boy was wise in
            another detail which he did not mention—except to himself: "Uncle and the others
            will come handy—in the way of nailing an <i>alibi </i>where it
            can't be budged." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1097">He and his uncle talked diligently about three hours. Then, about midnight, Fetlock
            stepped down-stairs and took a position in the dark a dozen steps from the tavern, and
            waited. Five minutes later Flint Buckner came rocking out of the billiard-room and
            almost brushed him as he passed. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1099">"I've <i>got</i> him!" muttered the boy. He continued to himself,
            looking after the shadowy form: "Good-by—good-by for good, Flint Buckner; you
            called my mother a—well, never mind what: it's all right, now; you're taking your
            last walk, friend." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1104">He went musing back into the tavern. "From now till one is an hour. We'll spend it with
            the boys; it's good for the <i>alibi."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1109">He brought Sherlock Holmes to the billiard-room, which was jammed with eager and
            admiring miners; the guest called the drinks, and the fun began. Everybody was happy;
            everybody was complimentary; the ice was soon broken, songs, anecdotes, and more drinks
            followed, and the pregnant minutes flew. At six minutes to one, when the jollity was at
            its highest— </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1111"><i>Boom!</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1115">There was silence instantly. The deep sound came rolling and rumbling frown peak to
            peak up the gorge, then died down, and ceased. The spell broke, then, and the men made a
            rush for the door, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1117">"Something's blown up!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1119">Outside, a voice in the darkness said, "It's away down the gorge; I saw the flash." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1121">The crowd poured down the cañon—Holmes, Fetlock, Archy Stillman,
            everybody. They made the mile in a few minutes. By the light of a lantern they found the
            smooth and solid dirt floor of Flint Buckner's cabin; of the cabin itself not a vestige
            remained, not a rag nor a splinter. Nor any sign of Flint. Search-parties sought here
            and there and yonder, and presently a cry went up. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1123">"Here he is!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1125">It was true. Fifty yards down the gulch they had found him—that is, they had
            found a crushed and lifeless mass which represented him. Fetlock Jones hurried thither
            with the others and looked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1128">The inquest was a fifteen-minute affair. Ham Sandwich, foreman of the jury, handed up
            the verdict, which was phrased with a certain unstudied literary grace, and closed with
            this finding, to wit: that "deceased came to his death by his own act or some other
            person or persons unknown to this jury not leaving any family or similar effects behind
            but his cabin which was blown away and God have mercy on his soul amen." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1130">Then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd, for the storm-center of interest was
            there—Sherlock Holmes. The miners stood silent and reverent in a half-circle,
            inclosing a large vacant space which included the front exposure of the site of the late
            premises. In this considerable space the Extraordinary Man was moving about, attended by
            his nephew with a lantern. With a tape he took measurements of the cabin site; of the
            distance from the wall of chaparral to the road; of the height of the chaparral bushes;
            also various other measurements. He gathered a rag here, a splinter there, and a pinch
            of earth yonder, inspected them profoundly, and preserved them. He took the "lay" of the
            place with a pocket-compass, allowing two seconds for magnetic variation. He took the
            time (Pacific) by his watch, correcting it for local time. He paced off the distance
            from the cabin site to the corpse, and corrected that for tidal differentiation. He took
            the altitude with a pocket-aneroid, and the temperature with a pocket-thermometer.
            Finally he said, with a stately bow: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1132">"It is finished. Shall we return, gentlemen?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1134">He took up the line of march for the tavern, and the crowd fell into his wake,
            earnestly discussing and admiring the Extraordinary Man, and interlarding guesses as to
            the origin of the tragedy and who the author of it might he. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1136">"My, but it's grand luck having him here—hey, boys?" said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1138">"It's the biggest thing of the century," said Ham Sandwich. "It 'll go all over the
            world; you mark my words." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1140"><i>"You</i> bet!" said Jake Parker, the blacksmith. "It 'll boom this
            camp. Ain't it so, Wells-Fargo?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1144">"Well, as you want my opinion—if it's any sign of how <i>I
            </i>think about it, I can tell you this: yesterday I was holding the Straight Flush
            claim at two dollars a foot; I'd like to see the man that can get it at sixteen to-day." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1149">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo! It's the grandest luck a new camp ever struck. Say, did
            you see him collar them little rags and dirt and things? What an eye! He just can't
            overlook a clue—'tain't <i>in </i>him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1154">"That's so. And they wouldn't mean a thing to anybody else; but to him, why, they're
            just a book—large print at that." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1156">"Sure's you're born! Them odds and ends have got their little old secret, and they
            think there ain't anybody can pull it; but, land! when he sets his grip there they've
            got to squeal, and don't you forget it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1159">"Boys, I ain't sorry, now, that he wasn't here to roust out the child; this is a bigger
            thing, by a long sight. Yes, sir, and more tangled up and scientific and intellectual." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1161">"I reckon we're all of us glad it's turned out this way. Glad? 'George! it ain't any
            name for it. Dontchuknow, Archy could 've <i>learnt</i> something if
            he'd had the nous to stand by and take notice of how that man works the system. But no;
            he went poking up into the chaparral and just missed the whole thing." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1166">"It's true as gospel; I seen it myself. Well, Archy's young. He'll know better one of
            these days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1168">"Say, boys, who do you reckon done it?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1170">That was a difficult question, and brought out a world of unsatisfying conjecture.
            Various men were mentioned as possibilities, but one by one they were discarded as not
            being eligible. No one but young Hillyer had been intimate with Flint Buckner; no one
            had really had a quarrel with him; he had affronted every man who had tried to make up
            to him, although not quite offensively enough to require bloodshed. There was one name
            that was upon every tongue from the start, but it <i>was</i> the last to
            get utterance—Fetlock Jones's. It was Pat Riley that mentioned it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1175">"Oh, well," the boys said, "of course we've all thought of him, because he had a
            million rights to kill Flint Buckner, and it was just his plain duty to do it. But all
            the same there's two things we can't get around: for one thing, he hasn't got the sand;
            and for another, he wasn't anywhere near the place when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1177">"I know it," said Pat. "He was there in the billiard-room with us when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1179">"Yes, and was there all the time for an hour <i>before</i> it
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1184">"It's so. And lucky for him, too. He'd have been suspected in a minute if it hadn't
            been for that."</p>Chapter VIII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1189">The tavern dining-room had been cleared of all its furniture save one six-foot pine
            table and a chair. This table was against one end of the room; the chair was on it;
            Sherlock Holmes, stately, imposing, impressive, sat in the chair. The public stood. The
            room was full. The tobacco-smoke was dense, the stillness profound. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1191">The Extraordinary Man raised his hand to command additional silence; held it in the air
            a few moments; then, in brief, crisp terms he put forward question after question, and
            noted the answers with "Um-ums," nods of the head, and so on. By this process he learned
            all about Flint Buckner, his character, conduct, and habits, that the people were able
            to tell him. It thus transpired that the Extraordinary Man's nephew was the only person
            in the camp who had a killing-grudge against Flint Buckner. Mr. Holmes smiled
            compassionately upon the witness, and asked, languidly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1193">"Do any of you gentlemen chance to know where the lad Fetlock Jones was at the time of
            the explosion?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1195">A thunderous response followed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1197">"In the billiard-room of this house!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1199">"Ah. And had he just come in?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1201">"Been there all of an hour!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1203">"Ah. It is about—about—well, about how far might it be to the scene of the
            explosions" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1205">"All of a mile!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1207">"Ah. It isn't <i>much</i> of an alibi, 'tis true, but—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1213">A storm-burst of laughter, mingled with shouts of "By jiminy, but he's
            chain-lightning!" and "Ain't you sorry you spoke, Sandy?" shut off the rest of the
            sentence, and the crushed witness drooped his blushing face in pathetic shame. The
            inquisitor resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1215">"The lad Jones's somewhat <i>distant</i> connection with the case"
              (laughter<i>) "</i>having been disposed of, let us now call the
            eye-witnesses of the tragedy, and listen to what they have to say." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1223">He got out his fragmentary clues and arranged them on a sheet of cardboard on his knee.
            The house held its breath and watched. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1225">"We have the longitude and the latitude, corrected for magnetic variation, and this
            gives us the exact location of the tragedy. We have the altitude, the temperature, and
            the degree of humidity prevailing—inestimably valuable, since they enable us to
            estimate with precision the degree of influence which they would exercise upon the mood
            and disposition of the assassin at that time of the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1227"><i>(Buzz of admiration; muttered remark, "By George, but he's
              deep.")</i> He fingered his clues. "And now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak
            to us. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1231">"Here we have an empty linen shot-bag. What is its message? This: that robbery was the
            motive, not revenge. What is its further message? This: that the assassin was of
            inferior intelligence—shall we say light-witted, or perhaps approaching that? How
            do we know this? Because a person of sound intelligence would not have proposed to rob
            the man Buckner, who never had much money with him. But the assassin might have been a
            stranger? Let the bag speak again. I take from it this article. It is a bit of
            silver-bearing quartz. It is peculiar. Examine it, please—you—and
            you—and you. Now pass it back, please. There is but one lode on this coast which
            produces just that character and color of quartz; and that is a lode which crops out for
            nearly two miles on a stretch, and in my opinion is destined, at no distant day, to
            confer upon its locality a globe-girdling celebrity, and upon its two hundred owners
            riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Name that lode, please." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1233">"The Consolidated Christian Science and Mary Ann!" was the prompt response. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1235">A wild crash of hurrahs followed, and every man reached for his neighbor's hand and
            wrung it, with tears in his eyes; and Wells-Fargo Ferguson shouted, "The Straight Flush
            is on the lode, and up she goes to a hunched and fifty a foot—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1240">When quiet fell, Mr. Holmes resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1242">"We perceive, then, that three facts are established, to wit: the assassin was
            approximately light-witted; he was not a stranger; his motive was robbery, not revenge.
            Let us proceed. I hold in my hand a small fragment of fuse, with the recent smell of
            fire upon it. What is its testimony? Taken with the corroborative evidence of the
            quartz, it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner. What does it tell us further?
            This, gentlemen: that the assassination was consummated by means of an explosive. What
            else does it say? This: that the explosive was located against the side of the cabin
            nearest the road—the front side—for within six feet of that spot I found it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1244">"I hold in my fingers a burnt Swedish match—the kind one rubs on a safety-box. I
            found it in the road, six hundred and twenty-two feet from the abolished cabin. What
            does it say? This: that the train was fired from that point. What further does it tell
            us? This: that the assassin was left-handed. How do I know this? I should not be able to
            explain to you, gentlemen, how I know it, the signs being so subtle that only long
            experience and deep study can enable one to detect them. But the signs are here, and
            they are reinforced by a fact which you must have often noticed in the great detective
            narratives—that <i>all </i>assassins are left-handed." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1250">"By Jackson, <i>that's</i> so." said Ham Sandwich, bringing his great
            hand down with a resounding slap upon his thigh; "blamed if I ever thought of it
            before." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1255">"Nor I!" "Nor I!" cried several. "Oh, there can't anything escape <i>him—</i>look at his eye!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1260">"Gentlemen, distant as the murderer was from his doomed victim, he did not wholly
            escape injury. This fragment of wood which I now exhibit to you struck him. It drew
            blood. Wherever he is, he bears the telltale mark. I picked it up where he stood when he
            fired the fatal train," He looked out over the house from his high perch, and his
            countenance began to darken; he slowly raised his hand, and pointed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1262">"There stands the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1264">For a moment the house was paralyzed with amazement; then twenty voices burst out with: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1266">"Sammy Hillyer? Oh, <i>hell,</i> no! <i>Him?</i> It's
            pure foolishness!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1274">"Take care, gentlemen—be not hasty. Observe—he has the blood-mark on his
            brow." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1276">Hillyer turned white with fright. He was near to crying. He turned this way and that,
            appealing to every face for help and sympathy; and held out his supplicating hands
            toward Holmes and began to plead: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1278"><i>"Don't,</i> oh, don't! I never did it; I give my word I never did
            it. The way I got this hurt on my forehead was—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1282">"Arrest him, constable!" cried Holmes. "I will swear out the warrant" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1284">The constable moved reluctantly forward—hesitated—stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1287">Hillyer broke out with another appeal. "Oh, Archy, don't let them do it; it would kill
            mother! <i>You</i> know how I got the hurt. Tell them, and save me,
            Archy; save me!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1292">Stillman worked his way to the front, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1294">"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be afraid." Then he said to the house, "Never mind how he
            got the hurt; it hasn't anything to do with this case, and isn't of any consequence." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1296">"God bless you, Archy, for a true friend!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1298">"Hurrah for Archy! Go in, boy, and play 'em a knock-down flush to their two pair 'n' a
            jack!" shouted the house, pride in their home talent and a patriotic sentiment of
            loyalty to it rising suddenly in the public heart and changing the whole attitude of the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1300">Young Stillman waited for the noise to cease; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1302">"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand by that door yonder, and Constable Harris to stand by
            the other one here, and not let anybody leave the room. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1304">"Said and done. Go on, old man!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1306">"The criminal is present, I believe. I will show him to you before long, in case I am
            right in my guess. Now I will tell you all about the tragedy, from start to finish. The
            motive <i>wasn't </i>robbery; it was revenge. The murderer <i>wasn't</i> light-witted. He <i>didn't</i> stand six
            hundred and twenty-two feet away. He <i>didn't </i>get hit with a piece
            of wood. He <i>didn't</i> place the explosive against the cabin. He <i>didn't</i> bring a shot-bag with him, and he <i>wasn't</i> left-handed. With the exception of these errors, the distinguished
            guest's statement of the case is substantially correct." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1330">A comfortable laugh rippled over the house; friend nodded to friend, as much as to say,
            "That's the word, with the bark <i>on</i> it. Good lad, good boy. <i>He</i> ain't lowering his flag any!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1338">The guest's serenity was not disturbed. Stillman resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1341">"I also have some witnesses; and I will presently tell you where you can find some
            more." He held up a piece of coarse wire; the crowd craned their necks to see. "It has a
            smooth coating of melted tallow on it. And here is a candle which is burned half-way
            down. The remaining half of it has marks cut upon it an inch apart. Soon I will tell you
            where I found these things. I will now put aside reasonings, guesses, the impressive
            hitchings of odds and ends of clues together, and the other showy theatricals of the
            detective trade, and tell you in a plain, straightforward way just how this dismal thing
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1343">He paused a moment, for effect—to allow silence and suspense to intensify and
            concentrate the house's interest; then he went on: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1345">"The assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains. It was a good plan, very
            ingenious, and showed an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. It was a plan which was
            well calculated to ward off all suspicion from its inventor. In the <i>first</i> place, he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart, and lit it and timed
            it. He found it took three hours to burn four inches of it. I tried it myself for half
            an hour, awhile ago, up-stairs here, while the inquiry into Flint Buckner's character
            and ways was being conducted in this room, and I arrived in that way at the rate of a
            candle's consumption when sheltered from the wind. Having proved his trial candle's
            rate, he blew it out—I have already shown it to you—and put <i>his</i> inch-marks on a fresh one. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1353">"He put the fresh one into a tin candlestick. Then at the five-hour mark he bored a
            hole through the candle with a red-hot wire. I have already shown you the wire, with a
            smooth coat of tallow on it—tallow that had been melted and had cooled. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1355">"With labor—very hard labor, I should say—he struggled up through the stiff
            chaparral that clothes the steep hillside back of Flint Buckner's place, tugging an
            empty flour-barrel with him. He placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place, and in
            the bottom of it he set the candlestick. Then he measured off about thirty-five feet of
            fuse—the barrel's distance from the back of the cabin. He bored a hole in the side
            of the barrel—here is the large gimlet he did it with. He went on and finished his
            work; and when it was done, one end of the fuse was in Buckner's cabin, and the other
            end, with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder, was in the hole in the
            candle—timed to blow the place up at one o'clock this morning, provided the candle
            was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening—which I am betting it was—and
            provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the
            fuse—which I am also betting there was, though I can't prove it. Boys, the barrel
            is there in the chaparral, the candle's remains are in it in the tin stick; the
            burnt-out fuse is in the gimlet-hole, the other end is down the hill where the late
            cabin stood. I saw them all an hour or two ago, when the Professor here was measuring
            off unimplicated vacancies and collecting relics that hadn't anything to do with the
            case." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1357">He paused. The house drew a long, deep breath, shook its strained cords and muscles
            free and burst into cheers. "Dang him!" said Ham Sandwich, "that's why he was snooping
            around in the chaparral, instead of picking up points out of the P'fessor's game. Looky
            here—he ain't no fool, boys." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1359">"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1361">But Stillman was resuming: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1363">"While we were out yonder an hour or two ago, the owner of the gimlet and the trial
            candle took them from a place where he had concealed them—it was not a good
            place—and carried them to what he probably thought was a better one, two hundred
            yards up in the pine woods, and hid them there, covering them over with pine needles. It
            was there that I found them. The gimlet exactly fits the hole in the barrel. And
            now—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1365">The Extraordinary Man interrupted him. He said, sarcastically: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1367">"We have had a very pretty fairy tale, gentlemen—very pretty indeed. Now I would
            like to ask this young man a question or two." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1370">Some of the boys winced, and Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1372">"I'm afraid Archy's going to catch it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1374">The others lost their smiles and sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1376">"Let us proceed to examine into this fairy tale in a consecutive and orderly
            way—by geometrical progression, so to speak—linking detail to detail in a
            steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent and unassailable march upon this tinsel
            toy fortress of error, the dream fabric of a callow imagination. To begin with, young
            sir, I desire to ask you but three questions at present—<i>at
              present.</i> Did I understand you to say it was your opinion that the supposititious
            candle was lighted at about eight o'clock yesterday evening?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1381">"Yes, sir—about eight." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1383">"Could you say exactly eight?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1385">"Well, no, I couldn't be that exact." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1387">"Um. If a person had been passing along there just about that time, he would have been
            almost sure to encounter that assassin, do you think?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1389">"Yes, I should think so." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1391">"Thank you, that is all. For the present. I say, all <i>for the
              present."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1396">"Dern him. he's laying for Archy," said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1399">"It's so," said Ham Sandwich. "I don't like the look of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1401">Stillman said, glancing at the guest, "I was along there myself at half-past
            eight—no, about nine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1403">"In-deed? This is interesting—this is very interesting. Perhaps you encountered
            the assassin?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1405">"No, I encountered no one." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1407">"Ah. Then—if you will excuse the remark—I do not quite see the relevancy of
            the information." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1409">"It has none. At present. I say it has none—at present." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1411">He paused. Presently he resumed: "I did not encounter the assassin, but I am on his
            track, I am sure, for I believe he is in this room. I will ask you all to pass one by
            one in front of me—here, where there is a good light—so that I can see your
            feet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1413">A buzz of excitement swept the place, and the march began, the guest looking on with an
            iron attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified success. Stillman stooped, shaded
            his eyes with his hand, and gazed down intently at each pair of feet as it passed. Fifty
            men tramped monotonously by—with no result. Sixty. Seventy. The thing was
            beginning to look absurd. The guest remarked, with suave irony:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1415">"Stillman Accuses Sherlock Holmes"Image of Stillman pointing a finger at Sherlock Holmes</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1421">"Assassins appear to be scarce this evening." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1423">The house saw the humor if it, and refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. Ten or twelve
            more candidates tramped by—no, <i>danced </i>by, with airy and
            ridiculous capers which convulsed the spectators—then suddenly Stillman put out
            his hand and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1429">"This is the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1431">"Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhedrim!" roared the crowd; and at once let fly a
            pyrotechnic explosion and dazzle and confusion of stirring remarks inspired by the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1433">At the height of the turmoil the guest stretched out his hand, commanding peace. The
            authority of a great name and a great personality laid its mysterious compulsion upon
            the house, and it obeyed. Out of the panting calm which succeeded, the guest spoke,
            saying, with dignity and feeling: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1435"><i>"This</i> is serious. It strikes at an innocent life. Innocent
            beyond suspicion! Innocent beyond peradventure! Hear me <i>prove</i> it;
            observe how simple a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie. Listen. My
            friends, that lad was never out of my sight yesterday evening at <i>any</i> time!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1445">It made a deep impression. Men turned their eyes upon Stillman with grave inquiry in
            them. His face brightened, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1447">"I <i>knew</i> there was another one!" He stepped briskly to the table
            and glanced at the guest's feet, then up at his face, and said: "You were <i>with</i> him! You were not fifty steps from him when he lit the candle
            that by and by fired the powder!" <i>(Sensation.) "</i>And what is more,
            you furnished the matches yourself !" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1458">Plainly the guest seemed hit; it looked so to the public. He opened his mouth to speak;
            the words did not come freely. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1460">"This—er—this is insanity—this—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1462">Stillman pressed his evident advantage home. He held up a charred match. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1464">"Here <i>is</i> one of them. I found it in the barrel—and there's
              <i>another</i> one there." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1472">The guest found his voice at once. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1475"><i>"Yes—</i>and put them there yourself!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1479">It was recognized a good shot. Stillman retorted. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1481">"It is <i>wax—</i>a breed unknown to this camp. I am ready to be
            searched for the box. Are you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1486">The guest was staggered this time—the dullest eye could see it. He fumbled with
            his hands; once or twice his lips moved, but the words did not come. The house waited
            and watched, in tense suspense, the stillness adding effect to the situation. Presently
            Stillman said, gently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1488">"We are waiting for your decision." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1490">There was silence again during several moments; then the guest answered, in a low
            voice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1492">"I refuse to be searched." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1494">There was no noisy demonstration, but all about the house one voice after another
            muttered: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1496">"That settles it! He's Archy's meat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1498">What to do now? Nobody seemed to know. It was an embarrassing situation for the
            moment—merely, of course, because matters had taken such a sudden and unexpected
            turn that these unpractised minds were not prepared for it, and had come to a
            standstill, like a stopped clock, under the shock. But after a little the machinery
            began to work again, tentatively, and by twos and threes the men put their heads
            together and privately buzzed over this and that and the other proposition. One of these
            propositions met with much favor; it was, to confer upon the assassin a vote of thanks
            for removing Flint Buckner, and let him go. But the cooler heads opposed it, pointing
            out that addled brains in the Eastern states would pronounce it a scandal, and make no
            end of foolish noise about it. Finally the cool heads got the upper hand, and obtained
            general consent to a proposition of their own; their leader then called the house to
            order and stated it—to this effect: that Fetlock Jones be jailed and put upon
            trial. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1500">The motion was carried. Apparently there was nothing further to do now, and the people
            were glad, for, privately, they were impatient to get out and rush to the scene of the
            tragedy, and see whether that barrel and the other things were really there or not. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1503">But no—the break-up got a check. The surprises were not over yet. For a while
            Fetlock Jones had been silently sobbing, unnoticed in the absorbing excitements which
            had been following one another so persistently for some time; but when his arrest and
            trial were decreed, he broke out despairingly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1505">"No! it's no use. I don't want any jail, I don't want any trial; I've had all the hard
            luck I want, and all the miseries. Hang me now, and let me out! It would all come out,
            anyway—there couldn't anything save me. He has told it all, just as if he'd been
            with me and seen it—<i>I</i> don't know how he found out; and
            you'll find the barrel and things, and then I wouldn't have any chance any more. I
            killed him; and <i>you'd</i> have done it too, if he'd treated you like
            a dog, and you only a boy, and weak and poor, and not a friend to help you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1513">"And served him damned well right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. "Looky here, boys—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1515">From the constable: "Order! Order, gentlemen!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1517">A voice: "Did your uncle know what you was up to?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1519">"No, he didn't." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1521">"Did he give you the matches, sure enough?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1523">"Yes, he did; but he didn't know what I wanted them for." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1525">"When you was out on such a business as that, how did you venture to risk having him
            along—and him a <i>detective?</i> How's that?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1530">The boy hesitated, fumbled with his buttons in an embarrassed way, then said, shyly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1532">"I know about detectives, on account of having them in the family; and if you don't
            want them to find out about a thing, it's best to have them around when you do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1535">The cyclone of laughter which greeted this native discharge of wisdom did not modify
            the poor little waif's embarrassment in any large degree.</p>Chapter IX<p id="TwaDoubd1e1540">From a letter to Mrs. Stillman, dated merely "Tuesday." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1542">Fetlock Jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log cabin, and left there
              to await his trial. Constable Harris provided him with a couple of days' rations,
              instructed him to keep a good guard over himself, and promised to look in on him as
              soon as further supplies should be due. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1545">Next morning a score of us went with Hillyer, out of friendship, and helped him bury
              his late relative, the unlamented Buckner, and I acted as first assistant pall-bearer,
              Hillyer acting as chief. Just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy
              stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, limped by with his head down, and I caught the
              scent I had chased around the globe! It was the odor of Paradise to my perishing hope!
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1548">In a moment I was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder. He
              slumped to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had withered him in his tracks; and
              as the boys came running he struggled to his knees and put up his pleading hands to
              me, and out of his chattering jaws he begged me to persecute him no more, and said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1551">"You have hunted me around the world, Sherlock Holmes, yet God is my witness I have
              never done any man harm!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1554">A glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane. That was my work, mother!
              The tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery I felt in that moment, but
              nothing else can ever do it. The boys lifted him up, and gathered about him, and were
              full of pity of him, and said the gentlest and touchingest things to him, and said
              cheer up and don't be troubled, he was among friends now, and they would take care of
              him, and protect him, and hang any man that laid a hand on him. They are just like so
              many mothers, the rough mining-camp boys are, when you wake up the south side of their
              hearts; yes, and just like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up
              the opposite of that muscle. They did everything they could think of to comfort him,
              but nothing succeeded until Wells-Fargo Ferguson, who is a clever strategist, said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1557">"If it's only Sherlock Holmes that's troubling you, you needn't worry any more."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1560">"Why?" asked the forlorn lunatic, eagerly. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1563">"Because he's dead again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1566">"Dead! Dead! Oh, don't trifle with a poor wreck like me. <i>Is
              </i>he dead? On honor, now—is he telling me true, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1573">"True as you're standing there!" said Ham Sandwich, and they all backed up the
              statement in a body. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1576">"They hung him in San Bernardino last week," added Ferguson, clinching the matter,
              "whilst he was searching around after you. Mistook him for another man. They're sorry,
              but they can't help it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1579">"They're a-building him a monument," said Ham Sandwich, with the air of a person who
              had contributed to it, and knew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1582">"James Walker" drew a deep sigh—evidently a sigh of relief—and said
              nothing; but his eyes lost something of their wildness, his countenance cleared
              visibly, and its drawn look relaxed a little. We all went to our cabin, and the boys
              cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for, and while they
              were about it Hillyer and I outfitted him from hat to shoe-leather with new clothes of
              ours, and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him. "Old" is the right word,
              and a pity, too: old by the droop of him, and the frost upon his hair, and the marks
              which sorrow and distress have left upon his face; though he is only in his prime in
              the matter of years. While he ate, we smoked and chatted; and when he was finishing he
              found his voice at last, and of his own accord broke out with his personal history. I
              cannot furnish his exact words, but I will come as near it as I can. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1585">THE "WRONG MAN'S" STORY </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1588">It happened like this: I was in Denver. I had been there many years; sometimes I
              remember how many, sometimes I don't—but it isn't any matter. All of a sudden I
              got a notice to leave, or I would be exposed for a horrible crime committed long
              before—years and years before—in the East. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1591">I knew about that crime, but I was not the criminal; it was a cousin of mine of the
              same name. What should I better do? My head was all disordered by fear, and I didn't
              know. I was allowed very little time—only one day, I think it was. I would be
              ruined if I was published, and the people would lynch me, and not believe what I said.
              It is always the way with lynchings: when they find out it is a mistake they are
              sorry, but it is too late—the same as it was with Mr. Holmes, you see. So I said
              I would sell out and get money to live on, and run away until it blew over and I could
              come back with my proofs. Then I escaped in the night and went a long way off in the
              mountains somewhere, and lived disguised and had a false name. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1594">I got more and more troubled and worried, and my troubles made me see spirits and
              hear voices, and I could not think straight and clear on any subject, but got confused
              and involved and had to give it up, because my head hurt so. It got to be worse and
              worse; more spirits and more voices. They were about me all the time; at first only in
              the night, then in the day too. They were always whispering around my bed and plotting
              against me, and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out, because I got no good rest.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1597">And then came the worst. One night the whispers said, "We'll never manage, because
              we can't <i>see</i> him, and so can't point him out to the people."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1603">They sighed; then one said: "We must bring Sherlock Holmes. He can be here in twelve
              days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1606">They all agreed, and whispered and jibbered with joy. But my heart broke; for I had
              read about that man, and knew what it would be to have him upon my track, with his
              superhuman penetration and tireless energies. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1610">The spirits went away to fetch him, and I got up at once in the middle of the night
              and fled away, carrying nothing but the hand-bag that had my money in it—thirty
              thousand dollars; two-thirds of it are in the bag there yet. It was forty days before
              that man caught up on my track. I just escaped. From habit he had written his real
              name on a tavern register, but had scratched it out and written "Dagget Barclay" in
              the place of it. But fear gives you a watchful eye and keen, and I read the true name
              through the scratches, and fled like a deer. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1613">He has hunted me all over this world for three years and a half—the Pacific
              states, Australasia, India—everywhere you can think of; then back to Mexico and
              up to California again, giving me hardly any rest; but that name on the registers
              always saved me, and what is left of me is alive yet. And I am <i>so</i> tired! A cruel time he has given me, yet I give you my honor I have never
              harmed him nor any man. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1619">That was the end of the story, and it stirred those boys to bloodheat, he sure of
              it. As for me—each word burnt a hole in me where it struck. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1622">We voted that the old man should bunk with us, and be my guest and Hillyer's. I
              shall keep my own counsel, naturally; but as soon as he is well rested and nourished,
              I shall take him to Denver and rehabilitate his fortunes. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1625">The boys gave the old fellow the bone-smashing good-fellowship handshake of the
              mines, and then scattered away to spread the news. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1628">At dawn next morning Wells-Fargo Ferguson and Ham Sandwich called us softly out, and
              said, privately: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1631">"That news about the way that old stranger has been treated has spread all around,
              and the camps are up. They are piling in from everywhere, and are going to lynch the
              P'fessor. Constable Harris is in a dead funk, and has telephoned the sheriff. Come
              along!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1634">We started on a run. The others were privileged to feel as they chose, but in my
              heart's privacy I hoped the sheriff would arrive in time; for I had small desire that
              Sherlock Holmes should hang for my deeds, as you can easily believe. I had heard a
              good deal about the sheriff, but </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1637">for reassurance's sake I asked: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1640">"Can he stop a mob?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1643">"Can <i>he</i> stop a mob! Can Jack <i>Fairfax</i>
              stop a mob! Well, I should smile! Ex-desperado—nineteen scalps on his string.
              Can <i>he!</i> Oh, I <i>say!"</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1659">As we tore up the gulch, distant cries and shouts and yells rose faintly on the
              still air, and grew steadily in strength as we raced along. Roar after roar burst out,
              stronger and stronger, nearer and nearer; and at last, when we closed up upon the
              multitude massed in the open area in front of the tavern, the crash of sound was
              deafening. Some brutal roughs from Daly's gorge had Holmes in their grip, and he was
              the calmest man there; a contemptuous smile played about his lips, and if any fear of
              death was in his British heart, his iron personality was master of it and no sign of
              it was allowed to appear. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1662">"Come to a vote, men!" This from one of the Daly gang, Shadbelly Higgins. "Quick! is
              it hang, or shoot?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1665">"Neither!" shouted one of his comrades. "He'll he alive again in a week; burning's
              the only permanency for <i>him."</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1671">The gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a thundercrash of approval, and
              went struggling and surging toward the prisoner, and closed around him, shouting,
              "Fire! fire's the ticket!" They dragged him to the horse-post, backed him against it,
              chained him to it, and piled wood and pine cones around him waist-deep. Still the
              strong face did not blench, and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1674">"A match! fetch a match!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1677">Shadbelly struck it, shaded it with his hand, stooped, and held it under a pine
              cone. A deep silence fell upon the mob. The cone caught, a tiny flame flickered about
              it a moment or two. I seemed to catch the sound of distant hoofs—it grew more
              distinct—still more and more distinct, more and more definite, but the absorbed
              crowd did not appear to notice it. The match went out. The man struck another,
              stooped, and again the flame rose; this time it took hold and began to
              spread—here and there men turned away their faces. The executioner stood with
              the charred match in his fingers, watching his work. The hoof-beats turned a
              projecting crag, and now they came thundering down upon us. Almost the next moment
              there was a shout: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1680">"The sheriff!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1683">And straightway he came tearing into the midst, stood his horse almost on his hind
              feet, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1686">"Fall back, you gutter-snipes!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1689">He was obeyed. By all but their leader. He stood his ground, and his hand went to
              his revolver. The sheriff covered him promptly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1692">"Drop your hand, you parlor desperado. Kick the fire away. Now unchain the
              stranger." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1696">The parlor desperado obeyed. Then the sheriff made a speech; sitting his horse at
              martial ease, and not warming his words with any touch of fire, but delivering them in
              a measured and deliberate way, and in a tone which harmonized with their character and
              made them impressively disrespectful. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1699">"You're a nice lot—now ain't you? Just about eligible to travel with this bilk
              here—Shadbelly Higgins—this loud-mouthed sneak that shoots people in the
              back and calls himself a desperado. If there's anything I do particularly despise,
              it's a lynching mob; I've never seen one that had a man in it. It has to tally up a
              hundred against one before it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor. It's
              made up of cowards, and so is the community that breeds it; and ninety-nine times out
              of a hundred the sheriff's another one." He paused—apparently to turn that last
              idea over in his mind and taste the juice of it—then he went on: "The sheriff
              that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the lowest-down coward there is. By
              the statistics there was a hundred and eighty-two of them drawing sneak pay in America
              last year. By the way it's going, pretty soon there 'll be a new disease in the
                doctor-books—<i>sheriff complaint."</i> That idea pleased
              him—any one could see it. "People will say, 'Sheriff sick again?' 'Yes; got the
              same old thing.' And next there 'll be a new title. People won't say, 'He's running
              for sheriff of Rapaho County,' for instance; they'll say, 'He's running for Coward of
              Rapaho.' Lord, the idea of a grown-up person being afraid of a lynch mob!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1705">He turned an eye on the captive, and said, "Stranger, who are you, and what have you
              been doing?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1708">"My name is Sherlock Holmes, and I have not been doing anything." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1711">It was wonderful, the impression which the sound of that name made on the sheriff,
              notwithstanding he must have come posted. He spoke up with feeling, and said it was a
              blot on the county that a man whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their
              fame and their ingenuity, and whose histories of them had won every reader's heart by
              the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting, should be visited under the Stars
              and Stripes by an outrage like this. He apologized in the name of the whole nation,
              and made Holmes a most handsome bow, and told Constable Harris to see him to his
              quarters, and hold himself personally responsible if he was molested again. Then he
              turned to the mob and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1714">"Hunt your holes, you scum!" which they did; then he said: "Follow me, Shadbelly;
              I'll take care of your case myself. No—keep your popgun; whenever I see the day
              that I'll be afraid to have you behind me with that thing, it 'll be time for me to
              join last year's hundred and eighty-two"; and he rode off in a walk, Shadbelly
              following. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1717">When we were on our way back to our cabin, toward breakfast-time, we ran upon the
              news that Fetlock Jones had escaped from his lock-up in the night and is gone! Nobody
              is sorry. Let his uncle track him out if he likes; it is in his line; the camp is not
              interested.</p>Chapter X<p id="TwaDoubd1e1723"><i>Ten days later.</i>

            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1736">As we were starting, this morning, Hillyer whispered to me: "Keep this news from

There has been a
            wedding, between a handsome young man of slender means and a rich young girl—a
            case of love at first sight and a precipitate marriage; a marriage bitterly opposed by
            the girl's widowed father. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e140">Jacob Fuller, the bridegroom, is twenty-six years old, is of an old but unconsidered
            family which had by compulsion emigrated from Sedgemoor, and for King James's purse's
            profit, so everybody said—some maliciously the rest merely because they believed
            it. The bride is nineteen and beautiful. She is intense, high-strung, romantic,
            immeasurably proud of her Cavalier blood, and passionate in her love for her young
            husband. For its sake she braved her father's displeasure, endured his reproaches,
            listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions and went from his house
            without his blessing, proud and happy in the proofs she was thus giving of the quality
            of the affection which had made its home in her heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e142">The morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her. Her husband put aside
            her proffered caresses, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e144">"Sit down. I have something to say to you. I loved you. That was before I asked your
            father to give you to me. His refusal is not my grievance—I could have endured
            that. But the things he said of me to you—that is a different matter.
            There—you needn't speak; I know quite well what they were; I got them from
            authentic sources. Among other things he said that my character was written in my face;
            that I was treacherous, a dissembler, a coward, and a brute without sense of pity or
            compassion: the 'Sedgemoor trade-mark,' he called it—and 'white-sleeve badge.' Any
            other man in my place would have gone to his house and shot him down like a dog. I
            wanted to do it, and was minded to do it, but a better thought came to me: to put him to
            shame; to break his heart; to kill him by inches. How to do it? Through my treatment of
            you, his idol! I would marry you; and then—Have patience. You will see. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e146">From that moment onward, for three months, the young wife suffered all the
            humiliations, all the insults, all the miseries that the diligent and inventive mind of
            the husband could contrive, save physical injuries only. Her strong pride stood by her,
            and she kept the secret of her troubles. Now and then the husband said, "Why don't you
            go to your father and tell him?" Then he invented new tortures, applied them, and asked
            again. She always answered, "He shall never know by my mouth," and taunted him with his
            origin; said she was the lawful slave of a scion of slaves, and must obey, and
            would—up to that point, but no further; he could kill her if he liked, but he
            could not break her; it was not in the Sedgemoor breed to do it. At the end of the three
            months he said, with a dark significance in his manner, "I have tried all things but
            one"—and waited for her reply. "Try that," she said, and curled her lip in
            mockery. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e148">That night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes, then said to her: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e150">"Get up and dress!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e152">She obeyed—as always, without a word. He led her half a mile from the house, and
            proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public road; and succeeded, she
            screaming and struggling. He gagged her then, struck her across the face with his
            cowhide, and set his bloodhounds on her. They tore the clothes off her, and she was
            naked. He called the dogs off, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e154">"You will be found—by the passing public. They will be dropping along about three
            hours from now, and will spread the news—do you hear? Good-by. You have seen the
            last of me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e156">He went away then. She moaned to herself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e159">"I shall bear a child—to <i>him!</i> God grant it may be a boy!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e164">The farmers released her by and by—and spread the news, which was natural. They
            raised the country with lynching intentions, but the bird had flown. The young wife shut
            herself up in her father's house; he shut himself up with her, and thenceforth would see
            no one. His pride was broken, and his heart; so he wasted away, day by day, and even his
            daughter rejoiced when death relieved him. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e166">Then she sold the estate and disappeared.</p>Chapter 2<p id="TwaDoubd1e171">In 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded New England village,
            with no company but a little boy about five years old. She did her own work, she
            discouraged acquaintanceships, and had none. The butcher, the baker, and the others that
            served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was
            Stillman, and that she called the child Archy. Whence she came they had not been able to
            find out, but they said she talked like a Southerner. The child had no playmates and no
            comrade, and no teacher but the mother. She taught him diligently and intelligently, and
            was satisfied with the results—even a little proud of them. One day Archy said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e173">"Mamma, am I different from other children?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e175">"Well, I suppose not. Why?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e177">"There was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had been by and I
            said yes, and she said how long since I saw him and I said I hadn't seen him at all, and
            she said how did I know he'd been by, then, and I said because I smelt his track on the
            sidewalk, and she said I was a dum fool and made a mouth at me. What did she do that
            for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e179">The young woman turned white, and said to herself, "It's a birth mark! The gift of the
            bloodhound is in him." She snatched the boy to her breast and hugged him passionately,
            saying, "God has appointed the way!" Her eyes were burning with a fierce light, and her
            breath came short and quick with excitement. She said to herself: "The puzzle is solved
            now; many a time it has been a mystery to me, the impossible things the child has done
            in the dark, but it is all clear to me now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e181">She set him in his small chair, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e183">"Wait a little till I come, dear; then we will talk about the matter." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e185">She went up to her room and took from her dressing-table several small articles and put
            them out of sight: a nail-file on the floor under the bed; a pair of nail-scissors under
            the bureau; a small ivory paper-knife under the wardrobe. Then she returned, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e187">"There! I have left some things which I ought to have brought down." She named them,
            and said, "Run up and bring them, dear." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e189">The child hurried away on his errand and was soon back again with the things. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e192">"Did you have any difficulty, dear?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e194">"No, mamma; I only went where you went." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e196">During his absence she had stepped to the bookcase, taken several books from the bottom
            shelf, opened each, passed her hand over a page, noting its number in her memory, then
            restored them to their places. Now she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e198">"I have been doing something while you have been gone, Archy. Do you think you can find
            out what it was?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e200">The boy went to the bookcase and got out the books that had been touched, and opened
            them at the pages which had been stroked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e202">The mother took him in her lap, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e204">"I will answer your question now, dear. I have found out that in one way you are quite
            different from other people. You can see in the dark, you can smell what other people
            cannot, you have the talents of a bloodhound. They are good and valuable things to have,
            but you must keep the matter a secret. If people found it out, they would speak of you
            as an odd child, a strange child, and children would be disagreeable to you, and give
            you nicknames. In this world one must be like everybody else if he doesn't want to
            provoke scorn or envy or jealousy. It is a great and fine distinction which has been
            born to you, and I am glad; but you will keep it a secret, for mamma's sake, won't you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e206">The child promised, without understanding. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e208">All the rest of the day the mother's brain was busy with excited thinkings; with plans,
            projects, schemes, each and all of them uncanny, grim, and dark. Yet they lit up her
            face; lit it with a fell light of their own; lit it with vague fires of hell. She was in
            a fever of unrest; she could not sit, stand, read, sew; there was no relief for her but
            in movement. She tested her boy's gift in twenty ways, and kept saying to herself all
            the time, with her mind in the past: "He broke my father's heart, and night and day all
            these years I have tried, and all in vain, to think out a way to break his. I have found
            it now—I have found it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e210">When night fell, the demon of unrest still possessed her. She went on with her tests;
            with a candle she traversed the house from garret to cellar, hiding pins, needles,
            thimbles, spools, under pillows, under carpets, in cracks in the walls, under the coal
            in the bin; then sent the little fellow in the dark to find them; which he did, and was
            happy and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e212">From this time forward life took on a new complexion for her. She said, "The future is
            secure—I can wait, and enjoy the waiting." The most of her lost interests revived.
            She took up music again, and languages, drawing, painting, and the other long-discarded
            delights of her maidenhood. She was happy once more, and felt again the zest of life. As
            the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy, and was contented with it.
            Not altogether, but nearly that. The soft side of his heart was larger than the other
            side of it. It was his only defect, in her eyes. But she considered that his love for
            her and worship of her made up for it. He was a good hater—that was well; but it
            was a question if the materials of his hatreds were of as tough and enduring a quality
            as those of his friendships—and that was not so well. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e215">The years drifted on. Archy was become a handsome, shapely, athletic youth, courteous,
            dignified, companionable, pleasant in his ways, and looking perhaps a trifle older than
            he was, which was sixteen. One evening his mother said she had something of grave
            importance to say to him, adding that he was old enough to hear it now, and old enough
            and possessed of character enough and stability enough to carry out a stern plan which
            she had been for years contriving and maturing. Then she told him her bitter story, in
            all its naked atrociousness. For a while the boy was paralyzed; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e217">"I understand. We are Southerners; and by our custom and nature there is but one
            atonement. I will search him out and kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e219">"Kill him? No! Death is release, emancipation; death is a favor. Do I owe him favors?
            You must not hurt a hair of his head." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e221">The boy was lost in thought awhile; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e223">"You are all the world to me, and your desire is my law and my pleasure. Tell me what
            to do and I will do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e225">The mother's eyes beamed with satisfaction, and she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e227">"You will go and find him. I have known his hiding-place for eleven years; it cost me
            five years and more of inquiry, and much money, to locate it. He is a quartz-miner in
            Colorado, and well-to-do. He lives in Denver. His name is Jacob Fuller. There—it
            is the first time I have spoken it since that unforgettable night. Think! That name
            could have been yours if I had not saved you that shame and furnished you a cleaner one.
            You will drive him from that place; you will hunt him down and drive him again; and yet
            again, and again, and again, persistently, relentlessly, poisoning his life, filling it
            with mysterious terrors, loading it with weariness and misery, making him wish for
            death, and that he had a suicide's courage; you will make of him another Wandering Jew;
            he shall know no rest any more, no peace of mind, no placid sleep; you shall shadow him,
            cling to him, persecute him, till you break his heart, as he broke my father's and
            mine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e229">"I will obey, mother." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e231">"I believe it, my child. The preparations are all made; everything is ready. Here is a
            letter of credit; spend freely, there is no lack of money. At times you may need
            disguises. I have provided them; also some other conveniences." She took from the drawer
            of the typewriter-table several squares of paper. They all bore these typewritten
            words:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e233"><i>$10,000 REWARD</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e237"><i>It is believed that a certain man who is wanted in an Eastern
                state is sojourning here. In 1880, in the night, he tied his young wife to a tree by
                the public road, cut her across the face with a cowhide, and made his dogs tear her
                clothes from her, leaving her naked. He left her there, and fled the country. A

                address.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e242">"When you have found him and acquainted yourself with his scent, you will go in the
            night and placard one of these upon the building he occupies, and another one upon the
            post-office or in some other prominent place. It will be the talk of the region. At
            first you must give him several days in which to force a sale of his belongings at
            something approaching their value. We will ruin him by and by, but gradually; we must
            not impoverish him at once, for that could bring him to despair and injure his health,
            possibly kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e244">She took three or four more typewritten forms from the
            drawer—duplicates—and read one:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e246">. . . . . . . . . ., . . . . . . . . . ., 18. . . .</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e249"><i>To Jacob Fuller:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e253"><i>You have . . . . . . days in which to settle your affairs. You

                after the named hour, I will placard you on all the dead walls, detailing your crime

                including your own. Have no fear of bodily injury—it will in no circumstances
                ever be inflicted upon you. You brought misery upon an old man, and ruined his life

That is sure."</p>Chapter III<p id="TwaDoubd1e275">Extracts from letters to the mother:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e277">DENVER, <i>April 3, 1897</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e282"><i>I have now been living several days in the same hotel with Jacob
                Fuller. I have his scent; I could track him through ten divisions of infantry and
                find him. I have often been near him and heard him talk. He owns a good mine, and
                has a fair income from it; but he is not rich. He learned mining in a good
                way—by working at it for wages. He is a cheerful creature, and his forty-three
                years sit lightly upon him; he could pass for a younger man—say thirty-six or
                thirty-seven. He has never married again—passes himself off for a widower. He
                stands well, is liked, is popular, and has many friends. Even I feel a drawing
                toward him—the paternal blood in me making its claim. How blind and
                unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature—the most of them, in
                fact! My task is become hard now—you realize it? you comprehend, and make
                allowances?—and the fire of it has cooled, more than I like to confess to
                myself, But I will carry it out. Even with the pleasure paled, the duty remains, and
                I will not spare him.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e286"><i>And for my help, a sharp resentment rises in me when I reflect
                that he who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not suffered by it.
                The lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character, and in the change he is
                happy. He, the guilty party, is absolved from all suffering; you, the innocent, are
                borne down with it. But be comforted—he shall harvest his share.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e290">SILVER GULCH, <i>May 19</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e295"><i>I placarded Form No. 1 at midnight of April 3; an hour later I
                slipped Form No. 2 under his chamber door, notifying him to leave Denver at or
                before 11.50 the night of the 14th.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e299"><i>Some late bird of a reporter stole one of my placards, then hunted
                the town over and found the other one, and stole that. In this manner he
                accomplished what the profession call a "scoop"—that is, he got a valuable
                item, and saw to it that no other paper got it. And so his paper—the principal
                one in the town—had it in glaring type on the editorial page in the morning,
                followed by a Vesuvian opinion of our wretch a column long, which wound up by adding
                a thousand dollars to our reward on the paper's account! The journals out here know
                how to do the noble thing—when there's business in it.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e303"><i>At breakfast I occupied my usual seat—selected because it
                afforded a view of papa Fuller's face, and was near enough for me to hear the talk
                that went on at his table. Seventy-five or a hundred people were in the room, and
                all discussing that item, and saying they hoped the seeker would find that rascal
                and remove the pollution of his presence from the town—with a rail, or a
                bullet, or something.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e307"><i>When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leave—folded
                up—in one hand, and the newspaper in the other; and it gave me more than half
                a pang to see him. His cheerfulness was all gone, and he looked old and pinched and
                ashy. And then—only think of the things he had to listen to! Mamma, he heard
                his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and characterizations drawn
                from the very dictionaries and phrase-books of Satan's own authorized editions down
                below. And more than that, he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them. His
                applause tasted bitter in his mouth, though; he could not disguise that from me; and
                it was observable that his appetite was gone; he only nibbled; he couldn't eat.
                Finally a man said:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e311"><i>"It is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing
                what this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel. I hope so."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e316"><i>Ah, dear, it was pitiful the way Fuller winced, and glanced around
                scared! He couldn't endure any more, and got up and left.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e320"><i>During several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in
                Mexico, and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could, and give the
                property his personal attention. He played his cards well; said he would take
                $40,000—a quarter in cash, the rest in safe notes; but that as he greatly
                needed money on account of his new purchase, he would diminish his terms for cash in
                full, He sold out for $30,000. And then, what do you think he did? He asked for
                greenbacks, and took them, saying the man in Mexico was a New-Englander, with a head
                full of crotchets, and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts. People thought it
                queer, since a draft on New York could produce greenbacks quite conveniently. There
                was talk of this odd thing, but only for a day; that is as long as any topic lasts
                in Denver.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e324"><i>I was watching, all the time. As soon as the sale was completed
                and the money paid—which was on the 11th—I began to stick to Fuller's
                track without dropping it for a moment. That night—no, 12th, for it was a
                little past midnight—I tracked him to his room, which was four doors from mine
                in the same hall; then I went back and put on my muddy day-laborer disguise,
                darkened my complexion, and sat down in my room in the gloom, with a gripsack handy,
                with a change in it, and my door ajar. For I suspected that the bird would take wing
                now. In half an hour an old woman passed by, carrying a grip: I caught the familiar
                whiff, and followed with my grip, for it was Fuller. He left the hotel by a side
                entrance, and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three
                blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness, and got into a two-horse hack, which of
                course was waiting for him by appointment. I took a seat (uninvited) on the trunk
                platform behind, and we drove briskly off. We drove ten miles, and the hack stopped
                at a way-station and was discharged. Fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow
                under the awning, as far as he could get from the light; I went inside, and watched
                the ticket-office. Fuller bought no ticket; I bought none. Presently the train came
                along, and he boarded a car; I entered the same car at the other end, and came down
                the aisle and took the seat behind him. When he paid the conductor and named his
                objective point, I dropped back several seats, while the conductor was changing a
                bill, and when he came to me I paid to the same place—about a hundred miles
                westward.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e328"><i>From that time for a week on end he led me a dance. He traveled
                here and there and yonder—always on a general westward trend—but he boas
                not a woman after the first day. He was a laborer, like myself, and wore bushy false
                whiskers. His outfit was perfect, and he could do the character without thinking
                about it, for he had served the trade for wages. His nearest friend could not have
                recognized him. At last he located himself here, the obscurest little mountain camp
                in Montana; he has a shanty, and goes out prospecting daily; is gone all day, and
                avoids society. I am living at a miner's boardinghouse, and it is an awful place:
                the bunks, the food, the dirt—everything.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e332"><i>We have been here four weeks, and in that time I have seen him but
                once; but every night I go over his track and post myself. As soon as he engaged a
                shanty here I went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed that Denver hotel to
                keep my baggage till I should send for it. I need nothing here but a change of army
                shirts, and I brought that with me.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e336">SILVER GULCH, <i>June 12</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e341"><i>The Denver episode has never found its way here, I think. I know
                the most of the men in camp, and they have never referred to it, at least in my
                hearing. Fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions. He has located a
                claim, two miles away, in an out-of-the-way place in the mountains; it promises very
                well, and he is working it diligently. Ah, but the change in him! He never smiles,
                and he keeps quite to himself, consorting with no one—he who was so fond of
                company and so cheery only two months ago. I have seen him passing along several
                times recently—drooping, forlorn, the spring gone from his step, a pathetic

                and edible food, and endurable beds, and bodily decency; then I will fetch my

                year before you were married; and the documents to prove it are innumerable. Last

                with the loss upon his mine made good; and there will be a banquet, and a

                sustained in a certain matter." Do you see? He would think it a trap. Well, any one
                would. If I should say, "It is now known that he was not the man wanted, but another
                man—a man who once bore the same name, but discarded it for good
                reasons"—would that answer? But the Denver people would wake up then and say
                "Oho!" and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks, and say, "Why did he
                run away if he wasn't the right man?—it is too thin." If I failed to find him

                mistake; a dog would have gone the other way. But I am only part dog, and can get
                very humanly stupid when excited. He had been stopping in that house ten days; I
                almost know, now, that he stops long nowhere, the past six or eight months, but is
                restless and has to keep moving. I understand that feeling! and I know what it is to
                feel it. He still uses the name he had registered when I came so near catching him
                nine months ago—"James Walker"; doubtless the same he adopted when he fled
                from Silver Gulch. An unpretending man, and has small taste for fancy names. I
                recognized the hand easily, through its slight disguise. A square man, and not good

                Hope Cañon; I traced him to a point thirty miles from here, but there I lost
                the trail; some one gave him a lift in a wagon, I suppose. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e463"><i>I am taking a rest, now—modified by searchings for the lost
                trail. I was tired to death, mother, and low-spirited, and sometimes coming
                uncomfortably near to losing hope; but the miners in this little camp are good
                fellows, and I am used to their sort this long time back; and their breezy ways
                freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles. I have been here a month. I am
                cabining with a young fellow named "Sammy" Hillyer, about twenty-five, the only son
                of his mother—like me—and loves her dearly, and writes to her every
                week—part of which is like me. He is a timid body, and in the matter of
                intellect—well, he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire; but no
                matter, he is well liked; he is good and fine, and it is meat and bread and rest and
                luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again. I wish "James Walker"
                could have it. He had friends; he liked company. That brings up that picture of him,
                the time that I saw him last. The pathos of it! It comes before me often and often.
                At that very time, poor thing, I was girding up my conscience to make him move on
                again!</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e467"><i>Hillyer's heart is better than mine, better than anybody's in the
                community, I suppose, for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the
                camp—Flint Buckner—and the only man Flint ever talks with or allows to
                talk with him. He says he knows Flint's history, and that it is trouble that has
                made him what he is, and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can. Now
                none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a lodger like Flint
                Buckner, from all I hear about him outside. I think that this one detail will give
                you a better idea of Sammy's character than any labored-out description I could
                furnish you of him. In one of our talks he said something about like this: "Flint is
                a kinsman of mine, and he pours out all his troubles to me—empties his breast
                from time to time, or I reckon it would burst. There couldn't be any unhappier man,
                Archy Stillman; his life had been made up of misery of mind—he isn't near as
                old as he looks. He has lost the feel of reposefulness and peace—oh, years and
                years ago! He doesn't know what good luck is—never has had any; often says he
                wishes he was in the other hell, he is so tired of this one."</i></p>Chapter IV<p id="TwaDoubd1e474"><i>No real gentleman will tell the naked truth in the presence of
              ladies.</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e478">It was a crisp and spicy morning in early October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with
            the glory-fires of autumn, hung burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge
            provided by kind Nature for the wingless wild things that have their homes in the
            tree-tops and would visit together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and
            yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the
            sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere;
            far in he empty sky a solitary esophagus[1] slept upon motionless
            wing; everywhere brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e483">October is the time—1900; Hope Cañon is the place, a silver-mining camp
            away down in the Esmeralda region. It is a secluded spot, high and remote; recent as to
            discovery; thought by its occupants to be rich in metal—a year or two's
            prospecting will decide that matter one way or the other. For inhabitants, the camp has
            about two hundred miners, one white woman and child, several Chinese washermen, five
            squaws, and a dozen vagrant buck Indians in rabbit-skin robes, battered plug hats, and
            tin-can necklaces. There are no mills as yet; no church, no newspaper. The camp has
            existed but two years; it has made no big strike; the world is ignorant of its name and
            place. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e485">On both sides of the cañon the mountains rise wall-like, three thousand feet,
            and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the
            sun only once a day, when he sails over at noon. The village is a couple of miles long;
            the cabins stand well apart from each other. The tavern is the only "frame"
            house—the only house, one might say. It occupies a central position, and is the
            evening resort of the population. They drink there, and play seven-up and dominoes; also
            billiards, for there is a table, crossed all over with torn places repaired with
            court-plaster; there are some cues, but no leathers; some chipped balls which clatter
            when they run, and do not slow up gradually, but stop suddenly and sit down; there is a
            part of a cube of chalk, with a projecting jag of flint in it; and the man who can score
            six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bar's expense. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e487">Flint Buckner's cabin was the last one of the village, going south; his silver-claim
            was at the other end of the village, northward, and a little beyond the last hut in that
            direction. He was a sour creature, unsociable, and had no companionships. People who had
            tried to get acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him. His history was not
            known. Some believed that Sammy Hillyer knew it; others said no. If asked, Hillyer said
            no, he was not acquainted with it. Flint had a meek English youth of sixteen or
            seventeen with him, whom he treated roughly, both in public and in private; and of
            course this lad was applied to for information, but with no success. Fetlock
            Jones—name of the youth—said that Flint picked him up on a prospecting
            tramp, and as he had neither home nor friends in America, he had found it wise to stay
            and take Buckner's hard usage for the sake of the salary, which was bacon and beans.
            Further than this he could offer no testimony. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e489">Fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now, and under his meek exterior he was
            slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and humiliations which his master had put
            upon him. For the meek suffer bitterly from these hurts; more bitterly, perhaps, than do
            the manlier sort, who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the limit of
            endurance has been reached. Good-hearted people wanted to help Fetlock out of his
            trouble, and tried to get him to leave Buckner; but the boy showed fright at the
            thought, and said he "dasn't." Pat Riley urged him, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e491">"You leave the damned hunks and come with me; don't you be afraid. I'll take care of
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e496">The boy thanked him with tears in his eyes, but shuddered and said he "dasn't risk it";
            he said Flint would catch him alone, some time, in the night, and then—"Oh, it
            makes me sick, Mr. Riley, to think of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e498">Others said, "Run away from him; we'll stake you; skip out for the coast some night."
            But all these suggestions failed; he said Flint would hunt him down and fetch him back,
            just for meanness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e500">The people could not understand this. The boy's miseries went steadily on, week after
            week. It is quite likely that the people would have understood if they had known how he
            was employing his spare time. He slept in an out-cabin near Flint's; and there, nights,
            he nursed his bruises and his humiliations, and studied and studied over a single
            problem—how he could murder Flint Buckner and not be found out. It was the only
            joy he had in life; these hours were the only ones in the twenty-four which he looked
            forward to with eagerness and spent in happiness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e503">He thought of poison. No—that would not serve; the inquest would reveal where it
            was procured and who had procured it. He thought of a shot in the back in a lonely place
            when Flint would be homeward bound at midnight—his unvarying hour for the trip.
            No—somebody might be near, and catch him. He thought of stabbing him in his sleep.
            No—he might strike an inefficient blow, and Flint would seize him. He examined a
            hundred different ways—none of them would answer; for in even the very obscurest
            and secretest of them there was always the fatal defect of a <i>risk,</i> a chance, a possibility that he might be found out. He would have none of
            that. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e508">But he was patient, endlessly patient. There was no hurry, he said to himself. He would
            never leave Flint till he left him a corpse; there was no hurry—he would find the
            way. It was somewhere, and he would endure shame and pain and misery until he found it.
            Yes, somewhere there was a way which would leave not a trace, not even the faintest clue
            to the murderer—there was no hurry—he would find that way, and
            then—oh, then, it would just be good to be alive! Meantime he would diligently
            keep up his reputation for meekness; and also, as always theretofore, he would allow no
            one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about his oppressor. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e510">Two days before the before-mentioned October morning Flint had bought some things, and
            he and Fetlock had brought them home to Flint's cabin: a fresh box of candles, which
            they put in the corner; a tin can of blasting-powder, which they placed upon the
            candle-box; a keg of blasting-powder, which they placed under Flint's bunk; a huge coil
            of fuse, which they hung on a peg. Fetlock reasoned that Flint's mining operations had
            outgrown the pick, and that blasting was about to begin now. He had seen blasting done,
            and he had a notion of the process, but he had never helped in it. His conjecture was
            right—blasting-time had come. In the morning the pair carried fuse, drills, and
            the powder-can to the shaft; it was now eight feet deep, and to get into it and out of
            it a short ladder was used. They descended, and by command Fetlock held the
            drill—without any instructions as to the right way to hold it—and Flint
            proceeded to strike. The sledge came down; the drill sprang out of Fetlock's hand,
            almost as a matter of course. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e512">"You mangy son of a nigger, is that any way to hold a drill? Pick it up! Stand it up!
            There—hold fast. D— you! <i>I'll</i> teach you!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e517">At the end of an hour the drilling was finished. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e519">"Now, then, charge it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e521">The boy started to pour in the powder. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e523">"Idiot!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e525">A heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e527">"Get up! You can't lie sniveling there. Now, then, stick in the fuse <i>first. Now</i> put in the powder. Hold on, hold on! Are you going to fill the hole
              <i>all</i> up? Of all the sap-headed milksops I—Put in some
            dirt! Put in some gravel! Tamp it down! Hold on, hold on! Oh, great Scott! get out of
            the way!" He snatched the iron and tamped the charge himself, meantime cursing and
            blaspheming like a fiend. Then he fired the fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and ran
            fifty yards away, Fetlock following. They stood waiting a few minutes, then a great
            volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion; after a
            little there was a shower of descending stones; then all was serene again. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e535">"I wish to God you'd been in it!" remarked the master. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e538">They went down the shaft, cleaned it out, drilled another hole, and put in another
            charge. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e540">"Look here! How much fuse are you proposing to waste? Don't you know how to time a
            fuse?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e542">"No, sir." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e544">"You <i>don't!</i> Well, if you don't beat anything <i>I</i> ever saw!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e552">He climbed out of the shaft and spoke down: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e554">"Well, idiot, are you going to be all day? Cut the fuse and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e556">The trembling creature began: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e558">"If you please, sir, I—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e560">"You talk back to <i>me?</i> Cut it and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e565">The boy cut and lit. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e567">"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! I wish you were in—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e570">In his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft and ran. The boy was aghast. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e572">"Oh, my God! Help. Help! Oh, save me!" he implored. "Oh, what can I do! What <i>can</i> I do!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e577">He backed against the wall as tightly as he could; the sputtering fuse frightened the
            voice out of him; his breath stood still; he stood gazing and impotent; in two seconds,
            three seconds, four he would be flying toward the sky torn to fragments. Then he had an
            inspiration. He sprang at the fuse; severed the inch of it that was left above ground,
            and was saved. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e579">He sank down limp and half lifeless with fright, his strength gone; but he muttered
            with a deep joy: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e581">"He has learnt me! I knew there was a way, if I would wait." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e583">After a matter of five minutes Buckner stole to the shaft, looking worried and uneasy,
            and peered down into it. He took in the situation; he saw what had happened. He lowered
            the ladder, and the boy dragged himself weakly up it. He was very white. His appearance
            added something to Buckner's uncomfortable state, and he said, with a show of regret and
            sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from lack of practice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e585">"It was an accident, you know. Don't say anything about it to anybody; I was excited,
            and didn't notice what I was doing. You're not looking well; you've worked enough for
            to-day; go down to my cabin and eat what you want, and rest. It's just an accident, you
            know, on account of my being excited." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e587">"It scared me," said the lad, as he started away; "but I learnt something, so I don't
            mind it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e589">"Damned easy to please!" muttered Buckner, following him with his eye. I wonder if
            he'll tell? Mightn't he?... I wish it <i>had</i> killed him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e594">The boy took no advantage of his holiday in the matter of resting; he employed it in
            work, eager and feverish and happy work. A thick growth of chaparral extended down the
            mountainside clear to Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's labor was done in the dark
            intricacies of that stubborn growth; the rest of it was done in his own shanty. At last
            all was complete, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e596">"If he's got any suspicions that I'm going to tell on him, he won't keep them long,
            to-morrow. He will see that I am the same milksop as I always was—all day and the
            next. And the day after to-morrow night there 'll be an end of him; nobody will ever
            guess who finished him up nor how it was done. He dropped me the idea his own self, and
            that's odd."</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e602"> From the Springfield <i>Republican,</i> April 12, 1902.</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e607">To the Editor of the
                  Republican:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e610"><i>One of your citizens has asked me a
                  question about the "esophagus," and I wish to answer him through you. This in the
                  hope that the answer will get around, and save me some penmanship, for I have
                  already replied to the same question more than several times, and am not getting
                  as much holiday as I ought to have.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e614"><i>I
                  published a short story lately, and it was in that that I put the esophagus. I
                  will say privately that I expected it to bother some people—in fact, that
                  was the intention—but the harvest has been larger than I was calculating
                  upon. The esophagus has gathered in the guilty and the innocent alike, whereas I
                  was only fishing for the innocent—the innocent and confiding. I knew a few
                  of these would write and ask me; that would give me but little trouble; but, I was
                  not expecting that the wise and the learned would call upon me for succor.
                  However, that has happened, and it is time for me to speak up and stop the
                  inquiries if I can, for letter-writing is not restful to me, and I am not having
                  so much fun out of this thing as I counted on. That you may understand the
                  situation, I will insert a couple of sample inquiries. The first is from a public
                  instructor in the Philippines: </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e618">SANTA CRUZ, <i>Ilocos, Sur, P. I. </i><br><i>February 13,
                  1902</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e626"><i>My dear Sir,—I have just been
                  reading the first part of your latest story, entitled "A Double-barreled Detective
                  Story," and am very much delighted with it. In Part IV, page 264,</i> Harper's
                Magazine <i>for January, occurs this passage: "far in the empty sky a
                  solitary 'esophagus' slept upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness,
                  serenity, and the peace of God." Now, there is one word I do not understand,
                  namely, "esophagus." My only work of reference is the</i> Standard Dictionary,
                  <i>but that fails to explain the meaning. If you can spare the
                  time, I would be glad to have the meaning cleared up, as I consider the passage a
                  very touching and beautiful one. It may seem foolish to you, but consider my lack
                  of means away out in the northern part of Luzon.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e636"><i>Yours very truly.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e640"><i>Do you notice?
                  Nothing in the paragraph disturbed him but that one word. It shows that the
                  paragraph was most ably constructed for the deception it was intended to put upon
                  the reader. It was my intention that it should read plausibly, and it is now plain
                  that it does; it was my intention that it should be emotional and touching, and
                  you see, yourself, that it fetched this public instructor. Alas, If I had but left
                  that one treacherous word out, I should have scored! scored everywhere; and the
                  paragraph would have slidden through every reader's sensibilities like oil, and
                  left not a suspicion behind.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e644"><i>The other sample
                  inquiry is from a professor in a New England university. It contains one naughty
                  word (which I cannot bear to suppress), but he is not in the theological
                  department, so it is no harm:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e648"><i>Dear Mr.
                  Clemens: "Far in the empty sky a "solitary esophagus slept upon motionless
                  wing."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e653"><i>It is not often I get a chance to read
                  much periodical literature, but I have just gone through at this belated period,
                  with much gratification and edification, your "Double-barreled Detective
                  Story."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e657"><i>But what in hell is an esophagus? I
                  keep one myself, but it never sleeps in the air or anywhere else. My profession is
                  to deal with words, and esophagus interested me the moment I lighted upon it. But
                  as a companion of my youth used to say, "I'll be eternally, co-eternally cussed"
                  if l can make it out. Is it a joke, or I an ignoramus?</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e661"><i>Between you and me, I was almost ashamed of having fooled that man,
                  but for pride's sake I was not going to say so. I wrote and told him it was a
                  joke—and that is what I am now saying to my Springfield inquirer. And I told
                  him to carefully read the whole paragraph, and he would find not a vestige of
                  sense in any detail of it. This also I commend to my Springfield
                inquirer.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e665"><i>I have confessed. I am
                  sorry—partially. I will not do so any more—for the present. Don't ask
                  me any more questions; let the esophagus have a rest—on his same old
                  motionless wing. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e669">MARK TWAIN</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e672">New York City, <i>April 10, 1902</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e677"><i>( Editorial

                  appeared in</i> Harper's Magazine <i>for January and February
                  last, is the most elaborate of burlesques on detective fiction, with striking
                  melodramatic passages in which it is difficult to detect the deception, so ably is
                  it done. But the illusion ought not to endure even the first incident in the
                  February number. As for the paragraph which has so admirably illustrated the skill
                  of Mr. Clemens's ensemble and the carelessness of readers, here it
              is:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e688"><i>"It was a crisp and spicy morning in early
                  October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung
                  burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind nature for
                  the wingless wild things that have their home in the tree-tops and would visit
                  together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow flames in
                  brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the sensuous
                  fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere; far
                  in the empty sky a solitary esophagus slept upon motionless wings; everywhere
                  brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e692"><i>The success of Mark Twain's joke recalls to mind his story of the
                  petrified man in the cavern, whom he described most punctiliously, first giving a
                  picture of the scene, its impressive solitude, and all that; then going on to
                  describe the majesty of the figure, casually mentioning that the thumb of his
                  right hand rested against the side of his nose; then after further description
                  observing that the fingers of the right hand were extended in a radiating fashion;
                  and, recurring to the dignified attitude and position of the man, incidentally
                  remarked that the thumb of the left hand was in contact with the little finger of
                  the right—and so on. But was it so ingeniously written that Mark, relating
                  the history years later in an article which appeared in that excellent magazine of
                  the past, the</i> Galaxy, <i>declared that no one ever found out
                  the joke, and, if we remember aright, that that astonishing old mockery was
                  actually looked for in the region where he, as a Nevada newspaper editor, had
                  located it. It is certain that Mark Twain's jumping frog has a good many more
                  "pints" than any other frog.</i></p>Chapter V<p id="TwaDoubd1e702">The next day came and went. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e704">It is now almost midnight, and in five minutes the new morning will begin. The scene is
            in the tavern billiard-room. Rough men in rough clothing, slouch-hats, breeches stuffed
            into boot-tops, some with vests, none with coats, are grouped about the boiler-iron
            stove, which has ruddy cheeks and is distributing a grateful warmth; the billiard-balls
            are clacking; there is no other sound—that is, within; the wind is fitfully
            moaning without. The men look bored; also expectant. A hulking broad-shouldered miner,
            of middle age, with grizzled whiskers, and an unfriendly eye set in an unsociable face,
            rises, slips a coil of fuse upon his arm, gathers up some other personal properties, and
            departs without word or greeting to anybody. It is Flint Buckner. As the door closes
            behind him a buzz of talk breaks out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e706">"The regularest man that ever was," said Jake Parker, the blacksmith: "you can tell
            when it's twelve just by him leaving, without looking at your Waterbury." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e708">"And it's the only virtue he's got, as fur as I know," said Peter Hawes, miner. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e710">"He's just a blight on this society," said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "If I was
            running this shop I'd make him say something, <i>some</i> time or other,
            or vamos the ranch." This with a suggestive glance at the barkeeper, who did not choose
            to see it, since the man under discussion was a good customer, and went home pretty well
            set up, every night, with refreshments furnished from the bar. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e715">"Say," said Ham Sandwich, miner, "does any of you boys ever recollect of him asking you
            to take a drink?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e717"><i>"Him?</i> Flint <i>Buckner?</i> Oh, Laura!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e724">This sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous general outburst in one form of words or
            another from the crowd. After a brief silence, Pat Riley, miner, said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e726">"He's the 15-puzzle, that cuss. And his boy's another one. <i>I
            </i>can't make them out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e731">"Nor anybody else," said Ham Sandwich; "and if they are 15-puzzles how are you going to
            rank up that other one? When it comes to A 1 right-down solid mysteriousness, he lays
            over both of them. <i>Easy—</i>don't he?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e737">"You bet!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e739">Everybody said it. Every man but one. He was the new-comer-Peterson. He ordered the
            drinks all round, and asked who No. 3 might be. All answered at once, "Archy Stillman!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e741">"Is he a mystery?" asked Peterson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e743">"Is <i>he</i> a mystery? Is Archy <i>Stillman a</i>
            mystery?" said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "Why, the fourth dimension's foolishness to
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e754">For Ferguson was learned. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e756">Peterson wanted to hear all about him; everybody wanted to tell him; everybody began.
            But Billy Stevens, the barkeeper, called the house to order, and said one at a time was
            best. He distributed the drinks, and appointed Ferguson to lead. Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e758">"Well, he's a boy. And that is just about all we know about him. You can pump him till
            you are tired; it ain't any use; you won't get anything. At least about his intentions,
            or line of business, or where he's from, and such things as that. And as for getting at
            the nature and get-up of his main big chief mystery, why, he'll just change the subject,
            that's all. You can <i>guess</i> till you're black in the
            face—it's your privilege—but suppose you do, where do you arrive at?
            Nowhere, as near as I can make out," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e763">"What <i>is</i> his big chief one?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e768">"Sight, maybe. Hearing, maybe. Instinct, maybe. Magic, maybe. Take your
            choice—grownups, twenty-five; children and servants, half price. Now I'll tell you
            what he can do. You can start here, and just disappear; you can go and hide wherever you
            want to, I don't care where it is, nor how far—and he'll go straight and put his
            finger on you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e770">"You don't mean it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e772">"I just do, though. Weather's nothing to him—elemental conditions is nothing to
            him—he don't even take notice of them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e775">"Oh, come! Dark? Rain? Snow? Hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e777">"It's all the same to <i>him.</i> He don't give a damn." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e782">"Oh, <i>say—</i>including <i>fog,</i> per'aps?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e790"><i>"Fog!</i> he's got an eye 't can plunk through it like a bullet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e794">"Now, boys, honor bright, what's he giving me?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e796">"It's a fact!" they all shouted. "Go on, Wells-Fargo." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e798">"Well, sir, you can leave him here, chatting with the boys, and you can slip out and go
            to any cabin in this camp and open a book—yes, sir, a dozen of them—and take
            the page in your memory, and he'll start out and go straight to that cabin and open
            every one of them books at the right page, and call it off, and never make a mistake." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e800">"He must be the devil!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e802">"More than one has thought it. Now I'll tell you a perfectly wonderful thing that he
            done. The other night he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e804">There was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside, the door flew open, and an excited
            crowd burst in, with the camp's one white woman in the lead and crying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e806">"My child! my child! she's lost and gone! For the love of God help me to find Archy
            Stillman; we've hunted everywhere!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e809">Said the barkeeper: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e811">"Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, and don't worry. He asked for a bed three hours ago,
            tuckered out tramping the trails the way he's always doing, and went up-stairs. Ham
            Sandwich, run up and roust him out; he's in No. 14." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e813">The youth was soon down-stairs and ready. He asked Mrs. Hogan for particulars. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e815">"Bless you, dear, there ain't any; I wish there was. I put her to sleep at seven in the
            evening, and when I went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself, she was gone. I
            rushed for your cabin, dear, and you wasn't there, and I've hunted for you ever since,
            at every cabin down the gulch, and now I've come up again, and I'm that distracted and
            scared and heartbroke; but, thanks to God, I've found you at last, dear heart, and
            you'll find my child. Come on! come quick!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e817">"Move right along; I'm with you, madam. Go to your cabin first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e819">The whole company streamed out to join the hunt. All the southern half of the village
            was up, a hundred men strong, and waiting outside, a vague dark mass sprinkled with
            twinkling lanterns. The mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself
            to the narrow road, and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders. In a
            few minutes the Hogan cabin was reached. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e821">"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Hogan; "there's where she was; it's where I laid her at
            seven o'clock; but where she is now, God only knows." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e823">"Hand me a lantern," said Archy. He set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it,
            pretending to examine the ground closely. "Here's her track," he said, touching the
            ground here and there and yonder with his finger. "Do you see?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e825">Several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see. One or two
            thought they discerned something like a track; the others shook their heads and
            confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp
            enough to discover. One said, "Maybe a child's foot could make a mark on it, but <i>I</i> don't see how." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e830">Young Stillman stepped outside, held the light to the ground, turned leftward, and
            moved three steps, closely examining; then said, "I've got the direction—come
            along; take the lantern, somebody." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e832">He strode off swiftly southward, the files following, swaying and bending in and out
            with the deep curves of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the mouth of the gorge was reached;
            before them stretched the sagebrush plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman called a halt,
            saying, "We mustn't start wrong, now; we must take the direction again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e835">He took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards; then said,
            "Come on; it's all right," and gave up the lantern. In and out among the sage-bushes he
            marched, a quarter of a mile, bearing gradually to the right; then took a new direction
            and made another great semicircle; then changed again and moved due west nearly half a
            mile—and stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e837">"She gave it up, here, poor little chap. Hold the lantern. You can see where she sat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e839">But this was in a slick alkali flat which was surfaced like steel, and no person in the
            party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a
            cushion on a veneer like that. The bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the
            spot, lamenting. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e841">"But where is she, then?" some one said. "She didn't stay here. We can see <i>that</i> much, anyway." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e846">Stillman moved about in a circle around the place, with the lantern, pretending to hunt
            for tracks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e848">"Well!" he said presently, in an annoyed tone, "I don't understand it." He examined
            again. "No use. She was here—that's certain; she never <i>walked</i> away from here—and that's certain. It's a puzzle; I can't make it
            out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e853">The mother lost heart then. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e855">"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! some flying beast has got her. I'll never see her
            again!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e857">"Ah, <i>don't</i> give up," said Archy. "We'll find her—don't
            give up." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e862">"God bless you for the words, Archy Stillman!" and she seized his hand and kissed it
            fervently. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e864">Peterson, the new-comer, whispered satirically in Ferguson's ear: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e867">"Wonderful performance to find this place, wasn't it? Hardly worth while to come so
            far, though; any other supposititious place would have answered just as well—hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e869">Ferguson was not pleased with the innuendo. He said, with some warmth: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e871">"Do you mean to insinuate that the child hasn't been here? I tell you the child <i>has</i> been here! Now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a
            little fuss as—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e876">"All right!" sang out Stillman. "Come, everybody, and look at this! It was right under
            our noses all the time, and we didn't see it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e878">There was a general plunge for the ground at the place where the child was alleged to
            have rested, and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to see the thing that Archy's finger
            was resting upon. There was a pause, then a several-barreled sigh of disappointment. Pat
            Riley and Ham Sandwich said, in the one breath: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e880">"What is it, Archy? There's nothing here." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e882">"Nothing? Do you call <i>that</i> nothing?" and he swiftly traced upon
            the ground a form with his finger. "There—don't you recognize it now? It's Injun
            Billy's track. He's got the child." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e887">"God be praised !" from the mother. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e889">"Take away the lantern. I've got the direction. Follow!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e891">He started on a run, racing in and out among the sage-bushes a matter of three hundred
            yards, and disappeared over a sand-wave; the others struggled after him, caught him up,
            and found him waiting. Ten steps away was a little wickiup, a dim and formless shelter
            of rags and old horse-blankets, a dull light showing through its chinks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e893">"You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the lad. "It's your privilege to be first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e896">All followed the sprint she made for the wickiup, and saw, with her, the picture its
            interior afforded. Injun Billy was sitting on the ground; the child was asleep beside
            him. The mother hugged it with a wild embrace, which included Archy Stillman, the
            grateful tears running down her face, and in a choked and broken voice she poured out a
            golden stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments which has its home in full
            richness nowhere but in the Irish heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e898">"I find her bymeby it is ten o'clock," Billy explained. "She 'sleep out yonder, ve'y
            tired—face wet, been cryin', 'spose; fetch her home, feed her, she heap much
            hungry—go 'sleep 'gin." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e900">In her limitless gratitude the happy mother waived rank and hugged him too, calling him
            "the angel of God in disguise." And he probably was in disguise if he was that kind of
            an official. He was dressed for the character. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e902">At half past one in the morning the procession burst into the village singing, "When
            Johnny Comes Marching Home," waving its lanterns and swallowing the drinks that were
            brought out all along its course. It concentrated at the tavern, and made a night of
            what was left of the morning.</p>Chapter VI<p id="TwaDoubd1e907">The next afternoon the village was electrified with an immense sensation. A grave and
            dignified foreigner of distinguished bearing and appearance had arrived at the tavern,
            and entered this formidable name upon the register: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e909">SHERLOCK HOLMES
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e913">The news buzzed from cabin to cabin, from claim to claim; tools were dropped, and the
            town swarmed toward the center of interest. A man passing out at the northern end of the
            village shouted it to Pat Riley, whose claim was the next one to Flint Buckner's. At
            that time Fetlock Jones seemed to turn sick. He muttered to himself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e915">"Uncle <i>Sherlock!</i> The mean luck of it!—that <i>he </i>should come just when..." He dropped into a reverie, and
            presently said to himself: "But what's the use of being afraid of <i>him?
            </i>Anybody that knows him the way I do knows he can't detect a crime except where he
            plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and hires some fellow to commit it
            according to instructions.... Now there ain't going to <i>be</i> any
            clues this time—so, what show has he got? None at all. No, sir; everything's
            ready. If I was to risk putting it off—...No, I won't run any risk like that.
            Flint Buckner goes out of this world to-night, for sure." Then another trouble presented
            itself. "Uncle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening, and
            how am I going to get rid of him? for I've <i>got</i> to be at my cabin
            a minute or two about eight o'clock." This was an awkward matter, and cost him much
            thought. But he found a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll go for a walk, and I'll leave
            him in the road a minute, so that he won't see what it is I do: the best way to throw a
            detective off the track, anyway, is to have him along when you are preparing the thing.
            Yes, that's the safest—I'll take him with me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e932">Meantime the road in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping
            for a glimpse of the great man. But he kept his room, and did not appear. None but
            Ferguson, Jake Parker the blacksmith, and Ham Sandwich had any luck. These enthusiastic
            admirers of the great scientific detective hired the tavern's detained-baggage lockup,
            which looked into the detective's room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide,
            ambushed themselves in it, and cut some peep-holes in the window-blind. Mr. Holmes's
            blinds were down; but by and by he raised them. It gave the spies a hair-lifting but
            pleasurable thrill to find themselves face to face with the Extraordinary Man who had
            filled the world with the fame of his more than human ingenuities. There he
            sat—not a myth, not a shadow, but real, alive, compact of substance, and almost
            within touching distance with the hand. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e934">"Look at that head!" said Ferguson, in an awed voice. "By gracious! <i>that's</i> a head!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e939">"You bet!" said the blacksmith, with deep reverence. "Look at his nose! look at his
            eyes! Intellect? Just a battery of it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e941">"And that paleness," said Ham Sandwich. "Comes from thought—that's what it comes
            from. Hell! duffers like us don't know what real thought <i>is."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e946">"No more we don't," said Ferguson. "What we take for thinking is just
            blubber-and-slush," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e948">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo. And look at that frown—that's <i>deep</i> thinking—away down, down, forty fathom into the bowels of things.
            He's on the track of something." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e954">"Well, he is, and don't you forget it. Say—look at that awful gravity—look
            at that pallid solemness—there ain't any corpse can lay over it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e956">"No, sir, not for dollars! And it's his'n by hereditary rights, too; he's been dead
            four times a'ready, and there's history for it. Three times natural, once by accident.
            I've heard say he smells damp and cold, like a grave. And he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e958">" 'Sh! Watch him! There—he's got his thumb on the bump on the near corner of his
            forehead, and his forefinger on the off one. His think-works is just a-<i>grinding</i> now, you bet your other shirt." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e963">"That's so. And now he's gazing up toward heaven and stroking his mustache slow,
            and—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e965">"Now he has rose up standing, and is putting his clues together on his left fingers
            with his right finger. See? he touches the forefinger—now middle finger—now
            ring-finger—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e967">"Stuck!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e969">"Look at him scowl! He can't seem to make out <i>that</i> clue. So
            he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e974">"See him smile!—like a tiger—and tally off the other fingers like nothing!
            He's got it, boys; he's got it sure!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e976">"Well, I should <i>say!</i> I'd hate to be in that man's place that
            he's after." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e981">Mr. Holmes drew a table to the window, sat down with his back to the spies, and
            proceeded to write. The spies withdrew their eyes from the peep-holes, lit their pipes,
            and settled themselves for a comfortable smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with conviction: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e983">"Boys, it's no use talking, he's a wonder! He's got the signs of it all over him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e986">"You hain't ever said a truer word than that, Wells-Fargo," said Jake Parker. "Say,
            wouldn't it 'a' been nuts if he'd a-been here last night?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e988">"Oh, by George, but wouldn't it!" said Ferguson. "Then we'd have seen <i>scientific</i> work. Intellect—just pure intellect—away up on the upper
            levels, dontchuknow. Archy is all right, and it don't become anybody to belittle <i>him,</i> I can tell you. But his gift is only just eyesight, sharp as
            an owl's, as near as I can make it out just a grand natural animal talent, no more, no
            less, and prime as far as it goes, but no intellect in it, and for awfulness and
            marvelousness no more to be compared to what this man does than—than—Why,
            let me tell you what <i>he'd</i> have done. He'd have stepped over to
            Hogan's and glanced—just <i>glanced,</i> that's all—at the
            premises, and that's enough. See everything? Yes, sir, to the last little detail; and
            he'll know more about that place than the Hogans would know in seven years. Next, he
            would sit down on the bunk, just as ca'm, and say to Mrs. Hogan—<i>Say,</i> Ham, consider that you are Mrs. Hogan. I'll ask the questions; you answer
            them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1005">"All right; go on." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1007">" 'Madam, if you please—attention—do not let your mind wander. Now,
            then—sex of the child?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1009">" 'Female, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1011">" 'Um—female. Very good, very good. Age?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1013">" 'Turned six, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1015">" 'Um—young, weak—two miles. Weariness will overtake it then. It will sink
            down and sleep. We shall find it two miles away, or less. Teeth?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1017">" 'Five, your Honor, and one a-coming.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1019">" 'Very good, very good, <i>very</i> good, indeed.' You see, boys, <i>he</i> knows a clue when he sees it, when it wouldn't mean a dern thing
            to anybody else. 'Stockings, madam? Shoes?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1027">" 'Yes, your Honor—both.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1030">" 'Yarn, perhaps? Morocco?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1032">" 'Yarn, your Honor. And kip.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1034">" 'Um—kip. This complicates the matter. However, let it go—we shall manage.
            Religion?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1036">" 'Catholic, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1038">" 'Very good. Snip me a bit from the bed blanket, please. Ah, thanks. Part
            wool—foreign make. Very well. A snip from some garment of the child's, please.
            Thanks. Cotton. Shows wear. An excellent clue, excellent. Pass me a pallet of the floor
            dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, many thanks. Ah, admirable, admirable! <i>Now</i> we know where we are, I think.' You see, boys, he's got all the
            clues he wants now; he don't need anything more. Now, then, what does this Extraordinary
            Man do? He lays those snips and that dirt out on the table and leans over them on his
            elbows, and puts them together side by side and studies them—mumbles to himself,
            'Female'; changes them around—mumbles, 'Six years old'; changes them this way and
            that—again mumbles: 'Five teeth—one
            a-coming—Catholic—yarn—cotton—kip—damn that kip.' Then he
            straightens up and gazes toward heaven, and plows his hands through his hair—plows
            and plows, muttering, 'Damn that kip!' Then he stands up and frowns, and begins to tally
            off his clues on his fingers—and gets stuck at the ring-finger. But only just a
            minute—then his face glares all up in a smile like a house afire, and he
            straightens up stately and majestic, and says to the crowd, 'Take a lantern, a couple of
            you, and go down to Injun Billy's and fetch the child—the rest of you go 'long
            home to bed; good-night, madam; good-night, gents.' And he bows like the Matterhorn, and
            pulls out for the tavern. That's <i>his</i> style, and the <i>Only—</i>scientific, intellectual—all over in fifteen
            minutes—no poking around all over the sage-brush range an hour and a half in a
            mass-meeting crowd for <i>him,</i> boys—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1055">"By Jackson, it's grand!" said Ham Sandwich. "Wells-Fargo, you've got him down to a
            dot. He ain't painted up any exacter to the life in the books. By George, I can juse <i>see</i> him—can't you, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1060">"You bet you! It's just a photograft, that's what it is." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1062">Ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success, and grateful. He sat silently
            enjoying his happiness a little while, then he murmured, with a deep awe in his voice, </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1064">"I wonder if God made him?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1066">There was no response for a moment; then Ham Sandwich said, reverently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1068">"Not all at one time, I reckon."</p>Chapter VII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1073">At eight o'clock that evening two persons were groping their way past Flint Buckner's
            cabin in the frosty gloom. They were Sherlock Holmes and his nephew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1075">"Stop here in the road a moment, uncle," said Fetlock, "while I run to my cabin; I
            won't be gone a minute." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1077">He asked for something—the uncle furnished it—then he disappeared in the
            darkness, but soon returned, and the talking-walk was resumed. By nine o'clock they had
            wandered back to the tavern. They worked their way through the billiard-room, where a
            crowd had gathered in the hope of getting a glimpse of the Extraordinary Man. A royal
            cheer was raised. Mr. Holmes acknowledged the compliment with a series of courtly bows,
            and as he was passing out his nephew said to the assemblage: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1079">"Uncle Sherlock's got some work to do, gentlemen, that 'll keep him till twelve or one;
            but he'll be down again then, or earlier if he can, and hopes some of you'll be left to
            take a drink with him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1081">"By George, he's just a duke, boys! Three cheers for Sherlock Holmes, the greatest man
            that ever lived!" shouted Ferguson. "Hip, hip, hip—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1083">"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Tiger!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1085">The uproar shook the building, so hearty was the feeling the boys put into their
            welcome. Up-stairs the uncle reproached the nephew gently, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1087">"What did you get me into that engagement for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1089">"I reckon you don't want to be unpopular, do you, uncle? Well, then, don't you put on
            any exclusiveness in a mining-camp, that's all. The boys admire you; but if you was to
            leave without taking a drink with them, they'd set you down for a snob. And besides, you
            said you had home talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1091">The boy was right, and wise—the uncle acknowledged it. The boy was wise in
            another detail which he did not mention—except to himself: "Uncle and the others
            will come handy—in the way of nailing an <i>alibi </i>where it
            can't be budged." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1097">He and his uncle talked diligently about three hours. Then, about midnight, Fetlock
            stepped down-stairs and took a position in the dark a dozen steps from the tavern, and
            waited. Five minutes later Flint Buckner came rocking out of the billiard-room and
            almost brushed him as he passed. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1099">"I've <i>got</i> him!" muttered the boy. He continued to himself,
            looking after the shadowy form: "Good-by—good-by for good, Flint Buckner; you
            called my mother a—well, never mind what: it's all right, now; you're taking your
            last walk, friend." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1104">He went musing back into the tavern. "From now till one is an hour. We'll spend it with
            the boys; it's good for the <i>alibi."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1109">He brought Sherlock Holmes to the billiard-room, which was jammed with eager and
            admiring miners; the guest called the drinks, and the fun began. Everybody was happy;
            everybody was complimentary; the ice was soon broken, songs, anecdotes, and more drinks
            followed, and the pregnant minutes flew. At six minutes to one, when the jollity was at
            its highest— </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1111"><i>Boom!</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1115">There was silence instantly. The deep sound came rolling and rumbling frown peak to
            peak up the gorge, then died down, and ceased. The spell broke, then, and the men made a
            rush for the door, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1117">"Something's blown up!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1119">Outside, a voice in the darkness said, "It's away down the gorge; I saw the flash." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1121">The crowd poured down the cañon—Holmes, Fetlock, Archy Stillman,
            everybody. They made the mile in a few minutes. By the light of a lantern they found the
            smooth and solid dirt floor of Flint Buckner's cabin; of the cabin itself not a vestige
            remained, not a rag nor a splinter. Nor any sign of Flint. Search-parties sought here
            and there and yonder, and presently a cry went up. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1123">"Here he is!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1125">It was true. Fifty yards down the gulch they had found him—that is, they had
            found a crushed and lifeless mass which represented him. Fetlock Jones hurried thither
            with the others and looked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1128">The inquest was a fifteen-minute affair. Ham Sandwich, foreman of the jury, handed up
            the verdict, which was phrased with a certain unstudied literary grace, and closed with
            this finding, to wit: that "deceased came to his death by his own act or some other
            person or persons unknown to this jury not leaving any family or similar effects behind
            but his cabin which was blown away and God have mercy on his soul amen." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1130">Then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd, for the storm-center of interest was
            there—Sherlock Holmes. The miners stood silent and reverent in a half-circle,
            inclosing a large vacant space which included the front exposure of the site of the late
            premises. In this considerable space the Extraordinary Man was moving about, attended by
            his nephew with a lantern. With a tape he took measurements of the cabin site; of the
            distance from the wall of chaparral to the road; of the height of the chaparral bushes;
            also various other measurements. He gathered a rag here, a splinter there, and a pinch
            of earth yonder, inspected them profoundly, and preserved them. He took the "lay" of the
            place with a pocket-compass, allowing two seconds for magnetic variation. He took the
            time (Pacific) by his watch, correcting it for local time. He paced off the distance
            from the cabin site to the corpse, and corrected that for tidal differentiation. He took
            the altitude with a pocket-aneroid, and the temperature with a pocket-thermometer.
            Finally he said, with a stately bow: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1132">"It is finished. Shall we return, gentlemen?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1134">He took up the line of march for the tavern, and the crowd fell into his wake,
            earnestly discussing and admiring the Extraordinary Man, and interlarding guesses as to
            the origin of the tragedy and who the author of it might he. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1136">"My, but it's grand luck having him here—hey, boys?" said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1138">"It's the biggest thing of the century," said Ham Sandwich. "It 'll go all over the
            world; you mark my words." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1140"><i>"You</i> bet!" said Jake Parker, the blacksmith. "It 'll boom this
            camp. Ain't it so, Wells-Fargo?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1144">"Well, as you want my opinion—if it's any sign of how <i>I
            </i>think about it, I can tell you this: yesterday I was holding the Straight Flush
            claim at two dollars a foot; I'd like to see the man that can get it at sixteen to-day." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1149">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo! It's the grandest luck a new camp ever struck. Say, did
            you see him collar them little rags and dirt and things? What an eye! He just can't
            overlook a clue—'tain't <i>in </i>him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1154">"That's so. And they wouldn't mean a thing to anybody else; but to him, why, they're
            just a book—large print at that." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1156">"Sure's you're born! Them odds and ends have got their little old secret, and they
            think there ain't anybody can pull it; but, land! when he sets his grip there they've
            got to squeal, and don't you forget it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1159">"Boys, I ain't sorry, now, that he wasn't here to roust out the child; this is a bigger
            thing, by a long sight. Yes, sir, and more tangled up and scientific and intellectual." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1161">"I reckon we're all of us glad it's turned out this way. Glad? 'George! it ain't any
            name for it. Dontchuknow, Archy could 've <i>learnt</i> something if
            he'd had the nous to stand by and take notice of how that man works the system. But no;
            he went poking up into the chaparral and just missed the whole thing." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1166">"It's true as gospel; I seen it myself. Well, Archy's young. He'll know better one of
            these days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1168">"Say, boys, who do you reckon done it?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1170">That was a difficult question, and brought out a world of unsatisfying conjecture.
            Various men were mentioned as possibilities, but one by one they were discarded as not
            being eligible. No one but young Hillyer had been intimate with Flint Buckner; no one
            had really had a quarrel with him; he had affronted every man who had tried to make up
            to him, although not quite offensively enough to require bloodshed. There was one name
            that was upon every tongue from the start, but it <i>was</i> the last to
            get utterance—Fetlock Jones's. It was Pat Riley that mentioned it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1175">"Oh, well," the boys said, "of course we've all thought of him, because he had a
            million rights to kill Flint Buckner, and it was just his plain duty to do it. But all
            the same there's two things we can't get around: for one thing, he hasn't got the sand;
            and for another, he wasn't anywhere near the place when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1177">"I know it," said Pat. "He was there in the billiard-room with us when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1179">"Yes, and was there all the time for an hour <i>before</i> it
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1184">"It's so. And lucky for him, too. He'd have been suspected in a minute if it hadn't
            been for that."</p>Chapter VIII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1189">The tavern dining-room had been cleared of all its furniture save one six-foot pine
            table and a chair. This table was against one end of the room; the chair was on it;
            Sherlock Holmes, stately, imposing, impressive, sat in the chair. The public stood. The
            room was full. The tobacco-smoke was dense, the stillness profound. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1191">The Extraordinary Man raised his hand to command additional silence; held it in the air
            a few moments; then, in brief, crisp terms he put forward question after question, and
            noted the answers with "Um-ums," nods of the head, and so on. By this process he learned
            all about Flint Buckner, his character, conduct, and habits, that the people were able
            to tell him. It thus transpired that the Extraordinary Man's nephew was the only person
            in the camp who had a killing-grudge against Flint Buckner. Mr. Holmes smiled
            compassionately upon the witness, and asked, languidly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1193">"Do any of you gentlemen chance to know where the lad Fetlock Jones was at the time of
            the explosion?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1195">A thunderous response followed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1197">"In the billiard-room of this house!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1199">"Ah. And had he just come in?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1201">"Been there all of an hour!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1203">"Ah. It is about—about—well, about how far might it be to the scene of the
            explosions" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1205">"All of a mile!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1207">"Ah. It isn't <i>much</i> of an alibi, 'tis true, but—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1213">A storm-burst of laughter, mingled with shouts of "By jiminy, but he's
            chain-lightning!" and "Ain't you sorry you spoke, Sandy?" shut off the rest of the
            sentence, and the crushed witness drooped his blushing face in pathetic shame. The
            inquisitor resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1215">"The lad Jones's somewhat <i>distant</i> connection with the case"
              (laughter<i>) "</i>having been disposed of, let us now call the
            eye-witnesses of the tragedy, and listen to what they have to say." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1223">He got out his fragmentary clues and arranged them on a sheet of cardboard on his knee.
            The house held its breath and watched. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1225">"We have the longitude and the latitude, corrected for magnetic variation, and this
            gives us the exact location of the tragedy. We have the altitude, the temperature, and
            the degree of humidity prevailing—inestimably valuable, since they enable us to
            estimate with precision the degree of influence which they would exercise upon the mood
            and disposition of the assassin at that time of the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1227"><i>(Buzz of admiration; muttered remark, "By George, but he's
              deep.")</i> He fingered his clues. "And now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak
            to us. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1231">"Here we have an empty linen shot-bag. What is its message? This: that robbery was the
            motive, not revenge. What is its further message? This: that the assassin was of
            inferior intelligence—shall we say light-witted, or perhaps approaching that? How
            do we know this? Because a person of sound intelligence would not have proposed to rob
            the man Buckner, who never had much money with him. But the assassin might have been a
            stranger? Let the bag speak again. I take from it this article. It is a bit of
            silver-bearing quartz. It is peculiar. Examine it, please—you—and
            you—and you. Now pass it back, please. There is but one lode on this coast which
            produces just that character and color of quartz; and that is a lode which crops out for
            nearly two miles on a stretch, and in my opinion is destined, at no distant day, to
            confer upon its locality a globe-girdling celebrity, and upon its two hundred owners
            riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Name that lode, please." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1233">"The Consolidated Christian Science and Mary Ann!" was the prompt response. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1235">A wild crash of hurrahs followed, and every man reached for his neighbor's hand and
            wrung it, with tears in his eyes; and Wells-Fargo Ferguson shouted, "The Straight Flush
            is on the lode, and up she goes to a hunched and fifty a foot—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1240">When quiet fell, Mr. Holmes resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1242">"We perceive, then, that three facts are established, to wit: the assassin was
            approximately light-witted; he was not a stranger; his motive was robbery, not revenge.
            Let us proceed. I hold in my hand a small fragment of fuse, with the recent smell of
            fire upon it. What is its testimony? Taken with the corroborative evidence of the
            quartz, it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner. What does it tell us further?
            This, gentlemen: that the assassination was consummated by means of an explosive. What
            else does it say? This: that the explosive was located against the side of the cabin
            nearest the road—the front side—for within six feet of that spot I found it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1244">"I hold in my fingers a burnt Swedish match—the kind one rubs on a safety-box. I
            found it in the road, six hundred and twenty-two feet from the abolished cabin. What
            does it say? This: that the train was fired from that point. What further does it tell
            us? This: that the assassin was left-handed. How do I know this? I should not be able to
            explain to you, gentlemen, how I know it, the signs being so subtle that only long
            experience and deep study can enable one to detect them. But the signs are here, and
            they are reinforced by a fact which you must have often noticed in the great detective
            narratives—that <i>all </i>assassins are left-handed." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1250">"By Jackson, <i>that's</i> so." said Ham Sandwich, bringing his great
            hand down with a resounding slap upon his thigh; "blamed if I ever thought of it
            before." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1255">"Nor I!" "Nor I!" cried several. "Oh, there can't anything escape <i>him—</i>look at his eye!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1260">"Gentlemen, distant as the murderer was from his doomed victim, he did not wholly
            escape injury. This fragment of wood which I now exhibit to you struck him. It drew
            blood. Wherever he is, he bears the telltale mark. I picked it up where he stood when he
            fired the fatal train," He looked out over the house from his high perch, and his
            countenance began to darken; he slowly raised his hand, and pointed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1262">"There stands the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1264">For a moment the house was paralyzed with amazement; then twenty voices burst out with: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1266">"Sammy Hillyer? Oh, <i>hell,</i> no! <i>Him?</i> It's
            pure foolishness!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1274">"Take care, gentlemen—be not hasty. Observe—he has the blood-mark on his
            brow." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1276">Hillyer turned white with fright. He was near to crying. He turned this way and that,
            appealing to every face for help and sympathy; and held out his supplicating hands
            toward Holmes and began to plead: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1278"><i>"Don't,</i> oh, don't! I never did it; I give my word I never did
            it. The way I got this hurt on my forehead was—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1282">"Arrest him, constable!" cried Holmes. "I will swear out the warrant" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1284">The constable moved reluctantly forward—hesitated—stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1287">Hillyer broke out with another appeal. "Oh, Archy, don't let them do it; it would kill
            mother! <i>You</i> know how I got the hurt. Tell them, and save me,
            Archy; save me!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1292">Stillman worked his way to the front, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1294">"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be afraid." Then he said to the house, "Never mind how he
            got the hurt; it hasn't anything to do with this case, and isn't of any consequence." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1296">"God bless you, Archy, for a true friend!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1298">"Hurrah for Archy! Go in, boy, and play 'em a knock-down flush to their two pair 'n' a
            jack!" shouted the house, pride in their home talent and a patriotic sentiment of
            loyalty to it rising suddenly in the public heart and changing the whole attitude of the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1300">Young Stillman waited for the noise to cease; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1302">"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand by that door yonder, and Constable Harris to stand by
            the other one here, and not let anybody leave the room. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1304">"Said and done. Go on, old man!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1306">"The criminal is present, I believe. I will show him to you before long, in case I am
            right in my guess. Now I will tell you all about the tragedy, from start to finish. The
            motive <i>wasn't </i>robbery; it was revenge. The murderer <i>wasn't</i> light-witted. He <i>didn't</i> stand six
            hundred and twenty-two feet away. He <i>didn't </i>get hit with a piece
            of wood. He <i>didn't</i> place the explosive against the cabin. He <i>didn't</i> bring a shot-bag with him, and he <i>wasn't</i> left-handed. With the exception of these errors, the distinguished
            guest's statement of the case is substantially correct." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1330">A comfortable laugh rippled over the house; friend nodded to friend, as much as to say,
            "That's the word, with the bark <i>on</i> it. Good lad, good boy. <i>He</i> ain't lowering his flag any!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1338">The guest's serenity was not disturbed. Stillman resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1341">"I also have some witnesses; and I will presently tell you where you can find some
            more." He held up a piece of coarse wire; the crowd craned their necks to see. "It has a
            smooth coating of melted tallow on it. And here is a candle which is burned half-way
            down. The remaining half of it has marks cut upon it an inch apart. Soon I will tell you
            where I found these things. I will now put aside reasonings, guesses, the impressive
            hitchings of odds and ends of clues together, and the other showy theatricals of the
            detective trade, and tell you in a plain, straightforward way just how this dismal thing
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1343">He paused a moment, for effect—to allow silence and suspense to intensify and
            concentrate the house's interest; then he went on: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1345">"The assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains. It was a good plan, very
            ingenious, and showed an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. It was a plan which was
            well calculated to ward off all suspicion from its inventor. In the <i>first</i> place, he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart, and lit it and timed
            it. He found it took three hours to burn four inches of it. I tried it myself for half
            an hour, awhile ago, up-stairs here, while the inquiry into Flint Buckner's character
            and ways was being conducted in this room, and I arrived in that way at the rate of a
            candle's consumption when sheltered from the wind. Having proved his trial candle's
            rate, he blew it out—I have already shown it to you—and put <i>his</i> inch-marks on a fresh one. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1353">"He put the fresh one into a tin candlestick. Then at the five-hour mark he bored a
            hole through the candle with a red-hot wire. I have already shown you the wire, with a
            smooth coat of tallow on it—tallow that had been melted and had cooled. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1355">"With labor—very hard labor, I should say—he struggled up through the stiff
            chaparral that clothes the steep hillside back of Flint Buckner's place, tugging an
            empty flour-barrel with him. He placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place, and in
            the bottom of it he set the candlestick. Then he measured off about thirty-five feet of
            fuse—the barrel's distance from the back of the cabin. He bored a hole in the side
            of the barrel—here is the large gimlet he did it with. He went on and finished his
            work; and when it was done, one end of the fuse was in Buckner's cabin, and the other
            end, with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder, was in the hole in the
            candle—timed to blow the place up at one o'clock this morning, provided the candle
            was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening—which I am betting it was—and
            provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the
            fuse—which I am also betting there was, though I can't prove it. Boys, the barrel
            is there in the chaparral, the candle's remains are in it in the tin stick; the
            burnt-out fuse is in the gimlet-hole, the other end is down the hill where the late
            cabin stood. I saw them all an hour or two ago, when the Professor here was measuring
            off unimplicated vacancies and collecting relics that hadn't anything to do with the
            case." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1357">He paused. The house drew a long, deep breath, shook its strained cords and muscles
            free and burst into cheers. "Dang him!" said Ham Sandwich, "that's why he was snooping
            around in the chaparral, instead of picking up points out of the P'fessor's game. Looky
            here—he ain't no fool, boys." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1359">"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1361">But Stillman was resuming: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1363">"While we were out yonder an hour or two ago, the owner of the gimlet and the trial
            candle took them from a place where he had concealed them—it was not a good
            place—and carried them to what he probably thought was a better one, two hundred
            yards up in the pine woods, and hid them there, covering them over with pine needles. It
            was there that I found them. The gimlet exactly fits the hole in the barrel. And
            now—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1365">The Extraordinary Man interrupted him. He said, sarcastically: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1367">"We have had a very pretty fairy tale, gentlemen—very pretty indeed. Now I would
            like to ask this young man a question or two." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1370">Some of the boys winced, and Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1372">"I'm afraid Archy's going to catch it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1374">The others lost their smiles and sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1376">"Let us proceed to examine into this fairy tale in a consecutive and orderly
            way—by geometrical progression, so to speak—linking detail to detail in a
            steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent and unassailable march upon this tinsel
            toy fortress of error, the dream fabric of a callow imagination. To begin with, young
            sir, I desire to ask you but three questions at present—<i>at
              present.</i> Did I understand you to say it was your opinion that the supposititious
            candle was lighted at about eight o'clock yesterday evening?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1381">"Yes, sir—about eight." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1383">"Could you say exactly eight?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1385">"Well, no, I couldn't be that exact." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1387">"Um. If a person had been passing along there just about that time, he would have been
            almost sure to encounter that assassin, do you think?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1389">"Yes, I should think so." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1391">"Thank you, that is all. For the present. I say, all <i>for the
              present."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1396">"Dern him. he's laying for Archy," said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1399">"It's so," said Ham Sandwich. "I don't like the look of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1401">Stillman said, glancing at the guest, "I was along there myself at half-past
            eight—no, about nine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1403">"In-deed? This is interesting—this is very interesting. Perhaps you encountered
            the assassin?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1405">"No, I encountered no one." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1407">"Ah. Then—if you will excuse the remark—I do not quite see the relevancy of
            the information." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1409">"It has none. At present. I say it has none—at present." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1411">He paused. Presently he resumed: "I did not encounter the assassin, but I am on his
            track, I am sure, for I believe he is in this room. I will ask you all to pass one by
            one in front of me—here, where there is a good light—so that I can see your
            feet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1413">A buzz of excitement swept the place, and the march began, the guest looking on with an
            iron attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified success. Stillman stooped, shaded
            his eyes with his hand, and gazed down intently at each pair of feet as it passed. Fifty
            men tramped monotonously by—with no result. Sixty. Seventy. The thing was
            beginning to look absurd. The guest remarked, with suave irony:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1415">"Stillman Accuses Sherlock Holmes"Image of Stillman pointing a finger at Sherlock Holmes</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1421">"Assassins appear to be scarce this evening." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1423">The house saw the humor if it, and refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. Ten or twelve
            more candidates tramped by—no, <i>danced </i>by, with airy and
            ridiculous capers which convulsed the spectators—then suddenly Stillman put out
            his hand and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1429">"This is the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1431">"Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhedrim!" roared the crowd; and at once let fly a
            pyrotechnic explosion and dazzle and confusion of stirring remarks inspired by the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1433">At the height of the turmoil the guest stretched out his hand, commanding peace. The
            authority of a great name and a great personality laid its mysterious compulsion upon
            the house, and it obeyed. Out of the panting calm which succeeded, the guest spoke,
            saying, with dignity and feeling: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1435"><i>"This</i> is serious. It strikes at an innocent life. Innocent
            beyond suspicion! Innocent beyond peradventure! Hear me <i>prove</i> it;
            observe how simple a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie. Listen. My
            friends, that lad was never out of my sight yesterday evening at <i>any</i> time!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1445">It made a deep impression. Men turned their eyes upon Stillman with grave inquiry in
            them. His face brightened, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1447">"I <i>knew</i> there was another one!" He stepped briskly to the table
            and glanced at the guest's feet, then up at his face, and said: "You were <i>with</i> him! You were not fifty steps from him when he lit the candle
            that by and by fired the powder!" <i>(Sensation.) "</i>And what is more,
            you furnished the matches yourself !" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1458">Plainly the guest seemed hit; it looked so to the public. He opened his mouth to speak;
            the words did not come freely. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1460">"This—er—this is insanity—this—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1462">Stillman pressed his evident advantage home. He held up a charred match. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1464">"Here <i>is</i> one of them. I found it in the barrel—and there's
              <i>another</i> one there." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1472">The guest found his voice at once. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1475"><i>"Yes—</i>and put them there yourself!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1479">It was recognized a good shot. Stillman retorted. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1481">"It is <i>wax—</i>a breed unknown to this camp. I am ready to be
            searched for the box. Are you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1486">The guest was staggered this time—the dullest eye could see it. He fumbled with
            his hands; once or twice his lips moved, but the words did not come. The house waited
            and watched, in tense suspense, the stillness adding effect to the situation. Presently
            Stillman said, gently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1488">"We are waiting for your decision." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1490">There was silence again during several moments; then the guest answered, in a low
            voice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1492">"I refuse to be searched." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1494">There was no noisy demonstration, but all about the house one voice after another
            muttered: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1496">"That settles it! He's Archy's meat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1498">What to do now? Nobody seemed to know. It was an embarrassing situation for the
            moment—merely, of course, because matters had taken such a sudden and unexpected
            turn that these unpractised minds were not prepared for it, and had come to a
            standstill, like a stopped clock, under the shock. But after a little the machinery
            began to work again, tentatively, and by twos and threes the men put their heads
            together and privately buzzed over this and that and the other proposition. One of these
            propositions met with much favor; it was, to confer upon the assassin a vote of thanks
            for removing Flint Buckner, and let him go. But the cooler heads opposed it, pointing
            out that addled brains in the Eastern states would pronounce it a scandal, and make no
            end of foolish noise about it. Finally the cool heads got the upper hand, and obtained
            general consent to a proposition of their own; their leader then called the house to
            order and stated it—to this effect: that Fetlock Jones be jailed and put upon
            trial. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1500">The motion was carried. Apparently there was nothing further to do now, and the people
            were glad, for, privately, they were impatient to get out and rush to the scene of the
            tragedy, and see whether that barrel and the other things were really there or not. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1503">But no—the break-up got a check. The surprises were not over yet. For a while
            Fetlock Jones had been silently sobbing, unnoticed in the absorbing excitements which
            had been following one another so persistently for some time; but when his arrest and
            trial were decreed, he broke out despairingly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1505">"No! it's no use. I don't want any jail, I don't want any trial; I've had all the hard
            luck I want, and all the miseries. Hang me now, and let me out! It would all come out,
            anyway—there couldn't anything save me. He has told it all, just as if he'd been
            with me and seen it—<i>I</i> don't know how he found out; and
            you'll find the barrel and things, and then I wouldn't have any chance any more. I
            killed him; and <i>you'd</i> have done it too, if he'd treated you like
            a dog, and you only a boy, and weak and poor, and not a friend to help you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1513">"And served him damned well right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. "Looky here, boys—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1515">From the constable: "Order! Order, gentlemen!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1517">A voice: "Did your uncle know what you was up to?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1519">"No, he didn't." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1521">"Did he give you the matches, sure enough?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1523">"Yes, he did; but he didn't know what I wanted them for." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1525">"When you was out on such a business as that, how did you venture to risk having him
            along—and him a <i>detective?</i> How's that?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1530">The boy hesitated, fumbled with his buttons in an embarrassed way, then said, shyly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1532">"I know about detectives, on account of having them in the family; and if you don't
            want them to find out about a thing, it's best to have them around when you do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1535">The cyclone of laughter which greeted this native discharge of wisdom did not modify
            the poor little waif's embarrassment in any large degree.</p>Chapter IX<p id="TwaDoubd1e1540">From a letter to Mrs. Stillman, dated merely "Tuesday." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1542">Fetlock Jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log cabin, and left there
              to await his trial. Constable Harris provided him with a couple of days' rations,
              instructed him to keep a good guard over himself, and promised to look in on him as
              soon as further supplies should be due. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1545">Next morning a score of us went with Hillyer, out of friendship, and helped him bury
              his late relative, the unlamented Buckner, and I acted as first assistant pall-bearer,
              Hillyer acting as chief. Just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy
              stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, limped by with his head down, and I caught the
              scent I had chased around the globe! It was the odor of Paradise to my perishing hope!
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1548">In a moment I was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder. He
              slumped to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had withered him in his tracks; and
              as the boys came running he struggled to his knees and put up his pleading hands to
              me, and out of his chattering jaws he begged me to persecute him no more, and said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1551">"You have hunted me around the world, Sherlock Holmes, yet God is my witness I have
              never done any man harm!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1554">A glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane. That was my work, mother!
              The tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery I felt in that moment, but
              nothing else can ever do it. The boys lifted him up, and gathered about him, and were
              full of pity of him, and said the gentlest and touchingest things to him, and said
              cheer up and don't be troubled, he was among friends now, and they would take care of
              him, and protect him, and hang any man that laid a hand on him. They are just like so
              many mothers, the rough mining-camp boys are, when you wake up the south side of their
              hearts; yes, and just like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up
              the opposite of that muscle. They did everything they could think of to comfort him,
              but nothing succeeded until Wells-Fargo Ferguson, who is a clever strategist, said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1557">"If it's only Sherlock Holmes that's troubling you, you needn't worry any more."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1560">"Why?" asked the forlorn lunatic, eagerly. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1563">"Because he's dead again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1566">"Dead! Dead! Oh, don't trifle with a poor wreck like me. <i>Is
              </i>he dead? On honor, now—is he telling me true, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1573">"True as you're standing there!" said Ham Sandwich, and they all backed up the
              statement in a body. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1576">"They hung him in San Bernardino last week," added Ferguson, clinching the matter,
              "whilst he was searching around after you. Mistook him for another man. They're sorry,
              but they can't help it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1579">"They're a-building him a monument," said Ham Sandwich, with the air of a person who
              had contributed to it, and knew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1582">"James Walker" drew a deep sigh—evidently a sigh of relief—and said
              nothing; but his eyes lost something of their wildness, his countenance cleared
              visibly, and its drawn look relaxed a little. We all went to our cabin, and the boys
              cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for, and while they
              were about it Hillyer and I outfitted him from hat to shoe-leather with new clothes of
              ours, and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him. "Old" is the right word,
              and a pity, too: old by the droop of him, and the frost upon his hair, and the marks
              which sorrow and distress have left upon his face; though he is only in his prime in
              the matter of years. While he ate, we smoked and chatted; and when he was finishing he
              found his voice at last, and of his own accord broke out with his personal history. I
              cannot furnish his exact words, but I will come as near it as I can. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1585">THE "WRONG MAN'S" STORY </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1588">It happened like this: I was in Denver. I had been there many years; sometimes I
              remember how many, sometimes I don't—but it isn't any matter. All of a sudden I
              got a notice to leave, or I would be exposed for a horrible crime committed long
              before—years and years before—in the East. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1591">I knew about that crime, but I was not the criminal; it was a cousin of mine of the
              same name. What should I better do? My head was all disordered by fear, and I didn't
              know. I was allowed very little time—only one day, I think it was. I would be
              ruined if I was published, and the people would lynch me, and not believe what I said.
              It is always the way with lynchings: when they find out it is a mistake they are
              sorry, but it is too late—the same as it was with Mr. Holmes, you see. So I said
              I would sell out and get money to live on, and run away until it blew over and I could
              come back with my proofs. Then I escaped in the night and went a long way off in the
              mountains somewhere, and lived disguised and had a false name. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1594">I got more and more troubled and worried, and my troubles made me see spirits and
              hear voices, and I could not think straight and clear on any subject, but got confused
              and involved and had to give it up, because my head hurt so. It got to be worse and
              worse; more spirits and more voices. They were about me all the time; at first only in
              the night, then in the day too. They were always whispering around my bed and plotting
              against me, and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out, because I got no good rest.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1597">And then came the worst. One night the whispers said, "We'll never manage, because
              we can't <i>see</i> him, and so can't point him out to the people."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1603">They sighed; then one said: "We must bring Sherlock Holmes. He can be here in twelve
              days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1606">They all agreed, and whispered and jibbered with joy. But my heart broke; for I had
              read about that man, and knew what it would be to have him upon my track, with his
              superhuman penetration and tireless energies. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1610">The spirits went away to fetch him, and I got up at once in the middle of the night
              and fled away, carrying nothing but the hand-bag that had my money in it—thirty
              thousand dollars; two-thirds of it are in the bag there yet. It was forty days before
              that man caught up on my track. I just escaped. From habit he had written his real
              name on a tavern register, but had scratched it out and written "Dagget Barclay" in
              the place of it. But fear gives you a watchful eye and keen, and I read the true name
              through the scratches, and fled like a deer. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1613">He has hunted me all over this world for three years and a half—the Pacific
              states, Australasia, India—everywhere you can think of; then back to Mexico and
              up to California again, giving me hardly any rest; but that name on the registers
              always saved me, and what is left of me is alive yet. And I am <i>so</i> tired! A cruel time he has given me, yet I give you my honor I have never
              harmed him nor any man. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1619">That was the end of the story, and it stirred those boys to bloodheat, he sure of
              it. As for me—each word burnt a hole in me where it struck. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1622">We voted that the old man should bunk with us, and be my guest and Hillyer's. I
              shall keep my own counsel, naturally; but as soon as he is well rested and nourished,
              I shall take him to Denver and rehabilitate his fortunes. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1625">The boys gave the old fellow the bone-smashing good-fellowship handshake of the
              mines, and then scattered away to spread the news. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1628">At dawn next morning Wells-Fargo Ferguson and Ham Sandwich called us softly out, and
              said, privately: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1631">"That news about the way that old stranger has been treated has spread all around,
              and the camps are up. They are piling in from everywhere, and are going to lynch the
              P'fessor. Constable Harris is in a dead funk, and has telephoned the sheriff. Come
              along!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1634">We started on a run. The others were privileged to feel as they chose, but in my
              heart's privacy I hoped the sheriff would arrive in time; for I had small desire that
              Sherlock Holmes should hang for my deeds, as you can easily believe. I had heard a
              good deal about the sheriff, but </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1637">for reassurance's sake I asked: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1640">"Can he stop a mob?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1643">"Can <i>he</i> stop a mob! Can Jack <i>Fairfax</i>
              stop a mob! Well, I should smile! Ex-desperado—nineteen scalps on his string.
              Can <i>he!</i> Oh, I <i>say!"</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1659">As we tore up the gulch, distant cries and shouts and yells rose faintly on the
              still air, and grew steadily in strength as we raced along. Roar after roar burst out,
              stronger and stronger, nearer and nearer; and at last, when we closed up upon the
              multitude massed in the open area in front of the tavern, the crash of sound was
              deafening. Some brutal roughs from Daly's gorge had Holmes in their grip, and he was
              the calmest man there; a contemptuous smile played about his lips, and if any fear of
              death was in his British heart, his iron personality was master of it and no sign of
              it was allowed to appear. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1662">"Come to a vote, men!" This from one of the Daly gang, Shadbelly Higgins. "Quick! is
              it hang, or shoot?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1665">"Neither!" shouted one of his comrades. "He'll he alive again in a week; burning's
              the only permanency for <i>him."</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1671">The gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a thundercrash of approval, and
              went struggling and surging toward the prisoner, and closed around him, shouting,
              "Fire! fire's the ticket!" They dragged him to the horse-post, backed him against it,
              chained him to it, and piled wood and pine cones around him waist-deep. Still the
              strong face did not blench, and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1674">"A match! fetch a match!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1677">Shadbelly struck it, shaded it with his hand, stooped, and held it under a pine
              cone. A deep silence fell upon the mob. The cone caught, a tiny flame flickered about
              it a moment or two. I seemed to catch the sound of distant hoofs—it grew more
              distinct—still more and more distinct, more and more definite, but the absorbed
              crowd did not appear to notice it. The match went out. The man struck another,
              stooped, and again the flame rose; this time it took hold and began to
              spread—here and there men turned away their faces. The executioner stood with
              the charred match in his fingers, watching his work. The hoof-beats turned a
              projecting crag, and now they came thundering down upon us. Almost the next moment
              there was a shout: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1680">"The sheriff!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1683">And straightway he came tearing into the midst, stood his horse almost on his hind
              feet, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1686">"Fall back, you gutter-snipes!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1689">He was obeyed. By all but their leader. He stood his ground, and his hand went to
              his revolver. The sheriff covered him promptly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1692">"Drop your hand, you parlor desperado. Kick the fire away. Now unchain the
              stranger." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1696">The parlor desperado obeyed. Then the sheriff made a speech; sitting his horse at
              martial ease, and not warming his words with any touch of fire, but delivering them in
              a measured and deliberate way, and in a tone which harmonized with their character and
              made them impressively disrespectful. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1699">"You're a nice lot—now ain't you? Just about eligible to travel with this bilk
              here—Shadbelly Higgins—this loud-mouthed sneak that shoots people in the
              back and calls himself a desperado. If there's anything I do particularly despise,
              it's a lynching mob; I've never seen one that had a man in it. It has to tally up a
              hundred against one before it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor. It's
              made up of cowards, and so is the community that breeds it; and ninety-nine times out
              of a hundred the sheriff's another one." He paused—apparently to turn that last
              idea over in his mind and taste the juice of it—then he went on: "The sheriff
              that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the lowest-down coward there is. By
              the statistics there was a hundred and eighty-two of them drawing sneak pay in America
              last year. By the way it's going, pretty soon there 'll be a new disease in the
                doctor-books—<i>sheriff complaint."</i> That idea pleased
              him—any one could see it. "People will say, 'Sheriff sick again?' 'Yes; got the
              same old thing.' And next there 'll be a new title. People won't say, 'He's running
              for sheriff of Rapaho County,' for instance; they'll say, 'He's running for Coward of
              Rapaho.' Lord, the idea of a grown-up person being afraid of a lynch mob!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1705">He turned an eye on the captive, and said, "Stranger, who are you, and what have you
              been doing?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1708">"My name is Sherlock Holmes, and I have not been doing anything." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1711">It was wonderful, the impression which the sound of that name made on the sheriff,
              notwithstanding he must have come posted. He spoke up with feeling, and said it was a
              blot on the county that a man whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their
              fame and their ingenuity, and whose histories of them had won every reader's heart by
              the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting, should be visited under the Stars
              and Stripes by an outrage like this. He apologized in the name of the whole nation,
              and made Holmes a most handsome bow, and told Constable Harris to see him to his
              quarters, and hold himself personally responsible if he was molested again. Then he
              turned to the mob and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1714">"Hunt your holes, you scum!" which they did; then he said: "Follow me, Shadbelly;
              I'll take care of your case myself. No—keep your popgun; whenever I see the day
              that I'll be afraid to have you behind me with that thing, it 'll be time for me to
              join last year's hundred and eighty-two"; and he rode off in a walk, Shadbelly
              following. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1717">When we were on our way back to our cabin, toward breakfast-time, we ran upon the
              news that Fetlock Jones had escaped from his lock-up in the night and is gone! Nobody
              is sorry. Let his uncle track him out if he likes; it is in his line; the camp is not
              interested.</p>Chapter X<p id="TwaDoubd1e1723"><i>Ten days later.</i>

            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1736">As we were starting, this morning, Hillyer whispered to me: "Keep this news from

There has been a
            wedding, between a handsome young man of slender means and a rich young girl—a
            case of love at first sight and a precipitate marriage; a marriage bitterly opposed by
            the girl's widowed father. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e140">Jacob Fuller, the bridegroom, is twenty-six years old, is of an old but unconsidered
            family which had by compulsion emigrated from Sedgemoor, and for King James's purse's
            profit, so everybody said—some maliciously the rest merely because they believed
            it. The bride is nineteen and beautiful. She is intense, high-strung, romantic,
            immeasurably proud of her Cavalier blood, and passionate in her love for her young
            husband. For its sake she braved her father's displeasure, endured his reproaches,
            listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions and went from his house
            without his blessing, proud and happy in the proofs she was thus giving of the quality
            of the affection which had made its home in her heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e142">The morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her. Her husband put aside
            her proffered caresses, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e144">"Sit down. I have something to say to you. I loved you. That was before I asked your
            father to give you to me. His refusal is not my grievance—I could have endured
            that. But the things he said of me to you—that is a different matter.
            There—you needn't speak; I know quite well what they were; I got them from
            authentic sources. Among other things he said that my character was written in my face;
            that I was treacherous, a dissembler, a coward, and a brute without sense of pity or
            compassion: the 'Sedgemoor trade-mark,' he called it—and 'white-sleeve badge.' Any
            other man in my place would have gone to his house and shot him down like a dog. I
            wanted to do it, and was minded to do it, but a better thought came to me: to put him to
            shame; to break his heart; to kill him by inches. How to do it? Through my treatment of
            you, his idol! I would marry you; and then—Have patience. You will see. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e146">From that moment onward, for three months, the young wife suffered all the
            humiliations, all the insults, all the miseries that the diligent and inventive mind of
            the husband could contrive, save physical injuries only. Her strong pride stood by her,
            and she kept the secret of her troubles. Now and then the husband said, "Why don't you
            go to your father and tell him?" Then he invented new tortures, applied them, and asked
            again. She always answered, "He shall never know by my mouth," and taunted him with his
            origin; said she was the lawful slave of a scion of slaves, and must obey, and
            would—up to that point, but no further; he could kill her if he liked, but he
            could not break her; it was not in the Sedgemoor breed to do it. At the end of the three
            months he said, with a dark significance in his manner, "I have tried all things but
            one"—and waited for her reply. "Try that," she said, and curled her lip in
            mockery. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e148">That night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes, then said to her: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e150">"Get up and dress!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e152">She obeyed—as always, without a word. He led her half a mile from the house, and
            proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public road; and succeeded, she
            screaming and struggling. He gagged her then, struck her across the face with his
            cowhide, and set his bloodhounds on her. They tore the clothes off her, and she was
            naked. He called the dogs off, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e154">"You will be found—by the passing public. They will be dropping along about three
            hours from now, and will spread the news—do you hear? Good-by. You have seen the
            last of me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e156">He went away then. She moaned to herself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e159">"I shall bear a child—to <i>him!</i> God grant it may be a boy!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e164">The farmers released her by and by—and spread the news, which was natural. They
            raised the country with lynching intentions, but the bird had flown. The young wife shut
            herself up in her father's house; he shut himself up with her, and thenceforth would see
            no one. His pride was broken, and his heart; so he wasted away, day by day, and even his
            daughter rejoiced when death relieved him. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e166">Then she sold the estate and disappeared.</p>Chapter 2<p id="TwaDoubd1e171">In 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded New England village,
            with no company but a little boy about five years old. She did her own work, she
            discouraged acquaintanceships, and had none. The butcher, the baker, and the others that
            served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was
            Stillman, and that she called the child Archy. Whence she came they had not been able to
            find out, but they said she talked like a Southerner. The child had no playmates and no
            comrade, and no teacher but the mother. She taught him diligently and intelligently, and
            was satisfied with the results—even a little proud of them. One day Archy said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e173">"Mamma, am I different from other children?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e175">"Well, I suppose not. Why?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e177">"There was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had been by and I
            said yes, and she said how long since I saw him and I said I hadn't seen him at all, and
            she said how did I know he'd been by, then, and I said because I smelt his track on the
            sidewalk, and she said I was a dum fool and made a mouth at me. What did she do that
            for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e179">The young woman turned white, and said to herself, "It's a birth mark! The gift of the
            bloodhound is in him." She snatched the boy to her breast and hugged him passionately,
            saying, "God has appointed the way!" Her eyes were burning with a fierce light, and her
            breath came short and quick with excitement. She said to herself: "The puzzle is solved
            now; many a time it has been a mystery to me, the impossible things the child has done
            in the dark, but it is all clear to me now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e181">She set him in his small chair, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e183">"Wait a little till I come, dear; then we will talk about the matter." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e185">She went up to her room and took from her dressing-table several small articles and put
            them out of sight: a nail-file on the floor under the bed; a pair of nail-scissors under
            the bureau; a small ivory paper-knife under the wardrobe. Then she returned, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e187">"There! I have left some things which I ought to have brought down." She named them,
            and said, "Run up and bring them, dear." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e189">The child hurried away on his errand and was soon back again with the things. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e192">"Did you have any difficulty, dear?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e194">"No, mamma; I only went where you went." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e196">During his absence she had stepped to the bookcase, taken several books from the bottom
            shelf, opened each, passed her hand over a page, noting its number in her memory, then
            restored them to their places. Now she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e198">"I have been doing something while you have been gone, Archy. Do you think you can find
            out what it was?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e200">The boy went to the bookcase and got out the books that had been touched, and opened
            them at the pages which had been stroked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e202">The mother took him in her lap, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e204">"I will answer your question now, dear. I have found out that in one way you are quite
            different from other people. You can see in the dark, you can smell what other people
            cannot, you have the talents of a bloodhound. They are good and valuable things to have,
            but you must keep the matter a secret. If people found it out, they would speak of you
            as an odd child, a strange child, and children would be disagreeable to you, and give
            you nicknames. In this world one must be like everybody else if he doesn't want to
            provoke scorn or envy or jealousy. It is a great and fine distinction which has been
            born to you, and I am glad; but you will keep it a secret, for mamma's sake, won't you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e206">The child promised, without understanding. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e208">All the rest of the day the mother's brain was busy with excited thinkings; with plans,
            projects, schemes, each and all of them uncanny, grim, and dark. Yet they lit up her
            face; lit it with a fell light of their own; lit it with vague fires of hell. She was in
            a fever of unrest; she could not sit, stand, read, sew; there was no relief for her but
            in movement. She tested her boy's gift in twenty ways, and kept saying to herself all
            the time, with her mind in the past: "He broke my father's heart, and night and day all
            these years I have tried, and all in vain, to think out a way to break his. I have found
            it now—I have found it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e210">When night fell, the demon of unrest still possessed her. She went on with her tests;
            with a candle she traversed the house from garret to cellar, hiding pins, needles,
            thimbles, spools, under pillows, under carpets, in cracks in the walls, under the coal
            in the bin; then sent the little fellow in the dark to find them; which he did, and was
            happy and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e212">From this time forward life took on a new complexion for her. She said, "The future is
            secure—I can wait, and enjoy the waiting." The most of her lost interests revived.
            She took up music again, and languages, drawing, painting, and the other long-discarded
            delights of her maidenhood. She was happy once more, and felt again the zest of life. As
            the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy, and was contented with it.
            Not altogether, but nearly that. The soft side of his heart was larger than the other
            side of it. It was his only defect, in her eyes. But she considered that his love for
            her and worship of her made up for it. He was a good hater—that was well; but it
            was a question if the materials of his hatreds were of as tough and enduring a quality
            as those of his friendships—and that was not so well. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e215">The years drifted on. Archy was become a handsome, shapely, athletic youth, courteous,
            dignified, companionable, pleasant in his ways, and looking perhaps a trifle older than
            he was, which was sixteen. One evening his mother said she had something of grave
            importance to say to him, adding that he was old enough to hear it now, and old enough
            and possessed of character enough and stability enough to carry out a stern plan which
            she had been for years contriving and maturing. Then she told him her bitter story, in
            all its naked atrociousness. For a while the boy was paralyzed; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e217">"I understand. We are Southerners; and by our custom and nature there is but one
            atonement. I will search him out and kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e219">"Kill him? No! Death is release, emancipation; death is a favor. Do I owe him favors?
            You must not hurt a hair of his head." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e221">The boy was lost in thought awhile; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e223">"You are all the world to me, and your desire is my law and my pleasure. Tell me what
            to do and I will do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e225">The mother's eyes beamed with satisfaction, and she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e227">"You will go and find him. I have known his hiding-place for eleven years; it cost me
            five years and more of inquiry, and much money, to locate it. He is a quartz-miner in
            Colorado, and well-to-do. He lives in Denver. His name is Jacob Fuller. There—it
            is the first time I have spoken it since that unforgettable night. Think! That name
            could have been yours if I had not saved you that shame and furnished you a cleaner one.
            You will drive him from that place; you will hunt him down and drive him again; and yet
            again, and again, and again, persistently, relentlessly, poisoning his life, filling it
            with mysterious terrors, loading it with weariness and misery, making him wish for
            death, and that he had a suicide's courage; you will make of him another Wandering Jew;
            he shall know no rest any more, no peace of mind, no placid sleep; you shall shadow him,
            cling to him, persecute him, till you break his heart, as he broke my father's and
            mine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e229">"I will obey, mother." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e231">"I believe it, my child. The preparations are all made; everything is ready. Here is a
            letter of credit; spend freely, there is no lack of money. At times you may need
            disguises. I have provided them; also some other conveniences." She took from the drawer
            of the typewriter-table several squares of paper. They all bore these typewritten
            words:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e233"><i>$10,000 REWARD</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e237"><i>It is believed that a certain man who is wanted in an Eastern
                state is sojourning here. In 1880, in the night, he tied his young wife to a tree by
                the public road, cut her across the face with a cowhide, and made his dogs tear her
                clothes from her, leaving her naked. He left her there, and fled the country. A
                blood-relative of hers has searched for him for seventeen years. Address . . . . . .

                Fuller. I have his scent; I could track him through ten divisions of infantry and
                find him. I have often been near him and heard him talk. He owns a good mine, and
                has a fair income from it; but he is not rich. He learned mining in a good
                way—by working at it for wages. He is a cheerful creature, and his forty-three
                years sit lightly upon him; he could pass for a younger man—say thirty-six or
                thirty-seven. He has never married again—passes himself off for a widower. He
                stands well, is liked, is popular, and has many friends. Even I feel a drawing
                toward him—the paternal blood in me making its claim. How blind and
                unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature—the most of them, in
                fact! My task is become hard now—you realize it? you comprehend, and make
                allowances?—and the fire of it has cooled, more than I like to confess to
                myself, But I will carry it out. Even with the pleasure paled, the duty remains, and
                I will not spare him.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e286"><i>And for my help, a sharp resentment rises in me when I reflect
                that he who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not suffered by it.
                The lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character, and in the change he is
                happy. He, the guilty party, is absolved from all suffering; you, the innocent, are
                borne down with it. But be comforted—he shall harvest his share.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e290">SILVER GULCH, <i>May 19</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e295"><i>I placarded Form No. 1 at midnight of April 3; an hour later I
                slipped Form No. 2 under his chamber door, notifying him to leave Denver at or
                before 11.50 the night of the 14th.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e299"><i>Some late bird of a reporter stole one of my placards, then hunted
                the town over and found the other one, and stole that. In this manner he
                accomplished what the profession call a "scoop"—that is, he got a valuable
                item, and saw to it that no other paper got it. And so his paper—the principal
                one in the town—had it in glaring type on the editorial page in the morning,
                followed by a Vesuvian opinion of our wretch a column long, which wound up by adding
                a thousand dollars to our reward on the paper's account! The journals out here know
                how to do the noble thing—when there's business in it.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e303"><i>At breakfast I occupied my usual seat—selected because it
                afforded a view of papa Fuller's face, and was near enough for me to hear the talk
                that went on at his table. Seventy-five or a hundred people were in the room, and
                all discussing that item, and saying they hoped the seeker would find that rascal
                and remove the pollution of his presence from the town—with a rail, or a
                bullet, or something.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e307"><i>When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leave—folded
                up—in one hand, and the newspaper in the other; and it gave me more than half
                a pang to see him. His cheerfulness was all gone, and he looked old and pinched and
                ashy. And then—only think of the things he had to listen to! Mamma, he heard
                his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and characterizations drawn
                from the very dictionaries and phrase-books of Satan's own authorized editions down
                below. And more than that, he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them. His
                applause tasted bitter in his mouth, though; he could not disguise that from me; and
                it was observable that his appetite was gone; he only nibbled; he couldn't eat.
                Finally a man said:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e311"><i>"It is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing
                what this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel. I hope so."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e316"><i>Ah, dear, it was pitiful the way Fuller winced, and glanced around
                scared! He couldn't endure any more, and got up and left.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e320"><i>During several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in
                Mexico, and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could, and give the
                property his personal attention. He played his cards well; said he would take
                $40,000—a quarter in cash, the rest in safe notes; but that as he greatly
                needed money on account of his new purchase, he would diminish his terms for cash in
                full, He sold out for $30,000. And then, what do you think he did? He asked for
                greenbacks, and took them, saying the man in Mexico was a New-Englander, with a head
                full of crotchets, and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts. People thought it
                queer, since a draft on New York could produce greenbacks quite conveniently. There
                was talk of this odd thing, but only for a day; that is as long as any topic lasts
                in Denver.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e324"><i>I was watching, all the time. As soon as the sale was completed
                and the money paid—which was on the 11th—I began to stick to Fuller's
                track without dropping it for a moment. That night—no, 12th, for it was a
                little past midnight—I tracked him to his room, which was four doors from mine
                in the same hall; then I went back and put on my muddy day-laborer disguise,
                darkened my complexion, and sat down in my room in the gloom, with a gripsack handy,
                with a change in it, and my door ajar. For I suspected that the bird would take wing
                now. In half an hour an old woman passed by, carrying a grip: I caught the familiar
                whiff, and followed with my grip, for it was Fuller. He left the hotel by a side
                entrance, and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three
                blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness, and got into a two-horse hack, which of
                course was waiting for him by appointment. I took a seat (uninvited) on the trunk
                platform behind, and we drove briskly off. We drove ten miles, and the hack stopped
                at a way-station and was discharged. Fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow
                under the awning, as far as he could get from the light; I went inside, and watched
                the ticket-office. Fuller bought no ticket; I bought none. Presently the train came
                along, and he boarded a car; I entered the same car at the other end, and came down
                the aisle and took the seat behind him. When he paid the conductor and named his
                objective point, I dropped back several seats, while the conductor was changing a
                bill, and when he came to me I paid to the same place—about a hundred miles
                westward.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e328"><i>From that time for a week on end he led me a dance. He traveled
                here and there and yonder—always on a general westward trend—but he boas
                not a woman after the first day. He was a laborer, like myself, and wore bushy false
                whiskers. His outfit was perfect, and he could do the character without thinking
                about it, for he had served the trade for wages. His nearest friend could not have
                recognized him. At last he located himself here, the obscurest little mountain camp
                in Montana; he has a shanty, and goes out prospecting daily; is gone all day, and
                avoids society. I am living at a miner's boardinghouse, and it is an awful place:
                the bunks, the food, the dirt—everything.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e332"><i>We have been here four weeks, and in that time I have seen him but
                once; but every night I go over his track and post myself. As soon as he engaged a
                shanty here I went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed that Denver hotel to
                keep my baggage till I should send for it. I need nothing here but a change of army
                shirts, and I brought that with me.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e336">SILVER GULCH, <i>June 12</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e341"><i>The Denver episode has never found its way here, I think. I know
                the most of the men in camp, and they have never referred to it, at least in my
                hearing. Fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions. He has located a
                claim, two miles away, in an out-of-the-way place in the mountains; it promises very
                well, and he is working it diligently. Ah, but the change in him! He never smiles,
                and he keeps quite to himself, consorting with no one—he who was so fond of
                company and so cheery only two months ago. I have seen him passing along several
                times recently—drooping, forlorn, the spring gone from his step, a pathetic
                figure. He calls himself David Wilson.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e345"><i>I can trust him to remain here until we disturb him. Since you
                insist, I will banish him again, but I do not see how he can be unhappier than he
                already is. I will go hack to Denver and treat myself to a little season of comfort,
                and edible food, and endurable beds, and bodily decency; then I will fetch my
                things, and notify poor papa Wilson to move on.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e349">DENVER, <i>June 19 </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e354"><i>They miss him here. They all hope he is prospering in Mexico, and

                you would have charity for me. Yes, I know what you will say, and you are right: if

                wear his own name after that fiendish deed! The Denver Fuller is four years younger
                than the other one; he came here a young widower in '79, aged twenty-one—a
                year before you were married; and the documents to prove it are innumerable. Last
                night I talked with familiar friends of his who have known him from the day of his
                arrival. I said nothing, but a few days from now I will land him in this town again,
                with the loss upon his mine made good; and there will be a banquet, and a
                torch-light procession, and there will not be any expense on anybody but me. Do you
                call this "gush"? I am only a boy, as you well know; it is</i> my <i>privilege. By and by I shall not be a boy any more.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e389">SILVER GULCH, <i>July 3</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e394"><i>Mother, he is gone! Gone, and left no trace. The scent was cold

                to-night, in a wagon—two or three hours of that, then I get a train. I don't
                know where I'm going, but I must go; to try to keep still would be
            torture.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e398"><i>Of course he has effaced himself with a new name and a disguise.

                advertise for him. But if there is any way to do it that would not frighten him, I
                have not been able to think it out, and I have tried till my brains are addled. "If
                the gentleman who lately bought a mine in Mexico and sold one in Denver will send
                his address to" (to whom, mother!), "it will be explained to him that it was all a
                mistake; his forgiveness will be asked, and full reparation made for a loss which he
                sustained in a certain matter." Do you see? He would think it a trap. Well, any one
                would. If I should say, "It is now known that he was not the man wanted, but another
                man—a man who once bore the same name, but discarded it for good
                reasons"—would that answer? But the Denver people would wake up then and say
                "Oho!" and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks, and say, "Why did he
                run away if he wasn't the right man?—it is too thin." If I failed to find him
                he would be ruined there—there where there is no taint upon him now. You have
                a better head than mine. Help me.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e412"><i>I have one clue, and only one. I know his handwriting. If he puts
                his new false name upon a hotel register and does not disguise it too much, it will
                be valuable to me if I ever run across it.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e416">SAN FRANCISCO, <i>June 28, 1898</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e421"><i>You already know how well I have searched the states from Colorado

                close miss. It was here, yesterday. I struck his trail,</i> hot, <i>on the street, and followed it on a run to a cheap hotel. That was a costly
                mistake; a dog would have gone the other way. But I am only part dog, and can get
                very humanly stupid when excited. He had been stopping in that house ten days; I
                almost know, now, that he stops long nowhere, the past six or eight months, but is
                restless and has to keep moving. I understand that feeling! and I know what it is to
                feel it. He still uses the name he had registered when I came so near catching him
                nine months ago—"James Walker"; doubtless the same he adopted when he fled
                from Silver Gulch. An unpretending man, and has small taste for fancy names. I
                recognized the hand easily, through its slight disguise. A square man, and not good
                at shams and pretenses.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e428"><i>They said he was just gone, on a journey; left no address; didn't
                say where he was going; looked frightened when asked to leave his address; had no
                baggage but a cheap valise; carried it off on foot—a "stingy old person, and
                not much loss to the house." "</i>Old!" <i>I suppose he is, now I
                hardly heard; I was there but a moment. I rushed along his trail, and it led me to a
                wharf. Mother, the smoke of the steamer he had taken was just fading out on the
                horizon! I should have saved half on hour if I had gone in the right direction at
                first. I could have taken a fast tug, and should have stood a chance of catching
                that vessel. She is bound for Melbourne.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e436">HOPE CAÑON, CALIFORNIA, <i>October 3, 1900 </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e441"><i>You have a right to complain. "A letter a year"</i> is <i>a paucity; I freely acknowledge it; but how can one write when there

                Hope Cañon; I traced him to a point thirty miles from here, but there I lost
                the trail; some one gave him a lift in a wagon, I suppose. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e463"><i>I am taking a rest, now—modified by searchings for the lost

                fellows, and I am used to their sort this long time back; and their breezy ways
                freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles. I have been here a month. I am
                cabining with a young fellow named "Sammy" Hillyer, about twenty-five, the only son
                of his mother—like me—and loves her dearly, and writes to her every
                week—part of which is like me. He is a timid body, and in the matter of
                intellect—well, he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire; but no
                matter, he is well liked; he is good and fine, and it is meat and bread and rest and
                luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again. I wish "James Walker"
                could have it. He had friends; he liked company. That brings up that picture of him,
                the time that I saw him last. The pathos of it! It comes before me often and often.
                At that very time, poor thing, I was girding up my conscience to make him move on
                again!</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e467"><i>Hillyer's heart is better than mine, better than anybody's in the
                community, I suppose, for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the
                camp—Flint Buckner—and the only man Flint ever talks with or allows to
                talk with him. He says he knows Flint's history, and that it is trouble that has
                made him what he is, and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can. Now
                none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a lodger like Flint
                Buckner, from all I hear about him outside. I think that this one detail will give
                you a better idea of Sammy's character than any labored-out description I could
                furnish you of him. In one of our talks he said something about like this: "Flint is
                a kinsman of mine, and he pours out all his troubles to me—empties his breast
                from time to time, or I reckon it would burst. There couldn't be any unhappier man,
                Archy Stillman; his life had been made up of misery of mind—he isn't near as
                old as he looks. He has lost the feel of reposefulness and peace—oh, years and
                years ago! He doesn't know what good luck is—never has had any; often says he
                wishes he was in the other hell, he is so tired of this one."</i></p>Chapter IV<p id="TwaDoubd1e474"><i>No real gentleman will tell the naked truth in the presence of
              ladies.</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e478">It was a crisp and spicy morning in early October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with
            the glory-fires of autumn, hung burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge
            provided by kind Nature for the wingless wild things that have their homes in the
            tree-tops and would visit together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and
            yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the
            sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere;
            far in he empty sky a solitary esophagus[1] slept upon motionless
            wing; everywhere brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e483">October is the time—1900; Hope Cañon is the place, a silver-mining camp
            away down in the Esmeralda region. It is a secluded spot, high and remote; recent as to
            discovery; thought by its occupants to be rich in metal—a year or two's
            prospecting will decide that matter one way or the other. For inhabitants, the camp has
            about two hundred miners, one white woman and child, several Chinese washermen, five
            squaws, and a dozen vagrant buck Indians in rabbit-skin robes, battered plug hats, and
            tin-can necklaces. There are no mills as yet; no church, no newspaper. The camp has
            existed but two years; it has made no big strike; the world is ignorant of its name and
            place. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e485">On both sides of the cañon the mountains rise wall-like, three thousand feet,
            and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the
            sun only once a day, when he sails over at noon. The village is a couple of miles long;
            the cabins stand well apart from each other. The tavern is the only "frame"
            house—the only house, one might say. It occupies a central position, and is the
            evening resort of the population. They drink there, and play seven-up and dominoes; also
            billiards, for there is a table, crossed all over with torn places repaired with
            court-plaster; there are some cues, but no leathers; some chipped balls which clatter
            when they run, and do not slow up gradually, but stop suddenly and sit down; there is a
            part of a cube of chalk, with a projecting jag of flint in it; and the man who can score
            six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bar's expense. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e487">Flint Buckner's cabin was the last one of the village, going south; his silver-claim
            was at the other end of the village, northward, and a little beyond the last hut in that
            direction. He was a sour creature, unsociable, and had no companionships. People who had
            tried to get acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him. His history was not
            known. Some believed that Sammy Hillyer knew it; others said no. If asked, Hillyer said
            no, he was not acquainted with it. Flint had a meek English youth of sixteen or
            seventeen with him, whom he treated roughly, both in public and in private; and of
            course this lad was applied to for information, but with no success. Fetlock
            Jones—name of the youth—said that Flint picked him up on a prospecting
            tramp, and as he had neither home nor friends in America, he had found it wise to stay
            and take Buckner's hard usage for the sake of the salary, which was bacon and beans.
            Further than this he could offer no testimony. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e489">Fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now, and under his meek exterior he was
            slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and humiliations which his master had put
            upon him. For the meek suffer bitterly from these hurts; more bitterly, perhaps, than do
            the manlier sort, who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the limit of
            endurance has been reached. Good-hearted people wanted to help Fetlock out of his
            trouble, and tried to get him to leave Buckner; but the boy showed fright at the
            thought, and said he "dasn't." Pat Riley urged him, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e491">"You leave the damned hunks and come with me; don't you be afraid. I'll take care of
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e496">The boy thanked him with tears in his eyes, but shuddered and said he "dasn't risk it";
            he said Flint would catch him alone, some time, in the night, and then—"Oh, it
            makes me sick, Mr. Riley, to think of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e498">Others said, "Run away from him; we'll stake you; skip out for the coast some night."
            But all these suggestions failed; he said Flint would hunt him down and fetch him back,
            just for meanness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e500">The people could not understand this. The boy's miseries went steadily on, week after
            week. It is quite likely that the people would have understood if they had known how he
            was employing his spare time. He slept in an out-cabin near Flint's; and there, nights,
            he nursed his bruises and his humiliations, and studied and studied over a single
            problem—how he could murder Flint Buckner and not be found out. It was the only
            joy he had in life; these hours were the only ones in the twenty-four which he looked
            forward to with eagerness and spent in happiness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e503">He thought of poison. No—that would not serve; the inquest would reveal where it
            was procured and who had procured it. He thought of a shot in the back in a lonely place
            when Flint would be homeward bound at midnight—his unvarying hour for the trip.
            No—somebody might be near, and catch him. He thought of stabbing him in his sleep.
            No—he might strike an inefficient blow, and Flint would seize him. He examined a
            hundred different ways—none of them would answer; for in even the very obscurest
            and secretest of them there was always the fatal defect of a <i>risk,</i> a chance, a possibility that he might be found out. He would have none of
            that. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e508">But he was patient, endlessly patient. There was no hurry, he said to himself. He would
            never leave Flint till he left him a corpse; there was no hurry—he would find the
            way. It was somewhere, and he would endure shame and pain and misery until he found it.
            Yes, somewhere there was a way which would leave not a trace, not even the faintest clue
            to the murderer—there was no hurry—he would find that way, and
            then—oh, then, it would just be good to be alive! Meantime he would diligently
            keep up his reputation for meekness; and also, as always theretofore, he would allow no
            one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about his oppressor. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e510">Two days before the before-mentioned October morning Flint had bought some things, and
            he and Fetlock had brought them home to Flint's cabin: a fresh box of candles, which
            they put in the corner; a tin can of blasting-powder, which they placed upon the
            candle-box; a keg of blasting-powder, which they placed under Flint's bunk; a huge coil
            of fuse, which they hung on a peg. Fetlock reasoned that Flint's mining operations had
            outgrown the pick, and that blasting was about to begin now. He had seen blasting done,
            and he had a notion of the process, but he had never helped in it. His conjecture was
            right—blasting-time had come. In the morning the pair carried fuse, drills, and
            the powder-can to the shaft; it was now eight feet deep, and to get into it and out of
            it a short ladder was used. They descended, and by command Fetlock held the
            drill—without any instructions as to the right way to hold it—and Flint
            proceeded to strike. The sledge came down; the drill sprang out of Fetlock's hand,
            almost as a matter of course. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e512">"You mangy son of a nigger, is that any way to hold a drill? Pick it up! Stand it up!
            There—hold fast. D— you! <i>I'll</i> teach you!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e517">At the end of an hour the drilling was finished. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e519">"Now, then, charge it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e521">The boy started to pour in the powder. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e523">"Idiot!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e525">A heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e527">"Get up! You can't lie sniveling there. Now, then, stick in the fuse <i>first. Now</i> put in the powder. Hold on, hold on! Are you going to fill the hole
              <i>all</i> up? Of all the sap-headed milksops I—Put in some
            dirt! Put in some gravel! Tamp it down! Hold on, hold on! Oh, great Scott! get out of
            the way!" He snatched the iron and tamped the charge himself, meantime cursing and
            blaspheming like a fiend. Then he fired the fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and ran
            fifty yards away, Fetlock following. They stood waiting a few minutes, then a great
            volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion; after a
            little there was a shower of descending stones; then all was serene again. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e535">"I wish to God you'd been in it!" remarked the master. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e538">They went down the shaft, cleaned it out, drilled another hole, and put in another
            charge. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e540">"Look here! How much fuse are you proposing to waste? Don't you know how to time a
            fuse?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e542">"No, sir." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e544">"You <i>don't!</i> Well, if you don't beat anything <i>I</i> ever saw!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e552">He climbed out of the shaft and spoke down: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e554">"Well, idiot, are you going to be all day? Cut the fuse and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e556">The trembling creature began: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e558">"If you please, sir, I—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e560">"You talk back to <i>me?</i> Cut it and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e565">The boy cut and lit. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e567">"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! I wish you were in—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e570">In his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft and ran. The boy was aghast. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e572">"Oh, my God! Help. Help! Oh, save me!" he implored. "Oh, what can I do! What <i>can</i> I do!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e577">He backed against the wall as tightly as he could; the sputtering fuse frightened the
            voice out of him; his breath stood still; he stood gazing and impotent; in two seconds,
            three seconds, four he would be flying toward the sky torn to fragments. Then he had an
            inspiration. He sprang at the fuse; severed the inch of it that was left above ground,
            and was saved. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e579">He sank down limp and half lifeless with fright, his strength gone; but he muttered
            with a deep joy: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e581">"He has learnt me! I knew there was a way, if I would wait." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e583">After a matter of five minutes Buckner stole to the shaft, looking worried and uneasy,
            and peered down into it. He took in the situation; he saw what had happened. He lowered
            the ladder, and the boy dragged himself weakly up it. He was very white. His appearance
            added something to Buckner's uncomfortable state, and he said, with a show of regret and
            sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from lack of practice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e585">"It was an accident, you know. Don't say anything about it to anybody; I was excited,
            and didn't notice what I was doing. You're not looking well; you've worked enough for
            to-day; go down to my cabin and eat what you want, and rest. It's just an accident, you
            know, on account of my being excited." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e587">"It scared me," said the lad, as he started away; "but I learnt something, so I don't
            mind it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e589">"Damned easy to please!" muttered Buckner, following him with his eye. I wonder if
            he'll tell? Mightn't he?... I wish it <i>had</i> killed him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e594">The boy took no advantage of his holiday in the matter of resting; he employed it in
            work, eager and feverish and happy work. A thick growth of chaparral extended down the
            mountainside clear to Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's labor was done in the dark
            intricacies of that stubborn growth; the rest of it was done in his own shanty. At last
            all was complete, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e596">"If he's got any suspicions that I'm going to tell on him, he won't keep them long,
            to-morrow. He will see that I am the same milksop as I always was—all day and the
            next. And the day after to-morrow night there 'll be an end of him; nobody will ever
            guess who finished him up nor how it was done. He dropped me the idea his own self, and
            that's odd."</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e602"> From the Springfield <i>Republican,</i> April 12, 1902.</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e607">To the Editor of the
                  Republican:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e610"><i>One of your citizens has asked me a
                  question about the "esophagus," and I wish to answer him through you. This in the
                  hope that the answer will get around, and save me some penmanship, for I have
                  already replied to the same question more than several times, and am not getting
                  as much holiday as I ought to have.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e614"><i>I
                  published a short story lately, and it was in that that I put the esophagus. I
                  will say privately that I expected it to bother some people—in fact, that
                  was the intention—but the harvest has been larger than I was calculating
                  upon. The esophagus has gathered in the guilty and the innocent alike, whereas I
                  was only fishing for the innocent—the innocent and confiding. I knew a few
                  of these would write and ask me; that would give me but little trouble; but, I was
                  not expecting that the wise and the learned would call upon me for succor.
                  However, that has happened, and it is time for me to speak up and stop the
                  inquiries if I can, for letter-writing is not restful to me, and I am not having
                  so much fun out of this thing as I counted on. That you may understand the
                  situation, I will insert a couple of sample inquiries. The first is from a public
                  instructor in the Philippines: </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e618">SANTA CRUZ, <i>Ilocos, Sur, P. I. </i><br><i>February 13,

                  reading the first part of your latest story, entitled "A Double-barreled Detective
                  Story," and am very much delighted with it. In Part IV, page 264,</i> Harper's
                Magazine <i>for January, occurs this passage: "far in the empty sky a
                  solitary 'esophagus' slept upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness,
                  serenity, and the peace of God." Now, there is one word I do not understand,
                  namely, "esophagus." My only work of reference is the</i> Standard Dictionary,
                  <i>but that fails to explain the meaning. If you can spare the
                  time, I would be glad to have the meaning cleared up, as I consider the passage a
                  very touching and beautiful one. It may seem foolish to you, but consider my lack
                  of means away out in the northern part of Luzon.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e636"><i>Yours very truly.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e640"><i>Do you notice?
                  Nothing in the paragraph disturbed him but that one word. It shows that the
                  paragraph was most ably constructed for the deception it was intended to put upon
                  the reader. It was my intention that it should read plausibly, and it is now plain
                  that it does; it was my intention that it should be emotional and touching, and
                  you see, yourself, that it fetched this public instructor. Alas, If I had but left
                  that one treacherous word out, I should have scored! scored everywhere; and the
                  paragraph would have slidden through every reader's sensibilities like oil, and
                  left not a suspicion behind.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e644"><i>The other sample
                  inquiry is from a professor in a New England university. It contains one naughty
                  word (which I cannot bear to suppress), but he is not in the theological
                  department, so it is no harm:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e648"><i>Dear Mr.

                  keep one myself, but it never sleeps in the air or anywhere else. My profession is
                  to deal with words, and esophagus interested me the moment I lighted upon it. But
                  as a companion of my youth used to say, "I'll be eternally, co-eternally cussed"
                  if l can make it out. Is it a joke, or I an ignoramus?</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e661"><i>Between you and me, I was almost ashamed of having fooled that man,

                  him to carefully read the whole paragraph, and he would find not a vestige of

                  October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung
                  burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind nature for
                  the wingless wild things that have their home in the tree-tops and would visit
                  together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow flames in
                  brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the sensuous
                  fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere; far
                  in the empty sky a solitary esophagus slept upon motionless wings; everywhere
                  brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e692"><i>The success of Mark Twain's joke recalls to mind his story of the
                  petrified man in the cavern, whom he described most punctiliously, first giving a
                  picture of the scene, its impressive solitude, and all that; then going on to
                  describe the majesty of the figure, casually mentioning that the thumb of his
                  right hand rested against the side of his nose; then after further description
                  observing that the fingers of the right hand were extended in a radiating fashion;
                  and, recurring to the dignified attitude and position of the man, incidentally
                  remarked that the thumb of the left hand was in contact with the little finger of
                  the right—and so on. But was it so ingeniously written that Mark, relating
                  the history years later in an article which appeared in that excellent magazine of
                  the past, the</i> Galaxy, <i>declared that no one ever found out
                  the joke, and, if we remember aright, that that astonishing old mockery was
                  actually looked for in the region where he, as a Nevada newspaper editor, had
                  located it. It is certain that Mark Twain's jumping frog has a good many more
                  "pints" than any other frog.</i></p>Chapter V<p id="TwaDoubd1e702">The next day came and went. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e704">It is now almost midnight, and in five minutes the new morning will begin. The scene is
            in the tavern billiard-room. Rough men in rough clothing, slouch-hats, breeches stuffed
            into boot-tops, some with vests, none with coats, are grouped about the boiler-iron
            stove, which has ruddy cheeks and is distributing a grateful warmth; the billiard-balls
            are clacking; there is no other sound—that is, within; the wind is fitfully
            moaning without. The men look bored; also expectant. A hulking broad-shouldered miner,
            of middle age, with grizzled whiskers, and an unfriendly eye set in an unsociable face,
            rises, slips a coil of fuse upon his arm, gathers up some other personal properties, and
            departs without word or greeting to anybody. It is Flint Buckner. As the door closes
            behind him a buzz of talk breaks out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e706">"The regularest man that ever was," said Jake Parker, the blacksmith: "you can tell
            when it's twelve just by him leaving, without looking at your Waterbury." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e708">"And it's the only virtue he's got, as fur as I know," said Peter Hawes, miner. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e710">"He's just a blight on this society," said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "If I was
            running this shop I'd make him say something, <i>some</i> time or other,
            or vamos the ranch." This with a suggestive glance at the barkeeper, who did not choose
            to see it, since the man under discussion was a good customer, and went home pretty well
            set up, every night, with refreshments furnished from the bar. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e715">"Say," said Ham Sandwich, miner, "does any of you boys ever recollect of him asking you
            to take a drink?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e717"><i>"Him?</i> Flint <i>Buckner?</i> Oh, Laura!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e724">This sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous general outburst in one form of words or
            another from the crowd. After a brief silence, Pat Riley, miner, said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e726">"He's the 15-puzzle, that cuss. And his boy's another one. <i>I
            </i>can't make them out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e731">"Nor anybody else," said Ham Sandwich; "and if they are 15-puzzles how are you going to
            rank up that other one? When it comes to A 1 right-down solid mysteriousness, he lays
            over both of them. <i>Easy—</i>don't he?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e737">"You bet!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e739">Everybody said it. Every man but one. He was the new-comer-Peterson. He ordered the
            drinks all round, and asked who No. 3 might be. All answered at once, "Archy Stillman!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e741">"Is he a mystery?" asked Peterson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e743">"Is <i>he</i> a mystery? Is Archy <i>Stillman a</i>
            mystery?" said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "Why, the fourth dimension's foolishness to
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e754">For Ferguson was learned. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e756">Peterson wanted to hear all about him; everybody wanted to tell him; everybody began.
            But Billy Stevens, the barkeeper, called the house to order, and said one at a time was
            best. He distributed the drinks, and appointed Ferguson to lead. Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e758">"Well, he's a boy. And that is just about all we know about him. You can pump him till
            you are tired; it ain't any use; you won't get anything. At least about his intentions,
            or line of business, or where he's from, and such things as that. And as for getting at
            the nature and get-up of his main big chief mystery, why, he'll just change the subject,
            that's all. You can <i>guess</i> till you're black in the
            face—it's your privilege—but suppose you do, where do you arrive at?
            Nowhere, as near as I can make out," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e763">"What <i>is</i> his big chief one?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e768">"Sight, maybe. Hearing, maybe. Instinct, maybe. Magic, maybe. Take your
            choice—grownups, twenty-five; children and servants, half price. Now I'll tell you
            what he can do. You can start here, and just disappear; you can go and hide wherever you
            want to, I don't care where it is, nor how far—and he'll go straight and put his
            finger on you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e770">"You don't mean it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e772">"I just do, though. Weather's nothing to him—elemental conditions is nothing to
            him—he don't even take notice of them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e775">"Oh, come! Dark? Rain? Snow? Hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e777">"It's all the same to <i>him.</i> He don't give a damn." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e782">"Oh, <i>say—</i>including <i>fog,</i> per'aps?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e790"><i>"Fog!</i> he's got an eye 't can plunk through it like a bullet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e794">"Now, boys, honor bright, what's he giving me?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e796">"It's a fact!" they all shouted. "Go on, Wells-Fargo." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e798">"Well, sir, you can leave him here, chatting with the boys, and you can slip out and go
            to any cabin in this camp and open a book—yes, sir, a dozen of them—and take
            the page in your memory, and he'll start out and go straight to that cabin and open
            every one of them books at the right page, and call it off, and never make a mistake." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e800">"He must be the devil!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e802">"More than one has thought it. Now I'll tell you a perfectly wonderful thing that he
            done. The other night he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e804">There was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside, the door flew open, and an excited
            crowd burst in, with the camp's one white woman in the lead and crying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e806">"My child! my child! she's lost and gone! For the love of God help me to find Archy
            Stillman; we've hunted everywhere!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e809">Said the barkeeper: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e811">"Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, and don't worry. He asked for a bed three hours ago,
            tuckered out tramping the trails the way he's always doing, and went up-stairs. Ham
            Sandwich, run up and roust him out; he's in No. 14." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e813">The youth was soon down-stairs and ready. He asked Mrs. Hogan for particulars. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e815">"Bless you, dear, there ain't any; I wish there was. I put her to sleep at seven in the
            evening, and when I went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself, she was gone. I
            rushed for your cabin, dear, and you wasn't there, and I've hunted for you ever since,
            at every cabin down the gulch, and now I've come up again, and I'm that distracted and
            scared and heartbroke; but, thanks to God, I've found you at last, dear heart, and
            you'll find my child. Come on! come quick!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e817">"Move right along; I'm with you, madam. Go to your cabin first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e819">The whole company streamed out to join the hunt. All the southern half of the village
            was up, a hundred men strong, and waiting outside, a vague dark mass sprinkled with
            twinkling lanterns. The mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself
            to the narrow road, and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders. In a
            few minutes the Hogan cabin was reached. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e821">"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Hogan; "there's where she was; it's where I laid her at
            seven o'clock; but where she is now, God only knows." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e823">"Hand me a lantern," said Archy. He set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it,
            pretending to examine the ground closely. "Here's her track," he said, touching the
            ground here and there and yonder with his finger. "Do you see?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e825">Several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see. One or two
            thought they discerned something like a track; the others shook their heads and
            confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp
            enough to discover. One said, "Maybe a child's foot could make a mark on it, but <i>I</i> don't see how." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e830">Young Stillman stepped outside, held the light to the ground, turned leftward, and
            moved three steps, closely examining; then said, "I've got the direction—come
            along; take the lantern, somebody." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e832">He strode off swiftly southward, the files following, swaying and bending in and out
            with the deep curves of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the mouth of the gorge was reached;
            before them stretched the sagebrush plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman called a halt,
            saying, "We mustn't start wrong, now; we must take the direction again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e835">He took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards; then said,
            "Come on; it's all right," and gave up the lantern. In and out among the sage-bushes he
            marched, a quarter of a mile, bearing gradually to the right; then took a new direction
            and made another great semicircle; then changed again and moved due west nearly half a
            mile—and stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e837">"She gave it up, here, poor little chap. Hold the lantern. You can see where she sat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e839">But this was in a slick alkali flat which was surfaced like steel, and no person in the
            party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a
            cushion on a veneer like that. The bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the
            spot, lamenting. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e841">"But where is she, then?" some one said. "She didn't stay here. We can see <i>that</i> much, anyway." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e846">Stillman moved about in a circle around the place, with the lantern, pretending to hunt
            for tracks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e848">"Well!" he said presently, in an annoyed tone, "I don't understand it." He examined
            again. "No use. She was here—that's certain; she never <i>walked</i> away from here—and that's certain. It's a puzzle; I can't make it
            out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e853">The mother lost heart then. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e855">"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! some flying beast has got her. I'll never see her
            again!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e857">"Ah, <i>don't</i> give up," said Archy. "We'll find her—don't
            give up." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e862">"God bless you for the words, Archy Stillman!" and she seized his hand and kissed it
            fervently. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e864">Peterson, the new-comer, whispered satirically in Ferguson's ear: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e867">"Wonderful performance to find this place, wasn't it? Hardly worth while to come so
            far, though; any other supposititious place would have answered just as well—hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e869">Ferguson was not pleased with the innuendo. He said, with some warmth: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e871">"Do you mean to insinuate that the child hasn't been here? I tell you the child <i>has</i> been here! Now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a
            little fuss as—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e876">"All right!" sang out Stillman. "Come, everybody, and look at this! It was right under
            our noses all the time, and we didn't see it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e878">There was a general plunge for the ground at the place where the child was alleged to
            have rested, and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to see the thing that Archy's finger
            was resting upon. There was a pause, then a several-barreled sigh of disappointment. Pat
            Riley and Ham Sandwich said, in the one breath: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e880">"What is it, Archy? There's nothing here." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e882">"Nothing? Do you call <i>that</i> nothing?" and he swiftly traced upon
            the ground a form with his finger. "There—don't you recognize it now? It's Injun
            Billy's track. He's got the child." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e887">"God be praised !" from the mother. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e889">"Take away the lantern. I've got the direction. Follow!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e891">He started on a run, racing in and out among the sage-bushes a matter of three hundred
            yards, and disappeared over a sand-wave; the others struggled after him, caught him up,
            and found him waiting. Ten steps away was a little wickiup, a dim and formless shelter
            of rags and old horse-blankets, a dull light showing through its chinks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e893">"You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the lad. "It's your privilege to be first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e896">All followed the sprint she made for the wickiup, and saw, with her, the picture its
            interior afforded. Injun Billy was sitting on the ground; the child was asleep beside
            him. The mother hugged it with a wild embrace, which included Archy Stillman, the
            grateful tears running down her face, and in a choked and broken voice she poured out a
            golden stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments which has its home in full
            richness nowhere but in the Irish heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e898">"I find her bymeby it is ten o'clock," Billy explained. "She 'sleep out yonder, ve'y
            tired—face wet, been cryin', 'spose; fetch her home, feed her, she heap much
            hungry—go 'sleep 'gin." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e900">In her limitless gratitude the happy mother waived rank and hugged him too, calling him
            "the angel of God in disguise." And he probably was in disguise if he was that kind of
            an official. He was dressed for the character. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e902">At half past one in the morning the procession burst into the village singing, "When
            Johnny Comes Marching Home," waving its lanterns and swallowing the drinks that were
            brought out all along its course. It concentrated at the tavern, and made a night of
            what was left of the morning.</p>Chapter VI<p id="TwaDoubd1e907">The next afternoon the village was electrified with an immense sensation. A grave and
            dignified foreigner of distinguished bearing and appearance had arrived at the tavern,
            and entered this formidable name upon the register: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e909">SHERLOCK HOLMES
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e913">The news buzzed from cabin to cabin, from claim to claim; tools were dropped, and the
            town swarmed toward the center of interest. A man passing out at the northern end of the
            village shouted it to Pat Riley, whose claim was the next one to Flint Buckner's. At
            that time Fetlock Jones seemed to turn sick. He muttered to himself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e915">"Uncle <i>Sherlock!</i> The mean luck of it!—that <i>he </i>should come just when..." He dropped into a reverie, and
            presently said to himself: "But what's the use of being afraid of <i>him?
            </i>Anybody that knows him the way I do knows he can't detect a crime except where he
            plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and hires some fellow to commit it
            according to instructions.... Now there ain't going to <i>be</i> any
            clues this time—so, what show has he got? None at all. No, sir; everything's
            ready. If I was to risk putting it off—...No, I won't run any risk like that.
            Flint Buckner goes out of this world to-night, for sure." Then another trouble presented
            itself. "Uncle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening, and
            how am I going to get rid of him? for I've <i>got</i> to be at my cabin
            a minute or two about eight o'clock." This was an awkward matter, and cost him much
            thought. But he found a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll go for a walk, and I'll leave
            him in the road a minute, so that he won't see what it is I do: the best way to throw a
            detective off the track, anyway, is to have him along when you are preparing the thing.
            Yes, that's the safest—I'll take him with me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e932">Meantime the road in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping
            for a glimpse of the great man. But he kept his room, and did not appear. None but
            Ferguson, Jake Parker the blacksmith, and Ham Sandwich had any luck. These enthusiastic
            admirers of the great scientific detective hired the tavern's detained-baggage lockup,
            which looked into the detective's room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide,
            ambushed themselves in it, and cut some peep-holes in the window-blind. Mr. Holmes's
            blinds were down; but by and by he raised them. It gave the spies a hair-lifting but
            pleasurable thrill to find themselves face to face with the Extraordinary Man who had
            filled the world with the fame of his more than human ingenuities. There he
            sat—not a myth, not a shadow, but real, alive, compact of substance, and almost
            within touching distance with the hand. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e934">"Look at that head!" said Ferguson, in an awed voice. "By gracious! <i>that's</i> a head!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e939">"You bet!" said the blacksmith, with deep reverence. "Look at his nose! look at his
            eyes! Intellect? Just a battery of it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e941">"And that paleness," said Ham Sandwich. "Comes from thought—that's what it comes
            from. Hell! duffers like us don't know what real thought <i>is."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e946">"No more we don't," said Ferguson. "What we take for thinking is just
            blubber-and-slush," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e948">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo. And look at that frown—that's <i>deep</i> thinking—away down, down, forty fathom into the bowels of things.
            He's on the track of something." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e954">"Well, he is, and don't you forget it. Say—look at that awful gravity—look
            at that pallid solemness—there ain't any corpse can lay over it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e956">"No, sir, not for dollars! And it's his'n by hereditary rights, too; he's been dead
            four times a'ready, and there's history for it. Three times natural, once by accident.
            I've heard say he smells damp and cold, like a grave. And he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e958">" 'Sh! Watch him! There—he's got his thumb on the bump on the near corner of his
            forehead, and his forefinger on the off one. His think-works is just a-<i>grinding</i> now, you bet your other shirt." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e963">"That's so. And now he's gazing up toward heaven and stroking his mustache slow,
            and—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e965">"Now he has rose up standing, and is putting his clues together on his left fingers
            with his right finger. See? he touches the forefinger—now middle finger—now
            ring-finger—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e967">"Stuck!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e969">"Look at him scowl! He can't seem to make out <i>that</i> clue. So
            he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e974">"See him smile!—like a tiger—and tally off the other fingers like nothing!
            He's got it, boys; he's got it sure!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e976">"Well, I should <i>say!</i> I'd hate to be in that man's place that
            he's after." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e981">Mr. Holmes drew a table to the window, sat down with his back to the spies, and
            proceeded to write. The spies withdrew their eyes from the peep-holes, lit their pipes,
            and settled themselves for a comfortable smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with conviction: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e983">"Boys, it's no use talking, he's a wonder! He's got the signs of it all over him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e986">"You hain't ever said a truer word than that, Wells-Fargo," said Jake Parker. "Say,
            wouldn't it 'a' been nuts if he'd a-been here last night?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e988">"Oh, by George, but wouldn't it!" said Ferguson. "Then we'd have seen <i>scientific</i> work. Intellect—just pure intellect—away up on the upper

            an owl's, as near as I can make it out just a grand natural animal talent, no more, no
            less, and prime as far as it goes, but no intellect in it, and for awfulness and
            marvelousness no more to be compared to what this man does than—than—Why,
            let me tell you what <i>he'd</i> have done. He'd have stepped over to
            Hogan's and glanced—just <i>glanced,</i> that's all—at the
            premises, and that's enough. See everything? Yes, sir, to the last little detail; and
            he'll know more about that place than the Hogans would know in seven years. Next, he
            would sit down on the bunk, just as ca'm, and say to Mrs. Hogan—<i>Say,</i> Ham, consider that you are Mrs. Hogan. I'll ask the questions; you answer
            them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1005">"All right; go on." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1007">" 'Madam, if you please—attention—do not let your mind wander. Now,

            dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, many thanks. Ah, admirable, admirable! <i>Now</i> we know where we are, I think.' You see, boys, he's got all the
            clues he wants now; he don't need anything more. Now, then, what does this Extraordinary
            Man do? He lays those snips and that dirt out on the table and leans over them on his
            elbows, and puts them together side by side and studies them—mumbles to himself,
            'Female'; changes them around—mumbles, 'Six years old'; changes them this way and
            that—again mumbles: 'Five teeth—one
            a-coming—Catholic—yarn—cotton—kip—damn that kip.' Then he
            straightens up and gazes toward heaven, and plows his hands through his hair—plows
            and plows, muttering, 'Damn that kip!' Then he stands up and frowns, and begins to tally
            off his clues on his fingers—and gets stuck at the ring-finger. But only just a
            minute—then his face glares all up in a smile like a house afire, and he
            straightens up stately and majestic, and says to the crowd, 'Take a lantern, a couple of
            you, and go down to Injun Billy's and fetch the child—the rest of you go 'long
            home to bed; good-night, madam; good-night, gents.' And he bows like the Matterhorn, and
            pulls out for the tavern. That's <i>his</i> style, and the <i>Only—</i>scientific, intellectual—all over in fifteen
            minutes—no poking around all over the sage-brush range an hour and a half in a

          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1055">"By Jackson, it's grand!" said Ham Sandwich. "Wells-Fargo, you've got him down to a
            dot. He ain't painted up any exacter to the life in the books. By George, I can juse <i>see</i> him—can't you, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1060">"You bet you! It's just a photograft, that's what it is." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1062">Ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success, and grateful. He sat silently
            enjoying his happiness a little while, then he murmured, with a deep awe in his voice, </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1064">"I wonder if God made him?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1066">There was no response for a moment; then Ham Sandwich said, reverently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1068">"Not all at one time, I reckon."</p>Chapter VII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1073">At eight o'clock that evening two persons were groping their way past Flint Buckner's
            cabin in the frosty gloom. They were Sherlock Holmes and his nephew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1075">"Stop here in the road a moment, uncle," said Fetlock, "while I run to my cabin; I
            won't be gone a minute." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1077">He asked for something—the uncle furnished it—then he disappeared in the
            darkness, but soon returned, and the talking-walk was resumed. By nine o'clock they had
            wandered back to the tavern. They worked their way through the billiard-room, where a
            crowd had gathered in the hope of getting a glimpse of the Extraordinary Man. A royal
            cheer was raised. Mr. Holmes acknowledged the compliment with a series of courtly bows,
            and as he was passing out his nephew said to the assemblage: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1079">"Uncle Sherlock's got some work to do, gentlemen, that 'll keep him till twelve or one;
            but he'll be down again then, or earlier if he can, and hopes some of you'll be left to
            take a drink with him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1081">"By George, he's just a duke, boys! Three cheers for Sherlock Holmes, the greatest man
            that ever lived!" shouted Ferguson. "Hip, hip, hip—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1083">"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Tiger!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1085">The uproar shook the building, so hearty was the feeling the boys put into their
            welcome. Up-stairs the uncle reproached the nephew gently, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1087">"What did you get me into that engagement for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1089">"I reckon you don't want to be unpopular, do you, uncle? Well, then, don't you put on
            any exclusiveness in a mining-camp, that's all. The boys admire you; but if you was to
            leave without taking a drink with them, they'd set you down for a snob. And besides, you
            said you had home talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1091">The boy was right, and wise—the uncle acknowledged it. The boy was wise in
            another detail which he did not mention—except to himself: "Uncle and the others
            will come handy—in the way of nailing an <i>alibi </i>where it
            can't be budged." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1097">He and his uncle talked diligently about three hours. Then, about midnight, Fetlock
            stepped down-stairs and took a position in the dark a dozen steps from the tavern, and
            waited. Five minutes later Flint Buckner came rocking out of the billiard-room and
            almost brushed him as he passed. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1099">"I've <i>got</i> him!" muttered the boy. He continued to himself,
            looking after the shadowy form: "Good-by—good-by for good, Flint Buckner; you
            called my mother a—well, never mind what: it's all right, now; you're taking your
            last walk, friend." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1104">He went musing back into the tavern. "From now till one is an hour. We'll spend it with
            the boys; it's good for the <i>alibi."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1109">He brought Sherlock Holmes to the billiard-room, which was jammed with eager and
            admiring miners; the guest called the drinks, and the fun began. Everybody was happy;
            everybody was complimentary; the ice was soon broken, songs, anecdotes, and more drinks
            followed, and the pregnant minutes flew. At six minutes to one, when the jollity was at
            its highest— </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1111"><i>Boom!</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1115">There was silence instantly. The deep sound came rolling and rumbling frown peak to
            peak up the gorge, then died down, and ceased. The spell broke, then, and the men made a
            rush for the door, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1117">"Something's blown up!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1119">Outside, a voice in the darkness said, "It's away down the gorge; I saw the flash." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1121">The crowd poured down the cañon—Holmes, Fetlock, Archy Stillman,
            everybody. They made the mile in a few minutes. By the light of a lantern they found the
            smooth and solid dirt floor of Flint Buckner's cabin; of the cabin itself not a vestige
            remained, not a rag nor a splinter. Nor any sign of Flint. Search-parties sought here
            and there and yonder, and presently a cry went up. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1123">"Here he is!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1125">It was true. Fifty yards down the gulch they had found him—that is, they had
            found a crushed and lifeless mass which represented him. Fetlock Jones hurried thither
            with the others and looked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1128">The inquest was a fifteen-minute affair. Ham Sandwich, foreman of the jury, handed up
            the verdict, which was phrased with a certain unstudied literary grace, and closed with
            this finding, to wit: that "deceased came to his death by his own act or some other
            person or persons unknown to this jury not leaving any family or similar effects behind
            but his cabin which was blown away and God have mercy on his soul amen." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1130">Then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd, for the storm-center of interest was
            there—Sherlock Holmes. The miners stood silent and reverent in a half-circle,
            inclosing a large vacant space which included the front exposure of the site of the late
            premises. In this considerable space the Extraordinary Man was moving about, attended by
            his nephew with a lantern. With a tape he took measurements of the cabin site; of the
            distance from the wall of chaparral to the road; of the height of the chaparral bushes;
            also various other measurements. He gathered a rag here, a splinter there, and a pinch
            of earth yonder, inspected them profoundly, and preserved them. He took the "lay" of the
            place with a pocket-compass, allowing two seconds for magnetic variation. He took the
            time (Pacific) by his watch, correcting it for local time. He paced off the distance
            from the cabin site to the corpse, and corrected that for tidal differentiation. He took
            the altitude with a pocket-aneroid, and the temperature with a pocket-thermometer.
            Finally he said, with a stately bow: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1132">"It is finished. Shall we return, gentlemen?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1134">He took up the line of march for the tavern, and the crowd fell into his wake,
            earnestly discussing and admiring the Extraordinary Man, and interlarding guesses as to
            the origin of the tragedy and who the author of it might he. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1136">"My, but it's grand luck having him here—hey, boys?" said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1138">"It's the biggest thing of the century," said Ham Sandwich. "It 'll go all over the
            world; you mark my words." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1140"><i>"You</i> bet!" said Jake Parker, the blacksmith. "It 'll boom this
            camp. Ain't it so, Wells-Fargo?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1144">"Well, as you want my opinion—if it's any sign of how <i>I
            </i>think about it, I can tell you this: yesterday I was holding the Straight Flush
            claim at two dollars a foot; I'd like to see the man that can get it at sixteen to-day." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1149">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo! It's the grandest luck a new camp ever struck. Say, did
            you see him collar them little rags and dirt and things? What an eye! He just can't
            overlook a clue—'tain't <i>in </i>him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1154">"That's so. And they wouldn't mean a thing to anybody else; but to him, why, they're
            just a book—large print at that." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1156">"Sure's you're born! Them odds and ends have got their little old secret, and they
            think there ain't anybody can pull it; but, land! when he sets his grip there they've
            got to squeal, and don't you forget it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1159">"Boys, I ain't sorry, now, that he wasn't here to roust out the child; this is a bigger
            thing, by a long sight. Yes, sir, and more tangled up and scientific and intellectual." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1161">"I reckon we're all of us glad it's turned out this way. Glad? 'George! it ain't any
            name for it. Dontchuknow, Archy could 've <i>learnt</i> something if
            he'd had the nous to stand by and take notice of how that man works the system. But no;
            he went poking up into the chaparral and just missed the whole thing." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1166">"It's true as gospel; I seen it myself. Well, Archy's young. He'll know better one of
            these days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1168">"Say, boys, who do you reckon done it?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1170">That was a difficult question, and brought out a world of unsatisfying conjecture.
            Various men were mentioned as possibilities, but one by one they were discarded as not
            being eligible. No one but young Hillyer had been intimate with Flint Buckner; no one
            had really had a quarrel with him; he had affronted every man who had tried to make up
            to him, although not quite offensively enough to require bloodshed. There was one name
            that was upon every tongue from the start, but it <i>was</i> the last to
            get utterance—Fetlock Jones's. It was Pat Riley that mentioned it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1175">"Oh, well," the boys said, "of course we've all thought of him, because he had a
            million rights to kill Flint Buckner, and it was just his plain duty to do it. But all
            the same there's two things we can't get around: for one thing, he hasn't got the sand;
            and for another, he wasn't anywhere near the place when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1177">"I know it," said Pat. "He was there in the billiard-room with us when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1179">"Yes, and was there all the time for an hour <i>before</i> it
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1184">"It's so. And lucky for him, too. He'd have been suspected in a minute if it hadn't
            been for that."</p>Chapter VIII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1189">The tavern dining-room had been cleared of all its furniture save one six-foot pine
            table and a chair. This table was against one end of the room; the chair was on it;
            Sherlock Holmes, stately, imposing, impressive, sat in the chair. The public stood. The
            room was full. The tobacco-smoke was dense, the stillness profound. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1191">The Extraordinary Man raised his hand to command additional silence; held it in the air
            a few moments; then, in brief, crisp terms he put forward question after question, and
            noted the answers with "Um-ums," nods of the head, and so on. By this process he learned
            all about Flint Buckner, his character, conduct, and habits, that the people were able
            to tell him. It thus transpired that the Extraordinary Man's nephew was the only person
            in the camp who had a killing-grudge against Flint Buckner. Mr. Holmes smiled
            compassionately upon the witness, and asked, languidly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1193">"Do any of you gentlemen chance to know where the lad Fetlock Jones was at the time of
            the explosion?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1195">A thunderous response followed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1197">"In the billiard-room of this house!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1199">"Ah. And had he just come in?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1201">"Been there all of an hour!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1203">"Ah. It is about—about—well, about how far might it be to the scene of the
            explosions" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1205">"All of a mile!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1207">"Ah. It isn't <i>much</i> of an alibi, 'tis true, but—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1213">A storm-burst of laughter, mingled with shouts of "By jiminy, but he's
            chain-lightning!" and "Ain't you sorry you spoke, Sandy?" shut off the rest of the
            sentence, and the crushed witness drooped his blushing face in pathetic shame. The
            inquisitor resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1215">"The lad Jones's somewhat <i>distant</i> connection with the case"
              (laughter<i>) "</i>having been disposed of, let us now call the
            eye-witnesses of the tragedy, and listen to what they have to say." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1223">He got out his fragmentary clues and arranged them on a sheet of cardboard on his knee.
            The house held its breath and watched. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1225">"We have the longitude and the latitude, corrected for magnetic variation, and this
            gives us the exact location of the tragedy. We have the altitude, the temperature, and
            the degree of humidity prevailing—inestimably valuable, since they enable us to
            estimate with precision the degree of influence which they would exercise upon the mood
            and disposition of the assassin at that time of the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1227"><i>(Buzz of admiration; muttered remark, "By George, but he's
              deep.")</i> He fingered his clues. "And now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak
            to us. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1231">"Here we have an empty linen shot-bag. What is its message? This: that robbery was the
            motive, not revenge. What is its further message? This: that the assassin was of
            inferior intelligence—shall we say light-witted, or perhaps approaching that? How
            do we know this? Because a person of sound intelligence would not have proposed to rob
            the man Buckner, who never had much money with him. But the assassin might have been a
            stranger? Let the bag speak again. I take from it this article. It is a bit of
            silver-bearing quartz. It is peculiar. Examine it, please—you—and
            you—and you. Now pass it back, please. There is but one lode on this coast which
            produces just that character and color of quartz; and that is a lode which crops out for
            nearly two miles on a stretch, and in my opinion is destined, at no distant day, to
            confer upon its locality a globe-girdling celebrity, and upon its two hundred owners
            riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Name that lode, please." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1233">"The Consolidated Christian Science and Mary Ann!" was the prompt response. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1235">A wild crash of hurrahs followed, and every man reached for his neighbor's hand and
            wrung it, with tears in his eyes; and Wells-Fargo Ferguson shouted, "The Straight Flush
            is on the lode, and up she goes to a hunched and fifty a foot—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1240">When quiet fell, Mr. Holmes resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1242">"We perceive, then, that three facts are established, to wit: the assassin was
            approximately light-witted; he was not a stranger; his motive was robbery, not revenge.
            Let us proceed. I hold in my hand a small fragment of fuse, with the recent smell of
            fire upon it. What is its testimony? Taken with the corroborative evidence of the
            quartz, it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner. What does it tell us further?
            This, gentlemen: that the assassination was consummated by means of an explosive. What
            else does it say? This: that the explosive was located against the side of the cabin
            nearest the road—the front side—for within six feet of that spot I found it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1244">"I hold in my fingers a burnt Swedish match—the kind one rubs on a safety-box. I
            found it in the road, six hundred and twenty-two feet from the abolished cabin. What
            does it say? This: that the train was fired from that point. What further does it tell
            us? This: that the assassin was left-handed. How do I know this? I should not be able to
            explain to you, gentlemen, how I know it, the signs being so subtle that only long
            experience and deep study can enable one to detect them. But the signs are here, and
            they are reinforced by a fact which you must have often noticed in the great detective
            narratives—that <i>all </i>assassins are left-handed." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1250">"By Jackson, <i>that's</i> so." said Ham Sandwich, bringing his great
            hand down with a resounding slap upon his thigh; "blamed if I ever thought of it
            before." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1255">"Nor I!" "Nor I!" cried several. "Oh, there can't anything escape <i>him—</i>look at his eye!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1260">"Gentlemen, distant as the murderer was from his doomed victim, he did not wholly
            escape injury. This fragment of wood which I now exhibit to you struck him. It drew
            blood. Wherever he is, he bears the telltale mark. I picked it up where he stood when he
            fired the fatal train," He looked out over the house from his high perch, and his
            countenance began to darken; he slowly raised his hand, and pointed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1262">"There stands the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1264">For a moment the house was paralyzed with amazement; then twenty voices burst out with: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1266">"Sammy Hillyer? Oh, <i>hell,</i> no! <i>Him?</i> It's
            pure foolishness!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1274">"Take care, gentlemen—be not hasty. Observe—he has the blood-mark on his
            brow." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1276">Hillyer turned white with fright. He was near to crying. He turned this way and that,
            appealing to every face for help and sympathy; and held out his supplicating hands
            toward Holmes and began to plead: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1278"><i>"Don't,</i> oh, don't! I never did it; I give my word I never did
            it. The way I got this hurt on my forehead was—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1282">"Arrest him, constable!" cried Holmes. "I will swear out the warrant" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1284">The constable moved reluctantly forward—hesitated—stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1287">Hillyer broke out with another appeal. "Oh, Archy, don't let them do it; it would kill
            mother! <i>You</i> know how I got the hurt. Tell them, and save me,
            Archy; save me!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1292">Stillman worked his way to the front, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1294">"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be afraid." Then he said to the house, "Never mind how he
            got the hurt; it hasn't anything to do with this case, and isn't of any consequence." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1296">"God bless you, Archy, for a true friend!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1298">"Hurrah for Archy! Go in, boy, and play 'em a knock-down flush to their two pair 'n' a
            jack!" shouted the house, pride in their home talent and a patriotic sentiment of
            loyalty to it rising suddenly in the public heart and changing the whole attitude of the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1300">Young Stillman waited for the noise to cease; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1302">"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand by that door yonder, and Constable Harris to stand by
            the other one here, and not let anybody leave the room. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1304">"Said and done. Go on, old man!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1306">"The criminal is present, I believe. I will show him to you before long, in case I am
            right in my guess. Now I will tell you all about the tragedy, from start to finish. The
            motive <i>wasn't </i>robbery; it was revenge. The murderer <i>wasn't</i> light-witted. He <i>didn't</i> stand six
            hundred and twenty-two feet away. He <i>didn't </i>get hit with a piece
            of wood. He <i>didn't</i> place the explosive against the cabin. He <i>didn't</i> bring a shot-bag with him, and he <i>wasn't</i> left-handed. With the exception of these errors, the distinguished
            guest's statement of the case is substantially correct." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1330">A comfortable laugh rippled over the house; friend nodded to friend, as much as to say,
            "That's the word, with the bark <i>on</i> it. Good lad, good boy. <i>He</i> ain't lowering his flag any!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1338">The guest's serenity was not disturbed. Stillman resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1341">"I also have some witnesses; and I will presently tell you where you can find some
            more." He held up a piece of coarse wire; the crowd craned their necks to see. "It has a
            smooth coating of melted tallow on it. And here is a candle which is burned half-way
            down. The remaining half of it has marks cut upon it an inch apart. Soon I will tell you
            where I found these things. I will now put aside reasonings, guesses, the impressive
            hitchings of odds and ends of clues together, and the other showy theatricals of the
            detective trade, and tell you in a plain, straightforward way just how this dismal thing
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1343">He paused a moment, for effect—to allow silence and suspense to intensify and
            concentrate the house's interest; then he went on: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1345">"The assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains. It was a good plan, very
            ingenious, and showed an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. It was a plan which was
            well calculated to ward off all suspicion from its inventor. In the <i>first</i> place, he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart, and lit it and timed
            it. He found it took three hours to burn four inches of it. I tried it myself for half
            an hour, awhile ago, up-stairs here, while the inquiry into Flint Buckner's character
            and ways was being conducted in this room, and I arrived in that way at the rate of a
            candle's consumption when sheltered from the wind. Having proved his trial candle's
            rate, he blew it out—I have already shown it to you—and put <i>his</i> inch-marks on a fresh one. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1353">"He put the fresh one into a tin candlestick. Then at the five-hour mark he bored a
            hole through the candle with a red-hot wire. I have already shown you the wire, with a
            smooth coat of tallow on it—tallow that had been melted and had cooled. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1355">"With labor—very hard labor, I should say—he struggled up through the stiff
            chaparral that clothes the steep hillside back of Flint Buckner's place, tugging an
            empty flour-barrel with him. He placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place, and in
            the bottom of it he set the candlestick. Then he measured off about thirty-five feet of
            fuse—the barrel's distance from the back of the cabin. He bored a hole in the side
            of the barrel—here is the large gimlet he did it with. He went on and finished his
            work; and when it was done, one end of the fuse was in Buckner's cabin, and the other
            end, with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder, was in the hole in the
            candle—timed to blow the place up at one o'clock this morning, provided the candle
            was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening—which I am betting it was—and
            provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the
            fuse—which I am also betting there was, though I can't prove it. Boys, the barrel
            is there in the chaparral, the candle's remains are in it in the tin stick; the
            burnt-out fuse is in the gimlet-hole, the other end is down the hill where the late
            cabin stood. I saw them all an hour or two ago, when the Professor here was measuring
            off unimplicated vacancies and collecting relics that hadn't anything to do with the
            case." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1357">He paused. The house drew a long, deep breath, shook its strained cords and muscles
            free and burst into cheers. "Dang him!" said Ham Sandwich, "that's why he was snooping
            around in the chaparral, instead of picking up points out of the P'fessor's game. Looky
            here—he ain't no fool, boys." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1359">"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1361">But Stillman was resuming: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1363">"While we were out yonder an hour or two ago, the owner of the gimlet and the trial
            candle took them from a place where he had concealed them—it was not a good
            place—and carried them to what he probably thought was a better one, two hundred
            yards up in the pine woods, and hid them there, covering them over with pine needles. It
            was there that I found them. The gimlet exactly fits the hole in the barrel. And
            now—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1365">The Extraordinary Man interrupted him. He said, sarcastically: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1367">"We have had a very pretty fairy tale, gentlemen—very pretty indeed. Now I would
            like to ask this young man a question or two." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1370">Some of the boys winced, and Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1372">"I'm afraid Archy's going to catch it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1374">The others lost their smiles and sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1376">"Let us proceed to examine into this fairy tale in a consecutive and orderly
            way—by geometrical progression, so to speak—linking detail to detail in a
            steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent and unassailable march upon this tinsel
            toy fortress of error, the dream fabric of a callow imagination. To begin with, young
            sir, I desire to ask you but three questions at present—<i>at
              present.</i> Did I understand you to say it was your opinion that the supposititious
            candle was lighted at about eight o'clock yesterday evening?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1381">"Yes, sir—about eight." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1383">"Could you say exactly eight?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1385">"Well, no, I couldn't be that exact." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1387">"Um. If a person had been passing along there just about that time, he would have been
            almost sure to encounter that assassin, do you think?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1389">"Yes, I should think so." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1391">"Thank you, that is all. For the present. I say, all <i>for the
              present."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1396">"Dern him. he's laying for Archy," said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1399">"It's so," said Ham Sandwich. "I don't like the look of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1401">Stillman said, glancing at the guest, "I was along there myself at half-past
            eight—no, about nine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1403">"In-deed? This is interesting—this is very interesting. Perhaps you encountered
            the assassin?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1405">"No, I encountered no one." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1407">"Ah. Then—if you will excuse the remark—I do not quite see the relevancy of
            the information." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1409">"It has none. At present. I say it has none—at present." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1411">He paused. Presently he resumed: "I did not encounter the assassin, but I am on his
            track, I am sure, for I believe he is in this room. I will ask you all to pass one by
            one in front of me—here, where there is a good light—so that I can see your
            feet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1413">A buzz of excitement swept the place, and the march began, the guest looking on with an
            iron attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified success. Stillman stooped, shaded
            his eyes with his hand, and gazed down intently at each pair of feet as it passed. Fifty
            men tramped monotonously by—with no result. Sixty. Seventy. The thing was
            beginning to look absurd. The guest remarked, with suave irony:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1415">"Stillman Accuses Sherlock Holmes"Image of Stillman pointing a finger at Sherlock Holmes</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1421">"Assassins appear to be scarce this evening." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1423">The house saw the humor if it, and refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. Ten or twelve
            more candidates tramped by—no, <i>danced </i>by, with airy and
            ridiculous capers which convulsed the spectators—then suddenly Stillman put out
            his hand and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1429">"This is the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1431">"Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhedrim!" roared the crowd; and at once let fly a
            pyrotechnic explosion and dazzle and confusion of stirring remarks inspired by the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1433">At the height of the turmoil the guest stretched out his hand, commanding peace. The
            authority of a great name and a great personality laid its mysterious compulsion upon
            the house, and it obeyed. Out of the panting calm which succeeded, the guest spoke,
            saying, with dignity and feeling: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1435"><i>"This</i> is serious. It strikes at an innocent life. Innocent
            beyond suspicion! Innocent beyond peradventure! Hear me <i>prove</i> it;
            observe how simple a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie. Listen. My
            friends, that lad was never out of my sight yesterday evening at <i>any</i> time!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1445">It made a deep impression. Men turned their eyes upon Stillman with grave inquiry in
            them. His face brightened, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1447">"I <i>knew</i> there was another one!" He stepped briskly to the table
            and glanced at the guest's feet, then up at his face, and said: "You were <i>with</i> him! You were not fifty steps from him when he lit the candle
            that by and by fired the powder!" <i>(Sensation.) "</i>And what is more,
            you furnished the matches yourself !" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1458">Plainly the guest seemed hit; it looked so to the public. He opened his mouth to speak;
            the words did not come freely. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1460">"This—er—this is insanity—this—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1462">Stillman pressed his evident advantage home. He held up a charred match. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1464">"Here <i>is</i> one of them. I found it in the barrel—and there's
              <i>another</i> one there." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1472">The guest found his voice at once. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1475"><i>"Yes—</i>and put them there yourself!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1479">It was recognized a good shot. Stillman retorted. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1481">"It is <i>wax—</i>a breed unknown to this camp. I am ready to be
            searched for the box. Are you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1486">The guest was staggered this time—the dullest eye could see it. He fumbled with
            his hands; once or twice his lips moved, but the words did not come. The house waited
            and watched, in tense suspense, the stillness adding effect to the situation. Presently
            Stillman said, gently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1488">"We are waiting for your decision." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1490">There was silence again during several moments; then the guest answered, in a low
            voice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1492">"I refuse to be searched." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1494">There was no noisy demonstration, but all about the house one voice after another
            muttered: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1496">"That settles it! He's Archy's meat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1498">What to do now? Nobody seemed to know. It was an embarrassing situation for the
            moment—merely, of course, because matters had taken such a sudden and unexpected
            turn that these unpractised minds were not prepared for it, and had come to a
            standstill, like a stopped clock, under the shock. But after a little the machinery
            began to work again, tentatively, and by twos and threes the men put their heads
            together and privately buzzed over this and that and the other proposition. One of these
            propositions met with much favor; it was, to confer upon the assassin a vote of thanks
            for removing Flint Buckner, and let him go. But the cooler heads opposed it, pointing
            out that addled brains in the Eastern states would pronounce it a scandal, and make no
            end of foolish noise about it. Finally the cool heads got the upper hand, and obtained
            general consent to a proposition of their own; their leader then called the house to
            order and stated it—to this effect: that Fetlock Jones be jailed and put upon
            trial. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1500">The motion was carried. Apparently there was nothing further to do now, and the people
            were glad, for, privately, they were impatient to get out and rush to the scene of the
            tragedy, and see whether that barrel and the other things were really there or not. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1503">But no—the break-up got a check. The surprises were not over yet. For a while
            Fetlock Jones had been silently sobbing, unnoticed in the absorbing excitements which
            had been following one another so persistently for some time; but when his arrest and
            trial were decreed, he broke out despairingly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1505">"No! it's no use. I don't want any jail, I don't want any trial; I've had all the hard
            luck I want, and all the miseries. Hang me now, and let me out! It would all come out,
            anyway—there couldn't anything save me. He has told it all, just as if he'd been
            with me and seen it—<i>I</i> don't know how he found out; and
            you'll find the barrel and things, and then I wouldn't have any chance any more. I
            killed him; and <i>you'd</i> have done it too, if he'd treated you like
            a dog, and you only a boy, and weak and poor, and not a friend to help you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1513">"And served him damned well right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. "Looky here, boys—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1515">From the constable: "Order! Order, gentlemen!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1517">A voice: "Did your uncle know what you was up to?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1519">"No, he didn't." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1521">"Did he give you the matches, sure enough?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1523">"Yes, he did; but he didn't know what I wanted them for." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1525">"When you was out on such a business as that, how did you venture to risk having him
            along—and him a <i>detective?</i> How's that?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1530">The boy hesitated, fumbled with his buttons in an embarrassed way, then said, shyly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1532">"I know about detectives, on account of having them in the family; and if you don't
            want them to find out about a thing, it's best to have them around when you do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1535">The cyclone of laughter which greeted this native discharge of wisdom did not modify
            the poor little waif's embarrassment in any large degree.</p>Chapter IX<p id="TwaDoubd1e1540">From a letter to Mrs. Stillman, dated merely "Tuesday." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1542">Fetlock Jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log cabin, and left there
              to await his trial. Constable Harris provided him with a couple of days' rations,
              instructed him to keep a good guard over himself, and promised to look in on him as
              soon as further supplies should be due. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1545">Next morning a score of us went with Hillyer, out of friendship, and helped him bury
              his late relative, the unlamented Buckner, and I acted as first assistant pall-bearer,
              Hillyer acting as chief. Just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy
              stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, limped by with his head down, and I caught the
              scent I had chased around the globe! It was the odor of Paradise to my perishing hope!
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1548">In a moment I was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder. He
              slumped to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had withered him in his tracks; and
              as the boys came running he struggled to his knees and put up his pleading hands to
              me, and out of his chattering jaws he begged me to persecute him no more, and said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1551">"You have hunted me around the world, Sherlock Holmes, yet God is my witness I have
              never done any man harm!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1554">A glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane. That was my work, mother!
              The tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery I felt in that moment, but
              nothing else can ever do it. The boys lifted him up, and gathered about him, and were
              full of pity of him, and said the gentlest and touchingest things to him, and said
              cheer up and don't be troubled, he was among friends now, and they would take care of
              him, and protect him, and hang any man that laid a hand on him. They are just like so
              many mothers, the rough mining-camp boys are, when you wake up the south side of their
              hearts; yes, and just like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up
              the opposite of that muscle. They did everything they could think of to comfort him,
              but nothing succeeded until Wells-Fargo Ferguson, who is a clever strategist, said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1557">"If it's only Sherlock Holmes that's troubling you, you needn't worry any more."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1560">"Why?" asked the forlorn lunatic, eagerly. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1563">"Because he's dead again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1566">"Dead! Dead! Oh, don't trifle with a poor wreck like me. <i>Is
              </i>he dead? On honor, now—is he telling me true, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1573">"True as you're standing there!" said Ham Sandwich, and they all backed up the
              statement in a body. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1576">"They hung him in San Bernardino last week," added Ferguson, clinching the matter,
              "whilst he was searching around after you. Mistook him for another man. They're sorry,
              but they can't help it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1579">"They're a-building him a monument," said Ham Sandwich, with the air of a person who
              had contributed to it, and knew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1582">"James Walker" drew a deep sigh—evidently a sigh of relief—and said
              nothing; but his eyes lost something of their wildness, his countenance cleared
              visibly, and its drawn look relaxed a little. We all went to our cabin, and the boys
              cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for, and while they
              were about it Hillyer and I outfitted him from hat to shoe-leather with new clothes of
              ours, and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him. "Old" is the right word,
              and a pity, too: old by the droop of him, and the frost upon his hair, and the marks
              which sorrow and distress have left upon his face; though he is only in his prime in
              the matter of years. While he ate, we smoked and chatted; and when he was finishing he
              found his voice at last, and of his own accord broke out with his personal history. I
              cannot furnish his exact words, but I will come as near it as I can. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1585">THE "WRONG MAN'S" STORY </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1588">It happened like this: I was in Denver. I had been there many years; sometimes I
              remember how many, sometimes I don't—but it isn't any matter. All of a sudden I
              got a notice to leave, or I would be exposed for a horrible crime committed long
              before—years and years before—in the East. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1591">I knew about that crime, but I was not the criminal; it was a cousin of mine of the
              same name. What should I better do? My head was all disordered by fear, and I didn't
              know. I was allowed very little time—only one day, I think it was. I would be
              ruined if I was published, and the people would lynch me, and not believe what I said.
              It is always the way with lynchings: when they find out it is a mistake they are
              sorry, but it is too late—the same as it was with Mr. Holmes, you see. So I said
              I would sell out and get money to live on, and run away until it blew over and I could
              come back with my proofs. Then I escaped in the night and went a long way off in the
              mountains somewhere, and lived disguised and had a false name. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1594">I got more and more troubled and worried, and my troubles made me see spirits and
              hear voices, and I could not think straight and clear on any subject, but got confused
              and involved and had to give it up, because my head hurt so. It got to be worse and
              worse; more spirits and more voices. They were about me all the time; at first only in
              the night, then in the day too. They were always whispering around my bed and plotting
              against me, and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out, because I got no good rest.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1597">And then came the worst. One night the whispers said, "We'll never manage, because
              we can't <i>see</i> him, and so can't point him out to the people."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1603">They sighed; then one said: "We must bring Sherlock Holmes. He can be here in twelve
              days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1606">They all agreed, and whispered and jibbered with joy. But my heart broke; for I had
              read about that man, and knew what it would be to have him upon my track, with his
              superhuman penetration and tireless energies. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1610">The spirits went away to fetch him, and I got up at once in the middle of the night
              and fled away, carrying nothing but the hand-bag that had my money in it—thirty
              thousand dollars; two-thirds of it are in the bag there yet. It was forty days before
              that man caught up on my track. I just escaped. From habit he had written his real
              name on a tavern register, but had scratched it out and written "Dagget Barclay" in
              the place of it. But fear gives you a watchful eye and keen, and I read the true name
              through the scratches, and fled like a deer. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1613">He has hunted me all over this world for three years and a half—the Pacific
              states, Australasia, India—everywhere you can think of; then back to Mexico and
              up to California again, giving me hardly any rest; but that name on the registers
              always saved me, and what is left of me is alive yet. And I am <i>so</i> tired! A cruel time he has given me, yet I give you my honor I have never
              harmed him nor any man. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1619">That was the end of the story, and it stirred those boys to bloodheat, he sure of
              it. As for me—each word burnt a hole in me where it struck. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1622">We voted that the old man should bunk with us, and be my guest and Hillyer's. I
              shall keep my own counsel, naturally; but as soon as he is well rested and nourished,
              I shall take him to Denver and rehabilitate his fortunes. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1625">The boys gave the old fellow the bone-smashing good-fellowship handshake of the
              mines, and then scattered away to spread the news. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1628">At dawn next morning Wells-Fargo Ferguson and Ham Sandwich called us softly out, and
              said, privately: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1631">"That news about the way that old stranger has been treated has spread all around,
              and the camps are up. They are piling in from everywhere, and are going to lynch the
              P'fessor. Constable Harris is in a dead funk, and has telephoned the sheriff. Come
              along!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1634">We started on a run. The others were privileged to feel as they chose, but in my
              heart's privacy I hoped the sheriff would arrive in time; for I had small desire that
              Sherlock Holmes should hang for my deeds, as you can easily believe. I had heard a
              good deal about the sheriff, but </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1637">for reassurance's sake I asked: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1640">"Can he stop a mob?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1643">"Can <i>he</i> stop a mob! Can Jack <i>Fairfax</i>
              stop a mob! Well, I should smile! Ex-desperado—nineteen scalps on his string.
              Can <i>he!</i> Oh, I <i>say!"</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1659">As we tore up the gulch, distant cries and shouts and yells rose faintly on the
              still air, and grew steadily in strength as we raced along. Roar after roar burst out,
              stronger and stronger, nearer and nearer; and at last, when we closed up upon the
              multitude massed in the open area in front of the tavern, the crash of sound was
              deafening. Some brutal roughs from Daly's gorge had Holmes in their grip, and he was
              the calmest man there; a contemptuous smile played about his lips, and if any fear of
              death was in his British heart, his iron personality was master of it and no sign of
              it was allowed to appear. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1662">"Come to a vote, men!" This from one of the Daly gang, Shadbelly Higgins. "Quick! is
              it hang, or shoot?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1665">"Neither!" shouted one of his comrades. "He'll he alive again in a week; burning's
              the only permanency for <i>him."</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1671">The gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a thundercrash of approval, and
              went struggling and surging toward the prisoner, and closed around him, shouting,
              "Fire! fire's the ticket!" They dragged him to the horse-post, backed him against it,
              chained him to it, and piled wood and pine cones around him waist-deep. Still the
              strong face did not blench, and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1674">"A match! fetch a match!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1677">Shadbelly struck it, shaded it with his hand, stooped, and held it under a pine
              cone. A deep silence fell upon the mob. The cone caught, a tiny flame flickered about
              it a moment or two. I seemed to catch the sound of distant hoofs—it grew more
              distinct—still more and more distinct, more and more definite, but the absorbed
              crowd did not appear to notice it. The match went out. The man struck another,
              stooped, and again the flame rose; this time it took hold and began to
              spread—here and there men turned away their faces. The executioner stood with
              the charred match in his fingers, watching his work. The hoof-beats turned a
              projecting crag, and now they came thundering down upon us. Almost the next moment
              there was a shout: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1680">"The sheriff!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1683">And straightway he came tearing into the midst, stood his horse almost on his hind
              feet, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1686">"Fall back, you gutter-snipes!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1689">He was obeyed. By all but their leader. He stood his ground, and his hand went to
              his revolver. The sheriff covered him promptly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1692">"Drop your hand, you parlor desperado. Kick the fire away. Now unchain the
              stranger." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1696">The parlor desperado obeyed. Then the sheriff made a speech; sitting his horse at
              martial ease, and not warming his words with any touch of fire, but delivering them in
              a measured and deliberate way, and in a tone which harmonized with their character and
              made them impressively disrespectful. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1699">"You're a nice lot—now ain't you? Just about eligible to travel with this bilk
              here—Shadbelly Higgins—this loud-mouthed sneak that shoots people in the
              back and calls himself a desperado. If there's anything I do particularly despise,
              it's a lynching mob; I've never seen one that had a man in it. It has to tally up a
              hundred against one before it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor. It's
              made up of cowards, and so is the community that breeds it; and ninety-nine times out
              of a hundred the sheriff's another one." He paused—apparently to turn that last
              idea over in his mind and taste the juice of it—then he went on: "The sheriff
              that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the lowest-down coward there is. By
              the statistics there was a hundred and eighty-two of them drawing sneak pay in America
              last year. By the way it's going, pretty soon there 'll be a new disease in the
                doctor-books—<i>sheriff complaint."</i> That idea pleased
              him—any one could see it. "People will say, 'Sheriff sick again?' 'Yes; got the
              same old thing.' And next there 'll be a new title. People won't say, 'He's running
              for sheriff of Rapaho County,' for instance; they'll say, 'He's running for Coward of
              Rapaho.' Lord, the idea of a grown-up person being afraid of a lynch mob!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1705">He turned an eye on the captive, and said, "Stranger, who are you, and what have you
              been doing?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1708">"My name is Sherlock Holmes, and I have not been doing anything." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1711">It was wonderful, the impression which the sound of that name made on the sheriff,
              notwithstanding he must have come posted. He spoke up with feeling, and said it was a
              blot on the county that a man whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their
              fame and their ingenuity, and whose histories of them had won every reader's heart by
              the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting, should be visited under the Stars
              and Stripes by an outrage like this. He apologized in the name of the whole nation,
              and made Holmes a most handsome bow, and told Constable Harris to see him to his
              quarters, and hold himself personally responsible if he was molested again. Then he
              turned to the mob and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1714">"Hunt your holes, you scum!" which they did; then he said: "Follow me, Shadbelly;
              I'll take care of your case myself. No—keep your popgun; whenever I see the day
              that I'll be afraid to have you behind me with that thing, it 'll be time for me to
              join last year's hundred and eighty-two"; and he rode off in a walk, Shadbelly
              following. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1717">When we were on our way back to our cabin, toward breakfast-time, we ran upon the
              news that Fetlock Jones had escaped from his lock-up in the night and is gone! Nobody
              is sorry. Let his uncle track him out if he likes; it is in his line; the camp is not
              interested.</p>Chapter X<p id="TwaDoubd1e1723"><i>Ten days later.</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1728">"James Walker" is all right in body now, and his mind shows improvement too. I start
              with him for Denver to-morrow morning. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1731"><i>Next night. Brief note, mailed at a way-station.</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1736">As we were starting, this morning, Hillyer whispered to me: "Keep this news from
              Walker until you think it safe and not likely to disturb his mind and check his
              improvement: the ancient crime he spoke of was really committed—and by his

              day—the unhappiest man that has lived in a century—Flint Buckner. His real
              name was Jacob Fuller!" There, mother, by help of me, an unwitting mourner, your
              husband and my father is in his grave.

There has been a
            wedding, between a handsome young man of slender means and a rich young girl—a
            case of love at first sight and a precipitate marriage; a marriage bitterly opposed by
            the girl's widowed father. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e140">Jacob Fuller, the bridegroom, is twenty-six years old, is of an old but unconsidered
            family which had by compulsion emigrated from Sedgemoor, and for King James's purse's
            profit, so everybody said—some maliciously the rest merely because they believed
            it. The bride is nineteen and beautiful. She is intense, high-strung, romantic,
            immeasurably proud of her Cavalier blood, and passionate in her love for her young
            husband. For its sake she braved her father's displeasure, endured his reproaches,
            listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions and went from his house
            without his blessing, proud and happy in the proofs she was thus giving of the quality
            of the affection which had made its home in her heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e142">The morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her. Her husband put aside
            her proffered caresses, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e144">"Sit down. I have something to say to you. I loved you. That was before I asked your
            father to give you to me. His refusal is not my grievance—I could have endured
            that. But the things he said of me to you—that is a different matter.
            There—you needn't speak; I know quite well what they were; I got them from
            authentic sources. Among other things he said that my character was written in my face;
            that I was treacherous, a dissembler, a coward, and a brute without sense of pity or
            compassion: the 'Sedgemoor trade-mark,' he called it—and 'white-sleeve badge.' Any
            other man in my place would have gone to his house and shot him down like a dog. I
            wanted to do it, and was minded to do it, but a better thought came to me: to put him to
            shame; to break his heart; to kill him by inches. How to do it? Through my treatment of
            you, his idol! I would marry you; and then—Have patience. You will see. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e146">From that moment onward, for three months, the young wife suffered all the
            humiliations, all the insults, all the miseries that the diligent and inventive mind of
            the husband could contrive, save physical injuries only. Her strong pride stood by her,
            and she kept the secret of her troubles. Now and then the husband said, "Why don't you
            go to your father and tell him?" Then he invented new tortures, applied them, and asked
            again. She always answered, "He shall never know by my mouth," and taunted him with his
            origin; said she was the lawful slave of a scion of slaves, and must obey, and
            would—up to that point, but no further; he could kill her if he liked, but he
            could not break her; it was not in the Sedgemoor breed to do it. At the end of the three
            months he said, with a dark significance in his manner, "I have tried all things but
            one"—and waited for her reply. "Try that," she said, and curled her lip in
            mockery. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e148">That night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes, then said to her: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e150">"Get up and dress!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e152">She obeyed—as always, without a word. He led her half a mile from the house, and
            proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public road; and succeeded, she
            screaming and struggling. He gagged her then, struck her across the face with his
            cowhide, and set his bloodhounds on her. They tore the clothes off her, and she was
            naked. He called the dogs off, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e154">"You will be found—by the passing public. They will be dropping along about three
            hours from now, and will spread the news—do you hear? Good-by. You have seen the
            last of me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e156">He went away then. She moaned to herself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e159">"I shall bear a child—to <i>him!</i> God grant it may be a boy!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e164">The farmers released her by and by—and spread the news, which was natural. They
            raised the country with lynching intentions, but the bird had flown. The young wife shut
            herself up in her father's house; he shut himself up with her, and thenceforth would see
            no one. His pride was broken, and his heart; so he wasted away, day by day, and even his
            daughter rejoiced when death relieved him. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e166">Then she sold the estate and disappeared.</p>Chapter 2<p id="TwaDoubd1e171">In 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded New England village,
            with no company but a little boy about five years old. She did her own work, she
            discouraged acquaintanceships, and had none. The butcher, the baker, and the others that
            served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was
            Stillman, and that she called the child Archy. Whence she came they had not been able to
            find out, but they said she talked like a Southerner. The child had no playmates and no
            comrade, and no teacher but the mother. She taught him diligently and intelligently, and
            was satisfied with the results—even a little proud of them. One day Archy said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e173">"Mamma, am I different from other children?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e175">"Well, I suppose not. Why?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e177">"There was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had been by and I
            said yes, and she said how long since I saw him and I said I hadn't seen him at all, and
            she said how did I know he'd been by, then, and I said because I smelt his track on the
            sidewalk, and she said I was a dum fool and made a mouth at me. What did she do that
            for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e179">The young woman turned white, and said to herself, "It's a birth mark! The gift of the
            bloodhound is in him." She snatched the boy to her breast and hugged him passionately,
            saying, "God has appointed the way!" Her eyes were burning with a fierce light, and her
            breath came short and quick with excitement. She said to herself: "The puzzle is solved
            now; many a time it has been a mystery to me, the impossible things the child has done
            in the dark, but it is all clear to me now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e181">She set him in his small chair, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e183">"Wait a little till I come, dear; then we will talk about the matter." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e185">She went up to her room and took from her dressing-table several small articles and put
            them out of sight: a nail-file on the floor under the bed; a pair of nail-scissors under
            the bureau; a small ivory paper-knife under the wardrobe. Then she returned, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e187">"There! I have left some things which I ought to have brought down." She named them,
            and said, "Run up and bring them, dear." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e189">The child hurried away on his errand and was soon back again with the things. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e192">"Did you have any difficulty, dear?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e194">"No, mamma; I only went where you went." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e196">During his absence she had stepped to the bookcase, taken several books from the bottom
            shelf, opened each, passed her hand over a page, noting its number in her memory, then
            restored them to their places. Now she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e198">"I have been doing something while you have been gone, Archy. Do you think you can find
            out what it was?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e200">The boy went to the bookcase and got out the books that had been touched, and opened
            them at the pages which had been stroked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e202">The mother took him in her lap, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e204">"I will answer your question now, dear. I have found out that in one way you are quite
            different from other people. You can see in the dark, you can smell what other people
            cannot, you have the talents of a bloodhound. They are good and valuable things to have,
            but you must keep the matter a secret. If people found it out, they would speak of you
            as an odd child, a strange child, and children would be disagreeable to you, and give
            you nicknames. In this world one must be like everybody else if he doesn't want to
            provoke scorn or envy or jealousy. It is a great and fine distinction which has been
            born to you, and I am glad; but you will keep it a secret, for mamma's sake, won't you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e206">The child promised, without understanding. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e208">All the rest of the day the mother's brain was busy with excited thinkings; with plans,
            projects, schemes, each and all of them uncanny, grim, and dark. Yet they lit up her
            face; lit it with a fell light of their own; lit it with vague fires of hell. She was in
            a fever of unrest; she could not sit, stand, read, sew; there was no relief for her but
            in movement. She tested her boy's gift in twenty ways, and kept saying to herself all
            the time, with her mind in the past: "He broke my father's heart, and night and day all
            these years I have tried, and all in vain, to think out a way to break his. I have found
            it now—I have found it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e210">When night fell, the demon of unrest still possessed her. She went on with her tests;
            with a candle she traversed the house from garret to cellar, hiding pins, needles,
            thimbles, spools, under pillows, under carpets, in cracks in the walls, under the coal
            in the bin; then sent the little fellow in the dark to find them; which he did, and was
            happy and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e212">From this time forward life took on a new complexion for her. She said, "The future is
            secure—I can wait, and enjoy the waiting." The most of her lost interests revived.
            She took up music again, and languages, drawing, painting, and the other long-discarded
            delights of her maidenhood. She was happy once more, and felt again the zest of life. As
            the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy, and was contented with it.
            Not altogether, but nearly that. The soft side of his heart was larger than the other
            side of it. It was his only defect, in her eyes. But she considered that his love for
            her and worship of her made up for it. He was a good hater—that was well; but it
            was a question if the materials of his hatreds were of as tough and enduring a quality
            as those of his friendships—and that was not so well. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e215">The years drifted on. Archy was become a handsome, shapely, athletic youth, courteous,
            dignified, companionable, pleasant in his ways, and looking perhaps a trifle older than
            he was, which was sixteen. One evening his mother said she had something of grave
            importance to say to him, adding that he was old enough to hear it now, and old enough
            and possessed of character enough and stability enough to carry out a stern plan which
            she had been for years contriving and maturing. Then she told him her bitter story, in
            all its naked atrociousness. For a while the boy was paralyzed; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e217">"I understand. We are Southerners; and by our custom and nature there is but one
            atonement. I will search him out and kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e219">"Kill him? No! Death is release, emancipation; death is a favor. Do I owe him favors?
            You must not hurt a hair of his head." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e221">The boy was lost in thought awhile; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e223">"You are all the world to me, and your desire is my law and my pleasure. Tell me what
            to do and I will do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e225">The mother's eyes beamed with satisfaction, and she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e227">"You will go and find him. I have known his hiding-place for eleven years; it cost me
            five years and more of inquiry, and much money, to locate it. He is a quartz-miner in
            Colorado, and well-to-do. He lives in Denver. His name is Jacob Fuller. There—it
            is the first time I have spoken it since that unforgettable night. Think! That name
            could have been yours if I had not saved you that shame and furnished you a cleaner one.
            You will drive him from that place; you will hunt him down and drive him again; and yet
            again, and again, and again, persistently, relentlessly, poisoning his life, filling it
            with mysterious terrors, loading it with weariness and misery, making him wish for
            death, and that he had a suicide's courage; you will make of him another Wandering Jew;
            he shall know no rest any more, no peace of mind, no placid sleep; you shall shadow him,
            cling to him, persecute him, till you break his heart, as he broke my father's and
            mine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e229">"I will obey, mother." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e231">"I believe it, my child. The preparations are all made; everything is ready. Here is a
            letter of credit; spend freely, there is no lack of money. At times you may need
            disguises. I have provided them; also some other conveniences." She took from the drawer
            of the typewriter-table several squares of paper. They all bore these typewritten
            words:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e233"><i>$10,000 REWARD</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e237"><i>It is believed that a certain man who is wanted in an Eastern
                state is sojourning here. In 1880, in the night, he tied his young wife to a tree by
                the public road, cut her across the face with a cowhide, and made his dogs tear her
                clothes from her, leaving her naked. He left her there, and fled the country. A

            night and placard one of these upon the building he occupies, and another one upon the
            post-office or in some other prominent place. It will be the talk of the region. At
            first you must give him several days in which to force a sale of his belongings at
            something approaching their value. We will ruin him by and by, but gradually; we must
            not impoverish him at once, for that could bring him to despair and injure his health,
            possibly kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e244">She took three or four more typewritten forms from the
            drawer—duplicates—and read one:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e246">. . . . . . . . . ., . . . . . . . . . ., 18. . . .</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e249"><i>To Jacob Fuller:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e253"><i>You have . . . . . . days in which to settle your affairs. You

                Fuller. I have his scent; I could track him through ten divisions of infantry and
                find him. I have often been near him and heard him talk. He owns a good mine, and
                has a fair income from it; but he is not rich. He learned mining in a good
                way—by working at it for wages. He is a cheerful creature, and his forty-three
                years sit lightly upon him; he could pass for a younger man—say thirty-six or
                thirty-seven. He has never married again—passes himself off for a widower. He
                stands well, is liked, is popular, and has many friends. Even I feel a drawing
                toward him—the paternal blood in me making its claim. How blind and
                unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature—the most of them, in
                fact! My task is become hard now—you realize it? you comprehend, and make
                allowances?—and the fire of it has cooled, more than I like to confess to
                myself, But I will carry it out. Even with the pleasure paled, the duty remains, and
                I will not spare him.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e286"><i>And for my help, a sharp resentment rises in me when I reflect
                that he who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not suffered by it.
                The lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character, and in the change he is
                happy. He, the guilty party, is absolved from all suffering; you, the innocent, are
                borne down with it. But be comforted—he shall harvest his share.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e290">SILVER GULCH, <i>May 19</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e295"><i>I placarded Form No. 1 at midnight of April 3; an hour later I
                slipped Form No. 2 under his chamber door, notifying him to leave Denver at or
                before 11.50 the night of the 14th.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e299"><i>Some late bird of a reporter stole one of my placards, then hunted
                the town over and found the other one, and stole that. In this manner he
                accomplished what the profession call a "scoop"—that is, he got a valuable
                item, and saw to it that no other paper got it. And so his paper—the principal
                one in the town—had it in glaring type on the editorial page in the morning,
                followed by a Vesuvian opinion of our wretch a column long, which wound up by adding
                a thousand dollars to our reward on the paper's account! The journals out here know
                how to do the noble thing—when there's business in it.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e303"><i>At breakfast I occupied my usual seat—selected because it
                afforded a view of papa Fuller's face, and was near enough for me to hear the talk
                that went on at his table. Seventy-five or a hundred people were in the room, and
                all discussing that item, and saying they hoped the seeker would find that rascal
                and remove the pollution of his presence from the town—with a rail, or a
                bullet, or something.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e307"><i>When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leave—folded
                up—in one hand, and the newspaper in the other; and it gave me more than half
                a pang to see him. His cheerfulness was all gone, and he looked old and pinched and
                ashy. And then—only think of the things he had to listen to! Mamma, he heard
                his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and characterizations drawn
                from the very dictionaries and phrase-books of Satan's own authorized editions down
                below. And more than that, he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them. His
                applause tasted bitter in his mouth, though; he could not disguise that from me; and
                it was observable that his appetite was gone; he only nibbled; he couldn't eat.
                Finally a man said:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e311"><i>"It is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing
                what this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel. I hope so."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e316"><i>Ah, dear, it was pitiful the way Fuller winced, and glanced around
                scared! He couldn't endure any more, and got up and left.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e320"><i>During several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in
                Mexico, and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could, and give the
                property his personal attention. He played his cards well; said he would take
                $40,000—a quarter in cash, the rest in safe notes; but that as he greatly
                needed money on account of his new purchase, he would diminish his terms for cash in
                full, He sold out for $30,000. And then, what do you think he did? He asked for
                greenbacks, and took them, saying the man in Mexico was a New-Englander, with a head
                full of crotchets, and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts. People thought it
                queer, since a draft on New York could produce greenbacks quite conveniently. There
                was talk of this odd thing, but only for a day; that is as long as any topic lasts
                in Denver.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e324"><i>I was watching, all the time. As soon as the sale was completed
                and the money paid—which was on the 11th—I began to stick to Fuller's
                track without dropping it for a moment. That night—no, 12th, for it was a
                little past midnight—I tracked him to his room, which was four doors from mine
                in the same hall; then I went back and put on my muddy day-laborer disguise,
                darkened my complexion, and sat down in my room in the gloom, with a gripsack handy,
                with a change in it, and my door ajar. For I suspected that the bird would take wing
                now. In half an hour an old woman passed by, carrying a grip: I caught the familiar
                whiff, and followed with my grip, for it was Fuller. He left the hotel by a side
                entrance, and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three
                blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness, and got into a two-horse hack, which of
                course was waiting for him by appointment. I took a seat (uninvited) on the trunk
                platform behind, and we drove briskly off. We drove ten miles, and the hack stopped
                at a way-station and was discharged. Fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow
                under the awning, as far as he could get from the light; I went inside, and watched
                the ticket-office. Fuller bought no ticket; I bought none. Presently the train came
                along, and he boarded a car; I entered the same car at the other end, and came down
                the aisle and took the seat behind him. When he paid the conductor and named his
                objective point, I dropped back several seats, while the conductor was changing a
                bill, and when he came to me I paid to the same place—about a hundred miles
                westward.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e328"><i>From that time for a week on end he led me a dance. He traveled
                here and there and yonder—always on a general westward trend—but he boas
                not a woman after the first day. He was a laborer, like myself, and wore bushy false
                whiskers. His outfit was perfect, and he could do the character without thinking
                about it, for he had served the trade for wages. His nearest friend could not have
                recognized him. At last he located himself here, the obscurest little mountain camp
                in Montana; he has a shanty, and goes out prospecting daily; is gone all day, and
                avoids society. I am living at a miner's boardinghouse, and it is an awful place:
                the bunks, the food, the dirt—everything.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e332"><i>We have been here four weeks, and in that time I have seen him but
                once; but every night I go over his track and post myself. As soon as he engaged a
                shanty here I went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed that Denver hotel to
                keep my baggage till I should send for it. I need nothing here but a change of army
                shirts, and I brought that with me.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e336">SILVER GULCH, <i>June 12</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e341"><i>The Denver episode has never found its way here, I think. I know
                the most of the men in camp, and they have never referred to it, at least in my
                hearing. Fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions. He has located a
                claim, two miles away, in an out-of-the-way place in the mountains; it promises very
                well, and he is working it diligently. Ah, but the change in him! He never smiles,
                and he keeps quite to himself, consorting with no one—he who was so fond of
                company and so cheery only two months ago. I have seen him passing along several
                times recently—drooping, forlorn, the spring gone from his step, a pathetic
                figure. He calls himself David Wilson.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e345"><i>I can trust him to remain here until we disturb him. Since you

                and edible food, and endurable beds, and bodily decency; then I will fetch my

                than the other one; he came here a young widower in '79, aged twenty-one—a
                year before you were married; and the documents to prove it are innumerable. Last
                night I talked with familiar friends of his who have known him from the day of his
                arrival. I said nothing, but a few days from now I will land him in this town again,
                with the loss upon his mine made good; and there will be a banquet, and a
                torch-light procession, and there will not be any expense on anybody but me. Do you
                call this "gush"? I am only a boy, as you well know; it is</i> my <i>privilege. By and by I shall not be a boy any more.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e389">SILVER GULCH, <i>July 3</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e394"><i>Mother, he is gone! Gone, and left no trace. The scent was cold

                to-night, in a wagon—two or three hours of that, then I get a train. I don't
                know where I'm going, but I must go; to try to keep still would be
            torture.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e398"><i>Of course he has effaced himself with a new name and a disguise.

                have not been able to think it out, and I have tried till my brains are addled. "If
                the gentleman who lately bought a mine in Mexico and sold one in Denver will send
                his address to" (to whom, mother!), "it will be explained to him that it was all a
                mistake; his forgiveness will be asked, and full reparation made for a loss which he
                sustained in a certain matter." Do you see? He would think it a trap. Well, any one
                would. If I should say, "It is now known that he was not the man wanted, but another
                man—a man who once bore the same name, but discarded it for good
                reasons"—would that answer? But the Denver people would wake up then and say
                "Oho!" and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks, and say, "Why did he
                run away if he wasn't the right man?—it is too thin." If I failed to find him
                he would be ruined there—there where there is no taint upon him now. You have
                a better head than mine. Help me.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e412"><i>I have one clue, and only one. I know his handwriting. If he puts

                mistake; a dog would have gone the other way. But I am only part dog, and can get
                very humanly stupid when excited. He had been stopping in that house ten days; I
                almost know, now, that he stops long nowhere, the past six or eight months, but is
                restless and has to keep moving. I understand that feeling! and I know what it is to
                feel it. He still uses the name he had registered when I came so near catching him
                nine months ago—"James Walker"; doubtless the same he adopted when he fled
                from Silver Gulch. An unpretending man, and has small taste for fancy names. I
                recognized the hand easily, through its slight disguise. A square man, and not good

                not much loss to the house." "</i>Old!" <i>I suppose he is, now I
                hardly heard; I was there but a moment. I rushed along his trail, and it led me to a

                horizon! I should have saved half on hour if I had gone in the right direction at
                first. I could have taken a fast tug, and should have stood a chance of catching

                Hope Cañon; I traced him to a point thirty miles from here, but there I lost
                the trail; some one gave him a lift in a wagon, I suppose. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e463"><i>I am taking a rest, now—modified by searchings for the lost
                trail. I was tired to death, mother, and low-spirited, and sometimes coming
                uncomfortably near to losing hope; but the miners in this little camp are good
                fellows, and I am used to their sort this long time back; and their breezy ways
                freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles. I have been here a month. I am
                cabining with a young fellow named "Sammy" Hillyer, about twenty-five, the only son
                of his mother—like me—and loves her dearly, and writes to her every
                week—part of which is like me. He is a timid body, and in the matter of
                intellect—well, he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire; but no
                matter, he is well liked; he is good and fine, and it is meat and bread and rest and
                luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again. I wish "James Walker"
                could have it. He had friends; he liked company. That brings up that picture of him,
                the time that I saw him last. The pathos of it! It comes before me often and often.
                At that very time, poor thing, I was girding up my conscience to make him move on
                again!</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e467"><i>Hillyer's heart is better than mine, better than anybody's in the
                community, I suppose, for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the
                camp—Flint Buckner—and the only man Flint ever talks with or allows to
                talk with him. He says he knows Flint's history, and that it is trouble that has
                made him what he is, and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can. Now
                none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a lodger like Flint
                Buckner, from all I hear about him outside. I think that this one detail will give
                you a better idea of Sammy's character than any labored-out description I could
                furnish you of him. In one of our talks he said something about like this: "Flint is
                a kinsman of mine, and he pours out all his troubles to me—empties his breast
                from time to time, or I reckon it would burst. There couldn't be any unhappier man,
                Archy Stillman; his life had been made up of misery of mind—he isn't near as
                old as he looks. He has lost the feel of reposefulness and peace—oh, years and
                years ago! He doesn't know what good luck is—never has had any; often says he
                wishes he was in the other hell, he is so tired of this one."</i></p>Chapter IV<p id="TwaDoubd1e474"><i>No real gentleman will tell the naked truth in the presence of
              ladies.</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e478">It was a crisp and spicy morning in early October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with
            the glory-fires of autumn, hung burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge
            provided by kind Nature for the wingless wild things that have their homes in the
            tree-tops and would visit together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and
            yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the
            sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere;
            far in he empty sky a solitary esophagus[1] slept upon motionless
            wing; everywhere brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e483">October is the time—1900; Hope Cañon is the place, a silver-mining camp
            away down in the Esmeralda region. It is a secluded spot, high and remote; recent as to
            discovery; thought by its occupants to be rich in metal—a year or two's
            prospecting will decide that matter one way or the other. For inhabitants, the camp has
            about two hundred miners, one white woman and child, several Chinese washermen, five
            squaws, and a dozen vagrant buck Indians in rabbit-skin robes, battered plug hats, and
            tin-can necklaces. There are no mills as yet; no church, no newspaper. The camp has
            existed but two years; it has made no big strike; the world is ignorant of its name and
            place. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e485">On both sides of the cañon the mountains rise wall-like, three thousand feet,
            and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the
            sun only once a day, when he sails over at noon. The village is a couple of miles long;
            the cabins stand well apart from each other. The tavern is the only "frame"
            house—the only house, one might say. It occupies a central position, and is the
            evening resort of the population. They drink there, and play seven-up and dominoes; also
            billiards, for there is a table, crossed all over with torn places repaired with
            court-plaster; there are some cues, but no leathers; some chipped balls which clatter
            when they run, and do not slow up gradually, but stop suddenly and sit down; there is a
            part of a cube of chalk, with a projecting jag of flint in it; and the man who can score
            six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bar's expense. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e487">Flint Buckner's cabin was the last one of the village, going south; his silver-claim
            was at the other end of the village, northward, and a little beyond the last hut in that
            direction. He was a sour creature, unsociable, and had no companionships. People who had
            tried to get acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him. His history was not
            known. Some believed that Sammy Hillyer knew it; others said no. If asked, Hillyer said
            no, he was not acquainted with it. Flint had a meek English youth of sixteen or
            seventeen with him, whom he treated roughly, both in public and in private; and of
            course this lad was applied to for information, but with no success. Fetlock
            Jones—name of the youth—said that Flint picked him up on a prospecting
            tramp, and as he had neither home nor friends in America, he had found it wise to stay
            and take Buckner's hard usage for the sake of the salary, which was bacon and beans.
            Further than this he could offer no testimony. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e489">Fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now, and under his meek exterior he was
            slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and humiliations which his master had put
            upon him. For the meek suffer bitterly from these hurts; more bitterly, perhaps, than do
            the manlier sort, who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the limit of
            endurance has been reached. Good-hearted people wanted to help Fetlock out of his
            trouble, and tried to get him to leave Buckner; but the boy showed fright at the
            thought, and said he "dasn't." Pat Riley urged him, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e491">"You leave the damned hunks and come with me; don't you be afraid. I'll take care of
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e496">The boy thanked him with tears in his eyes, but shuddered and said he "dasn't risk it";
            he said Flint would catch him alone, some time, in the night, and then—"Oh, it
            makes me sick, Mr. Riley, to think of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e498">Others said, "Run away from him; we'll stake you; skip out for the coast some night."
            But all these suggestions failed; he said Flint would hunt him down and fetch him back,
            just for meanness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e500">The people could not understand this. The boy's miseries went steadily on, week after
            week. It is quite likely that the people would have understood if they had known how he
            was employing his spare time. He slept in an out-cabin near Flint's; and there, nights,
            he nursed his bruises and his humiliations, and studied and studied over a single
            problem—how he could murder Flint Buckner and not be found out. It was the only
            joy he had in life; these hours were the only ones in the twenty-four which he looked
            forward to with eagerness and spent in happiness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e503">He thought of poison. No—that would not serve; the inquest would reveal where it
            was procured and who had procured it. He thought of a shot in the back in a lonely place
            when Flint would be homeward bound at midnight—his unvarying hour for the trip.
            No—somebody might be near, and catch him. He thought of stabbing him in his sleep.
            No—he might strike an inefficient blow, and Flint would seize him. He examined a
            hundred different ways—none of them would answer; for in even the very obscurest
            and secretest of them there was always the fatal defect of a <i>risk,</i> a chance, a possibility that he might be found out. He would have none of
            that. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e508">But he was patient, endlessly patient. There was no hurry, he said to himself. He would
            never leave Flint till he left him a corpse; there was no hurry—he would find the
            way. It was somewhere, and he would endure shame and pain and misery until he found it.
            Yes, somewhere there was a way which would leave not a trace, not even the faintest clue
            to the murderer—there was no hurry—he would find that way, and
            then—oh, then, it would just be good to be alive! Meantime he would diligently
            keep up his reputation for meekness; and also, as always theretofore, he would allow no
            one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about his oppressor. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e510">Two days before the before-mentioned October morning Flint had bought some things, and
            he and Fetlock had brought them home to Flint's cabin: a fresh box of candles, which
            they put in the corner; a tin can of blasting-powder, which they placed upon the
            candle-box; a keg of blasting-powder, which they placed under Flint's bunk; a huge coil
            of fuse, which they hung on a peg. Fetlock reasoned that Flint's mining operations had
            outgrown the pick, and that blasting was about to begin now. He had seen blasting done,
            and he had a notion of the process, but he had never helped in it. His conjecture was
            right—blasting-time had come. In the morning the pair carried fuse, drills, and
            the powder-can to the shaft; it was now eight feet deep, and to get into it and out of
            it a short ladder was used. They descended, and by command Fetlock held the
            drill—without any instructions as to the right way to hold it—and Flint
            proceeded to strike. The sledge came down; the drill sprang out of Fetlock's hand,
            almost as a matter of course. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e512">"You mangy son of a nigger, is that any way to hold a drill? Pick it up! Stand it up!
            There—hold fast. D— you! <i>I'll</i> teach you!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e517">At the end of an hour the drilling was finished. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e519">"Now, then, charge it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e521">The boy started to pour in the powder. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e523">"Idiot!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e525">A heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e527">"Get up! You can't lie sniveling there. Now, then, stick in the fuse <i>first. Now</i> put in the powder. Hold on, hold on! Are you going to fill the hole
              <i>all</i> up? Of all the sap-headed milksops I—Put in some
            dirt! Put in some gravel! Tamp it down! Hold on, hold on! Oh, great Scott! get out of
            the way!" He snatched the iron and tamped the charge himself, meantime cursing and
            blaspheming like a fiend. Then he fired the fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and ran
            fifty yards away, Fetlock following. They stood waiting a few minutes, then a great
            volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion; after a
            little there was a shower of descending stones; then all was serene again. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e535">"I wish to God you'd been in it!" remarked the master. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e538">They went down the shaft, cleaned it out, drilled another hole, and put in another
            charge. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e540">"Look here! How much fuse are you proposing to waste? Don't you know how to time a
            fuse?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e542">"No, sir." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e544">"You <i>don't!</i> Well, if you don't beat anything <i>I</i> ever saw!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e552">He climbed out of the shaft and spoke down: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e554">"Well, idiot, are you going to be all day? Cut the fuse and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e556">The trembling creature began: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e558">"If you please, sir, I—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e560">"You talk back to <i>me?</i> Cut it and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e565">The boy cut and lit. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e567">"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! I wish you were in—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e570">In his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft and ran. The boy was aghast. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e572">"Oh, my God! Help. Help! Oh, save me!" he implored. "Oh, what can I do! What <i>can</i> I do!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e577">He backed against the wall as tightly as he could; the sputtering fuse frightened the
            voice out of him; his breath stood still; he stood gazing and impotent; in two seconds,
            three seconds, four he would be flying toward the sky torn to fragments. Then he had an
            inspiration. He sprang at the fuse; severed the inch of it that was left above ground,
            and was saved. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e579">He sank down limp and half lifeless with fright, his strength gone; but he muttered
            with a deep joy: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e581">"He has learnt me! I knew there was a way, if I would wait." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e583">After a matter of five minutes Buckner stole to the shaft, looking worried and uneasy,
            and peered down into it. He took in the situation; he saw what had happened. He lowered
            the ladder, and the boy dragged himself weakly up it. He was very white. His appearance
            added something to Buckner's uncomfortable state, and he said, with a show of regret and
            sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from lack of practice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e585">"It was an accident, you know. Don't say anything about it to anybody; I was excited,
            and didn't notice what I was doing. You're not looking well; you've worked enough for
            to-day; go down to my cabin and eat what you want, and rest. It's just an accident, you
            know, on account of my being excited." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e587">"It scared me," said the lad, as he started away; "but I learnt something, so I don't
            mind it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e589">"Damned easy to please!" muttered Buckner, following him with his eye. I wonder if
            he'll tell? Mightn't he?... I wish it <i>had</i> killed him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e594">The boy took no advantage of his holiday in the matter of resting; he employed it in
            work, eager and feverish and happy work. A thick growth of chaparral extended down the
            mountainside clear to Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's labor was done in the dark
            intricacies of that stubborn growth; the rest of it was done in his own shanty. At last
            all was complete, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e596">"If he's got any suspicions that I'm going to tell on him, he won't keep them long,
            to-morrow. He will see that I am the same milksop as I always was—all day and the
            next. And the day after to-morrow night there 'll be an end of him; nobody will ever
            guess who finished him up nor how it was done. He dropped me the idea his own self, and
            that's odd."</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e602"> From the Springfield <i>Republican,</i> April 12, 1902.</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e607">To the Editor of the
                  Republican:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e610"><i>One of your citizens has asked me a
                  question about the "esophagus," and I wish to answer him through you. This in the
                  hope that the answer will get around, and save me some penmanship, for I have
                  already replied to the same question more than several times, and am not getting
                  as much holiday as I ought to have.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e614"><i>I
                  published a short story lately, and it was in that that I put the esophagus. I
                  will say privately that I expected it to bother some people—in fact, that
                  was the intention—but the harvest has been larger than I was calculating
                  upon. The esophagus has gathered in the guilty and the innocent alike, whereas I
                  was only fishing for the innocent—the innocent and confiding. I knew a few
                  of these would write and ask me; that would give me but little trouble; but, I was
                  not expecting that the wise and the learned would call upon me for succor.
                  However, that has happened, and it is time for me to speak up and stop the
                  inquiries if I can, for letter-writing is not restful to me, and I am not having
                  so much fun out of this thing as I counted on. That you may understand the
                  situation, I will insert a couple of sample inquiries. The first is from a public
                  instructor in the Philippines: </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e618">SANTA CRUZ, <i>Ilocos, Sur, P. I. </i><br><i>February 13,
                  1902</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e626"><i>My dear Sir,—I have just been
                  reading the first part of your latest story, entitled "A Double-barreled Detective
                  Story," and am very much delighted with it. In Part IV, page 264,</i> Harper's
                Magazine <i>for January, occurs this passage: "far in the empty sky a
                  solitary 'esophagus' slept upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness,
                  serenity, and the peace of God." Now, there is one word I do not understand,
                  namely, "esophagus." My only work of reference is the</i> Standard Dictionary,
                  <i>but that fails to explain the meaning. If you can spare the
                  time, I would be glad to have the meaning cleared up, as I consider the passage a
                  very touching and beautiful one. It may seem foolish to you, but consider my lack
                  of means away out in the northern part of Luzon.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e636"><i>Yours very truly.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e640"><i>Do you notice?
                  Nothing in the paragraph disturbed him but that one word. It shows that the
                  paragraph was most ably constructed for the deception it was intended to put upon
                  the reader. It was my intention that it should read plausibly, and it is now plain
                  that it does; it was my intention that it should be emotional and touching, and
                  you see, yourself, that it fetched this public instructor. Alas, If I had but left
                  that one treacherous word out, I should have scored! scored everywhere; and the
                  paragraph would have slidden through every reader's sensibilities like oil, and
                  left not a suspicion behind.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e644"><i>The other sample
                  inquiry is from a professor in a New England university. It contains one naughty
                  word (which I cannot bear to suppress), but he is not in the theological
                  department, so it is no harm:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e648"><i>Dear Mr.
                  Clemens: "Far in the empty sky a "solitary esophagus slept upon motionless
                  wing."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e653"><i>It is not often I get a chance to read
                  much periodical literature, but I have just gone through at this belated period,
                  with much gratification and edification, your "Double-barreled Detective
                  Story."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e657"><i>But what in hell is an esophagus? I
                  keep one myself, but it never sleeps in the air or anywhere else. My profession is
                  to deal with words, and esophagus interested me the moment I lighted upon it. But
                  as a companion of my youth used to say, "I'll be eternally, co-eternally cussed"
                  if l can make it out. Is it a joke, or I an ignoramus?</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e661"><i>Between you and me, I was almost ashamed of having fooled that man,
                  but for pride's sake I was not going to say so. I wrote and told him it was a
                  joke—and that is what I am now saying to my Springfield inquirer. And I told
                  him to carefully read the whole paragraph, and he would find not a vestige of
                  sense in any detail of it. This also I commend to my Springfield
                inquirer.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e665"><i>I have confessed. I am
                  sorry—partially. I will not do so any more—for the present. Don't ask
                  me any more questions; let the esophagus have a rest—on his same old
                  motionless wing. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e669">MARK TWAIN</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e672">New York City, <i>April 10, 1902</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e677"><i>( Editorial

                  appeared in</i> Harper's Magazine <i>for January and February
                  last, is the most elaborate of burlesques on detective fiction, with striking
                  melodramatic passages in which it is difficult to detect the deception, so ably is
                  it done. But the illusion ought not to endure even the first incident in the
                  February number. As for the paragraph which has so admirably illustrated the skill
                  of Mr. Clemens's ensemble and the carelessness of readers, here it
              is:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e688"><i>"It was a crisp and spicy morning in early
                  October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung
                  burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind nature for
                  the wingless wild things that have their home in the tree-tops and would visit
                  together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow flames in
                  brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the sensuous
                  fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere; far
                  in the empty sky a solitary esophagus slept upon motionless wings; everywhere
                  brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e692"><i>The success of Mark Twain's joke recalls to mind his story of the
                  petrified man in the cavern, whom he described most punctiliously, first giving a
                  picture of the scene, its impressive solitude, and all that; then going on to
                  describe the majesty of the figure, casually mentioning that the thumb of his
                  right hand rested against the side of his nose; then after further description
                  observing that the fingers of the right hand were extended in a radiating fashion;
                  and, recurring to the dignified attitude and position of the man, incidentally
                  remarked that the thumb of the left hand was in contact with the little finger of
                  the right—and so on. But was it so ingeniously written that Mark, relating
                  the history years later in an article which appeared in that excellent magazine of
                  the past, the</i> Galaxy, <i>declared that no one ever found out
                  the joke, and, if we remember aright, that that astonishing old mockery was
                  actually looked for in the region where he, as a Nevada newspaper editor, had
                  located it. It is certain that Mark Twain's jumping frog has a good many more
                  "pints" than any other frog.</i></p>Chapter V<p id="TwaDoubd1e702">The next day came and went. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e704">It is now almost midnight, and in five minutes the new morning will begin. The scene is
            in the tavern billiard-room. Rough men in rough clothing, slouch-hats, breeches stuffed
            into boot-tops, some with vests, none with coats, are grouped about the boiler-iron
            stove, which has ruddy cheeks and is distributing a grateful warmth; the billiard-balls
            are clacking; there is no other sound—that is, within; the wind is fitfully
            moaning without. The men look bored; also expectant. A hulking broad-shouldered miner,
            of middle age, with grizzled whiskers, and an unfriendly eye set in an unsociable face,
            rises, slips a coil of fuse upon his arm, gathers up some other personal properties, and
            departs without word or greeting to anybody. It is Flint Buckner. As the door closes
            behind him a buzz of talk breaks out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e706">"The regularest man that ever was," said Jake Parker, the blacksmith: "you can tell
            when it's twelve just by him leaving, without looking at your Waterbury." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e708">"And it's the only virtue he's got, as fur as I know," said Peter Hawes, miner. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e710">"He's just a blight on this society," said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "If I was
            running this shop I'd make him say something, <i>some</i> time or other,
            or vamos the ranch." This with a suggestive glance at the barkeeper, who did not choose
            to see it, since the man under discussion was a good customer, and went home pretty well
            set up, every night, with refreshments furnished from the bar. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e715">"Say," said Ham Sandwich, miner, "does any of you boys ever recollect of him asking you
            to take a drink?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e717"><i>"Him?</i> Flint <i>Buckner?</i> Oh, Laura!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e724">This sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous general outburst in one form of words or
            another from the crowd. After a brief silence, Pat Riley, miner, said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e726">"He's the 15-puzzle, that cuss. And his boy's another one. <i>I
            </i>can't make them out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e731">"Nor anybody else," said Ham Sandwich; "and if they are 15-puzzles how are you going to
            rank up that other one? When it comes to A 1 right-down solid mysteriousness, he lays
            over both of them. <i>Easy—</i>don't he?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e737">"You bet!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e739">Everybody said it. Every man but one. He was the new-comer-Peterson. He ordered the
            drinks all round, and asked who No. 3 might be. All answered at once, "Archy Stillman!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e741">"Is he a mystery?" asked Peterson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e743">"Is <i>he</i> a mystery? Is Archy <i>Stillman a</i>
            mystery?" said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "Why, the fourth dimension's foolishness to
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e754">For Ferguson was learned. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e756">Peterson wanted to hear all about him; everybody wanted to tell him; everybody began.
            But Billy Stevens, the barkeeper, called the house to order, and said one at a time was
            best. He distributed the drinks, and appointed Ferguson to lead. Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e758">"Well, he's a boy. And that is just about all we know about him. You can pump him till
            you are tired; it ain't any use; you won't get anything. At least about his intentions,
            or line of business, or where he's from, and such things as that. And as for getting at
            the nature and get-up of his main big chief mystery, why, he'll just change the subject,
            that's all. You can <i>guess</i> till you're black in the
            face—it's your privilege—but suppose you do, where do you arrive at?
            Nowhere, as near as I can make out," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e763">"What <i>is</i> his big chief one?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e768">"Sight, maybe. Hearing, maybe. Instinct, maybe. Magic, maybe. Take your
            choice—grownups, twenty-five; children and servants, half price. Now I'll tell you
            what he can do. You can start here, and just disappear; you can go and hide wherever you
            want to, I don't care where it is, nor how far—and he'll go straight and put his
            finger on you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e770">"You don't mean it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e772">"I just do, though. Weather's nothing to him—elemental conditions is nothing to
            him—he don't even take notice of them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e775">"Oh, come! Dark? Rain? Snow? Hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e777">"It's all the same to <i>him.</i> He don't give a damn." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e782">"Oh, <i>say—</i>including <i>fog,</i> per'aps?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e790"><i>"Fog!</i> he's got an eye 't can plunk through it like a bullet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e794">"Now, boys, honor bright, what's he giving me?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e796">"It's a fact!" they all shouted. "Go on, Wells-Fargo." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e798">"Well, sir, you can leave him here, chatting with the boys, and you can slip out and go
            to any cabin in this camp and open a book—yes, sir, a dozen of them—and take
            the page in your memory, and he'll start out and go straight to that cabin and open
            every one of them books at the right page, and call it off, and never make a mistake." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e800">"He must be the devil!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e802">"More than one has thought it. Now I'll tell you a perfectly wonderful thing that he
            done. The other night he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e804">There was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside, the door flew open, and an excited
            crowd burst in, with the camp's one white woman in the lead and crying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e806">"My child! my child! she's lost and gone! For the love of God help me to find Archy
            Stillman; we've hunted everywhere!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e809">Said the barkeeper: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e811">"Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, and don't worry. He asked for a bed three hours ago,
            tuckered out tramping the trails the way he's always doing, and went up-stairs. Ham
            Sandwich, run up and roust him out; he's in No. 14." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e813">The youth was soon down-stairs and ready. He asked Mrs. Hogan for particulars. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e815">"Bless you, dear, there ain't any; I wish there was. I put her to sleep at seven in the
            evening, and when I went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself, she was gone. I
            rushed for your cabin, dear, and you wasn't there, and I've hunted for you ever since,
            at every cabin down the gulch, and now I've come up again, and I'm that distracted and
            scared and heartbroke; but, thanks to God, I've found you at last, dear heart, and
            you'll find my child. Come on! come quick!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e817">"Move right along; I'm with you, madam. Go to your cabin first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e819">The whole company streamed out to join the hunt. All the southern half of the village
            was up, a hundred men strong, and waiting outside, a vague dark mass sprinkled with
            twinkling lanterns. The mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself
            to the narrow road, and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders. In a
            few minutes the Hogan cabin was reached. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e821">"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Hogan; "there's where she was; it's where I laid her at
            seven o'clock; but where she is now, God only knows." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e823">"Hand me a lantern," said Archy. He set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it,
            pretending to examine the ground closely. "Here's her track," he said, touching the
            ground here and there and yonder with his finger. "Do you see?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e825">Several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see. One or two
            thought they discerned something like a track; the others shook their heads and
            confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp
            enough to discover. One said, "Maybe a child's foot could make a mark on it, but <i>I</i> don't see how." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e830">Young Stillman stepped outside, held the light to the ground, turned leftward, and
            moved three steps, closely examining; then said, "I've got the direction—come
            along; take the lantern, somebody." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e832">He strode off swiftly southward, the files following, swaying and bending in and out
            with the deep curves of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the mouth of the gorge was reached;
            before them stretched the sagebrush plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman called a halt,
            saying, "We mustn't start wrong, now; we must take the direction again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e835">He took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards; then said,
            "Come on; it's all right," and gave up the lantern. In and out among the sage-bushes he
            marched, a quarter of a mile, bearing gradually to the right; then took a new direction
            and made another great semicircle; then changed again and moved due west nearly half a
            mile—and stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e837">"She gave it up, here, poor little chap. Hold the lantern. You can see where she sat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e839">But this was in a slick alkali flat which was surfaced like steel, and no person in the
            party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a
            cushion on a veneer like that. The bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the
            spot, lamenting. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e841">"But where is she, then?" some one said. "She didn't stay here. We can see <i>that</i> much, anyway." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e846">Stillman moved about in a circle around the place, with the lantern, pretending to hunt
            for tracks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e848">"Well!" he said presently, in an annoyed tone, "I don't understand it." He examined
            again. "No use. She was here—that's certain; she never <i>walked</i> away from here—and that's certain. It's a puzzle; I can't make it
            out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e853">The mother lost heart then. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e855">"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! some flying beast has got her. I'll never see her
            again!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e857">"Ah, <i>don't</i> give up," said Archy. "We'll find her—don't
            give up." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e862">"God bless you for the words, Archy Stillman!" and she seized his hand and kissed it
            fervently. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e864">Peterson, the new-comer, whispered satirically in Ferguson's ear: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e867">"Wonderful performance to find this place, wasn't it? Hardly worth while to come so
            far, though; any other supposititious place would have answered just as well—hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e869">Ferguson was not pleased with the innuendo. He said, with some warmth: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e871">"Do you mean to insinuate that the child hasn't been here? I tell you the child <i>has</i> been here! Now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a
            little fuss as—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e876">"All right!" sang out Stillman. "Come, everybody, and look at this! It was right under
            our noses all the time, and we didn't see it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e878">There was a general plunge for the ground at the place where the child was alleged to
            have rested, and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to see the thing that Archy's finger
            was resting upon. There was a pause, then a several-barreled sigh of disappointment. Pat
            Riley and Ham Sandwich said, in the one breath: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e880">"What is it, Archy? There's nothing here." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e882">"Nothing? Do you call <i>that</i> nothing?" and he swiftly traced upon
            the ground a form with his finger. "There—don't you recognize it now? It's Injun
            Billy's track. He's got the child." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e887">"God be praised !" from the mother. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e889">"Take away the lantern. I've got the direction. Follow!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e891">He started on a run, racing in and out among the sage-bushes a matter of three hundred
            yards, and disappeared over a sand-wave; the others struggled after him, caught him up,
            and found him waiting. Ten steps away was a little wickiup, a dim and formless shelter
            of rags and old horse-blankets, a dull light showing through its chinks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e893">"You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the lad. "It's your privilege to be first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e896">All followed the sprint she made for the wickiup, and saw, with her, the picture its
            interior afforded. Injun Billy was sitting on the ground; the child was asleep beside
            him. The mother hugged it with a wild embrace, which included Archy Stillman, the
            grateful tears running down her face, and in a choked and broken voice she poured out a
            golden stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments which has its home in full
            richness nowhere but in the Irish heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e898">"I find her bymeby it is ten o'clock," Billy explained. "She 'sleep out yonder, ve'y
            tired—face wet, been cryin', 'spose; fetch her home, feed her, she heap much
            hungry—go 'sleep 'gin." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e900">In her limitless gratitude the happy mother waived rank and hugged him too, calling him
            "the angel of God in disguise." And he probably was in disguise if he was that kind of
            an official. He was dressed for the character. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e902">At half past one in the morning the procession burst into the village singing, "When
            Johnny Comes Marching Home," waving its lanterns and swallowing the drinks that were
            brought out all along its course. It concentrated at the tavern, and made a night of
            what was left of the morning.</p>Chapter VI<p id="TwaDoubd1e907">The next afternoon the village was electrified with an immense sensation. A grave and
            dignified foreigner of distinguished bearing and appearance had arrived at the tavern,
            and entered this formidable name upon the register: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e909">SHERLOCK HOLMES
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e913">The news buzzed from cabin to cabin, from claim to claim; tools were dropped, and the
            town swarmed toward the center of interest. A man passing out at the northern end of the
            village shouted it to Pat Riley, whose claim was the next one to Flint Buckner's. At
            that time Fetlock Jones seemed to turn sick. He muttered to himself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e915">"Uncle <i>Sherlock!</i> The mean luck of it!—that <i>he </i>should come just when..." He dropped into a reverie, and
            presently said to himself: "But what's the use of being afraid of <i>him?
            </i>Anybody that knows him the way I do knows he can't detect a crime except where he
            plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and hires some fellow to commit it
            according to instructions.... Now there ain't going to <i>be</i> any
            clues this time—so, what show has he got? None at all. No, sir; everything's
            ready. If I was to risk putting it off—...No, I won't run any risk like that.
            Flint Buckner goes out of this world to-night, for sure." Then another trouble presented
            itself. "Uncle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening, and
            how am I going to get rid of him? for I've <i>got</i> to be at my cabin
            a minute or two about eight o'clock." This was an awkward matter, and cost him much
            thought. But he found a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll go for a walk, and I'll leave
            him in the road a minute, so that he won't see what it is I do: the best way to throw a
            detective off the track, anyway, is to have him along when you are preparing the thing.
            Yes, that's the safest—I'll take him with me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e932">Meantime the road in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping
            for a glimpse of the great man. But he kept his room, and did not appear. None but
            Ferguson, Jake Parker the blacksmith, and Ham Sandwich had any luck. These enthusiastic
            admirers of the great scientific detective hired the tavern's detained-baggage lockup,
            which looked into the detective's room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide,
            ambushed themselves in it, and cut some peep-holes in the window-blind. Mr. Holmes's
            blinds were down; but by and by he raised them. It gave the spies a hair-lifting but
            pleasurable thrill to find themselves face to face with the Extraordinary Man who had
            filled the world with the fame of his more than human ingenuities. There he
            sat—not a myth, not a shadow, but real, alive, compact of substance, and almost
            within touching distance with the hand. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e934">"Look at that head!" said Ferguson, in an awed voice. "By gracious! <i>that's</i> a head!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e939">"You bet!" said the blacksmith, with deep reverence. "Look at his nose! look at his
            eyes! Intellect? Just a battery of it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e941">"And that paleness," said Ham Sandwich. "Comes from thought—that's what it comes
            from. Hell! duffers like us don't know what real thought <i>is."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e946">"No more we don't," said Ferguson. "What we take for thinking is just
            blubber-and-slush," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e948">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo. And look at that frown—that's <i>deep</i> thinking—away down, down, forty fathom into the bowels of things.
            He's on the track of something." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e954">"Well, he is, and don't you forget it. Say—look at that awful gravity—look
            at that pallid solemness—there ain't any corpse can lay over it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e956">"No, sir, not for dollars! And it's his'n by hereditary rights, too; he's been dead
            four times a'ready, and there's history for it. Three times natural, once by accident.
            I've heard say he smells damp and cold, like a grave. And he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e958">" 'Sh! Watch him! There—he's got his thumb on the bump on the near corner of his
            forehead, and his forefinger on the off one. His think-works is just a-<i>grinding</i> now, you bet your other shirt." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e963">"That's so. And now he's gazing up toward heaven and stroking his mustache slow,
            and—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e965">"Now he has rose up standing, and is putting his clues together on his left fingers
            with his right finger. See? he touches the forefinger—now middle finger—now
            ring-finger—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e967">"Stuck!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e969">"Look at him scowl! He can't seem to make out <i>that</i> clue. So
            he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e974">"See him smile!—like a tiger—and tally off the other fingers like nothing!
            He's got it, boys; he's got it sure!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e976">"Well, I should <i>say!</i> I'd hate to be in that man's place that
            he's after." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e981">Mr. Holmes drew a table to the window, sat down with his back to the spies, and
            proceeded to write. The spies withdrew their eyes from the peep-holes, lit their pipes,
            and settled themselves for a comfortable smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with conviction: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e983">"Boys, it's no use talking, he's a wonder! He's got the signs of it all over him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e986">"You hain't ever said a truer word than that, Wells-Fargo," said Jake Parker. "Say,
            wouldn't it 'a' been nuts if he'd a-been here last night?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e988">"Oh, by George, but wouldn't it!" said Ferguson. "Then we'd have seen <i>scientific</i> work. Intellect—just pure intellect—away up on the upper
            levels, dontchuknow. Archy is all right, and it don't become anybody to belittle <i>him,</i> I can tell you. But his gift is only just eyesight, sharp as
            an owl's, as near as I can make it out just a grand natural animal talent, no more, no
            less, and prime as far as it goes, but no intellect in it, and for awfulness and
            marvelousness no more to be compared to what this man does than—than—Why,
            let me tell you what <i>he'd</i> have done. He'd have stepped over to
            Hogan's and glanced—just <i>glanced,</i> that's all—at the
            premises, and that's enough. See everything? Yes, sir, to the last little detail; and
            he'll know more about that place than the Hogans would know in seven years. Next, he
            would sit down on the bunk, just as ca'm, and say to Mrs. Hogan—<i>Say,</i> Ham, consider that you are Mrs. Hogan. I'll ask the questions; you answer
            them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1005">"All right; go on." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1007">" 'Madam, if you please—attention—do not let your mind wander. Now,
            then—sex of the child?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1009">" 'Female, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1011">" 'Um—female. Very good, very good. Age?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1013">" 'Turned six, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1015">" 'Um—young, weak—two miles. Weariness will overtake it then. It will sink
            down and sleep. We shall find it two miles away, or less. Teeth?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1017">" 'Five, your Honor, and one a-coming.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1019">" 'Very good, very good, <i>very</i> good, indeed.' You see, boys, <i>he</i> knows a clue when he sees it, when it wouldn't mean a dern thing
            to anybody else. 'Stockings, madam? Shoes?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1027">" 'Yes, your Honor—both.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1030">" 'Yarn, perhaps? Morocco?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1032">" 'Yarn, your Honor. And kip.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1034">" 'Um—kip. This complicates the matter. However, let it go—we shall manage.
            Religion?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1036">" 'Catholic, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1038">" 'Very good. Snip me a bit from the bed blanket, please. Ah, thanks. Part
            wool—foreign make. Very well. A snip from some garment of the child's, please.
            Thanks. Cotton. Shows wear. An excellent clue, excellent. Pass me a pallet of the floor
            dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, many thanks. Ah, admirable, admirable! <i>Now</i> we know where we are, I think.' You see, boys, he's got all the
            clues he wants now; he don't need anything more. Now, then, what does this Extraordinary
            Man do? He lays those snips and that dirt out on the table and leans over them on his
            elbows, and puts them together side by side and studies them—mumbles to himself,
            'Female'; changes them around—mumbles, 'Six years old'; changes them this way and
            that—again mumbles: 'Five teeth—one
            a-coming—Catholic—yarn—cotton—kip—damn that kip.' Then he
            straightens up and gazes toward heaven, and plows his hands through his hair—plows
            and plows, muttering, 'Damn that kip!' Then he stands up and frowns, and begins to tally
            off his clues on his fingers—and gets stuck at the ring-finger. But only just a
            minute—then his face glares all up in a smile like a house afire, and he
            straightens up stately and majestic, and says to the crowd, 'Take a lantern, a couple of
            you, and go down to Injun Billy's and fetch the child—the rest of you go 'long
            home to bed; good-night, madam; good-night, gents.' And he bows like the Matterhorn, and
            pulls out for the tavern. That's <i>his</i> style, and the <i>Only—</i>scientific, intellectual—all over in fifteen
            minutes—no poking around all over the sage-brush range an hour and a half in a
            mass-meeting crowd for <i>him,</i> boys—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1055">"By Jackson, it's grand!" said Ham Sandwich. "Wells-Fargo, you've got him down to a
            dot. He ain't painted up any exacter to the life in the books. By George, I can juse <i>see</i> him—can't you, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1060">"You bet you! It's just a photograft, that's what it is." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1062">Ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success, and grateful. He sat silently
            enjoying his happiness a little while, then he murmured, with a deep awe in his voice, </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1064">"I wonder if God made him?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1066">There was no response for a moment; then Ham Sandwich said, reverently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1068">"Not all at one time, I reckon."</p>Chapter VII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1073">At eight o'clock that evening two persons were groping their way past Flint Buckner's
            cabin in the frosty gloom. They were Sherlock Holmes and his nephew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1075">"Stop here in the road a moment, uncle," said Fetlock, "while I run to my cabin; I
            won't be gone a minute." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1077">He asked for something—the uncle furnished it—then he disappeared in the
            darkness, but soon returned, and the talking-walk was resumed. By nine o'clock they had
            wandered back to the tavern. They worked their way through the billiard-room, where a
            crowd had gathered in the hope of getting a glimpse of the Extraordinary Man. A royal
            cheer was raised. Mr. Holmes acknowledged the compliment with a series of courtly bows,
            and as he was passing out his nephew said to the assemblage: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1079">"Uncle Sherlock's got some work to do, gentlemen, that 'll keep him till twelve or one;
            but he'll be down again then, or earlier if he can, and hopes some of you'll be left to
            take a drink with him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1081">"By George, he's just a duke, boys! Three cheers for Sherlock Holmes, the greatest man
            that ever lived!" shouted Ferguson. "Hip, hip, hip—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1083">"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Tiger!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1085">The uproar shook the building, so hearty was the feeling the boys put into their
            welcome. Up-stairs the uncle reproached the nephew gently, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1087">"What did you get me into that engagement for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1089">"I reckon you don't want to be unpopular, do you, uncle? Well, then, don't you put on
            any exclusiveness in a mining-camp, that's all. The boys admire you; but if you was to
            leave without taking a drink with them, they'd set you down for a snob. And besides, you
            said you had home talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1091">The boy was right, and wise—the uncle acknowledged it. The boy was wise in
            another detail which he did not mention—except to himself: "Uncle and the others
            will come handy—in the way of nailing an <i>alibi </i>where it
            can't be budged." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1097">He and his uncle talked diligently about three hours. Then, about midnight, Fetlock
            stepped down-stairs and took a position in the dark a dozen steps from the tavern, and
            waited. Five minutes later Flint Buckner came rocking out of the billiard-room and
            almost brushed him as he passed. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1099">"I've <i>got</i> him!" muttered the boy. He continued to himself,
            looking after the shadowy form: "Good-by—good-by for good, Flint Buckner; you
            called my mother a—well, never mind what: it's all right, now; you're taking your
            last walk, friend." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1104">He went musing back into the tavern. "From now till one is an hour. We'll spend it with
            the boys; it's good for the <i>alibi."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1109">He brought Sherlock Holmes to the billiard-room, which was jammed with eager and
            admiring miners; the guest called the drinks, and the fun began. Everybody was happy;
            everybody was complimentary; the ice was soon broken, songs, anecdotes, and more drinks
            followed, and the pregnant minutes flew. At six minutes to one, when the jollity was at
            its highest— </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1111"><i>Boom!</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1115">There was silence instantly. The deep sound came rolling and rumbling frown peak to
            peak up the gorge, then died down, and ceased. The spell broke, then, and the men made a
            rush for the door, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1117">"Something's blown up!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1119">Outside, a voice in the darkness said, "It's away down the gorge; I saw the flash." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1121">The crowd poured down the cañon—Holmes, Fetlock, Archy Stillman,
            everybody. They made the mile in a few minutes. By the light of a lantern they found the
            smooth and solid dirt floor of Flint Buckner's cabin; of the cabin itself not a vestige
            remained, not a rag nor a splinter. Nor any sign of Flint. Search-parties sought here
            and there and yonder, and presently a cry went up. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1123">"Here he is!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1125">It was true. Fifty yards down the gulch they had found him—that is, they had
            found a crushed and lifeless mass which represented him. Fetlock Jones hurried thither
            with the others and looked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1128">The inquest was a fifteen-minute affair. Ham Sandwich, foreman of the jury, handed up
            the verdict, which was phrased with a certain unstudied literary grace, and closed with
            this finding, to wit: that "deceased came to his death by his own act or some other
            person or persons unknown to this jury not leaving any family or similar effects behind
            but his cabin which was blown away and God have mercy on his soul amen." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1130">Then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd, for the storm-center of interest was
            there—Sherlock Holmes. The miners stood silent and reverent in a half-circle,
            inclosing a large vacant space which included the front exposure of the site of the late
            premises. In this considerable space the Extraordinary Man was moving about, attended by
            his nephew with a lantern. With a tape he took measurements of the cabin site; of the
            distance from the wall of chaparral to the road; of the height of the chaparral bushes;
            also various other measurements. He gathered a rag here, a splinter there, and a pinch
            of earth yonder, inspected them profoundly, and preserved them. He took the "lay" of the
            place with a pocket-compass, allowing two seconds for magnetic variation. He took the
            time (Pacific) by his watch, correcting it for local time. He paced off the distance
            from the cabin site to the corpse, and corrected that for tidal differentiation. He took
            the altitude with a pocket-aneroid, and the temperature with a pocket-thermometer.
            Finally he said, with a stately bow: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1132">"It is finished. Shall we return, gentlemen?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1134">He took up the line of march for the tavern, and the crowd fell into his wake,
            earnestly discussing and admiring the Extraordinary Man, and interlarding guesses as to
            the origin of the tragedy and who the author of it might he. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1136">"My, but it's grand luck having him here—hey, boys?" said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1138">"It's the biggest thing of the century," said Ham Sandwich. "It 'll go all over the
            world; you mark my words." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1140"><i>"You</i> bet!" said Jake Parker, the blacksmith. "It 'll boom this
            camp. Ain't it so, Wells-Fargo?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1144">"Well, as you want my opinion—if it's any sign of how <i>I
            </i>think about it, I can tell you this: yesterday I was holding the Straight Flush
            claim at two dollars a foot; I'd like to see the man that can get it at sixteen to-day." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1149">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo! It's the grandest luck a new camp ever struck. Say, did
            you see him collar them little rags and dirt and things? What an eye! He just can't
            overlook a clue—'tain't <i>in </i>him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1154">"That's so. And they wouldn't mean a thing to anybody else; but to him, why, they're
            just a book—large print at that." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1156">"Sure's you're born! Them odds and ends have got their little old secret, and they
            think there ain't anybody can pull it; but, land! when he sets his grip there they've
            got to squeal, and don't you forget it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1159">"Boys, I ain't sorry, now, that he wasn't here to roust out the child; this is a bigger
            thing, by a long sight. Yes, sir, and more tangled up and scientific and intellectual." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1161">"I reckon we're all of us glad it's turned out this way. Glad? 'George! it ain't any
            name for it. Dontchuknow, Archy could 've <i>learnt</i> something if
            he'd had the nous to stand by and take notice of how that man works the system. But no;
            he went poking up into the chaparral and just missed the whole thing." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1166">"It's true as gospel; I seen it myself. Well, Archy's young. He'll know better one of
            these days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1168">"Say, boys, who do you reckon done it?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1170">That was a difficult question, and brought out a world of unsatisfying conjecture.
            Various men were mentioned as possibilities, but one by one they were discarded as not
            being eligible. No one but young Hillyer had been intimate with Flint Buckner; no one
            had really had a quarrel with him; he had affronted every man who had tried to make up
            to him, although not quite offensively enough to require bloodshed. There was one name
            that was upon every tongue from the start, but it <i>was</i> the last to
            get utterance—Fetlock Jones's. It was Pat Riley that mentioned it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1175">"Oh, well," the boys said, "of course we've all thought of him, because he had a
            million rights to kill Flint Buckner, and it was just his plain duty to do it. But all
            the same there's two things we can't get around: for one thing, he hasn't got the sand;
            and for another, he wasn't anywhere near the place when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1177">"I know it," said Pat. "He was there in the billiard-room with us when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1179">"Yes, and was there all the time for an hour <i>before</i> it
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1184">"It's so. And lucky for him, too. He'd have been suspected in a minute if it hadn't
            been for that."</p>Chapter VIII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1189">The tavern dining-room had been cleared of all its furniture save one six-foot pine
            table and a chair. This table was against one end of the room; the chair was on it;
            Sherlock Holmes, stately, imposing, impressive, sat in the chair. The public stood. The
            room was full. The tobacco-smoke was dense, the stillness profound. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1191">The Extraordinary Man raised his hand to command additional silence; held it in the air
            a few moments; then, in brief, crisp terms he put forward question after question, and
            noted the answers with "Um-ums," nods of the head, and so on. By this process he learned
            all about Flint Buckner, his character, conduct, and habits, that the people were able
            to tell him. It thus transpired that the Extraordinary Man's nephew was the only person
            in the camp who had a killing-grudge against Flint Buckner. Mr. Holmes smiled
            compassionately upon the witness, and asked, languidly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1193">"Do any of you gentlemen chance to know where the lad Fetlock Jones was at the time of
            the explosion?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1195">A thunderous response followed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1197">"In the billiard-room of this house!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1199">"Ah. And had he just come in?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1201">"Been there all of an hour!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1203">"Ah. It is about—about—well, about how far might it be to the scene of the
            explosions" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1205">"All of a mile!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1207">"Ah. It isn't <i>much</i> of an alibi, 'tis true, but—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1213">A storm-burst of laughter, mingled with shouts of "By jiminy, but he's
            chain-lightning!" and "Ain't you sorry you spoke, Sandy?" shut off the rest of the
            sentence, and the crushed witness drooped his blushing face in pathetic shame. The
            inquisitor resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1215">"The lad Jones's somewhat <i>distant</i> connection with the case"
              (laughter<i>) "</i>having been disposed of, let us now call the
            eye-witnesses of the tragedy, and listen to what they have to say." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1223">He got out his fragmentary clues and arranged them on a sheet of cardboard on his knee.
            The house held its breath and watched. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1225">"We have the longitude and the latitude, corrected for magnetic variation, and this
            gives us the exact location of the tragedy. We have the altitude, the temperature, and
            the degree of humidity prevailing—inestimably valuable, since they enable us to
            estimate with precision the degree of influence which they would exercise upon the mood
            and disposition of the assassin at that time of the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1227"><i>(Buzz of admiration; muttered remark, "By George, but he's
              deep.")</i> He fingered his clues. "And now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak
            to us. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1231">"Here we have an empty linen shot-bag. What is its message? This: that robbery was the
            motive, not revenge. What is its further message? This: that the assassin was of
            inferior intelligence—shall we say light-witted, or perhaps approaching that? How
            do we know this? Because a person of sound intelligence would not have proposed to rob
            the man Buckner, who never had much money with him. But the assassin might have been a
            stranger? Let the bag speak again. I take from it this article. It is a bit of
            silver-bearing quartz. It is peculiar. Examine it, please—you—and
            you—and you. Now pass it back, please. There is but one lode on this coast which
            produces just that character and color of quartz; and that is a lode which crops out for
            nearly two miles on a stretch, and in my opinion is destined, at no distant day, to
            confer upon its locality a globe-girdling celebrity, and upon its two hundred owners
            riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Name that lode, please." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1233">"The Consolidated Christian Science and Mary Ann!" was the prompt response. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1235">A wild crash of hurrahs followed, and every man reached for his neighbor's hand and
            wrung it, with tears in his eyes; and Wells-Fargo Ferguson shouted, "The Straight Flush
            is on the lode, and up she goes to a hunched and fifty a foot—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1240">When quiet fell, Mr. Holmes resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1242">"We perceive, then, that three facts are established, to wit: the assassin was
            approximately light-witted; he was not a stranger; his motive was robbery, not revenge.
            Let us proceed. I hold in my hand a small fragment of fuse, with the recent smell of
            fire upon it. What is its testimony? Taken with the corroborative evidence of the
            quartz, it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner. What does it tell us further?
            This, gentlemen: that the assassination was consummated by means of an explosive. What
            else does it say? This: that the explosive was located against the side of the cabin
            nearest the road—the front side—for within six feet of that spot I found it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1244">"I hold in my fingers a burnt Swedish match—the kind one rubs on a safety-box. I
            found it in the road, six hundred and twenty-two feet from the abolished cabin. What
            does it say? This: that the train was fired from that point. What further does it tell
            us? This: that the assassin was left-handed. How do I know this? I should not be able to
            explain to you, gentlemen, how I know it, the signs being so subtle that only long
            experience and deep study can enable one to detect them. But the signs are here, and
            they are reinforced by a fact which you must have often noticed in the great detective
            narratives—that <i>all </i>assassins are left-handed." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1250">"By Jackson, <i>that's</i> so." said Ham Sandwich, bringing his great
            hand down with a resounding slap upon his thigh; "blamed if I ever thought of it
            before." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1255">"Nor I!" "Nor I!" cried several. "Oh, there can't anything escape <i>him—</i>look at his eye!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1260">"Gentlemen, distant as the murderer was from his doomed victim, he did not wholly
            escape injury. This fragment of wood which I now exhibit to you struck him. It drew
            blood. Wherever he is, he bears the telltale mark. I picked it up where he stood when he
            fired the fatal train," He looked out over the house from his high perch, and his
            countenance began to darken; he slowly raised his hand, and pointed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1262">"There stands the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1264">For a moment the house was paralyzed with amazement; then twenty voices burst out with: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1266">"Sammy Hillyer? Oh, <i>hell,</i> no! <i>Him?</i> It's
            pure foolishness!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1274">"Take care, gentlemen—be not hasty. Observe—he has the blood-mark on his
            brow." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1276">Hillyer turned white with fright. He was near to crying. He turned this way and that,
            appealing to every face for help and sympathy; and held out his supplicating hands
            toward Holmes and began to plead: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1278"><i>"Don't,</i> oh, don't! I never did it; I give my word I never did
            it. The way I got this hurt on my forehead was—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1282">"Arrest him, constable!" cried Holmes. "I will swear out the warrant" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1284">The constable moved reluctantly forward—hesitated—stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1287">Hillyer broke out with another appeal. "Oh, Archy, don't let them do it; it would kill
            mother! <i>You</i> know how I got the hurt. Tell them, and save me,
            Archy; save me!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1292">Stillman worked his way to the front, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1294">"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be afraid." Then he said to the house, "Never mind how he
            got the hurt; it hasn't anything to do with this case, and isn't of any consequence." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1296">"God bless you, Archy, for a true friend!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1298">"Hurrah for Archy! Go in, boy, and play 'em a knock-down flush to their two pair 'n' a
            jack!" shouted the house, pride in their home talent and a patriotic sentiment of
            loyalty to it rising suddenly in the public heart and changing the whole attitude of the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1300">Young Stillman waited for the noise to cease; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1302">"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand by that door yonder, and Constable Harris to stand by
            the other one here, and not let anybody leave the room. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1304">"Said and done. Go on, old man!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1306">"The criminal is present, I believe. I will show him to you before long, in case I am
            right in my guess. Now I will tell you all about the tragedy, from start to finish. The
            motive <i>wasn't </i>robbery; it was revenge. The murderer <i>wasn't</i> light-witted. He <i>didn't</i> stand six
            hundred and twenty-two feet away. He <i>didn't </i>get hit with a piece
            of wood. He <i>didn't</i> place the explosive against the cabin. He <i>didn't</i> bring a shot-bag with him, and he <i>wasn't</i> left-handed. With the exception of these errors, the distinguished
            guest's statement of the case is substantially correct." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1330">A comfortable laugh rippled over the house; friend nodded to friend, as much as to say,
            "That's the word, with the bark <i>on</i> it. Good lad, good boy. <i>He</i> ain't lowering his flag any!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1338">The guest's serenity was not disturbed. Stillman resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1341">"I also have some witnesses; and I will presently tell you where you can find some
            more." He held up a piece of coarse wire; the crowd craned their necks to see. "It has a
            smooth coating of melted tallow on it. And here is a candle which is burned half-way
            down. The remaining half of it has marks cut upon it an inch apart. Soon I will tell you
            where I found these things. I will now put aside reasonings, guesses, the impressive
            hitchings of odds and ends of clues together, and the other showy theatricals of the
            detective trade, and tell you in a plain, straightforward way just how this dismal thing
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1343">He paused a moment, for effect—to allow silence and suspense to intensify and
            concentrate the house's interest; then he went on: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1345">"The assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains. It was a good plan, very
            ingenious, and showed an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. It was a plan which was
            well calculated to ward off all suspicion from its inventor. In the <i>first</i> place, he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart, and lit it and timed
            it. He found it took three hours to burn four inches of it. I tried it myself for half
            an hour, awhile ago, up-stairs here, while the inquiry into Flint Buckner's character
            and ways was being conducted in this room, and I arrived in that way at the rate of a
            candle's consumption when sheltered from the wind. Having proved his trial candle's
            rate, he blew it out—I have already shown it to you—and put <i>his</i> inch-marks on a fresh one. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1353">"He put the fresh one into a tin candlestick. Then at the five-hour mark he bored a
            hole through the candle with a red-hot wire. I have already shown you the wire, with a
            smooth coat of tallow on it—tallow that had been melted and had cooled. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1355">"With labor—very hard labor, I should say—he struggled up through the stiff
            chaparral that clothes the steep hillside back of Flint Buckner's place, tugging an
            empty flour-barrel with him. He placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place, and in
            the bottom of it he set the candlestick. Then he measured off about thirty-five feet of
            fuse—the barrel's distance from the back of the cabin. He bored a hole in the side
            of the barrel—here is the large gimlet he did it with. He went on and finished his
            work; and when it was done, one end of the fuse was in Buckner's cabin, and the other
            end, with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder, was in the hole in the
            candle—timed to blow the place up at one o'clock this morning, provided the candle
            was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening—which I am betting it was—and
            provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the
            fuse—which I am also betting there was, though I can't prove it. Boys, the barrel
            is there in the chaparral, the candle's remains are in it in the tin stick; the
            burnt-out fuse is in the gimlet-hole, the other end is down the hill where the late
            cabin stood. I saw them all an hour or two ago, when the Professor here was measuring
            off unimplicated vacancies and collecting relics that hadn't anything to do with the
            case." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1357">He paused. The house drew a long, deep breath, shook its strained cords and muscles
            free and burst into cheers. "Dang him!" said Ham Sandwich, "that's why he was snooping
            around in the chaparral, instead of picking up points out of the P'fessor's game. Looky
            here—he ain't no fool, boys." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1359">"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1361">But Stillman was resuming: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1363">"While we were out yonder an hour or two ago, the owner of the gimlet and the trial
            candle took them from a place where he had concealed them—it was not a good
            place—and carried them to what he probably thought was a better one, two hundred
            yards up in the pine woods, and hid them there, covering them over with pine needles. It
            was there that I found them. The gimlet exactly fits the hole in the barrel. And
            now—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1365">The Extraordinary Man interrupted him. He said, sarcastically: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1367">"We have had a very pretty fairy tale, gentlemen—very pretty indeed. Now I would
            like to ask this young man a question or two." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1370">Some of the boys winced, and Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1372">"I'm afraid Archy's going to catch it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1374">The others lost their smiles and sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1376">"Let us proceed to examine into this fairy tale in a consecutive and orderly
            way—by geometrical progression, so to speak—linking detail to detail in a
            steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent and unassailable march upon this tinsel
            toy fortress of error, the dream fabric of a callow imagination. To begin with, young
            sir, I desire to ask you but three questions at present—<i>at
              present.</i> Did I understand you to say it was your opinion that the supposititious
            candle was lighted at about eight o'clock yesterday evening?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1381">"Yes, sir—about eight." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1383">"Could you say exactly eight?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1385">"Well, no, I couldn't be that exact." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1387">"Um. If a person had been passing along there just about that time, he would have been
            almost sure to encounter that assassin, do you think?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1389">"Yes, I should think so." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1391">"Thank you, that is all. For the present. I say, all <i>for the
              present."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1396">"Dern him. he's laying for Archy," said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1399">"It's so," said Ham Sandwich. "I don't like the look of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1401">Stillman said, glancing at the guest, "I was along there myself at half-past
            eight—no, about nine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1403">"In-deed? This is interesting—this is very interesting. Perhaps you encountered
            the assassin?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1405">"No, I encountered no one." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1407">"Ah. Then—if you will excuse the remark—I do not quite see the relevancy of
            the information." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1409">"It has none. At present. I say it has none—at present." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1411">He paused. Presently he resumed: "I did not encounter the assassin, but I am on his
            track, I am sure, for I believe he is in this room. I will ask you all to pass one by
            one in front of me—here, where there is a good light—so that I can see your
            feet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1413">A buzz of excitement swept the place, and the march began, the guest looking on with an
            iron attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified success. Stillman stooped, shaded
            his eyes with his hand, and gazed down intently at each pair of feet as it passed. Fifty
            men tramped monotonously by—with no result. Sixty. Seventy. The thing was
            beginning to look absurd. The guest remarked, with suave irony:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1415">"Stillman Accuses Sherlock Holmes"Image of Stillman pointing a finger at Sherlock Holmes</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1421">"Assassins appear to be scarce this evening." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1423">The house saw the humor if it, and refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. Ten or twelve
            more candidates tramped by—no, <i>danced </i>by, with airy and
            ridiculous capers which convulsed the spectators—then suddenly Stillman put out
            his hand and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1429">"This is the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1431">"Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhedrim!" roared the crowd; and at once let fly a
            pyrotechnic explosion and dazzle and confusion of stirring remarks inspired by the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1433">At the height of the turmoil the guest stretched out his hand, commanding peace. The
            authority of a great name and a great personality laid its mysterious compulsion upon
            the house, and it obeyed. Out of the panting calm which succeeded, the guest spoke,
            saying, with dignity and feeling: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1435"><i>"This</i> is serious. It strikes at an innocent life. Innocent
            beyond suspicion! Innocent beyond peradventure! Hear me <i>prove</i> it;
            observe how simple a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie. Listen. My
            friends, that lad was never out of my sight yesterday evening at <i>any</i> time!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1445">It made a deep impression. Men turned their eyes upon Stillman with grave inquiry in
            them. His face brightened, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1447">"I <i>knew</i> there was another one!" He stepped briskly to the table
            and glanced at the guest's feet, then up at his face, and said: "You were <i>with</i> him! You were not fifty steps from him when he lit the candle
            that by and by fired the powder!" <i>(Sensation.) "</i>And what is more,
            you furnished the matches yourself !" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1458">Plainly the guest seemed hit; it looked so to the public. He opened his mouth to speak;
            the words did not come freely. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1460">"This—er—this is insanity—this—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1462">Stillman pressed his evident advantage home. He held up a charred match. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1464">"Here <i>is</i> one of them. I found it in the barrel—and there's
              <i>another</i> one there." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1472">The guest found his voice at once. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1475"><i>"Yes—</i>and put them there yourself!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1479">It was recognized a good shot. Stillman retorted. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1481">"It is <i>wax—</i>a breed unknown to this camp. I am ready to be
            searched for the box. Are you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1486">The guest was staggered this time—the dullest eye could see it. He fumbled with
            his hands; once or twice his lips moved, but the words did not come. The house waited
            and watched, in tense suspense, the stillness adding effect to the situation. Presently
            Stillman said, gently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1488">"We are waiting for your decision." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1490">There was silence again during several moments; then the guest answered, in a low
            voice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1492">"I refuse to be searched." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1494">There was no noisy demonstration, but all about the house one voice after another
            muttered: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1496">"That settles it! He's Archy's meat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1498">What to do now? Nobody seemed to know. It was an embarrassing situation for the
            moment—merely, of course, because matters had taken such a sudden and unexpected
            turn that these unpractised minds were not prepared for it, and had come to a
            standstill, like a stopped clock, under the shock. But after a little the machinery
            began to work again, tentatively, and by twos and threes the men put their heads
            together and privately buzzed over this and that and the other proposition. One of these
            propositions met with much favor; it was, to confer upon the assassin a vote of thanks
            for removing Flint Buckner, and let him go. But the cooler heads opposed it, pointing
            out that addled brains in the Eastern states would pronounce it a scandal, and make no
            end of foolish noise about it. Finally the cool heads got the upper hand, and obtained
            general consent to a proposition of their own; their leader then called the house to
            order and stated it—to this effect: that Fetlock Jones be jailed and put upon
            trial. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1500">The motion was carried. Apparently there was nothing further to do now, and the people
            were glad, for, privately, they were impatient to get out and rush to the scene of the
            tragedy, and see whether that barrel and the other things were really there or not. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1503">But no—the break-up got a check. The surprises were not over yet. For a while
            Fetlock Jones had been silently sobbing, unnoticed in the absorbing excitements which
            had been following one another so persistently for some time; but when his arrest and
            trial were decreed, he broke out despairingly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1505">"No! it's no use. I don't want any jail, I don't want any trial; I've had all the hard
            luck I want, and all the miseries. Hang me now, and let me out! It would all come out,
            anyway—there couldn't anything save me. He has told it all, just as if he'd been
            with me and seen it—<i>I</i> don't know how he found out; and
            you'll find the barrel and things, and then I wouldn't have any chance any more. I
            killed him; and <i>you'd</i> have done it too, if he'd treated you like
            a dog, and you only a boy, and weak and poor, and not a friend to help you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1513">"And served him damned well right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. "Looky here, boys—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1515">From the constable: "Order! Order, gentlemen!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1517">A voice: "Did your uncle know what you was up to?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1519">"No, he didn't." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1521">"Did he give you the matches, sure enough?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1523">"Yes, he did; but he didn't know what I wanted them for." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1525">"When you was out on such a business as that, how did you venture to risk having him
            along—and him a <i>detective?</i> How's that?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1530">The boy hesitated, fumbled with his buttons in an embarrassed way, then said, shyly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1532">"I know about detectives, on account of having them in the family; and if you don't
            want them to find out about a thing, it's best to have them around when you do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1535">The cyclone of laughter which greeted this native discharge of wisdom did not modify
            the poor little waif's embarrassment in any large degree.</p>Chapter IX<p id="TwaDoubd1e1540">From a letter to Mrs. Stillman, dated merely "Tuesday." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1542">Fetlock Jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log cabin, and left there
              to await his trial. Constable Harris provided him with a couple of days' rations,
              instructed him to keep a good guard over himself, and promised to look in on him as
              soon as further supplies should be due. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1545">Next morning a score of us went with Hillyer, out of friendship, and helped him bury
              his late relative, the unlamented Buckner, and I acted as first assistant pall-bearer,
              Hillyer acting as chief. Just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy
              stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, limped by with his head down, and I caught the
              scent I had chased around the globe! It was the odor of Paradise to my perishing hope!
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1548">In a moment I was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder. He
              slumped to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had withered him in his tracks; and
              as the boys came running he struggled to his knees and put up his pleading hands to
              me, and out of his chattering jaws he begged me to persecute him no more, and said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1551">"You have hunted me around the world, Sherlock Holmes, yet God is my witness I have
              never done any man harm!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1554">A glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane. That was my work, mother!
              The tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery I felt in that moment, but
              nothing else can ever do it. The boys lifted him up, and gathered about him, and were
              full of pity of him, and said the gentlest and touchingest things to him, and said
              cheer up and don't be troubled, he was among friends now, and they would take care of
              him, and protect him, and hang any man that laid a hand on him. They are just like so
              many mothers, the rough mining-camp boys are, when you wake up the south side of their
              hearts; yes, and just like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up
              the opposite of that muscle. They did everything they could think of to comfort him,
              but nothing succeeded until Wells-Fargo Ferguson, who is a clever strategist, said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1557">"If it's only Sherlock Holmes that's troubling you, you needn't worry any more."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1560">"Why?" asked the forlorn lunatic, eagerly. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1563">"Because he's dead again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1566">"Dead! Dead! Oh, don't trifle with a poor wreck like me. <i>Is
              </i>he dead? On honor, now—is he telling me true, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1573">"True as you're standing there!" said Ham Sandwich, and they all backed up the
              statement in a body. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1576">"They hung him in San Bernardino last week," added Ferguson, clinching the matter,
              "whilst he was searching around after you. Mistook him for another man. They're sorry,
              but they can't help it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1579">"They're a-building him a monument," said Ham Sandwich, with the air of a person who
              had contributed to it, and knew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1582">"James Walker" drew a deep sigh—evidently a sigh of relief—and said
              nothing; but his eyes lost something of their wildness, his countenance cleared
              visibly, and its drawn look relaxed a little. We all went to our cabin, and the boys
              cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for, and while they
              were about it Hillyer and I outfitted him from hat to shoe-leather with new clothes of
              ours, and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him. "Old" is the right word,
              and a pity, too: old by the droop of him, and the frost upon his hair, and the marks
              which sorrow and distress have left upon his face; though he is only in his prime in
              the matter of years. While he ate, we smoked and chatted; and when he was finishing he
              found his voice at last, and of his own accord broke out with his personal history. I
              cannot furnish his exact words, but I will come as near it as I can. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1585">THE "WRONG MAN'S" STORY </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1588">It happened like this: I was in Denver. I had been there many years; sometimes I
              remember how many, sometimes I don't—but it isn't any matter. All of a sudden I
              got a notice to leave, or I would be exposed for a horrible crime committed long
              before—years and years before—in the East. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1591">I knew about that crime, but I was not the criminal; it was a cousin of mine of the
              same name. What should I better do? My head was all disordered by fear, and I didn't
              know. I was allowed very little time—only one day, I think it was. I would be
              ruined if I was published, and the people would lynch me, and not believe what I said.
              It is always the way with lynchings: when they find out it is a mistake they are
              sorry, but it is too late—the same as it was with Mr. Holmes, you see. So I said
              I would sell out and get money to live on, and run away until it blew over and I could
              come back with my proofs. Then I escaped in the night and went a long way off in the
              mountains somewhere, and lived disguised and had a false name. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1594">I got more and more troubled and worried, and my troubles made me see spirits and
              hear voices, and I could not think straight and clear on any subject, but got confused
              and involved and had to give it up, because my head hurt so. It got to be worse and
              worse; more spirits and more voices. They were about me all the time; at first only in
              the night, then in the day too. They were always whispering around my bed and plotting
              against me, and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out, because I got no good rest.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1597">And then came the worst. One night the whispers said, "We'll never manage, because
              we can't <i>see</i> him, and so can't point him out to the people."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1603">They sighed; then one said: "We must bring Sherlock Holmes. He can be here in twelve
              days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1606">They all agreed, and whispered and jibbered with joy. But my heart broke; for I had
              read about that man, and knew what it would be to have him upon my track, with his
              superhuman penetration and tireless energies. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1610">The spirits went away to fetch him, and I got up at once in the middle of the night
              and fled away, carrying nothing but the hand-bag that had my money in it—thirty
              thousand dollars; two-thirds of it are in the bag there yet. It was forty days before
              that man caught up on my track. I just escaped. From habit he had written his real
              name on a tavern register, but had scratched it out and written "Dagget Barclay" in
              the place of it. But fear gives you a watchful eye and keen, and I read the true name
              through the scratches, and fled like a deer. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1613">He has hunted me all over this world for three years and a half—the Pacific
              states, Australasia, India—everywhere you can think of; then back to Mexico and
              up to California again, giving me hardly any rest; but that name on the registers
              always saved me, and what is left of me is alive yet. And I am <i>so</i> tired! A cruel time he has given me, yet I give you my honor I have never
              harmed him nor any man. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1619">That was the end of the story, and it stirred those boys to bloodheat, he sure of
              it. As for me—each word burnt a hole in me where it struck. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1622">We voted that the old man should bunk with us, and be my guest and Hillyer's. I
              shall keep my own counsel, naturally; but as soon as he is well rested and nourished,
              I shall take him to Denver and rehabilitate his fortunes. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1625">The boys gave the old fellow the bone-smashing good-fellowship handshake of the
              mines, and then scattered away to spread the news. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1628">At dawn next morning Wells-Fargo Ferguson and Ham Sandwich called us softly out, and
              said, privately: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1631">"That news about the way that old stranger has been treated has spread all around,
              and the camps are up. They are piling in from everywhere, and are going to lynch the
              P'fessor. Constable Harris is in a dead funk, and has telephoned the sheriff. Come
              along!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1634">We started on a run. The others were privileged to feel as they chose, but in my
              heart's privacy I hoped the sheriff would arrive in time; for I had small desire that
              Sherlock Holmes should hang for my deeds, as you can easily believe. I had heard a
              good deal about the sheriff, but </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1637">for reassurance's sake I asked: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1640">"Can he stop a mob?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1643">"Can <i>he</i> stop a mob! Can Jack <i>Fairfax</i>
              stop a mob! Well, I should smile! Ex-desperado—nineteen scalps on his string.
              Can <i>he!</i> Oh, I <i>say!"</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1659">As we tore up the gulch, distant cries and shouts and yells rose faintly on the
              still air, and grew steadily in strength as we raced along. Roar after roar burst out,
              stronger and stronger, nearer and nearer; and at last, when we closed up upon the
              multitude massed in the open area in front of the tavern, the crash of sound was
              deafening. Some brutal roughs from Daly's gorge had Holmes in their grip, and he was
              the calmest man there; a contemptuous smile played about his lips, and if any fear of
              death was in his British heart, his iron personality was master of it and no sign of
              it was allowed to appear. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1662">"Come to a vote, men!" This from one of the Daly gang, Shadbelly Higgins. "Quick! is
              it hang, or shoot?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1665">"Neither!" shouted one of his comrades. "He'll he alive again in a week; burning's
              the only permanency for <i>him."</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1671">The gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a thundercrash of approval, and
              went struggling and surging toward the prisoner, and closed around him, shouting,
              "Fire! fire's the ticket!" They dragged him to the horse-post, backed him against it,
              chained him to it, and piled wood and pine cones around him waist-deep. Still the
              strong face did not blench, and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1674">"A match! fetch a match!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1677">Shadbelly struck it, shaded it with his hand, stooped, and held it under a pine
              cone. A deep silence fell upon the mob. The cone caught, a tiny flame flickered about
              it a moment or two. I seemed to catch the sound of distant hoofs—it grew more
              distinct—still more and more distinct, more and more definite, but the absorbed
              crowd did not appear to notice it. The match went out. The man struck another,
              stooped, and again the flame rose; this time it took hold and began to
              spread—here and there men turned away their faces. The executioner stood with
              the charred match in his fingers, watching his work. The hoof-beats turned a
              projecting crag, and now they came thundering down upon us. Almost the next moment
              there was a shout: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1680">"The sheriff!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1683">And straightway he came tearing into the midst, stood his horse almost on his hind
              feet, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1686">"Fall back, you gutter-snipes!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1689">He was obeyed. By all but their leader. He stood his ground, and his hand went to
              his revolver. The sheriff covered him promptly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1692">"Drop your hand, you parlor desperado. Kick the fire away. Now unchain the
              stranger." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1696">The parlor desperado obeyed. Then the sheriff made a speech; sitting his horse at
              martial ease, and not warming his words with any touch of fire, but delivering them in
              a measured and deliberate way, and in a tone which harmonized with their character and
              made them impressively disrespectful. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1699">"You're a nice lot—now ain't you? Just about eligible to travel with this bilk
              here—Shadbelly Higgins—this loud-mouthed sneak that shoots people in the
              back and calls himself a desperado. If there's anything I do particularly despise,
              it's a lynching mob; I've never seen one that had a man in it. It has to tally up a
              hundred against one before it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor. It's
              made up of cowards, and so is the community that breeds it; and ninety-nine times out
              of a hundred the sheriff's another one." He paused—apparently to turn that last
              idea over in his mind and taste the juice of it—then he went on: "The sheriff
              that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the lowest-down coward there is. By
              the statistics there was a hundred and eighty-two of them drawing sneak pay in America
              last year. By the way it's going, pretty soon there 'll be a new disease in the
                doctor-books—<i>sheriff complaint."</i> That idea pleased
              him—any one could see it. "People will say, 'Sheriff sick again?' 'Yes; got the
              same old thing.' And next there 'll be a new title. People won't say, 'He's running
              for sheriff of Rapaho County,' for instance; they'll say, 'He's running for Coward of
              Rapaho.' Lord, the idea of a grown-up person being afraid of a lynch mob!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1705">He turned an eye on the captive, and said, "Stranger, who are you, and what have you
              been doing?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1708">"My name is Sherlock Holmes, and I have not been doing anything." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1711">It was wonderful, the impression which the sound of that name made on the sheriff,
              notwithstanding he must have come posted. He spoke up with feeling, and said it was a
              blot on the county that a man whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their
              fame and their ingenuity, and whose histories of them had won every reader's heart by
              the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting, should be visited under the Stars
              and Stripes by an outrage like this. He apologized in the name of the whole nation,
              and made Holmes a most handsome bow, and told Constable Harris to see him to his
              quarters, and hold himself personally responsible if he was molested again. Then he
              turned to the mob and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1714">"Hunt your holes, you scum!" which they did; then he said: "Follow me, Shadbelly;
              I'll take care of your case myself. No—keep your popgun; whenever I see the day
              that I'll be afraid to have you behind me with that thing, it 'll be time for me to
              join last year's hundred and eighty-two"; and he rode off in a walk, Shadbelly
              following. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1717">When we were on our way back to our cabin, toward breakfast-time, we ran upon the
              news that Fetlock Jones had escaped from his lock-up in the night and is gone! Nobody

There has been a
            wedding, between a handsome young man of slender means and a rich young girl—a
            case of love at first sight and a precipitate marriage; a marriage bitterly opposed by
            the girl's widowed father. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e140">Jacob Fuller, the bridegroom, is twenty-six years old, is of an old but unconsidered
            family which had by compulsion emigrated from Sedgemoor, and for King James's purse's
            profit, so everybody said—some maliciously the rest merely because they believed
            it. The bride is nineteen and beautiful. She is intense, high-strung, romantic,
            immeasurably proud of her Cavalier blood, and passionate in her love for her young
            husband. For its sake she braved her father's displeasure, endured his reproaches,
            listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions and went from his house
            without his blessing, proud and happy in the proofs she was thus giving of the quality
            of the affection which had made its home in her heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e142">The morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her. Her husband put aside
            her proffered caresses, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e144">"Sit down. I have something to say to you. I loved you. That was before I asked your
            father to give you to me. His refusal is not my grievance—I could have endured
            that. But the things he said of me to you—that is a different matter.
            There—you needn't speak; I know quite well what they were; I got them from
            authentic sources. Among other things he said that my character was written in my face;
            that I was treacherous, a dissembler, a coward, and a brute without sense of pity or
            compassion: the 'Sedgemoor trade-mark,' he called it—and 'white-sleeve badge.' Any
            other man in my place would have gone to his house and shot him down like a dog. I
            wanted to do it, and was minded to do it, but a better thought came to me: to put him to
            shame; to break his heart; to kill him by inches. How to do it? Through my treatment of
            you, his idol! I would marry you; and then—Have patience. You will see. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e146">From that moment onward, for three months, the young wife suffered all the
            humiliations, all the insults, all the miseries that the diligent and inventive mind of
            the husband could contrive, save physical injuries only. Her strong pride stood by her,
            and she kept the secret of her troubles. Now and then the husband said, "Why don't you
            go to your father and tell him?" Then he invented new tortures, applied them, and asked
            again. She always answered, "He shall never know by my mouth," and taunted him with his
            origin; said she was the lawful slave of a scion of slaves, and must obey, and
            would—up to that point, but no further; he could kill her if he liked, but he
            could not break her; it was not in the Sedgemoor breed to do it. At the end of the three
            months he said, with a dark significance in his manner, "I have tried all things but
            one"—and waited for her reply. "Try that," she said, and curled her lip in
            mockery. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e148">That night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes, then said to her: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e150">"Get up and dress!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e152">She obeyed—as always, without a word. He led her half a mile from the house, and
            proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public road; and succeeded, she
            screaming and struggling. He gagged her then, struck her across the face with his
            cowhide, and set his bloodhounds on her. They tore the clothes off her, and she was
            naked. He called the dogs off, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e154">"You will be found—by the passing public. They will be dropping along about three
            hours from now, and will spread the news—do you hear? Good-by. You have seen the
            last of me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e156">He went away then. She moaned to herself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e159">"I shall bear a child—to <i>him!</i> God grant it may be a boy!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e164">The farmers released her by and by—and spread the news, which was natural. They
            raised the country with lynching intentions, but the bird had flown. The young wife shut
            herself up in her father's house; he shut himself up with her, and thenceforth would see
            no one. His pride was broken, and his heart; so he wasted away, day by day, and even his
            daughter rejoiced when death relieved him. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e166">Then she sold the estate and disappeared.</p>Chapter 2<p id="TwaDoubd1e171">In 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded New England village,
            with no company but a little boy about five years old. She did her own work, she
            discouraged acquaintanceships, and had none. The butcher, the baker, and the others that
            served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was
            Stillman, and that she called the child Archy. Whence she came they had not been able to
            find out, but they said she talked like a Southerner. The child had no playmates and no
            comrade, and no teacher but the mother. She taught him diligently and intelligently, and
            was satisfied with the results—even a little proud of them. One day Archy said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e173">"Mamma, am I different from other children?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e175">"Well, I suppose not. Why?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e177">"There was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had been by and I
            said yes, and she said how long since I saw him and I said I hadn't seen him at all, and
            she said how did I know he'd been by, then, and I said because I smelt his track on the
            sidewalk, and she said I was a dum fool and made a mouth at me. What did she do that
            for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e179">The young woman turned white, and said to herself, "It's a birth mark! The gift of the
            bloodhound is in him." She snatched the boy to her breast and hugged him passionately,
            saying, "God has appointed the way!" Her eyes were burning with a fierce light, and her
            breath came short and quick with excitement. She said to herself: "The puzzle is solved
            now; many a time it has been a mystery to me, the impossible things the child has done
            in the dark, but it is all clear to me now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e181">She set him in his small chair, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e183">"Wait a little till I come, dear; then we will talk about the matter." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e185">She went up to her room and took from her dressing-table several small articles and put
            them out of sight: a nail-file on the floor under the bed; a pair of nail-scissors under
            the bureau; a small ivory paper-knife under the wardrobe. Then she returned, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e187">"There! I have left some things which I ought to have brought down." She named them,
            and said, "Run up and bring them, dear." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e189">The child hurried away on his errand and was soon back again with the things. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e192">"Did you have any difficulty, dear?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e194">"No, mamma; I only went where you went." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e196">During his absence she had stepped to the bookcase, taken several books from the bottom
            shelf, opened each, passed her hand over a page, noting its number in her memory, then
            restored them to their places. Now she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e198">"I have been doing something while you have been gone, Archy. Do you think you can find
            out what it was?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e200">The boy went to the bookcase and got out the books that had been touched, and opened
            them at the pages which had been stroked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e202">The mother took him in her lap, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e204">"I will answer your question now, dear. I have found out that in one way you are quite
            different from other people. You can see in the dark, you can smell what other people
            cannot, you have the talents of a bloodhound. They are good and valuable things to have,
            but you must keep the matter a secret. If people found it out, they would speak of you
            as an odd child, a strange child, and children would be disagreeable to you, and give
            you nicknames. In this world one must be like everybody else if he doesn't want to
            provoke scorn or envy or jealousy. It is a great and fine distinction which has been
            born to you, and I am glad; but you will keep it a secret, for mamma's sake, won't you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e206">The child promised, without understanding. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e208">All the rest of the day the mother's brain was busy with excited thinkings; with plans,
            projects, schemes, each and all of them uncanny, grim, and dark. Yet they lit up her
            face; lit it with a fell light of their own; lit it with vague fires of hell. She was in
            a fever of unrest; she could not sit, stand, read, sew; there was no relief for her but
            in movement. She tested her boy's gift in twenty ways, and kept saying to herself all
            the time, with her mind in the past: "He broke my father's heart, and night and day all
            these years I have tried, and all in vain, to think out a way to break his. I have found
            it now—I have found it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e210">When night fell, the demon of unrest still possessed her. She went on with her tests;
            with a candle she traversed the house from garret to cellar, hiding pins, needles,
            thimbles, spools, under pillows, under carpets, in cracks in the walls, under the coal
            in the bin; then sent the little fellow in the dark to find them; which he did, and was
            happy and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e212">From this time forward life took on a new complexion for her. She said, "The future is
            secure—I can wait, and enjoy the waiting." The most of her lost interests revived.
            She took up music again, and languages, drawing, painting, and the other long-discarded
            delights of her maidenhood. She was happy once more, and felt again the zest of life. As
            the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy, and was contented with it.
            Not altogether, but nearly that. The soft side of his heart was larger than the other
            side of it. It was his only defect, in her eyes. But she considered that his love for
            her and worship of her made up for it. He was a good hater—that was well; but it
            was a question if the materials of his hatreds were of as tough and enduring a quality
            as those of his friendships—and that was not so well. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e215">The years drifted on. Archy was become a handsome, shapely, athletic youth, courteous,
            dignified, companionable, pleasant in his ways, and looking perhaps a trifle older than
            he was, which was sixteen. One evening his mother said she had something of grave
            importance to say to him, adding that he was old enough to hear it now, and old enough
            and possessed of character enough and stability enough to carry out a stern plan which
            she had been for years contriving and maturing. Then she told him her bitter story, in
            all its naked atrociousness. For a while the boy was paralyzed; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e217">"I understand. We are Southerners; and by our custom and nature there is but one
            atonement. I will search him out and kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e219">"Kill him? No! Death is release, emancipation; death is a favor. Do I owe him favors?
            You must not hurt a hair of his head." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e221">The boy was lost in thought awhile; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e223">"You are all the world to me, and your desire is my law and my pleasure. Tell me what
            to do and I will do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e225">The mother's eyes beamed with satisfaction, and she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e227">"You will go and find him. I have known his hiding-place for eleven years; it cost me
            five years and more of inquiry, and much money, to locate it. He is a quartz-miner in
            Colorado, and well-to-do. He lives in Denver. His name is Jacob Fuller. There—it
            is the first time I have spoken it since that unforgettable night. Think! That name
            could have been yours if I had not saved you that shame and furnished you a cleaner one.
            You will drive him from that place; you will hunt him down and drive him again; and yet
            again, and again, and again, persistently, relentlessly, poisoning his life, filling it
            with mysterious terrors, loading it with weariness and misery, making him wish for
            death, and that he had a suicide's courage; you will make of him another Wandering Jew;
            he shall know no rest any more, no peace of mind, no placid sleep; you shall shadow him,
            cling to him, persecute him, till you break his heart, as he broke my father's and
            mine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e229">"I will obey, mother." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e231">"I believe it, my child. The preparations are all made; everything is ready. Here is a
            letter of credit; spend freely, there is no lack of money. At times you may need
            disguises. I have provided them; also some other conveniences." She took from the drawer
            of the typewriter-table several squares of paper. They all bore these typewritten
            words:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e233"><i>$10,000 REWARD</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e237"><i>It is believed that a certain man who is wanted in an Eastern
                state is sojourning here. In 1880, in the night, he tied his young wife to a tree by
                the public road, cut her across the face with a cowhide, and made his dogs tear her
                clothes from her, leaving her naked. He left her there, and fled the country. A

            night and placard one of these upon the building he occupies, and another one upon the
            post-office or in some other prominent place. It will be the talk of the region. At
            first you must give him several days in which to force a sale of his belongings at
            something approaching their value. We will ruin him by and by, but gradually; we must
            not impoverish him at once, for that could bring him to despair and injure his health,
            possibly kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e244">She took three or four more typewritten forms from the
            drawer—duplicates—and read one:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e246">. . . . . . . . . ., . . . . . . . . . ., 18. . . .</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e249"><i>To Jacob Fuller:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e253"><i>You have . . . . . . days in which to settle your affairs. You

That is sure."</p>Chapter III<p id="TwaDoubd1e275">Extracts from letters to the mother:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e277">DENVER, <i>April 3, 1897</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e282"><i>I have now been living several days in the same hotel with Jacob
                Fuller. I have his scent; I could track him through ten divisions of infantry and
                find him. I have often been near him and heard him talk. He owns a good mine, and
                has a fair income from it; but he is not rich. He learned mining in a good
                way—by working at it for wages. He is a cheerful creature, and his forty-three
                years sit lightly upon him; he could pass for a younger man—say thirty-six or
                thirty-seven. He has never married again—passes himself off for a widower. He
                stands well, is liked, is popular, and has many friends. Even I feel a drawing
                toward him—the paternal blood in me making its claim. How blind and
                unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature—the most of them, in
                fact! My task is become hard now—you realize it? you comprehend, and make
                allowances?—and the fire of it has cooled, more than I like to confess to
                myself, But I will carry it out. Even with the pleasure paled, the duty remains, and
                I will not spare him.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e286"><i>And for my help, a sharp resentment rises in me when I reflect
                that he who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not suffered by it.
                The lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character, and in the change he is
                happy. He, the guilty party, is absolved from all suffering; you, the innocent, are
                borne down with it. But be comforted—he shall harvest his share.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e290">SILVER GULCH, <i>May 19</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e295"><i>I placarded Form No. 1 at midnight of April 3; an hour later I

                item, and saw to it that no other paper got it. And so his paper—the principal
                one in the town—had it in glaring type on the editorial page in the morning,
                followed by a Vesuvian opinion of our wretch a column long, which wound up by adding
                a thousand dollars to our reward on the paper's account! The journals out here know

                all discussing that item, and saying they hoped the seeker would find that rascal
                and remove the pollution of his presence from the town—with a rail, or a
                bullet, or something.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e307"><i>When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leave—folded
                up—in one hand, and the newspaper in the other; and it gave me more than half
                a pang to see him. His cheerfulness was all gone, and he looked old and pinched and
                ashy. And then—only think of the things he had to listen to! Mamma, he heard
                his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and characterizations drawn
                from the very dictionaries and phrase-books of Satan's own authorized editions down
                below. And more than that, he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them. His
                applause tasted bitter in his mouth, though; he could not disguise that from me; and
                it was observable that his appetite was gone; he only nibbled; he couldn't eat.
                Finally a man said:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e311"><i>"It is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing
                what this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel. I hope so."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e316"><i>Ah, dear, it was pitiful the way Fuller winced, and glanced around
                scared! He couldn't endure any more, and got up and left.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e320"><i>During several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in
                Mexico, and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could, and give the
                property his personal attention. He played his cards well; said he would take
                $40,000—a quarter in cash, the rest in safe notes; but that as he greatly
                needed money on account of his new purchase, he would diminish his terms for cash in
                full, He sold out for $30,000. And then, what do you think he did? He asked for
                greenbacks, and took them, saying the man in Mexico was a New-Englander, with a head
                full of crotchets, and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts. People thought it
                queer, since a draft on New York could produce greenbacks quite conveniently. There
                was talk of this odd thing, but only for a day; that is as long as any topic lasts
                in Denver.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e324"><i>I was watching, all the time. As soon as the sale was completed
                and the money paid—which was on the 11th—I began to stick to Fuller's
                track without dropping it for a moment. That night—no, 12th, for it was a
                little past midnight—I tracked him to his room, which was four doors from mine
                in the same hall; then I went back and put on my muddy day-laborer disguise,
                darkened my complexion, and sat down in my room in the gloom, with a gripsack handy,
                with a change in it, and my door ajar. For I suspected that the bird would take wing
                now. In half an hour an old woman passed by, carrying a grip: I caught the familiar
                whiff, and followed with my grip, for it was Fuller. He left the hotel by a side
                entrance, and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three
                blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness, and got into a two-horse hack, which of
                course was waiting for him by appointment. I took a seat (uninvited) on the trunk
                platform behind, and we drove briskly off. We drove ten miles, and the hack stopped
                at a way-station and was discharged. Fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow
                under the awning, as far as he could get from the light; I went inside, and watched
                the ticket-office. Fuller bought no ticket; I bought none. Presently the train came
                along, and he boarded a car; I entered the same car at the other end, and came down
                the aisle and took the seat behind him. When he paid the conductor and named his
                objective point, I dropped back several seats, while the conductor was changing a
                bill, and when he came to me I paid to the same place—about a hundred miles
                westward.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e328"><i>From that time for a week on end he led me a dance. He traveled
                here and there and yonder—always on a general westward trend—but he boas
                not a woman after the first day. He was a laborer, like myself, and wore bushy false
                whiskers. His outfit was perfect, and he could do the character without thinking
                about it, for he had served the trade for wages. His nearest friend could not have
                recognized him. At last he located himself here, the obscurest little mountain camp
                in Montana; he has a shanty, and goes out prospecting daily; is gone all day, and
                avoids society. I am living at a miner's boardinghouse, and it is an awful place:
                the bunks, the food, the dirt—everything.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e332"><i>We have been here four weeks, and in that time I have seen him but
                once; but every night I go over his track and post myself. As soon as he engaged a
                shanty here I went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed that Denver hotel to
                keep my baggage till I should send for it. I need nothing here but a change of army
                shirts, and I brought that with me.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e336">SILVER GULCH, <i>June 12</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e341"><i>The Denver episode has never found its way here, I think. I know
                the most of the men in camp, and they have never referred to it, at least in my
                hearing. Fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions. He has located a
                claim, two miles away, in an out-of-the-way place in the mountains; it promises very
                well, and he is working it diligently. Ah, but the change in him! He never smiles,
                and he keeps quite to himself, consorting with no one—he who was so fond of
                company and so cheery only two months ago. I have seen him passing along several
                times recently—drooping, forlorn, the spring gone from his step, a pathetic
                figure. He calls himself David Wilson.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e345"><i>I can trust him to remain here until we disturb him. Since you
                insist, I will banish him again, but I do not see how he can be unhappier than he

                and edible food, and endurable beds, and bodily decency; then I will fetch my

                than the other one; he came here a young widower in '79, aged twenty-one—a
                year before you were married; and the documents to prove it are innumerable. Last
                night I talked with familiar friends of his who have known him from the day of his
                arrival. I said nothing, but a few days from now I will land him in this town again,
                with the loss upon his mine made good; and there will be a banquet, and a
                torch-light procession, and there will not be any expense on anybody but me. Do you

                to-night, in a wagon—two or three hours of that, then I get a train. I don't

                have not been able to think it out, and I have tried till my brains are addled. "If
                the gentleman who lately bought a mine in Mexico and sold one in Denver will send
                his address to" (to whom, mother!), "it will be explained to him that it was all a
                mistake; his forgiveness will be asked, and full reparation made for a loss which he
                sustained in a certain matter." Do you see? He would think it a trap. Well, any one
                would. If I should say, "It is now known that he was not the man wanted, but another
                man—a man who once bore the same name, but discarded it for good
                reasons"—would that answer? But the Denver people would wake up then and say
                "Oho!" and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks, and say, "Why did he
                run away if he wasn't the right man?—it is too thin." If I failed to find him
                he would be ruined there—there where there is no taint upon him now. You have

                mistake; a dog would have gone the other way. But I am only part dog, and can get
                very humanly stupid when excited. He had been stopping in that house ten days; I
                almost know, now, that he stops long nowhere, the past six or eight months, but is
                restless and has to keep moving. I understand that feeling! and I know what it is to
                feel it. He still uses the name he had registered when I came so near catching him
                nine months ago—"James Walker"; doubtless the same he adopted when he fled
                from Silver Gulch. An unpretending man, and has small taste for fancy names. I
                recognized the hand easily, through its slight disguise. A square man, and not good

                hardly heard; I was there but a moment. I rushed along his trail, and it led me to a

                horizon! I should have saved half on hour if I had gone in the right direction at
                first. I could have taken a fast tug, and should have stood a chance of catching

                Hope Cañon; I traced him to a point thirty miles from here, but there I lost
                the trail; some one gave him a lift in a wagon, I suppose. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e463"><i>I am taking a rest, now—modified by searchings for the lost
                trail. I was tired to death, mother, and low-spirited, and sometimes coming
                uncomfortably near to losing hope; but the miners in this little camp are good
                fellows, and I am used to their sort this long time back; and their breezy ways
                freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles. I have been here a month. I am
                cabining with a young fellow named "Sammy" Hillyer, about twenty-five, the only son
                of his mother—like me—and loves her dearly, and writes to her every
                week—part of which is like me. He is a timid body, and in the matter of
                intellect—well, he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire; but no
                matter, he is well liked; he is good and fine, and it is meat and bread and rest and
                luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again. I wish "James Walker"
                could have it. He had friends; he liked company. That brings up that picture of him,
                the time that I saw him last. The pathos of it! It comes before me often and often.
                At that very time, poor thing, I was girding up my conscience to make him move on
                again!</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e467"><i>Hillyer's heart is better than mine, better than anybody's in the
                community, I suppose, for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the
                camp—Flint Buckner—and the only man Flint ever talks with or allows to
                talk with him. He says he knows Flint's history, and that it is trouble that has
                made him what he is, and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can. Now
                none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a lodger like Flint
                Buckner, from all I hear about him outside. I think that this one detail will give
                you a better idea of Sammy's character than any labored-out description I could
                furnish you of him. In one of our talks he said something about like this: "Flint is
                a kinsman of mine, and he pours out all his troubles to me—empties his breast
                from time to time, or I reckon it would burst. There couldn't be any unhappier man,
                Archy Stillman; his life had been made up of misery of mind—he isn't near as
                old as he looks. He has lost the feel of reposefulness and peace—oh, years and
                years ago! He doesn't know what good luck is—never has had any; often says he
                wishes he was in the other hell, he is so tired of this one."</i></p>Chapter IV<p id="TwaDoubd1e474"><i>No real gentleman will tell the naked truth in the presence of
              ladies.</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e478">It was a crisp and spicy morning in early October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with
            the glory-fires of autumn, hung burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge
            provided by kind Nature for the wingless wild things that have their homes in the
            tree-tops and would visit together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and
            yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the
            sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere;
            far in he empty sky a solitary esophagus[1] slept upon motionless
            wing; everywhere brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e483">October is the time—1900; Hope Cañon is the place, a silver-mining camp
            away down in the Esmeralda region. It is a secluded spot, high and remote; recent as to
            discovery; thought by its occupants to be rich in metal—a year or two's
            prospecting will decide that matter one way or the other. For inhabitants, the camp has
            about two hundred miners, one white woman and child, several Chinese washermen, five
            squaws, and a dozen vagrant buck Indians in rabbit-skin robes, battered plug hats, and
            tin-can necklaces. There are no mills as yet; no church, no newspaper. The camp has
            existed but two years; it has made no big strike; the world is ignorant of its name and
            place. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e485">On both sides of the cañon the mountains rise wall-like, three thousand feet,
            and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the
            sun only once a day, when he sails over at noon. The village is a couple of miles long;
            the cabins stand well apart from each other. The tavern is the only "frame"
            house—the only house, one might say. It occupies a central position, and is the
            evening resort of the population. They drink there, and play seven-up and dominoes; also
            billiards, for there is a table, crossed all over with torn places repaired with
            court-plaster; there are some cues, but no leathers; some chipped balls which clatter
            when they run, and do not slow up gradually, but stop suddenly and sit down; there is a
            part of a cube of chalk, with a projecting jag of flint in it; and the man who can score
            six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bar's expense. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e487">Flint Buckner's cabin was the last one of the village, going south; his silver-claim
            was at the other end of the village, northward, and a little beyond the last hut in that
            direction. He was a sour creature, unsociable, and had no companionships. People who had
            tried to get acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him. His history was not
            known. Some believed that Sammy Hillyer knew it; others said no. If asked, Hillyer said
            no, he was not acquainted with it. Flint had a meek English youth of sixteen or
            seventeen with him, whom he treated roughly, both in public and in private; and of
            course this lad was applied to for information, but with no success. Fetlock
            Jones—name of the youth—said that Flint picked him up on a prospecting
            tramp, and as he had neither home nor friends in America, he had found it wise to stay
            and take Buckner's hard usage for the sake of the salary, which was bacon and beans.
            Further than this he could offer no testimony. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e489">Fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now, and under his meek exterior he was
            slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and humiliations which his master had put
            upon him. For the meek suffer bitterly from these hurts; more bitterly, perhaps, than do
            the manlier sort, who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the limit of
            endurance has been reached. Good-hearted people wanted to help Fetlock out of his
            trouble, and tried to get him to leave Buckner; but the boy showed fright at the
            thought, and said he "dasn't." Pat Riley urged him, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e491">"You leave the damned hunks and come with me; don't you be afraid. I'll take care of
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e496">The boy thanked him with tears in his eyes, but shuddered and said he "dasn't risk it";
            he said Flint would catch him alone, some time, in the night, and then—"Oh, it
            makes me sick, Mr. Riley, to think of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e498">Others said, "Run away from him; we'll stake you; skip out for the coast some night."
            But all these suggestions failed; he said Flint would hunt him down and fetch him back,
            just for meanness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e500">The people could not understand this. The boy's miseries went steadily on, week after
            week. It is quite likely that the people would have understood if they had known how he
            was employing his spare time. He slept in an out-cabin near Flint's; and there, nights,
            he nursed his bruises and his humiliations, and studied and studied over a single
            problem—how he could murder Flint Buckner and not be found out. It was the only
            joy he had in life; these hours were the only ones in the twenty-four which he looked
            forward to with eagerness and spent in happiness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e503">He thought of poison. No—that would not serve; the inquest would reveal where it
            was procured and who had procured it. He thought of a shot in the back in a lonely place
            when Flint would be homeward bound at midnight—his unvarying hour for the trip.
            No—somebody might be near, and catch him. He thought of stabbing him in his sleep.
            No—he might strike an inefficient blow, and Flint would seize him. He examined a
            hundred different ways—none of them would answer; for in even the very obscurest
            and secretest of them there was always the fatal defect of a <i>risk,</i> a chance, a possibility that he might be found out. He would have none of
            that. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e508">But he was patient, endlessly patient. There was no hurry, he said to himself. He would
            never leave Flint till he left him a corpse; there was no hurry—he would find the
            way. It was somewhere, and he would endure shame and pain and misery until he found it.
            Yes, somewhere there was a way which would leave not a trace, not even the faintest clue
            to the murderer—there was no hurry—he would find that way, and
            then—oh, then, it would just be good to be alive! Meantime he would diligently
            keep up his reputation for meekness; and also, as always theretofore, he would allow no
            one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about his oppressor. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e510">Two days before the before-mentioned October morning Flint had bought some things, and
            he and Fetlock had brought them home to Flint's cabin: a fresh box of candles, which
            they put in the corner; a tin can of blasting-powder, which they placed upon the
            candle-box; a keg of blasting-powder, which they placed under Flint's bunk; a huge coil
            of fuse, which they hung on a peg. Fetlock reasoned that Flint's mining operations had
            outgrown the pick, and that blasting was about to begin now. He had seen blasting done,
            and he had a notion of the process, but he had never helped in it. His conjecture was
            right—blasting-time had come. In the morning the pair carried fuse, drills, and
            the powder-can to the shaft; it was now eight feet deep, and to get into it and out of
            it a short ladder was used. They descended, and by command Fetlock held the
            drill—without any instructions as to the right way to hold it—and Flint
            proceeded to strike. The sledge came down; the drill sprang out of Fetlock's hand,
            almost as a matter of course. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e512">"You mangy son of a nigger, is that any way to hold a drill? Pick it up! Stand it up!
            There—hold fast. D— you! <i>I'll</i> teach you!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e517">At the end of an hour the drilling was finished. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e519">"Now, then, charge it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e521">The boy started to pour in the powder. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e523">"Idiot!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e525">A heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e527">"Get up! You can't lie sniveling there. Now, then, stick in the fuse <i>first. Now</i> put in the powder. Hold on, hold on! Are you going to fill the hole
              <i>all</i> up? Of all the sap-headed milksops I—Put in some
            dirt! Put in some gravel! Tamp it down! Hold on, hold on! Oh, great Scott! get out of
            the way!" He snatched the iron and tamped the charge himself, meantime cursing and
            blaspheming like a fiend. Then he fired the fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and ran
            fifty yards away, Fetlock following. They stood waiting a few minutes, then a great
            volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion; after a
            little there was a shower of descending stones; then all was serene again. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e535">"I wish to God you'd been in it!" remarked the master. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e538">They went down the shaft, cleaned it out, drilled another hole, and put in another
            charge. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e540">"Look here! How much fuse are you proposing to waste? Don't you know how to time a
            fuse?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e542">"No, sir." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e544">"You <i>don't!</i> Well, if you don't beat anything <i>I</i> ever saw!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e552">He climbed out of the shaft and spoke down: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e554">"Well, idiot, are you going to be all day? Cut the fuse and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e556">The trembling creature began: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e558">"If you please, sir, I—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e560">"You talk back to <i>me?</i> Cut it and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e565">The boy cut and lit. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e567">"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! I wish you were in—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e570">In his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft and ran. The boy was aghast. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e572">"Oh, my God! Help. Help! Oh, save me!" he implored. "Oh, what can I do! What <i>can</i> I do!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e577">He backed against the wall as tightly as he could; the sputtering fuse frightened the
            voice out of him; his breath stood still; he stood gazing and impotent; in two seconds,
            three seconds, four he would be flying toward the sky torn to fragments. Then he had an
            inspiration. He sprang at the fuse; severed the inch of it that was left above ground,
            and was saved. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e579">He sank down limp and half lifeless with fright, his strength gone; but he muttered
            with a deep joy: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e581">"He has learnt me! I knew there was a way, if I would wait." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e583">After a matter of five minutes Buckner stole to the shaft, looking worried and uneasy,
            and peered down into it. He took in the situation; he saw what had happened. He lowered
            the ladder, and the boy dragged himself weakly up it. He was very white. His appearance
            added something to Buckner's uncomfortable state, and he said, with a show of regret and
            sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from lack of practice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e585">"It was an accident, you know. Don't say anything about it to anybody; I was excited,
            and didn't notice what I was doing. You're not looking well; you've worked enough for
            to-day; go down to my cabin and eat what you want, and rest. It's just an accident, you
            know, on account of my being excited." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e587">"It scared me," said the lad, as he started away; "but I learnt something, so I don't
            mind it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e589">"Damned easy to please!" muttered Buckner, following him with his eye. I wonder if
            he'll tell? Mightn't he?... I wish it <i>had</i> killed him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e594">The boy took no advantage of his holiday in the matter of resting; he employed it in
            work, eager and feverish and happy work. A thick growth of chaparral extended down the
            mountainside clear to Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's labor was done in the dark
            intricacies of that stubborn growth; the rest of it was done in his own shanty. At last
            all was complete, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e596">"If he's got any suspicions that I'm going to tell on him, he won't keep them long,
            to-morrow. He will see that I am the same milksop as I always was—all day and the
            next. And the day after to-morrow night there 'll be an end of him; nobody will ever
            guess who finished him up nor how it was done. He dropped me the idea his own self, and
            that's odd."</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e602"> From the Springfield <i>Republican,</i> April 12, 1902.</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e607">To the Editor of the
                  Republican:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e610"><i>One of your citizens has asked me a
                  question about the "esophagus," and I wish to answer him through you. This in the
                  hope that the answer will get around, and save me some penmanship, for I have
                  already replied to the same question more than several times, and am not getting
                  as much holiday as I ought to have.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e614"><i>I
                  published a short story lately, and it was in that that I put the esophagus. I
                  will say privately that I expected it to bother some people—in fact, that
                  was the intention—but the harvest has been larger than I was calculating
                  upon. The esophagus has gathered in the guilty and the innocent alike, whereas I
                  was only fishing for the innocent—the innocent and confiding. I knew a few
                  of these would write and ask me; that would give me but little trouble; but, I was
                  not expecting that the wise and the learned would call upon me for succor.
                  However, that has happened, and it is time for me to speak up and stop the
                  inquiries if I can, for letter-writing is not restful to me, and I am not having
                  so much fun out of this thing as I counted on. That you may understand the
                  situation, I will insert a couple of sample inquiries. The first is from a public
                  instructor in the Philippines: </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e618">SANTA CRUZ, <i>Ilocos, Sur, P. I. </i><br><i>February 13,
                  1902</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e626"><i>My dear Sir,—I have just been
                  reading the first part of your latest story, entitled "A Double-barreled Detective
                  Story," and am very much delighted with it. In Part IV, page 264,</i> Harper's
                Magazine <i>for January, occurs this passage: "far in the empty sky a
                  solitary 'esophagus' slept upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness,
                  serenity, and the peace of God." Now, there is one word I do not understand,
                  namely, "esophagus." My only work of reference is the</i> Standard Dictionary,
                  <i>but that fails to explain the meaning. If you can spare the
                  time, I would be glad to have the meaning cleared up, as I consider the passage a
                  very touching and beautiful one. It may seem foolish to you, but consider my lack
                  of means away out in the northern part of Luzon.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e636"><i>Yours very truly.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e640"><i>Do you notice?
                  Nothing in the paragraph disturbed him but that one word. It shows that the
                  paragraph was most ably constructed for the deception it was intended to put upon
                  the reader. It was my intention that it should read plausibly, and it is now plain
                  that it does; it was my intention that it should be emotional and touching, and
                  you see, yourself, that it fetched this public instructor. Alas, If I had but left
                  that one treacherous word out, I should have scored! scored everywhere; and the
                  paragraph would have slidden through every reader's sensibilities like oil, and
                  left not a suspicion behind.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e644"><i>The other sample
                  inquiry is from a professor in a New England university. It contains one naughty
                  word (which I cannot bear to suppress), but he is not in the theological
                  department, so it is no harm:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e648"><i>Dear Mr.
                  Clemens: "Far in the empty sky a "solitary esophagus slept upon motionless
                  wing."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e653"><i>It is not often I get a chance to read
                  much periodical literature, but I have just gone through at this belated period,
                  with much gratification and edification, your "Double-barreled Detective
                  Story."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e657"><i>But what in hell is an esophagus? I
                  keep one myself, but it never sleeps in the air or anywhere else. My profession is
                  to deal with words, and esophagus interested me the moment I lighted upon it. But
                  as a companion of my youth used to say, "I'll be eternally, co-eternally cussed"
                  if l can make it out. Is it a joke, or I an ignoramus?</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e661"><i>Between you and me, I was almost ashamed of having fooled that man,
                  but for pride's sake I was not going to say so. I wrote and told him it was a
                  joke—and that is what I am now saying to my Springfield inquirer. And I told
                  him to carefully read the whole paragraph, and he would find not a vestige of
                  sense in any detail of it. This also I commend to my Springfield
                inquirer.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e665"><i>I have confessed. I am
                  sorry—partially. I will not do so any more—for the present. Don't ask
                  me any more questions; let the esophagus have a rest—on his same old

                  appeared in</i> Harper's Magazine <i>for January and February

                  melodramatic passages in which it is difficult to detect the deception, so ably is
                  it done. But the illusion ought not to endure even the first incident in the
                  February number. As for the paragraph which has so admirably illustrated the skill
                  of Mr. Clemens's ensemble and the carelessness of readers, here it
              is:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e688"><i>"It was a crisp and spicy morning in early
                  October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung
                  burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind nature for
                  the wingless wild things that have their home in the tree-tops and would visit
                  together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow flames in
                  brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the sensuous
                  fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere; far
                  in the empty sky a solitary esophagus slept upon motionless wings; everywhere
                  brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e692"><i>The success of Mark Twain's joke recalls to mind his story of the
                  petrified man in the cavern, whom he described most punctiliously, first giving a
                  picture of the scene, its impressive solitude, and all that; then going on to
                  describe the majesty of the figure, casually mentioning that the thumb of his
                  right hand rested against the side of his nose; then after further description
                  observing that the fingers of the right hand were extended in a radiating fashion;
                  and, recurring to the dignified attitude and position of the man, incidentally
                  remarked that the thumb of the left hand was in contact with the little finger of
                  the right—and so on. But was it so ingeniously written that Mark, relating
                  the history years later in an article which appeared in that excellent magazine of
                  the past, the</i> Galaxy, <i>declared that no one ever found out
                  the joke, and, if we remember aright, that that astonishing old mockery was
                  actually looked for in the region where he, as a Nevada newspaper editor, had
                  located it. It is certain that Mark Twain's jumping frog has a good many more
                  "pints" than any other frog.</i></p>Chapter V<p id="TwaDoubd1e702">The next day came and went. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e704">It is now almost midnight, and in five minutes the new morning will begin. The scene is
            in the tavern billiard-room. Rough men in rough clothing, slouch-hats, breeches stuffed
            into boot-tops, some with vests, none with coats, are grouped about the boiler-iron
            stove, which has ruddy cheeks and is distributing a grateful warmth; the billiard-balls
            are clacking; there is no other sound—that is, within; the wind is fitfully
            moaning without. The men look bored; also expectant. A hulking broad-shouldered miner,
            of middle age, with grizzled whiskers, and an unfriendly eye set in an unsociable face,
            rises, slips a coil of fuse upon his arm, gathers up some other personal properties, and
            departs without word or greeting to anybody. It is Flint Buckner. As the door closes
            behind him a buzz of talk breaks out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e706">"The regularest man that ever was," said Jake Parker, the blacksmith: "you can tell
            when it's twelve just by him leaving, without looking at your Waterbury." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e708">"And it's the only virtue he's got, as fur as I know," said Peter Hawes, miner. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e710">"He's just a blight on this society," said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "If I was
            running this shop I'd make him say something, <i>some</i> time or other,
            or vamos the ranch." This with a suggestive glance at the barkeeper, who did not choose
            to see it, since the man under discussion was a good customer, and went home pretty well
            set up, every night, with refreshments furnished from the bar. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e715">"Say," said Ham Sandwich, miner, "does any of you boys ever recollect of him asking you
            to take a drink?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e717"><i>"Him?</i> Flint <i>Buckner?</i> Oh, Laura!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e724">This sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous general outburst in one form of words or
            another from the crowd. After a brief silence, Pat Riley, miner, said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e726">"He's the 15-puzzle, that cuss. And his boy's another one. <i>I
            </i>can't make them out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e731">"Nor anybody else," said Ham Sandwich; "and if they are 15-puzzles how are you going to
            rank up that other one? When it comes to A 1 right-down solid mysteriousness, he lays
            over both of them. <i>Easy—</i>don't he?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e737">"You bet!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e739">Everybody said it. Every man but one. He was the new-comer-Peterson. He ordered the
            drinks all round, and asked who No. 3 might be. All answered at once, "Archy Stillman!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e741">"Is he a mystery?" asked Peterson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e743">"Is <i>he</i> a mystery? Is Archy <i>Stillman a</i>
            mystery?" said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "Why, the fourth dimension's foolishness to
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e754">For Ferguson was learned. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e756">Peterson wanted to hear all about him; everybody wanted to tell him; everybody began.
            But Billy Stevens, the barkeeper, called the house to order, and said one at a time was
            best. He distributed the drinks, and appointed Ferguson to lead. Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e758">"Well, he's a boy. And that is just about all we know about him. You can pump him till
            you are tired; it ain't any use; you won't get anything. At least about his intentions,
            or line of business, or where he's from, and such things as that. And as for getting at
            the nature and get-up of his main big chief mystery, why, he'll just change the subject,
            that's all. You can <i>guess</i> till you're black in the
            face—it's your privilege—but suppose you do, where do you arrive at?
            Nowhere, as near as I can make out," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e763">"What <i>is</i> his big chief one?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e768">"Sight, maybe. Hearing, maybe. Instinct, maybe. Magic, maybe. Take your
            choice—grownups, twenty-five; children and servants, half price. Now I'll tell you
            what he can do. You can start here, and just disappear; you can go and hide wherever you
            want to, I don't care where it is, nor how far—and he'll go straight and put his
            finger on you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e770">"You don't mean it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e772">"I just do, though. Weather's nothing to him—elemental conditions is nothing to
            him—he don't even take notice of them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e775">"Oh, come! Dark? Rain? Snow? Hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e777">"It's all the same to <i>him.</i> He don't give a damn." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e782">"Oh, <i>say—</i>including <i>fog,</i> per'aps?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e790"><i>"Fog!</i> he's got an eye 't can plunk through it like a bullet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e794">"Now, boys, honor bright, what's he giving me?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e796">"It's a fact!" they all shouted. "Go on, Wells-Fargo." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e798">"Well, sir, you can leave him here, chatting with the boys, and you can slip out and go
            to any cabin in this camp and open a book—yes, sir, a dozen of them—and take
            the page in your memory, and he'll start out and go straight to that cabin and open
            every one of them books at the right page, and call it off, and never make a mistake." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e800">"He must be the devil!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e802">"More than one has thought it. Now I'll tell you a perfectly wonderful thing that he
            done. The other night he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e804">There was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside, the door flew open, and an excited
            crowd burst in, with the camp's one white woman in the lead and crying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e806">"My child! my child! she's lost and gone! For the love of God help me to find Archy
            Stillman; we've hunted everywhere!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e809">Said the barkeeper: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e811">"Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, and don't worry. He asked for a bed three hours ago,
            tuckered out tramping the trails the way he's always doing, and went up-stairs. Ham
            Sandwich, run up and roust him out; he's in No. 14." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e813">The youth was soon down-stairs and ready. He asked Mrs. Hogan for particulars. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e815">"Bless you, dear, there ain't any; I wish there was. I put her to sleep at seven in the
            evening, and when I went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself, she was gone. I
            rushed for your cabin, dear, and you wasn't there, and I've hunted for you ever since,
            at every cabin down the gulch, and now I've come up again, and I'm that distracted and
            scared and heartbroke; but, thanks to God, I've found you at last, dear heart, and
            you'll find my child. Come on! come quick!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e817">"Move right along; I'm with you, madam. Go to your cabin first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e819">The whole company streamed out to join the hunt. All the southern half of the village
            was up, a hundred men strong, and waiting outside, a vague dark mass sprinkled with
            twinkling lanterns. The mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself
            to the narrow road, and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders. In a
            few minutes the Hogan cabin was reached. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e821">"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Hogan; "there's where she was; it's where I laid her at
            seven o'clock; but where she is now, God only knows." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e823">"Hand me a lantern," said Archy. He set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it,
            pretending to examine the ground closely. "Here's her track," he said, touching the
            ground here and there and yonder with his finger. "Do you see?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e825">Several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see. One or two
            thought they discerned something like a track; the others shook their heads and
            confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp
            enough to discover. One said, "Maybe a child's foot could make a mark on it, but <i>I</i> don't see how." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e830">Young Stillman stepped outside, held the light to the ground, turned leftward, and
            moved three steps, closely examining; then said, "I've got the direction—come
            along; take the lantern, somebody." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e832">He strode off swiftly southward, the files following, swaying and bending in and out
            with the deep curves of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the mouth of the gorge was reached;
            before them stretched the sagebrush plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman called a halt,
            saying, "We mustn't start wrong, now; we must take the direction again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e835">He took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards; then said,
            "Come on; it's all right," and gave up the lantern. In and out among the sage-bushes he
            marched, a quarter of a mile, bearing gradually to the right; then took a new direction
            and made another great semicircle; then changed again and moved due west nearly half a
            mile—and stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e837">"She gave it up, here, poor little chap. Hold the lantern. You can see where she sat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e839">But this was in a slick alkali flat which was surfaced like steel, and no person in the
            party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a
            cushion on a veneer like that. The bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the
            spot, lamenting. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e841">"But where is she, then?" some one said. "She didn't stay here. We can see <i>that</i> much, anyway." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e846">Stillman moved about in a circle around the place, with the lantern, pretending to hunt
            for tracks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e848">"Well!" he said presently, in an annoyed tone, "I don't understand it." He examined
            again. "No use. She was here—that's certain; she never <i>walked</i> away from here—and that's certain. It's a puzzle; I can't make it
            out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e853">The mother lost heart then. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e855">"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! some flying beast has got her. I'll never see her
            again!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e857">"Ah, <i>don't</i> give up," said Archy. "We'll find her—don't
            give up." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e862">"God bless you for the words, Archy Stillman!" and she seized his hand and kissed it
            fervently. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e864">Peterson, the new-comer, whispered satirically in Ferguson's ear: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e867">"Wonderful performance to find this place, wasn't it? Hardly worth while to come so
            far, though; any other supposititious place would have answered just as well—hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e869">Ferguson was not pleased with the innuendo. He said, with some warmth: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e871">"Do you mean to insinuate that the child hasn't been here? I tell you the child <i>has</i> been here! Now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a
            little fuss as—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e876">"All right!" sang out Stillman. "Come, everybody, and look at this! It was right under
            our noses all the time, and we didn't see it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e878">There was a general plunge for the ground at the place where the child was alleged to
            have rested, and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to see the thing that Archy's finger
            was resting upon. There was a pause, then a several-barreled sigh of disappointment. Pat
            Riley and Ham Sandwich said, in the one breath: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e880">"What is it, Archy? There's nothing here." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e882">"Nothing? Do you call <i>that</i> nothing?" and he swiftly traced upon
            the ground a form with his finger. "There—don't you recognize it now? It's Injun
            Billy's track. He's got the child." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e887">"God be praised !" from the mother. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e889">"Take away the lantern. I've got the direction. Follow!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e891">He started on a run, racing in and out among the sage-bushes a matter of three hundred
            yards, and disappeared over a sand-wave; the others struggled after him, caught him up,
            and found him waiting. Ten steps away was a little wickiup, a dim and formless shelter
            of rags and old horse-blankets, a dull light showing through its chinks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e893">"You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the lad. "It's your privilege to be first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e896">All followed the sprint she made for the wickiup, and saw, with her, the picture its
            interior afforded. Injun Billy was sitting on the ground; the child was asleep beside
            him. The mother hugged it with a wild embrace, which included Archy Stillman, the
            grateful tears running down her face, and in a choked and broken voice she poured out a
            golden stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments which has its home in full
            richness nowhere but in the Irish heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e898">"I find her bymeby it is ten o'clock," Billy explained. "She 'sleep out yonder, ve'y
            tired—face wet, been cryin', 'spose; fetch her home, feed her, she heap much
            hungry—go 'sleep 'gin." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e900">In her limitless gratitude the happy mother waived rank and hugged him too, calling him
            "the angel of God in disguise." And he probably was in disguise if he was that kind of
            an official. He was dressed for the character. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e902">At half past one in the morning the procession burst into the village singing, "When
            Johnny Comes Marching Home," waving its lanterns and swallowing the drinks that were
            brought out all along its course. It concentrated at the tavern, and made a night of
            what was left of the morning.</p>Chapter VI<p id="TwaDoubd1e907">The next afternoon the village was electrified with an immense sensation. A grave and
            dignified foreigner of distinguished bearing and appearance had arrived at the tavern,
            and entered this formidable name upon the register: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e909">SHERLOCK HOLMES
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e913">The news buzzed from cabin to cabin, from claim to claim; tools were dropped, and the
            town swarmed toward the center of interest. A man passing out at the northern end of the
            village shouted it to Pat Riley, whose claim was the next one to Flint Buckner's. At
            that time Fetlock Jones seemed to turn sick. He muttered to himself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e915">"Uncle <i>Sherlock!</i> The mean luck of it!—that <i>he </i>should come just when..." He dropped into a reverie, and
            presently said to himself: "But what's the use of being afraid of <i>him?
            </i>Anybody that knows him the way I do knows he can't detect a crime except where he
            plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and hires some fellow to commit it
            according to instructions.... Now there ain't going to <i>be</i> any
            clues this time—so, what show has he got? None at all. No, sir; everything's
            ready. If I was to risk putting it off—...No, I won't run any risk like that.
            Flint Buckner goes out of this world to-night, for sure." Then another trouble presented
            itself. "Uncle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening, and
            how am I going to get rid of him? for I've <i>got</i> to be at my cabin
            a minute or two about eight o'clock." This was an awkward matter, and cost him much
            thought. But he found a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll go for a walk, and I'll leave
            him in the road a minute, so that he won't see what it is I do: the best way to throw a
            detective off the track, anyway, is to have him along when you are preparing the thing.
            Yes, that's the safest—I'll take him with me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e932">Meantime the road in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping
            for a glimpse of the great man. But he kept his room, and did not appear. None but
            Ferguson, Jake Parker the blacksmith, and Ham Sandwich had any luck. These enthusiastic
            admirers of the great scientific detective hired the tavern's detained-baggage lockup,
            which looked into the detective's room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide,
            ambushed themselves in it, and cut some peep-holes in the window-blind. Mr. Holmes's
            blinds were down; but by and by he raised them. It gave the spies a hair-lifting but
            pleasurable thrill to find themselves face to face with the Extraordinary Man who had
            filled the world with the fame of his more than human ingenuities. There he
            sat—not a myth, not a shadow, but real, alive, compact of substance, and almost
            within touching distance with the hand. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e934">"Look at that head!" said Ferguson, in an awed voice. "By gracious! <i>that's</i> a head!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e939">"You bet!" said the blacksmith, with deep reverence. "Look at his nose! look at his
            eyes! Intellect? Just a battery of it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e941">"And that paleness," said Ham Sandwich. "Comes from thought—that's what it comes
            from. Hell! duffers like us don't know what real thought <i>is."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e946">"No more we don't," said Ferguson. "What we take for thinking is just
            blubber-and-slush," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e948">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo. And look at that frown—that's <i>deep</i> thinking—away down, down, forty fathom into the bowels of things.
            He's on the track of something." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e954">"Well, he is, and don't you forget it. Say—look at that awful gravity—look
            at that pallid solemness—there ain't any corpse can lay over it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e956">"No, sir, not for dollars! And it's his'n by hereditary rights, too; he's been dead
            four times a'ready, and there's history for it. Three times natural, once by accident.
            I've heard say he smells damp and cold, like a grave. And he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e958">" 'Sh! Watch him! There—he's got his thumb on the bump on the near corner of his
            forehead, and his forefinger on the off one. His think-works is just a-<i>grinding</i> now, you bet your other shirt." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e963">"That's so. And now he's gazing up toward heaven and stroking his mustache slow,
            and—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e965">"Now he has rose up standing, and is putting his clues together on his left fingers
            with his right finger. See? he touches the forefinger—now middle finger—now
            ring-finger—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e967">"Stuck!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e969">"Look at him scowl! He can't seem to make out <i>that</i> clue. So
            he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e974">"See him smile!—like a tiger—and tally off the other fingers like nothing!
            He's got it, boys; he's got it sure!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e976">"Well, I should <i>say!</i> I'd hate to be in that man's place that
            he's after." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e981">Mr. Holmes drew a table to the window, sat down with his back to the spies, and
            proceeded to write. The spies withdrew their eyes from the peep-holes, lit their pipes,
            and settled themselves for a comfortable smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with conviction: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e983">"Boys, it's no use talking, he's a wonder! He's got the signs of it all over him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e986">"You hain't ever said a truer word than that, Wells-Fargo," said Jake Parker. "Say,
            wouldn't it 'a' been nuts if he'd a-been here last night?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e988">"Oh, by George, but wouldn't it!" said Ferguson. "Then we'd have seen <i>scientific</i> work. Intellect—just pure intellect—away up on the upper
            levels, dontchuknow. Archy is all right, and it don't become anybody to belittle <i>him,</i> I can tell you. But his gift is only just eyesight, sharp as
            an owl's, as near as I can make it out just a grand natural animal talent, no more, no
            less, and prime as far as it goes, but no intellect in it, and for awfulness and
            marvelousness no more to be compared to what this man does than—than—Why,
            let me tell you what <i>he'd</i> have done. He'd have stepped over to
            Hogan's and glanced—just <i>glanced,</i> that's all—at the
            premises, and that's enough. See everything? Yes, sir, to the last little detail; and
            he'll know more about that place than the Hogans would know in seven years. Next, he
            would sit down on the bunk, just as ca'm, and say to Mrs. Hogan—<i>Say,</i> Ham, consider that you are Mrs. Hogan. I'll ask the questions; you answer
            them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1005">"All right; go on." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1007">" 'Madam, if you please—attention—do not let your mind wander. Now,
            then—sex of the child?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1009">" 'Female, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1011">" 'Um—female. Very good, very good. Age?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1013">" 'Turned six, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1015">" 'Um—young, weak—two miles. Weariness will overtake it then. It will sink
            down and sleep. We shall find it two miles away, or less. Teeth?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1017">" 'Five, your Honor, and one a-coming.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1019">" 'Very good, very good, <i>very</i> good, indeed.' You see, boys, <i>he</i> knows a clue when he sees it, when it wouldn't mean a dern thing
            to anybody else. 'Stockings, madam? Shoes?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1027">" 'Yes, your Honor—both.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1030">" 'Yarn, perhaps? Morocco?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1032">" 'Yarn, your Honor. And kip.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1034">" 'Um—kip. This complicates the matter. However, let it go—we shall manage.
            Religion?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1036">" 'Catholic, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1038">" 'Very good. Snip me a bit from the bed blanket, please. Ah, thanks. Part
            wool—foreign make. Very well. A snip from some garment of the child's, please.
            Thanks. Cotton. Shows wear. An excellent clue, excellent. Pass me a pallet of the floor
            dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, many thanks. Ah, admirable, admirable! <i>Now</i> we know where we are, I think.' You see, boys, he's got all the
            clues he wants now; he don't need anything more. Now, then, what does this Extraordinary
            Man do? He lays those snips and that dirt out on the table and leans over them on his
            elbows, and puts them together side by side and studies them—mumbles to himself,
            'Female'; changes them around—mumbles, 'Six years old'; changes them this way and
            that—again mumbles: 'Five teeth—one
            a-coming—Catholic—yarn—cotton—kip—damn that kip.' Then he
            straightens up and gazes toward heaven, and plows his hands through his hair—plows
            and plows, muttering, 'Damn that kip!' Then he stands up and frowns, and begins to tally
            off his clues on his fingers—and gets stuck at the ring-finger. But only just a
            minute—then his face glares all up in a smile like a house afire, and he
            straightens up stately and majestic, and says to the crowd, 'Take a lantern, a couple of
            you, and go down to Injun Billy's and fetch the child—the rest of you go 'long
            home to bed; good-night, madam; good-night, gents.' And he bows like the Matterhorn, and
            pulls out for the tavern. That's <i>his</i> style, and the <i>Only—</i>scientific, intellectual—all over in fifteen
            minutes—no poking around all over the sage-brush range an hour and a half in a
            mass-meeting crowd for <i>him,</i> boys—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1055">"By Jackson, it's grand!" said Ham Sandwich. "Wells-Fargo, you've got him down to a
            dot. He ain't painted up any exacter to the life in the books. By George, I can juse <i>see</i> him—can't you, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1060">"You bet you! It's just a photograft, that's what it is." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1062">Ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success, and grateful. He sat silently
            enjoying his happiness a little while, then he murmured, with a deep awe in his voice, </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1064">"I wonder if God made him?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1066">There was no response for a moment; then Ham Sandwich said, reverently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1068">"Not all at one time, I reckon."</p>Chapter VII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1073">At eight o'clock that evening two persons were groping their way past Flint Buckner's
            cabin in the frosty gloom. They were Sherlock Holmes and his nephew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1075">"Stop here in the road a moment, uncle," said Fetlock, "while I run to my cabin; I
            won't be gone a minute." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1077">He asked for something—the uncle furnished it—then he disappeared in the
            darkness, but soon returned, and the talking-walk was resumed. By nine o'clock they had
            wandered back to the tavern. They worked their way through the billiard-room, where a
            crowd had gathered in the hope of getting a glimpse of the Extraordinary Man. A royal
            cheer was raised. Mr. Holmes acknowledged the compliment with a series of courtly bows,
            and as he was passing out his nephew said to the assemblage: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1079">"Uncle Sherlock's got some work to do, gentlemen, that 'll keep him till twelve or one;
            but he'll be down again then, or earlier if he can, and hopes some of you'll be left to
            take a drink with him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1081">"By George, he's just a duke, boys! Three cheers for Sherlock Holmes, the greatest man
            that ever lived!" shouted Ferguson. "Hip, hip, hip—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1083">"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Tiger!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1085">The uproar shook the building, so hearty was the feeling the boys put into their
            welcome. Up-stairs the uncle reproached the nephew gently, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1087">"What did you get me into that engagement for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1089">"I reckon you don't want to be unpopular, do you, uncle? Well, then, don't you put on
            any exclusiveness in a mining-camp, that's all. The boys admire you; but if you was to
            leave without taking a drink with them, they'd set you down for a snob. And besides, you
            said you had home talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1091">The boy was right, and wise—the uncle acknowledged it. The boy was wise in
            another detail which he did not mention—except to himself: "Uncle and the others
            will come handy—in the way of nailing an <i>alibi </i>where it
            can't be budged." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1097">He and his uncle talked diligently about three hours. Then, about midnight, Fetlock
            stepped down-stairs and took a position in the dark a dozen steps from the tavern, and
            waited. Five minutes later Flint Buckner came rocking out of the billiard-room and
            almost brushed him as he passed. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1099">"I've <i>got</i> him!" muttered the boy. He continued to himself,
            looking after the shadowy form: "Good-by—good-by for good, Flint Buckner; you
            called my mother a—well, never mind what: it's all right, now; you're taking your
            last walk, friend." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1104">He went musing back into the tavern. "From now till one is an hour. We'll spend it with
            the boys; it's good for the <i>alibi."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1109">He brought Sherlock Holmes to the billiard-room, which was jammed with eager and
            admiring miners; the guest called the drinks, and the fun began. Everybody was happy;
            everybody was complimentary; the ice was soon broken, songs, anecdotes, and more drinks
            followed, and the pregnant minutes flew. At six minutes to one, when the jollity was at
            its highest— </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1111"><i>Boom!</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1115">There was silence instantly. The deep sound came rolling and rumbling frown peak to
            peak up the gorge, then died down, and ceased. The spell broke, then, and the men made a
            rush for the door, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1117">"Something's blown up!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1119">Outside, a voice in the darkness said, "It's away down the gorge; I saw the flash." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1121">The crowd poured down the cañon—Holmes, Fetlock, Archy Stillman,
            everybody. They made the mile in a few minutes. By the light of a lantern they found the
            smooth and solid dirt floor of Flint Buckner's cabin; of the cabin itself not a vestige
            remained, not a rag nor a splinter. Nor any sign of Flint. Search-parties sought here
            and there and yonder, and presently a cry went up. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1123">"Here he is!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1125">It was true. Fifty yards down the gulch they had found him—that is, they had
            found a crushed and lifeless mass which represented him. Fetlock Jones hurried thither
            with the others and looked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1128">The inquest was a fifteen-minute affair. Ham Sandwich, foreman of the jury, handed up
            the verdict, which was phrased with a certain unstudied literary grace, and closed with
            this finding, to wit: that "deceased came to his death by his own act or some other
            person or persons unknown to this jury not leaving any family or similar effects behind
            but his cabin which was blown away and God have mercy on his soul amen." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1130">Then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd, for the storm-center of interest was
            there—Sherlock Holmes. The miners stood silent and reverent in a half-circle,
            inclosing a large vacant space which included the front exposure of the site of the late
            premises. In this considerable space the Extraordinary Man was moving about, attended by
            his nephew with a lantern. With a tape he took measurements of the cabin site; of the
            distance from the wall of chaparral to the road; of the height of the chaparral bushes;
            also various other measurements. He gathered a rag here, a splinter there, and a pinch
            of earth yonder, inspected them profoundly, and preserved them. He took the "lay" of the
            place with a pocket-compass, allowing two seconds for magnetic variation. He took the
            time (Pacific) by his watch, correcting it for local time. He paced off the distance
            from the cabin site to the corpse, and corrected that for tidal differentiation. He took
            the altitude with a pocket-aneroid, and the temperature with a pocket-thermometer.
            Finally he said, with a stately bow: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1132">"It is finished. Shall we return, gentlemen?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1134">He took up the line of march for the tavern, and the crowd fell into his wake,
            earnestly discussing and admiring the Extraordinary Man, and interlarding guesses as to
            the origin of the tragedy and who the author of it might he. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1136">"My, but it's grand luck having him here—hey, boys?" said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1138">"It's the biggest thing of the century," said Ham Sandwich. "It 'll go all over the
            world; you mark my words." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1140"><i>"You</i> bet!" said Jake Parker, the blacksmith. "It 'll boom this
            camp. Ain't it so, Wells-Fargo?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1144">"Well, as you want my opinion—if it's any sign of how <i>I
            </i>think about it, I can tell you this: yesterday I was holding the Straight Flush
            claim at two dollars a foot; I'd like to see the man that can get it at sixteen to-day." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1149">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo! It's the grandest luck a new camp ever struck. Say, did
            you see him collar them little rags and dirt and things? What an eye! He just can't
            overlook a clue—'tain't <i>in </i>him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1154">"That's so. And they wouldn't mean a thing to anybody else; but to him, why, they're
            just a book—large print at that." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1156">"Sure's you're born! Them odds and ends have got their little old secret, and they
            think there ain't anybody can pull it; but, land! when he sets his grip there they've
            got to squeal, and don't you forget it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1159">"Boys, I ain't sorry, now, that he wasn't here to roust out the child; this is a bigger
            thing, by a long sight. Yes, sir, and more tangled up and scientific and intellectual." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1161">"I reckon we're all of us glad it's turned out this way. Glad? 'George! it ain't any
            name for it. Dontchuknow, Archy could 've <i>learnt</i> something if
            he'd had the nous to stand by and take notice of how that man works the system. But no;
            he went poking up into the chaparral and just missed the whole thing." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1166">"It's true as gospel; I seen it myself. Well, Archy's young. He'll know better one of
            these days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1168">"Say, boys, who do you reckon done it?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1170">That was a difficult question, and brought out a world of unsatisfying conjecture.
            Various men were mentioned as possibilities, but one by one they were discarded as not
            being eligible. No one but young Hillyer had been intimate with Flint Buckner; no one
            had really had a quarrel with him; he had affronted every man who had tried to make up
            to him, although not quite offensively enough to require bloodshed. There was one name
            that was upon every tongue from the start, but it <i>was</i> the last to
            get utterance—Fetlock Jones's. It was Pat Riley that mentioned it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1175">"Oh, well," the boys said, "of course we've all thought of him, because he had a
            million rights to kill Flint Buckner, and it was just his plain duty to do it. But all
            the same there's two things we can't get around: for one thing, he hasn't got the sand;
            and for another, he wasn't anywhere near the place when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1177">"I know it," said Pat. "He was there in the billiard-room with us when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1179">"Yes, and was there all the time for an hour <i>before</i> it
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1184">"It's so. And lucky for him, too. He'd have been suspected in a minute if it hadn't
            been for that."</p>Chapter VIII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1189">The tavern dining-room had been cleared of all its furniture save one six-foot pine
            table and a chair. This table was against one end of the room; the chair was on it;
            Sherlock Holmes, stately, imposing, impressive, sat in the chair. The public stood. The
            room was full. The tobacco-smoke was dense, the stillness profound. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1191">The Extraordinary Man raised his hand to command additional silence; held it in the air
            a few moments; then, in brief, crisp terms he put forward question after question, and
            noted the answers with "Um-ums," nods of the head, and so on. By this process he learned
            all about Flint Buckner, his character, conduct, and habits, that the people were able
            to tell him. It thus transpired that the Extraordinary Man's nephew was the only person
            in the camp who had a killing-grudge against Flint Buckner. Mr. Holmes smiled
            compassionately upon the witness, and asked, languidly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1193">"Do any of you gentlemen chance to know where the lad Fetlock Jones was at the time of
            the explosion?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1195">A thunderous response followed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1197">"In the billiard-room of this house!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1199">"Ah. And had he just come in?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1201">"Been there all of an hour!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1203">"Ah. It is about—about—well, about how far might it be to the scene of the
            explosions" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1205">"All of a mile!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1207">"Ah. It isn't <i>much</i> of an alibi, 'tis true, but—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1213">A storm-burst of laughter, mingled with shouts of "By jiminy, but he's
            chain-lightning!" and "Ain't you sorry you spoke, Sandy?" shut off the rest of the
            sentence, and the crushed witness drooped his blushing face in pathetic shame. The
            inquisitor resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1215">"The lad Jones's somewhat <i>distant</i> connection with the case"
              (laughter<i>) "</i>having been disposed of, let us now call the
            eye-witnesses of the tragedy, and listen to what they have to say." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1223">He got out his fragmentary clues and arranged them on a sheet of cardboard on his knee.
            The house held its breath and watched. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1225">"We have the longitude and the latitude, corrected for magnetic variation, and this
            gives us the exact location of the tragedy. We have the altitude, the temperature, and
            the degree of humidity prevailing—inestimably valuable, since they enable us to
            estimate with precision the degree of influence which they would exercise upon the mood
            and disposition of the assassin at that time of the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1227"><i>(Buzz of admiration; muttered remark, "By George, but he's
              deep.")</i> He fingered his clues. "And now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak
            to us. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1231">"Here we have an empty linen shot-bag. What is its message? This: that robbery was the
            motive, not revenge. What is its further message? This: that the assassin was of
            inferior intelligence—shall we say light-witted, or perhaps approaching that? How
            do we know this? Because a person of sound intelligence would not have proposed to rob
            the man Buckner, who never had much money with him. But the assassin might have been a
            stranger? Let the bag speak again. I take from it this article. It is a bit of
            silver-bearing quartz. It is peculiar. Examine it, please—you—and
            you—and you. Now pass it back, please. There is but one lode on this coast which
            produces just that character and color of quartz; and that is a lode which crops out for
            nearly two miles on a stretch, and in my opinion is destined, at no distant day, to
            confer upon its locality a globe-girdling celebrity, and upon its two hundred owners
            riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Name that lode, please." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1233">"The Consolidated Christian Science and Mary Ann!" was the prompt response. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1235">A wild crash of hurrahs followed, and every man reached for his neighbor's hand and
            wrung it, with tears in his eyes; and Wells-Fargo Ferguson shouted, "The Straight Flush
            is on the lode, and up she goes to a hunched and fifty a foot—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1240">When quiet fell, Mr. Holmes resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1242">"We perceive, then, that three facts are established, to wit: the assassin was
            approximately light-witted; he was not a stranger; his motive was robbery, not revenge.
            Let us proceed. I hold in my hand a small fragment of fuse, with the recent smell of
            fire upon it. What is its testimony? Taken with the corroborative evidence of the
            quartz, it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner. What does it tell us further?
            This, gentlemen: that the assassination was consummated by means of an explosive. What
            else does it say? This: that the explosive was located against the side of the cabin
            nearest the road—the front side—for within six feet of that spot I found it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1244">"I hold in my fingers a burnt Swedish match—the kind one rubs on a safety-box. I
            found it in the road, six hundred and twenty-two feet from the abolished cabin. What
            does it say? This: that the train was fired from that point. What further does it tell
            us? This: that the assassin was left-handed. How do I know this? I should not be able to
            explain to you, gentlemen, how I know it, the signs being so subtle that only long
            experience and deep study can enable one to detect them. But the signs are here, and
            they are reinforced by a fact which you must have often noticed in the great detective
            narratives—that <i>all </i>assassins are left-handed." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1250">"By Jackson, <i>that's</i> so." said Ham Sandwich, bringing his great
            hand down with a resounding slap upon his thigh; "blamed if I ever thought of it
            before." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1255">"Nor I!" "Nor I!" cried several. "Oh, there can't anything escape <i>him—</i>look at his eye!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1260">"Gentlemen, distant as the murderer was from his doomed victim, he did not wholly
            escape injury. This fragment of wood which I now exhibit to you struck him. It drew
            blood. Wherever he is, he bears the telltale mark. I picked it up where he stood when he
            fired the fatal train," He looked out over the house from his high perch, and his
            countenance began to darken; he slowly raised his hand, and pointed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1262">"There stands the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1264">For a moment the house was paralyzed with amazement; then twenty voices burst out with: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1266">"Sammy Hillyer? Oh, <i>hell,</i> no! <i>Him?</i> It's
            pure foolishness!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1274">"Take care, gentlemen—be not hasty. Observe—he has the blood-mark on his
            brow." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1276">Hillyer turned white with fright. He was near to crying. He turned this way and that,
            appealing to every face for help and sympathy; and held out his supplicating hands
            toward Holmes and began to plead: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1278"><i>"Don't,</i> oh, don't! I never did it; I give my word I never did
            it. The way I got this hurt on my forehead was—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1282">"Arrest him, constable!" cried Holmes. "I will swear out the warrant" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1284">The constable moved reluctantly forward—hesitated—stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1287">Hillyer broke out with another appeal. "Oh, Archy, don't let them do it; it would kill
            mother! <i>You</i> know how I got the hurt. Tell them, and save me,
            Archy; save me!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1292">Stillman worked his way to the front, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1294">"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be afraid." Then he said to the house, "Never mind how he
            got the hurt; it hasn't anything to do with this case, and isn't of any consequence." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1296">"God bless you, Archy, for a true friend!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1298">"Hurrah for Archy! Go in, boy, and play 'em a knock-down flush to their two pair 'n' a
            jack!" shouted the house, pride in their home talent and a patriotic sentiment of
            loyalty to it rising suddenly in the public heart and changing the whole attitude of the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1300">Young Stillman waited for the noise to cease; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1302">"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand by that door yonder, and Constable Harris to stand by
            the other one here, and not let anybody leave the room. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1304">"Said and done. Go on, old man!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1306">"The criminal is present, I believe. I will show him to you before long, in case I am
            right in my guess. Now I will tell you all about the tragedy, from start to finish. The
            motive <i>wasn't </i>robbery; it was revenge. The murderer <i>wasn't</i> light-witted. He <i>didn't</i> stand six
            hundred and twenty-two feet away. He <i>didn't </i>get hit with a piece
            of wood. He <i>didn't</i> place the explosive against the cabin. He <i>didn't</i> bring a shot-bag with him, and he <i>wasn't</i> left-handed. With the exception of these errors, the distinguished
            guest's statement of the case is substantially correct." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1330">A comfortable laugh rippled over the house; friend nodded to friend, as much as to say,
            "That's the word, with the bark <i>on</i> it. Good lad, good boy. <i>He</i> ain't lowering his flag any!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1338">The guest's serenity was not disturbed. Stillman resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1341">"I also have some witnesses; and I will presently tell you where you can find some
            more." He held up a piece of coarse wire; the crowd craned their necks to see. "It has a
            smooth coating of melted tallow on it. And here is a candle which is burned half-way
            down. The remaining half of it has marks cut upon it an inch apart. Soon I will tell you
            where I found these things. I will now put aside reasonings, guesses, the impressive
            hitchings of odds and ends of clues together, and the other showy theatricals of the
            detective trade, and tell you in a plain, straightforward way just how this dismal thing
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1343">He paused a moment, for effect—to allow silence and suspense to intensify and
            concentrate the house's interest; then he went on: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1345">"The assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains. It was a good plan, very
            ingenious, and showed an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. It was a plan which was
            well calculated to ward off all suspicion from its inventor. In the <i>first</i> place, he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart, and lit it and timed
            it. He found it took three hours to burn four inches of it. I tried it myself for half
            an hour, awhile ago, up-stairs here, while the inquiry into Flint Buckner's character
            and ways was being conducted in this room, and I arrived in that way at the rate of a
            candle's consumption when sheltered from the wind. Having proved his trial candle's
            rate, he blew it out—I have already shown it to you—and put <i>his</i> inch-marks on a fresh one. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1353">"He put the fresh one into a tin candlestick. Then at the five-hour mark he bored a
            hole through the candle with a red-hot wire. I have already shown you the wire, with a
            smooth coat of tallow on it—tallow that had been melted and had cooled. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1355">"With labor—very hard labor, I should say—he struggled up through the stiff
            chaparral that clothes the steep hillside back of Flint Buckner's place, tugging an
            empty flour-barrel with him. He placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place, and in
            the bottom of it he set the candlestick. Then he measured off about thirty-five feet of
            fuse—the barrel's distance from the back of the cabin. He bored a hole in the side
            of the barrel—here is the large gimlet he did it with. He went on and finished his
            work; and when it was done, one end of the fuse was in Buckner's cabin, and the other
            end, with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder, was in the hole in the
            candle—timed to blow the place up at one o'clock this morning, provided the candle
            was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening—which I am betting it was—and
            provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the
            fuse—which I am also betting there was, though I can't prove it. Boys, the barrel
            is there in the chaparral, the candle's remains are in it in the tin stick; the
            burnt-out fuse is in the gimlet-hole, the other end is down the hill where the late
            cabin stood. I saw them all an hour or two ago, when the Professor here was measuring
            off unimplicated vacancies and collecting relics that hadn't anything to do with the
            case." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1357">He paused. The house drew a long, deep breath, shook its strained cords and muscles
            free and burst into cheers. "Dang him!" said Ham Sandwich, "that's why he was snooping
            around in the chaparral, instead of picking up points out of the P'fessor's game. Looky
            here—he ain't no fool, boys." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1359">"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1361">But Stillman was resuming: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1363">"While we were out yonder an hour or two ago, the owner of the gimlet and the trial
            candle took them from a place where he had concealed them—it was not a good
            place—and carried them to what he probably thought was a better one, two hundred
            yards up in the pine woods, and hid them there, covering them over with pine needles. It
            was there that I found them. The gimlet exactly fits the hole in the barrel. And
            now—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1365">The Extraordinary Man interrupted him. He said, sarcastically: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1367">"We have had a very pretty fairy tale, gentlemen—very pretty indeed. Now I would
            like to ask this young man a question or two." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1370">Some of the boys winced, and Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1372">"I'm afraid Archy's going to catch it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1374">The others lost their smiles and sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1376">"Let us proceed to examine into this fairy tale in a consecutive and orderly
            way—by geometrical progression, so to speak—linking detail to detail in a
            steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent and unassailable march upon this tinsel
            toy fortress of error, the dream fabric of a callow imagination. To begin with, young
            sir, I desire to ask you but three questions at present—<i>at
              present.</i> Did I understand you to say it was your opinion that the supposititious
            candle was lighted at about eight o'clock yesterday evening?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1381">"Yes, sir—about eight." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1383">"Could you say exactly eight?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1385">"Well, no, I couldn't be that exact." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1387">"Um. If a person had been passing along there just about that time, he would have been
            almost sure to encounter that assassin, do you think?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1389">"Yes, I should think so." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1391">"Thank you, that is all. For the present. I say, all <i>for the
              present."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1396">"Dern him. he's laying for Archy," said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1399">"It's so," said Ham Sandwich. "I don't like the look of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1401">Stillman said, glancing at the guest, "I was along there myself at half-past
            eight—no, about nine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1403">"In-deed? This is interesting—this is very interesting. Perhaps you encountered
            the assassin?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1405">"No, I encountered no one." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1407">"Ah. Then—if you will excuse the remark—I do not quite see the relevancy of
            the information." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1409">"It has none. At present. I say it has none—at present." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1411">He paused. Presently he resumed: "I did not encounter the assassin, but I am on his
            track, I am sure, for I believe he is in this room. I will ask you all to pass one by
            one in front of me—here, where there is a good light—so that I can see your
            feet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1413">A buzz of excitement swept the place, and the march began, the guest looking on with an
            iron attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified success. Stillman stooped, shaded
            his eyes with his hand, and gazed down intently at each pair of feet as it passed. Fifty
            men tramped monotonously by—with no result. Sixty. Seventy. The thing was
            beginning to look absurd. The guest remarked, with suave irony:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1415">"Stillman Accuses Sherlock Holmes"Image of Stillman pointing a finger at Sherlock Holmes</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1421">"Assassins appear to be scarce this evening." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1423">The house saw the humor if it, and refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. Ten or twelve
            more candidates tramped by—no, <i>danced </i>by, with airy and
            ridiculous capers which convulsed the spectators—then suddenly Stillman put out
            his hand and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1429">"This is the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1431">"Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhedrim!" roared the crowd; and at once let fly a
            pyrotechnic explosion and dazzle and confusion of stirring remarks inspired by the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1433">At the height of the turmoil the guest stretched out his hand, commanding peace. The
            authority of a great name and a great personality laid its mysterious compulsion upon
            the house, and it obeyed. Out of the panting calm which succeeded, the guest spoke,
            saying, with dignity and feeling: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1435"><i>"This</i> is serious. It strikes at an innocent life. Innocent
            beyond suspicion! Innocent beyond peradventure! Hear me <i>prove</i> it;
            observe how simple a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie. Listen. My
            friends, that lad was never out of my sight yesterday evening at <i>any</i> time!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1445">It made a deep impression. Men turned their eyes upon Stillman with grave inquiry in
            them. His face brightened, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1447">"I <i>knew</i> there was another one!" He stepped briskly to the table
            and glanced at the guest's feet, then up at his face, and said: "You were <i>with</i> him! You were not fifty steps from him when he lit the candle
            that by and by fired the powder!" <i>(Sensation.) "</i>And what is more,
            you furnished the matches yourself !" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1458">Plainly the guest seemed hit; it looked so to the public. He opened his mouth to speak;
            the words did not come freely. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1460">"This—er—this is insanity—this—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1462">Stillman pressed his evident advantage home. He held up a charred match. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1464">"Here <i>is</i> one of them. I found it in the barrel—and there's
              <i>another</i> one there." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1472">The guest found his voice at once. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1475"><i>"Yes—</i>and put them there yourself!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1479">It was recognized a good shot. Stillman retorted. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1481">"It is <i>wax—</i>a breed unknown to this camp. I am ready to be
            searched for the box. Are you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1486">The guest was staggered this time—the dullest eye could see it. He fumbled with
            his hands; once or twice his lips moved, but the words did not come. The house waited
            and watched, in tense suspense, the stillness adding effect to the situation. Presently
            Stillman said, gently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1488">"We are waiting for your decision." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1490">There was silence again during several moments; then the guest answered, in a low
            voice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1492">"I refuse to be searched." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1494">There was no noisy demonstration, but all about the house one voice after another
            muttered: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1496">"That settles it! He's Archy's meat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1498">What to do now? Nobody seemed to know. It was an embarrassing situation for the
            moment—merely, of course, because matters had taken such a sudden and unexpected
            turn that these unpractised minds were not prepared for it, and had come to a
            standstill, like a stopped clock, under the shock. But after a little the machinery
            began to work again, tentatively, and by twos and threes the men put their heads
            together and privately buzzed over this and that and the other proposition. One of these
            propositions met with much favor; it was, to confer upon the assassin a vote of thanks
            for removing Flint Buckner, and let him go. But the cooler heads opposed it, pointing
            out that addled brains in the Eastern states would pronounce it a scandal, and make no
            end of foolish noise about it. Finally the cool heads got the upper hand, and obtained
            general consent to a proposition of their own; their leader then called the house to
            order and stated it—to this effect: that Fetlock Jones be jailed and put upon
            trial. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1500">The motion was carried. Apparently there was nothing further to do now, and the people
            were glad, for, privately, they were impatient to get out and rush to the scene of the
            tragedy, and see whether that barrel and the other things were really there or not. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1503">But no—the break-up got a check. The surprises were not over yet. For a while
            Fetlock Jones had been silently sobbing, unnoticed in the absorbing excitements which
            had been following one another so persistently for some time; but when his arrest and
            trial were decreed, he broke out despairingly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1505">"No! it's no use. I don't want any jail, I don't want any trial; I've had all the hard
            luck I want, and all the miseries. Hang me now, and let me out! It would all come out,
            anyway—there couldn't anything save me. He has told it all, just as if he'd been
            with me and seen it—<i>I</i> don't know how he found out; and
            you'll find the barrel and things, and then I wouldn't have any chance any more. I
            killed him; and <i>you'd</i> have done it too, if he'd treated you like
            a dog, and you only a boy, and weak and poor, and not a friend to help you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1513">"And served him damned well right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. "Looky here, boys—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1515">From the constable: "Order! Order, gentlemen!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1517">A voice: "Did your uncle know what you was up to?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1519">"No, he didn't." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1521">"Did he give you the matches, sure enough?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1523">"Yes, he did; but he didn't know what I wanted them for." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1525">"When you was out on such a business as that, how did you venture to risk having him
            along—and him a <i>detective?</i> How's that?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1530">The boy hesitated, fumbled with his buttons in an embarrassed way, then said, shyly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1532">"I know about detectives, on account of having them in the family; and if you don't
            want them to find out about a thing, it's best to have them around when you do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1535">The cyclone of laughter which greeted this native discharge of wisdom did not modify
            the poor little waif's embarrassment in any large degree.</p>Chapter IX<p id="TwaDoubd1e1540">From a letter to Mrs. Stillman, dated merely "Tuesday." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1542">Fetlock Jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log cabin, and left there
              to await his trial. Constable Harris provided him with a couple of days' rations,
              instructed him to keep a good guard over himself, and promised to look in on him as
              soon as further supplies should be due. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1545">Next morning a score of us went with Hillyer, out of friendship, and helped him bury
              his late relative, the unlamented Buckner, and I acted as first assistant pall-bearer,
              Hillyer acting as chief. Just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy
              stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, limped by with his head down, and I caught the
              scent I had chased around the globe! It was the odor of Paradise to my perishing hope!
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1548">In a moment I was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder. He
              slumped to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had withered him in his tracks; and
              as the boys came running he struggled to his knees and put up his pleading hands to
              me, and out of his chattering jaws he begged me to persecute him no more, and said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1551">"You have hunted me around the world, Sherlock Holmes, yet God is my witness I have
              never done any man harm!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1554">A glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane. That was my work, mother!
              The tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery I felt in that moment, but
              nothing else can ever do it. The boys lifted him up, and gathered about him, and were
              full of pity of him, and said the gentlest and touchingest things to him, and said
              cheer up and don't be troubled, he was among friends now, and they would take care of
              him, and protect him, and hang any man that laid a hand on him. They are just like so
              many mothers, the rough mining-camp boys are, when you wake up the south side of their
              hearts; yes, and just like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up
              the opposite of that muscle. They did everything they could think of to comfort him,
              but nothing succeeded until Wells-Fargo Ferguson, who is a clever strategist, said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1557">"If it's only Sherlock Holmes that's troubling you, you needn't worry any more."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1560">"Why?" asked the forlorn lunatic, eagerly. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1563">"Because he's dead again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1566">"Dead! Dead! Oh, don't trifle with a poor wreck like me. <i>Is
              </i>he dead? On honor, now—is he telling me true, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1573">"True as you're standing there!" said Ham Sandwich, and they all backed up the
              statement in a body. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1576">"They hung him in San Bernardino last week," added Ferguson, clinching the matter,
              "whilst he was searching around after you. Mistook him for another man. They're sorry,
              but they can't help it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1579">"They're a-building him a monument," said Ham Sandwich, with the air of a person who
              had contributed to it, and knew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1582">"James Walker" drew a deep sigh—evidently a sigh of relief—and said
              nothing; but his eyes lost something of their wildness, his countenance cleared
              visibly, and its drawn look relaxed a little. We all went to our cabin, and the boys
              cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for, and while they
              were about it Hillyer and I outfitted him from hat to shoe-leather with new clothes of
              ours, and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him. "Old" is the right word,
              and a pity, too: old by the droop of him, and the frost upon his hair, and the marks
              which sorrow and distress have left upon his face; though he is only in his prime in
              the matter of years. While he ate, we smoked and chatted; and when he was finishing he
              found his voice at last, and of his own accord broke out with his personal history. I
              cannot furnish his exact words, but I will come as near it as I can. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1585">THE "WRONG MAN'S" STORY </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1588">It happened like this: I was in Denver. I had been there many years; sometimes I
              remember how many, sometimes I don't—but it isn't any matter. All of a sudden I
              got a notice to leave, or I would be exposed for a horrible crime committed long
              before—years and years before—in the East. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1591">I knew about that crime, but I was not the criminal; it was a cousin of mine of the
              same name. What should I better do? My head was all disordered by fear, and I didn't
              know. I was allowed very little time—only one day, I think it was. I would be
              ruined if I was published, and the people would lynch me, and not believe what I said.
              It is always the way with lynchings: when they find out it is a mistake they are
              sorry, but it is too late—the same as it was with Mr. Holmes, you see. So I said
              I would sell out and get money to live on, and run away until it blew over and I could
              come back with my proofs. Then I escaped in the night and went a long way off in the
              mountains somewhere, and lived disguised and had a false name. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1594">I got more and more troubled and worried, and my troubles made me see spirits and
              hear voices, and I could not think straight and clear on any subject, but got confused
              and involved and had to give it up, because my head hurt so. It got to be worse and
              worse; more spirits and more voices. They were about me all the time; at first only in
              the night, then in the day too. They were always whispering around my bed and plotting
              against me, and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out, because I got no good rest.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1597">And then came the worst. One night the whispers said, "We'll never manage, because
              we can't <i>see</i> him, and so can't point him out to the people."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1603">They sighed; then one said: "We must bring Sherlock Holmes. He can be here in twelve
              days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1606">They all agreed, and whispered and jibbered with joy. But my heart broke; for I had
              read about that man, and knew what it would be to have him upon my track, with his
              superhuman penetration and tireless energies. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1610">The spirits went away to fetch him, and I got up at once in the middle of the night
              and fled away, carrying nothing but the hand-bag that had my money in it—thirty
              thousand dollars; two-thirds of it are in the bag there yet. It was forty days before
              that man caught up on my track. I just escaped. From habit he had written his real
              name on a tavern register, but had scratched it out and written "Dagget Barclay" in
              the place of it. But fear gives you a watchful eye and keen, and I read the true name
              through the scratches, and fled like a deer. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1613">He has hunted me all over this world for three years and a half—the Pacific
              states, Australasia, India—everywhere you can think of; then back to Mexico and
              up to California again, giving me hardly any rest; but that name on the registers
              always saved me, and what is left of me is alive yet. And I am <i>so</i> tired! A cruel time he has given me, yet I give you my honor I have never
              harmed him nor any man. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1619">That was the end of the story, and it stirred those boys to bloodheat, he sure of
              it. As for me—each word burnt a hole in me where it struck. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1622">We voted that the old man should bunk with us, and be my guest and Hillyer's. I
              shall keep my own counsel, naturally; but as soon as he is well rested and nourished,
              I shall take him to Denver and rehabilitate his fortunes. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1625">The boys gave the old fellow the bone-smashing good-fellowship handshake of the
              mines, and then scattered away to spread the news. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1628">At dawn next morning Wells-Fargo Ferguson and Ham Sandwich called us softly out, and
              said, privately: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1631">"That news about the way that old stranger has been treated has spread all around,
              and the camps are up. They are piling in from everywhere, and are going to lynch the
              P'fessor. Constable Harris is in a dead funk, and has telephoned the sheriff. Come
              along!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1634">We started on a run. The others were privileged to feel as they chose, but in my
              heart's privacy I hoped the sheriff would arrive in time; for I had small desire that
              Sherlock Holmes should hang for my deeds, as you can easily believe. I had heard a
              good deal about the sheriff, but </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1637">for reassurance's sake I asked: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1640">"Can he stop a mob?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1643">"Can <i>he</i> stop a mob! Can Jack <i>Fairfax</i>
              stop a mob! Well, I should smile! Ex-desperado—nineteen scalps on his string.
              Can <i>he!</i> Oh, I <i>say!"</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1659">As we tore up the gulch, distant cries and shouts and yells rose faintly on the
              still air, and grew steadily in strength as we raced along. Roar after roar burst out,
              stronger and stronger, nearer and nearer; and at last, when we closed up upon the
              multitude massed in the open area in front of the tavern, the crash of sound was
              deafening. Some brutal roughs from Daly's gorge had Holmes in their grip, and he was
              the calmest man there; a contemptuous smile played about his lips, and if any fear of
              death was in his British heart, his iron personality was master of it and no sign of
              it was allowed to appear. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1662">"Come to a vote, men!" This from one of the Daly gang, Shadbelly Higgins. "Quick! is
              it hang, or shoot?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1665">"Neither!" shouted one of his comrades. "He'll he alive again in a week; burning's
              the only permanency for <i>him."</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1671">The gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a thundercrash of approval, and
              went struggling and surging toward the prisoner, and closed around him, shouting,
              "Fire! fire's the ticket!" They dragged him to the horse-post, backed him against it,
              chained him to it, and piled wood and pine cones around him waist-deep. Still the
              strong face did not blench, and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1674">"A match! fetch a match!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1677">Shadbelly struck it, shaded it with his hand, stooped, and held it under a pine
              cone. A deep silence fell upon the mob. The cone caught, a tiny flame flickered about
              it a moment or two. I seemed to catch the sound of distant hoofs—it grew more
              distinct—still more and more distinct, more and more definite, but the absorbed
              crowd did not appear to notice it. The match went out. The man struck another,
              stooped, and again the flame rose; this time it took hold and began to
              spread—here and there men turned away their faces. The executioner stood with
              the charred match in his fingers, watching his work. The hoof-beats turned a
              projecting crag, and now they came thundering down upon us. Almost the next moment
              there was a shout: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1680">"The sheriff!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1683">And straightway he came tearing into the midst, stood his horse almost on his hind
              feet, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1686">"Fall back, you gutter-snipes!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1689">He was obeyed. By all but their leader. He stood his ground, and his hand went to
              his revolver. The sheriff covered him promptly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1692">"Drop your hand, you parlor desperado. Kick the fire away. Now unchain the
              stranger." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1696">The parlor desperado obeyed. Then the sheriff made a speech; sitting his horse at
              martial ease, and not warming his words with any touch of fire, but delivering them in
              a measured and deliberate way, and in a tone which harmonized with their character and
              made them impressively disrespectful. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1699">"You're a nice lot—now ain't you? Just about eligible to travel with this bilk
              here—Shadbelly Higgins—this loud-mouthed sneak that shoots people in the
              back and calls himself a desperado. If there's anything I do particularly despise,
              it's a lynching mob; I've never seen one that had a man in it. It has to tally up a
              hundred against one before it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor. It's
              made up of cowards, and so is the community that breeds it; and ninety-nine times out
              of a hundred the sheriff's another one." He paused—apparently to turn that last
              idea over in his mind and taste the juice of it—then he went on: "The sheriff
              that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the lowest-down coward there is. By
              the statistics there was a hundred and eighty-two of them drawing sneak pay in America
              last year. By the way it's going, pretty soon there 'll be a new disease in the
                doctor-books—<i>sheriff complaint."</i> That idea pleased
              him—any one could see it. "People will say, 'Sheriff sick again?' 'Yes; got the
              same old thing.' And next there 'll be a new title. People won't say, 'He's running
              for sheriff of Rapaho County,' for instance; they'll say, 'He's running for Coward of
              Rapaho.' Lord, the idea of a grown-up person being afraid of a lynch mob!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1705">He turned an eye on the captive, and said, "Stranger, who are you, and what have you
              been doing?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1708">"My name is Sherlock Holmes, and I have not been doing anything." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1711">It was wonderful, the impression which the sound of that name made on the sheriff,
              notwithstanding he must have come posted. He spoke up with feeling, and said it was a
              blot on the county that a man whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their
              fame and their ingenuity, and whose histories of them had won every reader's heart by
              the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting, should be visited under the Stars
              and Stripes by an outrage like this. He apologized in the name of the whole nation,
              and made Holmes a most handsome bow, and told Constable Harris to see him to his
              quarters, and hold himself personally responsible if he was molested again. Then he
              turned to the mob and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1714">"Hunt your holes, you scum!" which they did; then he said: "Follow me, Shadbelly;
              I'll take care of your case myself. No—keep your popgun; whenever I see the day
              that I'll be afraid to have you behind me with that thing, it 'll be time for me to
              join last year's hundred and eighty-two"; and he rode off in a walk, Shadbelly
              following. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1717">When we were on our way back to our cabin, toward breakfast-time, we ran upon the
              news that Fetlock Jones had escaped from his lock-up in the night and is gone! Nobody
              is sorry. Let his uncle track him out if he likes; it is in his line; the camp is not
              interested.</p>Chapter X<p id="TwaDoubd1e1723"><i>Ten days later.</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1728">"James Walker" is all right in body now, and his mind shows improvement too. I start
              with him for Denver to-morrow morning. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1731"><i>Next night. Brief note, mailed at a way-station.</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1736">As we were starting, this morning, Hillyer whispered to me: "Keep this news from

There has been a
            wedding, between a handsome young man of slender means and a rich young girl—a
            case of love at first sight and a precipitate marriage; a marriage bitterly opposed by
            the girl's widowed father. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e140">Jacob Fuller, the bridegroom, is twenty-six years old, is of an old but unconsidered
            family which had by compulsion emigrated from Sedgemoor, and for King James's purse's
            profit, so everybody said—some maliciously the rest merely because they believed
            it. The bride is nineteen and beautiful. She is intense, high-strung, romantic,
            immeasurably proud of her Cavalier blood, and passionate in her love for her young
            husband. For its sake she braved her father's displeasure, endured his reproaches,
            listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions and went from his house
            without his blessing, proud and happy in the proofs she was thus giving of the quality
            of the affection which had made its home in her heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e142">The morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her. Her husband put aside
            her proffered caresses, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e144">"Sit down. I have something to say to you. I loved you. That was before I asked your
            father to give you to me. His refusal is not my grievance—I could have endured
            that. But the things he said of me to you—that is a different matter.
            There—you needn't speak; I know quite well what they were; I got them from
            authentic sources. Among other things he said that my character was written in my face;
            that I was treacherous, a dissembler, a coward, and a brute without sense of pity or
            compassion: the 'Sedgemoor trade-mark,' he called it—and 'white-sleeve badge.' Any
            other man in my place would have gone to his house and shot him down like a dog. I
            wanted to do it, and was minded to do it, but a better thought came to me: to put him to
            shame; to break his heart; to kill him by inches. How to do it? Through my treatment of
            you, his idol! I would marry you; and then—Have patience. You will see. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e146">From that moment onward, for three months, the young wife suffered all the
            humiliations, all the insults, all the miseries that the diligent and inventive mind of
            the husband could contrive, save physical injuries only. Her strong pride stood by her,
            and she kept the secret of her troubles. Now and then the husband said, "Why don't you
            go to your father and tell him?" Then he invented new tortures, applied them, and asked
            again. She always answered, "He shall never know by my mouth," and taunted him with his
            origin; said she was the lawful slave of a scion of slaves, and must obey, and
            would—up to that point, but no further; he could kill her if he liked, but he
            could not break her; it was not in the Sedgemoor breed to do it. At the end of the three
            months he said, with a dark significance in his manner, "I have tried all things but
            one"—and waited for her reply. "Try that," she said, and curled her lip in
            mockery. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e148">That night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes, then said to her: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e150">"Get up and dress!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e152">She obeyed—as always, without a word. He led her half a mile from the house, and
            proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public road; and succeeded, she
            screaming and struggling. He gagged her then, struck her across the face with his
            cowhide, and set his bloodhounds on her. They tore the clothes off her, and she was
            naked. He called the dogs off, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e154">"You will be found—by the passing public. They will be dropping along about three
            hours from now, and will spread the news—do you hear? Good-by. You have seen the
            last of me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e156">He went away then. She moaned to herself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e159">"I shall bear a child—to <i>him!</i> God grant it may be a boy!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e164">The farmers released her by and by—and spread the news, which was natural. They
            raised the country with lynching intentions, but the bird had flown. The young wife shut
            herself up in her father's house; he shut himself up with her, and thenceforth would see
            no one. His pride was broken, and his heart; so he wasted away, day by day, and even his
            daughter rejoiced when death relieved him. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e166">Then she sold the estate and disappeared.</p>Chapter 2<p id="TwaDoubd1e171">In 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded New England village,
            with no company but a little boy about five years old. She did her own work, she
            discouraged acquaintanceships, and had none. The butcher, the baker, and the others that
            served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was
            Stillman, and that she called the child Archy. Whence she came they had not been able to
            find out, but they said she talked like a Southerner. The child had no playmates and no
            comrade, and no teacher but the mother. She taught him diligently and intelligently, and
            was satisfied with the results—even a little proud of them. One day Archy said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e173">"Mamma, am I different from other children?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e175">"Well, I suppose not. Why?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e177">"There was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had been by and I
            said yes, and she said how long since I saw him and I said I hadn't seen him at all, and
            she said how did I know he'd been by, then, and I said because I smelt his track on the
            sidewalk, and she said I was a dum fool and made a mouth at me. What did she do that
            for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e179">The young woman turned white, and said to herself, "It's a birth mark! The gift of the
            bloodhound is in him." She snatched the boy to her breast and hugged him passionately,
            saying, "God has appointed the way!" Her eyes were burning with a fierce light, and her
            breath came short and quick with excitement. She said to herself: "The puzzle is solved
            now; many a time it has been a mystery to me, the impossible things the child has done
            in the dark, but it is all clear to me now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e181">She set him in his small chair, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e183">"Wait a little till I come, dear; then we will talk about the matter." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e185">She went up to her room and took from her dressing-table several small articles and put
            them out of sight: a nail-file on the floor under the bed; a pair of nail-scissors under
            the bureau; a small ivory paper-knife under the wardrobe. Then she returned, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e187">"There! I have left some things which I ought to have brought down." She named them,
            and said, "Run up and bring them, dear." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e189">The child hurried away on his errand and was soon back again with the things. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e192">"Did you have any difficulty, dear?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e194">"No, mamma; I only went where you went." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e196">During his absence she had stepped to the bookcase, taken several books from the bottom
            shelf, opened each, passed her hand over a page, noting its number in her memory, then
            restored them to their places. Now she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e198">"I have been doing something while you have been gone, Archy. Do you think you can find
            out what it was?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e200">The boy went to the bookcase and got out the books that had been touched, and opened
            them at the pages which had been stroked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e202">The mother took him in her lap, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e204">"I will answer your question now, dear. I have found out that in one way you are quite
            different from other people. You can see in the dark, you can smell what other people
            cannot, you have the talents of a bloodhound. They are good and valuable things to have,
            but you must keep the matter a secret. If people found it out, they would speak of you
            as an odd child, a strange child, and children would be disagreeable to you, and give
            you nicknames. In this world one must be like everybody else if he doesn't want to
            provoke scorn or envy or jealousy. It is a great and fine distinction which has been
            born to you, and I am glad; but you will keep it a secret, for mamma's sake, won't you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e206">The child promised, without understanding. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e208">All the rest of the day the mother's brain was busy with excited thinkings; with plans,
            projects, schemes, each and all of them uncanny, grim, and dark. Yet they lit up her
            face; lit it with a fell light of their own; lit it with vague fires of hell. She was in
            a fever of unrest; she could not sit, stand, read, sew; there was no relief for her but
            in movement. She tested her boy's gift in twenty ways, and kept saying to herself all
            the time, with her mind in the past: "He broke my father's heart, and night and day all
            these years I have tried, and all in vain, to think out a way to break his. I have found
            it now—I have found it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e210">When night fell, the demon of unrest still possessed her. She went on with her tests;
            with a candle she traversed the house from garret to cellar, hiding pins, needles,
            thimbles, spools, under pillows, under carpets, in cracks in the walls, under the coal
            in the bin; then sent the little fellow in the dark to find them; which he did, and was
            happy and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e212">From this time forward life took on a new complexion for her. She said, "The future is
            secure—I can wait, and enjoy the waiting." The most of her lost interests revived.
            She took up music again, and languages, drawing, painting, and the other long-discarded
            delights of her maidenhood. She was happy once more, and felt again the zest of life. As
            the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy, and was contented with it.
            Not altogether, but nearly that. The soft side of his heart was larger than the other
            side of it. It was his only defect, in her eyes. But she considered that his love for
            her and worship of her made up for it. He was a good hater—that was well; but it
            was a question if the materials of his hatreds were of as tough and enduring a quality
            as those of his friendships—and that was not so well. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e215">The years drifted on. Archy was become a handsome, shapely, athletic youth, courteous,
            dignified, companionable, pleasant in his ways, and looking perhaps a trifle older than
            he was, which was sixteen. One evening his mother said she had something of grave
            importance to say to him, adding that he was old enough to hear it now, and old enough
            and possessed of character enough and stability enough to carry out a stern plan which
            she had been for years contriving and maturing. Then she told him her bitter story, in
            all its naked atrociousness. For a while the boy was paralyzed; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e217">"I understand. We are Southerners; and by our custom and nature there is but one

            You must not hurt a hair of his head." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e221">The boy was lost in thought awhile; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e223">"You are all the world to me, and your desire is my law and my pleasure. Tell me what
            to do and I will do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e225">The mother's eyes beamed with satisfaction, and she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e227">"You will go and find him. I have known his hiding-place for eleven years; it cost me
            five years and more of inquiry, and much money, to locate it. He is a quartz-miner in
            Colorado, and well-to-do. He lives in Denver. His name is Jacob Fuller. There—it
            is the first time I have spoken it since that unforgettable night. Think! That name
            could have been yours if I had not saved you that shame and furnished you a cleaner one.
            You will drive him from that place; you will hunt him down and drive him again; and yet
            again, and again, and again, persistently, relentlessly, poisoning his life, filling it
            with mysterious terrors, loading it with weariness and misery, making him wish for
            death, and that he had a suicide's courage; you will make of him another Wandering Jew;
            he shall know no rest any more, no peace of mind, no placid sleep; you shall shadow him,
            cling to him, persecute him, till you break his heart, as he broke my father's and
            mine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e229">"I will obey, mother." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e231">"I believe it, my child. The preparations are all made; everything is ready. Here is a
            letter of credit; spend freely, there is no lack of money. At times you may need
            disguises. I have provided them; also some other conveniences." She took from the drawer
            of the typewriter-table several squares of paper. They all bore these typewritten
            words:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e233"><i>$10,000 REWARD</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e237"><i>It is believed that a certain man who is wanted in an Eastern

                clothes from her, leaving her naked. He left her there, and fled the country. A

            first you must give him several days in which to force a sale of his belongings at
            something approaching their value. We will ruin him by and by, but gradually; we must
            not impoverish him at once, for that could bring him to despair and injure his health,
            possibly kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e244">She took three or four more typewritten forms from the

                Fuller. I have his scent; I could track him through ten divisions of infantry and
                find him. I have often been near him and heard him talk. He owns a good mine, and
                has a fair income from it; but he is not rich. He learned mining in a good
                way—by working at it for wages. He is a cheerful creature, and his forty-three
                years sit lightly upon him; he could pass for a younger man—say thirty-six or
                thirty-seven. He has never married again—passes himself off for a widower. He
                stands well, is liked, is popular, and has many friends. Even I feel a drawing
                toward him—the paternal blood in me making its claim. How blind and
                unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature—the most of them, in
                fact! My task is become hard now—you realize it? you comprehend, and make
                allowances?—and the fire of it has cooled, more than I like to confess to
                myself, But I will carry it out. Even with the pleasure paled, the duty remains, and
                I will not spare him.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e286"><i>And for my help, a sharp resentment rises in me when I reflect
                that he who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not suffered by it.
                The lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character, and in the change he is
                happy. He, the guilty party, is absolved from all suffering; you, the innocent, are
                borne down with it. But be comforted—he shall harvest his share.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e290">SILVER GULCH, <i>May 19</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e295"><i>I placarded Form No. 1 at midnight of April 3; an hour later I
                slipped Form No. 2 under his chamber door, notifying him to leave Denver at or
                before 11.50 the night of the 14th.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e299"><i>Some late bird of a reporter stole one of my placards, then hunted
                the town over and found the other one, and stole that. In this manner he
                accomplished what the profession call a "scoop"—that is, he got a valuable
                item, and saw to it that no other paper got it. And so his paper—the principal
                one in the town—had it in glaring type on the editorial page in the morning,
                followed by a Vesuvian opinion of our wretch a column long, which wound up by adding
                a thousand dollars to our reward on the paper's account! The journals out here know
                how to do the noble thing—when there's business in it.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e303"><i>At breakfast I occupied my usual seat—selected because it
                afforded a view of papa Fuller's face, and was near enough for me to hear the talk
                that went on at his table. Seventy-five or a hundred people were in the room, and
                all discussing that item, and saying they hoped the seeker would find that rascal
                and remove the pollution of his presence from the town—with a rail, or a
                bullet, or something.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e307"><i>When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leave—folded
                up—in one hand, and the newspaper in the other; and it gave me more than half
                a pang to see him. His cheerfulness was all gone, and he looked old and pinched and
                ashy. And then—only think of the things he had to listen to! Mamma, he heard
                his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and characterizations drawn
                from the very dictionaries and phrase-books of Satan's own authorized editions down
                below. And more than that, he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them. His
                applause tasted bitter in his mouth, though; he could not disguise that from me; and
                it was observable that his appetite was gone; he only nibbled; he couldn't eat.
                Finally a man said:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e311"><i>"It is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing
                what this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel. I hope so."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e316"><i>Ah, dear, it was pitiful the way Fuller winced, and glanced around
                scared! He couldn't endure any more, and got up and left.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e320"><i>During several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in
                Mexico, and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could, and give the
                property his personal attention. He played his cards well; said he would take
                $40,000—a quarter in cash, the rest in safe notes; but that as he greatly
                needed money on account of his new purchase, he would diminish his terms for cash in
                full, He sold out for $30,000. And then, what do you think he did? He asked for
                greenbacks, and took them, saying the man in Mexico was a New-Englander, with a head
                full of crotchets, and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts. People thought it
                queer, since a draft on New York could produce greenbacks quite conveniently. There
                was talk of this odd thing, but only for a day; that is as long as any topic lasts
                in Denver.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e324"><i>I was watching, all the time. As soon as the sale was completed
                and the money paid—which was on the 11th—I began to stick to Fuller's
                track without dropping it for a moment. That night—no, 12th, for it was a
                little past midnight—I tracked him to his room, which was four doors from mine
                in the same hall; then I went back and put on my muddy day-laborer disguise,
                darkened my complexion, and sat down in my room in the gloom, with a gripsack handy,
                with a change in it, and my door ajar. For I suspected that the bird would take wing
                now. In half an hour an old woman passed by, carrying a grip: I caught the familiar
                whiff, and followed with my grip, for it was Fuller. He left the hotel by a side
                entrance, and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three
                blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness, and got into a two-horse hack, which of
                course was waiting for him by appointment. I took a seat (uninvited) on the trunk
                platform behind, and we drove briskly off. We drove ten miles, and the hack stopped
                at a way-station and was discharged. Fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow
                under the awning, as far as he could get from the light; I went inside, and watched
                the ticket-office. Fuller bought no ticket; I bought none. Presently the train came
                along, and he boarded a car; I entered the same car at the other end, and came down
                the aisle and took the seat behind him. When he paid the conductor and named his
                objective point, I dropped back several seats, while the conductor was changing a
                bill, and when he came to me I paid to the same place—about a hundred miles
                westward.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e328"><i>From that time for a week on end he led me a dance. He traveled
                here and there and yonder—always on a general westward trend—but he boas
                not a woman after the first day. He was a laborer, like myself, and wore bushy false
                whiskers. His outfit was perfect, and he could do the character without thinking
                about it, for he had served the trade for wages. His nearest friend could not have
                recognized him. At last he located himself here, the obscurest little mountain camp
                in Montana; he has a shanty, and goes out prospecting daily; is gone all day, and
                avoids society. I am living at a miner's boardinghouse, and it is an awful place:
                the bunks, the food, the dirt—everything.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e332"><i>We have been here four weeks, and in that time I have seen him but
                once; but every night I go over his track and post myself. As soon as he engaged a
                shanty here I went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed that Denver hotel to
                keep my baggage till I should send for it. I need nothing here but a change of army
                shirts, and I brought that with me.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e336">SILVER GULCH, <i>June 12</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e341"><i>The Denver episode has never found its way here, I think. I know
                the most of the men in camp, and they have never referred to it, at least in my
                hearing. Fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions. He has located a
                claim, two miles away, in an out-of-the-way place in the mountains; it promises very
                well, and he is working it diligently. Ah, but the change in him! He never smiles,
                and he keeps quite to himself, consorting with no one—he who was so fond of
                company and so cheery only two months ago. I have seen him passing along several
                times recently—drooping, forlorn, the spring gone from his step, a pathetic
                figure. He calls himself David Wilson.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e345"><i>I can trust him to remain here until we disturb him. Since you
                insist, I will banish him again, but I do not see how he can be unhappier than he
                already is. I will go hack to Denver and treat myself to a little season of comfort,
                and edible food, and endurable beds, and bodily decency; then I will fetch my
                things, and notify poor papa Wilson to move on.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e349">DENVER, <i>June 19 </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e354"><i>They miss him here. They all hope he is prospering in Mexico, and

                than the other one; he came here a young widower in '79, aged twenty-one—a
                year before you were married; and the documents to prove it are innumerable. Last
                night I talked with familiar friends of his who have known him from the day of his
                arrival. I said nothing, but a few days from now I will land him in this town again,
                with the loss upon his mine made good; and there will be a banquet, and a
                torch-light procession, and there will not be any expense on anybody but me. Do you

                to-night, in a wagon—two or three hours of that, then I get a train. I don't
                know where I'm going, but I must go; to try to keep still would be

                advertise for him. But if there is any way to do it that would not frighten him, I
                have not been able to think it out, and I have tried till my brains are addled. "If
                the gentleman who lately bought a mine in Mexico and sold one in Denver will send
                his address to" (to whom, mother!), "it will be explained to him that it was all a
                mistake; his forgiveness will be asked, and full reparation made for a loss which he
                sustained in a certain matter." Do you see? He would think it a trap. Well, any one
                would. If I should say, "It is now known that he was not the man wanted, but another
                man—a man who once bore the same name, but discarded it for good
                reasons"—would that answer? But the Denver people would wake up then and say
                "Oho!" and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks, and say, "Why did he
                run away if he wasn't the right man?—it is too thin." If I failed to find him
                he would be ruined there—there where there is no taint upon him now. You have
                a better head than mine. Help me.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e412"><i>I have one clue, and only one. I know his handwriting. If he puts
                his new false name upon a hotel register and does not disguise it too much, it will

                to the Pacific, and how nearly I came to getting him once. Well, I have had another
                close miss. It was here, yesterday. I struck his trail,</i> hot, <i>on the street, and followed it on a run to a cheap hotel. That was a costly
                mistake; a dog would have gone the other way. But I am only part dog, and can get
                very humanly stupid when excited. He had been stopping in that house ten days; I
                almost know, now, that he stops long nowhere, the past six or eight months, but is
                restless and has to keep moving. I understand that feeling! and I know what it is to
                feel it. He still uses the name he had registered when I came so near catching him
                nine months ago—"James Walker"; doubtless the same he adopted when he fled
                from Silver Gulch. An unpretending man, and has small taste for fancy names. I
                recognized the hand easily, through its slight disguise. A square man, and not good

                not much loss to the house." "</i>Old!" <i>I suppose he is, now I

                wharf. Mother, the smoke of the steamer he had taken was just fading out on the
                horizon! I should have saved half on hour if I had gone in the right direction at
                first. I could have taken a fast tug, and should have stood a chance of catching
                that vessel. She is bound for Melbourne.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e436">HOPE CAÑON, CALIFORNIA, <i>October 3, 1900 </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e441"><i>You have a right to complain. "A letter a year"</i> is <i>a paucity; I freely acknowledge it; but how can one write when there

                Hope Cañon; I traced him to a point thirty miles from here, but there I lost
                the trail; some one gave him a lift in a wagon, I suppose. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e463"><i>I am taking a rest, now—modified by searchings for the lost
                trail. I was tired to death, mother, and low-spirited, and sometimes coming
                uncomfortably near to losing hope; but the miners in this little camp are good
                fellows, and I am used to their sort this long time back; and their breezy ways
                freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles. I have been here a month. I am
                cabining with a young fellow named "Sammy" Hillyer, about twenty-five, the only son
                of his mother—like me—and loves her dearly, and writes to her every
                week—part of which is like me. He is a timid body, and in the matter of
                intellect—well, he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire; but no
                matter, he is well liked; he is good and fine, and it is meat and bread and rest and
                luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again. I wish "James Walker"
                could have it. He had friends; he liked company. That brings up that picture of him,
                the time that I saw him last. The pathos of it! It comes before me often and often.
                At that very time, poor thing, I was girding up my conscience to make him move on
                again!</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e467"><i>Hillyer's heart is better than mine, better than anybody's in the
                community, I suppose, for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the
                camp—Flint Buckner—and the only man Flint ever talks with or allows to
                talk with him. He says he knows Flint's history, and that it is trouble that has
                made him what he is, and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can. Now
                none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a lodger like Flint
                Buckner, from all I hear about him outside. I think that this one detail will give
                you a better idea of Sammy's character than any labored-out description I could
                furnish you of him. In one of our talks he said something about like this: "Flint is
                a kinsman of mine, and he pours out all his troubles to me—empties his breast
                from time to time, or I reckon it would burst. There couldn't be any unhappier man,
                Archy Stillman; his life had been made up of misery of mind—he isn't near as
                old as he looks. He has lost the feel of reposefulness and peace—oh, years and
                years ago! He doesn't know what good luck is—never has had any; often says he
                wishes he was in the other hell, he is so tired of this one."</i></p>Chapter IV<p id="TwaDoubd1e474"><i>No real gentleman will tell the naked truth in the presence of
              ladies.</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e478">It was a crisp and spicy morning in early October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with
            the glory-fires of autumn, hung burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge
            provided by kind Nature for the wingless wild things that have their homes in the
            tree-tops and would visit together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and
            yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the
            sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere;
            far in he empty sky a solitary esophagus[1] slept upon motionless
            wing; everywhere brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e483">October is the time—1900; Hope Cañon is the place, a silver-mining camp
            away down in the Esmeralda region. It is a secluded spot, high and remote; recent as to
            discovery; thought by its occupants to be rich in metal—a year or two's
            prospecting will decide that matter one way or the other. For inhabitants, the camp has
            about two hundred miners, one white woman and child, several Chinese washermen, five
            squaws, and a dozen vagrant buck Indians in rabbit-skin robes, battered plug hats, and
            tin-can necklaces. There are no mills as yet; no church, no newspaper. The camp has
            existed but two years; it has made no big strike; the world is ignorant of its name and
            place. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e485">On both sides of the cañon the mountains rise wall-like, three thousand feet,
            and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the
            sun only once a day, when he sails over at noon. The village is a couple of miles long;
            the cabins stand well apart from each other. The tavern is the only "frame"
            house—the only house, one might say. It occupies a central position, and is the
            evening resort of the population. They drink there, and play seven-up and dominoes; also
            billiards, for there is a table, crossed all over with torn places repaired with
            court-plaster; there are some cues, but no leathers; some chipped balls which clatter
            when they run, and do not slow up gradually, but stop suddenly and sit down; there is a
            part of a cube of chalk, with a projecting jag of flint in it; and the man who can score
            six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bar's expense. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e487">Flint Buckner's cabin was the last one of the village, going south; his silver-claim
            was at the other end of the village, northward, and a little beyond the last hut in that
            direction. He was a sour creature, unsociable, and had no companionships. People who had
            tried to get acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him. His history was not
            known. Some believed that Sammy Hillyer knew it; others said no. If asked, Hillyer said
            no, he was not acquainted with it. Flint had a meek English youth of sixteen or
            seventeen with him, whom he treated roughly, both in public and in private; and of
            course this lad was applied to for information, but with no success. Fetlock
            Jones—name of the youth—said that Flint picked him up on a prospecting
            tramp, and as he had neither home nor friends in America, he had found it wise to stay
            and take Buckner's hard usage for the sake of the salary, which was bacon and beans.
            Further than this he could offer no testimony. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e489">Fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now, and under his meek exterior he was
            slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and humiliations which his master had put
            upon him. For the meek suffer bitterly from these hurts; more bitterly, perhaps, than do
            the manlier sort, who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the limit of
            endurance has been reached. Good-hearted people wanted to help Fetlock out of his
            trouble, and tried to get him to leave Buckner; but the boy showed fright at the
            thought, and said he "dasn't." Pat Riley urged him, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e491">"You leave the damned hunks and come with me; don't you be afraid. I'll take care of
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e496">The boy thanked him with tears in his eyes, but shuddered and said he "dasn't risk it";
            he said Flint would catch him alone, some time, in the night, and then—"Oh, it
            makes me sick, Mr. Riley, to think of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e498">Others said, "Run away from him; we'll stake you; skip out for the coast some night."
            But all these suggestions failed; he said Flint would hunt him down and fetch him back,
            just for meanness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e500">The people could not understand this. The boy's miseries went steadily on, week after
            week. It is quite likely that the people would have understood if they had known how he
            was employing his spare time. He slept in an out-cabin near Flint's; and there, nights,
            he nursed his bruises and his humiliations, and studied and studied over a single
            problem—how he could murder Flint Buckner and not be found out. It was the only
            joy he had in life; these hours were the only ones in the twenty-four which he looked
            forward to with eagerness and spent in happiness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e503">He thought of poison. No—that would not serve; the inquest would reveal where it
            was procured and who had procured it. He thought of a shot in the back in a lonely place
            when Flint would be homeward bound at midnight—his unvarying hour for the trip.
            No—somebody might be near, and catch him. He thought of stabbing him in his sleep.
            No—he might strike an inefficient blow, and Flint would seize him. He examined a
            hundred different ways—none of them would answer; for in even the very obscurest
            and secretest of them there was always the fatal defect of a <i>risk,</i> a chance, a possibility that he might be found out. He would have none of
            that. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e508">But he was patient, endlessly patient. There was no hurry, he said to himself. He would
            never leave Flint till he left him a corpse; there was no hurry—he would find the
            way. It was somewhere, and he would endure shame and pain and misery until he found it.
            Yes, somewhere there was a way which would leave not a trace, not even the faintest clue
            to the murderer—there was no hurry—he would find that way, and
            then—oh, then, it would just be good to be alive! Meantime he would diligently
            keep up his reputation for meekness; and also, as always theretofore, he would allow no
            one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about his oppressor. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e510">Two days before the before-mentioned October morning Flint had bought some things, and
            he and Fetlock had brought them home to Flint's cabin: a fresh box of candles, which
            they put in the corner; a tin can of blasting-powder, which they placed upon the
            candle-box; a keg of blasting-powder, which they placed under Flint's bunk; a huge coil
            of fuse, which they hung on a peg. Fetlock reasoned that Flint's mining operations had
            outgrown the pick, and that blasting was about to begin now. He had seen blasting done,
            and he had a notion of the process, but he had never helped in it. His conjecture was
            right—blasting-time had come. In the morning the pair carried fuse, drills, and
            the powder-can to the shaft; it was now eight feet deep, and to get into it and out of
            it a short ladder was used. They descended, and by command Fetlock held the
            drill—without any instructions as to the right way to hold it—and Flint
            proceeded to strike. The sledge came down; the drill sprang out of Fetlock's hand,
            almost as a matter of course. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e512">"You mangy son of a nigger, is that any way to hold a drill? Pick it up! Stand it up!
            There—hold fast. D— you! <i>I'll</i> teach you!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e517">At the end of an hour the drilling was finished. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e519">"Now, then, charge it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e521">The boy started to pour in the powder. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e523">"Idiot!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e525">A heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e527">"Get up! You can't lie sniveling there. Now, then, stick in the fuse <i>first. Now</i> put in the powder. Hold on, hold on! Are you going to fill the hole
              <i>all</i> up? Of all the sap-headed milksops I—Put in some
            dirt! Put in some gravel! Tamp it down! Hold on, hold on! Oh, great Scott! get out of
            the way!" He snatched the iron and tamped the charge himself, meantime cursing and
            blaspheming like a fiend. Then he fired the fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and ran
            fifty yards away, Fetlock following. They stood waiting a few minutes, then a great
            volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion; after a
            little there was a shower of descending stones; then all was serene again. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e535">"I wish to God you'd been in it!" remarked the master. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e538">They went down the shaft, cleaned it out, drilled another hole, and put in another
            charge. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e540">"Look here! How much fuse are you proposing to waste? Don't you know how to time a
            fuse?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e542">"No, sir." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e544">"You <i>don't!</i> Well, if you don't beat anything <i>I</i> ever saw!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e552">He climbed out of the shaft and spoke down: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e554">"Well, idiot, are you going to be all day? Cut the fuse and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e556">The trembling creature began: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e558">"If you please, sir, I—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e560">"You talk back to <i>me?</i> Cut it and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e565">The boy cut and lit. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e567">"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! I wish you were in—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e570">In his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft and ran. The boy was aghast. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e572">"Oh, my God! Help. Help! Oh, save me!" he implored. "Oh, what can I do! What <i>can</i> I do!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e577">He backed against the wall as tightly as he could; the sputtering fuse frightened the
            voice out of him; his breath stood still; he stood gazing and impotent; in two seconds,
            three seconds, four he would be flying toward the sky torn to fragments. Then he had an
            inspiration. He sprang at the fuse; severed the inch of it that was left above ground,
            and was saved. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e579">He sank down limp and half lifeless with fright, his strength gone; but he muttered
            with a deep joy: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e581">"He has learnt me! I knew there was a way, if I would wait." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e583">After a matter of five minutes Buckner stole to the shaft, looking worried and uneasy,
            and peered down into it. He took in the situation; he saw what had happened. He lowered
            the ladder, and the boy dragged himself weakly up it. He was very white. His appearance
            added something to Buckner's uncomfortable state, and he said, with a show of regret and
            sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from lack of practice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e585">"It was an accident, you know. Don't say anything about it to anybody; I was excited,
            and didn't notice what I was doing. You're not looking well; you've worked enough for
            to-day; go down to my cabin and eat what you want, and rest. It's just an accident, you
            know, on account of my being excited." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e587">"It scared me," said the lad, as he started away; "but I learnt something, so I don't
            mind it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e589">"Damned easy to please!" muttered Buckner, following him with his eye. I wonder if
            he'll tell? Mightn't he?... I wish it <i>had</i> killed him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e594">The boy took no advantage of his holiday in the matter of resting; he employed it in
            work, eager and feverish and happy work. A thick growth of chaparral extended down the
            mountainside clear to Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's labor was done in the dark
            intricacies of that stubborn growth; the rest of it was done in his own shanty. At last
            all was complete, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e596">"If he's got any suspicions that I'm going to tell on him, he won't keep them long,
            to-morrow. He will see that I am the same milksop as I always was—all day and the
            next. And the day after to-morrow night there 'll be an end of him; nobody will ever
            guess who finished him up nor how it was done. He dropped me the idea his own self, and
            that's odd."</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e602"> From the Springfield <i>Republican,</i> April 12, 1902.</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e607">To the Editor of the

                  question about the "esophagus," and I wish to answer him through you. This in the
                  hope that the answer will get around, and save me some penmanship, for I have
                  already replied to the same question more than several times, and am not getting
                  as much holiday as I ought to have.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e614"><i>I
                  published a short story lately, and it was in that that I put the esophagus. I
                  will say privately that I expected it to bother some people—in fact, that
                  was the intention—but the harvest has been larger than I was calculating
                  upon. The esophagus has gathered in the guilty and the innocent alike, whereas I
                  was only fishing for the innocent—the innocent and confiding. I knew a few
                  of these would write and ask me; that would give me but little trouble; but, I was
                  not expecting that the wise and the learned would call upon me for succor.
                  However, that has happened, and it is time for me to speak up and stop the
                  inquiries if I can, for letter-writing is not restful to me, and I am not having
                  so much fun out of this thing as I counted on. That you may understand the
                  situation, I will insert a couple of sample inquiries. The first is from a public
                  instructor in the Philippines: </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e618">SANTA CRUZ, <i>Ilocos, Sur, P. I. </i><br><i>February 13,

                  reading the first part of your latest story, entitled "A Double-barreled Detective
                  Story," and am very much delighted with it. In Part IV, page 264,</i> Harper's
                Magazine <i>for January, occurs this passage: "far in the empty sky a
                  solitary 'esophagus' slept upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness,
                  serenity, and the peace of God." Now, there is one word I do not understand,
                  namely, "esophagus." My only work of reference is the</i> Standard Dictionary,
                  <i>but that fails to explain the meaning. If you can spare the
                  time, I would be glad to have the meaning cleared up, as I consider the passage a
                  very touching and beautiful one. It may seem foolish to you, but consider my lack
                  of means away out in the northern part of Luzon.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e636"><i>Yours very truly.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e640"><i>Do you notice?
                  Nothing in the paragraph disturbed him but that one word. It shows that the
                  paragraph was most ably constructed for the deception it was intended to put upon
                  the reader. It was my intention that it should read plausibly, and it is now plain
                  that it does; it was my intention that it should be emotional and touching, and
                  you see, yourself, that it fetched this public instructor. Alas, If I had but left
                  that one treacherous word out, I should have scored! scored everywhere; and the

                  it done. But the illusion ought not to endure even the first incident in the
                  February number. As for the paragraph which has so admirably illustrated the skill
                  of Mr. Clemens's ensemble and the carelessness of readers, here it
              is:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e688"><i>"It was a crisp and spicy morning in early
                  October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung
                  burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind nature for
                  the wingless wild things that have their home in the tree-tops and would visit
                  together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow flames in
                  brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the sensuous
                  fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere; far
                  in the empty sky a solitary esophagus slept upon motionless wings; everywhere
                  brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e692"><i>The success of Mark Twain's joke recalls to mind his story of the
                  petrified man in the cavern, whom he described most punctiliously, first giving a
                  picture of the scene, its impressive solitude, and all that; then going on to
                  describe the majesty of the figure, casually mentioning that the thumb of his
                  right hand rested against the side of his nose; then after further description
                  observing that the fingers of the right hand were extended in a radiating fashion;
                  and, recurring to the dignified attitude and position of the man, incidentally
                  remarked that the thumb of the left hand was in contact with the little finger of
                  the right—and so on. But was it so ingeniously written that Mark, relating
                  the history years later in an article which appeared in that excellent magazine of
                  the past, the</i> Galaxy, <i>declared that no one ever found out
                  the joke, and, if we remember aright, that that astonishing old mockery was
                  actually looked for in the region where he, as a Nevada newspaper editor, had
                  located it. It is certain that Mark Twain's jumping frog has a good many more
                  "pints" than any other frog.</i></p>Chapter V<p id="TwaDoubd1e702">The next day came and went. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e704">It is now almost midnight, and in five minutes the new morning will begin. The scene is
            in the tavern billiard-room. Rough men in rough clothing, slouch-hats, breeches stuffed
            into boot-tops, some with vests, none with coats, are grouped about the boiler-iron
            stove, which has ruddy cheeks and is distributing a grateful warmth; the billiard-balls
            are clacking; there is no other sound—that is, within; the wind is fitfully
            moaning without. The men look bored; also expectant. A hulking broad-shouldered miner,
            of middle age, with grizzled whiskers, and an unfriendly eye set in an unsociable face,
            rises, slips a coil of fuse upon his arm, gathers up some other personal properties, and
            departs without word or greeting to anybody. It is Flint Buckner. As the door closes
            behind him a buzz of talk breaks out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e706">"The regularest man that ever was," said Jake Parker, the blacksmith: "you can tell
            when it's twelve just by him leaving, without looking at your Waterbury." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e708">"And it's the only virtue he's got, as fur as I know," said Peter Hawes, miner. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e710">"He's just a blight on this society," said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "If I was
            running this shop I'd make him say something, <i>some</i> time or other,
            or vamos the ranch." This with a suggestive glance at the barkeeper, who did not choose
            to see it, since the man under discussion was a good customer, and went home pretty well
            set up, every night, with refreshments furnished from the bar. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e715">"Say," said Ham Sandwich, miner, "does any of you boys ever recollect of him asking you
            to take a drink?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e717"><i>"Him?</i> Flint <i>Buckner?</i> Oh, Laura!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e724">This sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous general outburst in one form of words or
            another from the crowd. After a brief silence, Pat Riley, miner, said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e726">"He's the 15-puzzle, that cuss. And his boy's another one. <i>I
            </i>can't make them out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e731">"Nor anybody else," said Ham Sandwich; "and if they are 15-puzzles how are you going to
            rank up that other one? When it comes to A 1 right-down solid mysteriousness, he lays
            over both of them. <i>Easy—</i>don't he?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e737">"You bet!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e739">Everybody said it. Every man but one. He was the new-comer-Peterson. He ordered the
            drinks all round, and asked who No. 3 might be. All answered at once, "Archy Stillman!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e741">"Is he a mystery?" asked Peterson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e743">"Is <i>he</i> a mystery? Is Archy <i>Stillman a</i>
            mystery?" said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "Why, the fourth dimension's foolishness to
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e754">For Ferguson was learned. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e756">Peterson wanted to hear all about him; everybody wanted to tell him; everybody began.
            But Billy Stevens, the barkeeper, called the house to order, and said one at a time was
            best. He distributed the drinks, and appointed Ferguson to lead. Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e758">"Well, he's a boy. And that is just about all we know about him. You can pump him till
            you are tired; it ain't any use; you won't get anything. At least about his intentions,
            or line of business, or where he's from, and such things as that. And as for getting at
            the nature and get-up of his main big chief mystery, why, he'll just change the subject,
            that's all. You can <i>guess</i> till you're black in the
            face—it's your privilege—but suppose you do, where do you arrive at?
            Nowhere, as near as I can make out," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e763">"What <i>is</i> his big chief one?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e768">"Sight, maybe. Hearing, maybe. Instinct, maybe. Magic, maybe. Take your
            choice—grownups, twenty-five; children and servants, half price. Now I'll tell you
            what he can do. You can start here, and just disappear; you can go and hide wherever you
            want to, I don't care where it is, nor how far—and he'll go straight and put his
            finger on you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e770">"You don't mean it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e772">"I just do, though. Weather's nothing to him—elemental conditions is nothing to
            him—he don't even take notice of them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e775">"Oh, come! Dark? Rain? Snow? Hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e777">"It's all the same to <i>him.</i> He don't give a damn." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e782">"Oh, <i>say—</i>including <i>fog,</i> per'aps?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e790"><i>"Fog!</i> he's got an eye 't can plunk through it like a bullet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e794">"Now, boys, honor bright, what's he giving me?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e796">"It's a fact!" they all shouted. "Go on, Wells-Fargo." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e798">"Well, sir, you can leave him here, chatting with the boys, and you can slip out and go
            to any cabin in this camp and open a book—yes, sir, a dozen of them—and take
            the page in your memory, and he'll start out and go straight to that cabin and open
            every one of them books at the right page, and call it off, and never make a mistake." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e800">"He must be the devil!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e802">"More than one has thought it. Now I'll tell you a perfectly wonderful thing that he
            done. The other night he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e804">There was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside, the door flew open, and an excited
            crowd burst in, with the camp's one white woman in the lead and crying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e806">"My child! my child! she's lost and gone! For the love of God help me to find Archy
            Stillman; we've hunted everywhere!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e809">Said the barkeeper: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e811">"Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, and don't worry. He asked for a bed three hours ago,
            tuckered out tramping the trails the way he's always doing, and went up-stairs. Ham
            Sandwich, run up and roust him out; he's in No. 14." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e813">The youth was soon down-stairs and ready. He asked Mrs. Hogan for particulars. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e815">"Bless you, dear, there ain't any; I wish there was. I put her to sleep at seven in the
            evening, and when I went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself, she was gone. I
            rushed for your cabin, dear, and you wasn't there, and I've hunted for you ever since,
            at every cabin down the gulch, and now I've come up again, and I'm that distracted and
            scared and heartbroke; but, thanks to God, I've found you at last, dear heart, and
            you'll find my child. Come on! come quick!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e817">"Move right along; I'm with you, madam. Go to your cabin first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e819">The whole company streamed out to join the hunt. All the southern half of the village
            was up, a hundred men strong, and waiting outside, a vague dark mass sprinkled with
            twinkling lanterns. The mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself
            to the narrow road, and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders. In a
            few minutes the Hogan cabin was reached. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e821">"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Hogan; "there's where she was; it's where I laid her at
            seven o'clock; but where she is now, God only knows." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e823">"Hand me a lantern," said Archy. He set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it,
            pretending to examine the ground closely. "Here's her track," he said, touching the
            ground here and there and yonder with his finger. "Do you see?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e825">Several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see. One or two
            thought they discerned something like a track; the others shook their heads and
            confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp
            enough to discover. One said, "Maybe a child's foot could make a mark on it, but <i>I</i> don't see how." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e830">Young Stillman stepped outside, held the light to the ground, turned leftward, and
            moved three steps, closely examining; then said, "I've got the direction—come
            along; take the lantern, somebody." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e832">He strode off swiftly southward, the files following, swaying and bending in and out
            with the deep curves of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the mouth of the gorge was reached;
            before them stretched the sagebrush plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman called a halt,
            saying, "We mustn't start wrong, now; we must take the direction again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e835">He took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards; then said,
            "Come on; it's all right," and gave up the lantern. In and out among the sage-bushes he
            marched, a quarter of a mile, bearing gradually to the right; then took a new direction
            and made another great semicircle; then changed again and moved due west nearly half a
            mile—and stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e837">"She gave it up, here, poor little chap. Hold the lantern. You can see where she sat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e839">But this was in a slick alkali flat which was surfaced like steel, and no person in the
            party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a
            cushion on a veneer like that. The bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the
            spot, lamenting. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e841">"But where is she, then?" some one said. "She didn't stay here. We can see <i>that</i> much, anyway." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e846">Stillman moved about in a circle around the place, with the lantern, pretending to hunt
            for tracks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e848">"Well!" he said presently, in an annoyed tone, "I don't understand it." He examined
            again. "No use. She was here—that's certain; she never <i>walked</i> away from here—and that's certain. It's a puzzle; I can't make it
            out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e853">The mother lost heart then. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e855">"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! some flying beast has got her. I'll never see her
            again!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e857">"Ah, <i>don't</i> give up," said Archy. "We'll find her—don't
            give up." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e862">"God bless you for the words, Archy Stillman!" and she seized his hand and kissed it
            fervently. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e864">Peterson, the new-comer, whispered satirically in Ferguson's ear: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e867">"Wonderful performance to find this place, wasn't it? Hardly worth while to come so
            far, though; any other supposititious place would have answered just as well—hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e869">Ferguson was not pleased with the innuendo. He said, with some warmth: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e871">"Do you mean to insinuate that the child hasn't been here? I tell you the child <i>has</i> been here! Now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a
            little fuss as—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e876">"All right!" sang out Stillman. "Come, everybody, and look at this! It was right under
            our noses all the time, and we didn't see it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e878">There was a general plunge for the ground at the place where the child was alleged to
            have rested, and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to see the thing that Archy's finger
            was resting upon. There was a pause, then a several-barreled sigh of disappointment. Pat
            Riley and Ham Sandwich said, in the one breath: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e880">"What is it, Archy? There's nothing here." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e882">"Nothing? Do you call <i>that</i> nothing?" and he swiftly traced upon
            the ground a form with his finger. "There—don't you recognize it now? It's Injun
            Billy's track. He's got the child." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e887">"God be praised !" from the mother. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e889">"Take away the lantern. I've got the direction. Follow!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e891">He started on a run, racing in and out among the sage-bushes a matter of three hundred
            yards, and disappeared over a sand-wave; the others struggled after him, caught him up,
            and found him waiting. Ten steps away was a little wickiup, a dim and formless shelter
            of rags and old horse-blankets, a dull light showing through its chinks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e893">"You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the lad. "It's your privilege to be first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e896">All followed the sprint she made for the wickiup, and saw, with her, the picture its
            interior afforded. Injun Billy was sitting on the ground; the child was asleep beside
            him. The mother hugged it with a wild embrace, which included Archy Stillman, the
            grateful tears running down her face, and in a choked and broken voice she poured out a
            golden stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments which has its home in full
            richness nowhere but in the Irish heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e898">"I find her bymeby it is ten o'clock," Billy explained. "She 'sleep out yonder, ve'y
            tired—face wet, been cryin', 'spose; fetch her home, feed her, she heap much
            hungry—go 'sleep 'gin." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e900">In her limitless gratitude the happy mother waived rank and hugged him too, calling him
            "the angel of God in disguise." And he probably was in disguise if he was that kind of
            an official. He was dressed for the character. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e902">At half past one in the morning the procession burst into the village singing, "When
            Johnny Comes Marching Home," waving its lanterns and swallowing the drinks that were
            brought out all along its course. It concentrated at the tavern, and made a night of
            what was left of the morning.</p>Chapter VI<p id="TwaDoubd1e907">The next afternoon the village was electrified with an immense sensation. A grave and
            dignified foreigner of distinguished bearing and appearance had arrived at the tavern,
            and entered this formidable name upon the register: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e909">SHERLOCK HOLMES
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e913">The news buzzed from cabin to cabin, from claim to claim; tools were dropped, and the
            town swarmed toward the center of interest. A man passing out at the northern end of the
            village shouted it to Pat Riley, whose claim was the next one to Flint Buckner's. At
            that time Fetlock Jones seemed to turn sick. He muttered to himself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e915">"Uncle <i>Sherlock!</i> The mean luck of it!—that <i>he </i>should come just when..." He dropped into a reverie, and
            presently said to himself: "But what's the use of being afraid of <i>him?
            </i>Anybody that knows him the way I do knows he can't detect a crime except where he
            plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and hires some fellow to commit it
            according to instructions.... Now there ain't going to <i>be</i> any
            clues this time—so, what show has he got? None at all. No, sir; everything's
            ready. If I was to risk putting it off—...No, I won't run any risk like that.
            Flint Buckner goes out of this world to-night, for sure." Then another trouble presented
            itself. "Uncle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening, and
            how am I going to get rid of him? for I've <i>got</i> to be at my cabin
            a minute or two about eight o'clock." This was an awkward matter, and cost him much
            thought. But he found a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll go for a walk, and I'll leave
            him in the road a minute, so that he won't see what it is I do: the best way to throw a
            detective off the track, anyway, is to have him along when you are preparing the thing.
            Yes, that's the safest—I'll take him with me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e932">Meantime the road in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping
            for a glimpse of the great man. But he kept his room, and did not appear. None but
            Ferguson, Jake Parker the blacksmith, and Ham Sandwich had any luck. These enthusiastic
            admirers of the great scientific detective hired the tavern's detained-baggage lockup,
            which looked into the detective's room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide,
            ambushed themselves in it, and cut some peep-holes in the window-blind. Mr. Holmes's
            blinds were down; but by and by he raised them. It gave the spies a hair-lifting but
            pleasurable thrill to find themselves face to face with the Extraordinary Man who had
            filled the world with the fame of his more than human ingenuities. There he
            sat—not a myth, not a shadow, but real, alive, compact of substance, and almost
            within touching distance with the hand. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e934">"Look at that head!" said Ferguson, in an awed voice. "By gracious! <i>that's</i> a head!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e939">"You bet!" said the blacksmith, with deep reverence. "Look at his nose! look at his
            eyes! Intellect? Just a battery of it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e941">"And that paleness," said Ham Sandwich. "Comes from thought—that's what it comes
            from. Hell! duffers like us don't know what real thought <i>is."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e946">"No more we don't," said Ferguson. "What we take for thinking is just
            blubber-and-slush," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e948">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo. And look at that frown—that's <i>deep</i> thinking—away down, down, forty fathom into the bowels of things.
            He's on the track of something." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e954">"Well, he is, and don't you forget it. Say—look at that awful gravity—look
            at that pallid solemness—there ain't any corpse can lay over it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e956">"No, sir, not for dollars! And it's his'n by hereditary rights, too; he's been dead
            four times a'ready, and there's history for it. Three times natural, once by accident.
            I've heard say he smells damp and cold, like a grave. And he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e958">" 'Sh! Watch him! There—he's got his thumb on the bump on the near corner of his
            forehead, and his forefinger on the off one. His think-works is just a-<i>grinding</i> now, you bet your other shirt." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e963">"That's so. And now he's gazing up toward heaven and stroking his mustache slow,
            and—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e965">"Now he has rose up standing, and is putting his clues together on his left fingers
            with his right finger. See? he touches the forefinger—now middle finger—now
            ring-finger—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e967">"Stuck!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e969">"Look at him scowl! He can't seem to make out <i>that</i> clue. So
            he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e974">"See him smile!—like a tiger—and tally off the other fingers like nothing!
            He's got it, boys; he's got it sure!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e976">"Well, I should <i>say!</i> I'd hate to be in that man's place that
            he's after." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e981">Mr. Holmes drew a table to the window, sat down with his back to the spies, and
            proceeded to write. The spies withdrew their eyes from the peep-holes, lit their pipes,
            and settled themselves for a comfortable smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with conviction: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e983">"Boys, it's no use talking, he's a wonder! He's got the signs of it all over him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e986">"You hain't ever said a truer word than that, Wells-Fargo," said Jake Parker. "Say,
            wouldn't it 'a' been nuts if he'd a-been here last night?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e988">"Oh, by George, but wouldn't it!" said Ferguson. "Then we'd have seen <i>scientific</i> work. Intellect—just pure intellect—away up on the upper
            levels, dontchuknow. Archy is all right, and it don't become anybody to belittle <i>him,</i> I can tell you. But his gift is only just eyesight, sharp as
            an owl's, as near as I can make it out just a grand natural animal talent, no more, no
            less, and prime as far as it goes, but no intellect in it, and for awfulness and
            marvelousness no more to be compared to what this man does than—than—Why,
            let me tell you what <i>he'd</i> have done. He'd have stepped over to
            Hogan's and glanced—just <i>glanced,</i> that's all—at the
            premises, and that's enough. See everything? Yes, sir, to the last little detail; and
            he'll know more about that place than the Hogans would know in seven years. Next, he
            would sit down on the bunk, just as ca'm, and say to Mrs. Hogan—<i>Say,</i> Ham, consider that you are Mrs. Hogan. I'll ask the questions; you answer
            them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1005">"All right; go on." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1007">" 'Madam, if you please—attention—do not let your mind wander. Now,

Teeth?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1017">" 'Five, your Honor, and one a-coming.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1019">" 'Very good, very good, <i>very</i> good, indeed.' You see, boys, <i>he</i> knows a clue when he sees it, when it wouldn't mean a dern thing
            to anybody else. 'Stockings, madam? Shoes?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1027">" 'Yes, your Honor—both.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1030">" 'Yarn, perhaps? Morocco?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1032">" 'Yarn, your Honor. And kip.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1034">" 'Um—kip. This complicates the matter. However, let it go—we shall manage.

            wool—foreign make. Very well. A snip from some garment of the child's, please.
            Thanks. Cotton. Shows wear. An excellent clue, excellent. Pass me a pallet of the floor
            dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, many thanks. Ah, admirable, admirable! <i>Now</i> we know where we are, I think.' You see, boys, he's got all the
            clues he wants now; he don't need anything more. Now, then, what does this Extraordinary
            Man do? He lays those snips and that dirt out on the table and leans over them on his
            elbows, and puts them together side by side and studies them—mumbles to himself,
            'Female'; changes them around—mumbles, 'Six years old'; changes them this way and
            that—again mumbles: 'Five teeth—one
            a-coming—Catholic—yarn—cotton—kip—damn that kip.' Then he
            straightens up and gazes toward heaven, and plows his hands through his hair—plows
            and plows, muttering, 'Damn that kip!' Then he stands up and frowns, and begins to tally
            off his clues on his fingers—and gets stuck at the ring-finger. But only just a
            minute—then his face glares all up in a smile like a house afire, and he
            straightens up stately and majestic, and says to the crowd, 'Take a lantern, a couple of
            you, and go down to Injun Billy's and fetch the child—the rest of you go 'long
            home to bed; good-night, madam; good-night, gents.' And he bows like the Matterhorn, and
            pulls out for the tavern. That's <i>his</i> style, and the <i>Only—</i>scientific, intellectual—all over in fifteen
            minutes—no poking around all over the sage-brush range an hour and a half in a

          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1055">"By Jackson, it's grand!" said Ham Sandwich. "Wells-Fargo, you've got him down to a
            dot. He ain't painted up any exacter to the life in the books. By George, I can juse <i>see</i> him—can't you, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1060">"You bet you! It's just a photograft, that's what it is." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1062">Ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success, and grateful. He sat silently
            enjoying his happiness a little while, then he murmured, with a deep awe in his voice, </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1064">"I wonder if God made him?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1066">There was no response for a moment; then Ham Sandwich said, reverently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1068">"Not all at one time, I reckon."</p>Chapter VII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1073">At eight o'clock that evening two persons were groping their way past Flint Buckner's
            cabin in the frosty gloom. They were Sherlock Holmes and his nephew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1075">"Stop here in the road a moment, uncle," said Fetlock, "while I run to my cabin; I
            won't be gone a minute." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1077">He asked for something—the uncle furnished it—then he disappeared in the
            darkness, but soon returned, and the talking-walk was resumed. By nine o'clock they had
            wandered back to the tavern. They worked their way through the billiard-room, where a
            crowd had gathered in the hope of getting a glimpse of the Extraordinary Man. A royal
            cheer was raised. Mr. Holmes acknowledged the compliment with a series of courtly bows,
            and as he was passing out his nephew said to the assemblage: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1079">"Uncle Sherlock's got some work to do, gentlemen, that 'll keep him till twelve or one;
            but he'll be down again then, or earlier if he can, and hopes some of you'll be left to
            take a drink with him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1081">"By George, he's just a duke, boys! Three cheers for Sherlock Holmes, the greatest man
            that ever lived!" shouted Ferguson. "Hip, hip, hip—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1083">"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Tiger!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1085">The uproar shook the building, so hearty was the feeling the boys put into their
            welcome. Up-stairs the uncle reproached the nephew gently, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1087">"What did you get me into that engagement for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1089">"I reckon you don't want to be unpopular, do you, uncle? Well, then, don't you put on
            any exclusiveness in a mining-camp, that's all. The boys admire you; but if you was to
            leave without taking a drink with them, they'd set you down for a snob. And besides, you
            said you had home talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1091">The boy was right, and wise—the uncle acknowledged it. The boy was wise in
            another detail which he did not mention—except to himself: "Uncle and the others
            will come handy—in the way of nailing an <i>alibi </i>where it
            can't be budged." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1097">He and his uncle talked diligently about three hours. Then, about midnight, Fetlock
            stepped down-stairs and took a position in the dark a dozen steps from the tavern, and
            waited. Five minutes later Flint Buckner came rocking out of the billiard-room and
            almost brushed him as he passed. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1099">"I've <i>got</i> him!" muttered the boy. He continued to himself,
            looking after the shadowy form: "Good-by—good-by for good, Flint Buckner; you
            called my mother a—well, never mind what: it's all right, now; you're taking your
            last walk, friend." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1104">He went musing back into the tavern. "From now till one is an hour. We'll spend it with
            the boys; it's good for the <i>alibi."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1109">He brought Sherlock Holmes to the billiard-room, which was jammed with eager and
            admiring miners; the guest called the drinks, and the fun began. Everybody was happy;
            everybody was complimentary; the ice was soon broken, songs, anecdotes, and more drinks
            followed, and the pregnant minutes flew. At six minutes to one, when the jollity was at
            its highest— </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1111"><i>Boom!</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1115">There was silence instantly. The deep sound came rolling and rumbling frown peak to
            peak up the gorge, then died down, and ceased. The spell broke, then, and the men made a
            rush for the door, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1117">"Something's blown up!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1119">Outside, a voice in the darkness said, "It's away down the gorge; I saw the flash." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1121">The crowd poured down the cañon—Holmes, Fetlock, Archy Stillman,
            everybody. They made the mile in a few minutes. By the light of a lantern they found the
            smooth and solid dirt floor of Flint Buckner's cabin; of the cabin itself not a vestige
            remained, not a rag nor a splinter. Nor any sign of Flint. Search-parties sought here
            and there and yonder, and presently a cry went up. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1123">"Here he is!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1125">It was true. Fifty yards down the gulch they had found him—that is, they had
            found a crushed and lifeless mass which represented him. Fetlock Jones hurried thither
            with the others and looked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1128">The inquest was a fifteen-minute affair. Ham Sandwich, foreman of the jury, handed up
            the verdict, which was phrased with a certain unstudied literary grace, and closed with
            this finding, to wit: that "deceased came to his death by his own act or some other
            person or persons unknown to this jury not leaving any family or similar effects behind
            but his cabin which was blown away and God have mercy on his soul amen." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1130">Then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd, for the storm-center of interest was
            there—Sherlock Holmes. The miners stood silent and reverent in a half-circle,
            inclosing a large vacant space which included the front exposure of the site of the late
            premises. In this considerable space the Extraordinary Man was moving about, attended by
            his nephew with a lantern. With a tape he took measurements of the cabin site; of the
            distance from the wall of chaparral to the road; of the height of the chaparral bushes;
            also various other measurements. He gathered a rag here, a splinter there, and a pinch
            of earth yonder, inspected them profoundly, and preserved them. He took the "lay" of the
            place with a pocket-compass, allowing two seconds for magnetic variation. He took the
            time (Pacific) by his watch, correcting it for local time. He paced off the distance
            from the cabin site to the corpse, and corrected that for tidal differentiation. He took
            the altitude with a pocket-aneroid, and the temperature with a pocket-thermometer.
            Finally he said, with a stately bow: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1132">"It is finished. Shall we return, gentlemen?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1134">He took up the line of march for the tavern, and the crowd fell into his wake,
            earnestly discussing and admiring the Extraordinary Man, and interlarding guesses as to
            the origin of the tragedy and who the author of it might he. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1136">"My, but it's grand luck having him here—hey, boys?" said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1138">"It's the biggest thing of the century," said Ham Sandwich. "It 'll go all over the
            world; you mark my words." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1140"><i>"You</i> bet!" said Jake Parker, the blacksmith. "It 'll boom this
            camp. Ain't it so, Wells-Fargo?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1144">"Well, as you want my opinion—if it's any sign of how <i>I
            </i>think about it, I can tell you this: yesterday I was holding the Straight Flush
            claim at two dollars a foot; I'd like to see the man that can get it at sixteen to-day." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1149">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo! It's the grandest luck a new camp ever struck. Say, did
            you see him collar them little rags and dirt and things? What an eye! He just can't
            overlook a clue—'tain't <i>in </i>him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1154">"That's so. And they wouldn't mean a thing to anybody else; but to him, why, they're
            just a book—large print at that." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1156">"Sure's you're born! Them odds and ends have got their little old secret, and they
            think there ain't anybody can pull it; but, land! when he sets his grip there they've
            got to squeal, and don't you forget it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1159">"Boys, I ain't sorry, now, that he wasn't here to roust out the child; this is a bigger
            thing, by a long sight. Yes, sir, and more tangled up and scientific and intellectual." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1161">"I reckon we're all of us glad it's turned out this way. Glad? 'George! it ain't any
            name for it. Dontchuknow, Archy could 've <i>learnt</i> something if
            he'd had the nous to stand by and take notice of how that man works the system. But no;
            he went poking up into the chaparral and just missed the whole thing." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1166">"It's true as gospel; I seen it myself. Well, Archy's young. He'll know better one of
            these days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1168">"Say, boys, who do you reckon done it?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1170">That was a difficult question, and brought out a world of unsatisfying conjecture.
            Various men were mentioned as possibilities, but one by one they were discarded as not
            being eligible. No one but young Hillyer had been intimate with Flint Buckner; no one
            had really had a quarrel with him; he had affronted every man who had tried to make up
            to him, although not quite offensively enough to require bloodshed. There was one name
            that was upon every tongue from the start, but it <i>was</i> the last to
            get utterance—Fetlock Jones's. It was Pat Riley that mentioned it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1175">"Oh, well," the boys said, "of course we've all thought of him, because he had a
            million rights to kill Flint Buckner, and it was just his plain duty to do it. But all
            the same there's two things we can't get around: for one thing, he hasn't got the sand;
            and for another, he wasn't anywhere near the place when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1177">"I know it," said Pat. "He was there in the billiard-room with us when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1179">"Yes, and was there all the time for an hour <i>before</i> it
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1184">"It's so. And lucky for him, too. He'd have been suspected in a minute if it hadn't
            been for that."</p>Chapter VIII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1189">The tavern dining-room had been cleared of all its furniture save one six-foot pine
            table and a chair. This table was against one end of the room; the chair was on it;
            Sherlock Holmes, stately, imposing, impressive, sat in the chair. The public stood. The
            room was full. The tobacco-smoke was dense, the stillness profound. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1191">The Extraordinary Man raised his hand to command additional silence; held it in the air
            a few moments; then, in brief, crisp terms he put forward question after question, and
            noted the answers with "Um-ums," nods of the head, and so on. By this process he learned
            all about Flint Buckner, his character, conduct, and habits, that the people were able
            to tell him. It thus transpired that the Extraordinary Man's nephew was the only person
            in the camp who had a killing-grudge against Flint Buckner. Mr. Holmes smiled
            compassionately upon the witness, and asked, languidly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1193">"Do any of you gentlemen chance to know where the lad Fetlock Jones was at the time of
            the explosion?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1195">A thunderous response followed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1197">"In the billiard-room of this house!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1199">"Ah. And had he just come in?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1201">"Been there all of an hour!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1203">"Ah. It is about—about—well, about how far might it be to the scene of the
            explosions" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1205">"All of a mile!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1207">"Ah. It isn't <i>much</i> of an alibi, 'tis true, but—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1213">A storm-burst of laughter, mingled with shouts of "By jiminy, but he's
            chain-lightning!" and "Ain't you sorry you spoke, Sandy?" shut off the rest of the
            sentence, and the crushed witness drooped his blushing face in pathetic shame. The
            inquisitor resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1215">"The lad Jones's somewhat <i>distant</i> connection with the case"
              (laughter<i>) "</i>having been disposed of, let us now call the
            eye-witnesses of the tragedy, and listen to what they have to say." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1223">He got out his fragmentary clues and arranged them on a sheet of cardboard on his knee.
            The house held its breath and watched. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1225">"We have the longitude and the latitude, corrected for magnetic variation, and this
            gives us the exact location of the tragedy. We have the altitude, the temperature, and
            the degree of humidity prevailing—inestimably valuable, since they enable us to
            estimate with precision the degree of influence which they would exercise upon the mood
            and disposition of the assassin at that time of the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1227"><i>(Buzz of admiration; muttered remark, "By George, but he's
              deep.")</i> He fingered his clues. "And now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak
            to us. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1231">"Here we have an empty linen shot-bag. What is its message? This: that robbery was the
            motive, not revenge. What is its further message? This: that the assassin was of
            inferior intelligence—shall we say light-witted, or perhaps approaching that? How
            do we know this? Because a person of sound intelligence would not have proposed to rob
            the man Buckner, who never had much money with him. But the assassin might have been a
            stranger? Let the bag speak again. I take from it this article. It is a bit of
            silver-bearing quartz. It is peculiar. Examine it, please—you—and
            you—and you. Now pass it back, please. There is but one lode on this coast which
            produces just that character and color of quartz; and that is a lode which crops out for
            nearly two miles on a stretch, and in my opinion is destined, at no distant day, to
            confer upon its locality a globe-girdling celebrity, and upon its two hundred owners
            riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Name that lode, please." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1233">"The Consolidated Christian Science and Mary Ann!" was the prompt response. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1235">A wild crash of hurrahs followed, and every man reached for his neighbor's hand and
            wrung it, with tears in his eyes; and Wells-Fargo Ferguson shouted, "The Straight Flush
            is on the lode, and up she goes to a hunched and fifty a foot—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1240">When quiet fell, Mr. Holmes resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1242">"We perceive, then, that three facts are established, to wit: the assassin was
            approximately light-witted; he was not a stranger; his motive was robbery, not revenge.
            Let us proceed. I hold in my hand a small fragment of fuse, with the recent smell of
            fire upon it. What is its testimony? Taken with the corroborative evidence of the
            quartz, it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner. What does it tell us further?
            This, gentlemen: that the assassination was consummated by means of an explosive. What
            else does it say? This: that the explosive was located against the side of the cabin
            nearest the road—the front side—for within six feet of that spot I found it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1244">"I hold in my fingers a burnt Swedish match—the kind one rubs on a safety-box. I
            found it in the road, six hundred and twenty-two feet from the abolished cabin. What
            does it say? This: that the train was fired from that point. What further does it tell
            us? This: that the assassin was left-handed. How do I know this? I should not be able to
            explain to you, gentlemen, how I know it, the signs being so subtle that only long
            experience and deep study can enable one to detect them. But the signs are here, and
            they are reinforced by a fact which you must have often noticed in the great detective
            narratives—that <i>all </i>assassins are left-handed." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1250">"By Jackson, <i>that's</i> so." said Ham Sandwich, bringing his great
            hand down with a resounding slap upon his thigh; "blamed if I ever thought of it
            before." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1255">"Nor I!" "Nor I!" cried several. "Oh, there can't anything escape <i>him—</i>look at his eye!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1260">"Gentlemen, distant as the murderer was from his doomed victim, he did not wholly
            escape injury. This fragment of wood which I now exhibit to you struck him. It drew
            blood. Wherever he is, he bears the telltale mark. I picked it up where he stood when he
            fired the fatal train," He looked out over the house from his high perch, and his
            countenance began to darken; he slowly raised his hand, and pointed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1262">"There stands the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1264">For a moment the house was paralyzed with amazement; then twenty voices burst out with: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1266">"Sammy Hillyer? Oh, <i>hell,</i> no! <i>Him?</i> It's
            pure foolishness!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1274">"Take care, gentlemen—be not hasty. Observe—he has the blood-mark on his
            brow." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1276">Hillyer turned white with fright. He was near to crying. He turned this way and that,
            appealing to every face for help and sympathy; and held out his supplicating hands
            toward Holmes and began to plead: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1278"><i>"Don't,</i> oh, don't! I never did it; I give my word I never did
            it. The way I got this hurt on my forehead was—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1282">"Arrest him, constable!" cried Holmes. "I will swear out the warrant" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1284">The constable moved reluctantly forward—hesitated—stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1287">Hillyer broke out with another appeal. "Oh, Archy, don't let them do it; it would kill
            mother! <i>You</i> know how I got the hurt. Tell them, and save me,
            Archy; save me!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1292">Stillman worked his way to the front, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1294">"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be afraid." Then he said to the house, "Never mind how he
            got the hurt; it hasn't anything to do with this case, and isn't of any consequence." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1296">"God bless you, Archy, for a true friend!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1298">"Hurrah for Archy! Go in, boy, and play 'em a knock-down flush to their two pair 'n' a
            jack!" shouted the house, pride in their home talent and a patriotic sentiment of
            loyalty to it rising suddenly in the public heart and changing the whole attitude of the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1300">Young Stillman waited for the noise to cease; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1302">"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand by that door yonder, and Constable Harris to stand by
            the other one here, and not let anybody leave the room. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1304">"Said and done. Go on, old man!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1306">"The criminal is present, I believe. I will show him to you before long, in case I am
            right in my guess. Now I will tell you all about the tragedy, from start to finish. The
            motive <i>wasn't </i>robbery; it was revenge. The murderer <i>wasn't</i> light-witted. He <i>didn't</i> stand six
            hundred and twenty-two feet away. He <i>didn't </i>get hit with a piece
            of wood. He <i>didn't</i> place the explosive against the cabin. He <i>didn't</i> bring a shot-bag with him, and he <i>wasn't</i> left-handed. With the exception of these errors, the distinguished
            guest's statement of the case is substantially correct." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1330">A comfortable laugh rippled over the house; friend nodded to friend, as much as to say,
            "That's the word, with the bark <i>on</i> it. Good lad, good boy. <i>He</i> ain't lowering his flag any!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1338">The guest's serenity was not disturbed. Stillman resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1341">"I also have some witnesses; and I will presently tell you where you can find some
            more." He held up a piece of coarse wire; the crowd craned their necks to see. "It has a
            smooth coating of melted tallow on it. And here is a candle which is burned half-way
            down. The remaining half of it has marks cut upon it an inch apart. Soon I will tell you
            where I found these things. I will now put aside reasonings, guesses, the impressive
            hitchings of odds and ends of clues together, and the other showy theatricals of the
            detective trade, and tell you in a plain, straightforward way just how this dismal thing
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1343">He paused a moment, for effect—to allow silence and suspense to intensify and
            concentrate the house's interest; then he went on: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1345">"The assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains. It was a good plan, very
            ingenious, and showed an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. It was a plan which was
            well calculated to ward off all suspicion from its inventor. In the <i>first</i> place, he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart, and lit it and timed
            it. He found it took three hours to burn four inches of it. I tried it myself for half
            an hour, awhile ago, up-stairs here, while the inquiry into Flint Buckner's character
            and ways was being conducted in this room, and I arrived in that way at the rate of a
            candle's consumption when sheltered from the wind. Having proved his trial candle's
            rate, he blew it out—I have already shown it to you—and put <i>his</i> inch-marks on a fresh one. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1353">"He put the fresh one into a tin candlestick. Then at the five-hour mark he bored a
            hole through the candle with a red-hot wire. I have already shown you the wire, with a
            smooth coat of tallow on it—tallow that had been melted and had cooled. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1355">"With labor—very hard labor, I should say—he struggled up through the stiff
            chaparral that clothes the steep hillside back of Flint Buckner's place, tugging an
            empty flour-barrel with him. He placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place, and in
            the bottom of it he set the candlestick. Then he measured off about thirty-five feet of
            fuse—the barrel's distance from the back of the cabin. He bored a hole in the side
            of the barrel—here is the large gimlet he did it with. He went on and finished his
            work; and when it was done, one end of the fuse was in Buckner's cabin, and the other
            end, with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder, was in the hole in the
            candle—timed to blow the place up at one o'clock this morning, provided the candle
            was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening—which I am betting it was—and
            provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the
            fuse—which I am also betting there was, though I can't prove it. Boys, the barrel
            is there in the chaparral, the candle's remains are in it in the tin stick; the
            burnt-out fuse is in the gimlet-hole, the other end is down the hill where the late
            cabin stood. I saw them all an hour or two ago, when the Professor here was measuring
            off unimplicated vacancies and collecting relics that hadn't anything to do with the
            case." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1357">He paused. The house drew a long, deep breath, shook its strained cords and muscles
            free and burst into cheers. "Dang him!" said Ham Sandwich, "that's why he was snooping
            around in the chaparral, instead of picking up points out of the P'fessor's game. Looky
            here—he ain't no fool, boys." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1359">"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1361">But Stillman was resuming: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1363">"While we were out yonder an hour or two ago, the owner of the gimlet and the trial
            candle took them from a place where he had concealed them—it was not a good
            place—and carried them to what he probably thought was a better one, two hundred
            yards up in the pine woods, and hid them there, covering them over with pine needles. It
            was there that I found them. The gimlet exactly fits the hole in the barrel. And
            now—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1365">The Extraordinary Man interrupted him. He said, sarcastically: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1367">"We have had a very pretty fairy tale, gentlemen—very pretty indeed. Now I would
            like to ask this young man a question or two." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1370">Some of the boys winced, and Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1372">"I'm afraid Archy's going to catch it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1374">The others lost their smiles and sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1376">"Let us proceed to examine into this fairy tale in a consecutive and orderly
            way—by geometrical progression, so to speak—linking detail to detail in a
            steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent and unassailable march upon this tinsel
            toy fortress of error, the dream fabric of a callow imagination. To begin with, young
            sir, I desire to ask you but three questions at present—<i>at
              present.</i> Did I understand you to say it was your opinion that the supposititious
            candle was lighted at about eight o'clock yesterday evening?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1381">"Yes, sir—about eight." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1383">"Could you say exactly eight?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1385">"Well, no, I couldn't be that exact." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1387">"Um. If a person had been passing along there just about that time, he would have been
            almost sure to encounter that assassin, do you think?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1389">"Yes, I should think so." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1391">"Thank you, that is all. For the present. I say, all <i>for the
              present."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1396">"Dern him. he's laying for Archy," said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1399">"It's so," said Ham Sandwich. "I don't like the look of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1401">Stillman said, glancing at the guest, "I was along there myself at half-past
            eight—no, about nine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1403">"In-deed? This is interesting—this is very interesting. Perhaps you encountered
            the assassin?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1405">"No, I encountered no one." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1407">"Ah. Then—if you will excuse the remark—I do not quite see the relevancy of
            the information." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1409">"It has none. At present. I say it has none—at present." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1411">He paused. Presently he resumed: "I did not encounter the assassin, but I am on his
            track, I am sure, for I believe he is in this room. I will ask you all to pass one by
            one in front of me—here, where there is a good light—so that I can see your
            feet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1413">A buzz of excitement swept the place, and the march began, the guest looking on with an
            iron attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified success. Stillman stooped, shaded
            his eyes with his hand, and gazed down intently at each pair of feet as it passed. Fifty
            men tramped monotonously by—with no result. Sixty. Seventy. The thing was
            beginning to look absurd. The guest remarked, with suave irony:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1415">"Stillman Accuses Sherlock Holmes"Image of Stillman pointing a finger at Sherlock Holmes</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1421">"Assassins appear to be scarce this evening." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1423">The house saw the humor if it, and refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. Ten or twelve
            more candidates tramped by—no, <i>danced </i>by, with airy and
            ridiculous capers which convulsed the spectators—then suddenly Stillman put out
            his hand and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1429">"This is the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1431">"Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhedrim!" roared the crowd; and at once let fly a
            pyrotechnic explosion and dazzle and confusion of stirring remarks inspired by the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1433">At the height of the turmoil the guest stretched out his hand, commanding peace. The
            authority of a great name and a great personality laid its mysterious compulsion upon
            the house, and it obeyed. Out of the panting calm which succeeded, the guest spoke,
            saying, with dignity and feeling: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1435"><i>"This</i> is serious. It strikes at an innocent life. Innocent
            beyond suspicion! Innocent beyond peradventure! Hear me <i>prove</i> it;
            observe how simple a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie. Listen. My
            friends, that lad was never out of my sight yesterday evening at <i>any</i> time!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1445">It made a deep impression. Men turned their eyes upon Stillman with grave inquiry in
            them. His face brightened, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1447">"I <i>knew</i> there was another one!" He stepped briskly to the table
            and glanced at the guest's feet, then up at his face, and said: "You were <i>with</i> him! You were not fifty steps from him when he lit the candle
            that by and by fired the powder!" <i>(Sensation.) "</i>And what is more,
            you furnished the matches yourself !" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1458">Plainly the guest seemed hit; it looked so to the public. He opened his mouth to speak;
            the words did not come freely. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1460">"This—er—this is insanity—this—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1462">Stillman pressed his evident advantage home. He held up a charred match. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1464">"Here <i>is</i> one of them. I found it in the barrel—and there's
              <i>another</i> one there." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1472">The guest found his voice at once. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1475"><i>"Yes—</i>and put them there yourself!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1479">It was recognized a good shot. Stillman retorted. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1481">"It is <i>wax—</i>a breed unknown to this camp. I am ready to be
            searched for the box. Are you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1486">The guest was staggered this time—the dullest eye could see it. He fumbled with
            his hands; once or twice his lips moved, but the words did not come. The house waited
            and watched, in tense suspense, the stillness adding effect to the situation. Presently
            Stillman said, gently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1488">"We are waiting for your decision." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1490">There was silence again during several moments; then the guest answered, in a low
            voice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1492">"I refuse to be searched." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1494">There was no noisy demonstration, but all about the house one voice after another
            muttered: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1496">"That settles it! He's Archy's meat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1498">What to do now? Nobody seemed to know. It was an embarrassing situation for the
            moment—merely, of course, because matters had taken such a sudden and unexpected
            turn that these unpractised minds were not prepared for it, and had come to a
            standstill, like a stopped clock, under the shock. But after a little the machinery
            began to work again, tentatively, and by twos and threes the men put their heads
            together and privately buzzed over this and that and the other proposition. One of these
            propositions met with much favor; it was, to confer upon the assassin a vote of thanks
            for removing Flint Buckner, and let him go. But the cooler heads opposed it, pointing
            out that addled brains in the Eastern states would pronounce it a scandal, and make no
            end of foolish noise about it. Finally the cool heads got the upper hand, and obtained
            general consent to a proposition of their own; their leader then called the house to
            order and stated it—to this effect: that Fetlock Jones be jailed and put upon
            trial. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1500">The motion was carried. Apparently there was nothing further to do now, and the people
            were glad, for, privately, they were impatient to get out and rush to the scene of the
            tragedy, and see whether that barrel and the other things were really there or not. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1503">But no—the break-up got a check. The surprises were not over yet. For a while
            Fetlock Jones had been silently sobbing, unnoticed in the absorbing excitements which
            had been following one another so persistently for some time; but when his arrest and
            trial were decreed, he broke out despairingly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1505">"No! it's no use. I don't want any jail, I don't want any trial; I've had all the hard
            luck I want, and all the miseries. Hang me now, and let me out! It would all come out,
            anyway—there couldn't anything save me. He has told it all, just as if he'd been
            with me and seen it—<i>I</i> don't know how he found out; and
            you'll find the barrel and things, and then I wouldn't have any chance any more. I
            killed him; and <i>you'd</i> have done it too, if he'd treated you like
            a dog, and you only a boy, and weak and poor, and not a friend to help you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1513">"And served him damned well right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. "Looky here, boys—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1515">From the constable: "Order! Order, gentlemen!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1517">A voice: "Did your uncle know what you was up to?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1519">"No, he didn't." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1521">"Did he give you the matches, sure enough?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1523">"Yes, he did; but he didn't know what I wanted them for." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1525">"When you was out on such a business as that, how did you venture to risk having him
            along—and him a <i>detective?</i> How's that?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1530">The boy hesitated, fumbled with his buttons in an embarrassed way, then said, shyly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1532">"I know about detectives, on account of having them in the family; and if you don't
            want them to find out about a thing, it's best to have them around when you do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1535">The cyclone of laughter which greeted this native discharge of wisdom did not modify
            the poor little waif's embarrassment in any large degree.</p>Chapter IX<p id="TwaDoubd1e1540">From a letter to Mrs. Stillman, dated merely "Tuesday." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1542">Fetlock Jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log cabin, and left there
              to await his trial. Constable Harris provided him with a couple of days' rations,
              instructed him to keep a good guard over himself, and promised to look in on him as
              soon as further supplies should be due. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1545">Next morning a score of us went with Hillyer, out of friendship, and helped him bury
              his late relative, the unlamented Buckner, and I acted as first assistant pall-bearer,
              Hillyer acting as chief. Just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy
              stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, limped by with his head down, and I caught the
              scent I had chased around the globe! It was the odor of Paradise to my perishing hope!
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1548">In a moment I was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder. He
              slumped to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had withered him in his tracks; and
              as the boys came running he struggled to his knees and put up his pleading hands to
              me, and out of his chattering jaws he begged me to persecute him no more, and said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1551">"You have hunted me around the world, Sherlock Holmes, yet God is my witness I have
              never done any man harm!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1554">A glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane. That was my work, mother!
              The tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery I felt in that moment, but
              nothing else can ever do it. The boys lifted him up, and gathered about him, and were
              full of pity of him, and said the gentlest and touchingest things to him, and said
              cheer up and don't be troubled, he was among friends now, and they would take care of
              him, and protect him, and hang any man that laid a hand on him. They are just like so
              many mothers, the rough mining-camp boys are, when you wake up the south side of their
              hearts; yes, and just like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up
              the opposite of that muscle. They did everything they could think of to comfort him,
              but nothing succeeded until Wells-Fargo Ferguson, who is a clever strategist, said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1557">"If it's only Sherlock Holmes that's troubling you, you needn't worry any more."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1560">"Why?" asked the forlorn lunatic, eagerly. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1563">"Because he's dead again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1566">"Dead! Dead! Oh, don't trifle with a poor wreck like me. <i>Is
              </i>he dead? On honor, now—is he telling me true, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1573">"True as you're standing there!" said Ham Sandwich, and they all backed up the
              statement in a body. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1576">"They hung him in San Bernardino last week," added Ferguson, clinching the matter,
              "whilst he was searching around after you. Mistook him for another man. They're sorry,
              but they can't help it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1579">"They're a-building him a monument," said Ham Sandwich, with the air of a person who
              had contributed to it, and knew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1582">"James Walker" drew a deep sigh—evidently a sigh of relief—and said
              nothing; but his eyes lost something of their wildness, his countenance cleared
              visibly, and its drawn look relaxed a little. We all went to our cabin, and the boys
              cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for, and while they
              were about it Hillyer and I outfitted him from hat to shoe-leather with new clothes of
              ours, and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him. "Old" is the right word,
              and a pity, too: old by the droop of him, and the frost upon his hair, and the marks
              which sorrow and distress have left upon his face; though he is only in his prime in
              the matter of years. While he ate, we smoked and chatted; and when he was finishing he
              found his voice at last, and of his own accord broke out with his personal history. I
              cannot furnish his exact words, but I will come as near it as I can. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1585">THE "WRONG MAN'S" STORY </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1588">It happened like this: I was in Denver. I had been there many years; sometimes I
              remember how many, sometimes I don't—but it isn't any matter. All of a sudden I
              got a notice to leave, or I would be exposed for a horrible crime committed long
              before—years and years before—in the East. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1591">I knew about that crime, but I was not the criminal; it was a cousin of mine of the
              same name. What should I better do? My head was all disordered by fear, and I didn't
              know. I was allowed very little time—only one day, I think it was. I would be
              ruined if I was published, and the people would lynch me, and not believe what I said.
              It is always the way with lynchings: when they find out it is a mistake they are
              sorry, but it is too late—the same as it was with Mr. Holmes, you see. So I said
              I would sell out and get money to live on, and run away until it blew over and I could
              come back with my proofs. Then I escaped in the night and went a long way off in the
              mountains somewhere, and lived disguised and had a false name. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1594">I got more and more troubled and worried, and my troubles made me see spirits and
              hear voices, and I could not think straight and clear on any subject, but got confused
              and involved and had to give it up, because my head hurt so. It got to be worse and
              worse; more spirits and more voices. They were about me all the time; at first only in
              the night, then in the day too. They were always whispering around my bed and plotting
              against me, and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out, because I got no good rest.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1597">And then came the worst. One night the whispers said, "We'll never manage, because
              we can't <i>see</i> him, and so can't point him out to the people."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1603">They sighed; then one said: "We must bring Sherlock Holmes. He can be here in twelve
              days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1606">They all agreed, and whispered and jibbered with joy. But my heart broke; for I had
              read about that man, and knew what it would be to have him upon my track, with his
              superhuman penetration and tireless energies. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1610">The spirits went away to fetch him, and I got up at once in the middle of the night
              and fled away, carrying nothing but the hand-bag that had my money in it—thirty
              thousand dollars; two-thirds of it are in the bag there yet. It was forty days before
              that man caught up on my track. I just escaped. From habit he had written his real
              name on a tavern register, but had scratched it out and written "Dagget Barclay" in
              the place of it. But fear gives you a watchful eye and keen, and I read the true name
              through the scratches, and fled like a deer. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1613">He has hunted me all over this world for three years and a half—the Pacific
              states, Australasia, India—everywhere you can think of; then back to Mexico and
              up to California again, giving me hardly any rest; but that name on the registers
              always saved me, and what is left of me is alive yet. And I am <i>so</i> tired! A cruel time he has given me, yet I give you my honor I have never
              harmed him nor any man. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1619">That was the end of the story, and it stirred those boys to bloodheat, he sure of
              it. As for me—each word burnt a hole in me where it struck. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1622">We voted that the old man should bunk with us, and be my guest and Hillyer's. I
              shall keep my own counsel, naturally; but as soon as he is well rested and nourished,
              I shall take him to Denver and rehabilitate his fortunes. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1625">The boys gave the old fellow the bone-smashing good-fellowship handshake of the
              mines, and then scattered away to spread the news. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1628">At dawn next morning Wells-Fargo Ferguson and Ham Sandwich called us softly out, and
              said, privately: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1631">"That news about the way that old stranger has been treated has spread all around,
              and the camps are up. They are piling in from everywhere, and are going to lynch the
              P'fessor. Constable Harris is in a dead funk, and has telephoned the sheriff. Come
              along!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1634">We started on a run. The others were privileged to feel as they chose, but in my
              heart's privacy I hoped the sheriff would arrive in time; for I had small desire that
              Sherlock Holmes should hang for my deeds, as you can easily believe. I had heard a
              good deal about the sheriff, but </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1637">for reassurance's sake I asked: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1640">"Can he stop a mob?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1643">"Can <i>he</i> stop a mob! Can Jack <i>Fairfax</i>
              stop a mob! Well, I should smile! Ex-desperado—nineteen scalps on his string.
              Can <i>he!</i> Oh, I <i>say!"</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1659">As we tore up the gulch, distant cries and shouts and yells rose faintly on the
              still air, and grew steadily in strength as we raced along. Roar after roar burst out,
              stronger and stronger, nearer and nearer; and at last, when we closed up upon the
              multitude massed in the open area in front of the tavern, the crash of sound was
              deafening. Some brutal roughs from Daly's gorge had Holmes in their grip, and he was
              the calmest man there; a contemptuous smile played about his lips, and if any fear of
              death was in his British heart, his iron personality was master of it and no sign of
              it was allowed to appear. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1662">"Come to a vote, men!" This from one of the Daly gang, Shadbelly Higgins. "Quick! is
              it hang, or shoot?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1665">"Neither!" shouted one of his comrades. "He'll he alive again in a week; burning's
              the only permanency for <i>him."</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1671">The gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a thundercrash of approval, and
              went struggling and surging toward the prisoner, and closed around him, shouting,
              "Fire! fire's the ticket!" They dragged him to the horse-post, backed him against it,
              chained him to it, and piled wood and pine cones around him waist-deep. Still the
              strong face did not blench, and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1674">"A match! fetch a match!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1677">Shadbelly struck it, shaded it with his hand, stooped, and held it under a pine
              cone. A deep silence fell upon the mob. The cone caught, a tiny flame flickered about
              it a moment or two. I seemed to catch the sound of distant hoofs—it grew more
              distinct—still more and more distinct, more and more definite, but the absorbed
              crowd did not appear to notice it. The match went out. The man struck another,
              stooped, and again the flame rose; this time it took hold and began to
              spread—here and there men turned away their faces. The executioner stood with
              the charred match in his fingers, watching his work. The hoof-beats turned a
              projecting crag, and now they came thundering down upon us. Almost the next moment
              there was a shout: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1680">"The sheriff!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1683">And straightway he came tearing into the midst, stood his horse almost on his hind
              feet, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1686">"Fall back, you gutter-snipes!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1689">He was obeyed. By all but their leader. He stood his ground, and his hand went to
              his revolver. The sheriff covered him promptly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1692">"Drop your hand, you parlor desperado. Kick the fire away. Now unchain the
              stranger." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1696">The parlor desperado obeyed. Then the sheriff made a speech; sitting his horse at
              martial ease, and not warming his words with any touch of fire, but delivering them in
              a measured and deliberate way, and in a tone which harmonized with their character and
              made them impressively disrespectful. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1699">"You're a nice lot—now ain't you? Just about eligible to travel with this bilk
              here—Shadbelly Higgins—this loud-mouthed sneak that shoots people in the
              back and calls himself a desperado. If there's anything I do particularly despise,
              it's a lynching mob; I've never seen one that had a man in it. It has to tally up a
              hundred against one before it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor. It's
              made up of cowards, and so is the community that breeds it; and ninety-nine times out
              of a hundred the sheriff's another one." He paused—apparently to turn that last
              idea over in his mind and taste the juice of it—then he went on: "The sheriff
              that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the lowest-down coward there is. By
              the statistics there was a hundred and eighty-two of them drawing sneak pay in America
              last year. By the way it's going, pretty soon there 'll be a new disease in the
                doctor-books—<i>sheriff complaint."</i> That idea pleased
              him—any one could see it. "People will say, 'Sheriff sick again?' 'Yes; got the
              same old thing.' And next there 'll be a new title. People won't say, 'He's running
              for sheriff of Rapaho County,' for instance; they'll say, 'He's running for Coward of
              Rapaho.' Lord, the idea of a grown-up person being afraid of a lynch mob!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1705">He turned an eye on the captive, and said, "Stranger, who are you, and what have you
              been doing?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1708">"My name is Sherlock Holmes, and I have not been doing anything." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1711">It was wonderful, the impression which the sound of that name made on the sheriff,
              notwithstanding he must have come posted. He spoke up with feeling, and said it was a
              blot on the county that a man whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their
              fame and their ingenuity, and whose histories of them had won every reader's heart by
              the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting, should be visited under the Stars
              and Stripes by an outrage like this. He apologized in the name of the whole nation,
              and made Holmes a most handsome bow, and told Constable Harris to see him to his
              quarters, and hold himself personally responsible if he was molested again. Then he
              turned to the mob and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1714">"Hunt your holes, you scum!" which they did; then he said: "Follow me, Shadbelly;
              I'll take care of your case myself. No—keep your popgun; whenever I see the day
              that I'll be afraid to have you behind me with that thing, it 'll be time for me to
              join last year's hundred and eighty-two"; and he rode off in a walk, Shadbelly
              following. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1717">When we were on our way back to our cabin, toward breakfast-time, we ran upon the
              news that Fetlock Jones had escaped from his lock-up in the night and is gone! Nobody
              is sorry. Let his uncle track him out if he likes; it is in his line; the camp is not
              interested.</p>Chapter X<p id="TwaDoubd1e1723"><i>Ten days later.</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1728">"James Walker" is all right in body now, and his mind shows improvement too. I start
              with him for Denver to-morrow morning. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1731"><i>Next night. Brief note, mailed at a way-station.</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1736">As we were starting, this morning, Hillyer whispered to me: "Keep this news from

              day—the unhappiest man that has lived in a century—Flint Buckner. His real
              name was Jacob Fuller!" There, mother, by help of me, an unwitting mourner, your
              husband and my father is in his grave.

There has been a
            wedding, between a handsome young man of slender means and a rich young girl—a
            case of love at first sight and a precipitate marriage; a marriage bitterly opposed by
            the girl's widowed father. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e140">Jacob Fuller, the bridegroom, is twenty-six years old, is of an old but unconsidered
            family which had by compulsion emigrated from Sedgemoor, and for King James's purse's
            profit, so everybody said—some maliciously the rest merely because they believed
            it. The bride is nineteen and beautiful. She is intense, high-strung, romantic,
            immeasurably proud of her Cavalier blood, and passionate in her love for her young
            husband. For its sake she braved her father's displeasure, endured his reproaches,
            listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions and went from his house
            without his blessing, proud and happy in the proofs she was thus giving of the quality
            of the affection which had made its home in her heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e142">The morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her. Her husband put aside
            her proffered caresses, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e144">"Sit down. I have something to say to you. I loved you. That was before I asked your
            father to give you to me. His refusal is not my grievance—I could have endured
            that. But the things he said of me to you—that is a different matter.
            There—you needn't speak; I know quite well what they were; I got them from
            authentic sources. Among other things he said that my character was written in my face;
            that I was treacherous, a dissembler, a coward, and a brute without sense of pity or
            compassion: the 'Sedgemoor trade-mark,' he called it—and 'white-sleeve badge.' Any
            other man in my place would have gone to his house and shot him down like a dog. I
            wanted to do it, and was minded to do it, but a better thought came to me: to put him to
            shame; to break his heart; to kill him by inches. How to do it? Through my treatment of
            you, his idol! I would marry you; and then—Have patience. You will see. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e146">From that moment onward, for three months, the young wife suffered all the
            humiliations, all the insults, all the miseries that the diligent and inventive mind of
            the husband could contrive, save physical injuries only. Her strong pride stood by her,
            and she kept the secret of her troubles. Now and then the husband said, "Why don't you
            go to your father and tell him?" Then he invented new tortures, applied them, and asked
            again. She always answered, "He shall never know by my mouth," and taunted him with his
            origin; said she was the lawful slave of a scion of slaves, and must obey, and
            would—up to that point, but no further; he could kill her if he liked, but he
            could not break her; it was not in the Sedgemoor breed to do it. At the end of the three
            months he said, with a dark significance in his manner, "I have tried all things but
            one"—and waited for her reply. "Try that," she said, and curled her lip in
            mockery. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e148">That night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes, then said to her: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e150">"Get up and dress!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e152">She obeyed—as always, without a word. He led her half a mile from the house, and
            proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public road; and succeeded, she
            screaming and struggling. He gagged her then, struck her across the face with his
            cowhide, and set his bloodhounds on her. They tore the clothes off her, and she was
            naked. He called the dogs off, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e154">"You will be found—by the passing public. They will be dropping along about three
            hours from now, and will spread the news—do you hear? Good-by. You have seen the
            last of me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e156">He went away then. She moaned to herself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e159">"I shall bear a child—to <i>him!</i> God grant it may be a boy!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e164">The farmers released her by and by—and spread the news, which was natural. They
            raised the country with lynching intentions, but the bird had flown. The young wife shut
            herself up in her father's house; he shut himself up with her, and thenceforth would see
            no one. His pride was broken, and his heart; so he wasted away, day by day, and even his
            daughter rejoiced when death relieved him. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e166">Then she sold the estate and disappeared.</p>Chapter 2<p id="TwaDoubd1e171">In 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded New England village,
            with no company but a little boy about five years old. She did her own work, she
            discouraged acquaintanceships, and had none. The butcher, the baker, and the others that
            served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was
            Stillman, and that she called the child Archy. Whence she came they had not been able to
            find out, but they said she talked like a Southerner. The child had no playmates and no
            comrade, and no teacher but the mother. She taught him diligently and intelligently, and
            was satisfied with the results—even a little proud of them. One day Archy said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e173">"Mamma, am I different from other children?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e175">"Well, I suppose not. Why?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e177">"There was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had been by and I
            said yes, and she said how long since I saw him and I said I hadn't seen him at all, and
            she said how did I know he'd been by, then, and I said because I smelt his track on the
            sidewalk, and she said I was a dum fool and made a mouth at me. What did she do that
            for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e179">The young woman turned white, and said to herself, "It's a birth mark! The gift of the
            bloodhound is in him." She snatched the boy to her breast and hugged him passionately,
            saying, "God has appointed the way!" Her eyes were burning with a fierce light, and her
            breath came short and quick with excitement. She said to herself: "The puzzle is solved
            now; many a time it has been a mystery to me, the impossible things the child has done
            in the dark, but it is all clear to me now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e181">She set him in his small chair, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e183">"Wait a little till I come, dear; then we will talk about the matter." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e185">She went up to her room and took from her dressing-table several small articles and put
            them out of sight: a nail-file on the floor under the bed; a pair of nail-scissors under
            the bureau; a small ivory paper-knife under the wardrobe. Then she returned, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e187">"There! I have left some things which I ought to have brought down." She named them,
            and said, "Run up and bring them, dear." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e189">The child hurried away on his errand and was soon back again with the things. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e192">"Did you have any difficulty, dear?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e194">"No, mamma; I only went where you went." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e196">During his absence she had stepped to the bookcase, taken several books from the bottom
            shelf, opened each, passed her hand over a page, noting its number in her memory, then
            restored them to their places. Now she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e198">"I have been doing something while you have been gone, Archy. Do you think you can find
            out what it was?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e200">The boy went to the bookcase and got out the books that had been touched, and opened
            them at the pages which had been stroked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e202">The mother took him in her lap, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e204">"I will answer your question now, dear. I have found out that in one way you are quite
            different from other people. You can see in the dark, you can smell what other people
            cannot, you have the talents of a bloodhound. They are good and valuable things to have,
            but you must keep the matter a secret. If people found it out, they would speak of you
            as an odd child, a strange child, and children would be disagreeable to you, and give
            you nicknames. In this world one must be like everybody else if he doesn't want to
            provoke scorn or envy or jealousy. It is a great and fine distinction which has been
            born to you, and I am glad; but you will keep it a secret, for mamma's sake, won't you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e206">The child promised, without understanding. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e208">All the rest of the day the mother's brain was busy with excited thinkings; with plans,
            projects, schemes, each and all of them uncanny, grim, and dark. Yet they lit up her
            face; lit it with a fell light of their own; lit it with vague fires of hell. She was in
            a fever of unrest; she could not sit, stand, read, sew; there was no relief for her but
            in movement. She tested her boy's gift in twenty ways, and kept saying to herself all
            the time, with her mind in the past: "He broke my father's heart, and night and day all
            these years I have tried, and all in vain, to think out a way to break his. I have found
            it now—I have found it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e210">When night fell, the demon of unrest still possessed her. She went on with her tests;
            with a candle she traversed the house from garret to cellar, hiding pins, needles,
            thimbles, spools, under pillows, under carpets, in cracks in the walls, under the coal
            in the bin; then sent the little fellow in the dark to find them; which he did, and was
            happy and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e212">From this time forward life took on a new complexion for her. She said, "The future is
            secure—I can wait, and enjoy the waiting." The most of her lost interests revived.
            She took up music again, and languages, drawing, painting, and the other long-discarded
            delights of her maidenhood. She was happy once more, and felt again the zest of life. As
            the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy, and was contented with it.
            Not altogether, but nearly that. The soft side of his heart was larger than the other
            side of it. It was his only defect, in her eyes. But she considered that his love for
            her and worship of her made up for it. He was a good hater—that was well; but it
            was a question if the materials of his hatreds were of as tough and enduring a quality
            as those of his friendships—and that was not so well. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e215">The years drifted on. Archy was become a handsome, shapely, athletic youth, courteous,
            dignified, companionable, pleasant in his ways, and looking perhaps a trifle older than
            he was, which was sixteen. One evening his mother said she had something of grave
            importance to say to him, adding that he was old enough to hear it now, and old enough
            and possessed of character enough and stability enough to carry out a stern plan which
            she had been for years contriving and maturing. Then she told him her bitter story, in
            all its naked atrociousness. For a while the boy was paralyzed; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e217">"I understand. We are Southerners; and by our custom and nature there is but one
            atonement. I will search him out and kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e219">"Kill him? No! Death is release, emancipation; death is a favor. Do I owe him favors?
            You must not hurt a hair of his head." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e221">The boy was lost in thought awhile; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e223">"You are all the world to me, and your desire is my law and my pleasure. Tell me what
            to do and I will do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e225">The mother's eyes beamed with satisfaction, and she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e227">"You will go and find him. I have known his hiding-place for eleven years; it cost me
            five years and more of inquiry, and much money, to locate it. He is a quartz-miner in
            Colorado, and well-to-do. He lives in Denver. His name is Jacob Fuller. There—it
            is the first time I have spoken it since that unforgettable night. Think! That name
            could have been yours if I had not saved you that shame and furnished you a cleaner one.
            You will drive him from that place; you will hunt him down and drive him again; and yet
            again, and again, and again, persistently, relentlessly, poisoning his life, filling it
            with mysterious terrors, loading it with weariness and misery, making him wish for
            death, and that he had a suicide's courage; you will make of him another Wandering Jew;
            he shall know no rest any more, no peace of mind, no placid sleep; you shall shadow him,
            cling to him, persecute him, till you break his heart, as he broke my father's and
            mine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e229">"I will obey, mother." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e231">"I believe it, my child. The preparations are all made; everything is ready. Here is a
            letter of credit; spend freely, there is no lack of money. At times you may need
            disguises. I have provided them; also some other conveniences." She took from the drawer
            of the typewriter-table several squares of paper. They all bore these typewritten
            words:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e233"><i>$10,000 REWARD</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e237"><i>It is believed that a certain man who is wanted in an Eastern
                state is sojourning here. In 1880, in the night, he tied his young wife to a tree by
                the public road, cut her across the face with a cowhide, and made his dogs tear her
                clothes from her, leaving her naked. He left her there, and fled the country. A

                address.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e242">"When you have found him and acquainted yourself with his scent, you will go in the
            night and placard one of these upon the building he occupies, and another one upon the
            post-office or in some other prominent place. It will be the talk of the region. At
            first you must give him several days in which to force a sale of his belongings at
            something approaching their value. We will ruin him by and by, but gradually; we must
            not impoverish him at once, for that could bring him to despair and injure his health,
            possibly kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e244">She took three or four more typewritten forms from the
            drawer—duplicates—and read one:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e246">. . . . . . . . . ., . . . . . . . . . ., 18. . . .</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e249"><i>To Jacob Fuller:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e253"><i>You have . . . . . . days in which to settle your affairs. You

                after the named hour, I will placard you on all the dead walls, detailing your crime

                including your own. Have no fear of bodily injury—it will in no circumstances
                ever be inflicted upon you. You brought misery upon an old man, and ruined his life

That is sure."</p>Chapter III<p id="TwaDoubd1e275">Extracts from letters to the mother:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e277">DENVER, <i>April 3, 1897</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e282"><i>I have now been living several days in the same hotel with Jacob
                Fuller. I have his scent; I could track him through ten divisions of infantry and
                find him. I have often been near him and heard him talk. He owns a good mine, and
                has a fair income from it; but he is not rich. He learned mining in a good
                way—by working at it for wages. He is a cheerful creature, and his forty-three
                years sit lightly upon him; he could pass for a younger man—say thirty-six or
                thirty-seven. He has never married again—passes himself off for a widower. He
                stands well, is liked, is popular, and has many friends. Even I feel a drawing
                toward him—the paternal blood in me making its claim. How blind and
                unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature—the most of them, in
                fact! My task is become hard now—you realize it? you comprehend, and make
                allowances?—and the fire of it has cooled, more than I like to confess to
                myself, But I will carry it out. Even with the pleasure paled, the duty remains, and
                I will not spare him.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e286"><i>And for my help, a sharp resentment rises in me when I reflect
                that he who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not suffered by it.
                The lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character, and in the change he is
                happy. He, the guilty party, is absolved from all suffering; you, the innocent, are
                borne down with it. But be comforted—he shall harvest his share.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e290">SILVER GULCH, <i>May 19</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e295"><i>I placarded Form No. 1 at midnight of April 3; an hour later I
                slipped Form No. 2 under his chamber door, notifying him to leave Denver at or
                before 11.50 the night of the 14th.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e299"><i>Some late bird of a reporter stole one of my placards, then hunted
                the town over and found the other one, and stole that. In this manner he
                accomplished what the profession call a "scoop"—that is, he got a valuable
                item, and saw to it that no other paper got it. And so his paper—the principal
                one in the town—had it in glaring type on the editorial page in the morning,
                followed by a Vesuvian opinion of our wretch a column long, which wound up by adding
                a thousand dollars to our reward on the paper's account! The journals out here know
                how to do the noble thing—when there's business in it.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e303"><i>At breakfast I occupied my usual seat—selected because it
                afforded a view of papa Fuller's face, and was near enough for me to hear the talk
                that went on at his table. Seventy-five or a hundred people were in the room, and
                all discussing that item, and saying they hoped the seeker would find that rascal
                and remove the pollution of his presence from the town—with a rail, or a
                bullet, or something.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e307"><i>When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leave—folded
                up—in one hand, and the newspaper in the other; and it gave me more than half
                a pang to see him. His cheerfulness was all gone, and he looked old and pinched and
                ashy. And then—only think of the things he had to listen to! Mamma, he heard
                his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and characterizations drawn
                from the very dictionaries and phrase-books of Satan's own authorized editions down
                below. And more than that, he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them. His
                applause tasted bitter in his mouth, though; he could not disguise that from me; and
                it was observable that his appetite was gone; he only nibbled; he couldn't eat.
                Finally a man said:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e311"><i>"It is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing
                what this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel. I hope so."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e316"><i>Ah, dear, it was pitiful the way Fuller winced, and glanced around
                scared! He couldn't endure any more, and got up and left.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e320"><i>During several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in
                Mexico, and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could, and give the
                property his personal attention. He played his cards well; said he would take
                $40,000—a quarter in cash, the rest in safe notes; but that as he greatly
                needed money on account of his new purchase, he would diminish his terms for cash in
                full, He sold out for $30,000. And then, what do you think he did? He asked for
                greenbacks, and took them, saying the man in Mexico was a New-Englander, with a head
                full of crotchets, and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts. People thought it
                queer, since a draft on New York could produce greenbacks quite conveniently. There
                was talk of this odd thing, but only for a day; that is as long as any topic lasts
                in Denver.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e324"><i>I was watching, all the time. As soon as the sale was completed
                and the money paid—which was on the 11th—I began to stick to Fuller's
                track without dropping it for a moment. That night—no, 12th, for it was a
                little past midnight—I tracked him to his room, which was four doors from mine
                in the same hall; then I went back and put on my muddy day-laborer disguise,
                darkened my complexion, and sat down in my room in the gloom, with a gripsack handy,
                with a change in it, and my door ajar. For I suspected that the bird would take wing
                now. In half an hour an old woman passed by, carrying a grip: I caught the familiar
                whiff, and followed with my grip, for it was Fuller. He left the hotel by a side
                entrance, and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three
                blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness, and got into a two-horse hack, which of
                course was waiting for him by appointment. I took a seat (uninvited) on the trunk
                platform behind, and we drove briskly off. We drove ten miles, and the hack stopped
                at a way-station and was discharged. Fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow
                under the awning, as far as he could get from the light; I went inside, and watched
                the ticket-office. Fuller bought no ticket; I bought none. Presently the train came
                along, and he boarded a car; I entered the same car at the other end, and came down
                the aisle and took the seat behind him. When he paid the conductor and named his
                objective point, I dropped back several seats, while the conductor was changing a
                bill, and when he came to me I paid to the same place—about a hundred miles
                westward.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e328"><i>From that time for a week on end he led me a dance. He traveled
                here and there and yonder—always on a general westward trend—but he boas
                not a woman after the first day. He was a laborer, like myself, and wore bushy false
                whiskers. His outfit was perfect, and he could do the character without thinking
                about it, for he had served the trade for wages. His nearest friend could not have
                recognized him. At last he located himself here, the obscurest little mountain camp
                in Montana; he has a shanty, and goes out prospecting daily; is gone all day, and
                avoids society. I am living at a miner's boardinghouse, and it is an awful place:
                the bunks, the food, the dirt—everything.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e332"><i>We have been here four weeks, and in that time I have seen him but
                once; but every night I go over his track and post myself. As soon as he engaged a
                shanty here I went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed that Denver hotel to
                keep my baggage till I should send for it. I need nothing here but a change of army
                shirts, and I brought that with me.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e336">SILVER GULCH, <i>June 12</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e341"><i>The Denver episode has never found its way here, I think. I know
                the most of the men in camp, and they have never referred to it, at least in my
                hearing. Fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions. He has located a
                claim, two miles away, in an out-of-the-way place in the mountains; it promises very
                well, and he is working it diligently. Ah, but the change in him! He never smiles,
                and he keeps quite to himself, consorting with no one—he who was so fond of
                company and so cheery only two months ago. I have seen him passing along several
                times recently—drooping, forlorn, the spring gone from his step, a pathetic

                and edible food, and endurable beds, and bodily decency; then I will fetch my

                than the other one; he came here a young widower in '79, aged twenty-one—a
                year before you were married; and the documents to prove it are innumerable. Last
                night I talked with familiar friends of his who have known him from the day of his
                arrival. I said nothing, but a few days from now I will land him in this town again,
                with the loss upon his mine made good; and there will be a banquet, and a
                torch-light procession, and there will not be any expense on anybody but me. Do you

                mistake; his forgiveness will be asked, and full reparation made for a loss which he
                sustained in a certain matter." Do you see? He would think it a trap. Well, any one
                would. If I should say, "It is now known that he was not the man wanted, but another
                man—a man who once bore the same name, but discarded it for good
                reasons"—would that answer? But the Denver people would wake up then and say
                "Oho!" and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks, and say, "Why did he
                run away if he wasn't the right man?—it is too thin." If I failed to find him
                he would be ruined there—there where there is no taint upon him now. You have

                mistake; a dog would have gone the other way. But I am only part dog, and can get
                very humanly stupid when excited. He had been stopping in that house ten days; I
                almost know, now, that he stops long nowhere, the past six or eight months, but is
                restless and has to keep moving. I understand that feeling! and I know what it is to
                feel it. He still uses the name he had registered when I came so near catching him
                nine months ago—"James Walker"; doubtless the same he adopted when he fled
                from Silver Gulch. An unpretending man, and has small taste for fancy names. I
                recognized the hand easily, through its slight disguise. A square man, and not good

                horizon! I should have saved half on hour if I had gone in the right direction at
                first. I could have taken a fast tug, and should have stood a chance of catching

                Hope Cañon; I traced him to a point thirty miles from here, but there I lost
                the trail; some one gave him a lift in a wagon, I suppose. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e463"><i>I am taking a rest, now—modified by searchings for the lost
                trail. I was tired to death, mother, and low-spirited, and sometimes coming
                uncomfortably near to losing hope; but the miners in this little camp are good
                fellows, and I am used to their sort this long time back; and their breezy ways
                freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles. I have been here a month. I am
                cabining with a young fellow named "Sammy" Hillyer, about twenty-five, the only son
                of his mother—like me—and loves her dearly, and writes to her every
                week—part of which is like me. He is a timid body, and in the matter of
                intellect—well, he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire; but no
                matter, he is well liked; he is good and fine, and it is meat and bread and rest and
                luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again. I wish "James Walker"
                could have it. He had friends; he liked company. That brings up that picture of him,
                the time that I saw him last. The pathos of it! It comes before me often and often.
                At that very time, poor thing, I was girding up my conscience to make him move on
                again!</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e467"><i>Hillyer's heart is better than mine, better than anybody's in the
                community, I suppose, for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the
                camp—Flint Buckner—and the only man Flint ever talks with or allows to
                talk with him. He says he knows Flint's history, and that it is trouble that has
                made him what he is, and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can. Now
                none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a lodger like Flint
                Buckner, from all I hear about him outside. I think that this one detail will give
                you a better idea of Sammy's character than any labored-out description I could
                furnish you of him. In one of our talks he said something about like this: "Flint is
                a kinsman of mine, and he pours out all his troubles to me—empties his breast
                from time to time, or I reckon it would burst. There couldn't be any unhappier man,
                Archy Stillman; his life had been made up of misery of mind—he isn't near as
                old as he looks. He has lost the feel of reposefulness and peace—oh, years and
                years ago! He doesn't know what good luck is—never has had any; often says he
                wishes he was in the other hell, he is so tired of this one."</i></p>Chapter IV<p id="TwaDoubd1e474"><i>No real gentleman will tell the naked truth in the presence of
              ladies.</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e478">It was a crisp and spicy morning in early October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with
            the glory-fires of autumn, hung burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge
            provided by kind Nature for the wingless wild things that have their homes in the
            tree-tops and would visit together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and
            yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the
            sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere;
            far in he empty sky a solitary esophagus[1] slept upon motionless
            wing; everywhere brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e483">October is the time—1900; Hope Cañon is the place, a silver-mining camp
            away down in the Esmeralda region. It is a secluded spot, high and remote; recent as to
            discovery; thought by its occupants to be rich in metal—a year or two's
            prospecting will decide that matter one way or the other. For inhabitants, the camp has
            about two hundred miners, one white woman and child, several Chinese washermen, five
            squaws, and a dozen vagrant buck Indians in rabbit-skin robes, battered plug hats, and
            tin-can necklaces. There are no mills as yet; no church, no newspaper. The camp has
            existed but two years; it has made no big strike; the world is ignorant of its name and
            place. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e485">On both sides of the cañon the mountains rise wall-like, three thousand feet,
            and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the
            sun only once a day, when he sails over at noon. The village is a couple of miles long;
            the cabins stand well apart from each other. The tavern is the only "frame"
            house—the only house, one might say. It occupies a central position, and is the
            evening resort of the population. They drink there, and play seven-up and dominoes; also
            billiards, for there is a table, crossed all over with torn places repaired with
            court-plaster; there are some cues, but no leathers; some chipped balls which clatter
            when they run, and do not slow up gradually, but stop suddenly and sit down; there is a
            part of a cube of chalk, with a projecting jag of flint in it; and the man who can score
            six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bar's expense. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e487">Flint Buckner's cabin was the last one of the village, going south; his silver-claim
            was at the other end of the village, northward, and a little beyond the last hut in that
            direction. He was a sour creature, unsociable, and had no companionships. People who had
            tried to get acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him. His history was not
            known. Some believed that Sammy Hillyer knew it; others said no. If asked, Hillyer said
            no, he was not acquainted with it. Flint had a meek English youth of sixteen or
            seventeen with him, whom he treated roughly, both in public and in private; and of
            course this lad was applied to for information, but with no success. Fetlock
            Jones—name of the youth—said that Flint picked him up on a prospecting
            tramp, and as he had neither home nor friends in America, he had found it wise to stay
            and take Buckner's hard usage for the sake of the salary, which was bacon and beans.
            Further than this he could offer no testimony. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e489">Fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now, and under his meek exterior he was
            slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and humiliations which his master had put
            upon him. For the meek suffer bitterly from these hurts; more bitterly, perhaps, than do
            the manlier sort, who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the limit of
            endurance has been reached. Good-hearted people wanted to help Fetlock out of his
            trouble, and tried to get him to leave Buckner; but the boy showed fright at the
            thought, and said he "dasn't." Pat Riley urged him, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e491">"You leave the damned hunks and come with me; don't you be afraid. I'll take care of
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e496">The boy thanked him with tears in his eyes, but shuddered and said he "dasn't risk it";
            he said Flint would catch him alone, some time, in the night, and then—"Oh, it
            makes me sick, Mr. Riley, to think of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e498">Others said, "Run away from him; we'll stake you; skip out for the coast some night."
            But all these suggestions failed; he said Flint would hunt him down and fetch him back,
            just for meanness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e500">The people could not understand this. The boy's miseries went steadily on, week after
            week. It is quite likely that the people would have understood if they had known how he
            was employing his spare time. He slept in an out-cabin near Flint's; and there, nights,
            he nursed his bruises and his humiliations, and studied and studied over a single
            problem—how he could murder Flint Buckner and not be found out. It was the only
            joy he had in life; these hours were the only ones in the twenty-four which he looked
            forward to with eagerness and spent in happiness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e503">He thought of poison. No—that would not serve; the inquest would reveal where it
            was procured and who had procured it. He thought of a shot in the back in a lonely place
            when Flint would be homeward bound at midnight—his unvarying hour for the trip.
            No—somebody might be near, and catch him. He thought of stabbing him in his sleep.
            No—he might strike an inefficient blow, and Flint would seize him. He examined a
            hundred different ways—none of them would answer; for in even the very obscurest
            and secretest of them there was always the fatal defect of a <i>risk,</i> a chance, a possibility that he might be found out. He would have none of
            that. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e508">But he was patient, endlessly patient. There was no hurry, he said to himself. He would
            never leave Flint till he left him a corpse; there was no hurry—he would find the
            way. It was somewhere, and he would endure shame and pain and misery until he found it.
            Yes, somewhere there was a way which would leave not a trace, not even the faintest clue
            to the murderer—there was no hurry—he would find that way, and
            then—oh, then, it would just be good to be alive! Meantime he would diligently
            keep up his reputation for meekness; and also, as always theretofore, he would allow no
            one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about his oppressor. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e510">Two days before the before-mentioned October morning Flint had bought some things, and
            he and Fetlock had brought them home to Flint's cabin: a fresh box of candles, which
            they put in the corner; a tin can of blasting-powder, which they placed upon the
            candle-box; a keg of blasting-powder, which they placed under Flint's bunk; a huge coil
            of fuse, which they hung on a peg. Fetlock reasoned that Flint's mining operations had
            outgrown the pick, and that blasting was about to begin now. He had seen blasting done,
            and he had a notion of the process, but he had never helped in it. His conjecture was
            right—blasting-time had come. In the morning the pair carried fuse, drills, and
            the powder-can to the shaft; it was now eight feet deep, and to get into it and out of
            it a short ladder was used. They descended, and by command Fetlock held the
            drill—without any instructions as to the right way to hold it—and Flint
            proceeded to strike. The sledge came down; the drill sprang out of Fetlock's hand,
            almost as a matter of course. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e512">"You mangy son of a nigger, is that any way to hold a drill? Pick it up! Stand it up!
            There—hold fast. D— you! <i>I'll</i> teach you!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e517">At the end of an hour the drilling was finished. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e519">"Now, then, charge it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e521">The boy started to pour in the powder. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e523">"Idiot!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e525">A heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e527">"Get up! You can't lie sniveling there. Now, then, stick in the fuse <i>first. Now</i> put in the powder. Hold on, hold on! Are you going to fill the hole
              <i>all</i> up? Of all the sap-headed milksops I—Put in some
            dirt! Put in some gravel! Tamp it down! Hold on, hold on! Oh, great Scott! get out of
            the way!" He snatched the iron and tamped the charge himself, meantime cursing and
            blaspheming like a fiend. Then he fired the fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and ran
            fifty yards away, Fetlock following. They stood waiting a few minutes, then a great
            volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion; after a
            little there was a shower of descending stones; then all was serene again. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e535">"I wish to God you'd been in it!" remarked the master. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e538">They went down the shaft, cleaned it out, drilled another hole, and put in another
            charge. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e540">"Look here! How much fuse are you proposing to waste? Don't you know how to time a
            fuse?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e542">"No, sir." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e544">"You <i>don't!</i> Well, if you don't beat anything <i>I</i> ever saw!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e552">He climbed out of the shaft and spoke down: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e554">"Well, idiot, are you going to be all day? Cut the fuse and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e556">The trembling creature began: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e558">"If you please, sir, I—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e560">"You talk back to <i>me?</i> Cut it and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e565">The boy cut and lit. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e567">"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! I wish you were in—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e570">In his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft and ran. The boy was aghast. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e572">"Oh, my God! Help. Help! Oh, save me!" he implored. "Oh, what can I do! What <i>can</i> I do!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e577">He backed against the wall as tightly as he could; the sputtering fuse frightened the
            voice out of him; his breath stood still; he stood gazing and impotent; in two seconds,
            three seconds, four he would be flying toward the sky torn to fragments. Then he had an
            inspiration. He sprang at the fuse; severed the inch of it that was left above ground,
            and was saved. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e579">He sank down limp and half lifeless with fright, his strength gone; but he muttered
            with a deep joy: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e581">"He has learnt me! I knew there was a way, if I would wait." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e583">After a matter of five minutes Buckner stole to the shaft, looking worried and uneasy,
            and peered down into it. He took in the situation; he saw what had happened. He lowered
            the ladder, and the boy dragged himself weakly up it. He was very white. His appearance
            added something to Buckner's uncomfortable state, and he said, with a show of regret and
            sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from lack of practice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e585">"It was an accident, you know. Don't say anything about it to anybody; I was excited,
            and didn't notice what I was doing. You're not looking well; you've worked enough for
            to-day; go down to my cabin and eat what you want, and rest. It's just an accident, you
            know, on account of my being excited." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e587">"It scared me," said the lad, as he started away; "but I learnt something, so I don't
            mind it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e589">"Damned easy to please!" muttered Buckner, following him with his eye. I wonder if
            he'll tell? Mightn't he?... I wish it <i>had</i> killed him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e594">The boy took no advantage of his holiday in the matter of resting; he employed it in
            work, eager and feverish and happy work. A thick growth of chaparral extended down the
            mountainside clear to Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's labor was done in the dark
            intricacies of that stubborn growth; the rest of it was done in his own shanty. At last
            all was complete, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e596">"If he's got any suspicions that I'm going to tell on him, he won't keep them long,
            to-morrow. He will see that I am the same milksop as I always was—all day and the
            next. And the day after to-morrow night there 'll be an end of him; nobody will ever
            guess who finished him up nor how it was done. He dropped me the idea his own self, and
            that's odd."</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e602"> From the Springfield <i>Republican,</i> April 12, 1902.</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e607">To the Editor of the
                  Republican:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e610"><i>One of your citizens has asked me a
                  question about the "esophagus," and I wish to answer him through you. This in the
                  hope that the answer will get around, and save me some penmanship, for I have
                  already replied to the same question more than several times, and am not getting
                  as much holiday as I ought to have.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e614"><i>I
                  published a short story lately, and it was in that that I put the esophagus. I
                  will say privately that I expected it to bother some people—in fact, that
                  was the intention—but the harvest has been larger than I was calculating
                  upon. The esophagus has gathered in the guilty and the innocent alike, whereas I
                  was only fishing for the innocent—the innocent and confiding. I knew a few
                  of these would write and ask me; that would give me but little trouble; but, I was
                  not expecting that the wise and the learned would call upon me for succor.
                  However, that has happened, and it is time for me to speak up and stop the
                  inquiries if I can, for letter-writing is not restful to me, and I am not having
                  so much fun out of this thing as I counted on. That you may understand the
                  situation, I will insert a couple of sample inquiries. The first is from a public
                  instructor in the Philippines: </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e618">SANTA CRUZ, <i>Ilocos, Sur, P. I. </i><br><i>February 13,
                  1902</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e626"><i>My dear Sir,—I have just been
                  reading the first part of your latest story, entitled "A Double-barreled Detective
                  Story," and am very much delighted with it. In Part IV, page 264,</i> Harper's
                Magazine <i>for January, occurs this passage: "far in the empty sky a
                  solitary 'esophagus' slept upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness,
                  serenity, and the peace of God." Now, there is one word I do not understand,
                  namely, "esophagus." My only work of reference is the</i> Standard Dictionary,
                  <i>but that fails to explain the meaning. If you can spare the
                  time, I would be glad to have the meaning cleared up, as I consider the passage a
                  very touching and beautiful one. It may seem foolish to you, but consider my lack
                  of means away out in the northern part of Luzon.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e636"><i>Yours very truly.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e640"><i>Do you notice?
                  Nothing in the paragraph disturbed him but that one word. It shows that the
                  paragraph was most ably constructed for the deception it was intended to put upon
                  the reader. It was my intention that it should read plausibly, and it is now plain
                  that it does; it was my intention that it should be emotional and touching, and
                  you see, yourself, that it fetched this public instructor. Alas, If I had but left
                  that one treacherous word out, I should have scored! scored everywhere; and the
                  paragraph would have slidden through every reader's sensibilities like oil, and
                  left not a suspicion behind.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e644"><i>The other sample
                  inquiry is from a professor in a New England university. It contains one naughty
                  word (which I cannot bear to suppress), but he is not in the theological
                  department, so it is no harm:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e648"><i>Dear Mr.
                  Clemens: "Far in the empty sky a "solitary esophagus slept upon motionless
                  wing."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e653"><i>It is not often I get a chance to read
                  much periodical literature, but I have just gone through at this belated period,
                  with much gratification and edification, your "Double-barreled Detective
                  Story."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e657"><i>But what in hell is an esophagus? I
                  keep one myself, but it never sleeps in the air or anywhere else. My profession is
                  to deal with words, and esophagus interested me the moment I lighted upon it. But
                  as a companion of my youth used to say, "I'll be eternally, co-eternally cussed"
                  if l can make it out. Is it a joke, or I an ignoramus?</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e661"><i>Between you and me, I was almost ashamed of having fooled that man,
                  but for pride's sake I was not going to say so. I wrote and told him it was a
                  joke—and that is what I am now saying to my Springfield inquirer. And I told
                  him to carefully read the whole paragraph, and he would find not a vestige of
                  sense in any detail of it. This also I commend to my Springfield
                inquirer.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e665"><i>I have confessed. I am
                  sorry—partially. I will not do so any more—for the present. Don't ask
                  me any more questions; let the esophagus have a rest—on his same old
                  motionless wing. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e669">MARK TWAIN</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e672">New York City, <i>April 10, 1902</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e677"><i>( Editorial

                  appeared in</i> Harper's Magazine <i>for January and February
                  last, is the most elaborate of burlesques on detective fiction, with striking
                  melodramatic passages in which it is difficult to detect the deception, so ably is
                  it done. But the illusion ought not to endure even the first incident in the
                  February number. As for the paragraph which has so admirably illustrated the skill
                  of Mr. Clemens's ensemble and the carelessness of readers, here it
              is:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e688"><i>"It was a crisp and spicy morning in early
                  October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung
                  burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind nature for
                  the wingless wild things that have their home in the tree-tops and would visit
                  together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow flames in
                  brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the sensuous
                  fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere; far
                  in the empty sky a solitary esophagus slept upon motionless wings; everywhere
                  brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e692"><i>The success of Mark Twain's joke recalls to mind his story of the
                  petrified man in the cavern, whom he described most punctiliously, first giving a
                  picture of the scene, its impressive solitude, and all that; then going on to
                  describe the majesty of the figure, casually mentioning that the thumb of his
                  right hand rested against the side of his nose; then after further description
                  observing that the fingers of the right hand were extended in a radiating fashion;
                  and, recurring to the dignified attitude and position of the man, incidentally
                  remarked that the thumb of the left hand was in contact with the little finger of
                  the right—and so on. But was it so ingeniously written that Mark, relating
                  the history years later in an article which appeared in that excellent magazine of
                  the past, the</i> Galaxy, <i>declared that no one ever found out
                  the joke, and, if we remember aright, that that astonishing old mockery was
                  actually looked for in the region where he, as a Nevada newspaper editor, had
                  located it. It is certain that Mark Twain's jumping frog has a good many more
                  "pints" than any other frog.</i></p>Chapter V<p id="TwaDoubd1e702">The next day came and went. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e704">It is now almost midnight, and in five minutes the new morning will begin. The scene is
            in the tavern billiard-room. Rough men in rough clothing, slouch-hats, breeches stuffed
            into boot-tops, some with vests, none with coats, are grouped about the boiler-iron
            stove, which has ruddy cheeks and is distributing a grateful warmth; the billiard-balls
            are clacking; there is no other sound—that is, within; the wind is fitfully
            moaning without. The men look bored; also expectant. A hulking broad-shouldered miner,
            of middle age, with grizzled whiskers, and an unfriendly eye set in an unsociable face,
            rises, slips a coil of fuse upon his arm, gathers up some other personal properties, and
            departs without word or greeting to anybody. It is Flint Buckner. As the door closes
            behind him a buzz of talk breaks out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e706">"The regularest man that ever was," said Jake Parker, the blacksmith: "you can tell
            when it's twelve just by him leaving, without looking at your Waterbury." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e708">"And it's the only virtue he's got, as fur as I know," said Peter Hawes, miner. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e710">"He's just a blight on this society," said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "If I was
            running this shop I'd make him say something, <i>some</i> time or other,
            or vamos the ranch." This with a suggestive glance at the barkeeper, who did not choose
            to see it, since the man under discussion was a good customer, and went home pretty well
            set up, every night, with refreshments furnished from the bar. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e715">"Say," said Ham Sandwich, miner, "does any of you boys ever recollect of him asking you
            to take a drink?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e717"><i>"Him?</i> Flint <i>Buckner?</i> Oh, Laura!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e724">This sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous general outburst in one form of words or
            another from the crowd. After a brief silence, Pat Riley, miner, said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e726">"He's the 15-puzzle, that cuss. And his boy's another one. <i>I
            </i>can't make them out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e731">"Nor anybody else," said Ham Sandwich; "and if they are 15-puzzles how are you going to
            rank up that other one? When it comes to A 1 right-down solid mysteriousness, he lays
            over both of them. <i>Easy—</i>don't he?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e737">"You bet!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e739">Everybody said it. Every man but one. He was the new-comer-Peterson. He ordered the
            drinks all round, and asked who No. 3 might be. All answered at once, "Archy Stillman!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e741">"Is he a mystery?" asked Peterson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e743">"Is <i>he</i> a mystery? Is Archy <i>Stillman a</i>
            mystery?" said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "Why, the fourth dimension's foolishness to
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e754">For Ferguson was learned. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e756">Peterson wanted to hear all about him; everybody wanted to tell him; everybody began.
            But Billy Stevens, the barkeeper, called the house to order, and said one at a time was
            best. He distributed the drinks, and appointed Ferguson to lead. Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e758">"Well, he's a boy. And that is just about all we know about him. You can pump him till
            you are tired; it ain't any use; you won't get anything. At least about his intentions,
            or line of business, or where he's from, and such things as that. And as for getting at
            the nature and get-up of his main big chief mystery, why, he'll just change the subject,
            that's all. You can <i>guess</i> till you're black in the
            face—it's your privilege—but suppose you do, where do you arrive at?
            Nowhere, as near as I can make out," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e763">"What <i>is</i> his big chief one?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e768">"Sight, maybe. Hearing, maybe. Instinct, maybe. Magic, maybe. Take your
            choice—grownups, twenty-five; children and servants, half price. Now I'll tell you
            what he can do. You can start here, and just disappear; you can go and hide wherever you
            want to, I don't care where it is, nor how far—and he'll go straight and put his
            finger on you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e770">"You don't mean it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e772">"I just do, though. Weather's nothing to him—elemental conditions is nothing to
            him—he don't even take notice of them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e775">"Oh, come! Dark? Rain? Snow? Hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e777">"It's all the same to <i>him.</i> He don't give a damn." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e782">"Oh, <i>say—</i>including <i>fog,</i> per'aps?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e790"><i>"Fog!</i> he's got an eye 't can plunk through it like a bullet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e794">"Now, boys, honor bright, what's he giving me?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e796">"It's a fact!" they all shouted. "Go on, Wells-Fargo." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e798">"Well, sir, you can leave him here, chatting with the boys, and you can slip out and go
            to any cabin in this camp and open a book—yes, sir, a dozen of them—and take
            the page in your memory, and he'll start out and go straight to that cabin and open
            every one of them books at the right page, and call it off, and never make a mistake." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e800">"He must be the devil!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e802">"More than one has thought it. Now I'll tell you a perfectly wonderful thing that he
            done. The other night he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e804">There was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside, the door flew open, and an excited
            crowd burst in, with the camp's one white woman in the lead and crying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e806">"My child! my child! she's lost and gone! For the love of God help me to find Archy
            Stillman; we've hunted everywhere!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e809">Said the barkeeper: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e811">"Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, and don't worry. He asked for a bed three hours ago,
            tuckered out tramping the trails the way he's always doing, and went up-stairs. Ham
            Sandwich, run up and roust him out; he's in No. 14." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e813">The youth was soon down-stairs and ready. He asked Mrs. Hogan for particulars. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e815">"Bless you, dear, there ain't any; I wish there was. I put her to sleep at seven in the
            evening, and when I went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself, she was gone. I
            rushed for your cabin, dear, and you wasn't there, and I've hunted for you ever since,
            at every cabin down the gulch, and now I've come up again, and I'm that distracted and
            scared and heartbroke; but, thanks to God, I've found you at last, dear heart, and
            you'll find my child. Come on! come quick!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e817">"Move right along; I'm with you, madam. Go to your cabin first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e819">The whole company streamed out to join the hunt. All the southern half of the village
            was up, a hundred men strong, and waiting outside, a vague dark mass sprinkled with
            twinkling lanterns. The mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself
            to the narrow road, and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders. In a
            few minutes the Hogan cabin was reached. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e821">"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Hogan; "there's where she was; it's where I laid her at
            seven o'clock; but where she is now, God only knows." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e823">"Hand me a lantern," said Archy. He set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it,
            pretending to examine the ground closely. "Here's her track," he said, touching the
            ground here and there and yonder with his finger. "Do you see?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e825">Several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see. One or two
            thought they discerned something like a track; the others shook their heads and
            confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp
            enough to discover. One said, "Maybe a child's foot could make a mark on it, but <i>I</i> don't see how." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e830">Young Stillman stepped outside, held the light to the ground, turned leftward, and
            moved three steps, closely examining; then said, "I've got the direction—come
            along; take the lantern, somebody." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e832">He strode off swiftly southward, the files following, swaying and bending in and out
            with the deep curves of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the mouth of the gorge was reached;
            before them stretched the sagebrush plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman called a halt,
            saying, "We mustn't start wrong, now; we must take the direction again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e835">He took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards; then said,
            "Come on; it's all right," and gave up the lantern. In and out among the sage-bushes he
            marched, a quarter of a mile, bearing gradually to the right; then took a new direction
            and made another great semicircle; then changed again and moved due west nearly half a
            mile—and stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e837">"She gave it up, here, poor little chap. Hold the lantern. You can see where she sat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e839">But this was in a slick alkali flat which was surfaced like steel, and no person in the
            party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a
            cushion on a veneer like that. The bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the
            spot, lamenting. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e841">"But where is she, then?" some one said. "She didn't stay here. We can see <i>that</i> much, anyway." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e846">Stillman moved about in a circle around the place, with the lantern, pretending to hunt
            for tracks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e848">"Well!" he said presently, in an annoyed tone, "I don't understand it." He examined
            again. "No use. She was here—that's certain; she never <i>walked</i> away from here—and that's certain. It's a puzzle; I can't make it
            out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e853">The mother lost heart then. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e855">"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! some flying beast has got her. I'll never see her
            again!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e857">"Ah, <i>don't</i> give up," said Archy. "We'll find her—don't
            give up." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e862">"God bless you for the words, Archy Stillman!" and she seized his hand and kissed it
            fervently. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e864">Peterson, the new-comer, whispered satirically in Ferguson's ear: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e867">"Wonderful performance to find this place, wasn't it? Hardly worth while to come so
            far, though; any other supposititious place would have answered just as well—hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e869">Ferguson was not pleased with the innuendo. He said, with some warmth: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e871">"Do you mean to insinuate that the child hasn't been here? I tell you the child <i>has</i> been here! Now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a
            little fuss as—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e876">"All right!" sang out Stillman. "Come, everybody, and look at this! It was right under
            our noses all the time, and we didn't see it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e878">There was a general plunge for the ground at the place where the child was alleged to
            have rested, and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to see the thing that Archy's finger
            was resting upon. There was a pause, then a several-barreled sigh of disappointment. Pat
            Riley and Ham Sandwich said, in the one breath: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e880">"What is it, Archy? There's nothing here." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e882">"Nothing? Do you call <i>that</i> nothing?" and he swiftly traced upon
            the ground a form with his finger. "There—don't you recognize it now? It's Injun
            Billy's track. He's got the child." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e887">"God be praised !" from the mother. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e889">"Take away the lantern. I've got the direction. Follow!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e891">He started on a run, racing in and out among the sage-bushes a matter of three hundred
            yards, and disappeared over a sand-wave; the others struggled after him, caught him up,
            and found him waiting. Ten steps away was a little wickiup, a dim and formless shelter
            of rags and old horse-blankets, a dull light showing through its chinks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e893">"You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the lad. "It's your privilege to be first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e896">All followed the sprint she made for the wickiup, and saw, with her, the picture its
            interior afforded. Injun Billy was sitting on the ground; the child was asleep beside
            him. The mother hugged it with a wild embrace, which included Archy Stillman, the
            grateful tears running down her face, and in a choked and broken voice she poured out a
            golden stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments which has its home in full
            richness nowhere but in the Irish heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e898">"I find her bymeby it is ten o'clock," Billy explained. "She 'sleep out yonder, ve'y
            tired—face wet, been cryin', 'spose; fetch her home, feed her, she heap much
            hungry—go 'sleep 'gin." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e900">In her limitless gratitude the happy mother waived rank and hugged him too, calling him
            "the angel of God in disguise." And he probably was in disguise if he was that kind of
            an official. He was dressed for the character. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e902">At half past one in the morning the procession burst into the village singing, "When
            Johnny Comes Marching Home," waving its lanterns and swallowing the drinks that were
            brought out all along its course. It concentrated at the tavern, and made a night of
            what was left of the morning.</p>Chapter VI<p id="TwaDoubd1e907">The next afternoon the village was electrified with an immense sensation. A grave and
            dignified foreigner of distinguished bearing and appearance had arrived at the tavern,
            and entered this formidable name upon the register: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e909">SHERLOCK HOLMES
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e913">The news buzzed from cabin to cabin, from claim to claim; tools were dropped, and the
            town swarmed toward the center of interest. A man passing out at the northern end of the
            village shouted it to Pat Riley, whose claim was the next one to Flint Buckner's. At
            that time Fetlock Jones seemed to turn sick. He muttered to himself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e915">"Uncle <i>Sherlock!</i> The mean luck of it!—that <i>he </i>should come just when..." He dropped into a reverie, and
            presently said to himself: "But what's the use of being afraid of <i>him?
            </i>Anybody that knows him the way I do knows he can't detect a crime except where he
            plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and hires some fellow to commit it
            according to instructions.... Now there ain't going to <i>be</i> any
            clues this time—so, what show has he got? None at all. No, sir; everything's
            ready. If I was to risk putting it off—...No, I won't run any risk like that.
            Flint Buckner goes out of this world to-night, for sure." Then another trouble presented
            itself. "Uncle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening, and
            how am I going to get rid of him? for I've <i>got</i> to be at my cabin
            a minute or two about eight o'clock." This was an awkward matter, and cost him much
            thought. But he found a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll go for a walk, and I'll leave
            him in the road a minute, so that he won't see what it is I do: the best way to throw a
            detective off the track, anyway, is to have him along when you are preparing the thing.
            Yes, that's the safest—I'll take him with me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e932">Meantime the road in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping
            for a glimpse of the great man. But he kept his room, and did not appear. None but
            Ferguson, Jake Parker the blacksmith, and Ham Sandwich had any luck. These enthusiastic
            admirers of the great scientific detective hired the tavern's detained-baggage lockup,
            which looked into the detective's room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide,
            ambushed themselves in it, and cut some peep-holes in the window-blind. Mr. Holmes's
            blinds were down; but by and by he raised them. It gave the spies a hair-lifting but
            pleasurable thrill to find themselves face to face with the Extraordinary Man who had
            filled the world with the fame of his more than human ingenuities. There he
            sat—not a myth, not a shadow, but real, alive, compact of substance, and almost
            within touching distance with the hand. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e934">"Look at that head!" said Ferguson, in an awed voice. "By gracious! <i>that's</i> a head!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e939">"You bet!" said the blacksmith, with deep reverence. "Look at his nose! look at his
            eyes! Intellect? Just a battery of it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e941">"And that paleness," said Ham Sandwich. "Comes from thought—that's what it comes
            from. Hell! duffers like us don't know what real thought <i>is."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e946">"No more we don't," said Ferguson. "What we take for thinking is just
            blubber-and-slush," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e948">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo. And look at that frown—that's <i>deep</i> thinking—away down, down, forty fathom into the bowels of things.
            He's on the track of something." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e954">"Well, he is, and don't you forget it. Say—look at that awful gravity—look
            at that pallid solemness—there ain't any corpse can lay over it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e956">"No, sir, not for dollars! And it's his'n by hereditary rights, too; he's been dead
            four times a'ready, and there's history for it. Three times natural, once by accident.
            I've heard say he smells damp and cold, like a grave. And he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e958">" 'Sh! Watch him! There—he's got his thumb on the bump on the near corner of his
            forehead, and his forefinger on the off one. His think-works is just a-<i>grinding</i> now, you bet your other shirt." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e963">"That's so. And now he's gazing up toward heaven and stroking his mustache slow,
            and—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e965">"Now he has rose up standing, and is putting his clues together on his left fingers
            with his right finger. See? he touches the forefinger—now middle finger—now
            ring-finger—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e967">"Stuck!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e969">"Look at him scowl! He can't seem to make out <i>that</i> clue. So
            he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e974">"See him smile!—like a tiger—and tally off the other fingers like nothing!
            He's got it, boys; he's got it sure!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e976">"Well, I should <i>say!</i> I'd hate to be in that man's place that
            he's after." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e981">Mr. Holmes drew a table to the window, sat down with his back to the spies, and
            proceeded to write. The spies withdrew their eyes from the peep-holes, lit their pipes,
            and settled themselves for a comfortable smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with conviction: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e983">"Boys, it's no use talking, he's a wonder! He's got the signs of it all over him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e986">"You hain't ever said a truer word than that, Wells-Fargo," said Jake Parker. "Say,
            wouldn't it 'a' been nuts if he'd a-been here last night?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e988">"Oh, by George, but wouldn't it!" said Ferguson. "Then we'd have seen <i>scientific</i> work. Intellect—just pure intellect—away up on the upper
            levels, dontchuknow. Archy is all right, and it don't become anybody to belittle <i>him,</i> I can tell you. But his gift is only just eyesight, sharp as
            an owl's, as near as I can make it out just a grand natural animal talent, no more, no
            less, and prime as far as it goes, but no intellect in it, and for awfulness and
            marvelousness no more to be compared to what this man does than—than—Why,
            let me tell you what <i>he'd</i> have done. He'd have stepped over to
            Hogan's and glanced—just <i>glanced,</i> that's all—at the
            premises, and that's enough. See everything? Yes, sir, to the last little detail; and
            he'll know more about that place than the Hogans would know in seven years. Next, he
            would sit down on the bunk, just as ca'm, and say to Mrs. Hogan—<i>Say,</i> Ham, consider that you are Mrs. Hogan. I'll ask the questions; you answer
            them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1005">"All right; go on." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1007">" 'Madam, if you please—attention—do not let your mind wander. Now,
            then—sex of the child?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1009">" 'Female, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1011">" 'Um—female. Very good, very good. Age?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1013">" 'Turned six, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1015">" 'Um—young, weak—two miles. Weariness will overtake it then. It will sink
            down and sleep. We shall find it two miles away, or less. Teeth?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1017">" 'Five, your Honor, and one a-coming.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1019">" 'Very good, very good, <i>very</i> good, indeed.' You see, boys, <i>he</i> knows a clue when he sees it, when it wouldn't mean a dern thing
            to anybody else. 'Stockings, madam? Shoes?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1027">" 'Yes, your Honor—both.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1030">" 'Yarn, perhaps? Morocco?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1032">" 'Yarn, your Honor. And kip.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1034">" 'Um—kip. This complicates the matter. However, let it go—we shall manage.
            Religion?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1036">" 'Catholic, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1038">" 'Very good. Snip me a bit from the bed blanket, please. Ah, thanks. Part
            wool—foreign make. Very well. A snip from some garment of the child's, please.
            Thanks. Cotton. Shows wear. An excellent clue, excellent. Pass me a pallet of the floor
            dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, many thanks. Ah, admirable, admirable! <i>Now</i> we know where we are, I think.' You see, boys, he's got all the
            clues he wants now; he don't need anything more. Now, then, what does this Extraordinary
            Man do? He lays those snips and that dirt out on the table and leans over them on his
            elbows, and puts them together side by side and studies them—mumbles to himself,
            'Female'; changes them around—mumbles, 'Six years old'; changes them this way and
            that—again mumbles: 'Five teeth—one
            a-coming—Catholic—yarn—cotton—kip—damn that kip.' Then he
            straightens up and gazes toward heaven, and plows his hands through his hair—plows
            and plows, muttering, 'Damn that kip!' Then he stands up and frowns, and begins to tally
            off his clues on his fingers—and gets stuck at the ring-finger. But only just a
            minute—then his face glares all up in a smile like a house afire, and he
            straightens up stately and majestic, and says to the crowd, 'Take a lantern, a couple of
            you, and go down to Injun Billy's and fetch the child—the rest of you go 'long
            home to bed; good-night, madam; good-night, gents.' And he bows like the Matterhorn, and
            pulls out for the tavern. That's <i>his</i> style, and the <i>Only—</i>scientific, intellectual—all over in fifteen
            minutes—no poking around all over the sage-brush range an hour and a half in a
            mass-meeting crowd for <i>him,</i> boys—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1055">"By Jackson, it's grand!" said Ham Sandwich. "Wells-Fargo, you've got him down to a
            dot. He ain't painted up any exacter to the life in the books. By George, I can juse <i>see</i> him—can't you, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1060">"You bet you! It's just a photograft, that's what it is." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1062">Ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success, and grateful. He sat silently
            enjoying his happiness a little while, then he murmured, with a deep awe in his voice, </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1064">"I wonder if God made him?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1066">There was no response for a moment; then Ham Sandwich said, reverently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1068">"Not all at one time, I reckon."</p>Chapter VII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1073">At eight o'clock that evening two persons were groping their way past Flint Buckner's
            cabin in the frosty gloom. They were Sherlock Holmes and his nephew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1075">"Stop here in the road a moment, uncle," said Fetlock, "while I run to my cabin; I
            won't be gone a minute." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1077">He asked for something—the uncle furnished it—then he disappeared in the
            darkness, but soon returned, and the talking-walk was resumed. By nine o'clock they had
            wandered back to the tavern. They worked their way through the billiard-room, where a
            crowd had gathered in the hope of getting a glimpse of the Extraordinary Man. A royal
            cheer was raised. Mr. Holmes acknowledged the compliment with a series of courtly bows,
            and as he was passing out his nephew said to the assemblage: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1079">"Uncle Sherlock's got some work to do, gentlemen, that 'll keep him till twelve or one;
            but he'll be down again then, or earlier if he can, and hopes some of you'll be left to
            take a drink with him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1081">"By George, he's just a duke, boys! Three cheers for Sherlock Holmes, the greatest man
            that ever lived!" shouted Ferguson. "Hip, hip, hip—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1083">"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Tiger!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1085">The uproar shook the building, so hearty was the feeling the boys put into their
            welcome. Up-stairs the uncle reproached the nephew gently, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1087">"What did you get me into that engagement for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1089">"I reckon you don't want to be unpopular, do you, uncle? Well, then, don't you put on
            any exclusiveness in a mining-camp, that's all. The boys admire you; but if you was to
            leave without taking a drink with them, they'd set you down for a snob. And besides, you
            said you had home talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1091">The boy was right, and wise—the uncle acknowledged it. The boy was wise in
            another detail which he did not mention—except to himself: "Uncle and the others
            will come handy—in the way of nailing an <i>alibi </i>where it
            can't be budged." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1097">He and his uncle talked diligently about three hours. Then, about midnight, Fetlock
            stepped down-stairs and took a position in the dark a dozen steps from the tavern, and
            waited. Five minutes later Flint Buckner came rocking out of the billiard-room and
            almost brushed him as he passed. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1099">"I've <i>got</i> him!" muttered the boy. He continued to himself,
            looking after the shadowy form: "Good-by—good-by for good, Flint Buckner; you
            called my mother a—well, never mind what: it's all right, now; you're taking your
            last walk, friend." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1104">He went musing back into the tavern. "From now till one is an hour. We'll spend it with
            the boys; it's good for the <i>alibi."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1109">He brought Sherlock Holmes to the billiard-room, which was jammed with eager and
            admiring miners; the guest called the drinks, and the fun began. Everybody was happy;
            everybody was complimentary; the ice was soon broken, songs, anecdotes, and more drinks
            followed, and the pregnant minutes flew. At six minutes to one, when the jollity was at
            its highest— </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1111"><i>Boom!</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1115">There was silence instantly. The deep sound came rolling and rumbling frown peak to
            peak up the gorge, then died down, and ceased. The spell broke, then, and the men made a
            rush for the door, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1117">"Something's blown up!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1119">Outside, a voice in the darkness said, "It's away down the gorge; I saw the flash." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1121">The crowd poured down the cañon—Holmes, Fetlock, Archy Stillman,
            everybody. They made the mile in a few minutes. By the light of a lantern they found the
            smooth and solid dirt floor of Flint Buckner's cabin; of the cabin itself not a vestige
            remained, not a rag nor a splinter. Nor any sign of Flint. Search-parties sought here
            and there and yonder, and presently a cry went up. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1123">"Here he is!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1125">It was true. Fifty yards down the gulch they had found him—that is, they had
            found a crushed and lifeless mass which represented him. Fetlock Jones hurried thither
            with the others and looked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1128">The inquest was a fifteen-minute affair. Ham Sandwich, foreman of the jury, handed up
            the verdict, which was phrased with a certain unstudied literary grace, and closed with
            this finding, to wit: that "deceased came to his death by his own act or some other
            person or persons unknown to this jury not leaving any family or similar effects behind
            but his cabin which was blown away and God have mercy on his soul amen." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1130">Then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd, for the storm-center of interest was
            there—Sherlock Holmes. The miners stood silent and reverent in a half-circle,
            inclosing a large vacant space which included the front exposure of the site of the late
            premises. In this considerable space the Extraordinary Man was moving about, attended by
            his nephew with a lantern. With a tape he took measurements of the cabin site; of the
            distance from the wall of chaparral to the road; of the height of the chaparral bushes;
            also various other measurements. He gathered a rag here, a splinter there, and a pinch
            of earth yonder, inspected them profoundly, and preserved them. He took the "lay" of the
            place with a pocket-compass, allowing two seconds for magnetic variation. He took the
            time (Pacific) by his watch, correcting it for local time. He paced off the distance
            from the cabin site to the corpse, and corrected that for tidal differentiation. He took
            the altitude with a pocket-aneroid, and the temperature with a pocket-thermometer.
            Finally he said, with a stately bow: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1132">"It is finished. Shall we return, gentlemen?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1134">He took up the line of march for the tavern, and the crowd fell into his wake,
            earnestly discussing and admiring the Extraordinary Man, and interlarding guesses as to
            the origin of the tragedy and who the author of it might he. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1136">"My, but it's grand luck having him here—hey, boys?" said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1138">"It's the biggest thing of the century," said Ham Sandwich. "It 'll go all over the
            world; you mark my words." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1140"><i>"You</i> bet!" said Jake Parker, the blacksmith. "It 'll boom this
            camp. Ain't it so, Wells-Fargo?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1144">"Well, as you want my opinion—if it's any sign of how <i>I
            </i>think about it, I can tell you this: yesterday I was holding the Straight Flush
            claim at two dollars a foot; I'd like to see the man that can get it at sixteen to-day." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1149">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo! It's the grandest luck a new camp ever struck. Say, did
            you see him collar them little rags and dirt and things? What an eye! He just can't
            overlook a clue—'tain't <i>in </i>him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1154">"That's so. And they wouldn't mean a thing to anybody else; but to him, why, they're
            just a book—large print at that." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1156">"Sure's you're born! Them odds and ends have got their little old secret, and they
            think there ain't anybody can pull it; but, land! when he sets his grip there they've
            got to squeal, and don't you forget it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1159">"Boys, I ain't sorry, now, that he wasn't here to roust out the child; this is a bigger
            thing, by a long sight. Yes, sir, and more tangled up and scientific and intellectual." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1161">"I reckon we're all of us glad it's turned out this way. Glad? 'George! it ain't any
            name for it. Dontchuknow, Archy could 've <i>learnt</i> something if
            he'd had the nous to stand by and take notice of how that man works the system. But no;
            he went poking up into the chaparral and just missed the whole thing." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1166">"It's true as gospel; I seen it myself. Well, Archy's young. He'll know better one of
            these days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1168">"Say, boys, who do you reckon done it?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1170">That was a difficult question, and brought out a world of unsatisfying conjecture.
            Various men were mentioned as possibilities, but one by one they were discarded as not
            being eligible. No one but young Hillyer had been intimate with Flint Buckner; no one
            had really had a quarrel with him; he had affronted every man who had tried to make up
            to him, although not quite offensively enough to require bloodshed. There was one name
            that was upon every tongue from the start, but it <i>was</i> the last to
            get utterance—Fetlock Jones's. It was Pat Riley that mentioned it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1175">"Oh, well," the boys said, "of course we've all thought of him, because he had a
            million rights to kill Flint Buckner, and it was just his plain duty to do it. But all
            the same there's two things we can't get around: for one thing, he hasn't got the sand;
            and for another, he wasn't anywhere near the place when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1177">"I know it," said Pat. "He was there in the billiard-room with us when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1179">"Yes, and was there all the time for an hour <i>before</i> it
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1184">"It's so. And lucky for him, too. He'd have been suspected in a minute if it hadn't
            been for that."</p>Chapter VIII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1189">The tavern dining-room had been cleared of all its furniture save one six-foot pine
            table and a chair. This table was against one end of the room; the chair was on it;
            Sherlock Holmes, stately, imposing, impressive, sat in the chair. The public stood. The
            room was full. The tobacco-smoke was dense, the stillness profound. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1191">The Extraordinary Man raised his hand to command additional silence; held it in the air
            a few moments; then, in brief, crisp terms he put forward question after question, and
            noted the answers with "Um-ums," nods of the head, and so on. By this process he learned
            all about Flint Buckner, his character, conduct, and habits, that the people were able
            to tell him. It thus transpired that the Extraordinary Man's nephew was the only person
            in the camp who had a killing-grudge against Flint Buckner. Mr. Holmes smiled
            compassionately upon the witness, and asked, languidly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1193">"Do any of you gentlemen chance to know where the lad Fetlock Jones was at the time of
            the explosion?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1195">A thunderous response followed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1197">"In the billiard-room of this house!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1199">"Ah. And had he just come in?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1201">"Been there all of an hour!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1203">"Ah. It is about—about—well, about how far might it be to the scene of the
            explosions" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1205">"All of a mile!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1207">"Ah. It isn't <i>much</i> of an alibi, 'tis true, but—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1213">A storm-burst of laughter, mingled with shouts of "By jiminy, but he's
            chain-lightning!" and "Ain't you sorry you spoke, Sandy?" shut off the rest of the
            sentence, and the crushed witness drooped his blushing face in pathetic shame. The
            inquisitor resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1215">"The lad Jones's somewhat <i>distant</i> connection with the case"
              (laughter<i>) "</i>having been disposed of, let us now call the
            eye-witnesses of the tragedy, and listen to what they have to say." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1223">He got out his fragmentary clues and arranged them on a sheet of cardboard on his knee.
            The house held its breath and watched. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1225">"We have the longitude and the latitude, corrected for magnetic variation, and this
            gives us the exact location of the tragedy. We have the altitude, the temperature, and
            the degree of humidity prevailing—inestimably valuable, since they enable us to
            estimate with precision the degree of influence which they would exercise upon the mood
            and disposition of the assassin at that time of the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1227"><i>(Buzz of admiration; muttered remark, "By George, but he's
              deep.")</i> He fingered his clues. "And now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak
            to us. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1231">"Here we have an empty linen shot-bag. What is its message? This: that robbery was the
            motive, not revenge. What is its further message? This: that the assassin was of
            inferior intelligence—shall we say light-witted, or perhaps approaching that? How
            do we know this? Because a person of sound intelligence would not have proposed to rob
            the man Buckner, who never had much money with him. But the assassin might have been a
            stranger? Let the bag speak again. I take from it this article. It is a bit of
            silver-bearing quartz. It is peculiar. Examine it, please—you—and
            you—and you. Now pass it back, please. There is but one lode on this coast which
            produces just that character and color of quartz; and that is a lode which crops out for
            nearly two miles on a stretch, and in my opinion is destined, at no distant day, to
            confer upon its locality a globe-girdling celebrity, and upon its two hundred owners
            riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Name that lode, please." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1233">"The Consolidated Christian Science and Mary Ann!" was the prompt response. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1235">A wild crash of hurrahs followed, and every man reached for his neighbor's hand and
            wrung it, with tears in his eyes; and Wells-Fargo Ferguson shouted, "The Straight Flush
            is on the lode, and up she goes to a hunched and fifty a foot—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1240">When quiet fell, Mr. Holmes resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1242">"We perceive, then, that three facts are established, to wit: the assassin was
            approximately light-witted; he was not a stranger; his motive was robbery, not revenge.
            Let us proceed. I hold in my hand a small fragment of fuse, with the recent smell of
            fire upon it. What is its testimony? Taken with the corroborative evidence of the
            quartz, it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner. What does it tell us further?
            This, gentlemen: that the assassination was consummated by means of an explosive. What
            else does it say? This: that the explosive was located against the side of the cabin
            nearest the road—the front side—for within six feet of that spot I found it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1244">"I hold in my fingers a burnt Swedish match—the kind one rubs on a safety-box. I
            found it in the road, six hundred and twenty-two feet from the abolished cabin. What
            does it say? This: that the train was fired from that point. What further does it tell
            us? This: that the assassin was left-handed. How do I know this? I should not be able to
            explain to you, gentlemen, how I know it, the signs being so subtle that only long
            experience and deep study can enable one to detect them. But the signs are here, and
            they are reinforced by a fact which you must have often noticed in the great detective
            narratives—that <i>all </i>assassins are left-handed." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1250">"By Jackson, <i>that's</i> so." said Ham Sandwich, bringing his great
            hand down with a resounding slap upon his thigh; "blamed if I ever thought of it
            before." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1255">"Nor I!" "Nor I!" cried several. "Oh, there can't anything escape <i>him—</i>look at his eye!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1260">"Gentlemen, distant as the murderer was from his doomed victim, he did not wholly
            escape injury. This fragment of wood which I now exhibit to you struck him. It drew
            blood. Wherever he is, he bears the telltale mark. I picked it up where he stood when he
            fired the fatal train," He looked out over the house from his high perch, and his
            countenance began to darken; he slowly raised his hand, and pointed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1262">"There stands the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1264">For a moment the house was paralyzed with amazement; then twenty voices burst out with: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1266">"Sammy Hillyer? Oh, <i>hell,</i> no! <i>Him?</i> It's
            pure foolishness!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1274">"Take care, gentlemen—be not hasty. Observe—he has the blood-mark on his
            brow." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1276">Hillyer turned white with fright. He was near to crying. He turned this way and that,
            appealing to every face for help and sympathy; and held out his supplicating hands
            toward Holmes and began to plead: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1278"><i>"Don't,</i> oh, don't! I never did it; I give my word I never did
            it. The way I got this hurt on my forehead was—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1282">"Arrest him, constable!" cried Holmes. "I will swear out the warrant" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1284">The constable moved reluctantly forward—hesitated—stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1287">Hillyer broke out with another appeal. "Oh, Archy, don't let them do it; it would kill
            mother! <i>You</i> know how I got the hurt. Tell them, and save me,
            Archy; save me!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1292">Stillman worked his way to the front, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1294">"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be afraid." Then he said to the house, "Never mind how he
            got the hurt; it hasn't anything to do with this case, and isn't of any consequence." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1296">"God bless you, Archy, for a true friend!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1298">"Hurrah for Archy! Go in, boy, and play 'em a knock-down flush to their two pair 'n' a
            jack!" shouted the house, pride in their home talent and a patriotic sentiment of
            loyalty to it rising suddenly in the public heart and changing the whole attitude of the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1300">Young Stillman waited for the noise to cease; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1302">"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand by that door yonder, and Constable Harris to stand by
            the other one here, and not let anybody leave the room. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1304">"Said and done. Go on, old man!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1306">"The criminal is present, I believe. I will show him to you before long, in case I am
            right in my guess. Now I will tell you all about the tragedy, from start to finish. The
            motive <i>wasn't </i>robbery; it was revenge. The murderer <i>wasn't</i> light-witted. He <i>didn't</i> stand six
            hundred and twenty-two feet away. He <i>didn't </i>get hit with a piece
            of wood. He <i>didn't</i> place the explosive against the cabin. He <i>didn't</i> bring a shot-bag with him, and he <i>wasn't</i> left-handed. With the exception of these errors, the distinguished
            guest's statement of the case is substantially correct." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1330">A comfortable laugh rippled over the house; friend nodded to friend, as much as to say,
            "That's the word, with the bark <i>on</i> it. Good lad, good boy. <i>He</i> ain't lowering his flag any!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1338">The guest's serenity was not disturbed. Stillman resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1341">"I also have some witnesses; and I will presently tell you where you can find some
            more." He held up a piece of coarse wire; the crowd craned their necks to see. "It has a
            smooth coating of melted tallow on it. And here is a candle which is burned half-way
            down. The remaining half of it has marks cut upon it an inch apart. Soon I will tell you
            where I found these things. I will now put aside reasonings, guesses, the impressive
            hitchings of odds and ends of clues together, and the other showy theatricals of the
            detective trade, and tell you in a plain, straightforward way just how this dismal thing
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1343">He paused a moment, for effect—to allow silence and suspense to intensify and
            concentrate the house's interest; then he went on: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1345">"The assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains. It was a good plan, very
            ingenious, and showed an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. It was a plan which was
            well calculated to ward off all suspicion from its inventor. In the <i>first</i> place, he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart, and lit it and timed
            it. He found it took three hours to burn four inches of it. I tried it myself for half
            an hour, awhile ago, up-stairs here, while the inquiry into Flint Buckner's character
            and ways was being conducted in this room, and I arrived in that way at the rate of a
            candle's consumption when sheltered from the wind. Having proved his trial candle's
            rate, he blew it out—I have already shown it to you—and put <i>his</i> inch-marks on a fresh one. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1353">"He put the fresh one into a tin candlestick. Then at the five-hour mark he bored a
            hole through the candle with a red-hot wire. I have already shown you the wire, with a
            smooth coat of tallow on it—tallow that had been melted and had cooled. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1355">"With labor—very hard labor, I should say—he struggled up through the stiff
            chaparral that clothes the steep hillside back of Flint Buckner's place, tugging an
            empty flour-barrel with him. He placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place, and in
            the bottom of it he set the candlestick. Then he measured off about thirty-five feet of
            fuse—the barrel's distance from the back of the cabin. He bored a hole in the side
            of the barrel—here is the large gimlet he did it with. He went on and finished his
            work; and when it was done, one end of the fuse was in Buckner's cabin, and the other
            end, with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder, was in the hole in the
            candle—timed to blow the place up at one o'clock this morning, provided the candle
            was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening—which I am betting it was—and
            provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the
            fuse—which I am also betting there was, though I can't prove it. Boys, the barrel
            is there in the chaparral, the candle's remains are in it in the tin stick; the
            burnt-out fuse is in the gimlet-hole, the other end is down the hill where the late
            cabin stood. I saw them all an hour or two ago, when the Professor here was measuring
            off unimplicated vacancies and collecting relics that hadn't anything to do with the
            case." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1357">He paused. The house drew a long, deep breath, shook its strained cords and muscles
            free and burst into cheers. "Dang him!" said Ham Sandwich, "that's why he was snooping
            around in the chaparral, instead of picking up points out of the P'fessor's game. Looky
            here—he ain't no fool, boys." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1359">"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1361">But Stillman was resuming: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1363">"While we were out yonder an hour or two ago, the owner of the gimlet and the trial
            candle took them from a place where he had concealed them—it was not a good
            place—and carried them to what he probably thought was a better one, two hundred
            yards up in the pine woods, and hid them there, covering them over with pine needles. It
            was there that I found them. The gimlet exactly fits the hole in the barrel. And
            now—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1365">The Extraordinary Man interrupted him. He said, sarcastically: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1367">"We have had a very pretty fairy tale, gentlemen—very pretty indeed. Now I would
            like to ask this young man a question or two." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1370">Some of the boys winced, and Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1372">"I'm afraid Archy's going to catch it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1374">The others lost their smiles and sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1376">"Let us proceed to examine into this fairy tale in a consecutive and orderly
            way—by geometrical progression, so to speak—linking detail to detail in a
            steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent and unassailable march upon this tinsel
            toy fortress of error, the dream fabric of a callow imagination. To begin with, young
            sir, I desire to ask you but three questions at present—<i>at
              present.</i> Did I understand you to say it was your opinion that the supposititious
            candle was lighted at about eight o'clock yesterday evening?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1381">"Yes, sir—about eight." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1383">"Could you say exactly eight?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1385">"Well, no, I couldn't be that exact." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1387">"Um. If a person had been passing along there just about that time, he would have been
            almost sure to encounter that assassin, do you think?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1389">"Yes, I should think so." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1391">"Thank you, that is all. For the present. I say, all <i>for the
              present."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1396">"Dern him. he's laying for Archy," said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1399">"It's so," said Ham Sandwich. "I don't like the look of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1401">Stillman said, glancing at the guest, "I was along there myself at half-past
            eight—no, about nine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1403">"In-deed? This is interesting—this is very interesting. Perhaps you encountered
            the assassin?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1405">"No, I encountered no one." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1407">"Ah. Then—if you will excuse the remark—I do not quite see the relevancy of
            the information." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1409">"It has none. At present. I say it has none—at present." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1411">He paused. Presently he resumed: "I did not encounter the assassin, but I am on his
            track, I am sure, for I believe he is in this room. I will ask you all to pass one by
            one in front of me—here, where there is a good light—so that I can see your
            feet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1413">A buzz of excitement swept the place, and the march began, the guest looking on with an
            iron attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified success. Stillman stooped, shaded
            his eyes with his hand, and gazed down intently at each pair of feet as it passed. Fifty
            men tramped monotonously by—with no result. Sixty. Seventy. The thing was
            beginning to look absurd. The guest remarked, with suave irony:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1415">"Stillman Accuses Sherlock Holmes"Image of Stillman pointing a finger at Sherlock Holmes</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1421">"Assassins appear to be scarce this evening." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1423">The house saw the humor if it, and refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. Ten or twelve
            more candidates tramped by—no, <i>danced </i>by, with airy and
            ridiculous capers which convulsed the spectators—then suddenly Stillman put out
            his hand and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1429">"This is the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1431">"Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhedrim!" roared the crowd; and at once let fly a
            pyrotechnic explosion and dazzle and confusion of stirring remarks inspired by the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1433">At the height of the turmoil the guest stretched out his hand, commanding peace. The
            authority of a great name and a great personality laid its mysterious compulsion upon
            the house, and it obeyed. Out of the panting calm which succeeded, the guest spoke,
            saying, with dignity and feeling: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1435"><i>"This</i> is serious. It strikes at an innocent life. Innocent
            beyond suspicion! Innocent beyond peradventure! Hear me <i>prove</i> it;
            observe how simple a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie. Listen. My
            friends, that lad was never out of my sight yesterday evening at <i>any</i> time!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1445">It made a deep impression. Men turned their eyes upon Stillman with grave inquiry in
            them. His face brightened, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1447">"I <i>knew</i> there was another one!" He stepped briskly to the table
            and glanced at the guest's feet, then up at his face, and said: "You were <i>with</i> him! You were not fifty steps from him when he lit the candle
            that by and by fired the powder!" <i>(Sensation.) "</i>And what is more,
            you furnished the matches yourself !" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1458">Plainly the guest seemed hit; it looked so to the public. He opened his mouth to speak;
            the words did not come freely. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1460">"This—er—this is insanity—this—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1462">Stillman pressed his evident advantage home. He held up a charred match. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1464">"Here <i>is</i> one of them. I found it in the barrel—and there's
              <i>another</i> one there." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1472">The guest found his voice at once. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1475"><i>"Yes—</i>and put them there yourself!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1479">It was recognized a good shot. Stillman retorted. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1481">"It is <i>wax—</i>a breed unknown to this camp. I am ready to be
            searched for the box. Are you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1486">The guest was staggered this time—the dullest eye could see it. He fumbled with
            his hands; once or twice his lips moved, but the words did not come. The house waited
            and watched, in tense suspense, the stillness adding effect to the situation. Presently
            Stillman said, gently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1488">"We are waiting for your decision." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1490">There was silence again during several moments; then the guest answered, in a low
            voice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1492">"I refuse to be searched." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1494">There was no noisy demonstration, but all about the house one voice after another
            muttered: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1496">"That settles it! He's Archy's meat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1498">What to do now? Nobody seemed to know. It was an embarrassing situation for the
            moment—merely, of course, because matters had taken such a sudden and unexpected
            turn that these unpractised minds were not prepared for it, and had come to a
            standstill, like a stopped clock, under the shock. But after a little the machinery
            began to work again, tentatively, and by twos and threes the men put their heads
            together and privately buzzed over this and that and the other proposition. One of these
            propositions met with much favor; it was, to confer upon the assassin a vote of thanks
            for removing Flint Buckner, and let him go. But the cooler heads opposed it, pointing
            out that addled brains in the Eastern states would pronounce it a scandal, and make no
            end of foolish noise about it. Finally the cool heads got the upper hand, and obtained
            general consent to a proposition of their own; their leader then called the house to
            order and stated it—to this effect: that Fetlock Jones be jailed and put upon
            trial. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1500">The motion was carried. Apparently there was nothing further to do now, and the people
            were glad, for, privately, they were impatient to get out and rush to the scene of the
            tragedy, and see whether that barrel and the other things were really there or not. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1503">But no—the break-up got a check. The surprises were not over yet. For a while
            Fetlock Jones had been silently sobbing, unnoticed in the absorbing excitements which
            had been following one another so persistently for some time; but when his arrest and
            trial were decreed, he broke out despairingly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1505">"No! it's no use. I don't want any jail, I don't want any trial; I've had all the hard
            luck I want, and all the miseries. Hang me now, and let me out! It would all come out,
            anyway—there couldn't anything save me. He has told it all, just as if he'd been
            with me and seen it—<i>I</i> don't know how he found out; and
            you'll find the barrel and things, and then I wouldn't have any chance any more. I
            killed him; and <i>you'd</i> have done it too, if he'd treated you like
            a dog, and you only a boy, and weak and poor, and not a friend to help you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1513">"And served him damned well right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. "Looky here, boys—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1515">From the constable: "Order! Order, gentlemen!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1517">A voice: "Did your uncle know what you was up to?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1519">"No, he didn't." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1521">"Did he give you the matches, sure enough?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1523">"Yes, he did; but he didn't know what I wanted them for." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1525">"When you was out on such a business as that, how did you venture to risk having him
            along—and him a <i>detective?</i> How's that?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1530">The boy hesitated, fumbled with his buttons in an embarrassed way, then said, shyly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1532">"I know about detectives, on account of having them in the family; and if you don't
            want them to find out about a thing, it's best to have them around when you do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1535">The cyclone of laughter which greeted this native discharge of wisdom did not modify
            the poor little waif's embarrassment in any large degree.</p>Chapter IX<p id="TwaDoubd1e1540">From a letter to Mrs. Stillman, dated merely "Tuesday." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1542">Fetlock Jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log cabin, and left there
              to await his trial. Constable Harris provided him with a couple of days' rations,
              instructed him to keep a good guard over himself, and promised to look in on him as
              soon as further supplies should be due. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1545">Next morning a score of us went with Hillyer, out of friendship, and helped him bury
              his late relative, the unlamented Buckner, and I acted as first assistant pall-bearer,
              Hillyer acting as chief. Just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy
              stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, limped by with his head down, and I caught the
              scent I had chased around the globe! It was the odor of Paradise to my perishing hope!
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1548">In a moment I was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder. He
              slumped to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had withered him in his tracks; and
              as the boys came running he struggled to his knees and put up his pleading hands to
              me, and out of his chattering jaws he begged me to persecute him no more, and said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1551">"You have hunted me around the world, Sherlock Holmes, yet God is my witness I have
              never done any man harm!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1554">A glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane. That was my work, mother!
              The tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery I felt in that moment, but
              nothing else can ever do it. The boys lifted him up, and gathered about him, and were
              full of pity of him, and said the gentlest and touchingest things to him, and said
              cheer up and don't be troubled, he was among friends now, and they would take care of
              him, and protect him, and hang any man that laid a hand on him. They are just like so
              many mothers, the rough mining-camp boys are, when you wake up the south side of their
              hearts; yes, and just like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up
              the opposite of that muscle. They did everything they could think of to comfort him,
              but nothing succeeded until Wells-Fargo Ferguson, who is a clever strategist, said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1557">"If it's only Sherlock Holmes that's troubling you, you needn't worry any more."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1560">"Why?" asked the forlorn lunatic, eagerly. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1563">"Because he's dead again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1566">"Dead! Dead! Oh, don't trifle with a poor wreck like me. <i>Is
              </i>he dead? On honor, now—is he telling me true, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1573">"True as you're standing there!" said Ham Sandwich, and they all backed up the
              statement in a body. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1576">"They hung him in San Bernardino last week," added Ferguson, clinching the matter,
              "whilst he was searching around after you. Mistook him for another man. They're sorry,
              but they can't help it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1579">"They're a-building him a monument," said Ham Sandwich, with the air of a person who
              had contributed to it, and knew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1582">"James Walker" drew a deep sigh—evidently a sigh of relief—and said
              nothing; but his eyes lost something of their wildness, his countenance cleared
              visibly, and its drawn look relaxed a little. We all went to our cabin, and the boys
              cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for, and while they
              were about it Hillyer and I outfitted him from hat to shoe-leather with new clothes of
              ours, and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him. "Old" is the right word,
              and a pity, too: old by the droop of him, and the frost upon his hair, and the marks
              which sorrow and distress have left upon his face; though he is only in his prime in
              the matter of years. While he ate, we smoked and chatted; and when he was finishing he
              found his voice at last, and of his own accord broke out with his personal history. I
              cannot furnish his exact words, but I will come as near it as I can. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1585">THE "WRONG MAN'S" STORY </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1588">It happened like this: I was in Denver. I had been there many years; sometimes I
              remember how many, sometimes I don't—but it isn't any matter. All of a sudden I
              got a notice to leave, or I would be exposed for a horrible crime committed long
              before—years and years before—in the East. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1591">I knew about that crime, but I was not the criminal; it was a cousin of mine of the
              same name. What should I better do? My head was all disordered by fear, and I didn't
              know. I was allowed very little time—only one day, I think it was. I would be
              ruined if I was published, and the people would lynch me, and not believe what I said.
              It is always the way with lynchings: when they find out it is a mistake they are
              sorry, but it is too late—the same as it was with Mr. Holmes, you see. So I said
              I would sell out and get money to live on, and run away until it blew over and I could
              come back with my proofs. Then I escaped in the night and went a long way off in the
              mountains somewhere, and lived disguised and had a false name. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1594">I got more and more troubled and worried, and my troubles made me see spirits and
              hear voices, and I could not think straight and clear on any subject, but got confused
              and involved and had to give it up, because my head hurt so. It got to be worse and
              worse; more spirits and more voices. They were about me all the time; at first only in
              the night, then in the day too. They were always whispering around my bed and plotting
              against me, and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out, because I got no good rest.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1597">And then came the worst. One night the whispers said, "We'll never manage, because
              we can't <i>see</i> him, and so can't point him out to the people."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1603">They sighed; then one said: "We must bring Sherlock Holmes. He can be here in twelve
              days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1606">They all agreed, and whispered and jibbered with joy. But my heart broke; for I had
              read about that man, and knew what it would be to have him upon my track, with his
              superhuman penetration and tireless energies. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1610">The spirits went away to fetch him, and I got up at once in the middle of the night
              and fled away, carrying nothing but the hand-bag that had my money in it—thirty
              thousand dollars; two-thirds of it are in the bag there yet. It was forty days before
              that man caught up on my track. I just escaped. From habit he had written his real
              name on a tavern register, but had scratched it out and written "Dagget Barclay" in
              the place of it. But fear gives you a watchful eye and keen, and I read the true name
              through the scratches, and fled like a deer. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1613">He has hunted me all over this world for three years and a half—the Pacific
              states, Australasia, India—everywhere you can think of; then back to Mexico and
              up to California again, giving me hardly any rest; but that name on the registers
              always saved me, and what is left of me is alive yet. And I am <i>so</i> tired! A cruel time he has given me, yet I give you my honor I have never
              harmed him nor any man. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1619">That was the end of the story, and it stirred those boys to bloodheat, he sure of
              it. As for me—each word burnt a hole in me where it struck. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1622">We voted that the old man should bunk with us, and be my guest and Hillyer's. I
              shall keep my own counsel, naturally; but as soon as he is well rested and nourished,
              I shall take him to Denver and rehabilitate his fortunes. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1625">The boys gave the old fellow the bone-smashing good-fellowship handshake of the
              mines, and then scattered away to spread the news. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1628">At dawn next morning Wells-Fargo Ferguson and Ham Sandwich called us softly out, and
              said, privately: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1631">"That news about the way that old stranger has been treated has spread all around,
              and the camps are up. They are piling in from everywhere, and are going to lynch the
              P'fessor. Constable Harris is in a dead funk, and has telephoned the sheriff. Come
              along!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1634">We started on a run. The others were privileged to feel as they chose, but in my
              heart's privacy I hoped the sheriff would arrive in time; for I had small desire that
              Sherlock Holmes should hang for my deeds, as you can easily believe. I had heard a
              good deal about the sheriff, but </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1637">for reassurance's sake I asked: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1640">"Can he stop a mob?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1643">"Can <i>he</i> stop a mob! Can Jack <i>Fairfax</i>
              stop a mob! Well, I should smile! Ex-desperado—nineteen scalps on his string.
              Can <i>he!</i> Oh, I <i>say!"</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1659">As we tore up the gulch, distant cries and shouts and yells rose faintly on the
              still air, and grew steadily in strength as we raced along. Roar after roar burst out,
              stronger and stronger, nearer and nearer; and at last, when we closed up upon the
              multitude massed in the open area in front of the tavern, the crash of sound was
              deafening. Some brutal roughs from Daly's gorge had Holmes in their grip, and he was
              the calmest man there; a contemptuous smile played about his lips, and if any fear of
              death was in his British heart, his iron personality was master of it and no sign of
              it was allowed to appear. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1662">"Come to a vote, men!" This from one of the Daly gang, Shadbelly Higgins. "Quick! is
              it hang, or shoot?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1665">"Neither!" shouted one of his comrades. "He'll he alive again in a week; burning's
              the only permanency for <i>him."</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1671">The gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a thundercrash of approval, and
              went struggling and surging toward the prisoner, and closed around him, shouting,
              "Fire! fire's the ticket!" They dragged him to the horse-post, backed him against it,
              chained him to it, and piled wood and pine cones around him waist-deep. Still the
              strong face did not blench, and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1674">"A match! fetch a match!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1677">Shadbelly struck it, shaded it with his hand, stooped, and held it under a pine
              cone. A deep silence fell upon the mob. The cone caught, a tiny flame flickered about
              it a moment or two. I seemed to catch the sound of distant hoofs—it grew more
              distinct—still more and more distinct, more and more definite, but the absorbed
              crowd did not appear to notice it. The match went out. The man struck another,
              stooped, and again the flame rose; this time it took hold and began to
              spread—here and there men turned away their faces. The executioner stood with
              the charred match in his fingers, watching his work. The hoof-beats turned a
              projecting crag, and now they came thundering down upon us. Almost the next moment
              there was a shout: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1680">"The sheriff!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1683">And straightway he came tearing into the midst, stood his horse almost on his hind
              feet, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1686">"Fall back, you gutter-snipes!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1689">He was obeyed. By all but their leader. He stood his ground, and his hand went to
              his revolver. The sheriff covered him promptly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1692">"Drop your hand, you parlor desperado. Kick the fire away. Now unchain the
              stranger." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1696">The parlor desperado obeyed. Then the sheriff made a speech; sitting his horse at
              martial ease, and not warming his words with any touch of fire, but delivering them in
              a measured and deliberate way, and in a tone which harmonized with their character and
              made them impressively disrespectful. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1699">"You're a nice lot—now ain't you? Just about eligible to travel with this bilk
              here—Shadbelly Higgins—this loud-mouthed sneak that shoots people in the
              back and calls himself a desperado. If there's anything I do particularly despise,
              it's a lynching mob; I've never seen one that had a man in it. It has to tally up a
              hundred against one before it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor. It's
              made up of cowards, and so is the community that breeds it; and ninety-nine times out
              of a hundred the sheriff's another one." He paused—apparently to turn that last
              idea over in his mind and taste the juice of it—then he went on: "The sheriff
              that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the lowest-down coward there is. By
              the statistics there was a hundred and eighty-two of them drawing sneak pay in America
              last year. By the way it's going, pretty soon there 'll be a new disease in the
                doctor-books—<i>sheriff complaint."</i> That idea pleased
              him—any one could see it. "People will say, 'Sheriff sick again?' 'Yes; got the
              same old thing.' And next there 'll be a new title. People won't say, 'He's running
              for sheriff of Rapaho County,' for instance; they'll say, 'He's running for Coward of
              Rapaho.' Lord, the idea of a grown-up person being afraid of a lynch mob!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1705">He turned an eye on the captive, and said, "Stranger, who are you, and what have you
              been doing?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1708">"My name is Sherlock Holmes, and I have not been doing anything." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1711">It was wonderful, the impression which the sound of that name made on the sheriff,
              notwithstanding he must have come posted. He spoke up with feeling, and said it was a
              blot on the county that a man whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their
              fame and their ingenuity, and whose histories of them had won every reader's heart by
              the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting, should be visited under the Stars
              and Stripes by an outrage like this. He apologized in the name of the whole nation,
              and made Holmes a most handsome bow, and told Constable Harris to see him to his
              quarters, and hold himself personally responsible if he was molested again. Then he
              turned to the mob and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1714">"Hunt your holes, you scum!" which they did; then he said: "Follow me, Shadbelly;
              I'll take care of your case myself. No—keep your popgun; whenever I see the day
              that I'll be afraid to have you behind me with that thing, it 'll be time for me to
              join last year's hundred and eighty-two"; and he rode off in a walk, Shadbelly
              following. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1717">When we were on our way back to our cabin, toward breakfast-time, we ran upon the
              news that Fetlock Jones had escaped from his lock-up in the night and is gone! Nobody
              is sorry. Let his uncle track him out if he likes; it is in his line; the camp is not
              interested.</p>Chapter X<p id="TwaDoubd1e1723"><i>Ten days later.</i>

There has been a
            wedding, between a handsome young man of slender means and a rich young girl—a
            case of love at first sight and a precipitate marriage; a marriage bitterly opposed by
            the girl's widowed father. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e140">Jacob Fuller, the bridegroom, is twenty-six years old, is of an old but unconsidered
            family which had by compulsion emigrated from Sedgemoor, and for King James's purse's
            profit, so everybody said—some maliciously the rest merely because they believed
            it. The bride is nineteen and beautiful. She is intense, high-strung, romantic,
            immeasurably proud of her Cavalier blood, and passionate in her love for her young
            husband. For its sake she braved her father's displeasure, endured his reproaches,
            listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions and went from his house
            without his blessing, proud and happy in the proofs she was thus giving of the quality
            of the affection which had made its home in her heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e142">The morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her. Her husband put aside
            her proffered caresses, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e144">"Sit down. I have something to say to you. I loved you. That was before I asked your
            father to give you to me. His refusal is not my grievance—I could have endured
            that. But the things he said of me to you—that is a different matter.
            There—you needn't speak; I know quite well what they were; I got them from
            authentic sources. Among other things he said that my character was written in my face;
            that I was treacherous, a dissembler, a coward, and a brute without sense of pity or
            compassion: the 'Sedgemoor trade-mark,' he called it—and 'white-sleeve badge.' Any
            other man in my place would have gone to his house and shot him down like a dog. I
            wanted to do it, and was minded to do it, but a better thought came to me: to put him to
            shame; to break his heart; to kill him by inches. How to do it? Through my treatment of
            you, his idol! I would marry you; and then—Have patience. You will see. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e146">From that moment onward, for three months, the young wife suffered all the
            humiliations, all the insults, all the miseries that the diligent and inventive mind of
            the husband could contrive, save physical injuries only. Her strong pride stood by her,
            and she kept the secret of her troubles. Now and then the husband said, "Why don't you
            go to your father and tell him?" Then he invented new tortures, applied them, and asked
            again. She always answered, "He shall never know by my mouth," and taunted him with his
            origin; said she was the lawful slave of a scion of slaves, and must obey, and
            would—up to that point, but no further; he could kill her if he liked, but he
            could not break her; it was not in the Sedgemoor breed to do it. At the end of the three
            months he said, with a dark significance in his manner, "I have tried all things but
            one"—and waited for her reply. "Try that," she said, and curled her lip in
            mockery. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e148">That night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes, then said to her: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e150">"Get up and dress!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e152">She obeyed—as always, without a word. He led her half a mile from the house, and
            proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public road; and succeeded, she
            screaming and struggling. He gagged her then, struck her across the face with his
            cowhide, and set his bloodhounds on her. They tore the clothes off her, and she was
            naked. He called the dogs off, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e154">"You will be found—by the passing public. They will be dropping along about three
            hours from now, and will spread the news—do you hear? Good-by. You have seen the
            last of me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e156">He went away then. She moaned to herself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e159">"I shall bear a child—to <i>him!</i> God grant it may be a boy!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e164">The farmers released her by and by—and spread the news, which was natural. They
            raised the country with lynching intentions, but the bird had flown. The young wife shut
            herself up in her father's house; he shut himself up with her, and thenceforth would see
            no one. His pride was broken, and his heart; so he wasted away, day by day, and even his
            daughter rejoiced when death relieved him. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e166">Then she sold the estate and disappeared.</p>Chapter 2<p id="TwaDoubd1e171">In 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded New England village,
            with no company but a little boy about five years old. She did her own work, she
            discouraged acquaintanceships, and had none. The butcher, the baker, and the others that
            served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was
            Stillman, and that she called the child Archy. Whence she came they had not been able to
            find out, but they said she talked like a Southerner. The child had no playmates and no
            comrade, and no teacher but the mother. She taught him diligently and intelligently, and
            was satisfied with the results—even a little proud of them. One day Archy said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e173">"Mamma, am I different from other children?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e175">"Well, I suppose not. Why?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e177">"There was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had been by and I
            said yes, and she said how long since I saw him and I said I hadn't seen him at all, and
            she said how did I know he'd been by, then, and I said because I smelt his track on the
            sidewalk, and she said I was a dum fool and made a mouth at me. What did she do that
            for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e179">The young woman turned white, and said to herself, "It's a birth mark! The gift of the
            bloodhound is in him." She snatched the boy to her breast and hugged him passionately,
            saying, "God has appointed the way!" Her eyes were burning with a fierce light, and her
            breath came short and quick with excitement. She said to herself: "The puzzle is solved
            now; many a time it has been a mystery to me, the impossible things the child has done
            in the dark, but it is all clear to me now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e181">She set him in his small chair, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e183">"Wait a little till I come, dear; then we will talk about the matter." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e185">She went up to her room and took from her dressing-table several small articles and put
            them out of sight: a nail-file on the floor under the bed; a pair of nail-scissors under
            the bureau; a small ivory paper-knife under the wardrobe. Then she returned, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e187">"There! I have left some things which I ought to have brought down." She named them,
            and said, "Run up and bring them, dear." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e189">The child hurried away on his errand and was soon back again with the things. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e192">"Did you have any difficulty, dear?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e194">"No, mamma; I only went where you went." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e196">During his absence she had stepped to the bookcase, taken several books from the bottom
            shelf, opened each, passed her hand over a page, noting its number in her memory, then
            restored them to their places. Now she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e198">"I have been doing something while you have been gone, Archy. Do you think you can find
            out what it was?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e200">The boy went to the bookcase and got out the books that had been touched, and opened
            them at the pages which had been stroked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e202">The mother took him in her lap, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e204">"I will answer your question now, dear. I have found out that in one way you are quite
            different from other people. You can see in the dark, you can smell what other people
            cannot, you have the talents of a bloodhound. They are good and valuable things to have,
            but you must keep the matter a secret. If people found it out, they would speak of you
            as an odd child, a strange child, and children would be disagreeable to you, and give
            you nicknames. In this world one must be like everybody else if he doesn't want to
            provoke scorn or envy or jealousy. It is a great and fine distinction which has been
            born to you, and I am glad; but you will keep it a secret, for mamma's sake, won't you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e206">The child promised, without understanding. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e208">All the rest of the day the mother's brain was busy with excited thinkings; with plans,
            projects, schemes, each and all of them uncanny, grim, and dark. Yet they lit up her
            face; lit it with a fell light of their own; lit it with vague fires of hell. She was in
            a fever of unrest; she could not sit, stand, read, sew; there was no relief for her but
            in movement. She tested her boy's gift in twenty ways, and kept saying to herself all
            the time, with her mind in the past: "He broke my father's heart, and night and day all
            these years I have tried, and all in vain, to think out a way to break his. I have found
            it now—I have found it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e210">When night fell, the demon of unrest still possessed her. She went on with her tests;
            with a candle she traversed the house from garret to cellar, hiding pins, needles,
            thimbles, spools, under pillows, under carpets, in cracks in the walls, under the coal
            in the bin; then sent the little fellow in the dark to find them; which he did, and was
            happy and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e212">From this time forward life took on a new complexion for her. She said, "The future is
            secure—I can wait, and enjoy the waiting." The most of her lost interests revived.
            She took up music again, and languages, drawing, painting, and the other long-discarded
            delights of her maidenhood. She was happy once more, and felt again the zest of life. As
            the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy, and was contented with it.
            Not altogether, but nearly that. The soft side of his heart was larger than the other
            side of it. It was his only defect, in her eyes. But she considered that his love for
            her and worship of her made up for it. He was a good hater—that was well; but it
            was a question if the materials of his hatreds were of as tough and enduring a quality
            as those of his friendships—and that was not so well. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e215">The years drifted on. Archy was become a handsome, shapely, athletic youth, courteous,
            dignified, companionable, pleasant in his ways, and looking perhaps a trifle older than
            he was, which was sixteen. One evening his mother said she had something of grave
            importance to say to him, adding that he was old enough to hear it now, and old enough
            and possessed of character enough and stability enough to carry out a stern plan which
            she had been for years contriving and maturing. Then she told him her bitter story, in
            all its naked atrociousness. For a while the boy was paralyzed; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e217">"I understand. We are Southerners; and by our custom and nature there is but one
            atonement. I will search him out and kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e219">"Kill him? No! Death is release, emancipation; death is a favor. Do I owe him favors?
            You must not hurt a hair of his head." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e221">The boy was lost in thought awhile; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e223">"You are all the world to me, and your desire is my law and my pleasure. Tell me what
            to do and I will do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e225">The mother's eyes beamed with satisfaction, and she said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e227">"You will go and find him. I have known his hiding-place for eleven years; it cost me
            five years and more of inquiry, and much money, to locate it. He is a quartz-miner in
            Colorado, and well-to-do. He lives in Denver. His name is Jacob Fuller. There—it
            is the first time I have spoken it since that unforgettable night. Think! That name
            could have been yours if I had not saved you that shame and furnished you a cleaner one.
            You will drive him from that place; you will hunt him down and drive him again; and yet
            again, and again, and again, persistently, relentlessly, poisoning his life, filling it
            with mysterious terrors, loading it with weariness and misery, making him wish for
            death, and that he had a suicide's courage; you will make of him another Wandering Jew;
            he shall know no rest any more, no peace of mind, no placid sleep; you shall shadow him,
            cling to him, persecute him, till you break his heart, as he broke my father's and
            mine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e229">"I will obey, mother." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e231">"I believe it, my child. The preparations are all made; everything is ready. Here is a
            letter of credit; spend freely, there is no lack of money. At times you may need
            disguises. I have provided them; also some other conveniences." She took from the drawer
            of the typewriter-table several squares of paper. They all bore these typewritten
            words:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e233"><i>$10,000 REWARD</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e237"><i>It is believed that a certain man who is wanted in an Eastern
                state is sojourning here. In 1880, in the night, he tied his young wife to a tree by
                the public road, cut her across the face with a cowhide, and made his dogs tear her
                clothes from her, leaving her naked. He left her there, and fled the country. A

            night and placard one of these upon the building he occupies, and another one upon the

            first you must give him several days in which to force a sale of his belongings at
            something approaching their value. We will ruin him by and by, but gradually; we must
            not impoverish him at once, for that could bring him to despair and injure his health,
            possibly kill him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e244">She took three or four more typewritten forms from the
            drawer—duplicates—and read one:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e246">. . . . . . . . . ., . . . . . . . . . ., 18. . . .</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e249"><i>To Jacob Fuller:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e253"><i>You have . . . . . . days in which to settle your affairs. You

                Fuller. I have his scent; I could track him through ten divisions of infantry and
                find him. I have often been near him and heard him talk. He owns a good mine, and
                has a fair income from it; but he is not rich. He learned mining in a good
                way—by working at it for wages. He is a cheerful creature, and his forty-three
                years sit lightly upon him; he could pass for a younger man—say thirty-six or
                thirty-seven. He has never married again—passes himself off for a widower. He
                stands well, is liked, is popular, and has many friends. Even I feel a drawing
                toward him—the paternal blood in me making its claim. How blind and
                unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature—the most of them, in
                fact! My task is become hard now—you realize it? you comprehend, and make
                allowances?—and the fire of it has cooled, more than I like to confess to
                myself, But I will carry it out. Even with the pleasure paled, the duty remains, and
                I will not spare him.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e286"><i>And for my help, a sharp resentment rises in me when I reflect
                that he who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not suffered by it.
                The lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character, and in the change he is
                happy. He, the guilty party, is absolved from all suffering; you, the innocent, are
                borne down with it. But be comforted—he shall harvest his share.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e290">SILVER GULCH, <i>May 19</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e295"><i>I placarded Form No. 1 at midnight of April 3; an hour later I
                slipped Form No. 2 under his chamber door, notifying him to leave Denver at or
                before 11.50 the night of the 14th.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e299"><i>Some late bird of a reporter stole one of my placards, then hunted
                the town over and found the other one, and stole that. In this manner he
                accomplished what the profession call a "scoop"—that is, he got a valuable
                item, and saw to it that no other paper got it. And so his paper—the principal
                one in the town—had it in glaring type on the editorial page in the morning,
                followed by a Vesuvian opinion of our wretch a column long, which wound up by adding
                a thousand dollars to our reward on the paper's account! The journals out here know
                how to do the noble thing—when there's business in it.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e303"><i>At breakfast I occupied my usual seat—selected because it
                afforded a view of papa Fuller's face, and was near enough for me to hear the talk
                that went on at his table. Seventy-five or a hundred people were in the room, and
                all discussing that item, and saying they hoped the seeker would find that rascal
                and remove the pollution of his presence from the town—with a rail, or a
                bullet, or something.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e307"><i>When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leave—folded
                up—in one hand, and the newspaper in the other; and it gave me more than half
                a pang to see him. His cheerfulness was all gone, and he looked old and pinched and
                ashy. And then—only think of the things he had to listen to! Mamma, he heard
                his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and characterizations drawn
                from the very dictionaries and phrase-books of Satan's own authorized editions down
                below. And more than that, he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them. His
                applause tasted bitter in his mouth, though; he could not disguise that from me; and
                it was observable that his appetite was gone; he only nibbled; he couldn't eat.
                Finally a man said:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e311"><i>"It is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing
                what this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel. I hope so."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e316"><i>Ah, dear, it was pitiful the way Fuller winced, and glanced around
                scared! He couldn't endure any more, and got up and left.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e320"><i>During several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in
                Mexico, and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could, and give the
                property his personal attention. He played his cards well; said he would take
                $40,000—a quarter in cash, the rest in safe notes; but that as he greatly
                needed money on account of his new purchase, he would diminish his terms for cash in
                full, He sold out for $30,000. And then, what do you think he did? He asked for
                greenbacks, and took them, saying the man in Mexico was a New-Englander, with a head
                full of crotchets, and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts. People thought it
                queer, since a draft on New York could produce greenbacks quite conveniently. There
                was talk of this odd thing, but only for a day; that is as long as any topic lasts
                in Denver.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e324"><i>I was watching, all the time. As soon as the sale was completed
                and the money paid—which was on the 11th—I began to stick to Fuller's
                track without dropping it for a moment. That night—no, 12th, for it was a
                little past midnight—I tracked him to his room, which was four doors from mine
                in the same hall; then I went back and put on my muddy day-laborer disguise,
                darkened my complexion, and sat down in my room in the gloom, with a gripsack handy,
                with a change in it, and my door ajar. For I suspected that the bird would take wing
                now. In half an hour an old woman passed by, carrying a grip: I caught the familiar
                whiff, and followed with my grip, for it was Fuller. He left the hotel by a side
                entrance, and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three
                blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness, and got into a two-horse hack, which of
                course was waiting for him by appointment. I took a seat (uninvited) on the trunk
                platform behind, and we drove briskly off. We drove ten miles, and the hack stopped
                at a way-station and was discharged. Fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow
                under the awning, as far as he could get from the light; I went inside, and watched
                the ticket-office. Fuller bought no ticket; I bought none. Presently the train came
                along, and he boarded a car; I entered the same car at the other end, and came down
                the aisle and took the seat behind him. When he paid the conductor and named his
                objective point, I dropped back several seats, while the conductor was changing a
                bill, and when he came to me I paid to the same place—about a hundred miles
                westward.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e328"><i>From that time for a week on end he led me a dance. He traveled
                here and there and yonder—always on a general westward trend—but he boas
                not a woman after the first day. He was a laborer, like myself, and wore bushy false
                whiskers. His outfit was perfect, and he could do the character without thinking
                about it, for he had served the trade for wages. His nearest friend could not have
                recognized him. At last he located himself here, the obscurest little mountain camp
                in Montana; he has a shanty, and goes out prospecting daily; is gone all day, and
                avoids society. I am living at a miner's boardinghouse, and it is an awful place:
                the bunks, the food, the dirt—everything.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e332"><i>We have been here four weeks, and in that time I have seen him but
                once; but every night I go over his track and post myself. As soon as he engaged a
                shanty here I went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed that Denver hotel to
                keep my baggage till I should send for it. I need nothing here but a change of army
                shirts, and I brought that with me.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e336">SILVER GULCH, <i>June 12</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e341"><i>The Denver episode has never found its way here, I think. I know
                the most of the men in camp, and they have never referred to it, at least in my
                hearing. Fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions. He has located a
                claim, two miles away, in an out-of-the-way place in the mountains; it promises very
                well, and he is working it diligently. Ah, but the change in him! He never smiles,
                and he keeps quite to himself, consorting with no one—he who was so fond of
                company and so cheery only two months ago. I have seen him passing along several
                times recently—drooping, forlorn, the spring gone from his step, a pathetic

                and edible food, and endurable beds, and bodily decency; then I will fetch my

                than the other one; he came here a young widower in '79, aged twenty-one—a
                year before you were married; and the documents to prove it are innumerable. Last
                night I talked with familiar friends of his who have known him from the day of his
                arrival. I said nothing, but a few days from now I will land him in this town again,
                with the loss upon his mine made good; and there will be a banquet, and a
                torch-light procession, and there will not be any expense on anybody but me. Do you

                have not been able to think it out, and I have tried till my brains are addled. "If
                the gentleman who lately bought a mine in Mexico and sold one in Denver will send
                his address to" (to whom, mother!), "it will be explained to him that it was all a
                mistake; his forgiveness will be asked, and full reparation made for a loss which he
                sustained in a certain matter." Do you see? He would think it a trap. Well, any one
                would. If I should say, "It is now known that he was not the man wanted, but another
                man—a man who once bore the same name, but discarded it for good
                reasons"—would that answer? But the Denver people would wake up then and say
                "Oho!" and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks, and say, "Why did he
                run away if he wasn't the right man?—it is too thin." If I failed to find him
                he would be ruined there—there where there is no taint upon him now. You have

                mistake; a dog would have gone the other way. But I am only part dog, and can get
                very humanly stupid when excited. He had been stopping in that house ten days; I
                almost know, now, that he stops long nowhere, the past six or eight months, but is
                restless and has to keep moving. I understand that feeling! and I know what it is to
                feel it. He still uses the name he had registered when I came so near catching him
                nine months ago—"James Walker"; doubtless the same he adopted when he fled
                from Silver Gulch. An unpretending man, and has small taste for fancy names. I

                Hope Cañon; I traced him to a point thirty miles from here, but there I lost
                the trail; some one gave him a lift in a wagon, I suppose. </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e463"><i>I am taking a rest, now—modified by searchings for the lost

                uncomfortably near to losing hope; but the miners in this little camp are good
                fellows, and I am used to their sort this long time back; and their breezy ways
                freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles. I have been here a month. I am
                cabining with a young fellow named "Sammy" Hillyer, about twenty-five, the only son
                of his mother—like me—and loves her dearly, and writes to her every
                week—part of which is like me. He is a timid body, and in the matter of
                intellect—well, he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire; but no
                matter, he is well liked; he is good and fine, and it is meat and bread and rest and
                luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again. I wish "James Walker"
                could have it. He had friends; he liked company. That brings up that picture of him,
                the time that I saw him last. The pathos of it! It comes before me often and often.
                At that very time, poor thing, I was girding up my conscience to make him move on
                again!</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e467"><i>Hillyer's heart is better than mine, better than anybody's in the
                community, I suppose, for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the
                camp—Flint Buckner—and the only man Flint ever talks with or allows to
                talk with him. He says he knows Flint's history, and that it is trouble that has
                made him what he is, and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can. Now
                none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a lodger like Flint
                Buckner, from all I hear about him outside. I think that this one detail will give
                you a better idea of Sammy's character than any labored-out description I could
                furnish you of him. In one of our talks he said something about like this: "Flint is
                a kinsman of mine, and he pours out all his troubles to me—empties his breast
                from time to time, or I reckon it would burst. There couldn't be any unhappier man,
                Archy Stillman; his life had been made up of misery of mind—he isn't near as
                old as he looks. He has lost the feel of reposefulness and peace—oh, years and
                years ago! He doesn't know what good luck is—never has had any; often says he
                wishes he was in the other hell, he is so tired of this one."</i></p>Chapter IV<p id="TwaDoubd1e474"><i>No real gentleman will tell the naked truth in the presence of

            away down in the Esmeralda region. It is a secluded spot, high and remote; recent as to
            discovery; thought by its occupants to be rich in metal—a year or two's
            prospecting will decide that matter one way or the other. For inhabitants, the camp has
            about two hundred miners, one white woman and child, several Chinese washermen, five
            squaws, and a dozen vagrant buck Indians in rabbit-skin robes, battered plug hats, and
            tin-can necklaces. There are no mills as yet; no church, no newspaper. The camp has
            existed but two years; it has made no big strike; the world is ignorant of its name and
            place. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e485">On both sides of the cañon the mountains rise wall-like, three thousand feet,
            and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the
            sun only once a day, when he sails over at noon. The village is a couple of miles long;
            the cabins stand well apart from each other. The tavern is the only "frame"
            house—the only house, one might say. It occupies a central position, and is the
            evening resort of the population. They drink there, and play seven-up and dominoes; also
            billiards, for there is a table, crossed all over with torn places repaired with
            court-plaster; there are some cues, but no leathers; some chipped balls which clatter
            when they run, and do not slow up gradually, but stop suddenly and sit down; there is a
            part of a cube of chalk, with a projecting jag of flint in it; and the man who can score
            six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bar's expense. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e487">Flint Buckner's cabin was the last one of the village, going south; his silver-claim
            was at the other end of the village, northward, and a little beyond the last hut in that
            direction. He was a sour creature, unsociable, and had no companionships. People who had
            tried to get acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him. His history was not
            known. Some believed that Sammy Hillyer knew it; others said no. If asked, Hillyer said
            no, he was not acquainted with it. Flint had a meek English youth of sixteen or
            seventeen with him, whom he treated roughly, both in public and in private; and of
            course this lad was applied to for information, but with no success. Fetlock
            Jones—name of the youth—said that Flint picked him up on a prospecting
            tramp, and as he had neither home nor friends in America, he had found it wise to stay
            and take Buckner's hard usage for the sake of the salary, which was bacon and beans.
            Further than this he could offer no testimony. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e489">Fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now, and under his meek exterior he was
            slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and humiliations which his master had put
            upon him. For the meek suffer bitterly from these hurts; more bitterly, perhaps, than do
            the manlier sort, who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the limit of
            endurance has been reached. Good-hearted people wanted to help Fetlock out of his
            trouble, and tried to get him to leave Buckner; but the boy showed fright at the
            thought, and said he "dasn't." Pat Riley urged him, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e491">"You leave the damned hunks and come with me; don't you be afraid. I'll take care of
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e496">The boy thanked him with tears in his eyes, but shuddered and said he "dasn't risk it";
            he said Flint would catch him alone, some time, in the night, and then—"Oh, it
            makes me sick, Mr. Riley, to think of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e498">Others said, "Run away from him; we'll stake you; skip out for the coast some night."
            But all these suggestions failed; he said Flint would hunt him down and fetch him back,
            just for meanness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e500">The people could not understand this. The boy's miseries went steadily on, week after
            week. It is quite likely that the people would have understood if they had known how he
            was employing his spare time. He slept in an out-cabin near Flint's; and there, nights,
            he nursed his bruises and his humiliations, and studied and studied over a single
            problem—how he could murder Flint Buckner and not be found out. It was the only
            joy he had in life; these hours were the only ones in the twenty-four which he looked
            forward to with eagerness and spent in happiness. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e503">He thought of poison. No—that would not serve; the inquest would reveal where it
            was procured and who had procured it. He thought of a shot in the back in a lonely place
            when Flint would be homeward bound at midnight—his unvarying hour for the trip.
            No—somebody might be near, and catch him. He thought of stabbing him in his sleep.
            No—he might strike an inefficient blow, and Flint would seize him. He examined a
            hundred different ways—none of them would answer; for in even the very obscurest
            and secretest of them there was always the fatal defect of a <i>risk,</i> a chance, a possibility that he might be found out. He would have none of
            that. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e508">But he was patient, endlessly patient. There was no hurry, he said to himself. He would
            never leave Flint till he left him a corpse; there was no hurry—he would find the
            way. It was somewhere, and he would endure shame and pain and misery until he found it.
            Yes, somewhere there was a way which would leave not a trace, not even the faintest clue
            to the murderer—there was no hurry—he would find that way, and
            then—oh, then, it would just be good to be alive! Meantime he would diligently
            keep up his reputation for meekness; and also, as always theretofore, he would allow no
            one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about his oppressor. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e510">Two days before the before-mentioned October morning Flint had bought some things, and
            he and Fetlock had brought them home to Flint's cabin: a fresh box of candles, which
            they put in the corner; a tin can of blasting-powder, which they placed upon the
            candle-box; a keg of blasting-powder, which they placed under Flint's bunk; a huge coil
            of fuse, which they hung on a peg. Fetlock reasoned that Flint's mining operations had
            outgrown the pick, and that blasting was about to begin now. He had seen blasting done,
            and he had a notion of the process, but he had never helped in it. His conjecture was
            right—blasting-time had come. In the morning the pair carried fuse, drills, and
            the powder-can to the shaft; it was now eight feet deep, and to get into it and out of
            it a short ladder was used. They descended, and by command Fetlock held the
            drill—without any instructions as to the right way to hold it—and Flint
            proceeded to strike. The sledge came down; the drill sprang out of Fetlock's hand,
            almost as a matter of course. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e512">"You mangy son of a nigger, is that any way to hold a drill? Pick it up! Stand it up!
            There—hold fast. D— you! <i>I'll</i> teach you!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e517">At the end of an hour the drilling was finished. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e519">"Now, then, charge it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e521">The boy started to pour in the powder. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e523">"Idiot!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e525">A heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e527">"Get up! You can't lie sniveling there. Now, then, stick in the fuse <i>first. Now</i> put in the powder. Hold on, hold on! Are you going to fill the hole
              <i>all</i> up? Of all the sap-headed milksops I—Put in some
            dirt! Put in some gravel! Tamp it down! Hold on, hold on! Oh, great Scott! get out of
            the way!" He snatched the iron and tamped the charge himself, meantime cursing and
            blaspheming like a fiend. Then he fired the fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and ran
            fifty yards away, Fetlock following. They stood waiting a few minutes, then a great
            volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion; after a
            little there was a shower of descending stones; then all was serene again. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e535">"I wish to God you'd been in it!" remarked the master. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e538">They went down the shaft, cleaned it out, drilled another hole, and put in another
            charge. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e540">"Look here! How much fuse are you proposing to waste? Don't you know how to time a
            fuse?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e542">"No, sir." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e544">"You <i>don't!</i> Well, if you don't beat anything <i>I</i> ever saw!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e552">He climbed out of the shaft and spoke down: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e554">"Well, idiot, are you going to be all day? Cut the fuse and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e556">The trembling creature began: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e558">"If you please, sir, I—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e560">"You talk back to <i>me?</i> Cut it and light it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e565">The boy cut and lit. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e567">"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! I wish you were in—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e570">In his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft and ran. The boy was aghast. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e572">"Oh, my God! Help. Help! Oh, save me!" he implored. "Oh, what can I do! What <i>can</i> I do!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e577">He backed against the wall as tightly as he could; the sputtering fuse frightened the
            voice out of him; his breath stood still; he stood gazing and impotent; in two seconds,
            three seconds, four he would be flying toward the sky torn to fragments. Then he had an
            inspiration. He sprang at the fuse; severed the inch of it that was left above ground,
            and was saved. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e579">He sank down limp and half lifeless with fright, his strength gone; but he muttered
            with a deep joy: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e581">"He has learnt me! I knew there was a way, if I would wait." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e583">After a matter of five minutes Buckner stole to the shaft, looking worried and uneasy,
            and peered down into it. He took in the situation; he saw what had happened. He lowered
            the ladder, and the boy dragged himself weakly up it. He was very white. His appearance
            added something to Buckner's uncomfortable state, and he said, with a show of regret and
            sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from lack of practice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e585">"It was an accident, you know. Don't say anything about it to anybody; I was excited,
            and didn't notice what I was doing. You're not looking well; you've worked enough for
            to-day; go down to my cabin and eat what you want, and rest. It's just an accident, you
            know, on account of my being excited." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e587">"It scared me," said the lad, as he started away; "but I learnt something, so I don't
            mind it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e589">"Damned easy to please!" muttered Buckner, following him with his eye. I wonder if
            he'll tell? Mightn't he?... I wish it <i>had</i> killed him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e594">The boy took no advantage of his holiday in the matter of resting; he employed it in
            work, eager and feverish and happy work. A thick growth of chaparral extended down the
            mountainside clear to Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's labor was done in the dark
            intricacies of that stubborn growth; the rest of it was done in his own shanty. At last
            all was complete, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e596">"If he's got any suspicions that I'm going to tell on him, he won't keep them long,
            to-morrow. He will see that I am the same milksop as I always was—all day and the
            next. And the day after to-morrow night there 'll be an end of him; nobody will ever
            guess who finished him up nor how it was done. He dropped me the idea his own self, and
            that's odd."</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e602"> From the Springfield <i>Republican,</i> April 12, 1902.</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e607">To the Editor of the
                  Republican:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e610"><i>One of your citizens has asked me a
                  question about the "esophagus," and I wish to answer him through you. This in the
                  hope that the answer will get around, and save me some penmanship, for I have
                  already replied to the same question more than several times, and am not getting
                  as much holiday as I ought to have.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e614"><i>I
                  published a short story lately, and it was in that that I put the esophagus. I
                  will say privately that I expected it to bother some people—in fact, that
                  was the intention—but the harvest has been larger than I was calculating
                  upon. The esophagus has gathered in the guilty and the innocent alike, whereas I
                  was only fishing for the innocent—the innocent and confiding. I knew a few
                  of these would write and ask me; that would give me but little trouble; but, I was
                  not expecting that the wise and the learned would call upon me for succor.
                  However, that has happened, and it is time for me to speak up and stop the
                  inquiries if I can, for letter-writing is not restful to me, and I am not having
                  so much fun out of this thing as I counted on. That you may understand the
                  situation, I will insert a couple of sample inquiries. The first is from a public
                  instructor in the Philippines: </i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e618">SANTA CRUZ, <i>Ilocos, Sur, P. I. </i><br><i>February 13,
                  1902</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e626"><i>My dear Sir,—I have just been
                  reading the first part of your latest story, entitled "A Double-barreled Detective
                  Story," and am very much delighted with it. In Part IV, page 264,</i> Harper's
                Magazine <i>for January, occurs this passage: "far in the empty sky a
                  solitary 'esophagus' slept upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness,
                  serenity, and the peace of God." Now, there is one word I do not understand,
                  namely, "esophagus." My only work of reference is the</i> Standard Dictionary,
                  <i>but that fails to explain the meaning. If you can spare the
                  time, I would be glad to have the meaning cleared up, as I consider the passage a
                  very touching and beautiful one. It may seem foolish to you, but consider my lack
                  of means away out in the northern part of Luzon.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e636"><i>Yours very truly.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e640"><i>Do you notice?
                  Nothing in the paragraph disturbed him but that one word. It shows that the
                  paragraph was most ably constructed for the deception it was intended to put upon
                  the reader. It was my intention that it should read plausibly, and it is now plain
                  that it does; it was my intention that it should be emotional and touching, and
                  you see, yourself, that it fetched this public instructor. Alas, If I had but left
                  that one treacherous word out, I should have scored! scored everywhere; and the
                  paragraph would have slidden through every reader's sensibilities like oil, and
                  left not a suspicion behind.</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e644"><i>The other sample
                  inquiry is from a professor in a New England university. It contains one naughty
                  word (which I cannot bear to suppress), but he is not in the theological
                  department, so it is no harm:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e648"><i>Dear Mr.

                  much periodical literature, but I have just gone through at this belated period,

                  Story."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e657"><i>But what in hell is an esophagus? I
                  keep one myself, but it never sleeps in the air or anywhere else. My profession is
                  to deal with words, and esophagus interested me the moment I lighted upon it. But
                  as a companion of my youth used to say, "I'll be eternally, co-eternally cussed"
                  if l can make it out. Is it a joke, or I an ignoramus?</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e661"><i>Between you and me, I was almost ashamed of having fooled that man,
                  but for pride's sake I was not going to say so. I wrote and told him it was a

                  him to carefully read the whole paragraph, and he would find not a vestige of
                  sense in any detail of it. This also I commend to my Springfield

                  melodramatic passages in which it is difficult to detect the deception, so ably is
                  it done. But the illusion ought not to endure even the first incident in the
                  February number. As for the paragraph which has so admirably illustrated the skill
                  of Mr. Clemens's ensemble and the carelessness of readers, here it
              is:</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e688"><i>"It was a crisp and spicy morning in early
                  October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung
                  burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind nature for
                  the wingless wild things that have their home in the tree-tops and would visit
                  together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow flames in
                  brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the sensuous
                  fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere; far
                  in the empty sky a solitary esophagus slept upon motionless wings; everywhere
                  brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God."</i></p><p id="TwaDoubd1e692"><i>The success of Mark Twain's joke recalls to mind his story of the
                  petrified man in the cavern, whom he described most punctiliously, first giving a
                  picture of the scene, its impressive solitude, and all that; then going on to
                  describe the majesty of the figure, casually mentioning that the thumb of his
                  right hand rested against the side of his nose; then after further description
                  observing that the fingers of the right hand were extended in a radiating fashion;
                  and, recurring to the dignified attitude and position of the man, incidentally
                  remarked that the thumb of the left hand was in contact with the little finger of
                  the right—and so on. But was it so ingeniously written that Mark, relating
                  the history years later in an article which appeared in that excellent magazine of
                  the past, the</i> Galaxy, <i>declared that no one ever found out
                  the joke, and, if we remember aright, that that astonishing old mockery was
                  actually looked for in the region where he, as a Nevada newspaper editor, had
                  located it. It is certain that Mark Twain's jumping frog has a good many more

            are clacking; there is no other sound—that is, within; the wind is fitfully
            moaning without. The men look bored; also expectant. A hulking broad-shouldered miner,
            of middle age, with grizzled whiskers, and an unfriendly eye set in an unsociable face,
            rises, slips a coil of fuse upon his arm, gathers up some other personal properties, and
            departs without word or greeting to anybody. It is Flint Buckner. As the door closes
            behind him a buzz of talk breaks out. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e706">"The regularest man that ever was," said Jake Parker, the blacksmith: "you can tell
            when it's twelve just by him leaving, without looking at your Waterbury." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e708">"And it's the only virtue he's got, as fur as I know," said Peter Hawes, miner. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e710">"He's just a blight on this society," said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "If I was
            running this shop I'd make him say something, <i>some</i> time or other,
            or vamos the ranch." This with a suggestive glance at the barkeeper, who did not choose
            to see it, since the man under discussion was a good customer, and went home pretty well
            set up, every night, with refreshments furnished from the bar. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e715">"Say," said Ham Sandwich, miner, "does any of you boys ever recollect of him asking you
            to take a drink?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e717"><i>"Him?</i> Flint <i>Buckner?</i> Oh, Laura!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e724">This sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous general outburst in one form of words or
            another from the crowd. After a brief silence, Pat Riley, miner, said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e726">"He's the 15-puzzle, that cuss. And his boy's another one. <i>I
            </i>can't make them out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e731">"Nor anybody else," said Ham Sandwich; "and if they are 15-puzzles how are you going to
            rank up that other one? When it comes to A 1 right-down solid mysteriousness, he lays
            over both of them. <i>Easy—</i>don't he?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e737">"You bet!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e739">Everybody said it. Every man but one. He was the new-comer-Peterson. He ordered the
            drinks all round, and asked who No. 3 might be. All answered at once, "Archy Stillman!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e741">"Is he a mystery?" asked Peterson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e743">"Is <i>he</i> a mystery? Is Archy <i>Stillman a</i>
            mystery?" said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "Why, the fourth dimension's foolishness to
              <i>him."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e754">For Ferguson was learned. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e756">Peterson wanted to hear all about him; everybody wanted to tell him; everybody began.
            But Billy Stevens, the barkeeper, called the house to order, and said one at a time was
            best. He distributed the drinks, and appointed Ferguson to lead. Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e758">"Well, he's a boy. And that is just about all we know about him. You can pump him till
            you are tired; it ain't any use; you won't get anything. At least about his intentions,
            or line of business, or where he's from, and such things as that. And as for getting at
            the nature and get-up of his main big chief mystery, why, he'll just change the subject,
            that's all. You can <i>guess</i> till you're black in the
            face—it's your privilege—but suppose you do, where do you arrive at?
            Nowhere, as near as I can make out," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e763">"What <i>is</i> his big chief one?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e768">"Sight, maybe. Hearing, maybe. Instinct, maybe. Magic, maybe. Take your
            choice—grownups, twenty-five; children and servants, half price. Now I'll tell you
            what he can do. You can start here, and just disappear; you can go and hide wherever you
            want to, I don't care where it is, nor how far—and he'll go straight and put his
            finger on you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e770">"You don't mean it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e772">"I just do, though. Weather's nothing to him—elemental conditions is nothing to
            him—he don't even take notice of them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e775">"Oh, come! Dark? Rain? Snow? Hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e777">"It's all the same to <i>him.</i> He don't give a damn." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e782">"Oh, <i>say—</i>including <i>fog,</i> per'aps?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e790"><i>"Fog!</i> he's got an eye 't can plunk through it like a bullet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e794">"Now, boys, honor bright, what's he giving me?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e796">"It's a fact!" they all shouted. "Go on, Wells-Fargo." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e798">"Well, sir, you can leave him here, chatting with the boys, and you can slip out and go
            to any cabin in this camp and open a book—yes, sir, a dozen of them—and take
            the page in your memory, and he'll start out and go straight to that cabin and open
            every one of them books at the right page, and call it off, and never make a mistake." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e800">"He must be the devil!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e802">"More than one has thought it. Now I'll tell you a perfectly wonderful thing that he
            done. The other night he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e804">There was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside, the door flew open, and an excited
            crowd burst in, with the camp's one white woman in the lead and crying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e806">"My child! my child! she's lost and gone! For the love of God help me to find Archy
            Stillman; we've hunted everywhere!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e809">Said the barkeeper: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e811">"Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, and don't worry. He asked for a bed three hours ago,
            tuckered out tramping the trails the way he's always doing, and went up-stairs. Ham
            Sandwich, run up and roust him out; he's in No. 14." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e813">The youth was soon down-stairs and ready. He asked Mrs. Hogan for particulars. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e815">"Bless you, dear, there ain't any; I wish there was. I put her to sleep at seven in the
            evening, and when I went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself, she was gone. I
            rushed for your cabin, dear, and you wasn't there, and I've hunted for you ever since,
            at every cabin down the gulch, and now I've come up again, and I'm that distracted and
            scared and heartbroke; but, thanks to God, I've found you at last, dear heart, and
            you'll find my child. Come on! come quick!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e817">"Move right along; I'm with you, madam. Go to your cabin first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e819">The whole company streamed out to join the hunt. All the southern half of the village
            was up, a hundred men strong, and waiting outside, a vague dark mass sprinkled with
            twinkling lanterns. The mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself
            to the narrow road, and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders. In a
            few minutes the Hogan cabin was reached. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e821">"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Hogan; "there's where she was; it's where I laid her at
            seven o'clock; but where she is now, God only knows." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e823">"Hand me a lantern," said Archy. He set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it,
            pretending to examine the ground closely. "Here's her track," he said, touching the
            ground here and there and yonder with his finger. "Do you see?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e825">Several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see. One or two
            thought they discerned something like a track; the others shook their heads and
            confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp
            enough to discover. One said, "Maybe a child's foot could make a mark on it, but <i>I</i> don't see how." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e830">Young Stillman stepped outside, held the light to the ground, turned leftward, and
            moved three steps, closely examining; then said, "I've got the direction—come
            along; take the lantern, somebody." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e832">He strode off swiftly southward, the files following, swaying and bending in and out
            with the deep curves of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the mouth of the gorge was reached;
            before them stretched the sagebrush plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman called a halt,
            saying, "We mustn't start wrong, now; we must take the direction again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e835">He took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards; then said,
            "Come on; it's all right," and gave up the lantern. In and out among the sage-bushes he
            marched, a quarter of a mile, bearing gradually to the right; then took a new direction
            and made another great semicircle; then changed again and moved due west nearly half a
            mile—and stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e837">"She gave it up, here, poor little chap. Hold the lantern. You can see where she sat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e839">But this was in a slick alkali flat which was surfaced like steel, and no person in the
            party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a
            cushion on a veneer like that. The bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the
            spot, lamenting. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e841">"But where is she, then?" some one said. "She didn't stay here. We can see <i>that</i> much, anyway." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e846">Stillman moved about in a circle around the place, with the lantern, pretending to hunt
            for tracks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e848">"Well!" he said presently, in an annoyed tone, "I don't understand it." He examined
            again. "No use. She was here—that's certain; she never <i>walked</i> away from here—and that's certain. It's a puzzle; I can't make it
            out." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e853">The mother lost heart then. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e855">"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! some flying beast has got her. I'll never see her
            again!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e857">"Ah, <i>don't</i> give up," said Archy. "We'll find her—don't
            give up." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e862">"God bless you for the words, Archy Stillman!" and she seized his hand and kissed it
            fervently. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e864">Peterson, the new-comer, whispered satirically in Ferguson's ear: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e867">"Wonderful performance to find this place, wasn't it? Hardly worth while to come so
            far, though; any other supposititious place would have answered just as well—hey?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e869">Ferguson was not pleased with the innuendo. He said, with some warmth: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e871">"Do you mean to insinuate that the child hasn't been here? I tell you the child <i>has</i> been here! Now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a
            little fuss as—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e876">"All right!" sang out Stillman. "Come, everybody, and look at this! It was right under
            our noses all the time, and we didn't see it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e878">There was a general plunge for the ground at the place where the child was alleged to
            have rested, and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to see the thing that Archy's finger
            was resting upon. There was a pause, then a several-barreled sigh of disappointment. Pat
            Riley and Ham Sandwich said, in the one breath: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e880">"What is it, Archy? There's nothing here." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e882">"Nothing? Do you call <i>that</i> nothing?" and he swiftly traced upon
            the ground a form with his finger. "There—don't you recognize it now? It's Injun
            Billy's track. He's got the child." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e887">"God be praised !" from the mother. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e889">"Take away the lantern. I've got the direction. Follow!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e891">He started on a run, racing in and out among the sage-bushes a matter of three hundred
            yards, and disappeared over a sand-wave; the others struggled after him, caught him up,
            and found him waiting. Ten steps away was a little wickiup, a dim and formless shelter
            of rags and old horse-blankets, a dull light showing through its chinks. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e893">"You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the lad. "It's your privilege to be first." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e896">All followed the sprint she made for the wickiup, and saw, with her, the picture its
            interior afforded. Injun Billy was sitting on the ground; the child was asleep beside
            him. The mother hugged it with a wild embrace, which included Archy Stillman, the
            grateful tears running down her face, and in a choked and broken voice she poured out a
            golden stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments which has its home in full
            richness nowhere but in the Irish heart. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e898">"I find her bymeby it is ten o'clock," Billy explained. "She 'sleep out yonder, ve'y
            tired—face wet, been cryin', 'spose; fetch her home, feed her, she heap much
            hungry—go 'sleep 'gin." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e900">In her limitless gratitude the happy mother waived rank and hugged him too, calling him
            "the angel of God in disguise." And he probably was in disguise if he was that kind of
            an official. He was dressed for the character. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e902">At half past one in the morning the procession burst into the village singing, "When
            Johnny Comes Marching Home," waving its lanterns and swallowing the drinks that were
            brought out all along its course. It concentrated at the tavern, and made a night of
            what was left of the morning.</p>Chapter VI<p id="TwaDoubd1e907">The next afternoon the village was electrified with an immense sensation. A grave and
            dignified foreigner of distinguished bearing and appearance had arrived at the tavern,
            and entered this formidable name upon the register: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e909">SHERLOCK HOLMES
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e913">The news buzzed from cabin to cabin, from claim to claim; tools were dropped, and the
            town swarmed toward the center of interest. A man passing out at the northern end of the
            village shouted it to Pat Riley, whose claim was the next one to Flint Buckner's. At
            that time Fetlock Jones seemed to turn sick. He muttered to himself: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e915">"Uncle <i>Sherlock!</i> The mean luck of it!—that <i>he </i>should come just when..." He dropped into a reverie, and
            presently said to himself: "But what's the use of being afraid of <i>him?
            </i>Anybody that knows him the way I do knows he can't detect a crime except where he
            plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and hires some fellow to commit it
            according to instructions.... Now there ain't going to <i>be</i> any
            clues this time—so, what show has he got? None at all. No, sir; everything's
            ready. If I was to risk putting it off—...No, I won't run any risk like that.
            Flint Buckner goes out of this world to-night, for sure." Then another trouble presented
            itself. "Uncle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening, and
            how am I going to get rid of him? for I've <i>got</i> to be at my cabin
            a minute or two about eight o'clock." This was an awkward matter, and cost him much
            thought. But he found a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll go for a walk, and I'll leave
            him in the road a minute, so that he won't see what it is I do: the best way to throw a
            detective off the track, anyway, is to have him along when you are preparing the thing.
            Yes, that's the safest—I'll take him with me." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e932">Meantime the road in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping
            for a glimpse of the great man. But he kept his room, and did not appear. None but
            Ferguson, Jake Parker the blacksmith, and Ham Sandwich had any luck. These enthusiastic
            admirers of the great scientific detective hired the tavern's detained-baggage lockup,
            which looked into the detective's room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide,
            ambushed themselves in it, and cut some peep-holes in the window-blind. Mr. Holmes's
            blinds were down; but by and by he raised them. It gave the spies a hair-lifting but
            pleasurable thrill to find themselves face to face with the Extraordinary Man who had
            filled the world with the fame of his more than human ingenuities. There he
            sat—not a myth, not a shadow, but real, alive, compact of substance, and almost
            within touching distance with the hand. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e934">"Look at that head!" said Ferguson, in an awed voice. "By gracious! <i>that's</i> a head!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e939">"You bet!" said the blacksmith, with deep reverence. "Look at his nose! look at his
            eyes! Intellect? Just a battery of it!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e941">"And that paleness," said Ham Sandwich. "Comes from thought—that's what it comes
            from. Hell! duffers like us don't know what real thought <i>is."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e946">"No more we don't," said Ferguson. "What we take for thinking is just
            blubber-and-slush," </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e948">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo. And look at that frown—that's <i>deep</i> thinking—away down, down, forty fathom into the bowels of things.
            He's on the track of something." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e954">"Well, he is, and don't you forget it. Say—look at that awful gravity—look
            at that pallid solemness—there ain't any corpse can lay over it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e956">"No, sir, not for dollars! And it's his'n by hereditary rights, too; he's been dead
            four times a'ready, and there's history for it. Three times natural, once by accident.
            I've heard say he smells damp and cold, like a grave. And he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e958">" 'Sh! Watch him! There—he's got his thumb on the bump on the near corner of his
            forehead, and his forefinger on the off one. His think-works is just a-<i>grinding</i> now, you bet your other shirt." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e963">"That's so. And now he's gazing up toward heaven and stroking his mustache slow,
            and—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e965">"Now he has rose up standing, and is putting his clues together on his left fingers
            with his right finger. See? he touches the forefinger—now middle finger—now
            ring-finger—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e967">"Stuck!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e969">"Look at him scowl! He can't seem to make out <i>that</i> clue. So
            he—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e974">"See him smile!—like a tiger—and tally off the other fingers like nothing!
            He's got it, boys; he's got it sure!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e976">"Well, I should <i>say!</i> I'd hate to be in that man's place that
            he's after." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e981">Mr. Holmes drew a table to the window, sat down with his back to the spies, and
            proceeded to write. The spies withdrew their eyes from the peep-holes, lit their pipes,
            and settled themselves for a comfortable smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with conviction: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e983">"Boys, it's no use talking, he's a wonder! He's got the signs of it all over him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e986">"You hain't ever said a truer word than that, Wells-Fargo," said Jake Parker. "Say,
            wouldn't it 'a' been nuts if he'd a-been here last night?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e988">"Oh, by George, but wouldn't it!" said Ferguson. "Then we'd have seen <i>scientific</i> work. Intellect—just pure intellect—away up on the upper
            levels, dontchuknow. Archy is all right, and it don't become anybody to belittle <i>him,</i> I can tell you. But his gift is only just eyesight, sharp as
            an owl's, as near as I can make it out just a grand natural animal talent, no more, no
            less, and prime as far as it goes, but no intellect in it, and for awfulness and
            marvelousness no more to be compared to what this man does than—than—Why,
            let me tell you what <i>he'd</i> have done. He'd have stepped over to
            Hogan's and glanced—just <i>glanced,</i> that's all—at the
            premises, and that's enough. See everything? Yes, sir, to the last little detail; and
            he'll know more about that place than the Hogans would know in seven years. Next, he
            would sit down on the bunk, just as ca'm, and say to Mrs. Hogan—<i>Say,</i> Ham, consider that you are Mrs. Hogan. I'll ask the questions; you answer
            them." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1005">"All right; go on." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1007">" 'Madam, if you please—attention—do not let your mind wander. Now,
            then—sex of the child?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1009">" 'Female, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1011">" 'Um—female. Very good, very good. Age?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1013">" 'Turned six, your Honor.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1015">" 'Um—young, weak—two miles. Weariness will overtake it then. It will sink
            down and sleep. We shall find it two miles away, or less.

You see, boys, <i>he</i> knows a clue when he sees it, when it wouldn't mean a dern thing
            to anybody else. 'Stockings, madam? Shoes?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1027">" 'Yes, your Honor—both.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1030">" 'Yarn, perhaps? Morocco?' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1032">" 'Yarn, your Honor. And kip.' </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1034">" 'Um—kip. This complicates the matter. However, let it go—we shall manage.

            Thanks. Cotton. Shows wear. An excellent clue, excellent. Pass me a pallet of the floor
            dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, many thanks. Ah, admirable, admirable! <i>Now</i> we know where we are, I think.' You see, boys, he's got all the
            clues he wants now; he don't need anything more. Now, then, what does this Extraordinary
            Man do? He lays those snips and that dirt out on the table and leans over them on his
            elbows, and puts them together side by side and studies them—mumbles to himself,
            'Female'; changes them around—mumbles, 'Six years old'; changes them this way and
            that—again mumbles: 'Five teeth—one
            a-coming—Catholic—yarn—cotton—kip—damn that kip.' Then he
            straightens up and gazes toward heaven, and plows his hands through his hair—plows
            and plows, muttering, 'Damn that kip!' Then he stands up and frowns, and begins to tally
            off his clues on his fingers—and gets stuck at the ring-finger. But only just a
            minute—then his face glares all up in a smile like a house afire, and he
            straightens up stately and majestic, and says to the crowd, 'Take a lantern, a couple of
            you, and go down to Injun Billy's and fetch the child—the rest of you go 'long
            home to bed; good-night, madam; good-night, gents.' And he bows like the Matterhorn, and
            pulls out for the tavern. That's <i>his</i> style, and the <i>Only—</i>scientific, intellectual—all over in fifteen
            minutes—no poking around all over the sage-brush range an hour and a half in a
            mass-meeting crowd for <i>him,</i> boys—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1055">"By Jackson, it's grand!" said Ham Sandwich. "Wells-Fargo, you've got him down to a
            dot. He ain't painted up any exacter to the life in the books. By George, I can juse <i>see</i> him—can't you, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1060">"You bet you! It's just a photograft, that's what it is." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1062">Ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success, and grateful. He sat silently
            enjoying his happiness a little while, then he murmured, with a deep awe in his voice, </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1064">"I wonder if God made him?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1066">There was no response for a moment; then Ham Sandwich said, reverently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1068">"Not all at one time, I reckon."</p>Chapter VII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1073">At eight o'clock that evening two persons were groping their way past Flint Buckner's
            cabin in the frosty gloom. They were Sherlock Holmes and his nephew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1075">"Stop here in the road a moment, uncle," said Fetlock, "while I run to my cabin; I
            won't be gone a minute." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1077">He asked for something—the uncle furnished it—then he disappeared in the
            darkness, but soon returned, and the talking-walk was resumed. By nine o'clock they had
            wandered back to the tavern. They worked their way through the billiard-room, where a
            crowd had gathered in the hope of getting a glimpse of the Extraordinary Man. A royal
            cheer was raised. Mr. Holmes acknowledged the compliment with a series of courtly bows,
            and as he was passing out his nephew said to the assemblage: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1079">"Uncle Sherlock's got some work to do, gentlemen, that 'll keep him till twelve or one;
            but he'll be down again then, or earlier if he can, and hopes some of you'll be left to
            take a drink with him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1081">"By George, he's just a duke, boys! Three cheers for Sherlock Holmes, the greatest man
            that ever lived!" shouted Ferguson. "Hip, hip, hip—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1083">"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Tiger!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1085">The uproar shook the building, so hearty was the feeling the boys put into their
            welcome. Up-stairs the uncle reproached the nephew gently, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1087">"What did you get me into that engagement for?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1089">"I reckon you don't want to be unpopular, do you, uncle? Well, then, don't you put on
            any exclusiveness in a mining-camp, that's all. The boys admire you; but if you was to
            leave without taking a drink with them, they'd set you down for a snob. And besides, you
            said you had home talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1091">The boy was right, and wise—the uncle acknowledged it. The boy was wise in
            another detail which he did not mention—except to himself: "Uncle and the others
            will come handy—in the way of nailing an <i>alibi </i>where it
            can't be budged." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1097">He and his uncle talked diligently about three hours. Then, about midnight, Fetlock
            stepped down-stairs and took a position in the dark a dozen steps from the tavern, and
            waited. Five minutes later Flint Buckner came rocking out of the billiard-room and
            almost brushed him as he passed. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1099">"I've <i>got</i> him!" muttered the boy. He continued to himself,
            looking after the shadowy form: "Good-by—good-by for good, Flint Buckner; you
            called my mother a—well, never mind what: it's all right, now; you're taking your
            last walk, friend." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1104">He went musing back into the tavern. "From now till one is an hour. We'll spend it with
            the boys; it's good for the <i>alibi."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1109">He brought Sherlock Holmes to the billiard-room, which was jammed with eager and
            admiring miners; the guest called the drinks, and the fun began. Everybody was happy;
            everybody was complimentary; the ice was soon broken, songs, anecdotes, and more drinks
            followed, and the pregnant minutes flew. At six minutes to one, when the jollity was at
            its highest— </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1111"><i>Boom!</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1115">There was silence instantly. The deep sound came rolling and rumbling frown peak to
            peak up the gorge, then died down, and ceased. The spell broke, then, and the men made a
            rush for the door, saying: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1117">"Something's blown up!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1119">Outside, a voice in the darkness said, "It's away down the gorge; I saw the flash." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1121">The crowd poured down the cañon—Holmes, Fetlock, Archy Stillman,
            everybody. They made the mile in a few minutes. By the light of a lantern they found the
            smooth and solid dirt floor of Flint Buckner's cabin; of the cabin itself not a vestige
            remained, not a rag nor a splinter. Nor any sign of Flint. Search-parties sought here
            and there and yonder, and presently a cry went up. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1123">"Here he is!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1125">It was true. Fifty yards down the gulch they had found him—that is, they had
            found a crushed and lifeless mass which represented him. Fetlock Jones hurried thither
            with the others and looked. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1128">The inquest was a fifteen-minute affair. Ham Sandwich, foreman of the jury, handed up
            the verdict, which was phrased with a certain unstudied literary grace, and closed with
            this finding, to wit: that "deceased came to his death by his own act or some other
            person or persons unknown to this jury not leaving any family or similar effects behind
            but his cabin which was blown away and God have mercy on his soul amen." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1130">Then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd, for the storm-center of interest was
            there—Sherlock Holmes. The miners stood silent and reverent in a half-circle,
            inclosing a large vacant space which included the front exposure of the site of the late
            premises. In this considerable space the Extraordinary Man was moving about, attended by
            his nephew with a lantern. With a tape he took measurements of the cabin site; of the
            distance from the wall of chaparral to the road; of the height of the chaparral bushes;
            also various other measurements. He gathered a rag here, a splinter there, and a pinch
            of earth yonder, inspected them profoundly, and preserved them. He took the "lay" of the
            place with a pocket-compass, allowing two seconds for magnetic variation. He took the
            time (Pacific) by his watch, correcting it for local time. He paced off the distance
            from the cabin site to the corpse, and corrected that for tidal differentiation. He took
            the altitude with a pocket-aneroid, and the temperature with a pocket-thermometer.
            Finally he said, with a stately bow: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1132">"It is finished. Shall we return, gentlemen?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1134">He took up the line of march for the tavern, and the crowd fell into his wake,
            earnestly discussing and admiring the Extraordinary Man, and interlarding guesses as to
            the origin of the tragedy and who the author of it might he. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1136">"My, but it's grand luck having him here—hey, boys?" said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1138">"It's the biggest thing of the century," said Ham Sandwich. "It 'll go all over the
            world; you mark my words." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1140"><i>"You</i> bet!" said Jake Parker, the blacksmith. "It 'll boom this
            camp. Ain't it so, Wells-Fargo?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1144">"Well, as you want my opinion—if it's any sign of how <i>I
            </i>think about it, I can tell you this: yesterday I was holding the Straight Flush
            claim at two dollars a foot; I'd like to see the man that can get it at sixteen to-day." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1149">"Right you are, Wells-Fargo! It's the grandest luck a new camp ever struck. Say, did
            you see him collar them little rags and dirt and things? What an eye! He just can't
            overlook a clue—'tain't <i>in </i>him." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1154">"That's so. And they wouldn't mean a thing to anybody else; but to him, why, they're
            just a book—large print at that." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1156">"Sure's you're born! Them odds and ends have got their little old secret, and they
            think there ain't anybody can pull it; but, land! when he sets his grip there they've
            got to squeal, and don't you forget it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1159">"Boys, I ain't sorry, now, that he wasn't here to roust out the child; this is a bigger
            thing, by a long sight. Yes, sir, and more tangled up and scientific and intellectual." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1161">"I reckon we're all of us glad it's turned out this way. Glad? 'George! it ain't any
            name for it. Dontchuknow, Archy could 've <i>learnt</i> something if
            he'd had the nous to stand by and take notice of how that man works the system. But no;
            he went poking up into the chaparral and just missed the whole thing." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1166">"It's true as gospel; I seen it myself. Well, Archy's young. He'll know better one of
            these days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1168">"Say, boys, who do you reckon done it?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1170">That was a difficult question, and brought out a world of unsatisfying conjecture.
            Various men were mentioned as possibilities, but one by one they were discarded as not
            being eligible. No one but young Hillyer had been intimate with Flint Buckner; no one
            had really had a quarrel with him; he had affronted every man who had tried to make up
            to him, although not quite offensively enough to require bloodshed. There was one name
            that was upon every tongue from the start, but it <i>was</i> the last to
            get utterance—Fetlock Jones's. It was Pat Riley that mentioned it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1175">"Oh, well," the boys said, "of course we've all thought of him, because he had a
            million rights to kill Flint Buckner, and it was just his plain duty to do it. But all
            the same there's two things we can't get around: for one thing, he hasn't got the sand;
            and for another, he wasn't anywhere near the place when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1177">"I know it," said Pat. "He was there in the billiard-room with us when it happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1179">"Yes, and was there all the time for an hour <i>before</i> it
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1184">"It's so. And lucky for him, too. He'd have been suspected in a minute if it hadn't
            been for that."</p>Chapter VIII<p id="TwaDoubd1e1189">The tavern dining-room had been cleared of all its furniture save one six-foot pine
            table and a chair. This table was against one end of the room; the chair was on it;
            Sherlock Holmes, stately, imposing, impressive, sat in the chair. The public stood. The
            room was full. The tobacco-smoke was dense, the stillness profound. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1191">The Extraordinary Man raised his hand to command additional silence; held it in the air
            a few moments; then, in brief, crisp terms he put forward question after question, and
            noted the answers with "Um-ums," nods of the head, and so on. By this process he learned
            all about Flint Buckner, his character, conduct, and habits, that the people were able
            to tell him. It thus transpired that the Extraordinary Man's nephew was the only person
            in the camp who had a killing-grudge against Flint Buckner. Mr. Holmes smiled
            compassionately upon the witness, and asked, languidly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1193">"Do any of you gentlemen chance to know where the lad Fetlock Jones was at the time of
            the explosion?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1195">A thunderous response followed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1197">"In the billiard-room of this house!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1199">"Ah. And had he just come in?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1201">"Been there all of an hour!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1203">"Ah. It is about—about—well, about how far might it be to the scene of the
            explosions" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1205">"All of a mile!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1207">"Ah. It isn't <i>much</i> of an alibi, 'tis true, but—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1213">A storm-burst of laughter, mingled with shouts of "By jiminy, but he's
            chain-lightning!" and "Ain't you sorry you spoke, Sandy?" shut off the rest of the
            sentence, and the crushed witness drooped his blushing face in pathetic shame. The
            inquisitor resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1215">"The lad Jones's somewhat <i>distant</i> connection with the case"
              (laughter<i>) "</i>having been disposed of, let us now call the
            eye-witnesses of the tragedy, and listen to what they have to say." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1223">He got out his fragmentary clues and arranged them on a sheet of cardboard on his knee.
            The house held its breath and watched. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1225">"We have the longitude and the latitude, corrected for magnetic variation, and this
            gives us the exact location of the tragedy. We have the altitude, the temperature, and
            the degree of humidity prevailing—inestimably valuable, since they enable us to
            estimate with precision the degree of influence which they would exercise upon the mood
            and disposition of the assassin at that time of the night." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1227"><i>(Buzz of admiration; muttered remark, "By George, but he's
              deep.")</i> He fingered his clues. "And now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak
            to us. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1231">"Here we have an empty linen shot-bag. What is its message? This: that robbery was the
            motive, not revenge. What is its further message? This: that the assassin was of
            inferior intelligence—shall we say light-witted, or perhaps approaching that? How
            do we know this? Because a person of sound intelligence would not have proposed to rob
            the man Buckner, who never had much money with him. But the assassin might have been a
            stranger? Let the bag speak again. I take from it this article. It is a bit of
            silver-bearing quartz. It is peculiar. Examine it, please—you—and
            you—and you. Now pass it back, please. There is but one lode on this coast which
            produces just that character and color of quartz; and that is a lode which crops out for
            nearly two miles on a stretch, and in my opinion is destined, at no distant day, to
            confer upon its locality a globe-girdling celebrity, and upon its two hundred owners
            riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Name that lode, please." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1233">"The Consolidated Christian Science and Mary Ann!" was the prompt response. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1235">A wild crash of hurrahs followed, and every man reached for his neighbor's hand and
            wrung it, with tears in his eyes; and Wells-Fargo Ferguson shouted, "The Straight Flush
            is on the lode, and up she goes to a hunched and fifty a foot—you hear <i>me!"</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1240">When quiet fell, Mr. Holmes resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1242">"We perceive, then, that three facts are established, to wit: the assassin was
            approximately light-witted; he was not a stranger; his motive was robbery, not revenge.
            Let us proceed. I hold in my hand a small fragment of fuse, with the recent smell of
            fire upon it. What is its testimony? Taken with the corroborative evidence of the
            quartz, it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner. What does it tell us further?
            This, gentlemen: that the assassination was consummated by means of an explosive. What
            else does it say? This: that the explosive was located against the side of the cabin
            nearest the road—the front side—for within six feet of that spot I found it. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1244">"I hold in my fingers a burnt Swedish match—the kind one rubs on a safety-box. I
            found it in the road, six hundred and twenty-two feet from the abolished cabin. What
            does it say? This: that the train was fired from that point. What further does it tell
            us? This: that the assassin was left-handed. How do I know this? I should not be able to
            explain to you, gentlemen, how I know it, the signs being so subtle that only long
            experience and deep study can enable one to detect them. But the signs are here, and
            they are reinforced by a fact which you must have often noticed in the great detective
            narratives—that <i>all </i>assassins are left-handed." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1250">"By Jackson, <i>that's</i> so." said Ham Sandwich, bringing his great
            hand down with a resounding slap upon his thigh; "blamed if I ever thought of it
            before." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1255">"Nor I!" "Nor I!" cried several. "Oh, there can't anything escape <i>him—</i>look at his eye!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1260">"Gentlemen, distant as the murderer was from his doomed victim, he did not wholly
            escape injury. This fragment of wood which I now exhibit to you struck him. It drew
            blood. Wherever he is, he bears the telltale mark. I picked it up where he stood when he
            fired the fatal train," He looked out over the house from his high perch, and his
            countenance began to darken; he slowly raised his hand, and pointed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1262">"There stands the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1264">For a moment the house was paralyzed with amazement; then twenty voices burst out with: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1266">"Sammy Hillyer? Oh, <i>hell,</i> no! <i>Him?</i> It's
            pure foolishness!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1274">"Take care, gentlemen—be not hasty. Observe—he has the blood-mark on his
            brow." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1276">Hillyer turned white with fright. He was near to crying. He turned this way and that,
            appealing to every face for help and sympathy; and held out his supplicating hands
            toward Holmes and began to plead: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1278"><i>"Don't,</i> oh, don't! I never did it; I give my word I never did
            it. The way I got this hurt on my forehead was—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1282">"Arrest him, constable!" cried Holmes. "I will swear out the warrant" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1284">The constable moved reluctantly forward—hesitated—stopped. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1287">Hillyer broke out with another appeal. "Oh, Archy, don't let them do it; it would kill
            mother! <i>You</i> know how I got the hurt. Tell them, and save me,
            Archy; save me!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1292">Stillman worked his way to the front, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1294">"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be afraid." Then he said to the house, "Never mind how he
            got the hurt; it hasn't anything to do with this case, and isn't of any consequence." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1296">"God bless you, Archy, for a true friend!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1298">"Hurrah for Archy! Go in, boy, and play 'em a knock-down flush to their two pair 'n' a
            jack!" shouted the house, pride in their home talent and a patriotic sentiment of
            loyalty to it rising suddenly in the public heart and changing the whole attitude of the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1300">Young Stillman waited for the noise to cease; then he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1302">"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand by that door yonder, and Constable Harris to stand by
            the other one here, and not let anybody leave the room. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1304">"Said and done. Go on, old man!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1306">"The criminal is present, I believe. I will show him to you before long, in case I am
            right in my guess. Now I will tell you all about the tragedy, from start to finish. The
            motive <i>wasn't </i>robbery; it was revenge. The murderer <i>wasn't</i> light-witted. He <i>didn't</i> stand six
            hundred and twenty-two feet away. He <i>didn't </i>get hit with a piece
            of wood. He <i>didn't</i> place the explosive against the cabin. He <i>didn't</i> bring a shot-bag with him, and he <i>wasn't</i> left-handed. With the exception of these errors, the distinguished
            guest's statement of the case is substantially correct." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1330">A comfortable laugh rippled over the house; friend nodded to friend, as much as to say,
            "That's the word, with the bark <i>on</i> it. Good lad, good boy. <i>He</i> ain't lowering his flag any!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1338">The guest's serenity was not disturbed. Stillman resumed: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1341">"I also have some witnesses; and I will presently tell you where you can find some
            more." He held up a piece of coarse wire; the crowd craned their necks to see. "It has a
            smooth coating of melted tallow on it. And here is a candle which is burned half-way
            down. The remaining half of it has marks cut upon it an inch apart. Soon I will tell you
            where I found these things. I will now put aside reasonings, guesses, the impressive
            hitchings of odds and ends of clues together, and the other showy theatricals of the
            detective trade, and tell you in a plain, straightforward way just how this dismal thing
            happened." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1343">He paused a moment, for effect—to allow silence and suspense to intensify and
            concentrate the house's interest; then he went on: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1345">"The assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains. It was a good plan, very
            ingenious, and showed an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. It was a plan which was
            well calculated to ward off all suspicion from its inventor. In the <i>first</i> place, he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart, and lit it and timed
            it. He found it took three hours to burn four inches of it. I tried it myself for half
            an hour, awhile ago, up-stairs here, while the inquiry into Flint Buckner's character
            and ways was being conducted in this room, and I arrived in that way at the rate of a
            candle's consumption when sheltered from the wind. Having proved his trial candle's
            rate, he blew it out—I have already shown it to you—and put <i>his</i> inch-marks on a fresh one. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1353">"He put the fresh one into a tin candlestick. Then at the five-hour mark he bored a
            hole through the candle with a red-hot wire. I have already shown you the wire, with a
            smooth coat of tallow on it—tallow that had been melted and had cooled. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1355">"With labor—very hard labor, I should say—he struggled up through the stiff
            chaparral that clothes the steep hillside back of Flint Buckner's place, tugging an
            empty flour-barrel with him. He placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place, and in
            the bottom of it he set the candlestick. Then he measured off about thirty-five feet of
            fuse—the barrel's distance from the back of the cabin. He bored a hole in the side
            of the barrel—here is the large gimlet he did it with. He went on and finished his
            work; and when it was done, one end of the fuse was in Buckner's cabin, and the other
            end, with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder, was in the hole in the
            candle—timed to blow the place up at one o'clock this morning, provided the candle
            was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening—which I am betting it was—and
            provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the
            fuse—which I am also betting there was, though I can't prove it. Boys, the barrel
            is there in the chaparral, the candle's remains are in it in the tin stick; the
            burnt-out fuse is in the gimlet-hole, the other end is down the hill where the late
            cabin stood. I saw them all an hour or two ago, when the Professor here was measuring
            off unimplicated vacancies and collecting relics that hadn't anything to do with the
            case." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1357">He paused. The house drew a long, deep breath, shook its strained cords and muscles
            free and burst into cheers. "Dang him!" said Ham Sandwich, "that's why he was snooping
            around in the chaparral, instead of picking up points out of the P'fessor's game. Looky
            here—he ain't no fool, boys." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1359">"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1361">But Stillman was resuming: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1363">"While we were out yonder an hour or two ago, the owner of the gimlet and the trial
            candle took them from a place where he had concealed them—it was not a good
            place—and carried them to what he probably thought was a better one, two hundred
            yards up in the pine woods, and hid them there, covering them over with pine needles. It
            was there that I found them. The gimlet exactly fits the hole in the barrel. And
            now—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1365">The Extraordinary Man interrupted him. He said, sarcastically: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1367">"We have had a very pretty fairy tale, gentlemen—very pretty indeed. Now I would
            like to ask this young man a question or two." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1370">Some of the boys winced, and Ferguson said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1372">"I'm afraid Archy's going to catch it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1374">The others lost their smiles and sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1376">"Let us proceed to examine into this fairy tale in a consecutive and orderly
            way—by geometrical progression, so to speak—linking detail to detail in a
            steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent and unassailable march upon this tinsel
            toy fortress of error, the dream fabric of a callow imagination. To begin with, young
            sir, I desire to ask you but three questions at present—<i>at
              present.</i> Did I understand you to say it was your opinion that the supposititious
            candle was lighted at about eight o'clock yesterday evening?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1381">"Yes, sir—about eight." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1383">"Could you say exactly eight?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1385">"Well, no, I couldn't be that exact." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1387">"Um. If a person had been passing along there just about that time, he would have been
            almost sure to encounter that assassin, do you think?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1389">"Yes, I should think so." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1391">"Thank you, that is all. For the present. I say, all <i>for the
              present."</i>
          </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1396">"Dern him. he's laying for Archy," said Ferguson. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1399">"It's so," said Ham Sandwich. "I don't like the look of it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1401">Stillman said, glancing at the guest, "I was along there myself at half-past
            eight—no, about nine." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1403">"In-deed? This is interesting—this is very interesting. Perhaps you encountered
            the assassin?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1405">"No, I encountered no one." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1407">"Ah. Then—if you will excuse the remark—I do not quite see the relevancy of
            the information." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1409">"It has none. At present. I say it has none—at present." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1411">He paused. Presently he resumed: "I did not encounter the assassin, but I am on his
            track, I am sure, for I believe he is in this room. I will ask you all to pass one by
            one in front of me—here, where there is a good light—so that I can see your
            feet." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1413">A buzz of excitement swept the place, and the march began, the guest looking on with an
            iron attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified success. Stillman stooped, shaded
            his eyes with his hand, and gazed down intently at each pair of feet as it passed. Fifty
            men tramped monotonously by—with no result. Sixty. Seventy. The thing was
            beginning to look absurd. The guest remarked, with suave irony:</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1415">"Stillman Accuses Sherlock Holmes"Image of Stillman pointing a finger at Sherlock Holmes</p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1421">"Assassins appear to be scarce this evening." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1423">The house saw the humor if it, and refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. Ten or twelve
            more candidates tramped by—no, <i>danced </i>by, with airy and
            ridiculous capers which convulsed the spectators—then suddenly Stillman put out
            his hand and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1429">"This is the assassin!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1431">"Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhedrim!" roared the crowd; and at once let fly a
            pyrotechnic explosion and dazzle and confusion of stirring remarks inspired by the
            situation. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1433">At the height of the turmoil the guest stretched out his hand, commanding peace. The
            authority of a great name and a great personality laid its mysterious compulsion upon
            the house, and it obeyed. Out of the panting calm which succeeded, the guest spoke,
            saying, with dignity and feeling: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1435"><i>"This</i> is serious. It strikes at an innocent life. Innocent
            beyond suspicion! Innocent beyond peradventure! Hear me <i>prove</i> it;
            observe how simple a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie. Listen. My
            friends, that lad was never out of my sight yesterday evening at <i>any</i> time!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1445">It made a deep impression. Men turned their eyes upon Stillman with grave inquiry in
            them. His face brightened, and he said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1447">"I <i>knew</i> there was another one!" He stepped briskly to the table
            and glanced at the guest's feet, then up at his face, and said: "You were <i>with</i> him! You were not fifty steps from him when he lit the candle
            that by and by fired the powder!" <i>(Sensation.) "</i>And what is more,
            you furnished the matches yourself !" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1458">Plainly the guest seemed hit; it looked so to the public. He opened his mouth to speak;
            the words did not come freely. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1460">"This—er—this is insanity—this—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1462">Stillman pressed his evident advantage home. He held up a charred match. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1464">"Here <i>is</i> one of them. I found it in the barrel—and there's
              <i>another</i> one there." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1472">The guest found his voice at once. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1475"><i>"Yes—</i>and put them there yourself!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1479">It was recognized a good shot. Stillman retorted. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1481">"It is <i>wax—</i>a breed unknown to this camp. I am ready to be
            searched for the box. Are you?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1486">The guest was staggered this time—the dullest eye could see it. He fumbled with
            his hands; once or twice his lips moved, but the words did not come. The house waited
            and watched, in tense suspense, the stillness adding effect to the situation. Presently
            Stillman said, gently: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1488">"We are waiting for your decision." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1490">There was silence again during several moments; then the guest answered, in a low
            voice: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1492">"I refuse to be searched." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1494">There was no noisy demonstration, but all about the house one voice after another
            muttered: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1496">"That settles it! He's Archy's meat." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1498">What to do now? Nobody seemed to know. It was an embarrassing situation for the
            moment—merely, of course, because matters had taken such a sudden and unexpected
            turn that these unpractised minds were not prepared for it, and had come to a
            standstill, like a stopped clock, under the shock. But after a little the machinery
            began to work again, tentatively, and by twos and threes the men put their heads
            together and privately buzzed over this and that and the other proposition. One of these
            propositions met with much favor; it was, to confer upon the assassin a vote of thanks
            for removing Flint Buckner, and let him go. But the cooler heads opposed it, pointing
            out that addled brains in the Eastern states would pronounce it a scandal, and make no
            end of foolish noise about it. Finally the cool heads got the upper hand, and obtained
            general consent to a proposition of their own; their leader then called the house to
            order and stated it—to this effect: that Fetlock Jones be jailed and put upon
            trial. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1500">The motion was carried. Apparently there was nothing further to do now, and the people
            were glad, for, privately, they were impatient to get out and rush to the scene of the
            tragedy, and see whether that barrel and the other things were really there or not. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1503">But no—the break-up got a check. The surprises were not over yet. For a while
            Fetlock Jones had been silently sobbing, unnoticed in the absorbing excitements which
            had been following one another so persistently for some time; but when his arrest and
            trial were decreed, he broke out despairingly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1505">"No! it's no use. I don't want any jail, I don't want any trial; I've had all the hard
            luck I want, and all the miseries. Hang me now, and let me out! It would all come out,
            anyway—there couldn't anything save me. He has told it all, just as if he'd been
            with me and seen it—<i>I</i> don't know how he found out; and
            you'll find the barrel and things, and then I wouldn't have any chance any more. I
            killed him; and <i>you'd</i> have done it too, if he'd treated you like
            a dog, and you only a boy, and weak and poor, and not a friend to help you." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1513">"And served him damned well right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. "Looky here, boys—" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1515">From the constable: "Order! Order, gentlemen!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1517">A voice: "Did your uncle know what you was up to?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1519">"No, he didn't." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1521">"Did he give you the matches, sure enough?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1523">"Yes, he did; but he didn't know what I wanted them for." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1525">"When you was out on such a business as that, how did you venture to risk having him
            along—and him a <i>detective?</i> How's that?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1530">The boy hesitated, fumbled with his buttons in an embarrassed way, then said, shyly: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1532">"I know about detectives, on account of having them in the family; and if you don't
            want them to find out about a thing, it's best to have them around when you do it." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1535">The cyclone of laughter which greeted this native discharge of wisdom did not modify
            the poor little waif's embarrassment in any large degree.</p>Chapter IX<p id="TwaDoubd1e1540">From a letter to Mrs. Stillman, dated merely "Tuesday." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1542">Fetlock Jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log cabin, and left there
              to await his trial. Constable Harris provided him with a couple of days' rations,
              instructed him to keep a good guard over himself, and promised to look in on him as
              soon as further supplies should be due. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1545">Next morning a score of us went with Hillyer, out of friendship, and helped him bury
              his late relative, the unlamented Buckner, and I acted as first assistant pall-bearer,
              Hillyer acting as chief. Just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy
              stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, limped by with his head down, and I caught the
              scent I had chased around the globe! It was the odor of Paradise to my perishing hope!
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1548">In a moment I was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder. He
              slumped to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had withered him in his tracks; and
              as the boys came running he struggled to his knees and put up his pleading hands to
              me, and out of his chattering jaws he begged me to persecute him no more, and said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1551">"You have hunted me around the world, Sherlock Holmes, yet God is my witness I have
              never done any man harm!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1554">A glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane. That was my work, mother!
              The tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery I felt in that moment, but
              nothing else can ever do it. The boys lifted him up, and gathered about him, and were
              full of pity of him, and said the gentlest and touchingest things to him, and said
              cheer up and don't be troubled, he was among friends now, and they would take care of
              him, and protect him, and hang any man that laid a hand on him. They are just like so
              many mothers, the rough mining-camp boys are, when you wake up the south side of their
              hearts; yes, and just like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up
              the opposite of that muscle. They did everything they could think of to comfort him,
              but nothing succeeded until Wells-Fargo Ferguson, who is a clever strategist, said:
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1557">"If it's only Sherlock Holmes that's troubling you, you needn't worry any more."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1560">"Why?" asked the forlorn lunatic, eagerly. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1563">"Because he's dead again." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1566">"Dead! Dead! Oh, don't trifle with a poor wreck like me. <i>Is
              </i>he dead? On honor, now—is he telling me true, boys?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1573">"True as you're standing there!" said Ham Sandwich, and they all backed up the
              statement in a body. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1576">"They hung him in San Bernardino last week," added Ferguson, clinching the matter,
              "whilst he was searching around after you. Mistook him for another man. They're sorry,
              but they can't help it now." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1579">"They're a-building him a monument," said Ham Sandwich, with the air of a person who
              had contributed to it, and knew. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1582">"James Walker" drew a deep sigh—evidently a sigh of relief—and said
              nothing; but his eyes lost something of their wildness, his countenance cleared
              visibly, and its drawn look relaxed a little. We all went to our cabin, and the boys
              cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for, and while they
              were about it Hillyer and I outfitted him from hat to shoe-leather with new clothes of
              ours, and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him. "Old" is the right word,
              and a pity, too: old by the droop of him, and the frost upon his hair, and the marks
              which sorrow and distress have left upon his face; though he is only in his prime in
              the matter of years. While he ate, we smoked and chatted; and when he was finishing he
              found his voice at last, and of his own accord broke out with his personal history. I
              cannot furnish his exact words, but I will come as near it as I can. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1585">THE "WRONG MAN'S" STORY </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1588">It happened like this: I was in Denver. I had been there many years; sometimes I
              remember how many, sometimes I don't—but it isn't any matter. All of a sudden I
              got a notice to leave, or I would be exposed for a horrible crime committed long
              before—years and years before—in the East. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1591">I knew about that crime, but I was not the criminal; it was a cousin of mine of the
              same name. What should I better do? My head was all disordered by fear, and I didn't
              know. I was allowed very little time—only one day, I think it was. I would be
              ruined if I was published, and the people would lynch me, and not believe what I said.
              It is always the way with lynchings: when they find out it is a mistake they are
              sorry, but it is too late—the same as it was with Mr. Holmes, you see. So I said
              I would sell out and get money to live on, and run away until it blew over and I could
              come back with my proofs. Then I escaped in the night and went a long way off in the
              mountains somewhere, and lived disguised and had a false name. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1594">I got more and more troubled and worried, and my troubles made me see spirits and
              hear voices, and I could not think straight and clear on any subject, but got confused
              and involved and had to give it up, because my head hurt so. It got to be worse and
              worse; more spirits and more voices. They were about me all the time; at first only in
              the night, then in the day too. They were always whispering around my bed and plotting
              against me, and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out, because I got no good rest.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1597">And then came the worst. One night the whispers said, "We'll never manage, because
              we can't <i>see</i> him, and so can't point him out to the people."
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1603">They sighed; then one said: "We must bring Sherlock Holmes. He can be here in twelve
              days." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1606">They all agreed, and whispered and jibbered with joy. But my heart broke; for I had
              read about that man, and knew what it would be to have him upon my track, with his
              superhuman penetration and tireless energies. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1610">The spirits went away to fetch him, and I got up at once in the middle of the night
              and fled away, carrying nothing but the hand-bag that had my money in it—thirty
              thousand dollars; two-thirds of it are in the bag there yet. It was forty days before
              that man caught up on my track. I just escaped. From habit he had written his real
              name on a tavern register, but had scratched it out and written "Dagget Barclay" in
              the place of it. But fear gives you a watchful eye and keen, and I read the true name
              through the scratches, and fled like a deer. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1613">He has hunted me all over this world for three years and a half—the Pacific
              states, Australasia, India—everywhere you can think of; then back to Mexico and
              up to California again, giving me hardly any rest; but that name on the registers
              always saved me, and what is left of me is alive yet. And I am <i>so</i> tired! A cruel time he has given me, yet I give you my honor I have never
              harmed him nor any man. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1619">That was the end of the story, and it stirred those boys to bloodheat, he sure of
              it. As for me—each word burnt a hole in me where it struck. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1622">We voted that the old man should bunk with us, and be my guest and Hillyer's. I
              shall keep my own counsel, naturally; but as soon as he is well rested and nourished,
              I shall take him to Denver and rehabilitate his fortunes. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1625">The boys gave the old fellow the bone-smashing good-fellowship handshake of the
              mines, and then scattered away to spread the news. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1628">At dawn next morning Wells-Fargo Ferguson and Ham Sandwich called us softly out, and
              said, privately: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1631">"That news about the way that old stranger has been treated has spread all around,
              and the camps are up. They are piling in from everywhere, and are going to lynch the
              P'fessor. Constable Harris is in a dead funk, and has telephoned the sheriff. Come
              along!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1634">We started on a run. The others were privileged to feel as they chose, but in my
              heart's privacy I hoped the sheriff would arrive in time; for I had small desire that
              Sherlock Holmes should hang for my deeds, as you can easily believe. I had heard a
              good deal about the sheriff, but </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1637">for reassurance's sake I asked: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1640">"Can he stop a mob?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1643">"Can <i>he</i> stop a mob! Can Jack <i>Fairfax</i>
              stop a mob! Well, I should smile! Ex-desperado—nineteen scalps on his string.
              Can <i>he!</i> Oh, I <i>say!"</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1659">As we tore up the gulch, distant cries and shouts and yells rose faintly on the
              still air, and grew steadily in strength as we raced along. Roar after roar burst out,
              stronger and stronger, nearer and nearer; and at last, when we closed up upon the
              multitude massed in the open area in front of the tavern, the crash of sound was
              deafening. Some brutal roughs from Daly's gorge had Holmes in their grip, and he was
              the calmest man there; a contemptuous smile played about his lips, and if any fear of
              death was in his British heart, his iron personality was master of it and no sign of
              it was allowed to appear. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1662">"Come to a vote, men!" This from one of the Daly gang, Shadbelly Higgins. "Quick! is
              it hang, or shoot?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1665">"Neither!" shouted one of his comrades. "He'll he alive again in a week; burning's
              the only permanency for <i>him."</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1671">The gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a thundercrash of approval, and
              went struggling and surging toward the prisoner, and closed around him, shouting,
              "Fire! fire's the ticket!" They dragged him to the horse-post, backed him against it,
              chained him to it, and piled wood and pine cones around him waist-deep. Still the
              strong face did not blench, and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips.
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1674">"A match! fetch a match!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1677">Shadbelly struck it, shaded it with his hand, stooped, and held it under a pine
              cone. A deep silence fell upon the mob. The cone caught, a tiny flame flickered about
              it a moment or two. I seemed to catch the sound of distant hoofs—it grew more
              distinct—still more and more distinct, more and more definite, but the absorbed
              crowd did not appear to notice it. The match went out. The man struck another,
              stooped, and again the flame rose; this time it took hold and began to
              spread—here and there men turned away their faces. The executioner stood with
              the charred match in his fingers, watching his work. The hoof-beats turned a
              projecting crag, and now they came thundering down upon us. Almost the next moment
              there was a shout: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1680">"The sheriff!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1683">And straightway he came tearing into the midst, stood his horse almost on his hind
              feet, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1686">"Fall back, you gutter-snipes!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1689">He was obeyed. By all but their leader. He stood his ground, and his hand went to
              his revolver. The sheriff covered him promptly, and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1692">"Drop your hand, you parlor desperado. Kick the fire away. Now unchain the
              stranger." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1696">The parlor desperado obeyed. Then the sheriff made a speech; sitting his horse at
              martial ease, and not warming his words with any touch of fire, but delivering them in
              a measured and deliberate way, and in a tone which harmonized with their character and
              made them impressively disrespectful. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1699">"You're a nice lot—now ain't you? Just about eligible to travel with this bilk
              here—Shadbelly Higgins—this loud-mouthed sneak that shoots people in the
              back and calls himself a desperado. If there's anything I do particularly despise,
              it's a lynching mob; I've never seen one that had a man in it. It has to tally up a
              hundred against one before it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor. It's
              made up of cowards, and so is the community that breeds it; and ninety-nine times out
              of a hundred the sheriff's another one." He paused—apparently to turn that last
              idea over in his mind and taste the juice of it—then he went on: "The sheriff
              that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the lowest-down coward there is. By
              the statistics there was a hundred and eighty-two of them drawing sneak pay in America
              last year. By the way it's going, pretty soon there 'll be a new disease in the
                doctor-books—<i>sheriff complaint."</i> That idea pleased
              him—any one could see it. "People will say, 'Sheriff sick again?' 'Yes; got the
              same old thing.' And next there 'll be a new title. People won't say, 'He's running
              for sheriff of Rapaho County,' for instance; they'll say, 'He's running for Coward of
              Rapaho.' Lord, the idea of a grown-up person being afraid of a lynch mob!" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1705">He turned an eye on the captive, and said, "Stranger, who are you, and what have you
              been doing?" </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1708">"My name is Sherlock Holmes, and I have not been doing anything." </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1711">It was wonderful, the impression which the sound of that name made on the sheriff,
              notwithstanding he must have come posted. He spoke up with feeling, and said it was a
              blot on the county that a man whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their
              fame and their ingenuity, and whose histories of them had won every reader's heart by
              the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting, should be visited under the Stars
              and Stripes by an outrage like this. He apologized in the name of the whole nation,
              and made Holmes a most handsome bow, and told Constable Harris to see him to his
              quarters, and hold himself personally responsible if he was molested again. Then he
              turned to the mob and said: </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1714">"Hunt your holes, you scum!" which they did; then he said: "Follow me, Shadbelly;
              I'll take care of your case myself. No—keep your popgun; whenever I see the day
              that I'll be afraid to have you behind me with that thing, it 'll be time for me to
              join last year's hundred and eighty-two"; and he rode off in a walk, Shadbelly
              following. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1717">When we were on our way back to our cabin, toward breakfast-time, we ran upon the
              news that Fetlock Jones had escaped from his lock-up in the night and is gone! Nobody
              is sorry. Let his uncle track him out if he likes; it is in his line; the camp is not
              interested.</p>Chapter X<p id="TwaDoubd1e1723"><i>Ten days later.</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1728">"James Walker" is all right in body now, and his mind shows improvement too. I start
              with him for Denver to-morrow morning. </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1731"><i>Next night. Brief note, mailed at a way-station.</i>
            </p><p id="TwaDoubd1e1736">As we were starting, this morning, Hillyer whispered to me: "Keep this news from
              Walker until you think it safe and not likely to disturb his mind and check his
              improvement: the ancient crime he spoke of was really committed—and by his
              cousin, as he said. We <i>buried the real criminal</i> the other
              day—the unhappiest man that has lived in a century—Flint Buckner. His real
              name was Jacob Fuller!" There, mother, by help of me, an unwitting mourner, your
              husband and my father is in his grave.
