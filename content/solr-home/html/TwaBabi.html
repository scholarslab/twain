                    <i>The fifteenth regular toast was "The Babies. — As they

                </p><p id="TwaBabid1e261"> I LIKE that. We have not all had the good fortune to be ladies. We have not all
                    been generals, or poets, or statesmen; but when the toast works down to the
                    babies, we stand on common ground. It is a shame that for a thousand years the
                    world's banquets have utterly ignored the baby, as if he didn't amount to
                    anything. If you will stop and think a minute — if you will go back fifty
                    or one hundred years to your early married life and recontemplate your first
                    baby — you will remember that he amounted to a good deal, and even
                    something over. You soldiers all know that when that little fellow arrived at
                    family headquarters you had to hand in your resignation. He took entire command.
                    You became his lackey, his mere body-servant, and you had to stand around too.
                    He was not a commander who made allowances for time, distance, weather, or
                    anything else. You had to execute his order whether it was possible or not. And
                    there was only one form of marching in his manual of tactics, and that was the
                    double-quick. He treated you with every sort of insolence and disrespect, and
                    the bravest of you didn't dare to say a word. You could face the death-storm at
                    Donelson and Vicksburg, and give back blow for blow; but when he clawed your
                    whiskers, and pulled your hair, and twisted your nose, you had to take it. When
                    the thunders of war were sounding in your ears you set your faces toward the
                    batteries, and advanced with steady tread; but when he turned on the terrors of
                    his war-whoop, you advanced in the other direction, and mighty glad of the
                    chance, too. When he called for soothing syrup, did you venture to throw out any
                    side-remarks about certain services being unbecoming an officer and a gentleman?
                    No. You got up and <i>got</i> it. When he ordered his pap bottle
                    and it was not warm, did you talk back? Not you. You went to work and <i>warmed</i> it. You ever descended so far in your menial
                    office as to take a suck at that warm, insipid stuff yourself, to see if it was
                    right — three parts water to one of milk, a touch of sugar to modify the
                    colic, and a drop of peppermint to kill those immortal hiccoughs. I can taste
                    that stuff yet. And how many things you learned as you went along! Sentimental
                    young folks still take stock in that beautiful saying that when a baby smiles in
                    his sleep, it is because the angels are whispering to him. Very pretty, but too
                    thin — simply wind on the stomach, my friends. If the baby proposed to
                    take a walk at his usual hour, two o'clock in the morning, didn't you rise up
                    promptly and remark, with a mental addition which would not improve a
                    Sunday-school book <i>much</i>, that that was the very thing you
                    were about to propose yourself? Oh! you were under good discipline, and as you
                    went fluttering up and down the room in your undress uniform, you not only
                    prattled undignified baby talk, but even tuned up your martial voices and tried
                    to <i>sing! — Rock-a-by Baby in the Tree-top</i>, for
                    instance. What a spectacle for an Army of the Tennessee! And what an affliction
                    for the neighbors, too; for it is not everybody within a mile around that likes
                    military music at three in the morning. And when you had been keeping this sort
                    of thing up two or three hours, and your little velvet-head intimated that
                    nothing suited him like exercise and noise, what did you do? You simply <i>went</i> on until you dropped in the last ditch. The idea
                    that a <i>baby</i> doesn't <i>amount</i> to
                    anything! Why, <i>one</i> baby is just a house and a front yard
                    by itself. <i>One</i> baby can furnish more business than you
                    and your whole Interior Department can attend to. He is enterprising,
                    irrepressible, brimful of lawless activities. Do what you please, you can't make
                    him stay on the reservation. Sufficient unto the day is one baby. As long as you
                    are in your right mind, don't you ever pray for twins. Twins amount to a
                    permanent riot. And there ain't any real difference between triplets and an
                    insurrection. </p><p id="TwaBabid1e291"> Yes, it was high time for a toast-master to recognize the importance of the
                    babies. Think what is in store for the present crop! Fifty years from now we
                    shall all be dead, I trust, and then this flag, if it still survive (and let us
                    hope it may), will be floating over a Republic numbering 200,000,000 souls,
                    according to the settled laws of our increase. Our present schooner of State
                    will have grown into a political leviathan — a <i>Great
                        Eastern</i>. The cradled babies of today will be on deck. Let them be well
                    trained, for we are going to leave a big contract on their hands. Among the
                    three or four millions cradles now rocking in the land are some which this
                    nation would preserve for ages as sacred things, if we could know which ones
                    they are. In one of those cradles the unconscious Farragut of the future is at
                    this moment teething — think of it! — and putting in a world of dead
                    earnest, unarticulated, but perfectly justifiable profanity over it, too. In
                    another the future renowned astronomer is blinking at the shining Milky Way with
                    but a languid interest — poor little chap! — and wondering what has
                    become of that other one they call the wet-nurse. In another the future great
                    historian is lying — and doubtless will continue to lie until his earthly
                    mission is ended. In another the future President is busying himself with no
                    profounder problem of state than what the mischief has become of his hair so
                    early; and in a mighty array of other cradles there are now some 60,000 future
                    office-seekers, getting ready to furnish him with occasion to grapple with that
                    same old problem a second time. And in still one more cradle, somewhere under
                    the flag, the future illustrious commander-in-chief of the American armies is so
                    little burdened with his approaching grandeurs and responsibilities as to be
                    giving his whole strategic mind at this moment to trying to find out some way to
                    get his big toe into his mouth — an achievement which, meaning no
                    disrespect, the illustrious guest of this evening turned <i>his</i> entire attention to some fifty-six years ago; and if the child is
                    but a prophecy of the man, there are mighty few who will doubt that he <i>succeeded</i>. </p></div></div></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html><html><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"><meta charset="utf-8"><title>The Babies</title><meta name="author" content="Twain, Mark, 1835-1910"><meta name="description" content=""><link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"></head><body><div id="container"><header role="banner"><h1>The Babies</h1></header><div role="main"><div id="d6" class="div1">

                    promptly and remark, with a mental addition which would not improve a
                    Sunday-school book <i>much</i>, that that was the very thing you
                    were about to propose yourself? Oh! you were under good discipline, and as you
                    went fluttering up and down the room in your undress uniform, you not only
                    prattled undignified baby talk, but even tuned up your martial voices and tried
                    to <i>sing! — Rock-a-by Baby in the Tree-top</i>, for
                    instance. What a spectacle for an Army of the Tennessee! And what an affliction
                    for the neighbors, too; for it is not everybody within a mile around that likes
                    military music at three in the morning. And when you had been keeping this sort
                    of thing up two or three hours, and your little velvet-head intimated that
                    nothing suited him like exercise and noise, what did you do? You simply <i>went</i> on until you dropped in the last ditch. The idea
                    that a <i>baby</i> doesn't <i>amount</i> to
                    anything! Why, <i>one</i> baby is just a house and a front yard
                    by itself. <i>One</i> baby can furnish more business than you
                    and your whole Interior Department can attend to. He is enterprising,
                    irrepressible, brimful of lawless activities. Do what you please, you can't make
                    him stay on the reservation. Sufficient unto the day is one baby. As long as you
                    are in your right mind, don't you ever pray for twins. Twins amount to a

                    babies. Think what is in store for the present crop! Fifty years from now we
                    shall all be dead, I trust, and then this flag, if it still survive (and let us
                    hope it may), will be floating over a Republic numbering 200,000,000 souls,
                    according to the settled laws of our increase. Our present schooner of State

                    trained, for we are going to leave a big contract on their hands. Among the
                    three or four millions cradles now rocking in the land are some which this
                    nation would preserve for ages as sacred things, if we could know which ones

                    this moment teething — think of it! — and putting in a world of dead
                    earnest, unarticulated, but perfectly justifiable profanity over it, too. In
                    another the future renowned astronomer is blinking at the shining Milky Way with
                    but a languid interest — poor little chap! — and wondering what has
                    become of that other one they call the wet-nurse. In another the future great
                    historian is lying — and doubtless will continue to lie until his earthly
                    mission is ended. In another the future President is busying himself with no
                    profounder problem of state than what the mischief has become of his hair so

                </p><p id="TwaBabid1e261"> I LIKE that. We have not all had the good fortune to be ladies. We have not all
                    been generals, or poets, or statesmen; but when the toast works down to the
                    babies, we stand on common ground. It is a shame that for a thousand years the
                    world's banquets have utterly ignored the baby, as if he didn't amount to
                    anything. If you will stop and think a minute — if you will go back fifty
                    or one hundred years to your early married life and recontemplate your first
                    baby — you will remember that he amounted to a good deal, and even
                    something over. You soldiers all know that when that little fellow arrived at
                    family headquarters you had to hand in your resignation. He took entire command.
                    You became his lackey, his mere body-servant, and you had to stand around too.
                    He was not a commander who made allowances for time, distance, weather, or
                    anything else. You had to execute his order whether it was possible or not. And
                    there was only one form of marching in his manual of tactics, and that was the
                    double-quick. He treated you with every sort of insolence and disrespect, and
                    the bravest of you didn't dare to say a word. You could face the death-storm at
                    Donelson and Vicksburg, and give back blow for blow; but when he clawed your
                    whiskers, and pulled your hair, and twisted your nose, you had to take it. When
                    the thunders of war were sounding in your ears you set your faces toward the
                    batteries, and advanced with steady tread; but when he turned on the terrors of
                    his war-whoop, you advanced in the other direction, and mighty glad of the
                    chance, too. When he called for soothing syrup, did you venture to throw out any
                    side-remarks about certain services being unbecoming an officer and a gentleman?
                    No. You got up and <i>got</i> it. When he ordered his pap bottle
                    and it was not warm, did you talk back? Not you. You went to work and <i>warmed</i> it. You ever descended so far in your menial
                    office as to take a suck at that warm, insipid stuff yourself, to see if it was
                    right — three parts water to one of milk, a touch of sugar to modify the
                    colic, and a drop of peppermint to kill those immortal hiccoughs. I can taste
                    that stuff yet. And how many things you learned as you went along! Sentimental
                    young folks still take stock in that beautiful saying that when a baby smiles in
                    his sleep, it is because the angels are whispering to him. Very pretty, but too
                    thin — simply wind on the stomach, my friends. If the baby proposed to

                    been generals, or poets, or statesmen; but when the toast works down to the
                    babies, we stand on common ground. It is a shame that for a thousand years the
                    world's banquets have utterly ignored the baby, as if he didn't amount to
                    anything. If you will stop and think a minute — if you will go back fifty
                    or one hundred years to your early married life and recontemplate your first
                    baby — you will remember that he amounted to a good deal, and even
                    something over. You soldiers all know that when that little fellow arrived at
                    family headquarters you had to hand in your resignation. He took entire command.
                    You became his lackey, his mere body-servant, and you had to stand around too.
                    He was not a commander who made allowances for time, distance, weather, or
                    anything else. You had to execute his order whether it was possible or not. And
                    there was only one form of marching in his manual of tactics, and that was the
                    double-quick. He treated you with every sort of insolence and disrespect, and
                    the bravest of you didn't dare to say a word. You could face the death-storm at
                    Donelson and Vicksburg, and give back blow for blow; but when he clawed your
                    whiskers, and pulled your hair, and twisted your nose, you had to take it. When
                    the thunders of war were sounding in your ears you set your faces toward the
                    batteries, and advanced with steady tread; but when he turned on the terrors of
                    his war-whoop, you advanced in the other direction, and mighty glad of the
                    chance, too. When he called for soothing syrup, did you venture to throw out any
                    side-remarks about certain services being unbecoming an officer and a gentleman?
                    No. You got up and <i>got</i> it. When he ordered his pap bottle
                    and it was not warm, did you talk back? Not you. You went to work and <i>warmed</i> it. You ever descended so far in your menial
                    office as to take a suck at that warm, insipid stuff yourself, to see if it was
                    right — three parts water to one of milk, a touch of sugar to modify the
                    colic, and a drop of peppermint to kill those immortal hiccoughs. I can taste
                    that stuff yet. And how many things you learned as you went along! Sentimental
                    young folks still take stock in that beautiful saying that when a baby smiles in
                    his sleep, it is because the angels are whispering to him. Very pretty, but too
                    thin — simply wind on the stomach, my friends. If the baby proposed to
                    take a walk at his usual hour, two o'clock in the morning, didn't you rise up
                    promptly and remark, with a mental addition which would not improve a
                    Sunday-school book <i>much</i>, that that was the very thing you
                    were about to propose yourself? Oh! you were under good discipline, and as you
                    went fluttering up and down the room in your undress uniform, you not only
                    prattled undignified baby talk, but even tuned up your martial voices and tried
                    to <i>sing! — Rock-a-by Baby in the Tree-top</i>, for
                    instance. What a spectacle for an Army of the Tennessee! And what an affliction
                    for the neighbors, too; for it is not everybody within a mile around that likes
                    military music at three in the morning. And when you had been keeping this sort
                    of thing up two or three hours, and your little velvet-head intimated that
                    nothing suited him like exercise and noise, what did you do? You simply <i>went</i> on until you dropped in the last ditch. The idea
                    that a <i>baby</i> doesn't <i>amount</i> to
                    anything! Why, <i>one</i> baby is just a house and a front yard
                    by itself. <i>One</i> baby can furnish more business than you
                    and your whole Interior Department can attend to. He is enterprising,
                    irrepressible, brimful of lawless activities. Do what you please, you can't make
                    him stay on the reservation. Sufficient unto the day is one baby. As long as you
                    are in your right mind, don't you ever pray for twins. Twins amount to a
                    permanent riot. And there ain't any real difference between triplets and an
                    insurrection. </p><p id="TwaBabid1e291"> Yes, it was high time for a toast-master to recognize the importance of the
                    babies. Think what is in store for the present crop! Fifty years from now we
                    shall all be dead, I trust, and then this flag, if it still survive (and let us
                    hope it may), will be floating over a Republic numbering 200,000,000 souls,

                    three or four millions cradles now rocking in the land are some which this
                    nation would preserve for ages as sacred things, if we could know which ones

                    side-remarks about certain services being unbecoming an officer and a gentleman?
                    No. You got up and <i>got</i> it. When he ordered his pap bottle
                    and it was not warm, did you talk back? Not you. You went to work and <i>warmed</i> it. You ever descended so far in your menial
                    office as to take a suck at that warm, insipid stuff yourself, to see if it was
                    right — three parts water to one of milk, a touch of sugar to modify the
                    colic, and a drop of peppermint to kill those immortal hiccoughs. I can taste
                    that stuff yet. And how many things you learned as you went along! Sentimental
                    young folks still take stock in that beautiful saying that when a baby smiles in
                    his sleep, it is because the angels are whispering to him. Very pretty, but too
                    thin — simply wind on the stomach, my friends. If the baby proposed to
                    take a walk at his usual hour, two o'clock in the morning, didn't you rise up
                    promptly and remark, with a mental addition which would not improve a
                    Sunday-school book <i>much</i>, that that was the very thing you
                    were about to propose yourself? Oh! you were under good discipline, and as you
                    went fluttering up and down the room in your undress uniform, you not only
                    prattled undignified baby talk, but even tuned up your martial voices and tried
                    to <i>sing! — Rock-a-by Baby in the Tree-top</i>, for
                    instance. What a spectacle for an Army of the Tennessee! And what an affliction
                    for the neighbors, too; for it is not everybody within a mile around that likes
                    military music at three in the morning. And when you had been keeping this sort
                    of thing up two or three hours, and your little velvet-head intimated that
                    nothing suited him like exercise and noise, what did you do? You simply <i>went</i> on until you dropped in the last ditch. The idea
                    that a <i>baby</i> doesn't <i>amount</i> to
                    anything! Why, <i>one</i> baby is just a house and a front yard
                    by itself. <i>One</i> baby can furnish more business than you
                    and your whole Interior Department can attend to. He is enterprising,
                    irrepressible, brimful of lawless activities. Do what you please, you can't make
                    him stay on the reservation. Sufficient unto the day is one baby. As long as you
                    are in your right mind, don't you ever pray for twins. Twins amount to a
                    permanent riot. And there ain't any real difference between triplets and an

                    babies. Think what is in store for the present crop! Fifty years from now we
                    shall all be dead, I trust, and then this flag, if it still survive (and let us
                    hope it may), will be floating over a Republic numbering 200,000,000 souls,
                    according to the settled laws of our increase. Our present schooner of State
                    will have grown into a political leviathan — a <i>Great

                    trained, for we are going to leave a big contract on their hands. Among the
                    three or four millions cradles now rocking in the land are some which this
                    nation would preserve for ages as sacred things, if we could know which ones
                    they are. In one of those cradles the unconscious Farragut of the future is at
                    this moment teething — think of it! — and putting in a world of dead
                    earnest, unarticulated, but perfectly justifiable profanity over it, too. In
                    another the future renowned astronomer is blinking at the shining Milky Way with
                    but a languid interest — poor little chap! — and wondering what has
                    become of that other one they call the wet-nurse. In another the future great
                    historian is lying — and doubtless will continue to lie until his earthly
                    mission is ended. In another the future President is busying himself with no
                    profounder problem of state than what the mischief has become of his hair so
                    early; and in a mighty array of other cradles there are now some 60,000 future
                    office-seekers, getting ready to furnish him with occasion to grapple with that

                    babies, we stand on common ground. It is a shame that for a thousand years the

                    anything. If you will stop and think a minute — if you will go back fifty
                    or one hundred years to your early married life and recontemplate your first
                    baby — you will remember that he amounted to a good deal, and even
                    something over. You soldiers all know that when that little fellow arrived at
                    family headquarters you had to hand in your resignation. He took entire command.
                    You became his lackey, his mere body-servant, and you had to stand around too.
                    He was not a commander who made allowances for time, distance, weather, or
                    anything else. You had to execute his order whether it was possible or not. And
                    there was only one form of marching in his manual of tactics, and that was the
                    double-quick. He treated you with every sort of insolence and disrespect, and
                    the bravest of you didn't dare to say a word. You could face the death-storm at
                    Donelson and Vicksburg, and give back blow for blow; but when he clawed your
                    whiskers, and pulled your hair, and twisted your nose, you had to take it. When
                    the thunders of war were sounding in your ears you set your faces toward the

                        Eastern</i>. The cradled babies of today will be on deck. Let them be well
                    trained, for we are going to leave a big contract on their hands. Among the
                    three or four millions cradles now rocking in the land are some which this
                    nation would preserve for ages as sacred things, if we could know which ones
                    they are. In one of those cradles the unconscious Farragut of the future is at
                    this moment teething — think of it! — and putting in a world of dead
                    earnest, unarticulated, but perfectly justifiable profanity over it, too. In
                    another the future renowned astronomer is blinking at the shining Milky Way with
                    but a languid interest — poor little chap! — and wondering what has
                    become of that other one they call the wet-nurse. In another the future great
                    historian is lying — and doubtless will continue to lie until his earthly
                    mission is ended. In another the future President is busying himself with no
                    profounder problem of state than what the mischief has become of his hair so
                    early; and in a mighty array of other cradles there are now some 60,000 future
                    office-seekers, getting ready to furnish him with occasion to grapple with that
                    same old problem a second time. And in still one more cradle, somewhere under
                    the flag, the future illustrious commander-in-chief of the American armies is so
                    little burdened with his approaching grandeurs and responsibilities as to be
                    giving his whole strategic mind at this moment to trying to find out some way to
                    get his big toe into his mouth — an achievement which, meaning no
                    disrespect, the illustrious guest of this evening turned <i>his</i> entire attention to some fifty-six years ago; and if the child is
                    but a prophecy of the man, there are mighty few who will doubt that he <i>succeeded</i>. </p></div></div></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html><html><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"><meta charset="utf-8"><title>The Babies</title><meta name="author" content="Twain, Mark, 1835-1910"><meta name="description" content=""><link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"></head><body><div id="container"><header role="banner"><h1>The Babies</h1></header><div role="main"><div id="d6" class="div1">

                    <i>The fifteenth regular toast was "The Babies. — As they
                        comfort us in our sorrows, let us not forget them in our festivities."</i>
                </p><p id="TwaBabid1e261"> I LIKE that. We have not all had the good fortune to be ladies. We have not all
                    been generals, or poets, or statesmen; but when the toast works down to the
                    babies, we stand on common ground. It is a shame that for a thousand years the
                    world's banquets have utterly ignored the baby, as if he didn't amount to
                    anything. If you will stop and think a minute — if you will go back fifty
                    or one hundred years to your early married life and recontemplate your first
                    baby — you will remember that he amounted to a good deal, and even
                    something over. You soldiers all know that when that little fellow arrived at
                    family headquarters you had to hand in your resignation. He took entire command.
                    You became his lackey, his mere body-servant, and you had to stand around too.
                    He was not a commander who made allowances for time, distance, weather, or
                    anything else. You had to execute his order whether it was possible or not. And
                    there was only one form of marching in his manual of tactics, and that was the
                    double-quick. He treated you with every sort of insolence and disrespect, and
                    the bravest of you didn't dare to say a word. You could face the death-storm at
                    Donelson and Vicksburg, and give back blow for blow; but when he clawed your
                    whiskers, and pulled your hair, and twisted your nose, you had to take it. When
                    the thunders of war were sounding in your ears you set your faces toward the
                    batteries, and advanced with steady tread; but when he turned on the terrors of
                    his war-whoop, you advanced in the other direction, and mighty glad of the
                    chance, too. When he called for soothing syrup, did you venture to throw out any
                    side-remarks about certain services being unbecoming an officer and a gentleman?
                    No. You got up and <i>got</i> it. When he ordered his pap bottle
                    and it was not warm, did you talk back? Not you. You went to work and <i>warmed</i> it. You ever descended so far in your menial
                    office as to take a suck at that warm, insipid stuff yourself, to see if it was
                    right — three parts water to one of milk, a touch of sugar to modify the
                    colic, and a drop of peppermint to kill those immortal hiccoughs. I can taste
                    that stuff yet. And how many things you learned as you went along! Sentimental
                    young folks still take stock in that beautiful saying that when a baby smiles in
                    his sleep, it is because the angels are whispering to him. Very pretty, but too
                    thin — simply wind on the stomach, my friends. If the baby proposed to
                    take a walk at his usual hour, two o'clock in the morning, didn't you rise up
                    promptly and remark, with a mental addition which would not improve a
                    Sunday-school book <i>much</i>, that that was the very thing you
                    were about to propose yourself? Oh! you were under good discipline, and as you
                    went fluttering up and down the room in your undress uniform, you not only
                    prattled undignified baby talk, but even tuned up your martial voices and tried
                    to <i>sing! — Rock-a-by Baby in the Tree-top</i>, for
                    instance. What a spectacle for an Army of the Tennessee! And what an affliction
                    for the neighbors, too; for it is not everybody within a mile around that likes
                    military music at three in the morning. And when you had been keeping this sort
                    of thing up two or three hours, and your little velvet-head intimated that
                    nothing suited him like exercise and noise, what did you do? You simply <i>went</i> on until you dropped in the last ditch. The idea
                    that a <i>baby</i> doesn't <i>amount</i> to
                    anything! Why, <i>one</i> baby is just a house and a front yard
                    by itself. <i>One</i> baby can furnish more business than you
                    and your whole Interior Department can attend to. He is enterprising,
                    irrepressible, brimful of lawless activities. Do what you please, you can't make
                    him stay on the reservation. Sufficient unto the day is one baby. As long as you
                    are in your right mind, don't you ever pray for twins. Twins amount to a
                    permanent riot. And there ain't any real difference between triplets and an
                    insurrection. </p><p id="TwaBabid1e291"> Yes, it was high time for a toast-master to recognize the importance of the
                    babies. Think what is in store for the present crop! Fifty years from now we
                    shall all be dead, I trust, and then this flag, if it still survive (and let us
                    hope it may), will be floating over a Republic numbering 200,000,000 souls,
