            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e171"> ONCE there was a good little boy by the name of Jacob Blivens. He always obeyed his
               parents, no matter how absurd and unreasonable their demands were; and he always
               learned his book, and never was late at Sabbath school. He would not play hookey,
               even when his sober judgment told him it was the most profitable thing he could do.
               None of the other boys could ever make that boy out, he acted so strangely. He
               wouldn't lie, no matter how convenient it was. He just said it was wrong to lie, and
               that was sufficient for him. And he was so honest that he was simply <hr>
               ridiculous. The curious ways that that Jacob had, surpassed everything. He wouldn't
               play marbles on Sunday, he wouldn't rob birds' nests, he wouldn't give hot pennies to
               organ-grinders' monkeys; he didn't seem to take any interest in any kind of rational
               amusement. So the other boys used to try to reason it out and come to an
               understanding of him, but they couldn't arrive at any satisfactory conclusion. As I
               said before, they could only figure out a sort of vague idea that he was "afflicted"
               and so they took him under their protection, and never allowed any harm to come to
               him.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e175"> This good little boy read all the Sunday-school books; they were his greatest
               delight. This was the whole secret of it. He believed in the good little boys they
               put in the Sunday-school books; he had every confidence in them. He longed to come
               across one of them alive, once; but he never did. They all died before his time,
               maybe. Whenever he read about a particularly good one he turned over quickly to the
               end to see what became of him, because he wanted to travel thousands of miles and
               gaze on him; but it wasn't any use; that good little boy always died in the last
               chapter, and there was a picture of the funeral, with all his relations and the
               Sunday-school children standing around the grave in pantaloons that were too short,
               and bonnets that were too large, and everybody crying into handkerchiefs that had as
               much as a yard and a half of stuff in them. He was always headed off in this way. He
               never could see one of those good little boys on account of his always dying in the
               last chapter.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e177"> Jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday-school book. He wanted to be put
               in, with pictures representing him gloriously declining to lie to his mother, and her
               weeping for joy about it; and pictures representing him standing on the doorstep
               giving a penny to a poor beggar-woman with six children, and telling her to spend it
               freely, but not to be extravagant, because extravagance is a sin; and pictures of him
               magnanimously refusing to tell on the bad boy who always lay in wait for him around
               the corner as he came from school, and welted him over the head with a lath, and then
               chased him home, saying, "Hi! hi!" as he proceeded. That was the ambition of young
               Jacob Blivens. He wished to be put in a Sunday-school book. It made him feel a little
               uncomfortable sometimes when he reflected that the good little boys always died. He
               loved to live, <hr> you know, and this was the most unpleasant feature about
               being a Sunday-schoolbook boy. He knew it was not healthy to be good. He knew it was
               more fatal than consumption to be so supernaturally good as the boys in the books
               were; he knew that none of them had ever been able to stand it long, and it pained
               him to think that if they put him in a book he wouldn't ever see it, or even if they
               did get the book out before he died it wouldn't be popular without any picture of his
               funeral in the back part of it. It couldn't be much of a Sunday-school book that
               couldn't tell about the advice he gave to the community when he was dying. So at
               last, of course he had to make up his mind to do the best he could under the
               circumstances â€” to live right, and hang on as long as he could, and have his
               dying speech ready when his time came.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e181">

            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e187"> But somehow, nothing ever went right with this good little boy; nothing ever turned
               out with him the way it turned out with boys in the books. They always had a good
               time, and the bad boys had the broken legs; but in his case there was a screw loose
               somewhere, and it all happened just the other way. When he found Jim Blake stealing
               apples, and went under the tree to read to him about the bad little boy who fell out
               of a neighbor's apple-tree and broke his arm, Jim fell out of the tree too, but he
               fell on <i>him</i>, and broke <i>his</i> arm, and Jim
               wasn't hurt at all. Jacob couldn't understand that. There wasn't anything in the
               books like it.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e195">And once, when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in the mud, and Jacob ran to
               help him up and receive his blessing, the blind man did not give him any blessing at
               all, but whacked him over the head with his stick and said <hr> he would like
               to catch him shoving <i>him</i> again, and then pretending to help
               him up. This was not in accordance with any of the books. Jacob looked them all over
               to see.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e202">One thing that Jacob wanted to do was to find a lame dog that hadn't any place to
               stay, and was hungry and persecuted, and bring him home and pet him and have that
               dog's imperishable gratitude. And at last he found one and was happy; and he brought
               him home and fed him, but when he was going to pet him the dog flew at him and tore
               all the clothes off him except those that were in front, and made a spectacle of him
               that was astonishing. He examined authorities, but he could not understand the
               matter. It was of the same breed of dogs that was in the books, but it acted very
               differently. Whatever this boy did he got into trouble. The very things the boys in
               the books got rewarded for turned out to be about the most unprofitable things he
               could invest in.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e204">Once, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, he saw some bad boys starting off
               pleasuring in a sail-boat. He was filled with consternation, because he knew from his
               reading that boys who went sailing on Sunday invariably got drowned. So he ran out on
               a raft to warn them, but a log turned with him and slid him into the river. A man got
               him out pretty soon, and the doctor pumped the water out of him, and gave him a fresh
               start with his bellows, but he caught cold and lay sick a-bed nine weeks. But the
               most unaccountable thing about it was that the bad boys in the boat had a good time
               all day, and then reached home alive and well in the most surprising manner. Jacob
               Blivens said there was nothing like these things in the books. He was perfectly
               dumbfounded.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e207">When he got well he was a little discouraged, but he resolved to keep on trying
               anyhow. He knew that so far his experiences wouldn't do to go in a book, but he
               hadn't yet reached the allotted term of life for good little boys, and he hoped to be
               able to make a record yet if he could hold on till his time was fully up. If
               everything else failed he had his dying speech to fall back on.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e209">He examined his authorities, and found that it was now time for him to go to sea as a
               cabin-boy. He called on a ship captain and made his application, and when the captain
               asked for his recommendations he proudly drew out a tract and pointed to the words,
               "To Jacob Blivens, from his affectionate teacher." But <hr> the captain was a
               coarse, vulgar man, and he said, "Oh, that be blowed! <i>that</i>
               wasn't any proof that he knew how to wash dishes or handle a slush-bucket, and he
               guessed he didn't want him." This was altogether the most extraordinary thing that
               ever happened to Jacob in all his life. A compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had
               never failed to move the tenderest emotions of ship captains, and open the way to all
               offices of honor and profit in their gift â€” it never had in any book that ever
               he had read. He could hardly believe his senses.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e216">
                Black and white illustration of a boy standing on a ship's deck, trying
                     to hand a piece of paper to an older, sinister-looking man.
            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e222">This boy always had a hard time of it. Nothing ever came out according to the
               authorities with him. At last, one day, when he was around hunting up bad little boys
               to admonish, he found a lot of them in an old iron foundry fixing up a little joke on
               fourteen or fifteen dogs, which they had tied together in long procession and were
               going to ornament with empty nitroglycerine cans made fast to their tails. Jacob s
               heart was touched. He sat down on one of those cans â€” for he never minded
               grease when duty was before him â€” and he took hold of the foremost dog by the
               collar, and turned his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones. But just at that moment
               Alderman McWelter, full of wrath, stepped in. All the bad boys ran away, but Jacob
               Blivens rose in conscious innocence and began one of those stately little
               Sunday-school book speeches which always commence with "Oh, sir!" in dead opposition
               to the fact that no boy, good or bad, ever starts a remark with "Oh, sir!" But the
               Alderman never waited to hear the rest. He took Jacob Blivens by the ear and turned
               him around, and hit him a whack in the rear with the flat of his hand; and in an
               instant that good little boy shot out <hr> through the roof and soared away
               towards the sun, with the fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing after him like
               the tail of a kite. And there wasn't a sign of that Alderman or that old iron foundry
               left on the face of the earth, and, as for young Jacob Blivens, he never got a chance
               to make his last dying speech after all his trouble fixing it up, unless he made it
               to the birds; because, although the bulk of him came down all right in a tree-top in
               an adjoining county, the rest of him was apportioned around among four townships, and
               so they had to hold five inquests on him to find out whether he was dead or not, and
               how it occurred. You never saw a boy scattered so.[1]</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e228">Thus perished the good little boy who did the best he could, but didn't come out
               according to the books. Every boy who ever did as he did prospered except him. His
               case is truly remarkable. It will probably never be accounted for.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e230">

               all day, and then reached home alive and well in the most surprising manner. Jacob
               Blivens said there was nothing like these things in the books. He was perfectly
               dumbfounded.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e207">When he got well he was a little discouraged, but he resolved to keep on trying
               anyhow. He knew that so far his experiences wouldn't do to go in a book, but he
               hadn't yet reached the allotted term of life for good little boys, and he hoped to be
               able to make a record yet if he could hold on till his time was fully up. If
               everything else failed he had his dying speech to fall back on.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e209">He examined his authorities, and found that it was now time for him to go to sea as a
               cabin-boy. He called on a ship captain and made his application, and when the captain
               asked for his recommendations he proudly drew out a tract and pointed to the words,
               "To Jacob Blivens, from his affectionate teacher." But <hr> the captain was a
               coarse, vulgar man, and he said, "Oh, that be blowed! <i>that</i>
               wasn't any proof that he knew how to wash dishes or handle a slush-bucket, and he
               guessed he didn't want him." This was altogether the most extraordinary thing that
               ever happened to Jacob in all his life. A compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had
               never failed to move the tenderest emotions of ship captains, and open the way to all
               offices of honor and profit in their gift â€” it never had in any book that ever
               he had read. He could hardly believe his senses.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e216">

                     to hand a piece of paper to an older, sinister-looking man.
            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e222">This boy always had a hard time of it. Nothing ever came out according to the
               authorities with him. At last, one day, when he was around hunting up bad little boys
               to admonish, he found a lot of them in an old iron foundry fixing up a little joke on
               fourteen or fifteen dogs, which they had tied together in long procession and were
               going to ornament with empty nitroglycerine cans made fast to their tails. Jacob s
               heart was touched. He sat down on one of those cans â€” for he never minded
               grease when duty was before him â€” and he took hold of the foremost dog by the
               collar, and turned his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones. But just at that moment
               Alderman McWelter, full of wrath, stepped in. All the bad boys ran away, but Jacob
               Blivens rose in conscious innocence and began one of those stately little
               Sunday-school book speeches which always commence with "Oh, sir!" in dead opposition
               to the fact that no boy, good or bad, ever starts a remark with "Oh, sir!" But the
               Alderman never waited to hear the rest. He took Jacob Blivens by the ear and turned
               him around, and hit him a whack in the rear with the flat of his hand; and in an
               instant that good little boy shot out <hr> through the roof and soared away
               towards the sun, with the fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing after him like
               the tail of a kite. And there wasn't a sign of that Alderman or that old iron foundry
               left on the face of the earth, and, as for young Jacob Blivens, he never got a chance
               to make his last dying speech after all his trouble fixing it up, unless he made it
               to the birds; because, although the bulk of him came down all right in a tree-top in
               an adjoining county, the rest of him was apportioned around among four townships, and
               so they had to hold five inquests on him to find out whether he was dead or not, and
               how it occurred. You never saw a boy scattered so.[1]</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e228">Thus perished the good little boy who did the best he could, but didn't come out
               according to the books. Every boy who ever did as he did prospered except him. His
               case is truly remarkable. It will probably never be accounted for.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e230">

                     sailboat and gulls are visible in the background.
            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e171"> ONCE there was a good little boy by the name of Jacob Blivens. He always obeyed his
               parents, no matter how absurd and unreasonable their demands were; and he always
               learned his book, and never was late at Sabbath school. He would not play hookey,
               even when his sober judgment told him it was the most profitable thing he could do.
               None of the other boys could ever make that boy out, he acted so strangely. He
               wouldn't lie, no matter how convenient it was. He just said it was wrong to lie, and
               that was sufficient for him. And he was so honest that he was simply <hr>
               ridiculous. The curious ways that that Jacob had, surpassed everything. He wouldn't
               play marbles on Sunday, he wouldn't rob birds' nests, he wouldn't give hot pennies to
               organ-grinders' monkeys; he didn't seem to take any interest in any kind of rational
               amusement. So the other boys used to try to reason it out and come to an
               understanding of him, but they couldn't arrive at any satisfactory conclusion. As I
               said before, they could only figure out a sort of vague idea that he was "afflicted"
               and so they took him under their protection, and never allowed any harm to come to
               him.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e175"> This good little boy read all the Sunday-school books; they were his greatest
               delight. This was the whole secret of it. He believed in the good little boys they
               put in the Sunday-school books; he had every confidence in them. He longed to come
               across one of them alive, once; but he never did. They all died before his time,
               maybe. Whenever he read about a particularly good one he turned over quickly to the
               end to see what became of him, because he wanted to travel thousands of miles and
               gaze on him; but it wasn't any use; that good little boy always died in the last
               chapter, and there was a picture of the funeral, with all his relations and the
               Sunday-school children standing around the grave in pantaloons that were too short,
               and bonnets that were too large, and everybody crying into handkerchiefs that had as
               much as a yard and a half of stuff in them. He was always headed off in this way. He
               never could see one of those good little boys on account of his always dying in the
               last chapter.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e177"> Jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday-school book. He wanted to be put
               in, with pictures representing him gloriously declining to lie to his mother, and her
               weeping for joy about it; and pictures representing him standing on the doorstep
               giving a penny to a poor beggar-woman with six children, and telling her to spend it
               freely, but not to be extravagant, because extravagance is a sin; and pictures of him
               magnanimously refusing to tell on the bad boy who always lay in wait for him around
               the corner as he came from school, and welted him over the head with a lath, and then
               chased him home, saying, "Hi! hi!" as he proceeded. That was the ambition of young
               Jacob Blivens. He wished to be put in a Sunday-school book. It made him feel a little
               uncomfortable sometimes when he reflected that the good little boys always died. He
               loved to live, <hr> you know, and this was the most unpleasant feature about
               being a Sunday-schoolbook boy. He knew it was not healthy to be good. He knew it was
               more fatal than consumption to be so supernaturally good as the boys in the books
               were; he knew that none of them had ever been able to stand it long, and it pained
               him to think that if they put him in a book he wouldn't ever see it, or even if they
               did get the book out before he died it wouldn't be popular without any picture of his
               funeral in the back part of it. It couldn't be much of a Sunday-school book that
               couldn't tell about the advice he gave to the community when he was dying. So at
               last, of course he had to make up his mind to do the best he could under the
               circumstances â€” to live right, and hang on as long as he could, and have his
               dying speech ready when his time came.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e181">

                     The laughing faces of three other boys are visible in the background.

            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e187"> But somehow, nothing ever went right with this good little boy; nothing ever turned
               out with him the way it turned out with boys in the books. They always had a good
               time, and the bad boys had the broken legs; but in his case there was a screw loose
               somewhere, and it all happened just the other way. When he found Jim Blake stealing
               apples, and went under the tree to read to him about the bad little boy who fell out
               of a neighbor's apple-tree and broke his arm, Jim fell out of the tree too, but he
               fell on <i>him</i>, and broke <i>his</i> arm, and Jim
               wasn't hurt at all. Jacob couldn't understand that. There wasn't anything in the
               books like it.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e195">And once, when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in the mud, and Jacob ran to
               help him up and receive his blessing, the blind man did not give him any blessing at
               all, but whacked him over the head with his stick and said <hr> he would like
               to catch him shoving <i>him</i> again, and then pretending to help
               him up. This was not in accordance with any of the books. Jacob looked them all over
               to see.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e202">One thing that Jacob wanted to do was to find a lame dog that hadn't any place to
               stay, and was hungry and persecuted, and bring him home and pet him and have that
               dog's imperishable gratitude. And at last he found one and was happy; and he brought
               him home and fed him, but when he was going to pet him the dog flew at him and tore
               all the clothes off him except those that were in front, and made a spectacle of him
               that was astonishing. He examined authorities, but he could not understand the
               matter. It was of the same breed of dogs that was in the books, but it acted very
               differently. Whatever this boy did he got into trouble. The very things the boys in
               the books got rewarded for turned out to be about the most unprofitable things he
               could invest in.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e204">Once, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, he saw some bad boys starting off
               pleasuring in a sail-boat. He was filled with consternation, because he knew from his
               reading that boys who went sailing on Sunday invariably got drowned. So he ran out on
               a raft to warn them, but a log turned with him and slid him into the river. A man got
               him out pretty soon, and the doctor pumped the water out of him, and gave him a fresh
               start with his bellows, but he caught cold and lay sick a-bed nine weeks. But the
               most unaccountable thing about it was that the bad boys in the boat had a good time
               all day, and then reached home alive and well in the most surprising manner. Jacob
               Blivens said there was nothing like these things in the books. He was perfectly
               dumbfounded.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e207">When he got well he was a little discouraged, but he resolved to keep on trying
               anyhow. He knew that so far his experiences wouldn't do to go in a book, but he
               hadn't yet reached the allotted term of life for good little boys, and he hoped to be
               able to make a record yet if he could hold on till his time was fully up. If
               everything else failed he had his dying speech to fall back on.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e209">He examined his authorities, and found that it was now time for him to go to sea as a
               cabin-boy. He called on a ship captain and made his application, and when the captain
               asked for his recommendations he proudly drew out a tract and pointed to the words,
               "To Jacob Blivens, from his affectionate teacher." But <hr> the captain was a
               coarse, vulgar man, and he said, "Oh, that be blowed! <i>that</i>

               ever happened to Jacob in all his life. A compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had
               never failed to move the tenderest emotions of ship captains, and open the way to all
               offices of honor and profit in their gift â€” it never had in any book that ever

               authorities with him. At last, one day, when he was around hunting up bad little boys
               to admonish, he found a lot of them in an old iron foundry fixing up a little joke on

               much as a yard and a half of stuff in them. He was always headed off in this way. He
               never could see one of those good little boys on account of his always dying in the
               last chapter.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e177"> Jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday-school book. He wanted to be put
               in, with pictures representing him gloriously declining to lie to his mother, and her
               weeping for joy about it; and pictures representing him standing on the doorstep
               giving a penny to a poor beggar-woman with six children, and telling her to spend it
               freely, but not to be extravagant, because extravagance is a sin; and pictures of him
               magnanimously refusing to tell on the bad boy who always lay in wait for him around
               the corner as he came from school, and welted him over the head with a lath, and then
               chased him home, saying, "Hi! hi!" as he proceeded. That was the ambition of young
               Jacob Blivens. He wished to be put in a Sunday-school book. It made him feel a little
               uncomfortable sometimes when he reflected that the good little boys always died. He
               loved to live, <hr> you know, and this was the most unpleasant feature about
               being a Sunday-schoolbook boy. He knew it was not healthy to be good. He knew it was
               more fatal than consumption to be so supernaturally good as the boys in the books
               were; he knew that none of them had ever been able to stand it long, and it pained
               him to think that if they put him in a book he wouldn't ever see it, or even if they
               did get the book out before he died it wouldn't be popular without any picture of his
               funeral in the back part of it. It couldn't be much of a Sunday-school book that
               couldn't tell about the advice he gave to the community when he was dying. So at
               last, of course he had to make up his mind to do the best he could under the
               circumstances â€” to live right, and hang on as long as he could, and have his
               dying speech ready when his time came.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e181">

            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e187"> But somehow, nothing ever went right with this good little boy; nothing ever turned
               out with him the way it turned out with boys in the books. They always had a good
               time, and the bad boys had the broken legs; but in his case there was a screw loose
               somewhere, and it all happened just the other way. When he found Jim Blake stealing
               apples, and went under the tree to read to him about the bad little boy who fell out
               of a neighbor's apple-tree and broke his arm, Jim fell out of the tree too, but he
               fell on <i>him</i>, and broke <i>his</i> arm, and Jim
               wasn't hurt at all. Jacob couldn't understand that. There wasn't anything in the
               books like it.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e195">And once, when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in the mud, and Jacob ran to
               help him up and receive his blessing, the blind man did not give him any blessing at
               all, but whacked him over the head with his stick and said <hr> he would like
               to catch him shoving <i>him</i> again, and then pretending to help
               him up. This was not in accordance with any of the books. Jacob looked them all over
               to see.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e202">One thing that Jacob wanted to do was to find a lame dog that hadn't any place to
               stay, and was hungry and persecuted, and bring him home and pet him and have that
               dog's imperishable gratitude. And at last he found one and was happy; and he brought
               him home and fed him, but when he was going to pet him the dog flew at him and tore
               all the clothes off him except those that were in front, and made a spectacle of him
               that was astonishing. He examined authorities, but he could not understand the
               matter. It was of the same breed of dogs that was in the books, but it acted very
               differently. Whatever this boy did he got into trouble. The very things the boys in
               the books got rewarded for turned out to be about the most unprofitable things he
               could invest in.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e204">Once, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, he saw some bad boys starting off
               pleasuring in a sail-boat. He was filled with consternation, because he knew from his
               reading that boys who went sailing on Sunday invariably got drowned. So he ran out on
               a raft to warn them, but a log turned with him and slid him into the river. A man got
               him out pretty soon, and the doctor pumped the water out of him, and gave him a fresh
               start with his bellows, but he caught cold and lay sick a-bed nine weeks. But the
               most unaccountable thing about it was that the bad boys in the boat had a good time
               all day, and then reached home alive and well in the most surprising manner. Jacob
               Blivens said there was nothing like these things in the books. He was perfectly
               dumbfounded.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e207">When he got well he was a little discouraged, but he resolved to keep on trying
               anyhow. He knew that so far his experiences wouldn't do to go in a book, but he
               hadn't yet reached the allotted term of life for good little boys, and he hoped to be
               able to make a record yet if he could hold on till his time was fully up. If
               everything else failed he had his dying speech to fall back on.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e209">He examined his authorities, and found that it was now time for him to go to sea as a
               cabin-boy. He called on a ship captain and made his application, and when the captain
               asked for his recommendations he proudly drew out a tract and pointed to the words,
               "To Jacob Blivens, from his affectionate teacher." But <hr> the captain was a
               coarse, vulgar man, and he said, "Oh, that be blowed! <i>that</i>
               wasn't any proof that he knew how to wash dishes or handle a slush-bucket, and he
               guessed he didn't want him." This was altogether the most extraordinary thing that
               ever happened to Jacob in all his life. A compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had
               never failed to move the tenderest emotions of ship captains, and open the way to all
               offices of honor and profit in their gift â€” it never had in any book that ever
               he had read. He could hardly believe his senses.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e216">

                     to hand a piece of paper to an older, sinister-looking man.
            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e222">This boy always had a hard time of it. Nothing ever came out according to the
               authorities with him. At last, one day, when he was around hunting up bad little boys
               to admonish, he found a lot of them in an old iron foundry fixing up a little joke on
               fourteen or fifteen dogs, which they had tied together in long procession and were
               going to ornament with empty nitroglycerine cans made fast to their tails. Jacob s
               heart was touched. He sat down on one of those cans â€” for he never minded
               grease when duty was before him â€” and he took hold of the foremost dog by the
               collar, and turned his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones. But just at that moment
               Alderman McWelter, full of wrath, stepped in. All the bad boys ran away, but Jacob
               Blivens rose in conscious innocence and began one of those stately little
               Sunday-school book speeches which always commence with "Oh, sir!" in dead opposition
               to the fact that no boy, good or bad, ever starts a remark with "Oh, sir!" But the
               Alderman never waited to hear the rest. He took Jacob Blivens by the ear and turned
               him around, and hit him a whack in the rear with the flat of his hand; and in an
               instant that good little boy shot out <hr> through the roof and soared away
               towards the sun, with the fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing after him like
               the tail of a kite. And there wasn't a sign of that Alderman or that old iron foundry
               left on the face of the earth, and, as for young Jacob Blivens, he never got a chance
               to make his last dying speech after all his trouble fixing it up, unless he made it
               to the birds; because, although the bulk of him came down all right in a tree-top in
               an adjoining county, the rest of him was apportioned around among four townships, and
               so they had to hold five inquests on him to find out whether he was dead or not, and
               how it occurred. You never saw a boy scattered so.[1]</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e228">Thus perished the good little boy who did the best he could, but didn't come out
               according to the books. Every boy who ever did as he did prospered except him. His
               case is truly remarkable. It will probably never be accounted for.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e230">

                     a log to stay afloat; a man stands on a nearby pier, reaching out to him. A
                     sailboat and gulls are visible in the background.
            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e171"> ONCE there was a good little boy by the name of Jacob Blivens. He always obeyed his
               parents, no matter how absurd and unreasonable their demands were; and he always
               learned his book, and never was late at Sabbath school. He would not play hookey,
               even when his sober judgment told him it was the most profitable thing he could do.
               None of the other boys could ever make that boy out, he acted so strangely. He
               wouldn't lie, no matter how convenient it was. He just said it was wrong to lie, and
               that was sufficient for him. And he was so honest that he was simply <hr>
               ridiculous. The curious ways that that Jacob had, surpassed everything. He wouldn't
               play marbles on Sunday, he wouldn't rob birds' nests, he wouldn't give hot pennies to
               organ-grinders' monkeys; he didn't seem to take any interest in any kind of rational
               amusement. So the other boys used to try to reason it out and come to an
               understanding of him, but they couldn't arrive at any satisfactory conclusion. As I
               said before, they could only figure out a sort of vague idea that he was "afflicted"
               and so they took him under their protection, and never allowed any harm to come to
               him.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e175"> This good little boy read all the Sunday-school books; they were his greatest
               delight. This was the whole secret of it. He believed in the good little boys they
               put in the Sunday-school books; he had every confidence in them. He longed to come
               across one of them alive, once; but he never did. They all died before his time,
               maybe. Whenever he read about a particularly good one he turned over quickly to the
               end to see what became of him, because he wanted to travel thousands of miles and
               gaze on him; but it wasn't any use; that good little boy always died in the last
               chapter, and there was a picture of the funeral, with all his relations and the
               Sunday-school children standing around the grave in pantaloons that were too short,
               and bonnets that were too large, and everybody crying into handkerchiefs that had as
               much as a yard and a half of stuff in them. He was always headed off in this way. He
               never could see one of those good little boys on account of his always dying in the
               last chapter.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e177"> Jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday-school book. He wanted to be put

               Blivens rose in conscious innocence and began one of those stately little
               Sunday-school book speeches which always commence with "Oh, sir!" in dead opposition
               to the fact that no boy, good or bad, ever starts a remark with "Oh, sir!" But the
               Alderman never waited to hear the rest. He took Jacob Blivens by the ear and turned
               him around, and hit him a whack in the rear with the flat of his hand; and in an
               instant that good little boy shot out <hr> through the roof and soared away
               towards the sun, with the fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing after him like
               the tail of a kite. And there wasn't a sign of that Alderman or that old iron foundry
               left on the face of the earth, and, as for young Jacob Blivens, he never got a chance
               to make his last dying speech after all his trouble fixing it up, unless he made it
               to the birds; because, although the bulk of him came down all right in a tree-top in
               an adjoining county, the rest of him was apportioned around among four townships, and
               so they had to hold five inquests on him to find out whether he was dead or not, and
               how it occurred. You never saw a boy scattered so.[1]</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e228">Thus perished the good little boy who did the best he could, but didn't come out
               according to the books. Every boy who ever did as he did prospered except him. His
               case is truly remarkable. It will probably never be accounted for.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e230">

            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e171"> ONCE there was a good little boy by the name of Jacob Blivens. He always obeyed his
               parents, no matter how absurd and unreasonable their demands were; and he always
               learned his book, and never was late at Sabbath school. He would not play hookey,
               even when his sober judgment told him it was the most profitable thing he could do.
               None of the other boys could ever make that boy out, he acted so strangely. He
               wouldn't lie, no matter how convenient it was. He just said it was wrong to lie, and
               that was sufficient for him. And he was so honest that he was simply <hr>
               ridiculous. The curious ways that that Jacob had, surpassed everything. He wouldn't
               play marbles on Sunday, he wouldn't rob birds' nests, he wouldn't give hot pennies to
               organ-grinders' monkeys; he didn't seem to take any interest in any kind of rational
               amusement. So the other boys used to try to reason it out and come to an
               understanding of him, but they couldn't arrive at any satisfactory conclusion. As I
               said before, they could only figure out a sort of vague idea that he was "afflicted"
               and so they took him under their protection, and never allowed any harm to come to
               him.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e175"> This good little boy read all the Sunday-school books; they were his greatest
               delight. This was the whole secret of it. He believed in the good little boys they
               put in the Sunday-school books; he had every confidence in them. He longed to come
               across one of them alive, once; but he never did. They all died before his time,
               maybe. Whenever he read about a particularly good one he turned over quickly to the
               end to see what became of him, because he wanted to travel thousands of miles and
               gaze on him; but it wasn't any use; that good little boy always died in the last
               chapter, and there was a picture of the funeral, with all his relations and the
               Sunday-school children standing around the grave in pantaloons that were too short,
               and bonnets that were too large, and everybody crying into handkerchiefs that had as
               much as a yard and a half of stuff in them. He was always headed off in this way. He
               never could see one of those good little boys on account of his always dying in the
               last chapter.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e177"> Jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday-school book. He wanted to be put
               in, with pictures representing him gloriously declining to lie to his mother, and her
               weeping for joy about it; and pictures representing him standing on the doorstep
               giving a penny to a poor beggar-woman with six children, and telling her to spend it
               freely, but not to be extravagant, because extravagance is a sin; and pictures of him
               magnanimously refusing to tell on the bad boy who always lay in wait for him around
               the corner as he came from school, and welted him over the head with a lath, and then
               chased him home, saying, "Hi! hi!" as he proceeded. That was the ambition of young
               Jacob Blivens. He wished to be put in a Sunday-school book. It made him feel a little
               uncomfortable sometimes when he reflected that the good little boys always died. He
               loved to live, <hr> you know, and this was the most unpleasant feature about
               being a Sunday-schoolbook boy. He knew it was not healthy to be good. He knew it was
               more fatal than consumption to be so supernaturally good as the boys in the books
               were; he knew that none of them had ever been able to stand it long, and it pained
               him to think that if they put him in a book he wouldn't ever see it, or even if they
               did get the book out before he died it wouldn't be popular without any picture of his
               funeral in the back part of it. It couldn't be much of a Sunday-school book that
               couldn't tell about the advice he gave to the community when he was dying. So at
               last, of course he had to make up his mind to do the best he could under the
               circumstances â€” to live right, and hang on as long as he could, and have his
               dying speech ready when his time came.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e181">

                     The laughing faces of three other boys are visible in the background.

            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e187"> But somehow, nothing ever went right with this good little boy; nothing ever turned
               out with him the way it turned out with boys in the books. They always had a good
               time, and the bad boys had the broken legs; but in his case there was a screw loose
               somewhere, and it all happened just the other way. When he found Jim Blake stealing
               apples, and went under the tree to read to him about the bad little boy who fell out
               of a neighbor's apple-tree and broke his arm, Jim fell out of the tree too, but he
               fell on <i>him</i>, and broke <i>his</i> arm, and Jim
               wasn't hurt at all. Jacob couldn't understand that. There wasn't anything in the
               books like it.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e195">And once, when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in the mud, and Jacob ran to
               help him up and receive his blessing, the blind man did not give him any blessing at
               all, but whacked him over the head with his stick and said <hr> he would like
               to catch him shoving <i>him</i> again, and then pretending to help
               him up. This was not in accordance with any of the books. Jacob looked them all over
               to see.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e202">One thing that Jacob wanted to do was to find a lame dog that hadn't any place to
               stay, and was hungry and persecuted, and bring him home and pet him and have that
               dog's imperishable gratitude. And at last he found one and was happy; and he brought
               him home and fed him, but when he was going to pet him the dog flew at him and tore
               all the clothes off him except those that were in front, and made a spectacle of him
               that was astonishing. He examined authorities, but he could not understand the
               matter. It was of the same breed of dogs that was in the books, but it acted very
               differently. Whatever this boy did he got into trouble. The very things the boys in
               the books got rewarded for turned out to be about the most unprofitable things he
               could invest in.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e204">Once, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, he saw some bad boys starting off
               pleasuring in a sail-boat. He was filled with consternation, because he knew from his
               reading that boys who went sailing on Sunday invariably got drowned. So he ran out on
               a raft to warn them, but a log turned with him and slid him into the river. A man got
               him out pretty soon, and the doctor pumped the water out of him, and gave him a fresh
               start with his bellows, but he caught cold and lay sick a-bed nine weeks. But the
               most unaccountable thing about it was that the bad boys in the boat had a good time
               all day, and then reached home alive and well in the most surprising manner. Jacob
               Blivens said there was nothing like these things in the books. He was perfectly
               dumbfounded.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e207">When he got well he was a little discouraged, but he resolved to keep on trying
               anyhow. He knew that so far his experiences wouldn't do to go in a book, but he
               hadn't yet reached the allotted term of life for good little boys, and he hoped to be
               able to make a record yet if he could hold on till his time was fully up. If
               everything else failed he had his dying speech to fall back on.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e209">He examined his authorities, and found that it was now time for him to go to sea as a
               cabin-boy. He called on a ship captain and made his application, and when the captain
               asked for his recommendations he proudly drew out a tract and pointed to the words,
               "To Jacob Blivens, from his affectionate teacher." But <hr> the captain was a
               coarse, vulgar man, and he said, "Oh, that be blowed! <i>that</i>
               wasn't any proof that he knew how to wash dishes or handle a slush-bucket, and he
               guessed he didn't want him." This was altogether the most extraordinary thing that
               ever happened to Jacob in all his life. A compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had
               never failed to move the tenderest emotions of ship captains, and open the way to all
               offices of honor and profit in their gift â€” it never had in any book that ever
               he had read. He could hardly believe his senses.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e216">

                     to hand a piece of paper to an older, sinister-looking man.
            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e222">This boy always had a hard time of it. Nothing ever came out according to the
               authorities with him. At last, one day, when he was around hunting up bad little boys
               to admonish, he found a lot of them in an old iron foundry fixing up a little joke on
               fourteen or fifteen dogs, which they had tied together in long procession and were
               going to ornament with empty nitroglycerine cans made fast to their tails. Jacob s
               heart was touched. He sat down on one of those cans â€” for he never minded
               grease when duty was before him â€” and he took hold of the foremost dog by the
               collar, and turned his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones. But just at that moment
               Alderman McWelter, full of wrath, stepped in. All the bad boys ran away, but Jacob
               Blivens rose in conscious innocence and began one of those stately little
               Sunday-school book speeches which always commence with "Oh, sir!" in dead opposition
               to the fact that no boy, good or bad, ever starts a remark with "Oh, sir!" But the
               Alderman never waited to hear the rest. He took Jacob Blivens by the ear and turned
               him around, and hit him a whack in the rear with the flat of his hand; and in an

               the tail of a kite. And there wasn't a sign of that Alderman or that old iron foundry

               time, and the bad boys had the broken legs; but in his case there was a screw loose
               somewhere, and it all happened just the other way. When he found Jim Blake stealing
               apples, and went under the tree to read to him about the bad little boy who fell out
               of a neighbor's apple-tree and broke his arm, Jim fell out of the tree too, but he
               fell on <i>him</i>, and broke <i>his</i> arm, and Jim
               wasn't hurt at all. Jacob couldn't understand that. There wasn't anything in the
               books like it.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e195">And once, when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in the mud, and Jacob ran to
               help him up and receive his blessing, the blind man did not give him any blessing at
               all, but whacked him over the head with his stick and said <hr> he would like
               to catch him shoving <i>him</i> again, and then pretending to help
               him up. This was not in accordance with any of the books. Jacob looked them all over
               to see.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e202">One thing that Jacob wanted to do was to find a lame dog that hadn't any place to
               stay, and was hungry and persecuted, and bring him home and pet him and have that
               dog's imperishable gratitude. And at last he found one and was happy; and he brought
               him home and fed him, but when he was going to pet him the dog flew at him and tore
               all the clothes off him except those that were in front, and made a spectacle of him
               that was astonishing. He examined authorities, but he could not understand the
               matter. It was of the same breed of dogs that was in the books, but it acted very
               differently. Whatever this boy did he got into trouble. The very things the boys in
               the books got rewarded for turned out to be about the most unprofitable things he
               could invest in.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e204">Once, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, he saw some bad boys starting off
               pleasuring in a sail-boat. He was filled with consternation, because he knew from his
               reading that boys who went sailing on Sunday invariably got drowned. So he ran out on
               a raft to warn them, but a log turned with him and slid him into the river. A man got
               him out pretty soon, and the doctor pumped the water out of him, and gave him a fresh
               start with his bellows, but he caught cold and lay sick a-bed nine weeks. But the
               most unaccountable thing about it was that the bad boys in the boat had a good time
               all day, and then reached home alive and well in the most surprising manner. Jacob
               Blivens said there was nothing like these things in the books. He was perfectly
               dumbfounded.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e207">When he got well he was a little discouraged, but he resolved to keep on trying
               anyhow. He knew that so far his experiences wouldn't do to go in a book, but he
               hadn't yet reached the allotted term of life for good little boys, and he hoped to be
               able to make a record yet if he could hold on till his time was fully up. If
               everything else failed he had his dying speech to fall back on.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e209">He examined his authorities, and found that it was now time for him to go to sea as a
               cabin-boy. He called on a ship captain and made his application, and when the captain
               asked for his recommendations he proudly drew out a tract and pointed to the words,
               "To Jacob Blivens, from his affectionate teacher." But <hr> the captain was a
               coarse, vulgar man, and he said, "Oh, that be blowed! <i>that</i>
               wasn't any proof that he knew how to wash dishes or handle a slush-bucket, and he
               guessed he didn't want him." This was altogether the most extraordinary thing that
               ever happened to Jacob in all his life. A compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had
               never failed to move the tenderest emotions of ship captains, and open the way to all
               offices of honor and profit in their gift â€” it never had in any book that ever
               he had read. He could hardly believe his senses.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e216">

                     to hand a piece of paper to an older, sinister-looking man.
            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e222">This boy always had a hard time of it. Nothing ever came out according to the
               authorities with him. At last, one day, when he was around hunting up bad little boys
               to admonish, he found a lot of them in an old iron foundry fixing up a little joke on
               fourteen or fifteen dogs, which they had tied together in long procession and were
               going to ornament with empty nitroglycerine cans made fast to their tails. Jacob s
               heart was touched. He sat down on one of those cans â€” for he never minded
               grease when duty was before him â€” and he took hold of the foremost dog by the
               collar, and turned his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones. But just at that moment
               Alderman McWelter, full of wrath, stepped in. All the bad boys ran away, but Jacob
               Blivens rose in conscious innocence and began one of those stately little
               Sunday-school book speeches which always commence with "Oh, sir!" in dead opposition
               to the fact that no boy, good or bad, ever starts a remark with "Oh, sir!" But the
               Alderman never waited to hear the rest. He took Jacob Blivens by the ear and turned
               him around, and hit him a whack in the rear with the flat of his hand; and in an
               instant that good little boy shot out <hr> through the roof and soared away
               towards the sun, with the fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing after him like
               the tail of a kite. And there wasn't a sign of that Alderman or that old iron foundry
               left on the face of the earth, and, as for young Jacob Blivens, he never got a chance
               to make his last dying speech after all his trouble fixing it up, unless he made it
               to the birds; because, although the bulk of him came down all right in a tree-top in
               an adjoining county, the rest of him was apportioned around among four townships, and
               so they had to hold five inquests on him to find out whether he was dead or not, and
               how it occurred. You never saw a boy scattered so.[1]</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e228">Thus perished the good little boy who did the best he could, but didn't come out
               according to the books. Every boy who ever did as he did prospered except him. His
               case is truly remarkable. It will probably never be accounted for.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e230">

                Black and white illustration of a boy in a lake, desperately clinging to
                     a log to stay afloat; a man stands on a nearby pier, reaching out to him. A
                     sailboat and gulls are visible in the background.
            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e171"> ONCE there was a good little boy by the name of Jacob Blivens. He always obeyed his
               parents, no matter how absurd and unreasonable their demands were; and he always
               learned his book, and never was late at Sabbath school. He would not play hookey,
               even when his sober judgment told him it was the most profitable thing he could do.
               None of the other boys could ever make that boy out, he acted so strangely. He
               wouldn't lie, no matter how convenient it was. He just said it was wrong to lie, and
               that was sufficient for him. And he was so honest that he was simply <hr>
               ridiculous. The curious ways that that Jacob had, surpassed everything. He wouldn't
               play marbles on Sunday, he wouldn't rob birds' nests, he wouldn't give hot pennies to
               organ-grinders' monkeys; he didn't seem to take any interest in any kind of rational
               amusement. So the other boys used to try to reason it out and come to an
               understanding of him, but they couldn't arrive at any satisfactory conclusion. As I
               said before, they could only figure out a sort of vague idea that he was "afflicted"
               and so they took him under their protection, and never allowed any harm to come to
               him.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e175"> This good little boy read all the Sunday-school books; they were his greatest
               delight. This was the whole secret of it. He believed in the good little boys they
               put in the Sunday-school books; he had every confidence in them. He longed to come
               across one of them alive, once; but he never did. They all died before his time,
               maybe. Whenever he read about a particularly good one he turned over quickly to the
               end to see what became of him, because he wanted to travel thousands of miles and
               gaze on him; but it wasn't any use; that good little boy always died in the last
               chapter, and there was a picture of the funeral, with all his relations and the
               Sunday-school children standing around the grave in pantaloons that were too short,
               and bonnets that were too large, and everybody crying into handkerchiefs that had as
               much as a yard and a half of stuff in them. He was always headed off in this way. He
               never could see one of those good little boys on account of his always dying in the
               last chapter.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e177"> Jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday-school book. He wanted to be put
               in, with pictures representing him gloriously declining to lie to his mother, and her
               weeping for joy about it; and pictures representing him standing on the doorstep
               giving a penny to a poor beggar-woman with six children, and telling her to spend it
               freely, but not to be extravagant, because extravagance is a sin; and pictures of him
               magnanimously refusing to tell on the bad boy who always lay in wait for him around
               the corner as he came from school, and welted him over the head with a lath, and then
               chased him home, saying, "Hi! hi!" as he proceeded. That was the ambition of young
               Jacob Blivens. He wished to be put in a Sunday-school book. It made him feel a little
               uncomfortable sometimes when he reflected that the good little boys always died. He
               loved to live, <hr> you know, and this was the most unpleasant feature about
               being a Sunday-schoolbook boy. He knew it was not healthy to be good. He knew it was
               more fatal than consumption to be so supernaturally good as the boys in the books
               were; he knew that none of them had ever been able to stand it long, and it pained
               him to think that if they put him in a book he wouldn't ever see it, or even if they
               did get the book out before he died it wouldn't be popular without any picture of his
               funeral in the back part of it. It couldn't be much of a Sunday-school book that
               couldn't tell about the advice he gave to the community when he was dying. So at
               last, of course he had to make up his mind to do the best he could under the
               circumstances â€” to live right, and hang on as long as he could, and have his
               dying speech ready when his time came.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e181">

            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e187"> But somehow, nothing ever went right with this good little boy; nothing ever turned
               out with him the way it turned out with boys in the books. They always had a good

               fell on <i>him</i>, and broke <i>his</i> arm, and Jim
               wasn't hurt at all. Jacob couldn't understand that. There wasn't anything in the
               books like it.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e195">And once, when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in the mud, and Jacob ran to

            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e171"> ONCE there was a good little boy by the name of Jacob Blivens. He always obeyed his
               parents, no matter how absurd and unreasonable their demands were; and he always
               learned his book, and never was late at Sabbath school. He would not play hookey,
               even when his sober judgment told him it was the most profitable thing he could do.
               None of the other boys could ever make that boy out, he acted so strangely. He
               wouldn't lie, no matter how convenient it was. He just said it was wrong to lie, and
               that was sufficient for him. And he was so honest that he was simply <hr>
               ridiculous. The curious ways that that Jacob had, surpassed everything. He wouldn't
               play marbles on Sunday, he wouldn't rob birds' nests, he wouldn't give hot pennies to
               organ-grinders' monkeys; he didn't seem to take any interest in any kind of rational
               amusement. So the other boys used to try to reason it out and come to an
               understanding of him, but they couldn't arrive at any satisfactory conclusion. As I
               said before, they could only figure out a sort of vague idea that he was "afflicted"
               and so they took him under their protection, and never allowed any harm to come to
               him.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e175"> This good little boy read all the Sunday-school books; they were his greatest
               delight. This was the whole secret of it. He believed in the good little boys they
               put in the Sunday-school books; he had every confidence in them. He longed to come
               across one of them alive, once; but he never did. They all died before his time,
               maybe. Whenever he read about a particularly good one he turned over quickly to the
               end to see what became of him, because he wanted to travel thousands of miles and
               gaze on him; but it wasn't any use; that good little boy always died in the last
               chapter, and there was a picture of the funeral, with all his relations and the
               Sunday-school children standing around the grave in pantaloons that were too short,
               and bonnets that were too large, and everybody crying into handkerchiefs that had as
               much as a yard and a half of stuff in them. He was always headed off in this way. He
               never could see one of those good little boys on account of his always dying in the
               last chapter.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e177"> Jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday-school book. He wanted to be put
               in, with pictures representing him gloriously declining to lie to his mother, and her
               weeping for joy about it; and pictures representing him standing on the doorstep
               giving a penny to a poor beggar-woman with six children, and telling her to spend it
               freely, but not to be extravagant, because extravagance is a sin; and pictures of him
               magnanimously refusing to tell on the bad boy who always lay in wait for him around
               the corner as he came from school, and welted him over the head with a lath, and then
               chased him home, saying, "Hi! hi!" as he proceeded. That was the ambition of young
               Jacob Blivens. He wished to be put in a Sunday-school book. It made him feel a little
               uncomfortable sometimes when he reflected that the good little boys always died. He
               loved to live, <hr> you know, and this was the most unpleasant feature about
               being a Sunday-schoolbook boy. He knew it was not healthy to be good. He knew it was
               more fatal than consumption to be so supernaturally good as the boys in the books
               were; he knew that none of them had ever been able to stand it long, and it pained
               him to think that if they put him in a book he wouldn't ever see it, or even if they
               did get the book out before he died it wouldn't be popular without any picture of his
               funeral in the back part of it. It couldn't be much of a Sunday-school book that
               couldn't tell about the advice he gave to the community when he was dying. So at
               last, of course he had to make up his mind to do the best he could under the
               circumstances â€” to live right, and hang on as long as he could, and have his
               dying speech ready when his time came.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e181">

            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e187"> But somehow, nothing ever went right with this good little boy; nothing ever turned
               out with him the way it turned out with boys in the books. They always had a good
               time, and the bad boys had the broken legs; but in his case there was a screw loose
               somewhere, and it all happened just the other way. When he found Jim Blake stealing
               apples, and went under the tree to read to him about the bad little boy who fell out
               of a neighbor's apple-tree and broke his arm, Jim fell out of the tree too, but he
               fell on <i>him</i>, and broke <i>his</i> arm, and Jim
               wasn't hurt at all. Jacob couldn't understand that. There wasn't anything in the
               books like it.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e195">And once, when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in the mud, and Jacob ran to
               help him up and receive his blessing, the blind man did not give him any blessing at
               all, but whacked him over the head with his stick and said <hr> he would like
               to catch him shoving <i>him</i> again, and then pretending to help
               him up. This was not in accordance with any of the books. Jacob looked them all over
               to see.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e202">One thing that Jacob wanted to do was to find a lame dog that hadn't any place to
               stay, and was hungry and persecuted, and bring him home and pet him and have that
               dog's imperishable gratitude. And at last he found one and was happy; and he brought
               him home and fed him, but when he was going to pet him the dog flew at him and tore
               all the clothes off him except those that were in front, and made a spectacle of him
               that was astonishing. He examined authorities, but he could not understand the
               matter. It was of the same breed of dogs that was in the books, but it acted very
               differently. Whatever this boy did he got into trouble. The very things the boys in
               the books got rewarded for turned out to be about the most unprofitable things he
               could invest in.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e204">Once, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, he saw some bad boys starting off
               pleasuring in a sail-boat. He was filled with consternation, because he knew from his
               reading that boys who went sailing on Sunday invariably got drowned. So he ran out on
               a raft to warn them, but a log turned with him and slid him into the river. A man got
               him out pretty soon, and the doctor pumped the water out of him, and gave him a fresh
               start with his bellows, but he caught cold and lay sick a-bed nine weeks. But the
               most unaccountable thing about it was that the bad boys in the boat had a good time
               all day, and then reached home alive and well in the most surprising manner. Jacob
               Blivens said there was nothing like these things in the books. He was perfectly
               dumbfounded.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e207">When he got well he was a little discouraged, but he resolved to keep on trying
               anyhow. He knew that so far his experiences wouldn't do to go in a book, but he
               hadn't yet reached the allotted term of life for good little boys, and he hoped to be
               able to make a record yet if he could hold on till his time was fully up. If
               everything else failed he had his dying speech to fall back on.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e209">He examined his authorities, and found that it was now time for him to go to sea as a
               cabin-boy. He called on a ship captain and made his application, and when the captain
               asked for his recommendations he proudly drew out a tract and pointed to the words,
               "To Jacob Blivens, from his affectionate teacher." But <hr> the captain was a
               coarse, vulgar man, and he said, "Oh, that be blowed! <i>that</i>
               wasn't any proof that he knew how to wash dishes or handle a slush-bucket, and he
               guessed he didn't want him." This was altogether the most extraordinary thing that
               ever happened to Jacob in all his life. A compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had
               never failed to move the tenderest emotions of ship captains, and open the way to all
               offices of honor and profit in their gift â€” it never had in any book that ever
               he had read. He could hardly believe his senses.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e216">
                Black and white illustration of a boy standing on a ship's deck, trying
                     to hand a piece of paper to an older, sinister-looking man.
            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e222">This boy always had a hard time of it. Nothing ever came out according to the
               authorities with him. At last, one day, when he was around hunting up bad little boys
               to admonish, he found a lot of them in an old iron foundry fixing up a little joke on
               fourteen or fifteen dogs, which they had tied together in long procession and were
               going to ornament with empty nitroglycerine cans made fast to their tails. Jacob s
               heart was touched. He sat down on one of those cans â€” for he never minded
               grease when duty was before him â€” and he took hold of the foremost dog by the
               collar, and turned his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones. But just at that moment
               Alderman McWelter, full of wrath, stepped in. All the bad boys ran away, but Jacob
               Blivens rose in conscious innocence and began one of those stately little
               Sunday-school book speeches which always commence with "Oh, sir!" in dead opposition
               to the fact that no boy, good or bad, ever starts a remark with "Oh, sir!" But the
               Alderman never waited to hear the rest. He took Jacob Blivens by the ear and turned
               him around, and hit him a whack in the rear with the flat of his hand; and in an
               instant that good little boy shot out <hr> through the roof and soared away
               towards the sun, with the fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing after him like
               the tail of a kite. And there wasn't a sign of that Alderman or that old iron foundry
               left on the face of the earth, and, as for young Jacob Blivens, he never got a chance
               to make his last dying speech after all his trouble fixing it up, unless he made it
               to the birds; because, although the bulk of him came down all right in a tree-top in
               an adjoining county, the rest of him was apportioned around among four townships, and
               so they had to hold five inquests on him to find out whether he was dead or not, and
               how it occurred. You never saw a boy scattered so.[1]</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e228">Thus perished the good little boy who did the best he could, but didn't come out
               according to the books. Every boy who ever did as he did prospered except him. His
               case is truly remarkable. It will probably never be accounted for.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e230">

               could invest in.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e204">Once, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, he saw some bad boys starting off
               pleasuring in a sail-boat. He was filled with consternation, because he knew from his
               reading that boys who went sailing on Sunday invariably got drowned. So he ran out on
               a raft to warn them, but a log turned with him and slid him into the river. A man got
               him out pretty soon, and the doctor pumped the water out of him, and gave him a fresh
               start with his bellows, but he caught cold and lay sick a-bed nine weeks. But the
               most unaccountable thing about it was that the bad boys in the boat had a good time
               all day, and then reached home alive and well in the most surprising manner. Jacob
               Blivens said there was nothing like these things in the books. He was perfectly
               dumbfounded.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e207">When he got well he was a little discouraged, but he resolved to keep on trying
               anyhow. He knew that so far his experiences wouldn't do to go in a book, but he
               hadn't yet reached the allotted term of life for good little boys, and he hoped to be
               able to make a record yet if he could hold on till his time was fully up. If
               everything else failed he had his dying speech to fall back on.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e209">He examined his authorities, and found that it was now time for him to go to sea as a
               cabin-boy. He called on a ship captain and made his application, and when the captain
               asked for his recommendations he proudly drew out a tract and pointed to the words,
               "To Jacob Blivens, from his affectionate teacher." But <hr> the captain was a
               coarse, vulgar man, and he said, "Oh, that be blowed! <i>that</i>
               wasn't any proof that he knew how to wash dishes or handle a slush-bucket, and he
               guessed he didn't want him." This was altogether the most extraordinary thing that
               ever happened to Jacob in all his life. A compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had
               never failed to move the tenderest emotions of ship captains, and open the way to all
               offices of honor and profit in their gift â€” it never had in any book that ever
               he had read. He could hardly believe his senses.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e216">

                     to hand a piece of paper to an older, sinister-looking man.
            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e222">This boy always had a hard time of it. Nothing ever came out according to the
               authorities with him. At last, one day, when he was around hunting up bad little boys
               to admonish, he found a lot of them in an old iron foundry fixing up a little joke on
               fourteen or fifteen dogs, which they had tied together in long procession and were
               going to ornament with empty nitroglycerine cans made fast to their tails. Jacob s
               heart was touched. He sat down on one of those cans â€” for he never minded
               grease when duty was before him â€” and he took hold of the foremost dog by the
               collar, and turned his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones. But just at that moment
               Alderman McWelter, full of wrath, stepped in. All the bad boys ran away, but Jacob
               Blivens rose in conscious innocence and began one of those stately little
               Sunday-school book speeches which always commence with "Oh, sir!" in dead opposition
               to the fact that no boy, good or bad, ever starts a remark with "Oh, sir!" But the
               Alderman never waited to hear the rest. He took Jacob Blivens by the ear and turned
               him around, and hit him a whack in the rear with the flat of his hand; and in an
               instant that good little boy shot out <hr> through the roof and soared away
               towards the sun, with the fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing after him like
               the tail of a kite. And there wasn't a sign of that Alderman or that old iron foundry
               left on the face of the earth, and, as for young Jacob Blivens, he never got a chance
               to make his last dying speech after all his trouble fixing it up, unless he made it
               to the birds; because, although the bulk of him came down all right in a tree-top in
               an adjoining county, the rest of him was apportioned around among four townships, and
               so they had to hold five inquests on him to find out whether he was dead or not, and
               how it occurred. You never saw a boy scattered so.[1]</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e228">Thus perished the good little boy who did the best he could, but didn't come out
               according to the books. Every boy who ever did as he did prospered except him. His
               case is truly remarkable. It will probably never be accounted for.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e230">

                     a log to stay afloat; a man stands on a nearby pier, reaching out to him. A
                     sailboat and gulls are visible in the background.
            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e171"> ONCE there was a good little boy by the name of Jacob Blivens. He always obeyed his
               parents, no matter how absurd and unreasonable their demands were; and he always
               learned his book, and never was late at Sabbath school. He would not play hookey,
               even when his sober judgment told him it was the most profitable thing he could do.
               None of the other boys could ever make that boy out, he acted so strangely. He
               wouldn't lie, no matter how convenient it was. He just said it was wrong to lie, and
               that was sufficient for him. And he was so honest that he was simply <hr>
               ridiculous. The curious ways that that Jacob had, surpassed everything. He wouldn't
               play marbles on Sunday, he wouldn't rob birds' nests, he wouldn't give hot pennies to
               organ-grinders' monkeys; he didn't seem to take any interest in any kind of rational
               amusement. So the other boys used to try to reason it out and come to an
               understanding of him, but they couldn't arrive at any satisfactory conclusion. As I
               said before, they could only figure out a sort of vague idea that he was "afflicted"
               and so they took him under their protection, and never allowed any harm to come to
               him.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e175"> This good little boy read all the Sunday-school books; they were his greatest
               delight. This was the whole secret of it. He believed in the good little boys they
               put in the Sunday-school books; he had every confidence in them. He longed to come
               across one of them alive, once; but he never did. They all died before his time,
               maybe. Whenever he read about a particularly good one he turned over quickly to the
               end to see what became of him, because he wanted to travel thousands of miles and
               gaze on him; but it wasn't any use; that good little boy always died in the last
               chapter, and there was a picture of the funeral, with all his relations and the
               Sunday-school children standing around the grave in pantaloons that were too short,
               and bonnets that were too large, and everybody crying into handkerchiefs that had as
               much as a yard and a half of stuff in them. He was always headed off in this way. He
               never could see one of those good little boys on account of his always dying in the
               last chapter.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e177"> Jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday-school book. He wanted to be put
               in, with pictures representing him gloriously declining to lie to his mother, and her
               weeping for joy about it; and pictures representing him standing on the doorstep
               giving a penny to a poor beggar-woman with six children, and telling her to spend it
               freely, but not to be extravagant, because extravagance is a sin; and pictures of him
               magnanimously refusing to tell on the bad boy who always lay in wait for him around
               the corner as he came from school, and welted him over the head with a lath, and then
               chased him home, saying, "Hi! hi!" as he proceeded. That was the ambition of young
               Jacob Blivens. He wished to be put in a Sunday-school book. It made him feel a little
               uncomfortable sometimes when he reflected that the good little boys always died. He
               loved to live, <hr> you know, and this was the most unpleasant feature about
               being a Sunday-schoolbook boy. He knew it was not healthy to be good. He knew it was
               more fatal than consumption to be so supernaturally good as the boys in the books
               were; he knew that none of them had ever been able to stand it long, and it pained
               him to think that if they put him in a book he wouldn't ever see it, or even if they
               did get the book out before he died it wouldn't be popular without any picture of his
               funeral in the back part of it. It couldn't be much of a Sunday-school book that
               couldn't tell about the advice he gave to the community when he was dying. So at
               last, of course he had to make up his mind to do the best he could under the
               circumstances â€” to live right, and hang on as long as he could, and have his
               dying speech ready when his time came.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e181">

                     The laughing faces of three other boys are visible in the background.

            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e187"> But somehow, nothing ever went right with this good little boy; nothing ever turned
               out with him the way it turned out with boys in the books. They always had a good
               time, and the bad boys had the broken legs; but in his case there was a screw loose
               somewhere, and it all happened just the other way. When he found Jim Blake stealing
               apples, and went under the tree to read to him about the bad little boy who fell out
               of a neighbor's apple-tree and broke his arm, Jim fell out of the tree too, but he
               fell on <i>him</i>, and broke <i>his</i> arm, and Jim
               wasn't hurt at all. Jacob couldn't understand that. There wasn't anything in the
               books like it.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e195">And once, when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in the mud, and Jacob ran to
               help him up and receive his blessing, the blind man did not give him any blessing at
               all, but whacked him over the head with his stick and said <hr> he would like
               to catch him shoving <i>him</i> again, and then pretending to help
               him up. This was not in accordance with any of the books. Jacob looked them all over
               to see.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e202">One thing that Jacob wanted to do was to find a lame dog that hadn't any place to
               stay, and was hungry and persecuted, and bring him home and pet him and have that
               dog's imperishable gratitude. And at last he found one and was happy; and he brought
               him home and fed him, but when he was going to pet him the dog flew at him and tore
               all the clothes off him except those that were in front, and made a spectacle of him
               that was astonishing. He examined authorities, but he could not understand the
               matter. It was of the same breed of dogs that was in the books, but it acted very
               differently. Whatever this boy did he got into trouble. The very things the boys in
               the books got rewarded for turned out to be about the most unprofitable things he
               could invest in.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e204">Once, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, he saw some bad boys starting off

               authorities with him. At last, one day, when he was around hunting up bad little boys

               put in the Sunday-school books; he had every confidence in them. He longed to come
               across one of them alive, once; but he never did. They all died before his time,
               maybe. Whenever he read about a particularly good one he turned over quickly to the
               end to see what became of him, because he wanted to travel thousands of miles and
               gaze on him; but it wasn't any use; that good little boy always died in the last
               chapter, and there was a picture of the funeral, with all his relations and the
               Sunday-school children standing around the grave in pantaloons that were too short,
               and bonnets that were too large, and everybody crying into handkerchiefs that had as
               much as a yard and a half of stuff in them. He was always headed off in this way. He
               never could see one of those good little boys on account of his always dying in the
               last chapter.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e177"> Jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday-school book. He wanted to be put
               in, with pictures representing him gloriously declining to lie to his mother, and her
               weeping for joy about it; and pictures representing him standing on the doorstep
               giving a penny to a poor beggar-woman with six children, and telling her to spend it
               freely, but not to be extravagant, because extravagance is a sin; and pictures of him
               magnanimously refusing to tell on the bad boy who always lay in wait for him around
               the corner as he came from school, and welted him over the head with a lath, and then
               chased him home, saying, "Hi! hi!" as he proceeded. That was the ambition of young
               Jacob Blivens. He wished to be put in a Sunday-school book. It made him feel a little
               uncomfortable sometimes when he reflected that the good little boys always died. He
               loved to live, <hr> you know, and this was the most unpleasant feature about
               being a Sunday-schoolbook boy. He knew it was not healthy to be good. He knew it was
               more fatal than consumption to be so supernaturally good as the boys in the books
               were; he knew that none of them had ever been able to stand it long, and it pained
               him to think that if they put him in a book he wouldn't ever see it, or even if they
               did get the book out before he died it wouldn't be popular without any picture of his
               funeral in the back part of it. It couldn't be much of a Sunday-school book that
               couldn't tell about the advice he gave to the community when he was dying. So at
               last, of course he had to make up his mind to do the best he could under the
               circumstances â€” to live right, and hang on as long as he could, and have his
               dying speech ready when his time came.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e181">

            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e187"> But somehow, nothing ever went right with this good little boy; nothing ever turned
               out with him the way it turned out with boys in the books. They always had a good
               time, and the bad boys had the broken legs; but in his case there was a screw loose
               somewhere, and it all happened just the other way. When he found Jim Blake stealing
               apples, and went under the tree to read to him about the bad little boy who fell out
               of a neighbor's apple-tree and broke his arm, Jim fell out of the tree too, but he
               fell on <i>him</i>, and broke <i>his</i> arm, and Jim
               wasn't hurt at all. Jacob couldn't understand that. There wasn't anything in the
               books like it.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e195">And once, when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in the mud, and Jacob ran to
               help him up and receive his blessing, the blind man did not give him any blessing at
               all, but whacked him over the head with his stick and said <hr> he would like
               to catch him shoving <i>him</i> again, and then pretending to help
               him up. This was not in accordance with any of the books. Jacob looked them all over
               to see.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e202">One thing that Jacob wanted to do was to find a lame dog that hadn't any place to
               stay, and was hungry and persecuted, and bring him home and pet him and have that
               dog's imperishable gratitude. And at last he found one and was happy; and he brought
               him home and fed him, but when he was going to pet him the dog flew at him and tore
               all the clothes off him except those that were in front, and made a spectacle of him
               that was astonishing. He examined authorities, but he could not understand the
               matter. It was of the same breed of dogs that was in the books, but it acted very
               differently. Whatever this boy did he got into trouble. The very things the boys in
               the books got rewarded for turned out to be about the most unprofitable things he
               could invest in.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e204">Once, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, he saw some bad boys starting off
               pleasuring in a sail-boat. He was filled with consternation, because he knew from his
               reading that boys who went sailing on Sunday invariably got drowned. So he ran out on
               a raft to warn them, but a log turned with him and slid him into the river. A man got
               him out pretty soon, and the doctor pumped the water out of him, and gave him a fresh
               start with his bellows, but he caught cold and lay sick a-bed nine weeks. But the
               most unaccountable thing about it was that the bad boys in the boat had a good time
               all day, and then reached home alive and well in the most surprising manner. Jacob
               Blivens said there was nothing like these things in the books. He was perfectly
               dumbfounded.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e207">When he got well he was a little discouraged, but he resolved to keep on trying
               anyhow. He knew that so far his experiences wouldn't do to go in a book, but he
               hadn't yet reached the allotted term of life for good little boys, and he hoped to be
               able to make a record yet if he could hold on till his time was fully up. If
               everything else failed he had his dying speech to fall back on.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e209">He examined his authorities, and found that it was now time for him to go to sea as a
               cabin-boy. He called on a ship captain and made his application, and when the captain
               asked for his recommendations he proudly drew out a tract and pointed to the words,
               "To Jacob Blivens, from his affectionate teacher." But <hr> the captain was a
               coarse, vulgar man, and he said, "Oh, that be blowed! <i>that</i>
               wasn't any proof that he knew how to wash dishes or handle a slush-bucket, and he
               guessed he didn't want him." This was altogether the most extraordinary thing that
               ever happened to Jacob in all his life. A compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had
               never failed to move the tenderest emotions of ship captains, and open the way to all
               offices of honor and profit in their gift â€” it never had in any book that ever
               he had read. He could hardly believe his senses.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e216">
                Black and white illustration of a boy standing on a ship's deck, trying
                     to hand a piece of paper to an older, sinister-looking man.
            </p><p id="TwaGoodd1e222">This boy always had a hard time of it. Nothing ever came out according to the
               authorities with him. At last, one day, when he was around hunting up bad little boys
               to admonish, he found a lot of them in an old iron foundry fixing up a little joke on
               fourteen or fifteen dogs, which they had tied together in long procession and were
               going to ornament with empty nitroglycerine cans made fast to their tails. Jacob s
               heart was touched. He sat down on one of those cans â€” for he never minded
               grease when duty was before him â€” and he took hold of the foremost dog by the
               collar, and turned his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones. But just at that moment
               Alderman McWelter, full of wrath, stepped in. All the bad boys ran away, but Jacob
               Blivens rose in conscious innocence and began one of those stately little
               Sunday-school book speeches which always commence with "Oh, sir!" in dead opposition
               to the fact that no boy, good or bad, ever starts a remark with "Oh, sir!" But the
               Alderman never waited to hear the rest. He took Jacob Blivens by the ear and turned
               him around, and hit him a whack in the rear with the flat of his hand; and in an
               instant that good little boy shot out <hr> through the roof and soared away
               towards the sun, with the fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing after him like
               the tail of a kite. And there wasn't a sign of that Alderman or that old iron foundry
               left on the face of the earth, and, as for young Jacob Blivens, he never got a chance
               to make his last dying speech after all his trouble fixing it up, unless he made it
               to the birds; because, although the bulk of him came down all right in a tree-top in
               an adjoining county, the rest of him was apportioned around among four townships, and
               so they had to hold five inquests on him to find out whether he was dead or not, and
               how it occurred. You never saw a boy scattered so.[1]</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e228">Thus perished the good little boy who did the best he could, but didn't come out
               according to the books. Every boy who ever did as he did prospered except him. His
               case is truly remarkable. It will probably never be accounted for.</p><p id="TwaGoodd1e230">
