<head>THE "BODY OF THE NATION."</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">But</hi> <hi rend="italic">the basin of the Mississippi is the</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">Body of the Nation.</hi><lb/>
All the other parts are but members, important in themselves, yet <lb/>
more important in their relations to this. Exclusive of the Lake basin <lb/>
and of 300,000 square miles in Texas and New Mexico, which in many <lb/>
aspects form a part of it, this basin contains about 1,250,000 square <lb/>
miles. In extent it is the second great valley of the world, being <lb/>
exceeded only by that of the Amazon. The valley of the frozen Obi <lb/>
approaches it in extent; that of the La Plata comes next in space, <lb/>
and probably in habitable capacity, having about 8/9 of its area; then <lb/>
comes that of the Yenisei, with about 7/9 the Lena, Amoor, Hoang-ho, <lb/>
Yang-tse-kiang, and Nile, 5/9 the Ganges, less than &frac12; the Indus, <lb/>
less than &frac13; the Euphrates, &frac15; the Rhine, 1/15. It exceeds in extent <lb/>
the whole of Europe, exclusive of Russia, Norway, and Sweden. <hi rend="italic">It <lb/>
would contain Austria four times, Germany or Spain five times, <lb/>
France six times, the British Islands or Italy ten times.</hi> Conceptions <lb/>
formed from the river-basins of Western Europe are rudely shocked <lb/>
when we consider the extent of the valley of the Mississippi; nor <lb/>
are those formed from the sterile basins of the great rivers of Siberia, <lb/>
the lofty plateaus of Central Asia, or the mighty sweep of the swampy <lb/>
Amazon more adequate. Latitude, elevation, and rainfall all combine <lb/>
to render every part of the Mississippi Valley capable of supporting <lb/>
a dense population. <hi rend="italic">As a dwelling-place for civilized man it is by <lb/>
far the first upon our globe.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="small-caps">Editor's Table,</hi> <hi rend="italic">Harper's Magazine, <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> Mississippi is well worth reading about. It is not a <lb/>
commonplace river, but on the contrary is in all ways <lb/>
remarkable. Considering the Missouri its main branch, it is <lb/>
the longest river in the world&mdash;four thousand three hundred <lb/>
miles. It seems safe to say <lb/>
that it is also the crookedest river in <lb/>
the world, since in one part of its <reg orig="jour-|ney">journey</reg> <lb/>
it uses up one thousand three <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
miles to cover the same ground that the <lb/>
crow would fly over in six hundred and seventy-five. It <reg orig="dis-|charges">discharges</reg> <lb/>
three times as much water as the St. Lawrence, <lb/>
twenty-five times as much as the Rhine, and three hundred <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="DSSR_000002932_0033"/>
and thirty-eight times as much as the Thames. No other <lb/>
river has so vast a drainage-basin: it draws its water supply <lb/>
from twenty-eight States and Territories; from Delaware, on <lb/>
the Atlantic seaboard, and from all the country between that <lb/>
and Idaho on the Pacific slope&mdash;a spread of forty-five <lb/>
degrees of longitude. The Mississippi receives and carries <lb/>
to the Gulf water from fifty-four subordinate rivers that are <lb/>
navigable by steamboats, and from some hundreds that <lb/>
are navigable by flats and keels. The area of its <reg orig="drainage-|basin">drainage-basin</reg> <lb/>
is as great as the combined areas of England, Wales, <lb/>
Scotland, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Austria, <lb/>
Italy, and Turkey; and almost all this wide region is fertile; <lb/>
the Mississippi valley, proper, is exceptionally so.</p>
<figure id="f4" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0033">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">a high-water sketch.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>It is a remarkable <lb/>
river in this: that <reg orig="in-|stead">instead</reg> <lb/>
of widening <reg orig="to-|ward">toward</reg> <lb/>
its mouth, it grows <lb/>
narrower; grows narrower and deeper. From the junction <lb/>
of the Ohio to a point half way down to the sea, the width <lb/>
averages a mile in high water: thence to the sea the width <lb/>
steadily diminishes, until, at the "Passes," above the mouth, <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="DSSR_000002932_0034"/>
it is but little over half a mile. At the junction of the Ohio <lb/>
the Mississippi's depth is eighty-seven feet; the depth <lb/>
increases gradually, reaching one hundred and <reg orig="twenty-|nine">twenty-nine</reg> <lb/>
just above the mouth.</p>
<p>The difference in rise and fall is also remarkable&mdash;not in <lb/>
the upper, but in the lower river. The rise is tolerably <lb/>
uniform down to Natchez (three hundred and sixty miles <lb/>
above the mouth)&mdash;about fifty feet. But at Bayou La <lb/>
Fourche the river rises only twenty-four feet; at New Orleans <lb/>
only fifteen, and just above the mouth only two and one <lb/>
half.</p>
<p>An article in the New Orleans "Times-Democrat," based <lb/>
upon reports of able engineers, states that the river annually <lb/>
empties four hundred and six million tons of mud into the <lb/>
Gulf of Mexico&mdash;which brings to mind Captain Marryat's <lb/>
rude name for the Mississippi&mdash;"the Great Sewer." This <lb/>
mud, solidified, would make a mass a mile square and two <lb/>
hundred and forty-one feet high.</p>
<p>The mud deposit gradually extends the land&mdash;but only <lb/>
gradually; it has extended it not quite a third of a mile in <lb/>
the two hundred years which have elapsed since the river <lb/>
took its place in history. The belief of the scientific people <lb/>
is, that the mouth used to be at Baton Rouge, where the hills <lb/>
cease, and that the two hundred miles of land between there <lb/>
and the Gulf was built by the river. This gives us the <lb/>
age of that piece of country, without any trouble at all&mdash; <lb/>
one hundred and twenty thousand years. Yet it is much <lb/>
the youthfulest batch of country that lies around there <lb/>
anywhere.</p>
<p>The Mississippi is remarkable in still another way&mdash;its <lb/>
disposition to make prodigious jumps by cutting through <lb/>
narrow necks of land, and thus straightening and shortening <lb/>
itself. More than once it has shortened itself thirty miles <lb/>
at a single jump! These cut-offs have had curious effects: <lb/>
they have thrown several river towns out into the rural <lb/>
districts, and built up sand bars and forests in front of them. <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="DSSR_000002932_0035"/>
The town of Delta used to be three miles below Vicksburg: <lb/>
a recent cut-off has radically changed the position, and Delta <lb/>
is now <hi rend="italic">two miles above</hi> Vicksburg.</p>
<p>Both of these river towns have been retired to the country <lb/>
by that cut-off. A cut-off plays havoc with boundary lines <lb/>
and jurisdictions: for instance, a man is living in the State <lb/>
of Mississippi to-day, a cut-off occurs to-night, and to-morrow <lb/>
the man finds himself and his land over on the other side of <lb/>
the river, within the boundaries and subject to the laws <lb/>
of the State of Louisiana! Such a thing, happening in the <lb/>
upper river in the old times, could have transferred a slave <lb/>
from Missouri to Illinois and made a free man of him.</p>

</figure>
<p>The Mississippi does not alter its locality by cut-offs alone: <lb/>
it is always changing its habitat <hi rend="italic">bodily</hi>&mdash;is always moving <lb/>
bodily <hi rend="italic">sidewise.</hi> At Hard Times, <lb/>
La., the river is two miles west of the region it used to <lb/>
occupy. As a result, the original <hi rend="italic">site</hi> of that settlement is <lb/>
not now in Louisiana at all, but on the other side of the <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="DSSR_000002932_0036"/>
river, in the State of Mississippi. <hi rend="italic">Nearly the whole of that <lb/>
one thousand three hundred miles of old Mississippi River <lb/>
which La Salle floated down in his canoes, two hundred years <lb/>
ago, is good solid dry ground now.</hi> The river lies to the <lb/>
right of it, in places, and to the left of it in other places.</p>
<p>Although the Mississippi's mud builds land but slowly, <lb/>
down at the mouth, where the Gulf's billows interfere with <lb/>
its work, it builds fast enough in better protected regions <lb/>
higher up: for instance, Prophet's Island contained one <lb/>
thousand five hundred acres of land thirty years ago; since <lb/>
then the river has added seven hundred acres to it.</p>
<p>But enough of these examples of the mighty stream's <lb/>
eccentricities for the present&mdash;I will give a few more of <lb/>
them further along in the book.</p>

<p>Let us drop the Mississippi's physical history, and say <lb/>
a word about its historical history&mdash;so to speak. We can <lb/>
glance briefly at its <lb/>
slumbrous first <lb/>
epoch in a couple <lb/>
of short chapters; <lb/>
at its second and <lb/>
wider-awake epoch <lb/>
in a couple more; at its <lb/>
flushest and widest-awake epoch in a good many <reg orig="succeed-|ing">succeeding</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="DSSR_000002932_0037"/>
chapters; and then talk about its comparatively <lb/>
tranquil present epoch in what shall be left of the <lb/>
book.</p>
<p>The world and the books are so accustomed to use, and <lb/>
over-use, the word "new" in connection with our country, <lb/>
that we early get and permanently retain the impression that <lb/>
there is nothing old about it. We do of course know that <lb/>
there are several comparatively old dates in American <reg orig="his-|tory">history</reg>, <lb/>
but the mere figures convey to our minds no just <lb/>
idea, no distinct realization, of the stretch of time which <lb/>
they represent. To say that De Soto, the first white man <lb/>
who ever saw the Mississippi River, saw it in 1542, is a <lb/>
remark which states a fact without interpreting it: it is <lb/>
something like giving the dimensions of a sunset by <reg orig="astro-|nomical">astronomical</reg> <lb/>
measurements, and cataloguing the colors by their <lb/>
scientific names;&mdash;as a result, you get the bald fact of the <lb/>
sunset, but you don't see the sunset. It would have been <lb/>
better to paint a picture of it.</p>
<p>The date 1542, standing by itself, means little or nothing <lb/>
to us; but when one groups a few neighboring historical <lb/>
dates and facts around it, he adds perspective and color, <lb/>
and then realizes that this is one of the American dates <lb/>
which is quite respectable for age.</p>
<p>For instance, when the Mississippi was first seen by a <lb/>
white man, less than a quarter of a century had elapsed <lb/>
since Francis I.'s defeat at Pavia; the death of Raphael; <lb/>
the death of Bayard, <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">sans peur et sans reproche;</hi></foreign> the driving <lb/>
out of the Knights-Hospitallers from Rhodes by the Turks; <lb/>
and the placarding of the Ninety-Five Propositions,&mdash;the <lb/>
act which began the Reformation. When De Soto took his <lb/>
glimpse of the river, Ignatius Loyola was an obscure <lb/>
name; the order of the Jesuits was not yet a year old; <lb/>
Michael Angelo's paint was not yet dry on the Last <reg orig="Judg-|ment">Judgment</reg> <lb/>
in the Sistine Chapel; Mary Queen of Scots was not <lb/>
yet born, but would be before the year closed. Catherine <lb/>
de Medici was a child; Elizabeth of England was not yet <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="DSSR_000002932_0038"/>
in her teens; Calvin, Benvenuto Cellini, and the Emperor <lb/>
Charles V. were at the top of their fame, and each was <lb/>
manufacturing history after his own peculiar fashion; <lb/>
Margaret of Navarre was writing the "Heptameron" and <lb/>
some religious books,&mdash;the first survives, the others are <reg orig="for-|gotten">forgotten</reg>, <lb/>
wit and indelicacy being sometimes better <reg orig="literature-|preservers">literature-preservers</reg> <lb/>
than holiness; lax court morals and the absurd <lb/>
chivalry business were in full feather, and the joust and the <lb/>
tournament were the frequent pastime of titled fine <reg orig="gentle-|men">gentlemen</reg> <lb/>
who could fight better than they could spell, while <lb/>
religion was the passion of their ladies, and the classifying <lb/>
their offspring into children of full rank and children by <lb/>
brevet their pastime. In <lb/>
fact, all around, religion <lb/>
was in a peculiarly <reg orig="bloom-|ing">blooming</reg> <lb/>
condition: the <lb/>
Council of Trent <lb/>
was being <lb/>
called; the Spanish Inquisition was <lb/>
roasting, and racking, and burning, with a <lb/>
free hand; elsewhere on the continent the nations were <lb/>
being persuaded to holy living by the sword and fire; in <lb/>
England, Henry VIII. had suppressed the monasteries, burnt <lb/>
Fisher and another bishop or two, and was getting his</p>

</figure>
<pb n="28" entity="DSSR_000002932_0039"/>
<p>English reformation and his harem effectively started. <lb/>
When De Soto stood on the banks of the Mississippi, it <lb/>
was still two years before Luther's death; eleven years <lb/>
before the burning of Servetus; thirty years before the <lb/>
St. Bartholomew slaughter; Rabelais was not yet published; <lb/>
"Don Quixote" was not yet written; Shakspeare was not <lb/>
yet born; a hundred long years must still elapse before <lb/>
Englishmen would hear the name of Oliver Cromwell.</p>
<p>Unquestionably the discovery of the Mississippi is a <lb/>
datable fact which considerably mellows and modifies the <lb/>
shiny newness of our country, and gives her a most <reg orig="respect-|able">respectable</reg> <lb/>
outside-aspect of rustiness and antiquity.</p>
<figure id="f8" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0039">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">burial of de soto.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>De Soto merely glimpsed the river, then died and was <lb/>
buried in it by his priests and soldiers. One would expect <lb/>
the priests and the soldiers to multiply the river's dimensions <lb/>
by ten&mdash;the Spanish custom of the day&mdash;and thus move <lb/>
other adventurers to go at once and explore it. On the <reg orig="con-|trary">contrary</reg>, <lb/>
their narratives when they reached home, did not <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="DSSR_000002932_0040"/>
excite that amount of curiosity. The Mississippi was left <lb/>
unvisited by whites during a term of years which seems <lb/>
incredible in our energetic days. One may "sense" the <lb/>
interval to his mind, after a fashion, by dividing it up in <lb/>
this way: After De Soto glimpsed the river, a fraction short <lb/>
of a quarter of a century elapsed, and then Shakspeare was <lb/>
born; lived a trifle more than half a century, then died; <lb/>
and when he had been in his grave considerably more than <lb/>
half a century, the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> white man saw the Mississippi. <lb/>
In our day we don't allow a hundred and thirty years to <lb/>
elapse between glimpses of a marvel. If somebody should <lb/>
discover a creek in the county next to the one that the North <lb/>
Pole is in, Europe and America would start fifteen costly <lb/>
expeditions thither: one to explore the creek, and the other <lb/>
fourteen to hunt for each other.</p>

</figure>
<p>For more than a hundred and fifty years there had been <lb/>
white settlements on our Atlantic coasts. These people <lb/>
were in intimate communication with the Indians: in the <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="DSSR_000002932_0041"/>
south the Spaniards were robbing, slaughtering, enslaving <lb/>
and converting them; higher up, the English were trading <lb/>
beads and blankets to them for a consideration, and <reg orig="throw-|ing">throwing</reg> <lb/>

 and in <lb/>
Canada the French were schooling them in a rudimentary <lb/>
way, missionarying among them, and drawing whole <reg orig="popu-|lations">populations</reg> <lb/>
of them at a time to Quebec, and later to Montreal, <lb/>
to buy furs of them. Necessarily, then, these various <reg orig="clus-|ters">clusters</reg> <lb/>
of whites must have heard of the great river of the far <lb/>
west; and indeed, they did hear of it vaguely,&mdash;so vaguely <lb/>
and indefinitely, that its course, proportions, and locality <lb/>
were hardly even guessable. The mere mysteriousness of <lb/>
the matter ought to have fired curiosity and compelled <lb/>
exploration; but this did not occur. Apparently nobody <lb/>
happened to want such a river, nobody needed it, nobody <lb/>
was curious about it; so, for a century and a half the <reg orig="Mis-|sissippi">Mississippi</reg> <lb/>
remained out of the market and undisturbed. When <lb/>
De Soto found it, he was not hunting for a river, and had <lb/>
no present occasion for one; consequently he did not value <lb/>
it or even take any particular notice of it.</p>
<p>But at last La Salle the Frenchman conceived the idea of <lb/>
seeking out that river and exploring it. It always happens <lb/>
that when a man seizes upon a neglected and important idea, <lb/>
people inflamed with the same notion crop up all around. <lb/>
It happened so in this instance.</p>
<p>Naturally the question suggests itself, Why did these people <lb/>
want the river now when nobody had wanted it in the five <lb/>
preceding generations? Apparently it was because at this <lb/>
late day they thought they had discovered a way to make it <lb/>
useful; for it had come to be believed that the Mississippi <lb/>
emptied into the Gulf of California, and therefore afforded <lb/>
a short cut from Canada to China. Previously the <reg orig="suppo-|sition">supposition</reg> <lb/>
had been that it emptied into the Atlantic, or Sea of <lb/>
Virginia.</p>

<head>THE RIVER AND ITS EXPLORERS.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">La salle</hi> himself sued for certain high privileges, and <lb/>
they were graciously accorded him by Louis XIV. of <lb/>
inflated memory. Chief among them was the privilege to <lb/>
explore, far and wide, and build forts, and stake out <reg orig="conti-|nents">continents</reg>, <lb/>
and hand the same over to the king, and pay the <lb/>
expenses himself; receiving, in return, some little advantages <lb/>
of one sort or another; among them the monopoly of buffalo <lb/>
hides. He spent several years and about all of his money, <lb/>
in making perilous and painful trips between Montreal and a <lb/>
fort which he had built on the Illinois, before he at last <reg orig="suc-|ceeded">succeeded</reg> <lb/>
in getting his expedition in such a shape that he <lb/>
could strike for the Mississippi.</p>
<p>And meantime other parties had had better fortune. In <lb/>
1673 Joliet the merchant, and Marquette the priest, crossed <lb/>
the country and reached the banks of the Mississippi. They <lb/>
went by way of the Great Lakes; and from Green Bay, in <lb/>
canoes, by way of Fox River and the Wisconsin. Marquette <lb/>
had solemnly contracted, on the feast of the Immaculate <lb/>
Conception, that if the Virgin would permit him to discover <lb/>
the great river, he would name it Conception, in her honor. <lb/>
He kept his word. In that day, all explorers travelled with <lb/>
an outfit of priests. De Soto had twenty-four with him. La <lb/>
Salle had several, also. The expeditions were often out of <lb/>
meat, and scant of clothes, but they always had the furniture <lb/>
and other requisites for the mass; they were always <reg orig="pre-|pared">prepared</reg>, <lb/>
as one of the quaint chroniclers of the time phrased <lb/>
it, to "explain hell to the salvages."</p>
<pb n="32" entity="DSSR_000002932_0043"/>
<p>On the 17th of June, 1673, the canoes of Joliet and <reg orig="Mar-|quette">Marquette</reg> <lb/>
and their five subordinates reached the junction of <lb/>
the Wisconsin with the Mississippi. Mr. Parkman says: <lb/>
"Before them a wide and rapid current coursed athwart <lb/>
their way, by the foot of lofty heights wrapped thick in <lb/>
forests." He continues: "Turning southward, they paddled <lb/>
down the stream, through a solitude unrelieved by the <reg orig="faint-|est">faintest</reg> <lb/>
trace of man."</p>
<figure id="f10" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0043">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">crossing the lakes.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>A big cat-fish collided with Marquette's canoe, and startled <lb/>
him; and reasonably enough, for he had been warned by the <lb/>
Indians that he was on a foolhardy journey, and even a fatal <lb/>
one, for the river contained a demon "whose roar could be <lb/>
heard at a great distance, and who would engulf them in the <lb/>
abyss where he dwelt." I have seen a Mississippi cat-fish <lb/>
that was more than six feet long, and weighed two hundred <lb/>
and fifty pounds; and if Marquette's fish was the fellow to <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="DSSR_000002932_0044"/>
that one, he had a fair right to think the river's roaring <lb/>
demon was come.</p>
<p>"At length the buffalo began to appear, grazing in herds <lb/>
on the great prairies which then bordered the river; and <lb/>
Marquette describes the fierce and stupid look of the old <lb/>
bulls as they stared at the intruders through the tangled <lb/>
mane which nearly blinded them."</p>
<p>The voyagers moved cautiously: "Landed at night and <lb/>
made a fire to cook their evening meal; then extinguished <lb/>
it, embarked again, paddled some way farther, and anchored <lb/>
in the stream, keeping a man on the watch till morning."</p>
<figure id="f11" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0044">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">anchored in the stream.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>They did this day after day and night after night; and <lb/>
at the end of two weeks they had not seen a human being. <lb/>
The river was an awful solitude, then. And it is now, over <lb/>
most of its stretch.</p>
<p>But at the close of the fortnight they one day came upon <lb/>
the footprints of men in the mud of the western bank&mdash;a <lb/>
Robinson Crusoe experience which carries an electric shiver <lb/>
with it yet, when one stumbles on it in print. They had <lb/>
been warned that the river Indians were as ferocious and <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="DSSR_000002932_0045"/>
pitiless as the river demon, and destroyed all comers without <lb/>
waiting for provocation; but no matter, Joliet and Marquette <lb/>
struck into the country to hunt up the proprietors of the <lb/>
tracks. They found them, by and by, and were <lb/>
hospitably received and well treated&mdash;if to be <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
by an Indian chief who has taken off his <lb/>
last rag in order to appear at <lb/>
his level best is to be received <reg orig="hos-|pitably">hospitably</reg>; <lb/>
and if to be treated abundantly <lb/>
to fish, porridge, and other game, including dog, and have <lb/>
these things forked into one's mouth by the ungloved fingers <lb/>
of Indians is to be well treated. In the morning the chief <lb/>
and six hundred of his tribesmen escorted the Frenchmen <lb/>
to the river and bade them a friendly farewell.</p>
<figure id="f12" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0045">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"hospitably received."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>On the rocks above the present city of Alton they found <lb/>
some rude and fantastic Indian paintings, which they <lb/>
describe. A short distance below "a torrent of yellow mud <lb/>
rushed furiously athwart the calm blue current of the <reg orig="Mis-|sissippi">Mississippi</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="DSSR_000002932_0046"/>
boiling and surging and sweeping in its course logs, <lb/>
branches, and uprooted trees." This was the mouth of the <lb/>
Missouri, "that savage river," which "descending from its <lb/>
mad career through a vast unknown of barbarism, poured its <lb/>
turbid floods into the bosom of its gentle sister."</p>
<p>By and by they passed the mouth of the Ohio; they passed <lb/>
canebrakes; they fought mosquitoes; they floated along, day <lb/>
after day, through the deep silence and loneliness of the river, <lb/>
drowsing in the scant shade of makeshift awnings, and <reg orig="broil-|ing">broiling</reg> <lb/>
with the heat; they encountered and exchanged civilities <lb/>
with another party of Indians; and at last they reached the <lb/>
mouth of the Arkansas (about a month out from their <reg orig="start-|ing-point)">starting-point)</reg>, <lb/>
where a tribe of war-whooping savages swarmed <lb/>
out to meet and murder them; but they appealed to the <reg orig="Vir-|gin">Virgin</reg> <lb/>
for help; so in place of a fight there was a feast, and <lb/>
plenty of pleasant palaver and fol-de-rol.</p>
<p>They had proved to their satisfaction, that the <reg orig="Missis-|sippi">Mississippi</reg> <lb/>
did not empty into the Gulf of California, or into the <lb/>
Atlantic. They believed it emptied into the Gulf of Mexico. <lb/>
They turned back, now, and carried their great news to <lb/>
Canada.</p>
<p>But belief is not proof. It was reserved for La Salle to <lb/>
furnish the proof. He was provokingly delayed, by one <reg orig="mis-|fortune">misfortune</reg> <lb/>
after another, but at last got his expedition under <lb/>
way at the end of the year 1681. In the dead of winter he <lb/>
and Henri de Tonty, son of Lorenzo Tonty, who invented the <lb/>
tontine, his lieutenant, started down the Illinois, with a <reg orig="fol-|lowing">following</reg> <lb/>
of eighteen Indians brought from New England, and <lb/>
twenty-three Frenchmen. They moved in procession down <lb/>
the surface of the frozen river, on foot, and dragging their <lb/>
canoes after them on sledges.</p>
<p>At Peoria Lake they struck open water, and paddled thence <lb/>
to the Mississippi and turned their prows southward. They <lb/>
ploughed through the fields of floating ice, past the mouth of <lb/>
the Missouri; past the mouth of the Ohio, by and by; "and, <lb/>
gliding by the wastes of bordering swamp, landed on the 24th <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="DSSR_000002932_0047"/>
of February near the Third Chickasaw Bluffs," where they <lb/>
halted and built Fort Prudhomme.</p>
<p>"Again," says Mr. Parkman, "they embarked; and with <lb/>
every stage of their adventurous progress, the mystery of <lb/>
this vast new world was more and more unveiled. More and <lb/>
more they entered the realms of spring. The hazy sunlight, <lb/>
the warm and drowsy air, the tender foliage, the opening <lb/>
flowers, betokened the reviving life of nature."</p>

</figure>
<p>Day by day they floated down the great bends, in the <lb/>
shadow of the dense forests, and in time arrived at the <lb/>
mouth of the Arkansas. First, they were greeted by <lb/>
the natives of this locality as Marquette had before been <lb/>
greeted by them&mdash;with the booming of the war drum and <lb/>
the flourish of arms. The Virgin composed the difficulty in <lb/>
Marquette's case; the pipe of peace did the same office for <lb/>
La Salle. The white man and the red man struck hands and <lb/>
entertained each other during three days. Then, to the <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="DSSR_000002932_0048"/>
admiration of the savages, La Salle set up a cross with the <lb/>
arms of France on it, and took possession of the whole <reg orig="coun-|try">country</reg> <lb/>
for the king&mdash;the cool fashion of the time&mdash;while the <lb/>
priest piously consecrated the robbery with a hymn. The <lb/>
priest explained the mysteries of the faith "by signs," for <lb/>
the saving of the savages; thus compensating them with <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg> <lb/>
possessions in Heaven for the certain ones on earth <lb/>
which they had just been robbed of. And also, by signs, <lb/>
La Salle drew from these simple children of the forest <lb/>
acknowledgments of fealty to Louis the Putrid, over the <lb/>
water. Nobody smiled at these colossal ironies.</p>

<p>These performances took place on the site of the future <lb/>

town of Napoleon, Arkansas, and there the first <reg orig="confiscation-|cross">confiscation-cross</reg> <lb/>
was raised on the banks of the great river. Marquette's <lb/>
and Joliet's voyage of discovery ended at the same spot&mdash; <lb/>
the site of the future town of Napoleon. When De Soto <lb/>
took his fleeting glimpse of the river, away back in the <lb/>
dim early days, he took it from that same spot&mdash;the site <lb/>
of the future town of Napoleon, <lb/>
Arkansas. Therefore, three out of the <lb/>
four memorable events connected with the discovery and <reg orig="ex-|ploration">exploration</reg> <lb/>
of the mighty river occurred, by accident, in one <lb/>
and the same place. It is a most curious distinction, when <lb/>
one comes to look at it and think about it. France stole <lb/>
that vast country on that spot, the future Napoleon; and <lb/>
by and by Napoleon himself was to give the country back <lb/>
again!&mdash;make restitution, not to the owners, but to their <lb/>
white American heirs.</p>

<p>The voyagers journeyed on, touching here and there; <lb/>
"passed the sites, since become historic, of Vicksburg and <lb/>
Grand Gulf;" and visited an imposing Indian monarch in <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="DSSR_000002932_0050"/>
the Teche country, whose capital city was a substantial one <lb/>
of sun-baked bricks mixed with straw&mdash;better houses than <lb/>
many that exist there now. The chief's house contained an <lb/>
audience room forty feet square; and there he received Tonty <lb/>
in State, surrounded by sixty old men clothed in white cloaks. <lb/>
There was a temple in the town, with a mud wall about it <lb/>
ornamented with skulls of enemies sacrificed to the sun.</p>
<p>The voyagers visited the Natchez Indians, near the site of <lb/>
the present city of that name, where they found a "religious <lb/>
and political despotism, a privileged class descended from <lb/>
the sun, a temple and a sacred fire." It must have been like <lb/>
getting home again; it was home with an advantage, in fact, <lb/>
for it lacked Louis XIV.</p>
<p>A few more days swept swiftly by, and La Salle stood in <lb/>
the shadow of his confiscating cross, at the meeting of the <lb/>
waters from Delaware, and from Itaska, and from the <reg orig="moun-|tain">mountain</reg> <lb/>
ranges close upon the Pacific, with the waters of the <lb/>
Gulf of Mexico, his task finished, his prodigy achieved. Mr. <lb/>
Parkman, in closing his fascinating narrative, thus sums up: <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Apparently</hi> the river was ready for business, now. <lb/>
But no, the distribution of a population along its <lb/>
banks was as calm and deliberate and time-devouring a <lb/>
process as the discovery and exploration had been.</p>

</figure>
<p>Seventy years elapsed, <lb/>
after the exploration, <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
the river's borders had <lb/>
a white population worth considering; and nearly fifty more <lb/>
before the river had a commerce. Between La Salle's <reg orig="open-|ing">opening</reg> <lb/>
of the river and the time when it may be said to have <lb/>
become the vehicle of anything like a regular and active <lb/>
commerce, seven sovereigns had occupied the throne of <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="DSSR_000002932_0052"/>
England, America had become an independent nation, Louis <lb/>
XIV. and Louis XV. had rotted and died, the French <reg orig="mon-|archy">monarchy</reg> <lb/>
had gone down in the red tempest of the revolution, <lb/>
and Napoleon was a name that was beginning to be talked <lb/>
about. Truly, there were snails in those days.</p>
<p>The river's earliest commerce was in great <reg orig="barges&mdash;keel-|boats">barges&mdash;keelboats</reg>, <lb/>
broadhorns. They floated and sailed from the upper <lb/>
rivers to New Orleans, changed cargoes there, and were <lb/>
tediously warped and poled back by hand. A voyage down <lb/>
and back sometimes occupied nine months. In time this <lb/>
commerce increased until it gave employment to hordes of <lb/>
rough and hardy men; rude, uneducated, brave, suffering <lb/>
terrific hardships with sailor-like stoicism; heavy drinkers, <lb/>
coarse frolickers in moral sties like the Natchez-under-<reg orig="the-|hill">the-hill</reg> <lb/>
of that day, heavy fighters, reckless fellows, every one, <lb/>
elephantinely jolly, foul-witted, profane; prodigal of their <lb/>
money, bankrupt at the end of the trip, fond of barbaric <lb/>
finery, prodigious braggarts; yet, in the main, honest, <reg orig="trust-|worthy">trustworthy</reg>, <lb/>
faithful to promises and duty, and often picturesquely <lb/>
magnanimous.</p>
<p>By and by the steamboat intruded. Then, for fifteen or <lb/>
twenty years, these men continued to run their keelboats <lb/>
down-stream, and the steamers did all of the up-stream <lb/>
business, the keelboatmen selling their boats in New Orleans, <lb/>
and returning home as deck passengers in the steamers.</p>
<p>But after a while the steamboats so increased in number <lb/>
and in speed that they were able to absorb the entire <reg orig="com-|merce">commerce</reg>; <lb/>
and then keelboating died a permanent death. The <lb/>
keelboatman became a deck hand, or a mate, or a pilot on <lb/>
the steamer; and when steamer-berths were not open to <lb/>
him, he took a berth on a Pittsburgh coal-flat, or on a <reg orig="pine-|raft">pine-raft</reg> <lb/>
constructed in the forests up toward the sources of the <lb/>
Mississippi.</p>
<p>In the heyday of the steamboating prosperity, the river <lb/>
from end to end was flaked with coal-fleets and timber rafts, <lb/>
all managed by hand, and employing hosts of the rough <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="DSSR_000002932_0053"/>
characters whom I have been trying to describe. I <reg orig="remem-|ber">remember</reg> <lb/>
the annual processions of mighty rafts that used to glide <lb/>
by Hannibal when I was a boy,&mdash;an acre or so of white, <lb/>
sweet-smelling boards in each raft, a crew of two dozen men <lb/>
or more, three or four wigwams scattered about the raft's <lb/>
vast level space for storm-quarters,&mdash;and I remember the <lb/>
rude ways and the tremendous talk of their big crews, the <lb/>
ex-keelboatmen and their admiringly patterning successors; <lb/>
for we used to swim out a quarter or third of a mile and get <lb/>
on these rafts and have a ride.</p>

</figure>
<p>By way of illustrating keelboat talk and manners, and <lb/>
that now-departed and hardly-remembered raft-life, I will <lb/>
throw in, in this place, a chapter from a book which I have <lb/>
been working at, by fits and starts, during the past five or <lb/>
six years, and may possibly finish in the course of five or six <lb/>
more. The book is a story which details some passages in <lb/>
the life of an ignorant village boy, Huck Finn, son of the <lb/>
town drunkard of my time out west, there. He has run <lb/>
away from his persecuting father, and from a persecuting <lb/>
good widow who wishes to make a nice, truth-telling, <reg orig="respect-|able">respectable</reg> <lb/>
boy of him; and with him a slave of the widow's has <lb/>
<pb n="43" entity="DSSR_000002932_0054"/>
also escaped. They have found a fragment of a lumber raft <lb/>
(it is high water and dead summer time), and are floating <lb/>
down the river by night, and hiding in the willows by day,&mdash; <lb/>
bound for Cairo,&mdash;whence the negro will seek freedom in <lb/>
the heart of the free States. But in a fog, they pass Cairo <lb/>
without knowing it. By and by they begin to suspect the <lb/>
truth, and Huck Finn is persuaded to end the dismal <reg orig="sus-|pense">suspense</reg> <lb/>
by swimming down to a huge raft which they have <lb/>
seen in the distance ahead of them, creeping aboard under <lb/>
cover of the darkness, and gathering the needed information <lb/>
by eavesdropping:&mdash;</p>
<q>
<p>But you know a young person can't wait very well when he is <lb/>
impatient to find a thing out. We talked it over, and by and by <lb/>
Jim said it was such a black night, now, that it wouldn't be no risk <lb/>
to swim down to the big <lb/>
raft and crawl aboard and <lb/>
listen,&mdash;they would talk about Cairo, because they would be <reg orig="calcu-|lating">calculating</reg> <lb/>
to go ashore there for a spree, maybe, or anyway they would <lb/>
send boats ashore to buy whiskey or fresh meat or something. Jim <lb/>
had a wonderful level head, for a nigger: he could most always <lb/>
start a good plan when you wanted one.</p>
<figure id="f18" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0054">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"i swum along the raft."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>I stood up and shook my rags off and jumped into the river, and <lb/>
struck out for the raft's light. By and by, when I got down nearly <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="DSSR_000002932_0055"/>
to her, I eased up and went slow and cautious. But everything was <lb/>
all right&mdash;nobody at the sweeps. So I swum down along the raft <lb/>
till I was most abreast the camp fire in the middle, then I crawled <lb/>
aboard and inched along and got in amongst some bundles of <reg orig="shin-|gles">shingles</reg> <lb/>
on the weather side of the fire. There was thirteen men there <lb/>
&mdash;they was the watch on deck of course. And a mighty <reg orig="rough-|looking">rough-looking</reg> <lb/>
lot, too. They had a jug, and tin cups, and they kept the <lb/>
jug moving. One man was singing&mdash;roaring, you may say; and <lb/>
it wasn't a nice song&mdash;for a parlor anyway. He roared through <lb/>
his nose, and strung out the last word of every line very long. <lb/>
When he was done they all fetched a kind of Injun war-whoop, <lb/>
and then another was sung. It begun:&mdash;</p>
<q>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>"There was a woman in our towdn,</l>
<l rend="indent">In our towdn did dwed'l (dwell,)</l>
<l>She loved her husband dear-i-lee,</l>
<l rend="indent">But another man twyste as wed'l.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Singing too, riloo, riloo, riloo,</l>
<l rend="indent">Ri-too, riloo, rilay - - - e,</l>
<l>She loved her husband dear-i-lee,</l>
<l rend="indent">But another man twyste as wed'l."</l>
</lg>
</q>
<p>And so on&mdash;fourteen verses. It was kind of poor, and when he <lb/>
was going to start on the next verse one of them said it was the <lb/>
tune the old cow died on; and another one said, "Oh, give us a <lb/>
rest." And another one told him to take a walk. They made <lb/>
fun of him till he got mad and jumped up and begun to cuss the <lb/>
crowd, and said he could lam any thief in the lot.</p>
<p>They was all about to make a break for him, but the biggest <lb/>
man there jumped up and says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Set whar you are, gentlemen. Leave him to me; he's my <lb/>
meat."</p>
<p>Then he jumped up in the air three times and cracked his heels <lb/>
together every time. He flung off a buckskin coat that was all <lb/>
hung with fringes, and says, "You lay thar tell the chawin-up's <lb/>
done;" and flung his hat down, which was all over ribbons, and <lb/>
says, "You lay thar tell his sufferins is over."</p>
<p>Then he jumped up in the air and cracked his heels together <lb/>
again and shouted out:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Whoo-oop! I'm the old original iron-jawed, brass-mounted, <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="DSSR_000002932_0056"/>
copper-bellied corpse-maker from the wilds of Arkansaw!&mdash;Look <lb/>
at me! I'm the man they call Sudden Death and General <reg orig="Desola-|tion">Desolation</reg>! <lb/>
Sired by a hurricane, dam'd by an earthquake, half-brother <lb/>
to the cholera, nearly related to the small-pox on the mother's side! <lb/>
Look at me! I take nineteen alligators and a bar'l of whiskey for <lb/>
breakfast when I'm in <reg orig="ro-|bust">robust</reg> <lb/>
health, and a bushel of <reg orig="rattle-|snakes">rattlesnakes</reg> <lb/>
and a dead body when I'm ailing! <lb/>
I split the everlasting rocks with my glance, <lb/>
and I squench the thunder when I speak! Whoo-oop! Stand back <lb/>
and give me room according to my strength! Blood's my natural <lb/>
drink, and the wails of the dying is music to my ear! Cast your <lb/>
eye on me, gentlemen!&mdash;and lay low and hold your breath, for <lb/>
I'm bout to turn myself loose!"</p>
<figure id="f19" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0056">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"he jumped up in the air."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>All the time he was getting this off, he was shaking his head and <lb/>
looking fierce, and kind of swelling around in a little circle, tucking <lb/>
up his wrist-bands, and now and then straightening up and beating <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="DSSR_000002932_0057"/>
his breast with his fist, saying, "Look at me, gentlemen!" When <lb/>
he got through, he jumped up and cracked his heels together three <lb/>
times, and let off a roaring "whoo-oop! I'm the bloodiest son of <lb/>
a wildcat that lives!"</p>
<figure id="f20" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0057">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"went around in a circle."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Then the man that had started the row tilted his old slouch hat <lb/>
down over his right eye; then he bent stooping forward, with his back <lb/>
sagged and his south end <lb/>
sticking out far, and his fists <lb/>
a-shoving out and drawing in <lb/>
in front of him, and so went <lb/>
around in a little circle about <lb/>
three times, swelling himself <lb/>
up and breathing hard. Then <lb/>
he straightened, and jumped <lb/>
up and cracked his heels <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg> <lb/>
three times before he <lb/>
lit again (that made them <lb/>
cheer), and he begun to shout <lb/>
like this:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Whoo-oop! bow your neck <lb/>
and spread, for the kingdom <lb/>
of sorrow's a-coming! Hold <lb/>
me down to the earth, for I <lb/>
feel my powers a-working! <lb/>
whoo-oop! I'm a child of <lb/>
sin, <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> let me get a start! <lb/>
Smoked glass, here, for all! <lb/>
Don't attempt to look at me <lb/>
with the naked eye, <reg orig="gentle-|men">gentlemen</reg>! <lb/>
When I'm playful I <lb/>
use the meridians of <reg orig="longi-|tude">longitude</reg> <lb/>
and parallels of latitude <lb/>
for a seine, and drag the Atlantic Ocean for whales! I scratch <lb/>
my head with the lightning and purr myself to sleep with the <lb/>
thunder! When I'm cold, I bile the Gulf of Mexico and bathe in <lb/>
it; when I'm hot I fan myself with an equinoctial storm; when <lb/>
I'm thirsty I reach up and suck a cloud dry like a sponge; when <lb/>
I range the earth hungry, famine follows in my tracks! <reg orig="Whoo-|oop">Whoo-oop</reg>! <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="DSSR_000002932_0058"/>
Bow your neck and spread! I put my hand on the sun's <lb/>
face and make it night in the earth; I bite a piece out of the <lb/>
moon and hurry the seasons; I shake myself and crumble the <lb/>
mountains! Contemplate me through leather&mdash;<hi rend="italic">don't</hi> use the naked <lb/>
eye! I'm the man with a petrified heart and biler-iron bowels! <lb/>
The massacre of isolated communities is the pastime of my idle <lb/>
moments, the destruction of nationalities the serious business of <lb/>
my life! The boundless vastness of the great American desert is <lb/>
my enclosed property, and I bury my dead on my own premises!" <lb/>
He jumped up and cracked his heels together three times before he <lb/>
lit (they cheered him again), and as he come down he shouted out: <lb/>
"Whoo-oop! bow your neck and spread, for the pet child of <reg orig="calam-|ity's">calamity's</reg> <lb/>
a-coming!"</p>
<p>Then the other one went to swelling around and blowing again&mdash; <lb/>
the first one&mdash;the one they called Bob; next, the Child of Calamity <lb/>
chipped in again, bigger than ever; then they both got at it at the <lb/>
same time, swelling round and round each other and punching their <lb/>
fists most into each other's faces, and whooping and jawing like <lb/>
Injuns; then Bob called the Child names, and the Child called <lb/>
him names back again: next, Bob called him a heap rougher names <lb/>
and the Child come back at him with the very worst kind of <reg orig="lan-|guage">language</reg>; <lb/>
next, Bob knocked the Child's hat off, and the Child picked <lb/>
it up and kicked Bob's ribbony hat about six foot; Bob went and <lb/>
got it and said never mind, this war n't going to be the last of this <lb/>
thing, because he was a man that never forgot and never forgive, <lb/>
and so the Child better look out, for there was a time a-coming, <lb/>
just as sure as he was a living man, that he would have to answer <lb/>
to him with the best blood in his body. The Child said no man <lb/>
was willinger than he was for that time to come, and he would <lb/>
give Bob fair warning, <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> never to cross his path again, for he <lb/>
could never rest till he had waded in his blood, for such was his <lb/>
nature, though he was sparing him now on account of his family, <lb/>
if he had one.</p>
<p>Both of them was edging away in different directions, growling <lb/>
and shaking their heads and going on about what they was going to <lb/>
do; but a little black-whiskered chap skipped up and says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Come back here, you couple of chicken-livered cowards, and I'll <lb/>
thrash the two of ye!"</p>
<pb n="48" entity="DSSR_000002932_0059"/>
<figure id="f21" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0059">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"he knocked them sprawling."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>And he done it, too. He snatched them, he jerked them this <lb/>
way and that, he booted them around, he knocked them sprawling <lb/>
faster than they could get up. Why, it war n't two minutes till they <lb/>
begged like dogs&mdash;and how the other lot did yell and laugh and <lb/>
clap their hands all the way through, and shout "Sail in, <reg orig="Corpse-|Maker">Corpse-Maker</reg>!" <lb/>
"Hi! at him again, Child of Calamity!" "Bully for you, <lb/>
little Davy!" Well, it was a perfect pow-wow for a while. Bob <lb/>
and the Child had red noses and black eyes when they got through. <lb/>
Little Davy made them own up that they was sneaks and cowards <lb/>
and not fit to eat with a dog or drink with a nigger; then Bob and <lb/>
the Child shook hands with each other, very solemn, and said they <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="DSSR_000002932_0060"/>
had always respected each other and was willing to let bygones be <lb/>
bygones. So then they washed their faces in the river; and just <lb/>
then there was a loud order to stand by for a crossing, and some of <lb/>
them went forward to man the sweeps there, and the rest went aft <lb/>
to handle the after-sweeps.</p>
<p>I laid still and waited for fifteen minutes, and had a smoke out of <lb/>
a pipe that one of them left in reach; then the crossing was finished, <lb/>
and they stumped back and had a drink around and went to talking <lb/>
and singing again. Next they got out an old fiddle, and one <lb/>
played, and another patted juba, and the rest turned themselves <lb/>
loose on a regular old-fashioned keel-boat break-down. They <lb/>
couldn't keep that up very long without getting winded, so by and <lb/>
by they settled around the jug again.</p>
<figure id="f22" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0060">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">an old-fashioned break-down.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>They sung "jolly, jolly raftsman's the life for me," with a rousing <lb/>
chorus, and then they got to talking about differences betwixt hogs, <lb/>
and their different kind of habits; and next about women and their <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="DSSR_000002932_0061"/>
different ways; and next about the best ways to put out houses that <lb/>
was afire; and next about what ought to be done with the Injuns; <lb/>
and next about what a king had to do, and how much he got; <lb/>
and next about how to make cats fight; and next about what to <lb/>
do when a man has fits; and next about differences betwixt <reg orig="clear-|water">clearwater</reg> <lb/>
rivers and muddy-water ones. The man they called Ed said <lb/>
the muddy Mississippi water was wholesomer to drink than the <lb/>
clear water of the Ohio; he said if you let a pint of this yaller <lb/>
Mississippi water settle, you would have about a half to three <lb/>
quarters of an inch of mud in the bottom, according to the stage of <lb/>
the river, and then it war n't no better then Ohio water&mdash;what <lb/>
you wanted to do was to keep it stirred up&mdash;and when the river <lb/>
was low, keep mud on hand to put in and thicken the water up the <lb/>
way it ought to be.</p>
<p>The Child of Calamity said that was so; he said there was <reg orig="nutri-|tiousness">nutritiousness</reg> <lb/>
in the mud, and a man that drunk Mississippi water could <lb/>
grow corn in his stomach if he wanted to. He says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You look at the graveyards; that tells the tale. Trees won't <lb/>
grow worth shucks in a Cincinnati graveyard, but in a Sent Louis <lb/>
graveyard they grow upwards of eight hundred foot high. It's all <lb/>
on account of the water the people drunk before they laid up. A <lb/>
Cincinnati corpse don't richen a soil any."</p>
<p>And they talked about how Ohio water did n't like to mix with <lb/>
Mississippi water. Ed said if you take the Mississippi on a rise <lb/>
when the Ohio is low, you'll find a wide band of clear water all the <lb/>
way down the east side of the Mississippi for a hundred mile or <lb/>
more, and the minute you get out a quarter of a mile from shore <lb/>
and pass the line, it is all thick and yaller the rest of the way across. <lb/>
Then they talked about how to keep tobacco from getting mouldy, <lb/>
and from that they went into ghosts and told about a lot that other <lb/>
folks had seen; but Ed says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Why don't you tell something that you've seen yourselves? <lb/>
Now let me have a say. Five years ago I was on a raft as big as <lb/>
this, and right along here it was a bright moonshiny night, and I <lb/>
was on watch and boss of the stabboard oar forrard, and one of my <lb/>
pards was a man named Dick Allbright, and he come along to where <lb/>
I was sitting, forrard&mdash;gaping and stretching, he was&mdash;and <lb/>
stooped down on the edge of the raft and washed his face in the <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="DSSR_000002932_0062"/>
river, and come and set down by me and got out his pipe, and had <lb/>
just got it filled, when he looks up and says,&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Why looky-here,' he says, 'ain't that Buck Miller's place, over <lb/>
yander in the bend?'</p>
<p>"'Yes,' says I, 'it is&mdash;why?' He laid his pipe down and leant <lb/>
his head on his hand, and says,&mdash;</p>
<p>"'I thought we'd be furder down.' I says,&mdash;</p>
<p>"'I thought it too, when I went off watch'&mdash;we was standing <lb/>
six hours on and six off&mdash;'but the boys told me,' I says, 'that the <lb/>
raft didn't seem to <reg orig="hard-|ly">hardly</reg> <lb/>
move, for the last <lb/>
hour,'&mdash;says I, 'though <lb/>
she's a slipping along <lb/>
all right, now,' says I. <lb/>
He give a kind of a <lb/>
groan, and says,&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f23" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0062">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">the mysterious barrel.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"'I've seed a raft act <lb/>
so before, along here,' <lb/>
he says, ''pears to me <lb/>
the current has most <lb/>
quit above the head of <lb/>
this bend durin' the last <lb/>
two years,' he says.</p>
<p>"Well, he raised up <lb/>
two or three times, and <lb/>
looked away off and <lb/>
around on the water. <lb/>
That started me at it, <lb/>
too. A body is always <lb/>
doing what he sees <lb/>
somebody else doing, though there may n't be no sense in it. <lb/>
Pretty soon I see a black something floating on the water away off <lb/>
to stabboard and quartering behind us. I see he was looking at <lb/>
it, too. I says,&mdash;</p>
<p>"'What's that?' He says, sort of pettish,&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Tain't nothing but an old empty bar'l.'</p>
<p>"'An empty bar'l!' says I, 'why,' says I, 'a spy-glass is a fool <lb/>
to <hi rend="italic">your</hi> eyes. How can you tell it's an empty bar'l?' He says,&mdash;</p>
<pb n="52" entity="DSSR_000002932_0063"/>
<p>"'I don't know; I reckon it ain't a bar'l, but I thought it might <lb/>
be,' says he.</p>
<p>"'Yes,' I says, 'so it might be, and it might be anything else, <lb/>
too; a body can't tell nothing about it, such a distance as that,' I <lb/>
says.</p>
<p>"We had n't nothing else to do, so we kept on watching it. By <lb/>
and by I says,&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Why looky-here, Dick Allbright, that thing's a-gaining on us, <lb/>
I believe.'</p>
<p>"He never said nothing. The thing gained and gained, and I <lb/>
judged it must be a dog that was about tired out. Well, we swung <lb/>
down into the crossing, and the thing floated across the bright streak <lb/>
of the moonshine, and, by George, it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a bar'l. Says I,&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Dick Allbright, what made you think that thing was a bar'l, <lb/>
when it was a half a mile off,' says I. Says he,&mdash;</p>
<p>"'I don't know.' Says I,&mdash;</p>
<p>"'You tell me, Dick Allbright.' He says,&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Well, I knowed it was a bar'l; I've seen it before; lots has <lb/>
seen it; they says it's a hanted bar'l.'</p>
<p>"I called the rest of the watch, and they come and stood there, <lb/>
and I told them what Dick said. It floated right along abreast, <lb/>
now, and did n't gain any more. It was about twenty foot off. <lb/>
Some was for having it aboard, but the rest did n't want to. Dick <lb/>
Allbright said rafts that had fooled with it had got bad luck by it. <lb/>
The captain of the watch said he did n't believe in it. He said he <lb/>
reckoned the bar'l gained on us because it was in a little better <reg orig="cur-|rent">current</reg> <lb/>
than what we was. He said it would leave by and by.</p>
<p>"So then we went to talking about other things, and we had a <lb/>
song, and then a breakdown; and after that the captain of the <lb/>
watch called for another song; but it was clouding up, now, and <lb/>
the bar'l stuck right thar in the same place, and the song did n't <lb/>
seem to have much warm-up to it, somehow, and so they did n't <lb/>
finish it, and there war n't any cheers, but it sort of dropped flat, <lb/>
and nobody said anything for a minute. Then everybody tried to <lb/>
talk at once, and one chap got off a joke, but it war n't no use, <lb/>
they did n't laugh, and even the chap that made the joke did n't <lb/>
laugh at it, which ain't usual. We all just settled down glum, and <lb/>
watched the bar'l, and was on easy and on comfortable. Well, sir, it <lb/>
<pb n="53" entity="DSSR_000002932_0064"/>
shut down black and still, and then the wind begin to moan around, <lb/>
and next the lightning begin to play and the thunder to grumble. <lb/>
And pretty soon there was a regular storm, and in the middle of <lb/>
it a man that was running aft stumbled and fell and sprained his <lb/>
ankle so that he had to lay up. This made the boys shake their <lb/>
heads. And every time the lightning come, there was that bar'l <lb/>
with the blue lights winking around it. We was always on the <lb/>
look-out for it. But by and by, towards dawn, she was gone. When <lb/>
the day come we could n't see her anywhere, and we war n't sorry, <lb/>
neither.</p>
<figure id="f24" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0064">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"soon there was a regular storm."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"But next night about half-past nine, when there was songs and <lb/>
high jinks going on, here she comes again, and took her old roost <lb/>
on the stabboard side. There war n't no more high jinks. <reg orig="Every-|body">Everybody</reg> <lb/>
got solemn; nobody talked; you could n't get anybody to do <lb/>
<pb n="54" entity="DSSR_000002932_0065"/>
anything but set around moody and look at the bar'l. It begun to <lb/>
cloud up again. When the watch changed, the off watch stayed up, <lb/>
'stead of turning in. The storm ripped and roared around all night, <lb/>
and in the middle of it another man tripped and sprained his ankle, <lb/>
and had to knock off. The bar'l left towards day, and nobody see <lb/>
it go.</p>
<p>"Everybody was sober and down in the mouth all day. I don't <lb/>
mean the kind of sober that comes of leaving liquor alone,&mdash;not <lb/>
that. They was quiet, but they all drunk more than usual,&mdash;not <lb/>
together,&mdash;but each man sidled off and took it private, by himself.</p>
<p>"After dark the off watch did n't turn in; nobody sung, nobody <lb/>
talked; the boys did n't scatter around, neither; they sort of huddled <lb/>
together, forrard; and for two hours they set there, perfectly still, <lb/>
looking steady in the one direction, and heaving a sigh once in a <lb/>
while. And then, here comes the bar'l again. She took up her <lb/>
old place. She staid there all night; nobody turned in. The storm <lb/>
come on again, after midnight. It got awful dark; the rain poured <lb/>
down; hail, too; the thunder boomed and roared and bellowed; the <lb/>
wind blowed a hurricane; and the lightning spread over everything <lb/>
in big sheets of glare, and showed the whole raft as plain as day; <lb/>
and the river lashed up white as milk as far as you could see for <lb/>
miles, and there was that bar'l jiggering along, same as ever. The <lb/>
captain ordered the watch to man the after sweeps for a crossing, <lb/>
and nobody would go,&mdash;no more sprained ankles for them, they <lb/>
said. They would n't even <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> aft. Well then, just then the sky <lb/>
split wide open, with a crash, and the lightning killed two men of <lb/>
the after watch, and crippled two more. Crippled them how, says <lb/>
you? Why, <hi rend="italic">sprained their ankles!</hi></p>
<p>"The bar'l left in the dark betwixt lightnings, towards dawn. <lb/>
Well, not a body eat a bite at breakfast that morning. After that <lb/>
the men loafed around, in twos and threes, and talked low together. <lb/>
But none of them herded with Dick Allbright. They all give him <lb/>
the cold shake. If he come around where any of the men was, they <lb/>
split up and sidled away. They would n't man the sweeps with him. <lb/>
The captain had all the skiffs hauled up on the raft, alongside of <lb/>
his wigwam, and would n't let the dead men be took ashore to be <lb/>
planted; he did n't believe a man that got ashore would come back; <lb/>
and he was right.</p>
<pb n="55" entity="DSSR_000002932_0066"/>
<p>"After night come, you could see pretty plain that there was <lb/>
going to be trouble if that bar'l come again; there was such a <lb/>
muttering going on. A good many wanted to kill Dick Allbright, <lb/>
because he'd seen the bar'l on other trips, and that had an ugly <lb/>
look. Some wanted to put him <lb/>
ashore. Some said, let's all go <lb/>
ashore in a pile, if the bar'l <lb/>
comes again.</p>
<p>"This kind of whispers was <lb/>
still going on, the men being <lb/>
bunched together forrard <lb/>
watching for the bar'l, when, <lb/>
lo and behold you, here she <lb/>
comes again. Down she comes, <lb/>
slow and steady, and settles <lb/>
into her old tracks. You could <lb/>
a heard a pin drop. Then up <lb/>
comes the captain, and says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Boys, don't be a pack of <lb/>
children and fools; I don't <lb/>
want this bar'l to be dogging <lb/>
us all the way to Orleans, and <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> don't; well, then, how's <lb/>
the best way to stop it? Burn <lb/>
it up,&mdash;that's the way. I'm <lb/>
going to fetch it aboard,' he <lb/>
says. And before anybody <lb/>
could say a word, in he went.</p>
<p>"He swum to it, and as he <lb/>
come pushing it to the raft, <lb/>
the men spread to one side. <lb/>
But the old man got it aboard <lb/>
and busted in the head, and there was a baby in it! Yes sir, a <lb/>
stark naked baby. It was Dick Allbright's baby; he owned up <lb/>
and said so.</p>
<figure id="f25" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0066">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"the lightning killed two men."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"'Yes,' he says, a-leaning over it, 'yes, it is my own lamented <lb/>
darling, my poor lost Charles William Allbright deceased,' says he, <lb/>
&mdash;for he could curl his tongue around the bulliest words in the <reg orig="lan-|guage">language</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="DSSR_000002932_0067"/>
when he was a mind to, and lay them before you without a <lb/>
jint started, anywheres. Yes, he said he used to live up at the head <lb/>
of this bend, and one night he choked his child, which was crying, <lb/>
not intending to kill it,&mdash;which was prob'ly a lie,&mdash;and then he was <lb/>
scared, and buried it in <lb/>
a bar'l, before his wife <lb/>
got home, and off he <lb/>
went, and struck the <lb/>
northern trail and went <lb/>
to rafting; and this was <lb/>
the third year that the <lb/>
bar'l had chased him. <lb/>
He said the bad luck <reg orig="al-|ways">always</reg> <lb/>
begun light, and <lb/>
lasted till four men was <lb/>
killed, and then the bar'l <lb/>
did n't come any more <lb/>
after that. He said if <lb/>
the men would stand it <lb/>
one more night,&mdash;and <lb/>
was a-going on like that, <lb/>
&mdash;but the men had got <lb/>
enough. They started to <lb/>
get out a boat to take <lb/>
him ashore and lynch <lb/>
him, but he grabbed the <lb/>
little child all of a <reg orig="sud-|den">sudden</reg> <lb/>
and jumped <reg orig="over-|board">overboard</reg> <lb/>

<p>"Why, they hove it overboard, and it sunk like a chunk of <lb/>

<p>"Edward, did the child look like it was choked?" says one.</p>

<p>"Have you got the papers for <lb/>

Jimmy.</p>
<p>"Say, Edwin, was you one of <lb/>
the men that was killed by the <lb/>
lightning?" says Davy.</p>
<p>"Him? O, no, he was both of 'em," says Bob. Then they all <lb/>
haw-hawed.</p>
<p>"Say, Edward, don't you reckon you'd better take a pill? You <lb/>

<p>"O, come, now, Eddy," says Jimmy, "show up; you must a kept <lb/>

<p>"Say, boys," says Bill, "less divide it up. Thar's thirteen of us. <lb/>
I can swaller a thirteenth of the yarn, if you can worry down the <lb/>

<p>Ed got up mad and said <lb/>
they could all go to some <lb/>
place which he <lb/>
ripped out pretty <lb/>
savage, and then <lb/>
walked off aft <lb/>
cussing to himself, <lb/>
and they yelling <lb/>
and jeering at him, and roaring and <lb/>
laughing so you could hear them a <lb/>
mile.</p>
<figure id="f28" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0069">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"who are you?"</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"Boys, we'll split a watermelon <lb/>
on that," says the Child of Calamity; <lb/>
and he come rummaging around in the dark amongst the shingle <lb/>
bundles where I was, and put his hand on me. I was warm and <lb/>
soft and naked; so he says "Ouch!" and jumped back.</p>
<p>"Fetch a lantern or a chunk of fire here, boys&mdash;there's a snake <lb/>
here as big as a cow!"</p>
<p>So they run there with a lantern and crowded up and looked in <lb/>
on me.</p>
<p>"Come out of that, you beggar!" says one.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" says another.</p>
<p>"What are you after here? Speak up prompt, or overboard you <lb/>
go."</p>
<pb n="59" entity="DSSR_000002932_0070"/>
<p>"Snake him out, boys. Snatch him out by the heels."</p>
<p>I began to beg, and crept out amongst them trembling. They <lb/>
looked me over, wondering, and the Child of Calamity says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"A cussed thief! Lend a hand and less heave him overboard!"</p>
<p>"No," says Big Bob, "less get out the paint-pot and paint him <lb/>
a sky blue all over from head to heel, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> heave him over!"</p>
<p>"Good! that's it. Go for the paint, Jimmy."</p>
<p>When the paint come, and Bob took the brush and was just <lb/>
going to begin, the others laughing and rubbing their hands, I begun <lb/>
to cry, and that sort of worked on Davy, and he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Vast there! He's nothing but a cub. I'll paint the man that <lb/>
tetches him!"</p>
<p>So I looked around on them, and some of them grumbled and <lb/>
growled, and Bob put down the paint, and the others did n't take it <lb/>
up.</p>
<p>"Come here to the fire, and less see what you're up to here," <lb/>
says Davy. "Now set down there and give an account of yourself. <lb/>
How long have you been aboard here?"</p>
<p>"Not over a quarter of a minute, sir," says I.</p>
<p>"How did you get dry so quick?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, sir. I'm always that way, mostly."</p>
<p>"Oh, you are, are you? What's your name?"</p>
<p>I war n't going to tell my name. I did n't know what to say, so <lb/>
I just says:</p>
<p>"Charles William Allbright, sir."</p>
<p>Then they roared&mdash;the whole crowd; and I was mighty glad <lb/>
I said that, because maybe laughing would get them in a better <lb/>
humor.</p>
<p>When they got done laughing, Davy says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It won't hardly do, Charles William. You could n't have <lb/>
growed this much in five year, and you was a baby when you come <lb/>
out of the bar'l, you know, and dead at that. Come, now, tell a <lb/>
straight story, and nobody'll hurt you, if you ain't up to anything <lb/>
wrong. What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> your name?"</p>
<p>"Aleck Hopkins, sir. Aleck James Hopkins."</p>
<p>"Well, Aleck, where did you come from, here?"</p>
<p>"From a trading scow. She lays up the bend yonder. I was <lb/>
born on her. Pap has traded up and down here all his life; and he <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="DSSR_000002932_0071"/>
told me to swim off here, because when you went by he said he <lb/>
would like to get some of you to speak to a Mr. Jonas Turner, in <lb/>
Cairo, and tell him&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, come!"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, it's as true as the world; Pap he says&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, your grandmother!"</p>
<p>They all laughed, and I tried again to talk, but they broke in on <lb/>
me and stopped me.</p>
<figure id="f29" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0071">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"charles william allbright, sir."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"Now, looky-here," says Davy; "you're scared, and so you talk <lb/>
wild. Honest, now, do you live in a scow, or is it a lie?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, in a trading scow. She lays up at the head of the <lb/>
bend. But I war n't born in her. It's our first trip."</p>
<p>"Now you're talking! What did you come aboard here, for? <lb/>
To steal?"</p>
<pb n="61" entity="DSSR_000002932_0072"/>
<p>"No, sir, I did n't.&mdash;It was only to get a ride on the raft. All <lb/>
boys does that."</p>
<p>"Well, I know that. But what did you hide for?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes they drive the boys off."</p>
<p>"So they do. They might steal. Looky-here; if we let you off <lb/>
this time, will you keep out of these kind of scrapes hereafter?"</p>
<p>"'Deed I will, boss. You try me."</p>
<p>"All right, then. You ain't but little ways from shore. <reg orig="Over-|board">Overboard</reg> <lb/>
with you, and don't you make a fool of yourself another time <lb/>
this way.&mdash;Blast it, boy, some raftsmen would rawhide you till you <lb/>
were black and blue!"</p>
<p>I did n't wait to kiss good-bye, but went overboard and broke for <lb/>
shore. When Jim come along by and by, the big raft was away out <lb/>
of sight around the point. I swum out and got aboard, and was <lb/>
mighty glad to see home again.</p>
</q>
<p>The boy did not get the information he was after, but his <lb/>
adventure has furnished the glimpse of the departed raftsman <lb/>
and keelboatman which I desire to offer in this place.</p>
<p>I now come to a phase of the Mississippi River life of the <lb/>
flush times of steamboating, which seems to me to warrant <lb/>
full examination&mdash;the marvellous science of piloting, as <reg orig="dis-|played">displayed</reg> <lb/>
there. I believe there has been nothing like it <reg orig="else-|where">elsewhere</reg> <lb/>

 on the <lb/>
west bank of the Mississippi River. That was, to be a <lb/>
steamboatman. We had transient ambitions <lb/>
of other sorts, but they were only transient.
When a circus came and went, it left us all burning to <reg orig="be-|come">become</reg> <lb/>
clowns; the first negro minstrel show that came to our <lb/>
section left us all suffering to try that kind of life; now and <lb/>
<pb n="63" entity="DSSR_000002932_0074"/>
then we had a hope that if we lived and were good, God <lb/>
would permit us to be pirates. These ambitions faded out, <lb/>

<p>Once a day a cheap, gaudy packet arrived upward from <lb/>
St. Louis, and another <reg orig="down-|ward">downward</reg> <lb/>
from Keokuk. Before <lb/>
these events, the day <lb/>
was glorious <lb/>
with expectancy; <lb/>
after them, the <lb/>
day was a dead <lb/>
and empty thing. <lb/>
Not only the <lb/>
boys, but the <lb/>
whole village, <lb/>
felt this. After <lb/>
all these years I <lb/>
can picture that <lb/>
old time to <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg> <lb/>
now, just as <lb/>
it was then: the <lb/>
white town <lb/>
drowsing in the <lb/>
sunshine of a <lb/>
summer's <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>; <lb/>
the streets <lb/>
empty, or pretty <lb/>
nearly so; one or <lb/>
two clerks sitting <lb/>
in front of the Water Street stores, with their splint-<reg orig="bot-|tomed">bottomed</reg> <lb/>
chairs tilted back against the wall, chins on breasts, <lb/>
hats slouched over their faces, asleep&mdash;with shingle-<reg orig="shav-|ings">shavings</reg> <lb/>
enough around to show what broke them down; a <lb/>
sow and a litter of pigs loafing along the sidewalk, doing <lb/>
a good business in watermelon rinds and seeds; two or <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="DSSR_000002932_0075"/>
three lonely little freight piles scattered about the "levee;" <lb/>
a pile of "skids" on the slope of the stone-paved wharf, <lb/>
and the fragrant town drunkard asleep in the shadow of <lb/>
them; two or three wood flats at the head of the wharf, <lb/>
but nobody to listen to the peaceful lapping of the wavelets <lb/>
against them; the great Mississippi, the majestic, the <reg orig="mag-|nificent">magnificent</reg> <lb/>
Mississippi, rolling its mile-wide tide along, shining <lb/>
in the sun; the dense forest away on the other side; the <lb/>
"point" above the town, and the "point" below, bounding <lb/>
the river-glimpse and turning it <lb/>
into a sort of sea, and withal a <lb/>
very still and brilliant and lonely one. Presently a film of <lb/>
dark smoke appears above one of those remote "points;" <lb/>
instantly a negro drayman, famous for his quick eye and <lb/>
prodigious voice, lifts up the cry, "S-t-e-a-m-boat a-comin'!" <lb/>
and the scene changes! The town drunkard stirs, the <lb/>
clerks wake up, a furious clatter of drays follows, every <lb/>
house and store pours out a human contribution, and all</p>
<figure id="f33" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0075">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"all go hurrying <lb/>

<pb n="65" entity="DSSR_000002932_0076"/>
<p>in a twinkling the dead town is alive and moving. Drays, <lb/>
carts, men, boys, all go hurrying from many quarters to <lb/>
a common centre, the wharf. Assembled there, the <reg orig="peo-|ple">people</reg> <lb/>
fasten their eyes upon the coming boat as upon a <reg orig="won-|der">wonder</reg> <lb/>
they are seeing for the first time. And the boat <hi rend="italic">is</hi> <lb/>
rather a handsome sight, too. She is long and sharp and <lb/>
trim and pretty; she has two tall, fancy-topped chimneys, <lb/>
with a gilded device of some kind swung between them; a <lb/>
fanciful pilot-house, all glass and "gingerbread," perched on <lb/>
top of the "texas" deck behind them; the paddle-boxes are <lb/>
gorgeous with a picture or with gilded rays above the boat's <lb/>
name; the boiler deck, the hurricane deck, and the texas <lb/>
deck are fenced and ornamented with clean white railings; <lb/>
there is a flag gallantly flying from the jack-staff; the <reg orig="fur-|nace">furnace</reg> <lb/>
doors are open and the fires glaring bravely; the upper <lb/>
decks are black with passengers; the captain stands by the <lb/>
big bell, calm, imposing, the envy of all; great volumes of <lb/>
the blackest smoke are rolling and tumbling out of the <lb/>
chimneys&mdash;a husbanded grandeur created with a bit of <lb/>
pitch pine just before arriving at a town; the crew are <lb/>
grouped on the forecastle; the broad stage is run far out <lb/>
over the port bow, and an envied deck-hand stands <reg orig="pic-|turesquely">picturesquely</reg> <lb/>
on the end of it with a coil of rope in his hand; <lb/>
the pent steam is screaming through the gauge-cocks; the <lb/>
captain lifts his hand, a bell rings, the wheels stop; then <lb/>
they turn back, churning the water to foam, and the steamer <lb/>
is at rest. Then such a scramble as there is to get aboard, <lb/>
and to get ashore, and to take in freight and to discharge <lb/>
freight, all at one and the same time; and such a yelling <lb/>
and cursing as the mates facilitate it all with! Ten <reg orig="min-|utes">minutes</reg> <lb/>
later the steamer is under way again, with no flag <lb/>
on the jack-staff and no black smoke issuing from the <lb/>
chimneys. After ten more minutes the town is dead <lb/>
again, and the town drunkard asleep by the skids once <lb/>
more.</p>
<p>My father was a justice of the peace, and I supposed he <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="DSSR_000002932_0077"/>
possessed the power of life and death over all men and could <lb/>
hang anybody that offended him. This was distinction <lb/>
enough for me as a general thing; but the desire to be a <lb/>
steamboatman kept intruding, nevertheless. I first wanted <lb/>
to be a cabin-boy, so that I could come out with a white <lb/>
apron on and shake a table-cloth over the side, where all my <lb/>
old comrades could see me; later I thought I would rather <lb/>
be the deck-hand <lb/>
who stood on the <lb/>
end of the <reg orig="stage-|plank">stage-plank</reg> <lb/>
with the coil <lb/>
of rope in his hand, <lb/>
because he was <lb/>
particularly <reg orig="con-|spicuous">conspicuous</reg>. <lb/>
But <lb/>
these were only <lb/>
day-dreams,&mdash;they <lb/>
were too heavenly <lb/>
to be contemplated <lb/>
as real <reg orig="possibili-|ties">possibilities</reg>. <lb/>
By and by <lb/>
one of our boys <lb/>
went away. He <lb/>
was not heard of <lb/>
for a long time. <lb/>
At last he turned <lb/>
up as apprentice <lb/>
engineer or "<reg orig="strik-|er">striker</reg>" <lb/>
on a steamboat. <lb/>
This thing shook the bottom out of all my Sunday-school <lb/>
teachings. That boy had been notoriously worldly, and I <lb/>
just the reverse; yet he was exalted to this eminence, and I <lb/>
left in obscurity and misery. There was nothing generous <lb/>
about this fellow in his greatness. He would always <reg orig="man-|age">manage</reg> <lb/>
to have a rusty bolt to scrub while his boat tarried at <lb/>
our town, and he would sit on the inside guard and scrub</p>
<figure id="f34" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0077">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"the town drunkard asleep once more."</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="67" entity="DSSR_000002932_0078"/>
<p>it, where we could all see him and envy him and loathe <lb/>
him. And whenever his boat was laid up he would come <lb/>
home and swell around the town in his blackest and <reg orig="greas-|iest">greasiest</reg> <lb/>
clothes, so that nobody could help remembering that <lb/>
he was a steamboatman; and he used all sorts of <reg orig="steam-|boat">steamboat</reg> <lb/>
technicalities in his talk, as if he were so used to <lb/>
them that he forgot common people could not understand <lb/>
them. He would speak of the "labboard" side of a horse <lb/>
in an easy, natural way that would make one wish he <lb/>
was dead. And he was always talking about "St. Looy" <lb/>
like an old citizen; he would refer casually to occasions <lb/>
when he "was coming down Fourth Street," or when he was <lb/>
"passing by the Planter's House," or when there was a fire <lb/>
and he took a turn on the brakes of "the old Big Missouri;" <lb/>
and then he would go on and lie about how many towns the <lb/>
size of ours were burned down there that day. Two or three <lb/>
of the boys had long been persons of consideration among <lb/>
us because they had been to St. Louis once and had a vague <lb/>
general knowledge of its wonders, but the day of their glory <lb/>
was over now. They lapsed into a humble silence, and <lb/>
learned to disappear when the ruthless "cub"-engineer <lb/>
approached. This fellow had money, too, and hair oil. <lb/>
Also an ignorant silver watch and a showy brass watch <lb/>
chain. He wore a leather belt and used no suspenders. If <lb/>
ever a youth was cordially admired and hated by his <reg orig="com-|rades">comrades</reg>, <lb/>
this one was. No girl could withstand his charms. <lb/>
He "cut out" every boy in the village. When his boat blew <lb/>
up at last, it diffused a tranquil contentment among us such <lb/>
as we had not known for months. But when he came home <lb/>
the next week, alive, renowned, and appeared in church <lb/>
all battered up and bandaged, a shining hero, stared at and <lb/>
wondered over by everybody, it seemed to us that the <reg orig="par-|tiality">partiality</reg> <lb/>
of Providence for an undeserving reptile had reached <lb/>
a point where it was open to criticism.</p>
<p>This creature's career could produce but one result, and it <lb/>
speedily followed. Boy after boy managed to get on the <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="DSSR_000002932_0079"/>
river. The minister's son became an engineer. The doctor's <lb/>
and the post-master's sons became "mud clerks;" the <lb/>
wholesale liquor dealer's son became a bar-keeper on a boat; <lb/>
four sons of the <lb/>
chief merchant, <lb/>
and two sons of <lb/>
the county judge, <lb/>
became pilots. <lb/>
Pilot was the <lb/>
grandest position <lb/>
of all. The pilot, <lb/>
even in those <lb/>
days of trivial <lb/>
wages, had a <lb/>
princely salary&mdash; <lb/>
from a hundred <lb/>
and fifty to two <lb/>
hundred and fifty <lb/>
dollars a month, <lb/>
and no board to <lb/>
pay. Two months <lb/>
of his wages <lb/>
would pay a <lb/>
preacher's salary <lb/>
for a year. Now <lb/>
some of us were <lb/>
left disconsolate. <lb/>
We could not get <lb/>
on the river&mdash;at <lb/>
least our parents <lb/>
would not let us.</p>

<p>So by and by I <lb/>
ran away. I said I never would come home again till I was <lb/>
a pilot and could come in glory. But somehow I could not <lb/>
manage it. I went meekly aboard a few of the boats that <lb/>
lay packed together like sardines at the long St. Louis <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="DSSR_000002932_0080"/>
wharf, and very humbly inquired for the pilots, but got only <lb/>
a cold shoulder and short words from mates and clerks. <lb/>
I had to make the best of this sort of treatment for the <lb/>
time being, but I had comforting day-dreams of a future <lb/>
when I should be a great and honored pilot, with plenty of <lb/>
money, and could kill some of these mates and clerks and <lb/>
pay for them.</p>

<head>I WANT TO BE A CUB-PILOT.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Months</hi> afterward the hope within me struggled to <lb/>
a reluctant death, and I found myself without an <lb/>
ambition. But I was ashamed to go home. I was in <reg orig="Cincin-|nati">Cincinnati</reg>, <lb/>
and I set to work to map out a new career. I had been <lb/>
reading about the recent exploration of the river Amazon by <lb/>
an expedition sent out by our government. It was said that <lb/>
the expedition, owing to difficulties, had not thoroughly <lb/>
explored a part of the country lying about the head-waters, <lb/>
some four thousand miles from the mouth of the river. It <lb/>
was only about fifteen hundred miles from Cincinnati to New <lb/>
Orleans, where I could doubtless get a ship. I had thirty <lb/>
dollars left; I would go and complete the exploration of the <lb/>
Amazon. This was all the thought I gave to the subject. I <lb/>
never was great in matters of detail. I packed my valise, <lb/>
and took passage on an ancient tub called the "Paul Jones," <lb/>
for New Orleans. For the sum of sixteen dollars I had the <lb/>
scarred and tarnished splendors of "her" main saloon <reg orig="prin-|cipally">principally</reg> <lb/>
to myself, for she was not a creature to attract the eye <lb/>
of wiser travellers.</p>
<p>When we presently got under way and went poking down <lb/>
the broad Ohio, I became a new being, and the subject of my <lb/>
own admiration. I was a traveller! A word never had tasted <lb/>
so good in my mouth before. I had an exultant sense of <lb/>
being bound for mysterious lands and distant climes which <lb/>
I never have felt in so uplifting a degree since. I was in such <lb/>
a glorified condition that all ignoble feelings departed out of <lb/>
<pb n="71" entity="DSSR_000002932_0082"/>
me, and I was able to look down and pity the untravelled with <lb/>
a compassion that had hardly a trace of contempt in it. Still, <lb/>
when we stopped at villages and wood-yards, I could not <lb/>
help lolling carelessly upon the railings of the boiler deck to <lb/>
enjoy the envy of the country boys <lb/>
on the bank. If they did not seem <lb/>
to discover me, I presently sneezed <lb/>
to attract their attention, or moved <lb/>
to a position where they could not <lb/>
help seeing me. And as soon as I <lb/>
knew they saw me I <lb/>
gaped and <reg orig="stretch-|ed">stretched</reg>, <lb/>
and gave <reg orig="oth-|er">other</reg> <lb/>
signs of being <lb/>
mightily bored <lb/>
with travelling.</p>
<figure id="f37" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0082">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"bored with travelling."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>I kept my hat <lb/>
off all the time, <lb/>
and stayed where <lb/>
the wind and the <lb/>
sun could strike <lb/>
me, because I <lb/>
wanted to get the <lb/>
bronzed and <reg orig="wea-|ther-beaten">weather-beaten</reg> <lb/>
look of <lb/>
an old traveller. <lb/>
Before the second <lb/>
day was half gone, <lb/>
I experienced a joy <lb/>
which filled me with the purest gratitude; for I saw that the <lb/>
skin had begun to blister and peel off my face and neck. <lb/>
I wished that the boys and girls at home could see me <lb/>
now.</p>
<p>We reached Louisville in time&mdash;at least the neighborhood <lb/>
of it. We stuck hard and fast on the rocks in the middle of <lb/>
the river, and lay there four days. I was now beginning to <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="DSSR_000002932_0083"/>
feel a strong sense of being a part of the boat's family, a sort <lb/>
of infant son to the captain and younger brother to the <lb/>
officers. There is no estimating the pride I took in this <lb/>
grandeur, or the affection that began to swell and grow in me <lb/>
for those people. I could not know how the lordly <reg orig="steamboat-|man">steamboatman</reg> <lb/>
scorns that sort of presumption in a mere landsman. <lb/>
I particularly longed to acquire the least trifle of notice from <lb/>
the big stormy mate, and I was on the alert for an <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
to do him a service to that end. It came at last. <lb/>
The riotous powwow of setting a spar was going on down <lb/>
on the foreeastle, and I went down there and stood around <lb/>
in the way&mdash;or mostly skipping out of it&mdash;till the mate <lb/>
suddenly roared a general order for somebody to bring him <lb/>
a capstan bar. I sprang to his side and said: "Tell me <lb/>
where it is&mdash;I'll fetch it!"</p>
<p>If a rag-picker had offered to do a diplomatic service for <lb/>
the Emperor of Russia, the monarch could not have been <lb/>
more astounded than the mate was. He even stopped <lb/>
swearing. He stood and stared down at me. It took him <lb/>
ten seconds to scrape his disjointed remains together again. <lb/>
Then he said impressively: "Well, if this don't beat hell!" <lb/>
and turned to his work with the air of a man who had been <lb/>
confronted with a problem too abstruse for solution.</p>
<p>I crept away, and courted solitude for the rest of the day. <lb/>
I did not go to dinner; I stayed away from supper until <lb/>
everybody else had finished. I did not feel so much like a <lb/>
member of the boat's family now as before. However, my <lb/>
spirits returned, in instalments, as we pursued our way down <lb/>
the river. I was sorry I hated the mate so, because it was <lb/>
not in (young) human nature not to admire him. He was <lb/>
huge and muscular, his face was bearded and whiskered all <lb/>
over; he had a red woman and a blue woman tattooed on <lb/>
his right arm,&mdash;one on each side of a blue anchor with <lb/>
a red rope to it; and in the matter of profanity he was <lb/>
sublime. When he was getting out cargo at a landing, I <lb/>
was always where I could see and hear. He felt all the <lb/>

majesty of his great position, and made the world feel it, too. <lb/>
When he gave even the simplest order, he discharged it like <lb/>
a blast of lightning, and sent a long, reverberating peal of <lb/>
profanity thundering after it. I could not help contrasting <lb/>
the way in which the average <lb/>
landsman would give an order, <lb/>
with the mate's way of doing it.</p>
<figure id="f39" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0086">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">sublime in profanity.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>If the landsman should wish the gang-plank moved a foot <lb/>
farther forward, he would probably say: "James, or <reg orig="Wil-|liam">William</reg>, <lb/>
one of you push that plank forward, please;" but put <lb/>
the mate in his place, and he would roar out: "Here, now, <lb/>
start that gang-plank for'ard! Lively, now! <hi rend="italic">What</hi>'re you <lb/>
about! Snatch it! <hi rend="italic">snatch</hi> it! There! there! Aft again! <lb/>

going to <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> over it! '<hi rend="italic">Vast</hi> heaving. 'Vast heaving, I tell <lb/>
you! Going to heave it clear astern? WHERE're you <lb/>

and a crippled hearse-horse!"</p>
<p>I wished I could talk like that.</p>
<p>When the soreness of my adventure with the mate had <lb/>
somewhat worn off, I began timidly to make up to the <reg orig="hum-|blest">humblest</reg> <lb/>
official connected with the boat&mdash;the night watchman. <lb/>
He snubbed my advances at first, but I presently ventured <lb/>
to offer him a new chalk pipe, and that softened him. So <lb/>
he allowed me to sit with him by the big bell on the <reg orig="hurri-|cane">hurricane</reg> <lb/>
deck, and in time he melted into conversation. He <lb/>
could not well have helped it, I hung with such homage on <lb/>
his words and so plainly showed that I felt honored by his <lb/>
notice. He told me the names of dim capes and shadowy <lb/>
islands as we glided by them in the solemnity of the night, <lb/>
under the winking stars, and by and by got to talking about <lb/>
himself. He seemed over-sentimental for a man whose salary <lb/>
was six dollars a week&mdash;or rather he might have seemed so <lb/>
to an older person than I. But I drank in his words <reg orig="hun-|grily">hungrily</reg>, <lb/>
and with a faith that might have moved mountains if <lb/>
it had been applied judiciously. What was it to me that he <lb/>
was soiled and seedy and fragrant with gin? What was it <lb/>
to me that his grammar was bad, his construction worse, <lb/>
and his profanity so void of art that it was an element of <lb/>
weakness rather than strength in his conversation? He was <lb/>
a wronged man, a man who had seen trouble, and that was <lb/>
enough for me. As he mellowed into his plaintive history <lb/>
his tears dripped upon the lantern in his lap, and I cried, <lb/>
too, from sympathy. He said he was the son of an English <lb/>
nobleman&mdash;either an earl or an alderman, he could not <reg orig="re-|member">remember</reg> <lb/>
which, but believed was both; his father, the <reg orig="noble-|man">nobleman</reg>, <lb/>
loved him, but his mother hated him from the cradle; <lb/>
and so while he was still a little boy he was sent to "one of <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="DSSR_000002932_0088"/>
them old, ancient colleges"&mdash;he couldn't remember which; <lb/>
and by and by his father died and his mother seized the <lb/>
property and "shook" him, as he phrased it. After his <lb/>
mother shook him, members of the <lb/>
nobility with whom he was acquainted <lb/>
used their influence to get him the <lb/>
position of "<reg orig="lob-|lolly-boy">lob-lolly-boy</reg> <lb/>
in a ship;" and from that point my watchman <lb/>
threw off all trammels of date and locality and branched out <lb/>
into a narrative that bristled all along with incredible <reg orig="adven-|tures">adventures</reg>; <lb/>
a narrative that was so reeking with bloodshed and so <lb/>
crammed with hair-breadth escapes and the most engaging <lb/>
and unconscious personal villanies, that I sat speechless, <lb/>
enjoying, shuddering, wondering, worshipping.</p>

<p>It was a sore blight to find out afterwards that he was a <lb/>
low, vulgar, ignorant, sentimental, half-witted humbug, an <lb/>
untravelled native of the wilds of Illinois, who had absorbed <lb/>
wildcat literature and appropriated its marvels, until in time <lb/>
he had woven odds and ends of the mess into this yarn, and <lb/>
then gone on telling it to fledglings like me, until he had <lb/>
come to believe it himself.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">What</hi> with lying on the rocks four days at Louisville, <lb/>
and some other delays, the poor old "Paul Jones" <lb/>
fooled away about two weeks in making the voyage from <lb/>
Cincinnati to New Orleans. This gave me a chance to get <lb/>
acquainted with one of the pilots, and he taught me how to <lb/>
steer the boat, and thus made the fascination of river life <lb/>
more potent than ever for me.</p>
<p>It also gave me a chance to get acquainted with a youth <lb/>
who had taken deck passage&mdash;more's the pity; for he <lb/>
easily borrowed six dollars of me on a promise to return to <lb/>
the boat and pay it back to me the day after we should <lb/>
arrive. But he probably died or forgot, for he never came. It <lb/>
was doubtless the former, since he had said his parents were <lb/>
wealthy, and he only travelled deck passage because it was <lb/>
cooler.<ref target="n3" n="3"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>

</p>
<p>I soon discovered two things. One was that a vessel would <lb/>
not be likely to sail for the mouth of the Amazon under ten <lb/>
or twelve years; and the other was that the nine or ten <lb/>
dollars still left in my pocket would not suffice for so <reg orig="impos-|ing">imposing</reg> <lb/>
an exploration as I had planned, even if I could afford <lb/>
to wait for a ship. Therefore it followed that I must <reg orig="con-|trive">contrive</reg> <lb/>
a new career. The "Paul Jones" was now bound for <lb/>
St. Louis. I planned a siege against my pilot, and at the end <lb/>
of three hard days he surrendered. He agreed to teach me <lb/>
the Mississippi River from New Orleans to St. Louis for five <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="DSSR_000002932_0091"/>
hundred dollars, payable out of the first wages I should <lb/>
receive after graduating. I entered upon the small <reg orig="enter-|prise">enterprise</reg> <lb/>
of "learning" twelve or thirteen hundred miles of the <lb/>
great Mississippi River with the easy confidence of my time <lb/>
of life. If I had really known <lb/>
what I was about to require of my <lb/>
faculties, I should not have had <lb/>
the courage to <lb/>
begin. I <reg orig="sup-|posed">supposed</reg> <lb/>
that all <lb/>
a pilot had to <lb/>
do was to keep <lb/>
his boat in the <lb/>
river, and I did <lb/>
not consider <lb/>
that that could <lb/>
be much of a <lb/>
trick, since it <lb/>
was so wide.</p>
<figure id="f42" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0091">

<p>The boat <lb/>
backed out <lb/>
from New <reg orig="Or-|leans">Orleans</reg> <lb/>
at four <lb/>
in the <reg orig="after-|noon">afternoon</reg>, <lb/>
and it <lb/>
was "our <lb/>
watch" until <lb/>
eight. Mr. <lb/>
Bixby, my chief, "<reg orig="straight-|ened">straightened</reg> <lb/>
her up," plowed her <lb/>
along past the sterns of <lb/>
the other boats that lay at <lb/>
the Levee, and then said, "Here, take her; shave those <lb/>
steamships as close as you'd peel an apple." I took the <lb/>
wheel, and my heart-beat fluttered up into the hundreds; <lb/>
for it seemed to me that we were about to scrape the side <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="DSSR_000002932_0092"/>
off every ship in the line, we were so close. I held my <lb/>
breath and began to claw the boat away from the danger; <lb/>
and I had my own opinion of the pilot who had known no <lb/>
better than to get us into such peril, but I was too wise <lb/>
to express it. In half a minute I had a wide margin of <lb/>
safety intervening between the "Paul Jones" and the ships; <lb/>
and within ten seconds more I was set aside in disgrace, <lb/>
and Mr. Bixby was going into danger again and flaying me <lb/>
alive with abuse <lb/>
of my cowardice. <lb/>
I was stung, but <lb/>
I was obliged to <lb/>
admire the easy <lb/>
confidence with <lb/>
which my chief <lb/>
loafed from side <lb/>
to side of his <lb/>
wheel, and <lb/>
trimmed the <lb/>
ships so closely <lb/>
that disaster <lb/>
seemed <reg orig="cease-|lessly">ceaselessly</reg> <lb/>
imminent. <lb/>
When he had <lb/>
cooled a little he <lb/>
told me that the <lb/>
easy water was <lb/>
close ashore and the current outside, and therefore we <lb/>
must hug the bank, up-stream, to get the benefit of the <lb/>
former, and stay well out, down-stream, to take advantage <lb/>
of the latter. In my own mind I resolved to be a <reg orig="down-|stream">downstream</reg> <lb/>
pilot and leave the up-streaming to people dead to <lb/>
prudence.</p>

</figure>
<p>Now and then Mr. Bixby called my attention to certain <lb/>
things. Said he, "This is Six-Mile Point." I assented. It <lb/>
was pleasant enough information, but I could not see the <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="DSSR_000002932_0093"/>
bearing of it. I was not conscious that it was a matter of <lb/>
any interest to me. Another time he said, "This is <reg orig="Nine-|Mile">Nine-Mile</reg> <lb/>
Point." Later he said, "This is Twelve-Mile Point." <lb/>
They were all about level with the water's edge; they all <lb/>
looked about alike to me; they were monotonously <reg orig="unpic-|turesque">unpicturesque</reg>. <lb/>
I hoped Mr. Bixby would change the subject. <lb/>
But no; he would <lb/>
crowd up around a <lb/>
point, hugging the <lb/>
shore with <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg>, <lb/>
and then <lb/>
say: "The <lb/>
slack water <lb/>
ends here, <lb/>
abreast this <lb/>
bunch of <lb/>
China-trees; now we cross over." <lb/>
So he crossed over. He gave me <lb/>
the wheel once or twice, but I had no luck. I either came <lb/>
near chipping off the edge of a sugar plantation, or I yawed <lb/>
too far from shore, and so dropped back into disgrace again <lb/>
and got abused.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">"this is nine-mile <lb/>

</figure>
<p>The watch was ended at last, and we took supper and went <lb/>
to bed. At midnight the glare of a lantern shone in my <lb/>
eyes, and the night watchman said:&mdash;</p>
<pb n="83" entity="DSSR_000002932_0094"/>
<p>"Come! turn out!"</p>
<p>And then he left. I could not understand this <reg orig="extraordi-|nary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
procedure; so I presently gave up trying to, and dozed <lb/>
off to sleep. Pretty soon the watchman was back again, and <lb/>
this time he was gruff. I was annoyed. I said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What do you want to come <lb/>
bothering around here in the middle <lb/>
of the night for? Now as like as not I'll not get to sleep <lb/>
again to-night."</p>
<figure id="f45" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0094">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"come! turn out!"</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>The watchman said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, if this an't good, I'm blest."</p>
<p>The "off-watch" was just turning in, and I heard some <lb/>
brutal laughter from them, and such remarks as "Hello, <lb/>
watchman! an't the new cub turned out yet? He's <reg orig="deli-|cate">delicate</reg>, <lb/>
likely. Give him some sugar in a rag and send for <lb/>

<p>About this time Mr. Bixby appeared on the scene. <reg orig="Some-|thing">Something</reg> <lb/>
like a minute later I was climbing the pilot-house <lb/>
steps with some of my clothes on and the rest in my arms. <lb/>
Mr. Bixby was close behind, commenting. Here was <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="DSSR_000002932_0095"/>
fresh&mdash;this thing of getting up in the middle of the <lb/>
night to go to work. It was a detail in piloting that had <lb/>
never occurred to me at all. I knew that boats ran all <lb/>
night, but somehow I had <lb/>
never happened to reflect <lb/>
that somebody had to get <lb/>
up out of a warm bed to <lb/>
run them. I began to fear <lb/>
that piloting was not quite <lb/>
so romantic as I had <reg orig="imag-|ined">imagined</reg> <lb/>
it was; there was <lb/>
something very real and <lb/>
work-like about this new <lb/>
phase of it.</p>
<figure id="f46" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0095">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"a minute later."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>It was a rather dingy <lb/>
night, although a fair <lb/>
number of stars were out. <lb/>
The big mate was at the <lb/>
wheel, and he had the old <lb/>
tub pointed at a star and <lb/>
was holding her straight <lb/>
up the middle of the river. <lb/>
The shores on either hand <lb/>
were not much more than <lb/>
half a mile apart, but they <lb/>
seemed wonderfully far <lb/>
away and ever so vague <lb/>
and indistinct. The mate <lb/>
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"We've got to land at <lb/>
Jones's plantation, sir."</p>
<p>The vengeful spirit in <lb/>
me exulted. I said to <lb/>
myself, I wish you joy of your job, Mr. Bixby; you'll have <lb/>
a good time finding Mr. Jones's plantation such a night as <lb/>

<p>Mr. Bixby said to the mate:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Upper end of the plantation, or the lower?"</p>
<p>"Upper."</p>
<p>"I can't do it. The stumps there are out of water at this <lb/>
stage. It's no great distance to the lower, and you'll have <lb/>
to get along with that."</p>
<p>"All right, sir. If Jones don't like it he'll have to lump <lb/>
it, I reckon."</p>
<p>And then the mate left. My exultation began to cool <lb/>
and my wonder to come up. Here was a man who not only <lb/>
proposed to find this plantation on such a night, but to find <lb/>
either end of it you preferred. I dreadfully wanted to ask <lb/>
a question, but I was carrying about as many short answers <lb/>
as my cargo-room would admit of, so I held my peace. <lb/>
All I desired to ask Mr. Bixby was the simple question <lb/>
whether he was ass enough to really imagine he was going <lb/>
to find that plantation on a night when all plantations were <lb/>
exactly alike and all the same color. But I held in. I <lb/>
used to have fine inspirations of prudence in those days.</p>
<p>Mr. Bixby made for the shore and soon was scraping it, <lb/>
just the same as if it had been daylight. And not only that, <lb/>
but singing&mdash; <lb/>
<q>"Father in heaven, the day is declining," etc.</q>
It seemed to me that I had put my life in the keeping of a <lb/>
peculiarly reckless outcast. Presently he turned on me and <lb/>
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What's the name of the first point above New Orleans?"</p>
<p>I was gratified to be able to answer promptly, and I did. <lb/>
I said I did n't know.</p>
<p>"Don't <hi rend="italic">know?</hi>"</p>
<p>This manner jolted me. I was down at the foot again, in <lb/>
a moment. But I had to say just what I had said before.</p>
<p>"Well, you're a smart one," said Mr. Bixby. "What's <lb/>
the name of the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> point?"</p>
<p>Once more I did n't know.</p>
<pb n="86" entity="DSSR_000002932_0097"/>
<p>"Well, this beats anything. Tell me the name of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> <lb/>
point or place I told you."</p>
<p>I studied a while and decided that I could n't.</p>
<p>"Look here! What do you start out from, above <reg orig="Twelve-|Mile">Twelve-Mile</reg> <lb/>
Point, to cross over?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;don't know."</p>
<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;don't know?" mimicking my drawling <reg orig="man-|ner">manner</reg> <lb/>
of speech. What <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you know?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;nothing, for certain."</p>
<figure id="f47" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0097">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"you're a smart one."</hi></head>

<p>"By the great C&aelig;lig;sar's ghost, I believe you! You're <lb/>

help me Moses! The idea of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> being a pilot&mdash;<hi rend="italic">you!</hi> <lb/>
Why, you don't know enough to pilot a cow down a <lb/>
lane."</p>
<p>Oh, but his wrath was up! He was a nervous man, and <lb/>
he shuffled from one side of his wheel to the other as if the <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="DSSR_000002932_0098"/>
floor was hot. He would boil a while to himself, and then <lb/>
overflow and scald me again.</p>
<p>"Look here! What do you suppose I told you the names <lb/>
of those points for?"</p>
<p>I tremblingly considered a moment, and then the devil of <lb/>
temptation provoked me to say:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;be entertaining, I thought."</p>

</figure>
<p>This was a red rag to the bull. He raged and stormed so <lb/>
(he was crossing the river at the time) that I judge it made <lb/>
him blind, because he ran over the steering-oar of a <reg orig="trading-|scow">trading-scow</reg>. <lb/>
Of course the <lb/>
traders sent up a volley <lb/>
of red-hot profanity. <lb/>
Never was a <lb/>
man so grateful <lb/>
as Mr. Bixby <lb/>
was: because he <lb/>
was brim full, <lb/>
and here were <lb/>
subjects who <lb/>
would <hi rend="italic">talk back.</hi> <lb/>
He threw open <lb/>
a window, thrust <lb/>
his head out, <lb/>
and such an <reg orig="ir-|ruption">irruption</reg> <lb/>
followed <lb/>
as I never had heard before. The fainter and farther away <lb/>
the scowmen's curses drifted, the higher Mr. Bixby lifted <lb/>
his voice and the weightier his adjectives grew. When he <lb/>
closed the window he was empty. You could have drawn a <lb/>
seine through his system and not caught curses enough to <lb/>
disturb your mother with. Presently he said to me in the <lb/>
gentlest way:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My boy, you must get a little memorandum-book, and <lb/>
every time I tell you a thing, put it down right away. <lb/>
There's only one way to be a pilot, and that is to get this <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="DSSR_000002932_0099"/>
entire river by heart. You have to know it just like <lb/>
A B C."</p>
<p>That was a dismal revelation to me; for my memory was <lb/>
never loaded with anything but blank cartridges. However, <lb/>
I did not feel discouraged long. I judged that it was best to <lb/>
make some allowances, for doubtless Mr. Bixby was "<reg orig="stretch-|ing">stretching</reg>." <lb/>
Presently he pulled a rope and struck a few strokes <lb/>
on the big bell. The stars were all gone now, and the night <lb/>
was as black as ink. I could hear the wheels churn along <lb/>
the bank, but I was not entirely certain that I could see the <lb/>
shore. The voice of the invisible watchman called up from <lb/>
the hurricane deck:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What's this, sir?"</p>
<p>"Jones's plantation."</p>
<p>I said to myself, I wish I might venture to offer a small <lb/>
bet that it is n't. But I did not chirp. I only waited to see. <lb/>
Mr. Bixby handled the engine bells, and in due time the <lb/>
boat's nose came to the land, a torch glowed from the <reg orig="fore-|castle">forecastle</reg>, <lb/>
a man skipped ashore, a darky's voice on the bank <lb/>
said, "Gimme de k'yarpet-bag, Mars' Jones," and the next <lb/>
moment we were standing up the river again, all serene. <lb/>
I reflected deeply a while, and then said,&mdash;but not aloud, <lb/>
&mdash;Well, the finding of that plantation was the luckiest <lb/>
accident that ever happened; but it could n't happen again <lb/>
in a hundred years. And I fully believed it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> an <reg orig="acci-|dent">accident</reg>, <lb/>
too.</p>
<p>By the time we had gone seven or eight hundred miles up <lb/>
the river, I had learned to be a tolerably plucky upstream <lb/>
steersman, in daylight, and before we reached St. Louis I <lb/>
had made a trifle of progress in night-work, but only a trifle. <lb/>
I had a note-book that fairly bristled with the names of <lb/>
towns, "points," bars, islands, bends, reaches, etc.; but the <lb/>
information was to be found only in the note-book&mdash;none <lb/>
of it was in my head. It made my heart ache to think I <lb/>
had only got half of the river set down; for as our watch <lb/>
was four hours off and four hours on, day and night, there <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="DSSR_000002932_0100"/>
was a long four-hour gap in my book for every time I had <lb/>
slept since the voyage began.</p>
<figure id="f49" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0100">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"a sumptuous temple."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>My chief was presently hired to go on a big New Orleans <lb/>
boat, <lb/>
and I <lb/>
packed <lb/>
my satchel <lb/>
and went with him. She <lb/>
was a grand affair. When I stood <lb/>
in her pilot-house I was so far <lb/>
above the water that I seemed <lb/>
perched on a mountain; and her <lb/>
decks stretched so far away, fore <lb/>
and aft, below me, that I wondered <lb/>
how I could ever have considered the little "Paul Jones" a <lb/>
large craft. There were other differences, too. The "Paul <lb/>
Jones's" pilot-house was a cheap, dingy, battered rattle-trap, <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="DSSR_000002932_0101"/>
cramped for room: but here was a sumptuous glass temple; <lb/>
room enough to have a dance in; showy red and gold <reg orig="window-|curtains">window-curtains</reg>; <lb/>
an imposing sofa; leather cushions and a back to <lb/>
the high bench where visiting pilots sit, to spin yarns and <lb/>
"look at the river; "bright, fanciful" cuspadores "instead <lb/>
of a broad wooden box filled with sawdust; nice new <reg orig="oil-|cloth">oilcloth</reg> <lb/>
on the floor; a hospitable big stove for winter; a wheel <lb/>
as high as my head, costly with inlaid work; a wire <reg orig="tiller-|rope">tiller-rope</reg>; <lb/>
bright brass knobs for the bells; and a tidy, <reg orig="white-|aproned">white-aproned</reg>, <lb/>
black "texas-tender," to bring up tarts and ices and <lb/>
coffee during mid-watch, day and night. Now this was "<reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
like;" and so I began to take heart once more to <lb/>
believe that piloting was a romantic sort of occupation after <lb/>
all. The moment we were under way 1 began to prowl <lb/>
about the great steamer and fill myself with joy. She was <lb/>
as clean and as dainty as a drawing-room; when I looked <lb/>
down her long, gilded saloon, it was like gazing through a <lb/>
splendid tunnel; she had an oil-picture, by some gifted <reg orig="sign-|painter">sign-painter</reg>, <lb/>
on every state-room door; she glittered with no end <lb/>
of prism-fringed chandeliers; the clerk's office was elegant, <lb/>
the bar was marvellous, and the bar-keeper had been <reg orig="bar-|bered">barbered</reg> <lb/>
and upholstered at incredible cost. The boiler deck <lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the second story of the boat, so to speak), was as <reg orig="spa-|cious">spacious</reg> <lb/>
as a church, it seemed to me; so with the forecastle; <lb/>
and there was no pitiful handful of deck-hands, firemen, and <lb/>
roust-abouts down there, but a whole battalion of men. The <lb/>
fires were fiercely glaring from a long row of furnaces, and <lb/>
over them were eight huge boilers! This was unutterable <lb/>
pomp. The mighty engines&mdash;but enough of this. I had <lb/>
never felt so fine before. And when I found that the <reg orig="regi-|ment">regiment</reg> <lb/>
of natty servants respectfully "sir'd" me, my <reg orig="satisfac-|tion">satisfaction</reg> <lb/>
was complete.</p>

<head>A DARING DEED.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> I returned to the pilot-house St. Louis was gone <lb/>
and I was lost. Here was a piece of river which was <lb/>
all down in my book, but I could make neither head nor tail <lb/>
of it: you understand, it was turned around. I had seen it <lb/>
when coming up-stream, but I had never faced about to see <lb/>
how it looked when it was behind me. My heart broke <lb/>
again, for it was plain that I had got to learn this <reg orig="trouble-|some">troublesome</reg> <lb/>
river <hi rend="italic">both ways.</hi></p>
<p>The pilot-house was full of pilots, going down to "look at <lb/>
the river." What is called the "upper river" (the two <lb/>
hundred miles between St. Louis and Cairo, where the Ohio <lb/>
comes in) was low; and the Mississippi changes its channel <lb/>
so constantly that the pilots used to always find it necessary <lb/>
to run down to Cairo to take a fresh look, when their boats <lb/>
were to lie in port a week; that is, when the water was at a <lb/>
low stage. A deal of this "looking at the river" was done <lb/>
by poor fellows who seldom had a berth, and whose only <lb/>
hope of getting one lay in their being always freshly posted <lb/>
and therefore ready to drop into the shoes of some reputable <lb/>
pilot, for a single trip, on account of such pilot's sudden <lb/>
illness, or some other necessity. And a good many of them <lb/>
constantly ran up and down inspecting the river, not because <lb/>
they ever really hoped to get a berth, but because (they <lb/>
being guests of the boat) it was cheaper to "look at the <lb/>
river" than stay ashore and pay board. In time these <lb/>
fellows grew dainty in their tastes, and only infested boats <lb/>
that had an established reputation for setting good tables. <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="DSSR_000002932_0103"/>
All visiting pilots were useful, for they were always ready <lb/>
and willing, winter or summer, night or day, to go out in the <lb/>
yawl and help buoy the channel or assist the boat's pilots <lb/>
in any way they could. They were likewise welcome <lb/>
because all pilots are tireless <reg orig="talk-|ers">talkers</reg>, <lb/>
when gathered together, and <lb/>
as they talk only about the river <lb/>
they are always understood and are always interesting. Your <lb/>
true pilot cares nothing about anything on earth but the river, <lb/>
and his pride in his occupation surpasses the pride of kings.</p>
<figure id="f50" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0103">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"river inspectors."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>We had a fine company of these river-inspectors along, <lb/>
this trip. There were eight or ten; and there was <reg orig="abun-|dance">abundance</reg> <lb/>
of room for them in our great pilot-house. Two or <lb/>
three of them wore polished silk hats, elaborate shirt-fronts, <lb/>
diamond breastpins, kid gloves, and patent-leather boots. <lb/>
They were choice in their English, and bore themselves with <lb/>
a dignity proper to men of solid means and prodigious <lb/>
reputation as pilots. The others were more or less loosely <lb/>
clad, and wore upon their heads tall felt cones that were <lb/>
suggestive of the days of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>I was a cipher in this august company, and felt subdued, <lb/>
not to say torpid. I was not even of sufficient consequence <lb/>
to assist at the wheel when it was necessary to put the tiller <lb/>
<pb n="93" entity="DSSR_000002932_0104"/>
hard down in a hurry; the guest that stood nearest did that <lb/>
when occasion required&mdash;and this was pretty much all the <lb/>
time, because of the crookedness of the channel and the <lb/>
scant water. I stood in a corner; and the talk I listened <lb/>
to took the hope all out of me. One visitor said to <lb/>
another:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Jim, how did you run Plum Point, coming up?"</p>
<p>"It was in the night, there, and I ran it the way one of <lb/>
the boys on the 'Diana' told me; started out about fifty <lb/>
yards above the wood pile on the false point, and held on the <lb/>
cabin under Plum Point till I raised the reef&mdash;quarter less <lb/>
twain&mdash;then straightened up for the middle bar till I got <lb/>
well abreast the old one-limbed cotton-wood in the bend, <lb/>
then got my stern on the cotton-wood and head on the low <lb/>
place above the point, and came through a-booming&mdash;nine <lb/>
and a half."</p>
<p>"Pretty square crossing, an't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but the upper bar's working down fast."</p>
<p>Another pilot spoke up and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I had better water than that, and ran it lower down; <lb/>
started out from the false point&mdash;mark twain&mdash;raised the <lb/>
second reef abreast the big snag in the bend, and had <lb/>
quarter less twain."</p>
<p>One of the gorgeous ones remarked:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I don't want to find fault with your leadsmen, but that's <lb/>
a good deal of water for Plum Point, it seems to me."</p>
<p>There was an approving nod all around as this quiet snub <lb/>
dropped on the boaster and "settled" him. And so they <lb/>
went on talk-talk-talking. Meantime, the thing that was <lb/>
running in my mind was, "Now if my ears hear aright, I <lb/>
have not only to get the names of all the towns and islands <lb/>
and bends, and so on, by heart, but I must even get up a <lb/>
warm personal acquaintanceship with every old snag and <lb/>
one-limbed cotton-wood and obscure wood pile that <reg orig="orna-|ments">ornaments</reg> <lb/>
the banks of this river for twelve hundred miles; and <lb/>
more than that, I must actually know where these things <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="DSSR_000002932_0105"/>
are in the dark, unless these guests are gifted with eyes that <lb/>
can pierce through two miles of solid blackness; I wish the <lb/>
piloting business was in Jericho and I had never thought <lb/>
of it."</p>
<p>At dusk Mr. Bixby tapped the big bell three times (the <lb/>
signal to land), and the captain emerged from his <reg orig="drawing-|room">drawing-room</reg> <lb/>
in the forward end of the <lb/>
texas, and looked up inquiringly. <lb/>
Mr. Bixby said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"We will lay up here all night, <lb/>
captain."</p>
<p>"Very well, sir."</p>
<figure id="f51" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0105">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"a tangled knot."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>That was all. The boat came <lb/>
to shore and was tied up for the <lb/>
night. It seemed to me a fine <lb/>
thing that the pilot could do as <lb/>
he pleased, without asking so <lb/>
grand a captain's permission. <lb/>
I took my supper and went <reg orig="im-|mediately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
to bed, discouraged by <lb/>
my day's observations and <reg orig="ex-|periences">experiences</reg>. <lb/>
My late voyage's <lb/>
note-booking was but a confusion <lb/>
of meaningless names. It had <lb/>
tangled me all up in a knot <lb/>
every time I had looked at it in the daytime. I now hoped <lb/>
for respite in sleep; but no, it revelled all through my head <lb/>
till sunrise again, a frantic and tireless nightmare.</p>
<p>Next morning I felt pretty rusty and low-spirited. We <lb/>
went booming along, taking a good many chances, for we <lb/>
were anxious to "get out of the river" (as getting out to <lb/>
Cairo was called) before night should overtake us. But Mr. <lb/>
Bixby's partner, the other pilot, presently grounded the boat, <lb/>
and we lost so much time getting her off that it was plain <lb/>
the darkness would overtake us a good long way above the <lb/>
mouth. This was a great misfortune, especially to certain <lb/>
<pb n="95" entity="DSSR_000002932_0106"/>
of our visiting pilots, whose boats would have to wait for <lb/>
their return, no matter how long that might be. It sobered <lb/>
the pilot-house talk a good deal. Coming up-stream, pilots <lb/>
did not mind low water or any kind of darkness; nothing <lb/>
stopped them but fog. But down-stream work was different; <lb/>
a boat was too nearly helpless, with a stiff current pushing <lb/>
behind her; so it was not customary to run down-stream at <lb/>
night in low water.</p>
<p>There seemed to be one small hope, however: if we could <lb/>
get through the intricate and dangerous Hat Island crossing <lb/>
before night, we could venture the rest, for we would have <lb/>
plainer sailing and better water. But it would be insanity <lb/>
to attempt Hat Island at night. So there was a deal of <lb/>
looking at watches all the rest of the day, and a constant <lb/>
ciphering upon the speed we were making; Hat Island was <lb/>
the eternal subject; sometimes hope was high and sometimes <lb/>
we were delayed in a bad crossing, and down it went again. <lb/>
For hours all hands lay under the burden of this suppressed <lb/>
excitement; it was even communicated to me, and I got to <lb/>
feeling so solicitous about Hat Island, and under such an <lb/>
awful pressure of responsibility, that I wished I might have <lb/>
five minutes on shore to draw a good, full, relieving breath, <lb/>
and start over again. We were standing no regular watches. <lb/>
Each of our pilots ran such portions of the river as he had <lb/>
run when coming up-stream, because of his greater <reg orig="familiar-|ity">familiarity</reg> <lb/>
with it; but both remained in the pilot-house constantly.</p>
<p>An hour before sunset, Mr. Bixby took the wheel and Mr. <lb/>
W&mdash;&mdash; stepped aside. For the next thirty minutes every <lb/>
man held his watch in his hand and was restless, silent, and <lb/>
uneasy. At last somebody said, with a doomful sigh,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well yonder's Hat Island&mdash;and we can't make it."</p>
<p>All the watches closed with a snap, everybody sighed and <lb/>
muttered something about its being "too bad, too bad&mdash;ah, <lb/>
if we could <hi rend="italic">only</hi> have got here half an hour sooner!" and <lb/>
the place was thick with the atmosphere of disappointment. <lb/>
Some started to go out, but loitered, hearing no bell-tap to <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="DSSR_000002932_0107"/>
land. The sun dipped behind the horizon, the boat went <lb/>
on. Inquiring looks passed from one guest to another; and <lb/>
one who had his hand on the door-knob and had turned it, <lb/>
waited, then presently took away his hand and let the knob <lb/>
turn back again. We bore steadily down the bend. More <lb/>
looks were exchanged, and nods <lb/>
of surprised admiration&mdash;but <lb/>
no words. Insensibly the men <lb/>
drew together behind Mr. Bixby, as the sky darkened and one <lb/>
or two dim stars came out. The dead silence and sense of <lb/>
waiting became oppressive. Mr. Bixby pulled the cord, and <lb/>
two deep, mellow notes from the big bell floated off on the <lb/>
night. Then a pause, and one more note was struck. The <lb/>
watchman's voice followed, from the hurricane deck:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Labboard lead, there! Stabboard lead!"</p>
<figure id="f52" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0107">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"insensibly they drew together."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>The cries of the leadsmen began to rise out of the <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg>, <lb/>
and were gruffly repeated by the word-passers on the <lb/>
hurricane deck.</p>
<p>"M-a-r-k three!....M-a-r-k three!....Quarter-<reg orig="less-|three!....Half">lessthree!....Half</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="97" entity="DSSR_000002932_0108"/>
twain!....Quarter twain!....M-a-r-k <lb/>
twain!....Quarter-less"&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Bixby pulled two bell-ropes, and was answered by <lb/>
faint jinglings far below in the engine room, and our speed <lb/>
slackened. The steam began to whistle through the <reg orig="gauge-|cocks">gauge-cocks</reg>. <lb/>
The cries of the leadsmen went on&mdash;and it is a <lb/>
weird sound, always, in the night. Every pilot in the lot <lb/>
was watching now, with fixed eyes, and talking under his <lb/>
breath. Nobody was calm and easy but Mr. Bixby. He <lb/>
would put his wheel down and stand on a spoke, and as the <lb/>
steamer swung into her (to me) utterly invisible marks&mdash; <lb/>
for we seemed to be in the midst of a wide and gloomy sea <lb/>
&mdash;he would meet and fasten her there. Out of the murmur <lb/>
of half-audible talk, one caught a coherent sentence now and <lb/>
then&mdash;such as:</p>
<p>"There; she's over the first reef all right!"</p>
<p>After a pause, another subdued voice:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Her stern's coming down just <hi rend="italic">exactly</hi> right, by <hi rend="italic">George!"</hi></p>
<p>"Now she's in the marks; over she goes!"</p>
<p>Somebody else muttered:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Oh, it was done beautiful&mdash;<hi rend="italic">beautiful!"</hi></p>
<p>Now the engines were stopped altogether, and we drifted <lb/>
with the current. Not that I could see the boat drift, for <lb/>
I could not, the stars being all gone by this time. This <lb/>
drifting was the dismalest work; it held one's heart still. <lb/>
Presently I discovered a blacker gloom than that which <lb/>
surrounded us. It was the head of the island. We were <lb/>
closing right down upon it. We entered its deeper shadow, <lb/>
and so imminent seemed the peril that I was likely to <reg orig="suffo-|cate">suffocate</reg>; <lb/>
and I had the strongest impulse to do <hi rend="italic">something,</hi> <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg>, <lb/>
to save the vessel. But still Mr. Bixby stood by his <lb/>
wheel, silent, intent as a cat, and all the pilots stood shoulder <lb/>
to shoulder at his back.</p>
<p>"She'll not make it!" somebody whispered.</p>
<p>The water grew shoaler and shoaler, by the leadsman's <lb/>
cries, till it was down to&mdash;</p>
<pb n="98" entity="DSSR_000002932_0109"/>
<p>"Eight-and-a-half!....E-i-g-h-t feet!....E-i-g-h-t feet! <lb/>

<p>Mr. Bixby said warningly through his speaking tube to <lb/>
the engineer:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Stand by, <lb/>
now!"</p>
<p>"Aye-aye, sir!"</p>
<p>"Seven-and-<reg orig="a-|half">a-half</reg>! <lb/>

Mr. Bixby set <lb/>
a lot of bells <reg orig="ring-|ing">ringing</reg>, <lb/>
shouted <lb/>
through the tube, <lb/>

partner," Put her <lb/>

The boat rasped <lb/>
and ground her <lb/>
way through the <lb/>
sand, hung upon the apex of disaster a single tremendous <lb/>
instant, and then over she went! And such a shout as went <lb/>
up at Mr. Bixby's back never loosened the roof of a <reg orig="pilot-|house">pilothouse</reg> <lb/>
before!</p>

<p>There was no more trouble after that. Mr. Bixby was a <lb/>
hero that night; and it was some little time, too, before his <lb/>
exploit ceased to be talked about by river men.</p>
<p>Fully to realize the marvellous precision required in laying <lb/>
the great steamer in her marks in that murky waste of <lb/>
water, one should know that not only must she pick her <lb/>

intricate way through snags and blind reefs, and then shave <lb/>
the head of the island so closely as to brush the overhanging <lb/>
foliage with her stern, but at one place she must pass almost <lb/>
within arm's reach of a sunken and invisible wreck that <lb/>
would snatch the hull timbers from under her if she should <lb/>
strike it, and destroy a quarter of a million dollars' worth <lb/>
of steamboat and cargo in five minutes, and maybe a <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
and fifty human lives into the bargain.</p>
<p>The last remark I heard that night was a compliment to <lb/>
Mr. Bixby, uttered in soliloquy and with unction by one of <lb/>
our guests. He said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"By the Shadow of Death, but he's a lightning pilot!"</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">At</hi> the end of what seemed a tedious while, I had <reg orig="man-|aged">managed</reg> <lb/>
to pack my head full of islands, towns, bars, <lb/>
"points," and bends; and a curiously inanimate mass of <lb/>
lumber it was, too. However, inasmuch as I could shut <lb/>
my eyes <lb/>
and reel <lb/>
off a good <lb/>
long string <lb/>
of these <lb/>
names <lb/>
without <lb/>
leaving out <lb/>
more than <lb/>
ten miles <lb/>
of river in <lb/>
every fifty, <lb/>
I began to <lb/>
feel that I <lb/>
could take <lb/>
a boat <lb/>
down to <lb/>
New <reg orig="Or-|leans">Orleans</reg> <lb/>
if I <lb/>
could make her skip those little gaps. But of course my <lb/>
complacency could hardly get start enough to lift my nose a <lb/>
trifle into the air, before Mr. Bixby would think of <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="103" entity="DSSR_000002932_0114"/>
to fetch it down again. One day he turned on me <lb/>
suddenly with this settler:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What is the shape of Walnut Bend?"</p>
<p>He might as well have asked me my grandmother's <reg orig="opin-|ion">opinion</reg> <lb/>
of protoplasm. I reflected respectfully, and then said I <lb/>
did n't know it had any particular shape. My gunpowdery <lb/>
chief went off with a bang, of course, and then went on <lb/>
loading and firing until he was out of adjectives.</p>
<p>I had learned long ago that he only carried just so many <lb/>
rounds of ammunition, and was sure to subside into a very <lb/>
placable and even remorseful old smooth-bore as soon as <lb/>
they were all gone. That word "old" is merely affectionate; <lb/>
he was not more than thirty-four. I waited. By and by he <lb/>
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"My boy, you've got to know the <hi rend="italic">shape</hi> of the river <lb/>
perfectly. It is all there is left to steer by on a very dark <lb/>
night. Everything else is blotted out and gone. But mind <lb/>
you, it has n't the same shape in the night that it has in the <lb/>
day-time."</p>
<p>"How on earth am I ever going to learn it, then?"</p>
<p>"How do you follow a hall at home in the dark? <reg orig="Be-|cause">Because</reg> <lb/>
you know the shape of it. You can't see it."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say that I've got to know all the million <lb/>
trifling variations of shape in the banks of this interminable <lb/>
river as well as I know the shape of the front hall at home?"</p>
<p>"On my honor, you've got to know them <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than any <lb/>
man ever did know the shapes of the halls in his own house."</p>
<p>"I wish I was dead!"</p>
<p>"Now I don't want to discourage you, but"&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, pile it on me; I might as well have it now as <lb/>
another time."</p>
<p>"You see, this has got to be learned; there is n't any <lb/>
getting around it. A clear starlight night throws such heavy <lb/>
shadows that if you did n't know the shape of a shore <reg orig="per-|fectly">perfectly</reg> <lb/>
you would claw away from every bunch of timber, <lb/>
because you would take the black shadow of it for a solid <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="DSSR_000002932_0115"/>
cape; and you see you would be getting scared to death every <lb/>
fifteen minutes by the watch. You would be fifty yards from <lb/>
shore all the time when you ought to be within fifty feet of it. <lb/>
You can't see a snag in one of those shadows, but you know <lb/>
exactly where it is, and the shape of the river tells you when <lb/>
you are coming to it. Then there's your pitch-dark night; <lb/>
the river is a very different shape on a pitch-dark night <lb/>
from what it is on a starlight night. All shores seem to be <lb/>
straight lines, then, and mighty dim ones, too; and you'd <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">run</hi> them for straight lines only you know better. You <lb/>
boldly drive your boat right into what seems to be a solid, <lb/>
straight wall (you knowing very well that in reality there is <lb/>
a curve there), and that wall falls back and makes way for <lb/>
you. Then there's your gray mist. You take a night when <lb/>
there's one of these grisly, drizzly, gray mists, and then <lb/>
there is n't <hi rend="italic">any</hi> particular shape to a shore. A gray mist <lb/>
would tangle the head of the oldest man that ever lived. <lb/>
Well, then, different kinds of <hi rend="italic">moonlight</hi> change the shape of <lb/>
the river in different ways. You see"&mdash;</p>
<p>"Oh, don't say any more, please! Have I got to learn <lb/>
the shape of the river according to all these five hundred <lb/>
thousand different ways? If I tried to carry all that cargo <lb/>
in my head it would make me stoop-shouldered."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">No!</hi> you only learn <hi rend="italic">the</hi> shape of the river; and you <lb/>
learn it with such absolute certainty that you can always <lb/>
steer by the shape that's <hi rend="italic">in your head,</hi> and never mind the <lb/>
one that's before your eyes."</p>
<p>"Very well, I'll try it; but after I have learned it can I <lb/>
depend on it? Will it keep the same form and not go <reg orig="fool-|ing">fooling</reg> <lb/>
around?"</p>
<p>Before Mr. Bixby could answer, Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; came in to <lb/>
take the watch, and he said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Bixby, you'll have to look out for President's Island <lb/>
and all that country clear away up above the Old Hen and <lb/>
Chickens. The banks are caving and the shape of the shores <lb/>
changing like everything. Why, you would n't know the <lb/>
<pb n="105" entity="DSSR_000002932_0116"/>
point above 40. You can go up inside the old sycamore <lb/>

<note id="n4" place="foot" n="4"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>It may not be necessary, but still it can do no harm to explain that <lb/>

<figure id="f57" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0116">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"changing watch."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>So that question was answered. <lb/>
Here were leagues of shore <reg orig="chang-|ing">changing</reg> <lb/>
shape. My spirits were down <lb/>
in the mud again. Two things <lb/>
seemed pretty apparent to me. <lb/>
One was, that in order to be a <lb/>
pilot a man had got to learn more <lb/>
than any one man ought to be <lb/>
allowed to know; and the other <lb/>
was, that he must learn it all over <lb/>
again in a different way every <lb/>
twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>That night we had the watch until twelve. Now it was an <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="DSSR_000002932_0117"/>
ancient river custom for the two pilots to chat a bit when <lb/>
the watch changed. While the relieving pilot put on his <lb/>
gloves and lit his cigar, his partner, the retiring pilot, <lb/>
would say something like this:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I judge the upper bar is making down a little at Hale's <lb/>
Point; had quarter twain with the lower lead and mark <lb/>
twain<ref target="n5" n="5"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
<note id="n5" place="foot" n="5"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>Two fathoms. Quarter twain is 2&frac14; fathoms, 13&frac12; feet. Mark three is <lb/>
three fathoms.</p></note>
 with the other."</p>
<p>"Yes, I thought it was making down a little, last trip. <lb/>
Meet any boats?"</p>
<p>"Met one abreast the head of 21, but she was away over <lb/>
hugging the bar, and I could n't make her out entirely. I <lb/>
took her for the 'Sunny South'&mdash;had n't any skylights <lb/>
forward of the chimneys."</p>
<p>And so on. And as the relieving pilot took the wheel his <lb/>
partner<ref target="n6" n="6"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>
<note id="n6" place="foot" n="6"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">2</hi></seg><p>"Partner" is technical for "the other pilot."</p></note>
 would mention that we were in such-and-such a <lb/>
bend, and say we were abreast of such-and-such a man's <lb/>
wood-yard or plantation. This was courtesy; I supposed it <lb/>
was <hi rend="italic">necessity.</hi> But Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; came on watch full twelve <lb/>
minutes late on this particular night,&mdash;a tremendous breach <lb/>
of etiquette; in fact, it is the unpardonable sin among pilots. <lb/>
So Mr. Bixby gave him no greeting whatever, but simply <lb/>
surrendered the wheel and marched out of the pilot-house <lb/>
without a word. I was appalled; it was a villanous night <lb/>
for blackness, we were in a particularly wide and blind part <lb/>
of the river, where there was no shape or substance to <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg>, <lb/>
and it seemed incredible that Mr. Bixby should have <lb/>
left that poor fellow to kill the boat trying to find out where <lb/>
he was. But I resolved that I would stand by him any way. <lb/>
He should find that he was not wholly friendless. So I <lb/>
stood around, and waited to be asked where we were. But <lb/>
Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; plunged on serenely through the solid firmament <lb/>
of black cats that stood for an atmosphere, and never opened <lb/>
his mouth. Here is a proud devil, thought I; here is a limb <lb/>
<pb n="107" entity="DSSR_000002932_0118"/>
of Satan that would rather send us all to destruction than <lb/>
put himself under obligations to me, because I am not yet <lb/>
one of the salt of the earth and privileged to snub captains <lb/>
and lord it over everything dead and alive in a steamboat. <lb/>
I presently climbed up on the bench; I did not think it was <lb/>
safe to go to sleep while this lunatic was on watch.</p>
<p>However, I must have gone to sleep in the course of time, <lb/>
because the <lb/>
next thing I <lb/>
was aware <lb/>
of was the <lb/>
fact that <lb/>
day was <lb/>
breaking, <lb/>
Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; <lb/>
gone, and <lb/>
Mr. Bixby at <lb/>
the wheel <lb/>
again. So it <lb/>
was four <reg orig="o'-|clock">o'clock</reg> <lb/>
and all <lb/>
well&mdash;but <lb/>
me; I felt <lb/>
like a <reg orig="skin-|ful">skinful</reg> <lb/>
of dry <lb/>
bones and all of them <reg orig="try-|ing">trying</reg> <lb/>
to ache at once.</p>
<figure id="f58" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0118">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"all well&mdash;but me."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Mr. Bixby asked me <lb/>
What I had stayed up <lb/>
there for. I confessed that it <lb/>
was to do Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; a <reg orig="benev-|olence,&mdash;tell">benevolence,&mdash;tell</reg> <lb/>
him where he was. <lb/>
It took five minutes for the entire <lb/>
preposterousness of the thing to <lb/>
filter into Mr. Bixby's system, and <lb/>
then I judge it filled him nearly up to the chin; because he <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="DSSR_000002932_0119"/>
paid me a compliment&mdash;and not much of a one either. <lb/>
He said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, taking you by-and-large, you do seem to be more <lb/>
different kinds of an ass than any creature I ever saw before. <lb/>
What did you suppose he wanted to know for?"</p>
<q>I said I thought it might be a convenience to him.</q>
<p>"Convenience! D-nation! Did n't I tell you that a man's <lb/>
got to know the river in the night the same as he'd know <lb/>
his own front hall?"</p>
<p>"Well, I can follow the front hall in the dark if I know <lb/>
it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the front hall; but suppose you set me down in the <lb/>
middle of it in the dark and not tell me which hall it is; <lb/>
how am <hi rend="italic">I</hi> to know?"</p>
<p>"Well, you've <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to, on the river!"</p>
<p>"All right. Then I'm glad I never said anything to <lb/>
Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I should say so. Why, he'd have slammed you through <lb/>
the window and utterly ruined a hundred dollars' worth of <lb/>
window-sash and stuff."</p>
<p>I was glad this damage had been saved, for it would have <lb/>
made me unpopular with the owners. They always hated <lb/>
anybody who had the name of being careless, and injuring <lb/>
things.</p>
<p>I went to work now to learn the shape of the river; and <lb/>
of all the eluding and ungraspable objects that ever I tried <lb/>
to get mind or hands on, that was the chief. I would fasten <lb/>
my eyes upon a sharp, wooded point that projected far into <lb/>
the river some miles ahead of me, and go to laboriously <lb/>
photographing its shape upon my brain; and just as I was <lb/>
beginning to succeed to my satisfaction, we would draw up <lb/>
toward it and the exasperating thing would begin to melt <lb/>
away and fold back into the bank! If there had been a <lb/>
conspicuous dead tree standing upon the very point of the <lb/>
cape, I would find that tree inconspicuously merged into the <lb/>
general forest, and occupying the middle of a straight shore, <lb/>
when I got abreast of it! No prominent hill would stick to <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="DSSR_000002932_0120"/>
its shape long enough for me to make up my mind what its <lb/>
form really was, but it was as dissolving and changeful as <lb/>
if it had been a mountain of butter in the hottest corner of <lb/>
the tropics. Nothing ever had the same shape when I was <lb/>
coming down-stream that <lb/>
it had borne when I went <lb/>
up. I mentioned these little <lb/>
difficulties to Mr. Bixby. He said,&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f59" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0120">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"learning the river."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"That's the very main virtue of the thing. If the shapes <lb/>
did n't change every three seconds they would n't be of any <lb/>
use. Take this place where we are now, for instance. As <lb/>
long as that hill over yonder is only one hill, I can boom <lb/>
right along the way I'm going; but the moment it splits at <lb/>
the top and forms a V, I know I've got to scratch to <reg orig="star-|board">starboard</reg> <lb/>
in a hurry, or I'll bang this boat's brains out against <lb/>
a rock; and then the moment one of the prongs of the V <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="DSSR_000002932_0121"/>
swings behind the other, I've got to waltz to larboard again, <lb/>
or I'll have a misunderstanding with a snag that would <lb/>
snatch the keelson out of this steamboat as neatly as if it <lb/>
were a sliver in your hand. If that hill did n't change its <lb/>
shape on bad nights there would be an awful steamboat <lb/>
grave-yard around here inside of a year."</p>
<p>It was plain that I had got to learn the shape of the river <lb/>
in all the different ways that could be thought of,&mdash;upside <lb/>
down, wrong end first, inside out, fore-and-aft, and "<reg orig='thort-|ships,"&mdash;and'>thortships,"&mdash;and</reg> <lb/>
then know what to do on gray nights when it <lb/>
had n't any shape at all. So I set about it. In the course <lb/>
of time I began to get the best of this knotty lesson, and <lb/>
my self-complacency moved to the front once more. Mr. <lb/>
Bixby was all fixed, and ready to start it to the rear again. <lb/>
He opened on me after this fashion:&mdash;</p>
<p>"How much water did we have in the middle crossing at <lb/>
Hole-in-the-Wall, trip before last?"</p>
<p>I considered this an outrage. I said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Every trip, down and up, the leadsmen are singing <lb/>
through that tangled place for three quarters of an hour on <lb/>
a stretch. How do you reckon I can remember such a mess <lb/>
as that?"</p>
<p>"My boy, you've got to remember it. You've got to <lb/>
remember the exact spot and the exact marks the boat lay <lb/>
in when we had the shoalest water, in every one of the five <lb/>
hundred shoal places between St. Louis and New Orleans; <lb/>
and you must n't get the shoal soundings and marks of one <lb/>
trip mixed up with the shoal soundings and marks of another, <lb/>
either, for they're not often twice alike. You must keep <lb/>
them separate."</p>
<p>When I came to myself again, I said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"When I get so that I can do that, I'll be able to raise <lb/>
the dead, and then I won't have to pilot a steamboat to make <lb/>
a living. I want to retire from this business. I want a <lb/>
slush-bucket and a brush; I'm only fit for a roustabout. I <lb/>
haven't got brains enough to be a pilot; and if I had I <lb/>
<pb n="111" entity="DSSR_000002932_0122"/>
would n't have strength enough to carry them around, unless <lb/>
I went on crutches."</p>
<p>"Now drop that! When I say I'll learn<ref target="n7" n="7"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>

<head>CONTINUED PERPLEXITIES.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">There</hi> was no use in arguing with a person like this. <lb/>
I promptly put such a strain on my memory that by <lb/>
and by even the shoal water and the countless crossing-marks <lb/>
began to stay with me. But the result was just the same. I <lb/>
never could more than get one knotty thing learned before <lb/>
another presented itself. Now I had often seen pilots <reg orig="gaz-|ing">gazing</reg> <lb/>
at the water and pretending to read it as if it were a <lb/>
book; but it was a book that told me nothing. A time <lb/>
came at last, however, when Mr. Bixby seemed to think me <lb/>
far enough advanced to bear a lesson on water-reading. So <lb/>
he began:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Do you see that long slanting line on the face of the <lb/>
water? Now, that's a reef. Moreover, it's a bluff reef. <lb/>
There is a solid sand-bar under it that is nearly as straight <lb/>
up and down as the side of a house. There is plenty of <lb/>
water close up to it, but mighty little on top of it. If you <lb/>
were to hit it you would knock the boat's brains out. Do <lb/>
you see where the line fringes out at the upper end and <lb/>
begins to fade away?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Well, that is a low place; that is the head of the reef. <lb/>
You can climb over there, and not hurt anything. Cross <lb/>
over, now, and follow along close under the reef&mdash;easy <lb/>
water there&mdash;not much current."</p>
<p>I followed the reef along till I approached the fringed end. <lb/>
Then Mr. Bixby said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Now get ready. Wait till I give the word. She won't <lb/>
want to mount the reef; a boat hates shoal water. Stand <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="DSSR_000002932_0124"/>
by&mdash;wait&mdash;<hi rend="italic">wait</hi>&mdash;keep her well in hand. <hi rend="italic">Now</hi> cramp her <lb/>
down! Snatch her! snatch her!"</p>
<p>He seized the other side of the wheel and helped to spin <lb/>
it around until it was hard down, and then we held it so. <lb/>
The boat resisted, and refused to answer for a while, and <lb/>
next she came surging to starboard, mounted the reef, and <lb/>
sent a long, angry ridge of water foaming away from her <lb/>
bows.</p>
<figure id="f61" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0124">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"that's a reef."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"Now watch her; watch her like a cat, or she'll get <lb/>
away from you. When she fights strong and the tiller slips <lb/>
a little, in a jerky, greasy sort of way, let up on her a trifle; <lb/>
it is the way she tells you at night that the water is too <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="DSSR_000002932_0125"/>
shoal; but keep edging her up, little by little, toward the <lb/>
point. You are well up on the bar, now; there is a <lb/>
bar under every <lb/>
point, because the <lb/>
water that comes down around <lb/>
it forms an eddy and allows <lb/>
the sediment to sink. Do you <lb/>
see those fine lines on the <lb/>
face of the water that branch <lb/>
out like the ribs of a fan? Well, those are little reefs; <lb/>
you want to just miss the ends of them, but run them <lb/>
pretty close. Now look out&mdash;look out! Don't you crowd</p>
<figure id="f62" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0125">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"set her back."</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="115" entity="DSSR_000002932_0126"/>
<p>that slick, greasy-looking place; there ain't nine feet there; <lb/>
she won't stand it. She begins to smell it; look sharp, I tell <lb/>
you! Oh blazes, there you go! Stop the starboard wheel! <lb/>
Quick! Ship up to back! Set her back!"</p>
<p>The engine bells jingled and the engines answered promptly, <lb/>
shooting white columns of steam far aloft out of the 'scape <lb/>
pipes, but it was too late. The boat had "smelt" the bar in <lb/>
good earnest; the foamy ridges that radiated from her bows <lb/>
suddenly disappeared, a great dead swell came rolling <reg orig="for-|ward">forward</reg> <lb/>
and swept ahead of her, she careened far over to <reg orig="lar-|board">larboard</reg>, <lb/>
and went tearing away toward the other shore as if <lb/>
she were about scared to death. We were a good mile from <lb/>
where we ought to have been, when we finally got the upper <lb/>
hand of her again.</p>
<p>During the afternoon watch the next day, Mr. Bixby asked <lb/>
me if I knew how to run the next few miles. I said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Go inside the first snag above the point, outside the next <lb/>
one, start out from the lower end of Higgins's wood-yard, <lb/>
make a square crossing and"&mdash;</p>
<p>"That's all right. I'll be back before you close up on <lb/>
the next point."</p>
<p>But he was n't. He was still below when I rounded it and <lb/>
entered upon a piece of river which I had some misgivings <lb/>
about. I did not know that he was hiding behind a chimney <lb/>
to see how I would perform. I went gayly along, getting <lb/>
prouder and prouder, for he had never left the boat in my <lb/>
sole charge such a length of time before. I even got to <lb/>
"setting" her and letting the wheel go, entirely, while I <lb/>
vaingloriously turned my back and inspected the stern marks <lb/>
and hummed a tune, a sort of easy indifference which I had <lb/>
prodigiously admired in Bixby and other great pilots. Once <lb/>
I inspected rather long, and when I faced to the front again <lb/>
my heart flew into my mouth so suddenly that if I had n't <lb/>
clapped my teeth together I should have lost it. One of <lb/>
those frightful bluff reefs was stretching its deadly length <lb/>
right across our bows! My head was gone in a moment; I <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="DSSR_000002932_0127"/>
did not know which end I stood on; I gasped and could not <lb/>
get my breath; I spun the wheel down with such rapidity <lb/>
that it wove itself together like a spider's web; the boat <lb/>
answered and turned square away from the reef, but the reef <lb/>
followed her! I fled, and still it followed still it kept&mdash; <lb/>
right across my bows! I never looked to see where I was <lb/>
going, I only fled. The awful crash was imminent&mdash;why <lb/>
did n't that villain come! If I committed the crime of <reg orig="ring-|ing">ringing</reg> <lb/>
a bell, I might get thrown overboard. But better that <lb/>
than kill the boat. So in blind desperation I started such a <lb/>
rattling "shivaree" down below as never had astounded an <lb/>
engineer in this world before, I fancy. Amidst the frenzy of <lb/>
the bells the engines began to back and fill in a furious way, <lb/>
and my reason forsook its throne&mdash;we were about to crash <lb/>
into the woods on the other side of the river. Just then Mr. <lb/>
Bixby stepped calmly into view on the hurricane deck. My <lb/>
soul went out to him in gratitude. My distress vanished; I <lb/>
would have felt safe on the brink of Niagara, with Mr. Bixby <lb/>
on the hurricane deck. He blandly and sweetly took his <lb/>
tooth-pick out of his mouth between his fingers, as if it were <lb/>
a cigar,&mdash;we were just in the act of climbing an <reg orig="overhang-|ing">overhanging</reg> <lb/>
big tree, and the passengers were scudding astern like <lb/>
rats,&mdash;and lifted up these commands to me ever so <lb/>
gently:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Stop the starboard. Stop the larboard. Set her back <lb/>
on both."</p>
<p>The boat hesitated, halted, pressed her nose among the <lb/>
boughs a critical instant, then reluctantly began to back <lb/>
away.</p>
<p>"Stop the larboard. Come ahead on it. Stop the <reg orig="star-|board">starboard</reg>. <lb/>
Come ahead on it. Point her for the bar."</p>
<p>I sailed away as serenely as a summer's morning. Mr. <lb/>
Bixby came in and said, with mock simplicity,&mdash;</p>
<p>"When you have a hail, my boy, you ought to tap the big <lb/>
bell three times before you land, so that the engineers can <lb/>
get ready."</p>
<pb n="117" entity="DSSR_000002932_0128"/>
<p>I blushed under the sarcasm, and said I had n't had any hail.</p>
<p>"Ah! Then it was for wood, I suppose. The officer of <lb/>
the watch will <lb/>
tell you when <lb/>
he wants to <lb/>
wood up."</p>
<figure id="f63" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0128">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">mr. b. stepped into view.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>I went on <reg orig="con-|suming">consuming</reg>, <lb/>
and <lb/>
said I was n't <reg orig="af-|ter">after</reg> <lb/>
wood.</p>
<p>"Indeed? <lb/>
Why, what could <lb/>
you want over <lb/>
here in the bend, <lb/>
then? Did you <lb/>
ever know of a <lb/>
boat following <lb/>
a bend up-stream <lb/>
at this stage of the river?"</p>
<p>"No, sir,&mdash;and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was n't <reg orig="try-|ing">trying</reg> <lb/>
to follow it. I was getting <lb/>
away from a bluff reef."</p>
<p>"No, it was n't a bluff reef; <lb/>
there isn't one within three <lb/>
miles of where you were."</p>
<p>"But I saw it. It was as bluff <lb/>
as that one yonder."</p>
<p>"Just about. Run over it!"</p>
<p>"Do you give it as an order?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Run over it."</p>
<p>"If I don't, I wish I may die."</p>
<p>"All right; I am taking the <lb/>
responsibility."</p>
<p>I was just as anxious to kill the <lb/>
boat, now, as I had been to save <lb/>
her before. I impressed my orders upon my memory, to be <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="DSSR_000002932_0129"/>
used at the inquest, and made a straight break for the reef. <lb/>
As it disappeared under our bows I held my breath; but we <lb/>
slid over it like oil.</p>
<p>"Now don't you see the difference? It was n't anything <lb/>
but a <hi rend="italic">wind</hi> reef. The wind does that."</p>
<p>"So I see. But it is exactly like a bluff reef. How am I <lb/>
ever going to tell them apart?"</p>
<p>"I can't tell you. It is an instinct. By and by you will <lb/>
just naturally <hi rend="italic">know</hi> one from the other, but you never will be <lb/>
able to explain why or how you know them apart."</p>
<p>It turned out to be true. The face of the water, in time, <lb/>
became a wonderful book&mdash;a book that was a dead language <lb/>
to the uneducated passenger, but which told its mind to me <lb/>
without reserve, delivering its most cherished secrets as <lb/>
clearly as if it uttered them with a voice. And it was not a <lb/>
book to be read once and thrown aside, for it had a new <lb/>
story to tell every day. Throughout the long twelve <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
miles there was never a page that was void of interest, <lb/>
never one that you could leave unread without loss, never <lb/>
one that you would want to skip, thinking you could find <lb/>
higher enjoyment in some other thing. There never was so <lb/>
wonderful a book written by man; never one whose interest <lb/>
was so absorbing, so unflagging, so sparklingly renewed <lb/>
with every re-perusal. The passenger who could not read it <lb/>
was charmed with a peculiar sort of faint dimple on its <reg orig="sur-|face">surface</reg> <lb/>
(on the rare occasions when he did not overlook it <lb/>
altogether); but to the pilot that was an <hi rend="italic">italicized</hi> passage; <lb/>
indeed, it was more than that, it was a legend of the largest <lb/>
capitals, with a string of shouting exclamation points at the <lb/>
end of it; for it meant that a wreck or a rock was buried there <lb/>
that could tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever <lb/>
floated. It is the faintest and simplest expression the <lb/>
water ever makes, and the most hideous to a pilot's eye. <lb/>
In truth, the passenger who could not read this book saw <lb/>
nothing but all manner of pretty pictures in it, painted by <lb/>
the sun and shaded by the clouds, whereas to the trained eye <lb/>
<pb n="119" entity="DSSR_000002932_0130"/>
these were not pictures at all, but the grimmest and most <lb/>
dead-earnest of reading-matter.</p>
<p>Now when I had mastered the language of this water and <lb/>
had come to know every trifling feature that bordered the <lb/>
great river as familiarly as I knew the letters of the <reg orig="alpha-|bet">alphabet</reg>, <lb/>
I had made a valuable acquisition. But I had lost <lb/>
something, too. I had lost something which could never be <lb/>
restored to me while I lived. All the grace, the beauty, the <lb/>
poetry had gone out of the majestic river! I still keep in <lb/>
mind a certain wonderful sunset which I witnessed when <lb/>
steamboating was new to me. A broad expanse of the river <lb/>
was turned to blood; in the middle distance the red hue <lb/>
brightened into gold, through which a solitary log came <lb/>
floating, black and conspicuous; in one place a long, slanting <lb/>
mark lay sparkling upon the water; in another the surface <lb/>
was broken by boiling, tumbling rings, that were as <reg orig="many-|tinted">many-tinted</reg> <lb/>
as an opal; where the ruddy flush was faintest, was a <lb/>
smooth spot that was covered with graceful circles and <reg orig="radi-|ating">radiating</reg> <lb/>
lines, ever so delicately traced; the shore on our left <lb/>
was densely wooded, and the sombre shadow that fell from <lb/>
this forest was broken in one place by a long, ruffled trail <lb/>
that shone like silver; and high above the forest wall a <lb/>
clean-stemmed dead tree waved a single leafy bough that <lb/>
glowed like a flame in the unobstructed splendor that was <lb/>
flowing from the sun. There were graceful curves, reflected <lb/>
images, woody heights, soft distances; and over the whole <lb/>
scene, far and near, the dissolving lights drifted steadily, <lb/>
enriching it, every passing moment, with new marvels of <lb/>
coloring.</p>
<p>I stood like one bewitched. I drank it in, in a speechless <lb/>
rapture. The world was new to me, and I had never seen <lb/>
anything like this at home. But as I have said, a day came <lb/>
when I began to cease from noting the glories and the charms <lb/>
which the moon and the sun and the twilight wrought upon <lb/>
the river's face; another day came when I ceased altogether <lb/>
to note them. Then, if that sunset scene had beeen <reg orig="re-|peated">repeated</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="DSSR_000002932_0131"/>
I should have looked upon it without rapture, and <lb/>
should have commented upon it, inwardly, after this fashion: <lb/>
This sun means that we are going to have wind to-morrow; <lb/>
that floating log means that the river is rising, small thanks <lb/>
to it; that slanting mark on the water refers to a bluff reef <lb/>
which is going to kill somebody's steamboat one of these <lb/>
nights, if it keeps on stretching out like that; those <reg orig="tum-|bling">tumbling</reg> <lb/>
"boils" show a dissolving <lb/>
bar and a changing channel <lb/>
there; the lines and circles in <lb/>
the slick water over yonder are <lb/>
a warning that that troublesome <lb/>
place is shoaling up dangerously; <lb/>
that silver streak in the shadow of the forest is the "break" <lb/>
from a new snag, and he has located himself in the very best <lb/>
place he could have found to fish for steamboats; that tall <lb/>
dead tree, with a single living branch, is not going to last <lb/>
long, and then how is a body ever going to get through this <lb/>
blind place at night without the friendly old landmark?</p>
<figure id="f64" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0131">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"i stood like one bewitched."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>No, the romance and the beauty were all gone from the <lb/>
river. All the value any feature of it had for me now was <lb/>
<pb n="121" entity="DSSR_000002932_0132"/>
the amount of usefulness it could furnish toward compassing <lb/>
the safe piloting of a steamboat. Since those days, I have <lb/>
pitied doctors from my heart. What does the lovely flush in <lb/>
a beauty's cheek mean to a doctor but a "break" that <reg orig="rip-|ples">ripples</reg> <lb/>
above some deadly disease? Are not all her visible <lb/>
charms sown thick with what are to him the signs and <reg orig="sym-|bols">symbols</reg> <lb/>
of hidden decay? Does he ever see her beauty at all, <lb/>
or does n't he simply view her professionally, and comment <lb/>
upon her unwholesome condition all to himself? And does n't <lb/>
he sometimes wonder whether he has gained most or lost <lb/>
most by learning his trade?</p>

<head>COMPLETING MY EDUCATION.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Whosoever</hi> has done me the courtesy to read my <lb/>
chapters which have preceded this may possibly <lb/>
wonder that I deal so minutely with piloting as a science. <lb/>
It was the prime purpose of those chapters; and I am not <lb/>
quite done yet. I wish to show, in the most patient and <lb/>
painstaking way, what a wonderful science it is. Ship <lb/>
channels are buoyed and lighted, and therefore it is a <reg orig="com-|paratively">comparatively</reg> <lb/>
easy undertaking to learn to run them; <reg orig="clear-|water">clearwater</reg> <lb/>
rivers, with gravel bottoms, change their channels <lb/>
very gradually, and therefore one needs to learn them but <lb/>
once; but piloting becomes another matter when you apply <lb/>
it to vast streams like the Mississippi and the Missouri, <lb/>
whose alluvial banks cave and change constantly, whose <lb/>
snags are always hunting up new quarters, whose <reg orig="sand-|bars">sandbars</reg> <lb/>
are never at rest, whose channels are forever dodging <lb/>
and shirking, and whose obstructions must be confronted <lb/>
in all nights and all weathers without the aid of a single <lb/>
light-house or a single buoy; for there is neither light nor <lb/>
buoy to be found anywhere in all this three or four thousand <lb/>
miles of villanous river.<ref target="n8" n="8"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
<note id="n8" place="foot" n="8"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>True at the time referred to; not true now (1882).</p></note>
 I feel justified in enlarging upon <lb/>
this great science for the reason that I feel sure no one has <lb/>
ever yet written a paragraph about it who had piloted a <lb/>
steamboat himself, and so had a practical knowledge of the <lb/>
subject. If the theme were hackneyed, I should be obliged <lb/>
to deal gently with the reader; but since it is wholly new, <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="DSSR_000002932_0134"/>
I have felt at liberty to take up a considerable degree of <lb/>
room with it.</p>
<p>When I had learned the name and position of every visible <lb/>
feature of the river; when I had so mastered its shape that <lb/>
I could shut my eyes and trace it from St. Louis to New <lb/>
Orleans; when I had learned to read the face of the water <lb/>
as one would cull the news from the morning paper; and <lb/>
finally, when I had trained my dull memory to treasure up <lb/>
an endless array of soundings and crossing-marks, and keep <lb/>
fast hold of them, I judged that my education was complete: <lb/>
so I got to tilting my cap <lb/>
to the side of my head, <lb/>
and wearing a toothpick <lb/>
in my mouth at the <lb/>
wheel. Mr. Bixby had <lb/>
his eye on these airs. <lb/>
One day he said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"What is the height <lb/>
of that bank yonder, at <lb/>
Burgess's?"</p>
<p>"How can I tell, sir? <lb/>
It is three quarters of a <lb/>
mile away."</p>
<p>"Very poor eye&mdash;very poor. Take the <lb/>
glass."</p>
<figure id="f66" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0134">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"wearing a toothpick."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>I took the glass, and <lb/>
presently said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"I can't tell. I suppose that that bank is about a foot <lb/>
and a half high."</p>
<p>"Foot and a half! That's a six-foot bank. How high <lb/>
was the bank along here last trip?"</p>
<p>"I don't know; I never noticed."</p>
<p>"You did n't? Well, you must always do it hereafter."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because you'll have to know a good many things that <lb/>
<pb n="124" entity="DSSR_000002932_0135"/>
it tells you. For one thing, it tells you the stage of the <lb/>
river&mdash;tells you whether there's more water or less in <lb/>
the river along here than there was last trip."</p>
<p>"The leads tell me that." I rather thought I had the <lb/>
advantage of him there.</p>
<p>"Yes, but suppose the leads lie? The bank would tell <lb/>
you so, and then you'd stir those leadsmen up a bit. There <lb/>
was a ten-foot bank here last trip, and there is only a <reg orig="six-|foot">six-foot</reg> <lb/>
bank now. What does that signify?"</p>
<p>"That the river is four feet higher than it was last trip."</p>
<p>"Very good. Is <lb/>
the river rising or <lb/>
falling?"</p>
<p>"Rising."</p>
<p>"No it ain't."</p>
<p>"I guess I am <lb/>
right, sir. <reg orig="Yon-|der">Yonder</reg> <lb/>
is some <reg orig="drift-|wood">driftwood</reg> <lb/>
floating <lb/>
down the stream."</p>
<p>"A rise <hi rend="italic">starts</hi> <lb/>
the drift-wood, but <lb/>
then it keeps on <lb/>
floating a while <lb/>
after the river is <lb/>
done rising. Now <lb/>
the bank will tell <lb/>
you about this. <lb/>
Wait till you come <lb/>
to a place where it <lb/>
shelves a little. Now here; do you see this narrow belt of <lb/>
fine sediment? That was deposited while the water was <lb/>
higher. You see the drift-wood begins to strand, too. The <lb/>
bank helps in other ways. Do you see that stump on the <lb/>
false point?"</p>
<figure id="f67" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0135">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"do you see that <lb/>
stump?"</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"Ay, ay, sir."</p>
<pb n="125" entity="DSSR_000002932_0136"/>
<p>"Well, the water is just up to the roots of it. You must <lb/>
make a note of that."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because that means that there's seven feet in the chute <lb/>
of 103."</p>
<p>"But 103 is a long way up the river yet."</p>
<p>"That's where the benefit of the bank comes in. There <lb/>
is water enough in 103 <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> yet there may not be by the <lb/>
time we get there; but the bank will keep us posted all <lb/>
along. You don't run close chutes on a falling river, <reg orig="up-|stream">upstream</reg>, <lb/>
and there are precious few of them that you are <lb/>
allowed to run at all down-stream. There's a law of the <lb/>
United States against it. The river may be rising by the <lb/>
time we get to 103, and in that case we'll run it. We are <lb/>
drawing&mdash;how much?"</p>
<p>"Six feet aft,&mdash;six and a half forward."</p>
<p>"Well, you do seem to know something."</p>
<p>"But what I particularly want to know is, if I have got to <lb/>
keep up an everlasting measuring of the banks of this river, <lb/>
twelve hundred miles, month in and month out?"</p>
<p>"Of course!"</p>
<p>My emotions were too deep for words for a while. <reg orig="Pres-|ently">Presently</reg> <lb/>
I said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"And how about these chutes? Are there many of <lb/>
them?"</p>
<p>"I should say so. I fancy we shan't run any of the river <lb/>
this trip as you've ever seen it run before&mdash;so to speak. <lb/>
If the river begins to rise again, we'll go up behind bars <lb/>
that you've always seen standing out of the river, high and <lb/>
dry like the roof of a house; we'll cut across low places <lb/>
that you've never noticed at all, right through the middle of <lb/>
bars that cover three hundred acres of river; we'll creep <lb/>
through cracks where you've always thought was solid land; <lb/>
we'll dart through the woods and leave twenty-five miles of <lb/>
river off to one side; we'll see the hind-side of every island <lb/>
between New Orleans and Cairo."</p>
<pb n="126" entity="DSSR_000002932_0137"/>
<p>"Then I've got to go to work and learn just as much <lb/>
more river as I already know."</p>
<p>"Just about twice as much more, as near as you can come <lb/>
at it."</p>
<p>"Well, one lives to find out. I think I was a fool when <lb/>
I went into this business."</p>
<p>"Yes, that is true. And you are yet. But you'll not be <lb/>
when you've learned it."</p>
<p>"Ah, I never can learn it."</p>
<p>"I will see that you <hi rend="italic">do.</hi>"</p>
<p>By and by I ventured again:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Have I got to learn all this thing just as I know the rest of <lb/>
the river&mdash;shapes and all&mdash;and so I can run it at night?"</p>
<p>"Yes. And you've got to have good fair marks from one <lb/>
end of the river to the other, that will help the bank tell you <lb/>
when there is water enough in each of these countless places, <lb/>
&mdash;like that stump, you know. When the river first begins <lb/>
to rise, you can run half a dozen of the deepest of them; <lb/>
when it rises a foot more you can run another dozen; the <lb/>
next foot will add a couple of dozen, and so on: so you see <lb/>
you have to know your banks and marks to a dead moral <lb/>
certainty, and never get them mixed; for when you start <lb/>
through one of those cracks, there's no backing out again, <lb/>
as there is in the big river; you've got to go through, or <lb/>
stay there six months if you get caught on a falling river. <lb/>
There are about fifty of these cracks which you can't run at <lb/>
all except when the river is brim full and over the banks."</p>
<p>"This new lesson is a cheerful prospect."</p>
<p>"Cheerful enough. And mind what I've just told you; <lb/>
when you start into one of those places you've got to go <lb/>
through. They are too narrow to turn around in, too <lb/>
crooked to back out of, and the shoal water is always <hi rend="italic">up <lb/>
at the head;</hi> never elsewhere. And the head of them is <lb/>
always likely to be filling up, little by little, so that the <lb/>
marks you reckon their depth by, this season, may not <lb/>
answer for next."</p>

</figure>
<p>The next few months showed me strange things. On the <lb/>
same day that we held the conversation above narrated, we <lb/>
met a great rise coming down the river. The whole vast <lb/>
face of the stream was black with drifting dead logs, broken <lb/>
boughs, and great trees that had caved in and been washed <lb/>
away. It required the nicest steering to pick one's way <lb/>
through this rushing raft, even <lb/>
in the day-time, when crossing <lb/>
from point to point; and at night <lb/>
the difficulty was mightily <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg>; <lb/>
every now and then <lb/>
a huge log, lying deep in the <lb/>
water, would suddenly appear <lb/>
right under our bows, coming head-on; no use to try to <lb/>
avoid it then; we could only stop the engines, and one <lb/>
wheel would walk over that log from one end to the other, <lb/>
keeping up a thundering racket and careening the boat in a <lb/>
way that was very uncomfortable to passengers. Now and <lb/>
then we would hit one of these sunken logs a rattling bang, <lb/>
dead in the centre, with a full head of steam, and it would <lb/>
stun the boat as if she had hit a continent. Sometimes this <lb/>
log would lodge, and stay right across our nose, and back the <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="DSSR_000002932_0141"/>
Mississippi up before it; we would have to do a little <reg orig="craw-|fishing">crawfishing</reg>, <lb/>
then, to get away from the obstruction. We often <lb/>
hit <hi rend="italic">white</hi> logs, in the dark, for we could not see them till <lb/>
we were right on them; but a black log is a pretty <reg orig="dis-|tinct">distinct</reg> <lb/>
object at night. A white snag is an ugly customer <lb/>
when the daylight is gone.</p>
<p>Of course, on the great rise, down came a swarm of <reg orig="pro-|digious">prodigious</reg> <lb/>
timber-rafts from the head waters of the <reg orig="Missis-|sippi">Mississippi</reg>, <lb/>
coal barges from Pittsburgh, little trading scows from <lb/>
everywhere, and broad-horns from "Posey County," Indiana, <lb/>
freighted with "fruit and furniture"&mdash;the usual term for <lb/>
describing it, though in plain English the freight thus <reg orig="aggran-|dized">aggrandized</reg> <lb/>
was hoop-poles and pumpkins. Pilots bore a mortal <lb/>
hatred to these craft; and it was returned with usury. The <lb/>
law required all such helpless traders to keep a light <reg orig="burn-|ing">burning</reg>, <lb/>
but it was a law that was often broken. All of a sudden, <lb/>
on a murky night, a light would hop up, right under our <lb/>
bows, almost, and an agonized voice, with the backwoods <lb/>
"whang" to it, would wail out:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Whar'n the &mdash;&mdash; you goin' to! Cain't you see nothin', <lb/>
you dash-dashed aig-suckin', sheep-stealin', one-eyed son of <lb/>
a stuffed monkey!"</p>
<p>Then for an instant, as we whistled by, the red glare <lb/>
from our furnaces would reveal the scow and the form of <lb/>
the gesticulating orator as if under a lightning-flash, and <lb/>
in that instant our firemen and deck-hands would send <lb/>
and receive a tempest of missiles and profanity, one of our <lb/>
wheels would walk off with the crashing fragments of a <lb/>
steering-oar, and down the dead blackness would shut again. <lb/>
And that flatboatman would be sure to go into New Orleans <lb/>
and sue our boat, swearing stoutly that he had a light <reg orig="burn-|ing">burning</reg> <lb/>
all the time, when in truth his gang had the lantern down <lb/>
below to sing and lie and drink and gamble by, and no watch <lb/>
on deck. Once, at night, in one of those forest-bordered <lb/>

we should have eaten up a Posey County family, fruit, <reg orig="fur-|niture">furniture</reg>, <lb/>

for a moment. These <lb/>
people brought up their <lb/>
lantern, then, of course; <lb/>
and as we backed and filled <lb/>
to get away, the precious <lb/>
family stood in the light of it&mdash;both sexes and various ages <lb/>

<head>THE RIVER RISES.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">During</hi> this big rise these small-fry craft were an <lb/>
intolerable nuisance. We were running chute after <lb/>
chute,&mdash;a new world to me,&mdash;and if there was a <reg orig="particu-|larly">particularly</reg> <lb/>
cramped place in a chute, we would be pretty sure to <lb/>
meet a broad-horn there; and if he failed to be there, we <lb/>
would find him in a still worse locality, namely, the head <lb/>
of the chute, on the shoal water. And then there would be <lb/>
no end of profane cordialities exchanged.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in the big river, when we would be feeling our <lb/>
way cautiously along through a fog, the deep hush would <lb/>
suddenly be broken by yells and a clamor of tin pans, and <lb/>
all in an instant a log raft would appear vaguely through the <lb/>
webby veil, close upon us; and then we did not wait to swap <lb/>
knives, but snatched our engine bells out by the roots and <lb/>
piled on all the steam we had, to scramble out of the way! <lb/>
One doesn't hit a rock or a solid log raft with a steamboat <lb/>
when he can get excused.</p>
<p>You will hardly believe it, but many steamboat clerks <lb/>
always carried a large assortment of religious tracts with <lb/>
them in those old departed steamboating days. Indeed they <lb/>
did. Twenty times a day we would be cramping up around <lb/>
a bar, while a string of these small-fry rascals were drifting <lb/>
down into the head of the bend away above and beyond us a <lb/>
couple of miles. Now a skiff would dart away from one of <lb/>
them, and come fighting its laborious way across the desert of <lb/>
water. It would "ease all," in the shadow of our forecastle, <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="DSSR_000002932_0144"/>
and the panting oarsmen would shout, "Gimme a pa-a-per!" <lb/>
as the skiff drifted swiftly astern. The clerk would throw <lb/>
over a file of New Orleans journals. If these were picked up <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">without comment,</hi> you might notice that now a dozen other <lb/>
skiffs had been drifting down upon us without saying <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg>. <lb/>
You understand, they <lb/>
had been waiting to see how <lb/>
No. 1 was going to fare. No. 1 <lb/>
making no comment, all the rest would bend to their oars <lb/>
and come on, now; and as fast as they came the clerk would <lb/>
heave over neat bundles of religious tracts, tied to shingles. <lb/>
The amount of hard swearing which twelve packages of <reg orig="reli-|gious">religious</reg> <lb/>
literature will command when impartially divided up <lb/>
among twelve raftsmen's crews, who have pulled a heavy skiff <lb/>
two miles on a hot day to get them, is simply incredible.</p>

<p>As I have said, the big rise brought a new world under my <lb/>
vision. By the time the river was over its banks we had <lb/>
forsaken our old paths and were hourly climbing over bars <lb/>
that had stood ten feet out of water before; we were shaving <lb/>
stumpy shores, like that at the foot of Madrid Bend, which <lb/>
I had always seen avoided before; we were clattering through <lb/>
chutes like that of 82, where the opening at the foot was an <lb/>
unbroken wall of timber till our nose was almost at the very <lb/>
spot. Some of these chutes were utter solitudes. The dense, <lb/>
untouched forest overhung both banks of the crooked little <lb/>
crack, and one could believe that human creatures had never <lb/>
intruded there before. The swinging grape-vines, the grassy <lb/>
nooks and vistas glimpsed as we swept by, the flowering <lb/>
creepers waving their red blossoms from the tops of dead <lb/>
trunks, and all the spendthrift richness of the forest foliage, <lb/>
were wasted and thrown away there. The chutes were lovely <lb/>
places to steer in; they were deep, except at the head; the <lb/>
current was gentle; under the "points" the water was <lb/>
absolutely dead, and the invisible banks so bluff that where <lb/>
the tender willow thickets projected you could bury your <lb/>
boat's broadside in them as you tore along, and then you <lb/>
seemed fairly to fly.</p>
<p>Behind other islands we found wretched little farms, and <lb/>
wretcheder little log-cabins; there were crazy rail fences <lb/>
sticking a foot or two above the water, with one or two <reg orig="jeans-|clad">jeans-clad</reg>, <lb/>
chills-racked, yellow-faced male miserables roosting on <lb/>
the top-rail, elbows on knees, jaws in hands, grinding tobacco <lb/>
and discharging the result at floating chips through crevices <lb/>
left by lost teeth; while the rest of the family and the few <lb/>
farm-animals were huddled together in an empty wood-flat <lb/>
riding at her moorings close at hand. In this flatboat the <lb/>
family would have to cook and eat and sleep for a lesser or <lb/>
greater number of days (or possibly weeks), until the river <lb/>
should fall two or three feet and let them get back to their <lb/>
log-cabin and their chills again&mdash;chills being a merciful <lb/>
provision of an all-wise Providence to enable them to take <lb/>
<pb n="135" entity="DSSR_000002932_0146"/>
exercise without exertion. And this sort of watery camping <lb/>
out was a thing which these people were rather liable to be <lb/>
treated to a couple of times a year: by the December rise <lb/>
out of the Ohio, and the June rise out of the Mississippi. <lb/>
And yet these were kindly dispensations, for they at least <lb/>
enabled the poor things to rise from the dead now and then, <lb/>
and look upon life when a steamboat went by. They <reg orig="appre-|ciated">appreciated</reg> <lb/>
the blessing, too, for they spread their mouths and <lb/>
eyes wide open and made the most of these occasions. Now <lb/>
what <hi rend="italic">could</hi> these banished creatures find to do to keep from <lb/>
dying of the blues during the low-water season!</p>

<p>Once, in one of these lovely island chutes, we found our <lb/>
course completely bridged by a great fallen tree. This will <lb/>
serve to show how narrow some of the chutes were. The <lb/>
passengers had an hour's recreation in a virgin wilderness, <lb/>
while the boat-hands chopped the bridge away; for there was <lb/>
no such thing as turning back, you comprehend.</p>
<p>From Cairo to Baton Rouge, when the river is over its <lb/>
banks, you have no particular trouble in the night, for the <lb/>
thousand-mile wall of dense forest that guards the two <lb/>
banks all the way is only gapped with a farm or wood-yard <lb/>
opening at intervals, and so you can't "get out of the river" <lb/>
much easier than you could get out of a fenced lane; but <lb/>
from Baton Rouge to New Orleans it is a different matter. <lb/>
The river is more than a mile wide, and very deep&mdash;as much <lb/>
as two hundred feet, in places. Both banks, for a good deal <lb/>
over a hundred miles, are shorn of their timber and bordered <lb/>
by continuous sugar plantations, with only here and there a <lb/>
scattering sapling or row of ornamental China-trees. The <lb/>
timber is shorn off clear to the rear of the plantations, from <lb/>
two to four miles. When the first frost threatens to come, <lb/>
the planters snatch off their crops in a hurry. When they <lb/>
have finished grinding the cane, they form the refuse of the <lb/>
stalks (which they call <hi rend="italic">bagasse</hi>) into great piles and set fire <lb/>
to them, though in other sugar countries the bagasse is used <lb/>
for fuel in the furnaces of the sugar mills. Now the piles of <lb/>
damp bagasse burn slowly, and smoke like Satan's own <lb/>
kitchen.</p>
<p>An embankment ten or fifteen feet high guards both banks <lb/>
of the Mississippi all the way down that lower end of the <lb/>
river, and this embankment is set back from the edge of <lb/>
the shore from ten to perhaps a hundred feet, according to <lb/>
circumstances; say thirty or forty feet, as a general thing. <lb/>
Fill that whole region with an impenetrable gloom of smoke <lb/>
from a hundred miles of burning bagasse piles, when the <lb/>
river is over the banks, and turn a steamboat loose along <lb/>
there at midnight and see how she will feel. And see how <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="DSSR_000002932_0148"/>
you will feel, too! You find yourself away out in the midst <lb/>
of a vague dim sea that is shoreless, that fades out and loses <lb/>
itself in the murky distances; for you cannot discern the <lb/>
thin rib of embankment, and you are always imagining you <lb/>
see a straggling tree when you don't. The plantations <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
are transformed by the smoke, and look like a part of <lb/>
the sea. All through your watch you are tortured with the <lb/>
exquisite misery of uncertainty. You hope you are keeping <lb/>
in the river, but you do not know. All that you are sure <lb/>
about is that you are likely to be within six feet of the bank <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">and</hi> destruction, when you think you are a good half-mile <lb/>
from shore. And you are sure, also, that if you chance <lb/>
suddenly to fetch up against the embankment and topple <lb/>
your chimneys overboard, you will have the small comfort of <lb/>
knowing that it is about what you were expecting to do. <lb/>
One of the great Vicksburg packets darted out into a sugar <lb/>
plantation one night, at such a time, and had to stay there <lb/>
a week. But there was no novelty about it; it had often <lb/>
been done before.</p>

</figure>
<p>I thought I had finished this chapter, but I wish to add a <lb/>
curious thing, while it is in my mind. It is only relevant in <lb/>
that it is connected with piloting. There used to be an <lb/>
excellent pilot on the river, a Mr. X., who was a <reg orig="somnambu-|list">somnambulist</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="DSSR_000002932_0149"/>
It was said that if his mind was troubled about a bad <lb/>
piece of river, he was pretty sure to get up and walk in his <lb/>
sleep and do strange things. He was once fellow-pilot for a <lb/>
trip or two with George Ealer, on a great New Orleans <lb/>
passenger packet. During a considerable part of the first <lb/>
trip George was uneasy, but got over it by and by, as X. <lb/>
seemed content to stay in his bed when asleep. Late one <lb/>
night the boat was approaching Helena, Arkansas; the water <lb/>
was low, and the crossing above the town in a very blind and <lb/>
tangled condition. X. had seen the crossing since Ealer <lb/>
had, and as the night was particularly drizzly, sullen, and <lb/>
dark, Ealer was considering whether he had not better have <lb/>
X. called to assist in running the place, when the door <lb/>
opened and X. walked in. Now on very dark nights, light <lb/>
is a deadly enemy to piloting; you are aware that if you <lb/>
stand in a lighted room, on such a night, you cannot see <lb/>
things in the street to any purpose; but if you put out the <lb/>
lights and stand in the gloom you can make out objects in <lb/>
the street pretty well. So, on very dark nights, pilots do <lb/>
not smoke; they allow no fire in the pilot-house stove if there <lb/>
is a crack which can allow the least ray to escape; they order <lb/>
the furnaces to be curtained with huge tarpaulins and the <lb/>
sky-lights to be closely blinded. Then no light whatever <lb/>
issues from the boat. The undefinable shape that now <lb/>
entered the pilot-house had Mr. X.'s voice. This said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Let me take her, George; I've seen this place since you <lb/>
have, and it is so crooked that I reckon I can run it myself <lb/>
easier than I could tell you how to do it."</p>
<p>"It is kind of you, and I swear <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am willing. I have n't <lb/>
got another drop of perspiration left in me. I have been <lb/>
spinning around and around the wheel like a squirrel. It is <lb/>
so dark I can't tell which way she is swinging till she is <lb/>
coming around like a whirligig."</p>
<p>So Ealer took a seat on the bench, panting and breathless. <lb/>
The black phantom assumed the wheel without saying <lb/>
anything, steadied the waltzing steamer with a turn or two, <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="DSSR_000002932_0150"/>
and then stood at ease, coaxing her a little to this side and <lb/>
then to that, as gently and as sweetly as if the time had <lb/>
been noonday. When Ealer observed this marvel of steering, <lb/>
he wished he had not <reg orig="con-|fessed">confessed</reg>! <lb/>
He stared, and <reg orig="won-|dered">wondered</reg>, <lb/>
and finally said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, I thought I knew <lb/>
how to steer a steamboat, but that was another mistake of <lb/>
mine."</p>
<figure id="f74" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0150">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"the phantom assumed the <lb/>
wheel."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>X. said nothing, but went serenely on with his work. He <lb/>
rang for the leads; he rang to slow down the steam; he <lb/>
worked the boat carefully and neatly into invisible marks, <lb/>
then stood at the centre of the wheel and peered blandly out <lb/>
into the blackness, fore and aft, to verify his position; as <lb/>
the leads shoaled more and more, he stopped the engines <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="DSSR_000002932_0151"/>
entirely, and the dead silence and suspense of "drifting" <lb/>
followed; when the shoalest water was struck, he cracked on <lb/>
the steam, carried her handsomely over, and then began to <lb/>
work her warily into <lb/>
the next system of <lb/>
shoal marks; the <lb/>
same patient, <reg orig="heed-|ful">heedful</reg> <lb/>
use of leads and <lb/>
engines followed, <lb/>
the boat slipped <lb/>
through without <lb/>
touching <reg orig="bot-|tom">bottom</reg>, <lb/>
and <reg orig="en-|tered">entered</reg> <lb/>
upon <lb/>
the third <lb/>
and last <lb/>
<reg orig="intri-|cacy">intricacy</reg> <lb/>
of the crossing; imperceptibly she moved through the <lb/>
gloom, crept by inches into her marks, drifted tediously till</p>
<figure id="f75" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0151">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"nobody there."</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="141" entity="DSSR_000002932_0152"/>
<p>the shoalest water was cried, and then, under a tremendous <lb/>
head of steam, went swinging over the reef and away into <lb/>
deep water and safety!</p>
<p>Ealer let his long-pent breath pour out in a great, relieving <lb/>
sigh, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"That's the sweetest piece of piloting that was ever done <lb/>
on the Mississippi River! I would n't believed it could be <lb/>
done, if I had n't seen it."</p>
<p>There was no reply, and he added:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Just hold her five minutes longer, partner, and let me run <lb/>
down and get a cup of coffee."</p>
<p>A minute later Ealer was biting into a pie, down in the <lb/>
"texas," and comforting himself with coffee. Just then <lb/>
the night watchman happened in, and was about to happen <lb/>
out again, when he noticed Ealer and exclaimed,</p>
<p>"Who is at the wheel, sir?"</p>
<p>"X."</p>
<p>"Dart for the pilot-house, quicker than lightning!"</p>
<p>The next moment both men were flying up the pilot-house <lb/>
companion-way, three steps at a jump! Nobody there! The <lb/>
great steamer was whistling down the middle of the river at <lb/>
her own sweet will! The watchman shot out of the place <lb/>
again; Ealer seized the wheel, set an engine back with power, <lb/>
and held his breath while the boat reluctantly swung away <lb/>
from a "towhead" which she was about to knock into the <lb/>
middle of the Gulf of Mexico!</p>
<p>By and by the watchman came back and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Did n't that lunatic tell you he was asleep, when he first <lb/>
came up here?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Well, he was. I found him walking along on top of the <lb/>
railings, just as unconcerned as another man would walk a <lb/>
pavement; and I put him to bed; now just this minute there <lb/>
he was again, away astern, going through that sort of <reg orig="tight-|rope">tightrope</reg> <lb/>
deviltry the same as before."</p>
<p>"Well, I think I'll stay by, next time he has one of those <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="DSSR_000002932_0153"/>
fits. But I hope he'll have them often. You just ought to <lb/>
have seen him take this boat through Helena crossing. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> <lb/>
never saw anything so gaudy before. And if he can do such <lb/>
gold-leaf, kid-glove, diamond-breastpin piloting when he is <lb/>
sound asleep, what <hi rend="italic">could n't</hi> he do if he was dead!"</p>

<head>SOUNDING.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> the river is very low, and one's steamboat is <lb/>
"drawing all the water" there is in the channel,&mdash; <lb/>
or a few inches more, as was often the case in the old times,<lb/>
&mdash;one must be painfully circumspect in his piloting. We <lb/>
used, to have to "sound" a number of particularly bad places <lb/>
almost every trip when the river was at a very low stage.</p>
<figure id="f77" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0154">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"sounding."</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="144" entity="DSSR_000002932_0155"/>
<p>Sounding is done in this way. The boat ties up at the <lb/>
shore, just above the shoal crossing; the pilot not on watch <lb/>
takes his "cub" or steersman and a picked crew of men <lb/>
(sometimes an officer also), and goes out in the yawl&mdash; <lb/>
provided the boat has not that rare and sumptuous luxury, <lb/>
a regularly-devised "sounding-boat"&mdash;and proceeds to hunt <lb/>
for the best water, the pilot on duty watching his movements <lb/>
through a spy-glass, meantime, and in some instances <reg orig="assist-|ing">assisting</reg> <lb/>
by signals of the boat's whistle, signifying "try higher <lb/>
up" or "try lower down;" for the surface of the water, <lb/>
like an oil-painting, is more expressive and intelligible when <lb/>
inspected from a little distance than very close at hand. <lb/>
The whistle signals are seldom necessary, however; never, <lb/>
perhaps, except when the wind confuses the significant <reg orig="rip-|ples">ripples</reg> <lb/>
upon the water's surface. When the yawl has reached <lb/>
the shoal place, the speed is slackened, the pilot begins to <lb/>
sound the depth with a pole ten or twelve feet long, and the <lb/>
steersman at the tiller obeys the order to "hold her up to <lb/>
starboard;" or "let her fall off to larboard;"<ref target="n9" n="9"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
<note id="n9" place="foot" n="9"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>The term "larboard" is never used at sea, now, to signify the left hand; <lb/>
but was always used on the river in my time.</p></note>
 or "steady <lb/>
&mdash;steady as you go."</p>
<p>When the measurements indicate that the yawl is <reg orig="approach-|ing">approaching</reg> <lb/>
the shoalest part of the reef, the command is given to <lb/>
"ease all!" Then the men stop rowing and the yawl drifts <lb/>
with the current. The next order is, "Stand by with the <lb/>
buoy!" The moment the shallowest point is reached, the <lb/>
pilot delivers the order, "Let go the buoy!" and over she <lb/>
goes. If the pilot is not satisfied, he sounds the place again; <lb/>
if he finds better water higher up or lower down, he removes <lb/>
the buoy to that place. Being finally satisfied, he gives the <lb/>
order, and all the men stand their oars straight up in the <lb/>
air, in line; a blast from the boat's whistle indicates that <lb/>
the signal has been seen; then the men "give way" on their <lb/>
oars and lay the yawl alongside the buoy; the steamer comes <lb/>
creeping carefully down, is pointed straight at the buoy, <lb/>
<pb n="145" entity="DSSR_000002932_0156"/>
husbands her power for the coming struggle, and presently, <lb/>
at the critical moment, turns on all her steam and goes <lb/>
grinding and wallowing over the buoy and the sand, and <lb/>
gains the deep water beyond. Or maybe she does n't; may be <lb/>
she "strikes and swings." Then she has to while away <reg orig="sev-|eral">several</reg> <lb/>
hours (or days) sparring herself off.</p>
<p>Sometimes a buoy is not laid at all, but the yawl goes <lb/>
ahead, hunting the best water, and the steamer follows along <lb/>
in its wake. Often there is a deal of fun and excitement <lb/>
about sounding, especially if it is a glorious summer day, or <lb/>
a blustering night. But in winter the cold and the peril <lb/>
take most of the fun out of it.</p>
<p>A buoy is nothing but a board four or five feet long, with <lb/>
one end turned up; it is a reversed school-house bench, <lb/>
with one of the supports left and the other removed. It is <lb/>
anchored on the shoalest part of the reef by a rope with a <lb/>
heavy stone made fast to the end of it. But for the <reg orig="resist-|ance">resistance</reg> <lb/>
of the turned-up end of the reversed bench, the current <lb/>
would pull the buoy under water. At night, a paper lantern <lb/>
with a candle in it is fastened on top of the buoy, and this <lb/>
can be seen a mile or more, a little glimmering spark in the <lb/>
waste of blackness.</p>
<p>Nothing delights a cub so much as an opportunity to go <lb/>
out sounding. There is such an air of adventure about it; <lb/>
often there is danger; it is so gaudy and man-of-war-like to <lb/>
sit up in the stern-sheets and steer a swift yawl; there is <lb/>
something fine about the exultant spring of the boat when <lb/>
an experienced old sailor crew throw their souls into the <lb/>
oars; it is lovely to see the white foam stream away from <lb/>
the bows; there is music in the rush of the water; it is <lb/>
deliciously exhilarating, in summer, to go speeding over the <lb/>
breezy expanses of the river when the world of wavelets is <lb/>
dancing in the sun. It is such grandeur, too, to the cub, to <lb/>
get a chance to give an order; for often the pilot will simply <lb/>
say, "Let her go about!" and leave the rest to the cub, who <lb/>
instantly cries, in his sternest tone of command, "Ease <reg orig="star-|board">starboard</reg>! <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="DSSR_000002932_0157"/>
Strong on the larboard! Starboard give way! With <lb/>
a will, men!" The cub enjoys sounding for the further <lb/>
reason that the eyes of the passengers are watching all the <lb/>
yawl's movements with absorbing interest if the time be <lb/>
daylight; and if it be night he knows that those same <reg orig="won-|dering">wondering</reg> <lb/>
eyes are fastened upon the yawl's lantern as it glides <lb/>
out into the gloom and dims away in the remote distance.</p>
<p>One trip a pretty girl of sixteen spent her time in our <lb/>
pilot-house with her uncle and aunt, every day and all day <lb/>
long. I fell in love with her. So did Mr. Thornburg's cub, <lb/>
Tom G&mdash;&mdash;. Tom and I had been bosom friends until this <lb/>
time; but now a coolness began to arise. I told the girl a <lb/>
good many of my river adventures, and made myself out a <lb/>
good deal of a hero; Tom tried to make himself appear to <lb/>
be a hero, too, and succeeded to some extent, but then he <lb/>
always had a way of embroidering. However, virtue is its <lb/>
own reward, so I was a barely perceptible trifle ahead in the <lb/>
contest. About this time something happened which <reg orig="prom-|ised">promised</reg> <lb/>
handsomely for me: the pilots decided to sound the <lb/>
crossing at the head of 21. This would occur about nine or <lb/>
ten o'clock at night, when the passengers would be still up; <lb/>
it would be Mr. Thornburg's watch, therefore my chief would <lb/>
have to do the sounding. We had a perfect love of a <reg orig="sound-|ing-boat&mdash;long">sounding-boat&mdash;long</reg>, <lb/>
trim, graceful, and as fleet as a greyhound; <lb/>
her thwarts were cushioned; she carried twelve oarsmen; <lb/>
one of the mates was always sent in her to transmit orders <lb/>
to her crew, for ours was a steamer where no end of "style" <lb/>
was put on.</p>
<p>We tied up at the shore above 21, and got ready. It <lb/>
was a foul night, and the river was so wide, there, that a <lb/>
landsman's uneducated eyes could discern no opposite shore <lb/>
through such a gloom. The passengers were alert and <reg orig="inter-|ested">interested</reg>; <lb/>
everything was satisfactory. As I hurried through <lb/>
the engine-room, picturesquely gotten up in storm toggery, <lb/>
I met Tom, and could not forbear delivering myself of a <lb/>
mean speech:&mdash;</p>
<pb n="147" entity="DSSR_000002932_0158"/>
<p>"Ain't you glad <hi rend="italic">you</hi> don't have to go out sounding?"</p>
<p>Tom was passing on, but he quickly turned, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Now just for that, you can go and get the sounding-pole <lb/>
yourself. I was going after it, but I'd see you in Halifax, <lb/>
now, before I'd do it."</p>
<p>"Who wants you to get it? <hi rend="italic">I</hi> <lb/>
don't. It's in the sounding-boat."</p>
<p>"It ain't, either. It's been <reg orig="new-|painted">new-painted</reg>; <lb/>
and it's been <lb/>
up on the ladies cabin <lb/>
guards two days, <reg orig="dry-|ing">drying</reg>."</p>
<p>I flew <lb/>
back, and <lb/>
shortly <lb/>
arrived <lb/>
among <lb/>
the crowd of <reg orig="watch-|ing">watching</reg> <lb/>
and wondering <lb/>
ladies just in time to <lb/>
hear the command:</p>
<p>"Give way, men!"</p>
<figure id="f78" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0158">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"oh, how awful."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>I looked over, and <lb/>
there was the gallant <lb/>
sounding-boat <reg orig="boom-|ing">booming</reg> <lb/>
away, the <reg orig="unprin-|cipled">unprincipled</reg> <lb/>
Tom presiding <lb/>
at the tiller, and my <lb/>
chief sitting by him <lb/>
with the <reg orig="sounding-|pole">sounding-pole</reg> <lb/>
which I had been sent on a fool's errand to fetch. Then <lb/>
that young girl said to me,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Oh, how awful to have to go out in that little boat on <lb/>
such a night! Do you think there is any danger?"</p>
<p>I would rather have been stabbed. I went off, full of <lb/>
venom, to help in the pilot-house. By and by the boat's <lb/>
<pb n="148" entity="DSSR_000002932_0159"/>
lantern disappeared, and after an interval a wee spark <lb/>
glimmered upon the face of the water a mile away. Mr. <lb/>
Thornburg blew the whistle, in acknowledgment, backed the <lb/>
steamer out, and made for it. We flew along for a while, <lb/>
then slackened steam and went cautiously gliding toward <lb/>
the spark. Presently Mr. Thornburg exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Hello, the buoy-lantern's out!"</p>
<p>He stopped the engines. A moment or two later he <lb/>
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Why, there it is again!"</p>
<p>So he came ahead on the engines once more, and rang for <lb/>
the leads. Gradually the water shoaled up, and then began <lb/>
to deepen again! Mr. Thornburg muttered:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, I don't understand this. I believe that buoy has <lb/>
drifted off the reef. Seems to be a little too far to the left. <lb/>
No matter, it is safest to run over it, anyhow."</p>
<p>So, in that solid world of darkness we went creeping down <lb/>
on the light. Just as our bows were in the act of plowing <lb/>
over it, Mr. Thornburg seized the bell-ropes, rang a startling <lb/>
peal, and exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>"My soul, it's the sounding-boat!"</p>
<p>A sudden chorus of wild alarms burst out far below&mdash;a <lb/>
pause&mdash;and then a sound of grinding and crashing followed. <lb/>
Mr. Thornburg exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>"There! the paddle-wheel has ground the sounding-boat <lb/>
to lucifer matches! Run! See who is killed!"</p>
<p>I was on the main deck in the twinkling of an eye. My <lb/>
chief and the third mate and nearly all the men were safe. <lb/>
They had discovered their danger when it was too late to <lb/>
pull out of the way; then, when the great guards <reg orig="overshad-|owed">overshadowed</reg> <lb/>
them a moment later, they were prepared and knew <lb/>
what to do; at my chief's order they sprang at the right <lb/>
instant, seized the guard, and were hauled aboard. The <lb/>
next moment the sounding-yawl swept aft to the wheel and <lb/>
was struck and splintered to atoms. Two of the men and <lb/>
the cub Tom, were missing&mdash;a fact which spread like <reg orig="wild-|fire">wildfire</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="DSSR_000002932_0160"/>
over the boat. The passengers came flocking to the <lb/>
forward gangway, ladies and all, anxious-eyed, white-faced, <lb/>
and talked in awed voices of the dreadful thing. And often <lb/>
and again I heard them say, "Poor fellows! poor boy, poor <lb/>
boy!"</p>
<p>By this time the boat's yawl was manned and away, to <lb/>
search for the missing. Now a faint call was heard, off to <lb/>
the left. The yawl had disappeared in the other direction. <lb/>
Half the people rushed to one side to encourage the <reg orig="swim-|mer">swimmer</reg> <lb/>
with their shouts; the other half rushed the other way <lb/>
to shriek to the yawl to turn about. By the callings, the <lb/>
swimmer was approaching, but some said the sound showed <lb/>
failing strength. The crowd massed themselves against the <lb/>
boiler-deck railings, leaning over and staring into the gloom; <lb/>
and every faint and fainter cry wrung from them such words <lb/>
as "Ah, poor fellow, poor fellow! is there <hi rend="italic">no</hi> way to save <lb/>
him?"</p>
<p>But still the cries held out, and drew nearer, and <reg orig="pres-|ently">presently</reg> <lb/>
the voice said pluckily,&mdash;</p>
<p>"I can make it! Stand by with a rope!"</p>
<p>What a rousing cheer they gave him! The chief mate <lb/>
took his stand in the glare of a torch-basket, a coil of rope <lb/>
in his hand, and his men grouped about him. The next <lb/>
moment the swimmer's face appeared in the circle of light, <lb/>
and in another one the owner of it was hauled aboard, limp <lb/>
and drenched, while cheer on cheer went up. It was that <lb/>
devil Tom.</p>
<p>The yawl crew searched everywhere, but found no sign of <lb/>
the two men. They probably failed to catch the guard, <reg orig="tum-|bled">tumbled</reg> <lb/>
back, and were struck by the wheel and killed. Tom <lb/>
had never jumped for the guard at all, but had plunged <lb/>
head-first into the river and dived under the wheel. It was <lb/>
nothing; I could have done it easy enough, and I said so; <lb/>
but everybody went on just the same, making a wonderful <lb/>
to-do over that ass, as if he had done something great. That <lb/>
girl could n't seem to have enough of that pitiful "hero" <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="DSSR_000002932_0161"/>
the rest of the trip; but little I cared; I loathed her, any <lb/>
way.</p>
<figure id="f79" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0161">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"hauled aboard."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>The way we came to mistake the sounding-boat's lantern <lb/>
for the buoy-light was <lb/>
this. My chief said that <lb/>
after laying the buoy he <lb/>
fell away and watched it <lb/>
till it seemed to be <reg orig="se-|cure">secure</reg>; <lb/>
then he took up a <lb/>
position a hundred yards below it and a little to one side of <lb/>
the steamer's course, headed the sounding-boat up-stream, <lb/>
<pb n="151" entity="DSSR_000002932_0162"/>
and waited. Having to wait some time, he and the officer <lb/>
got to talking; he looked up when he judged that the <lb/>
steamer was about on the reef; saw that the buoy was gone, <lb/>
but supposed that the steamer had already run over it; he <lb/>
went on with his talk; he noticed that the steamer was <reg orig="get-|ting">getting</reg> <lb/>
very close down on him, but that was the correct thing; <lb/>
it was her business to shave him closely, for convenience in <lb/>
taking him aboard; he was expecting her to sheer off, until <lb/>
the last moment; then it flashed upon him that she was <reg orig="try-|ing">trying</reg> <lb/>
to run him down, mistaking his lantern for the <reg orig="buoy-|light">buoy-light</reg>; <lb/>
so he sang out, "Stand by to spring for the guard, <lb/>
men!" and the next instant the jump was made.</p>

<head>A PILOT'S NEEDS.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">But</hi> I am wandering from what I was intending to do, <lb/>
that is, make plainer than perhaps appears in the <lb/>
previous chapters, some of the peculiar requirements of the <lb/>
science of piloting. First of all, there is one faculty which <lb/>
a pilot must incessantly cultivate until he has brought it to <lb/>
absolute perfection. Nothing short of perfection will do. <lb/>
That faculty is memory. He cannot stop with merely <reg orig="think-|ing">thinking</reg> <lb/>
a thing is so and so; he must <hi rend="italic">know</hi> it; for this is <reg orig="emi-|nently">eminently</reg> <lb/>
one of the "exact" sciences. With what scorn a <lb/>
pilot was looked upon, in the old times, if he ever ventured <lb/>
to deal in that feeble phrase "I think," instead of the <reg orig="vigor-|ous">vigorous</reg> <lb/>
one "I know!" One cannot easily realize what a <reg orig="tre-|mendous">tremendous</reg> <lb/>
thing it is to know every trivial detail of twelve <lb/>
hundred miles of river and know it with absolute exactness. <lb/>
If you will take the longest street in New York, and travel <lb/>
up and down it, conning its features patiently until you <lb/>
know every house and window and door and lamp-post and <lb/>
big and little sign by heart, and know them so accurately <lb/>
that you can instantly name the one you are abreast of when <lb/>
you are set down at random in that street in the middle of <lb/>
an inky black night, you will then have a tolerable notion of <lb/>
the amount and the exactness of a pilot's knowledge who <lb/>
carries the Mississippi River in his head. And then if you <lb/>
will go on until you know every street crossing, the <reg orig="charac-|ter">character</reg>, <lb/>
size, and position of the crossing-stones, and the varying <lb/>
depth of mud in each of those numberless places, you will <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="DSSR_000002932_0164"/>
have some idea of what the pilot must know in order to <lb/>
keep a Mississippi steamer out of trouble. Next, if you will <lb/>
take half of the <lb/>
signs in that long <lb/>
street, and <hi rend="italic">change <lb/>
their places</hi> once a <lb/>
month, and still <lb/>
manage to know <lb/>
their new positions <lb/>
accurately on dark <lb/>
nights, and keep up <lb/>
with these repeated <lb/>
changes without <lb/>
making any <reg orig="mis-|takes">mistakes</reg>, <lb/>
you will <reg orig="un-|derstand">understand</reg> <lb/>
what is <lb/>
required of a pilot's <lb/>
peerless memory <lb/>
by the fickle <reg orig="Missis-|sippi">Mississippi</reg>.</p>
<figure id="f81" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0164">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"a city street."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>I think a pilot's <lb/>
memory is about <lb/>
the most wonderful <lb/>
thing in the world. <lb/>
To know the Old <lb/>
and New <reg orig="Testa-|ments">Testaments</reg> <lb/>
by heart, <lb/>
and be able to <reg orig="re-|cite">recite</reg> <lb/>
them glibly, <lb/>
forward or <reg orig="back-|ward">backward</reg>, <lb/>
or begin at <lb/>
random anywhere <lb/>
in the book and <lb/>
recite both ways <lb/>
and never trip or <lb/>
make a mistake, <lb/>
<pb n="154" entity="DSSR_000002932_0165"/>
is no extravagant mass of knowledge, and no marvellous <lb/>
facility, compared to a pilot's massed knowledge of the <reg orig="Mis-|sissippi">Mississippi</reg> <lb/>
and his marvellous facility in the handling of it. I <lb/>
make this comparison deliberately, and believe I am not <lb/>
expanding the truth when I do it. Many will think my <lb/>
figure too strong, but pilots will not.</p>
<p>And how easily and comfortably the pilot's memory does <lb/>
its work; how placidly effortless is its way; how <hi rend="italic">unconsciously</hi> <lb/>
it lays up its vast stores, hour by hour, day by day, and never <lb/>
loses or mislays a single valuable package of them all! Take <lb/>
an instance. Let a leadsman cry, "Half twain! half twain! <lb/>
half twain! half twain! half twain!" until it becomes as <lb/>
monotonous as the ticking of a clock; let conversation be <lb/>
going on all the time, and the pilot be doing his share of the <lb/>
talking, and no longer consciously listening to the leadsman; <lb/>
and in the midst of this endless string of half twains let a <lb/>
single "quarter twain!" be interjected, without emphasis, <lb/>
and then the half twain cry go on again, just as before: two <lb/>
or three weeks later that pilot can describe with precision <lb/>
the boat's position in the river when that quarter twain was <lb/>
uttered, and give you such a lot of head-marks, stern-marks, <lb/>
and side-marks to guide you, that you ought to be able to <lb/>
take the boat there and put her in that same spot again <reg orig="your-|self">yourself</reg>! <lb/>
The cry of "quarter twain" did not really take his mind <lb/>
from his talk, but his trained faculties instantly photographed <lb/>
the bearings, noted the change of depth, and laid up the <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg> <lb/>
details for future reference without requiring any <lb/>
assistance from <hi rend="italic">him</hi> in the matter. If you were walking and <lb/>
talking with a friend, and another friend at your side kept <lb/>
up a monotonous repetition of the vowel sound A, for a <lb/>
couple of blocks, and then in the midst interjected an R, <lb/>
thus, A, A, A, A, A, R, A, A, A, etc., and gave the R no <lb/>
emphasis, you would not be able to state, two or three <lb/>
weeks afterward, that the R had been put in, nor be able <lb/>
to tell what objects you were passing at the moment it <lb/>
was done. But you could if your memory had been <reg orig="pa-|tiently">patiently</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="DSSR_000002932_0166"/>
and laboriously trained to do that sort of thing <lb/>
mechanically.</p>
<p>Give a man a tolerably fair memory to start with, and <lb/>
piloting will develop it <lb/>
into a very colossus of <lb/>
capability. But <hi rend="italic">only in <lb/>
the matters it is daily <lb/>
drilled in.</hi> A time would <lb/>
come when the man's <lb/>
faculties could not help <lb/>
noticing landmarks and <lb/>
soundings, and his <reg orig="mem-|ory">memory</reg> <lb/>
could not help <reg orig="hold-|ing">holding</reg> <lb/>
on to them <lb/>
with the grip of <lb/>
a vice; but if <lb/>
you asked that <lb/>
same man at <lb/>
noon what he <lb/>
had had for <lb/>
breakfast, it <lb/>
would be ten <lb/>
chances to one <lb/>
that he could <lb/>
not tell you. <lb/>
Astonishing <lb/>
things can be <lb/>
done with the <lb/>
human memory <lb/>
if you will <reg orig="de-|vote">devote</reg> <lb/>
it faithfully <lb/>
to one <reg orig="particu-|lar">particular</reg> <lb/>
line of <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg>.</p>

<p>At the time that wages soared so high on the Missouri <lb/>
River, my chief, Mr. Bixby, went up there and learned more <lb/>
<pb n="156" entity="DSSR_000002932_0167"/>
than a thousand miles of that stream with an ease and <lb/>
rapidity that were astonishing. When he had seen each <reg orig="divi-|sion">division</reg> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">once</hi> in the daytime and <hi rend="italic">once</hi> at night, his education was <lb/>
so nearly complete that he took out a "daylight" license; a <lb/>
few trips later he took out a full license, and went to piloting <lb/>
day and night,&mdash;and he ranked A 1, too.</p>
<p>Mr. Bixby placed me as steersman for a while under a pilot <lb/>
whose feats of memory were a constant marvel to me. <reg orig="How-|ever">However</reg>, <lb/>
his memory was <lb/>
born in him, I think, <lb/>
not built. For instance, <lb/>
somebody would <reg orig="men-|tion">mention</reg> <lb/>
a name. Instantly <lb/>
Mr. Brown would break <lb/>
in:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Oh, I knew <hi rend="italic">him.</hi> <lb/>
Sallow-faced, red-headed <lb/>
fellow, with a little scar <lb/>
on the side of his throat, <lb/>
like a splinter under the <lb/>
flesh. He was only in <lb/>
the Southern trade six <lb/>
months. That was <reg orig="thir-|teen">thirteen</reg> <lb/>
years ago. I made <lb/>
a trip with him. There <lb/>
was five feet in the upper <lb/>
river then; the 'Henry <lb/>
Blake' grounded at the <lb/>
foot of Tower Island drawing four and a half; the 'George <lb/>
Elliott' unshipped her rudder on the wreck of the '<reg orig='Sun-|flower'>Sunflower</reg>'"&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f83" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0167">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"oh, i knew</hi> <hi rend="italic">him.</hi>"</head>
</figure>
<p>"Why, the 'Sunflower' did n't sink until"&mdash;</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">I</hi> know when she sunk; it was three years before that, <lb/>
on the 2d of December; Asa Hardy was captain of her, and <lb/>
his brother John was first clerk; and it was his first trip in <lb/>
her, too; Tom Jones told me these things a week afterward <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="DSSR_000002932_0168"/>
in New Orleans; he was first mate of the 'Sunflower.' <lb/>
Captain Hardy stuck a nail in his foot the 6th of July of <lb/>
the next year, and died of the lockjaw on the 15th. His <lb/>
brother John died two years after,&mdash;3d of <reg orig="March,&mdash;erysip-|elas">March,&mdash;erysipelas</reg>. <lb/>
I never saw either of the Hardys,&mdash;they were <reg orig="Alle-|ghany">Alleghany</reg> <lb/>
River men,&mdash;but people who knew them told me all <lb/>
these things. And they said Captain Hardy wore yarn <lb/>
socks winter and summer just the same, and his first wife's <lb/>
name was Jane Shook,&mdash;she was from New England,&mdash;and <lb/>
his second one died <lb/>
in a lunatic asylum. <lb/>
It was in the blood. <lb/>
She was from <reg orig="Lexing-|ton">Lexington</reg>, <lb/>
Kentucky. <lb/>
Name was Horton <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
she was <reg orig="mar-|ried">married</reg>."</p>
<figure id="f84" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0168">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"so full of laugh."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>And so on, by the <lb/>
hour, the man's <lb/>
tongue would go. He <lb/>
could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> forget any <lb/>
thing. It was simply <lb/>
impossible. The most <lb/>
trivial details <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
as distinct <lb/>
and luminous in his <lb/>
head, after they had <lb/>
lain there for years, as the most memorable events. His <lb/>
was not simply a pilot's memory; its grasp was universal. <lb/>
If he were talking about a trifling letter he had received <lb/>
seven years before, he was pretty sure to deliver you the <lb/>
entire screed from memory. And then without observing <lb/>
that he was departing from the true line of his talk, he <lb/>
was more than likely to hurl in a long-drawn <reg orig="paren-|thetical">parenthetical</reg> <lb/>
biography of the writer of that letter; and you <lb/>
were lucky indeed if he did not take up that writer's <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="DSSR_000002932_0169"/>
relatives, one by one, and give you their biographies, <lb/>
too.</p>
<p>Such a memory as that is a great misfortune. To it, all <lb/>
occurrences are of the same size. Its possessor cannot <reg orig="dis-|tinguish">distinguish</reg> <lb/>
an interesting circumstance from an uninteresting <lb/>
one. As a talker, he is bound to clog his narrative with <lb/>
tiresome details and make himself an insufferable bore. <lb/>
Moreover, he cannot stick to his subject. He picks up <lb/>
every little grain of memory he discerns in his way, and <lb/>
so is led aside. Mr. Brown would start out with the honest <lb/>
intention of telling you a vastly funny anecdote about a dog. <lb/>
He would be "so full of laugh" that he could hardly begin; <lb/>
then his memory would start with the dog's breed and <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg> <lb/>
appearance; drift into a history of his owner; of his <lb/>
owner's family, with descriptions of weddings and burials <lb/>
that had occurred in it, together with recitals of <reg orig="congratula-|tory">congratulatory</reg> <lb/>
verses and obituary poetry provoked by the same; then <lb/>
this memory would recollect that one of these events occurred <lb/>
during the celebrated "hard winter" of such and such a year, <lb/>
and a minute description of that winter would follow, along <lb/>
with the names of people who were frozen to death, and <lb/>
statistics showing the high figures which pork and hay went <lb/>
up to. Pork and hay would suggest corn and fodder; corn and <lb/>
fodder would suggest cows and horses; cows and horses would <lb/>
suggest the circus and certain celebrated bare-back riders; <lb/>
the transition from the circus to the menagerie was easy and <lb/>
natural; from the elephant to equatorial Africa was but a <lb/>
step; then of course the heathen savages would suggest <reg orig="reli-|gion">religion</reg>; <lb/>
and at the end of three or four hours' tedious jaw, the <lb/>
watch would change, and Brown would go out of the <reg orig="pilot-|house">pilothouse</reg> <lb/>
muttering extracts from sermons he had heard years <lb/>
before about the efficacy of prayer as a means of grace. And <lb/>
the original first mention would be all you had learned about <lb/>
that dog, after all this waiting and hungering.</p>
<p>A pilot must have a memory; but there are two higher <reg orig="quali-|ties">qualities</reg> <lb/>
which he must also have. He must have good and quick <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="DSSR_000002932_0170"/>
judgment and decision, and a cool, calm courage that no peril <lb/>
can shake. Give a man the merest trifle of pluck to start <lb/>
with, and by the time he has become a pilot he cannot be <lb/>
unmanned by any danger a steamboat can get into; but one <lb/>
cannot quite say the same for judgment. Judgment is a <lb/>
matter of brains, and a man must <hi rend="italic">start</hi> with a good stock of <lb/>
that article or he will never succeed as a pilot.</p>
<p>The growth of courage in the pilot-house is steady all the <lb/>
time, but it does not reach a high and satisfactory condition <lb/>
until some time after the young pilot has been "standing his <lb/>
own watch," alone and under the staggering weight of all <lb/>
the responsibilities connected with the position. When an <lb/>
apprentice has become pretty thoroughly acquainted with <lb/>
the river, he goes clattering along so fearlessly with his <lb/>
steamboat, night or day, that he presently begins to imagine <lb/>
that it is <hi rend="italic">his</hi> courage that animates him; but the first time <lb/>
the pilot steps out and leaves him to his own devices he finds <lb/>
out it was the other man's. He discovers that the article <lb/>
has been left out of his own cargo altogether. The whole <lb/>
river is bristling with exigencies in a moment; he is not <lb/>
prepared for them; he does not know how to meet them; <lb/>
all his knowledge forsakes him; and within fifteen minutes <lb/>
he is as white as a sheet and scared almost to death. <reg orig="There-|fore">Therefore</reg> <lb/>
pilots wisely train these cubs by various strategic tricks <lb/>
to look danger in the face a little more calmly. A favorite <lb/>
way of theirs is to play a friendly swindle upon the <reg orig="can-|didate">candidate</reg>.</p>
<p>Mr. Bixby served me in this fashion once, and for years <lb/>
afterward I used to blush even in my sleep when I thought <lb/>
of it. I had become a good steersman; so good, indeed, <lb/>
that I had all the work to do on our watch, night and day; <lb/>
Mr. Bixby seldom made a suggestion to me; all he ever did <lb/>
was to take the wheel on particularly bad nights or in <reg orig="par-|ticularly">particularly</reg> <lb/>
bad crossings, land the boat when she needed to be <lb/>
landed, play gentleman of leisure nine tenths of the watch, <lb/>
and collect the wages. The lower river was about bank-full, <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="DSSR_000002932_0171"/>
and if anybody had questioned my ability to run any <reg orig="cross-|ing">crossing</reg> <lb/>
between Cairo and New Orleans without help or <reg orig="instruc-|tion">instruction</reg>, <lb/>
I should have felt irreparably hurt. The idea of being <lb/>
afraid of any crossing in the lot, in the <hi rend="italic">day-time,</hi> was a thing <lb/>
too preposterous for contemplation. Well, one matchless <lb/>
summer's day I was bowling down the bend above island 66, <lb/>
brimful of self-conceit and carrying my nose as high as a <lb/>
giraffe's, when Mr. Bixby said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"I am going below a while. I suppose you know the next <lb/>
crossing?"</p>
<p>This was almost an affront. <lb/>
It was about the plainest and <lb/>
simplest crossing in the whole <lb/>

perfectly well.</p>
<p>"Know how to <hi rend="italic">run</hi> it? <lb/>
Why, I can run it with my <lb/>

<p>"How much water is there <lb/>

<p>"You think so, do you?"</p>
<p>The very tone of the question shook my confidence. That <lb/>
was what Mr. Bixby was expecting. He left, without saying <lb/>
anything more. I began to imagine all sorts of things. Mr. <lb/>
Bixby, unknown to me, of course, sent somebody down to <lb/>
the forecastle with some mysterious instructions to the <lb/>
leadsmen, another messenger was sent to whisper among <lb/>
the officers, and then Mr. Bixby went into hiding behind a <lb/>
smoke-stack where he could observe results. Presently the <lb/>

captain stepped out on the hurricane deck; next the chief <lb/>
mate appeared; then a clerk. Every moment or two a <lb/>
straggler was added to my audience; and before I got to the <lb/>
head of the island I had fifteen or twenty people assembled <lb/>
down there under my nose. I began to wonder what the <lb/>
trouble was. As I started across, the captain glanced aloft <lb/>
at me and said, with a sham uneasiness in his voice,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Where is Mr. Bixby?"</p>
<p>"Gone below, sir."</p>
<p>But that did the business for me. My imagination began <lb/>
to construct dangers out of nothing, and they multiplied <lb/>
faster than I could keep the run of them. All at once I <lb/>
imagined I saw shoal water ahead! The wave of coward <lb/>
agony that surged through me then came near dislocating <lb/>
every joint in me. All my confidence in that crossing <reg orig="van-|ished">vanished</reg>. <lb/>
I seized the bell-rope; dropped it, ashamed; seized it <lb/>
again; dropped it once more; clutched it tremblingly once <lb/>
again, and pulled it so feebly that I could hardly hear the <lb/>
stroke myself. Captain and mate sang out instantly, and <lb/>
both together,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Starboard lead there! and quick about it!"</p>
<p>This was another shock. I began to climb the wheel like <lb/>
a squirrel; but I would hardly get the boat started to port <lb/>
before I would see new dangers on that side, and away I <lb/>
would spin to the other; only to find perils accumulating to <lb/>
starboard, and be crazy to get to port again. Then came the <lb/>
leadsman's sepulchral cry:&mdash;</p>
<p>"D-e-e-p four!"</p>
<p>Deep four in a bottomless crossing! The terror of it took <lb/>
my breath away.</p>
<p>"M-a-r-k three!...M-a-r-k three...Quarter less <lb/>
three!...Half twain!"</p>
<p>This was frightful! I seized the bell-ropes and stopped <lb/>
the engines.</p>
<p>"Quarter twain! Quarter twain! <hi rend="italic">Mark</hi> twain!"</p>
<p>I was helpless. I did not know what in the world to do. <lb/>
<pb n="164" entity="DSSR_000002932_0175"/>
I was quaking from head to foot, and I could have hung my <lb/>
hat on my eyes, they stuck out so far.</p>
<p>"Quarter <hi rend="italic">less</hi> twain! Nine and a <hi rend="italic">half!</hi>"</p>
<p>"We were <hi rend="italic">drawing</hi> nine! My hands were in a nerveless <lb/>
flutter. I could not ring a bell intelligibly with them. I flew <lb/>
to the speaking-tube and <reg orig="shout-|ed">shouted</reg> <lb/>
to the engineer,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Oh, Ben, if you love me, <hi rend="italic">back</hi> <lb/>

<p>I heard the door close gently. I looked around, and there <lb/>
stood Mr. Bixby, smiling a bland, sweet smile. Then the <lb/>
audience on the hurricane deck sent up a thundergust of <reg orig="hu-|miliating">humiliating</reg> <lb/>
laughter. I saw it all, now, and I felt meaner than <lb/>
the meanest man in human history. I laid in the lead, set the <lb/>
boat in her marks, came ahead on the engines, and said:&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="173" entity="DSSR_000002932_0176"/>
never speak again if he did n't pucker up his mouth and go <lb/>
to <hi rend="italic">whistling!</hi> Yes, sir; whistling 'Buffalo gals, can't you <lb/>

attending a funeral and were n't related to the corpse. And <lb/>
when I remonstrated with him about it, he smiled down on <lb/>
me as if I was his child, and told me to run in the house and <lb/>

<p>Once a pretty mean captain caught Stephen in New Orleans <lb/>
out of work and as usual out of money. He laid steady <lb/>
<pb n="174" entity="DSSR_000002932_0177"/>
siege to Stephen, who was in a very "close place," and <lb/>
finally persuaded him to hire with him at one hundred and <lb/>
twenty-five dollars per month, just half wages, the captain <lb/>
agreeing not to divulge the secret and so bring down the <lb/>
contempt of all the guild upon the poor fellow. But the <lb/>
boat was not more than a day out of New Orleans before <lb/>
Stephen discovered that the captain was boasting of his <lb/>
exploit, and that all the officers had been told. Stephen <lb/>
winced, but said nothing. About the middle of the <reg orig="after-|noon">afternoon</reg> <lb/>
the captain stepped out on the hurricane deck, cast his <lb/>
eye around, and looked a good deal surprised. He glanced <lb/>
inquiringly aloft at Stephen, but Stephen was whistling <lb/>
placidly, and attending to business. The captain stood <lb/>
around a while in evident discomfort, and once or twice <lb/>
seemed about to make a suggestion; but the etiquette of the <lb/>
river taught him to avoid that sort of rashness, and so he <lb/>
managed to hold his peace. He chafed and puzzled a few <lb/>
minutes longer, then retired to his apartments. But soon he <lb/>
was out again, and apparently more perplexed than ever. <lb/>
Presently he ventured to remark, with deference,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Pretty good stage of the river now, ain't it, sir?"</p>
<p>"Well, I should say so! Bank-full <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a pretty liberal <lb/>
stage."</p>
<p>"Seems to be a good deal of current here."</p>
<p>"Good deal don't describe it! It's worse than a <reg orig="mill-|race">millrace</reg>."</p> <lb/>
<p>"Is n't it easier in toward shore than it is out here in the <lb/>
middle?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I reckon it is; but a body can't be too careful with <lb/>
a steamboat. It's pretty safe out here; can't strike any <lb/>
bottom here, you can depend on that."</p>
<p>The captain departed, looking rueful enough. At this <lb/>
rate, he would probably die of old age before his boat got to <lb/>
St. Louis. Next day he appeared on deck and again found <lb/>
Stephen faithfully standing up the middle of the river, <lb/>
fighting the whole vast force of the Mississippi, and whistling <lb/>
<pb n="175" entity="DSSR_000002932_0178"/>
the same placid tune. This thing was becoming serious. <lb/>
In by the shore was a slower boat clipping along in the easy <lb/>
water and gaining steadily; she began to make for an island <lb/>
chute; Stephen stuck to the middle of the river. Speech <lb/>
was <hi rend="italic">wrung</hi> from the captain. He said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, don't that chute cut off a good deal of <lb/>
distance?"</p>
<p>"I think it does, but I don't know."</p>
<p>"Don't know! Well, is n't there water enough in it now <lb/>
to go through?"</p>
<p>"I expect there is, but I am not certain."</p>
<p>"Upon my word this is odd! Why, those pilots on that <lb/>
boat yonder are going to try it. Do you mean to say that <lb/>
you don't know as much as they do?"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">They!</hi> Why, <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar pilots! <lb/>
But don't you be uneasy; I know as much as any man can <lb/>
afford to know for a hundred and twenty-five!"</p>
<p>The captain surrendered.</p>
<p>Five minutes later Stephen was bowling through the chute <lb/>
and showing the rival boat a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar <lb/>
pair of heels.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<div3 type="section" id="d39">
<head>THE PILOTS' MONOPOLY.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">One</hi> day, on board the "Aleck Scott," my chief, Mr. <lb/>
Bixby, was crawling carefully through a close place at <lb/>
Cat Island, both leads going, and everybody holding his <lb/>
breath. The captain, a nervous, apprehensive man, kept <lb/>
still as long as he could, but finally broke down and shouted <lb/>
from the hurricane deck,&mdash;</p>
<p>"For gracious' sake, give her steam, Mr. Bixby! give her <lb/>
steam! She'll never raise the reef on this headway!"</p>
<p>For all the effect that was produced upon Mr. Bixby, one <lb/>
would have supposed that no remark had been made. But <lb/>
five minutes later, when the danger was past and the leads <lb/>
laid in, he burst instantly into a consuming fury, and gave <lb/>
the captain the most admirable cursing I ever listened to. <lb/>
No bloodshed ensued; but that was because the captain's <lb/>
cause was weak; for ordinarily he was not a man to take <lb/>
correction quietly.</p>
<p>Having now set forth in detail the nature of the science of <lb/>
piloting, and likewise described the rank which the pilot <lb/>
held among the fraternity of steamboatmen, this seems a <lb/>
fitting place to say a few words about an organization which <lb/>
the pilots once formed for the protection of their guild. It <lb/>
was curious and noteworthy in this, that it was perhaps the <lb/>
compactest, the completest, and the strongest commercial <lb/>
organization ever formed among men.</p>
<p>For a long time wages had been two hundred and fifty <lb/>
dollars a month; but curiously enough, as steamboats <reg orig="multi-|plied">multiplied</reg> <lb/>
and business increased, the wages began to fall little by <lb/>
<pb n="177" entity="DSSR_000002932_0180"/>
little. It was easy to discover the reason of this. Too many <lb/>
pilots were being "made." It was nice to have a "cub," a <lb/>
steersman, to do all the hard work for a couple of years, <lb/>
gratis, while his master sat <lb/>
on a high bench and smoked; <lb/>
all pilots and captains had <lb/>
sons or nephews who wanted <lb/>
to be pilots. By and by it <lb/>
came to pass that nearly <lb/>
every pilot on the river had a steersman. When a steersman <lb/>
had made an amount of progress that was satisfactory to any <lb/>
two pilots in the trade, they could get a pilot's license for him <lb/>
by signing an application directed to the United States In-</p>
<figure id="f89" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0180">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"burst into a fury."</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="178" entity="DSSR_000002932_0181"/>
<p>spector. Nothing further was needed; usually no questions <lb/>
were asked, no proofs of capacity required.</p>
<p>Very, well, this growing swarm of new pilots presently <lb/>
began to undermine the wages, in order to get berths. Too <lb/>
late&mdash;apparently&mdash;the knights of the tiller perceived their <lb/>
mistake. Plainly, something had to be done, and quickly; <lb/>
but what was to be the needful thing? A close organization. <lb/>
Nothing else would answer. To compass this seemed an <lb/>
impossibility; so it was talked, and talked, and then dropped. <lb/>
It was too likely to ruin whoever ventured to move in the <lb/>
matter. But at last about a dozen of the boldest&mdash;and <lb/>
some of them the best&mdash;pilots on the river launched <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
into the enterprise and took all the chances. They <lb/>
got a special charter from the legislature, with large powers, <lb/>
under the name of the Pilots' Benevolent Association; <lb/>
elected their officers, completed their organization, <reg orig="contrib-|uted">contributed</reg> <lb/>
capital, put "association" wages up to two hundred <lb/>
and fifty dollars at once&mdash;and then retired to their homes, <lb/>
for they were promptly discharged from employment. But <lb/>
there were two or three unnoticed trifles in their by-laws <lb/>
which had the seeds of propagation in them. For instance, <lb/>
all idle members of the association, in good standing, were <lb/>
entitled to a pension of twenty-five dollars per month. This <lb/>
began to bring in one straggler after another from the ranks <lb/>
of the new-fledged pilots, in the dull (summer) season. <lb/>
Better have twenty-five dollars than starve; the initiation fee <lb/>
was only twelve dollars, and no dues required from the <lb/>
unemployed.</p>
<p>Also, the widows of deceased members in good standing <lb/>
could draw twenty-five dollars per month, and a certain sum <lb/>
for each of their children. Also, the said deceased would be <lb/>
buried at the association's expense. These things resurrected <lb/>
all the superannuated and forgotten pilots in the Mississippi <lb/>
Valley. They came from farms, they came from interior <reg orig="vil-|lages">villages</reg>, <lb/>
they came from everywhere. They came on crutches, <lb/>
on drays, in ambulances,&mdash;any way, so they got there. They <lb/>
<pb n="179" entity="DSSR_000002932_0182"/>
paid in their twelve dollars, and straightway began to draw out <lb/>
twenty-five dollars a month and calculate their burial bills.</p>
<figure id="f90" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0182">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"resurrected pilots."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>By and by, all the useless, helpless pilots, and a dozen <lb/>
first-class ones, were in the association, and nine tenths of <lb/>
the best pilots out of it and laughing at it. It was the <lb/>
laughing-stock of the whole river. Everybody joked about <lb/>
the by-law requiring <reg orig="mem-|bers">members</reg> <lb/>
to pay ten per cent of <lb/>
their wages, every month, <lb/>
into the treasury for the <lb/>
support of the association, <lb/>
whereas all the members <lb/>
were outcast and tabooed, <lb/>
and no one would employ <lb/>
them. Everybody was <reg orig="deri-|sively">derisively</reg> <lb/>
grateful to the <reg orig="asso-|ciation">association</reg> <lb/>
for taking all the <lb/>
worthless pilots out of the <lb/>
way and leaving the whole field to the excellent and the <lb/>
deserving; and everybody was not only jocularly grateful for <lb/>
that, but for a result which naturally followed, namely, the <lb/>
gradual advance of wages as the busy season approached. <lb/>
Wages had gone up from the low figure of one hundred <reg orig="dol-|lars">dollars</reg> <lb/>
a month to one hundred and twenty-five, and in some <lb/>
<pb n="180" entity="DSSR_000002932_0183"/>
cases to one hundred and fifty; and it was great fun to <reg orig="en-|large">enlarge</reg> <lb/>
upon the fact that this charming thing had been <reg orig="ac-|complished">accomplished</reg> <lb/>
by a body of men not one of whom received <lb/>
a particle of benefit from it. Some of the jokers used to <lb/>
call at the association rooms and have a good time <reg orig="chaff-|ing">chaffing</reg> <lb/>
the members and offering them the charity of taking <lb/>
them as steersmen for a trip, so that they could see what the <lb/>
forgotten river looked like. However, the association was <lb/>
content; or at least it gave no sign to the contrary. Now and <lb/>
then it captured a pilot who was "out of luck," and added <lb/>
him to its list; and these later additions were very valuable, <lb/>
for they were good pilots; the incompetent ones had all been <lb/>
absorbed before. As business freshened, wages climbed <lb/>
gradually up to two hundred and fifty dollars&mdash;the <reg orig="asso-|ciation">association</reg> <lb/>
figure&mdash;and became firmly fixed there; and still <lb/>
without benefiting a member of that body, for no member <lb/>
was hired. The hilarity at the association's expense burst <lb/>
all bounds, now. There was no end to the fun which that <lb/>
poor martyr had to put up with.</p>
<p>However, it is a long lane that has no turning. Winter <lb/>
approached, business doubled and trebled, and an avalanche <lb/>
of Missouri, Illinois, and Upper Mississippi River boats came <lb/>
pouring down to take a chance in the New Orleans trade. <lb/>
All of a sudden, pilots were in great demand, and were <reg orig="cor-|respondingly">correspondingly</reg> <lb/>
scarce. The time for revenge was come. It <lb/>
was a bitter pill to have to accept association pilots at last, <lb/>
yet captains and owners agreed that there was no other way. <lb/>
But none of these outcasts offered! So there was a still <lb/>
bitterer pill to be swallowed: they must be sought out and <lb/>
asked for their services. Captain &mdash;&mdash; was the first man <lb/>
who found it necessary to take the dose, and he had been <lb/>
the loudest derider of the organization. He hunted up one <lb/>
of the best of the association pilots and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, you boys have rather got the best of us for a little <lb/>
while, so I'll give in with as good a grace as I can. I've come <lb/>
to hire you; get your trunk aboard right away. I want to <lb/>
leave at twelve o'clock."</p>
<pb n="181" entity="DSSR_000002932_0184"/>
<p>"I don't know about that. Who is your other pilot?"</p>
<p>"I've got I. S&mdash;&mdash;. Why?"</p>
<p>"I can't go with him. He don't belong to the <reg orig="asso-|ciation">association</reg>."</p> <lb/>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"It's so."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to tell me that you won't turn a wheel <lb/>
with one of the very best and oldest pilots on the river <lb/>
because he don't belong to your association?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do."</p>
<p>"Well, if this is n't putting on airs! I supposed I was <lb/>
doing you a benevolence; but I begin to think that I am <lb/>
the party that wants a favor done. Are you acting under <lb/>
a law of the concern?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Show it to me."</p>
<p>So they stepped into the association rooms, and the <reg orig="sec-|retary">secretary</reg> <lb/>
soon satisfied the captain, who said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, what am I to do? I have hired Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; for the <lb/>
entire season."</p>
<p>"I will provide for you," said the secretary. "I will <lb/>
detail a pilot to go with you, and he shall be on board at <lb/>
twelve o'clock."</p>
<p>"But if I discharge S&mdash;&mdash;, he will come on me for the <lb/>
whole season's wages."</p>
<p>"Of course that is a matter between you and Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, <lb/>
captain. We cannot meddle in your private affairs."</p>
<p>The captain stormed, but to no purpose. In the end he <lb/>
had to discharge S&mdash;&mdash;, pay him about a thousand dollars, <lb/>
and take an association pilot in his place. The laugh was <lb/>
beginning to turn the other way, now. Every day, <reg orig="thence-|forward">thenceforward</reg>, <lb/>
a new victim fell; every day some outraged captain <lb/>
discharged a non-association pet, with tears and profanity, <lb/>
and installed a hated association man in his berth. In a <lb/>
very little while, idle non-associationists began to be pretty <lb/>
plenty, brisk as business was, and much as their services <lb/>
<pb n="182" entity="DSSR_000002932_0185"/>
were desired. The laugh was shifting to the other side of <lb/>
their mouths most palpably. These victims, together with <lb/>
the captains and owners, presently ceased to laugh <reg orig="alto-|gether">altogether</reg>, <lb/>
and began to rage about the revenge they would <lb/>
take when the passing business "spurt" was over.</p>
<figure id="f91" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0185">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"the captain stormed."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Soon all the laughers that were left were the owners and <lb/>
crews of boats that had two non-association pilots. But their <lb/>
triumph was not very long-lived. For this reason: It was a <lb/>
rigid rule of the association that its members should never, <lb/>
under any circumstances whatever, give information about <lb/>
the channel to any "outsider." By this time about half the <lb/>
boats had none but association pilots, and the other half had <lb/>
none but outsiders. At the first glance one would suppose <lb/>
<pb n="183" entity="DSSR_000002932_0186"/>
that when it came to forbidding information about the river <lb/>
these two parties could play equally at that game; but this <lb/>
was not so. At every good-sized town from one end of the <lb/>
river to the other, there was a "wharf-boat" to land at, <lb/>
instead of a wharf or a pier. Freight was stored in it for <lb/>
transportation; waiting passengers slept in its cabins. Upon <lb/>
each of these wharf-boats <lb/>
the association's officers <lb/>
placed a strong box, <reg orig="fast-|ened">fastened</reg> <lb/>
with a peculiar lock <lb/>
which was used in no <lb/>
other service but one&mdash;the United States mail service. It <lb/>
was the letter-bag lock, a sacred governmental thing. By <lb/>
dint of much beseeching the government had been persuaded</p>
<figure id="f92" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0186">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"the sign of membership."</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="184" entity="DSSR_000002932_0187"/>
<p>to allow the association to use this lock. Every association <lb/>
man carried a key which would open these boxes. That key, <lb/>
or rather a peculiar way of holding it in the hand when its <lb/>
owner was asked for river information by a stranger,&mdash;for <lb/>
the success of the St. Louis and New Orleans association <lb/>
had now bred tolerably thriving branches in a dozen <reg orig="neigh-|boring">neighboring</reg> <lb/>
steamboat trades,&mdash;was the association man's sign <lb/>
and diploma of membership; and if the stranger did not <lb/>
respond by producing a similar key and holding it in a <lb/>
certain manner duly prescribed, his question was politely <lb/>
ignored. From the association's secretary each member <lb/>
received a package of more or less gorgeous blanks, printed <lb/>
like a bill-head, on handsome paper, properly ruled in <reg orig="col-|umns">columns</reg>; <lb/>
a bill-head worded something like this:&mdash;</p>
<q><text id="d40"><body><div1 type="quotation">
<head type="main">STEAMER GREAT REPUBLIC.</head>

<cell rend="center"><hi rend="small-caps">Marks.</hi></cell>
<cell rend="center"><hi rend="small-caps">Remarks.</hi></cell>
</row>
</table>
</div1></body></text></q>
<p>These blanks were filled up, day by day, as the voyage <lb/>
progressed, and deposited in the several wharf-boat boxes. <lb/>
For instance, as soon as the first crossing, out from St. <lb/>
Louis, was completed, the items would be entered upon the <lb/>
blank, under the appropriate headings, thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>"St. Louis. Nine and a half (feet). Stern on <reg orig="court-|house">courthouse</reg>, <lb/>
head on dead cottonwood above wood-yard, until <lb/>
you raise the first reef, then pull up square." Then under <lb/>
head of Remarks: "Go just outside the wrecks; this is <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg>. <lb/>
New snag just where you straighten down; go <lb/>
above it."</p>
<p>The pilot who deposited that blank in the Cairo box <reg orig="(af-|ter">(after</reg> <lb/>
adding to it the details of every crossing all the way <lb/>
down from St. Louis) took out and read half a dozen fresh <lb/>
reports (from upward-bound steamers) concerning the river <lb/>
<pb n="185" entity="DSSR_000002932_0188"/>
between Cairo and Memphis, posted himself thoroughly, <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg> <lb/>
them to the box, and went back aboard his boat again <lb/>
so armed against accident that he could not possibly get his <lb/>
boat into trouble without bringing the most ingenious <reg orig="care-|lessness">carelessness</reg> <lb/>
to his aid.</p>
<p>Imagine the benefits of so admirable a system in a piece of <lb/>
river twelve or thirteen hundred miles long, whose channel <lb/>
was shifting every day! The pilot who had formerly been <lb/>
obliged to put up with seeing a shoal place once or possibly <lb/>
twice a month, had a hundred sharp eyes to watch it for him, <lb/>
now, and bushels of intelligent brains to tell him how to run <lb/>
it. His information about it was seldom twenty-four hours <lb/>
old. If the reports in the last box chanced to leave any <reg orig="mis-|givings">misgivings</reg> <lb/>
on his mind concerning a treacherous crossing, he <lb/>
had his remedy; he blew his steam-whistle in a peculiar way <lb/>
as soon as he saw a boat approaching; the signal was <reg orig="an-|swered">answered</reg> <lb/>
in a peculiar way if that boat's pilots were <reg orig="associa-|tion">association</reg> <lb/>
men; and then the two steamers ranged alongside and <lb/>
all uncertainties were swept away by fresh information <lb/>
furnished to the inquirer by word of mouth and in minute <lb/>
detail.</p>
<p>The first thing a pilot did when he reached New Orleans or <lb/>
St. Louis was to take his final and elaborate report to the <lb/>
association parlors and hang it up there,&mdash;<hi rend="italic">after</hi> which he <lb/>
was free to visit his family. In these parlors a crowd was <lb/>
always gathered together, discussing changes in the channel, <lb/>
and the moment there was a fresh arrival, everybody stopped <lb/>
talking till this witness had told the newest news and settled <lb/>
the latest uncertainty. Other craftsmen can "sink the shop," <lb/>
sometimes, and interest themselves in other matters. Not <lb/>
so with a pilot; he must devote himself wholly to his <reg orig="pro-|fession">profession</reg> <lb/>
and talk of nothing else; for it would be small gain <lb/>
to be perfect one day and imperfect the next. He has no <lb/>
time or words to waste if he would keep "posted."</p>
<p>But the outsiders had a hard time of it. No particular <lb/>
place to meet and exchange information, no wharf-boat <reg orig="re-|ports">reports</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="186" entity="DSSR_000002932_0189"/>
none but chance and unsatisfactory ways of getting <lb/>
news. The consequence was that a man sometimes had to <lb/>
run five hundred miles of river on information that was a <lb/>
week or ten days old. At a fair stage of the river that <lb/>
might have answered; but when the dead low water came it <lb/>
was destructive.</p>

<p>Now <lb/>
came <reg orig="anoth-|er">another</reg> <lb/>
perfectly <reg orig="logi-|cal">logical</reg> <lb/>
result. The <reg orig="out-|siders">outsiders</reg> <lb/>
began to ground <lb/>
steamboats, sink them, and get <lb/>
into all sorts of trouble, whereas <lb/>
accidents seemed to keep entirely <lb/>
away from the association men. Wherefore even the owners <lb/>
and captains of boats furnished exclusively with outsiders, <lb/>
and previously considered to be wholly independent of the <lb/>
<pb n="187" entity="DSSR_000002932_0190"/>
association and free to comfort themselves with brag and <lb/>
laughter, began to feel pretty uncomfortable. Still, they <lb/>
made a show of keeping up the brag, until one black day <lb/>
when every captain of the lot was formally ordered to <reg orig="imme-|diately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
discharge his outsiders and take association pilots in <lb/>
their stead. And who was it that had the dashing <reg orig="presump-|tion">presumption</reg> <lb/>
to do that? Alas, it came from a power behind the <lb/>
throne that was greater than the throne itself. It was the <lb/>
underwriters!</p>
<p>It was no time to "swap knives." Every outsider had to <lb/>
take his trunk ashore at once. Of course it was supposed <lb/>
that there was collusion between the association and the <reg orig="un-|derwriters">underwriters</reg>, <lb/>
but this was not so. The latter had come to <reg orig="com-|prehend">comprehend</reg> <lb/>
the excellence of the "report" system of the <reg orig="associ-|ation">association</reg> <lb/>
and the safety it secured, and so they had made their <lb/>
decision among themselves and upon plain business <reg orig="princi-|ples">principles</reg>.</p>
<p>There was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth in <lb/>
the camp of the outsiders now. But no matter, there was <lb/>
but one course for them to pursue, and they pursued it. <lb/>
They came forward in couples and groups, and proffered their <lb/>
twelve dollars and asked for membership. They were <reg orig="sur-|prised">surprised</reg> <lb/>
to learn that several new by-laws had been long ago <lb/>
added. For instance, the initiation fee had been raised to <lb/>
fifty dollars; that sum must be tendered, and also ten per <lb/>
cent of the wages which the applicant had received each and <lb/>
every month since the founding of the association. In many <lb/>
cases this amounted to three or four hundred dollars. Still, <lb/>
the association would not entertain the application until the <lb/>
money was present. Even then a single adverse vote killed <lb/>
the application. Every member had to vote yes or no in <reg orig="per-|son">person</reg> <lb/>
and before witnesses; so it took weeks to decide a <lb/>
candidacy, because many pilots were so long absent on <lb/>
voyages. However, the repentant sinners scraped their <reg orig="sav-|ings">savings</reg> <lb/>
together, and one by one, by our tedious voting process, <lb/>
they were added to the fold. A time came, at last, when <lb/>
<pb n="188" entity="DSSR_000002932_0191"/>
only about ten remained outside. They said they would <lb/>
starve before they would apply. They remained idle a long <lb/>
while, because of course nobody could venture to employ <lb/>
them.</p>
<p>By and by the association <reg orig="pub-|lished">published</reg> <lb/>
the fact that upon a <reg orig="cer-|tain">certain</reg> <lb/>
date the wages <lb/>
would be raised to <lb/>
five hundred <reg orig="dol-|lars">dollars</reg> <lb/>
per month. All <lb/>
the branch <reg orig="associa-|tions">associations</reg> <lb/>
had grown <lb/>
strong, now, and the Red River <lb/>
one had advanced wages to seven <lb/>
hundred dollars a month. <reg orig="Re-|luctantly">Reluctantly</reg> <lb/>
the ten outsiders <reg orig="yield-|ed">yielded</reg>, <lb/>
in view of these <lb/>
things, and made <lb/>
application. There <lb/>
was <hi rend="italic">another</hi> new <lb/>
by-law, by this time, <lb/>
which required them <lb/>
to pay dues not only <lb/>
on all the wages they <lb/>
had received since the <reg orig="asso-|ciation">association</reg> <lb/>
was born, but also <lb/>
on what they would have <lb/>
received if they had <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
at work up to the time <lb/>
of their application, instead of <lb/>
going off to pout in idleness. It <lb/>
turned out to be a difficult <reg orig="mat-|ter">matter</reg> <lb/>
to elect them, but it was accomplished at last. The most <lb/>
virulent sinner of this batch had stayed out and allowed "dues" <lb/>
to accumulate against him so long that he had to send in six <lb/>
hundred and twenty-five dollars with his application.</p>
<figure id="f94" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0191">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"added to the fold."</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="189" entity="DSSR_000002932_0192"/>
<p>The association had a good bank account now, and was <lb/>
very strong. There was no longer an outsider. A by-law <lb/>
was added forbidding the reception of any more cubs or <reg orig="ap-|prentices">apprentices</reg> <lb/>
for five years; after which time a limited number <lb/>
would be taken, not by individuals, but by the association, upon <lb/>
these terms: the applicant must not be less than eighteen <lb/>
years old, and of respectable family and good character; he <lb/>
must pass an examination as to education, pay a thousand <lb/>
dollars in advance for the privilege of becoming an <reg orig="appren-|tice">apprentice</reg>, <lb/>
and must remain under the commands of the <reg orig="associa-|tion">association</reg> <lb/>
until a great part of the membership (more than half, I <lb/>
think) should be willing to sign his application for a pilot's <lb/>
license.</p>
<p>All previously-articled apprentices were now taken away <lb/>
from their masters and adopted by the association. The <lb/>
president and secretary detailed them for service on one boat <lb/>
or another, as they chose, and changed them from boat to <lb/>
boat according to certain rules. If a pilot could show that <lb/>
he was in infirm health and needed assistance, one of the <lb/>
cubs would be ordered to go with him.</p>
<p>The widow and orphan list grew, but so did the <reg orig="associa-|tion's">association's</reg> <lb/>
financial resources. The association attended its own <lb/>
funerals in state, and paid for them. When occasion <reg orig="de-|manded">demanded</reg>, <lb/>
it sent members down the river upon searches for <lb/>
the bodies of brethren lost by steamboat accidents; a search <lb/>
of this kind sometimes cost a thousand dollars.</p>
<p>The association procured a charter and went into the <reg orig="in-|surance">insurance</reg> <lb/>
business, also. It not only insured the lives of its <lb/>
members, but took risks on steamboats.</p>
<p>The organization seemed indestructible. It was the <reg orig="tight-|est">tightest</reg> <lb/>
monopoly in the world. By the United States law, no <lb/>
man could become a pilot unless two duly licensed pilots <lb/>
signed his application; and now there was nobody outside <lb/>
of the association competent to sign. Consequently the <lb/>
making of pilots was at an end. Every year some would <lb/>
die and others become incapacitated by age and infirmity; <lb/>
<pb n="190" entity="DSSR_000002932_0193"/>
there would be no new ones to take their places. In time, <lb/>
the association could put wages up to any figure it chose; <lb/>
and as long as it should be wise enough not to carry the <lb/>
thing too far and provoke the national government into <lb/>
amending the licensing system, steamboat owners would <lb/>
have to submit, since there would be no help for it.</p>
<figure id="f95" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0193">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">a justifiable advance.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>The owners and captains were <lb/>
the only obstruction that lay <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
the association and <reg orig="abso-|lute">absolute</reg> <lb/>
power; and at last this one was removed. Incredible <lb/>
as it may seem, the owners and captains deliberately did it <lb/>
themselves. When the pilots' association announced, months <lb/>
beforehand, that on the first day of September, 1861, wages <lb/>
would be advanced to five hundred dollars per month, the <lb/>
<pb n="191" entity="DSSR_000002932_0194"/>
owners and captains instantly put freights up a few cents, and <lb/>
explained to the farmers along the river the necessity of it, <lb/>
by calling their attention to the burdensome rate of wages <lb/>
about to be established. It was a rather slender argument, <lb/>
but the farmers did not seem to detect it. It looked <reg orig="reason-|able">reasonable</reg> <lb/>
to them that to add five cents freight on a bushel of <lb/>
corn was justifiable under the circumstances, overlooking the <lb/>
fact that this advance on a cargo of forty thousand sacks <lb/>
was a good deal more than necessary to cover the new <lb/>
wages.</p>
<p>So, straightway the captains and owners got up an <reg orig="associ-|ation">association</reg> <lb/>
of their own, and proposed to put captains' wages up to <lb/>
five hundred dollars, too, and move for another advance in <lb/>
freights. It was a novel idea, but of course an effect which <lb/>
had been produced once could be produced again. The new <lb/>
association decreed (for this was before all the outsiders had <lb/>
been taken into the pilots' association) that if any captain <lb/>
employed a non-association pilot, he should be forced to <reg orig="dis-|charge">discharge</reg> <lb/>
him, and also pay a fine of five hundred dollars. <lb/>
Several of these heavy fines were paid before the captains' <lb/>
organization grew strong enough to exercise full authority <lb/>
over its membership; but that all ceased, presently. The <lb/>
captains tried to get the pilots to decree that no member of <lb/>
their corporation should serve under a non-association <reg orig="cap-|tain">captain</reg>; <lb/>
but this proposition was declined. The pilots saw <lb/>
that they would be backed up by the captains and the <reg orig="under-|writers">underwriters</reg> <lb/>
anyhow, and so they wisely refrained from entering <lb/>
into entangling alliances.</p>
<p>As I have remarked, the pilots' association was now the <lb/>
compactest monopoly in the world, perhaps, and seemed <lb/>
simply indestructible. And yet the days of its glory were <lb/>
numbered. First, the new railroad stretching up through <lb/>
Mississippi, Tennessee, and Kentucky, to Northern railway <lb/>
centres, began to divert the passenger travel from the <reg orig="steam-|ers">steamers</reg>; <lb/>
next the war came and almost entirely annihilated the <lb/>
steamboating industry during several years, leaving most of <lb/>
<pb n="192" entity="DSSR_000002932_0195"/>
the pilots idle, and the cost of living advancing all the time; <lb/>
then the treasurer of the St. Louis association put his hand <lb/>
into the till and walked off with every dollar of the ample <lb/>
fund; and finally, the railroads intruding everywhere, there <lb/>
was little for steamers to do, when the war was over, but <lb/>
carry freights; so straightway some genius from the <reg orig="Atlan-|tic">Atlantic</reg> <lb/>
coast introduced the plan of towing a dozen steamer <lb/>
cargoes down to New Orleans at the tail of a vulgar little <lb/>
tug-boat; and behold, in the twinkling of an eye, as it were, <lb/>
the association and the noble science of piloting were things <lb/>
of the dead and pathetic past!</p>

<head>RACING DAYS.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was always the custom for the boats to leave New <reg orig="Or-|leans">Orleans</reg> <lb/>
between four and five o'clock in the afternoon. <lb/>
From three o'clock onward they would be burning rosin and <lb/>
pitch pine (the sign of preparation), and so one had the <lb/>
picturesque spectacle of a rank, some two or three miles <lb/>
long, of tall, ascending columns of coal-black smoke; a <reg orig="col-|onnade">colonnade</reg> <lb/>
which supported a sable roof of the same smoke <lb/>
blended together and spreading abroad over the city. Every <lb/>
outward-bound boat had its flag flying at the jack-staff, and <lb/>
sometimes a duplicate on the verge staff astern. Two or <lb/>
three miles of mates were commanding and swearing with <lb/>
more than usual emphasis; countless processions of freight <lb/>
barrels and boxes were spinning athwart the levee and flying <lb/>
aboard the stage-planks; belated passengers were dodging <lb/>
and skipping among these frantic things, hoping to reach <lb/>
the forecastle companion way alive, but having their doubts <lb/>
about it; women with reticules and bandboxes were trying <lb/>
to keep up with husbands freighted with carpet-sacks and <lb/>
crying babies, and making a failure of it by losing their <lb/>
heads in the whirl and roar and general distraction; drays <lb/>
and baggage-vans were clattering hither and thither in a <lb/>
wild hurry, every now and then getting blocked and jammed <lb/>
together, and then during ten seconds one could not see <lb/>
them for the profanity, except vaguely and dimly; every <lb/>
windlass connected with every fore-hatch, from one end of <lb/>
that long array of steamboats to the other, was keeping up <lb/>
<pb n="194" entity="DSSR_000002932_0197"/>
a deafening whiz and whir, lowering freight into the hold, <lb/>
and the half-naked crews of perspiring negroes that worked <lb/>
them were roaring such songs as "De Las' Sack! De Las' <lb/>
Sack!"&mdash;inspired to unimaginable exaltation by the chaos of <lb/>
turmoil and racket that was driving everybody else mad. By <lb/>
this time the hurricane and boiler decks of the steamers <lb/>
would be packed and black with passengers. The "last <lb/>
bells" would begin to clang, all down the line, and then the <lb/>
powwow seemed to double; in a moment or two the final <lb/>
warning came,&mdash;a simultaneous din of Chinese gongs, with <lb/>
the cry, "All dat ain't goin', please to git asho'!"&mdash;and <lb/>
behold, the powwow quadrupled! People came swarming <lb/>
ashore, overturning excited stragglers that were trying to <lb/>
swarm aboard. One more moment later a long array of <lb/>
stage-planks was being hauled in, each with its customary <lb/>
latest passenger clinging to the end of it with teeth, nails, <lb/>
and everything else, and the customary latest <reg orig="procrastina-|tor">procrastinator</reg> <lb/>
making a wild spring shoreward over his head.</p>
<p>Now a number of the boats slide backward into the stream, <lb/>
leaving wide gaps in the serried rank of steamers. Citizens <lb/>
crowd the decks of boats that are not to go, in order to see <lb/>
the sight. Steamer after steamer straightens herself up, <lb/>
gathers all her strength, and presently comes swinging by, <lb/>
under a tremendous head of steam, with flag flying, black <lb/>
smoke rolling, and her entire crew of firemen and deck-hands <lb/>
(usually swarthy negroes) massed together on the forecastle, <lb/>
the best "voice" in the lot towering from the midst (being <lb/>
mounted on the capstan), waving his hat or a flag, and all <lb/>
roaring a mighty chorus, while the parting cannons boom <lb/>
and the multitudinous spectators swing their hats and huzza! <lb/>
Steamer after steamer falls into line, and the stately <reg orig="proces-|sion">procession</reg> <lb/>
goes winging its flight up the river.</p>
<p>In the old times, whenever two fast boats started out on a <lb/>
race, with a big crowd of people looking on, it was inspiring <lb/>
to hear the crews sing, especially if the time were night-fall, <lb/>
and the forecastle lit up with the red glare of the torch-baskets. <lb/>

Racing was royal fun. The public always had an idea that <lb/>
racing was dangerous; whereas the opposite was the case&mdash; <lb/>
that is, after the laws were passed which restricted each <lb/>
boat to just so many pounds of steam to the square inch. <lb/>
No engineer was ever sleepy or careless when his heart was <lb/>
in a race. He <lb/>
was constantly <lb/>
on the alert, <reg orig="try-|ing">trying</reg> <lb/>
gauge-cocks <lb/>
and watching <lb/>
things. The <lb/>
dangerous place <lb/>
was on slow, <lb/>
plodding boats, <lb/>
where the <reg orig="en-|gineers">engineers</reg> <lb/>
drowsed <lb/>
around and <reg orig="al-|lowed">allowed</reg> <lb/>
chips to <lb/>

</figure>
<p>In the "flush <lb/>
times" of <reg orig="steam-|boating">steamboating</reg>, <lb/>
a race between two notoriously fleet steamers was <lb/>
an event of vast importance. The date was set for it several <lb/>
weeks in advance, and from that time forward, the whole <lb/>
Mississippi Valley was in a state of consuming excitement. <lb/>
Politics and the weather were dropped, and people talked <lb/>
only of the coming race. As the time approached, the two <lb/>
steamers "stripped" and got ready. Every incumbrance <lb/>
that added weight, or exposed a resisting surface to wind or <lb/>
water, was removed, if the boat could possibly do without it. <lb/>
The "spars," and sometimes even their supporting derricks, <lb/>
<pb n="198" entity="DSSR_000002932_0201"/>
were sent ashore, and no means left to set the boat afloat in <lb/>
case she got aground. When the "Eclipse" and the "A. L. <lb/>
Shotwell" ran their great race many years ago, it was said <lb/>
that pains were taken to scrape the gilding off the fanciful <lb/>
device which hung between the "Eclipse's" chimneys, and <lb/>
that for that one trip the captain left off his kid gloves and <lb/>
had his head shaved. But I always doubted these things.</p>
<p>If the boat was known to make her best speed when <lb/>
drawing five and a half feet forward and five feet aft, she <lb/>
was carefully loaded to that exact figure&mdash;she would n't <lb/>
enter a dose of hom&oelig;opathic pills on her manifest after that. <lb/>
Hardly any passengers were taken, because they not only add <lb/>
weight but they never will "trim boat." They always run <lb/>
to the side when there is anything to see, whereas a <reg orig="conscien-|tious">conscientious</reg> <lb/>
and experienced steamboatman would stick to the <lb/>
centre of the boat and part his hair in the middle with a <lb/>
spirit level.</p>
<p>No way-freights and no way-passengers were allowed, for <lb/>
the racers would stop only at the largest towns, and then it <lb/>
would be only "touch and go." Coal flats and wood flats <lb/>
were contracted for beforehand, and these were kept ready <lb/>
to hitch on to the flying steamers at a moment's warning. <lb/>
Double crews were carried, so that all work could be quickly <lb/>
done.</p>
<p>The chosen date being come, and all things in readiness, <lb/>
the two great steamers back into the stream, and lie there <lb/>
jockeying a moment, and apparently watching each other's <lb/>
slightest movement, like sentient creatures; flags drooping, <lb/>
the pent steam shrieking through safety-valves, the black <lb/>
smoke rolling and tumbling from the chimneys and darkening <lb/>
all the air. People, people everywhere; the shores, the <lb/>
house-tops, the steamboats, the ships, are packed with them, <lb/>
and you know that the borders of the broad Mississippi are <lb/>
going to be fringed with humanity thence northward twelve <lb/>
hundred miles, to welcome these racers.</p>
<p>Presently tall columns of steam burst from the '<reg orig="scape-|pipes">scape-pipes</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="199" entity="DSSR_000002932_0202"/>
of both steamers, two guns boom a good-by, two <lb/>
red-shirted heroes mounted on capstans wave their small <lb/>
flags above the massed crews on the forecastles, two plaintive <lb/>
solos linger on <lb/>
the air a few <lb/>
waiting seconds, <lb/>
two mighty <lb/>
choruses burst <lb/>
forth&mdash;and <lb/>
here they come! <lb/>
Brass bands <lb/>
bray Hail <reg orig="Co-|lumbia">Columbia</reg>, <lb/>
huzza <lb/>
after huzza <lb/>
thunders from the shores, and the stately creatures go <lb/>
whistling by like the wind.</p>

<p>Those boats will never halt a moment between New Orleans <lb/>
<pb n="200" entity="DSSR_000002932_0203"/>
and St. Louis, except for a second or two at large towns, or <lb/>
to hitch thirty-cord wood-boats alongside. You should be on <lb/>
board when they take a couple of those wood-boats in tow <lb/>
and turn a swarm of men into each; by the time you have <lb/>
wiped your glasses and put them on, you will be wondering <lb/>
what has become of that wood.</p>
<p>Two nicely matched steamers will stay in sight of each <lb/>
other day after day. They might even stay side by side, but <lb/>
for the fact that pilots are not all alike, and the smartest <lb/>
pilots will win the race. If one of the boats has a "<reg orig="light-|ning">lightning</reg>" <lb/>
pilot, whose "partner" is a trifle his inferior, you can <lb/>
tell which one is on watch by noting whether that boat has <lb/>
gained ground or lost some during each four-hour stretch. <lb/>
The shrewdest pilot can delay a boat if he has not a fine <lb/>
genius for steering. Steering is a very high art. One must <lb/>
not keep a rudder dragging across a boat's stern if he wants <lb/>
to get up the river fast.</p>
<p>There is a great difference in boats, of course. For a long <lb/>
time I was on a boat that was so slow we used to forget what <lb/>
year it was we left port in. But of course this was at rare <lb/>
intervals. Ferry-boats used to lose valuable trips because <lb/>
their passengers grew old and died, waiting for us to get by. <lb/>
This was at still rarer intervals. I had the documents for <lb/>
these occurrences, but through carelessness they have been <lb/>
mislaid. This boat, the "John J. Roe," was so slow that <lb/>
when she finally sunk in Madrid Bend, it was five years <lb/>
before the owners heard of it. That was always a confusing <lb/>
fact to me, but it is according to the record, any way. She <lb/>
was dismally slow; still, we often had pretty exciting times <lb/>
racing with islands, and rafts, and such things. One trip, <lb/>
however, we did rather well. We went to St. Louis in <lb/>
sixteen days. But even at this rattling gait I think we <lb/>
changed watches three times in Fort Adams reach, which is <lb/>
five miles long. A "reach" is a piece of straight river, and <lb/>
of course the current drives through such a place in a pretty <lb/>
lively way.</p>

<hi rend="italic">one</hi> hour. This last is called the fastest trip on record. I <lb/>
will try to show that it was not. For this reason: the <lb/>
distance between New Orleans and Cairo, when the "J. M. <lb/>
White" ran it, was about eleven hundred and six miles; <lb/>
consequently her average speed was a trifle over fourteen <lb/>
miles per hour. In the "Eclipse's" day the distance between <lb/>
the two ports had become reduced to one thousand and eighty <lb/>
miles; consequently her average speed was a shade under <lb/>
fourteen and three eighths miles per hour. In the "R. E. <lb/>
Lee's" time the distance had diminished to about one <lb/>
thousand and thirty miles; consequently her average was <lb/>
about fourteen and one eighth miles per hour. Therefore <lb/>
the "Eclipse's" was conspicuously the fastest time that has <lb/>
ever been made.</p>

<p>In June, 1859, the St. Louis and Keokuk Packet, City of Louisiana, made the run from St. <lb/>
Louis to Keokuk (214 miles) in 16 hours and 20 minutes, the best time on record.</p>
<p>In 1868 the steamer Hawkeye State, of the Northern Line Packet Company, made the run <lb/>
from St. Louis to St. Paul (800 miles) in 2 days and 20 hours. Never was beaten.</p>
<p>In 1853 the steamer Polar Star made the run from St. Louis to St. Joseph, on the Missouri <lb/>
River in 64 hours. In July, 1856, the steamer Jas. H. Lucas, Andy Wineland, Master, made <lb/>
the same run in 60 hours and 57 minutes. The distance between the ports is 600 miles, and <lb/>
when the difficulties of navigating the turbulent Missouri are taken into consideration, the <reg orig="per-|formance">performance</reg> <lb/>
of the Lucas deserves especial mention.</p>

<head>CUT-OFFS AND STEPHEN.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">These</hi> dry details are of importance in one particular. <lb/>
They give me an opportunity of introducing one of <lb/>
the Mississippi's oddest peculiarities,&mdash;that of shortening <lb/>
its length from time to time. If you will throw a long, <lb/>
pliant apple-paring over your shoulder, it will pretty fairly <lb/>
shape itself into an average section of the Mississippi River; <lb/>
that is, the nine or ten hundred miles stretching from Cairo, <lb/>
Illinois, southward to New Orleans, the same being <reg orig="wonder-|fully">wonderfully</reg> <lb/>
crooked, with a brief straight bit here and there at wide <lb/>
intervals. The two-hundred-mile stretch from Cairo <reg orig="north-|ward">northward</reg> <lb/>
to St. Louis is by no means so crooked, that being a <lb/>
rocky country which the river cannot cut much.</p>
<p>The water cuts the alluvial banks of the "lower" river <lb/>
into deep horseshoe curves; so deep, indeed, that in some <lb/>
places if you were to get ashore at one extremity of the <lb/>
horseshoe and walk across the neck, half or three quarters <lb/>
of a mile, you could sit down and rest a couple of hours <lb/>
while your steamer was coming around the long elbow, at <lb/>
a speed of ten miles an hour, to take you aboard again. <lb/>
When the river is rising fast, some scoundrel whose <reg orig="planta-|tion">plantation</reg> <lb/>
is back in the country, and therefore of inferior value, <lb/>
has only to watch his chance, cut a little gutter across the <lb/>
narrow neck of land some dark night, and turn the water <lb/>
into it, and in a wonderfully short time a miracle has <lb/>
happened: to wit, the whole Mississippi has taken possession <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="DSSR_000002932_0209"/>
of that little ditch, and placed the countryman's plantation <lb/>
on its bank (quadrupling its value), and that other party's <lb/>
formerly valuable plantation finds itself away out yonder on <lb/>
a big island; the old <reg orig="water-|course">watercourse</reg> <lb/>
around it will soon <lb/>
shoal up, boats cannot <reg orig="ap-|proach">approach</reg> <lb/>
within ten miles of <lb/>
it, and down goes its value <lb/>
to a fourth of its former <lb/>
worth. Watches are kept <lb/>
on those narrow necks, at <lb/>
needful times, and if a man <lb/>
happens to be caught <reg orig="cut-|ting">cutting</reg> <lb/>
a ditch across them, <lb/>
the chances are all against <lb/>
his ever having another <reg orig="op-|portunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
to cut a ditch.</p>
<figure id="f102" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0209">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">dangerous ditching.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Pray observe some of the <lb/>
effects of this ditching <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg>. <lb/>
Once there was a <lb/>
neck opposite Port Hudson, <lb/>
Louisiana, which was only <lb/>
half a mile across, in its <lb/>
narrowest place. You could <lb/>
walk across there in fifteen <lb/>
minutes; but if you made <lb/>
the journey around the cape <lb/>
on a raft, you travelled <lb/>
thirty-five miles to accomplish the same thing. In 1722 <lb/>
the river darted through that neck, deserted its old bed, and <lb/>
thus shortened itself thirty-five miles. In the same way it <lb/>
shortened itself twenty-five miles at Black Hawk Point in <lb/>
1699. Below Red River Landing, Raccourci cut-off was made <lb/>
(forty or fifty years ago, I think). This shortened the river <lb/>
twenty-eight miles. In our day, if you travel by river from <lb/>
the southernmost of these three cut-offs to the northernmost, <lb/>
<pb n="207" entity="DSSR_000002932_0210"/>
you go only seventy miles. To do the same thing a hundred <lb/>
and seventy-six years ago, one had to go a hundred and <reg orig="fifty-|eight">fifty-eight</reg> <lb/>
miles!&mdash;a shortening of eighty-eight miles in that <lb/>
trifling distance. At some forgotten time in the past, <reg orig="cut-|offs">cutoffs</reg> <lb/>
were made above Vidalia, Louisiana; at island 92; at <lb/>
island 84; and at Hale's Point. These shortened the river, <lb/>
in the aggregate, <reg orig="seventy-|seven">seventy-seven</reg> <lb/>
miles.</p>
<p>Since my own day on <lb/>
the Mississippi, cut-offs <lb/>
have been made at <reg orig="Hur-|ricane">Hurricane</reg> <lb/>
Island; at island <lb/>
100; at Napoleon, <reg orig="Ar-|kansas">Arkansas</reg>; <lb/>
at Walnut Bend; <lb/>
and at Council Bend. <lb/>
These shortened the river, <lb/>
in the aggregate, <lb/>
sixty-seven miles. <lb/>
In my own time <lb/>
a cut-off was <lb/>
made at <reg orig="Amer-|ican">American</reg> <lb/>
Bend, <lb/>
which <reg orig="short-|ened">shortened</reg> <lb/>
the river <lb/>
ten miles or <lb/>
more.</p>
<figure id="f103" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0210">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">a scientist.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Therefore, <lb/>
the Mississippi between Cairo and <lb/>
New Orleans was twelve hundred <lb/>
and fifteen miles long one <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
and seventy-six years ago. <lb/>
It was eleven hundred and eighty after the cut-off of 1722. <lb/>
It was one thousand and forty after the American Bend <lb/>
cut-off. It has lost sixty-seven miles since. Consequently <lb/>
its length is only nine hundred and seventy-three miles at <lb/>
present.</p>
<pb n="208" entity="DSSR_000002932_0211"/>
<p>Now, if I wanted to be one of those ponderous scientific <lb/>
people, and "let on" to prove what had occurred in the <reg orig="re-|mote">remote</reg> <lb/>
past by what had occurred in a given time in the recent <lb/>
past, or what will occur in the far future by what has <reg orig="oc-|curred">occurred</reg> <lb/>
in late years, what an opportunity is here! Geology <lb/>
never had such a chance, nor such exact data to argue from! <lb/>
Nor "development of species," either! Glacial epochs are <lb/>
great things, but they are vague&mdash;vague. Please observe:&mdash;</p>
<p>In the space of one hundred and seventy-six years the <lb/>
Lower Mississippi has shortened itself two hundred and <reg orig="forty-|two">forty-two</reg> <lb/>
miles. That is an average of a trifle over one mile and <lb/>
a third per year. Therefore, any calm person, who is not <lb/>
blind or idiotic, can see that in the Old O&ouml;litic Silurian <lb/>
Period, just a million years ago next November, the Lower <lb/>
Mississippi River was upwards of one million three hundred <lb/>
thousand miles long, and stuck out over the Gulf of Mexico <lb/>
like a fishing-rod. And by the same token any person can <lb/>
see that seven hundred and forty-two years from now the <lb/>
Lower Mississippi will be only a mile and three quarters <lb/>
long, and Cairo and New Orleans will have joined their <lb/>
streets together, and be plodding comfortably along under <lb/>
a single mayor and a mutual board of aldermen. There is <lb/>
something fascinating about science. One gets such <reg orig="whole-|sale">wholesale</reg> <lb/>
returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of <lb/>
fact.</p>
<p>When the water begins to flow through one of those <lb/>
ditches I have been speaking of, it is time for the people <lb/>
thereabouts to move. The water cleaves the banks away <lb/>
like a knife. By the time the ditch has become twelve or <lb/>
fifteen feet wide, the calamity is as good as accomplished, <lb/>
for no power on earth can stop it now. When the width has <lb/>
reached a hundred yards, the banks begin to peel off in slices <lb/>
half an acre wide. The current flowing around the bend <lb/>
travelled formerly only five miles an hour; now it is <reg orig="tre-|mendously">tremendously</reg> <lb/>
increased by the shortening of the distance. I <lb/>
was on board the first boat that tried to go through the <lb/>
<pb n="209" entity="DSSR_000002932_0212"/>
cut-off at American Bend, but we did not get through. It <lb/>
was toward midnight, and a wild night it was&mdash;thunder, <lb/>
lightning, and torrents of rain. It was estimated that the <lb/>
current in the cut-off was making about fifteen or twenty <lb/>
miles an hour; twelve or thirteen was the best our boat <lb/>
could do, even in tolerably slack water, therefore perhaps <lb/>
we were foolish to try the cut-off. However, Mr. Brown <lb/>
was ambitious, and he kept on trying. <lb/>
The eddy running up the bank, under the <lb/>
"point," was about as swift as the current <lb/>
out in the middle; so we would go flying up <lb/>
the shore like a lightning express train, get on <lb/>
a big head of steam, and "stand by for a surge" when we <lb/>
struck the current that was whirling by the point. But <lb/>
all our preparations were useless. The instant the <reg orig="cur-|rent">current</reg> <lb/>
hit us it spun us around like a top, the water deluged <lb/>
the forecastle, and the boat careened so far over that one <lb/>
could hardly keep his feet. The next instant we were</p>
<figure id="f104" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0212">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">deluged and careened.</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="210" entity="DSSR_000002932_0213"/>
<p>away down the river, clawing with might and main to <lb/>
keep out of the woods. We tried the experiment four <lb/>
times. I stood on the forecastle companion way to see. <lb/>
It was astonishing to observe how suddenly the boat would <lb/>
spin around and turn tail the moment she emerged from <lb/>
the eddy and the current struck her nose. The <reg orig="sound-|ing">sounding</reg> <lb/>
concussion and the quivering would have been about <lb/>
the same if she had come full speed against a sand-bank. <lb/>
Under the lightning flashes one could see the plantation <lb/>
cabins and the goodly acres tumble into the river; and the <lb/>
crash they made was not a bad effort at thunder. Once, <lb/>
when we spun around, we only missed a house about twenty <lb/>
feet, that had a light burning in the window; and in the <lb/>
same instant that house went overboard. Nobody could stay <lb/>
on our forecastle; the water swept across it in a torrent every <lb/>
time we plunged athwart the current. At the end of our <lb/>
fourth effort we brought up in the woods two miles below <lb/>
the cut-off; all the country there was overflowed, of course. <lb/>
A day or two later the cut-off was three quarters of a mile <lb/>
wide, and boats passed up through it without much difficulty, <lb/>
and so saved ten miles.</p>
<p>The old Raccourci cut-off reduced the river's length <reg orig="twenty-|eight">twenty-eight</reg> <lb/>
miles. There used to be a tradition connected with it. <lb/>
It was said that a boat came along there in the night and <lb/>
went around the enormous elbow the usual way, the pilots <lb/>
not knowing that the cut-off had been made. It was a grisly, <lb/>
hideous night, and all shapes were vague and distorted. The <lb/>
old bend had already begun to fill up, and the boat got to <lb/>
running away from mysterious reefs, and occasionally hitting <lb/>
one. The perplexed pilots fell to swearing, and finally uttered <lb/>
the entirely unnecessary wish that they might never get out <lb/>
of that place. As always happens in such cases, that <reg orig="par-|ticular">particular</reg> <lb/>
prayer was answered, and the others neglected. So <lb/>
to this day that phantom steamer is still butting around in <lb/>
that deserted river, trying to find her way out. More than <lb/>
one grave watchman has sworn to me that on drizzly, dismal <lb/>
<pb n="211" entity="DSSR_000002932_0214"/>
nights, he has glanced <reg orig="fear-|fully">fearfully</reg> <lb/>
down that forgotten <reg orig="riv-|er">river</reg> <lb/>
as he passed the head of <lb/>
the island, and seen the faint <lb/>
glow of the spectre steamer's <lb/>
lights drifting through the <lb/>
distant gloom, and heard the <lb/>
muffled cough of her '<reg orig="scape-|pipes">scape-pipes</reg> <lb/>
and the plaintive cry <lb/>
of her leads-men.</p>

</figure>
<p>In the absence of further <lb/>
statistics, I beg to close this <lb/>
chapter with one more <reg orig="remi-|niscence">reminiscence</reg> <lb/>
of "Stephen."</p>
<p>Most of the captains and <lb/>
pilots held Stephen's note <lb/>
for borrowed sums, ranging <lb/>
from two hundred and fifty dollars upward. Stephen never <lb/>
paid one of these notes, but he was very prompt and very <lb/>
zealous about renewing them every twelve month.</p>
<p>Of course there came a time, at last, when Stephen could <lb/>
no longer borrow of his ancient creditors; so he was obliged <lb/>
to lie in wait for new men who did not know him. Such a <lb/>
victim was good-hearted, simple-natured young Yates (I use <lb/>
<pb n="212" entity="DSSR_000002932_0215"/>
a fictitious name, but the real name began, as this one does, <lb/>
with a Y). Young Yates graduated as a pilot, got a berth, <lb/>
and when the month was ended and he stepped up to the <lb/>
clerk's office and received his two hundred and fifty dollars <lb/>
in crisp new bills, Stephen was there! His silvery tongue <lb/>
began to wag, and in a very little while Yates's two <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
and fifty dollars had changed hands. The fact was <lb/>
soon known at pilot headquarters, and the amusement and <lb/>
satisfaction of the old creditors were large and generous. <lb/>
But innocent Yates never suspected that Stephen's promise <lb/>
to pay promptly at the end of the week was a worthless one. <lb/>
Yates called for his money at the stipulated time; Stephen <lb/>
sweetened him up and put him off a week. He called then, <lb/>
according to agreement, and came away sugar-coated again, <lb/>
but suffering under another postponement. So the thing <lb/>
went on. Yates haunted Stephen week after week, to no <lb/>
purpose, and at last gave it up. And then straightway <reg orig="Ste-|phen">Stephen</reg> <lb/>
began to haunt Yates! Wherever Yates appeared, <lb/>
there was the inevitable Stephen. And not only there, but <lb/>
beaming with affection and gushing with apologies for not <lb/>
being able to pay. By and by, whenever poor Yates saw <lb/>
him coming, he would turn and fly, and drag his company <lb/>
with him, if he had company; but it was of no use; his <lb/>
debtor would run him down and corner him. Panting and <lb/>
red-faced, Stephen would come, with outstretched hands and <lb/>
eager eyes, invade the conversation, shake both of Yates's <lb/>
arms loose in their sockets, and begin:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My, what a race I've had! I saw you did n't see me, <lb/>
and so I clapped on all steam for fear I'd miss you entirely. <lb/>
And here you are! there, just stand so, and let me look at <lb/>
you! Just the same old noble countenance." [To Yates's <lb/>
friend:] "Just look at him! <hi rend="italic">Look</hi> at him! Ain't it just <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">good</hi> to look at him! <hi rend="italic">Ain't</hi> it now? Ain't he just a picture! <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Some</hi> call him a picture; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> call him a panorama! That's <lb/>
what he is&mdash;an entire panorama. And now I'm reminded! <lb/>
How I do wish I could have seen you an hour earlier! For <lb/>
<pb n="213" entity="DSSR_000002932_0216"/>
twenty-four hours I've been saving up that two hundred and <lb/>
fifty dollars for you; been looking for you everywhere. I <lb/>
waited at the Planter's from six yesterday evening till two <lb/>
o'clock this morning, without rest or food; my wife says, <lb/>
'Where have you been all night?' I said, 'This debt lies <lb/>
<figure id="f106" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0216">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"my, what a race i've had!"</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="214" entity="DSSR_000002932_0217"/>
heavy on my mind.' She says, 'In all my days I never saw <lb/>
a man take a debt to heart the way you do.' I said, 'It's <lb/>
my nature; how can <hi rend="italic">I</hi> change it?' She says, 'Well, do go <lb/>
to bed and get some rest.' I said, 'Not till that poor, noble <lb/>
young man has got his money.' So I set up all night, and <lb/>
this morning out I shot, and the first man I struck told me <lb/>
you had shipped on the 'Grank Turk' and gone to New <lb/>
Orleans. Well, sir, I had to lean up against a building and <lb/>
cry. So help me goodness, I could n't help it. The man <lb/>
that owned the place come out cleaning up with a rag, and <lb/>
said he did n't like to have people cry against his building, <lb/>
and then it seemed to me that the whole world had turned <lb/>
against me, and it was n't any use to live any more; and <lb/>
coming along an hour ago, suffering no man knows what <lb/>
agony, I met Jim Wilson and paid him the two hundred <lb/>
and fifty dollars on account; and to think that here you <lb/>
are, now, and I have n't got a cent! But as sure as I am <lb/>
standing here on this ground on this particular brick,&mdash; <lb/>
there, I've scratched a mark on the brick to remember it <lb/>
by,&mdash;I'll borrow that money and pay it over to you at <lb/>
twelve o'clock sharp, to-morrow! Now, stand so; let me <lb/>
look at you just once more."</p>
<p>And so on. Yates's life became a burden to him. He <lb/>
could not escape his debtor and his debtor's awful sufferings <lb/>
on account of not being able to pay. He dreaded to show <lb/>
himself in the street, lest he should find Stephen lying in <lb/>
wait for him at the corner.</p>
<p>Bogart's billiard saloon was a great resort for pilots in <lb/>
those days. They met there about as much to exchange <lb/>
river news as to play. One morning Yates was there; <reg orig="Ste-|phen">Stephen</reg> <lb/>
was there, too, but kept out of sight. But by and <lb/>
by, when about all the pilots had arrived who were in town, <lb/>
Stephen suddenly appeared in the midst, and rushed for <lb/>
Yates as for a long-lost brother.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Oh,</hi> I am so glad to see you! Oh my soul, the sight of <lb/>
you is such a comfort to my eyes! Gentlemen, I owe all <lb/>
<pb n="215" entity="DSSR_000002932_0218"/>
of you money; among you I owe probably forty thousand <lb/>
dollars. I want to pay it; I intend to pay it&mdash;every last <lb/>
cent of it. You all know, without my telling you, what <lb/>
sorrow it has cost me to remain so long under such deep <lb/>
obligations to such <lb/>
patient and <reg orig="gener-|ous">generous</reg> <lb/>
friends; but <lb/>
the sharpest pang <lb/>
I suffer&mdash;by far <lb/>
the sharpest&mdash; <lb/>
is from the debt <lb/>
I owe to this <lb/>
noble young man <lb/>
here; and I <lb/>
have come to this <lb/>
place this <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
especially to <lb/>
make the <reg orig="an-|nouncement">announcement</reg> <lb/>
that <lb/>
I have at last <lb/>
found a method <lb/>
whereby I can <lb/>
pay off all my <lb/>
debts! And most <lb/>
especially I wanted <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">him</hi> to be here <lb/>
when I announced <lb/>
it. Yes, my <reg orig="faith-|ful">faithful</reg> <lb/>
friend,&mdash;my benefactor, I've found the method! I've <lb/>
found the method to pay off <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my debts, and you'll get <lb/>
your money!" Hope dawned in Yates's eye; then <reg orig="Ste-|phen">Stephen</reg>, <lb/>
beaming benignantly, and placing his hand upon <lb/>
Yates's head, added, "I am going to pay them off in <reg orig="alpha-|betical">alphabetical</reg> <lb/>
order!"</p>
<figure id="f107" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0218">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"beaming benignantly."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Then he turned and disappeared. The full significance of <lb/>
Stephen's "method" did not dawn upon the perplexed and <lb/>
<pb n="216" entity="DSSR_000002932_0219"/>
musing crowd for some two minutes; and then Yates <reg orig="mur-|mured">murmured</reg> <lb/>
with a sigh:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, the Y's stand a gaudy chance. He won't get any <lb/>
further than the C's in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> world, and I reckon that after a <lb/>
good deal of eternity has wasted away in the next one, I'll <lb/>
still be referred to up there as 'that poor, ragged pilot that <lb/>
came here from St. Louis in the early days!'"</p>

<head>I TAKE A FEW EXTRA LESSONS.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">During</hi> the two or two and a half years of my <reg orig="appren-|ticeship">apprenticeship</reg>, <lb/>
I served under many pilots, and had <reg orig="experi-|ence">experience</reg> <lb/>
of many kinds of steamboatmen and many varieties of <lb/>
steamboats; for it was not always convenient for Mr. Bixby <lb/>
to have me with him, and in such cases he sent me with <lb/>
somebody else. I am to this day profiting somewhat by <lb/>
that experience; for in that brief, sharp schooling, I got <lb/>
personally and familiarly acquainted with about all the <reg orig="dif-|ferent">different</reg> <lb/>
types of human nature that are to be found in fiction, <lb/>
biography, or history. The fact is daily borne in upon <lb/>
me, that the average shore-employment requires as much as <lb/>
forty years to equip a man with this sort of an education. <lb/>
When I say I am still profiting by this thing, I do not mean <lb/>
that it has constituted me a judge of men&mdash;no, it has not <lb/>
done that; for judges of men are born, not made. My profit <lb/>
is various in kind and degree; but the feature of it which I <lb/>
value most is the zest which that early experience has given <lb/>
to my later reading. When I find a well-drawn character in <lb/>
fiction or biography, I generally take a warm personal <reg orig="inter-|est">interest</reg> <lb/>
in him, for the reason that I have known him before&mdash; <lb/>
met him on the river.</p>
<p>The figure that comes before me oftenest, out of the <reg orig="shad-|ows">shadows</reg> <lb/>
of that vanished time, is that of Brown, of the steamer <lb/>
"Pennsylvania"&mdash;the man referred to in a former chapter, <lb/>

tyrant. I early got the habit of coming on watch with dread <lb/>
at my heart. No matter how good a time I might have been <lb/>
having with the off-watch below, <lb/>
and no matter how high my <reg orig="spir-|its">spirits</reg> <lb/>
might be when I started aloft, <lb/>
my soul became lead in my body <lb/>
the moment I approached the <lb/>
pilot-house.</p>
<p>I still remember the first time <lb/>
I ever entered the presence of <lb/>
that man. The boat had backed <lb/>
out from St. Louis and was <lb/>
"straightening down;" I <reg orig="ascend-|ed">ascended</reg> <lb/>
to the pilot-house in high <lb/>
feather, and very proud to be <lb/>
semi-officially a member of the <lb/>
executive family of so fast and <lb/>
famous a boat. Brown was at <lb/>
the wheel. I paused in the <reg orig="mid-|dle">middle</reg> <lb/>
of the room, all fixed to make <lb/>
my bow, but Brown did not look <lb/>
around. I thought he took a <lb/>
furtive glance at me out of the <lb/>
corner of his eye, but as not even <lb/>
this notice was repeated, I judged <lb/>
I had been mistaken. By this time he was picking his way <lb/>
among some dangerous "breaks" abreast the wood-yards; <lb/>
therefore it would not be proper to interrupt him; so I <lb/>
stepped softly to the high bench and took a seat.</p>

</figure>
<p>There was silence for ten minutes; then my new boss <lb/>
turned and inspected me deliberately and painstakingly <lb/>
from head to heel for about&mdash;as it seemed to me&mdash;a <reg orig="quar-|ter">quarter</reg> <lb/>
of an hour. After which he removed his countenance <lb/>
and I saw it no more for some seconds; then it came around <lb/>
once more, and this question greeted me:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Are you Horace Bigsby's cub?"</p>
<pb n="219" entity="DSSR_000002932_0222"/>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>After this there was a pause and another inspection. <lb/>
Then:</p>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>I told him. He <reg orig="repeat-|ed">repeated</reg> <lb/>
it after me. It was <lb/>
probably the only <lb/>
thing he ever <reg orig="for-|got">forgot</reg>; <lb/>
for although <lb/>
I was with him <lb/>
many months <lb/>
he never <reg orig="ad-|dressed">addressed</reg> <lb/>
<reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
to me in <lb/>
any other way <lb/>
than "Here!" <lb/>
and then his <lb/>
command <lb/>
followed.</p>
<p>"Where <lb/>
was you <lb/>
born?"</p>
<p>"In <reg orig="Flori-|da">Florida</reg>, <lb/>
Missouri."</p>
<p>A pause. <lb/>
Then:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Dern sight <lb/>

</figure>
<p>By means of <lb/>
a dozen or so of pretty direct questions, he pumped my <lb/>
family history out of me.</p>
<p>The leads were going now, in the first crossing. This <lb/>
interrupted the inquest. When the leads had been laid in, <lb/>
he resumed:&mdash;</p>
<p>"How long you been on the river?"</p>
<pb n="220" entity="DSSR_000002932_0223"/>
<p>I told him. After a pause:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Where'd you get them shoes?"</p>
<p>I gave him the <reg orig="in-|formation">information</reg>.</p>
<p>"Hold up your <lb/>
foot!"</p>
<p>I did so. He <lb/>
stepped back, <reg orig="ex-|amined">examined</reg> <lb/>

and returned to his <lb/>

</figure>
<p>What occasion <lb/>
there was to be dod <lb/>
derned about it is a <lb/>
thing which is still <lb/>
as much of a <reg orig="mys-|tery">mystery</reg> <lb/>
to me now as it <lb/>

minutes&mdash;fifteen <reg orig="min-|utes">minutes</reg> <lb/>
of dull, <reg orig="home-|sick">homesick</reg> <lb/>
silence&mdash;before <lb/>
that long horse-face <lb/>
swung round upon me <lb/>
again&mdash;and then, what <lb/>
a change! It was as red as fire, and every muscle in it was <lb/>
working. Now came this shriek:</p>
<pb n="221" entity="DSSR_000002932_0224"/>
<p>"Here!&mdash;You going to set there all day?"</p>
<p>I lit in the middle of the floor; shot there by the electric <lb/>
suddenness of the surprise. As soon <lb/>
as I could get my voice I said, <lb/>
apologetically:&mdash;"I have had no <lb/>
orders, sir."</p>
<p>"You've had <lb/>

<hi rend="italic">ders!</hi> G' way from the wheel!" <lb/>
(I had approached it without <lb/>
knowing it.)</p>
<p>I moved back a step or two, <lb/>
and stood as in a dream, all my <lb/>
senses stupefied by this frantic <lb/>
assault.</p>
<figure id="f112" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0224">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"take that ice pitcher."</hi></head>

<p>"What you standing there <lb/>

all day about it!"</p>
<pb n="222" entity="DSSR_000002932_0225"/>
<p>The moment I got back to the pilot-house, Brown said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Here! What was you doing down there all this time?"</p>
<p>"I could n't find the texas-tender; I had to go all the way <lb/>
to the pantry."</p>
<p>"Derned likely story! Fill up the stove."</p>
<p>I proceeded to do so. He watched me like a cat. Presently <lb/>
he shouted:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Put down that shovel! <reg orig="Dernd-|est">Derndest</reg> <lb/>
numskull I ever saw&mdash;ain't even <lb/>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">"pull her down!"</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>All through the watch this sort <lb/>
of thing went on. Yes, and the <reg orig="subse-|quent">subsequent</reg> <lb/>
watches were much like it, <lb/>
during a stretch of months. As I <lb/>
have said, I soon got the habit of <reg orig="com-|ing">coming</reg> <lb/>
on duty with dread. The <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
I was in the presence, even in the darkest night, I <lb/>
could feel those yellow eyes upon me, and knew their owner <lb/>
<pb n="223" entity="DSSR_000002932_0226"/>
was watching for a pretext to spit out some venom on me. <lb/>
Preliminarily he would say:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Here! Take the wheel."</p>
<p>Two minutes later:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Where</hi> in the nation you going to? Pull her down! <lb/>
pull her down!"</p>
<p>After another moment:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Say! You going to hold her all day? Let her go&mdash; <lb/>
meet her! meet her!"</p>
<p>Then he would jump from the bench, snatch the wheel <lb/>
from me, and meet her himself, pouring out wrath upon me <lb/>
all the time.</p>
<p>George Ritchie was the other pilot's cub. He was having <lb/>
good times now; for his boss, George Ealer, was as <reg orig="kind-|hearted">kind-hearted</reg> <lb/>
as Brown was n't. Ritchie had steered for Brown <lb/>
the season before; consequently he knew exactly how to <lb/>
entertain himself and plague me, all by the one operation. <lb/>
Whenever I took the wheel for a moment on Ealer's watch, <lb/>
Ritchie would sit back on the bench and play Brown, with <lb/>
continual ejaculations of "Snatch her! snatch her! <reg orig="Dernd-|est">Derndest</reg> <lb/>
mud-cat I ever saw!" "Here! Where you going <hi rend="italic">now?</hi> <lb/>
Going to run over that snag?" "Pull her <hi rend="italic">down!</hi> Don't <lb/>
you hear me? Pull her <hi rend="italic">down!</hi>" "There she goes! <hi rend="italic">Just</hi> <lb/>
as I expected! I <hi rend="italic">told</hi> you not to cramp that reef. G' way <lb/>
from the wheel!"</p>
<p>So I always had a rough time of it, no matter whose <lb/>
watch it was; and sometimes it seemed to me that Ritchie's <lb/>
good-natured badgering was pretty nearly as aggravating as <lb/>
Brown's dead-earnest nagging.</p>
<p>I often wanted to kill Brown, but this would not answer. <lb/>
A cub had to take everything his boss gave, in the way of <lb/>
vigorous comment and criticism; and we all believed that <lb/>
there was a United States law making it a penitentiary <lb/>
offence to strike or threaten a pilot who was on duty. <lb/>
However, I could <hi rend="italic">imagine</hi> myself killing Brown; there was <lb/>
no law against that; and that was the thing I used always <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="DSSR_000002932_0227"/>
to do the moment I was abed. Instead of going over my <lb/>
river in my mind as was my duty, I threw business aside <lb/>
for pleasure, and killed Brown. I killed Brown every night <lb/>
for months; not in old, stale, commonplace ways, but in <lb/>
new and picturesque ones,&mdash;ways that were sometimes <reg orig="sur-|prising">surprising</reg> <lb/>
for freshness of design and ghastliness of situation <lb/>
and environment.</p>
<p>Brown was <hi rend="italic">always</hi> watching for a pretext to find fault; <lb/>
and if he could find no plausible pretext, he would invent <lb/>
one. He would scold you for shaving a shore, and for not <lb/>
shaving it; <lb/>
for hugging <lb/>
a bar, and <lb/>
for not <reg orig="hug-|ging">hugging</reg> <lb/>
it; for <lb/>
"pulling down" when not invited, and for <hi rend="italic">not</hi> pulling down <lb/>
when not invited; for firing up without orders, and for <reg orig="wait-|ing">waiting</reg> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">for</hi> orders. In a word, it was his invariable rule to <lb/>
find fault with <hi rend="italic">everything</hi> you did; and another invariable <lb/>
rule of his was to throw all his remarks (to you) into the <lb/>
form of an insult.</p>
<figure id="f114" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0227">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"i killed brown every night."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>One day we were approaching New Madrid, bound down <lb/>
and heavily laden. Brown was at one side of the wheel, <lb/>
steering; I was at the other, standing by to "pull down" or <lb/>
<pb n="225" entity="DSSR_000002932_0228"/>
"shove up." He cast a furtive glance at me every now and <lb/>
then. I had long ago learned what that meant; viz., he <lb/>
was trying to invent a trap for me. I wondered what shape <lb/>
it was going to take. By and by he stepped back from the <lb/>
wheel and said in his usual snarly way:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Here!&mdash;See if you've got gumption enough to round <lb/>
her to."</p>
<p>This was simply <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> to be a success; nothing could <lb/>
prevent it; for he had never allowed me to round the boat <lb/>
to before; consequently, no matter <lb/>
how I might do the thing, he could <lb/>
find free fault with it. He stood <lb/>
back there with his greedy eye on <lb/>
me, and the result <lb/>
was what might <lb/>
have been foreseen: <lb/>
I lost my head in a <lb/>
quarter of a minute, <lb/>
and did n't know <lb/>
what I was about; <lb/>
I started too early <lb/>
to bring the boat <lb/>
around, but detected <lb/>
a green gleam of <lb/>
joy in Brown's eye, <lb/>
and corrected my <lb/>
mistake; I started <lb/>
around once more <lb/>
while too high up, <lb/>
but corrected myself <lb/>
again in time; I <lb/>
made other false <lb/>
moves, and still managed to save myself; but at last I grew <lb/>
so confused and anxious that I tumbled into the very <lb/>
worst blunder of all&mdash;I got too far <hi rend="italic">down</hi> before beginning <lb/>
to fetch the boat around. Brown's chance was come.</p>
<figure id="f115" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0228">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"hurled me across the house."</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="226" entity="DSSR_000002932_0229"/>
<p>His face turned red with passion; he made one bound, <lb/>
hurled me across the house with a sweep of his arm, spun <lb/>
the wheel down, and began to pour out a stream of <reg orig="vituper-|ation">vituperation</reg> <lb/>
upon me which lasted till he was out of breath. In the <lb/>
course of this speech he called me all the different kinds of <lb/>
hard names he could think of, and once or twice I thought he <lb/>
was even going to swear&mdash;but he had never done that, and <lb/>
he did n't this time. "Dod dern" was the nearest he <reg orig="ven-|tured">ventured</reg> <lb/>
to the luxury of swearing, for he had been brought up <lb/>
with a wholesome respect for future fire and brimstone.</p>
<p>That was an uncomfortable hour; for there was a big <lb/>
audience on the hurricane deck. When I went to bed that <lb/>
night, I killed Brown in seventeen different ways&mdash;all of <lb/>
them new.</p>

<head>BROWN AND I EXCHANGE COMPLIMENTS.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Two</hi> trips later, I got into serious trouble. Brown was <lb/>
steering; I was "pulling down." My younger brother <lb/>
appeared on the hurricane deck, and shouted to Brown to <lb/>
stop at some landing or other a mile or so below. Brown <lb/>
gave no intimation that he had heard anything. But that <lb/>
was his way: he never condescended to take notice of an <lb/>
under clerk. The wind was blowing; Brown was deaf <lb/>
(although he always pretended he was n't), and I very much <lb/>
doubted if he had heard the order. If I had had two heads, <lb/>
I would have spoken; but as I had only one, it seemed <reg orig="judi-|cious">judicious</reg> <lb/>
to take care of it; so I kept still.</p>
<p>Presently, sure enough, we went sailing by that plantation. <lb/>
Captain Klinefelter appeared on the deck, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Let her come around, sir, let her come around. Did n't <lb/>
Henry tell you to land here?"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">No,</hi> sir!"</p>
<p>"I sent him up to do it."</p>
<p>"He <hi rend="italic">did</hi> come up; and that's all the good it done, the <lb/>
dod-derned fool. He never said anything."</p>
<p>"Did n't <hi rend="italic">you</hi> hear him?" asked the captain of me.</p>
<p>Of course I did n't want to be mixed up in this business, <lb/>
but there was no way to avoid it; so I said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>I knew what Brown's next remark would be, before he <lb/>
uttered it; it was:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Shut your mouth! you never heard anything of the <lb/>
kind."</p>
<pb n="228" entity="DSSR_000002932_0231"/>
<p>I closed my mouth according to instructions. An hour <lb/>
later, Henry entered the pilot-house, unaware of what had <lb/>
been going on. He was a thoroughly inoffensive boy, and I <lb/>
was sorry to see him come, for I knew Brown would have <lb/>
no pity on him. Brown began, straightway:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Here! why did n't you tell me we'd got to land at that <lb/>
plantation?"</p>
<p>"I did tell you, Mr. Brown."</p>
<p>"It's a lie!"</p>
<p>I said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You lie, yourself. He did tell you."</p>
<p>Brown glared at me in unaffected surprise; and for as <lb/>
much as a moment he was entirely speechless; then he <lb/>
shouted to me:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I'll attend to your case in a half a minute!" then to <lb/>
Henry, "And you leave the pilot-house; out with you!"</p>
<p>It was pilot law, and must be obeyed. The boy started <lb/>
out, and even had his foot on the upper step outside the <lb/>
door, when Brown, with a sudden access of fury, picked up <lb/>
a ten-pound lump of coal and sprang after him; but I was <lb/>
between, with a heavy stool, and I hit Brown a good honest <lb/>
blow which stretched him out.</p>
<p>I had committed the crime of crimes,&mdash;I had lifted my <lb/>
hand against a pilot on duty! I supposed I was booked for <lb/>
the penitentiary sure, and could n't be booked any surer if <lb/>
I went on and squared my long account with this person <lb/>
while I had the chance; consequently I stuck to him and <lb/>
pounded him with my fists a considerable time,&mdash;I do not <lb/>
know how long, the pleasure of it probably made it seem <lb/>
longer than it really was;&mdash;but in the end he struggled free <lb/>
and jumped up and sprang to the wheel: a very natural <lb/>
solicitude, for, all this time, here was this steamboat tearing <lb/>
down the river at the rate of fifteen miles an hour and <lb/>
nobody at the helm! However, Eagle Bend was two miles <lb/>
wide at this bank-full stage, and correspondingly long and <lb/>
deep; and the boat was steering herself straight down the <lb/>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">"the racket had brought everybody to the deck."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Perceiving, at a glance, that the "Pennsylvania" was in <lb/>
no danger, Brown gathered up the big spy-glass, war-club <lb/>
fashion, and ordered me out of the pilot-house with more <lb/>
than Comanche bluster. But I was not afraid of him now; <lb/>
so, instead of going, I tarried, and criticised his grammar; I <lb/>
reformed his ferocious speeches for him, and put them into <lb/>
good English, calling his attention to the advantage of pure <lb/>
English over the bastard dialect of the Pennsylvanian <reg orig="col-|lieries">collieries</reg> <lb/>
whence he was extracted. He could have done his <lb/>
part to admiration in a cross-fire of mere vituperation, of <lb/>
course; but he was not equipped for this species of <reg orig="contro-|versy">controversy</reg>; <lb/>
so he presently laid aside his glass and took the <lb/>
<pb n="232" entity="DSSR_000002932_0235"/>
wheel, muttering and shaking his head; and I retired to <lb/>
the bench. The racket had brought everybody to the <reg orig="hur-|ricane">hurricane</reg> <lb/>
deck, and I trembled when I saw the old captain <lb/>
looking up from the midst of the crowd. I said to myself, <lb/>
"Now I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> done for!"&mdash;For although, as a rule, he was <lb/>
so fatherly and indulgent toward the boat's family, and so <lb/>
patient of minor <lb/>
shortcomings, he <lb/>
could be stern <lb/>
enough when the <lb/>
fault was worth it.</p>
<p>I tried to imagine <lb/>
what he <hi rend="italic">would</hi> do <lb/>
to a cub pilot who <lb/>
had been guilty of <lb/>
such a crime as <lb/>
mine, committed on <lb/>
a boat guard-deep <lb/>
with costly freight <lb/>
and alive with <reg orig="pas-|sengers">passengers</reg>. <lb/>
Our watch <lb/>
was nearly ended. <lb/>
I thought I would <lb/>
go and hide <reg orig="some-|where">somewhere</reg> <lb/>
till I got a <lb/>
chance to slide <lb/>
ashore. So I slipped <lb/>
out of the <reg orig="pilot-|house">pilothouse</reg>, <lb/>
and down <lb/>
the steps, and around to the texas door,&mdash;and was in the <lb/>
act of gliding within, when the captain confronted me! <lb/>
I dropped my head, and he stood over me in silence a <lb/>
moment or two, then said impressively,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Follow me."</p>
<figure id="f119" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0235">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"so you have been fighting."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>I dropped into his wake; he led the way to his parlor in <lb/>
the forward end of the texas. We were alone, now. He <lb/>
<pb n="233" entity="DSSR_000002932_0236"/>
closed the after door; then moved slowly to the forward one <lb/>
and closed that. He sat down; I stood before him. He <lb/>
looked at me some little time, then said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"So you have been fighting Mr. Brown?"</p>
<p>I answered meekly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Do you know that that is a very serious matter?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Are you aware that this boat was ploughing down the <lb/>
river fully five minutes with no one at the wheel?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Did you strike him first?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"What with?"</p>
<p>"A stool, sir."</p>
<p>"Hard?"</p>
<p>"Middling, sir."</p>
<p>"Did it knock him down?"</p>
<p>"He&mdash;he fell, sir."</p>
<p>"Did you follow it up? Did you do anything further?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"What did you do?"</p>
<p>"Pounded him, sir."</p>
<p>"Pounded him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Did you pound him much?&mdash;that is, severely?"</p>
<p>"One might call it that, sir, maybe."</p>
<p>"I'm deuc&eacute;d glad of it! Hark ye, never mention that I <lb/>
said that. You have been guilty of a great crime; and don't <lb/>
you ever be guilty of it again, on this boat. <hi rend="italic">But</hi>&mdash;lay for <lb/>
him ashore! Give him a good sound thrashing, do you hear? <lb/>
I'll pay the expenses. Now go&mdash;and mind you, not a word <lb/>
of this to anybody. Clear out with you!&mdash;you've been <lb/>
guilty of a great crime, you whelp!"</p>
<p>I slid out, happy with the sense of a close shave and <lb/>
a mighty deliverance; and I heard him laughing to <lb/>
<pb n="234" entity="DSSR_000002932_0237"/>
himself and slapping his fat thighs after I had closed his <lb/>
door.</p>
<p>When Brown came off watch he went straight to the <reg orig="cap-|tain">captain</reg>, <lb/>
who was talking with some passengers on the boiler <lb/>

and added:&mdash;</p>

resumed his talk with the passengers.</p>
<p>During the brief remainder of the trip, I knew how an <lb/>
emancipated slave feels; for I was an emancipated slave <lb/>
myself. While we lay at landings, I listened to George <lb/>
Ealer's flute; or to his readings from his two bibles, that <lb/>
is to say, Goldsmith and Shakspeare; or I played chess <lb/>
with him&mdash;and would have beaten him sometimes, only <lb/>
he always took back his last move and ran the game out <lb/>
differently.</p>

<head>A CATASTROPHE.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> lay three days in New Orleans, but the captain did <lb/>
not succeed in finding another pilot; so he proposed <lb/>
that I should stand a daylight watch, and leave the night <lb/>
watches to George Ealer. But I was afraid; I had never <lb/>
stood a watch of any sort by myself, and I believed I should <lb/>
be sure to get into trouble in the head of some chute, or <lb/>
ground the boat in a near cut through some bar or other. <lb/>
Brown remained in his place; but he would not travel with <lb/>
me. So the captain gave me an order on the captain of the <lb/>
"A. T. Lacey," for a passage to St. Louis, and said he would <lb/>
find a new pilot there and my steersman's berth could then <lb/>
be resumed. The "Lacey" was to leave a couple of days <lb/>
after the "Pennsylvania."</p>
<p>The night before the "Pennsylvania" left, Henry and I sat <lb/>
chatting on a freight pile on the levee till midnight. The <lb/>
subject of the chat, mainly, was one which I think we had <lb/>
not exploited before&mdash;steamboat disasters. One was then <lb/>
on its way to us, little as we suspected it; the water which <lb/>
was to make the steam which should cause it, was washing <lb/>
past some point fifteen hundred miles up the river while we <lb/>
talked;&mdash;but it would arrive at the right time and the right <lb/>
place. We doubted if persons not clothed with authority <lb/>
were of much use in cases of disaster and attendant panic; <lb/>
still, they might be of <hi rend="italic">some</hi> use; so we decided that if a <reg orig="dis-|aster">disaster</reg> <lb/>
ever fell within our experience we would at least stick <lb/>
to the boat, and give such minor service as chance might <lb/>
throw in the way. Henry remembered this, afterward, when <lb/>
the disaster came, and acted accordingly.</p>
<pb n="237" entity="DSSR_000002932_0240"/>
<p>The "Lacey" started up the river two days behind the <lb/>
"Pennsylvania." We touched at Greenville, Mississippi, a <lb/>
couple of days out, and somebody shouted:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The 'Pennsylvania' is blown up at Ship Island, and a <lb/>
hundred and fifty lives lost!"</p>
<p>At Napoleon, Arkansas, the same evening, we got an <lb/>
extra, issued by a Memphis paper, which gave some <reg orig="particu-|lars">particulars</reg>. <lb/>
It <reg orig="men-|tioned">mentioned</reg> <lb/>
my <reg orig="broth-|er">brother</reg>, <lb/>
and said he <lb/>
was not hurt.</p>
<p>Further up the <lb/>
river we got a <lb/>
later extra. My <lb/>
brother was again <lb/>
mentioned; but <lb/>
this time as <reg orig="be-|ing">being</reg> <lb/>
hurt beyond <lb/>
help. We did <lb/>
not get full <reg orig="de-|tails">details</reg> <lb/>
of the <reg orig="catas-|trophe">catastrophe</reg> <lb/>
until we <lb/>
reached <reg orig="Mem-|phis">Memphis</reg>. <lb/>

<p>It was six o'clock on <lb/>
a hot summer morning. <lb/>
The "Pennsylvania" was <lb/>
creeping along, north of <lb/>
Ship Island, about sixty <lb/>
miles below Memphis on <lb/>
a half-head of steam, <reg orig="tow-|ing">towing</reg> <lb/>
a wood-flat which was fast being emptied. George Ealer <lb/>
was in the pilot-house&mdash;alone, I think; the second engineer <lb/>
and a striker had the watch in the engine room; the second <lb/>
mate had the watch on deck; George Black, Mr. Wood, and <lb/>
<pb n="238" entity="DSSR_000002932_0241"/>
my brother, clerks, were asleep, as were also Brown and the <lb/>
head engineer, the carpenter, the chief mate, and one striker; <lb/>
Capt. Klinefelter was in the barber's chair, and the barber <lb/>
was preparing to shave him. There were a <lb/>
good many cabin passengers aboard, and <lb/>
three or four hundred deck passengers&mdash; <lb/>
so it was said at the time&mdash;and not very <lb/>
many of them were astir. The wood being <lb/>
nearly all out of the flat now, Ealer rang to "come ahead" <lb/>
full steam, and the next moment four of the eight boilers <lb/>
exploded with a thunderous crash, and the whole forward <lb/>
third of the boat was hoisted toward the sky! The main <lb/>

with the <reg orig="chim-|neys">chimneys</reg>, <lb/>
dropped <reg orig="up-|on">upon</reg> <lb/>

<p>Many people were flung <lb/>
to considerable distances, <lb/>
and fell in the river; <lb/>
among these were Mr. <lb/>
Wood and my brother, <lb/>
and the carpenter. The <lb/>
carpenter was still <lb/>
stretched upon his <reg orig="mat-|tress">mattress</reg> <lb/>
when he struck the <lb/>
water seventy-five feet <lb/>
from the boat. Brown, <lb/>
the pilot, and George <lb/>

vacancy&mdash;everything forward of it, floor and all, had <reg orig="dis-|appeared">disappeared</reg>; <lb/>
and the stupefied barber, who was also unhurt, <lb/>

<p>When George <lb/>
Ealer saw the <reg orig="chim-|neys">chimneys</reg> <lb/>
plunging aloft <lb/>
in front of him, he <lb/>
knew what the <reg orig="mat-|ter">matter</reg> <lb/>
was; so he <reg orig="muf-|fled">muffled</reg> <lb/>
his face in the <lb/>
lapels of his coat, <lb/>
and pressed both <lb/>
hands there tightly <lb/>
to keep this <reg orig="protec-|tion">protection</reg> <lb/>
in its place so <lb/>
that no steam could <lb/>
get to his nose or <lb/>
mouth. He had <reg orig="am-|ple">ample</reg> <lb/>
time to attend to <lb/>
these details while he <lb/>
was going up and <lb/>
returning. He <reg orig="pres-|ently">presently</reg> <lb/>
landed on top <lb/>
of the unexploded <lb/>
boilers, forty feet <reg orig="be-|low">below</reg> <lb/>
the former <reg orig="pilot-|house">pilothouse</reg>, <lb/>
accompanied <lb/>
by his wheel and a rain of other stuff, and enveloped in a <lb/>
cloud of scalding steam. All of the many who breathed that <lb/>
steam, died; none escaped. But Ealer breathed none of it. <lb/>
<pb n="241" entity="DSSR_000002932_0244"/>
He made his way to the free air as quickly as he could; and <lb/>
when the steam cleared away he returned and climbed up <lb/>
on the boilers again, and patiently hunted out each and every <lb/>
one of his chessmen and the several joints of his flute.</p>
<p>By this time the fire was beginning to threaten. Shrieks <lb/>
and groans filled the air. A great many persons had been <lb/>
scalded, a great many crippled; the explosion had driven an <lb/>
iron crowbar through one man's body&mdash;I think they said he <lb/>
was a priest. He did not die at once, and his sufferings <lb/>
were very dreadful. A young French naval cadet, of <reg orig="fif-|teen">fifteen</reg>, <lb/>
son of a French admiral, was fearfully scalded, but <lb/>
bore his tortures manfully. Both mates were badly scalded, <lb/>
but they stood to their posts, nevertheless. They drew the <lb/>
wood-boat aft, and they and the captain fought back the <lb/>
frantic herd of frightened immigrants till the wounded could <lb/>
be brought there and placed in safety first.</p>
<p>When Mr. Wood and Henry fell in the water, they struck <lb/>
out for shore, which was only a few hundred yards away; <lb/>
but Henry presently said he believed he was not hurt, (what <lb/>
an unaccountable error!) and therefore would swim back to <lb/>
the boat and help save the wounded. So they parted, and <lb/>
Henry returned.</p>
<p>By this time the fire was making fierce headway, and <lb/>
several persons who were imprisoned under the ruins were <lb/>
begging piteously for help. All efforts to conquer the fire <lb/>
proved fruitless; so the buckets were presently thrown aside <lb/>
and the officers fell-to with axes and tried to cut the <reg orig="pris-|oners">prisoners</reg> <lb/>
out. A striker was one of the captives; he said he <lb/>
was not injured, but could not free himself; and when <lb/>
he saw that the fire was likely to drive away the workers, he <lb/>
begged that some one would shoot him, and thus save him <lb/>
from the more dreadful death. The fire did drive the <reg orig="axe-|men">axemen</reg> <lb/>
away, and they had to listen, helpless, to this poor <reg orig="fel-|low's">fellow's</reg> <lb/>
supplications till the flames ended his miseries.</p>
<p>The fire drove all into the wood-flat that could be <reg orig="accom-|modated">accommodated</reg> <lb/>
there; it was cut adrift, then, and it and the <reg orig="burn-|ing">burning</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="242" entity="DSSR_000002932_0245"/>
steamer floated down the river toward Ship Island. <lb/>
They moored the flat at the head of the island, and there, <lb/>
unsheltered from the blazing sun, the half-naked occupants <lb/>
had to remain, without food or stimulants, or help for <lb/>
their hurts, during the rest of the day. A steamer came <lb/>
along, finally, and carried the unfortunates to Memphis, <lb/>
and there the most lavish assistance was at once <reg orig="forth-|coming">forthcoming</reg>. <lb/>
By this time Henry was insensible. The <reg orig="physi-|cians">physicians</reg> <lb/>
examined his injuries and saw that they were fatal,</p>
<figure id="f127" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0245">

</figure>
<pb n="243" entity="DSSR_000002932_0246"/>
<p>and naturally turned their main attention to patients who <lb/>
could be saved.</p>
<p>Forty of the wounded were placed upon pallets on the <lb/>
floor of a great public hall, and among these was Henry. <lb/>
There the ladies of Memphis came every day, with flowers, <lb/>
fruits, and dainties and delicacies of all kinds, and there <lb/>
they remained and nursed the wounded. All the physicians <lb/>
stood watches there, and all the medical students; and the <lb/>
rest of the town furnished money, or whatever else was <lb/>
wanted. And Memphis knew how to do all these things <lb/>
well; for many a disaster like the "Pennsylvania's" had <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg> <lb/>
near her doors, and she was experienced, above all <lb/>
other cities on the river, in the gracious office of the Good <lb/>
Samaritan.</p>
<p>The sight I saw when I entered that large hall was new <lb/>
and strange to me. Two long rows of prostrate forms&mdash; <lb/>
more than forty, in all&mdash;and every face and head a <reg orig="shape-|less">shapeless</reg> <lb/>
wad of loose raw cotton. It was a grewsome spectacle. <lb/>
I watched there six days and nights, and a very melancholy <lb/>
experience it was. There was one daily incident which was <lb/>
peculiarly depressing: this was the removal of the doomed <lb/>
to a chamber apart. It was done in order that the <hi rend="italic">morale</hi> <lb/>
of the other patients might not be injuriously affected by <lb/>
seeing one of their number in the death-agony. The fated <lb/>
one was always carried out with as little stir as possible, <lb/>
and the stretcher was always hidden from sight by a wall <lb/>
of assistants; but no matter: everybody knew what that <lb/>
cluster of bent forms, with its muffled step and its slow <lb/>
movement meant; and all eyes watched it wistfully, and a <lb/>
shudder went abreast of it like a wave.</p>
<p>I saw many poor fellows removed to the "death-room," <lb/>
and saw them no more afterward. But I saw our chief mate <lb/>
carried thither more than once. His hurts were frightful, <lb/>
especially his scalds. He was clothed in linseed oil and raw <lb/>
cotton to his waist, and resembled nothing human. He was <lb/>
often out of his mind; and then his pains would make him <lb/>
<pb n="244" entity="DSSR_000002932_0247"/>
rave and shout and sometimes shriek. Then, after a period <lb/>
of dumb exhaustion, his disordered imagination would <reg orig="sud-|denly">suddenly</reg> <lb/>
transform the great apartment into a forecastle, and <lb/>
the hurrying throng of nurses into the crew; and he would <lb/>
come to a sitting posture <lb/>
and shout, "Hump <reg orig="your-|selves">yourselves</reg>, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">hump</hi> yourselves, <lb/>
you petrifactions, snail-bellies, pall-bearers! going to be all <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">day</hi> getting that hatful of freight out?" and supplement <lb/>
this explosion with a firmament-obliterating irruption of <lb/>
profanity which nothing could stay or stop till his crater <lb/>
was empty. And now and then while these frenzies pos-</p>

<p>sessed him, he would tear off handfuls of the cotton and <lb/>
expose his cooked flesh to view. It was horrible. It <lb/>
was bad for the others, of course&mdash;this noise and these <lb/>
exhibitions; so the doctors tried to give him morphine to <lb/>
quiet him. But, in his mind or out of it, he would not take <lb/>
it. He said his wife had been killed by that treacherous <lb/>
drug, and he would die before he would take it. He <reg orig="sus-|pected">suspected</reg> <lb/>
that the doctors were concealing it in his ordinary <lb/>
medicines and in his water&mdash;so he ceased from putting <lb/>
either to his lips. Once, when he had been without water <lb/>
during two sweltering days, he took the dipper in his hand, <lb/>
and the sight of the limpid fluid, and the misery of his <lb/>
thirst, tempted him almost beyond his strength; but he <lb/>
mastered himself and threw it away, and after that he <lb/>
allowed no more to be brought near him. Three times I <lb/>
saw him carried to the death-room, insensible and supposed <lb/>
to be dying; but each time he revived, cursed his <reg orig="attend-|ants">attendants</reg>, <lb/>
and demanded to be taken back. He lived to be mate <lb/>
of a steamboat again.</p>
<p>But he was the only one who went to the death-room and <lb/>
returned alive. Dr. Peyton, a principal physician, and rich <lb/>
in all the attributes that go to constitute high and flawless <lb/>
character, did all that educated judgment and trained skill <lb/>
could do for Henry; but, as the newspapers had said in the <lb/>
beginning, his hurts were past help. On the evening of the <lb/>
sixth day his wandering mind busied itself with matters <lb/>
far away, and his nerveless fingers "picked at his coverlet." <lb/>
His hour had struck; we bore him to the death-room, poor <lb/>
boy.</p>

<head>I RETURN TO MY MUTTONS.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">After</hi> twenty-one years' absence, I felt a very strong <lb/>
desire to see the river again, and the steamboats, and <lb/>
such of the boys as might be left; so I resolved to go out <lb/>
there. I enlisted a poet for company, and a stenographer <lb/>
to "take him down," and started westward about the middle <lb/>
of April.</p>
<p>As I proposed to make notes, with a view to printing, I <lb/>
took some thought as to methods of procedure. I reflected <lb/>
that if I were recognized, on the river, I should not be as <lb/>
free to go and come, talk, inquire, and spy around, as I should <lb/>
be if unknown; I remembered that it was the custom of <lb/>
steamboatmen in the old times to load up the confiding <lb/>
stranger with the most picturesque and admirable lies, and <lb/>
put the sophisticated friend off with dull and ineffectual facts: <lb/>
so I concluded, that, from a business point of view, it would <lb/>
be an advantage to disguise our party with fictitious names. <lb/>
The idea was certainly good, but it bred infinite bother; <lb/>
for although Smith, Jones, and Johnson are easy names to <lb/>
remember when there is no occasion to remember them, it is <lb/>
next to impossible to recollect them when they are wanted. <lb/>
How do criminals manage to keep a brand-new <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> in <lb/>
mind? This is a great mystery. I was innocent; and yet <lb/>
was seldom able to lay my hand on my new name when it <lb/>
was needed; and it seemed to me that if I had had a crime <lb/>
on my conscience to further confuse me, I could never have <lb/>
kept the name by me at all.</p>

<p>I find that among my notes. It makes no difference <lb/>
which direction you take, the fact remains the same. Whether <lb/>
you move north, south, east, or west, no matter: you can get <lb/>
up in the morning and guess how far you have come, by <lb/>
noting what degree of grace and picturesqueness is by that <lb/>
time lacking in the costumes of the new passengers;&mdash;I do <lb/>
not mean of the women alone, but of both sexes. It may be <lb/>
that <hi rend="italic">carriage</hi> is at the bottom of this thing; and I think it <lb/>
is; for there are plenty of ladies and gentlemen in the <lb/>
provincial cities whose garments are all made by the best <lb/>
tailors and dressmakers of New York; yet this has no <lb/>
perceptible effect upon the grand fact: the educated eye <lb/>
never mistakes those people for New-Yorkers. No, there is <lb/>
a godless grace, and snap, and style about a born and bred <lb/>
New-Yorker which mere clothing cannot effect.</p>

have a week in St. Louis. The Southern was a good hotel, <lb/>
and we could have had a comfortable time there. It is <lb/>
large, and well conducted, and its decorations do not <lb/>
make one cry, as do those of the vast Palmer House, in <lb/>
Chicago. True, the billiard-tables were of the Old Silurian <lb/>
Period, and the cues and balls of the Post-Pliocene; but <lb/>
there was refreshment in this, not discomfort; for there is <lb/>
rest and healing in the contemplation of antiquities.</p>
<pb n="251" entity="DSSR_000002932_0254"/>
<p>The most notable absence observable in the billiard room, <lb/>
was the absence of the river man. If he was there he had <lb/>
taken in his sign, he was in disguise. I saw there none of the <lb/>
swell airs and graces, and ostentatious displays of money, and <lb/>
pompous squanderings of it, which used to distinguish the <lb/>
steamboat crowd from the dry-land crowd in the bygone days, <lb/>
in the thronged billiard-rooms of <lb/>
St. Louis. In those times, the <reg orig="prin-|cipal">principal</reg> <lb/>
saloons were always populous <lb/>
with river men; given fifty <reg orig="play-|ers">players</reg> <lb/>
present, thirty or thirty-five <lb/>
were likely to be from <lb/>
the river. But I <reg orig="sus-|pected">suspected</reg> <lb/>
that the ranks <lb/>
were thin now, and <lb/>
the steamboatmen no <lb/>
longer an aristocracy. <lb/>
Why, in my time they <lb/>
used to call the "<reg orig="bar-|keep">barkeep</reg>" <lb/>
Bill, or Joe, or <lb/>
Tom, and slap him on <lb/>
the shoulder; I watched <lb/>
for that. But none of <lb/>
these people did it. Manifestly <lb/>
a glory that once was had <reg orig="dis-|solved">dissolved</reg> <lb/>
and vanished away in <lb/>
these twenty-one years.</p>
<figure id="f132" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0254">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"do you drink this slush?"</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>When I went up to my room, <lb/>
I found there the young man <lb/>
called Rogers, crying. Rogers <lb/>
was not his name; neither was Jones, Brown, Dexter, <reg orig="Fergu-|son">Ferguson</reg>, <lb/>
Bascom, nor Thompson; but he answered to either of these <lb/>
that a body found handy in an emergency; or to any other <lb/>
name, in fact, if he perceived that you meant him. He said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What is a person to do here when he wants a drink of <lb/>
water?&mdash;drink this slush?"</p>
<pb n="252" entity="DSSR_000002932_0255"/>
<p>"Can't you drink it?"</p>
<p>"I could if I had some other water to wash it with."</p>
<p>Here was a thing which had not changed; a score of <lb/>
years had not affected this water's mulatto complexion in the <lb/>
least; a score of centuries would succeed no better, perhaps. <lb/>
It comes out of the turbulent, bank-caving Missouri, and <lb/>
every tumblerful of it holds nearly an acre of land in <reg orig="solu-|tion">solution</reg>. <lb/>
I got this fact from the bishop of the diocese. If you <lb/>
will let your glass stand half an hour, you can separate the <lb/>
land from the water as easy as Genesis; and then you will <lb/>
find them both good: the one good to eat, the other good to <lb/>
drink. The land is very nourishing, the water is thoroughly <lb/>
wholesome. The one appeases hunger; the other, thirst. <lb/>
But the natives do not take them separately, but together, <lb/>
as nature mixed them. When they find an inch of mud in <lb/>
the bottom of a glass, they stir it up, and then take the <lb/>
draught as they would gruel. It is difficult for a stranger to <lb/>
get used to this batter, but once used to it he will prefer it <lb/>
to water. This is really the case. It is good for <reg orig="steamboat-|ing">steamboating</reg>, <lb/>
and good to drink; but it is worthless for all other <reg orig="pur-|poses">purposes</reg>, <lb/>
except baptizing.</p>
<p>Next morning, we drove around town in the rain. The <lb/>
city seemed but little changed. It <hi rend="italic">was</hi> greatly changed, but <lb/>
it did not seem so; because in St. Louis, as in London and <lb/>
Pittsburgh, you can't persuade a new thing to look new; the <lb/>
coal smoke turns it into an antiquity the moment you take <lb/>
your hand off it. The place had just about doubled its size, <lb/>
since I was a resident of it, and was now become a city of <lb/>
400,000 inhabitants; still, in the solid business parts, it looked <lb/>
about as it had looked formerly. Yet I am sure there is not <lb/>
as much smoke in St. Louis now as there used to be. The <lb/>
smoke used to bank itself in a dense billowy black canopy over <lb/>
the town, and hide the sky from view. This shelter is very <lb/>
much thinner now; still, there is a sufficiency of smoke <lb/>
there, I think. I heard no complaint.</p>
<p>However, on the outskirts changes were apparent enough; <lb/>
<pb n="253" entity="DSSR_000002932_0256"/>
notably in dwelling-house architecture. The fine new homes <lb/>
are noble and beautiful and modern. They stand by <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>, <lb/>
too, with green lawns around them; whereas the <lb/>
dwellings of a former day are packed together in blocks, <lb/>
and are all of one pattern, with windows all alike, set in an <lb/>
arched frame-work of twisted stone; a sort of house which <lb/>
was handsome enough when it was rarer.</p>
<p>There was another change&mdash;the Forest Park. This was <lb/>
new to me. It is beautiful and very extensive, and has the <lb/>
excellent merit of having been made mainly by nature. <lb/>
There are other parks, and fine ones, notably Tower Grove <lb/>
and the Botanical Gardens; for St. Louis interested <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
in such improvements at an earlier day than did the <lb/>
most of our cities.</p>
<p>The first time I ever saw St. Louis, I could have bought it <lb/>
for six million dollars, and it was the mistake of my life <lb/>
that I did not do it. It was bitter now to look abroad over <lb/>
this domed and steepled metropolis, this solid expanse of <lb/>
bricks and mortar stretching away on every hand into dim, <lb/>
measure-defying distances, and remember that I had allowed <lb/>
that opportunity to go by. Why I should have allowed it to <lb/>
go by seems, of course, foolish and inexplicable to-day, at a <lb/>
first glance; yet there were reasons at the time to justify <lb/>
this course.</p>
<p>A Scotchman, Hon. Charles Augustus Murray, writing <lb/>
some forty-five or fifty years ago, said: "The streets are <lb/>
narrow, ill paved and ill lighted." Those streets are narrow <lb/>
still, of course; many of them are ill paved yet; but the <reg orig="re-|proach">reproach</reg> <lb/>
of ill lighting cannot be repeated, now. The "Catholic <lb/>
New Church" was the only notable building then, and Mr. <lb/>
Murray was confidently called upon to admire it, with its <lb/>
"species of Grecian portico, surmounted by a kind of steeple, <lb/>
much too diminutive in its proportions, and surmounted by <lb/>
sundry ornaments" which the unimaginative Scotchman found <lb/>
himself "quite unable to describe;" and therefore was <reg orig="grate-|ful">grateful</reg> <lb/>
when a German tourist helped him out with the <reg orig="exclama-|tion">exclamation</reg>: <lb/>
<pb n="254" entity="DSSR_000002932_0257"/>
"By&mdash;, they look exactly like bed-posts!" St. Louis <lb/>
is well equipped with stately and noble public buildings now, <lb/>
and the little church, which the people used to be so proud of, <lb/>
lost its importance a long time ago. Still, this would not <reg orig="sur-|prise">surprise</reg> <lb/>
Mr. Murray, if he could come back; for he prophesied <lb/>
the coming greatness of St. Louis with strong confidence.</p>
<p>The further we drove in our inspection-tour, the more <lb/>
sensibly I realized how the city had grown since I had seen <lb/>
it last; changes in detail became steadily more apparent and <lb/>
frequent than at first, too: changes uniformly evidencing <reg orig="pro-|gress">progress</reg>, <lb/>
energy, prosperity.</p>

<p>But the change of changes was on the "levee." This time, <lb/>
a departure from the rule. Half a <lb/>
dozen sound-asleep steamboats where <lb/>
I used to see a solid mile of wide-awake ones! This was <lb/>
melancholy, this was woful. The absence of the pervading <lb/>
and jocund steamboatman from the billiard-saloon was <reg orig="ex-|plained">explained</reg>. <lb/>
He was absent because he is no more. His <reg orig="occu-|pation">occupation</reg> <lb/>

into the common herd, he grinds at the mill, a shorn Samson <lb/>
and inconspicuous. Half a dozen lifeless steamboats, a mile <lb/>

<p>The towboat and the railroad had done their work, and <lb/>
done it well and <reg orig="com-|pletely">completely</reg>. <lb/>
The mighty <lb/>
bridge, stretching along <lb/>
over our heads, had done <lb/>
its share in the slaughter and <lb/>
spoliation. Remains of former <lb/>
<pb n="256" entity="DSSR_000002932_0259"/>
steamboatmen told me, with wan satisfaction, that the bridge <lb/>
doesn't pay. Still, it can be no sufficient compensation to <lb/>
a corpse, to know that the dynamite that laid him out was <lb/>
not of as good quality as it had been supposed to be.</p>
<p>The pavements along the river front were bad; the <reg orig="side-|walks">sidewalks</reg> <lb/>
were rather out of repair; there was a rich abundance <lb/>
of mud. All this was familiar and satisfying; but the <lb/>
ancient armies of drays, and struggling throngs of men, and <lb/>
mountains of freight, were gone; and Sabbath reigned in <lb/>
their stead. The immemorial mile of cheap foul doggeries <lb/>
remained, but business was dull with them; the multitudes <lb/>
of poison-swilling Irishmen had departed, and in their places <lb/>
were a few scattering handfuls of ragged negroes, some <lb/>
drinking, some drunk, some nodding, others asleep. St. <lb/>
Louis is a great and prosperous and advancing city; but the <lb/>
river-edge of it seems dead past resurrection.</p>
<p>Mississippi steamboating was born about 1812; at the end <lb/>
of thirty years, it had grown to mighty proportions; and in <lb/>
less than thirty more, it was dead! A strangely short life <lb/>
for so majestic a creature. Of course it is not absolutely <lb/>
dead; neither is a crippled octogenarian who could once <lb/>
jump twenty-two feet on level ground; but as contrasted <lb/>
with what it was in its prime vigor, Mississippi steamboating <lb/>
may be called dead.</p>
<p>It killed the old-fashioned keel-boating, by reducing the <lb/>
freight-trip to New Orleans to less than a week. The <reg orig="rail-|roads">railroads</reg> <lb/>
have killed the steamboat passenger traffic by doing in <lb/>
two or three days what the steamboats consumed a week <lb/>
in doing; and the towing-fleets have killed the <reg orig="through-|freight">through-freight</reg> <lb/>
traffic by dragging six or seven steamer-loads of stuff <lb/>
down the river at a time, at an expense so trivial that <lb/>
steamboat competition was out of the question.</p>
<p>Freight and passenger way-traffic remains to the steamers. <lb/>
This is in the hands&mdash;along the two thousand miles of <lb/>
river between St. Paul and New Orleans&mdash;of two or three <lb/>
close corporations well fortified with capital; and by able <lb/>
<pb n="257" entity="DSSR_000002932_0260"/>
and thoroughly business-like management and system, these <lb/>
make a sufficiency of money out of what is left of the once <lb/>
prodigious steamboating industry. I <reg orig="sup-|pose">suppose</reg> <lb/>
that St. Louis and New Orleans have <lb/>
not suffered materially by the change, but <lb/>
alas for the <lb/>

man!</p>

<head>TRAVELLING INCOGNITO.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">My</hi> idea was, to tarry a while in every town between St. <lb/>
Louis and New Orleans. To do this, it would be <lb/>
necessary to go from place to place by the short packet lines. <lb/>
It was an easy plan to make, and would have been an easy <lb/>
one to follow, twenty years ago&mdash;but not now. There are <lb/>
wide intervals between boats, these days.</p>
<p>I wanted to begin with the interesting old French <reg orig="settle-|ments">settlements</reg> <lb/>
of St. Genevieve and Kaskaskia, sixty miles below St. <lb/>
Louis. There was only one boat advertised for that section <lb/>
&mdash;a Grand Tower packet. Still, one boat was enough; so <lb/>
we went down to look at her. She was a venerable <reg orig="rack-|heap">rack-heap</reg>, <lb/>
and a fraud to boot; for she was playing herself for <lb/>
personal property, whereas the good honest dirt was so <lb/>
thickly caked all over her that she was righteously taxable <lb/>
as real estate. There are places in New England where her <lb/>
hurricane deck would be worth a hundred and fifty dollars <lb/>
an acre. The soil on her forecastle was quite good&mdash;the <lb/>
new crop of wheat was already springing from the cracks in <lb/>
protected places. The companionway was of a dry sandy <lb/>
character, and would have been well suited for grapes, with <lb/>
a southern exposure and a little subsoiling. The soil of the <lb/>
boiler deck was thin and rocky, but good enough for grazing <lb/>
purposes. A colored boy was on watch here&mdash;nobody else <lb/>
visible. We gathered from him that this calm craft would <lb/>
go, as advertised, "if she got her trip;" if she did n't get it, <lb/>
she would wait for it.</p>
<pb n="259" entity="DSSR_000002932_0262"/>
<p>"Has she got any of her trip?"</p>
<p>"Bless you, no, boss. She ain't unloadened, yit. She <lb/>
only come in dis mawnin'."</p>
<figure id="f136" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0262">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">waiting for a trip.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>He was uncertain as to when she might get her trip, but <lb/>
thought it might be to-morrow or maybe next day. This <lb/>
would not answer at <lb/>
all; so we had to <lb/>
give up the novelty <lb/>
of sailing down the <lb/>
river on a farm. <lb/>
We had one more <lb/>
arrow in our quiver: <lb/>
a Vicksburg packet, <lb/>
the "Gold Dust," <lb/>
was to leave at 5 <lb/>
<hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi> We took <reg orig="pas-|sage">passage</reg> <lb/>
in her for <reg orig="Mem-|phis">Memphis</reg>, <lb/>
and gave up the <lb/>
idea of stopping off <lb/>
here and there, as <lb/>
being impracticable. <lb/>
She was neat, clean, <lb/>
and comfortable. <lb/>
We camped on the <lb/>
boiler deck, and <lb/>
bought some cheap <lb/>
literature to kill <lb/>
time with. The <reg orig="ven-|der">vender</reg> <lb/>
was a venerable <lb/>
Irishman with a benevolent face and a tongue that worked <lb/>
easily in the socket, and from him we learned that he had <lb/>
lived in St. Louis thirty-four years and had never been across <lb/>
the river during that period. Then he wandered into a very <lb/>
flowing lecture, filled with classic names and allusions, which <lb/>
was quite wonderful for fluency until the fact became rather <lb/>
apparent that this was not the first time, nor perhaps the <lb/>
<pb n="260" entity="DSSR_000002932_0263"/>
fiftieth, that the speech had been delivered. He was a good <lb/>
deal of a character, and much better company than the sappy <lb/>
literature he was selling. <lb/>
A random remark, <reg orig="con-|necting">connecting</reg> <lb/>
Irishmen and <lb/>
beer, brought this <reg orig="nug-|get">nugget</reg> <lb/>
of information out <lb/>
of him:&mdash;</p>
<p>"They don't drink it, <lb/>
sir. They <hi rend="italic">can't</hi> drink it, <lb/>
sir. Give an Irishman <lb/>
lager for a month, <lb/>
and he's a dead <lb/>
man. An Irishman <lb/>
is lined with copper, <lb/>
and the beer corrodes <lb/>
it. But whiskey <reg orig="pol-|ishes">polishes</reg> <lb/>
the copper <lb/>
and is the saving <lb/>
of him, sir."</p>
<figure id="f137" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0263">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">the electric light.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>At eight <reg orig="o'-|clock">o'clock</reg>, <lb/>
promptly, <lb/>
we backed out <lb/>
and&mdash;crossed the <lb/>
river. As we <lb/>
crept toward the <lb/>
shore, in the thick <lb/>
darkness, a <reg orig="blind-|ing">blinding</reg> <lb/>
glory of white <lb/>
electric light <lb/>
burst suddenly <lb/>
from our <reg orig="fore-|castle">forecastle</reg>, <lb/>
and lit up <lb/>
the water and the warehouses as with a noon-day glare. <lb/>
Another big change, this,&mdash;no more flickering, smoky, <lb/>
pitch-dripping, ineffectual torch-baskets, now: their day is <lb/>
<pb n="261" entity="DSSR_000002932_0264"/>
past. Next, instead of calling out a score of hands to <lb/>
man the stage, a couple of men and a hatful of steam <lb/>
lowered it from the derrick where it was suspended, <lb/>
launched it, deposited it in just the right spot, and the <lb/>
whole thing was over and done-with before a mate in the <lb/>
olden time could have got his profanity-mill adjusted to <lb/>
begin the preparatory services. Why this new and simple <lb/>
method of handling the stages was not thought of when <lb/>
the first steamboat was built, is a mystery which helps <lb/>
one to realize what a dull-witted slug the average human <lb/>
being is.</p>

<p>We finally got away at two in the morning, and when I <lb/>
turned out at six, <lb/>
we were <reg orig="round-|ing">rounding</reg> <lb/>
to at a rocky <lb/>
point where there <lb/>
was an old stone <lb/>
warehouse&mdash;at <lb/>

ruins of it; two <lb/>
or three decayed <reg orig="dwel-|ling-houses">dwelling-houses</reg> <lb/>
were near <lb/>
by, in the shelter of the <lb/>
leafy hills; but there <lb/>
were no evidences of <lb/>
human or other animal life to be seen. I wondered if I <lb/>
had forgotten the river; for I had no recollection whatever <lb/>
of this place; the shape of the river, too, was unfamiliar; <lb/>
<pb n="262" entity="DSSR_000002932_0265"/>
there was nothing in sight, anywhere, that I could remember <lb/>
ever having seen before. I was surprised, disappointed, and <lb/>
annoyed.</p>
<p>We put ashore a well-dressed lady and gentleman, and two <lb/>
well-dressed, lady-like young girls, together with sundry <lb/>
Russia-leather bags. A strange place for such folk! No <lb/>
carriage was waiting. The party moved off as if they had <lb/>
not expected any, and struck down a winding country road <lb/>
afoot.</p>
<figure id="f139" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0265">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">a close inspection.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>But the mystery was explained when we got under way <lb/>
again; for these people <lb/>
were evidently bound <lb/>
for a large town which <lb/>
lay shut in behind a <lb/>
tow-head (<hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> new <lb/>
island) a couple of <lb/>
miles below this <reg orig="land-|ing">landing</reg>. <lb/>
I could n't <reg orig="re-|member">remember</reg> <lb/>
that town; <lb/>
I could n't place it, <lb/>
could n't call its name. <lb/>
So I lost part of my <lb/>
temper. I suspected <lb/>
that it might be St. <lb/>
Genevieve&mdash;and so it <lb/>
proved to be. Observe <lb/>
what this eccentric river <lb/>
had been about: it had <lb/>
built up this huge <reg orig="use-|less">useless</reg> <lb/>
tow-head directly in <lb/>
front of this town, cut <lb/>
off its river <reg orig="communi-|cations">communications</reg>, <lb/>
fenced it away <lb/>
completely, and made a "country" town of it. It is a <lb/>
fine old place, too, and deserved a better fate. It was <lb/>
settled by the French, and is a relic of a time when one <lb/>
<pb n="263" entity="DSSR_000002932_0266"/>
could travel from the mouths of the Mississippi to Quebec <lb/>
and be on French territory and under French rule all the <lb/>
way.</p>
<p>Presently I ascended to the hurricane deck and cast a <lb/>
longing glance toward the pilot-house.</p>

<div3 type="section" id="d60">
<head>MY INCOGNITO IS EXPLODED.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">After</hi> a close study of the face of the pilot on watch, I <lb/>
was satisfied that I had never seen him before; so <lb/>
I went up there. The pilot inspected me; I re-inspected the <lb/>
pilot. These customary preliminaries over, I sat down on the <lb/>
high bench, and he faced about and went on with his work. <lb/>
Every detail of the pilot-house was familiar to me, with one <lb/>
exception,&mdash;a large-mouthed tube under the breast-board. <lb/>
I puzzled over that thing a considerable time; then gave up <lb/>
and asked what it was for.</p>
<p>"To hear the engine-bells through."</p>
<p>It was another good contrivance which ought to have been <lb/>
invented half a century sooner. So I was thinking, when the <lb/>
pilot asked,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Do you know what this rope is for?"</p>
<p>I managed to get around this question, without committing <lb/>
myself.</p>
<p>"Is this the first time you were ever in a pilot-house?"</p>
<p>I crept under that one.</p>
<p>"Where are you from?"</p>
<p>"New England."</p>
<p>"First time you have ever been West?"</p>
<p>I climbed over this one.</p>
<p>"If you take an interest in such things, I can tell you <lb/>
what all these things are for."</p>
<p>I said I should like it.</p>
<p>"This," putting his hand on a backing-bell rope, "is to <lb/>
sound the fire-alarm; this," putting his hand on a go-a-head <lb/>
<pb n="265" entity="DSSR_000002932_0268"/>
bell, "is to call the texas-tender; this one," indicating the <lb/>
whistle-lever, "is to call the captain"&mdash;and so he went on, <lb/>
touching one object after another, and reeling off his tranquil <lb/>
spool of lies.</p>
<figure id="f141" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0268">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">showing the bells.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>I had never felt so like a passenger before. I thanked <lb/>
him, with emotion, for each new fact, and wrote it down in <lb/>
my note-book. The pilot warmed to his opportunity, and <lb/>
proceeded to load me up in the good old-fashioned way. At <lb/>
times I was afraid he was going to rupture his invention; <lb/>
but it always stood the strain, and he pulled through all <lb/>
right. He drifted, by easy stages, into revealments of the <lb/>
river's marvellous eccentricities of one sort and another, and <lb/>
<pb n="266" entity="DSSR_000002932_0269"/>
backed them up with some pretty gigantic illustrations. For <lb/>

All washed away but that." [This with a sigh.]</p>
<p>I had a mighty impulse to destroy him, but it seemed to <lb/>
me that killing, in any ordinary way, would be too good for <lb/>

<p>Once, when an odd-looking craft, with a vast coal-scuttle <lb/>

it was an "alligator <lb/>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">ALLIGATOR PILOTS.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"Yes, it was one of the main difficulties about piloting. <lb/>
It was so hard to tell anything about the water; the damned <lb/>
things shift around so&mdash;never lie still five minutes at a time. <lb/>
You can tell a wind-reef, straight off, by the look of it; you <lb/>
can tell a break; you can tell a sand-reef&mdash;that's all easy; <lb/>
but an alligator reef does n't show up, worth anything. Nine <lb/>
times in ten you can't tell where the water is; and when you <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">do</hi> see where it is, like as not it ain't there when <hi rend="italic">you</hi> get <lb/>
there, the devils have swapped around so, meantime. Of <lb/>
course there were some few pilots that could judge of <reg orig="alli-|gator">alligator</reg> <lb/>
water nearly as well as they could of any other kind, <lb/>
but they had to have natural talent for it; it was n't a thing <lb/>
a body could <hi rend="italic">learn,</hi> you had to be born with it. Let me see: <lb/>
there was Ben Thornburg, and Beck Jolly, and Squire Bell, <lb/>
and Horace Bixby, and Major Downing, and John Stevenson, <lb/>
and Billy Gordon, and Jim Brady, and George Ealer, and <lb/>
Billy Youngblood&mdash;all A 1 alligator pilots. <hi rend="italic">They</hi> could tell <lb/>
alligator water as far as another Christian could tell whiskey. <lb/>
Read it?&mdash;Ah, <hi rend="italic">could n't</hi> they, though! I only wish I had as <lb/>
many dollars as they could read alligator water a mile and a <lb/>
<pb n="268" entity="DSSR_000002932_0271"/>
half off. Yes, and it paid them to do it, too. A good <lb/>
alligator pilot could always get fifteen hundred dollars a <lb/>
month. Nights, other people had to lay up for alligators, but <lb/>
those fellows never laid up for alligators; they never laid up <lb/>
for anything but fog. They could <hi rend="italic">smell</hi> the best alligator <lb/>
water&mdash;so it was said; I don't know whether it was so or <lb/>
not, and I think a body's got his hands full enough if he <lb/>
sticks to just what he knows himself, without going around <lb/>
backing up other people's say-so's, though there's a plenty <lb/>
that ain't backward about doing it, as long as they can roust <lb/>
out something wonderful to tell. Which is not the style of <lb/>
Robert Styles, by as much as three fathom&mdash;maybe quarter- <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">less.</hi>"</p>
<p>[My! Was this Rob Styles?&mdash;This moustached and <lb/>
stately figure?&mdash;A slim enough cub, in my time. How he <lb/>
has improved in comeliness in five and twenty years&mdash;and <lb/>
in the noble art of inflating his facts.] After these musings, <lb/>
I said aloud,&mdash;</p>
<p>"I should think that dredging out the alligators would n't <lb/>
have done much good, because they could come back again <lb/>
right away."</p>
<p>"If you had had as much experience of alligators as I <lb/>
have, you would n't talk like that. You dredge an alligator <lb/>
once and he's <hi rend="italic">convinced.</hi> It's the last you hear of <hi rend="italic">him.</hi> <lb/>
He would n't come back for pie. If there's one thing that <lb/>
an alligator is more down on than another, it's being <lb/>
dredged. Besides, they were not simply shoved out of the <lb/>
way; the most of the scoopful were scooped aboard; they <lb/>
emptied them into the hold; and when they had got a trip, <lb/>
they took them to Orleans to the Government works."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"Why, to make soldier-shoes out of their hides. All the <lb/>
Government shoes are made of alligator hide. It makes the <lb/>
best shoes in the world. They last five years, and they won't <lb/>
absorb water. The alligator fishery is a Government <lb/>
monopoly. All the alligators are Government property&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="269" entity="DSSR_000002932_0272"/>
just like the live-oaks. You cut down a live-oak, and <reg orig="Govern-|ment">Government</reg> <lb/>
fines you fifty dollars; you kill an alligator, and up you <lb/>
go for misprision of treason&mdash;lucky duck if they don't hang <lb/>
you, too. And they will, if you're <lb/>
a Democrat. The buzzard is the <lb/>
sacred bird of the South, and you <lb/>
can't touch him; the alligator is <lb/>
the sacred bird of the Government, <lb/>
and you've got to let him alone."</p>
<p>"Do you ever get aground on the <lb/>
alligators now?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no! it has n't happened <lb/>
for years."</p>
<p>"Well, then, why do they still <lb/>
keep the alligator boats in <reg orig="ser-|vice">service</reg>?"</p> <lb/>
<p>"Just for police duty&mdash;nothing <lb/>
more. They merely go up and <lb/>
down now and then. The present <lb/>
generation of alligators know them <lb/>
as easy as a burglar knows a <reg orig="rounds-|man">roundsman</reg>; <lb/>
when they see one coming, <lb/>
they break camp and go for the <lb/>

<p>After rounding-out and <reg orig="finishing-|up">finishing-up</reg> <lb/>
and polishing-off the alligator <lb/>
business, he dropped easily and <lb/>
comfortably into the historical vein, <lb/>
and told of some tremendous feats <lb/>
of half a dozen old-time steamboats of his acquaintance, <reg orig="dwell-|ing">dwelling</reg> <lb/>
at special length upon a certain extraordinary <reg orig="perform-|ance">performance</reg> <lb/>
of his chief favorite among this distinguished fleet&mdash; <lb/>
and then adding:&mdash;</p>
<p>"That boat was the 'Cyclone,'&mdash;last trip she ever made&mdash; <lb/>
she sunk, that very trip&mdash;captain was Tom Ballou, the most <lb/>
immortal liar that ever I struck. He could n't ever seem to <lb/>

tell the truth, in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> kind of weather. Why, he would make <lb/>
you fairly shudder. He <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the most scandalous liar! I <lb/>
left him, finally; I could n't stand it. The proverb says, <lb/>
'like master, like man;' and if you stay with that kind of a <lb/>
man, you'll come under suspicion by and by, just as sure <lb/>
as you live. He paid first-class wages; but said I, What's <lb/>
wages when your reputation's in danger? So I let the <lb/>
wages go, and froze to my reputation. And I've never <lb/>
regretted it. Reputation's worth everything, ain't it? That's <lb/>
the way I look at it. He had more selfish organs than any <lb/>
seven men in the world&mdash;all packed in the stern-sheets of <lb/>
his skull, of course, where they belonged. They weighed <lb/>
down the back of his head so that it made his nose tilt up <lb/>
in the air. People thought it was vanity, but it was n't, it <lb/>

was malice. If you only saw his foot, you'd take him to be <lb/>
nineteen feet high, but he was n't; it was because his foot <lb/>
was out of drawing. He was intended to be nineteen feet <lb/>
high, no doubt, if his foot was made first, but he did n't get <lb/>
there; he was only five feet ten. That's what he was, and <lb/>
that's what he is. You take the lies out of him, and he'll <lb/>
shrink to the size of your hat; you take the malice out of <lb/>
him, and he'll disappear. That 'Cyclone' was a rattler to go, <lb/>
and the sweetest thing to steer that ever walked the waters. <lb/>
Set her amidships, in a big river, and just let her go; it was <lb/>
all you had to do. She would hold herself on a star all <lb/>
night, if you let her alone. You could n't ever feel her <reg orig="rud-|der">rudder</reg>. <lb/>
It was n't any more labor to steer her than it is to <lb/>
count the Republican vote in a South Carolina election. One <lb/>
morning, just at daybreak, the last trip she ever made, they <lb/>
took her rudder aboard to mend it; I did n't know anything <lb/>
about it; I backed her out from the wood-yard and went <lb/>
a-weaving down the river all serene. When I had gone <lb/>
about twenty-three miles, and made four horribly crooked <lb/>
crossings&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Without any rudder?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;old Capt. Tom appeared on the roof and began to <lb/>
find fault with me for running such a dark night&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Such a <hi rend="italic">dark night?</hi>&mdash;Why, you said&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Never mind what I said,&mdash;'t was as dark as Egypt <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> <lb/>
though pretty soon the moon began to rise, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You mean the <hi rend="italic">sun</hi>&mdash;because you started out just at <lb/>

on account of his lying, or&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It was before&mdash;oh, a long time before. And as I was <lb/>
saying, he&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But was this the trip she sunk, or was&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, no!&mdash;months afterward. And so the old man, he&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Then she made <hi rend="italic">two</hi> last trips, because you said&mdash;"</p>
<p>He stepped back from the wheel, swabbing away his <reg orig="per-|spiration">perspiration</reg>, <lb/>
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here!" (calling me by name), "<hi rend="italic">you</hi> take her and lie a <lb/>

yourself for a stranger and an innocent!&mdash;why, I knew you <lb/>
before you had spoken seven words; and I made up my <lb/>

<p>We found a railway intruding at Chester, Illinois; <reg orig="Ches-|ter">Chester</reg> <lb/>

<pb n="274" entity="DSSR_000002932_0277"/>
on. At Grand Tower, too, there was a railway; and another <lb/>
at Cape Girardeau. The former town gets its name from a <lb/>
huge, squat pillar of rock, which stands up out of the water <lb/>
on the Missouri side of the river$#x2014;a piece of nature's <reg orig="fanci-|ful">fanciful</reg> <lb/>
handiwork&mdash;and is one of the most picturesque features <lb/>
of the scenery of that region. For nearer or remoter <reg orig="neigh-|bors">neighbors</reg>, <lb/>
the Tower has the Devil's Bake Oven&mdash;so called, <lb/>
perhaps, because it does not powerfully resemble anybody <lb/>
else's bake oven; and the Devil's Tea Table&mdash;this latter a <lb/>
great smooth-surfaced mass of rock, with diminishing <reg orig="wine-|glass">wineglass</reg> <lb/>
stem, perched some fifty or sixty feet above the river, <lb/>
beside a beflowered and garlanded precipice, and sufficiently <lb/>
like a tea-table to answer for anybody, Devil or Christian. <lb/>
Away down the river we have the Devil's Elbow and the <lb/>
Devil's Race-course, and lots of other property of his which <lb/>
I cannot now call to mind.</p>
<p>The Town of Grand Tower was evidently a busier place <lb/>
than it had been in old times, but it seemed to need some <lb/>
repairs here and there, and a new coat of whitewash all <lb/>
over. Still, it was pleasant to me to see the old coat once <lb/>
more. "Uncle" Mumford, our second officer, said the place <lb/>
had been suffering from high water and consequently was <lb/>
not looking its best now. But he said it was not strange <lb/>
that it did n't waste whitewash on itself, for more lime was <lb/>
made there, and of a better quality, than anywhere in the <lb/>
West; and added,&mdash;"On a dairy farm you never can get any <lb/>
milk for your coffee, nor any sugar for it on a sugar <reg orig="planta-|tion">plantation</reg>; <lb/>
and it is against sense to go to a lime town to hunt for <lb/>
whitewash." In my own experience I knew the first two <lb/>
items to be true; and also that people who sell candy don't <lb/>
care for candy; therefore there was plausibility in Uncle <lb/>
Mumford's final observation that "people who make lime <lb/>
run more to religion than whitewash." Uncle Mumford <lb/>
said, further, that Grand Tower was a great coaling centre <lb/>
and a prospering place.</p>
<p>Cape Girardeau is situated on a hillside, and makes a <lb/>
<pb n="275" entity="DSSR_000002932_0278"/>
handsome appearance. There is a great Jesuit school for <lb/>
boys at the foot of the town by the river. Uncle Mumford <lb/>
said it had as high a reputation for thoroughness as any <lb/>
similar institution in Missouri. There was another college <lb/>
higher up on an airy <reg orig="sum-|mit,&mdash;a">summit,&mdash;a</reg> <lb/>
bright new edifice, <lb/>
picturesquely and peculiarly <lb/>
towered and pinnacled&mdash;a <lb/>
sort of gigantic casters, with <lb/>
the cruets all complete. <lb/>
Uncle Mumford said that <lb/>
Cape Girardeau was the <lb/>
Athens of Missouri, and <lb/>
contained several colleges <lb/>
besides those already <reg orig="men-|tioned">mentioned</reg>; <lb/>
and all of them on <lb/>
a religious basis of one kind <lb/>
or another. He directed my <lb/>
attention to what he called <lb/>
the "strong and pervasive <lb/>
religious look of the town," <lb/>
but I could not see that it <lb/>
looked more religious than the <lb/>
other hill towns with the same <lb/>
slope and built of the same kind of <lb/>
bricks. Partialities often make <reg orig="peo-|ple">people</reg> <lb/>
see more than really exists.</p>

<p>Uncle Mumford has been thirty years <lb/>
a mate on the river. He is a man of <lb/>
practical sense and a level head; has observed; has had <lb/>
much experience of one sort and another; has opinions; <lb/>
has, also, just a perceptible dash of poetry in his <reg orig="compo-|sition">composition</reg>, <lb/>
an easy gift of speech, a thick growl in his voice, <lb/>
and an oath or two where he can get at them when the <lb/>
exigencies of his office require a spiritual lift. He is a <lb/>
mate of the blessed old-time kind; and goes gravely <reg orig="damn-|ing">damning</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="276" entity="DSSR_000002932_0279"/>
around, when there is work to the fore, in a way to <reg orig="mel-|low">mellow</reg> <lb/>
the ex-steamboatman's heart with sweet soft longings <lb/>
for the vanished days that shall come no more. "<hi rend="italic">Git</hi> up, <lb/>
there, &mdash;&mdash; you! Going to be all day? Why d'n't you <hi rend="italic">say</hi> <lb/>
you was petrified in your hind legs, before you shipped!"</p>
<p>He is a steady man with his crew; kind and just, but <lb/>
firm; so they like him, and stay with him. He is still in <lb/>
the slouchy garb of the old generation of mates; but next <lb/>
trip the Anchor Line will have him in uniform&mdash;a natty <lb/>
blue naval uniform, with brass buttons, along with all the <lb/>
officers of the line&mdash;and then he will be a totally different <lb/>
style of scenery from what he is now.</p>
<p>Uniforms on the Mississippi! It beats all the other changes <lb/>
put together, for surprise. Still, there is another surprise&mdash; <lb/>
that it was not made fifty years ago. It is so manifestly <lb/>
sensible, that it might have been thought of earlier, one <lb/>
would suppose. During fifty years, out there, the innocent <lb/>
passenger in need of help and information, has been mistaking <lb/>
the mate for the cook, and the captain for the barber&mdash;and <lb/>
being roughly entertained for it, too. But his troubles are <lb/>
ended now. And the greatly improved aspect of the boat's <lb/>
staff is another advantage achieved by the dress-reform <lb/>
period.</p>
<p>Steered down the bend below Cape Girardeau. They used <lb/>
to call it "Steersman's Bend;" plain sailing and plenty of <lb/>
water in it, always; about the only place in the Upper River <lb/>
that a new cub was allowed to take a boat through, in low <lb/>
water.</p>
<p>Thebes, at the head of the Grand Chain, and Commerce at <lb/>
the foot of it, were towns easily rememberable, as they had <lb/>
not undergone conspicuous alteration. Nor the Chain, either <lb/>
&mdash;in the nature of things; for it is a chain of sunken rocks <lb/>
admirably arranged to capture and kill steamboats on bad <lb/>
nights. A good many steamboat corpses lie buried there, out <lb/>
of sight; among the rest my first friend the "Paul Jones;" <lb/>
she knocked her bottom out, and went down like a pot, so <lb/>
<pb n="277" entity="DSSR_000002932_0280"/>
the historian told me&mdash;Uncle Mumford. He said she had <lb/>
a gray mare aboard, and a preacher. To me, this sufficiently <lb/>
accounted for the disaster; as it did, <lb/>
of course, to Mumford, who added,&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f149" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0280">

<p>"But there are many ignorant <lb/>
people who would scoff at such <lb/>
a matter, and call it superstition. But <lb/>
you will always notice <lb/>
that they are people <lb/>
who have never <lb/>
travelled with <lb/>
a gray mare and <lb/>
a preacher. I <lb/>
went down <lb/>

Beaver Dam <lb/>
Rock; we hit <lb/>
one of the <lb/>
worst breaks <lb/>
in the '<reg orig="Grave-|yard">Graveyard</reg>' <lb/>
behind Goose Island; we had a roustabout killed in <lb/>
a fight; we burnt a boiler; broke a shaft; collapsed a flue; <lb/>
and went into Cairo with nine feet of water in the hold&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="278" entity="DSSR_000002932_0281"/>
may have been more, may have been less. I remember it as <lb/>
if it were yesterday. The men lost their heads with terror. <lb/>
They painted the mare blue, in sight of town, and threw the <lb/>
preacher overboard, or we should not have arrived at all. <lb/>
The preacher was fished out and saved. He acknowledged, <lb/>
himself, that he had been to blame. I remember it all, as <lb/>
if it were yesterday."</p>
<p>That this combination&mdash;of preacher and gray mare&mdash; <lb/>
should breed calamity, seems strange, and at first glance <lb/>
unbelievable; but the fact is fortified by so much <reg orig="unassaila-|ble">unassailable</reg> <lb/>
proof that to doubt is to dishonor reason. I myself <lb/>
remember a case where a captain was warned by numerous <lb/>
friends against taking a gray mare and a preacher with him, <lb/>
but persisted in his purpose in spite of all that could be said; <lb/>
and the same day,&mdash;it may have been the next, and some <lb/>
say it was, though I think it was the same day,&mdash;he got <lb/>
drunk and fell down the hatchway and was borne to his <lb/>
home a corpse. This is literally true.</p>
<p>No vestige of Hat Island is left now; every shred of it <lb/>
is washed away. I do not even remember what part of the <lb/>
river it used to be in, except that it was between St. Louis <lb/>
and Cairo somewhere. It was a bad region&mdash;all around <lb/>
and about Hat Island, in early days. A farmer who lived <lb/>
on the Illinois shore there, said that twenty-nine steamboats <lb/>
had left their bones strung along within sight from his <lb/>
house. Between St. Louis and Cairo the steamboat wrecks <lb/>
average one to the mile;&mdash;two hundred wrecks, altogether.</p>
<p>I could recognize big changes from Commerce down. <lb/>
Beaver Dam Rock was out in the middle of the river now, <lb/>
and throwing a prodigious "break;" it used to be close to the <lb/>
shore, and boats went down outside of it. A big island that <lb/>
used to be away out in mid-river, has retired to the Missouri <lb/>
shore, and boats do not go near it any more. The island <lb/>
called Jacket Pattern is whittled down to a wedge now, <lb/>
and is booked for early destruction. Goose Island is all <lb/>
gone but a little dab the size of a steamboat. The perilous <lb/>
<pb n="279" entity="DSSR_000002932_0282"/>
"Graveyard," among whose numberless wrecks we used to <lb/>
pick our way so slowly and gingerly, is far away from the <lb/>
channel now, and a <reg orig="ter-|ror">terror</reg> <lb/>
to nobody. One of <lb/>
the islands formerly <lb/>
called the Two Sisters <lb/>
is gone entirely; the <lb/>
other, which used to <lb/>
lie close to the Illinois <lb/>
shore, is now on the <lb/>
Missouri side, a mile <lb/>
away; it is joined <reg orig="sol-|idly">solidly</reg> <lb/>
to the shore, and <lb/>
it takes a sharp eye to <lb/>
see where the seam is&mdash; <lb/>
but it is Illinois ground <lb/>
yet, and the people who <lb/>
live on it have to ferry <lb/>
themselves over and <lb/>
work the Illinois roads <lb/>
and pay Illinois taxes: <lb/>

<p>Near the mouth of <lb/>

were missing&mdash;washed <lb/>

get to it. Night fell as we were going out of the "Upper <lb/>
River" and meeting the floods of the Ohio. We dashed <lb/>
along without anxiety; for the hidden rock which used to <lb/>
lie right in the way has moved up stream a long distance <lb/>
out of the channel; or rather, about one county has gone <lb/>
into the river from the Missouri point, and the Cairo point <lb/>
<pb n="280" entity="DSSR_000002932_0283"/>
has "made down" and added to its long tongue of territory <lb/>
correspondingly. The Mississippi is a just and equitable <lb/>
river; it never tumbles one man's farm overboard without <lb/>
building a new farm just like it for that man's neighbor. <lb/>
This keeps down hard feelings.</p>
<p>Going into Cairo, we came near killing a steamboat which <lb/>
paid no attention to our whistle and then tried to cross our <lb/>
bows. By doing some strong backing, we saved him; which <lb/>
was a great loss, for he would have made good literature.</p>
<p>Cairo is a brisk town now; and is substantially built, and <lb/>
has a city look about it which is in noticeable contrast to its <lb/>
former estate, as per Mr. Dickens's portrait of it. However, <lb/>
it was already building with bricks when I had seen it last <lb/>
&mdash;which was when Colonel (now General) Grant was <reg orig="drill-|ing">drilling</reg> <lb/>
his first command there. Uncle Mumford says the <reg orig="libra-|ries">libraries</reg> <lb/>
and Sunday-schools have done a good work in Cairo, as <lb/>
well as the brick masons. Cairo has a heavy railroad and <lb/>
river trade, and her situation at the junction of the two <lb/>
great rivers is so advantageous that she cannot well help <lb/>
prospering.</p>
<p>When I turned out, in the morning, we had passed <reg orig="Colum-|bus">Columbus</reg>, <lb/>
Kentucky, and were approaching Hickman, a pretty <lb/>
town, perched on a handsome hill. Hickman is in a rich <lb/>
tobacco region, and formerly enjoyed a great and lucrative <lb/>
trade in that staple, collecting it there in her warehouses <lb/>
from a large area of country and shipping it by boat; but <lb/>
Uncle Mumford says she built a railway to facilitate this <lb/>
commerce a little more, and he thinks it facilitated it the <lb/>
wrong way&mdash;took the bulk of the trade out of her hands by <lb/>
"collaring it along the line without gathering it at her <lb/>
doors."</p>

Columbus was just <lb/>
behind us, so there <lb/>
was a good deal said <lb/>
about the famous <lb/>
battle of Belmont. <lb/>
Several of the <lb/>
boat's officers had <lb/>
seen active service <lb/>
in the Mississippi <lb/>

that they <lb/>
found themselves <lb/>
sadly out of their <lb/>
element in that <lb/>
kind of business at <lb/>
first, but afterward <lb/>
got accustomed to <lb/>
it, reconciled to it, <lb/>
and more or less at <lb/>
home in it. One <lb/>
of our pilots had his <lb/>
first war experience <lb/>
in the Belmont fight, <lb/>
as a pilot on a boat <lb/>
in the Confederate service. I had often had a curiosity to <lb/>
<pb n="282" entity="DSSR_000002932_0285"/>
know how a green hand might feel, in his maiden battle, <lb/>
perched all solitary and alone on high in a pilot house, a <reg orig="tar-|get">target</reg> <lb/>
for Tom, Dick and Harry, and nobody at his elbow to <lb/>
shame him from showing <lb/>
the white feather when <lb/>
matters grew hot and <reg orig="peril-|ous">perilous</reg> <lb/>

his story was valuable&mdash;it <lb/>

<p>He said:&mdash;</p>
<p>It was the 7th of <reg orig="Novem-|ber">November</reg>. <lb/>
The fight began at <lb/>
seven in the morning. I <lb/>
was on the "R. H. W. <lb/>
Hill." Took over a load <lb/>
of troops from Columbus. <lb/>
Came back, and took over <lb/>
a battery of artillery. My <lb/>
partner said he was going <lb/>
to see the fight; wanted <lb/>
me to go along. I said, <lb/>
no, I wasn't anxious, I <lb/>
would look at it from the <lb/>
pilot-house. He said I was <lb/>
a coward, and left.</p>
<figure id="f152" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0285">

</figure>
<p>That fight was an awful <lb/>
sight. General Cheatham made his men strip their coats <lb/>
off and throw them in a pile, and said, "Now follow me to <lb/>
hell or victory!" I heard him say that from the pilot-house; <lb/>
and then he galloped in, at the head of his troops. Old <lb/>
<pb n="283" entity="DSSR_000002932_0286"/>
General Pillow, with his white hair, mounted on a white <lb/>
horse, sailed in, too, leading his troops as lively as a boy. <lb/>
By and by the Federals chased the rebels back, and here <lb/>
they came! tearing along, everybody for himself and Devil <lb/>
take the hindmost! and down under the bank they <reg orig="scram-|bled">scrambled</reg>, <lb/>
and took shelter. I was sitting with my legs <reg orig="hang-|ing">hanging</reg> <lb/>
out of the pilot-house window. All at once I noticed <lb/>
a whizzing sound passing my ear. Judged it was a bullet. <lb/>
I didn't stop to think about anything, I just tilted over <lb/>
backwards and landed on the floor, and staid there. The <lb/>
balls came booming around. Three cannon-balls went <lb/>
through the chimney; one ball took off the corner of the <lb/>
pilot-house; shells were screaming and bursting all around. <lb/>
Mighty warm times&mdash;I wished I hadn't come. I lay there <lb/>
on the pilot-house floor, while the shots came faster and <lb/>
faster. I crept in behind the big stove, in the middle of <lb/>
the pilot-house. Presently a minie-ball came through the <lb/>
stove, and just grazed my head, and cut my hat. I <lb/>
judged it was time to go away from there. The captain <lb/>
was on the roof with a red-headed major from Memphis&mdash; <lb/>
a fine-looking man. I heard him say he wanted to leave <lb/>
here, but "that pilot is killed." I crept over to the <reg orig="star-|board">starboard</reg> <lb/>
side to pull the bell to set her back; raised up and <lb/>
took a look, and I saw about fifteen shot holes through the <lb/>
window panes; had come so lively I hadn't noticed them. <lb/>
I glanced out on the water, and the spattering shot were <lb/>
like a hail-storm. I thought best to get out of that place. <lb/>
I went down the pilot-house guy, head first&mdash;not feet first <lb/>
but head first&mdash;slid down&mdash;before I struck the deck, the <lb/>
captain said we must leave there. So I climbed up the guy <lb/>
and got on the floor again. About that time, they collared <lb/>
my partner and were bringing him up to the pilot-house <lb/>
between two soldiers. Somebody had said I was killed. <lb/>
He put his head in and saw me on the floor reaching for the <lb/>
backing bells. He said, "Oh, hell, he ain't shot," and jerked <lb/>
away from the men who had him by the collar, and ran <lb/>
<pb n="284" entity="DSSR_000002932_0287"/>
below. We were there until three o'clock in the afternoon, <lb/>
and then got away all right.</p>
<p>The next time I saw my partner, I said, "Now, come out, be <lb/>
honest, and tell me the truth. Where did you go when you <lb/>
went to see that battle?" He says, "I went down in the hold."</p>
<p>All through that fight I was scared nearly to death. I <lb/>
hardly knew anything, I was so frightened; but you see, <lb/>
nobody knew that <lb/>
but me. Next day <lb/>
General Polk sent <lb/>
for me, and praised <lb/>
me for my bravery <lb/>
and gallant conduct. <lb/>
I never said <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg>, <lb/>
I let it go <lb/>
at that. I judged <lb/>
it wasn't so, but <lb/>
it was not for me <lb/>
to contradict a <lb/>
general officer.</p>

<p>We struck down through the chute of Island No. 8, and I <lb/>
went below and fell into conversation with a passenger, a <reg orig="hand-|some">handsome</reg> <lb/>
man, with easy carriage and an intelligent face. We <lb/>
were <reg orig="approach-|ing">approaching</reg> <lb/>
Island No. <lb/>
10, a place so <lb/>
celebrated <reg orig="dur-|ing">during</reg> <lb/>
the war. <lb/>
This gentleman's home was on the main shore in its <reg orig="neigh-|borhood">neighborhood</reg>. <lb/>
I had some talk with him about the war times; <lb/>
but presently the discourse fell upon "feuds," for in no part <lb/>
of the South has the vendetta flourished more briskly, or held <lb/>
<pb n="286" entity="DSSR_000002932_0289"/>
out longer between warring families, than in this particular <lb/>
region. This gentleman said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"There's been more than one feud around here, in old <lb/>
times, but I reckon the worst one was between the Darnells <lb/>
and the Watsons. Nobody don't know now what the first <lb/>
quarrel was about, it's so long ago; the Darnells and the <lb/>
Watsons don't know, if there's any of them living, which I <lb/>
don't think there is. Some says it was about a horse or a <lb/>
cow&mdash;anyway, it was a little matter; the money in it wasn't <lb/>
of no consequence&mdash;none in the world&mdash;both families was <lb/>
rich. The thing could have been fixed up, easy enough; <lb/>
but no, that wouldn't do. Rough words had been passed; <lb/>
and so, nothing but blood could fix it up after that. That <lb/>
horse or cow, whichever it was, cost sixty years of killing <lb/>
and crippling! Every year or so somebody was shot, on <lb/>
one side or the other; and as fast as one generation was <lb/>
laid out, their sons took up the feud and kept it a-going. <lb/>
And it's just as I say; they went on shooting each other, <lb/>
year in and year out&mdash;making a kind of a religion of it, <lb/>
you see&mdash;till they'd done forgot, long ago, what it was all <lb/>
about. Wherever a Darnell caught a Watson, or a Watson <lb/>
caught a Darnell, one of 'em was going to get hurt&mdash;only <lb/>
question was, which of them got the drop on the other. <lb/>
They'd shoot one another down, right in the presence of <lb/>
the family. They didn't <hi rend="italic">hunt</hi> for each other, but when <lb/>
they happened to meet, they pulled and begun. Men would <lb/>
shoot boys, boys would shoot men. A man shot a boy twelve <lb/>
years old&mdash;happened on him in the woods, and did n't give <lb/>
him no chance. If he <hi rend="italic">had</hi> 'a' given him a chance, the boy'd <lb/>
'a' shot <hi rend="italic">him.</hi> Both families belonged to the same church <lb/>
(everybody around here is religious); through all this fifty <lb/>
or sixty years' fuss, both tribes was there every Sunday, to <lb/>
worship. They lived each side of the line, and the church <lb/>
was at a landing called Compromise. Half the church and <lb/>
half the aisle was in Kentucky, the other half in Tennessee. <lb/>
Sundays you'd see the families drive up, all in their Sunday <lb/>
<pb n="287" entity="DSSR_000002932_0290"/>
clothes, men, women, and children, and file up the aisle, and <lb/>
set down, quiet and orderly, one lot on the Tennessee side <lb/>
of the church and the other on the Kentucky side; and the <lb/>
men and boys would lean their guns up against the wall, <lb/>
handy, and then all hands would join in with the prayer <lb/>
and praise; though they say the man next the aisle did n't <lb/>
kneel down, along with the rest of the family; kind of stood <lb/>
guard. I don't <lb/>
know; never <lb/>
was at that <lb/>
church in <lb/>
my life; <lb/>
but I remember <lb/>
that that's what <lb/>
used to be said.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">they kept on shooting.</hi></head>

<p>"Twenty or <lb/>
twenty-five years <lb/>
ago, one of the <lb/>
feud families <lb/>
caught a young <lb/>
man of nineteen <lb/>
out and killed him. Don't remember whether it was the <lb/>
Darnells and Watsons, or one of the other feuds; but <lb/>
anyway, this young man rode up&mdash;steamboat laying there <lb/>
at the time&mdash;and the first thing he saw was a whole gang <lb/>
of the enemy. He jumped down behind a wood-pile, but <lb/>
they rode around and begun on him, he firing back, and <lb/>
<pb n="288" entity="DSSR_000002932_0291"/>
they galloping and cavorting and yelling and banging <lb/>
away with all their might. Think he wounded a couple <lb/>
of them; but they closed in on him and chased him <lb/>
into the river; and as he swum along down stream, <lb/>
they followed along the bank and kept on shooting at <lb/>
him; and when he struck shore he was dead. Windy <lb/>
Marshall told me about it. He saw it. He was captain of <lb/>
the boat.</p>
<p>"Years ago, the Darnells was so thinned out that the old <lb/>
man and his two sons concluded they'd leave the country. <lb/>
They started to take steamboat just above No. 10; but the <lb/>
Watsons got wind of it; and they arrived just as the two <lb/>
young Darnells was walking up the companion-way with <lb/>
their wives on their arms. The fight begun then, and they <lb/>
never got no further&mdash;both of them killed. After that, old <lb/>
Darnell got into trouble with the man that run the ferry, <lb/>
and the ferry-man got the worst of it&mdash;and died. But his <lb/>
friends shot old Darnell through and through&mdash;filled him <lb/>
full of bullets, and ended him."</p>
<p>The country gentleman who told me these things had been <lb/>
reared in ease and comfort, was a man of good parts, and <lb/>
was college bred. His loose grammar was the fruit of <reg orig="care-|less">careless</reg> <lb/>
habit, not ignorance. This habit among educated men <lb/>
in the West is not universal, but it is prevalent&mdash;prevalent <lb/>
in the towns, certainly, if not in the cities; and to a degree <lb/>
which one cannot help noticing, and marvelling at. I heard <lb/>
a Westerner who would be accounted a highly educated man <lb/>
in any country, say "never mind, it <hi rend="italic">don't make no difference,</hi> <lb/>
anyway." A life-long resident who was present heard it, but <lb/>
it made no impression upon her. She was able to recall the <lb/>
fact afterward, when reminded of it; but she confessed that <lb/>
the words had not grated upon her ear at the time&mdash;a <reg orig="con-|fession">confession</reg> <lb/>
which suggests that if educated people can hear such <lb/>
blasphemous grammar, from such a source, and be <reg orig="uncon-|scious">unconscious</reg> <lb/>
of the deed, the crime must be tolerably common&mdash; <lb/>
so common that the general ear has become dulled by <reg orig="famil-|iarity">familiarity</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="289" entity="DSSR_000002932_0292"/>
with it, and is no longer alert, no longer sensitive to <lb/>
such affronts.</p>
<p>No one in the world speaks blemishless grammar; no one <lb/>
has ever written it&mdash;<hi rend="italic">no</hi> one, either in the world or out of it <lb/>
(taking the Scriptures for evidence on the latter point); <lb/>
therefore it would not be fair to exact grammatical perfection <lb/>
from the peoples of the Valley; but they and all other <reg orig="peo-|ples">peoples</reg> <lb/>
may justly be required to refrain from <hi rend="italic">knowingly</hi> and <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">purposely</hi> debauching their grammar.</p>
<p>I found the river greatly changed at Island No. 10. The <lb/>
island which I remembered was some three miles long and a <lb/>
quarter of a mile wide, heavily timbered, and lay near the <lb/>
Kentucky shore&mdash;within two hundred yards of it, I should <lb/>
say. Now, however, one had to hunt for it with a spy-glass. <lb/>
Nothing was left of it but an insignificant little tuft, and <lb/>
this was no longer near the Kentucky shore; it was clear <lb/>
over against the opposite shore, a mile away. In war times <lb/>
the island had been an important place, for it commanded the <lb/>
situation; and, being heavily fortified, there was no getting <lb/>
by it. It lay between the upper and lower divisions of the <lb/>
Union forces, and kept them separate, until a junction was <lb/>
finally effected across the Missouri neck of land; but the <lb/>
island being itself joined to that neck now, the wide river is <lb/>
without obstruction.</p>

<p>In this region the river passes from Kentucky into <reg orig="Ten-|nessee">Tennessee</reg>, <lb/>
back into Missouri, then back into Kentucky, and <lb/>
thence into Tennessee again. So a mile or two of Missouri <lb/>
sticks over into Tennessee.</p>

<p>The town of New Madrid was looking very unwell; but <lb/>
otherwise unchanged from its former condition and aspect. <lb/>
Its blocks of frame-houses were still grouped in the same <lb/>
old flat plain, and environed by the same old forests. It was <lb/>
as tranquil as formerly, and apparently had neither grown <lb/>
nor diminished in size. It was said that the recent high <lb/>
water had invaded it and damaged its looks. This was <reg orig="sur-|prising">surprising</reg> <lb/>
news; for in low water the river bank is very high <lb/>
there (fifty feet), and in my day an overflow had always <lb/>
been considered an impossibility. This present flood of 1882 <lb/>
will doubtless be celebrated in the river's history for several <lb/>
generations before a deluge of like magnitude shall be seen. <lb/>
It put all the unprotected low lands under water, from Cairo <lb/>
to the mouth; it broke down the levees in a great many <lb/>
places, on both sides of the river; and in some regions <lb/>
south, when the flood was at its highest, the Mississippi was <lb/>

<hi rend="italic">seventy miles</hi> wide! a number of lives were lost, and the <lb/>

and by newspaper enterprise could come and <reg orig="res-|cue">rescue</reg> <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> met two steamboats at New Madrid. Two <reg orig="steam-|boats">steamboats</reg> <lb/>
in sight at once! an infrequent spectacle <lb/>
now in the lonesome Mississippi. The loneliness of this <lb/>
solemn, stupendous flood is impressive&mdash;and depressing. <lb/>
League after league, and still league after league, it pours its <lb/>
chocolate tide along, between its solid forest walls, its almost <lb/>
untenanted shores, with seldom a sail or a moving object of <lb/>
any kind to disturb the surface and break the monotony of <lb/>
the blank, watery solitude; and so the day goes, the night <lb/>
comes, and again the day&mdash;and still the same, night after <lb/>

<p>Immediately after the war of 1812, tourists began to come <lb/>
to America, from England; scattering ones at first, then a <lb/>
sort of procession of them&mdash;a procession which kept up its <lb/>
plodding, patient march through the land during many, <lb/>
many years. Each tourist took notes, and went home and <lb/>
published a book&mdash;a book which was usually calm, truthful, <lb/>
reasonable, kind; but which seemed just the reverse to our <lb/>
tender-footed progenitors. A glance at these tourist-books <lb/>
shows us that in certain of its aspects the Mississippi has <lb/>
undergone no change since those strangers visited it, but <lb/>
remains to-day about as it was then. The emotions produced <lb/>
in those foreign breasts by these aspects were not all formed <lb/>
<pb n="293" entity="DSSR_000002932_0296"/>
on one pattern, of course; they <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to be various, along at <lb/>
first, because the earlier tourists were obliged to originate <lb/>
their emotions, whereas in older countries one can always <lb/>
borrow emotions from one's predecessors. And, mind you, <lb/>
emotions are among the toughest things in the world to <lb/>
manufacture out of whole cloth; it is easier to manufacture <lb/>
seven facts than one emotion. Captain Basil Hall, R. N., <lb/>
writing fifty-five years ago, says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Here I caught the first glimpse of the object I had so long <lb/>
wished to behold, and felt myself amply repaid at that moment for <lb/>
all the trouble I had experienced in coming so far; and stood <reg orig="look-|ing">looking</reg> <lb/>
at the river flowing past till it was too dark to distinguish <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg>. <lb/>
But it was not till I had visited the <lb/>
same spot a dozen times, that I <lb/>
came to a right comprehension of <lb/>
the grandeur of the scene."</p>

<p>Following are Mrs. Trollope's emotions. She is writing a <lb/>
few months later in the same year, 1827, and is coming in <lb/>
at the mouth of the Mississippi:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The first indication of our approach to land was the appearance <lb/>
of this mighty river pouring forth its muddy mass of waters, and <lb/>
mingling with the deep blue of the Mexican Gulf. I never beheld <lb/>
a scene so utterly desolate as this entrance of the Mississippi. Had <lb/>
Dante seen it, he might have drawn images of another Bolgia from <lb/>
<pb n="294" entity="DSSR_000002932_0297"/>
its horrors. One only object rears itself above the eddying waters; <lb/>
this is the mast of a vessel long since wrecked in attempting to cross <lb/>
the bar, and it still stands, a dismal witness of the destruction that <lb/>
has been, and a boding prophet of that which is to come."</p>
<p>Emotions of Hon. Charles Augustus Murray (near St. <lb/>
Louis), seven years later:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is only when you ascend the mighty current for fifty or a <lb/>
hundred miles, and use the eye of imagination as well as that of <lb/>
nature, that you begin to understand all his might and majesty. <lb/>
You see him fertilizing a boundless valley, bearing along in his <lb/>
course the trophies of his thousand victories over the shattered <reg orig="for-|est&mdash;here">forest&mdash;here</reg> <lb/>
carrying away large masses of soil with all their growth, <lb/>
and there forming islands, destined at some future period to be the <lb/>
residence of man; and while indulging in this prospect, it is then <lb/>
time for reflection to suggest that the current before you has flowed <lb/>
through two or three thousand miles, and has yet to travel one <lb/>
thousand three hundred more before reaching its ocean destination."</p>
<p>Receive, now, the emotions of Captain Marryat, R. N. <lb/>
author of the sea tales, writing in 1837, three years after Mr. <lb/>
Murray:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Never, perhaps, in the records of nations, was there an instance <lb/>
of a century of such unvarying and unmitigated crime as is to be <lb/>
collected from the history of the turbulent and blood-stained <reg orig="Missis-|sippi">Mississippi</reg>. <lb/>
The stream itself appears as if appropriate for the deeds <lb/>
which have been committed. It is not like most rivers, beautiful to <lb/>
the sight, bestowing fertility in its course; not one that the eye <lb/>
loves to dwell upon as it sweeps along, nor can you wander upon its <lb/>
bank, or trust yourself without danger to its stream. It is a <reg orig="furi-|ous">furious</reg>, <lb/>
rapid, desolating torrent, loaded with alluvial soil; and few of <lb/>
those who are received into its waters ever rise again,<ref target="n14" n="14"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
<note id="n14" place="foot" n="14"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>There was a foolish superstition of some little prevalence in that day, <lb/>
that the Mississippi would neither buoy up a swimmer, nor permit a drowned <lb/>
person's body to rise to the surface.</p></note>
 or can <reg orig="sup-|port">support</reg> <lb/>
themselves long upon its surface without assistance from some <lb/>
friendly log. It contains the coarsest and most uneatable of fish, <lb/>
such as the cat-fish and such genus, and as you descend, its banks <lb/>
<pb n="295" entity="DSSR_000002932_0298"/>
are occupied with the fetid alligator, while the panther basks at its <lb/>
edge in the cane-brakes, almost impervious to man. Pouring its <lb/>
impetuous waters through wild tracks covered with trees of little <lb/>
value except for firewood, it sweeps down whole forests in its <lb/>
course, which disappear in tumultuous confusion, whirled away by <lb/>
the stream now loaded with the masses of soil which nourished their <lb/>
roots, often blocking up and changing for a time the channel of the <lb/>
river, which, as if in anger at its being opposed, inundates and <reg orig="dev-|astates">devastates</reg> <lb/>
the whole country round; and as soon as it forces its way <lb/>
through its former channel, plants in every direction the uprooted <lb/>
monarchs of the forest (upon whose branches the bird will never <lb/>
again perch, or the raccoon, the opossum, or the squirrel climb) as <lb/>
traps to the adventurous navigators of its waters by steam, who, <lb/>
borne down upon these concealed dangers which pierce through the <lb/>
planks, very often have not time to steer for and gain the shore <lb/>
before they sink to the bottom. There are no pleasing associations <lb/>
connected with the great common sewer of the Western America, <lb/>
which pours out its mud into the Mexican Gulf, polluting the <lb/>
clear blue sea for many miles beyond its mouth. It is a river of <lb/>
desolation; and instead of reminding you, like other beautiful rivers, <lb/>
of an angel which has descended for the benefit of man, you imagine <lb/>
it a devil, whose energies have been only overcome by the <reg orig="wonder-|ful">wonderful</reg> <lb/>
power of steam."</p>
<p>It is pretty crude literature for a man accustomed to <lb/>
handling a pen; still, as a panorama of the emotions sent <lb/>
weltering through this noted visitor's breast by the aspect <lb/>
and traditions of the "great common sewer," it has a value. <lb/>
A value, though marred in the matter of statistics by <reg orig="inac-|curacies">inaccuracies</reg>; <lb/>
for the catfish is a plenty good enough fish for <lb/>
anybody, and there are no panthers that are "impervious to <lb/>
man."</p>
<p>Later still comes Alexander Mackay, of the Middle Temple, <lb/>
Barrister at Law, with a better digestion, and no catfish dinner <lb/>
aboard, and feels as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The Mississippi! It was with indescribable emotions that I first <lb/>
felt myself afloat upon its waters. How often in my school-boy <lb/>
dreams, and in my waking visions afterwards, had my imagination <lb/>
<pb n="296" entity="DSSR_000002932_0299"/>
pictured to itself the lordly stream, rolling with tumultuous current <lb/>
through the boundless region to which it has given its name, and <lb/>
gathering into itself, in its course to the ocean, the tributary waters <lb/>
of almost every latitude in the temperate zone! Here it was then <lb/>
in its reality, and I, at length, steaming against its tide. I looked <lb/>
upon it with that reverence with which every one must regard a <lb/>
great feature of external nature."</p>
<p>So much for the emotions. The tourists, one and all, <lb/>
remark upon the deep, brooding loneliness and desolation <lb/>
of the vast river. Captain Basil Hall, who saw it at <reg orig="flood-|stage">flood-stage</reg>, <lb/>
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sometimes we passed along distances of twenty or thirty miles <lb/>
without seeing a single habitation. An artist, in search of hints <lb/>
for a painting of the deluge, would here have found them in <reg orig="abun-|dance">abundance</reg>."</p>
<p>The first shall be last, etc. Just two hundred years ago, <lb/>
the old original first and gallantest of all the foreign tourists, <lb/>
pioneer, head of the procession, ended his weary and tedious <lb/>
discovery-voyage down the solemn stretches of the great river <lb/>
&mdash;La Salle, whose name will last as long as the river itself <lb/>
shall last. We quote from Mr. Parkman:&mdash;</p>
<p>"And now they neared their journey's end. On the sixth of <lb/>
April, the river divided itself into three broad channels. La Salle <lb/>
followed that of the west, and D'Autray that of the east; while <lb/>
Tonty took the middle passage. As he drifted down the turbid <lb/>
current, between the low and marshy shores, the brackish water <lb/>
changed to brine, and the breeze grew fresh with the salt breath <lb/>
of the sea. Then the broad bosom of the great Gulf opened on his <lb/>
sight, tossing its restless billows, limitless, voiceless, lonely as when <lb/>
born of chaos, without a sail, without a sign of life."</p>
<p>Then, on a spot of solid ground, La Salle reared a column <lb/>
"bearing the arms of France; the Frenchmen were mustered <lb/>
under arms; and while the New England Indians and their <lb/>
squaws looked on in wondering silence, they chanted the <hi rend="italic">Te <lb/>
Deum,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Exaudiat,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Domine salvum fac regem.</hi>"</p>
<pb n="297" entity="DSSR_000002932_0300"/>
<p>Then, whilst the musketry volleyed and rejoicing shouts <lb/>
burst forth, the victorious discoverer planted the column, and <lb/>
made proclamation in a loud voice, taking formal possession <lb/>
of the river and the vast countries watered by it, in the name <lb/>
of the King. The column bore this inscription:&mdash;</p>
<q>LOUIS LE GRAND, ROY DE FRANCE ET DE NAVARRE, REGNE; <lb/>
LE NEUVIEME AVRIL, 1682.</q>
<p>New Orleans intended to fittingly celebrate, this present <lb/>
year, the bicentennial anniversary of this illustrious event; <lb/>
but when the time came, all her energies and surplus money <lb/>
were required in other directions, for the flood was upon the <lb/>
land then, making havoc and devastation everywhere.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">All</hi> day we swung along down the river, and had the <lb/>
stream almost wholly to ourselves. Formerly, at such <lb/>
a stage of the water, we should have passed acres of lumber <lb/>
rafts, and dozens of big coal barges; also occasional little <lb/>
trading-scows, peddling along from farm to farm, with the <lb/>
pedler's family on board; possibly, a random scow, bearing <lb/>
a humble Hamlet and Co. on an itinerant dramatic trip. <lb/>
But these were all absent. Far along in the day, we saw <lb/>
one steamboat; just one, and no more. She was lying <lb/>
at rest in the shade, within the wooded mouth of the Obion <lb/>
<pb n="299" entity="DSSR_000002932_0302"/>
River. The spy-glass revealed the fact that she was named <lb/>
for me&mdash;or <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was named for me, whichever you prefer. <lb/>
As this was the first time I had ever encountered this species <lb/>
of honor, it seems excusable to mention it, and at the same <lb/>
time call the attention of the authorities to the tardiness of <lb/>
my recognition of it.</p>
<p>Noted a big change in the river, at Island 21. It was a <lb/>
very large island, and used to lie out toward mid-stream; <lb/>
but it is joined fast to the main shore now, and has retired <lb/>
from business as an island.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">a government lamp.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>As we approached famous and formidable Plum Point, <lb/>
darkness fell, but that was nothing to shudder about&mdash;in <lb/>
these modern times. <lb/>
For now the <lb/>
national government has turned the <lb/>
Mississippi into a sort of two-<reg orig="thous-|and-mile">thousand-mile</reg> <lb/>
torch-light procession. In <lb/>
the head of every crossing, and in <lb/>
the foot of every crossing, the <reg orig="gov-|ernment">government</reg> <lb/>
has set up a clear-burning <lb/>
lamp. You are never entirely in <lb/>
the dark, now; there is always a <lb/>
beacon in sight, either before you, <lb/>
or behind you, or abreast. One <lb/>
might almost say that lamps have <lb/>
been squandered there. Dozens of <lb/>
crossings are lighted which were <lb/>
not shoal when they were created, <lb/>
and have never been shoal since; <lb/>
crossings so plain, too, and also <lb/>
so straight, that a steamboat can take herself through them <lb/>
without any help, after she has been through once. Lamps <lb/>
in such places are of course not wasted; it is much more <lb/>
convenient and comfortable for a pilot to hold on them than <lb/>
on a spread of formless blackness that won't stay still; and <lb/>
money is saved to the boat, at the same time, for she can <lb/>
of course make more miles with her rudder amidships than <lb/>
<pb n="300" entity="DSSR_000002932_0303"/>
she can with it squared across her stern and holding her <lb/>
back.</p>
<p>But this thing has knocked the romance out of piloting, <lb/>
to a large extent. It and some other things together, have <lb/>
knocked all the romance out of it. For instance, the peril <lb/>
from snags is not now what it once was. The government's <lb/>
snag-boats go patrolling up and down, in these matter-of-fact <lb/>
days, pulling the river's teeth; they have rooted out all the <lb/>
old clusters which made many localities so formidable; and <lb/>
they allow no new ones to collect. Formerly, if your boat <lb/>
got away from you, on a black night, and broke for the <lb/>
woods, it was an anxious time with you; so was it also, <lb/>
when you were groping your way through solidified <reg orig="dark-|ness">darkness</reg> <lb/>
in a narrow chute; but all that is changed now,&mdash;you <lb/>
flash out your electric light, transform night into day in the <lb/>
twinkling of an eye, and your perils and anxieties are at an <lb/>
end. Horace Bixby and George Ritchie have charted the <lb/>
crossings and laid out the courses by compass; they have <lb/>
invented a lamp to go with the chart, and have patented the <lb/>
whole. With these helps, one may run in the fog now, with <lb/>
considerable security, and with a confidence unknown in the <lb/>
old days.</p>
<figure id="f163" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0303">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"snags."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>With these abundant beacons, the banishment of snags, <lb/>
plenty of daylight in a box and ready to be turned on <reg orig="when-|ever">whenever</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="301" entity="DSSR_000002932_0304"/>
needed, and a chart and compass to fight the fog with, <lb/>
piloting, at a good stage of water, is now nearly as safe and <lb/>
simple as driving stage, and is hardly more than three times <lb/>
as romantic.</p>
<p>And now in these new days, these days of infinite change, <lb/>
the Anchor Line have raised the captain above the pilot by <lb/>
giving him the bigger wages of the two. This was going <lb/>
far, but they have not stopped there. They have decreed <lb/>
that the pilot shall remain at his post, and stand his watch <lb/>
clear through, whether the boat be under way or tied up <lb/>
to the shore. We, that were once the aristocrats of the <lb/>
river, can't go to bed now, as we used to do, and sleep while <lb/>
a hundred tons of freight are lugged aboard; no, we must <lb/>
sit in the pilot-house; and keep awake, too. Verily we are <lb/>
being treated like a parcel of mates and engineers. The <lb/>
Government has taken away the romance of our calling; the <lb/>
Company has taken away its state and dignity.</p>

<p>Plum Point looked as it had always looked by night, with <lb/>
the exception that now there were beacons to mark the <reg orig="cross-|ings">crossings</reg>, <lb/>
and also a lot of other lights on the Point and along <lb/>
its shore; these latter glinting from the fleet of the United <lb/>
States River Commission, and from a village which the <reg orig="offi-|cials">officials</reg> <lb/>
have built on the land for offices and for the employ&eacute;s <lb/>
of the service. The military engineers of the Commission <lb/>
<pb n="302" entity="DSSR_000002932_0305"/>
have taken upon their shoulders the job of making the <reg orig="Mis-|sissippi">Mississippi</reg> <lb/>
over again,&mdash;a job transcended in size by only the <lb/>
original job of creating it. They are building wing-dams <lb/>
here and there, to deflect the current; and dikes to confine <lb/>
it in narrower bounds; and other dikes to make it stay <lb/>
there; and for unnumbered miles along the Mississippi, they <lb/>
are felling the timber-front for fifty yards back, with the <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg> <lb/>
of shaving the bank down to low-water mark with the <lb/>
slant of a house-roof, and ballasting it with stones; and in <lb/>
many places they have protected the wasting shores with <lb/>
rows of piles. One who knows the Mississippi will promptly <lb/>
aver&mdash;not aloud, but to himself&mdash;that ten thousand River <lb/>
Commissions, with the mines of the world at their back, cannot <lb/>
tame that lawless stream, cannot curb it or confine it, <reg orig="can-|not">cannot</reg> <lb/>
say to it, Go here, or Go there, and make it obey; cannot <lb/>
save a shore which it has sentenced; cannot bar its path <lb/>
with an obstruction which it will not tear down, dance over, <lb/>
and laugh at. But a discreet man will not put these things <lb/>
into spoken words; for the West Point engineers have not <lb/>
their superiors anywhere; they know all that can be known <lb/>
of their abstruse science; and so, since they conceive that <lb/>
they can fetter and handcuff that river and boss him, it is <lb/>
but wisdom for the unscientific man to keep still, lie low, and <lb/>
wait till they do it. Captain Eads, with his jetties, has done <lb/>
a work at the mouth of the Mississippi which seemed clearly <lb/>
impossible; so we do not feel full confidence now to prophesy <lb/>
against like impossibilities. Otherwise one would pipe out <lb/>
and say the Commission might as well bully the comets in <lb/>
their courses and undertake to make them behave, as try to <lb/>
bully the Mississippi into right and reasonable conduct.</p>
<p>I consulted Uncle Mumford concerning this and cognate <lb/>
matters; and I give here the result, stenographically <lb/>
reported, and therefore to be relied on as being full and <reg orig="cor-|rect">correct</reg>; <lb/>
except that I have here and there left out remarks <lb/>
which were addressed to the men, such as "<hi rend="italic">where</hi> in blazes <lb/>
are you going with that barrel now?" and which seemed to <lb/>
<pb n="303" entity="DSSR_000002932_0306"/>
me to break the flow of the written statement, without <reg orig="com-|pensating">compensating</reg> <lb/>
by adding to its information or its clearness. Not <lb/>
that I have ventured to strike out all such interjections; I <lb/>
have removed only those which were obviously irrelevant; <lb/>
wherever one occurred which I felt any question about, I <lb/>
have judged it safest to let it remain.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section" id="d70">
<head>UNCLE MUMFORD'S IMPRESSIONS.</head>
<p>Uncle Mumford said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"As long as I have been mate of a steamboat,&mdash;thirty <lb/>
years&mdash;I have watched this river and studied it. Maybe I <lb/>
could have learnt more about it at West Point, but if I <lb/>
believe it I wish I may be WHAT <hi rend="italic">are you sucking your fingers <lb/>
there for?&mdash;Collar that kag of nails!</hi> Four years at West <lb/>
Point, and plenty of books and schooling, will learn a man a <lb/>
good deal, I reckon, but it won't learn him the river. You turn <lb/>
one of those little European rivers over to this Commission, <lb/>
with its hard bottom and clear water, and it would just be a <lb/>
holiday job for them to wall it, and pile it, and dike it, and <lb/>
tame it down, and boss it around, and make it go wherever <lb/>
they wanted it to, and stay where they put it, and do just as <lb/>
they said, every time. But this ain't that kind of a river. <lb/>
They have started in here with big confidence, and the best <lb/>
intentions in the world; but they are going to get left. What <lb/>
does Ecclesiastes vii. 13 say? Says enough to knock <hi rend="italic">their</hi> <lb/>
little game galley-west, don't it? Now you look at their <lb/>
methods once. There at Devil's Island, in the Upper River, <lb/>
they wanted the water to go one way, the water wanted to go <lb/>
another. So they put up a stone wall. But what does the <lb/>
river care for a stone wall? When it got ready, it just <lb/>
bulged through it. Maybe they can build another that will <lb/>
stay; that is, up there&mdash;but not down here they can't. <lb/>
Down here in the Lower River, they drive some pegs to turn <lb/>
the water away from the shore and stop it from slicing off <lb/>
the bank; very well, don't it go straight over and cut <reg orig="some-|body">somebody</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="304" entity="DSSR_000002932_0307"/>
else's bank? Certainly. Are they going to peg <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the <lb/>
banks? Why, they could buy ground and build a new <reg orig="Mis-|sissippi">Mississippi</reg> <lb/>
cheaper. They are pegging Bulletin Tow-head now. <lb/>
It won't do any good. If the river has got a mortgage on <lb/>
that island, it will foreclose, sure, pegs or no pegs. Away <lb/>
down yonder, they have driven two rows of piles straight <lb/>
through the middle of a dry bar half a mile long, which is <lb/>
forty foot out of the water when the river is low. What do <lb/>
you reckon that is for? If I know, I wish I may land <reg orig="in-|HUMP">in-HUMP</reg> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">yourself, you son of an undertaker!&mdash;out with that <lb/>
coal-oil, now, lively,</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">lively</hi>! And just look at what they are <lb/>
trying to do down there at Milliken's Bend. There's been a <lb/>
cut-off in that section, and Vicksburg is left out in the cold. <lb/>
It's a country town now. The river strikes in below it; and <lb/>
a boat can't go up to the town except in high water. Well, <lb/>
they are going to build wing-dams in the bend opposite the <lb/>
foot of 103, and throw the water over and cut off the foot <lb/>
of the island and plow down into an old ditch where the <lb/>
river used to be in ancient times; and they think they can <lb/>
persuade the water around that way, and get it to strike in <lb/>
above Vicksburg, as it used to do, and fetch the town back <lb/>
into the world again. That is, they are going to take this <lb/>
whole Mississippi, and twist it around and make it run <reg orig="sev-|eral">several</reg> <lb/>
miles <hi rend="italic">up stream.</hi> Well, you've got to admire men that <lb/>
deal in ideas of that size and can tote them around without <lb/>
crutches; but you have n't got to believe they can <hi rend="italic">do</hi> such <lb/>
miracles, have you? And yet you ain't absolutely obliged to <lb/>
believe they can't. I reckon the safe way, where a man can <lb/>
afford it, is to <hi rend="italic">copper</hi> the operation, and at the same time <lb/>
buy enough property in Vicksburg to square you up in case <lb/>
they win. Government is doing a deal for the Mississippi, <lb/>
now&mdash;spending loads of money on her. When there used <lb/>
to be four thousand steamboats and ten thousand acres of <lb/>
coal-barges, and rafts and trading scows, there was n't a <reg orig="lan-|tern">lantern</reg> <lb/>
from St. Paul to New Orleans, and the snags were thicker <lb/>
than bristles on a hog's back; and now when there's three

dozen steamboats and nary barge or raft, Government has <lb/>
snatched out all the snags, and lit up the shores like <reg orig="Broad-|way">Broadway</reg>, <lb/>
and a boat's as safe on the river as she'd be in heaven. <lb/>
And I reckon that by the time there ain't any boats left at all, <lb/>
the Commission will have the old thing all reorganized, and <lb/>
dredged out, and fenced in, and tidied up, to a degree that <lb/>
will make navigation just simply perfect, and absolutely <lb/>
safe and profitable; and all the days will be Sundays, and all <lb/>
the mates will be Sunday-school su WHAT-<hi rend="italic">in-the-nation-<reg orig="you-|fooling-around-there-for">you-fooling-around-there-for</reg>, <lb/>

<p>During our trip to New Orleans and back, we had many <lb/>
conversations with river men, planters, journalists, and <reg orig="offi-|cers">officers</reg> <lb/>
of the River Commission&mdash;with conflicting and <reg orig="confus-|ing">confusing</reg> <lb/>
results. To wit:&mdash;
<list>
<item><p>1. Some believed in the Commission's scheme to arbitrarily <lb/>
and permanently confine (and thus deepen) the channel, <lb/>
preserve threatened shores, etc.</p></item>
<item><p>2. Some believed that the Commission's money ought to <lb/>
be spent only on building and repairing the great system of <lb/>
levees.</p></item>
<item><p>3. Some believed that the higher you build your levee, <lb/>
the higher the river's bottom will rise; and that <reg orig="conse-|quently">consequently</reg> <lb/>
the levee system is a mistake.</p></item>
<item><p>4. Some believed in the scheme to relieve the river, in <lb/>
flood-time, by turning its surplus waters off into Lake <lb/>
Borgne, etc.</p></item>
<item><p>5. Some believed in the scheme of northern lake-reservoirs <lb/>
to replenish the Mississippi in low-water seasons.</p></item>
</list></p>
<p>Wherever you find a man down there who believes in one <lb/>
of these theories you may turn to the next man and frame <lb/>
your talk upon the hypothesis that he does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> believe in that <lb/>
theory; and after you have had experience, you do not take <lb/>
this course doubtfully, or hesitatingly, but with the <reg orig="confi-|dence">confidence</reg> <lb/>
of a dying murderer&mdash;converted one, I mean. For you <lb/>
<pb n="308" entity="DSSR_000002932_0311"/>
will have come to know, with a deep and restful certainty, <lb/>
that you are not going to meet two people sick of the same <lb/>
theory, one right after the other. No, there will always be <lb/>
one or two with the other diseases along between. And as <lb/>
you proceed, you will find out one or two other things. You <lb/>
will find out that there is no distemper of the lot but is <reg orig="con-|tagious">contagious</reg>; <lb/>
and you cannot go where it is without catching it. <lb/>
You may vaccinate yourself with deterrent facts as much as</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">talking over the situation.</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="309" entity="DSSR_000002932_0312"/>
<p>you please&mdash;it will do no good; it will seem to "take," but <lb/>
it does n't; the moment you rub against any one of those <lb/>
theorists, make up your mind that it is time to hang out <lb/>
your yellow flag.</p>
<p>Yes, you are his sure victim: yet his work is not all to <lb/>
your hurt&mdash;only part of it; for he is like your family <reg orig="phy-|sician">physician</reg>, <lb/>
who comes and cures the mumps, and leaves the <lb/>
scarlet-fever behind. If your man is a Lake-Borgne-relief <lb/>
theorist, for instance, he will exhale a cloud of deadly facts <lb/>
and statistics which will lay you out with that disease, sure; <lb/>
but at the same time he will cure you of any other of the <lb/>
five theories that may have previously got into your system.</p>
<p>I have had all the five; and had them "bad;" but ask <lb/>
me not, in mournful numbers, which one racked me hardest, <lb/>
or which one numbered the biggest sick list, for I do not <lb/>
know. In truth, no one can answer the latter question. <lb/>
Mississippi Improvement is a mighty topic, down yonder. <lb/>
Every man on the river banks, south of Cairo, talks about it <lb/>
every day, during such moments as he is able to spare from <lb/>
talking about the war; and each of the several chief theories <lb/>
has its host of zealous partisans; but, as I have said, it is not <lb/>
possible to determine which cause numbers the most recruits.</p>
<p>All were agreed upon one point, however: if Congress <lb/>
would make a sufficient appropriation, a colossal benefit <lb/>

been made&mdash;possibly a sufficient one, certainly not too large <lb/>
a one. Let us hope that the prophecy will be amply <reg orig="ful-|filled">fulfilled</reg>.</p>
<p>One thing will be easily granted by the reader; that an <lb/>
opinion from Mr. Edward Atkinson, upon any vast national <lb/>
commercial matter, comes as near ranking as authority, as <lb/>
can the opinion of any individual in the Union. What he <lb/>
has to say about Mississippi River Improvement will be <lb/>

<p>Sometimes, half a dozen figures will reveal, as with a <reg orig="light-|ning-flash">lightning-flash</reg>, <lb/>
the importance of a subject which ten thousand <lb/>
labored words, with the same purpose in view, had left at <lb/>
last but dim and uncertain. Here is a case of the sort&mdash; <lb/>
paragraph from the "Cincinnati Commercial:"&mdash;</p>
<p>"The towboat 'Jos. B. Williams' is on her way to New Orleans <lb/>
with a tow of thirty-two barges, containing six hundred thousand <lb/>
bushels (seventy-six pounds to the bushel) of coal exclusive of her <lb/>
own fuel, being the largest tow ever taken to New Orleans or <reg orig="any-|where">anywhere</reg> <lb/>
else in the world. Her freight bill, at 3 cents a bushel, <lb/>
amounts to $18,000. It would take eighteen hundred cars, of three <lb/>
hundred and thirty-three bushels to the car, to transport this amount <lb/>
of coal. At $10 per ton, or $100 per car, which would be a fair <lb/>
price for the distance by rail, the freight bill would amount to <lb/>
$180,000, or $162,000 more by rail than by river. The tow will <lb/>
be taken from Pittsburg to New Orleans in fourteen or fifteen days. <lb/>
It would take one hundred trains of eighteen cars to the train to <lb/>
transport this one tow of six hundred thousand bushels of coal, and <lb/>
even if it made the usual speed of fast freight lines, it would take <lb/>
one whole summer to put it through by rail."</p>

<p>When a river in good condition can enable one to save <lb/>
$162,000 and a whole summer's time, on a single cargo, the <lb/>
wisdom of taking measures to keep the river in good <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg> <lb/>

<head>A FEW SPECIMEN BRICKS.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> passed through the Plum Point region, turned <reg orig="Craig-|head's">Craighead's</reg> <lb/>
Point, and glided unchallenged by what was <lb/>
once the formidable Fort Pillow, memorable because of the <lb/>
massacre perpetrated there during the war. Massacres are <lb/>
sprinkled with some frequency through the histories of <reg orig="sev-|eral">several</reg> <lb/>
Christian nations, but this is almost the only one that <lb/>
can be found in American history; perhaps it is the only one <lb/>
which rises to a size correspondent to that huge and sombre <lb/>
title. We have the "Boston Massacre," where two or three <lb/>
people were killed; but we must bunch Anglo-Saxon history <lb/>
together to find the fellow to the Fort Pillow tragedy; and <lb/>
doubtless even then we must travel back to the days and the <lb/>
performances of C&oelig;ur de Lion, that fine "hero," before we <lb/>
accomplish it.</p>
<p>More of the river's freaks. In times past, the channel <lb/>
used to strike above Island 37, by Brandywine Bar, and <lb/>
down towards Island 39. Afterward, changed its course <lb/>
and went from Brandywine down through Vogelman's chute <lb/>
in the Devil's Elbow, to Island 39&mdash;part of this course <lb/>
reversing the old order; the river running <hi rend="italic">up</hi> four or five <lb/>
miles, instead of down, and cutting off, throughout, some <lb/>
fifteen miles of distance. This in 1876. All that region <lb/>
is now called Centennial Island.</p>
<p>There is a tradition that Island 37 was one of the <lb/>
principal abiding places of the once celebrated "Murel's <lb/>
Gang." This was a colossal combination of robbers, <reg orig="horse-|thieves">horse-thieves</reg>, <lb/>
negro-stealers, and counterfeiters, engaged in <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="312" entity="DSSR_000002932_0315"/>
along the river some fifty or sixty years ago. While <lb/>
our journey across the country towards St. Louis was in <lb/>
progress we had had no end of Jesse James and his stirring <lb/>
history; for he had just been assassinated by an agent of <lb/>
the Governor of <reg orig="Mis-|souri">Missouri</reg>, <lb/>
and was in <reg orig="con-|sequence">consequence</reg> <lb/>
occupying a <lb/>
good deal of space in <lb/>
the newspapers. <lb/>
Cheap histories of <lb/>
him were for sale by <lb/>
train boys. <lb/>
<reg orig="Accord-|ing">According</reg> <lb/>
to these, he was <lb/>
the most marvellous <lb/>
creature of his kind <lb/>
that had ever existed. <lb/>
It was a mistake. <lb/>
Murel was his equal <lb/>
in boldness; in pluck; <lb/>
in rapacity; in <reg orig="cruel-|ty">cruelty</reg>, <lb/>
brutality, <reg orig="heart-|lessness">heartlessness</reg>, <lb/>
treachery, <lb/>
and in general and <lb/>

and shamelessness; and very much his superior in some <lb/>
larger aspects. James was a retail rascal; Murel, <reg orig="whole-|sale">wholesale</reg>. <lb/>
James's modest genius dreamed of no loftier flight <lb/>
than the planning of raids upon cars, coaches, and country <lb/>
banks; Murel projected negro insurrections and the capture <lb/>
of New Orleans; and furthermore, on occasion, this Murel <lb/>
could go into a pulpit and edify the congregation. What <lb/>
are James and his half-dozen vulgar rascals compared <lb/>
with this stately old-time criminal, with his sermons, his <lb/>
meditated insurrections and city-captures, and his <reg orig="ma-|jestic">majestic</reg> <lb/>

<q>
<p>He appears to have been a most dexterous as well as consummate <lb/>
villain. When he travelled, his usual disguise was that of an <reg orig="itiner-|ant">itinerant</reg> <lb/>
preacher; and it is said that his discourses were very "<reg orig='soul-|moving"&mdash;interesting'>soulmoving"&mdash;interesting</reg> <lb/>
the hearers so much that they forgot to look <lb/>
after their horses, which were carried away by his confederates while <lb/>
<pb n="314" entity="DSSR_000002932_0317"/>
he was preaching. But the stealing of horses in one State, and selling <lb/>
them in another, was but a small portion of their business; the most <lb/>
lucrative was the enticing slaves to run away from their masters, <lb/>
that they might sell them in another quarter. This was arranged <lb/>
as follows; they would tell a negro that if he would run away from <lb/>
his master, and allow them to sell him, he should receive a portion <lb/>
of the money paid for him, and that upon his return to them a <lb/>
second time they would send him to a free State, where he would <lb/>
be safe. The poor wretches complied with this request, hoping to <lb/>
obtain money and <reg orig="free-|dom">freedom</reg>; <lb/>
they would be <lb/>
sold to another master, <lb/>
and run away again to <lb/>
their employers; <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
they would be <lb/>
sold in this manner <lb/>
three or four times, <reg orig="un-|til">until</reg> <lb/>
they had realized <lb/>
three or four thousand <lb/>
dollars by them; but as, <lb/>
after this, there was <lb/>
fear of detection, the <lb/>
usual custom was to get <lb/>
rid of the only witness <lb/>
that could be produced <lb/>
against them, which was <lb/>
the negro himself, by <lb/>
murdering him, and <lb/>
throwing his body into <lb/>
the Mississippi. Even <lb/>
if it was established that <lb/>
they had stolen a negro, <lb/>
before he was murdered, <lb/>
they were always prepared to evade punishment; for they <reg orig="con-|cealed">concealed</reg> <lb/>
the negro who had run away, until he was advertised, <lb/>
and a reward offered to any man who would catch him. An <reg orig="adver-|tisement">advertisement</reg> <lb/>
of this kind warrants the person to take the property, if <lb/>
found. And then the negro becomes a property in trust, when, <lb/>
<figure id="f170" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0317">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">concealed in the brake.</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="315" entity="DSSR_000002932_0318"/>
therefore, they sold the negro, it only became a breach of trust, <lb/>
not stealing; and for a breach of trust, the owner of the property <lb/>
can only have redress by a civil action, which was useless, as the <lb/>
damages were never paid. It may be inquired, how it was that <lb/>
Murel escaped Lynch law under such circumstances? This will be <lb/>
easily understood when it is stated that he had <hi rend="italic">more than a <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg> <lb/>
sworn confederates,</hi> all ready at a moment's notice to support <lb/>
any of the gang who might be in trouble. The names of all the <lb/>
principal confederates of Murel were obtained from himself, in a <lb/>
manner which I shall presently explain. The gang was composed <lb/>
of two classes: the Heads or Council, as they were called, who <lb/>
planned and concerted, but seldom acted; they amounted to about <lb/>
four hundred. The other class were the active agents, and were <lb/>
termed strikers, and amounted to about six hundred and fifty. <lb/>
These were the tools in the hands of the others; they ran all the <lb/>
risk, and received but a small portion of the money; they were in <lb/>
the power of the leaders of the gang, who would sacrifice them at <lb/>
any time by handing them over to justice, or sinking their bodies in <lb/>
the Mississippi. The general rendezvous of this gang of miscreants <lb/>
was on the Arkansas side of the river, where they concealed their <lb/>
negroes in the morasses and cane-brakes.</p>
<p>The depredations of this extensive combination were severely <lb/>
felt; but so well were their plans arranged, that although Murel, <lb/>
who was always active, was everywhere suspected, there was no <lb/>
proof to be obtained. It so happened, however, that a young man <lb/>
of the name of Stewart, who was looking after two slaves which <lb/>
Murel had decoyed away, fell in with him and obtained his <reg orig="confi-|dence">confidence</reg>, <lb/>
took the oath, and was admitted into the gang as one of <lb/>
the General Council. By this means all was discovered; for <reg orig="Stew-|art">Stewart</reg> <lb/>
turned traitor, although he had taken the oath, and having <lb/>
obtained every information, exposed the whole concern, the names <lb/>
of all the parties, and finally succeeded in bringing home sufficient <lb/>
evidence against Murel, to procure his conviction and sentence to <lb/>
the Penitentiary (Murel was sentenced to fourteen years' <reg orig="imprison-|ment)">imprisonment)</reg>; <lb/>
so many people who were supposed to be honest, and bore a <lb/>
respectable name in the different States, were found to be among the <lb/>
list of the Grand Council as published by Stewart, that every attempt <lb/>
was made to throw discredit upon his assertions&mdash;his character <lb/>
<pb n="316" entity="DSSR_000002932_0319"/>
was vilified, and more than one attempt was made to assassinate <lb/>
him. He was obliged to quit the Southern States in consequence. It <lb/>
is, however, now well ascertained to have been all true; and although <lb/>
some blame Mr. Stewart for having violated his oath, they no longer <lb/>
attempt to deny that his revelations were correct. I will quote <lb/>
one or two portions of Murel's confessions to Mr. Stewart, made <lb/>
to him when they were journeying together. I ought to have <lb/>
observed, that the <reg orig="ul-|timate">ultimate</reg> <lb/>
intentions of <lb/>
Murel and his <reg orig="asso-|ciates">associates</reg> <lb/>
were, by his <lb/>
own account, on a <lb/>
very extended scale; <lb/>
having no less an <reg orig="ob-|ject">object</reg> <lb/>
in view than <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">raising the blacks <lb/>
against the whites, <lb/>
taking possession of, <lb/>
and plundering New <lb/>
Orleans, and making <lb/>
themselves possessors <lb/>
of the territory.</hi> The <lb/>
following are a few <lb/>
extracts:&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f171" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0319">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">a man came in sight.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"I collected all <lb/>
my friends about <lb/>
New Orleans at one <lb/>
of our friends' <reg orig="hous-|es">houses</reg> <lb/>
in that place, and <lb/>
we sat in council <lb/>
three days before we <lb/>
got all our plans to our notion; we then determined to undertake <lb/>
the rebellion at every hazard, and make as many friends as we could <lb/>
for that purpose. Every man's business being assigned him, I <lb/>
started to Natchez on foot, having sold my horse in New Orleans, <lb/>
&mdash;with the intention of stealing another after I started. I walked <lb/>
four days, and no opportunity offered for me to get a horse. The <lb/>
fifth day, about twelve, I had become tired, and stopped at a creek <lb/>
<pb n="317" entity="DSSR_000002932_0320"/>
to get some water and rest a little. While I was sitting on a log, <lb/>
looking down the road the way that I had come, a man came in <lb/>
sight riding on a good-looking horse. The very moment I saw him, <lb/>
I was determined to <lb/>
have his horse, if he <lb/>
was in the garb of <lb/>
a traveller. He <lb/>
rode up, and I saw <lb/>
from his equipage <lb/>
that he was a <reg orig="trav-|eller">traveller</reg>. <lb/>
I arose and drew an elegant rifle pistol on him and ordered <lb/>
him to dismount. He did so, and I took his horse by the bridle <lb/>
and pointed down the creek, and ordered him to walk before me. <lb/>
He went a few hundred yards and stopped. I hitched his horse, <lb/>
and then made him undress himself, all to his shirt and drawers, <lb/>
<figure id="f172" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0320">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">i shot him through the head.</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="318" entity="DSSR_000002932_0321"/>
and ordered him to turn his back to me. He said, 'If you are <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg> <lb/>
to kill me, let me have time to pray before I die.' I told <lb/>
him I had no time to hear him pray. He turned around and <lb/>
dropped on his knees, and I shot him through the back of the <lb/>
head. I ripped open his belly and took out his entrails, and sunk <lb/>
him in the creek. I then searched his pockets, and found four <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
dollars and thirty seven cents, and a number of papers that <lb/>
I did not take time to examine. I sunk the pocket-book and <lb/>
papers and his hat, in the creek. His boots were bran-new, and <lb/>
fitted me genteelly; and I put them on and sunk my old shoes in the <lb/>
creek, to atone for them. I rolled up his clothes and put them <lb/>
into his portmanteau, as they were bran-new cloth of the best <lb/>
quality. I mounted as fine a horse as ever I straddled, and <lb/>
directed my course for Natchez in much better style than I had <lb/>
been for the last five days.</p>
<p>"Myself and a fellow by the name of Crenshaw gathered four <lb/>
good horses and started for Georgia. We got in company with a <lb/>
young South Carolinian just before we got to Cumberland <reg orig="Moun-|tain">Mountain</reg>, <lb/>
and Crenshaw soon knew all about his business. He had been <lb/>
to Tennessee to buy a drove of hogs, but when he got there pork <lb/>
was dearer than he calculated, and he declined purchasing. We <lb/>
concluded he was a prize. Crenshaw winked at me; I understood <lb/>
his idea. Crenshaw had travelled the road before, but I never had; <lb/>
we had travelled several miles on the mountain, when he passed near <lb/>
a great precipice; just before we passed it Crenshaw asked me for <lb/>
my whip, which had a pound of lead in the butt; I handed it to him, <lb/>
and he rode up by the side of the South Carolinian, and gave him a <lb/>
blow on the side of the head and tumbled him from his horse; we <lb/>
lit from our horses and fingered his pockets; we got twelve hundred <lb/>
and sixty-two dollars. Crenshaw said he knew a place to hide him, <lb/>
and he gathered him under his arms, and I by his feet, and <reg orig="con-|veyed">conveyed</reg> <lb/>
him to a deep crevice in the brow of the precipice, and <lb/>
tumbled him into it, and he went out of sight; we then tumbled <lb/>
in his saddle, and took his horse with us, which was worth two <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
dollars.</p>
<p>"We were detained a few days, and during that time our friend <lb/>
went to a little village in the neighborhood and saw the negro <lb/>
advertised (a negro in our possession), and a description of the <lb/>
<pb n="319" entity="DSSR_000002932_0322"/>
two men of whom he had been purchased, and giving his <reg orig="sus-|picions">suspicions</reg> <lb/>
of the men. It was rather squally times, but any port in <lb/>
a storm: we took <lb/>
the negro that night <lb/>
on the bank of <lb/>
a creek which runs <lb/>
by the farm of <lb/>
our friend, and <lb/>
Crenshaw shot him <lb/>
through the head. We took out his entrails and sunk him in the <lb/>
creek.</p>

<p>"He had sold the other negro the third time on Arkansaw River <lb/>
for upwards of five hundred dollars; and then stole him and <reg orig="deliv-|ered">delivered</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="320" entity="DSSR_000002932_0323"/>
him into the hand of his friend, who conducted him to a swamp, <lb/>
and veiled the tragic scene, and got the last gleanings and sacred <lb/>
pledge of secrecy; as a game of that kind will not do unless it ends <lb/>
in a mystery to all but the fraternity. He sold the negro, first and <lb/>
last, for nearly <lb/>
two thousand <reg orig="dol-|lars">dollars</reg>, <lb/>
and then <lb/>
put him forever <lb/>
out of the reach <lb/>
of all pursuers; <lb/>
and they can <lb/>

<p>We were <reg orig="ap-|proaching">approaching</reg> <lb/>
<lb/>
Memphis, in <lb/>
front of which <lb/>
city, and <reg orig="wit-|nessed">witnessed</reg> <lb/>
by its <lb/>
people, was <lb/>
fought the <lb/>
most famous of <lb/>
the river battles of the Civil War. Two men whom I had <lb/>
served under, in my river days, took part in that fight: Mr. <lb/>
Bixby, head pilot of the Union fleet, and Montgomery, <reg orig="Com-|modore">Commodore</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="321" entity="DSSR_000002932_0324"/>
of the Confederate fleet. Both saw a great deal of <lb/>
active service during the war, and achieved high reputations <lb/>
for pluck and capacity.</p>
<p>As we neared Memphis, we began to cast about for an <lb/>
excuse to stay with the "Gold Dust" to the end of her <lb/>
course&mdash;Vicksburg. We were so pleasantly situated, that <lb/>
we did not wish to make a change. I had an errand of <lb/>
considerable importance to do at Napoleon, Arkansas, but <lb/>
perhaps I could manage it without quitting the "Gold Dust." <lb/>
I said as much; so we decided to stick to present quarters.</p>
<p>The boat was to tarry at Memphis till ten the next <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>. <lb/>
It is a beautiful city, nobly situated on a commanding <lb/>
bluff overlooking the river. The streets are straight and <lb/>
spacious, though not paved in a way to incite distempered <lb/>
admiration. No, the admiration must be reserved for the <lb/>
town's sewerage system, which is called perfect; a recent <lb/>
reform, however, for it was just the other way, up to a few <lb/>
years ago&mdash;a reform resulting from the lesson taught by a <lb/>
desolating visitation of the yellow-fever. In those awful <lb/>
days the people were swept off by hundreds, by thousands; <lb/>
and so great was the reduction caused by flight and by death <lb/>
together, that the population was diminished three-fourths, <lb/>
and so remained for a time. Business stood nearly still, and <lb/>
the streets bore an empty Sunday aspect.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of Memphis, at that disastrous time, <lb/>
drawn by a German tourist who seems to have been an <reg orig="eye-|witness">eyewitness</reg> <lb/>
of the scenes which he describes. It is from Chapter <lb/>
VII., of his book, just published, in Leipzig, "<reg orig="Mississippi-|Fahrten">Mississippi-Fahrten</reg>, <lb/>
von Ernst von Hesse-Wartegg:"&mdash;</p>
<p>"In August the yellow-fever had reached its extremest height. <lb/>
Daily, hundreds fell a sacrifice to the terrible epidemic. The city <lb/>
was become a mighty graveyard, two-thirds of the population had <lb/>
deserted the place, and only the poor, the aged and the sick, <lb/>
remained behind, a sure prey for the insidious enemy. The houses <lb/>
were closed: little lamps burned in front of many&mdash;a sign that here <lb/>
death had entered. Often, several lay dead in a single house; <lb/>
<pb n="322" entity="DSSR_000002932_0325"/>
from the windows hung black crape. The stores were shut up, for <lb/>
their owners were gone away or dead.</p>
<p>"Fearful evil! In the briefest space it struck down and swept <lb/>
away even the most vigorous victim. A slight indisposition, then <lb/>
an hour of fever, then the hideous delirium, then&mdash;the Yellow <lb/>
Death! On the street corners, and in the squares, lay sick men, <lb/>
suddenly overtaken by the disease; and even corpses, distorted and <lb/>
rigid. Food failed. Meat spoiled in a few hours in the fetid <lb/>
and pestiferous air, and turned black.</p>
<p>"Fearful clamors issue from many houses; then after a season <lb/>
they cease, and all is still: noble, self-sacrificing men come with the <lb/>
coffin, nail it <lb/>
up, and carry <lb/>
it away, to <lb/>
the graveyard. In <lb/>
the night stillness <lb/>
reigns. Only the <lb/>
physicians and the hearses hurry through the streets; and out of <lb/>
the distance, at intervals, comes the muffled thunder of the railway <lb/>
train, which with the speed of the wind, and as if hunted by furies, <lb/>
flies by the pest-ridden city without halting."</p>

</figure>
<pb n="323" entity="DSSR_000002932_0326"/>
<p>But there is life enough there now. The population <lb/>
exceeds forty thousand and is augmenting, and trade is in a <lb/>
flourishing condition. We drove about the city; visited the <lb/>
park and the sociable horde of squirrels there; saw the <lb/>
fine residences, rose-clad and in other ways enticing to <lb/>
the eye; and got a good breakfast at the hotel.</p>
<p>A thriving place is the Good Samaritan City of the <lb/>
Mississippi: has a great wholesale jobbing trade; foundries, <lb/>
machine shops; and manufactories of wagons, carriages, <lb/>
and cotton-seed oil; and is shortly to have cotton mills and <lb/>
elevators.</p>
<p>Her cotton receipts reached five hundred thousand bales <lb/>
last year&mdash;an increase of sixty thousand over the year <lb/>
before. Out from her healthy commercial heart issue five <lb/>
trunk lines of railway; and a sixth is being added.</p>
<p>This is a very different Memphis from the one which the <lb/>
vanished and unremembered procession of foreign tourists <lb/>
used to put into their books long time ago. In the days of <lb/>
the now forgotten but once renowned and vigorously hated <lb/>
Mrs. Trollope, Memphis seems to have consisted mainly of <lb/>
one long street of log-houses, with some outlying cabins <lb/>
sprinkled around rearward toward the woods; and now and <lb/>
then a pig, and no end of mud. That was fifty-five years <lb/>
ago. She stopped at the hotel. Plainly it was not the one <lb/>
which gave us our breakfast. She says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The table was laid for fifty persons, and was nearly full. <lb/>
They ate in perfect silence, and with such astonishing rapidity that <lb/>
their dinner was over literally before ours was begun; the only <lb/>
sounds heard were those produced by the knives and forks, with the <lb/>
unceasing chorus of coughing, <hi rend="italic">etc.</hi>"</p>
<p>"Coughing, <hi rend="italic">etc.</hi>" The "etc." stands for an unpleasant <lb/>
word there, a word which she does not always charitably <lb/>
cover up, but sometimes prints. You will find it in the <lb/>

ignorant swells they were, tinselled with the usual <lb/>

shams and windy pretence:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The total want of all the usual courtesies of the table; the <lb/>

the <lb/>

the whole blade seemed to enter into the mouth; and the still more <lb/>
frightful manner of cleaning the teeth afterward with a pocket <lb/>

generals, colonels, and majors of the old world; and that the dinner <lb/>
hour was to be anything rather than an hour of enjoyment."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was a big river, below Memphis; banks brimming full, <lb/>
everywhere, and very frequently more than full, the <lb/>
waters pouring out over the land, flooding the woods and <lb/>
fields for miles into the interior; and in places, to a depth of <lb/>
fifteen feet; signs, all about, of men's hard work gone to ruin, <lb/>
and all to be <lb/>
done over <lb/>
again, with <lb/>
straitened <lb/>
means and a <lb/>
weakened <lb/>
courage. <lb/>
A <lb/>
melancholy <lb/>
picture, and <lb/>

<reg orig="one;&mdash;hun-|dreds">one;&mdash;hundreds</reg> <lb/>

of it. <reg orig="Some-|times">Sometimes</reg> <lb/>
the <reg orig="bea-|con">beacon</reg> <lb/>
lights <lb/>
stood in <reg orig="wa-|ter">water</reg> <lb/>
three feet deep, in the edge of dense forests which <lb/>
extended for miles without farm, wood-yard, clearing, or <lb/>
break of any kind; which meant that the keeper of the <lb/>
light must come in a skiff a great distance to discharge his <lb/>
trust,&mdash;and often in desperate weather. Yet I was told that <lb/>
the work is faithfully performed, in all weathers; and not <lb/>
<pb n="326" entity="DSSR_000002932_0329"/>
always by men, sometimes by women, if the man is sick or <lb/>
absent. The Government furnishes oil, and pays ten or <lb/>
fifteen dollars a month for the lighting and tending. A <lb/>
Government boat distributes oil and pays wages once a <lb/>
month.</p>
<p>The Ship Island region was as woodsy and tenantless as <lb/>
ever. The island has ceased to be an island; has joined <lb/>
itself compactly to the main shore, and wagons travel, now, <lb/>
where the steamboats used to navigate. No signs left of the <lb/>
wreck of the "Pennsylvania." Some farmer will turn up her <lb/>
bones with his plow one day, no doubt, and be surprised.</p>
<p>We were getting down now into the migrating negro <lb/>
region. These poor people could never travel when they <lb/>
were slaves; so they make up for the privation now. They <lb/>
stay on a plantation till the desire to travel seizes them; then <lb/>
they pack up, hail a steamboat, and clear out. Not for any <lb/>
particular place; no, nearly any place will answer; they only <lb/>
want to be moving. The amount of money on hand will <lb/>
answer the rest of the conundrum for them. If it will take <lb/>
them fifty miles, very well; let it be fifty. If not, a shorter <lb/>
flight will do.</p>
<p>During a couple of days, we frequently answered these <lb/>
hails. Sometimes there was a group of high-water-stained, <lb/>
tumble-down cabins, populous with colored folk, and no <lb/>
whites visible; with grassless patches of dry ground here and <lb/>
there; a few felled trees, with skeleton cattle, mules, and <lb/>
horses, eating the leaves and gnawing the bark&mdash;no other <lb/>
food for them in the flood-wasted land. Sometimes there <lb/>
was a single lonely landing-cabin; near it the colored family <lb/>
that had hailed us; little and big, old and young, roosting on <lb/>
the scant pile of household goods; these consisting of a rusty <lb/>
gun, some bedticks, chests, tinware, stools, a crippled <reg orig="looking-|glass">looking-glass</reg>, <lb/>
a venerable arm-chair, and six or eight base-born and <lb/>
spiritless yellow curs, attached to the family by strings. <lb/>
They must have their dogs; can't go without their dogs. <lb/>
Yet the dogs are never willing; they always object; so, one <lb/>
<pb n="327" entity="DSSR_000002932_0330"/>
after another, in ridiculous procession, they are dragged <lb/>
aboard; all four feet braced and sliding along the stage, head <lb/>
likely to be pulled off; but the tugger marching determinedly <lb/>
forward, bending to his work, with the rope over his shoulder <lb/>
for better purchase. Sometimes a child is forgotten and <lb/>
left on the bank; but never a dog.</p>

<p>The usual river-gossip going on in the pilot-house. Island <lb/>
No. 63&mdash;an island with a lovely "chute," or passage, <lb/>
behind it in the former <lb/>
times. They said Jesse <lb/>
Jamieson, in the "<reg orig="Sky-|lark">Skylark</reg>," <lb/>
had a visiting pilot <lb/>
with him one trip&mdash;a <lb/>
poor old broken-down, superannuated fellow&mdash;left him at <lb/>
the wheel, at the foot of 63, to run off the watch. The <lb/>
ancient mariner went up through the chute, and down <lb/>
the river outside; and up the chute and down the river <lb/>
<pb n="328" entity="DSSR_000002932_0331"/>
again; and yet again and again; and handed the boat over <lb/>
to the relieving pilot, at the end of three hours of honest <lb/>
endeavor, at the same old foot of the island where he had <lb/>
originally taken the wheel! A darkey on shore who had <lb/>
observed the boat go by, about thirteen times, said, "'clar to <lb/>
gracious, I would n't be s'prised if dey's a whole line o' dem <lb/>
Sk'ylarks!"</p>
<p>Anecdote illustrative of influence of reputation in the <lb/>
changing of opinion. The "Eclipse" was renowned for her <lb/>
swiftness. One day she passed along; an old darkey on shore, <lb/>
absorbed in his <lb/>
own matters, did <lb/>
not notice what <lb/>
steamer it was. <lb/>
Presently some <lb/>
one asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Any boat gone <lb/>
up?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sah."</p>
<p>"Was she <reg orig="go-|ing">going</reg> <lb/>
fast?"</p>
<p>"Oh, so-so&mdash; <lb/>

<p>"Now, do you <lb/>

that was?"</p>
<p>"No, sah."</p>

</figure>
<p>Piece of history illustrative of the violent style of some of <lb/>
the people down along here. During the early weeks of high <lb/>
water, A's fence rails washed down on B's ground, and B's <lb/>
rails washed up in the eddy and landed on A's ground. A said, <lb/>
<pb n="329" entity="DSSR_000002932_0332"/>
"Let the thing remain so; I will use your rails, and you <lb/>
use mine." But B objected&mdash;would n't have it so. One <lb/>
day, A came down on B's ground to get his rails. B said. <lb/>
"I'll kill you!" and proceeded for him with his revolver. <lb/>
A said, "I'm not armed." So B, who wished to do only <lb/>
what was right, threw down his revolver; then pulled a knife, <lb/>
and cut A's throat all around, but gave his principal attention <lb/>
to the front, and so failed to sever the jugular. Struggling <lb/>
around, A managed to get his hands on the discarded <lb/>
revolver, and shot B dead with it&mdash;and recovered from his <lb/>
own injuries.</p>
<p>Further gossip;&mdash;after which, everybody went below to <lb/>
get afternoon coffee, and left me at the wheel, alone. <reg orig="Some-|thing">Something</reg> <lb/>
presently reminded me of our last hour in St. Louis, <lb/>
part of which I spent on this boat's hurricane deck, aft. I <lb/>
was joined there by a stranger, who dropped into conversation <lb/>
with me&mdash;a brisk young fellow, who said he was born in a <lb/>
town in the interior of Wisconsin, and had never seen a <lb/>
steamboat until a week before. Also said that on the way <lb/>
down from La Crosse he had inspected and examined his boat <lb/>
so diligently and with such passionate interest that he had <lb/>
mastered the whole thing from stem to rudder-blade. Asked <lb/>
me where I was from. I answered, New England. "Oh, a <lb/>
Yank!" said he; and went chatting straight along, without <lb/>
waiting for assent or denial. He immediately proposed to <lb/>
take me all over the boat and tell me the names of her <lb/>
different parts, and teach me their uses. Before I could <lb/>
enter protest or excuse, he was already rattling glibly away <lb/>
at his benevolent work; and when I perceived that he was <lb/>
misnaming the things, and inhospitably amusing himself at <lb/>
the expense of an innocent stranger from a far country, I <lb/>
held my peace, and let him have his way. He gave me a <lb/>
world of misinformation; and the further he went, the wider <lb/>
his imagination expanded, and the more he enjoyed his cruel <lb/>
work of deceit. Sometimes, after palming off a particularly <lb/>
fantastic and outrageous lie upon me, he was so "full of <lb/>
<pb n="330" entity="DSSR_000002932_0333"/>
laugh" that he had to step aside for a minute, upon one <lb/>
pretext or another, to keep me from suspecting. I staid <lb/>
faithfully by him until his comedy was finished. Then he <lb/>
remarked that he had undertaken to "learn" me all about a <lb/>
steamboat, and had done it; but that if he had overlooked <lb/>
anything, just ask <lb/>
him and he would <lb/>
supply the lack. <lb/>
"Anything about <lb/>
this boat that you <lb/>
don't know the <lb/>
name of or the <lb/>
purpose of, you <lb/>
come to me and I'll <lb/>
tell you." I said <lb/>
I would, and took <lb/>
my departure; <reg orig="dis-|appeared">disappeared</reg>, <lb/>
and <reg orig="ap-|proached">approached</reg> <lb/>
him from <lb/>
another quarter, <lb/>
whence he could <lb/>
not see me. There <lb/>
he sat, all alone, <lb/>
doubling himself <lb/>
up and writhing <lb/>
this way and that, <lb/>
in the throes of <reg orig="un-|appeasable">unappeasable</reg> <lb/>
<reg orig="laugh-|ter">laughter</reg>. <lb/>
He must have <lb/>
made himself sick; <lb/>
for he was not <lb/>
publicly visible <reg orig="af-|terward">afterward</reg> <lb/>
for several days. Meantime, the episode dropped <lb/>
out of my mind.</p>

<p>The thing that reminded me of it now, when I was alone <lb/>
at the wheel, was the spectacle of this young fellow standing <lb/>
<pb n="331" entity="DSSR_000002932_0334"/>
in the pilot-house door, with the knob in his hand, silently <lb/>
and severely inspecting me. I don't know when I have seen <lb/>
anybody look so injured as he did. He did not say anything <lb/>
&mdash;simply stood there and looked; reproachfully looked and <lb/>
pondered. Finally he shut the door, and started away; <lb/>
halted on the texas a minute; came slowly back and stood <lb/>
in the door again, with that grieved look in his face; gazed <lb/>
upon me a while in meek rebuke, then said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You let me learn you all about a steamboat, <hi rend="italic">did n't</hi> you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I confessed.</p>
<p>"Yes, you did&mdash;<hi rend="italic">did n't</hi> you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">You</hi> are the feller that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>
<p>Language failed. Pause&mdash;impotent struggle for further <lb/>
words&mdash;then he gave it up, choked out a deep, strong oath, <lb/>
and departed for good. Afterward I saw him several times <lb/>
below during the trip; but he was cold&mdash;would not look at <lb/>
me. Idiot, if he had not been in such a sweat to play his <lb/>
witless practical joke upon me, in the beginning, I would have <lb/>
persuaded his thoughts into some other direction, and saved <lb/>
him from committing that wanton and silly impoliteness.</p>
<p>I had myself called with the four o'clock watch, mornings, <lb/>
for one cannot see too many summer sunrises on the <reg orig="Missis-|sippi">Mississippi</reg>. <lb/>
They are enchanting. First, there is the eloquence <lb/>
of silence; for a deep hush broods everywhere. Next, there <lb/>
is the haunting sense of loneliness, isolation, remoteness <lb/>
from the worry and bustle of the world. The dawn creeps <lb/>
in stealthily; the solid walls of black forest soften to gray, <lb/>
and vast stretches of the river open up and reveal <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>; <lb/>
the water is glass-smooth, gives off spectral little <lb/>
wreaths of white mist, there is not the faintest breath of <lb/>
wind, nor stir of leaf; the tranquillity is profound and <reg orig="infi-|nitely">infinitely</reg> <lb/>
satisfying. Then a bird pipes up, another follows, <lb/>
and soon the pipings develop into a jubilant riot of music. <lb/>
You see none of the birds; you simply move through an <lb/>
atmosphere of song which seems to sing itself. When the <lb/>
<pb n="332" entity="DSSR_000002932_0335"/>
light has become a little stronger, you have one of the fairest <lb/>
and softest pictures imaginable. You have the intense green <lb/>
of the massed and crowded foliage near by; you see it paling <lb/>
shade by shade in front of you; upon the next projecting <lb/>
cape, a mile off or more, the tint has lightened to the tender <lb/>
young green of spring; the cape beyond that one has almost <lb/>
lost color, and the furthest one, miles away under the <reg orig="hori-|zon">horizon</reg>, <lb/>
sleeps upon the <lb/>
water a mere dim <lb/>
vapor, and hardly <reg orig="sep-|arable">separable</reg> <lb/>
from the sky <lb/>
above it and about it. <lb/>
And all this stretch of <lb/>
river is a mirror, and <lb/>
you have the shadowy <lb/>
reflections of the <reg orig="leaf-|age">leafage</reg> <lb/>
and the curving <lb/>
shores and the <reg orig="reced-|ing">receding</reg> <lb/>
capes pictured in <lb/>
it. Well, that is all <lb/>
beautiful; soft and <lb/>
rich and beautiful; and <lb/>
when the sun gets well <lb/>
up, and distributes a <lb/>
pink flush here and a <lb/>
powder of gold yonder <lb/>
and a purple haze where it will yield the best effect, you grant <lb/>
that you have seen something that is worth remembering.</p>

<p>We had the Kentucky Bend country in the early morning <lb/>
&mdash;scene of a strange and tragic accident in the old times. <lb/>
Captain Poe had a small stern-wheel boat, for years the home <lb/>
of himself and his wife. One night the boat struck a snag <lb/>
in the head of Kentucky Bend, and sank with astonishing <lb/>
suddenness; water already well above the cabin floor when <lb/>
the captain got aft. So he cut into his wife's stateroom from <lb/>
above with an axe; she was asleep in the upper berth, the

roof a flimsier one than was supposed; the first blow crashed <lb/>
down through the rotten boards and clove her skull.</p>
<p>This bend is all filled up now&mdash;result of a cut-off; and <lb/>
the same agent has taken the great and once much-frequented <lb/>
Walnut Bend, and set it away back in a solitude far from <lb/>
the accustomed track of passing steamers.</p>
<p>Helena we visited, and also a town I had not heard of <lb/>
before, it being of recent birth&mdash;Arkansas City. It was <lb/>
born of a railway; the Little Rock, Mississippi River and <lb/>
Texas Railroad touches the river there. We asked a <reg orig="pas-|senger">passenger</reg> <lb/>
who belonged there what sort of a place it was. <lb/>
"Well," said he, after considering, and with the air of one <lb/>
who wishes to take time and be accurate, "It's a hell of a <lb/>
place." A description which was photographic for exactness. <lb/>
There were several rows and clusters of shabby frame-houses, <lb/>
and a supply of mud sufficient to insure the town against a <lb/>
famine in that article for a hundred years; for the overflow <lb/>
had but lately subsided. There were stagnant ponds in the <lb/>
streets, here and there, and a dozen rude scows were <reg orig="scat-|tered">scattered</reg> <lb/>
about, lying aground wherever they happened to have <lb/>
been when the waters drained off and people could do <lb/>
their visiting and shopping on foot once more. Still, it is a <lb/>
thriving place, with a rich country behind it, an elevator <lb/>
in front of it, and also a fine big mill for the manufacture of <lb/>
cotton-seed oil. I had never seen this kind of a mill before.</p>
<p>Cotton-seed was comparatively valueless in my time; but <lb/>
it is worth $12 or $13 a ton now, and none of it is thrown <lb/>
away. The oil made from it is colorless, tasteless, and <lb/>
almost if not entirely odorless. It is claimed that it can, <lb/>
by proper manipulation, be made to resemble and perform <lb/>
the office of any and all oils, and be produced at a cheaper <lb/>
rate than the cheapest of the originals. Sagacious people <lb/>
shipped it to Italy, doctored it, labelled it, and brought it <lb/>
back as olive oil. This trade grew to be so formidable that <lb/>
Italy was obliged to put a prohibitory impost upon it to keep <lb/>
it from working serious injury to her oil industry.</p>
<pb n="336" entity="DSSR_000002932_0339"/>
<p>Helena occupies one of the prettiest situations on the <lb/>
Mississippi. Her perch is the last, the southernmost group <lb/>
of hills which one sees on that side of the river. In its <lb/>
normal condition it is a pretty town; but the flood (or <lb/>
possibly the seepage) had lately been ravaging it; whole <lb/>
streets of houses had been invaded by the muddy water, and <lb/>
the outsides of the buildings were still belted with a broad <lb/>
stain extending upwards from the foundations. Stranded <lb/>
and discarded scows lay all about; plank sidewalks on stilts <lb/>
four feet high were still standing; the board sidewalks on <lb/>
the ground level were loose and ruinous,&mdash;a couple of men <lb/>
trotting along them could make a blind man think a cavalry <lb/>
charge was coming; everywhere the mud was black and <lb/>
deep, and in many places malarious pools of stagnant water <lb/>
were standing. A Mississippi inundation is the next most <lb/>
wasting and desolating infliction to a fire.</p>
<p>We had an enjoyable time here, on this sunny Sunday: <lb/>
two full hours' liberty ashore while the boat discharged <lb/>
freight. In the back streets but few white people were <lb/>
visible, but there were plenty of colored folk&mdash;mainly women <lb/>
and girls; and almost without exception upholstered in bright <lb/>
new clothes of swell and elaborate style and cut&mdash;a glaring <lb/>
and hilarious contrast to the mournful mud and the pensive <lb/>
puddles.</p>
<p>Helena is the second town in Arkansas, in point of <reg orig="popu-|lation&mdash;which">population&mdash;which</reg> <lb/>
is placed at five thousand. The country about <lb/>
it is exceptionally productive. Helena has a good cotton <lb/>
trade; handles from forty to sixty thousand bales annually; <lb/>
she has a large lumber and grain commerce; has a foundry, <lb/>
oil mills, machine shops and wagon factories&mdash;in brief has <lb/>
$1,000,000 invested in manufacturing industries. She has <lb/>
two railways, and is the commercial centre of a broad and <lb/>
prosperous region. Her gross receipts of money, annually, <lb/>
from all sources, are placed by the New Orleans "<reg orig="Times-|Democrat">Times-Democrat</reg>" <lb/>
at $4,000,000.</p>

<head>A THUMB-PRINT AND WHAT CAME OF IT.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> were approaching Napoleon, Arkansas. So I began <lb/>
to think about my errand there. Time, noonday; <lb/>
and bright and sunny. This was bad&mdash;not best, anyway; <lb/>
for mine was not (preferably) a noonday kind of errand. <lb/>
The more I thought, the more that fact pushed itself upon <lb/>
me&mdash;now in one form, now in another. Finally, it took the <lb/>
form of a distinct question: is it good common sense to do <lb/>
the errand in daytime, when, by a little sacrifice of comfort <lb/>
and inclination, you can have night for it, and no inquisitive <lb/>
eyes around? This settled it. Plain question and plain <lb/>
answer make the shortest road out of most perplexities.</p>

<p>I got my friends into my stateroom, and said I was sorry <lb/>
to create annoyance and disappointment, but that upon <lb/>
reflection it really seemed best that we put our luggage ashore <lb/>
<pb n="338" entity="DSSR_000002932_0341"/>
and stop over at Napoleon. Their disapproval was prompt <lb/>
and loud; their language mutinous. Their main argument <lb/>
was one which has always been the first to come to the <lb/>
surface, in such cases, since the beginning of time: "But <lb/>
you decided and <hi rend="italic">agreed</hi> to stick to this boat, etc.;" as if, <lb/>
having determined to do an unwise thing, one is thereby <lb/>
bound to go ahead and make <hi rend="italic">two</hi> unwise things of it, by <lb/>
carrying out that determination.</p>
<p>I tried various mollifying tactics upon them, with <reg orig="reason-|ably">reasonably</reg> <lb/>
good success: under which encouragement, I increased <lb/>
my efforts; and, to show them that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had not created this <lb/>
annoying errand, and was in no way to blame for it, I <lb/>
presently drifted into its history&mdash;substantially as follows:</p>
<p>Toward the end of last year, I spent a few months in <lb/>
Munich, Bavaria. In November I was living in Fr&auml;ulein <lb/>
Dahlweiner's <hi rend="italic">pension,</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">a,</hi> Karlstrasse; but my working <lb/>
quarters were a mile from there, in the house of a widow <lb/>
who supported herself by taking lodgers. She and her two <lb/>
young children used to drop in every morning and talk <lb/>
German to me&mdash;by request. One day, during a ramble <lb/>
about the city, I visited one of the two establishments where <lb/>
the Government keeps and watches corpses until the doctors <lb/>
decide that they are permanently dead, and not in a trance <lb/>
state. It was a grisly place, that spacious room. There <lb/>
were thirty-six corpses of adults in sight, stretched on their <lb/>
backs on slightly slanted boards, in three long rows&mdash;all <lb/>
of them with wax-white, rigid faces, and all of them wrapped <lb/>
in white shrouds. Along the sides of the room were deep <lb/>
alcoves, like bay windows; and in each of these lay several <lb/>
marble-visaged babes, utterly hidden and buried under banks <lb/>
of fresh flowers, all but their faces and crossed hands. <lb/>
Around a finger of each of these fifty still forms, both <lb/>
great and small, was a ring; and from the ring a wire <lb/>
led to the ceiling, and thence to a bell in a watch-room <lb/>
yonder, where, day and night, a watchman sits always alert <lb/>
and ready to spring to the aid of any of that pallid company <lb/>
<pb n="339" entity="DSSR_000002932_0342"/>
who, waking out of death, shall make a movement&mdash;for any <lb/>
even the slightest movement will twitch the wire and ring <lb/>
that fearful bell. I imagined myself a death-sentinel <lb/>
drowsing there alone, far in the dragging watches of some <lb/>
wailing, gusty night, and having in a twinkling all my body <lb/>
stricken to quivering jelly by the sudden clamor of that <lb/>
awful summons! So I inquired about this thing; asked <lb/>
what resulted usually? if the watchman died, and the <lb/>
restored corpse came and did what it could to make his last <lb/>
moments easy? But I was rebuked for trying to feed an <lb/>
idle and frivolous curiosity in so solemn and so mournful a <lb/>
place; and went my way with a humbled crest.</p>
<p>Next morning I was telling the widow my adventure, when <lb/>
she exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>"Come with me! I have a lodger who shall tell you all <lb/>
you want to know. He has been a night watchman there."</p>
<p>He was a living man, but he did not look it. He was abed, <lb/>
and had his head propped high on pillows; his face was <lb/>
wasted and colorless, his deep-sunken eyes were shut; his <lb/>
hand, lying on his breast, was talon-like, it was so bony and <lb/>
long-fingered. The widow began her introduction of me. <lb/>
The man's eyes opened slowly, and glittered wickedly out <lb/>
from the twilight of their caverns; he frowned a black frown; <lb/>
he lifted his lean hand and waved us peremptorily away. <lb/>
But the widow kept straight on, till she had got out the fact <lb/>
that I was a stranger and an American. The man's face <lb/>
changed at once; brightened, became even eager&mdash;and the <lb/>
next moment he and I were alone together.</p>
<p>I opened up in cast-iron German; he responded in quite <lb/>
flexible English; thereafter we gave the German language <lb/>
a permanent rest.</p>
<p>This consumptive and I became good friends. I visited <lb/>
him every day, and we talked about everything. At least, <lb/>
about everything but wives and children. Let anybody's <lb/>
wife or anybody's child be mentioned, and three things <lb/>
always followed: the most gracious and loving and tender <lb/>
<pb n="340" entity="DSSR_000002932_0343"/>
light glimmered in the man's eyes for a moment; faded out <lb/>
the next, and in its place came that deadly look which had <lb/>
flamed there the first time I ever saw his lids unclose; <lb/>
thirdly, he ceased from speech, there and then for that day; <lb/>
lay silent, abstracted, and absorbed; apparently heard <lb/>
nothing that I said; took no notice of my good-byes, and <lb/>
plainly did not know, by either sight or hearing, when I left <lb/>
the room.</p>

<p>When I had been this Karl Ritter's daily and sole <reg orig="inti-|mate">intimate</reg> <lb/>
during two months, he one day said, abruptly,&mdash;</p>
<p>"I will tell you my story."</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section" id="d77">
<head>A DYING MAN'S CONFESSION.</head>
<p>Then he went on as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>I have never given up, until now. But now I have given <lb/>
up. I am going to die. I made up my mind last night <lb/>
<pb n="341" entity="DSSR_000002932_0344"/>
that it must be, and very soon, too. You say you are going <lb/>
to revisit your river, by and by, when you find opportunity. <lb/>
Very well; that, together with a certain strange experience <lb/>
which fell to my lot last night, determines me to tell you <lb/>
my history&mdash;for you will see Napoleon, Arkansas; and for <lb/>
my sake you will stop there, and do a certain thing for me <lb/>
&mdash;a thing which you will willingly undertake after you shall <lb/>
have heard my narrative.</p>
<p>Let us shorten the story wherever we can, for it will need it, <lb/>
being long. You already know how I came to go to America, <lb/>
and how I came to settle in that lonely region in the South. <lb/>
But you do not know that I had a wife. My wife was young, <lb/>
beautiful, loving, and oh, so divinely good and blameless and <lb/>
gentle! And our little girl was her mother in miniature. <lb/>
It was the happiest of happy households.</p>
<p>One night&mdash;it was toward the close of the war&mdash;I woke <lb/>
up out of a sodden lethargy, and found myself bound and <lb/>
gagged, and the air tainted with chloroform! I saw two <lb/>
men in the room, and one was saying to the other, in a hoarse <lb/>
whisper, "I <hi rend="italic">told</hi> her I would, if she made a noise, and as for <lb/>
the child&mdash;"</p>
<p>The other man interrupted in a low, half-crying voice&mdash;</p>
<p>"You said we'd only gag them and rob them, not hurt <lb/>
them; or I would n't have come."</p>
<p>"Shut up your whining; <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to change the plan when <lb/>
they waked up; you done all <hi rend="italic">you</hi> could to protect them, now <lb/>
let that satisfy you; come, help rummage."</p>
<p>Both men were masked, and wore coarse, ragged "nigger" <lb/>
clothes; they had a bull's-eye lantern, and by its light I <lb/>
noticed that the gentler robber had no thumb on his right <lb/>
hand. They rummaged around my poor cabin for a moment; <lb/>
the head bandit then said, in his stage whisper,&mdash;</p>
<p>"It's a waste of time&mdash;<hi rend="italic">he</hi> shall tell where it's hid. <lb/>
Undo his gag, and revive him up."</p>
<p>The other said&mdash;</p>
<p>"All right&mdash;provided no clubbing."</p>
<pb n="342" entity="DSSR_000002932_0345"/>
<p>"No clubbing it is, then&mdash;provided he keeps still."</p>
<p>They approached me; just then there was a sound <reg orig="out-|side">outside</reg>; <lb/>
a sound of voices and trampling hoofs; the robbers <lb/>
held their breath and listened; the sounds came slowly <lb/>
nearer and nearer; then came a shout&mdash;</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Hello,</hi> the house! Show a light, we want water."</p>
<figure id="f185" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0345">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">they rummaged the cabin.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"The captain's <lb/>
voice, by G&mdash;!" <lb/>
said the stage-<reg orig="whis-|pering">whispering</reg> <lb/>
ruffian, and <lb/>
both robbers fled <lb/>
by the way of the <lb/>
back door, shutting <lb/>
off their bull's-eye <lb/>
as they ran.</p>
<p>The strangers shouted several times more, then rode by&mdash; <lb/>
there seemed to be a dozen of the horses&mdash;and I heard <lb/>
nothing more.</p>
<p>I struggled, but could not free myself from my bonds. I <lb/>
tried to speak, but the gag was effective; I could not make <lb/>
a sound. I listened for my wife's voice and my child's&mdash; <lb/>
listened long and intently, but no sound came from the other <lb/>
end of the room where their bed was. This silence became <lb/>
more and more awful, more and more ominous, every moment. <lb/>
<pb n="343" entity="DSSR_000002932_0346"/>
Could you have endured an hour of it, do you think? Pity <lb/>
me, then, who had to endure three. Three hours?&mdash;it was <lb/>
three ages! Whenever the clock struck, it seemed as if <lb/>
years had gone by since I had heard it last. All this time I <lb/>
was struggling in my bonds; and at last, about dawn, I got <lb/>
myself free, and rose up and stretched my stiff limbs. I <lb/>
was able to distinguish details pretty well. The floor was <lb/>
littered with things thrown there by the robbers during their <lb/>
search for my savings. The first object that caught my <reg orig="par-|ticular">particular</reg> <lb/>
attention was a document of mine which I had seen <lb/>
the rougher of the two ruffians glance at and then cast away. <lb/>
It had blood on it! I staggered to the other end of the <lb/>
room. Oh, poor unoffending, helpless ones, there they lay, <lb/>
their troubles ended, mine begun!</p>
<p>Did I appeal to the law&mdash;I? Does it quench the pauper's <lb/>
thirst if the King drink for him? Oh, no, no, no&mdash;I wanted <lb/>
no impertinent interference of the law. Laws and the <reg orig="gal-|lows">gallows</reg> <lb/>
could not pay the debt that was owing to me! Let the <lb/>
laws leave the matter in my hands, and have no fears: I <lb/>
would find the debtor and collect the debt. How accomplish <lb/>
this, do you say? How accomplish it, and feel so sure about <lb/>
it, when I had neither seen the robbers' faces, nor heard <lb/>
their natural voices, nor had any idea who they might be? <lb/>
Nevertheless, I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> sure&mdash;quite sure, quite confident. I <lb/>
had a clue&mdash;a clue which you would not have valued&mdash;a <lb/>
clue which would not have greatly helped even a detective, <lb/>
since he would lack the secret of how to apply it. I shall <lb/>
come to that, presently&mdash;you shall see. Let us go on, now, <lb/>
taking things in their due order. There was one <reg orig="circum-|stance">circumstance</reg> <lb/>
which gave me a slant in a definite direction to begin <lb/>
with: Those two robbers were manifestly soldiers in tramp <lb/>
disguise; and not new to military service, but old in it&mdash; <lb/>
regulars, perhaps; they did not acquire their soldierly <reg orig="atti-|tude">attitude</reg>, <lb/>
gestures, carriage, in a day, nor a month, nor yet in a <lb/>
year. So I thought, but said nothing. And one of them <lb/>
had said, "the captain's voice, by G&mdash;!"&mdash;the one whose <lb/>
<pb n="344" entity="DSSR_000002932_0347"/>
life I would have. Two miles away, several regiments were <lb/>
in camp, and two companies of U. S. cavalry. When I <lb/>
learned that Captain Blakely, of Company C had passed our <lb/>
way, that night, with an escort, I said nothing, but in that <lb/>
company I resolved to seek my man. In conversation I <reg orig="stu-|diously">studiously</reg> <lb/>
and persistently described the robbers as tramps, <lb/>
camp followers; and among this class the people made <reg orig="use-|less">useless</reg> <lb/>
search, none suspecting the soldiers but me.</p>
<p>Working patiently, by night, in my desolated home, I <lb/>
made a disguise for myself out of various odds and ends <lb/>
of clothing; in the nearest village I bought a pair of blue <lb/>
goggles. By and by, when the military camp broke up, and <lb/>
Company C was ordered a hundred miles north, to Napoleon, <lb/>
I secreted my small hoard of money in my belt, and took <lb/>
my departure in the night. When Company C arrived in <lb/>
Napoleon, I was already there. Yes, I was there, with a new <lb/>
trade&mdash;fortune-teller. Not to seem partial, I made friends <lb/>
and told fortunes among all the companies garrisoned there; <lb/>
but I gave Company C the great bulk of my attentions. I <lb/>
made myself limitlessly obliging to these particular men; <lb/>
they could ask me no favor, put upon me no risk, which I <lb/>
would decline. I became the willing butt of their jokes; this <lb/>
perfected my popularity; I became a favorite.</p>
<p>I early found a private who lacked a thumb&mdash;what joy it <lb/>
was to me! And when I found that he alone, of all the <lb/>
company, had lost a thumb, my last misgiving vanished; I <lb/>
was <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> I was on the right track. This man's name was <lb/>
Kruger, a German. There were nine Germans in the <reg orig="com-|pany">company</reg>. <lb/>
I watched, to see who might be his intimates; but he <lb/>
seemed to have no especial intimates. But <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was his <reg orig="inti-|mate">intimate</reg>; <lb/>
and I took care to make the intimacy grow. <reg orig="Some-|times">Sometimes</reg> <lb/>
I so hungered for my revenge that I could hardly <lb/>
restrain myself from going on my knees and begging him <lb/>
to point out the man who had murdered my wife and child; <lb/>
but I managed to bridle my tongue. I bided my time, and <lb/>
went on telling fortunes, as opportunity offered.</p>
<pb n="345" entity="DSSR_000002932_0348"/>
<p>My apparatus was simple: a little red paint and a bit <lb/>
of white paper. I painted the ball of the client's thumb, <lb/>
took a print of it on the <lb/>
paper, studied it that <lb/>
night, and revealed his <lb/>
fortune to him next day. <lb/>
What was my idea in this <lb/>
nonsense? It was this: <lb/>
When I was a youth, I knew an <lb/>
old Frenchman who had been a <lb/>
prison-keeper for thirty years, and <lb/>
he told me that there was one <lb/>
thing about a person which never <lb/>
changed, from the cradle to the grave&mdash;the lines in the <lb/>
ball of the thumb; and he said that these lines were never <lb/>
exactly alike in the thumbs of any two human beings. In <lb/>
these days, we photograph the new criminal, and hang his</p>
<figure id="f186" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0348">

</figure>
<pb n="346" entity="DSSR_000002932_0349"/>
<p>picture in the Rogues' Gallery for future reference; but <lb/>
that Frenchman, in his day, used to take a print of the <lb/>
ball of a new prisoner's thumb and put that away for future <lb/>
reference. He always said that pictures were no good&mdash; <lb/>
future disguises could make them useless; "The thumb's <lb/>
the only sure thing," said he; "you can't disguise that." <lb/>
And he used to prove his theory, too, on my friends and <lb/>
acquaintances; it always succeeded.</p>
<figure id="f187" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0349">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">thumb-prints.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>I went on telling fortunes. <lb/>
Every night I shut myself in, <lb/>
all alone, and studied the day's <lb/>
thumb-prints with a <reg orig="magnifying-|glass">magnifying-glass</reg>. <lb/>
Imagine the devouring <lb/>
eagerness with which I pored <lb/>
over those mazy red spirals, with <lb/>
that document by my side which <lb/>
bore the right-hand thumb-and <lb/>
finger-marks of that unknown <lb/>
murderer, printed with the <reg orig="dear-|est">dearest</reg> <lb/>
blood&mdash;to me&mdash;that was ever shed on this earth! And <lb/>
many and many a time I had to repeat the same old <reg orig="disap-|pointed">disappointed</reg> <lb/>
remark, "will they <hi rend="italic">never</hi> correspond!"</p>
<p>But my reward came at last. It was the print of the <lb/>
thumb of the forty-third man of Company C whom I had <lb/>
experimented on&mdash;private Franz Adler. An hour before, I <lb/>
did not know the murderer's name, or voice, or figure, or <lb/>
face, or nationality; but now I knew all these things! I <lb/>
believed I might feel sure; the Frenchman's repeated <reg orig="dem-|onstrations">demonstrations</reg> <lb/>
being so good a warranty. Still, there was a way <lb/>
to <hi rend="italic">make</hi> sure. I had an impression of Kruger's left thumb. <lb/>
In the morning I took him aside when he was off duty; and <lb/>
when we were out of sight and hearing of witnesses, I said, <lb/>
impressively:&mdash;</p>
<p>"A part of your fortune is so grave, that I thought it <lb/>
would be better for you if I did not tell it in public. You <lb/>
and another man, whose fortune I was studying last night, <lb/>
<pb n="347" entity="DSSR_000002932_0350"/>
&mdash;private Adler,&mdash;have been murdering a woman and a <lb/>
child! You are being dogged: within five days both of you <lb/>
will be assassinated."</p>
<p>He dropped on his knees, frightened out of his wits; and <lb/>
for five minutes he kept pouring out the same set of words, <lb/>
like a demented person, and in the same half-crying way <lb/>
which was one of my memories of that murderous night in <lb/>
my cabin:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I did n't do it; upon my soul <lb/>
I did n't do it; and I tried to keep <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">him</hi> from doing it; I did, as <lb/>
God is my <reg orig="wit-|ness">witness</reg>. <lb/>
He did <lb/>
it alone."</p>
<figure id="f188" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0350">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">he dropped on his knees.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>This was <lb/>
all I wanted. <lb/>
And I tried <lb/>
to get rid of <lb/>
the fool; but <lb/>
no, he clung <lb/>
to me, <reg orig="implor-|ing">imploring</reg> <lb/>
me to save <lb/>
him from the <lb/>
assassin. He <lb/>
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have <lb/>
money&mdash;ten thousand <reg orig="dol-|lars&mdash;hid">dollars&mdash;hid</reg> <lb/>
away, the fruit <lb/>
of loot and thievery; save <lb/>
me&mdash;tell me what to do, <lb/>
and you shall have it, every <lb/>
penny. Two thirds of it is <lb/>
my cousin Adler's; but you can take it all. We hid it when <lb/>
we first came here. But I hid it in a new place yesterday, <lb/>
and have not told him&mdash;shall not tell him. I was going to <lb/>
desert, and get away with it all. It is gold, and too heavy <lb/>
<pb n="348" entity="DSSR_000002932_0351"/>
to carry when one is running and dodging; but a woman <lb/>
who has been gone over the river two days to prepare my <lb/>
way for me is going to follow me with it; and if I got no <lb/>
chance to describe the hiding-place to her I was going to slip <lb/>
my silver watch into her hand, or send it to her, and she <lb/>
would understand. There's a piece of paper in the back of <lb/>
the case, which tells it all. Here, take the watch&mdash;tell me <lb/>
what to do!"</p>
<p>He was trying to press his watch upon me, and was <reg orig="ex-|posing">exposing</reg> <lb/>
the paper and explaining it to me, when Adler <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
on the scene, about a dozen yards away. I said to <lb/>
poor Kruger:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Put up your watch, I don't want it. You shan't come to <lb/>
any harm. Go, now; I must tell Adler his fortune. <reg orig="Pres-|ently">Presently</reg> <lb/>
I will tell you how to escape the assassin; meantime <lb/>
shall have to examine your thumb-mark again. Say nothing <lb/>
to Adler about this thing&mdash;say nothing to anybody."</p>
<p>He went away filled with fright and gratitude, poor devil. <lb/>
I told Adler a long fortune,&mdash;purposely so long that I could <lb/>
not finish it; promised to come to him on guard, that night, <lb/>
and tell him the really important part of it&mdash;the tragical <lb/>
part of it, I said,&mdash;so must be out of reach of eavesdroppers. <lb/>
They always kept a picket-watch outside the town,&mdash;mere <reg orig="dis-|cipline">discipline</reg> <lb/>
and ceremony,&mdash;no occasion for it, no enemy around.</p>
<p>Toward midnight I set out, equipped with the <reg orig="counter-|sign">countersign</reg>, <lb/>
and picked my way toward the lonely region where <lb/>
Adler was to keep his watch. It was so dark that I stumbled <lb/>
right on a dim figure almost before I could get out a <reg orig="pro-|tecting">protecting</reg> <lb/>
word. The sentinel hailed and I answered, both at <lb/>
the same moment. I added, "It's only me&mdash;the <reg orig="fortune-|teller">fortuneteller</reg>." <lb/>
Then I slipped to the poor devil's side, and without <lb/>
a word I drove my dirk into his heart! <hi rend="italic">Ja wohl,</hi> laughed I, <lb/>
it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the tragedy part of his fortune, indeed! As he fell <lb/>
from his horse, he clutched at me, and my blue goggles <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
in his hand; and away plunged the beast dragging <lb/>
him, with his foot in the stirrup.</p>
<pb n="349" entity="DSSR_000002932_0352"/>
<p>I fled through the woods, and made good my escape, <lb/>
leaving the acusing goggles behind me in that dead man's <lb/>
hand.</p>

<p>This was fifteen or sixteen years ago. Since then I have <lb/>
wandered aimlessly about the earth, sometimes at work, <lb/>
sometimes idle; sometimes with money, sometimes with <lb/>
none; but always tired of life, and wishing it was done, for <lb/>
my mission here was finished, with the act of that night; <lb/>
and the only pleasure, solace, satisfaction I had, in all those <lb/>
tedious years, was in the daily reflection, "I have killed <lb/>
him!"</p>

</figure>
<p>Four years ago, my health began to fail. I had wandered <lb/>
into Munich, in my purposeless way. Being out of money, <lb/>
I sought work, and got it; did my duty faithfully about a <lb/>
year, and was then given the berth of night watchman yonder <lb/>
in that dead-house which you visited lately. The place suited <lb/>
my mood. I liked it. I liked being with the dead&mdash;liked <lb/>
being alone <lb/>
with them. <lb/>
I used to <reg orig="wan-|der">wander</reg> <lb/>
among <lb/>
those rigid <lb/>
corpses, and <lb/>
peer into their <lb/>
austere faces, <lb/>
by the hour. <lb/>
The later the <lb/>
time, the more <lb/>
impressive it <lb/>
was; I <reg orig="pre-|ferred">preferred</reg> <lb/>
the late <lb/>
time. <reg orig="Some-|times">Sometimes</reg> <lb/>
I turned <lb/>
the lights low: <lb/>
this gave <reg orig="per-|spective">perspective</reg>, <lb/>
you <lb/>
see; and the <lb/>
imagination <lb/>
could play; <reg orig="al-|ways">always</reg>, <lb/>
the dim receding ranks of the dead inspired one with <lb/>
weird and fascinating fancies. Two years ago&mdash;I had been <lb/>
there a year then&mdash;I was sitting all alone in the watch-room, <lb/>
one gusty winter's night, chilled, numb, comfortless; drowsing <lb/>
gradually into unconsciousness; the sobbing of the wind and <lb/>
the slamming of distant shutters falling fainter and fainter <lb/>
upon my dulling ear each moment, when sharp and suddenly <lb/>
that dead-bell rang out a blood-curdling alarum over my <lb/>
<pb n="351" entity="DSSR_000002932_0354"/>
head! The shock of it nearly paralyzed me; for it was the <lb/>
first time I had ever heard it.</p>
<p>I gathered myself together and flew to the corpse-room. <lb/>
About midway down the outside rank, a shrouded figure was <lb/>
sitting upright, wagging its head slowly from one side to the <lb/>
other&mdash;a grisly spectacle! Its side was toward me. I <lb/>
hurried to it and peered into its face. Heavens, it was <lb/>
Adler!</p>
<p>Can you divine what my first thought was? Put into <lb/>
words, it was this: "It seems, then, you escaped me once: <lb/>
there will be a different result this time!"</p>
<p>Evidently this creature was suffering unimaginable terrors. <lb/>
Think what it must have been to wake up in the midst of <lb/>
that voiceless hush, and look out over that grim congregation <lb/>
of the dead! What gratitude shone in his skinny white face <lb/>
when he saw a living form before him! And how the <reg orig="fer-|vency">fervency</reg> <lb/>
of this mute gratitude was augmented when his eyes <lb/>
fell upon the life-giving cordials which I carried in my hands! <lb/>
Then imagine the horror which came into this pinched face <lb/>
when I put the cordials behind me, and said mockingly,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Speak up, Franz Adler&mdash;call upon these dead. <reg orig="Doubt-|less">Doubtless</reg> <lb/>
they will listen and have pity; but here there is none <lb/>
else that will."</p>
<p>He tried to speak, but that part of the shroud which bound <lb/>
his jaws, held firm and would not let him. He tried to lift <lb/>
imploring hands, but they were crossed upon his breast and <lb/>
tied. I said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Shout, Franz Adler; make the sleepers in the distant <lb/>
streets hear you and bring help. Shout&mdash;and lose no time, <lb/>
for there is little to lose. What, you cannot? That is a <lb/>
pity; but it is no matter&mdash;it does not always bring help. <lb/>
When you and your cousin murdered a helpless woman and <lb/>
child in a cabin in Arkansas&mdash;my wife, it was, and my child! <lb/>
&mdash;they shrieked for help, you remember; but it did no good; <lb/>
you remember that it did no good, is it not so? Your teeth <lb/>
chatter&mdash;then why cannot you shout? Loosen the bandages <lb/>
<pb n="352" entity="DSSR_000002932_0355"/>
with your hands&mdash;then you can. Ah, I see&mdash;your hands <lb/>
are tied, they cannot aid you. How strangely things repeat <lb/>
themselves, after long years; for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hands were tied, that <lb/>
night, you remember? Yes, tied much as yours are now&mdash; <lb/>
how odd that is. I could not pull free. It did not occur <lb/>
to you to untie me; it does not occur to me to untie you. <lb/>
Sh&mdash;&mdash;! there's a late footstep. It is coming this way. <lb/>
Hark, how near it is! One can count the footfalls&mdash;one&mdash; <lb/>
two&mdash;three. There&mdash;it is just outside. Now is the time! <lb/>
Shout, man, shout!&mdash;it is the one sole chance between you <lb/>
and eternity! Ah, you see you have delayed too long&mdash;it <lb/>
is gone by. There&mdash;it is dying out. It is gone! Think of <lb/>
it&mdash;reflect upon it&mdash;you have heard a human footstep for <lb/>
the last time. How curious it must be, to listen to so <reg orig="com-|mon">common</reg> <lb/>
a sound as that, and know that one will never hear the <lb/>
fellow to it again."</p>
<p>Oh, my friend, the agony in that shrouded face was ecstasy <lb/>
to see! I thought of a new torture, and applied <reg orig="it&mdash;assist-|ing">it&mdash;assisting</reg> <lb/>
myself with a trifle of lying invention:&mdash;</p>
<p>"That poor Kruger tried to save my wife and child, and I <lb/>
did him a grateful good turn for it when the time came. I <lb/>
persuaded him to rob you; and I and a woman helped him <lb/>
to desert, and got him away in safety."</p>
<p>A look as of surprise and triumph shone out dimly through <lb/>
the anguish in my victim's face. I was disturbed, disquieted. <lb/>
I said&mdash;</p>
<p>"What, then,&mdash;did n't he escape?"</p>
<p>A negative shake of the head.</p>
<p>"No? What happened, then?"</p>
<p>The satisfaction in the shrouded face was still plainer. <lb/>
The man tried to mumble out some words&mdash;could not <reg orig="suc-|ceed">succeed</reg>; <lb/>
tried to express something with his obstructed hands <lb/>
&mdash;failed; paused a moment, then feebly tilted his head, in a <lb/>
meaning way, toward the corpse that lay nearest him.</p>
<p>"Dead?" I asked. "Failed to escape?&mdash;caught in the <lb/>
act and shot?"</p>
<pb n="353" entity="DSSR_000002932_0356"/>
<p>Negative shake of the head.</p>
<p>"How, then?"</p>
<p>Again the man tried to do something with his hands. I <lb/>
watched closely, but could not guess the intent. I bent over <lb/>
and watched still more intently. He had twisted a thumb <lb/>
around and was weakly punching at his breast with it.</p>
<figure id="f191" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0356">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">i sat down by him.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"Ah&mdash;stabbed, do you mean?"</p>
<p>Affirmative nod, accompanied by a spectral smile of such <lb/>
peculiar devilishness, that it struck an awakening light <lb/>
through my dull brain, and I cried&mdash;</p>
<p>"Did <hi rend="italic">I</hi> stab him, mistaking him for you?&mdash;for that stroke <lb/>
was meant for none but you."</p>
<p>The affirmative nod of the re-dying rascal was as joyous <lb/>
as his failing strength was able to put into its expression.</p>
<pb n="354" entity="DSSR_000002932_0357"/>
<p>"O, miserable, miserable me, to slaughter the pitying soul <lb/>
that stood a friend to my darlings when they were helpless, <lb/>
and would have saved them if he could! miserable, oh, <reg orig="mis-|erable">miserable</reg>, <lb/>
miserable me!"</p>
<p>I fancied I heard the muffled gurgle of a mocking laugh. <lb/>
I took my face out of my hands, and saw my enemy sinking <lb/>
back upon his inclined board.</p>
<p>He was a satisfactory long time dying. He had a <reg orig="won-|derful">wonderful</reg> <lb/>
vitality, an astonishing constitution. Yes, he was a <lb/>
pleasant long time at it. I got a chair and a newspaper, and <lb/>
sat down by him and read. Occasionally I took a sip of <lb/>
brandy. This was necessary, on account of the cold. But <lb/>
I did it partly because I saw, that along at first, whenever I <lb/>
reached for the bottle, he thought I was going to give him <lb/>
some. I read aloud: mainly imaginary accounts of people <lb/>
snatched from the grave's threshold and restored to life and <lb/>
vigor by a few spoonsful of liquor and a warm bath. Yes, <lb/>
he had a long, hard death of it&mdash;three hours and six <reg orig="min-|utes">minutes</reg>, <lb/>
from the time he rang his bell.</p>
<p>It is believed that in all these eighteen years that have <lb/>
elapsed since the institution of the corpse-watch, no shrouded <lb/>
occupant of the Bavarian dead-houses has ever rung its bell. <lb/>
Well, it is a harmless belief. Let it stand at that.</p>
<p>The chill of that death-room had penetrated my bones. It <lb/>
revived and fastened upon me the disease which had been <lb/>
afflicting me, but which, up to that night, had been steadily <lb/>
disappearing. That man murdered my wife and my child; <lb/>
and in three days hence he will have added me to his list. <lb/>
No matter&mdash;God! how delicious the memory of it!&mdash;I <lb/>
caught him escaping from his grave, and thrust him back <lb/>
into it!</p>
<p>After that night, I was confined to my bed for a week; <lb/>
but as soon as I could get about, I went to the dead-house <lb/>
books and got the number of the house which Adler had died <lb/>
in. A wretched lodging-house, it was. It was my idea that <lb/>
he would naturally have gotten hold of Kruger's effects, being <lb/>
<pb n="355" entity="DSSR_000002932_0358"/>
his cousin; and I wanted to get Kruger's watch, if I could. <lb/>
But while I was sick, Adler's things had been sold and <lb/>
scattered, all except a few old letters, and some odds and <lb/>
ends of no value. However, through those letters, I traced <lb/>
out a son of Kruger's, the only relative he left. He is a man <lb/>
of thirty, now, a shoemaker by trade, and living at No. 14 <lb/>
K&ouml;nigstrasse, Mannheim&mdash;widower, with several small <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg>. <lb/>
Without explaining to him why, I have furnished two <lb/>
thirds of his support, ever since.</p>
<p>Now, as to that watch&mdash;see how strangely things happen! <lb/>
I traced it around and about Germany for more than a year, <lb/>
at considerable cost in money and vexation; and at last I <lb/>
got it. Got it, and was unspeakably glad; opened it, and <lb/>
found nothing in it! Why, I might have known that that <lb/>
bit of paper was not going to stay there all this time. Of <lb/>
course I gave up that ten thousand dollars then; gave it up, <lb/>
and dropped it out of my mind: and most sorrowfully, for I <lb/>
had wanted it for Kruger's son.</p>
<p>Last night, when I consented at last that I must die, I <lb/>
began to make ready. I proceeded to burn all useless papers; <lb/>
and sure enough, from a batch of Adler's, not previously <reg orig="ex-|amined">examined</reg> <lb/>
with thoroughness, out dropped that long-desired <lb/>
scrap! I recognized it in a moment. Here it is&mdash;I will <lb/>
translate it: <lb/>
<q>"Brick livery stable, stone foundation, middle of town, corner of <lb/>
Orleans and Market. Corner toward Court-house. Third stone, <lb/>
fourth row. Stick notice there, saying how many are to come."</q>
</p>
<p>There&mdash;take it, and preserve it. Kruger explained that <lb/>
that stone was removable; and that it was in the north wall <lb/>
of the foundation, fourth row from the top, and third stone <lb/>
from the west. The money is secreted behind it. He said <lb/>
the closing sentence was a blind, to mislead in case the paper <lb/>
should fall into wrong hands. It probably performed that <lb/>
office for Adler.</p>
<p>Now I want to beg that when you make your intended <lb/>
<pb n="356" entity="DSSR_000002932_0359"/>
journey down the river, you will hunt out that hidden money, <lb/>
and send it to Adam Kruger, care of the Mannheim address <lb/>
which I have mentioned. It will make a rich man of him, <lb/>
and I shall sleep the sounder in my grave for knowing that <lb/>
I have done what I could for the son of the man who tried <lb/>
to save my wife and child&mdash;albeit my hand ignorantly struck <lb/>
him down, whereas the impulse of my heart would have been <lb/>
to shield and serve him.</p>

<head>THE DISPOSAL OF A BONANZA.</head>
<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">Such</hi> was Ritter's narrative," said I to my two friends. <lb/>
There was a profound and impressive silence, which <lb/>
lasted a considerable time; then both men broke into a <reg orig="fu-|sillade">fusillade</reg> <lb/>
of excited and admiring ejaculations over the strange <lb/>
incidents of the tale; and this, along with a rattling fire <lb/>
of questions, was kept up until all hands were about out of <lb/>
breath. Then my friends began to cool down, and draw off, <lb/>
under shelter of occasional volleys, into silence and abysmal <lb/>
reverie. For ten minutes now, there was stillness. Then <lb/>
Rogers said dreamily:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Ten thousand dollars."</p>
<p>Adding, after a considerable pause,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Ten thousand. It is a heap of money."</p>
<p>Presently the poet inquired,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Are you going to send it to him right away?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said. "It is a queer question."</p>
<p>No reply. After a little, Rogers asked, hesitatingly:</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">All</hi> of it? &mdash; That is &mdash; I mean &mdash;"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Certainly,</hi> all of it."</p>
<p>I was going to say more, but stopped,&mdash;was stopped by a <lb/>
train of thought which started up in me. Thompson spoke, <lb/>
but my mind was absent and I did not catch what he said. <lb/>
But I heard Rogers answer,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Yes, it seems so to me. It ought to be quite sufficient; <lb/>
for I don't see that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has done anything."</p>
<p>Presently the poet said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"When you come to look at it, it is <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than sufficient. <lb/>
<pb n="358" entity="DSSR_000002932_0361"/>
Just look at it&mdash;five thousand dollars! Why, he could n't <lb/>
spend it in a lifetime! And it would injure him, too; <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg> <lb/>
ruin him&mdash;you want to look at that. In a little while he <lb/>
would throw his last away, shut up his shop, maybe take to <lb/>
drinking, maltreat his motherless children, drift into other <lb/>
evil courses, go steadily from bad to worse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it," interrupted Rogers, fervently, "I've seen <lb/>
it a hundred times&mdash;yes, more than a hundred. You put <lb/>
money into the hands of a man like that, if you want to <reg orig="de-|stroy">destroy</reg> <lb/>

then I don't know human nature&mdash;ain't that so, <reg orig="Thomp-|son">Thompson</reg>? <lb/>
And even if we were to give him a <hi rend="italic">third</hi> of it; why, <lb/>
in less than six months&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Less than six <hi rend="italic">weeks,</hi> you'd better say!" said I, warming <lb/>
up and breaking in. "Unless he had that three thousand <lb/>
dollars in safe <lb/>
hands where he <lb/>
could n't touch it, <lb/>
he would no more <lb/>
last you six weeks <lb/>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">"ain't that so, <lb/>

</figure>
<p>"Of <hi rend="italic">course</hi> he <lb/>

Thompson; "I've <lb/>

<p>"What business <lb/>
has that <reg orig="shoema-|ker">shoemaker</reg> <lb/>
with two thousand dollars, I should <lb/>
like to know?" broke in Rogers, earnestly. "A <lb/>
man perhaps perfectly contented now, there in <reg orig="Mann-|heim">Mannheim</reg>, <lb/>
surrounded by his own class, eating his bread with the <lb/>
appetite which laborious industry alone can give, enjoying his <lb/>

I say blest! blest above all the myriads that go in silk attire <lb/>
and walk the empty artificial round of social folly&mdash;but <lb/>
just you put <hi rend="italic">that</hi> temptation before him once! just you <lb/>

lay fifteen hundred dollars before a man like that, and <lb/>
say&mdash;"</p>

his principles, paralyze his industry, drag him to the rumshop, <lb/>
thence to the gutter, thence to the almshouse, thence to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Why</hi> put upon ourselves this crime, gentlemen?" <reg orig="inter-|rupted">interrupted</reg> <lb/>
the poet earnestly and appealingly. "He is happy <lb/>
where he is, and <hi rend="italic">as</hi> he is. Every sentiment of honor, every <lb/>
sentiment of charity, <lb/>
every sentiment of high <lb/>
and sacred benevolence <lb/>
warns us, beseeches us, <lb/>
commands us to leave <lb/>
him undisturbed. That <lb/>
is real friendship, that <lb/>
is true friendship. We <lb/>
could follow other <lb/>
courses that would be <lb/>
more showy; but none <lb/>
that would be so truly <lb/>
kind and wise, depend <lb/>
upon it."</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">"he is happy where he is."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>After some further <lb/>
talk, it became evident <lb/>
that each of us, down <lb/>
in his heart, felt some misgivings over this settlement of <lb/>
the matter. It was manifest that we all felt that we ought <lb/>
to send the poor shoemaker <hi rend="italic">something.</hi> There was long and <lb/>
thoughtful discussion of this point; and we finally decided <lb/>
to send him a chromo.</p>
<p>Well, now that everything seemed to be arranged <reg orig="satis-|factorily">satisfactorily</reg> <lb/>
to everybody concerned, a new trouble broke out: <lb/>
it transpired that these two men were expecting to share <lb/>
equally in the money with me. That was not my idea. I <lb/>
said that if they got half of it between them they might <reg orig="con-|sider">consider</reg> <lb/>
themselves lucky. Rogers said:&mdash;</p>
<pb n="361" entity="DSSR_000002932_0364"/>
<p>"Who would have had <hi rend="italic">any</hi> if it had n't been for me? I <lb/>
flung out the first hint&mdash;but for that it would all have gone <lb/>
to the shoemaker."</p>
<p>Thompson said that he was thinking of the thing himself <lb/>
at the very moment that Rogers had originally spoken.</p>
<p>I retorted that the idea would have occurred to me plenty <lb/>
soon enough, and without anybody's help. I was slow about <lb/>
thinking, maybe, but I was sure.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">warmed up into a quarrel.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>This matter warmed up into a quarrel; then into a fight; <lb/>
and each man got pretty badly battered. As soon as I had <lb/>
got myself mended up after a fashion, I ascended to the <reg orig="hur-|ricane">hurricane</reg> <lb/>
deck in a pretty sour humor. I found Captain McCord <lb/>
there, and said, as pleasantly as my humor would permit:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have come to say good-bye, captain. I wish to go ashore <lb/>
at Napoleon."</p>
<pb n="362" entity="DSSR_000002932_0365"/>
<p>"Go ashore where?"</p>
<p>"Napoleon."</p>
<p>The captain laughed; but seeing that I was not in a jovial <lb/>
mood, stopped that and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"But are you serious?"</p>
<p>"Serious? I certainly am."</p>
<p>The captain glanced up at the pilot-house and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"He wants to get off at Napoleon!"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Napoleon?</hi>"</p>
<p>"That's what he says."</p>
<p>"Great C&aelig;sar's ghost!"</p>
<p>Uncle Mumford approached along the deck. The captain <lb/>
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Uncle, here's a friend of yours wants to get off at <reg orig="Napo-|leon">Napoleon</reg>!"</p> <lb/>
<p>"Well, by&mdash;!"</p>
<p>I said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Come, what is all this about? Can't a man go ashore at <lb/>
Napoleon if he wants to?"</p>
<p>"Why, hang it, don't you know? There <hi rend="italic">is n't</hi> any Napoleon <lb/>
any more. Has n't been for years and years. The Arkansas <lb/>
River burst through it, tore it all to rags, and emptied it into <lb/>
the Mississippi!"</p>
<p>"Carried the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> town away?&mdash;banks, churches, jails, <lb/>
newspaper-offices, court-house, theatre, fire department, livery <lb/>
stable,&mdash;<hi rend="italic">everything?</hi>"</p>
<p>"Everything. Just a fifteen-minute job, or such a matter. <lb/>
Did n't leave hide nor hair, shred nor shingle of it, except <lb/>
the fag-end of a shanty and one brick chimney. This boat is <lb/>
paddling along right now, where the dead-centre of that <lb/>
town used to be; yonder is the brick chimney,&mdash;all that's <lb/>
left of Napoleon. These dense woods on the right used <lb/>
to be a mile back of the town. Take a look behind you&mdash; <lb/>
up-stream&mdash;now you begin to recognize this country, don't <lb/>
you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do recognize it now. It is the most wonderful <lb/>
<pb n="363" entity="DSSR_000002932_0366"/>
thing I ever heard of; by a long shot the most wonderful&mdash; <lb/>
and unexpected."</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson and Mr. Rogers had arrived, meantime, with <lb/>
satchels and umbrellas, and had silently listened to the <reg orig="cap-|tain's">captain's</reg> <lb/>
news. Thompson put a half-dollar in my hand and <lb/>
said softly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"For my share of the chromo."</p>

<p>Yes, it was an astonishing thing to <lb/>
see the Mississippi rolling between <lb/>
unpeopled shores and straight over <lb/>
the spot where I used to see a good big self-complacent town <lb/>
twenty years ago. Town that was county-seat of a great and <lb/>

hospital; town of innumerable fights&mdash;an inquest every day; <lb/>
town where I had used to know the prettiest girl, and the <lb/>

where we were handed the first printed news of the "<reg orig="Penn-|sylvania's">Pennsylvania's</reg>" <lb/>

<head>REFRESHMENTS AND ETHICS.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> regard to Island 74, which is situated not far from the <lb/>
former Napoleon, a freak of the river here has sorely <lb/>
perplexed the laws of men and made them a vanity and a jest. <lb/>
When the State of Arkansas was chartered, she controlled <lb/>
"to the centre of the river"&mdash;a most unstable line. The <lb/>
State of Mississippi claimed "to the channel"&mdash;another <lb/>
shifty and unstable line. No. 74 belonged to Arkansas. <lb/>
By and by a cut-off threw this big island out of Arkansas, <lb/>
and yet not <hi rend="italic">within</hi> Mississippi. "Middle of the river" on <lb/>
one side of it, "channel" on the other. That is as I <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg> <lb/>
the problem. Whether I have got the details right or <lb/>
wrong, this <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> remains: that here is this big and <reg orig="exceed-|ingly">exceedingly</reg> <lb/>
valuable island of four thousand acres, thrust out in <lb/>
the cold, and belonging to neither the one State nor the <lb/>
other; paying taxes to neither, owing allegiance to neither. <lb/>
One man owns the whole island, and of right is "the man <lb/>
without a country."</p>
<p>Island 92 belongs to Arkansas. The river moved it over <lb/>
and joined it to Mississippi. A chap established a whiskey <lb/>
shop there, without a Mississippi license, and enriched <lb/>
himself upon Mississippi custom under Arkansas protection <lb/>
(where no license was in those days required).</p>
<p>We glided steadily down the river in the usual privacy&mdash; <lb/>
steamboat or other moving thing seldom seen. Scenery as <lb/>
always: stretch upon stretch of almost unbroken forest, on <lb/>
both sides of the river; soundless solitude. Here and there <lb/>
<pb n="365" entity="DSSR_000002932_0368"/>
a cabin or two, standing in small openings on the gray and <lb/>
grassless banks&mdash;cabins which had formerly stood a quarter <lb/>
or half-mile farther to the front, and gradually been pulled <lb/>
farther and farther back as the shores caved in. As at <reg orig="Pil-|cher's">Pilcher's</reg> <lb/>
Point, for instance, where the cabins had been moved <lb/>
back three hundred yards in three months, so we were told; <lb/>
but the caving banks had already caught up with them, and <lb/>
they were being conveyed rearward once more.</p>
<p>Napoleon had but small opinion of Greenville, Mississippi, <lb/>
in the old times; but behold, Napoleon is gone to the <reg orig="cat-|fishes">catfishes</reg>, <lb/>
and here is Greenville full of life and activity, and <lb/>
making a considerable flourish in the Valley; having three <lb/>
thousand inhabitants, it is said, and doing a gross trade of <lb/>
$2,500,000 annually. A growing town.</p>

<p>There was much talk on the boat about the Calhoun Land <lb/>
Company, an enterprise which is expected to work <reg orig="whole-|some">wholesome</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="366" entity="DSSR_000002932_0369"/>
results. Colonel Calhoun, a grandson of the <reg orig="states-|man">statesman</reg>, <lb/>
went to Boston and formed a syndicate which <reg orig="pur-|chased">purchased</reg> <lb/>
a large tract of land on the river, in Chicot County, <lb/>
Arkansas,&mdash;some ten thousand acres&mdash;for cotton-growing. <lb/>
The purpose is to work on a cash basis: buy at first hands, <lb/>
and handle their own product; supply their negro laborers <lb/>
with provisions and necessaries at a trifling profit, say 8 or <lb/>
10 per cent; furnish them comfortable quarters, etc., and <lb/>
encourage them to save money and remain on the place. <lb/>
If this proves a financial success, as seems quite certain, <lb/>
they propose to establish a banking-house in Greenville, and <lb/>
lend money at an unburdensome rate of interest&mdash;6 per <lb/>
cent is spoken of.</p>
<p>The trouble heretofore has been&mdash;I am quoting remarks <lb/>
of planters and steamboatmen&mdash;that the planters, although <lb/>
owning the land, were without cash capital; had to <reg orig="hypothe-|cate">hypothecate</reg> <lb/>
both land and crop to carry on the business. <reg orig="Conse-|quently">Consequently</reg>, <lb/>
the commission dealer who furnishes the money <lb/>
takes some risk and demands big interest&mdash;usually 10 per <lb/>
cent, and 2&frac12; per cent for negotiating the loan. The planter <lb/>
has also to buy his supplies through the same dealer, paying <lb/>
commissions and profits. Then when he ships his crop, the <lb/>
dealer adds his commissions, insurance, etc. So, taking it <lb/>
by and large, and first and last, the dealer's share of that <lb/>
crop is about 25 per cent.<ref target="n16" n="16"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>

the privilege of purchasing all their supplies at 100 per cent profit?"&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Edward <lb/>

</p>
<p>A cotton-planter's estimate of the average margin of profit <lb/>
on planting, in his section: One man and mule will raise ten <lb/>
acres of cotton, giving ten bales cotton, worth, say, $500; <lb/>
cost of producing, say $350; net profit, $150, or $15 per <lb/>
acre. There is also a profit now from the cotton-seed, which <lb/>
formerly had little value&mdash;none where much transportation <lb/>
<pb n="367" entity="DSSR_000002932_0370"/>
was necessary. In sixteen hundred pounds crude cotton, <lb/>
four hundred are lint, worth, say, ten cents a pound; and <lb/>
twelve hundred pounds of seed, worth $12 or $13 per ton. <lb/>
Maybe in future even the <hi rend="italic">stems</hi> will not be thrown away. <lb/>
Mr. Edward Atkinson says that for each bale of cotton there <lb/>
are fifteen <lb/>
hundred <lb/>
pounds of <lb/>
stems, and <lb/>
that these <lb/>
are very <lb/>
rich in <reg orig="phos-|phate">phosphate</reg> <lb/>
of lime <lb/>
and potash; <lb/>
that when <lb/>
ground and <lb/>
mixed with <lb/>
ensilage or <lb/>
cotton - seed <lb/>
meal (which <lb/>
is too rich <lb/>
for use as <lb/>
fodder in <lb/>
large <reg orig="quan-|tities)">quantities)</reg>, <lb/>
the stem mixture makes a superior food, rich in all <lb/>
the elements needed for the production of milk, meat, <lb/>
and bone. Heretofore the stems have been considered a <lb/>
nuisance.</p>

<p>Complaint is made that the planter remains grouty toward <lb/>

<p>A Mr. H. furnished some minor details of fact concerning <lb/>
this region which I would have hesitated to believe if I had <lb/>
not known him to be a steamboat mate. He was a passenger <lb/>
of ours, a resident of Arkansas <lb/>
City, and bound to Vicksburg <lb/>
to join his boat, a little <reg orig="Sun-|flower">Sunflower</reg> <lb/>
packet. He was an <reg orig="aus-|tere">austere</reg> <lb/>
man, and had the <reg orig="reputa-|tion">reputation</reg> <lb/>
of being singularly <reg orig="un-|worldly">unworldly</reg>, <lb/>
for a river man. Among <lb/>
other things, he said that <reg orig="Ar-|kansas">Arkansas</reg> <lb/>
had been injured and <lb/>
kept back by generations of <reg orig="ex-|aggerations">exaggerations</reg> <lb/>
concerning the <reg orig="mos-|quitoes">mosquitoes</reg> <lb/>
there. One may smile <lb/>
said he, and turn the matter off as being a small thing; but <lb/>
when you come to look at the effects produced, in the way of <lb/>
discouragement of immigration, and diminished values of <lb/>
property, it was quite the opposite of a small thing, or thing <lb/>
in any wise to be coughed down or sneered at. These <reg orig="mos-|quitoes">mosquitoes</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="373" entity="DSSR_000002932_0376"/>
had been persistently represented as being formidable <lb/>
and lawless; whereas "the truth is, they are feeble, <reg orig="insig-|nificant">insignificant</reg> <lb/>
in size, diffident to a fault, sensitive"&mdash;and so on, <lb/>
and so on; you would have supposed he was talking about <lb/>
his family. But if he was soft on the Arkansas mosquitoes, <lb/>
he was hard enough on the mosquitoes of Lake Providence <lb/>
to make up for it&mdash;"those Lake Providence colossi," as he <lb/>
finely called them. He said that two of them could whip a <lb/>
dog, and that four of them could hold a man down; and <lb/>
except help come, they would kill him&mdash;"butcher him," as <lb/>
he expressed it. Referred in a sort of casual way&mdash;and yet <lb/>
significant way&mdash;to "the <lb/>
fact that the life policy in <lb/>
its simplest form is <reg orig="un-|known">unknown</reg> <lb/>
in Lake Providence <lb/>
&mdash;they take out a mosquito <lb/>
policy besides." He told <lb/>
many remarkable things <lb/>
about those lawless insects. <lb/>
Among others, said he had <lb/>
seen them try to <hi rend="italic">vote.</hi> <reg orig="No-|ticing">Noticing</reg> <lb/>
that this statement <lb/>

as to that particular, <lb/>

"canvassing."</p>

<p>There was another <reg orig="pas-|senger&mdash;friend">passenger&mdash;friend</reg> <lb/>
of H.'s&mdash; <lb/>
who backed up the harsh <lb/>
evidence against those <lb/>
mosquitoes, and detailed some stirring adventures which he <lb/>
had had with them. The stories were pretty sizable, merely <lb/>
<pb n="374" entity="DSSR_000002932_0377"/>
pretty sizable; yet Mr. H. was continually interrupting with a <lb/>
cold, inexorable "Wait&mdash;knock off twenty-five per cent of <lb/>
that; now go on;" or, "Wait&mdash;you are getting that too <lb/>
strong; cut it down, cut it down&mdash;you get a leetle too much <lb/>
costumery on to your statements: always dress a fact in <lb/>
tights, never in an ulster;" or, "Pardon, once more: if you <lb/>

He explained privately that it was necessary to <lb/>
watch this man all the time, and keep him within bounds; <lb/>
it would not do to neglect this precaution, as he, Mr. H., <lb/>
"knew to his sorrow." Said he, "I will not deceive you; he <lb/>
told me such a monstrous lie once, that it swelled my left <lb/>
ear up, and spread it so that I was actually not able to see <lb/>
out around it; it remained so for months, and people came <lb/>

<p>Signs and scars still remain, as reminders of Vicksburg's <lb/>
tremendous war-experiences; earthworks, trees crippled by <lb/>

The caves did good service during the six weeks' <reg orig="bom-|bardment">bombardment</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="376" entity="DSSR_000002932_0379"/>
of the city&mdash;May 18 to July 4, 1863. They were <lb/>
used by the non-combatants&mdash;mainly by the women and <lb/>
children; not to live in constantly, but to fly to for safety <lb/>
on occasion. They were mere holes, tunnels, driven into <lb/>
the perpendicular clay bank, then branched Y shape, within <lb/>
the hill. Life in Vicksburg, during the six weeks was <reg orig="per-|haps&mdash;but">perhaps&mdash;but</reg> <lb/>
wait; here are some materials out of which to <lb/>
reproduce it: #x2014;</p>
<p>Population, twenty-seven thousand soldiers and three <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg> <lb/>
non-combatants; the city utterly cut off from the <lb/>
world&mdash;walled solidly in, the frontage by gunboats, the <lb/>
rear by soldiers and batteries; hence, no buying and <reg orig="sell-|ing">selling</reg> <lb/>
with the outside; no passing to and fro; no <reg orig="God-speed-|ing">God-speeding</reg> <lb/>
a parting guest, no welcoming a coming one; no printed <lb/>
acres of world-wide news to be read at breakfast, mornings <lb/>
&mdash;a tedious dull absence of such matter, instead; hence, <lb/>
also, no running to see steamboats smoking into view in <lb/>
the distance up or down, and ploughing toward the town <lb/>
&mdash;for none came, the river lay vacant and undisturbed; no <lb/>
rush and turmoil around the railway station, no struggling <lb/>
over bewildered swarms of passengers by noisy mobs of <lb/>
hackmen&mdash;all quiet there; flour two hundred dollars a <lb/>
barrel, sugar thirty, corn ten dollars a bushel, bacon five <lb/>
dollars a pound, rum a hundred dollars a gallon; other <lb/>
things in proportion: consequently, no roar and racket of <lb/>
drays and carriages tearing along the streets; nothing for <lb/>
them to do, among that handful of non-combatants of <lb/>
exhausted means; at three o'clock in the morning, silence; <lb/>
silence so dead that the measured tramp of a sentinel <lb/>
can be heard a seemingly impossible distance; out of <reg orig="hear-|ing">hearing</reg> <lb/>
of this lonely sound, perhaps the stillness is absolute: <lb/>
all in a moment come ground-shaking thunder-crashes of <lb/>
artillery, the sky is cobwebbed with the cris-crossing red <lb/>
lines streaming from soaring bomb-shells, and a rain of <lb/>
iron fragments descends upon the city; descends upon the <lb/>
empty streets: streets which are not empty a moment <lb/>
<pb n="377" entity="DSSR_000002932_0380"/>
later, but mottled with dim figures of frantic women and <lb/>
children skurrying from home and bed toward the cave <lb/>
dungeons&mdash;encouraged by the humorous grim soldiery, who <lb/>
shout "Rats, to your holes!" and laugh.</p>

<p>The cannon-thunder rages, shells scream and crash <reg orig="over-|head">overhead</reg>, <lb/>
the iron rain pours down, one hour, two hours, three, <lb/>
possibly six, then stops; silence follows, but the streets are <lb/>
still empty; the silence continues; by and by a head projects <lb/>
from a cave here and there and yonder, and reconnoitres, <lb/>
cautiously; the silence still continuing, bodies follow heads, <lb/>
and jaded, half-smothered creatures group themselves about, <lb/>

know each other, after a week or two, and familiarly; <reg orig="inso-|much">insomuch</reg> <lb/>
that the fortunate or unfortunate experiences of one <lb/>
would be of interest to all?</p>
<p>Those are the materials furnished by history. From them <lb/>
might not almost anybody reproduce for himself the life of <lb/>
that time in Vicksburg? Could you, who did not experience <lb/>
it, come nearer to reproducing it to the imagination of another <lb/>
non-participant than could a Vicksburger who <hi rend="italic">did</hi> experience <lb/>
it? It seems impossible; and yet there are reasons why it <lb/>
might not really be. When one makes his first voyage in a <lb/>
ship, it is an experience which multitudinously bristles with <lb/>
striking novelties; novelties which are in such sharp <reg orig="con-|trast">contrast</reg> <lb/>
with all this person's former experiences that they take <lb/>
a seemingly deathless grip upon his imagination and memory. <lb/>
By tongue or pen he can make a landsman live that strange <lb/>
and stirring voyage over with him; make him see it all and <lb/>
feel it all. But if he wait? If he make ten voyages in <lb/>
succession&mdash;what then? Why, the thing has lost color, <lb/>
snap, surprise; and has become commonplace. The man <lb/>
would have nothing to tell that would quicken a landsman's <lb/>
pulse.</p>
<p>Years ago, I talked with a couple of the Vicksburg <reg orig="non-|combatants&mdash;a">noncombatants&mdash;a</reg> <lb/>
man and his wife. Left to tell their story <lb/>
in their own way, those people told it without fire, almost <lb/>
without interest.</p>
<p>A week of their wonderful life there would have made <lb/>
their tongues eloquent forever perhaps; but they had six <lb/>
weeks of it, and that wore the novelty all out; they <lb/>
got used to being bomb-shelled out of home and into the <lb/>
ground; the matter became commonplace. After that, the <lb/>
possibility of their ever being startlingly interesting in their <lb/>
talks about it was gone. What the man said was to this <lb/>
effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It got to be Sunday all the time. Seven Sundays in the week&mdash; <lb/>
to us, anyway. We had n't anything to do, and time hung heavy. <lb/>
<pb n="380" entity="DSSR_000002932_0383"/>
Seven Sundays, and all of them broken up at one time or another, in <lb/>
the day or in the night, by a few hours of the awful storm of fire <lb/>
and thunder and iron. At first we used to shin for the holes a good <lb/>
deal faster than we did afterwards. The first time, I forgot the <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg>, <lb/>
and Maria fetched them both along. When she was all safe <lb/>
in the cave she fainted. Two or three weeks afterwards, when she <lb/>
was running for the holes, one morning, through a shell-shower, a <lb/>
big shell burst near her and covered her all over with dirt, and a <lb/>
piece of the iron carried away her game-bag of false hair from the <lb/>
back of her head. Well, she stopped to get that game-bag before <lb/>
she shoved along again! Was getting used to things already, you <lb/>
see. We all got so that we could tell a good deal about shells; and <lb/>
after that we did n't always go under shelter if it was a light shower. <lb/>
Us men would loaf around and talk; and a man would say, 'There <lb/>
she goes!' and name the kind of shell it was from the sound of it, <lb/>
<figure id="f210" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0383">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">bringing the children.</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="381" entity="DSSR_000002932_0384"/>
and go on talking&mdash;if there was n't any <lb/>
danger from it. If a shell was bursting <lb/>
close over us, we stopped talking and <lb/>
stood still;&mdash;uncomfortable, yes, but <lb/>
it was n't safe to move. When it let <lb/>
go, we went on talking again, if nobody <lb/>
hurt&mdash;maybe saying, 'That was a <reg orig="rip-|per">ripper</reg>!' <lb/>
or some such commonplace <reg orig="com-|ment">comment</reg> <lb/>
before we resumed; or, maybe, <lb/>
we would see a shell poising itself <lb/>
away high in the air overhead. In <lb/>
that case, every fellow <lb/>
just whipped out a <reg orig="sud-|den">sudden</reg>, <lb/>
'See you again, <lb/>
gents!' and shoved. <reg orig="Of-|ten">Often</reg> <lb/>
and often I saw <lb/>
gangs of ladies <reg orig="prome-|nading">promenading</reg> <lb/>
the streets, <reg orig="look-|ing">looking</reg> <lb/>
as cheerful as you <lb/>
please, and keeping an <lb/>
eye canted up watching <lb/>
the shells; and I've seen <lb/>
them stop still when they <lb/>
were uncertain about <lb/>
what a shell was going <lb/>
to do, and wait and make <lb/>
certain; and after that <lb/>
they s'antered along <lb/>
again, or lit out for <lb/>
shelter, according to the <lb/>
verdict. Streets in some <lb/>
towns have a litter of <lb/>
pieces of paper, and odds <lb/>
and ends of one sort or <lb/>
another lying around. <lb/>
Ours had n't; they had <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">iron</hi> litter. Sometimes a man would gather up all the iron fragments <lb/>
and unbursted shells in his neighborhood, and pile them into a kind <lb/>
of monument in his front yard&mdash;a ton of it, sometimes. No glass <lb/>

left; glass could n't stand such a bombardment; it was all shivered <lb/>
out. Windows of the houses vacant&mdash;looked like eye-holes in a <lb/>
skull. <hi rend="italic">Whole</hi> panes were as scarce as news.</p>
<p>"We had church Sundays. Not many there, along at first; but <lb/>
by and by pretty good turnouts. I've seen service stop a minute, <lb/>
and everybody sit quiet&mdash;no voice heard, pretty funeral-like then&mdash; <lb/>
and all the more so on account of the awful boom and crash going <lb/>
on outside and overhead; and pretty soon, when a body could be <lb/>
heard, service would go on again. Organs and church-music mixed <lb/>
up with a bombardment is a powerful queer combination&mdash;along at <lb/>
first. Coming out of church, one morning, we had an accident&mdash; <lb/>
the only one that happened around me on a Sunday. I was just <lb/>
having a hearty hand-shake with a friend I had n't seen for a while, <lb/>
and saying, 'Drop into our cave to-night, after bombardment; we've <lb/>
got hold of a pint of prime wh&mdash;.' Whiskey, I was going to say, <lb/>
you know, but a shell interrupted. A chunk of it cut the man's arm <lb/>
off, and left it dangling in my hand. And do you know the thing <lb/>
that is going to stick the longest in my memory, and outlast <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
else, little and big, I reckon, is the mean thought I had <lb/>
then? It was 'the whiskey <hi rend="italic">is saved.</hi>' And yet, don't you know, <lb/>
it was kind of excusable; because it was as scarce as diamonds, <lb/>
and we had only just that little; never had another taste during <lb/>
the siege.</p>
<p>"Sometimes the caves were desperately crowded, and always hot <lb/>
and close. Sometimes a cave had twenty or twenty-five people <lb/>
packed into it; no turning-room for anybody; air so foul, <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg>, <lb/>
you could n't have made a candle burn in it. A child was <lb/>
born in one of those caves one night. Think of that; why, it was <lb/>
like having it born in a trunk.</p>
<p>"Twice we had sixteen people in our cave; and a number of <lb/>
times we had a dozen. Pretty suffocating in there. We always had <lb/>
eight; eight belonged there. Hunger and misery and sickness and <lb/>
fright and sorrow, and I don't know what all, got so loaded into <lb/>
them that none of them were ever rightly their old selves after the <lb/>
siege. They all died but three of us within a couple of years. One <lb/>
night a shell burst in front of the hole and caved it in and stopped it <lb/>
up. It was lively times, for a while, digging out. Some of us came <lb/>
near smothering. After that we made two openings&mdash;ought to have <lb/>
thought of it at first.</p>

<p>"Mule meat? No, we only got down to that the last day or two. <lb/>
Of course it was good; anything is good when you are starving."</p>
<p>This man had kept a diary during&mdash;six weeks? No, only <lb/>

<p>The war history of Vicksburg has more about it to interest <lb/>
the general reader than that of any other of the river-towns. <lb/>
It is full of variety, full of incident, full of the picturesque. <lb/>
Vicksburg held out longer than any other important <reg orig="river-|town">river-town</reg>, <lb/>
and saw warfare in all its phases, both land and water <lb/>
&mdash;the siege, the mine, the assault, the repulse, the <reg orig="bombard-|ment">bombardment</reg>, <lb/>
sickness, captivity, famine.</p>
<p>The most beautiful of all the national cemeteries is here. <lb/>
Over the great gateway is this inscription:&mdash;</p>
<pb n="384" entity="DSSR_000002932_0387"/>
<q>"HERE REST IN PEACE 16,600 WHO DIED FOR THEIR COUNTRY <lb/>
IN THE YEARS 1861 TO 1865."</q>
<p>The grounds are nobly situated; being very high and <reg orig="com-|manding">commanding</reg> <lb/>
a wide prospect of land and river. They are <reg orig="taste-|fully">tastefully</reg> <lb/>
laid out in broad terraces, with <reg orig="wind-|ing">winding</reg> <lb/>
roads and paths; and there is profuse <lb/>
adornment in the way of semi-tropical <lb/>
shrubs and flowers; and in one part is a <lb/>
piece of native wild-wood, left just as it <lb/>
grew, and, therefore, perfect in its charm. <lb/>
Everything about this cemetery suggests <lb/>
the hand of the national Government. <lb/>
The Government's work is always conspicuous for excellence, <lb/>
solidity, thoroughness, neatness. The Government does its <lb/>
work well in the first place, and then takes care of it.</p>

<p>By winding-roads&mdash;which were often cut to so great a <lb/>
depth between perpendicular walls that they were mere <reg orig="roof-|less">roofless</reg> <lb/>
tunnels&mdash;we drove out a mile or two and visited the <lb/>
monument which stands upon the scene of the surrender of <lb/>
Vicksburg to General Grant by General Pemberton. Its <lb/>
metal will preserve it from the hackings and chippings which <lb/>
so defaced its predecessor, which was of marble; but the <lb/>
brick foundations are crumbling, and it will tumble down by <lb/>
and by. It overlooks a picturesque region of wooded hills <lb/>
and ravines; and is not unpicturesque itself, being well <lb/>
smothered in flowering weeds. The battered remnant of <lb/>
the marble monument has been removed to the National <lb/>
Cemetery.</p>
<p>On the road, a quarter of a mile townward, an aged colored <lb/>
man showed us, with pride, an unexploded bomb-shell which <lb/>
has lain in his yard since the day it fell there during the <lb/>
siege.</p>
<p>"I was a-stannin' heah, an' de dog was a-stannin' heah; <lb/>
de dog he went for de shell, gwine to pick a fuss wid it; but <lb/>
I did n't; I says, 'Jes' make youseff at home heah; lay still <lb/>
whah you is, or bust up de place, jes' as you's a mind to, but <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">I</hi>'s got business out in de woods, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> has!'"</p>
<p>Vicksburg is a town of substantial business streets and <lb/>
pleasant residences; it commands the commerce of the <lb/>
Yazoo and Sunflower Rivers; is pushing railways in several <lb/>
directions, through rich agricultural regions, and has a <reg orig="prom-|ising">promising</reg> <lb/>
future of prosperity and importance.</p>
<p>Apparently, nearly all the river towns, big and little, have <lb/>
made up their minds that they must look mainly to railroads <lb/>
for wealth and upbuilding, henceforth. They are acting <lb/>
upon this idea. The signs are, that the next twenty years <lb/>
will bring about some noteworthy changes in the Valley, in <lb/>
the direction of increased population and wealth, and in the <lb/>
intellectual advancement and the liberalizing of opinion <lb/>
which go naturally with these. And yet, if one may judge <lb/>
by the past; the river towns will manage to find and use a <lb/>
<pb n="386" entity="DSSR_000002932_0389"/>
chance, here and there, to cripple and retard their progress. <lb/>
They kept themselves back in the days of steamboating <lb/>
supremacy, by a system of wharfage-dues so stupidly graded <lb/>
as to prohibit what may be called small <hi rend="italic">retail</hi> traffic in <lb/>
freights and passengers. Boats were charged such heavy <lb/>
wharfage that they could not afford to land for one or two <lb/>
passengers or a light lot of freight. Instead of encouraging <lb/>
the bringing of trade to their doors, the towns diligently <lb/>
and effectively discouraged it. They could have had many <lb/>
boats and low rates; but their policy rendered few boats <lb/>
and high rates compulsory. It was a policy which extended <lb/>
&mdash;and extends&mdash;from New Orleans to St. Paul.</p>
<p>We had a strong desire to make a trip up the Yazoo and <lb/>
the Sunflower&mdash;an interesting region at any time, but <reg orig="addi-|tionally">additionally</reg> <lb/>
interesting at this time, because up there the <lb/>
great inundation was still to be seen in force,&mdash;but we were <lb/>
nearly sure to have to wait a day or more for a New Orleans <lb/>
boat on our return; so we were obliged to give up the <lb/>
project.</p>
<p>Here is a story which I picked up on board the boat that <lb/>
night. I insert it in this place merely because it is a good <lb/>
story, not because it belongs here&mdash;for it does n't. It was <lb/>
told by a passenger&mdash;a college professor&mdash;and was called <lb/>
to the surface in the course of a general conversation which <lb/>
began with talk about horses, drifted into talk about <reg orig="astron-|omy">astronomy</reg>, <lb/>
then into talk about the lynching of the gamblers in <lb/>
Vicksburg half a century ago, then into talk about dreams <lb/>
and superstitions; and ended, after midnight, in a dispute <lb/>
over free trade and protection.</p>

<head>THE PROFESSOR'S YARN.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was in the early days. I was not a college professor <lb/>
then. I was a humble-minded young land-surveyor, with <lb/>
the world before me&mdash;to survey, in case anybody wanted it <lb/>
done. I had a contract to survey a route for a great <reg orig="mining-|ditch">mining-ditch</reg> <lb/>
in California, and I was on my way thither, by sea&mdash; <lb/>
a three or four weeks' voyage. There were a good many <lb/>
passengers, but I had very little to say to them; reading and <lb/>
dreaming were my passions, and I avoided conversation in <lb/>
order to indulge these appetites. There were three <reg orig="profes-|sional">professional</reg> <lb/>
gamblers on board&mdash;rough, repulsive fellows. I never <lb/>
had any talk with them, yet I could not help seeing them <lb/>
with some frequency, for they gambled in an upper-deck <lb/>
state-room every day and night, and in my promenades I <lb/>
often had glimpses of them through their door, which stood <lb/>
a little ajar to let out the surplus tobacco smoke and <reg orig="profan-|ity">profanity</reg>. <lb/>
They were an evil and hateful presence, but I had to <lb/>
put up with it, of course.</p>
<p>There was one other passenger who fell under my eye a <lb/>
good deal, for he seemed determined to be friendly with me, <lb/>
and I could not have gotten rid of him without running some <lb/>
chance of hurting his feelings, and I was far from wishing to <lb/>
do that. Besides, there was something engaging in his <reg orig="coun-|trified">countrified</reg> <lb/>
simplicity and his beaming good-nature. The first <lb/>
time I saw this Mr. John Backus, I guessed, from his clothes <lb/>
and his looks, that he was a grazier or farmer from the back <lb/>
woods of some western State&mdash;doubtless Ohio&mdash;and <reg orig="after-|ward">afterward</reg> <lb/>
when he dropped into his personal history and I <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="388" entity="DSSR_000002932_0391"/>
that he <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a cattle-raiser from interior Ohio, I was <lb/>
so pleased with my own penetration that I warmed toward <lb/>
him for verifying my instinct.</p>
<p>He got to dropping alongside me every day, after <reg orig="break-|fast">breakfast</reg>, <lb/>
to help me make my promenade; and so, in the course <lb/>
of time, his easy-working jaw had told me everything about <lb/>
his business, <lb/>
his prospects, <lb/>
his family, his <lb/>
relatives, his <lb/>
politics&mdash;in <lb/>
fact <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
that <lb/>
concerned a <lb/>
Backus, living or dead. And <lb/>
meantime I think he had <reg orig="man-|aged">managed</reg> <lb/>
to get out of me everything <lb/>
I knew about my trade, my tribe, <lb/>
my purposes, my prospects, and <lb/>
myself. He was a gentle and <lb/>
persuasive genius, and this thing <lb/>
showed it; for I was not given <lb/>
to talking about my matters. I <lb/>
said something about <reg orig="triangula-|tion">triangulation</reg>, <lb/>
once; the stately word <lb/>
pleased his ear; he inquired what <lb/>
it meant; I explained; after that <lb/>
he quietly and inoffensively <reg orig="ig-|nored">ignored</reg> <lb/>
my name, and always <lb/>
called me Triangle.</p>

</figure>
<p>What an enthusiast he was in <lb/>
cattle! At the bare name of a <lb/>
bull or a cow, his eye would light <lb/>
and his eloquent tongue would <lb/>
turn itself loose. As long as I <lb/>
would walk and listen, he would walk and talk; he knew all <lb/>
<pb n="389" entity="DSSR_000002932_0392"/>
breeds, he loved all breeds, he caressed them all with his <lb/>
affectionate tongue. I tramped along in voiceless misery <lb/>
whilst the cattle question was up; when I could endure it <lb/>
no longer, I used to deftly insert a scientific topic into the <lb/>
conversation; then my eye fired and his faded; my tongue <lb/>
fluttered, his stopped; life was a joy to me, and a sadness to <lb/>
him.</p>
<p>One day he said, a little hesitatingly, and with somewhat <lb/>
of diffidence:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Triangle, would you mind coming down to my state-room <lb/>
a minute, and have a little talk on a certain matter?"</p>
<p>I went with him at once. Arrived there, he put his head <lb/>
out, glanced up and down the saloon warily, then closed <lb/>
the door and locked it. We sat down on the sofa, and he <lb/>
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I'm a-going to make a little proposition to you, and if it <lb/>
strikes you favorable, it'll be a middling good thing for both <lb/>
of us. You ain't a-going out to Californy for fun, nuther <lb/>
am I&mdash;it's <hi rend="italic">business,</hi> ain't that so? Well, you can do me a <lb/>
good turn, and so can I you, if we see fit. I've raked and <lb/>
scraped and saved, a considerable many years, and I've got <lb/>
it all here." He unlocked an old hair trunk, tumbled a chaos <lb/>
of shabby clothes aside, and drew a short stout bag into view <lb/>
for a moment, then buried it again and relocked the trunk. <lb/>
Dropping his voice to a cautious low tone, he continued, <lb/>
"She's all there&mdash;a round ten thousand dollars in <reg orig="yellow-|boys">yellow-boys</reg>; <lb/>
now this is my little idea: What I don't know about <lb/>
raising cattle, ain't worth knowing. There's mints of money <lb/>
in it, in Californy. Well, I know, and you know, that all <lb/>
along a line that's being surveyed, there's little dabs of land <lb/>
that they call 'gores,' that fall to the surveyor free gratis for <lb/>
nothing. All you've got to do, on your side, is to survey in <lb/>
such a way that the 'gores' will fall on good fat land, then <lb/>
you turn 'em over to me, I stock 'em with cattle, <hi rend="italic">in</hi> rolls the <lb/>
cash, I plank out your share of the dollars regular, right <lb/>
along, and&mdash;"</p>
<pb n="390" entity="DSSR_000002932_0393"/>
<p>I was sorry to wither his blooming enthusiasm, but it <lb/>
could not be helped. I interrupted, and said severely,&mdash;</p>
<p>"I am not that kind <lb/>
of a surveyor. Let us <lb/>
change the subject, Mr. <lb/>
Backus."</p>
<figure id="f215" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0393">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">a short stout bag.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>It was pitiful to see his <lb/>
confusion and hear his <lb/>
awkward and shamefaced <lb/>
apologies. I was as <lb/>
much distressed as he <lb/>
was&mdash;especially as he seemed so far from having suspected <lb/>
that there was anything improper in his proposition. So I <lb/>
hastened to console him and lead him on to forget his mishap <lb/>
in a conversational orgy about cattle and butchery. We <lb/>
were lying at Acapulco; and, as we went on deck, it <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="391" entity="DSSR_000002932_0394"/>
luckily that the crew were just beginning to hoist <lb/>
some beeves aboard in slings. Backus's melancholy <reg orig="van-|ished">vanished</reg> <lb/>
instantly, and with it the memory of his late mistake.</p>
<p>"Now only look at that!" cried he; "My goodness, <reg orig="Tri-|angle">Triangle</reg>, <lb/>
what <hi rend="italic">would</hi> they say to it in <hi rend="italic">Ohio?</hi> Would n't their <lb/>
eyes bug out, to see 'em handled like that?&mdash;would n't they, <lb/>
though?"</p>
<p>All the passengers were on deck to look&mdash;even the <reg orig="gam-|blers&mdash;and">gamblers&mdash;and</reg> <lb/>
Backus knew them all, and had afflicted them <lb/>
all with his pet topic. As I moved away, I saw one of the <lb/>
gamblers approach and accost him; then another of them; <lb/>
then the third. I halted; waited; watched; the <reg orig="conversa-|tion">conversation</reg> <lb/>
continued between the four men; it grew earnest; <lb/>
Backus drew gradually away; the gamblers followed, and <lb/>
kept at his elbow. I was uncomfortable. However, as they <lb/>
passed me presently, I heard Backus say, with a tone of <reg orig="per-|secuted">persecuted</reg> <lb/>
annoyance:&mdash;</p>
<p>"But it ain't any use, gentlemen; I tell you again, as I've <lb/>
told you a half a dozen times before, I war n't raised to it, and <lb/>
I ain't a-going to resk it."</p>
<p>I felt relieved. "His level head will be his sufficient <reg orig="pro-|tection">protection</reg>," <lb/>
I said to myself.</p>
<p>During the fortnight's run from Acapulco to San <reg orig="Fran-|cisco">Francisco</reg> <lb/>
I several times saw the gamblers talking earnestly with <lb/>
Backus, and once I threw out a gentle warning to him. He <lb/>
chuckled comfortably and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Oh, yes! they tag around after me considerable&mdash;want <lb/>
me to play a little, just for amusement, they say&mdash;but <reg orig="laws-|a-me">laws-a-me</reg>, <lb/>
if my folks have told me once to look out for that sort <lb/>
of live-stock, they've told me a thousand times, I reckon."</p>
<p>By and by, in due course, we were approaching San <lb/>
Francisco. It was an ugly black night, with a strong wind <lb/>
blowing, but there was not much sea. I was on deck, alone. <lb/>
Toward ten I started below. A figure issued from the <reg orig="gam-|blers">gamblers</reg>' <lb/>
den, and disappeared in the darkness. I experienced <lb/>
a shock, for I was sure it was Backus. I flew down the <lb/>
<pb n="392" entity="DSSR_000002932_0395"/>
companion-way, looked about for him, could not find him, <lb/>
then returned to the deck just in time to catch a glimpse <lb/>
of him as he re-entered that confounded nest of rascality. <lb/>
Had he yielded at last? I feared it. What had he gone <lb/>
below for?&mdash;His bag of coin? Possibly. I drew near the <lb/>
door, full of bodings. It was a-crack, and I glanced in and <lb/>
saw a sight that made me <lb/>
bitterly wish I had given <lb/>
my attention to saving my <lb/>
poor cattle-friend, instead <lb/>
of reading and dreaming <lb/>
my foolish time away. He <lb/>
was gambling. Worse still, <lb/>
he was being plied with <lb/>
champagne, and was <reg orig="al-|ready">already</reg> <lb/>
showing some effect <lb/>
from it. He praised the <lb/>
"cider," as he called it, and <lb/>
said now that he had got a <lb/>
taste of it he almost <reg orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg> <lb/>
he would drink it <lb/>
if it was spirits, it was so <lb/>
good and so ahead of <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
he had ever run across <lb/>
before. Surreptitious <lb/>
smiles, at this, passed from <lb/>
one rascal to another, and <lb/>
they filled all the glasses, and whilst Backus honestly drained <lb/>
his to the bottom they pretended to do the same, but threw <lb/>
the wine over their shoulders.</p>
<figure id="f216" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0395">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">the door was a-crack.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>I could not bear the scene, so I wandered forward and <lb/>
tried to interest myself in the sea and the voices of the <lb/>
wind. But no, my uneasy spirit kept dragging me back at <lb/>
quarter-hour intervals; and always I saw Backus drinking <lb/>
his wine&mdash;fairly and squarely, and the others throwing <lb/>
theirs away. It was the painfulest night I ever spent.</p>
<pb n="393" entity="DSSR_000002932_0396"/>
<p>The only hope I had was that we might reach our <reg orig="anchor-|age">anchorage</reg> <lb/>
with speed&mdash;that would break up the game. I helped <lb/>
the ship along all I could with my prayers. At last we went <lb/>
booming through the Golden Gate, and my pulses leaped for <lb/>
joy. I hurried back to that door and glanced in. Alas, there <lb/>
was small room for hope&mdash;Backus's eyes were heavy and <lb/>
bloodshot, his sweaty face was <lb/>
crimson, his speech maudlin <lb/>
and thick, his body sawed <reg orig="drunk-|enly">drunkenly</reg> <lb/>
about with the weaving <lb/>
motion of the ship. He drained <lb/>
another glass to the dregs, <lb/>
whilst the cards were being dealt.</p>
<figure id="f217" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0396">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"five hundred better."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>He took his hand, glanced at it, and his dull eyes lit up <lb/>
for a moment. The gamblers observed it, and showed their <lb/>
gratification by hardly perceptible signs.</p>
<p>"How many cards?"</p>
<p>"None!" said Backus.</p>
<p>One villain&mdash;named Hank Wiley&mdash;discarded one card, <lb/>
<pb n="394" entity="DSSR_000002932_0397"/>
the others three each. The betting began. Heretofore the <lb/>
bets had been trifling&mdash;a dollar or two; but Backus started <lb/>
off with an eagle now, Wiley hesitated a moment, then "saw <lb/>
it" and "went ten dollars better." The other two threw up <lb/>
their hands.</p>
<p>Backus went twenty better. Wiley said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"I see that, and go you a <hi rend="italic">hundred</hi> better!" then smiled <lb/>
and reached for the money.</p>
<p>"Let it alone," said Backus, with drunken gravity.</p>
<p>"What! you mean to say you're going to cover it?"</p>
<p>"Cover it? Well I reckon I am&mdash;and lay another <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
on top of it, too."</p>
<p>He reached down inside his overcoat and produced the <lb/>
required sum.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's your little game, is it? I see your raise, and <lb/>
raise it five hundred!" said Wiley.</p>
<p>"Five hundred <hi rend="italic">better!</hi>" said the foolish bull-driver, and <lb/>
pulled out the amount and showered it on the pile. The <lb/>
three conspirators hardly tried to conceal their exultation.</p>
<p>All diplomacy and pretence were dropped now, and the <lb/>
sharp exclamations came thick and fast, and the yellow <lb/>
pyramid grew higher and higher. At last ten thousand <lb/>
dollars lay in view. Wiley cast a bag of coin on the table, <lb/>
and said with mocking gentleness,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Five thousand dollars better, my friend from the rural <lb/>
districts&mdash;what do you say <hi rend="italic">now?</hi>"</p>
<p>"I <hi rend="italic">call</hi> you!" said Backus, heaving his golden shot-bag <lb/>
on the pile. "What have you got?"</p>
<p>"Four kings, you d&mdash;d fool!" and Wiley threw down his <lb/>
cards and surrounded the stakes with his arms.</p>
<p>"Four <hi rend="italic">aces,</hi> you ass!" thundered. Backus, covering <lb/>
his man with a cocked revolver. "<hi rend="italic">I'm a professional <lb/>
gambler myself, and I've been laying for you duffers all <lb/>
this voyage!</hi>"</p>
<p>Down went the anchor, rumbledy-dum-dum! and the long <lb/>
trip was ended.</p>
<pb n="395" entity="DSSR_000002932_0398"/>
<p>Well&mdash;well, it is a sad world. One of the three gamblers <lb/>
was Backus's "pal." It was he that dealt the fateful hands. <lb/>
According to an understanding with the two victims, he was <lb/>
to have given Backus four queens, but alas, he did n't.</p>
<figure id="f218" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0398">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"been laying for you duffers."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>A week later, I stumbled upon Backus&mdash;arrayed in the <lb/>
height of fashion&mdash;in Montgomery Street. He said, cheerily, <lb/>
as we were parting,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Ah, by-the-way, you need n't mind about those gores. I <lb/>
don't really know anything about cattle, except what I was <lb/>
able to pick up in a week's apprenticeship over in Jersey just <lb/>
<pb n="396" entity="DSSR_000002932_0399"/>
before we sailed. My cattle-culture and cattle-enthusiasm <lb/>
have served their turn&mdash;I shan't need them any more."</p>
<ornament type="line"/>
<p>Next day we reluctantly parted from the "Gold Dust" <lb/>
and her officers, hoping to see that boat and all those officers <lb/>
again, some day. A thing which the fates were to render <lb/>
tragically impossible!</p>

<p>Mr. Dickens declined to agree that the Mississippi <reg orig="steam-|boats">steamboats</reg> <lb/>
were "magnificent," or that they were "floating <reg orig='pala-|ces,"&mdash;terms'>palaces,"&mdash;terms</reg> <lb/>
which had always been applied to them; terms <lb/>
which did not over-express the admiration with which the <lb/>
people viewed them.</p>
<p>Mr. Dickens's position was unassailable, possibly; the <lb/>
people's position was certainly unassailable. If Mr. Dickens <lb/>
was comparing these boats with the crown jewels; or with <lb/>
the Taj, or with the Matterhorn; or with some other <reg orig="price-|less">priceless</reg> <lb/>
or wonderful thing which he had seen, they were not <lb/>
magnificent&mdash;he was right. The people compared them <lb/>
with what <hi rend="italic">they</hi> had seen; and, thus measured, thus judged, <lb/>
the boats were magnificent&mdash;the term was the correct one, <lb/>
it was not at all too strong. The people were as right as <lb/>
was Mr. Dickens. The steamboats were finer than anything <lb/>
on shore. Compared with superior dwelling-houses and first <lb/>
class hotels in the Valley, they were indubitably <reg orig="magnifi-|cent">magnificent</reg>, <lb/>
they were "palaces." To a few people living in New <lb/>
Orleans and St. Louis, they were not magnificent, perhaps; <lb/>
not palaces; but to the great majority of those populations, <lb/>
and to the entire populations spread over both banks between <lb/>
Baton Rouge and St. Louis, they were palaces; they tallied <lb/>
with the citizen's dream of what magnificence was, and <lb/>
satisfied it.</p>

<p>Every town and village along that vast stretch of double <lb/>
river-frontage had a best dwelling, finest dwelling, mansion, <lb/>
&mdash;the home of its wealthiest and most conspicuous citizen. <lb/>
It is easy to describe it: large grassy yard, with paling fence <lb/>
painted white&mdash;in fair repair; brick walk from gate to <lb/>
door; big, square, two-story "frame" house, painted white <lb/>
and porticoed like a Grecian temple&mdash;with this difference, <lb/>
that the imposing fluted columns and Corinthian capitals <lb/>
were a pathetic sham, being made of white pine, and <lb/>
painted; iron knocker; brass door knob&mdash;discolored, for <lb/>
lack of polishing. Within, an uncarpeted hall, of planed <lb/>
boards; opening out of it, a parlor, fifteen feet by fifteen&mdash; <lb/>
in some instances five or ten feet larger; ingrain carpet; <lb/>
mahogany centre-table; lamp on it, with green-paper shade <lb/>
&mdash;standing on a gridiron, so to speak, made of high-colored <lb/>
yarns, by the young ladies of the house, and called a <reg orig="lamp-|mat">lamp-mat</reg>; <lb/>
several books, piled and disposed, with cast-iron <lb/>
exactness, according to an inherited and unchangeable plan; <lb/>
among them, Tupper, much pencilled; also, "Friendship's <lb/>
Offering," and "Affection's Wreath," with their sappy <lb/>
inanities illustrated in die-away mezzotints; also, Ossian; <lb/>
"Alonzo and Melissa;" maybe "Ivanhoe;" also "Album," <lb/>
full of original "poetry" of the Thou-hast-wounded-<reg orig="the-|spirit-that-loved-thee">the-spirit-that-loved-thee</reg> <lb/>

with a two-inch wedge sticking from under her dress and <lb/>

dome, large bouquet of stiff flowers done in corpsy white wax. <lb/>
Pyramidal what-not in the corner, the shelves occupied <lb/>

another shell&mdash;of the long-oval sort, narrow, straight orifice, <lb/>
three inches long, running from end to end&mdash;portrait of <lb/>
Washington carved on it; not well done; the shell had <lb/>
Washington's mouth, originally&mdash;artist should have built to <lb/>
that. These two are memorials of the long-ago bridal trip <lb/>
to New Orleans and the French Market. Other bric-a-brac: <lb/>
Californian "specimens"&mdash;quartz, with gold wart adhering; <lb/>
old Guinea-gold locket, with circlet of ancestral hair in it; <lb/>
Indian arrow-heads, of flint; pair of bead moccasins, from <lb/>

else in the room. Not a bathroom in the house; and no <lb/>
visitor likely to come along who has ever seen one.</p>
<p>That was the residence of the principal citizen, all the <lb/>
way from the suburbs of New Orleans to the edge of St. <lb/>
Louis. When he stepped aboard a big fine steamboat, he <lb/>
entered a new and marvellous world: chimney-tops cut to <lb/>
counterfeit a spraying crown of plumes&mdash;and maybe painted <lb/>
red; pilot-house, hurricane deck, boiler-deck guards, all <lb/>
garnished with white wooden filagree work of fanciful <reg orig="pat-|terns">patterns</reg>; <lb/>
gilt acorns topping the derricks; gilt deer-horns over <lb/>
the big bell; gaudy symbolical picture on the paddle-box, <lb/>
possibly; big roomy boiler-deck, painted blue, and furnished <lb/>
with Windsor arm-chairs; inside, a far receding snow-white <lb/>
"cabin;" porcelain knob and oil-picture on every state-room <lb/>
door; curving patterns of filagree-work touched up with <lb/>
gilding, stretching overhead all down the converging vista; <lb/>
big chandeliers every little way, each an April shower of <lb/>
glittering glass-drops; lovely rainbow-light falling <reg orig="every-|where">everywhere</reg> <lb/>
from the colored glazing of the skylights; the whole <lb/>
a long-drawn, resplendent tunnel, a bewildering and <reg orig="soul-|satisfying">soul-satisfying</reg> <lb/>
spectacle! in the ladies' cabin a pink and white <lb/>
Wilton carpet, as soft as mush, and glorified with a <reg orig="ravish-|ing">ravishing</reg> <lb/>
pattern of gigantic flowers. Then the Bridal Chamber <lb/>
&mdash;the animal that invented that idea was still alive and <lb/>
unhanged, at that day&mdash;Bridal Chamber whose pretentious <lb/>
flummery was necessarily overawing to the now tottering <lb/>
intellect of that hosannahing citizen. Every state-room had <lb/>
its couple of cosy clean bunks, and perhaps a looking-glass <lb/>
and a snug closet; and sometimes there was even a <reg orig="wash-|bowl">washbowl</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="407" entity="DSSR_000002932_0410"/>
and pitcher, and part of a towel which could be told <lb/>
from mosquito netting by an expert&mdash;though generally these <lb/>
things were absent, and the shirt-sleeved passengers cleansed <lb/>
themselves at a long row of stationary bowls in the barber <lb/>
shop, where were also public towels, public combs, and public <lb/>
soap.</p>
<p>Take the steamboat which I have just described, and you <lb/>
have her in her highest and finest, and most pleasing, and <lb/>
comfortable, and satisfactory estate. Now cake her over <lb/>
with a layer of ancient and obdurate dirt, and you have the <lb/>
Cincinnati steamer awhile ago referred to. Not all over&mdash; <lb/>
only inside; for she was ably officered in all departments <lb/>
except the steward's.</p>
<p>But wash that boat and repaint her, and she would be <lb/>
about the counterpart of the most complimented boat of the <lb/>
old flush times: for the steamboat architecture of the West <lb/>
has undergone no change; neither has steamboat furniture <lb/>
and ornamentation undergone any.</p>

<head>MANUFACTURES AND MISCREANTS.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Where</hi> the river, in the Vicksburg region, used to be <lb/>
corkscrewed, it is now comparatively straight&mdash; <lb/>
made so by cut-off; a former distance of seventy miles is <lb/>
reduced to thirty-five. It is a change which threw <reg orig="Vicks-|burg's">Vicksburg's</reg> <lb/>
neighbor, Delta, Louisiana, out into the country and <lb/>
ended its career as a river town. Its whole river-frontage is <lb/>
now occupied by a vast sand-bar, thickly covered with young <lb/>
trees&mdash;a growth which will magnify itself into a dense <reg orig="for-|est">forest</reg>, <lb/>
by and by, and completely hide the exiled town.</p>
<p>In due time we passed Grand Gulf and Rodney, of war <lb/>
fame, and reached Natchez, the last of the beautiful <reg orig="hill-|cities&mdash;for">hillcities&mdash;for</reg> <lb/>
Baton Rouge, yet to come, is not on a hill, but <lb/>
only on high ground. Famous Natchez-under-the-hill has <lb/>
not changed notably in twenty years; in outward aspect&mdash; <lb/>
judging by the descriptions of the ancient procession of <lb/>
foreign tourists&mdash;it has not changed in sixty; for it is still <lb/>
small, straggling, and shabby. It had a desperate reputation, <lb/>
morally, in the old keel-boating and early steamboating times <lb/>
&mdash;plenty of drinking, carousing, fisticuffing, and killing <lb/>
there, among the riff-raff of the river, in those days. But <lb/>
Natchez-on-top-of-the-hill is attractive; has always been <lb/>
attractive. Even Mrs. Trollope (1827) had to confess its <lb/>
charms:</p>
<q>
<p>"At one or two points the wearisome level line is relieved by <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">bluffs,</hi> as they call the short intervals of high ground. The town <lb/>
of Natchez is beautifully situated on one of those high spots. The <lb/>
contrast that its bright green hill forms with the dismal line of black <lb/>
<pb n="409" entity="DSSR_000002932_0412"/>
forest that stretches on every side, the abundant growth of the <reg orig="paw-|paw">paw-paw</reg>, <lb/>
palmetto and orange, the copious variety of sweet-scented flowers <lb/>
that flourish there, all make it appear like an oasis in the desert. <lb/>
Natchez is the furthest point to the north at which oranges ripen in <lb/>
the open air, or endure the winter without shelter. With the <reg orig="excep-|tion">exception</reg> <lb/>
of this sweet spot, I thought all the little towns and villages <lb/>
we passed wretched-looking in the extreme."</p>

<p>Natchez, like her near and far river neighbors, has <reg orig="rail-|ways">railways</reg> <lb/>
now, and is adding to them&mdash;pushing them hither <lb/>
and thither into all rich outlying regions that are naturally <lb/>
tributary to her. And like Vicksburg and New Orleans, she <lb/>
has her ice-factory; she makes thirty tons of ice a day. In <lb/>
Vicksburg and Natchez, in my time, ice was jewelry; none <lb/>
but the rich could wear it. But anybody and everybody can <lb/>
have it now. I visited one of the ice-factories in New <lb/>
Orleans, to see what the polar regions might look like when <lb/>
lugged into the edge of the tropics. But there was nothing <lb/>
<pb n="410" entity="DSSR_000002932_0413"/>
striking in the aspect of the place. It was merely a spacious <lb/>
house, with some innocent steam machinery in one end of it <lb/>
and some big porcelain pipes running here and there. No, <lb/>
not porcelain&mdash;they merely seemed to be; they were iron, <lb/>
but the ammonia which was being breathed through them <lb/>
had coated them to the thickness of your hand with solid <lb/>
milk-white ice. It ought to have melted; for one did not <lb/>
require winter clothing in that atmosphere: but it did not <lb/>
melt; the inside of the pipe was too cold.</p>
<p>Sunk into the floor were numberless tin boxes, a foot <lb/>
square and two feet long, and open at the top end. These <lb/>
were full of clear water; and around each box, salt and other <lb/>
proper stuff was packed; also, the ammonia gases were <lb/>
applied to the water in some way which will always remain <lb/>
a secret to me, because I was not able to understand the <lb/>
process. While the water in the boxes gradually froze, men <lb/>
gave it a stir or two with a stick occasionally&mdash;to liberate <lb/>
the air-bubbles, I think. Other men were continually lifting <lb/>
out boxes whose contents had become hard frozen. They <lb/>
gave the box a single dip into a vat of boiling water, to melt <lb/>
the block of ice free from its tin coffin, then they shot the <lb/>
block out upon a platform car, and it was ready for market. <lb/>
These big blocks were hard, solid, and crystal-clear. In <lb/>
certain of them, big bouquets of fresh and brilliant tropical <lb/>
flowers had been frozen-in; in others, beautiful silken-clad <lb/>
French dolls, and other pretty objects. These blocks were to <lb/>
be set on end in a platter, in the centre of dinner-tables, to <lb/>
cool the tropical air; and also to be ornamental, for the <lb/>
flowers and things imprisoned in them could be seen as <lb/>
through plate glass. I was told that this factory could <lb/>
retail its ice, by wagon, throughout New Orleans, in the <lb/>
humblest dwelling house quantities, at six or seven dollars <lb/>
a ton, and make a sufficient profit. This being the case, <lb/>
there is business for ice factories in the North; for we get <lb/>
ice on no such terms there, if one take less than three <lb/>
hundred and fifty pounds at a delivery.</p>

<p>The Rosalie Yarn Mill, of Natchez, has a capacity of <lb/>
6,000 spindles and 160 looms, and employs 100 hands. The <lb/>
Natchez Cotton Mills Company began operations four years <lb/>
ago in a two-story building of 50 &times; 190 feet, with 4,000 <lb/>
spindles and 128 looms; capital $105,000, all subscribed in <lb/>
the town. Two years later, the same stockholders increased <lb/>
their capital to $225,000; added a third story to the mill, <lb/>
increased its length to 317 feet; added machinery to increase <lb/>
the capacity to 10,300 spindles and 304 looms. The company <lb/>
now employ 250 <lb/>

<p>The changes in the Mississippi River are great and strange, <lb/>
yet were to be expected; but I was not expecting to live to <lb/>
see Natchez and these other river towns become <reg orig="manufactur-|ing">manufacturing</reg> <lb/>
strongholds and railway centres.</p>
<p>Speaking of manufactures reminds me of a talk upon that <lb/>
topic which I heard&mdash;which I overheard&mdash;on board the <lb/>
Cincinnati boat. I awoke out of a fretted sleep, with a dull <lb/>
<pb n="412" entity="DSSR_000002932_0415"/>
confusion of voices in my ears. I listened&mdash;two men were <lb/>
talking; subject, apparently, the great inundation. I looked <lb/>
out through the open transom. The two men were eating a <lb/>
late breakfast; sitting opposite each other; nobody else <lb/>
around. They closed up the inundation with a few words&mdash; <lb/>
having used it, evidently, as a mere ice-breaker and <reg orig="acquaint-|anceship-breeder&mdash;then">acquaintanceship-breeder&mdash;then</reg> <lb/>
they dropped into business. It <lb/>
soon transpired that they were drummers&mdash;one belonging <lb/>
in Cincinnati, the other in New Orleans. Brisk men, <reg orig="ener-|getic">energetic</reg> <lb/>
of movement and speech; the dollar their god, how to <lb/>
get it their religion.</p>
<p>"Now as to this article," said Cincinnati, slashing into the <lb/>
ostensible butter and holding forward a slab of it on his <reg orig="knife-|blade">knife-blade</reg>, <lb/>
"it's from our house; look at it&mdash;smell of it&mdash;taste <lb/>
it. Put any test on it you want to. Take your own time&mdash; <lb/>
no hurry&mdash;make it thorough. There now&mdash;what do you <lb/>
say? butter, ain't it? Not by a thundering sight&mdash;it's <reg orig="oleo-|margarine">oleomargarine</reg>! <lb/>
Yes, sir, that's what it is&mdash;oleomargarine. <lb/>
You can't tell it from butter; by George, an <hi rend="italic">expert</hi> can't. <lb/>
It's from our house. We supply most of the boats in the <lb/>
West; there's hardly a pound of butter on one of them. We <lb/>
are crawling right along&mdash;<hi rend="italic">jumping</hi> right along is the word. <lb/>
We are going to have that entire trade. Yes, and the hotel <lb/>
trade, too. You are going to see the day, pretty soon, when <lb/>
you can't find an ounce of butter to bless yourself with, in any <lb/>
hotel in the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, outside of the <lb/>
biggest cities. Why, we are turning out oleomargarine <hi rend="italic">now</hi> <lb/>
by the thousands of tons. And we can sell it so dirt-cheap <lb/>
that the whole country has <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to take it&mdash;can't get around <lb/>
it you see. Butter don't stand any show&mdash;there ain't any <lb/>
chance for competition. Butter's had its <hi rend="italic">day</hi>&mdash;and from <lb/>
this out, butter goes to the wall. There's more money in <lb/>
oleomargarine than&mdash;why, you can't imagine the business <lb/>
we do. I've stopped in every town, from Cincinnati to <lb/>
Natchez; and I've sent home big orders from every one of <lb/>
them."</p>
<pb n="413" entity="DSSR_000002932_0416"/>
<p>And so-forth and so-on, for ten minutes longer, in the <lb/>
same fervid strain. Then New Orleans piped up and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Yes, it's a first-rate <lb/>
imitation, that's a <reg orig="cer-|tainty">certainty</reg>; <lb/>
but it ain't the <lb/>
only one around that's <lb/>
first-rate. For instance, <lb/>
they make olive-oil out of cotton-seed oil, now-a-days, so <lb/>
that you can't tell them apart."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so," responded Cincinnati, "and it was a <reg orig="tip-|top">tiptop</reg> <lb/>
business for a while. They sent it over and brought it <lb/>

<p>Goes to his state-room, brings back a couple of long bottles <lb/>
and takes out the corks&mdash;says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"There now, smell them, taste them, examine the bottles, <lb/>
inspect the labels. One of 'm's from Europe, the other's <lb/>
never been out of this country. One's European olive-oil, <lb/>
the other's American cotton-seed olive-oil. Tell 'm apart? <lb/>
'Course you can't. Nobody can. People that want to, can go <lb/>
to the expense and trouble of shipping their oils to Europe <lb/>
and back&mdash;it's their privilege; but our firm knows a trick <lb/>
worth six of that. We turn out the whole thing&mdash;clean <lb/>
from the word go&mdash;in our factory in New Orleans: labels, <lb/>
bottles, oil, everything. Well, no, not labels: been buying <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">them</hi> abroad&mdash;get them dirt-cheap there. You see, there's <lb/>
just one little wee speck, essence, or whatever it is, in a <lb/>
gallon of cotton-seed oil, that gives it a smell, or a flavor, or <lb/>
something&mdash;get that out, and you're all right&mdash;perfectly <lb/>
easy then to turn the oil into any kind of oil you want to, <lb/>
and there ain't anybody that can detect the true from the <lb/>
false. Well, we know how to get that one little particle out <lb/>
&mdash;and we're the only firm that does. And we turn out an <lb/>
olive-oil that is just simply perfect&mdash;undetectable! We are <lb/>
doing a ripping trade, too&mdash;as I could easily show you by <lb/>
my order-book for this trip. Maybe you'll butter <reg orig="every-|body's">everybody's</reg> <lb/>
bread pretty soon, but we'll cotton-seed his salad <lb/>
for him from the Gulf to Canada, and that's a dead-certain <lb/>
thing."</p>
<p>Cincinnati glowed and flashed with admiration. The two <lb/>
scoundrels exchanged business-cards, and rose. As they <lb/>
left the table, Cincinnati said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"But you have to have custom-house marks, don't you? <lb/>
How do you manage that?"</p>
<p>I did not catch the answer.</p>
<p>We passed Port Hudson, scene of two of the most terrific <lb/>
episodes of the war&mdash;the night-battle there between <reg orig="Far-|ragut's">Farragut's</reg> <lb/>
fleet and the Confederate land batteries, April 14th, <lb/>
<pb n="415" entity="DSSR_000002932_0418"/>
1863; and the memorable land battle, two months later, <lb/>
which lasted eight hours&mdash;eight hours of exceptionally fierce <lb/>
and stubborn fighting&mdash;and ended, finally, in the repulse of <lb/>
the Union forces with great slaughter.</p>

<head>CASTLES AND CULTURE.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Baton rouge</hi> was clothed in flowers, like a bride&mdash; <lb/>
no, much more so; like a greenhouse. For we were <lb/>
in the absolute South now&mdash;no modifications, no <reg orig="compro-|mises">compromises</reg>, <lb/>
no half-way measures. The magnolia-trees in the <lb/>
Capitol grounds were lovely and fragrant, with their dense <lb/>
rich foliage and huge snow-ball blossoms. The scent of the <lb/>
flower is very sweet, but you want distance on it, because it <lb/>
is so powerful. They are not good bedroom blossoms&mdash; <lb/>
they might suffocate one in his sleep. We were certainly in <lb/>
the South at last; for here the sugar region begins, and the <lb/>
plantations&mdash;vast green levels, with sugar-mill and negro <lb/>
quarters clustered together in the middle distance&mdash;were in <lb/>
view. And there was a tropical sun overhead and a tropical <lb/>
swelter in the air.</p>
<p>And at this point, also, begins the pilot's paradise: a wide <lb/>
river hence to New Orleans, abundance of water from shore <lb/>
to shore, and no bars, snags, sawyers, or wrecks in his road.</p>
<p>Sir Walter Scott is probably responsible for the Capitol <lb/>
building; for it is not conceivable that this little sham castle <lb/>
would ever have been built if he had not run the people mad, <lb/>
a couple of generations ago, with his medi&aelig;val romances. <lb/>
The South has not yet recovered from the debilitating <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg> <lb/>
of his books. Admiration of his fantastic heroes and <lb/>
their grotesque "chivalry" doings and romantic juvenilities <lb/>
still survives here, in an atmosphere in which is already <reg orig="per-|ceptible">perceptible</reg> <lb/>
the wholesome and practical nineteenth-century <lb/>
smell of cotton-factories and locomotives; and traces of its <lb/>
<pb n="417" entity="DSSR_000002932_0420"/>
inflated language and other windy humbuggeries survive <lb/>
along with it. It is pathetic enough, that a whitewashed <lb/>
castle, with turrets and things&mdash;materials all ungenuine <lb/>
within and without, pretending to be what they are not&mdash; <lb/>
should ever have been built in this otherwise honorable <lb/>
place; but it is much more pathetic to see this architectural <lb/>
falsehood undergoing restoration and perpetuation in our <lb/>
day, when it would have <lb/>
been so easy to let <reg orig="dyna-|mite">dynamite</reg> <lb/>
finish what a <reg orig="chari-|table">charitable</reg> <lb/>

devote this <reg orig="restoration-|money">restoration-money</reg> <lb/>
to the building of <lb/>
something genuine.</p>

<p>Baton Rouge has no <lb/>
patent on imitation <reg orig="cas-|tles">castles</reg>, <lb/>
however, and no <lb/>

is a picture from the <lb/>
advertisement of the "Female Institute" of Columbia, <reg orig="Ten-|nessee;">Tennessee</reg>. <lb/>
The following remark is from the same <reg orig="advertise-|ment:&mdash;">advertisement:&mdash;</reg>
</p>
<q>
<p>"The Institute building has long been famed as a model of <reg orig="strik-|ing">striking</reg> <lb/>
and beautiful architecture. Visitors are charmed with its <lb/>
resemblance to the old castles of song and story, with its towers, <lb/>
turreted walls, and ivy-mantled porches."</p>
</q>
<p>Keeping school in a castle is a romantic thing; as <reg orig="roman-|tic">romantic</reg> <lb/>
as keeping hotel in a castle.</p>
<p>By itself the imitation castle is doubtless harmless, and <lb/>
well enough; but as a symbol and breeder and sustainer of <lb/>
maudlin Middle-Age romanticism here in the midst of the <lb/>
plainest and sturdiest and infinitely greatest and worthiest <lb/>
of all the centuries the world has seen, it is necessarily a <lb/>
hurtful thing and a mistake.</p>
<p>Here is an extract from the prospectus of a Kentucky <lb/>
"Female College." Female college sounds well enough; <lb/>
<pb n="418" entity="DSSR_000002932_0421"/>
but since the phrasing it in that unjustifiable way was done <lb/>
purely in the interest of brevity, it seems to me that she-<reg orig="col-|lege">college</reg> <lb/>
would have been still better&mdash;because shorter, and <lb/>
means the same thing: that is, if either phrase means <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
at all:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The president is southern by birth, by rearing, by education, <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Knoxville,</hi> Tenn., October 19.&mdash;This morning a few minutes after ten <lb/>
o'clock, General Joseph A. Mabry, Thomas O'Connor, and Joseph A. Mabry, <lb/>
Jr., were killed in a shooting affray. The difficulty began yesterday afternoon <lb/>
by General Mabry attacking Major O'Connor and threatening to kill him. <lb/>
This was at the fair grounds, and O'Connor told Mabry that it was not the <lb/>
place to settle their difficulties. Mabry then told O'Connor he should not live. <lb/>
It seems that Mabry was armed and O'Connor was not. The cause of the <lb/>
difficulty was an old feud about the transfer of some property from Mabry to <lb/>
O'Connor. Later in the afternoon Mabry sent word to O'Connor that he <lb/>
would kill him on sight. This morning Major O'Connor was standing in the <lb/>
door of the Mechanics' National Bank, of which he was president. General <lb/>
Mabry and another gentleman walked down Gay Street on the opposite side <lb/>
from the bank. O'Connor stepped into the bank, got a shot gun, took <reg orig="deliber-|ate">deliberate</reg> <lb/>
aim at General Mabry and fired. Mabry fell dead, being shot in the left <lb/>
side. As he fell O'Connor fired again, the shot taking effect in Mabry's thigh. <lb/>
O'Connor then reached into the bank and got another shot gun. About this time <lb/>
Joseph A. Mabry, Jr., son of General Mabry, came rushing down the street, <lb/>
unseen by O'Connor until within forty feet, when the young man fired a pistol, <lb/>
the shot taking effect in O'Connor's right breast, passing through the body <lb/>
near the heart. The instant Mabry shot, O'Connor turned and fired, the load <lb/>
taking effect in young Mabry's right breast and side. Mabry fell pierced with <lb/>
twenty buckshot, and almost instantly O'Connor fell dead without a struggle. <lb/>
Mabry tried to rise, but fell back dead. The whole tragedy occurred within <lb/>
two minutes, and neither of the three spoke after he was shot. General Mabry <lb/>
had about thirty buckshot in his body. A bystander was painfully wounded in <lb/>
the thigh with a buckshot, and another was wounded in the arm. Four other <lb/>
men had their clothing pierced by buckshot. The affair caused great <reg orig="excite-|ment">excitement</reg>, <lb/>
and Gay Street was thronged with thousands of people. General Mabry <lb/>
and his son Joe were acquitted only a few days ago of the murder of Moses <lb/>
Lusby and Don Lusby, father and son, whom they killed a few weeks ago. <lb/>
Will Mabry was killed by Don Lusby last Christmas. Major Thomas <reg orig="O'Con-|nor">O'Connor</reg> <lb/>
was President of the Mechanics' National Bank here, and was the <reg orig="wealthi-|est">wealthiest</reg> <lb/>
man in the State.&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Associated Press Telegram.</hi></p>
<p>One day last month, Professor Sharpe, of the Somerville, Tenn., Female <lb/>
College, "a quiet and gentlemanly man," was told that his brother-<reg orig="in-|law">in-law</reg>, <lb/>
a Captain Burton, had threatened to kill him. Burton, it seems, had <lb/>
already killed one man and driven his knife into another. The Professor <lb/>
armed himself with a double-barrelled shot gun, started out in search of his <lb/>
brother-in-law, found him playing billiards in a saloon, and blew his brains out. <lb/>
The "Memphis Avalanche" reports that the Professor's course met with pretty <lb/>
general approval in the community; knowing that the law was powerless, in <lb/>
the actual condition of public sentiment, to protect him, he protected himself.</p>
<p>About the same time, two young men in North Carolina quarrelled about <lb/>
a girl, and "hostile messages" were exchanged. Friends tried to reconcile <lb/>
them, but had their labor for their pains. On the 24th the young men met in <lb/>
the public highway. One of them had a heavy club in his hand, the other an <lb/>
axe. The man with the club fought desperately for his life, but it was a <reg orig="hope-|less">hopeless</reg> <lb/>
fight from the first. A well-directed blow sent his club whirling out of <lb/>
his grasp, and the next moment he was a dead man.</p>
<p>About the same time, two "highly connected" young Virginians, clerks in <lb/>
a hardware store at Charlottesville, while "skylarking," came to blows. <lb/>
Peter Dick threw pepper in Charles Roads's eyes; Roads demanded an <reg orig="apol-|ogy">apology</reg>; <lb/>
Dick refused to give it, and it was agreed that a duel was inevitable, but <lb/>
a difficulty arose; the parties had no pistols, and it was too late at night to <lb/>
procure them. One of them suggested that butcher-knives would answer the <lb/>
purpose, and the other accepted the suggestion; the result was that Roads fell to <lb/>
the floor with a gash in his abdomen that may or may not prove fatal. If <lb/>
Dick has been arrested, the news has not reached us. He "expressed deep <lb/>
regret," and we are told by a Staunton correspondent of the "Philadelphia <lb/>
Press" that "every effort has been made to hush the matter up."&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Extracts <lb/>

 the young ladies are trained <lb/>
<pb n="419" entity="DSSR_000002932_0422"/>
according to the southern ideas of delicacy, refinement, womanhood, <lb/>
religion, and propriety; hence we offer a first-class female college <lb/>
for the south and solicit southern patronage."</p>
<p>What, warder, ho! the man that can blow so complacent <lb/>
a blast as that, probably blows it from a castle.</p>
<p>From Baton Rouge to New Orleans, the great sugar <reg orig="plan-|tations">plantations</reg> <lb/>
border both sides of the river all the way, and stretch <lb/>
their league-wide levels back to the dim forest-walls of <lb/>
bearded cypress in the rear. Shores lonely no longer. <lb/>
Plenty of dwellings all the way, on both banks#x2014;standing <lb/>
so close together, for long distances, that the broad river <lb/>
<pb n="420" entity="DSSR_000002932_0423"/>
lying between the two rows, becomes <lb/>
a sort of spacious street. A most <lb/>
home-like and happy-looking region. <lb/>
And now and then you see a <reg orig="pil-|lared">pillared</reg> <lb/>
and porticoed great manor-house, <lb/>
embowered in trees. Here is <reg orig="testi-|mony">testimony</reg> <lb/>
of one or two of the procession <lb/>
of foreign tourists that filed along <lb/>
here half a century ago. Mrs. <reg orig="Trol-|lope">Trollope</reg> <lb/>
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The unbroken flatness of the banks of <lb/>
the Mississippi continued unvaried for many <lb/>
miles above New Orleans; but the <reg orig="grace-|ful">graceful</reg> <lb/>
and luxuriant palmetto, the dark and <lb/>
noble ilex, and the bright orange, were <lb/>
everywhere to be seen, and it was many <lb/>
days before we were weary of looking at <lb/>
them."</p>
<figure id="f229" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0423">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">the graceful palmetto.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Captain Basil Hall:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The district of country which lies <reg orig="ad-|jacent">adjacent</reg> <lb/>
to the Mississippi, in the lower parts <lb/>
of Louisiana, is everywhere thickly <reg orig="peo-|pled">peopled</reg> <lb/>
by sugar planters, whose showy <lb/>
houses, gay piazzas, trig gardens, and <lb/>
numerous slave-villages, all clean and neat, gave an exceedingly <lb/>
thriving air to the river scenery."</p>
<pb n="421" entity="DSSR_000002932_0424"/>
<p>All the procession paint the attractive picture in the same <lb/>
way. The descriptions of fifty years ago do not need to <lb/>
have a word changed in order to exactly describe the same <lb/>
region as it appears to-day&mdash;except as to the "trigness" of <lb/>
the houses. The whitewash is gone from the negro cabins <lb/>
now; and many, possibly most, of the big mansions, once so <lb/>
shining white, have worn out their paint and have a decayed, <lb/>
neglected look. It is the blight of the war. Twenty-one <lb/>
years ago everything was trim and trig and bright along <lb/>
the "coast," just as it had been in 1827, as described by <lb/>
those tourists.</p>
<p>Unfortunate tourists! People humbugged them with <reg orig="stu-|pid">stupid</reg> <lb/>
and silly lies, and then laughed at them for believing <lb/>
and printing the same. They told Mrs. Trollope that the <lb/>
alligators&mdash;or crocodiles, as she calls them&mdash;were terrible <lb/>
creatures; and backed up the statement with a blood-<reg orig="cur-|dling">curdling</reg> <lb/>
account of how one of these slandered reptiles crept <lb/>
into a squatter cabin one night, and ate up a woman and <lb/>
five children. The woman, by herself, would have satisfied <lb/>
any ordinarily-impossible alligator; but no, these liars must <lb/>
make him gorge the five children besides. One would not <lb/>
imagine that jokers of this robust breed would be sensitive <lb/>
&mdash;but they were. It is difficult, at this day, to understand, <lb/>
and impossible to justify, the reception which the book of <lb/>
the grave, honest, intelligent, gentle, manly, charitable, <reg orig="well-|meaning">well-meaning</reg> <lb/>
Capt. Basil Hall got. Mrs. Trollope's account of it <lb/>
may perhaps entertain the reader; therefore I have put it <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> approaches to New Orleans were familiar; general <lb/>
aspects were unchanged. When one goes flying <lb/>
through London along a railway propped in the air on tall <lb/>
arches, he may inspect miles of upper bedrooms through <lb/>
the open windows, but the lower half of the houses is under <lb/>
<pb n="423" entity="DSSR_000002932_0426"/>
his level and out of sight. Similarly, in high-river stage, <lb/>
in the New Orleans region, the water is up to the top of the <lb/>
enclosing levee-rim, the flat country behind it lies low&mdash; <lb/>
representing the bottom of a dish&mdash;and as the boat swims <lb/>
along, high on the flood, one looks down upon the houses <lb/>
and into the upper windows. There is nothing but that <lb/>
frail breastwork of earth between the people and <reg orig="destruc-|tion">destruction</reg>.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">the wharves.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>The old brick salt-warehouses clustered at the upper end <lb/>
of the city looked as they had always looked; warehouses <lb/>
which had had a kind of Aladdin's lamp experience, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
since I had seen them; for when the war broke out <lb/>
the proprietor went to bed one night leaving them packed <lb/>
with thousands of sacks of vulgar salt, worth a couple of <lb/>
dollars a sack, and got up in the morning and found his <lb/>
mountain of salt turned into a mountain of gold, so to speak, <lb/>
<pb n="424" entity="DSSR_000002932_0427"/>
so suddenly and to so dizzy a height had the war news sent <lb/>
up the price of the article.</p>
<p>The vast reach of plank wharves remained unchanged, <lb/>
and there were as many ships as ever: but the long array <lb/>
of steamboats had vanished; not altogether, of course, but <lb/>
not much of it was left.</p>
<p>The city itself had not changed&mdash;to the eye. It had <lb/>
greatly increased in spread and population, but the look of <lb/>
the town was not altered. The dust, waste-paper-littered, <lb/>
was still deep in the streets; the deep, trough-like gutters <lb/>
alongside the curb-stones were still half full of reposeful <lb/>
water with a dusty surface; the sidewalks were still&mdash;in <lb/>
the sugar and bacon region&mdash;incumbered by casks and <reg orig="bar-|rels">barrels</reg> <lb/>
and hogsheads; the great blocks of austerely plain <reg orig="com-|mercial">commercial</reg> <lb/>
houses were as dusty-looking as ever.</p>
<p>Canal Street was finer, and more attractive and stirring <lb/>
than formerly, with its drifting crowds of people, its several <lb/>
processions of hurrying street-cars, and&mdash;toward evening&mdash; <lb/>
its broad second-story verandas crowded with gentlemen and <lb/>
ladies clothed according to the latest mode.</p>
<p>Not that there is any "architecture" in Canal Street: to <lb/>
speak in broad, general terms, there is no architecture in <lb/>
New Orleans, except in the cemeteries. It seems a strange <lb/>
thing to say of a wealthy, far-seeing, and energetic city of a <lb/>
quarter of a million inhabitants, but it is true. There is a <lb/>
huge granite U. S. Custom-house&mdash;costly enough, genuine <lb/>
enough, but as a decoration it is inferior to a gasometer. It <lb/>
looks like a state prison. But it was built before the war. <lb/>
Architecture in America may be said to have been born since <lb/>
the war. New Orleans, I believe, has had the good luck&mdash; <lb/>
and in a sense the bad luck&mdash;to have had no great fire in <lb/>
late years. It must be so. If the opposite had been the case, <lb/>
I think one would be able to tell the "burnt district" by the <lb/>
radical improvement in its architecture over the old forms. <lb/>
One can do this in Boston and Chicago. The "burnt <reg orig="dis-|trict">district</reg>" <lb/>
of Boston was commonplace before the fire; but now</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002932_0429"/>
<pb n="427" entity="DSSR_000002932_0430"/>
<p>there is no commercial district in any city in the world that <lb/>
can surpass it&mdash;or perhaps even rival it&mdash;in beauty, <reg orig="ele-|gance">elegance</reg>, <lb/>
and tastefulness.</p>
<p>However, New Orleans has begun&mdash;just this moment, as <lb/>
one may say. When completed, the new Cotton Exchange <lb/>
will be a stately and beautiful building; massive, substantial, <lb/>
full of architectural graces; no shams or false pretences or <lb/>
uglinesses about it anywhere. To the city, it will be worth <lb/>
many times its cost, for it will breed its species. What <lb/>
has been lacking hitherto, was a model to build toward; <lb/>
something to educate eye and taste; a <hi rend="italic">suggester,</hi> so to speak.</p>
<p>The city is well outfitted with progressive men&mdash;thinking, <lb/>
sagacious, long-headed men. The contrast between the spirit <lb/>
of the city and the city's architecture is like the contrast <lb/>
between waking and sleep. Apparently there is a "boom" <lb/>
in everything but that one dead feature. The water in the <lb/>
gutters used to be stagnant and slimy, and a potent <reg orig="disease-|breeder">disease-breeder</reg>; <lb/>
but the gutters are flushed now, two or three times <lb/>
a day, by powerful machinery; in many of the gutters the <lb/>
water never stands still, but has a steady current. Other <reg orig="san-|itary">sanitary</reg> <lb/>
improvements have been made; and with such effect <lb/>
that New Orleans claims to be (during the long intervals <lb/>
between the occasional yellow-fever assaults) one of the <lb/>
healthiest cities in the Union. There's plenty of ice now <lb/>
for everybody, manufactured in the town. It is a driving <lb/>
place commercially, and has a great river, ocean, and <reg orig="rail-|way">railway</reg> <lb/>
business. At the date of our visit, it was the best lighted <lb/>
city in the Union, electrically speaking. The New Orleans <lb/>
electric lights were more numerous than those of New York, <lb/>
and very much better. One had this modified noonday not <lb/>
only in Canal and some neighboring chief streets, but all <lb/>
along a stretch of five miles of river frontage. There are <lb/>
good clubs in the city now&mdash;several of them but recently <lb/>
organized&mdash;and inviting modern-style pleasure resorts at <lb/>
West End and Spanish Fort. The telephone is everywhere. <lb/>
One of the most notable advances is in journalism. The <lb/>
<pb n="428" entity="DSSR_000002932_0431"/>
newspapers, as I remember them, were not a striking feature. <lb/>
Now they are. Money is spent upon them with a free hand. <lb/>
They get the news, let it cost what it may. The editorial <lb/>
work is not <reg orig="hack-|grinding">hack-grinding</reg>, <lb/>
but <reg orig="lit-|erature">literature</reg>. <lb/>
As an <lb/>
example of New <lb/>
Orleans journalistic achievement, it may be mentioned that <lb/>
the "Times-Democrat" of August 26, 1882, contained a <lb/>
report of the year's business of the towns of the Mississippi <lb/>
Valley, from New Orleans all the way to St. Paul&mdash;two <lb/>
thousand miles. That issue of the paper consisted of <hi rend="italic">forty</hi> <lb/>
pages; seven columns to the page; two hundred and eighty <lb/>
columns in all; fifteen hundred words to the column; an <lb/>
aggregate of four hundred and twenty thousand words. That <lb/>
is to say, not much short of three times as many words as <lb/>
there are in this book. One may with sorrow contrast this <lb/>
with the architecture of New Orleans.</p>

stretching into the distance on every hand, the phrase "city <lb/>
of the dead" has all at once a meaning to him. Many of the <lb/>
cemeteries are beautiful, and are kept in perfect order. <lb/>
When one goes from the levee or the business streets near <lb/>
it, to a cemetery, he observes to himself that if those people <lb/>
down there would live as neatly while they are alive as they <lb/>
do after they are dead, they would find many advantages <lb/>
in it; and besides, their quarter would be the wonder and <lb/>
admiration of the business world. Fresh flowers, in vases of <lb/>
water, are to be seen at the portals of many of the vaults: <lb/>
placed there by the pious hands of bereaved parents and <lb/>
children, husbands and wives, and renewed daily. A milder <lb/>
form of sorrow finds its inexpensive and lasting remembrancer <lb/>
in the coarse and ugly but indestructible "immortelle"&mdash; <lb/>
which is a wreath or cross or some such emblem, made of <lb/>
rosettes of black linen, with sometimes a yellow rosette at the <lb/>
conjunction of the cross's bars,&mdash;kind of sorrowful <reg orig="breast-|pin">breastpin</reg>, <lb/>
so to say. The immortelle requires no attention: you <lb/>
just hang it up, and there you are; just leave it alone, it will</p>

<p>On sunny days, pretty little chameleons&mdash;gracefullest of <lb/>
legg&eacute;d reptiles&mdash;creep along the marble fronts of the vaults, <lb/>
and catch flies. Their changes of <lb/>

<p>I will gradually drop this subject <lb/>
of graveyards. I have been trying <lb/>
all I could to get down to the <reg orig="senti-|mental">sentimental</reg> <lb/>
part of it, but I cannot <lb/>
accomplish it. I think <lb/>
there is no genuinely <lb/>
sentimental part <lb/>
to it. It is <lb/>
all <reg orig="gro-|tesque">grotesque</reg>, <lb/>
<lb/>
ghastly, horrible. <lb/>
Graveyards may <lb/>
have been <reg orig="justi-|fiable">justifiable</reg> <lb/>
in the <reg orig="by-|gone">bygone</reg> <lb/>
ages, when <lb/>
nobody knew that <lb/>
for every dead body put into the ground, to glut the earth <lb/>
and the plant-roots and the air with disease-germs, five or <lb/>
fifty, or maybe a hundred, persons must die before their <lb/>
proper time; but they are hardly justifiable now, when <lb/>
even the children know that a dead saint enters upon <lb/>
a century-long career of assassination the moment the <lb/>
<pb n="433" entity="DSSR_000002932_0436"/>
earth closes over his corpse. It is a grim sort of a thought. <lb/>
The relics of St. Anne, up in Canada, have now, after <lb/>
nineteen hundred years, gone to curing the sick by the <lb/>
dozen. But it is merest matter-of-course that these same <lb/>
relics, within a generation after St. Anne's death and burial, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">made</hi> several thousand people sick. Therefore these <reg orig="miracle-|performances">miracle-performances</reg> <lb/>
are simply compensation, nothing more. St. <lb/>
Anne is somewhat slow pay, for a Saint, it is true; but better <lb/>
a debt paid after nineteen hundred years, and outlawed by <lb/>
the statute of limitations, than not paid at all; and most of <lb/>
the knights of the halo do not pay at all. Where you <lb/>
find one that pays&mdash;like St. Anne&mdash;you find a hundred and <lb/>
fifty that take the benefit of the statute. And none of them <lb/>
pay any more than the principal of what they owe&mdash;they <lb/>
pay none of the interest either simple or compound. A <lb/>
Saint can never <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> return the principal, however; for his <lb/>
dead body <hi rend="italic">kills</hi> people, whereas his relics <hi rend="italic">heal</hi> only&mdash;they <lb/>
never restore the dead to life. That part of the account is <lb/>
always left unsettled.</p>
<p>"Dr. F. Julius Le Moyne, after fifty years of medical practice, <lb/>
wrote: 'The inhumation of human bodies, dead from infectious <lb/>
diseases, results in constantly loading the atmosphere, and polluting <lb/>
the waters, with not only the germs that rise from simply <reg orig="putrefac-|tion">putrefaction</reg>, <lb/>
but also with the <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> germs of the diseases from which <lb/>
death resulted.'</p>
<p>"The gases (from buried corpses) will rise to the surface through <lb/>
eight or ten feet of gravel, just as coal-gas will do, and there is <lb/>
practically no limit to their power of escape.</p>
<p>"During the epidemic in New Orleans in 1853, Dr. E. H. Barton <lb/>
reported that in the Fourth District the mortality was four hundred <lb/>
and fifty-two per thousand&mdash;more than double that of any other. <lb/>
In this district were three large cemeteries, in which during the <lb/>
previous year more than three thousand bodies had been buried. <lb/>
In other districts the proximity of cemeteries seemed to aggravate <lb/>
the disease.</p>
<p>"In 1828 Professor Bianchi demonstrated how the fearful <reg orig="reap-|pearance">reappearance</reg> <lb/>

<reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
the <lb/>
Chicago <lb/>
Medical <lb/>
Society, <lb/>
in advocacy <lb/>
of cremation, <lb/>
Dr. Charles W. <lb/>
Purdy made some <lb/>
striking comparisons <lb/>
to show what a burden is laid <lb/>
upon society by the burial of <lb/>
the dead:&mdash;</p>
<p>"One and one-fourth times more money is <lb/>
expended annually in funerals in the United <lb/>
States than the Government expends for public-school purposes. <lb/>
Funerals cost this country in 1880 enough money to pay the <reg orig="liabil-|ities">liabilities</reg> <lb/>
of all the commercial failures in the United States during the <lb/>
same year, and give each bankrupt a capital of $8,630 with which <lb/>
to resume business. Funerals cost annually more money than the <lb/>
value of the combined gold and silver yield of the United States <lb/>
in the year 1880! These figures do not include the sums invested <lb/>
in burial-grounds and expended in tombs and monuments, nor the <lb/>
loss from depreciation of property in the vicinity of cemeteries."</p>
<pb n="435" entity="DSSR_000002932_0438"/>
<p>For the rich, cremation would answer as well as burial; <lb/>
for the ceremonies connected with it could be made as costly <lb/>
and ostentatious as a Hindoo <hi rend="italic">suttee;</hi> while for the poor, <lb/>
cremation would be better than burial, because so cheap<ref target="n21" n="21"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
<note id="n21" place="foot" n="21"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>Four or five dollars is the minimum cost.</p></note>
&mdash; <lb/>
so cheap until the poor got to imitating the rich, which <lb/>
they would do by and by. The adoption of cremation would <lb/>
relieve us of a muck of threadbare burial-witticisms; but, on <lb/>
the other hand, it would resurrect a lot of mildewed old <lb/>
cremation-jokes that have had a rest for two thousand years.</p>
<p>I have a colored acquaintance who earns his living by odd <lb/>
jobs and heavy manual labor. He never earns above four <lb/>
hundred dollars in a year, and as he has a wife and several <lb/>
young children, the closest scrimping is necessary to get <lb/>
him through to the end of the twelve months debtless. To <lb/>
such a man a funeral is a colossal financial disaster. While <lb/>
I was writing one of the preceding chapters, this man lost <lb/>
a little child. He walked the town over with a friend, trying <lb/>
to find a coffin that was within his means. He bought the <lb/>
very cheapest one he could find, plain wood, stained. It cost <lb/>
him <hi rend="italic">twenty-six dollars.</hi> It would have cost less than four, <lb/>
probably, if it had been built to put something useful into. <lb/>
He and his family will feel that outlay a good many <lb/>
months.</p>

<p>With the above brief references to inhumation, let us leave <lb/>

Spanish part&mdash;bears no resemblance to the American <lb/>
end of the city: the American end which lies beyond the <lb/>
intervening brick business-centre. The houses are massed <lb/>
in blocks; are austerely plain and dignified; uniform of <lb/>
pattern, with here and there a departure from it with <reg orig="pleas-|ant">pleasant</reg> <lb/>
effect; all are plastered on the outside, and nearly all <lb/>
have long, iron-railed verandas running along the several <lb/>
stories. Their chief beauty is the deep, warm, varicolored <lb/>
stain with which time and the weather have enriched the <lb/>
plaster. It harmonizes with all the surroundings, and has <lb/>
as natural a look of belonging there as has the flush upon <lb/>
sunset clouds. This charming decoration cannot be <reg orig="suc-|cessfully">successfully</reg> <lb/>
imitated; neither is it to be found elsewhere in <lb/>
America.</p>
<p>The iron railings are a specialty, also. The pattern is <lb/>
often exceedingly light and dainty, and airy and graceful <lb/>
&mdash;with a large cipher or monogram in the centre, a delicate <lb/>
cobweb of baffling, intricate forms, wrought in steel. The <lb/>

vivid pleasure. And you have a vivid <hi rend="italic">sense</hi> as of unseen or <lb/>
dimly seen things&mdash;vivid, and yet fitful and darkling; you <lb/>
glimpse salient features, but lose the fine shades or catch <lb/>
them imperfectly through the vision of the imagination: a <lb/>
case, as it were, of ignorant near-sighted stranger traversing <lb/>
<pb n="444" entity="DSSR_000002932_0447"/>
the rim of wide vague horizons of Alps with an inspired and <lb/>
enlightened long-sighted native.</p>
<p>We visited the old St. Louis Hotel, now occupied by <reg orig="muni-|cipal">municipal</reg> <lb/>
offices. There is nothing strikingly remarkable about <lb/>
it; but one can say of it as of the Academy of Music in New <lb/>
York, that if a broom or a shovel has ever been used in it <lb/>
there is no circumstantial evidence to back up the fact. It <lb/>
it curious that cabbages and hay and things do not grow in <lb/>
the Academy of Music; but no doubt it is on account of the <lb/>
interruption of the light by the benches, and the <reg orig="impossi-|bility">impossibility</reg> <lb/>
of hoeing the crop except in the aisles. The fact that <lb/>
the ushers grow their buttonhole-bouquets on the premises <lb/>
shows what might be done if they had the right kind of an <lb/>
agricultural head to the establishment.</p>
<p>We visited also the venerable Cathedral, and the pretty <lb/>
square in front of it; the one dim with religious light, the <lb/>
other brilliant with the worldly sort, and lovely with orange <lb/>
trees and blossomy shrubs; then we drove in the hot sun <lb/>
through the wilderness of houses and out on to the wide <lb/>
dead level beyond, where the villas are, and the water wheels <lb/>
to drain the town, and the commons populous with cows and <lb/>
children; passing by an old cemetery where we were told lie <lb/>
the ashes of an early pirate; but we took him on trust, and <lb/>
did not visit him. He was a pirate with a tremendous and <lb/>
sanguinary history; and as long as he preserved unspotted, <lb/>
in retirement, the dignity of his name and the grandeur of <lb/>
his ancient calling, homage and reverence were his from <lb/>
high and low; but when at last he descended into politics <lb/>
and became a paltry alderman, the public "shook" him, and <lb/>
turned aside and wept. When he died, they set up a <reg orig="monu-|ment">monument</reg> <lb/>
over him; and little by little he has come into respect <lb/>
again; but it is respect for the pirate, not the alderman, <lb/>
To-day the loyal and generous remember only what he was, <lb/>
and charitably forget what he became.</p>
<p>Thence, we drove a few miles across a swamp, along a <lb/>
raised shell road, with a canal on one hand and a dense <lb/>
<pb n="445" entity="DSSR_000002932_0448"/>
wood on the other; and here and there, in the distance, a <lb/>
ragged and angular-limbed and moss-bearded cypress, top <lb/>
standing out, clear cut against the sky, and as quaint of <lb/>
form as the apple-trees in Japanese pictures&mdash;such was our <lb/>
course and the surroundings of it. There was an occasional <lb/>
alligator swimming comfortably along in the canal, and an <lb/>
occasional picturesque colored person on the bank, flinging <lb/>
his statue-rigid reflection upon the still water and watching <lb/>
for a bite.</p>

</figure>
<p>And by and by we reached the West End, a collection of <lb/>
hotels of the usual light summer-resort pattern, with broad <lb/>
verandas all around, and the waves of the wide and blue <lb/>
Lake Pontchartrain lapping the thresholds. We had dinner <lb/>
on a ground-veranda over the water&mdash;the chief dish the <lb/>
renowned fish called the pompano, delicious as the less <lb/>
criminal forms of sin.</p>
<p>Thousands of people come by rail and carriage to West <lb/>
End and to Spanish Fort every evening, and dine, listen to <lb/>
<pb n="446" entity="DSSR_000002932_0449"/>
the bands, take strolls in the open air under the electric <lb/>
lights, go sailing on the lake, and entertain themselves in <lb/>
various and sundry other ways.</p>
<p>We had opportunities on other days and in other places <lb/>
to test the pompano. Notably, at an editorial dinner at one <lb/>
of the clubs in the city. He was in his last possible <reg orig="per-|fection">perfection</reg> <lb/>
there, and justified his fame. In his suite was a <lb/>
tall pyramid of scarlet cray-fish&mdash;large ones; as large as <lb/>
one's thumb; delicate, palatable, appetizing. Also devilled <lb/>
whitebait; also shrimps of choice quality; and a platter of <lb/>
small soft-shell crabs of a most superior breed. The other <lb/>
dishes were what one might get at Delmonico's, or <reg orig="Bucking-|ham">Buckingham</reg> <lb/>
Palace; those I have spoken of can be had in similar <lb/>
perfection in New Orleans only, I suppose.</p>

<p>In the West and South they have a new institution,&mdash;the <lb/>
Broom Brigade. It is composed of young ladies who dress <lb/>
in a uniform costume, and go through the infantry drill, with <lb/>
broom in place of musket. It is a very pretty sight, on <reg orig="pri-|vate">private</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="447" entity="DSSR_000002932_0450"/>
view. When they perform on the stage of a theatre, in <lb/>
the blaze of colored fires, it must be a fine and fascinating <lb/>
spectacle. I saw them go through their complex manual <lb/>
with grace, spirit, and admirable precision. I saw them do <lb/>
everything which a human being can possibly do with a <lb/>
broom, except sweep. I did not see them sweep. But I <lb/>
know they could learn. What they have already learned <lb/>
proves that. And if they ever should learn, and should go <lb/>
on the war-path down Tchoupitoulas or some of those other <lb/>
streets around there, those thoroughfares would bear a <lb/>
greatly improved aspect in a very few minutes. But the</p>

<p>girls themselves would n't; so nothing would be really <lb/>
gained, after all.</p>
<p>The drill was in the Washington Artillery building. In <lb/>
this building we saw many interesting relics of the war. <lb/>
Also a fine oil-painting representing Stonewall Jackson's <lb/>
last interview with General Lee. Both men are on <reg orig="horse-|back">horseback</reg>. <lb/>
Jackson has just ridden up, and is accosting Lee. <lb/>
The picture is very valuable, on account of the portraits, <lb/>
which are authentic. But, like many another historical <lb/>
picture, it means nothing without its label. And one label <lb/>
will fit it as well as another:&mdash;</p>
<p>First Interview between Lee and Jackson.</p>
<p>Last Interview between Lee and Jackson.</p>
<p>Jackson Introducing Himself to Lee.</p>
<p>Jackson Accepting Lee's Invitation to Dinner.</p>
<p>Jackson Declining Lee's Invitation to Dinner&mdash;with <lb/>
Thanks.</p>
<p>Jackson Apologizing for a Heavy Defeat.</p>
<p>Jackson Reporting a Great Victory.</p>
<p>Jackson Asking Lee for a Match.</p>
<p>It tells <hi rend="italic">one</hi> story, and a sufficient one; for it says quite <lb/>
plainly and satisfactorily, "Here are Lee and Jackson <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg>." <lb/>
The artist would have made it tell that this is <lb/>
Lee and Jackson's last interview if he could have done it. <lb/>
But he could n't, for there was n't any way to do it. A good <lb/>
legible label is usually worth, for information, a ton of <reg orig="sig-|nificant">significant</reg> <lb/>
attitude and expression in a historical picture. In <lb/>
Rome, people with fine sympathetic natures stand up and <lb/>
weep in front of the celebrated "Beatrice Cenci the Day <lb/>
before her Execution." It shows what a label can do. If <lb/>
they did not know the picture, they would inspect it <reg orig="un-|moved">unmoved</reg>, <lb/>
and say, "Young girl with hay fever; young girl <lb/>
with her head in a bag."</p>
<p>I found the half-forgotten Southern intonations and elisions <lb/>
as pleasing to my ear as they had formerly been. A <reg orig="South-|erner">Southerner</reg> <lb/>
talks music. At least it is music to me, but then I <lb/>
<pb n="449" entity="DSSR_000002932_0452"/>
was born in the South. The educated Southerner has no <lb/>
use for an <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> except at the beginning of a word. He says <lb/>
"honah," and "dinnah," and "Gove'nuh," and "befo' the <lb/>
waw," and so on. The words may lack charm to the eye, in <lb/>
print, but they have it to the ear. When did the <hi rend="italic">r</hi> disappear <lb/>
from Southern speech, and how <lb/>
did it come to disappear? The <lb/>
custom of dropping it was not <lb/>
borrowed from the North, nor <lb/>
inherited from England. Many <lb/>
Southerners&mdash;most <reg orig="Southern-|ers&mdash;put">Southerners&mdash;put</reg> <lb/>
a <hi rend="italic">y</hi> into occasional <lb/>
words that begin with the <hi rend="italic">k</hi> <lb/>
sound. For instance, they say <lb/>
Mr. K'yahtah (Carter) and <lb/>
speak of playing k'yahds or of <lb/>
riding in the k'yahs. And they <lb/>
have the pleasant custom&mdash;long <lb/>
ago fallen into decay in the <lb/>
North&mdash;of frequently <reg orig="employ-|ing">employing</reg> <lb/>
the respectful "Sir." <reg orig="In-|stead">Instead</reg> <lb/>
of the curt Yes, and the <lb/>
abrupt No, they say "Yes, <lb/>
Suh"; "No, Suh."</p>
<figure id="f248" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0452">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"whah you was?"</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>But there are some <reg orig="infelici-|ties">infelicities</reg>. <lb/>
Such as "like" for "as," <lb/>
and the addition of an "at" <lb/>
where it is n't needed. I heard <lb/>
an educated gentleman say, "Like the flag-officer did." His <lb/>
cook or his butler would have said, "Like the flag-officer <lb/>
done." You hear gentlemen say, "Where have you been <lb/>
at?" And here is the aggravated form&mdash;heard a ragged <lb/>
street Arab say it to a comrade: "I was a-ask'n' Tom whah <lb/>
you was a-sett'n' at." The very elect carelessly say "will" <lb/>
when they mean "shall"; and many of them say, "I did n't <lb/>
go to do it," meaning "I did n't mean to do it." The <reg orig="North-|ern">Northern</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="450" entity="DSSR_000002932_0453"/>
word "guess"&mdash;imported from England, where it used <lb/>
to be common, and now regarded by satirical Englishmen as <lb/>
a Yankee original&mdash;is but little used among Southerners. <lb/>
They say "reckon." They have n't any "does n't" in their <lb/>
language; they say "don't" instead. The unpolished often <lb/>
use "went" for "gone." It is nearly as bad as the Northern <lb/>
"had n't ought." This reminds me that a remark of a very <lb/>
peculiar nature was made here in my neighborhood (in the <lb/>
North) a few days ago: "He had n't ought to have went." <lb/>
How is that? Is n't that a good deal of a triumph? One <lb/>
knows the orders combined in this half-breed's architecture <lb/>
without inquiring: one parent Northern, the other Southern. <lb/>
To-day I heard a school-mistress ask, "Where is John gone?" <lb/>
This form is so common&mdash;so nearly universal, in fact&mdash;that <lb/>
if she had used "whither" instead of "where," I think it <lb/>
would have sounded like an affectation.</p>
<p>We picked up one excellent word&mdash;a word worth <reg orig="travel-|ling">travelling</reg> <lb/>
to New Orleans to get; a nice limber, expressive, handy <lb/>
word&mdash;"Lagniappe." They pronounce it lanny-<hi rend="italic">yap.</hi> It is <lb/>
Spanish&mdash;so they said. We discovered it at the head of a <lb/>
column of odds and ends in the Picayune, the first day; <lb/>
heard twenty people use it the second; inquired what it <lb/>
meant the third; adopted it and got facility in swinging it <lb/>
the fourth. It has a restricted meaning, but I think the <lb/>
people spread it out a little when they choose. It is the <lb/>
equivalent of the thirteenth roll in a "baker's dozen." It <lb/>
is something thrown in, gratis, for good measure. The <lb/>
custom originated in the Spanish quarter of the city. When <lb/>
a child or a servant buys something in a shop&mdash;or even the <lb/>
mayor or the governor, for aught I know&mdash;he finishes the <lb/>
operation by saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Give me something for lagniappe."</p>
<p>The shopman always responds; gives the child a bit of <lb/>
liquorice-root, gives the servant a cheap cigar or a spool of <lb/>
thread, gives the governor&mdash;I don't know what he gives the <lb/>
governor; support, likely.</p>

<p>When you are invited to drink,&mdash;and this does occur now <lb/>
and then in New Orleans,&mdash;and you say, "What, again?&mdash; <lb/>
no, I've had enough;" the other party says, "But just this <lb/>
one time more,&mdash;this is for lagniappe." When the beau <lb/>
perceives that he is stacking his compliments a trifle too <lb/>
high, and sees by the young lady's countenance that the <lb/>
edifice would have been better with the top compliment left <lb/>
off, he puts his "I beg pardon,&mdash;no harm intended," into the <lb/>
briefer form of "Oh, that's for lagniappe." If the waiter in <lb/>
the restaurant stumbles and spills a gill of coffee down the <lb/>
back of your neck, he says, "For lagniappe, sah," and gets <lb/>
you another cup without extra charge.</p>

<head>SOUTHERN SPORTS.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the North one hears the war mentioned, in social <reg orig="conver-|sation">conversation</reg>, <lb/>
once a month; sometimes as often as once a week; <lb/>
but as a distinct subject for talk, it has long ago been relieved <lb/>
of duty. There are sufficient reasons for this. Given a dinner <lb/>
company of six gentlemen to-day, it can easily happen that <lb/>
four of them&mdash;and possibly five&mdash;were not in the field at <lb/>
all. So the chances are four to two, or five to one, that the <lb/>
war will at no time during the evening become the topic of <lb/>
conversation; and the chances are still greater that if it <reg orig="be-|come">become</reg> <lb/>
the topic it will remain so but a little while. If you <lb/>
add six ladies to the company, you have added six people <lb/>
who saw so little of the dread realities of the war that they <lb/>
ran out of talk concerning them years ago, and now would <lb/>
soon weary of the war topic if you brought it up.</p>
<p>The case is very different in the South. There, every man <lb/>
you meet was in the war; and every lady you meet saw the <lb/>
war. The war is the great chief topic of conversation. The <lb/>
interest in it is vivid and constant; the interest in other topics <lb/>
is fleeting. Mention of the war will wake up a dull <reg orig="com-|pany">company</reg> <lb/>
and set their tongues going, when nearly any other <lb/>
topic would fail. In the South, the war is what A.D. is <reg orig="else-|where">elsewhere</reg>: <lb/>
they date from it. All day long you hear things <lb/>
"placed" as having happened since the waw; or du'in' the <lb/>
waw; or befo' the waw; or right aftah the waw; or 'bout <lb/>
two yeahs or five yeahs or ten yeahs befo' the waw or aftah <lb/>
the waw. It shows how intimately every individual was <lb/>
visited, in his own person, by that tremendous episode. It <lb/>
<pb n="455" entity="DSSR_000002932_0458"/>
gives the inexperienced stranger a better idea of what a vast <lb/>
and comprehensive calamity invasion is than he can ever get <lb/>
by reading books at the fireside.</p>
<p>At a club one evening, a gentleman turned to me and said, <lb/>
in an aside:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You notice, of course, that we are nearly always talking <lb/>
about the war. It is n't because we have n't anything else to <lb/>
talk about, but because <lb/>
nothing else has so strong <lb/>
an interest for us. And <lb/>
there is another reason: <lb/>
In the war, each of us, in <lb/>
his own person, seems to <lb/>
have sampled all the <reg orig="dif-|ferent">different</reg> <lb/>
varieties of human <lb/>
experience; as a <reg orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg>, <lb/>
you can't mention <lb/>
an outside matter of any <lb/>
sort but it will certainly <lb/>
remind some listener of <lb/>
something that happened <lb/>
during the war,&mdash;and out <lb/>
he comes with it. Of <lb/>
course that brings the talk <lb/>
back to the war. You <lb/>
may try all you want to, to <lb/>
keep other subjects before <lb/>
the house, and we may all <lb/>
join in and help, but there <lb/>
can be but one result: the <lb/>
most random topic would <lb/>
load every man up with war <lb/>
reminiscences, and <hi rend="italic">shut</hi> him up, too; and talk would be likely <lb/>
to stop presently, because you can't talk pale <reg orig="inconsequentiali-|ties">inconsequentialities</reg> <lb/>
when you've got a crimson fact or fancy in your head <lb/>
that you are burning to fetch out."</p>

<pb n="456" entity="DSSR_000002932_0459"/>
<p>The poet was sitting some little distance away; and <reg orig="pres-|ently">presently</reg> <lb/>
he began to speak&mdash;about the moon.</p>
<p>The gentleman who had been talking to me remarked in <lb/>
an "aside:" "There, the moon is far enough from the seat <lb/>
of war, but you will see that it will suggest something to <lb/>
somebody about the war; in ten minutes from now the <lb/>
moon, as a topic, will be shelved."</p>
<p>The poet was saying he had noticed something which was <lb/>
a surprise to him; had had the impression that down here, <lb/>
toward the equator, the moonlight was much stronger and <lb/>
brighter than up North; had had the impression that when <lb/>
he visited New Orleans, many years ago, the moon&mdash;</p>
<p>Interruption from the other end of the room:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Let me explain that. Reminds me of an anecdote. <reg orig="Every-|thing">Everything</reg> <lb/>
is changed since the war, for better or for worse; but <lb/>
you'll find people down here born grumblers, who see no <lb/>
change except the change for the worse. There was an old <lb/>
negro woman of this sort. A young New-Yorker said in her <lb/>
presence, 'What a wonderful moon you have down here!' <lb/>
She sighed and said, 'Ah, bless yo' heart, honey, you ought <lb/>
to seen dat moon befo' de waw!'"</p>
<p>The new topic was dead already. But the poet resurrected <lb/>
it, and gave it a new start.</p>
<p>A brief dispute followed, as to whether the difference <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
Northern and Southern moonlight really existed or was <lb/>
only imagined. Moonlight talk drifted easily into talk about <lb/>
artificial methods of dispelling darkness. Then somebody <lb/>
remembered that when Farragut advanced upon Port <reg orig="Hud-|son">Hudson</reg> <lb/>
on a dark night&mdash;and did not wish to assist the aim of <lb/>
the Confederate gunners&mdash;he carried no battle-lanterns, but <lb/>
painted the decks of his ships white, and thus created a <lb/>
dim but valuable light, which enabled his own men to <lb/>
grope their way around with considerable facility. At this <lb/>
point the war got the floor again&mdash;the ten minutes not quite <lb/>
up yet.</p>
<p>I was not sorry, for war talk by men who have been in a <lb/>
<pb n="457" entity="DSSR_000002932_0460"/>
war is always interesting; <reg orig="where-|as">whereas</reg> <lb/>
moon talk by a poet who has <lb/>
not been in the moon is likely to <lb/>
be dull.</p>
<figure id="f252" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0460">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">cock pit.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>We went to a cockpit in New <lb/>
Orleans on a Saturday afternoon. <lb/>
I had never seen a cock-fight <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg>. <lb/>
There were men and boys <lb/>
there of all ages and all colors, and of many languages and <lb/>
nationalities. But I noticed one quite conspicuous and <reg orig="sur-|prising">surprising</reg> <lb/>
absence: the traditional brutal faces. There were no <lb/>
brutal faces. With no cock-fighting going on, you could have <lb/>
played the gathering on a stranger for a prayer-meeting; and <lb/>
after it began, for a revival,&mdash;provided you blindfolded your <lb/>
stranger,&mdash;for the shouting was something prodigious.</p>
<pb n="458" entity="DSSR_000002932_0461"/>
<p>A negro and a white man were in the ring; everybody <lb/>
else outside. The cocks were brought in in sacks; and when <lb/>
time was called, they were taken out by the two bottle-holders, <lb/>
stroked, caressed, poked toward each other, and finally <reg orig="lib-|erated">liberated</reg>. <lb/>
The big black cock plunged instantly at the little <lb/>
gray one and struck him on the head with his spur. The <lb/>
gray responded with spirit. Then the Babel of many-tongued <lb/>
shoutings broke out, and ceased not thenceforth. When <lb/>
the cocks had been fighting some little time, I was expecting <lb/>
them momently to drop dead, for both were blind, red with <lb/>
blood, and so exhausted that they frequently fell down. Yet <lb/>
they would not give up, neither would they die. The negro <lb/>
and the white man would pick them up every few seconds, <lb/>
wipe them off, blow cold water on them in a fine spray, and <lb/>
take their heads in their mouths and hold them there a <reg orig="mo-|ment&mdash;to">moment&mdash;to</reg> <lb/>
warm back the perishing life perhaps; I do not <lb/>
know. Then, being set down again, the dying creatures would <lb/>
totter gropingly about, with dragging wings, find each other, <lb/>
strike a guess-work blow or two, and fall exhausted once <lb/>
more.</p>
<p>I did not see the end of the battle. I forced myself to <reg orig="en-|dure">endure</reg> <lb/>
it as long as I could, but it was too pitiful a sight; so <lb/>
I made frank confession to that effect, and we retired. We <lb/>
heard afterward that the black cock died in the ring, and <lb/>
fighting to the last.</p>
<p>Evidently there is abundant fascination about this "sport" <lb/>
for such as have had a degree of familiarity with it. I never <lb/>
saw people enjoy anything more than this gathering enjoyed <lb/>
this fight. The case was the same with old gray-heads and <lb/>
with boys of ten. They lost themselves in frenzies of <lb/>
delight. The "cocking-main" is an inhuman sort of <reg orig="enter-|tainment">entertainment</reg>, <lb/>
there is no question about that; still, it seems a <lb/>
much more respectable and far less cruel sport than <reg orig="fox-|hunting&mdash;for">foxhunting&mdash;for</reg> <lb/>
the cocks like it; they experience, as well as <lb/>
confer enjoyment; which is not the fox's case.</p>
<p>We assisted&mdash;in the French sense&mdash;at a mule race, one <lb/>
<pb n="459" entity="DSSR_000002932_0462"/>
day. I believe I enjoyed this contest more than any other <lb/>
mule there. I enjoyed it more than I remember having <lb/>
enjoyed any other animal race I ever saw. The grand <lb/>
stand was well filled with the beauty and the chivalry of <lb/>
New Orleans. That phrase is not original with me. It is <lb/>
the Southern reporter's. He has used it for two generations. <lb/>
He uses it twenty times a day, or twenty thousand times a <lb/>
day; or a million times a day&mdash;according to the exigencies. <lb/>
He is obliged to use it a million times a day, if he have <lb/>
occasion to speak of respectable men and women that often; <lb/>
for he has no other phrase for such service except that <reg orig="sin-|gle">single</reg> <lb/>
one. He never tires of it; it always has a fine sound <lb/>
to him. There is a kind of swell medi&aelig;val bulliness and <lb/>
tinsel about it that pleases his gaudy barbaric soul. If he <lb/>
had been in Palestine in the early times, we should have <lb/>
had no references to "much people" out of him. No, he <lb/>
would have said "the beauty and the chivalry of Galilee" <lb/>
assembled to hear the Sermon on the Mount. It is likely <lb/>
that the men and women of the South are sick enough of <lb/>
that phrase by this time, and would like a change, but there <lb/>
is no immediate prospect of their getting it.</p>
<p>The New Orleans editor has a strong, compact, direct, <lb/>
unflowery style; wastes no words, and does not gush. Not <lb/>
so with his average correspondent. In the Appendix I <lb/>
have quoted a good letter, penned by a trained hand; but <lb/>
the average correspondent hurls a style which differs from <lb/>
that. For instance:&mdash;</p>
<p>The "Times-Democrat" sent a relief-steamer up one of <lb/>
the bayous, last April. This steamer landed at a village, <lb/>
up there somewhere, and the Captain invited some of the <lb/>
ladies of the village to make a short trip with him. They <lb/>
accepted and came aboard, and the steamboat shoved out <lb/>

and he would have got nothing else out of it. He would <lb/>
<pb n="460" entity="DSSR_000002932_0463"/>
probably have even tabulated them, partly to secure perfect <lb/>
clearness of statement, and partly to save space. But his <lb/>

<p>Twenty-two <lb/>
words to say the <lb/>
ladies came aboard <lb/>
and the boat shoved <lb/>
out up the creek, <lb/>
is a clean waste of <lb/>
ten good words, and <lb/>
is also destructive <lb/>
of compactness of <lb/>
statement.</p>
<p>The trouble with <lb/>
the Southern <reg orig="re-|porter">reporter</reg> <lb/>
is&mdash;Women. <lb/>
They unsettle him; they throw him off his balance. He is <lb/>
plain, and sensible, and satisfactory, until a woman heaves in <lb/>
sight. Then he goes all to pieces; his mind totters, he <lb/>
becomes flowery and idiotic. From reading the above <lb/>
extract, you would imagine that this student of Sir Walter <lb/>
<pb n="461" entity="DSSR_000002932_0464"/>
Scott is an apprentice, and knows next to nothing about <lb/>
handling a pen. On the contrary, he furnishes plenty of <lb/>
proofs, in his long letter, that he knows well enough how <lb/>
to handle it when the women are not around to give him <lb/>
the artificial-flower complaint. For instance:&mdash;</p>
<p>"At 4 o'clock ominous clouds began to gather in the southeast, <lb/>
and presently from the Gulf there came a blow which increased in <lb/>
severity every moment. It was not safe to leave the landing then, <lb/>
and there was a delay. The oaks shook off long tresses of their <lb/>
mossy beards to the tugging of the wind, and the bayou in its <reg orig="ambi-|tion">ambition</reg> <lb/>
put on miniature waves in mocking of much larger bodies of <lb/>
water. A lull permitted a start, and homewards we steamed, an inky <lb/>
sky overhead and a heavy wind blowing. As darkness crept on, there <lb/>
were few on board who did not wish themselves nearer home."</p>
<p>There is nothing the matter with that. It is good <reg orig="descrip-|tion">description</reg>, <lb/>
compactly put. Yet there was great temptation, there, <lb/>
to drop into lurid writing.</p>
<p>But let us return to the mule. Since I left him, I have <lb/>
rummaged around and found a full report of the race. In <lb/>
it I find confirmation of the theory which I broached just <lb/>
now&mdash;namely, that the trouble with the Southern reporter <lb/>
is Women: Women, supplemented by Walter Scott and his <lb/>
knights and beauty and chivalry, and so on. This is an <lb/>
excellent report, as long as the women stay out of it. But <lb/>
when they intrude, we have this frantic result:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It will be probably a long time before the ladies' stand presents <lb/>
such a sea of foam-like loveliness as it did yesterday. The New <lb/>
Orleans women are always charming, but never so much so as at this <lb/>
time of the year, when in their dainty spring costumes they bring <lb/>
with them a breath of balmy freshness and an odor of sanctity <lb/>
unspeakable. The stand was so crowded with them that, walking <lb/>
at their feet and seeing no possibility of approach, many a man <lb/>
appreciated as he never did before the Peri's feeling at the Gates of <lb/>
Paradise, and wondered what was the priceless boon that would <lb/>
admit him to their sacred presence. Sparkling on their white-robed <lb/>
breasts or shoulders were the colors of their favorite knights, and <lb/>
<pb n="462" entity="DSSR_000002932_0465"/>
were it not for the fact that the doughty heroes appeared on <reg orig="unro-|mantic">unromantic</reg> <lb/>
mules, it would have been easy to imagine one of King <lb/>
Arthur's gala-days."</p>
<p>There were thirteen mules in the first heat; all sorts of <lb/>
mules, they were; all sorts of complexions, gaits, dispositions, <lb/>
aspects. Some were handsome creatures, some were not; <lb/>
some were sleek, some had n't had their fur brushed lately; <lb/>
some were innocently gay and frisky; some were full of <reg orig="mal-|ice">malice</reg> <lb/>
and all unrighteousness; guessing from looks, some of <lb/>
them thought the matter on hand was war, some thought <lb/>
it was a lark, the rest took it for a religious occasion. And <lb/>
each mule acted according to his convictions. The result <lb/>
was an absence of harmony well compensated by a <reg orig="conspic-|uous">conspicuous</reg> <lb/>
presence of variety&mdash;variety of a picturesque and <lb/>
entertaining sort.</p>
<figure id="f254" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0465">

</figure>
<p>All the riders were young gentlemen in fashionable <reg orig="soci-|ety">society</reg>. <lb/>
If the reader has been wondering why it is that the <lb/>
ladies of New Orleans attend so humble an orgy as a <reg orig="mule-|race">mule-race</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="463" entity="DSSR_000002932_0466"/>
the thing is explained now. <lb/>
It is a fashion-freak; all <reg orig="con-|nected">connected</reg> <lb/>
with it are people of <lb/>
fashion.</p>
<figure id="f255" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0466">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">collision.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>It is great fun, and cordially <lb/>
liked. The mule-race is one of <lb/>
the marked occasions of the year. It has brought some <lb/>
pretty fast mules to the front. One of these had to be ruled <lb/>
out, because he was so fast that he turned the thing into a <lb/>
one-mule contest, and robbed it of one of its best features&mdash; <lb/>
variety. But every now and then somebody disguises him with <lb/>
a new name and a new complexion, and rings him in again</p>
<p>The riders dress in full jockey costumes of bright-colored <lb/>
silks, satins, and velvets.</p>
<pb n="464" entity="DSSR_000002932_0467"/>
<p>The thirteen mules got away in a body, after a couple of <lb/>
false starts, and scampered off with prodigious spirit. As <lb/>
each mule and each rider had a distinct opinion of his own <lb/>
as to how the race ought to be run, and which side of the <lb/>
track was best in certain circumstances, and how often the <lb/>
track ought to be crossed, and when a collision ought to be <lb/>
accomplished, and when it ought to be avoided, these <reg orig="twenty-|six">twenty-six</reg> <lb/>
conflicting opinions created a most fantastic and <reg orig="pic-|turesque">picturesque</reg> <lb/>
confusion, and the resulting spectacle was killingly <lb/>
comical.</p>
<p>Mile heat; time, 2:22. Eight of the thirteen mules <reg orig="dis-|tanced">distanced</reg>. <lb/>
I had a bet on a mule which would have won if the <lb/>
procession had been reversed. The second heat was good <lb/>
fun; and so was the "consolation race for beaten mules," <lb/>
which followed later; but the first heat was the best in that <lb/>
respect.</p>
<p>I think that much the most enjoyable of all races is a <lb/>
steamboat race; but, next to that, I prefer the gay and <reg orig="joy-|ous">joyous</reg> <lb/>
mule-rush. Two red-hot steamboats raging along, <reg orig="neck-|and-neck">neck-and-neck</reg>, <lb/>
straining every nerve&mdash;that is to say, every rivet <lb/>
in the boilers&mdash;quaking and shaking and groaning from <lb/>
stem to stern, spouting white steam from the pipes, pouring <lb/>
black smoke from the chimneys, raining down sparks, <reg orig="part-|ing">parting</reg> <lb/>
the river into long breaks of hissing foam&mdash;this is <lb/>
sport that makes a body's very liver curl with enjoyment. <lb/>
A horse-race is pretty tame and colorless in comparison. <lb/>
Still, a horse-race might be well enough, in its way, perhaps, <lb/>
if it were not for the tiresome false starts. But then, <lb/>
nobody is ever killed. At least, nobody was ever killed <lb/>
when I was at a horse-race. They have been crippled, it is <lb/>
true; but this is little to the purpose.</p>

<head>ENCHANTMENTS AND ENCHANTERS.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> largest annual event in New Orleans is a something <lb/>
which we arrived too late to sample&mdash;the Mardi-Gras <lb/>
festivities. I saw the procession of the Mystic Crew of Comus <lb/>
there, twenty-four years ago&mdash;with knights and nobles and <lb/>
so on, clothed in silken and golden Paris-made <reg orig="gorgeous-|nesses">gorgeousnesses</reg>, <lb/>
planned and bought for that single night's use; and <lb/>
in their train all manner of giants, dwarfs, monstrosities, <lb/>
and other diverting grotesquerie&mdash;a startling and wonderful <lb/>
sort of show, as it filed solemnly and silently down the <lb/>
street in the light of its smoking and flickering torches; but <lb/>
it is said that in these latter days the spectacle is mightily <lb/>
augmented, as to cost, splendor, and variety. There is a <lb/>
chief personage&mdash;"Rex;" and if I remember rightly, neither <lb/>
this king nor any of his great following of subordinates is <lb/>
known to any outsider. All these people are gentlemen of <lb/>
position and consequence; and it is a proud thing to belong <lb/>
to the organization; so the mystery in which they hide their <lb/>
personality is merely for romance's sake, and not on account <lb/>
of the police.</p>
<p>Mardi-Gras is of course a relic of the French and Spanish <lb/>
occupation; but I judge that the religious feature has been <lb/>
pretty well knocked out of it now. Sir Walter has got the <lb/>
advantage of the gentlemen of the cowl and rosary, and <lb/>
he will stay. His medi&aelig;val business, supplemented by the <lb/>
monsters and the oddities, and the pleasant creatures from <lb/>
fairy-land, is finer to look at than the poor fantastic <reg orig="inven-|tions">inventions</reg> <lb/>
and performances of the revelling rabble of the priest's <lb/>
<pb n="466" entity="DSSR_000002932_0469"/>
day, and serves quite as well, perhaps, to emphasize the day <lb/>
and admonish men that the grace-line between the worldly <lb/>
season and the holy one is reached.</p>
<figure id="f256" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0469">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">mardi-gras.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>This Mardi-Gras pageant was the exclusive possession of <lb/>
New Orleans until recently. But now it has spread to <reg orig="Mem-|phis">Memphis</reg> <lb/>
and St. Louis and Baltimore. It has probably reached <lb/>
its limit. It is a thing which could hardly exist in the <lb/>
<pb n="467" entity="DSSR_000002932_0470"/>
practical North; would certainly last but a very brief time; <lb/>
as brief a time as it would last in London. For the soul of <lb/>
it is the romantic, not the funny and the grotesque. Take <lb/>
away the romantic mysteries, the kings and knights and <reg orig="big-|sounding">big-sounding</reg> <lb/>
titles, and Mardi-Gras would die, down there in <lb/>
the South. The very feature that keeps it alive in the South <lb/>
&mdash;girly-girly romance&mdash;would kill it in the North or in <lb/>
London. Puck and Punch, and the press universal, would <lb/>
fall upon it and make merciless fun of it, and its first <reg orig="exhi-|bition">exhibition</reg> <lb/>
would be also its last.</p>
<p>Against the crimes of the French Revolution and of <reg orig="Bona-|parte">Bonaparte</reg> <lb/>
may be set two compensating benefactions: the <reg orig="Revo-|lution">Revolution</reg> <lb/>
broke the chains of the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi> and of the <lb/>
Church, and made of a nation of abject slaves a nation of <lb/>
freemen; and Bonaparte instituted the setting of merit <lb/>
above birth, and also so completely stripped the divinity <lb/>
from royalty, that whereas crowned heads in Europe were <lb/>
gods before, they are only men, since, and can never be gods <lb/>
again, but only figure-heads, and answerable for their acts <lb/>
like common clay. Such benefactions as these compensate <lb/>
the temporary harm which Bonaparte and the Revolution <lb/>
did, and leave the world in debt to them for these great and <lb/>
permanent services to liberty, humanity, and progress.</p>
<p>Then comes Sir Walter Scott with his enchantments, and <lb/>
by his single might checks this wave of progress, and even <lb/>
turns it back; sets the world in love with dreams and <reg orig="phan-|toms">phantoms</reg>; <lb/>
with decayed and swinish forms of religion; with <lb/>
decayed and degraded systems of government; with the <lb/>
sillinesses and emptinesses, sham grandeurs, sham gauds, <lb/>
and sham chivalries of a brainless and worthless long-<reg orig="van-|ished">vanished</reg> <lb/>
society. He did measureless harm; more real and <lb/>
lasting harm, perhaps, than any other individual that ever <lb/>
wrote. Most of the world has now outlived good part of <lb/>
these harms, though by no means all of them; but in our <lb/>
South they flourish pretty forcefully still. Not so forcefully <lb/>
as half a generation ago, perhaps, but still forcefully. There, <lb/>
<pb n="468" entity="DSSR_000002932_0471"/>
the genuine and <reg orig="whole-|some">wholesome</reg> <lb/>
civilization of the <lb/>
nineteenth century is <lb/>
curiously confused and <lb/>
commingled with the <lb/>
Walter Scott Middle-Age <lb/>
sham civilization and so <lb/>
you have practical, <reg orig="com-|mon-sense">common-sense</reg>, <lb/>
progressive ideas, and progressive works, mixed <lb/>
up with the duel, the inflated speech, and the jejune <reg orig="ro-|manticism">romanticism</reg> <lb/>
of an absurd past that is dead, and out of <reg orig="char-|ity">charity</reg> <lb/>
ought to be buried. But for the Sir Walter disease, <lb/>
the character of the Southerner&mdash;or Southron, <reg orig="accord-|ing">according</reg> <lb/>
to Sir Walter's starchier way of phrasing it&mdash;would be <lb/>
wholly modern, in place of modern and medi&aelig;val mixed,</p>
<figure id="f257" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0471">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">chivalry.</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="469" entity="DSSR_000002932_0472"/>
<p>and the South would be fully a generation further advanced <lb/>
than it is. It was Sir Walter that made every gentleman in <lb/>
the South a Major or a Colonel, or a General or a Judge, <lb/>
before the war; and it was he, also, that made these <reg orig="gentle-|men">gentlemen</reg> <lb/>
value these bogus decorations. For it was he that <lb/>
created rank and caste down there, and also reverence for <lb/>
rank and caste, and pride and pleasure in them. Enough is <lb/>
laid on slavery, without fathering upon it these creations <lb/>
and contributions of Sir Walter.</p>
<p>Sir Walter had so large a hand in making Southern <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg>, <lb/>
as it existed before the war, that he is in great measure <lb/>
responsible for the war. It seems a little harsh toward a <lb/>
dead man to say that we never should have had any war but <lb/>
for Sir Walter; and yet something of a plausible argument <lb/>
might, perhaps, be made in support of that wild proposition. <lb/>
The Southerner of the American revolution owned slaves; so <lb/>
did the Southerner of the Civil War: but the former <reg orig="resem-|bles">resembles</reg> <lb/>
the latter as an Englishman resembles a Frenchman. <lb/>
The change of character can be traced rather more easily to <lb/>
Sir Walter's influence than to that of any other thing or <lb/>
person.</p>
<p>One may observe, by one or two signs, how deeply that <lb/>
influence penetrated, and how strongly it holds. If one take <lb/>
up a Northern or Southern literary periodical of forty or <lb/>
fifty years ago, he will find it filled with wordy, windy, <reg orig="flow-|ery">flowery</reg> <lb/>
"eloquence," romanticism, sentimentality &mdash; all imitated <lb/>
from Sir Walter, and sufficiently badly done, too&mdash;innocent <lb/>
travesties of his style and methods, in fact. This sort of <reg orig="lit-|erature">literature</reg> <lb/>
being the fashion in both sections of the country, <lb/>
there was opportunity for the fairest competition; and as a <lb/>
consequence, the South was able to show as many well-known <lb/>
literary names, proportioned to population, as the North <lb/>
could.</p>
<p>But a change has come, and there is no opportunity now <lb/>
for a fair competition between North and South. For the <lb/>
North has thrown out that old inflated style, whereas the <lb/>
<pb n="470" entity="DSSR_000002932_0473"/>
Southern writer still clings to it&mdash;clings to it and has a <lb/>
restricted market for his wares, as a consequence. There is <lb/>
as much literary talent in the South, now, as ever there was, <lb/>
of course; but its work can gain but slight currency under <lb/>
present conditions; the authors write for the past, not the <lb/>
present; they use obsolete forms, and a dead language. But <lb/>
when a Southerner of genius writes modern English, his <lb/>
book goes upon crutches no longer, but upon wings; and <lb/>
they carry it swiftly all about America and England, and <lb/>
through the great English reprint publishing houses of <reg orig="Ger-|many&mdash;as">Germany&mdash;as</reg> <lb/>
witness the experience of Mr. Cable and Uncle <lb/>
Remus, two of the very few Southern authors who do not <lb/>
write in the southern style. Instead of three or four <reg orig="widely-|known">widely-known</reg> <lb/>
literary names, the South ought to have a dozen or <lb/>
two&mdash;and will have them when Sir Walter's time is out.</p>
<p>A curious exemplification of the power of a single book <lb/>
for good or harm is shown in the effects wrought by Don <lb/>
Quixote and those wrought by Ivanhoe. The first swept the <lb/>
world's admiration for the medi&aelig;val chivalry-silliness out of <lb/>
existence; and the other restored it. As far as our South is <lb/>
concerned, the good work done by Cervantes is pretty nearly <lb/>
a dead letter, so effectually has Scott's pernicious work <lb/>
undermined it.</p>

<head>UNCLE REMUS AND MR. CABLE.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Mr. joel chandler harris</hi> ("Uncle Remus") <lb/>
was to arrive from Atlanta at seven o'clock Sunday <lb/>
morning; so we got up and received him. We were able to <lb/>
detect him among the crowd of arrivals at the hotel-counter <lb/>
by his correspondence with a description of him which had <lb/>
been furnished us from a trustworthy source. He was said <lb/>
to be undersized, red-haired, and somewhat freckled. He <lb/>
was the only man in the party whose outside tallied with this <lb/>
bill of particulars. He was said to be very shy. He is a shy <lb/>
man. Of this there is no doubt. It may not show on the <lb/>
surface, but the shyness is there. After days of intimacy <lb/>
one wonders to see that it is still in about as strong force as <lb/>
ever. There is a fine and beautiful nature hidden behind it, <lb/>
as all know who have read the Uncle Remus book; and a <lb/>
fine genius, too, as all know by the same sign. I seem to <lb/>
be talking quite freely about this neighbor; but in talking <lb/>
to the public I am but talking to his personal friends, and <lb/>
these things are permissible among friends.</p>
<p>He deeply disappointed a number of children who had <lb/>
flocked eagerly to Mr. Cable's house to get a glimpse of the <lb/>
illustrious sage and oracle of the nation's nurseries. They <lb/>
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Why, he's white!"</p>
<p>They were grieved about it. So, to console them, the book <lb/>
was brought, that they might hear Uncle Remus's Tar-Baby <lb/>
story from the lips of Uncle Remus himself&mdash;or what, in <lb/>
their outraged eyes, was left of him. But it turned out that <lb/>
<pb n="472" entity="DSSR_000002932_0475"/>
he had never read aloud to people, and was too shy to venture <lb/>
the attempt now. Mr. Cable and I read from books of ours, <lb/>
to show him what an easy <lb/>
trick it was; but his <reg orig="immor-|tal">immortal</reg> <lb/>
shyness was proof against <lb/>
even this sagacious strategy, <lb/>
so we had to read about Brer <lb/>
Rabbit ourselves.</p>
<p>Mr. Harris ought to be able <lb/>
to read the negro dialect <reg orig="bet-|ter">better</reg> <lb/>
than anybody else, for in <lb/>
the matter of writing it he is <lb/>
the only master the country <lb/>
has produced. Mr. Cable is <lb/>
the only master in the writing <lb/>
of French dialects that the <lb/>
country has produced; and he <lb/>
reads them in perfection. It <lb/>
was a great treat to hear him <lb/>
read about Jean-ah Poquelin, <lb/>
and about Innerarity and his <lb/>
famous "pigshoo" <reg orig="represent-|ing">representing</reg> <lb/>
"Louisihanna <hi rend="italic">Rif</hi>-fusing <lb/>
to Hanter the Union," along <lb/>
with passages of nicely-shaded <lb/>
German dialect from a novel <lb/>
which was still in manuscript.</p>

<p>It came out in conversation, <lb/>
that in two different instances <lb/>
Mr. Cable got into grotesque <lb/>
trouble by using, in his books, next-to-impossible French <lb/>
names which nevertheless happened to be borne by living <lb/>
and sensitive citizens of New-Orleans. His names were <lb/>
either inventions or were borrowed from the ancient and <lb/>
obsolete past, I do not now remember which; but at any <lb/>
rate living bearers of them turned up, and were a good <lb/>
<pb n="473" entity="DSSR_000002932_0476"/>
deal hurt at having attention directed to themselves and <lb/>
their affairs in so excessively public a manner.</p>

<p>Mr. Warner and I had an experience of the same sort <lb/>
when we wrote the book called "The Gilded Age." There <lb/>
is a character in it called "Sellers." I do not remember <lb/>
what his first name was, in the beginning; but anyway, Mr. <lb/>
Warner did not like it, and wanted it improved. He asked <lb/>
me if I was able to imagine a person named "Eschol <lb/>
Sellers." Of course I said I could not, without stimulants. <lb/>
He said that away out West, once, he had met, and <reg orig="contem-|plated">contemplated</reg>, <lb/>
and actually shaken hands with a man bearing that <lb/>
impossible name&mdash;"Eschol Sellers." He added,&mdash;</p>
<pb n="474" entity="DSSR_000002932_0477"/>
<p>"It was twenty years ago; his name has probably carried <lb/>
him off before this; and if it has n't, he will never see the <lb/>
book anyhow. We will confiscate his name. The name you <lb/>
are using is common, and therefore dangerous; there are <lb/>
probably a thousand Sellerses bearing it, and the whole <lb/>
horde will come after us; but Eschol Sellers is a safe name <lb/>
&mdash;it is a rock."</p>
<p>So we borrowed that name; and when the book had been <lb/>
out about a week, one of the stateliest and handsomest and <lb/>
most aristocratic looking white men that ever lived, called <lb/>
around, with the most formidable libel suit in his pocket <lb/>
that ever&mdash;well, in brief, we got his permission to suppress <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">One</hi> day, on the street, I encountered the man whom, of <lb/>
all men, I most wished to see&mdash;Horace Bixby; <reg orig="for-|merly">formerly</reg> <lb/>
pilot under me&mdash;or rather, over me&mdash;now captain of <lb/>
the great steamer "City of Baton Rouge," the latest and <lb/>
swiftest addition to the Anchor Line. The same slender <lb/>
figure, the same tight curls, the same springy step, the same <lb/>
alertness, the same decision of eye and answering decision <lb/>
of hand, the same erect military bearing; not an inch gained <lb/>
or lost in girth, not an ounce gained or lost in weight, not <lb/>
a hair turned. It is a curious thing, to leave a man <reg orig="thirty-|five">thirty-five</reg> <lb/>
years old, and come back at the end of twenty-one years <lb/>
and find him still only thirty-five. I have not had an <reg orig="experi-|ence">experience</reg> <lb/>

but they counted for next to nothing, since they were <lb/>

<p>His boat was just in. I had been waiting several days for <lb/>

and I joined a party of ladies and gentlemen, guests of Major <lb/>
Wood, and went down the river fifty-four miles, in a swift <lb/>
tug, to ex-Governor Warmouth's sugar plantation. Strung <lb/>
along below the city, were a number of decayed, ram-shackly, <lb/>
superannuated old steamboats, not one of which had I ever <lb/>
seen before. They had all been built, and worn out, and <lb/>
thrown aside, since I was here last. This gives one a <reg orig="real-|izing">realizing</reg> <lb/>
sense of the frailness of a Mississippi boat and the <lb/>
briefness of its life.</p>
<pb n="476" entity="DSSR_000002932_0479"/>
<p>Six miles below town a fat and battered brick chimney, <lb/>
sticking above the magnolias and live-oaks, was pointed out <lb/>
as the monument erected by an appreciative nation to <reg orig="cele-|brate">celebrate</reg> <lb/>
the battle of New Orleans&mdash;Jackson's victory over the <lb/>
British, January 8, 1815. The war had ended, the two <lb/>
nations were at peace, but the news had not yet reached <lb/>
New Orleans. If we had had the cable telegraph in those <lb/>
days, this blood would not have been spilt, those lives would <lb/>
not have been wasted; and better still, Jackson would <reg orig="prob-|ably">probably</reg> <lb/>
never have been president. We have gotten over the <lb/>
harms done us by the war of 1812, but not over some of <lb/>
those done us by Jackson's presidency.</p>
<p>The Warmouth plantation covers a vast deal of ground, <lb/>
and the hospitality of the Warmouth mansion is graduated <lb/>
to the same large scale. We saw steam-plows at work, <lb/>
here, for the first time. The traction engine travels about <lb/>
on its own wheels, till it reaches the required spot; then it <lb/>
stands still and by means of a wire rope pulls the huge plow <lb/>
toward itself two or three hundred yards across the field, <lb/>
between the rows of cane. The thing cuts down into the <lb/>
black mould a foot and a half deep. The plow looks like <lb/>
a fore-and-aft brace of a Hudson river steamer, inverted. <lb/>
When the negro steersman sits on one end of it, that end <lb/>
tilts down near the ground, while the other sticks up high in <lb/>
air. This great see-saw goes rolling and pitching like a ship <lb/>
at sea, and it is not every circus rider that could stay on it.</p>
<p>The plantation contains two thousand six hundred acres; <lb/>
six hundred and fifty are in cane; and there is a fruitful <lb/>
orange grove of five thousand trees. The cane is cultivated <lb/>
after a modern and intricate scientific fashion, too elaborate <lb/>
and complex for me to attempt to describe; but it lost <lb/>
$40,000 last year. I forget the other details. However, <lb/>
this year's crop will reach ten or twelve hundred tons of <lb/>
sugar, consequently last year's loss will not matter. These <lb/>
troublesome and expensive scientific methods achieve a yield <lb/>
of a ton and a half, and from that to two tons, to the acre; <lb/>

</figure>
<pb entity="DSSR_000002932_0481"/>
<pb n="479" entity="DSSR_000002932_0482"/>
which is three or four times what the yield of an acre was in <lb/>
my time.</p>
<p>The drainage-ditches were everywhere alive with little <lb/>
crabs&mdash;"fiddlers." One saw them scampering sidewise in <lb/>
every direction whenever they heard a disturbing noise. <lb/>
Expensive pests, these crabs; for they bore into the levees, <lb/>
and ruin them.</p>
<p>The great sugar-house was a wilderness of tubs and <lb/>
tanks and vats and filters, pumps, pipes, and machinery. <lb/>
The process of making sugar is exceedingly interesting. <lb/>
First, you heave your cane into the centrifugals and grind <lb/>
out the juice; then run it through the evaporating pan to <lb/>
extract the fibre; then through the bone-filter to remove the <lb/>
alcohol; then through the clarifying tanks to discharge the <lb/>
molasses; then through the granulating pipe to condense it; <lb/>
then through the vacuum pan to extract the vacuum. It is <lb/>
now ready for market. I have jotted these particulars down <lb/>
from memory. The thing looks simple and easy. Do not <lb/>
deceive yourself. To make sugar is really one of the most <lb/>
difficult things in the world. And to make it right, is next <lb/>
to impossible. If you will examine your own supply every <lb/>
now and then for a term of years, and tabulate the result, <lb/>
you will find that not two men in twenty can make sugar <lb/>
without getting sand into it.</p>
<p>We could have gone down to the mouth of the river and <lb/>
visited Captain Eads' great work, the "jetties," where the <lb/>
river has been compressed between walls, and thus deepened <lb/>
to twenty-six feet; but it was voted useless to go, since at <lb/>
this stage of the water everything would be covered up and <lb/>
invisible.</p>
<p>We could have visited that ancient and singular burg, <lb/>
"Pilot-town," which stands on stilts in the water&mdash;so they <lb/>
say; where nearly all communication is by skiff and canoe, <lb/>
even to the attending of weddings and funerals; and where <lb/>
the littlest boys and girls are as handy with the oar as <lb/>
unamphibious children are with the velocipede.</p>

<p>We could have done a number of other things; but on <lb/>
account of limited time, we went back home. The sail up <lb/>
the breezy and sparkling river was a charming experience, <lb/>
and would have been satisfyingly sentimental and romantic <lb/>
but for the interruptions of the tug's pet parrot, whose <reg orig="tire-|less">tireless</reg> <lb/>
comments upon the scenery and the guests were always <lb/>
this-worldly, and often profane. He had also a <reg orig="superabun-|dance">superabundance</reg> <lb/>
of the discordant, ear-splitting, metallic laugh common <lb/>
to his breed,&mdash;a machine-made laugh, a Frankenstein laugh, <lb/>
with the soul left out of it. He applied it to every <reg orig="senti-|mental">sentimental</reg> <lb/>
remark, and to every pathetic song. He cackled it <lb/>
out with hideous energy after "Home again, home again, <lb/>
from a foreign shore," and said he "wouldn't give a damn <lb/>
for a tug-load of such rot." Romance and sentiment <reg orig="can-|not">cannot</reg> <lb/>
long survive this sort of discouragement; so the singing <lb/>
<pb n="481" entity="DSSR_000002932_0484"/>
and talking presently ceased; which so delighted the parrot <lb/>
that he cursed himself hoarse for joy.</p>

<p>Then the male members of the party moved to the <reg orig="fore-|castle">forecastle</reg>, <lb/>
to smoke and gossip. There were several old <reg orig="steam-|boatmen">steamboatmen</reg> <lb/>
along, and I learned from them a great deal of what <lb/>
had been happening to my former river friends during my <lb/>
long absence. I learned that a pilot whom I used to steer <lb/>
for is become a spiritualist, and for more than fifteen years <lb/>
has been receiving a letter every week from a deceased <reg orig="rela-|tive">relative</reg>, <lb/>
through a New York spiritualistic medium named <reg orig="Man-|chester&mdash;postage">Manchester&mdash;postage</reg> <lb/>
graduated by distance: from the local <lb/>
post-office in Paradise to New York, five dollars; from New <lb/>
York to St. Louis, three cents. I remember Mr. Manchester <lb/>
<pb n="482" entity="DSSR_000002932_0485"/>
very well. I called on him once, ten years ago, with a <lb/>
couple of friends, one of whom wished to inquire after a <lb/>
deceased uncle. This uncle had lost his life in a peculiarly <lb/>
violent and unusual way, half a dozen years before: a cyclone <lb/>
blew him some three miles and knocked a tree down with <lb/>
him which was four feet through at the butt and sixty-five <lb/>
feet high. He did not survive this triumph. At the <hi rend="italic">s&eacute;ance</hi> <lb/>
just referred to, my friend questioned his late uncle, through <lb/>
Mr. Manchester, and the late uncle wrote down his replies, <lb/>
using Mr. Manchester's hand and pencil for that purpose. <lb/>
The following is a fair example of the questions asked, and <lb/>
also of the sloppy twaddle in the way of answers, furnished <lb/>
by Manchester under the pretence that it came from the <lb/>
spectre. If this man is not the paltriest fraud that lives, <lb/>
I owe him an apology:&mdash;</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">A.</hi> (After long hesitation and many throes and spasms.) <lb/>

<p>This ended the interview. My friend told the medium that <lb/>
<pb n="485" entity="DSSR_000002932_0488"/>
when his relative was in this poor world, he was endowed <lb/>
with an extraordinary intellect and an absolutely defectless <lb/>
memory, and it seemed a great pity that he had not been <lb/>
allowed to keep some shred of these for his amusement in <lb/>
the realms of everlasting contentment, and for the <reg orig="amaze-|ment">amazement</reg> <lb/>
and admiration of the rest of the population there.</p>
<p>This man had plenty of clients&mdash;has plenty yet. He <lb/>
receives letters from spirits located in every part of the <lb/>
spirit world, and delivers them all over this country through <lb/>
the United States mail. These letters are filled with advice <lb/>
&mdash;advice from "spirits" who don't know as much as a <reg orig="tad-|pole&mdash;and">tadpole&mdash;and</reg> <lb/>
this advice is religiously followed by the receivers. <lb/>
One of these clients was a man whom the spirits (if one may <lb/>
thus plurally describe the ingenious Manchester) were <reg orig="teach-|ing">teaching</reg> <lb/>
how to contrive an improved railway car-wheel. It is <lb/>
coarse employment for a spirit, but it is higher and <reg orig="whole-|somer">wholesomer</reg> <lb/>
activity than talking forever about "how happy we <lb/>
are."</p>

<head>EPISODES IN PILOT LIFE.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the course of the tug-boat gossip, it came out that out <lb/>
of every five of my former friends who had quitted the <lb/>
river, four had chosen farming as an occupation. Of course <lb/>
this was not because they were peculiarly gifted, <reg orig="agricultur-|ally">agriculturally</reg>, <lb/>
and thus more likely to succeed as farmers than in <lb/>
other industries: the reason for their choice must be traced <lb/>
to some other source. Doubtless they chose farming because <lb/>
that life is private and secluded from irruptions of <reg orig="undesir-|able">undesirable</reg> <lb/>
strangers,&mdash;like the pilot-house hermitage. And <reg orig="doubt-|less">doubtless</reg> <lb/>
they also chose it because on a thousand nights of black <lb/>
storm and danger they had noted the twinkling lights of <lb/>
solitary farm-houses, as the boat swung by, and pictured to <lb/>
themselves the serenity and security and cosiness of such <lb/>
refuges at such times, and so had by and by come to dream <lb/>
of that retired and peaceful life as the one desirable thing <lb/>
to long for, anticipate, earn, and at last enjoy.</p>
<p>But I did not learn that any of these pilot-farmers had <lb/>
astonished anybody with their successes. Their farms do <lb/>
not support them: they support their farms. The <reg orig="pilot-|farmer">pilot-farmer</reg> <lb/>
disappears from the river annually, about the <reg orig="break-|ing">breaking</reg> <lb/>
of spring, and is seen no more till next frost. Then he <lb/>
appears again, in damaged homespun, combs the hay-seed out <lb/>
of his hair, and takes a pilot-house berth for the winter. In <lb/>
this way he pays the debts which his farming has achieved <lb/>
during the agricultural season. So his river bondage is but <lb/>
half broken; he is still the river's slave the hardest half of <lb/>
the year.</p>
<pb n="487" entity="DSSR_000002932_0490"/>
<p>One of these men bought a farm, but did not retire to it. <lb/>
He knew a trick worth two of that. He did not propose <lb/>
to pauperize his farm by applying his personal ignorance to <lb/>
working it. No, he put the farm into the hands of an <reg orig="agri-|cultural">agricultural</reg> <lb/>
expert to be worked on shares&mdash;out of every three <lb/>
loads of corn the expert to have two and the pilot the third. <lb/>
But at the end of the season the pilot received no corn. The <lb/>
expert explained that <hi rend="italic">his</hi> share was not reached. The farm <lb/>
produced only two loads.</p>
<p>Some of the pilots whom I had known had had adventures; <lb/>
&mdash;the outcome fortunate, sometimes, but not in all cases. <lb/>
Captain Montgomery, whom I had steered for when he was <lb/>
a pilot, commanded the Confederate fleet in the great battle <lb/>
before Memphis; when his vessel went down, he swam <lb/>
ashore, fought his way through a squad of soldiers, and <lb/>
made a gallant and narrow escape. He was always a cool <lb/>
man; nothing could disturb his serenity. Once when he was <lb/>
captain of the "Crescent City," I was bringing the boat into <lb/>
port at New Orleans, and momently expecting orders from <lb/>
the hurricane deck, but received none. I had stopped the <lb/>
wheels, and there my authority and responsibility ceased. It <lb/>
was evening&mdash;dim twilight&mdash;the captain's hat was perched <lb/>
upon the big bell, and I supposed the intellectual end of the <lb/>
captain was in it, but such was not the case. The captain <lb/>
was very strict; therefore I knew better than to touch a <lb/>
bell without orders. My duty was to hold the boat steadily <lb/>
on her calamitous course, and leave the consequences to take <lb/>
care of themselves&mdash;which I did. So we went plowing past <lb/>
the sterns of steamboats and getting closer and closer&mdash;the <lb/>
crash was bound to come very soon&mdash;and still that hat never <lb/>
budged; for alas, the captain was napping in the texas.... <lb/>
Things were becoming exceedingly nervous and <reg orig="uncomfort-|able">uncomfortable</reg>. <lb/>
It seemed to me that the captain was not going to <lb/>
appear in time to see the entertainment. But he did. Just <lb/>
as we were walking into the stern of a steamboat, he stepped <lb/>
out on deck, and said, with heavenly serenity, "Set her back <lb/>
<pb n="488" entity="DSSR_000002932_0491"/>
on both"&mdash;which I did; but a trifle late, however, for the <lb/>
next moment we went smashing through that other boat's <lb/>
flimsy outer works with a most prodigious racket. The <reg orig="cap-|tain">captain</reg> <lb/>
never said a word to me about the matter afterwards, <lb/>
except to remark that I had done right, and that he hoped <lb/>
I would not hesitate to act in the same way again in like <lb/>
circumstances.</p>
<p>One of the pilots <lb/>
whom I had known <lb/>
when I was on the <lb/>
river had died a very <lb/>
honorable death. His <lb/>
boat caught fire, and <lb/>
he remained at the <lb/>
wheel until he got her <lb/>
safe to land. Then <lb/>
he went out over the <lb/>
breast-board with his <lb/>
clothing in flames, and <lb/>
was the last person to <lb/>
get ashore. He died <lb/>
from his injuries in <lb/>
the course of two or <lb/>
three hours, and his <lb/>
was the only life lost.</p>

piloting <reg orig="af-|fords">affords</reg> <lb/>
six or seven <reg orig="in-|stances">instances</reg> <lb/>
of this sort of martyrdom, and <lb/>
half a hundred instances of escapes from <lb/>
a like fate which came within a second or two of being <lb/>
fatally too late; <hi rend="italic">but there is no instance of a pilot <reg orig="desert-|ing">deserting</reg> <lb/>
his post to save his life while by remaining and <reg orig="sacri-|ficing">sacrificing</reg> <lb/>
it he might secure other lives from destruction.</hi> It is <lb/>
well worth while to set down this noble fact, and well <lb/>
worth while to put it in italics, too.</p>
<pb n="489" entity="DSSR_000002932_0492"/>
<p>The "cub" pilot is early admonished to despise all perils <lb/>
connected with a pilot's calling, and to prefer any sort of <lb/>
death to the deep dishonor of deserting his post while there <lb/>
is any possibility of his being useful in it. And so effectively <lb/>
are these admonitions inculcated, that even young and but <lb/>
half-tried pilots can be depended upon to stick to the wheel, <lb/>
and die there when occasion requires. In a Memphis <reg orig="grave-|yard">graveyard</reg> <lb/>
is buried a young fellow who perished at the wheel a <lb/>
great many years ago, in White River, to save the lives of <lb/>
other men. He said to the captain that if the fire would <lb/>
give him time to reach a sand bar, some distance away, all <lb/>
could be saved, but that to land against the bluff bank of <lb/>
the river would be to insure the loss of many lives. He <lb/>
reached the bar and grounded the boat in shallow water; <lb/>
but by that time the flames had closed around him, and in <lb/>
escaping through them he was fatally burned. He had been <lb/>
urged to fly sooner, but had replied as became a pilot to <lb/>
reply:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I will not go. If I go, nobody will be saved; if I stay, <lb/>
no one will be lost but me. I will stay."</p>
<p>There were two hundred persons on board, and no life was <lb/>
lost but the pilot's. There used to be a monument to this <lb/>
young fellow, in that Memphis graveyard. While we tarried <lb/>
in Memphis on our down trip, I started out to look for it, <lb/>
but our time was so brief that I was obliged to turn back <lb/>
before my object was accomplished.</p>
<p>The tug-boat gossip informed me that Dick Kennet was <lb/>
dead&mdash;blown up, near Memphis, and killed; that several <lb/>
others whom I had known had fallen in the war&mdash;one or <lb/>
two of them shot down at the wheel; that another and very <lb/>
particular friend, whom I had steered many trips for, had <lb/>
stepped out of his house in New Orleans, one night years <lb/>
ago, to collect some money in a remote part of the city, and <lb/>
had never been seen again,&mdash;was murdered and thrown into <lb/>
the river, it was thought; that Ben Thornburgh was dead <lb/>
long ago; also his wild "cub" whom I used to quarrel with, <lb/>
<pb n="490" entity="DSSR_000002932_0493"/>
all through every daylight watch. A heedless, reckless <lb/>
creature he was, and always in hot water, always in <reg orig="mis-|chief">mischief</reg>. <lb/>
An Arkansas passenger brought an enormous bear <lb/>
aboard, one day, and chained him to a life-boat on the <reg orig="hurri-|cane">hurricane</reg> <lb/>
deck. Thornburgh's "cub" could not rest till he had <lb/>
gone there and unchained the bear, to "see what he would <lb/>
do." He was promptly gratified. The bear chased him <lb/>
around and around the deck, for miles and miles, with two <lb/>
hundred eager faces grinning through the railings for <reg orig="au-|dience">audience</reg>, <lb/>
and finally snatched off the lad's coat-tail and went <lb/>
into the texas to chew it. The off-watch turned out with <lb/>
alacrity, and left the bear in sole possession. He presently <lb/>
grew lonesome, and started out for recreation. He ranged</p>

<p>the whole boat&mdash;visited every part of it, with an advance <lb/>
guard of fleeing people in front of him and a voiceless <lb/>
vacancy behind him; and when his owner captured him at <lb/>
last, those two were the only visible beings anywhere; <reg orig="every-|body">everybody</reg> <lb/>
else was in hiding, and the boat was a solitude.</p>
<p>I was told that one of my pilot friends fell dead at the <lb/>
wheel, from heart disease, in 1869. The captain was on the <lb/>
roof at the time. He saw the boat breaking for the shore; <lb/>
shouted, and got no answer; ran up, and found the pilot <lb/>
lying dead on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. Bixby had been blown up, in Madrid bend; was not <lb/>
injured, but the other pilot was lost.</p>
<p>George Ritchie had been blown up near Memphis&mdash;blown <lb/>
into the river from the wheel, and disabled. The water was <lb/>
very cold; he clung to a cotton bale&mdash;mainly with his <lb/>
teeth&mdash;and floated until nearly exhausted, when he was <lb/>
rescued by some deck hands who were on a piece of the <lb/>
wreck. They tore open the bale and packed him in the <reg orig="cot-|ton">cotton</reg>, <lb/>
and warmed the life back into him, and got him safe <lb/>

Rouge" now.</p>

a bit of romance,&mdash;somewhat grotesque romance, but <reg orig="ro-|mance">romance</reg> <lb/>
nevertheless. When I knew him he was a shiftless <lb/>
young spendthrift, boisterous, good-hearted, full of careless <lb/>
generosities, and pretty conspicuously promising to fool <lb/>
his possibilities away early, and come to nothing. In a <lb/>
Western city lived a rich and childless old foreigner and <lb/>
his wife; and in their family was a comely young girl&mdash;sort <lb/>
of friend, sort of servant. The young clerk of whom I have <lb/>
been speaking,&mdash;whose name was not George Johnson, but <lb/>
who shall be called George Johnson for the purposes of this <lb/>
narrative,&mdash;got acquainted with this young girl, and they <lb/>
sinned; and the old foreigner found them out, and rebuked <lb/>
them. Being ashamed, they lied, and said they were married; <lb/>
that they had been privately married. Then the old <reg orig="foreign-|er's">foreigner's</reg> <lb/>
hurt was healed, and he forgave and blessed them. After <lb/>
that, they were able to continue their sin without concealment. <lb/>
By and by the foreigner's wife died; and presently he followed <lb/>
after her. Friends of the family assembled to mourn; and <lb/>
among the mourners sat the two young sinners. The will <lb/>
was opened and solemnly read. It bequeathed every penny <lb/>
of that old man's great wealth to <hi rend="italic">Mrs. George Johnson!</hi></p>
<p>And there was no such person. The young sinners fled <lb/>
forth then, and did a very foolish thing: married themselves <lb/>
before an obscure Justice of the Peace, and got him to <reg orig="ante-|date">antedate</reg> <lb/>
the thing. That did no sort of good. The distant <lb/>
relatives flocked in and exposed the fraudful date with <lb/>
extreme suddenness and surprising ease, and carried off the <lb/>
fortune, leaving the Johnsons very legitimately, and legally, <lb/>
and irrevocably chained together in honorable marriage, but <lb/>
with not so much as a penny to bless themselves withal. <lb/>
Such are the actual facts; and not all novels have for a base <lb/>
so telling a situation.</p>

<head>THE "ORIGINAL JACOBS."</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> had some talk about Captain Isaiah Sellers, now <lb/>
many years dead. He was a fine man, a <reg orig="high-|minded">high-minded</reg> <lb/>
man, and greatly respected both ashore and on the <lb/>
river. He was very tall, well built, and handsome; and in <lb/>
his old age&mdash;as I remember him&mdash;his hair was as black <lb/>
as an Indian's, and his eye and hand were as strong and <lb/>
steady and his nerve and judgment as firm and clear as <lb/>
anybody's, young or old, among the fraternity of pilots. He <lb/>
was the patriarch of the craft; he had been a keelboat pilot <lb/>
before the day of steamboats; and a steamboat pilot before <lb/>
any other steamboat pilot, still surviving at the time I speak <lb/>
of, had ever turned a wheel. Consequently his brethren held <lb/>
him in the sort of awe in which illustrious survivors of a <reg orig="by-|gone">bygone</reg> <lb/>
age are always held by their associates. He knew how <lb/>
he was regarded, and perhaps this fact added some trifle of <lb/>
stiffening to his natural dignity, which had been sufficiently <lb/>
stiff in its original state.</p>
<p>He left a diary behind him; but apparently it did not date <lb/>
back to his first steamboat trip, which was said to be 1811, <lb/>
the year the first steamboat disturbed the waters of the <reg orig="Mis-|sissippi">Mississippi</reg>. <lb/>
At the time of his death a correspondent of the <lb/>
"St. Louis Republican" culled the following items from the <lb/>
diary:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In February, 1825, he shipped on board the steamer 'Rambler,' <lb/>
at Florence, Ala., and made during that year three trips to New <lb/>
<pb n="494" entity="DSSR_000002932_0497"/>
Orleans and back,&mdash;this on the 'Gen. Carrol,' between Nashville <lb/>
and New Orleans. It was during his stay on this boat that Captain <lb/>
Sellers introduced the tap of the bell as a signal to heave the lead, <lb/>
previous to which time it was the custom for the pilot to speak to <lb/>
the men below when soundings were wanted. The proximity of <lb/>
the forecastle to the pilot-house, no doubt, rendered this an easy <lb/>
matter; but how different on one of our palaces of the present <lb/>
day.</p>
<p>"In 1827 we find him on board the 'President,' a boat of two <lb/>
hundred and eighty-five tons burden, and plying between Smithland <lb/>
and New Orleans. Thence he joined the 'Jubilee' in 1828, and <lb/>
on this boat he did his first piloting in the St. Louis trade; his first <lb/>
watch extending from Herculaneum to St. Genevieve. On May 26, <lb/>
1836, he completed and left Pittsburg in charge of the steamer <lb/>
'Prairie,' a boat of four hundred tons, and the first steamer with a <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">state-room cabin</hi> ever seen at St. Louis. In 1857 he introduced the <lb/>
signal for meeting boats, and which has, with some slight change, <lb/>
been the universal custom of this day; in fact, is rendered obligatory <lb/>
by act of Congress.</p>
<p>"As general items of river history, we quote the following <lb/>
marginal notes from his general log:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In March, 1825, Gen. Lafayette left New Orleans for St. Louis <lb/>
on the low-pressure steamer 'Natchez.'</p>
<p>"In January, 1828, twenty-one steamers left the New Orleans <lb/>
wharf to celebrate the occasion of Gen. Jackson's visit to that city.</p>
<p>"In 1830 the 'North American' made the run from New Orleans <lb/>
to Memphis in six days&mdash;best time on record to that date. It has <lb/>
since been made in two days and ten hours.</p>
<p>"In 1831 the Red River cut-off formed.</p>
<p>"In 1832 steamer 'Hudson' made the run from White River to <lb/>
Helena, a distance of seventy-five miles, in twelve hours. This was <lb/>
the source of much talk and speculation among parties directly <lb/>
interested.</p>
<p>"In 1839 Great Horseshoe cut-off formed.</p>
<p>"Up to the present time, a term of thirty-five years, we ascertain, <lb/>
by reference to the diary, he has made four hundred and sixty round <lb/>
trips to New Orleans, which gives a distance of one million one <lb/>
hundred and four thousand miles, or an average of eighty-six miles <lb/>
a day."</p>

<figure id="f269" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0498">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"a chill fell there."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Whenever Captain Sellers approached a body of gossiping <lb/>
pilots, a chill fell there, and talking ceased. For this reason: <lb/>
whenever six pilots were gathered together, there would <lb/>
always be one or two newly fledged ones in the lot, and the <lb/>
elder ones would be always "showing off" before these poor <lb/>
fellows; making them sorrowfully feel how callow they were, <lb/>
how recent their nobility, and how humble their degree, by <lb/>
talking largely and vaporously of old-time experiences on <lb/>
the river; always making it a point to date everything back <lb/>
as far as they could, so as to make the new men feel their <lb/>
newness to the sharpest degree possible, and envy the old <lb/>
<pb n="496" entity="DSSR_000002932_0499"/>
stagers in the like degree. And how these complacent <reg orig="bald-|heads">bald-heads</reg> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">would</hi> swell, and brag, and lie, and date back&mdash;ten, <lb/>
fifteen, twenty years,&mdash;and how they did enjoy the effect <lb/>
produced upon the marvelling and envying youngsters!</p>
<p>And perhaps just at this happy stage of the proceedings, <lb/>
the stately figure of Captain Isaiah Sellers, that real and only <lb/>
genuine Son of Antiquity, would drift solemnly into the midst. <lb/>
Imagine the size of the silence that would result on the <reg orig="in-|stant">instant</reg>. <lb/>
And imagine the feelings of those bald-heads, and the <lb/>
exultation of their recent audience when the ancient captain <lb/>
would begin to drop casual and indifferent remarks of a <reg orig="re-|miniscent">reminiscent</reg> <lb/>
nature,&mdash;about islands that had disappeared, and <lb/>
cut-offs that had been made, a generation before the oldest <lb/>
bald-head in the company had ever set his foot in a <reg orig="pilot-|house">pilothouse</reg>!</p>
<p>Many and many a time did this ancient mariner appear <lb/>
on the scene in the above fashion, and spread disaster and <lb/>
humiliation around him. If one might believe the pilots, he <lb/>
always dated his islands back to the misty dawn of river <lb/>
history; and he never used the same island twice; and <lb/>
never did he employ an island that still existed, or give one <lb/>
a name which anybody present was old enough to have heard <lb/>
of before. If you might believe the pilots, he was always <lb/>
conscientiously particular about little details; never spoke <lb/>
of "the State of Mississippi," for instance,&mdash;no, he would <lb/>
say, "When the State of Mississippi was where Arkansas <lb/>
now is;" and would never speak of Louisiana or Missouri in <lb/>
a general way, and leave an incorrect impression on your <lb/>
mind,&mdash;no, he would say, "When Louisiana was up the <lb/>
river farther," or "When Missouri was on the Illinois side."</p>
<p>The old gentleman was not of literary turn or capacity, <lb/>
but he used to jot down brief paragraphs of plain practical <lb/>
information about the river, and sign them "<hi rend="small-caps">Mark Twain,</hi>" <lb/>
and give them to the "New Orleans Picayune." They related <lb/>
to the stage and condition of the river, and were accurate and <lb/>
valuable; and thus far, they contained no poison. But in <lb/>
<pb n="497" entity="DSSR_000002932_0500"/>
speaking of the stage of the river to-day, at a given point, <lb/>
the captain was pretty apt to drop in a little remark about <lb/>
this being the first time he had seen the water so high or so <lb/>
low at that particular point for forty-nine years; and now <lb/>
and then he would mention Island so and so, and follow it, <lb/>
in parentheses, with some such observation as "disappeared <lb/>
in 1807, if I remember rightly." In these antique <reg orig="interjec-|tions">interjections</reg> <lb/>
lay poison and bitterness for the other old pilots, and <lb/>
they used to chaff the "Mark Twain" paragraphs with <reg orig="un-|sparing">unsparing</reg> <lb/>
mockery.</p>
<p>It so chanced that one of these paragraphs<ref target="n23" n="23"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
<note id="n23" place="foot" n="23"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>The original MS. of it, in the captain's own hand, has been sent to me <lb/>
from New Orleans. It reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Vicksburg,</hi> May 4, 1859.</p>
<p>"My opinion for the benefit of the citizens of New Orleans: The water is <lb/>
higher this far up than it has been since 1815. My opinion is that the water <lb/>
will be 4 feet deep in Canal street before the first of next June. Mrs. Turner's <lb/>
plantation at the head of Big Black Island is all under water, and it has not <lb/>
been since 1815.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">I. Sellers.</hi>"</p></note>
 became the <lb/>
text for my first newspaper article. I burlesqued it broadly, <lb/>
very broadly, stringing my fantastics out to the extent of <lb/>
eight hundred or a thousand words. I was a "cub" at the <lb/>
time. I showed my performance to some pilots, and they <lb/>
eagerly rushed it into print in the "New Orleans True <lb/>
Delta." It was a great pity; for it did nobody any worthy <lb/>
service, and it sent a pang deep into a good man's heart. <lb/>
There was no malice in my rubbish; but it laughed at the <lb/>
captain. It laughed at a man to whom such a thing was <lb/>
new and strange and dreadful. I did not know then, though <lb/>
I do now, that there is no suffering comparable with that <lb/>
which a private person feels when he is for the first time <lb/>
pilloried in print.</p>
<p>Captain Sellers did me the honor to profoundly detest me <lb/>
from that day forth. When I say he did me the honor, I am <lb/>
not using empty words. It was a very real honor to be in <lb/>
the thoughts of so great a man as Captain Sellers, and I had <lb/>
<pb n="498" entity="DSSR_000002932_0501"/>
wit enough to appreciate it and be proud of it. It was <reg orig="dis-|tinction">distinction</reg> <lb/>
to be loved by such a man; but it was a much <lb/>
greater distinction to be hated by him, because he loved <lb/>
scores of people; but he did n't sit up nights to hate <reg orig="any-|body">anybody</reg> <lb/>
but me.</p>
<p>He never <lb/>
printed <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg> <lb/>
<reg orig="para-|graph">paragraph</reg> <lb/>
while <lb/>
he lived, and <lb/>
he never again <lb/>
signed "Mark <lb/>
Twain" to <lb/>
anything. At <lb/>
the time that <lb/>
the telegraph <lb/>
brought the <lb/>
news of his <lb/>
death, I was <lb/>
on the Pacific <lb/>
coast. I was <lb/>
a fresh new <lb/>
journalist, and <lb/>
needed a <hi rend="italic">nom <lb/>
de guerre;</hi> so <lb/>
I confiscated <lb/>
the ancient <lb/>
mariner's <reg orig="dis-|carded">discarded</reg> <lb/>
one, <lb/>
and have done <lb/>
my best to make it remain what it was <lb/>
in his hands&mdash;a sign and symbol and <lb/>
warrant that whatever is found in its <lb/>
company may be gambled on as being the petrified truth; <lb/>
how I have succeeded, it would not be modest in me to say.</p>

</figure>
<p>The captain had an honorable pride in his profession and <lb/>
<pb n="499" entity="DSSR_000002932_0502"/>
an abiding love for it. He ordered his monument before he <lb/>
died, and kept it near him until he did die. It stands over <lb/>
his grave now, in Bellefontaine cemetery, St. Louis. It is <lb/>
his image, in marble, standing on duty at the pilot wheel; <lb/>
and worthy to stand and confront criticism, for it represents <lb/>
a man who in life would have staid there till he burned to a <lb/>
cinder, if duty required it.</p>
<p>The finest thing we saw on our whole Mississippi trip, we <lb/>
saw as we approached New Orleans in the steam-tug. This <lb/>
was the curving frontage of the crescent city lit up with the <lb/>
white glare of five miles of electric lights. It was a <reg orig="wonder-|ful">wonderful</reg> <lb/>
sight, and very beautiful.</p>

<head>REMINISCENCES.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> left for St. Louis in the "City of Baton Rouge," on <lb/>
a delightfully hot day, but with the main purpose of <lb/>
my visit but lamely accomplished. I had hoped to hunt up <lb/>
and talk with a hundred steamboatmen, but got so <reg orig="pleas-|antly">pleasantly</reg> <lb/>
involved in the social life of the town that I got <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg> <lb/>
more than mere five-minute talks with a couple of dozen <lb/>
of the craft.</p>
<p>I was on the bench of the pilot-house when we backed out <lb/>
and "straightened up" for the start&mdash;the boat pausing for <lb/>
a "good ready," in the old-fashioned way, and the black <lb/>
smoke piling out of the chimneys equally in the old-fashioned <lb/>
way. Then we began to gather momentum, and presently <lb/>
were fairly under way and booming along. It was all as <lb/>
natural and familiar&mdash;and so were the shoreward sights&mdash; <lb/>
as if there had been no break in my river life. There was <lb/>
a "cub," and I judged that he would take the wheel now; <lb/>
and he did. Captain Bixby stepped into the pilot-house. <lb/>
Presently the cub closed up on the rank of steamships. He <lb/>
made me nervous, for he allowed too much water to show <lb/>
between our boat and the ships. I knew quite well what was <lb/>
going to happen, because I could date back in my own life <lb/>
and inspect the record. The captain looked on, during a <lb/>
silent half-minute, then took the wheel himself, and crowded <lb/>
the boat in, till she went scraping along within a hand-breadth <lb/>
of the ships. It was exactly the favor which he had done <lb/>
me, about a quarter of a century before, in that same spot, <lb/>
<pb n="501" entity="DSSR_000002932_0504"/>
the first time I ever steamed out of the port of New Orleans. <lb/>
It was a very great and sincere pleasure to me to see the <lb/>
thing repeated&mdash;with somebody else as victim.</p>
<p>We made Natchez (three hundred miles) in twenty-two <lb/>
hours and a <lb/>
half,&mdash;much <lb/>
the swiftest <reg orig="pas-|sage">passage</reg> <lb/>
I have <lb/>
ever made over <lb/>
that piece of <lb/>
water.</p>
<p>The next <lb/>
morning I came <lb/>
on with the four <lb/>
o'clock watch, <lb/>
and saw Ritchie <lb/>
successfully <lb/>
run half a <reg orig="doz-|en">dozen</reg> <lb/>
crossings in <lb/>
a fog, using for <lb/>
his guidance the <lb/>
marked chart <lb/>
devised and <reg orig="pa-|tented">patented</reg> <lb/>
by Bixby <lb/>
and himself. <lb/>
This sufficiently <lb/>
evidenced the <lb/>
great value of <lb/>
the chart.</p>
<figure id="f272" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0504">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">i am anxious about the time.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>By and by, <lb/>
when the fog <lb/>
began to clear off, I noticed that the reflection of a tree in <lb/>
the smooth water of an overflowed bank, six hundred yards <lb/>
away, was stronger and blacker than the ghostly tree itself. <lb/>
The faint spectral trees, dimly glimpsed through the <reg orig="shred-|ding">shredding</reg> <lb/>
fog, were very pretty things to see.</p>
<pb n="502" entity="DSSR_000002932_0505"/>
<p>We had a heavy thunder-storm at Natchez, another at <lb/>
Vicksburg, and still another about fifty miles below <reg orig="Mem-|phis">Memphis</reg>. <lb/>
They had an old-fashioned energy which had long <lb/>
been unfamiliar to me. This third storm was accompanied <lb/>
by a raging wind. We tied up to the bank when we saw the <lb/>
tempest coming, and everybody left the pilot-house but me. <lb/>
The wind bent the young trees down, exposing the pale <lb/>
underside of the leaves; and gust after gust followed, in quick <lb/>
succession, thrashing the branches violently up and down, <lb/>
and to this side and that, and creating swift waves of <reg orig="alter-|nating">alternating</reg> <lb/>
green and white according to the side of the leaf <lb/>
that was exposed, and these waves raced after each other <lb/>
as do their kind over a wind-tossed field of oats. No color <lb/>
that was visible anywhere was quite natural,&mdash;all tints were <lb/>
charged with a leaden tinge from the solid cloud-bank <reg orig="over-|head">overhead</reg>. <lb/>
The river was leaden; all distances the same; and <lb/>
even the far-reaching ranks of combing white-caps were dully <lb/>
shaded by the dark, rich atmosphere through which their <lb/>
swarming legions marched. The thunder-peals were <reg orig="con-|stant">constant</reg> <lb/>
and deafening; explosion followed explosion with but <lb/>
inconsequential intervals between, and the reports grew <lb/>
steadily sharper and higher-keyed, and more trying to the <lb/>
ear; the lightning was as diligent as the thunder, and <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg> <lb/>
effects which enchanted the eye and sent electric <reg orig="ecsta-|sies">ecstasies</reg> <lb/>
of mixed delight and apprehension shivering along <lb/>
every nerve in the body in unintermittent procession. The <lb/>
rain poured down in amazing volume; the ear-splitting <lb/>
thunder-peals broke nearer and nearer; the wind increased <lb/>
in fury and began to wrench off boughs and tree-tops and <lb/>
send them sailing away through space; the pilot-house fell <lb/>
to rocking and straining and cracking and surging, and I <lb/>
went down in the hold to see what time it was.</p>
<p>People boast a good deal about Alpine thunder-storms; <lb/>
but the storms which I have had the luck to see in the Alps <lb/>
were not the equals of some which I have seen in the <reg orig="Mis-|sissippi">Mississippi</reg> <lb/>
Valley. I may not have seen the Alps do their best, <lb/>
<pb n="503" entity="DSSR_000002932_0506"/>
of course, and if they can beat the Mississippi, I don't <lb/>
wish to.</p>
<p>On this up trip I saw a little towhead (infant island) half <lb/>
a mile long, which had been formed during the past nineteen <lb/>
years. Since there was so much time to spare that nineteen <lb/>
years of it could be devoted to the construction of a mere <lb/>
towhead, where was the use, originally, in rushing this whole <lb/>
globe through in six days? It is likely that if more time had <lb/>
been taken, in the first place, the world would have been <lb/>
made right, and this ceaseless improving and repairing <lb/>
would not be necessary now. But if you hurry a world or <lb/>
a house, you are nearly sure to find out by and by, that you <lb/>
have left out a towhead, or a broom-closet, or some other <lb/>
little convenience, here and there, which has got to be <reg orig="sup-|plied">supplied</reg>, <lb/>
no matter how much expense and vexation it may <lb/>
cost.</p>
<p>We had a succession of black nights, going up the river, <lb/>
and it was observable that whenever we landed, and <reg orig="sud-|denly">suddenly</reg> <lb/>
inundated the trees with the intense sunburst of the <lb/>
electric light, a certain curious effect was always produced: <lb/>
hundreds of birds flocked instantly out from the masses of <lb/>
shining green foliage, and went careering hither and thither <lb/>
through the white rays, and often a song-bird tuned up and <lb/>
fell to singing. We judged that they mistook this superb <lb/>
artificial day for the genuine article.</p>
<p>We had a delightful trip in that thoroughly well-ordered <lb/>
steamer, and regretted that it was accomplished so speedily. <lb/>
By means of diligence and activity, we managed to hunt out <lb/>
nearly all the old friends. One was missing, however; he <lb/>
went to his reward, whatever it was, two years ago. But I <lb/>
found out all about him. His case helped me to realize how <lb/>
lasting can be the effect of a very trifling occurrence. <lb/>
When he was an apprentice-blacksmith in our village, and <lb/>
I a schoolboy, a couple of young Englishmen came to the <lb/>
town and sojourned a while; and one day they got <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
up in cheap royal finery and did the Richard III. <lb/>
<pb n="504" entity="DSSR_000002932_0507"/>
sword-fight with maniac energy and prodigious powwow, in <lb/>
the presence of the village boys. This blacksmith cub was <lb/>
there, and the <reg orig="histri-|onic">histrionic</reg> <lb/>
poison entered <lb/>
his bones. This vast, <lb/>
lumbering, ignorant, <lb/>
dull-witted lout was <lb/>
stage-struck, and <reg orig="irre-|coverably">irrecoverably</reg>. <lb/>
He <reg orig="disap-|peared">disappeared</reg>, <lb/>
and presently <lb/>
turned up in St. Louis. <lb/>
I ran across him there, <lb/>
by and by. He was <lb/>
standing musing on a <lb/>
street corner, with his <lb/>
right hand on his hip, <lb/>
the thumb of his left <lb/>
supporting his chin, <lb/>
face bowed and <reg orig="frown-|ing">frowning</reg>, <lb/>
slouch hat pulled <lb/>
down over his <reg orig="fore-|head&mdash;imagining">forehead&mdash;imagining</reg> <lb/>
<lb/>
himself to be Othello <lb/>
or some such <reg orig="charac-|ter">character</reg>, <lb/>
and imagining <lb/>
that the passing crowd <lb/>
marked his tragic <lb/>
bearing and were <reg orig="awe-|struck">awestruck</reg>.</p>
<figure id="f273" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0507">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">stage-struck.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>I joined him, and <lb/>
tried to get him down <lb/>
out of the clouds, but <lb/>
did not succeed. <reg orig="How-|ever">However</reg>, <lb/>
he casually informed me, presently, that he was a <reg orig="mem-|ber">member</reg> <lb/>
of the Walnut Street theatre company,&mdash;and he tried <lb/>
to say it with indifference, but the indifference was thin, and <lb/>
<pb n="505" entity="DSSR_000002932_0508"/>
a mighty exultation showed through it. He said he was <lb/>
cast for a part in Julius C&aelig;sar, for that night, and if I should <lb/>
come I would see him. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> I should come! I said I would n't <lb/>
miss it if I were dead.</p>
<p>I went away stupefied with astonishment, and saying to <lb/>
myself, "How strange it is! <hi rend="italic">we</hi> always thought this fellow a <lb/>
fool; yet the moment he comes to a great city, where <reg orig="intel-|ligence">intelligence</reg> <lb/>
and appreciation abound, the talent concealed in this <lb/>
shabby napkin is at once discovered, and promptly welcomed <lb/>
and honored."</p>
<p>But I came away from the theatre that night disappointed <lb/>
and offended; for I had had no glimpse of my hero, and his <lb/>
name was not in the bills. I met him on the street the next <lb/>
morning, and before I could speak, he asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Did you see me?"</p>
<p>"No, you were n't there."</p>
<p>He looked surprised and disappointed. He said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Yes, I was. Indeed I was. I was a Roman soldier."</p>
<p>"Which one?"</p>
<p>"Why, did n't you see them Roman soldiers that stood <lb/>
back there in a rank, and sometimes marched in procession <lb/>
around the stage?"</p>
<p>"Do you mean the Roman army?&mdash;those six sandalled <lb/>
roustabouts in nightshirts, with tin shields and helmets, that <lb/>
marched around treading on each other's heels, in charge of <lb/>
a spider-legged consumptive dressed like themselves?"</p>
<p>"That's it! that's it! I was one of them Roman <reg orig="sol-|diers">soldiers</reg>. <lb/>
I was the next to the last one. A half a year ago I <lb/>
used to always be the last one; but I've been promoted."</p>
<p>Well, they told me that that poor fellow remained a <lb/>
Roman soldier to the last&mdash;a matter of thirty-four years. <lb/>
Sometimes they cast him for a "speaking part," but not an <lb/>
elaborate one. He could be trusted to go and say, "My lord, <lb/>
the carriage waits," but if they ventured to add a sentence or <lb/>
two to this, his memory felt the strain and he was likely to <lb/>
miss fire. Yet, poor devil, he had been patiently studying <lb/>
<pb n="506" entity="DSSR_000002932_0509"/>
the part of Hamlet for more than thirty years, and he lived <lb/>
and died in the belief that some day he would be invited to <lb/>
play it!</p>
<p>And this is what came of that fleeting visit of those <lb/>
young Englishmen to our village such ages and ages ago! <lb/>
What noble horseshoes this man might have made, but for <lb/>
those <reg orig="Eng-|lishmen">Englishmen</reg>; <lb/>
and <lb/>
what an <reg orig="in-|adequate">inadequate</reg> <lb/>
<reg orig="Ro-|man">Roman</reg> <lb/>
soldier <lb/>
he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> make!</p>
<p>A day or <lb/>
two after <lb/>
we reached <lb/>
St. Louis, I <lb/>
was walking <lb/>
along Fourth <lb/>
Street when a <lb/>
grizzly-<reg orig="head-|ed">headed</reg> <lb/>
man gave <lb/>
a sort of <lb/>
start as he <lb/>
passed me, <lb/>
then stopped, <lb/>
came back, <lb/>
inspected me <lb/>
narrowly, with a clouding brow, and finally said with deep <lb/>
asperity:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Look here, <hi rend="italic">have you got that drink yet?</hi>"</p>
<figure id="f274" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0509">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"look here, have you got that drink yet?"</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>A maniac, I judged, at first. But all in a flash I <reg orig="recog-|nized">recognized</reg> <lb/>
him. I made an effort to blush that strained every <lb/>
muscle in me, and answered as sweetly and winningly as <lb/>
ever I knew how:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Been a little slow, but am just this minute closing in on <lb/>
the place where they keep it. Come in and help."</p>
<pb n="507" entity="DSSR_000002932_0510"/>
<p>He softened, and said make it a bottle of champagne and <lb/>
he was agreeable. He said he had seen my name in the <lb/>
papers, and had put all his affairs aside and turned out, <lb/>
resolved to find me or die; and make me answer that <reg orig="ques-|tion">question</reg> <lb/>
satisfactorily, or kill me; though the most of his late <lb/>
asperity had been rather counterfeit than otherwise.</p>
<p>This meeting brought back to me the St. Louis riots of <lb/>
about thirty years ago. I spent a week there, at that time, <lb/>
in a boarding-house, and had this young fellow for a <reg orig="neigh-|bor">neighbor</reg> <lb/>
across the hall. We saw some of the fightings and <reg orig="kill-|ings">killings</reg>; <lb/>
and by and by we went one night to an armory where <lb/>
two hundred young men had met, upon call, to be armed <lb/>
and go forth against the rioters, under command of a <reg orig="mili-|tary">military</reg> <lb/>
man. We drilled till about ten o'clock at night; then <lb/>
news came that the mob were in great force in the lower <lb/>
end of the town, and were sweeping everything before them. <lb/>
Our column moved at once. It was a very hot night, and <lb/>
my musket was very heavy. We marched and marched; <lb/>
and the nearer we approached the seat of war, the hotter I <lb/>
grew and the thirstier I got. I was behind my friend; so, <lb/>
finally, I asked him to hold my musket while I dropped out <lb/>
and got a drink. Then I branched off and went home. I <lb/>
was not feeling any solicitude about <hi rend="italic">him</hi> of course, because I <lb/>
knew he was so well armed, now, that he could take care of <lb/>
himself without any trouble. If I had had any doubts about <lb/>
that, I would have borrowed another musket for him. I left <lb/>
the city pretty early the next morning, and if this grizzled <lb/>
man had not happened to encounter my name in the papers <lb/>
the other day in St. Louis, and felt moved to seek me out; I <lb/>
should have carried to my grave a heart-torturing <reg orig="uncer-|tainty">uncertainty</reg> <lb/>
as to whether he ever got out of the riots all right or <lb/>
not. I ought to have inquired, thirty years ago; I know <lb/>
that. And I would have inquired, if I had had the muskets; <lb/>
but, in the circumstances, he seemed better fixed to conduct <lb/>
the investigations than I was.</p>
<p>One Monday, near the time of our visit to St. Louis, the <lb/>
<pb n="508" entity="DSSR_000002932_0511"/>
"Globe-Democrat" came out with a couple of pages of Sunday <lb/>
statistics, whereby it appeared that 119,448 St. Louis people <lb/>
attended the morning and evening church services the day <lb/>
before, and 23,102 children attended Sunday-school. Thus <lb/>
142,550 persons, out of the city's total of 400,000 <reg orig="popu-|lation">population</reg>, <lb/>
respected the day religious-wise. I found these <lb/>
statistics, in a condensed form, in a telegram of the <reg orig="Associ-|ated">Associated</reg> <lb/>
Press, and preserved them. They made it apparent <lb/>
that St. Louis was in a higher state of grace than she could <lb/>
have claimed to be in my time. But now that I canvass the <lb/>
figures narrowly, I suspect that the telegraph mutilated them. <lb/>
It cannot be that there are more than 150,000 Catholics in <lb/>
the town; the other 250,000 must be classified as <reg orig="Protest-|ants">Protestants</reg>. <lb/>
Out of these 250,000, according to this questionable <lb/>
telegram, only 26,362 attended church and Sunday-school, <lb/>
while out of the 150,000 Catholics, 116,188 went to church <lb/>
and Sunday-school.</p>

<head>A BURNING BRAND.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">All</hi> at once the thought came into my mind, "I have <lb/>
not sought out Mr. Brown."</p>
<p>Upon that text I desire to depart from the direct line of <lb/>
my subject, and make a little excursion. I wish to reveal <lb/>
a secret which I have carried with me nine years, and which <lb/>
has become burdensome.</p>
<p>Upon a certain occasion, nine years ago, I had said, with <lb/>
strong feeling, "If ever I see St. Louis again, I will seek out <lb/>
Mr. Brown, the great grain merchant, and ask of him the <lb/>
privilege of shaking him by the hand."</p>
<p>The occasion and the circumstances were as follows. A <lb/>
friend of mine, a clergyman, came one evening and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have a most remarkable letter here, which I want to <lb/>
read to you, if I can do it without breaking down. I must <lb/>
preface it with some explanations, however. The letter is <lb/>
written by an ex-thief and ex-vagabond of the lowest origin <lb/>
and basest rearing, a man all stained with crime and steeped <lb/>
in ignorance; but, thank God, with a mine of pure gold <reg orig="hid-|den">hidden</reg> <lb/>
away in him, as you shall see. His letter is written to <lb/>
a burglar named Williams, who is serving a nine-year term <lb/>
in a certain State prison, for burglary. Williams was a <lb/>
particularly daring burglar, and plied that trade during a <lb/>
number of years; but he was caught at last and jailed, to <lb/>
await trial in a town where he had broken into a house at <lb/>
night, pistol in hand, and forced the owner to hand over to <lb/>
<pb n="510" entity="DSSR_000002932_0513"/>
him $8,000 in government bonds. Williams was not a <reg orig="com-|mon">common</reg> <lb/>
sort of person, by any means; he was a graduate of <lb/>
Harvard College, and came of good New England stock. <lb/>
His father was a clergyman. While lying in jail, his health <lb/>
began to fail, and he was threatened with consumption. <lb/>
This fact, together with the opportunity for reflection <lb/>
afforded by solitary confinement, had its effect&mdash;its natural <lb/>
effect. He fell into serious thought; his early training <lb/>
asserted itself with power, and wrought with strong <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg> <lb/>
upon his mind and heart. He put his old life behind <lb/>
him, and became an earnest Christian. Some ladies in the <lb/>
town heard of this, visited him, and by their encouraging <lb/>
words supported him in his good resolutions and <reg orig="strength-|ened">strengthened</reg> <lb/>
him to continue in his new life. The trial ended in <lb/>
his conviction and sentence to the State prison for the term <lb/>
of nine years, as I have before said. In the prison he became <lb/>
acquainted with the poor wretch referred to in the beginning <lb/>
of my talk, Jack Hunt, the writer of the letter which I am <lb/>
going to read. You will see that the acquaintanceship bore <lb/>
fruit for Hunt. When Hunt's time was out, he wandered <lb/>
to St. Louis; and from that place he wrote his letter to <lb/>
Williams. The letter got no further than the office of the <lb/>
prison warden, of course; prisoners are not often allowed to <lb/>
receive letters from outside. The prison authorities read <lb/>
this letter, but did not destroy it. They had not the heart <lb/>
to do it. They read it to several persons, and eventually it <lb/>
fell into the hands of those ladies of whom I spoke a while <lb/>
ago. The other day I came across an old friend of mine&mdash; <lb/>
a clergyman&mdash;who had seen this letter, and was full of it. <lb/>
The mere remembrance of it so moved him that he could <lb/>
not talk of it without his voice breaking. He promised to <lb/>
get a copy of it for me; and here it is,&mdash;an exact copy, with <lb/>
all the imperfections of the original preserved. It has many <lb/>
slang expressions in it&mdash;thieves' <hi rend="italic">argot</hi>&mdash;but their meaning <lb/>
has been interlined, in parentheses, by the prison <reg orig='authori-|ties:"&mdash;"'>authorities:"&mdash;"</reg>

on the car i thought more of what you said to me, but didn't make <lb/>
up my mind. When we got to Chicago on the cars from there to <lb/>

i had n't no more than got it off when i wished i had n't done <lb/>
it, for awhile before that i made up my mind to be a square bloke, <lb/>

<pb n="512" entity="DSSR_000002932_0515"/>
was a grip (<hi rend="italic">easy to get</hi>)&mdash;but i kept clos to her &#x0026; when she got out <lb/>
of the cars at a way place i said, marm have you lost anything? &#x0026; <lb/>
she tumbled (<hi rend="italic">discovered</hi>) her leather was off (<hi rend="italic">gone</hi>)&mdash;is this it says <lb/>
i, giving it to her&mdash;well if you aint honest, says she, but i had nt <lb/>
got cheak enough to stand that sort of talk, so i left her in a hurry. <lb/>
When i got here i had $1 and 25 cents left &#x0026; i did n't get no work <lb/>
for 3 days as i aint strong enough for roust about on a steam bote</p>

again, when i thought of what you once said about a fellows <lb/>
calling on the Lord when he was in hard luck, &#x0026; i thought i would <lb/>
try it once anyhow, but <lb/>
when i tryed it i got <lb/>
stuck on the start, &#x0026; all <lb/>
i could get off wos, Lord <lb/>
give a poor fellow a <lb/>
chance to square it for 3 months for Christ's sake, amen; &#x0026; i kept a <lb/>
thinking, of it over and over as i went along&mdash;about an hour after <lb/>
that i was in 4th St. &#x0026; this is what happened &#x0026; is the cause of my <lb/>
being where i am now &#x0026; about which i will tell you before i get <lb/>
done writing. As i was walking along i herd a big noise &#x0026; saw <lb/>
a horse running away with a carriage with 2 children in it, &#x0026; I <lb/>
grabed up a peace of box cover from the side walk &#x0026; run in <lb/>
the middle of the street, &#x0026; when the horse came up i smashed him</p>

<p>over the head as hard as i could drive&mdash;the bord split to peces &#x0026; <lb/>
the horse checked up a little &#x0026; i grabbed the reigns &#x0026; pulled his <lb/>
head down until he stopped&mdash;the gentleman what owned him came <lb/>
running up &#x0026; soon as he saw the children were all rite, he shook <lb/>
hands with me &#x0026; gave me a $50 green back, &#x0026; my asking the Lord <lb/>
to help me come into my head, &#x0026; i was so thunderstruck i could n't <lb/>
drop the reigns nor say nothing&mdash;he saw something was up, &#x0026; <lb/>
coming back to me said, my boy are you hurt? &#x0026; the thought come <lb/>
into my head just then to ask him for work; &#x0026; i asked him to take <lb/>
back the bill and give me a job&mdash;says he, jump in here &#x0026; lets <lb/>
talk about it, but keep the money&mdash;he asked me if i could take <lb/>
care of horses &#x0026; i said yes, for i used to hang round livery stables <lb/>
&amp; often would help clean &#x0026; drive horses, he told me he wanted <lb/>
a man for that work, &#x0026; would give me $16. a month &#x0026; bord me. <lb/>
You bet i took that chance at once. that nite in my little room over <lb/>
the stable i sat a long time thinking over my past life &#x0026; of what <lb/>
had just happened &#x0026; i just got down on my nees &#x0026; thanked the <lb/>
Lord for the job &#x0026; to help me to square it, &#x0026; to bless you for <reg orig="put-|ting">putting</reg> <lb/>
me up to it, &#x0026; the next morning i done it again &#x0026; got me some <lb/>
new togs (<hi rend="italic">clothes</hi>) &#x0026; a bible for i <hi rend="italic">made up my mind</hi> after what the <lb/>
Lord had done for me i would read the bible every nite and <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>, <lb/>
&#x0026; ask him to keep an eye on me. When I had been there <lb/>
about a week Mr Brown (that's his name) came in my room one <lb/>
nite &#x0026; saw me reading the bible&mdash;he asked me if i was a Christian <lb/>
&amp; i told him no&mdash;he asked me how it was i read the bible instead <lb/>
of papers &#x0026; books&mdash;Well Charlie i thought i had better give him <lb/>
a square deal in the start, so i told him all about my being in prison <lb/>
&amp; about you, &#x0026; how i had almost done give up looking for work &#x0026; <lb/>
how the Lord got me the job when i asked him; &#x0026; the only way i <lb/>
had to pay him back was to read the bible &#x0026; square it, &#x0026; i asked <lb/>
him to give me a chance for 3 months&mdash;he talked to me like a <lb/>
father for a long time, &#x0026; told me i could stay &#x0026; then i felt better <lb/>
than ever i had done in my life, for i had given Mr. Brown a fair <lb/>
start with me &#x0026; now i did n't fear no one giving me a back cap <lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">exposing his past life</hi>) &#x0026; running me off the job&mdash;the next <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
he called me into the library &#x0026; gave me another square talk, <lb/>
&amp; advised me to study some every day, &#x0026; he would help me one or <lb/>
2 hours every nite, &#x0026; he gave me a Arithmetic, a spelling book, a <lb/>
Geography &#x0026; a writing book, &#x0026; he hers me every nite&mdash;he lets <lb/>
<pb n="515" entity="DSSR_000002932_0518"/>
me come into the house to prayers every morning, &#x0026; got me put in <lb/>
a bible class in the Sunday School which i likes very much for it <lb/>
helps me to understand my bible better.</p>
<p>Now, Charlie the 3 months on the square are up 2 months ago, <lb/>
&amp; as you said, it is the best job i ever did in my life, &#x0026; i commenced <lb/>
another of the same sort right away, only it is to God helping me <lb/>
to last a lifetime Charlie&mdash;i wrote this letter to tell you I do think <lb/>
God has forgiven my sins &#x0026; herd your prayers, for you told me you <lb/>

<p>Here was true eloquence; irresistible eloquence; and <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
a single grace or ornament to help it out. I have seldom <lb/>
<pb n="517" entity="DSSR_000002932_0520"/>
been so deeply stirred by any piece of writing. The reader <lb/>
of it halted, all the way through, on a lame and broken voice; <lb/>
yet he had tried to fortify his feelings by several private <lb/>
readings of the letter before venturing into company with it. <lb/>
He was practising upon me to see if there was any hope of his <lb/>
being able to read the document to his prayer-meeting with <lb/>
anything like a decent command over his feelings. The <lb/>
result was not promising. However, he determined to risk <lb/>
it; and did. He got through tolerably well; but his audience <lb/>
broke down early, and stayed in that condition to the end.</p>
<p>The fame of the letter spread through the town. A brother <lb/>
minister came and borrowed the manuscript, put it bodily into <lb/>
a sermon, preached the sermon to twelve hundred people on <lb/>
a Sunday morning, and the letter drowned them in their own <lb/>
tears. Then my friend put it into a sermon and went before <lb/>
his Sunday morning congregation with it. It scored another <lb/>
triumph. The house wept as one individual.</p>
<p>My friend went on summer vacation up into the fishing <lb/>
regions of our northern British neighbors, and carried this <lb/>
sermon with him, since he might possibly chance to need a <lb/>
sermon. He was asked to preach, one day. The little church <lb/>
was full. Among the people present were the late Dr. J. G. <lb/>
Holland, the late Mr. Seymour of the "New York Times," <lb/>
Mr. Page, the philanthropist and temperance advocate, and, I <lb/>
think, Senator Frye, of Maine. The marvellous letter did its <lb/>
wonted work; all the people were moved, all the people wept; <lb/>
the tears flowed in a steady stream down Dr. Holland's <lb/>
cheeks, and nearly the same can be said with regard to all <lb/>
who were there. Mr. Page was so full of enthusiasm over <lb/>
the letter that he said he would not rest until he made <reg orig="pil-|grimage">pilgrimage</reg> <lb/>
to that prison, and had speech with the man who had <lb/>
been able to inspire a fellow-unfortunate to write so priceless <lb/>
a tract.</p>
<p>Ah, that unlucky Page!&mdash;and another man. If they had <lb/>
only been in Jericho, that letter would have rung through <lb/>
the world and stirred all the hearts of all the nations for a <lb/>
<pb n="518" entity="DSSR_000002932_0521"/>
thousand years to come, and nobody might ever have found <lb/>
out that it was the confoundedest, brazenest, ingeniousest <lb/>
piece of fraud and humbuggery that was ever concocted to <lb/>
fool poor confiding mortals with!</p>
<p>The letter was a pure swindle, and that is the truth. And <lb/>
take it by and large, it was without a compeer among <reg orig="swin-|dles">swindles</reg>, <lb/>
It was perfect, it was rounded, symmetrical, complete, <lb/>
colossal!</p>
<p>The reader learns it at this point; but we did n't learn it <lb/>
till some miles and weeks beyond this stage of the affair. <lb/>
My friend came back from the woods, and he and other <lb/>
clergymen and lay missionaries began once more to inundate <lb/>
audiences with their tears and the tears of said audiences; I <lb/>
begged hard for permission to print the letter in a magazine <lb/>
and tell the watery story of its triumphs; numbers of people <lb/>
got copies of the letter, with permission to circulate them in <lb/>
writing, but not in print; copies were sent to the Sandwich <lb/>
Islands and other far regions.</p>
<p>Charles Dudley Warner was at church, one day, when the <lb/>
worn letter was read and wept over. At the church door, <lb/>
afterward, he dropped a peculiarly cold iceberg down the <lb/>
clergyman's back with the question,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Do you know that letter to be genuine?"</p>
<p>It was the first suspicion that had ever been voiced; but <lb/>
it had that sickening effect which first-uttered suspicions <lb/>
against one's idol always have. Some talk followed:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Why&mdash;what should make you suspect that it is n't <lb/>
genuine?"</p>
<p>"Nothing that I know of, except that it is too neat, and <lb/>
compact, and fluent, and nicely put together for an ignorant <lb/>
person, an unpractised hand. I think it was done by an <lb/>
educated man."</p>
<p>The literary artist had detected the literary machinery. If <lb/>
you will look at the letter now, you will detect it yourself&mdash; <lb/>
it is observable in every line.</p>
<p>Straightway the clergyman went off, with this seed of <lb/>
<pb n="519" entity="DSSR_000002932_0522"/>
suspicion sprouting in him, and wrote to a minister <reg orig="resid-|ing">residing</reg> <lb/>
in that town where Williams had been jailed and <lb/>
converted; asked for light; and also asked if a person <lb/>
in the literary line (meaning me) might be allowed to print <lb/>
the letter and tell its history. He presently received this <lb/>
answer:&mdash;</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">My Dear Friend,</hi>&mdash;In regard to that "convict's letter" there <lb/>
can be no doubt as to its genuineness. "Williams," to whom it <lb/>
was written, lay <lb/>
in our jail and <lb/>
professed to have <lb/>
been converted, <lb/>
and Rev. Mr.&mdash;, <lb/>
the chaplain, had <lb/>
great faith in the <lb/>
genuineness of the <lb/>
change&mdash;as much <lb/>
as one can have in <lb/>
any such case.</p>
<p>The letter was <lb/>
sent to one of our <lb/>
ladies, who is a <lb/>
Sunday-school <lb/>
teacher,&mdash;sent <lb/>
either by <reg orig="Wil-|liams">Williams</reg> <lb/>
himself, or <lb/>
the chaplain of <lb/>
the State's prison, <lb/>
probably. She <lb/>
has been greatly annoyed in having so much publicity, lest it <lb/>
might seem a breach of confidence, or be an injury to <reg orig="Wil-|liams">Williams</reg>. <lb/>
In regard to its publication, I can give no permission; <lb/>
though if the names and places were omitted, and especially if <lb/>
sent out of the country, I think you might take the responsibility <lb/>
and do it.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful letter, which no Christian genius, much less one <lb/>
unsanctified, could ever have written. As showing the work of <lb/>
<pb n="520" entity="DSSR_000002932_0523"/>
grace in a human heart, and in a very degraded and wicked one, it <lb/>
proves its own origin and reproves our weak faith in its power to <lb/>
cope with any form of wickedness.</p>

<seg type="postscript" rend="block">P. S. Williams is still in the State's prison, serving out a long <lb/>
sentence&mdash;of nine years, I think. He has been sick and threatened <lb/>
with consumption, but I have not inquired after him lately. This <lb/>
lady that I speak of corresponds with him, I presume, and will be <lb/>
quite sure to look after him.</seg>
</closer>
</div1></body></text></q>
<p>This letter arrived a few days after it was written&mdash;and <lb/>
up went Mr. Williams's stock again. Mr. Warner's <reg orig="low-|down">lowdown</reg> <lb/>
suspicion was laid in the cold, cold grave, where it <lb/>
apparently belonged. It was a suspicion based upon mere <lb/>
internal evidence, anyway; and when you come to internal <lb/>
evidence, it's a big field and a game that two can play at: <lb/>
as witness this other internal evidence, discovered by the <lb/>
writer of the note above quoted, that "it is a wonderful <lb/>
letter&mdash;which no Christian genius, much less one <reg orig="unsanc-|tified">unsanctified</reg>, <lb/>
could ever have written."</p>
<p>I had permission now to print&mdash;provided I suppressed <lb/>
names and places and sent my narrative out of the country. <lb/>
So I chose an Australian magazine for vehicle, as being far <lb/>
enough out of the country, and set myself to work on my <lb/>
article. And the ministers set the pumps going again, with <lb/>
the letter to work the handles.</p>
<p>But meantime Brother Page had been agitating. He had <lb/>
not visited the penitentiary, but he had sent a copy of the <lb/>
illustrious letter to the chaplain of that institution, and <lb/>
accompanied it with&mdash;apparently&mdash;inquiries. He got an <lb/>
answer, dated four days later than that other Brother's <lb/>
reassuring epistle; and before my article was complete, it <lb/>
wandered into my hands. The original is before me, now, <lb/>
and I here append it. It is pretty well loaded with internal <lb/>
evidence of the most solid description:&mdash;</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Bro. Page,</hi>&mdash;Herewith please find the letter kindly <lb/>
loaned me. I am afraid its genuineness cannot be established. It <lb/>
purports to be addressed to some prisoner here. No such letter <lb/>
ever came to a prisoner here. All letters received are carefully <lb/>
read by officers of the prison before they go into the hands of the <lb/>
convicts, and any such letter could not be forgotten. Again, Charles <lb/>
Williams is not a Christian man, but a dissolute, cunning prodigal, <lb/>
whose father is a minister of the gospel. His name is an assumed <lb/>
one. I am glad to have made your acquaintance. I am preparing <lb/>
a lecture upon life seen through prison bars, and should like to <lb/>
deliver the same in your vicinity.</p>
</div1></body></text></q>
<p>And so ended that little drama. My poor article went <lb/>
into the fire; for whereas the materials for it were now <lb/>
more abundant and infinitely richer than they had <reg orig="previ-|ously">previously</reg> <lb/>
been, there were parties all around me, who, although <lb/>
longing for the publication before, were a unit for <reg orig="suppres-|sion">suppression</reg> <lb/>
at this stage and complexion of the game. They said, <lb/>
&mdash;"Wait&mdash;the wound is too fresh, yet." All the copies of <lb/>
the famous letter except mine, disappeared suddenly; and <lb/>
from that time onward, the aforetime same old drought set <lb/>
in in the churches. As a rule, the town was on a spacious <lb/>
grin for a while, but there were places in it where the grin <lb/>
did not appear, and where it was dangerous to refer to the <lb/>
ex-convict's letter.</p>
<p>A word of explanation. "Jack Hunt," the professed <lb/>
writer of the letter, was an imaginary person. The burglar <lb/>
Williams&mdash;Harvard graduate, son of a minister&mdash;wrote the <lb/>
letter himself, <hi rend="italic">to</hi> himself: got it smuggled out of the prison; <lb/>
got it conveyed to persons who had supported and encouraged <lb/>
him in his conversion&mdash;where he knew two things would <lb/>
happen: the genuineness of the letter would not be doubted <lb/>
or inquired into; and the nub of it would be noticed, and <lb/>
would have valuable effect&mdash;the effect, indeed, of starting <lb/>
a movement to get Mr. Williams pardoned out of prison.</p>
<p>That "nub" is so ingeniously, so casually, flung in, and <lb/>
<pb n="522" entity="DSSR_000002932_0525"/>
immediately left there in the tail of the letter, undwelt upon, <lb/>
that an indifferent reader would never suspect that it was <lb/>
the heart and core of the epistle, if he even took note of it <lb/>
at all. This is the "nub":&mdash; <lb/>
<q>
<p>"i hope the warm weather is doing your lungs good&mdash;<hi rend="italic">i was <lb/>
afraid when you was bleeding you would die</hi>&mdash;give my respects," <lb/>
etc.</p>
</q>
</p>
<p>That is all there is of it&mdash;simply touch and go&mdash;no <lb/>
dwelling upon it. Nevertheless it was intended for an eye <lb/>
that would be swift to see it; and it was meant to move a <lb/>
kind heart to try to effect the liberation of a poor reformed <lb/>
and purified fellow lying in the fell grip of consumption.</p>
<p>When I for the first time heard that letter read, nine <lb/>
years ago, I felt that it was the most remarkable one I had <lb/>
ever encountered. And it so warmed me toward Mr. Brown <lb/>
of St. Louis that I said that if ever I visited that city again, <lb/>
I would seek out that excellent man and kiss the hem of <lb/>
his garment if it was a new one. Well, I visited St. Louis, <lb/>
but I did not hunt for Mr. Brown; for, alas! the <reg orig="investiga-|tions">investigations</reg> <lb/>
of long ago had proved that the benevolent Brown, <lb/>
like "Jack Hunt," was not a real person, but a sheer <reg orig="inven-|tion">invention</reg> <lb/>
of that gifted rascal, Williams&mdash;burglar, Harvard <reg orig="grad-|uate">graduate</reg>, <lb/>
son of a clergyman.</p>

<head>MY BOYHOOD'S HOME.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> took passage in one of the fast boats of the St. <lb/>
Louis and St. Paul Packet Company, and started <lb/>
up the river.</p>
<p>When I, as a boy, first saw the mouth of the Missouri <lb/>
River, it was twenty-two or twenty-three miles above St. <lb/>
Louis, according to the estimate of pilots; the wear and <lb/>
tear of the banks has moved it down eight miles since then; <lb/>
and the pilots say that within five years the river will cut <lb/>
through and move the mouth down five miles more, which <lb/>
will bring it within ten miles of St. Louis.</p>
<p>About nightfall we passed the large and flourishing town <lb/>
of Alton, Illinois; and before daylight next morning the <lb/>
town of Louisiana, Missouri, a sleepy village in my day, but <lb/>
a brisk railway centre now; however, all the towns out <lb/>
there are railway centres now. I could not clearly <reg orig="recog-|nize">recognize</reg> <lb/>
the place. This seemed odd to me, for when I retired <lb/>
from the rebel army in '61 I retired upon Louisiana in good <lb/>
order; at least in good enough order for a person who had <lb/>
not yet learned how to retreat according to the rules of war, <lb/>
and had to trust to native genius. It seemed to me that for <lb/>
a first attempt at a retreat it was not badly done. I had <lb/>
done no advancing in all that campaign that was at all equal <lb/>
to it.</p>
<p>There was a railway bridge across the river here well <lb/>
sprinkled with glowing lights, and a very beautiful sight it <lb/>
was.</p>
<pb n="524" entity="DSSR_000002932_0527"/>
<p>At seven in the morning we reached Hannibal, Missouri, <lb/>
where my boyhood was spent. I had had a glimpse of it <lb/>
fifteen years ago, and another glimpse six years earlier, but <lb/>
both were so brief that they hardly counted. The only <reg orig="no-|tion">notion</reg> <lb/>
of the town that remained in my mind was the memory <lb/>
of it as I had known it when I first quitted it twenty-nine <lb/>
years ago. That picture of it was still as clear and vivid to <lb/>
me as a photograph. I stepped ashore with the feeling of <lb/>
one who returns out of a dead-and-gone generation. I had <lb/>
a sort of realizing sense of what the Bastille prisoners must <lb/>
have felt when they used to come out and look upon Paris <lb/>
after years of captivity, and note how curiously the <reg orig="famil-|iar">familiar</reg> <lb/>
and the strange were mixed together before them. I <lb/>
saw the new houses&mdash;saw them plainly enough&mdash;but they <lb/>
did not affect the older picture in my mind, for through <lb/>
their solid bricks and mortar I saw the vanished houses, <lb/>
which had formerly stood there, with perfect distinctness.</p>
<p>It was Sunday morning, and everybody was abed yet. So <lb/>
I passed through the vacant streets, still seeing the town as <lb/>
it was, and not as it is, and recognizing and metaphorically <lb/>
shaking hands with a hundred familiar objects which no <lb/>
longer exist; and finally climbed Holiday's Hill to get a <lb/>
comprehensive view. The whole town lay spread out below <lb/>
me then, and I could mark and fix every locality, every <lb/>
detail. Naturally, I was a good deal moved. I said, "Many <lb/>
of the people I once knew in this tranquil refuge of my <lb/>
childhood are now in heaven; some, I trust, are in the other <lb/>
place."</p>
<p>The things about me and before me made me feel like a <lb/>
boy again&mdash;convinced me that I was a boy again, and that <lb/>
I had simply been dreaming an unusually long dream; but <lb/>
my reflections spoiled all that; for they forced me to say, <lb/>
"I see fifty old houses down yonder, into each of which I <lb/>
could enter and find either a man or a woman who was a <lb/>
baby or unborn when I noticed those houses last, or a <reg orig="grand-|mother">grandmother</reg> <lb/>
who was a plump young bride at that time."</p>
<pb n="525" entity="DSSR_000002932_0528"/>
<p>From this vantage ground the extensive view up and down <lb/>
the river, and wide over the wooded expanses of Illinois, is <lb/>
very beautiful,&mdash;one of the most beautiful on the <reg orig="Missis-|sippi">Mississippi</reg>, <lb/>
I think; which is a hazardous remark to make, for the <lb/>
eight hundred miles of river between St. Louis and St. Paul <lb/>
afford an unbroken succession of lovely pictures. It may be <lb/>
that my affection for the one in question biases my <reg orig="judg-|ment">judgment</reg> <lb/>
in its favor; I cannot say as to that. No matter, it <lb/>
was satisfyingly <lb/>
beautiful to me, <lb/>
and it had this <lb/>
advantage over <lb/>
all the other <lb/>
friends whom I <lb/>
was about to <lb/>
greet again: it <lb/>
had suffered no <lb/>
change; it was as <lb/>
young and fresh <lb/>
and comely and <lb/>
gracious as ever <lb/>
it had been; <lb/>
whereas, the faces <lb/>
of the others <lb/>
would be old, and <lb/>
scarred with the <lb/>
campaigns of life, <lb/>
and marked with their griefs and defeats, and would give <lb/>
me no upliftings of spirit.</p>

<p>An old gentleman, out on an early morning walk, came <lb/>
along, and we discussed the weather, and then drifted into <lb/>
other matters. I could not remember his face. He said he <lb/>
had been living here twenty-eight years. So he had come <lb/>
after my time, and I had never seen him before. I asked <lb/>
him various questions; first about a mate of mine in Sunday <lb/>
school&mdash;what became of him?</p>
<pb n="526" entity="DSSR_000002932_0529"/>
<p>"He graduated with honor in an Eastern college, <reg orig="wan-|dered">wandered</reg> <lb/>
off into the world somewhere, succeeded at nothing, <lb/>
passed out of knowledge and memory years ago, and is <reg orig="sup-|posed">supposed</reg> <lb/>
to have gone to the dogs."</p>
<p>"He was bright, and promised well when he was a boy."</p>
<p>"Yes, but the thing that happened is what became of it <lb/>
all."</p>
<p>I asked after another lad, altogether the brightest in our <lb/>
village school when I was a boy.</p>
<p>"He, too, was graduated with honors, from an Eastern <lb/>
college; but life whipped him in every battle, straight along, <lb/>
and he died in one of the Territories, years ago, a defeated <lb/>
man."</p>
<p>I asked after another of the bright boys.</p>
<p>"He is a success, always has been, always will be, I <lb/>
think."</p>
<p>I inquired after a young fellow who came to the town to <lb/>
study for one of the professions when I was a boy.</p>
<p>"He went at something else before he got through&mdash; <lb/>
went from medicine to law, or from law to medicine&mdash;then <lb/>
to some other new thing; went away for a year, came back <lb/>
with a young wife; fell to drinking, then to gambling behind <lb/>
the door; finally took his wife and two young children to <lb/>
her father's, and went off to Mexico; went from bad to <lb/>
worse, and finally died there, without a cent to buy a shroud, <lb/>
and without a friend to attend the funeral."</p>
<p>"Pity, for he was the best-natured, and most cheery and <lb/>
hopeful young fellow that ever was."</p>
<p>I named another boy.</p>
<p>"Oh, he is all right. Lives here yet; has a wife and <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg>, <lb/>
and is prospering."</p>
<p>Same verdict concerning other boys.</p>
<p>I named three school-girls.</p>
<p>"The first two live here, are married and have children; <lb/>
the other is long ago dead&mdash;never married."</p>
<p>I named, with emotion, one of my early sweethearts.</p>
<pb n="527" entity="DSSR_000002932_0530"/>
<p>"She is all right. Been married three times; buried two <lb/>
husbands, divorced from the third, and I hear she is getting <lb/>
ready to marry an old fellow out in Colorado somewhere. <lb/>
She's got children scattered around here and there, most <lb/>
everywheres."</p>
<p>The answer to several other inquiries was brief and <lb/>
simple,&mdash;</p> 
<p>"Killed in the war."</p>
<p>I named another boy.</p>
<p>"Well, now, his case <hi rend="italic">is</hi> curious! There was n't a human <lb/>
being in this town but knew that that boy was a perfect <lb/>
chucklehead; perfect dummy; just a stupid ass, as you may <lb/>
say. Everybody knew it, and everybody said it. Well, if <lb/>
that very boy is n't the first lawyer in the State of Missouri <lb/>
to-day, I'm a Democrat!"</p>
<p>"Is that so?"</p>
<p>"It's actually so. I'm telling you the truth."</p>
<p>"How do you account for it?"</p>
<p>"Account for it? There ain't any accounting for it, <reg orig="ex-|cept">except</reg> <lb/>
that if you send a damned fool to St. Louis, and you <lb/>
don't tell them he's a damned fool <hi rend="italic">they'll</hi> never find it out. <lb/>
There's one thing sure&mdash;if I had a damned fool I should <lb/>
know what to do with him: ship him to St. Louis&mdash;it's the <lb/>
noblest market in the world for that kind of property. Well, <lb/>
when you come to look at it all around, and chew at <lb/>
it and think it over, <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> it just bang anything you ever <lb/>
heard of?"</p>
<p>"Well, yes, it does seem to. But don't you think maybe <lb/>
it was the Hannibal people who were mistaken about the <lb/>
boy, and not the St. Louis people?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nonsense! The people here have known him from <lb/>
the very cradle&mdash;they knew him a hundred times better <lb/>
than the St. Louis idiots <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have known him. No, if you <lb/>
have got any damned fools that you want to realize on, take <lb/>
my advice&mdash;send them to St. Louis."</p>
<p>I mentioned a great number of people whom I had formerly <lb/>
<pb n="528" entity="DSSR_000002932_0531"/>
known. Some were dead, some were gone away, some had <lb/>
prospered, some had come to naught; but as regarded a dozen <lb/>
or so of the lot, the answer was comforting:</p>
<p>"Prosperous&mdash;live here yet&mdash;town littered with their <lb/>
children."</p>
<p>I asked about Miss&mdash;&mdash;.</p>
<p>"Died in the insane asylum three or four years ago&mdash; <lb/>
never was out of it from the time she went in; and was <lb/>
always suffering, <lb/>
too; never got a <lb/>
shred of her mind <lb/>
back."</p>
<p>If he spoke the <lb/>
truth, here was a <lb/>
heavy tragedy, <reg orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg>. <lb/>
Thirty-six <lb/>
years in a <reg orig="mad-|house">madhouse</reg>, <lb/>
that some <lb/>
young fools might <lb/>
have some fun! <lb/>
I was a small boy, <lb/>
at the time; and <lb/>
I saw those giddy <lb/>
young ladies <lb/>
come tiptoeing <lb/>
into the room <lb/>
where Miss&mdash;&mdash; <lb/>
sat reading at <lb/>
midnight by a lamp. The girl at the head of the file wore a <lb/>
shroud and a doughface; she crept behind the victim, touched <lb/>
her on the shoulder, and she looked up and screamed, and <lb/>
then fell into convulsions. She did not recover from the <lb/>
fright, but went mad. In these days it seems incredible that <lb/>
people believed in ghosts so short a time ago. But they did.</p>

<p>After asking after such other folk as I could call to mind, <lb/>
I finally inquired about <hi rend="italic">myself:</hi></p>
<pb n="529" entity="DSSR_000002932_0532"/>
<p>"Oh, he succeeded well enough&mdash;another case of damned <lb/>

<head>PAST AND PRESENT.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Being</hi> left to myself, up there, I went on picking out old <lb/>
houses in the distant town, and calling back their <lb/>
former inmates out of the mouldy past. Among them I <lb/>
presently recognized the house of the father of Lem Hackett <lb/>
(fictitious name). It carried me back more than a <reg orig="genera-|tion">generation</reg> <lb/>
in a moment, and landed me in the midst of a time <lb/>
when the happenings of life were not the natural and logical <lb/>
results of great general laws, but of special orders, and were <lb/>
freighted with very precise and distinct purposes&mdash;partly <lb/>
punitive in intent, partly admonitory; and usually local in <lb/>
application.</p>
<p>When I was a small boy, Lem Hackett was drowned&mdash;on <lb/>
a Sunday. He fell out of an empty flat-boat, where he was <lb/>
playing. Being loaded with sin, he went to the bottom like <lb/>
an anvil. He was the only boy in the village who slept that <lb/>
night. We others all lay awake, repenting. We had not <lb/>
needed the information, delivered from the pulpit that <lb/>
evening, that Lem's was a case of special judgment&mdash;we <lb/>
knew that, already. There was a ferocious thunder-storm, <lb/>
that night, and it raged continuously until near dawn. The <lb/>
winds blew, the windows rattled, the rain swept along the <lb/>
roof in pelting sheets, and at the briefest of intervals <lb/>
the inky blackness of the night vanished, the houses over <lb/>
the way glared out white and blinding for a quivering instant, <lb/>
then the solid darkness shut down again and a splitting peal <lb/>
of thunder followed which seemed to rend everything in the <lb/>
neighborhood to shreds and splinters. I sat up in bed <reg orig="quak-|ing">quaking</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="531" entity="DSSR_000002932_0534"/>
and shuddering, waiting for the destruction of the world, <lb/>
and expecting it. To me there was nothing strange or <lb/>
incongruous in <lb/>
heaven's making <lb/>
such an uproar <lb/>
about Lem <reg orig="Hack-|ett">Hackett</reg>. <lb/>
Apparently it <lb/>
was the right and <lb/>
proper thing to do. <lb/>
Not a doubt <reg orig="en-|tered">entered</reg> <lb/>
my mind that <lb/>
all the angels were <lb/>
grouped together, <lb/>
discussing this <lb/>
boy's case and <reg orig="ob-|serving">observing</reg> <lb/>
the awful <lb/>
bombardment of <lb/>
our beggarly little <lb/>
village with <reg orig="satis-|faction">satisfaction</reg> <lb/>
and approval. There was one thing which <reg orig="dis-|turbed">disturbed</reg> <lb/>
me in the most serious way; that was the thought <lb/>
that this centering of the celestial interest on our village <lb/>
could not fail to attract the attention of the observers to <lb/>
people among us who might otherwise have escaped notice <lb/>
for years. I felt that I was not only one of those people, <lb/>
but the very one most likely to be discovered. That discovery <lb/>
could have but one result: I should be in the fire with Lem <lb/>
before the chill of the river had been fairly warmed out of <lb/>
him. I knew that this would be only just and fair. I was <lb/>
increasing the chances against myself all the time, by feeling <lb/>
a secret bitterness against Lem for having attracted this <lb/>
fatal attention to me, but I could not help it&mdash;this sinful <lb/>
thought persisted in infesting my breast in spite of me. <lb/>
Every time the lightning glared I caught my breath, and <lb/>
judged I was gone. In my terror and misery, I meanly <lb/>
began to suggest other boys, and mention acts of theirs</p> 
<figure id="f284" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0534">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"i sat up in bed quaking."</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="532" entity="DSSR_000002932_0535"/>
<p>which were wickeder than mine, and peculiarly needed <lb/>
punishment&mdash;and I tried to pretend to myself that I was <lb/>
simply doing this in a casual way, and without intent to <lb/>
divert the heavenly attention to them for the purpose of <lb/>
getting rid of it myself. With deep sagacity I put these <lb/>
mentions into the form of sorrowing recollections and <reg orig="left-|handed">left-handed</reg> <lb/>
sham-supplications that the sins of those boys might <lb/>
be allowed to pass unnoticed&mdash;"Possibly they may repent." <lb/>
"It is true that Jim Smith broke a window and lied about it <lb/>
&mdash;but maybe he did not mean any harm. And although <lb/>
Tom Holmes says more bad words than any other boy in the <lb/>
village, he probably intends to repent&mdash;though he has never <lb/>
said he would. And whilst it is a fact that John Jones did <lb/>
fish a little on Sunday, once, he did n't really catch anything <lb/>
but only just one small useless mud-cat; and maybe that <lb/>
would n't have been so awful if he had thrown it back&mdash;as <lb/>
he says he did, but he did n't. Pity but they would repent <lb/>
of these dreadful things&mdash;and maybe they will yet."</p>
<p>But while I was shamefully trying to draw attention to <lb/>
these poor chaps&mdash;who were doubtless directing the celestial <lb/>
attention to me at the same moment, though I never once <lb/>
suspected that&mdash;I had heedlessly left my candle burning. <lb/>
It was not a time to neglect even trifling precautions. There <lb/>
was no occasion to add anything to the facilities for <reg orig="attract-|ing">attracting</reg> <lb/>
notice to me&mdash;so I put the light out.</p>
<p>It was a long night to me, and perhaps the most distressful <lb/>
one I ever spent. I endured agonies of remorse for sins <lb/>
which I knew I had committed, and for others which I was <lb/>
not certain about, yet was sure that they had been set down <lb/>
against me in a book by an angel who was wiser than I and <lb/>
did not trust such important matters to memory. It struck <lb/>
me, by and by, that I had been making a most foolish and <lb/>
calamitous mistake, in one respect: doubtless I had not only <lb/>
made my own destruction sure by directing attention to those <lb/>
other boys, but had already accomplished theirs!&mdash;Doubtless <lb/>
the lightning had stretched them all dead in their beds by <lb/>
<pb n="533" entity="DSSR_000002932_0536"/>
this time! The anguish and the fright which this thought <lb/>
gave me made my previous sufferings seem trifling by <lb/>
comparison.</p>
<p>Things had become truly serious. I resolved to turn over <lb/>
a new leaf instantly; I also resolved to connect myself with <lb/>
the church the next day, if I survived to see its sun appear. <lb/>
I resolved to cease from sin in all its forms, and to lead a <lb/>
high and blameless life forever after. I would be punctual <lb/>
at church and Sunday-school; visit the sick; carry baskets <lb/>
of victuals to the poor (simply to fulfil the regulation <reg orig="con-|ditions">conditions</reg>, <lb/>
although I knew we had none among us so poor <lb/>
but they would smash the basket over my head for my <lb/>
pains); I would instruct other boys in right ways, and take <lb/>
the resulting trouncings meekly; I would subsist entirely on <lb/>
tracts; I would invade the rum shop and warn the drunkard <lb/>
&mdash;and finally, if I escaped the fate of those who early <lb/>
become too good to live, I would go for a missionary.</p>
<p>The storm subsided toward daybreak, and I dozed gradually <lb/>
to sleep with a sense of obligation to Lem Hackett for going <lb/>
to eternal suffering in that abrupt way, and thus preventing <lb/>
a far more dreadful disaster&mdash;my own loss.</p>
<p>But when I rose refreshed, by and by, and found that those <lb/>
other boys were still alive, I had a dim sense that perhaps <lb/>
the whole thing was a false alarm; that the entire turmoil <lb/>
had been on Lem's account and nobody's else. The world <lb/>
looked so bright and safe that there did not seem to be any <lb/>
real occasion to turn over a new leaf. I was a little subdued, <lb/>
during that day, and perhaps the next; after that, my <lb/>
purpose of reforming slowly dropped out of my mind, and I <lb/>
had a peaceful, comfortable time again, until the next <lb/>
storm.</p>
<p>That storm came about three weeks later; and it was the <lb/>
most unaccountable one, to me, that I had ever experienced; <lb/>
for on the afternoon of that day, "Dutchy" was drowned. <lb/>
Dutchy belonged to our Sunday-school. He was a German <lb/>
lad who did not know enough to come in out of the rain; <lb/>
<pb n="534" entity="DSSR_000002932_0537"/>
but he was exasperatingly good, and had a prodigious <lb/>
memory. One Sunday he made himself the envy of all the <lb/>
youth and the talk of all the admiring village, by reciting <lb/>
three thousand verses of Scripture without missing a word; <lb/>
then he went off the very next day and got drowned.</p>
<figure id="f285" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0537">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"all right, dutchy&mdash;go ahead."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Circumstances gave to his death a peculiar impressiveness. <lb/>
We were all bathing in a muddy creek which had a deep hole <lb/>
in it, and in this hole the coopers had sunk a pile of green <lb/>
hickory hoop poles to soak, some twelve feet under water. <lb/>
We were diving and "seeing who could stay under longest." <lb/>
<pb n="535" entity="DSSR_000002932_0538"/>
We managed to remain down by holding on to the hoop poles. <lb/>
Dutchy made such a poor success of it that he was hailed <lb/>
with laughter and derision every time his head appeared <lb/>
above water. At last he seemed hurt with the taunts, and <lb/>
begged us to stand still on the bank and be fair with him <lb/>
and give him an honest count&mdash;"be friendly and kind just <lb/>
this once, and not miscount for the sake of having the fun <lb/>
of laughing at him." Treacherous winks were exchanged, <lb/>
and all said "All right, Dutchy&mdash;go ahead, we'll play <lb/>
fair."</p>
<p>Dutchy plunged in, but the boys, instead of beginning to <lb/>
count, followed the lead of one of their number and <lb/>
scampered to a range of blackberry bushes close by and hid <lb/>
behind it. They imagined Dutchy's humiliation, when he <lb/>
should rise after a superhuman effort and find the place <lb/>
silent and vacant, nobody there to applaud. They were "so <lb/>
full of laugh" with the idea, that they were continually <lb/>
exploding into muffled cackles. Time swept on, and <reg orig="pres-|ently">presently</reg> <lb/>
one who was peeping through the briers, said, with <lb/>
surprise:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Why, he hasn't come up, yet!"</p>
<p>The laughing stopped.</p>
<p>"Boys, it's a splendid dive," said one.</p>
<p>"Never mind that," said another, "the joke on him is all <lb/>
the better for it."</p>
<p>There was a remark or two more, and then a pause. <lb/>
Talking ceased, and all began to peer through the vines. <lb/>
Before long, the boys' faces began to look uneasy, then <lb/>
anxious, then terrified. Still there was no movement of the <lb/>
placid water. Hearts began to beat fast, and faces to turn <lb/>
pale. We all glided out, silently, and stood on the bank, our <lb/>
horrified eyes wandering back and forth from each other's <lb/>
countenances to the water.</p>
<p>"Somebody must go down and see!"</p>
<p>Yes, that was plain; but nobody wanted that grisly task.</p>
<p>"Draw straws!"</p>
<pb n="536" entity="DSSR_000002932_0539"/>
<p>So we did&mdash;with hands which shook so, that we hardly <lb/>
knew what we were about. The lot fell to me, and I went <lb/>
down. The water was so muddy I could not see anything, <lb/>
but I felt around among the hoop poles, and presently <lb/>
grasped a limp wrist <lb/>
which gave me no <lb/>
response&mdash;and if it <lb/>
had I should not have <lb/>
known it, I let it go <lb/>
with such a <reg orig="fright-|ened">frightened</reg> <lb/>
suddenness.</p>
<p>The boy had been <lb/>
caught among the <lb/>
hoop poles and <reg orig="en-|tangled">entangled</reg> <lb/>
there, <reg orig="help-|lessly">helplessly</reg>. <lb/>
I fled to the <lb/>
surface and told the <lb/>
awful news. Some <lb/>
of us knew that if <lb/>
the boy were dragged <lb/>
out at once he might <lb/>
possibly be <reg orig="resusci-|tated">resuscitated</reg>, <lb/>
but we never <lb/>
thought of that. We did not think of anything; we did <lb/>
not know what to do, so we did nothing&mdash;except that the <lb/>
smaller lads cried, piteously, and we all struggled <reg orig="fran-|tically">frantically</reg> <lb/>
into our clothes, putting on anybody's that came <lb/>
handy, and getting them wrong-side-out and upside-down, as <lb/>
a rule. Then we scurried away and gave the alarm, but <lb/>
none of us went back to see the end of the tragedy. We had <lb/>
a more important thing to attend to: we all flew home, and <lb/>
lost not a moment in getting ready to lead a better life.</p>
<figure id="f286" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0539">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"we all flew home."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>The night presently closed down. Then came on that <reg orig="tre-|mendous">tremendous</reg> <lb/>
and utterly unaccountable storm. I was perfectly <lb/>
dazed; I could not understand it. It seemed to me that <lb/>
there must be some mistake. The elements were turned <lb/>
<pb n="537" entity="DSSR_000002932_0540"/>
loose, and they rattled and banged and blazed away in the <lb/>
most blind and frantic manner. All heart and hope went <lb/>
out of me, and the dismal thought kept floating through my <lb/>
brain, "If a boy who knows three thousand verses by heart <lb/>
is not satisfactory, what chance is there for anybody else?"</p>
<p>Of course I never questioned for a moment that the <lb/>
storm was on Dutchy's account, or that he or any other <lb/>
inconsequential animal was worthy of such a majestic <lb/>
demonstration from on high; the lesson of it was the only <lb/>
thing that troubled me; for it convinced me that if Dutchy, <lb/>
with all his perfections, was not a delight, it would be vain <lb/>
for me to turn over a new leaf, for I must infallibly fall <lb/>
hopelessly short of that boy, no matter how hard I might <lb/>
try. Nevertheless I did turn it over&mdash;a highly educated fear <lb/>
compelled me to do that&mdash;but succeeding days of cheerfulness <lb/>
and sunshine came bothering around, and within a month I <lb/>
had so drifted backward that again I was as lost and <reg orig="com-|fortable">comfortable</reg> <lb/>
as ever.</p>
<p>Breakfast time approached while I mused these musings <lb/>
and called these ancient happenings back to mind; so I got <lb/>
me back into the present and went down the hill.</p>
<p>On my way through town to the hotel, I saw the house <lb/>
which was my home when I was a boy. At present rates, <lb/>
the people who now occupy it are of no more value than I <lb/>
am; but in my time they would have been worth not less <lb/>
than five hundred dollars apiece. They are colored folk.</p>
<p>After breakfast, I went out alone again, intending to hunt <lb/>
up some of the Sunday-schools and see how this generation <lb/>
of pupils might compare with their progenitors who had sat <lb/>
with me in those places and had probably taken me as a <lb/>
model&mdash;though I do not remember as to that now. By the <lb/>
public square there had been in my day a shabby little brick <lb/>
church called the "Old Ship of Zion," which I had attended <lb/>
as a Sunday-school scholar; and I found the locality easily <lb/>
enough, but not the old church; it was gone, and a trig and <lb/>
rather hilarious new edifice was in its place. The pupils <lb/>
<pb n="538" entity="DSSR_000002932_0541"/>
were better dressed and better looking than were those of my <lb/>
time; consequently they did not resemble their ancestors; <lb/>
and consequently there was nothing familiar to me in their <lb/>
faces. Still, I contemplated them with a deep interest and a <lb/>
yearning wistfulness, and if I had been a girl I would have <lb/>
cried; for they were the offspring, and represented, and <lb/>
occupied the places, of boys and girls some of whom I had <lb/>
loved to love, and some of whom I had loved to hate, but <lb/>
all of whom were dear to me for the one reason or the other, <lb/>
so many years gone by&mdash;and, Lord, where be they now!</p>
<p>I was mightily stirred, and would have been grateful to be <lb/>
allowed to remain unmolested and look my fill; but a <lb/>
bald-summited superintendent who had been a tow-headed <lb/>
Sunday-school mate of mine on that spot in the early ages, <lb/>
recognized me, and I talked a flutter of wild nonsense to <lb/>
those children to hide the thoughts which were in me, and <lb/>
which could not have been spoken without a betrayal of feeling <lb/>
that would have been recognized as out of character with <lb/>
me.</p>
<p>Making speeches without preparation is no gift of mine; <lb/>
and I was resolved to shirk any new opportunity, but in the <lb/>
next and larger Sunday-school I found myself in the rear of <lb/>
the assemblage; so I was very willing to go on the platform <lb/>
a moment for the sake of getting a good look at the scholars. <lb/>
On the spur of the moment I could not recall any of the old <lb/>
idiotic talks which visitors used to insult me with when I <lb/>
was a pupil there; and I was sorry for this, since it would <lb/>
have given me time and excuse to dawdle there and take a <lb/>
long and satisfying look at what I feel at liberty to say was <lb/>
an array of fresh young comeliness not matchable in another <lb/>
Sunday-school of the same size. As I talked merely to get <lb/>
a chance to inspect; and as I strung out the random rubbish <lb/>
solely to prolong the inspection, I judged it but decent to <lb/>
confess these low motives, and I did so.</p>
<p>If the Model Boy was in either of these Sunday-schools, <lb/>
I did not see him. The Model Boy of my time&mdash;we never <lb/>
<pb n="539" entity="DSSR_000002932_0542"/>
had but the one&mdash;was perfect: <lb/>
perfect in manners, perfect in <lb/>
dress, perfect in conduct, perfect in filial piety, perfect in <lb/>
exterior godliness; but at bottom he was a prig; and as <lb/>
for the contents of his skull, they could have changed place <lb/>
with the contents of a pie and nobody would have been the <lb/>
worse off for it but the pie. This fellow's reproachlessness <lb/>
was a standing reproach to every lad in the village. He was <lb/>
the admiration of all the mothers, and the detestation of all <lb/>
their sons. I was told what became of him, but as it was a <lb/>
disappointment to me, I will not enter into details. He <lb/>
succeeded in life.</p>

<head>A VENDETTA AND OTHER THINGS.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">During</hi> my three days' stay in the town, I woke up <lb/>
every morning with the impression that I was a boy <lb/>
&mdash;for in my dreams the faces were all young again, and <lb/>
looked as they had looked in the old times&mdash;but I went to <lb/>
bed a hundred years old, every night&mdash;for meantime I had <lb/>
been seeing those faces as they are now.</p>
<p>Of course I suffered some surprises, along at first, before I <lb/>
had become adjusted to the changed state of things. I met <lb/>
young ladies who did not seem to have changed at all; but <lb/>
they turned out to be the daughters of the young ladies I had <lb/>
in mind&mdash;sometimes their grand-daughters. When you are <lb/>
told that a stranger of fifty is a grandmother, there is nothing <lb/>
surprising about it; but if, on the contrary, she is a person <lb/>
whom you knew as a little girl, it seems impossible. You <lb/>
say to yourself, "How can a little girl be a grandmother?" <lb/>
It takes some little time to accept and realize the fact that <lb/>
while you have been growing old, your friends have not been <lb/>
standing still, in that matter.</p>
<p>I noticed that the greatest changes observable were with <lb/>
the women, not the men. I saw men whom thirty years had <lb/>
changed but slightly; but their wives had grown old. These <lb/>
were good women; it is very wearing to be good.</p>
<p>There was a saddler whom I wished to see; but he was <lb/>
gone. Dead, these many years, they said. Once or twice a <lb/>
day, the saddler used to go tearing down the street, putting <lb/>
<pb n="541" entity="DSSR_000002932_0544"/>
on his coat as he went; and then everybody knew a <reg orig="steam-|boat">steamboat</reg> <lb/>
was coming. Everybody knew, also, that John Stavely <lb/>
was not expecting anybody by the boat&mdash;or any freight, <lb/>
either; and Stavely must have known that everybody knew <lb/>
this, still it made no difference to him; he liked to seem to <lb/>
himself to be expecting a hundred thousand tons of saddles <lb/>
by this boat, and so he went on all his life, enjoying being <lb/>
faithfully on hand to receive and receipt for those saddles, <lb/>
in case by any miracle they should come. A malicious <lb/>
Quincy paper used always to refer to this town, in derision <lb/>
as "Stavely's Landing." Stavely was one of my earliest <lb/>
admirations; I envied him his rush of imaginary business, <lb/>
and the display he was able to make of it, before strangers, <lb/>
as he went flying down the street struggling with his <lb/>
fluttering coat.</p>
<p>But there was a carpenter who was my chiefest hero. <lb/>
He was a mighty liar, but I did not know that; I believed <lb/>
everything he said. He was a romantic, sentimental, <reg orig="melo-|dramatic">melodramatic</reg> <lb/>
fraud, and his bearing impressed me with awe. I <lb/>
vividly remember the first time he took me into his confidence. <lb/>
He was planing a board, and every now and then he would <lb/>
pause and heave a deep sigh; and occasionally mutter broken <lb/>
sentences&mdash;confused and not intelligible&mdash;but out of their <lb/>
midst an ejaculation sometimes escaped which made me <lb/>
shiver and did me good: one was, "O God, it is his blood!" <lb/>
I sat on the tool-chest and humbly and shudderingly admired <lb/>
him; for I judged he was full of crime. At last he said in a <lb/>
low voice:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My little friend, can you keep a secret?"</p>
<p>I eagerly said I could.</p>
<p>"A dark and dreadful one?"</p>
<p>I satisfied him on that point.</p>
<p>"Then I will tell you some passages in my history; for oh, <lb/>
I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> relieve my burdened soul, or I shall die!"</p>
<p>He cautioned me once more to be "as silent as the grave;" <lb/>
then he told me he was a "red-handed murderer." He put <lb/>
<pb n="542" entity="DSSR_000002932_0545"/>
down his plane, held his hands out before him, contemplated <lb/>
them sadly, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Look&mdash;with these hands I have taken the lives of thirty <lb/>
human beings!"</p>
<p>The effect which this had upon me was an inspiration to <lb/>
him, and he turned himself loose upon his subject with <reg orig="inter-|est">interest</reg> <lb/>
and energy. He left generalizing, and went into details, <lb/>
&mdash;began with his first murder; described it, told what <reg orig="meas-|ures">measures</reg> <lb/>
he had taken to avert suspicion; then passed to his <lb/>
second homicide, his third, his fourth, and so on. He had <lb/>
always done his murders with a bowie-knife, and he made <lb/>
all my hairs rise by suddenly snatching it out and showing <lb/>
it to me.</p>
<p>At the end of this first <hi rend="italic">s&eacute;ance</hi> I went home with six of his <lb/>
fearful secrets among my freightage, and found them a great <lb/>
help to my dreams, which had been sluggish for a while <lb/>
back. I sought him again and again, on my Saturday <reg orig="holi-|days">holidays</reg>; <lb/>
in fact I spent the summer with him&mdash;all of it which <lb/>
was valuable to me. His fascinations never diminished, for <lb/>
he threw something fresh and stirring, in the way of horror, <lb/>
into each successive murder. He always gave names, dates, <lb/>
places&mdash;everything. This by and by enabled me to note <lb/>
two things: that he had killed his victims in every quarter <lb/>
of the globe, and that these victims were always named <lb/>
Lynch. The destruction of the Lynches went serenely on, <lb/>
Saturday after Saturday, until the original thirty had <reg orig="multi-|plied">multiplied</reg> <lb/>
to sixty,&mdash;and more to be heard from yet; then my <lb/>
curiosity got the better of my timidity, and I asked how it <lb/>
happened that these justly punished persons all bore the same <lb/>
name.</p>
<p>My hero said he had never divulged that dark secret to any <lb/>
living being; but felt that he could trust me, and therefore <lb/>
he would lay bare before me the story of his sad and blighted <lb/>
life. He had loved one "too fair for earth," and she had <lb/>
reciprocated "with all the sweet affection of her pure and <lb/>
noble nature." But he had a rival, a "base hireling" named <lb/>
<pb n="543" entity="DSSR_000002932_0546"/>
Archibald Lynch, who said the girl should be his, or he <lb/>
would "dye his hands in her heart's best blood." The <reg orig="car-|penter">carpenter</reg>, <lb/>
"innocent and <reg orig="hap-|py">happy</reg> <lb/>
in love's young dream," <lb/>
gave no weight to the threat, <lb/>
but led his "golden-haired <lb/>
darling to the altar," and <lb/>
there, the two were made <lb/>
one; there also, just as the <lb/>
minister's hands were <lb/>
stretched in blessing over <lb/>
their heads, the fell deed <lb/>
was done&mdash;with a knife&mdash; <lb/>
and the bride fell a corpse <lb/>
at her husband's feet. And <lb/>
what did the husband do? <lb/>
He plucked forth that knife, <lb/>
and kneeling by the body of <lb/>
his lost one, swore to "<reg orig="con-|secrate">consecrate</reg> <lb/>
his life to the extermination of all the human scum <lb/>
that bear the hated name of Lynch."</p>
<figure id="f288" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0546">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">the consecrated knife.</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="544" entity="DSSR_000002932_0547"/>
<p>That was it. He had been hunting down the Lynches and <lb/>
slaughtering them, from that day to this&mdash;twenty years. He <lb/>
had always used that same consecrated knife; with it he had <lb/>
murdered his long array of Lynches, and with it he had left <lb/>
upon the forehead of each victim a peculiar mark&mdash;a cross, <lb/>
deeply incised. Said he:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The cross of the Mysterious Avenger is known in Europe, <lb/>
in America, in China, in Siam, in the Tropics, in the Polar <lb/>
Seas, in the deserts of Asia, in all the earth. Wherever in <lb/>
the uttermost parts of the globe, a Lynch has penetrated, <lb/>
there has the Mysterious Cross been seen, and those who <lb/>
have seen it have shuddered and said, 'it is his mark, he <lb/>
has been here.' You have heard of the Mysterious Avenger <lb/>
&mdash;look upon him, for before you stands no less a person! <lb/>
But beware&mdash;breathe not a word to any soul. Be silent, <lb/>
and wait. Some morning this town will flock aghast to view <lb/>
a gory corpse; on its brow will be seen the awful sign, and <lb/>
men will tremble and whisper, 'he has been here,&mdash;it is the <lb/>
Mysterious Avenger's mark!' You will come here, but I <lb/>
shall have vanished; you will see me no more."</p>
<p>This ass has been reading the "Jibbenainosay," no doubt, <lb/>
and had had his poor romantic head turned by it; but as I had <lb/>
not yet seen the book then, I took his inventions for truth, <lb/>
and did not suspect that he was a plagiarist.</p>
<p>However, we had a Lynch living in the town; and the <lb/>
more I reflected upon his impending doom, the more I could <lb/>
not sleep. It seemed my plain duty to save him, and a still <lb/>
plainer and more important duty to get some sleep for <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg>, <lb/>
so at last I ventured to go to Mr. Lynch and tell him <lb/>
what was about to happen to him&mdash;under strict secrecy. I <lb/>
advised him to "fly," and certainly expected him to do it. <lb/>
But he laughed at me; and he did not stop there; he led me <lb/>
down to the carpenter's shop, gave the carpenter a jeering <lb/>

face, made him get down on his knees and beg&mdash;then went <lb/>
off and left me to contemplate the cheap and pitiful ruin of <lb/>
<pb n="545" entity="DSSR_000002932_0548"/>
what, in my eyes, had so lately been a majestic and <reg orig="incom-|parable">incomparable</reg> <lb/>
hero. The carpenter blustered, flourished his knife, <lb/>
and doomed this Lynch in his <lb/>
usual volcanic style, the size of <lb/>
his fateful words undiminished; <lb/>
but it was all wasted <lb/>
upon me; he was a <lb/>
hero to me no longer <lb/>
but only a poor, <reg orig="fool-|ish">foolish</reg>, <lb/>
exposed humbug. <lb/>
I was ashamed of him, <lb/>
and ashamed of <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg>; <lb/>
I took no <reg orig="fur-|ther">further</reg> <lb/>
interest in him, <lb/>
and never went to his <lb/>
shop any more. He <lb/>
was a heavy loss to me, for he was the greatest hero I had <lb/>
ever known. The fellow must have had some talent; for <lb/>
some of his imaginary murders were so vividly and <reg orig="dramat-|ically">dramatically</reg> <lb/>
described that I remember all their details yet.</p>

<p>The people of Hannibal are not more changed than is the <lb/>
town. It is no longer a village; it is a city, with a mayor, <lb/>
and a council, and water-works, and probably a debt. It has <lb/>
fifteen thousand people, is a thriving and energetic place, <lb/>
and is paved like the rest of the west and south&mdash;where a <lb/>
well-paved street and a good sidewalk are things so seldom <lb/>
<pb n="546" entity="DSSR_000002932_0549"/>
seen, that one doubts them when he does see them. The <lb/>
customary half-dozen railways centre in Hannibal now, and <lb/>
there is a new depot which cost a hundred thousand dollars. <lb/>
In my time the town had no specialty, and no commercial <lb/>
grandeur; the daily packet usually landed a passenger and <lb/>
bought a catfish, and took away another passenger and a <lb/>
hatful of freight; but now a huge commerce in lumber has <lb/>
grown up and a large miscellaneous commerce is one of the <lb/>
results. A deal of money changes hands there now.</p>

<p>Bear Creek&mdash;so called, perhaps, because it was always so <lb/>
particularly bare of bears&mdash;is hidden out of sight now, <lb/>
under islands and <lb/>
continents of piled <lb/>
lumber, and <lb/>
nobody but <lb/>
an expert <lb/>
can find it. I used <lb/>
to get drowned in <lb/>
it every summer <lb/>
regularly, and be <lb/>
drained out, and inflated and set going again by some <lb/>
chance enemy; but not enough of it is unoccupied now to <lb/>
drown a person in. It was a famous breeder of chills and <lb/>
fever in its day. I remember one summer when everybody <lb/>
in town had this disease at once. Many chimneys were <lb/>
<pb n="547" entity="DSSR_000002932_0550"/>
shaken down, and all the houses were so racked that the <lb/>
town had to be rebuilt. The chasm or gorge between <lb/>
Lover's Leap and the hill west of it is supposed by <reg orig="scien-|tists">scientists</reg> <lb/>
to have been caused by glacial action. This is a <lb/>
mistake.</p>
<p>There is an interesting cave a mile or two below <reg orig="Hanni-|bal">Hannibal</reg>, <lb/>
among the bluffs. I would have liked to revisit it, <lb/>
but had not time. In my time the person who then owned <lb/>
it turned it into a mausoleum for his daughter, aged <reg orig="four-|teen">fourteen</reg>. <lb/>
The body of this poor child was put into a copper <lb/>
cylinder filled with alcohol, and this was suspended in one <lb/>
of the dismal avenues of the cave. The top of the cylinder <lb/>
was removable; and it was said to be a common thing for <lb/>
the baser order of tourists to drag the dead face into view <lb/>
and examine it and comment upon it.</p>

<head>A QUESTION OF LAW.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> slaughter-house is gone from the mouth of Bear <lb/>
Creek and so is the small jail (or "calaboose") which <lb/>
once stood in its neighborhood. A citizen asked, "Do you <lb/>
remember when Jimmy Finn, the town drunkard, was burned <lb/>
to death in the calaboose?"</p>
<p>Observe, now, how history becomes defiled, through lapse <lb/>
of time and the help of the bad memories of men. Jimmy <lb/>
Finn was not burned in the calaboose, but died a natural <lb/>
death in a tan vat, of a combination of delirium tremens and <lb/>
spontaneous combustion. When I say natural death, I mean <lb/>
it was a natural death for Jimmy Finn to die. The calaboose <lb/>
victim was not a citizen; he was a poor stranger, a harmless <lb/>
whiskey-sodden tramp. I know more about his case than <lb/>
anybody else; I knew too much of it, in that bygone day, to <lb/>
relish speaking of it. That tramp was wandering about the <lb/>
streets one chilly evening, with a pipe in his mouth, and <lb/>
begging for a match; he got neither matches nor courtesy; <lb/>
on the contrary, a troop of bad little boys followed him <lb/>
around and amused themselves with nagging and annoying <lb/>
him. I assisted; but at last, some appeal which the <reg orig="way-|farer">wayfarer</reg> <lb/>
made for forbearance, accompanying it with a pathetic <lb/>
reference to his forlorn and friendless condition, touched <lb/>
such sense of shame and remnant of right feeling as were left <lb/>
in me, and I went away and got him some matches, and then <lb/>
hied me home and to bed, heavily weighted as to conscience, <lb/>
and unbuoyant in spirit. An hour or two afterward, the man <lb/>
<pb n="549" entity="DSSR_000002932_0552"/>
was arrested and locked up in the calaboose by the marshal <lb/>
&mdash;large name for a constable, but that was his title. At two <lb/>
in the morning, the church bells rang for fire, and everybody <lb/>
turned out, of course&mdash;I with the rest. The tramp had used <lb/>
his matches disastrously: he had set his straw bed on fire, <lb/>
and the oaken sheathing of the room had caught. When I <lb/>
reached the ground, two hundred men, women, and children <lb/>
stood massed together, transfixed with horror, and staring <lb/>
at the grated windows of the jail. Behind the iron bars, and <lb/>
tugging frantically at them, and screaming for help, stood <lb/>
the tramp; he seemed like a black object set against a sun, <lb/>
so white and intense was the light at his back. That <reg orig="mar-|shal">marshal</reg> <lb/>
could not be found, and he had the only key. A <reg orig="batter-|ing-ram">battering-ram</reg> <lb/>
was quickly improvised, and the thunder of its blows <lb/>
upon the door had so encouraging a sound that the spectators <lb/>
broke into wild cheering, and believed the merciful battle <lb/>
won. But it was not so. The timbers were too strong; <lb/>
they did not yield. It was said that the man's death-grip <lb/>
still held fast to the bars after he was dead; and that in <lb/>
this position the fires wrapped him about and consumed him. <lb/>
As to this, I do not know. What was seen after I recognized <lb/>
the face that was pleading through the bars was seen by <lb/>
others, not by me.</p>
<p>I saw that face, so situated, every night for a long time <lb/>
afterward; and I believed myself as guilty of the man's <lb/>
death as if I had given him the matches purposely that he <lb/>
might burn himself up with them. I had not a doubt that I <lb/>
should be hanged if my connection with this tragedy were <lb/>
found out. The happenings and the impressions of that time <lb/>
are burnt into my memory, and the study of them entertains <lb/>
me as much now as they themselves distressed me then. If <lb/>
anybody spoke of that grisly matter, I was all ears in a <lb/>
moment, and alert to hear what might be said, for I was <lb/>
always dreading and expecting to find out that I was <reg orig="sus-|pected">suspected</reg>; <lb/>
and so fine and so delicate was the perception of my <lb/>
guilty conscience, that it often detected suspicion in the most <lb/>
<pb n="550" entity="DSSR_000002932_0553"/>
purposeless remarks, and in looks, gestures, glances of the <lb/>
eye which had no significance, but which sent me shivering <lb/>
away in a panic of fright, just the same. And how sick it <lb/>
made me when somebody dropped, howsoever carelessly and <lb/>
barren of intent, the remark that "murder will out!" For <lb/>
a boy of ten years, I was carrying a pretty weighty cargo.</p>
<p>All this time I was blessedly forgetting one thing&mdash;the <lb/>
fact that I was an inveterate talker in my sleep. But one <lb/>
night I awoke and found my bed-mate&mdash;my younger brother <lb/>
&mdash;sitting up in bed and contemplating me by the light of <lb/>
the moon. I said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What is the <lb/>
matter?"</p>
<p>"You talk so <lb/>
much I can't <lb/>
sleep."</p>
<p>I came to a <reg orig="sit-|ting">sitting</reg> <lb/>
posture in <lb/>
an instant, with <lb/>
my kidneys in my <lb/>
throat and my <lb/>
hair on end.</p>
<p>"What did I <lb/>
say? Quick&mdash;out <lb/>
with it&mdash;what did <lb/>
I say?"</p>
<figure id="f292" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0553">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">i tamper with my conscience.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"Nothing much."</p>
<p>"It's a lie&mdash;you know everything."</p>
<p>"Everything about what?"</p>
<p>"You know well enough. About <hi rend="italic">that.</hi>"</p>
<p>"About <hi rend="italic">what?</hi>&mdash;I don't know what you are talking about. <lb/>
I think you are sick or crazy or something. But anyway, <lb/>
you're awake, and I'll get to sleep while I've got a chance."</p>
<p>He fell asleep and I lay there in a cold sweat, turning this <lb/>
new terror over in the whirling chaos which did duty as my <lb/>
mind. The burden of my thought was, How much did I <lb/>
<pb n="551" entity="DSSR_000002932_0554"/>
divulge? How much does he know?&mdash;what a distress is <lb/>
this uncertainty! But by and by I evolved an idea&mdash;I would <lb/>
wake my brother and probe him with a supposititious case. <lb/>
I shook him up, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Suppose a man should come to you drunk&mdash;"</p>
<p>"This is foolish&mdash;I never get drunk."</p>
<p>"I don't mean you, idiot&mdash;I mean the man. Suppose a <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">man</hi> should come to you drunk, and borrow a knife, or a <lb/>
tomahawk, or a pistol, and you forgot to tell him it was <lb/>
loaded, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"How could you load a tomahawk?"</p>
<p>"I don't mean the tomahawk, and I did n't <hi rend="italic">say</hi> the <reg orig="toma-|hawk">tomahawk</reg>; <lb/>
I said the pistol. Now don't you keep breaking in that <lb/>
way, because this is serious. There's been a man killed."</p>
<p>"What! In this town?"</p>
<p>"Yes, in this town."</p>
<p>"Well, go on&mdash;I won't say a single word."</p>
<p>"Well, then, suppose you forgot to tell him to be careful <lb/>
with it, because it was loaded, and he went off and shot <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
with that pistol,&mdash;fooling with it, you know, and <reg orig="prob-|ably">probably</reg> <lb/>
doing it by accident, being drunk. Well, would it be <lb/>
murder?"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;suicide."</p>
<p>"No, no. I don't mean <hi rend="italic">his</hi> act, I mean yours: would you <lb/>
be a murderer for letting him have that pistol?"</p>
<p>After deep thought came this answer,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, I should think I was guilty of something&mdash;maybe <lb/>
murder&mdash;yes, probably murder, but I don't quite know."</p>
<p>This made me very uncomfortable. However, it was not <lb/>
a decisive verdict. I should have to set out the real case&mdash; <lb/>
there seemed to be no other way. But I would do it <reg orig="cau-|tiously">cautiously</reg>, <lb/>
and keep a watch out for suspicious effects. I <lb/>
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I was supposing a case, but I am coming to the real one <lb/>
now. Do you know how the man came to be burned up in <lb/>
the calaboose?"</p>
<pb n="552" entity="DSSR_000002932_0555"/>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Have n't you the least idea?"</p>
<p>"Not the least."</p>
<p>"Wish you may die in your tracks if you have?"</p>
<p>"Yes, wish I may die in my tracks."</p>
<p>"Well, the way of it was this. The man wanted some <lb/>
matches to light his pipe. A boy got him some. The man <lb/>
set fire to the calaboose with those very matches, and burnt <lb/>
himself up."</p>
<p>"Is that so?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is. Now, is that boy a murderer, do you think?"</p>
<p>"Let me see. The man was drunk?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he was drunk."</p>
<p>"Very drunk?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And the boy knew it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he knew it."</p>
<p>There was a long pause. Then came this heavy <reg orig="ver-|dict:&mdash;">verdict:&mdash;</reg></p>
<p>"If the man was drunk, and the boy knew it, the boy <lb/>
murdered that man. This is certain."</p>
<p>Faint, sickening sensations crept along all the fibres of my <lb/>
body, and I seemed to know how a person feels who hears <lb/>
his death sentence pronounced from the bench. I waited <lb/>
to hear what my brother would say next. I believed I knew <lb/>
what it would be, and I was right. He said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"I know the boy."</p>
<p>I had nothing to say; so I said nothing. I simply <reg orig="shud-|dered">shuddered</reg>. <lb/>
Then he added,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Yes, before you got half through telling about the <lb/>
thing, I knew perfectly well who the boy was; it was <lb/>
Ben Coontz!"</p>
<p>I came out of my collapse as one who rises from the dead. <lb/>
I said, with admiration:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Why, how in the world did you ever guess it?"</p>
<p>"You told it in your sleep."</p>
<pb n="553" entity="DSSR_000002932_0556"/>
<p>I said to myself, "How splendid that is! This is a habit <lb/>
which must be cultivated."</p>
<p>My brother rattled innocently on:&mdash;</p>
<p>"When you were talking in your sleep, you kept mumbling <lb/>
something about 'matches,' which I could n't make anything <lb/>
out of; but just now, when you began to tell me about the <lb/>
man and the calaboose and the matches, I remembered that <lb/>
in your sleep you mentioned Ben Coontz two or three times; <lb/>
so I put this and that together, you see, and right away I <lb/>
knew it was Ben that burnt that man up."</p>
<p>I praised his <reg orig="sa-|gacity">sagacity</reg> <lb/>
effusively. <lb/>
Presently he <lb/>
asked,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Are you going <lb/>
to give him up to <lb/>
the law?"</p>
<p>"No," I said; <lb/>
"I believe that <lb/>
this will be a <lb/>
lesson to him. <lb/>
I shall keep an <lb/>
eye on him, of <lb/>
course, for that is <lb/>
but right; but if <lb/>
he stops where he is and reforms, it shall never be said that <lb/>
I betrayed him."</p>

</figure>
<p>"How good you are!"</p>
<p>"Well, I try to be. It is all a person can do in a world <lb/>
like this."</p>
<p>And now, my burden being shifted to other shoulders, my <lb/>
terrors soon faded away.</p>
<p>The day before we left Hannibal, a curious thing fell under <lb/>
my notice,&mdash;the surprising spread which longitudinal time <lb/>
undergoes there. I learned it from one of the most <reg orig="unosten-|tatious">unostentatious</reg> <lb/>
of men,&mdash;the colored coachman of a friend of mine, <lb/>
<pb n="554" entity="DSSR_000002932_0557"/>
who lives three miles from town. He was to call for me at <lb/>
the Park Hotel at 7.30 <hi rend="small-caps">p. m.,</hi> and drive me out. But he <lb/>
missed it considerably,&mdash;did not arrive till ten. He <reg orig="ex-|cused">excused</reg> <lb/>

<head>AN ARCHANGEL.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">From</hi> St. Louis northward there are all the enlivening <lb/>
signs of the presence of active, energetic, intelligent, <lb/>
prosperous, practical nineteenth-century populations. The <lb/>
people don't dream, they work. The happy result is manifest <lb/>
all around in the substantial outside aspect of things, and the <lb/>
suggestions of wholesome life and comfort that everywhere <lb/>
appear.</p>
<p>Quincy is a notable example,&mdash;a brisk, handsome, <reg orig="well-|ordered">well-ordered</reg> <lb/>
city; and now, as formerly, interested in art, letters, <lb/>
and other high things.</p>
<p>But Marion City is an exception. Marion City has gone <lb/>
backwards in a most unaccountable way. This metropolis <lb/>
promised so well that the projectors tacked "city" to its <lb/>
name in the very beginning, with full confidence; but it was <lb/>
bad prophecy. When I first saw Marion City, thirty-five <lb/>
years ago, it contained one street, and nearly or quite six <lb/>
houses. It contains but one house now, and this one, in <lb/>
a state of ruin, is getting ready to follow the former five <lb/>
into the river.</p>
<p>Doubtless Marion City was too near to Quincy. It had <lb/>
another disadvantage: it was situated in a flat mud bottom, <lb/>
below high-water mark, whereas Quincy stands high up on <lb/>
the slope of a hill.</p>
<p>In the beginning Quincy had the aspect and ways of a <lb/>
model New England town: and these she has yet: broad, <lb/>
clean streets, trim, neat dwellings and lawns, fine mansions, <lb/>
<pb n="556" entity="DSSR_000002932_0559"/>
stately blocks of commercial buildings. And there are <lb/>
ample fair-grounds, a well kept park, and many attractive <lb/>
drives; library, reading-rooms, a couple of colleges, some <lb/>
handsome and costly churches, and a grand court-house, <lb/>
with grounds which occupy a square. The population of <lb/>
the city is thirty thousand. There are some large factories <lb/>
here, and manufacturing, of many sorts, is done on a great <lb/>
scale.</p>
<p>La Grange and Canton are growing towns, but I missed <lb/>
Alexandria; was told it was under water, but would come up <lb/>
to blow in the summer.</p>
<p>Keokuk was easily recognizable. I lived there in 1857,&mdash; <lb/>
an extraordinary year there in real-estate matters. The <lb/>
"boom" was something wonderful. Everybody bought, <lb/>
everybody sold,&mdash;except widows and preachers; they <reg orig="al-|ways">always</reg> <lb/>
hold on; and when the tide ebbs, they get left. <reg orig="Any-|thing">Anything</reg> <lb/>
in the semblance of a town lot, no matter how situated, <lb/>
was salable, and at a figure which would still have been <lb/>
high if the ground had been sodded with greenbacks.</p>
<p>The town has a population of fifteen thousand now, and is <lb/>
progressing with a healthy growth. It was night, and we <lb/>
could not see details, for which we were sorry, for Keokuk <lb/>
has the reputation of being a beautiful city. It was a <reg orig="pleas-|ant">pleasant</reg> <lb/>
one to live in long ago, and doubtless has advanced, not <lb/>
retrograded, in that respect.</p>
<p>A mighty work which was in progress there in my day is <lb/>
finished now. This is the canal over the Rapids. It is eight <lb/>
miles long, three hundred feet wide, and is in no place less <lb/>
than six feet deep. Its masonry is of the majestic kind which <lb/>
the War Department usually deals in, and will endure like a <lb/>
Roman aqueduct. The work cost four or five millions.</p>
<p>After an hour or two spent with former friends, we started <lb/>
up the river again. Keokuk, a long time ago, was an <reg orig="occa-|sional">occasional</reg> <lb/>
loafing-place of that erratic genius, Henry Clay Dean. <lb/>
I believe I never saw him but once; but he was much talked <lb/>
of when I lived there. This is what was said of him:&mdash;</p>
<pb n="557" entity="DSSR_000002932_0560"/>
<p>He began life poor and without education. But he <reg orig="edu-|cated">educated</reg> <lb/>
himself&mdash;on the curb-stones of Keokuk. He would <lb/>
sit down on a curb-stone with his book, careless or <reg orig="uncon-|scious">unconscious</reg> <lb/>
of the clatter of commerce and the tramp of the <reg orig="pass-|ing">passing</reg> <lb/>
crowds, and bury himself in his studies by the hour, <lb/>
never changing his position except to draw in his knees now <lb/>
and then to let a dray pass unobstructed; and when his book <lb/>
was finished, its contents, <lb/>
however abstruse, had been <lb/>
burnt into his memory, and <lb/>
were his permanent <reg orig="posses-|sion">possession</reg>. <lb/>
In this way he acquired <lb/>
a vast hoard of all sorts of <lb/>
learning, and had it <reg orig="pigeon-|holed">pigeonholed</reg> <lb/>
in his head where he <lb/>
could put his intellectual <lb/>
hand on it whenever it was <lb/>
wanted.</p>
<p>His clothes differed in no <lb/>
respect from a "wharf-rat's," <lb/>
except that they were <reg orig="rag-|geder">raggeder</reg>, <lb/>
more ill-assorted and <lb/>
inharmonious (and therefore <lb/>
more extravagantly <reg orig="pictur-|esque)">picturesque)</reg>, <lb/>
and several layers <lb/>
dirtier. Nobody could infer the master-mind in the top of <lb/>
that edifice from the edifice itself.</p>

<p>He was an orator,&mdash;by nature in the first place, and later <lb/>
by the training of experience and practice. When he was out <lb/>
on a canvass, his name was a loadstone which drew the <reg orig="far-|mers">farmers</reg> <lb/>
to his stump from fifty miles around. His theme was <lb/>
always politics. He used no notes, for a volcano does not <lb/>
need notes. In 1862, a son of Keokuk's late distinguished <lb/>
citizen, Mr. Claggett, gave me this incident concerning Dean:</p>
<p>The war feeling was running high in Keokuk (in '61), and <lb/>
a great mass meeting was to be held on a certain day in the <lb/>
<pb n="558" entity="DSSR_000002932_0561"/>
new Athen&aelig;um. A distinguished stranger was to address <lb/>
the house. After the building had been packed to its utmost <lb/>
capacity with sweltering folk of both sexes, the stage still <lb/>
remained vacant,&mdash;the distinguished stranger had failed to <lb/>
connect. The crowd grew impatient, and by and by <reg orig="indig-|nant">indignant</reg> <lb/>
and rebellious. About this time a distressed manager <lb/>
discovered Dean on a curb-stone, explained the dilemma to <lb/>
him, took his book away from him, rushed him into the <lb/>
building the back way, and told him to make for the stage <lb/>
and save his country.</p>
<p>Presently a sudden silence fell upon the grumbling <reg orig="audi-|ence">audience</reg>, <lb/>
and everybody's eyes sought a single point, &mdash; the wide, <lb/>
empty, carpetless stage. A figure appeared there whose <lb/>
aspect was familiar to hardly a dozen persons present. It was <lb/>
the scarecrow Dean, &mdash; in foxy shoes, down at the heels; socks <lb/>
of odd colors, also "down;" damaged trousers, relics of <reg orig="anti-|quity">antiquity</reg>, <lb/>
and a world too short, exposing some inches of naked <lb/>
ankle; an unbuttoned vest, also too short, and exposing a <lb/>
zone of soiled and wrinkled linen between it and the <reg orig="waist-|band">waistband</reg>; <lb/>
shirt bosom open; long black handkerchief, wound <lb/>
round and round the neck like a bandage; bob-tailed blue <lb/>
coat, reaching down to the small of the back, with sleeves <lb/>
which left four inches of forearm unprotected; small, <reg orig="stiff-|brimmed">stiff-brimmed</reg> <lb/>
soldier-cap hung on a corner of the bump of &mdash; <lb/>
whichever bump it was. This figure moved gravely out upon <lb/>
the stage and, with sedate and measured step, down to the <lb/>
front, where it paused, and dreamily inspected the house, <lb/>
saying no word. The silence of surprise held its own <lb/>
for a moment, then was broken by a just audible ripple of <lb/>
merriment which swept the sea of faces like the wash of a <lb/>
wave. The figure remained as before, thoughtfully <reg orig="inspect-|ing">inspecting</reg>. <lb/>
Another wave started, &mdash; laughter, this time. It was <lb/>
followed by another, then a third, &mdash; this last one boisterous.</p>
<p>And now the stranger stepped back one pace, took off his <lb/>
soldier-cap, tossed it into the wing, and began to speak, with <lb/>
deliberation, nobody listening, everybody laughing and <reg orig="whis-|pering">whispering</reg>. <lb/>

The speaker talked on unembarrassed, and presently <lb/>
delivered a shot which went home, and silence and attention <lb/>
resulted. He followed it quick and fast, with other telling <lb/>
things; warmed to his work and began to pour his words <lb/>
out, instead of dripping them; grew hotter and hotter, and <lb/>
fell to discharging lightnings and thunder, &mdash; and now the <lb/>
house began to break into applause, to which the speaker <lb/>
gave no heed, but went hammering straight on; unwound <lb/>
his black bandage and cast it away, still thundering; <reg orig="pres-|ently">presently</reg> <lb/>
discarded the bob-tailed coat and flung it aside, firing up <lb/>
higher and higher all the time; finally flung the vest after <lb/>
the coat; and then for an untimed period stood there, like <lb/>
another Vesuvius, spouting smoke and flame, lava and ashes, <lb/>
raining pumice-stone and cinders, shaking the moral earth <lb/>
with intellectual crash upon crash, explosion upon explosion, <lb/>
while the mad multitude stood upon their feet in a solid body, <lb/>
answering back with a ceaseless hurricane of cheers, through <lb/>
a thrashing snow-storm of waving handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>"When Dean came," said Claggett, "the people thought <lb/>
he was an escaped lunatic; but when he went, they thought <lb/>
he was an escaped archangel."</p>
<p>Burlington, home of the sparkling Burdette, is another <lb/>
hill city; and also a beautiful one; unquestionably so; a <lb/>
fine and flourishing city, with a population of twenty-five <lb/>
thousand, and belted with busy factories of nearly every <lb/>
imaginable description. It was a very sober city, too &mdash; for <lb/>
the moment &mdash; for a most sobering bill was pending; a bill <lb/>
to forbid the manufacture, exportation, importation, <reg orig="pur-|chase">purchase</reg>, <lb/>
sale, borrowing, lending, stealing, drinking, smelling, <lb/>
or possession, by conquest, inheritance, intent, accident, or <lb/>
otherwise, in the State of Iowa, of each and every deleterious <lb/>
beverage known to the human race, except water. This <lb/>
measure was approved by all the rational people in the <lb/>
State; but not by the bench of Judges.</p>
<p>Burlington has the progressive modern city's full <reg orig="equip-|ment">equipment</reg> <lb/>
of devices for right and intelligent government; <lb/>
<pb n="562" entity="DSSR_000002932_0565"/>
including a paid fire department, a thing which the great <lb/>
city of New Orleans is without, but still employs that relic of <lb/>
antiquity, the independent system.</p>
<p>In Burlington, as in all these Upper-River towns, one <lb/>
breathes a go-ahead atmosphere which tastes good in the <lb/>
nostrils. An opera-house has lately been built there which <lb/>
is in strong contrast with the shabby dens which usually <lb/>
do duty as theatres in cities of Burlington's size.</p>

<p>We had not time to go ashore in Muscatine, but had a <lb/>
daylight view of it from the boat. I lived there awhile, <lb/>
many years ago, but the place, now, had a rather unfamiliar <lb/>
look; so I suppose it has clear outgrown the town which I <lb/>
used to know. In fact, I know it has; for I remember it <lb/>
as a small place &mdash; which it is n't now. But I remember <lb/>
it best for a lunatic who caught me out in the fields, one <lb/>
Sunday, and extracted a butcher-knife from his boot and <lb/>
proposed to carve me up with it, unless I acknowledged <lb/>
<pb n="563" entity="DSSR_000002932_0566"/>
him to be the only son of the Devil. I tried to compromise <lb/>
on an acknowledgment that he was the only member of the <lb/>
family I had met; but that did not satisfy him; he would n't <lb/>
have any half-measures; I must say he was the sole and <lb/>
only son of the Devil &mdash; and he whetted his knife on his <lb/>
boot. It did not seem worth while to make trouble about <lb/>
a little thing like that; so I swung round to his view of the <lb/>
matter and saved my skin whole. Shortly afterward, he <lb/>
went to visit his father; and as he has not turned up since, <lb/>
I trust he is there yet.</p>
<p>And I remember Muscatine &mdash; still more pleasantly &mdash; for <lb/>
its summer sunsets. I have never seen any, on either side <lb/>
of the ocean, that equalled them. They used the broad <lb/>
smooth river as a canvas, and painted on it every <reg orig="imagina-|ble">imaginable</reg> <lb/>
dream of color, from the mottled daintinesses and <reg orig="deli-|cacies">delicacies</reg> <lb/>
of the opal, all the way up, through cumulative <lb/>
intensities, to blinding purple and crimson conflagrations <lb/>
which were enchanting to the eye, but sharply tried it at <lb/>
the same time. All the Upper Mississippi region has these <lb/>
extraordinary sunsets as a familiar spectacle. It is the true <lb/>
Sunset Land: I am sure no other country can show so good <lb/>
a right to the name. The sunrises are also said to be <lb/>
exceedingly fine. I do not know.</p>

Hour by hour, the boat plows <lb/>
deeper and deeper into the great and <lb/>
populous Northwest; and with each <lb/>
successive section of <lb/>
it which is revealed, <lb/>
one's surprise and <reg orig="re-|spect">respect</reg> <lb/>
gather emphasis <lb/>
and increase. <lb/>
Such a people, and <lb/>
such achievements <lb/>
as theirs, compel <lb/>
homage. This is <lb/>
an independent race who think for <lb/>
themselves, and who are competent to do it, because they <lb/>
are educated and enlightened; they read, they keep abreast <lb/>
<pb n="565" entity="DSSR_000002932_0568"/>
of the best and newest thought, they fortify every weak place <lb/>
in their land with a school, a college, a library, and a <reg orig="news-|paper">newspaper</reg>; <lb/>
and they live under law. Solicitude for the future of <lb/>
a race like this is not in order.</p>
<p>This region is new; so new that it may be said to be still <lb/>
in its babyhood. By what it has accomplished while still <lb/>
teething, one may forecast what marvels it will do in the <lb/>
strength of its maturity. It is so new that the foreign <lb/>
tourist has not heard of it yet; and has not visited it. For <lb/>
sixty years, the foreign tourist has steamed up and down <lb/>
the river between St. Louis and New Orleans, and then gone <lb/>
home and written his book, believing he had seen all of the <lb/>
river that was worth seeing or that had anything to see. In <lb/>
not six of all these books is there mention of these <reg orig="Upper-|River">Upper-River</reg> <lb/>
towns&mdash;for the reason that the five or six tourists <lb/>
who penetrated this region did it before these towns were <lb/>
projected. The latest tourist of them all (1878) made the <lb/>
same old regulation trip&mdash;he had not heard that there was <lb/>
anything north of St. Louis.</p>
<p>Yet there was. There was this amazing region, bristling <lb/>
with great towns, projected day before yesterday, so to <lb/>
speak, and built next morning. A score of them number <lb/>
from fifteen hundred to five thousand people. Then we <lb/>
have Muscatine, ten thousand; Winona, ten thousand; <lb/>
Moline, ten thousand; Rock Island, twelve thousand; La <lb/>
Crosse, twelve thousand; Burlington, twenty-five thousand; <lb/>
Dubuque, twenty-five thousand; Davenport, thirty <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg>; <lb/>
St. Paul, fifty-eight thousand; Minneapolis, sixty <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg> <lb/>
and upward.</p>
<p>The foreign tourist has never heard of these; there is no <lb/>
note of them in his books. They have sprung up in the <lb/>
night, while he slept. So new is this region, that I, who am <lb/>
comparatively young, am yet older than it is. When I was <lb/>
born, St. Paul had a population of three persons, <reg orig="Minne-|apolis">Minneapolis</reg> <lb/>
had just a third as many. The then population of <lb/>
Minneapolis died two years ago; and when he died he had <lb/>
<pb n="566" entity="DSSR_000002932_0569"/>
seen himself undergo an increase, in forty years, of <reg orig="fifty-|nine">fifty-nine</reg> <lb/>
thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine persons. He <lb/>
had a frog's fertility.</p>
<p>I must explain that the figures set down above, as the <lb/>
population of St. Paul and Minneapolis, are several months <lb/>
old. These towns are far larger now. In fact, I have just <lb/>
seen a newspaper estimate which gives the former <reg orig="seventy-|one">seventy-one</reg> <lb/>
thousand, and the latter seventy-eight thousand. This <lb/>
book will not reach the public for six or seven months yet; <lb/>
none of the figures will be worth much then.</p>
<p>We had a glimpse of Davenport, which is another <reg orig="beauti-|ful">beautiful</reg> <lb/>
city, crowning a hill&mdash;a phrase which applies to all <lb/>
these towns; for they are all comely, all well built, clean, <lb/>
orderly, pleasant to the eye, and cheering to the spirit; and <lb/>
they are all situated upon hills. Therefore we will give <lb/>
that phrase a rest. The Indians have a tradition that <lb/>
Marquette and Joliet camped where Davenport now stands, <lb/>
in 1673. The next white man who camped there, did it <lb/>
about a hundred and seventy years later&mdash;in 1834. <reg orig="Daven-|port">Davenport</reg> <lb/>
has gathered its thirty thousand people within the past <lb/>
thirty years. She sends more children to her schools now, <lb/>
than her whole population numbered twenty-three years ago. <lb/>
She has the usual Upper-River quota of factories, <reg orig="news-|papers">newspapers</reg>, <lb/>
and institutions of learning; she has telephones, <lb/>
local telegraphs, an electric alarm, and an admirable paid <lb/>
fire department, consisting of six hook and ladder <reg orig="compa-|nies">companies</reg>, <lb/>
four steam fire engines, and thirty churches. <reg orig="Daven-|port">Davenport</reg> <lb/>
is the official residence of two bishops&mdash;Episcopal and <lb/>
Catholic.</p>
<p>Opposite Davenport is the flourishing town of Rock <lb/>
Island, which lies at the foot of the Upper Rapids. A <lb/>
great railroad bridge connects the two towns&mdash;one of the <lb/>
thirteen which fret the Mississippi and the pilots, between <lb/>
St. Louis and St. Paul.</p>
<p>The charming island of Rock Island, three miles long <lb/>
and half a mile wide, belongs to the United States, and the <lb/>
<pb n="567" entity="DSSR_000002932_0570"/>
Government has turned it into a wonderful park, enhancing <lb/>
its natural attractions by art, and threading its fine forests <lb/>
with many miles of drives. Near the centre of the island <lb/>
one catches glimpses, through the trees, of ten vast stone <lb/>
four-story buildings, each of which covers an acre of ground. <lb/>
These are the Government workshops; for the Rock Island <lb/>
establishment is a national armory and arsenal.</p>
<p>We move up the river&mdash;always through enchanting <lb/>
scenery, there being no other kind on the Upper Mississippi <lb/>
&mdash;and pass <reg orig="Mo-|line">Moline</reg>, <lb/>
a centre of <lb/>
vast <reg orig="manufactur-|ing">manufacturing</reg> <lb/>
industries; <lb/>
and Clinton and <lb/>
Lyons, great <reg orig="lum-|ber">lumber</reg> <lb/>
centres; <lb/>
and presently <lb/>
reach Dubuque, <lb/>
which is <reg orig="situ-|ated">situated</reg> <lb/>
in a rich <lb/>
mineral region. <lb/>
The lead mines <lb/>
are very <reg orig="produc-|tive">productive</reg>, <lb/>
and of wide <lb/>
extent. Dubuque <lb/>
has a great <reg orig="num-|ber">number</reg> <lb/>
of manufacturing establishments; among them a plough <lb/>
factory which has for customers all Christendom in general. <lb/>
At least so I was told by an agent of the concern who was <lb/>
on the boat. He said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You show me any country under the sun where they <lb/>
really know <hi rend="italic">how</hi> to plough, and if I don't show you our mark <lb/>
on the plough they use, I'll eat that plough; and I won't ask <lb/>
for any Woostershyre sauce to flavor it up with, either."</p>

<p>All this part of the river is rich in Indian history and <reg orig="tra-|ditions">traditions</reg>. <lb/>
Black Hawk's was once a puissant name hereabouts; <lb/>
<pb n="568" entity="DSSR_000002932_0571"/>
as was Keokuk's, further down. A few miles below <reg orig="Du-|buque">Dubuque</reg> <lb/>
is the T&ecirc;te de Mort&mdash;Death's-head rock, or bluff&mdash; <lb/>
to the top of which the French drove a band of Indians, in <lb/>
early times, and cooped them up there, with death for a <lb/>
certainty, and only the manner of it matter of choice&mdash;to <lb/>
starve, or jump off and kill themselves. Black Hawk <lb/>
adopted the ways of the white people, toward the end of his <lb/>
life; and when he died he was buried, near Des Moines, in <lb/>
Christian fashion, modified by Indian custom; that is to say, <lb/>
clothed in a Christian military uniform, and with a Christian <lb/>
cane in his hand, but deposited in the grave in a sitting <lb/>
posture. Formerly, a horse had always been buried with a <lb/>
chief. The substitution of the cane shows that Black Hawk's <lb/>
haughty nature was really humbled, and he expected to <lb/>
walk when he got over.</p>
<p>We noticed that above Dubuque the water of the <reg orig="Missis-|sippi">Mississippi</reg> <lb/>
was olive-green&mdash;rich and beautiful and <reg orig="semi-trans-|parent">semi-transparent</reg>, <lb/>
with the sun on it. Of course the water was nowhere <lb/>
as clear or of as fine a complexion as it is in some other <reg orig="sea-|sons">seasons</reg> <lb/>
of the year; for now it was at flood stage, and <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg> <lb/>
dimmed and blurred by the mud manufactured from <lb/>
caving banks.</p>
<p>The majestic bluffs that overlook the river, along through <lb/>
this region, charm one with the grace and variety of their <lb/>
forms, and the soft beauty of their adornment. The steep <lb/>
verdant slope, whose base is at the water's edge, is topped by <lb/>
a lofty rampart of broken, turreted rocks, which are <reg orig="exqui-|sitely">exquisitely</reg> <lb/>
rich and mellow in color&mdash;mainly dark browns and <lb/>
dull greens, but splashed with other tints. And then you <lb/>
have the shining river, winding here and there and yonder, its <lb/>
sweep interrupted at intervals by clusters of wooded islands <lb/>
threaded by silver channels; and you have glimpses of <reg orig="dis-|tant">distant</reg> <lb/>
villages, asleep upon capes; and of stealthy rafts <reg orig="slip-|ping">slipping</reg> <lb/>
along in the shade of the forest walls; and of white <lb/>
steamers vanishing around remote points. And it is all <lb/>
as tranquil and reposeful as dreamland, and has nothing <lb/>
<pb n="569" entity="DSSR_000002932_0572"/>
this-worldly about it&mdash;nothing to hang a fret or a worry <lb/>
upon.</p>
<p>Until the unholy train comes tearing along&mdash;which it <lb/>
presently does, ripping the sacred solitude to rags and <reg orig="tat-|ters">tatters</reg> <lb/>
with its devil's warwhoop and the roar and thunder of <lb/>
its rushing wheels&mdash;and straightway you are back in this <lb/>
world, and with one of its frets ready to hand for your <reg orig="enter-|tainment">entertainment</reg>: <lb/>
for you remember that this is the very road whose <lb/>
stock always goes down after you buy it, and always goes up <lb/>
again as soon as you sell it. It makes me shudder to this <lb/>
day, to remember that I once came near not getting rid of <lb/>
my stock at all. It must be an awful thing to have a <reg orig="rail-|road">railroad</reg> <lb/>
left on your hands.</p>

<p>The locomotive is in sight from the deck of the steamboat <lb/>
almost the whole way from St. Louis to St. Paul&mdash;eight <lb/>
hundred miles. These railroads have made havoc with the <lb/>
steamboat commerce. The clerk of our boat was a <reg orig="steam-|boat">steamboat</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="570" entity="DSSR_000002932_0573"/>
clerk before these roads were built. In that day the <lb/>
influx of population was so great, and the freight business so <lb/>
heavy, that the boats were not able to keep up with the <lb/>
demands made upon their carrying capacity; consequently <lb/>
the captains were very independent and airy&mdash;pretty "<reg orig="big-|gity">biggity</reg>," <lb/>
as Uncle Remus would say. The clerk nut-shelled <lb/>
the contrast between the former time and the present, <lb/>
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Boat used to land&mdash;captain on hurricane roof&mdash;mighty <lb/>
stiff and straight&mdash;iron ramrod for a spine&mdash;kid gloves, <lb/>
plug tile, hair parted behind&mdash;man on shore takes off hat <lb/>
and says:&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f301" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002932_0573">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"'nuth'n'," says smith.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"'Got twenty-eight tons of wheat, cap'n&mdash;be great favor <lb/>
if you can take them.'</p>
<p>"Captain says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"''ll take two of them'&mdash;and don't even condescend to <lb/>
look at him.</p>
<pb n="571" entity="DSSR_000002932_0574"/>
<p>"But now-a-days the captain takes off his old slouch, and <lb/>
smiles all the way around to the back of his ears, and gets <lb/>
off a bow which he has n't got any ramrod to interfere with, <lb/>
and says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Glad to see you, Smith, glad to see you&mdash;you're <reg orig="look-|ing">looking</reg> <lb/>
well&mdash;have n't seen you looking so well for years&mdash;what <lb/>
you got for us?'</p>
<p>"'Nuth'n', says Smith; and keeps his hat on, and just <lb/>
turns his back and goes to talking with somebody else.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, eight years ago, the captain was on top; but it's <lb/>
Smith's turn now. Eight years ago a boat used to go up <lb/>
the river with every stateroom full, and people piled five and <lb/>
six deep on the cabin floor; and a solid deck-load of <reg orig="immi-|grants">immigrants</reg> <lb/>
and harvesters down below, into the bargain. To get <lb/>
a first-class stateroom, you'd got to prove sixteen <reg orig="quarter-|ings">quarterings</reg> <lb/>
of nobility and four hundred years of descent, or be <lb/>
personally acquainted with the nigger that blacked the <reg orig="cap-|tain's">captain's</reg> <lb/>
boots. But it's all changed now; plenty staterooms <lb/>
above, no harvesters below&mdash;there's a patent self-binder <lb/>
now, and they don't have harvesters any more; they've <lb/>
gone where the woodbine twineth&mdash;and they did n't go by <lb/>
steamboat, either; went by the train."</p>
<p>Up in this region we met massed acres of lumber rafts <lb/>
coming down&mdash;but not floating leisurely along, in the <reg orig="old-|fashioned">old-fashioned</reg> <lb/>
way, manned with joyous and reckless crews of <lb/>
fiddling, song-singing, whiskey-drinking, breakdown-dancing <lb/>
rapscallions; no, the whole thing was shoved swiftly along <lb/>
by a powerful stern-wheeler, modern fashion, and the small <lb/>
crews were quiet, orderly men, of a sedate business aspect, <lb/>
with not a suggestion of romance about them anywhere.</p>
<p>Along here, somewhere, on a black night, we ran some <lb/>
exceedingly narrow and intricate island-chutes by aid of the <lb/>
electric light. Behind was solid blackness&mdash;a crackless <lb/>
bank of it; ahead, a narrow elbow of water, curving <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
dense walls of foliage that almost touched our bows <lb/>
on both sides; and here every individual leaf, and every <lb/>
<pb n="572" entity="DSSR_000002932_0575"/>
individual ripple stood out in its natural color, and flooded <lb/>
with a glare as of noonday intensified. The effect was <lb/>
strange, and fine, and very striking.</p>
<p>We passed Prairie du Chien, another of Father Marquette's <lb/>
camping-places; and after some hours of progress through <lb/>
varied and beautiful scenery, reached La Crosse. Here is a <lb/>
town of twelve or thirteen thousand population, with electric <lb/>
lighted streets, and with blocks of buildings which are stately <lb/>
enough, and also architecturally fine enough, to command <lb/>
respect in any city. It is a choice town, and we made <reg orig="satis-|factory">satisfactory</reg> <lb/>
use of the hour allowed us, in roaming it over, though <lb/>
the weather was rainier than necessary.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> added several passengers to our list, at La Crosse; <lb/>
among others an old gentleman who had come to <lb/>
this northwestern region with the early settlers, and was <lb/>
familiar with every part of it. Pardonably proud of it, too. <lb/>
He said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You'll find scenery between here and St. Paul that can <lb/>
give the Hudson points. You'll have the Queen's Bluff&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="574" entity="DSSR_000002932_0577"/>
seven hundred feet high, and just as imposing a spectacle as <lb/>
you can find anywheres; and Trempeleau Island, which is n't <lb/>
like any other island in America, I believe, for it is a gigantic <lb/>
mountain, with precipitous sides, and is full of Indian <reg orig="tradi-|tions">traditions</reg>, <lb/>
and used to be full of rattlesnakes; if you catch the sun <lb/>
just right there, you will have a picture that will stay with <lb/>
you. And above Winona you'll have lovely prairies; and <lb/>
then come the Thousand Islands, too beautiful for anything; <lb/>
green? why you never saw foliage so green, nor packed so <lb/>
thick; it's like a thousand plush cushions afloat on a <reg orig="look-|ing-glass&mdash;when">looking-glass&mdash;when</reg> <lb/>
the water's still; and then the monstrous <lb/>
bluffs on both sides of the river&mdash;ragged, rugged, dark-<reg orig="com-|plected&mdash;just">complected&mdash;just</reg> <lb/>
the frame that's wanted; you always want a <lb/>
strong frame, you know, to throw up the nice points of a <reg orig="del-|icate">delicate</reg> <lb/>
picture and make them stand out."</p>
<p>The old gentleman also told us a touching Indian legend <lb/>
or two&mdash;but not very powerful ones.</p>
<p>After this excursion into history, he came back to the <lb/>
scenery, and described it, detail by detail, from the Thousand <lb/>
Islands to St. Paul; naming its names with such facility, <lb/>
tripping along his theme with such nimble and confident <lb/>
ease, slamming in a three-ton word, here and there, with <lb/>
such a complacent air of't is n't-anything,-I-can-do-it-any-<reg orig="time-|I-want-to">time-I-want-to</reg>, <lb/>
and letting off fine surprises of lurid eloquence at <lb/>
such judicious intervals, that I presently began to suspect&mdash;</p>
<p>But no matter what I began to suspect. Hear him:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Ten miles above Winona we come to Fountain City, <lb/>
nestling sweetly at the feet of cliffs that lift their awful <lb/>
fronts, Jovelike, toward the blue depths of heaven, bathing <lb/>
them in virgin atmospheres that have known no other <reg orig="con-|tact">contact</reg> <lb/>

<p>"And next we glide through silver waters, amid lovely <lb/>

pyramid. Its conic shape&mdash;thickly-wooded surface girding <lb/>
its sides, and its apex like that of a cone, cause the <reg orig="specta-|tor">spectator</reg> <lb/>
to wonder at nature's workings. From its dizzy heights <lb/>
superb views of the forests, streams, bluffs, hills and dales <lb/>
below and beyond for miles are brought within its focus. <lb/>
What grander river scenery can be conceived, as we gaze <lb/>
upon this enchanting landscape, from the uppermost point <lb/>
of these bluffs upon the valleys below? The primeval <lb/>
wildness and awful loneliness of these sublime creations <lb/>
<pb n="576" entity="DSSR_000002932_0579"/>
of nature and nature's God, excite feelings of unbounded <lb/>
admiration, and the recollection of which can never be <lb/>
effaced from the memory, as we view them in any <reg orig="direc-|tion">direction</reg>.</p>
<p>"Next we have the Lion's Head and the Lioness's Head, <lb/>
carved by nature's hand, to adorn and dominate the <reg orig="beaute-|ous">beauteous</reg> <lb/>
stream; and then anon <lb/>
the river widens, and a most charming and magnificent view <lb/>
of the valley before us suddenly bursts upon our vision; <lb/>
rugged hills, clad with verdant forests from summit to <lb/>
base, level prairie lands, holding in their lap the beautiful <lb/>
Wabasha, City of the Healing Waters, puissant foe of <lb/>
Bright's disease, and that grandest conception of nature's <lb/>
works, incomparable Lake Pepin&mdash;these constitute a picture <lb/>
whereon the tourist's eye may gaze uncounted hours, with <lb/>
rapture unappeased and unappeasable.</p>

<p>"And so we glide along; in due time encountering those <lb/>
majestic domes, the mighty Sugar Loaf, and the sublime <lb/>
Maiden's Rock&mdash;which latter, romantic superstition has <lb/>
invested with a voice; and oft-times as the birch canoe glides <lb/>
near, at twilight, the dusky paddler fancies he hears the <lb/>
soft sweet music of the long-departed Winona, darling of <lb/>
Indian song and story.</p>
<p>"Then Frontenac looms upon our vision, delightful resort <lb/>

then Prescott and the St. Croix; and anon we see <lb/>
bursting upon us the domes and steeples of St. Paul, giant <lb/>

<p>"I have formerly served in that capacity."</p>
<p>My suspicion was confirmed.</p>
<p>"Do you still travel with it?"</p>
<p>"No, she is laid up till the fall season opens. I am helping <lb/>
now to work up the materials for a Tourist's Guide which the <lb/>
St. Louis and St. Paul Packet Company are going to issue this <lb/>
summer for the benefit of travellers who go by that line."</p>
<p>"When you were talking of Maiden's Rock, you spoke of <lb/>
the long-departed Winona, darling of Indian song and story. <lb/>
Is she the maiden of the rock?&mdash;and are the two connected <lb/>
by legend?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and a very tragic and painful one. Perhaps the <lb/>
most celebrated, as well as the most pathetic, of all the <lb/>
legends of the Mississippi."</p>
<pb n="578" entity="DSSR_000002932_0581"/>
<p>We asked him to tell it. He dropped out of his <reg orig="conversa-|tional">conversational</reg> <lb/>
vein and back into his lecture-gait without an effort, <lb/>
and rolled on as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"A little distance above Lake City is a famous point <lb/>
known as Maiden's Rock, which is not only a picturesque <lb/>
spot, but is full of romantic interest from the event which <lb/>
gave it its name. Not many years <lb/>
ago this locality was a favorite <lb/>
resort for the Sioux Indians on <lb/>
account of the fine fishing and <lb/>
hunting to be had there, and large <lb/>
numbers of them were always to <lb/>
be found in this locality. Among <lb/>
the families which used to resort <lb/>
here, was one belonging to the tribe <lb/>
of Wabasha. We-no-na (first-born) <lb/>
was the name of a maiden who had <lb/>
plighted her troth to a lover <reg orig="be-|longing">belonging</reg> <lb/>
to the same band. But her <lb/>
stern parents had promised her <lb/>
hand to another, a famous warrior, <lb/>
and insisted on her wedding him. <lb/>
The day was fixed by her parents, <lb/>
to her great grief. She appeared to <lb/>
accede to the proposal and <reg orig="accom-|pany">accompany</reg> <lb/>
them to the rock, for the <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg> <lb/>
of gathering flowers for the <lb/>
feast. On reaching the rock, <reg orig="We-|no-na">We-no-na</reg> <lb/>
ran to its summit and <reg orig="stand-|ing">standing</reg> <lb/>
on its edge upbraided her <reg orig="par-|ents">parents</reg> <lb/>
who were below, for their <lb/>
cruelty, and then singing a death-dirge, threw herself from <lb/>
the precipice and dashed them in pieces on the rock below."</p>
<figure id="f306" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002932_0581">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">the lecturer.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"Dashed who in pieces&mdash;her parents?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, it certainly was a tragic business, as you say. <lb/>
<pb n="579" entity="DSSR_000002932_0582"/>
And moreover, there is a startling kind of dramatic surprise <lb/>
about it which I was not looking for. It is a distinct <lb/>
improvement upon the threadbare form of Indian legend. <lb/>
There are fifty Lover's Leaps along the Mississippi from <lb/>
whose summit disappointed Indian girls have jumped, but <lb/>
this is the only jump in the lot that turned out in the right <lb/>
and satisfactory way. What became of Winona?"</p>
<p>"She was a good deal jarred up and jolted: but she got <lb/>
herself together and disappeared before the coroner reached <lb/>
the fatal spot; and 't is said she sought and married her true <lb/>
love, and wandered with him to some distant clime, where <lb/>
she lived happy ever after, her gentle spirit mellowed and <lb/>
chastened by the romantic incident which had so early <lb/>
deprived her of the sweet guidance of a mother's love and <lb/>
a father's protecting arm, and thrown her, all unfriended, <lb/>
upon the cold charity of a censorious world."</p>
<p>I was glad to hear the lecturer's description of the scenery, <lb/>
for it assisted my appreciation of what I saw of it, and enabled <lb/>
me to imagine such of it as we lost by the intrusion of night.</p>
<p>As the lecturer remarked, this whole region is blanketed <lb/>
with Indian tales and traditions. But I reminded him that <lb/>
people usually merely mentioned this fact&mdash;doing it in a <lb/>
way to make a body's mouth water&mdash;and judiciously stopped <lb/>
there. Why? Because the impression left, was that these <lb/>
tales were full of incident and imagination&mdash;a pleasant <lb/>
impression which would be promptly dissipated if the tales <lb/>
were told. I showed him a lot of this sort of literature <lb/>
which I had been collecting, and he confessed that it was <lb/>
poor stuff, exceedingly sorry rubbish; and I ventured to add <lb/>
that the legends which he had himself told us were of this <lb/>
character, with the single exception of the admirable story <lb/>
of Winona. He granted these facts, but said that if I would <lb/>
hunt up Mr. Schoolcraft's book, published near fifty years <lb/>
ago, and now doubtless out of print, I would find some Indian <lb/>
inventions in it that were very far from being barren of <reg orig="inci-|dent">incident</reg> <lb/>
and imagination; that the tales in Hiawatha were of this <lb/>
<pb n="580" entity="DSSR_000002932_0583"/>
sort, and they came from Schoolcraft's book; and that there <lb/>
were others in the same book which Mr. Longfellow could <lb/>
have turned into verse with good effect. For instance, there <lb/>
was the legend of "The Undying Head." He could not tell <lb/>
it, for many of the details had grown dim in his memory; <lb/>
but he would recommend me to find it and enlarge my respect <lb/>
for the Indian imagination. He said that this tale, and most <lb/>
of the others in the book, were current among the Indians <lb/>
along this part of the Mississippi when he first came here; <lb/>
and that the contributors to Schoolcraft's book had got them <lb/>
directly from Indian lips, and had written them down with <lb/>
strict exactness, and without embellishments of their own.</p>
<p>I have found the book. The lecturer was right. There are <lb/>
several legends in it which confirm what he said. I will offer <lb/>
two of them&mdash;"The Undying Head," and "Peboan and <reg orig="Seeg-|wun">Seegwun</reg>, <lb/>
an Allegory of the Seasons." The latter is used in <reg orig="Hia-|watha">Hiawatha</reg>; <lb/>
but it is worth reading in the original form, if only <lb/>
that one may see how effective a genuine poem can be without <lb/>
the helps and graces of poetic measure and rhythm:&mdash;</p>
<q><text id="d138"><body><div1 type="quotation">
<head>PEBOAN AND SEEGWUN.</head>
<p>An old man was sitting alone in his lodge, by the side of a frozen <lb/>
stream. It was the close of winter, and his fire was almost out. <lb/>
He appeared very old and very desolate. His locks were white <lb/>
with age, and he trembled in every joint. Day after day passed in <lb/>
solitude, and he heard nothing but the sound of the tempest, <reg orig="sweep-|ing">sweeping</reg> <lb/>
before it the new-fallen snow.</p>
<p>One day, as his fire was just dying, a handsome young man <lb/>
approached and entered his dwelling. His cheeks were red with <lb/>
the blood of youth, his eyes sparkled with animation, and a smile <lb/>
played upon his lips. He walked with a light and quick step. His <lb/>
forehead was bound with a wreath of sweet grass, in place of a <reg orig="war-|rior's">warrior's</reg> <lb/>
frontlet, and he carried a bunch of flowers in his hand.</p>
<p>"Ah, my son," said the old man, "I am happy to see you. <lb/>
Come in. Come and tell me of your adventures, and what strange <lb/>
lands you have been to see. Let us pass the night together. I <lb/>
<pb n="581" entity="DSSR_000002932_0584"/>
will tell you of my prowess and exploits, and what I can perform. <lb/>
You shall do the same, and we will amuse ourselves."</p>
<p>He then drew from his sack a curiously wrought antique pipe, <lb/>
and having filled it with tobacco, rendered mild by a mixture of <lb/>
certain leaves, handed it to his guest. When this ceremony was <lb/>
concluded they began to speak.</p>
<p>"I blow my breath," said the old man, "and the stream stands <lb/>
still. The water becomes stiff and hard as clear stone."</p>
<p>"I breathe," said the young man, "and flowers spring up over <lb/>
the plain."</p>
<p>"I shake my locks," retorted the old man, "and snow covers the <lb/>
land. The leaves fall from the trees at my command, and my breath <lb/>
blows them away. The birds get up from the water, and fly to a <lb/>
distant land. The animals hide themselves from my breath, and the <lb/>
very ground becomes as hard as flint."</p>
<p>"I shake my ringlets," rejoined the young man, "and warm <lb/>
showers of soft rain fall upon the earth. The plants lift up their <lb/>
heads out of the earth, like the eyes of children glistening with <lb/>
delight. My voice recalls the birds. The warmth of my breath <lb/>
unlocks the streams. Music fills the groves wherever I walk, and <lb/>
all nature rejoices."</p>
<p>At length the sun began to rise. A gentle warmth came over <lb/>
the place. The tongue of the old man became silent. The robin <lb/>
and bluebird began to sing on the top of the lodge. The stream <lb/>
began to murmur by the door, and the fragrance of growing herbs <lb/>
and flowers came softly on the vernal breeze.</p>
<p>Daylight fully revealed to the young man the character of his <lb/>
entertainer. When he looked upon him, he had the icy visage of <lb/>

<note id="n24" place="foot" n="24"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>Winter.</p></note>
 Streams began to flow from his eyes. As the sun <lb/>
increased, he grew less and less in stature, and anon had melted <lb/>
completely away. Nothing remained on the place of his lodge-fire <lb/>
but the <hi rend="italic">miskodeed,</hi><ref target="n25" n="25"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>

<p>"The Undying Head" is a rather long tale, but it makes <lb/>

and energy of movement, for what it lacks in brevity.<ref target="n26" n="26"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> reached St. Paul, at the head of navigation of the <lb/>
Mississippi, and there our voyage of two thousand <lb/>
miles from New Orleans ended. It is about a ten-day trip <lb/>
by steamer. It can probably be done quicker by rail. I <lb/>
judge so because I know that one may go by rail from St. <lb/>
Louis to Hannibal&mdash;a distance of at least a hundred and <lb/>
<pb n="583" entity="DSSR_000002932_0586"/>
twenty miles&mdash;in seven hours. This is better than walking; <lb/>
unless one is in a hurry.</p>
<p>The season being far advanced when we were in New <reg orig="Or-|leans">Orleans</reg>, <lb/>
the roses and magnolia blossoms were falling; but <lb/>
here in St. Paul it was the snow. In New Orleans we had <lb/>
caught an occasional withering breath from over a crater, <lb/>
apparently; here in St. Paul we caught a frequent <reg orig="benumb-|ing">benumbing</reg> <lb/>
one from over a glacier, apparently.</p>
<p>I am not trying to astonish by these statistics. No, it is <lb/>
only natural that there should be a sharp difference between <lb/>
climates which lie upon parallels of latitude which are one <lb/>
or two thousand miles apart. I take this position, and I <lb/>
will hold it and maintain it in spite of the newspapers. The <lb/>
newspaper thinks it is n't a natural thing; and once a year, <lb/>
in February, it remarks, with ill-concealed exclamation points, <lb/>
that while we, away up here are fighting snow and ice, folks <lb/>
are having new strawberries and peas down South; callas <lb/>
are blooming out of doors, and the people are complaining of <lb/>
the warm weather. The newspaper never gets done being <lb/>
surprised about it. It is caught regularly every February. <lb/>
There must be a reason for this; and this reason must be <lb/>
change of hands at the editorial desk. You cannot surprise <lb/>
an individual more than twice with the same marvel&mdash;not <lb/>
even with the February miracles of the Southern climate; <lb/>
but if you keep putting new hands at the editorial desk every <lb/>
year or two, and forget to vaccinate them against the annual <lb/>
climatic surprise, that same old thing is going to occur right <lb/>
along. Each year one new hand will have the disease, and <lb/>
be safe from its recurrence; but this does not save the <reg orig="news-|paper">newspaper</reg>. <lb/>
No, the newspaper is in as bad case as ever; it will <lb/>
forever have its new hand; and so, it will break out with <lb/>
the strawberry surprise every February as long as it lives. <lb/>
The new hand is curable; the newspaper itself is incurable. <lb/>
An act of Congress&mdash;no, Congress could not prohibit the <lb/>
strawberry surprise without questionably stretching its <reg orig="pow-|ers">powers</reg>. <lb/>
An amendment to the Constitution might fix the thing, <lb/>
<pb n="584" entity="DSSR_000002932_0587"/>
and that is probably the best and quickest way to get at it. <lb/>
Under authority of such an amendment, Congress could then <lb/>
pass an act inflicting imprisonment for life for the first <reg orig="of-|fence">offence</reg>, <lb/>
and some sort of lingering death for subsequent ones; <lb/>
and this, no doubt, would presently give us a rest. At the <lb/>
same time, the amendment and the resulting act and <reg orig="penal-|ties">penalties</reg> <lb/>
might easily be made to cover various cognate abuses, <lb/>
such as the Annual-Veteran-who-has-Voted-for-Every-<reg orig="Presi-|dent-from-Washington-down,-and-Walked-to-the-Polls-Yes">President-from-Washington-down,-and-Walked-to-the-Polls-Yes</reg>- <lb/>
<lb/>
terday-with-as-Bright-an-Eye-and-as-Firm-a-Step-as-Ever, and <lb/>
ten or eleven other weary yearly marvels of that sort, and <lb/>
of the Oldest-Freemason, and Oldest-Printer, and <reg orig="Oldest-|Baptist-Preacher">Oldest-Baptist-Preacher</reg>, <lb/>
and Oldest-Alumnus sort, and <reg orig="Three-Chil-|dren-Born-at-a-Birth">Three-Children-Born-at-a-Birth</reg> <lb/>
sort, and so on, and so on. And then <lb/>
England would take it up and pass a law prohibiting the <lb/>
further use of Sidney Smith's jokes, and appointing a <reg orig="com-|missioner">commissioner</reg> <lb/>
to construct some new ones. Then life would be <lb/>
a sweet dream of rest and peace, and the nations would <lb/>
cease to long for heaven.</p>
<p>But I wander from my theme. St. Paul is a wonderful <lb/>
town. It is put together in solid blocks of honest brick and <lb/>
stone, and has the air of intending to stay. Its post-office <lb/>
was established thirty-six years ago; and by and by, when <lb/>
the postmaster received a letter, he carried it to Washington, <lb/>
horseback, to inquire what was to be done with it. Such is <lb/>
the legend. Two frame houses were built that year, and <reg orig="sev-|eral">several</reg> <lb/>
persons were added to the population. A recent number <lb/>
of the leading St. Paul paper, the "Pioneer Press," gives some <lb/>
statistics which furnish a vivid contrast to that old state of <lb/>
things, to wit: Population, autumn of the present year (1882), <lb/>
71,000; number of letters handled, first half of the year, <lb/>
1,209,387; number of houses built during three-quarters of <lb/>
the year, 989; their cost, $3,186,000. The increase of <reg orig="let-|ters">letters</reg> <lb/>
over the corresponding six months of last year was fifty <lb/>
per cent. Last year the new buildings added to the city cost <lb/>
above $4,500,000. St. Paul's strength lies in her commerce <lb/>
<pb n="585" entity="DSSR_000002932_0588"/>
&mdash;I mean his commerce. He is a manufacturing city, of <lb/>
course&mdash;all the cities of that region are&mdash;but he is <reg orig="peculi-|arly">peculiarly</reg> <lb/>
strong in the matter of commerce. Last year his <reg orig="job-|bing">jobbing</reg> <lb/>
trade amounted to upwards of $52,000,000.</p>
<p>He has a custom-house, and is building a costly <lb/>
capitol to replace the one recently burned&mdash; <lb/>
for he is the capital of the State. He <lb/>
has churches without end; and not <lb/>
the cheap poor kind, but the <lb/>
kind that the rich Protestant <lb/>
puts up, the kind that the <lb/>
poor Irish "hired-girl" <lb/>
delights to erect. <lb/>
What a passion for <lb/>
building majestic <lb/>
churches the Irish <lb/>
hired-girl has. <lb/>
It is a fine thing <lb/>
for our <reg orig="archi-|tecture">architecture</reg>; <lb/>
but <lb/>
too often we <lb/>
enjoy her <lb/>
stately fanes <lb/>
without <reg orig="giv-|ing">giving</reg> <lb/>
her a grateful <lb/>
thought. In fact, <lb/>
instead of <reg orig="reflect-|ing">reflecting</reg> <lb/>
that "every brick and every stone in this beautiful <lb/>
edifice represents an ache or a pain, and a handful of sweat, <lb/>
and hours of heavy fatigue, contributed by the back and <lb/>
forehead and bones of poverty," it is our habit to forget these <lb/>
things entirely, and merely glorify the mighty temple itself, <lb/>
without vouchsafing one praiseful thought to its humble <lb/>
builder, whose rich heart and withered purse it symbolizes.</p>

</figure>
<p>This is a land of libraries and schools. St. Paul has three <lb/>
public libraries, and they contain, in the aggregate, some <lb/>
<pb n="586" entity="DSSR_000002932_0589"/>
forty thousand books. He has one hundred and sixteen <lb/>
school-houses, and pays out more than seventy thousand <lb/>
dollars a year in teachers' salaries.</p>
<p>There is an unusually fine railway station; so large is it, <lb/>
in fact, that it seemed somewhat overdone, in the matter of <lb/>
size, at first; but at the end of a few months it was perceived <lb/>
that the mistake was distinctly the other way. The error is <lb/>
to be corrected.</p>
<p>The town stands on high ground; it is about seven <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
feet above the sea level. It is so high that a wide view <lb/>
of river and lowland is offered from its streets.</p>
<p>It is a very wonderful town indeed, and is not finished <lb/>
yet. All the streets are obstructed with building material, <lb/>
and this is being compacted into houses as fast as possible, <lb/>
to make room for more&mdash;for other people are anxious to <lb/>
build, as soon as they can get the use of the streets to pile <lb/>
up their bricks and stuff in.</p>
<p>How solemn and beautiful is the thought, that the earliest <lb/>
pioneer of civilization, the van-leader of civilization, is never <lb/>
the steamboat, never the railroad, never the newspaper, never <lb/>
the Sabbath-school, never the missionary&mdash;but always <reg orig="whis-|key">whiskey</reg>! <lb/>
Such is the case. Look history over; you will see. <lb/>
The missionary comes after the whiskey&mdash;I mean he <reg orig="ar-|rives">arrives</reg> <lb/>
after the whiskey has arrived; next comes the poor <lb/>
immigrant, with axe and hoe and rifle; next, the trader; <lb/>
next, the miscellaneous rush; next, the gambler, the <reg orig="despe-|rado">desperado</reg>, <lb/>
the highwayman, and all their kindred in sin of both <lb/>
sexes; and next, the smart chap who has bought up an old <lb/>
grant that covers all the land; this brings the lawyer tribe; <lb/>
the vigilance committee brings the undertaker. All these <lb/>
interests bring the newspaper; the newspaper starts up <reg orig="poli-|tics">politics</reg> <lb/>
and a railroad; all hands turn to and build a church and <lb/>
a jail,&mdash;and behold, civilization is established forever in the <lb/>
land. But whiskey, you see, was the van-leader in this <lb/>
beneficent work. It always is. It was like a foreigner&mdash;and <lb/>
excusable in a foreigner&mdash;to be ignorant of this great truth, <lb/>
<pb n="587" entity="DSSR_000002932_0590"/>
and wander off into astronomy to borrow a symbol. But if <lb/>
he had been conversant with the facts, he would have said,&mdash;</p>
<p>Westward the Jug of Empire takes its way.</p>
<p>This great van-leader arrived upon the ground which St. <lb/>
Paul now occupies, in June, 1837. Yes, at that date, Pierre <lb/>
Parrant, a Canadian, built the first cabin, uncorked his jug, <lb/>
and began to sell whiskey to the Indians. The result is before <lb/>
us.</p>

<p>All that I have said of the newness, briskness, swift <reg orig="pro-|gress">progress</reg>, <lb/>
wealth, intelligence, fine and substantial architecture, <lb/>
and general slash and go, and energy of St. Paul, will apply <lb/>
to his near neighbor, Minneapolis&mdash;with the addition that <lb/>
the latter is the bigger of the two cities.</p>
<p>These extraordinary towns were ten miles apart, a few <lb/>
months ago, but were growing so fast that they may possibly <lb/>
be joined now, and getting along under a single mayor. At <lb/>
any rate, within five years from now there will be at least <lb/>
such a substantial ligament of buildings stretching between <lb/>
them and uniting them that a stranger will not be able to <lb/>
<pb n="588" entity="DSSR_000002932_0591"/>
tell where the one Siamese twin leaves off and the other <lb/>
begins. Combined, they will then number a population of <lb/>
two hundred and fifty thousand, if they continue to grow as <lb/>
they are now growing. Thus, this centre of population at <lb/>
the head of Mississippi navigation, will then begin a rivalry <lb/>
as to numbers, with that centre of population at the foot of <lb/>
it&mdash;New Orleans.</p>
<p>Minneapolis is situated at the falls of St. Anthony, which <lb/>
stretch across the river, fifteen hundred feet, and have a fall <lb/>
of eighty-two feet&mdash;a waterpower which, by art, has been <lb/>
made of inestimable value, business-wise, though somewhat <lb/>

celebrated&mdash;they do not need a lift from me, in that <lb/>

resort by the wealth and fashion of the State. It has its <lb/>
club-house, and its hotel, with the modern improvements and <lb/>

with White-bear Lake is a most idiotic Indian legend. I <lb/>

the task is beyond my strength. The guide-book names the <lb/>

<head>A LEGEND OF WHITE-BEAR LAKE.</head>
<p>Every spring, for perhaps a century, or as long as there has <lb/>
been a nation of red men, an island in the middle of White-bear <lb/>
Lake has been visited by a band of Indians for the purpose of <lb/>
making maple sugar.</p>
<p>Tradition says that many springs ago, while upon this island, a <lb/>
young warrior loved and wooed the daughter of his chief, and it is <lb/>
said, also, the maiden loved the warrior. He had again and again <lb/>
been refused her hand by her parents, the old chief alleging that he <lb/>
was no brave, and his old consort called him a woman!</p>
<p>The sun had again set upon the "sugar-bush," and the bright <lb/>
moon rose high in the bright blue heavens, when the young warrior <lb/>
took down his flute and went out alone, once more to sing the story <lb/>
of his love, the mild breeze gently moved the two gay feathers in <lb/>
his head-dress, and as he mounted on the trunk of a leaning tree, <lb/>
the damp snow fell from his feet heavily. As he raised his flute <lb/>
to his lips, his blanket slipped from his well-formed shoulders, and <lb/>
lay partly on the snow beneath. He began his weird, wild <reg orig="love-|song">love-song</reg>, <lb/>
but soon felt that he was cold, and as he reached back for <lb/>
his blanket, some unseen hand laid it gently on his shoulders; it <lb/>
was the hand of his love, his guardian angel. She took her place <lb/>
beside him, and for the present they were happy; for the Indian <lb/>
has a heart to love, and in this pride he is as noble as in his own <lb/>
freedom, which makes him the child of the forest. As the legend <lb/>
runs, a large white-bear, thinking, perhaps, that polar snows and <lb/>
dismal winter weather extended everywhere, took up his journey <lb/>
southward. He at length approached the northern shore of the <lb/>
lake which now bears his name, walked down the bank and made <lb/>
his way noiselessly through the deep heavy snow toward the island. <lb/>
It was the same spring ensuing that the lovers met. They had <lb/>
left their first retreat, and were now seated among the branches <lb/>
of a large elm which hung far over the lake. (The same tree <lb/>
is still standing, and excites universal curiosity and interest.) For <lb/>
fear of being detected, they talked almost in a whisper, and now, <lb/>
<pb n="591" entity="DSSR_000002932_0594"/>
that they might get <lb/>
back to camp in good <lb/>
time and thereby <lb/>
avoid suspicion, they <lb/>
were just rising to <lb/>
return, when the <lb/>
maiden uttered a <lb/>
shriek which was <lb/>
heard at the camp, <lb/>
and bounding toward <lb/>
the young brave, she <lb/>
caught his blanket, <lb/>
but missed the <reg orig="direc-|tion">direction</reg> <lb/>
of her foot and <lb/>
fell, bearing the <lb/>
blanket with her into <lb/>
the great arms of the <lb/>
ferocious monster. <lb/>
Instantly every man, <lb/>
woman, and child of <lb/>
the band were upon <lb/>
the bank, but all <reg orig="un-|armed">unarmed</reg>. <lb/>
Cries and <lb/>
wailings went up from <lb/>
every mouth. What <lb/>
was to be done? In <lb/>
the meantime this <lb/>
white and savage <lb/>
beast held the <reg orig="breath-|less">breathless</reg> <lb/>
maiden in his <lb/>
huge grasp, and <reg orig="fon-|dled">fondled</reg> <lb/>
with his precious <lb/>
prey as if he were <lb/>
used to scenes like <lb/>
this. One deafening <lb/>
yell from the lover <lb/>
warrior is heard above <lb/>
the cries of hundreds of his tribe, and dashing away to his wigwam <lb/>
he grasps his faithful knife, returns almost at a single bound to the <lb/>

scene of fear and fright, rushes out along the leaning tree to the spot <lb/>
where his treasure fell, and springing with the fury of a mad panther, <lb/>
pounced upon his prey. The animal turned, and with one stroke of <lb/>
his huge paw brought the lovers heart to heart, but the next moment <lb/>
the warrior, with one plunge of the blade of his knife, opened the <lb/>
crimson sluices of death, and the dying bear relaxed his hold.</p>
<p>That night there was no more sleep for the band or the lovers, <lb/>
and as the young and the old danced about the carcass of the dead <lb/>
monster, the gallant warrior was presented with another plume, and <lb/>
ere another moon had set he had a living treasure added to his <lb/>
heart. Their children for many years played upon the skin of the <lb/>
white-bear&mdash;from which the lake derives its name&mdash;and the maiden <lb/>
and the brave remembered long the fearful scene and rescue that <lb/>
made them one, for Kis-se-me-pa and Ka-go-ka could never forget <lb/>
their fearful encounter with the huge monster that came so near <lb/>
sending them to the happy hunting-ground.</p>
</div1></body></text></q>
<p>It is a perplexing business. First, she fell down out of <lb/>
the tree&mdash;she and the blanket; and the bear caught her <lb/>
and fondled her&mdash;her and the blanket; then she fell up <lb/>
into the tree again&mdash;leaving the blanket; meantime the <lb/>
lover goes war-whooping home and comes back "heeled," <lb/>
climbs the tree, jumps down on the bear, the girl jumps <lb/>
down after him&mdash;apparently, for she was up the tree&mdash; <lb/>
resumes her place in the bear's arms along with the blanket, <lb/>
the lover rams his knife into the bear, and saves&mdash;whom, <lb/>
the blanket? No&mdash;nothing of the sort. You get yourself <lb/>
all worked up and excited about that blanket, and then all <lb/>
of a sudden, just when a happy climax seems imminent, you <lb/>
are let down flat&mdash;nothing saved but the girl. Whereas, <lb/>
one is not interested in the girl; she is not the prominent <lb/>
feature of the legend. Nevertheless, there you are left, and <lb/>
there you must remain; for if you live a thousand years you <lb/>
will never know who got the blanket. A dead man could <lb/>
get up a better legend than this one. I don't mean a fresh <lb/>
dead man either; I mean a man that's been dead weeks and <lb/>
weeks.</p>
<pb n="593" entity="DSSR_000002932_0596"/>
<p>We struck the home-trail now, and in a few hours were <lb/>
in that astonishing Chicago&mdash;a city where they are always <lb/>
rubbing the lamp, and fetching up the genii, and contriving <lb/>
and achieving new impossibilities. It is hopeless for the <lb/>
occasional visitor to try to keep up with Chicago&mdash;she <reg orig="out-|grows">outgrows</reg> <lb/>
his prophecies faster than he can make them. She <lb/>
is always a novelty; for she is never the Chicago you saw <lb/>
when you passed through the last time. The Pennsylvania <lb/>
road rushed us to New York without missing schedule time <lb/>
ten minutes anywhere on the route; and there ended one <lb/>
of the most enjoyable five-thousand-mile journeys I have <lb/>
ever had the good fortune to make.</p>

<head>VOYAGE OF THE TIMES-DEMOCRAT'S RELIEF BOAT <lb/>
THROUGH THE INUNDATED REGIONS.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was nine o'clock Thursday morning when the "Susie" left <lb/>
the Mississippi and entered Old River, or what is now called the <lb/>
mouth of the Red. Ascending on the left, a flood was pouring in <lb/>
through and over the levees on the Chandler plantation, the most <lb/>
northern point in Pointe Coup&eacute;e parish. The water completely <lb/>
covered the place, although the levees had given way but a short <lb/>
time before. The stock had been gathered in a large flat-boat, <lb/>
where, without food, as we passed, the animals were huddled <lb/>
together, waiting for a boat to tow them off. On the right-hand <lb/>
side of the river is Turnbull's Island, and on it is a large plantation <lb/>
which formerly was pronounced one of the most fertile in the State. <lb/>
The water has hitherto allowed it to go scot-free in usual floods, but <lb/>
now broad sheets of water told only where fields were. The top of <lb/>
the protecting levee could be seen here and there, but nearly all of <lb/>
it was submerged.</p>
<p>The trees have put on a greener foliage since the water has <lb/>
poured in, and the woods look bright and fresh, but this pleasant <lb/>
aspect to the eye is neutralized by the interminable waste of water. <lb/>
We pass mile after mile, and it is nothing but trees standing up to <lb/>
their branches in water. A water-turkey now and again rises and <lb/>
flies ahead into the long avenue of silence. A pirogue sometimes <lb/>
flits from the bushes and crosses the Red River on its way out to <lb/>
<pb n="596" entity="DSSR_000002932_0599"/>
the Mississippi, but the sad-faced paddlers never turn their heads to <lb/>
look at our boat. The puffing of the boat is music in this gloom, <lb/>
which affects one most curiously. It is not the gloom of deep <lb/>
forests or dark caverns, but a peculiar kind of solemn silence <lb/>
and impressive awe that holds one perforce to its recognition. <lb/>
We passed two negro families on a raft tied up in the willows <lb/>
this morning. They were evidently of the well-to-do class, as <lb/>
they had a supply of meal and three or four hogs with them. <lb/>
Their rafts were about twenty feet square, and in front of an <lb/>
improvised shelter earth had been placed, on which they built their <lb/>
fire.</p>
<p>The current running down the Atchafalaya was very swift, the <lb/>
Mississippi showing a predilection in that direction, which needs <lb/>
only to be seen to enforce the opinion of that river's desperate <lb/>
endeavors to find a short way to the Gulf. Small boats, skiffs, <lb/>
pirogues, etc., are in great demand, and many have been stolen by <lb/>
piratical negroes, who take them where they will bring the greatest <lb/>
price. From what was told me by Mr. C. P. Ferguson, a planter <lb/>
near Red River Landing, whose place has just gone under, there is <lb/>
much suffering in the rear of that place. The negroes had given <lb/>
up all thoughts of a crevasse there, as the upper levee had stood so <lb/>
long, and when it did come they were at its mercy. On Thursday <lb/>
a number were taken out of trees and off of cabin roofs and brought <lb/>
in, many yet remaining.</p>
<p>One does not appreciate the sight of earth until he has travelled <lb/>
through a flood. At sea one does not expect or look for it, but <lb/>
here, with fluttering leaves, shadowy forest aisles, house-tops barely <lb/>
visible, it is expected. In fact a grave-yard, if the mounds were <lb/>
above water, would be appreciated. The river here is known only <lb/>
because there is an opening in the trees, and that is all. It is <lb/>
in width, from Fort Adams on the left bank of the Mississippi to <lb/>
the bank of Rapides Parish, a distance of about sixty miles. A <lb/>
large portion of this was under cultivation, particularly along the <lb/>
Mississippi and back of the Red. When Red River proper was <lb/>
entered, a strong current was running directly across it, pursuing the <lb/>
same direction as that of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>After a run of some hours, Black River was reached. Hardly <lb/>
was it entered before signs of suffering became visible. All the <reg orig="wil-|lows">willows</reg> <lb/>
along the banks were stripped of their leaves. One man, whom <lb/>
<pb n="597" entity="DSSR_000002932_0600"/>
your correspondent spoke to, said that he had had one hundred and <lb/>
fifty head of cattle and one hundred head of hogs. At the first <reg orig="ap-|pearance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
of water he had started to drive them to the high lands of <lb/>
Avoyelles, thirty-five miles off, but he lost fifty head of the beef <lb/>
cattle and sixty hogs. Black River is quite picturesque, even if its <lb/>
shores are under water. A dense growth of ash, oak, gum, and <reg orig="hick-|ory">hickory</reg> <lb/>
make the shores almost impenetrable, and where one can get a <lb/>
view down some avenue in the trees, only the dim outlines of distant <lb/>
trunks can be barely distinguished in the gloom.</p>
<p>A few miles up this river, the depth of water on the banks was <lb/>
fully eight feet, and on all sides could be seen, still holding against <lb/>
the strong current, the tops of cabins. Here and there one <reg orig="over-|turned">overturned</reg> <lb/>
was surrounded by drift-wood, forming the nucleus of <reg orig="pos-|sibly">possibly</reg> <lb/>
some future island.</p>
<p>In order to save coal, as it was impossible to get that fuel at any <lb/>
point to be touched during the expedition, a lookout was kept for a <lb/>
wood-pile. On rounding a point a pirogue, skilfully paddled by a <lb/>
youth, shot out, and in its bow was a girl of fifteen, of fair face, <lb/>
beautiful black eyes, and demure manners. The boy asked for a <lb/>
paper, which was thrown to him, and the couple pushed their tiny <lb/>
craft out into the swell of the boat.</p>
<p>Presently a little girl, not certainly over twelve years, paddled <lb/>
out in the smallest little canoe and handled it with all the deftness of <lb/>
an old voyageur. The little one looked more like an Indian than a <lb/>
white child, and laughed when asked if she were afraid. She had <lb/>
been raised in a pirogue and could go anywhere. She was bound <lb/>
out to pick willow leaves for the stock, and she pointed to a house <lb/>
near by with water three inches deep on the floors. At its back <lb/>
door was moored a raft about thirty feet square, with a sort of fence <lb/>
built upon it, and inside of this some sixteen cows and twenty hogs <lb/>
were standing. The family did not complain, except on account <lb/>
of losing their stock, and promptly brought a supply of wood in a <lb/>
flat.</p>
<p>From this point to the Mississippi River, fifteen miles, there is <lb/>
not a spot of earth above water, and to the westward for thirty-five <lb/>
miles there is nothing but the river's flood. Black River had risen <lb/>
during Thursday, the 23d, 1&frac34; inches, and was going up at night still. <lb/>
As we progress up the river habitations become more frequent, but <lb/>
are yet still miles apart. Nearly all of them are deserted, and the <lb/>
<pb n="598" entity="DSSR_000002932_0601"/>
out-houses floated off. To add to the gloom, almost every living <lb/>
thing seems to have departed, and not a whistle of a bird nor the <lb/>
bark of the squirrel can be heard in this solitude. Sometimes a <lb/>
morose gar will throw his tail aloft and disappear in the river, but <lb/>
beyond this everything is quiet&mdash;the quiet of dissolution. Down the <lb/>
river floats now a neatly whitewashed hen-house, then a cluster of <lb/>
neatly split fence-rails, or a door and a bloated carcass, solemnly <lb/>
guarded by a pair of buzzards, the only bird to be seen, which feast <lb/>
on the carcass as it bears them along. A picture-frame in which <lb/>
there was a cheap lithograph of a soldier on horseback, as it floated <lb/>
on told of some hearth invaded by the water and despoiled of this <lb/>
ornament.</p>
<p>At dark, as it was not prudent to run, a place alongside the <lb/>
woods was hunted and to a tall gum-tree the boat was made fast for <lb/>
the night.</p>
<p>A pretty quarter of the moon threw a pleasant light over forest <lb/>
and river, making a picture that would be a delightful piece of <reg orig="land-|scape">landscape</reg> <lb/>
study, could an artist only hold it down to his canvas. The <lb/>
motion of the engines had ceased, the puffing of the escaping steam <lb/>
was stilled, and the enveloping silence closed upon us, and such <lb/>
silence it was! Usually in a forest at night one can hear the piping <lb/>
of frogs, the hum of insects, or the dropping of limbs; but here nature <lb/>
was dumb. The dark recesses, those aisles into this cathedral, gave <lb/>
forth no sound, and even the ripplings of the current die away.</p>
<p>At daylight Friday morning all hands were up, and up the Black <lb/>
we started. The morning was a beautiful one, and the river, which <lb/>
is remarkably straight, put on its loveliest garb. The blossoms <lb/>
of the haw perfumed the air deliciously, and a few birds whistled <lb/>
blithely along the banks. The trees were larger, and the forest <lb/>
seemed of older growth than below. More fields were passed than <lb/>
nearer the mouth, but the same scene presented <reg orig="itself&mdash;smoke-|houses">itself&mdash;smokehouses</reg> <lb/>
drifting out in the pastures, negro quarters anchored in <reg orig="con-|fusion">confusion</reg> <lb/>
against some oak, and the modest residence just showing its <lb/>
eaves above water. The sun came up in a glory of carmine, and <lb/>
the trees were brilliant in their varied shades of green. Not a foot <lb/>
of soil is to be seen anywhere, and the water is apparently growing <lb/>
deeper and deeper, for it reaches up to the branches of the largest <lb/>
trees. All along, the bordering willows have been denuded of leaves, <lb/>
showing how long the people have been at work gathering this <reg orig="fod-|der">fodder</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="599" entity="DSSR_000002932_0602"/>
for their animals. An old man in a pirogue was asked how the <lb/>
willow leaves agreed with his cattle. He stopped in his work, and <lb/>
with an ominous shake of his head replied: "Well, sir, it's enough <lb/>
to keep warmth in their bodies and that's all we expect, but it's <lb/>
hard on the hogs, particularly the small ones. They is dropping off <lb/>
powerful fast. But what can you do? It's all we've got."</p>
<p>At thirty miles above the mouth of Black River the water <lb/>
extends from Natchez on the Mississippi across to the pine hills <lb/>
of Louisiana, a distance of seventy-three miles, and there is hardly <lb/>
a spot that is not ten feet under it. The tendency of the current <lb/>
up the Black is toward the west. In fact, so much is this the case, <lb/>
the waters of Red River have been driven down from toward the <lb/>
Calcasieu country, and the waters of the Black enter the Red some <lb/>
fifteen miles above the mouth of the former, a thing never before <lb/>
seen by even the oldest steamboatmen. The water now in sight of <lb/>
us is entirely from the Mississippi.</p>
<p>Up to Trinity, or rather Troy, which is but a short distance <lb/>
below, the people have nearly all moved out, those remaining <reg orig="hav-|ing">having</reg> <lb/>
enough for their present personal needs. Their cattle, though, <lb/>
are suffering and dying off quite fast, as the confinement on rafts <lb/>
and the food they get breeds disease.</p>
<p>After a short stop we started, and soon came to a section where <lb/>
there were many open fields and cabins thickly scattered about. <lb/>
Here were seen more pictures of distress. On the inside of the <lb/>
houses the inmates had built on boxes a scaffold on which they <lb/>
placed the furniture. The bed-posts were sawed off on top, as the <lb/>
ceiling was not more than four feet from the improvised floor. The <lb/>
buildings looked very insecure, and threaten every moment to float <lb/>
off. Near the houses were cattle standing breast high in the water, <lb/>
perfectly impassive. They did not move in their places, but stood <lb/>
patiently waiting for help to come. The sight was a distressing one, <lb/>
and the poor creatures will be sure to die unless speedily rescued. <lb/>
Cattle differ from horses in this peculiar quality. A horse, after <reg orig="find-|ing">finding</reg> <lb/>
no relief comes, will swim off in search of food, whereas a beef <lb/>
will stand in its tracks until with exhaustion it drops in the water <lb/>
and drowns.</p>
<p>At half-past twelve o'clock a hail was given from a flat-boat <lb/>
inside the line of the bank. Rounding to we ran alongside, and <lb/>
General York stepped aboard. He was just then engaged in getting <lb/>
<pb n="600" entity="DSSR_000002932_0603"/>
off stock, and welcomed the "Times-Democrat Boat" heartily, as <lb/>
he said there was much need for her. He said that the distress was <lb/>
not exaggerated in the least. People were in a condition it was <reg orig="dif-|ficult">difficult</reg> <lb/>
even for one to imagine. The water was so high there was <lb/>
great danger of their houses being swept away. It had already risen <lb/>
so high that it was approaching the eaves, and when it reaches this <lb/>
point there is always imminent risk of their being swept away. If <lb/>
this occurs, there will be great loss of life. The General spoke of <lb/>
the gallant work of many of the people in their attempts to save <lb/>
their stock, but thought that fully twenty-five per cent had perished. <lb/>
Already twenty-five hundred people had received rations from Troy, <lb/>
on Black River, and he had towed out a great many cattle, but a <lb/>
very great quantity remained and were in dire need. The water was <lb/>
now eighteen inches higher than in 1874, and there was no land <lb/>
between Vidalia and the hills of Catahoula.</p>
<p>At two o'clock the "Susie" reached Troy, sixty-five miles above <lb/>
the mouth of Black River. Here on the left comes in Little River; <lb/>
just beyond that the Ouachita, and on the right the Tensas. These <lb/>
three rivers form the Black River. Troy, or a portion of it, is <lb/>
situated on and around three large Indian mounds, circular in <lb/>
shape, which rise above the present water about twelve feet. They <lb/>
are about one hundred and fifty feet in diameter and are about <lb/>
two hundred yards apart. The houses are all built between these <lb/>
mounds, and hence are all flooded to a depth of eighteen inches on <lb/>
their floors.</p>
<p>These elevations, built by the aborigines hundreds of years ago, <lb/>
are the only points of refuge for miles. When we arrived we found <lb/>
them crowded with stock, all of which was thin and hardly able to <lb/>
stand up. They were mixed together, sheep, hogs, horses, mules, <lb/>
and cattle. One of these mounds has been used for many years as <lb/>
the grave-yard, and to-day we saw attenuated cows lying against the <lb/>
marble tomb-stones, chewing their cud in contentment, after a meal <lb/>
of corn furnished by General York. Here, as below, the <reg orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
skill of the women and girls in the management of the smaller <lb/>
pirogues was noticed. Children were paddling about in these most <lb/>
ticklish crafts with all the nonchalance of adepts.</p>
<p>General York has put into operation a perfect system in regard to <lb/>
furnishing relief. He makes a personal inspection of the place where <lb/>
it is asked, sees what is necessary to be done, and then, having two <lb/>
<pb n="601" entity="DSSR_000002932_0604"/>
boats chartered, with flats, sends them promptly to the place, when <lb/>
the cattle are loaded and towed to the pine hills and uplands of <lb/>
Catahoula. He has made Troy his headquarters, and to this point <lb/>
boats come for their supply of feed for cattle. On the opposite side <lb/>
of Little River, which branches to the left out of Black, and between <lb/>
it and the Ouachita, is situated the town of Trinity, which is hourly <lb/>
threatened with destruction. It is much lower than Troy, and the <lb/>
water is eight and nine feet deep in the houses. A strong current <lb/>
sweeps through it, and it is remarkable that all of its houses have <lb/>
not gone before. The residents of both Troy and Trinity have <lb/>
been cared for, yet some of their stock have to be furnished with <lb/>
food.</p>
<p>As soon as the "Susie" reached Troy, she was turned over to <lb/>
General York and placed at his disposition to carry out the work of <lb/>
relief more rapidly. Nearly all her supplies were landed on one <lb/>
of the mounds to lighten her, and she was headed down stream to <lb/>
relieve those below. At Tom Hooper's place, a few miles from <lb/>
Troy, a large flat, with about fifty head of stock on board, was taken <lb/>
in tow. The animals were fed, and soon regained some strength. <lb/>
To-day we go on Little River, where the suffering is greatest.</p>

<head>DOWN BLACK RIVER.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Saturday Evening,</hi> March 25.</p>
<p>We started down Black River quite early, under the direction of <lb/>
General York, to bring out what stock could be reached. Going <lb/>
down river a flat in tow was left in a central locality, and from there <lb/>
men poled her back in the rear of plantations, picking up the <lb/>
animals wherever found. In the loft of a gin-house there were <lb/>
seventeen head found, and after a gangway was built they were led <lb/>
down into the flat without difficulty. Taking a skiff with the <reg orig="Gen-|eral">General</reg>, <lb/>
your reporter was pulled up to a little house of two rooms, <lb/>
in which the water was standing two feet on the floors. In one of <lb/>
the large rooms were huddled the horses and cows of the place, <lb/>
while in the other the Widow Taylor and her son were seated on a <lb/>
scaffold raised on the floor. One or two dug-outs were drifting <lb/>
about in the room ready to be put in service at any time. When <lb/>
<pb n="602" entity="DSSR_000002932_0605"/>
the flat was brought up, the side of the house was cut away as the <lb/>
only means of getting the animals out, and the cattle were driven on <lb/>
board the boat. General York, in this as in every case, inquired if <lb/>
the family desired to leave, informing them that Major Burke, of <lb/>
"The Times-Democrat," has sent the "Susie" up for that purpose. <lb/>
Mrs. Taylor said she thanked Major Burke, but she would try and <lb/>
hold out. The remarkable tenacity of the people here to their <lb/>
homes is beyond all comprehension. Just below, at a point sixteen <lb/>
miles from Troy, information was received that the house of Mr. <lb/>
Tom Ellis was in danger, and his family were all in it. We steamed <lb/>
there immediately, and a sad picture was presented. Looking out of <lb/>
the half of the window left above water was Mrs. Ellis, who is in <lb/>
feeble health, whilst at the door were her seven children, the oldest <lb/>
not fourteen years. One side of the house was given up to the work <lb/>
animals, some twelve head, besides hogs. In the next room the <lb/>
family lived, the water coming within two inches of the bed-rail. <lb/>
The stove was below water, and the cooking was done on a fire on <lb/>
top of it. The house threatened to give way at any moment: one <lb/>
end of it was sinking, and, in fact, the building looked a mere shell. <lb/>
As the boat rounded to, Mr. Ellis came out in a dug-out, and General <lb/>
York told him that he had come to his relief; that "The <reg orig="Times-|Democrat">Times-Democrat</reg>" <lb/>
boat was at his service, and would remove his family at <lb/>
once to the hills, and on Monday a flat would take out his stock, as, <lb/>
until that time, they would be busy. Notwithstanding the deplorable <lb/>
situation himself and family were in, Mr. Ellis did not want to leave. <lb/>
He said he thought he would wait until Monday, and take the risk <lb/>
of his house falling. The children around the door looked perfectly <lb/>
contented, seeming to care little for the danger they were in. These <lb/>
are but two instances of the many. After weeks of privation and <lb/>
suffering, people still cling to their houses and leave only when there <lb/>
is not room between the water and the ceiling to build a scaffold on <lb/>
which to stand. It seemed to be incomprehensible, yet the love for <lb/>
the old place was stronger than that for safety.</p>
<p>After leaving the Ellis place, the next spot touched at was the <lb/>
Oswald place. Here the flat was towed alongside the gin-house <lb/>
where there were fifteen head standing in water; and yet, as they <lb/>
stood on scaffolds, their heads were above the top of the entrance. <lb/>
It was found impossible to get them out without cutting away a <reg orig="por-|tion">portion</reg> <lb/>
of the front; and so axes were brought into requisition and a <lb/>
<pb n="603" entity="DSSR_000002932_0606"/>
gap made. After much labor the horses and mules were securely <lb/>
placed on the flat.</p>
<p>At each place we stop there are always three, four, or more <reg orig="dug-|outs">dugouts</reg> <lb/>
arriving, bringing information of stock in other places in need. <lb/>
Notwithstanding the fact that a great many had driven a part of <lb/>
their stock to the hills some time ago, there yet remains a large <lb/>
quantity, which General York, who is working with indomitable <lb/>
energy, will get landed in the pine hills by Tuesday.</p>
<p>All along Black River the "Susie" has been visited by scores of <lb/>
planters, whose tales are the repetition of those already heard of <lb/>
suffering and loss. An old planter, who has lived on the river since <lb/>
1844, said there never was such a rise, and he was satisfied more <lb/>
than one quarter of the stock has been lost. Luckily the people <lb/>
cared first for their work stock, and when they could find it horses <lb/>
and mules were housed in a place of safety. The rise which still <lb/>
continues, and was two inches last night, compels them to get them <lb/>
out to the hills; hence it is that the work of General York is <lb/>
of such a great value. From daylight to late at night he is going <lb/>
this way and that, cheering by his kindly words and directing with <lb/>
calm judgment what is to be done. One unpleasant story, of a <reg orig="cer-|tain">certain</reg> <lb/>
merchant in New Orleans, is told all along the river. It <reg orig="ap-|pears">appears</reg> <lb/>
for some years past the planters have been dealing with this <lb/>
individual, and many of them had balances in his hands. When <lb/>
the overflow came they wrote for coffee, for meal, and, in fact, for <lb/>
such little necessities as were required. No response to these letters <lb/>
came, and others were written, and yet these old customers, with <lb/>
plantations under water, were refused even what was necessary to <lb/>
sustain life. It is needless to say he is not popular now on Black <lb/>
River.</p>
<p>The hills spoken of as the place of refuge for the people and <lb/>
stock on Black River are in Catahoula parish, twenty-four miles <lb/>
from Black River.</p>
<p>After filling the flat with cattle we took on board the family of <lb/>
T. S. Hooper, seven in number, who could not longer remain in <lb/>
their dwelling, and we are now taking them up Little River to the <lb/>
hills.</p>

<head>THE FLOOD STILL RISING.</head>
<opener>
<dateline><name type="place">Troy,</name> <date value="1882-03-27">March 27, 1882,</date> noon.</dateline>
</opener>
<p>The flood here is rising about three and a half inches every <lb/>
twenty-four hours, and rains have set in which will increase this. <lb/>
General York feels now that our efforts ought to be directed <reg orig="to-|wards">towards</reg> <lb/>
saving life, as the increase of the water has jeopardized many <lb/>
houses. We intend to go up the Tensas in a few minutes, and then <lb/>
we will return and go down Black River to take off families. There <lb/>
is a lack of steam transportation here to meet the emergency. The <lb/>
General has three boats chartered, with flats in tow, but the demand <lb/>
for these to tow out stock is greater than they can meet with <reg orig="prompt-|ness">promptness</reg>. <lb/>
All are working night and day, and the "Susie" hardly stops <lb/>
for more than an hour anywhere. The rise has placed Trinity in a <lb/>
dangerous plight, and momentarily it is expected that some of the <lb/>
houses will float off. Troy is a little higher, yet all are in the water. <lb/>
Reports have come in that a woman and child have been washed <lb/>
away below here, and two cabins floated off. Their occupants are <lb/>
the same who refused to come off day before yesterday. One would <lb/>
not believe the utter passiveness of the people.</p>
<p>As yet no news has been received of the steamer "Delia," which <lb/>
is supposed to be the one sunk in yesterday's storm on Lake <reg orig="Cata-|houla">Catahoula</reg>. <lb/>
She is due here now, but has not arrived. Even the mail <lb/>
here is most uncertain, and this I send by skiff to Natchez to get it <lb/>
to you. It is impossible to get accurate data as to past crops, etc., <lb/>
as those who know much about the matter have gone, and those <lb/>
who remain are not well versed in the production of this section.</p>
<p>General York desires me to say that the amount of rations <reg orig="for-|merly">formerly</reg> <lb/>
sent should be duplicated and sent at once. It is impossible <lb/>
to make any estimate, for the people are fleeing to the hills, so rapid <lb/>
is the rise. The residents here are in a state of commotion that can <lb/>
only be appreciated when seen, and complete demoralization has <lb/>
set in.</p>
<p>If rations are drawn for any particular section hereabouts, they <lb/>
would not be certain to be distributed, so everything should be sent <lb/>
to Troy as a centre, and the General will have it properly disposed <lb/>
of. He has sent for one hundred tents, and, if all go to the hills who <lb/>
are in motion now, two hundred will be required.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> condition of this rich valley of the Lower Mississippi, <reg orig="imme-|diately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
after and since the war, constituted one of the disastrous <lb/>
effects of war most to be deplored. Fictitious property in slaves <lb/>
was not only righteously destroyed, but very much of the work <lb/>
which had depended upon the slave labor was also destroyed or <lb/>
greatly impaired, especially the levee system.</p>
<p>It might have been expected by those who have not investigated <lb/>
the subject, that such important improvements as the construction <lb/>
and maintenance of the levees would have been assumed at once by <lb/>
the several States. But what can the State do where the people <lb/>
are under subjection to rates of interest ranging from 18 to 30 per <lb/>
cent, and are also under the necessity of pledging their crops in <lb/>
advance even of planting, at these rates, for the privilege of <reg orig="pur-|chasing">purchasing</reg> <lb/>
all of their supplies at 100 per cent profit?</p>
<p>It has needed but little attention to make it perfectly obvious that <lb/>
the control of the Mississippi River, if undertaken at all, must be <lb/>
undertaken by the national government, and cannot be compassed <lb/>
by States. The river must be treated as a unit; its control cannot <lb/>
be compassed under a divided or separate system of administration.</p>
<p>Neither are the States especially interested competent to combine <lb/>
among themselves for the necessary operations. The work must <lb/>
begin far up the river; at least as far as Cairo, if not beyond; and <lb/>
must be conducted upon a consistent general plan throughout the <lb/>
course of the river.</p>
<p>It does not need technical or scientific knowledge to comprehend <lb/>
the elements of the case if one will give a little time and attention to <lb/>
the subject, and when a Mississippi River commission has been <reg orig="con-|stituted">constituted</reg>, <lb/>
as the existing commission is, of thoroughly able men of <lb/>
different walks in life, may it not be suggested that their verdict in <lb/>
the case should be accepted as conclusive, so far as any <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> <reg orig="the-|ory">theory</reg> <lb/>
of construction or control can be considered conclusive?</p>
<p>It should be remembered that upon this board are General <reg orig="Gil-|more">Gilmore</reg>, <lb/>
General Comstock, and General Suter, of the United States <lb/>
Engineers; Professor Henry Mitchell (the most competent <reg orig="author-|ity">authority</reg> <lb/>
on the question of hydrography), of the United States Coast <lb/>
<pb n="606" entity="DSSR_000002932_0609"/>
Survey; B. B. Harrod, the State Engineer of Louisiana; Jas. B. <lb/>
Eads, whose success with the jetties at New Orleans is a warrant of <lb/>
his competency, and Judge Taylor, of Indiana.</p>
<p>It would be presumption on the part of any single man, however <lb/>
skilled, to contest the judgment of such a board as this.</p>
<p>The method of improvement proposed by the commission is at <lb/>
once in accord with the results of engineering experience and with <lb/>
observations of nature where meeting our wants. As in nature the <lb/>
growth of trees and their proneness where undermined to fall across <lb/>
the slope and support the bank secures at some points a fair depth of <lb/>
channel and some degree of permanence, so in the project of the <lb/>
engineer the use of timber and brush and the encouragement of <reg orig="for-|est">forest</reg> <lb/>
growth are the main features. It is proposed to reduce the <lb/>
width where excessive by brushwood dykes, at first low, but raised <lb/>
higher and higher as the mud of the river settles under their shelter, <lb/>
and finally slope them back at the angle upon which willows will <lb/>
grow freely. In this work there are many details connected with <lb/>
the forms of these shelter dykes, their arrangements so as to present <lb/>
a series of settling basins, etc., a description of which would only <lb/>
complicate the conception. Through the larger part of the river <lb/>
works of contraction will not be required, but nearly all the banks <lb/>
on the concave side of the bends must be held against the wear of <lb/>
the stream, and much of the opposite banks defended at critical <lb/>
points. The works having in view this conservative object may be <lb/>
generally designated works of revetment; and these also will be <lb/>
largely of brushwood, woven in continuous carpets, or twined into <lb/>
wire-netting. This veneering process has been successfully employed <lb/>
on the Missouri River; and in some cases they have so covered <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
with sediments, and have become so overgrown with willows, <lb/>
that they may be regarded as permanent. In securing these mats <lb/>
rubble-stone is to be used in small quantities, and in some instances <lb/>
the dressed slope between high and low river will have to be more <lb/>
or less paved with stone.</p>
<p>Any one who has been on the Rhine will have observed operations <lb/>
not unlike those to which we have just referred; and, indeed, most <lb/>
of the rivers of Europe flowing among their own alluvia have <lb/>
required similar treatment in the interest of navigation and <reg orig="agri-|culture">agriculture</reg>.</p>
<p>The levee is the crowning work of bank revetment, although not <lb/>
<pb n="607" entity="DSSR_000002932_0610"/>
necessarily in immediate connection. It may be set back a short <lb/>
distance from the revetted bank; but it is, in effect, the requisite <reg orig="para-|pet">parapet</reg>. <lb/>
The flood river and the low river cannot be brought into <reg orig="regis-|ter">register</reg>, <lb/>
and compelled to unite in the excavation of a single permanent <lb/>
channel, without a complete control of all the stages; and even the <lb/>
abnormal rise must be provided against, because this would endanger <lb/>
the levee, and once in force behind the works of revetment would <lb/>
tear them also away.</p>
<p>Under the general principle that the local slope of a river is the <lb/>
result and measure of the resistance of its bed, it is evident that a <lb/>
narrow and deep stream should have less slope, because it has less <lb/>
frictional surface in proportion to capacity; <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> less perimeter in <lb/>
proportion to area of cross section. The ultimate effect of levees <lb/>
and revetments confining the floods and bringing all the stages of the <lb/>
river into register is to deepen the channel and let down the slope. <lb/>
The first effect of the levees is to raise the surface; but this, by <lb/>
inducing greater velocity of flow, inevitably causes an enlargement <lb/>
of section, and if this enlargement is prevented from being made at <lb/>
the expense of the banks, the bottom must give way and the form of <lb/>
the waterway be so improved as to admit this flow with less rise. <lb/>
The actual experience with levees upon the Mississippi River, with <lb/>
no attempt to hold the banks, has been favorable, and no one can <lb/>
doubt, upon the evidence furnished in the reports of the commission, <lb/>
that if the earliest levees had been accompanied by revetment of <lb/>
banks, and made complete, we should have to-day a river navigable <lb/>
at low water and an adjacent country safe from inundation.</p>
<p>Of course it would be illogical to conclude that the constrained <lb/>
river can ever lower its flood slope so as to make levees unnecessary, <lb/>
but it is believed that, by this lateral constraint, the river as a <lb/>
conduit may be so improved in form that even those rare floods <lb/>
which result from the coincident rising of many tributaries will find <lb/>
vent without destroying levees of ordinary height. That the actual <lb/>
capacity of a channel through alluvium depends upon its service <lb/>
during floods has been often shown, but this capacity does not <lb/>
include anomalous, but recurrent, floods.</p>
<p>It is hardly worth while to consider the projects for relieving the <lb/>
Mississippi River floods by creating new outlets, since these <reg orig="sensa-|tional">sensational</reg> <lb/>
propositions have commended themselves only to unthinking <lb/>
minds, and have no support among engineers. Were the river bed <lb/>
<pb n="608" entity="DSSR_000002932_0611"/>
cast-iron, a resort to openings for surplus waters might be a <reg orig="neces-|sity">necessity</reg>; <lb/>
but as the bottom is yielding, and the best form of outlet is a <lb/>
single deep channel, as realizing the least ratio of perimeter to area <lb/>
of cross section, there could not well be a more unphilosophical <lb/>
method of treatment than the multiplication of avenues of escape.</p>
<p>In the foregoing statement the attempt has been made to condense <lb/>
in as limited a space as the importance of the subject would permit, <lb/>
the general elements of the problem, and the general features of the <lb/>
proposed method of improvement which has been adopted by the <lb/>
Mississippi River Commission.</p>
<p>The writer cannot help feeling that it is somewhat presumptuous <lb/>
on his part to attempt to present the facts relating to an enterprise <lb/>
which calls for the highest scientific skill; but it is a matter which <lb/>
interests every citizen of the United States, and is one of the <reg orig="meth-|ods">methods</reg> <lb/>
of reconstruction which ought to be approved. It is a war <lb/>
claim which implies no private gain, and no compensation except for <lb/>
one of the cases of destruction incident to war, which may well be <lb/>
repaired by the people of the whole country.</p>

<head>RECEPTION OF CAPTAIN BASIL HALL'S BOOK IN THE <lb/>
UNITED STATES.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Having</hi> now arrived nearly at the end of our travels, I am <lb/>
induced, ere I conclude, again to mention what I consider as <lb/>
one of the most remarkable traits in the national character of the <lb/>
Americans; namely, their exquisite sensitiveness and soreness <reg orig="re-|specting">respecting</reg> <lb/>
everything said or written concerning them. Of this, <lb/>
perhaps, the most remarkable example I can give is the effect <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg> <lb/>
on nearly every class of readers by the appearance of Captain <lb/>
Basil Hall's "Travels in North America." In fact, it was a sort <lb/>
of moral earthquake, and the vibration it occasioned through the <lb/>
nerves of the republic, from one corner of the Union to the other, <lb/>
<pb n="609" entity="DSSR_000002932_0612"/>
was by no means over when I left the country in July, 1831, a <lb/>
couple of years after the shock.</p>
<p>I was in Cincinnati when these volumes came out, but it was not <lb/>
till July, 1830, that I procured a copy of them. One bookseller <lb/>
to whom I applied told me that he had had a few copies before <lb/>
he understood the nature of the work, but that, after becoming <lb/>
acquainted with it, nothing should induce him to sell another. Other <lb/>
persons of his profession must, however, have been less scrupulous; <lb/>
for the book was read in city, town, village, and hamlet, steamboat, <lb/>
and stage-coach, and a sort of war-whoop was sent forth perfectly <lb/>
unprecedented in my recollection upon any occasion whatever.</p>
<p>An ardent desire for approbation, and a delicate sensitiveness <lb/>
under censure, have always, I believe, been considered as amiable <lb/>
traits of character; but the condition into which the appearance of <lb/>
Captain Hall's work threw the republic shows plainly that these <lb/>
feelings, if carried to excess, produce a weakness which amounts <lb/>
to imbecility.</p>
<p>It was perfectly astonishing to hear men who, on other subjects, <lb/>
were of some judgment utter their opinions upon this. I never <lb/>
heard of any instance in which the common-sense generally found <lb/>
in national criticism was so overthrown by passion. I do not speak <lb/>
of the want of justice, and of fair and liberal interpretation: these, <lb/>
perhaps, were hardly to be expected. Other nations have been <lb/>
called thin-skinned, but the citizens of the Union have, apparently, <lb/>
no skins at all; they wince if a breeze blows over them, unless it <lb/>
be tempered with adulation. It was not, therefore, very surprising <lb/>
that the acute and forcible observations of a traveller they knew <lb/>
would be listened to should be received testily. The extraordinary <lb/>
features of the business were, first, the excess of the rage into which <lb/>
they lashed themselves; and, secondly, the puerility of the <reg orig="inven-|tions">inventions</reg> <lb/>
by which they attempted to account for the severity with <lb/>
which they fancied they had been treated.</p>
<p>Not content with declaring that the volumes contained no word <lb/>
of truth from beginning to end (which is an assertion I heard made <lb/>
very nearly as often as they were mentioned), the whole country <lb/>
set to work to discover the causes why Captain Hall had visited the <lb/>
United States, and why he had published his book.</p>
<p>I have heard it said with as much precision and gravity as if the <lb/>
statement had been conveyed by an official report, that Captain <lb/>
<pb n="610" entity="DSSR_000002932_0613"/>
Hall had been sent out by the British government expressly for the <lb/>
purpose of checking the growing admiration of England for the <lb/>
government of the United States,&mdash;that it was by a commission <lb/>
from the treasury he had come, and that it was only in obedience <lb/>
to orders that he had found anything to object to.</p>
<p>I do not give this as the gossip of a coterie; I am persuaded that <lb/>
it is the belief of a very considerable portion of the country. So <lb/>
deep is the conviction of this singular people that they cannot be <lb/>
seen without being admired, that they will not admit the possibility <lb/>
that any one should honestly and sincerely find aught to disapprove <lb/>
in them or their country.</p>
<p>The American Reviews are, many of them, I believe, well known <lb/>
in England; I need not, therefore, quote them here, but I <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
wondered that they, none of them, ever thought of translating <lb/>
Obadiah's curse into classic American; if they had done so, on <lb/>
placing (he, Basil Hall,) between brackets, instead of (he, Obadiah,) <lb/>
it would have saved them a world of trouble.</p>
<p>I can hardly describe the curiosity with which I sat down at <lb/>
length to peruse these tremendous volumes; still less can I do <lb/>
justice to my surprise at their contents. To say that I found not <lb/>
one exaggerated statement throughout the work is by no means <lb/>
saying enough. It is impossible for any one who knows the <lb/>
country not to see that Captain Hall earnestly sought out things to <lb/>
admire and commend. When he praises, it is with evident <reg orig="pleas-|ure">pleasure</reg>; <lb/>
and when he finds fault, it is with evident reluctance and <lb/>
restraint, excepting where motives purely patriotic urge him to <lb/>
state roundly what it is for the benefit of his country should be <lb/>
known.</p>
<p>In fact, Captain Hall saw the country to the greatest possible <lb/>
advantage. Furnished, of course, with letters of introduction to <lb/>
the most distinguished individuals, and with the still more <reg orig="influen-|tial">influential</reg> <lb/>
recommendation of his own reputation, he was received in full <lb/>
drawing-room style and state from one end of the Union to the <lb/>
other. He saw the country in full dress, and had little or no <lb/>
opportunity of judging of it unhouselled, unanointed, unannealed, <lb/>
with all its imperfections on its head, as I and my family too <lb/>
often had.</p>
<p>Captain Hall had certainly excellent opportunities of making <lb/>
himself acquainted with the form of the government and the laws; <lb/>
<pb n="611" entity="DSSR_000002932_0614"/>
and of receiving, moreover, the best oral commentary upon them, <lb/>
in conversation with the most distinguished citizens. Of these <lb/>
opportunities he made excellent use; nothing important met his eye <lb/>
which did not receive that sort of analytical attention which an <lb/>
experienced and philosophical traveller alone can give. This has <lb/>
made his volumes highly interesting and valuable; but I am deeply <lb/>
persuaded, that were a man of equal penetration to visit the United <lb/>
States with no other means of becoming acquainted with the national <lb/>
character than the ordinary working-day intercourse of life, he <lb/>
would conceive an infinitely lower idea of the moral atmosphere of <lb/>
the country than Captain Hall appears to have done; and the <reg orig="inter-|nal">internal</reg> <lb/>
conviction on my mind is strong, that if Captain Hall had not <lb/>
placed a firm restraint on himself, he must have given expression to <lb/>
far deeper indignation than any he has uttered against many points <lb/>
in the American character, with which he shows from other <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg> <lb/>
that he was well acquainted. His rule appears to have <lb/>
been to state just so much of the truth as would leave on the mind <lb/>
of his readers a correct impression, at the least cost of pain to the <lb/>
sensitive folks he was writing about. He states his own opinions <lb/>
and feelings, and leaves it to be inferred that he has good grounds <lb/>
for adopting them; but he spares the Americans the bitterness <lb/>
which a detail of the circumstances would have produced.</p>
<p>If any one chooses to say that some wicked antipathy to twelve <lb/>
millions of strangers is the origin of my opinion, I must bear it; and <lb/>
were the question one of mere idle speculation, I certainly would not <lb/>
court the abuse I must meet for stating it. But it is not so.</p>
<p>The candor which he expresses, and evidently feels, they mistake <lb/>
for irony, or totally distrust; his unwillingness to give pain to <reg orig="per-|sons">persons</reg> <lb/>
from whom he has received kindness, they scornfully reject as <lb/>
affectation, and although they must know right well, in their own <lb/>
secret hearts, how infinitely more they lay at his mercy than he has <lb/>
chosen to betray; they pretend, even to themselves, that he has <lb/>
exaggerated the bad points of their character and institutions; <lb/>
whereas, the truth is, that he has let them off with a degree of <lb/>
tenderness which may be quite suitable for him to exercise, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg> <lb/>
little merited; while, at the same time, he has most <reg orig="industri-|ously">industriously</reg> <lb/>
magnified their merits, whenever he could possibly find <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
favorable.</p>

would go in search, and never fail of finding each stuck through <lb/>
the heart of a deer. She had then only to drag them into the <lb/>
lodge and prepare their food. Thus she lived till she attained <lb/>
womanhood, when one day her brother, whose name was Iamo, said <lb/>
to her: "Sister, the time is at hand when you will be ill. Listen to <lb/>
my advice. If you do not, it will probably be the cause of my death. <lb/>
Take the implements with which we kindle our fires. Go some <lb/>
distance from our lodge and build a separate fire. When you are <lb/>
in want of food, I will tell you where to find it. You must cook <lb/>
for yourself, and I will for myself. When you are ill, do not <lb/>
attempt to come near the lodge, or bring any of the utensils you <lb/>
use. Be sure always to fasten to your belt the implements you <lb/>
need, for you do not know when the time will come. As for <lb/>
myself, I must do the best I can." His sister promised to obey <lb/>
him in all he had said.</p>
<p>Shortly after, her brother had cause to go from home. She was <lb/>
alone in her lodge, combing her hair. She had just untied the belt <lb/>
to which the implements were fastened, when suddenly the event, <lb/>
to which her brother had alluded, occurred. She ran out of the <lb/>
lodge, but in her haste forgot the belt. Afraid to return, she stood <lb/>
for some time thinking. Finally, she decided to enter the lodge <lb/>
and get it. For, thought she, my brother is not at home, and I <lb/>
will stay but a moment to catch hold of it. She went back. <reg orig="Run-|ning">Running</reg> <lb/>
in suddenly, she caught hold of it, and was coming out when <lb/>
her brother came in sight. He knew what was the matter. "Oh," <lb/>
he said, "did I not tell you to take care? But now you have killed <lb/>
me." She was going on her way, but her brother said to her, <lb/>
<pb n="613" entity="DSSR_000002932_0616"/>
"What can you do there now? The accident has happened. Go <lb/>
in, and stay where you have always stayed. And what will become <lb/>
of you? You have killed me."</p>
<p>He then laid aside his hunting-dress and accoutrements, and soon <lb/>
after both his feet began to turn black, so that he could not move. <lb/>
Still he directed his sister where to place the arrows, that she might <lb/>
always have food. The inflammation continued to increase, and had <lb/>
now reached his first rib; and he said: "Sister, my end is near. You <lb/>
must do as I tell you. You see my medicine-sack, and my <reg orig="war-|club">war-club</reg> <lb/>
tied to it. It contains all my medicines, and my war-plumes, <lb/>
and my paints of all colors. As soon as the inflammation reaches my <lb/>
breast, you will take my war-club. It has a sharp point, and you <lb/>
will cut off my head. When it is free from my body, take it, place <lb/>
its neck in the sack, which you must open at one end. Then hang <lb/>
it up in its former place. Do not forget my bow and arrows. One <lb/>
of the last you will take to procure food. The remainder, tie in <lb/>
my sack, and then hang it up, so that I can look towards the door. <lb/>
Now and then I will speak to you, but not often." His sister again <lb/>
promised to obey.</p>
<p>In a little time his breast was affected. "Now," said he, "take <lb/>
the club and strike off my head." She was afraid, but he told her <lb/>
to muster courage. "<hi rend="italic">Strike</hi>" said he, and a smile was on his face. <lb/>
Mustering all her courage, she gave the blow and cut off the head. <lb/>
"Now," said the head, "place me where I told you." And <reg orig="fear-|fully">fearfully</reg> <lb/>
she obeyed it in all its commands. Retaining its animation, <lb/>
it looked around the lodge as usual, and it would command its sister <lb/>
to go in such places as it thought would procure for her the flesh of <lb/>
different animals she needed. One day the head said: "The time <lb/>
is not distant when I shall be freed from this situation, and I shall <lb/>
have to undergo many sore evils. So the superior manito decrees, <lb/>
and I must bear all patiently." In this situation we must leave the <lb/>
head.</p>
<p>In a certain part of the country was a village inhabited by a <lb/>
numerous and warlike band of Indians. In this village was a <lb/>
family of ten young men&mdash;brothers. It was in the spring of the <lb/>
year that the youngest of these blackened his face and fasted. His <lb/>
dreams were propitious. Having ended his fast, he went secretly <lb/>
for his brothers at night, so that none in the village could overhear <lb/>
or find out the direction they intended to go. Though their drum <lb/>
<pb n="614" entity="DSSR_000002932_0617"/>
was heard, yet that was a common occurrence. Having ended the <lb/>
usual formalities, he told how favorable his dreams were, and that <lb/>
he had called them together to know if they would accompany him <lb/>
in a war excursion. They all answered they would. The third <lb/>
brother from the eldest, noted for his oddities, coming up with <lb/>
his war-club when his brother had ceased speaking, jumped up. <lb/>
"Yes," said he, "I will go, and this will be the way I will treat <lb/>
those I am going to fight;" and he struck the post in the centre of <lb/>
the lodge, and gave a yell. The others spoke to him, saying: <lb/>
"Slow, slow, Mudjikewis, when you are in other people's lodges." <lb/>
So he sat down. Then, in turn, they took the drum, and sang their <lb/>
songs, and closed with a feast. The youngest told them not to <lb/>
whisper their intention to their wives, but secretly to prepare for <lb/>
their journey. They all promised obedience, and Mudjikewis was <lb/>
the first to say so.</p>
<p>The time for their departure drew near. Word was given to <lb/>
assemble on a certain night, when they would depart immediately. <lb/>
Mudjikewis was loud in his demands for his moccasins. Several <lb/>
times his wife asked him the reason. "Besides," said she, "you <lb/>
have a good pair on." "Quick, quick," said he, "since you must <lb/>
know, we are going on a war excursion; so be quick." He thus <lb/>
revealed the secret. That night they met and started. The snow <lb/>
was on the ground, and they travelled all night, lest others should <lb/>
follow them. When it was daylight, the leader took snow and <lb/>
made a ball of it, then tossing it into the air, he said: "It was in <lb/>
this way I saw snow fall in a dream, so that I could not be tracked." <lb/>
And he told them to keep close to each other for fear of losing <lb/>
themselves, as the snow began to fall in very large flakes. Near as <lb/>
they walked, it was with difficulty they could see each other. The <lb/>
snow continued falling all that day and the following night, so it <lb/>
was impossible to track them.</p>
<p>They had now walked for several days, and Mudjikewis was <lb/>
always in the rear. One day, running suddenly forward, he gave <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">saw-saw-quan,</hi><ref target="n27" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
<note id="n27" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>War-whoop.</p></note>
 and struck a tree with his war-club, and it broke <lb/>
into pieces as if struck with lightning. "Brothers," said he, "this <lb/>
will be the way I will serve those we are going to fight." The <lb/>
leader answered, "Slow, slow, Mudjikewis, the one I lead you to is <lb/>
<pb n="615" entity="DSSR_000002932_0618"/>
not to be thought of so lightly." Again he fell back and thought <lb/>
to himself: "What! what! who can this be he is leading us to?" <lb/>
He felt fearful and was silent. Day after day they travelled on, <lb/>
till they came to an extensive plain, on the borders of which human <lb/>
bones were bleaching in the sun. The leader spoke: "They are <lb/>
the bones of those who have gone before us. None has ever yet <lb/>
returned to tell the sad tale of their fate." Again Mudjikewis <lb/>
became restless, and, running forward, gave the accustomed yell. <lb/>
Advancing to a large rock which stood above the ground, he struck <lb/>
it, and it fell to pieces. "See, brothers," said he, "thus will I <lb/>
treat those whom we are going to fight." "Still, still," once more <lb/>
said the leader; "he to whom I am leading you is not to be <reg orig="com-|pared">compared</reg> <lb/>
to the rock."</p>
<p>Mudjikewis fell back thoughtful, saying to himself: "I wonder <lb/>
who this can be that he is going to attack;" and he was afraid. <lb/>
Still they continued to see the remains of former warriors, who had <lb/>
been to the place where they were now going, some of whom had <lb/>
retreated as far back as the place where they first saw the bones, <lb/>
beyond which no one had ever escaped. At last they came to a <lb/>
piece of rising ground, from which they plainly distinguished, <lb/>
sleeping on a distant mountain, a mammoth bear.</p>
<p>The distance between them was very great, but the size of the <lb/>
animal caused him to be plainly seen. "There," said the leader, <lb/>
"it is he to whom I am leading you; here our troubles will <reg orig="com-|mence">commence</reg>, <lb/>
for he is a mishemokwa and a manito. It is he who has <lb/>
that we prize so dearly (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> wampum), to obtain which, the <reg orig="war-|riors">warriors</reg> <lb/>
whose bones we saw, sacrificed their lives. You must not <lb/>
be fearful; be manly. We shall find him asleep." Then the <lb/>
leader went forward and touched the belt around the animal's neck. <lb/>
"This," said he, "is what we must get. It contains the wampum." <lb/>
Then they requested the eldest to try and slip the belt over the <lb/>
bear's head, who appeared to be fast asleep, as he was not in the <lb/>
least disturbed by the attempt to obtain the belt. All their efforts <lb/>
were in vain, till it came to the one next the youngest. He tried, <lb/>
and the belt moved nearly over the monster's head, but he could <lb/>
get it no farther. Then the youngest one, and the leader, made his <lb/>
attempt, and succeeded. Placing it on the back of the oldest, he <lb/>
said, "Now we must run," and off they started. When one became <lb/>
fatigued with its weight, another would relieve him. Thus they <lb/>
<pb n="616" entity="DSSR_000002932_0619"/>
ran till they had passed the bones of all former warriors, and were <lb/>
some distance beyond, when, looking back, they saw the monster <lb/>
slowly rising. He stood some time before he missed his wampum. <lb/>
Soon they heard his tremendous howl, like distant thunder, slowly <lb/>
filling all the sky; and then they heard him speak and say, "Who <lb/>
can it be that has dared to steal my wampum? earth is not so <lb/>
large but that I can find them;" and he descended from the hill in <lb/>
pursuit. As if convulsed, the earth shook with every jump he <lb/>
made. Very soon he approached the party. They, however, kept <lb/>
the belt, exchanging it from one to another, and encouraging each <lb/>
other; but he gained on them fast. "Brothers," said the leader, <lb/>
"has never any one of you, when fasting, dreamed of some friendly <lb/>
spirit who would aid you as a guardian?" A dead silence followed. <lb/>
"Well," said he, "fasting, I dreamed of being in danger of instant <lb/>
death, when I saw a small lodge, with smoke curling from its top. <lb/>
An old man lived in it, and I dreamed he helped me; and may it <lb/>
be verified soon," he said, running forward and giving the peculiar <lb/>
yell, and a howl as if the sounds came from the depths of his <lb/>
stomach, and what is called <hi rend="italic">checaudum.</hi> Getting upon a piece of <lb/>
rising ground, behold! a lodge, with smoke curling from its top, <lb/>
appeared. This gave them all new strength, and they ran forward <lb/>
and entered it. The leader spoke to the old man who sat in the <lb/>
lodge, saying, "Nemesho, help us; we claim your protection, for <lb/>
the great bear will kill us." "Sit down and eat, my <reg orig="grandchil-|dren">grandchildren</reg>," <lb/>
said the old man. "Who is a great manito?" said he. <lb/>
"There is none but me; but let me look," and he opened the door <lb/>
of the lodge, when, lo! at a little distance he saw the enraged <lb/>
animal coming on, with slow but powerful leaps. He closed the <lb/>
door. "Yes," said he, "he is indeed a great manito: my <reg orig="grand-|children">grandchildren</reg>, <lb/>
you will be the cause of my losing my life; you asked my <lb/>
protection, and I granted it; so now, come what may, I will protect <lb/>
you. When the bear arrives at the door, you must run out of the <lb/>
other door of the lodge." Then putting his hand to the side of the <lb/>
lodge where he sat, he brought out a bag which he opened. Taking <lb/>
out two small black dogs, he placed them before him. "These are <lb/>
the ones I use when I fight," said he; and he commenced patting <lb/>
with both hands the sides of one of them, and he began to swell <lb/>
out, so that he soon filled the lodge by his bulk; and he had great <lb/>
strong teeth. When he attained his full size he growled, and from <lb/>
<pb n="617" entity="DSSR_000002932_0620"/>
that moment, as from instinct, he jumped out at the door and met <lb/>
the bear, who in another leap would have reached the lodge. A <lb/>
terrible combat ensued. The skies rang with the howls of the <lb/>
fierce monsters. The remaining dog soon took the field. The <lb/>
brothers, at the onset, took the advice of the old man, and escaped <lb/>
through the opposite side of the lodge. They had not proceeded <lb/>
far before they heard the dying cry of one of the dogs, and soon <lb/>
after of the other. "Well," said the leader, "the old man will <lb/>
share their fate: so run; he will soon be after us." They started <lb/>
with fresh vigor, for they had received food from the old man: but <lb/>
very soon the bear came in sight, and again was fast gaining upon <lb/>
them. Again the leader asked the brothers if they could do nothing <lb/>
for their safety. All were silent. The leader, running forward, <lb/>
did as before. "I dreamed," he cried, "that, being in great trouble, <lb/>
an old man helped me who was a manito; we shall soon see his <lb/>
lodge." Taking courage, they still went on. After going a short <lb/>
distance they saw the lodge of the old manito. They entered <reg orig="im-|mediately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
and claimed his protection, telling him a manito was <lb/>
after them. The old man, setting meat before them, said: "Eat! <lb/>
who is a manito? there is no manito but me; there is none whom <lb/>
I fear;" and the earth trembled as the monster advanced. The <lb/>
old man opened the door and saw him coming. He shut it slowly, <lb/>
and said: "Yes, my grandchildren, you have brought trouble upon <lb/>
me." Procuring his medicine-sack, he took out his small war-clubs <lb/>
of black stone, and told the young men to run through the other <lb/>
side of the lodge. As he handled the clubs, they became very large, <lb/>
and the old man stepped out just as the bear reached the door. <lb/>
Then striking him with one of the clubs, it broke in pieces; the <lb/>
bear stumbled. Renewing the attempt with the other war-club, <lb/>
that also was broken, but the bear fell senseless. Each blow the <lb/>
old man gave him sounded like a clap of thunder, and the howls of <lb/>
the bear ran along till they filled the heavens.</p>
<p>The young men had now run some distance, when they looked <lb/>
back. They could see that the bear was recovering from the blows. <lb/>
First he moved his paws, and soon they saw him rise on his feet. <lb/>
The old man shared the fate of the first, for they now heard his cries <lb/>
as he was torn in pieces. Again the monster was in pursuit, and fast <lb/>
overtaking them. Not yet discouraged, the young men kept on their <lb/>
way; but the bear was now so close, that the leader once more <reg orig="ap-|plied">applied</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="618" entity="DSSR_000002932_0621"/>
to his brothers, but they could do nothing. "Well," said he, <lb/>
"my dreams will soon be exhausted; after this I have but one more." <lb/>
He advanced, invoking his guardian spirit to aid him. "Once," <lb/>
said he, "I dreamed that, being sorely pressed, I came to a large <lb/>
lake, on the shore of which was a canoe, partly out of water, having <lb/>
ten paddles all in readiness. Do not fear," he cried, "we shall <lb/>
soon get it." And so it was, even as he had said. Coming to the lake, <lb/>
they saw the canoe with ten paddles, and immediately they embarked. <lb/>
Scarcely had they reached the centre of the lake, when they saw <lb/>
the bear arrive at its borders. Lifting himself on his hind legs, he <lb/>
looked all around. Then he waded into the water; then losing his <lb/>
footing he turned back, and commenced making the circuit of the <lb/>
lake. Meantime the party remained stationary in the centre to <lb/>
watch his movements. He travelled all around, till at last he came <lb/>
to the place from whence he started. Then he commenced drinking <lb/>
up the water, and they saw the current fast setting in towards his <lb/>
open mouth. The leader encouraged them to paddle hard for the <lb/>
opposite shore. When only a short distance from land, the current <lb/>
had increased so much, that they were drawn back by it, and all <lb/>
their efforts to reach it were in vain.</p>
<p>Then the leader again spoke, telling them to meet their fates <reg orig="man-|fully">manfully</reg>. <lb/>
"Now is the time, Mudjikewis," said he, "to show your <lb/>
prowess. Take courage and sit at the bow of the canoe; and when <lb/>
it approaches his mouth, try what effect your club will have on his <lb/>
head." He obeyed, and stood ready to give the blow; while the <lb/>
leader, who steered, directed the canoe for the open mouth of the <lb/>
monster.</p>
<p>Rapidly advancing, they were just about to enter his mouth, when <lb/>
Mudjikewis struck him a tremendous blow on the head, and gave the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">saw-saw-quan.</hi> The bear's limbs doubled under him, and he fell, <lb/>
stunned by the blow. But before Mudjikewis could renew it, the <lb/>
monster disgorged all the water he had drank, with a force which <lb/>
sent the canoe with great velocity to the opposite shore. Instantly <lb/>
leaving the canoe, again they fled, and on they went till they were <lb/>
completely exhausted. The earth again shook, and soon they saw <lb/>
the monster hard after them. Their spirits drooped, and they felt <reg orig="dis-|couraged">discouraged</reg>. <lb/>
The leader exerted himself, by actions and words, to cheer <lb/>
them up; and once more he asked them if they thought of nothing, <lb/>
or could do nothing for their rescue; and, as before, all were silent. <lb/>
<pb n="619" entity="DSSR_000002932_0622"/>
"Then," he said, "this is the last time I can apply to my guardian <lb/>
spirit. Now, if we do not succeed, our fates are decided." He ran <lb/>
forward, invoking his spirit with great earnestness, and gave the <lb/>
yell. "We shall soon arrive," said he to his brothers, "at the place <lb/>
where my last guardian spirit dwells. In him I place great <reg orig="confi-|dence">confidence</reg>. <lb/>
Do not, do not be afraid, or your limbs will be fear-bound. <lb/>
We shall soon reach his lodge. Run, run," he cried.</p>
<p>Returning now to Iamo, he had passed all the time in the same <lb/>
condition we had left him, the head directing his sister, in order to <lb/>
procure food, where to place the magic arrows, and speaking at long <lb/>
intervals. One day the sister saw the eyes of the head brighten, as <lb/>
if with pleasure. At last it spoke. "Oh, sister," it said, "in what <lb/>
a pitiful situation you have been the cause of placing me! Soon, <lb/>
very soon, a party of young men will arrive and apply to me for <lb/>
aid; but alas! How can I give what I would have done with so <lb/>
much pleasure? Nevertheless, take two arrows, and place them <lb/>
where you have been in the habit of placing the others, and have <lb/>
meat prepared and cooked before they arrive. When you hear <lb/>
them coming and calling on my name, go out and say, 'Alas! it <lb/>
is long ago that an accident befell him. I was the cause of it.' If <lb/>
they still come near, ask them in, and set meat before them. And <lb/>
now you must follow my directions strictly. When the bear is <lb/>
near, go out and meet him. You will take my medicine-sack, bows <lb/>
and arrows, and my head. You must then untie the sack, and <lb/>
spread out before you my paints of all colors, my war-eagle feathers, <lb/>
my tufts of dried hair, and whatever else it contains. As the bear <lb/>
approaches, you will take all these articles, one by one, and say to <lb/>
him, 'This is my deceased brother's paint,' and so on with all the <lb/>
other articles, throwing each of them as far as you can. The <reg orig="vir-|tues">virtues</reg> <lb/>
contained in them will cause him to totter; and, to complete <lb/>
his destruction, you will take my head, and that too you will cast as <lb/>
far off as you can, crying aloud, 'See, this is my deceased brother's <lb/>
head.' He will then fall senseless. By this time the young men <lb/>
will have eaten, and you will call them to your assistance. You <lb/>
must then cut the carcass into pieces, yes, into small pieces, and <lb/>
scatter them to the four winds; for, unless you do this, he will <lb/>
again revive." She promised that all should be done as he said. <lb/>
She had only time to prepare the meat, when the voice of the <lb/>
leader was heard calling upon Iamo for aid. The woman went out <lb/>
<pb n="620" entity="DSSR_000002932_0623"/>
and said as her brother had directed. But the war party being <lb/>
closely pursued, came up to the lodge. She invited them in, and <lb/>
placed the meat before them. While they were eating, they heard <lb/>
the bear approaching. Untying the medicine-sack and taking the <lb/>
head, she had all in readiness for his approach. When he came up <lb/>
she did as she had been told; and, before she had expended the <lb/>
paints and feathers, the bear began to totter, but, still advancing, came <lb/>
close to the woman. Saying as she was commanded, she then took <lb/>
the head, and cast it as far from her as she could. As it rolled <lb/>
along the ground, the blood, excited by the feelings of the head in <lb/>
this terrible scene, gushed from the nose and mouth. The bear, <lb/>
tottering, soon fell with a tremendous noise. Then she cried for <lb/>
help, and the young men came rushing out, having partially <lb/>
regained their strength and spirits.</p>
<p>Mudjikewis, stepping up, gave a yell and struck him a blow upon <lb/>
the head. This he repeated, till it seemed like a mass of brains, <lb/>
while the others, as quick as possible, cut him into very small pieces, <lb/>
which they then scattered in every direction. While thus employed, <lb/>
happening to look around where they had thrown the meat, <reg orig="wonder-|ful">wonderful</reg> <lb/>
to behold, they saw starting up and running off in every <reg orig="direc-|tion">direction</reg> <lb/>
small black bears, such as are seen at the present day. The <lb/>
country was soon overspread with these black animals. And it was <lb/>
from this monster that the present race of bears derived their origin.</p>
<p>Having thus overcome their pursuer, they returned to the lodge. <lb/>
In the mean time, the woman, gathering the implements she had <lb/>
used, and the head, placed them again in the sack. But the head <lb/>
did not speak again, probably from its great exertion to overcome <lb/>
the monster.</p>
<p>Having spent so much time and traversed so vast a country <lb/>
in their flight, the young men gave up the idea of ever <reg orig="return-|ing">returning</reg> <lb/>
to their own country, and game being plenty, they determined <lb/>
to remain where they now were. One day they moved off some <lb/>
distance from the lodge for the purpose of hunting, having left the <lb/>
wampum with the woman. They were very successful, and amused <lb/>
themselves, as all young men do when alone, by talking and jesting <lb/>
with each other. One of them spoke and said, "We have all this <lb/>
sport to ourselves; let us go and ask our sister if she will not let us <lb/>
bring the head to this place, as it is still alive. It may be pleased <lb/>
to hear us talk, and be in our company. In the mean time take food <lb/>
<pb n="621" entity="DSSR_000002932_0624"/>
to our sister." They went and requested the head. She told them <lb/>
to take it, and they took it to their hunting-grounds, and tried to <lb/>
amuse it, but only at times did they see its eyes beam with pleasure. <lb/>
One day, while busy in their encampment, they were unexpectedly <lb/>
attacked by unknown Indians. The skirmish was long contested <lb/>
and bloody; many of their foes were slain, but still they were <lb/>
thirty to one. The young men fought desperately till they were all <lb/>
killed. The attacking party then retreated to a height of ground, <lb/>
to muster their men, and to count the number of missing and slain. <lb/>
One of their young men had stayed away, and, in endeavoring to <lb/>
overtake them, came to the place where the head was hung up. <lb/>
Seeing that alone retain animation, he eyed it for some time with <lb/>
fear and surprise. However, he took it down and opened the sack, <lb/>
and was much pleased to see the beautiful feathers, one of which he <lb/>
placed on his head.</p>
<p>Starting off, it waved gracefully over him till he reached his party, <lb/>
when he threw down the head and sack, and told them how he had <lb/>
found it, and that the sack was full of paints and feathers. They all <lb/>
looked at the head and made sport of it. Numbers of the young <lb/>
men took the paint and painted themselves, and one of the party took <lb/>
the head by the hair and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Look, you ugly thing, and see your paints on the faces of <reg orig="war-|riors">warriors</reg>."</p>
<p>But the feathers were so beautiful, that numbers of them also <lb/>
placed them on their heads. Then again they used all kinds of <lb/>
indignity to the head, for which they were in turn repaid by the <lb/>
death of those who had used the feathers. Then the chief <reg orig="com-|manded">commanded</reg> <lb/>
them to throw away all except the head. "We will see," <lb/>
said he, "when we get home, what we can do with it. We will try <lb/>
to make it shut its eyes."</p>
<p>When they reached their homes they took it to the council-lodge, <lb/>
and hung it up before the fire, fastening it with raw hide soaked, <lb/>
which would shrink and become tightened by the action of the fire. <lb/>
"We will then see," they said, "if we cannot make it shut its <lb/>
eyes."</p>
<p>Meantime, for several days, the sister had been waiting for the <lb/>
young men to bring back the head; till, at last, getting impatient, <lb/>
she went in search of it. The young men she found lying within <lb/>
short distances of each other, dead, and covered with wounds. <reg orig="Vari-|ous">Various</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="622" entity="DSSR_000002932_0625"/>
other bodies lay scattered in different directions around them. <lb/>
She searched for the head and sack, but they were nowhere to be <lb/>
found. She raised her voice and wept, and blackened her face. <lb/>
Then she walked in different directions, till she came to the place <lb/>
from whence the head had been taken. Then she found the magic <lb/>
bow and arrows, where the young men, ignorant of their qualities, <lb/>
had left them. She thought to herself that she would find her <reg orig="broth-|er's">brother's</reg> <lb/>
head, and came to a piece of rising ground, and there saw some <lb/>
of his paints and feathers. These she carefully put up, and hung <lb/>
upon the branch of a tree till her return.</p>
<p>At dusk she arrived at the first lodge of a very extensive village. <lb/>
Here she used a charm, common among Indians when they wish to <lb/>
meet with a kind reception. On applying to the old man and woman <lb/>
of the lodge, she was kindly received. She made known her errand. <lb/>
The old man promised to aid her, and told her the head was hung <lb/>
up before the council-fire, and that the chiefs of the village, with <lb/>
their young men, kept watch over it continually. The former are <lb/>
considered as manitoes. She said she only wished to see it, and <lb/>
would be satisfied if she could only get to the door of the lodge. She <lb/>
knew she had not sufficient power to take it by force. "Come with <lb/>
me," said the Indian, "I will take you there." They went, and they <lb/>
took their seats near the door. The council-lodge was filled with <lb/>
warriors, amusing themselves with games, and constantly keeping up <lb/>
a fire to smoke the head, as they said, to make dry meat. They saw <lb/>
the head move, and not knowing what to make of it, one spoke and <lb/>
said: "Ha! ha! It is beginning to feel the effects of the smoke." <lb/>
The sister looked up from the door, and her eyes met those of her <lb/>
brother, and tears rolled down the cheeks of the head. "Well," <lb/>
said the chief, "I thought we would make you do something at last. <lb/>
Look! look at it&mdash;shedding tears," said he to those around him; <lb/>
and they all laughed and passed their jokes upon it. The chief, <reg orig="look-|ing">looking</reg> <lb/>
around, and observing the woman, after some time said to the man <lb/>
who came with her: "Who have you got there? I have never seen <lb/>
that woman before in our village." "Yes," replied the man, "you <lb/>
have seen her; she is a relation of mine, and seldom goes out. She <lb/>
stays at my lodge, and asked me to allow her to come with me to <lb/>
this place." In the centre of the lodge sat one of those young men <lb/>
who are always forward, and fond of boasting and displaying <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
before others. "Why," said he, "I have seen her often, and <lb/>
<pb n="623" entity="DSSR_000002932_0626"/>
it is to this lodge I go almost every night to court her." All the <lb/>
others laughed and continued their games. The young man did <lb/>
not know he was telling a lie to the woman's advantage, who by that <lb/>
means escaped.</p>
<p>She returned to the man's lodge, and immediately set out for her <lb/>
own country. Coming to the spot where the bodies of her adopted <lb/>
brothers lay, she placed them together, their feet toward the east. <lb/>
Then taking an axe which she had, she cast it up into the air, <reg orig="cry-|ing">crying</reg> <lb/>
out, "Brothers, get up from under it, or it will fall on you." <lb/>
This she repeated three times, and the third time the brothers all <lb/>
arose and stood on their feet.</p>
<p>Mudjikewis commenced rubbing his eyes and stretching himself. <lb/>
"Why," said he, "I have overslept myself." "No, indeed," said <lb/>
one of the others, "do you not know we were all killed, and that it <lb/>
is our sister who has brought us to life?" The young men took the <lb/>
bodies of their enemies and burned them. Soon after, the woman <lb/>
went to procure wives for them, in a distant country, they knew not <lb/>
where; but she returned with ten young women, which she gave to <lb/>
the ten young men, beginning with the eldest. Mudjikewis stepped <lb/>
to and fro, uneasy lest he should not get the one he liked. But he <lb/>
was not disappointed, for she fell to his lot. And they were well <lb/>
matched, for she was a female magician. They then all moved into <lb/>
a very large lodge, and their sister told them that the women must <lb/>
now take turns in going to her brother's head every night, trying to <lb/>
untie it. They all said they would do so with pleasure. The eldest <lb/>
made the first attempt, and with a rushing noise she fled through the <lb/>
air.</p>
<p>Toward daylight she returned. She had been unsuccessful, as she <lb/>
succeeded in untying only one of the knots. All took their turns <lb/>
regularly, and each one succeeded in untying only one knot each <lb/>
time. But when the youngest went, she commenced the work as <lb/>
soon as she reached the lodge; although it had always been <reg orig="occu-|pied">occupied</reg>, <lb/>
still the Indians never could see any one. For ten nights now, <lb/>
the smoke had not ascended, but filled the lodge and drove them <lb/>
out. This last night they were all driven out, and the young woman <lb/>
carried off the head.</p>
<p>The young people and the sister heard the young woman coming <lb/>
high through the air, and they heard her saying: "Prepare the body <lb/>
of our brother." And as soon as they heard it, they went to a small <lb/>
<pb n="624" entity="DSSR_000002932_0627"/>
lodge where the black body of Iamo lay. His sister commenced <lb/>
cutting the neck part, from which the neck had been severed. She <lb/>
cut so deep as to cause it to bleed; and the others who were present, <lb/>
by rubbing the body and applying medicines, expelled the blackness. <lb/>
In the mean time the one who brought it, by cutting the neck of the <lb/>
head, caused that also to bleed.</p>
<p>As soon as she arrived, they placed that close to the body, and, by <lb/>
aid of medicines and various other means, succeeded in restoring <lb/>
Iamo to all his former beauty and manliness. All rejoiced in the <lb/>
happy termination of their troubles, and they had spent some time <lb/>
joyfully together, when Iamo said: "Now I will divide the <reg orig="wam-|pum">wampum</reg>;" <lb/>
and getting the belt which contained it, he commenced with <lb/>
the eldest, giving it in equal portions. But the youngest got the <lb/>
most splendid and beautiful, as the bottom of the belt held the <reg orig="rich-|est">richest</reg> <lb/>
and rarest.</p>
<p>They were told that, since they had all once died, and were <reg orig="re-|stored">restored</reg> <lb/>
to life, they were no longer mortal, but spirits, and they were <lb/>
assigned different stations in the invisible world. Only Mudjikewis's <lb/>
place was, however, named. He was to direct the west wind, hence <lb/>
generally called Kebeyun, there to remain forever. They were <reg orig="com-|manded">commanded</reg>, <lb/>
as they had it in their power, to do good to the inhabitants <lb/>
of the earth, and, forgetting their sufferings in procuring the <reg orig="wam-|pum">wampum</reg>, <lb/>
to give all things with a liberal hand. And they were also <reg orig="com-|manded">commanded</reg> <lb/>
that it should also be held by them sacred; those grains or <lb/>
shells of the pale hue to be emblematic of peace, while those of the <lb/>
darker hue would lead to evil and war.</p>
<p>The spirits then, amid songs and shouts, took their flight to their <lb/>
respective abodes on high; while Iamo, with his sister Iamoqua, <lb/>
descended into the depths below.</p>
