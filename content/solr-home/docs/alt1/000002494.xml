<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">THE</hi> ungentle laws and customs touched upon in this tale are <reg orig="his-|torical">historical</reg>, <lb/>
and the episodes which are used to illustrate them are also <lb/>
historical. It is not pretended that these laws and customs existed in <lb/>
England in the sixth century; no, it is only pretended that inasmuch <lb/>
as they existed in the English and other civilizations of far later times, <lb/>
it is safe to consider that it is no libel upon the sixth century to <reg orig="sup-|pose">suppose</reg> <lb/>
them to have been in practice in that day also. One is quite <lb/>
justified in inferring that wherever one of these laws or customs was <lb/>
lacking in that remote time, its place was competently filled by a <lb/>
worse one.</p>
<p>The question as to whether there is such a thing as divine right of <lb/>
kings is not settled in this book. It was found too difficult. That the <lb/>
executive head of a nation should be a person of lofty character and <lb/>
extraordinary ability, was manifest and indisputable; that none but <lb/>
the Deity could select that head unerringly, was also manifest and <lb/>
indisputable; that the Deity ought to make that selection, then, was <lb/>
likewise manifest and indisputable; consequently, that He does make <lb/>
it, as claimed, was an unavoidable deduction. I mean, until the author <lb/>
of this book encountered the Pompadour, and Lady Castlemaine and <lb/>
some other executive heads of that kind; these were found so difficult <lb/>
to work into the scheme, that it was judged better to take the other <lb/>
tack in this book, (which must be issued this fall,) and then go into <lb/>
training and settle the question in another book. It is of course a <lb/>
thing which ought to be settled, and I am not going to have anything <lb/>
particular to do next winter anyway.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was in Warwick Castle that I came across the <reg orig="curi-|ous">curious</reg> <lb/>
stranger whom I am going to talk about. He <lb/>
attracted me by three things: his candid <reg orig="simplic-|ity">simplicity</reg>, <lb/>
his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, <lb/>
and the restfulness of his company&mdash;for he did all <lb/>
the talking. We fell together, as modest people <lb/>
will, in the tail of the herd that was being shown <lb/>
through, and he at once began to say things <lb/>
which interested me. As he talked along, softly, <lb/>
pleasantly, flowingly, he seemed to drift away <lb/>
imperceptibly out of this world and time, and <lb/>
into some remote era and old forgotten country; <lb/>
and so he gradually wove such a spell about me <lb/>
that I seemed to move among the spectres and <lb/>
shadows and dust and mold of a gray antiquity, <lb/>
holding speech with a relic of it! Exactly as I <lb/>
would speak of my nearest personal friends or <lb/>
enemies, or my most familiar neighbors, he spoke <lb/>
of Sir Bedivere, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Launcelot <lb/>
of the Lake, Sir Galahad, and all the other great <lb/>
names of the Table Round&mdash;and how old, old, <lb/>
unspeakably old and faded and dry and musty and ancient he came to <lb/>
look as he went on! Presently he turned to me and said, just as one <lb/>
might speak of the weather, or any other common matter&mdash;</p>
 <!--<figure rend="inline" id="f2" entity="DSSR_000002494_0028"/>-->
<pb n="18" entity="DSSR_000002494_0029"/>
<p>"You know about transmigration of souls; do you know about <lb/>
transposition of epochs&mdash;and bodies?"</p>
<p>I said I had not heard of it. He was so little interested&mdash;just as <lb/>
when people speak of the weather&mdash;that he did not notice whether I <lb/>
made him any answer or not. There was half a moment of silence, <lb/>
immediately interrupted by the droning voice of the salaried cicerone:</p>
<p>"Ancient hauberk, date of the sixth century, time of King Arthur <lb/>
and the Round Table; said to have belonged to the knight Sir <reg orig="Sagra-|more">Sagramore</reg> <lb/>
le Desirous; observe the round hole through the chain-mail in <lb/>
the left breast; can't be accounted for; supposed to have been done <lb/>
with a bullet since invention of firearms&mdash;perhaps maliciously by <lb/>
Cromwell's soldiers."</p>
<p>My acquaintance smiled&mdash;not a modern smile, but one that must <lb/>
have gone out of general use many, many centuries ago&mdash;and muttered <lb/>
apparently to himself:</p>
<p>"Wit ye well, <hi rend="italic">I saw it done.</hi>" Then, after a pause, added: "I did <lb/>
it myself."</p>
<p>By the time I had recovered from the electric surprise of this <reg orig="re-|mark">remark</reg>, <lb/>
he was gone.</p>
<p>All that evening I sat by my fire at the Warwick Arms, steeped in <lb/>
a dream of the olden time, while the rain beat upon the windows, and <lb/>
the wind roared about the caves and corners. From time to time I <lb/>
dipped into old Sir Thomas Malory's enchanting book, and fed at its <lb/>
rich feast of prodigies and adventures, breathed-in the fragrance <lb/>
of its obsolete names, and dreamed again. Midnight being come <lb/>
at length, I read another tale, for a night-cap&mdash;this which here follows, <lb/>
to-wit:</p>
<div2 type="section" id="d11">
<head>HOW SIR LAUNCELOT SLEW TWO GIANTS, AND MADE A CASTLE FREE.</head>
<p>Anon withal came there upon him two great giants, well armed, all save the heads, <lb/>
with two horrible clubs in their hands. Sir Launcelot put his shield afore him, and put <lb/>
the stroke away of the one giant, and with his sword he clave his head asunder. When his <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="DSSR_000002494_0030"/>
fellow saw that, he ran away as he were wood,<ref target="n1" n="1">*</ref>
<note id="n1" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Demented.</p></note>
 for fear of the horrible strokes, and Sir <lb/>
Launcelot after him with all his might, and smote him on the shoulder, and clave him to <lb/>
the middle. Then Sir Launcelot went into the hall, and there came afore him three score <lb/>
ladies and damsels, and all kneeled unto him, and thanked God and him of their <reg orig="deliver-|ance">deliverance</reg>. <lb/>
For, sir, said they, the most part of us have been here this seven year their <lb/>
prisoners, and we have worked all manner of silk works for our meat, and we are all great <lb/>
gentlewomen born, and blessed be the time, knight, that ever thou wert born; for thou <lb/>
hast done the most worship that ever did knight in the world, that will we bear record, and <lb/>
we all pray you to tell us your name, that we may tell our friends who delivered us out <lb/>
of prison. Fair damsels, he said, my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. And so he <lb/>
departed from them and betaught them unto God. And then he mounted upon his <lb/>
horse, and rode into many strange and wild countries, and through many waters and <reg orig="val-|leys">valleys</reg>, <lb/>
and evil was he lodged. And at the last by fortune him happened against a night <lb/>
to come to a fair courtelage, and therein he found an old gentlewoman that lodged him <lb/>
with a good will, and there he had good cheer for him and his horse. And when time <lb/>
was, his host brought him into a fair garret over the gate to his bed. There Sir Launcelot <lb/>
unarmed him, and set his harness by him, and went to bed, and anon he fell on sleep. So, <lb/>
soon after there came one on horseback, and knocked at the gate in great haste. And <lb/>
when Sir Launcelot heard this he arose up, and looked out at the window, and saw by <lb/>
the moon-light three knights come riding after that one man, and all three lashed on him <lb/>
at once with swords, and that one knight turned on them knightly again and defended <lb/>
him. Truly, said Sir Launcelot, yonder one knight shall I help, for it were shame <lb/>
for me to see three knights on one, and if he be slain I am partner of his death. And <lb/>
therewith he took his harness and went out at a window by a sheet down to the four <lb/>
knights, and then Sir Launcelot said on high, Turn you knights unto me, and leave <lb/>
your fighting with that knight. And then they all three left Sir Kay, and turned unto <lb/>
Sir Launcelot, and there began great battle, for they alight all three, and strake many <lb/>
strokes at Sir Launcelot, and assailed him on every side. Then Sir Kay dressed him for <lb/>
to have holpen Sir Launcelot. Nay, sir, said he, I will none of your help, <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg> <lb/>
as ye will have my help let me alone with them. Sir Kay for the pleasure of the <lb/>
knight suffered him for to do his will, and so stood aside. And then anon within six <lb/>
strokes Sir Launcelot had stricken them to the earth.</p>
<p>And then they all three cried, Sir knight, we yield us unto you as man of might <lb/>
matchless. As to that, said Sir Launcelot, I will not take your yielding unto me, <lb/>
but so that ye yield you unto Sir Kay the seneschal, on that covenant I will save your <lb/>
lives and else not. Fair knight, said they, that were we loth to do; for as for Sir <lb/>
Kay we chased him hither, and had overcome him had ye not been; therefore, to yield <lb/>
us unto him it were no reason. Well, as to that, said Sir Launcelot, advise you <lb/>
well, for ye may choose whether ye will die or live, for an ye be yielden, it shall be <lb/>
unto Sir Kay. Fair knight, then they said, in saving our lives we will do as thou <lb/>
commandest us. Then shall ye, said Sir Launcelot, on Whitsunday next coming <lb/>
go unto the court of King Arthur, and there shall ye yield you unto Queen Guenever, <lb/>
and put you all three in her grace and mercy, and say that Sir Kay sent you thither to <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="DSSR_000002494_0031"/>
be her prisoners. On the morn Sir Launcelot arose early, and left Sir Kay sleeping: and <lb/>
Sir Launcelot took Sir Kay's armour and his shield and armed him, and so he went to <lb/>
the stable and took his horse, and took his leave of his host, and so he departed. Then <lb/>
soon after arose Sir Kay and missed Sir Launcelot: and then he espied that he had his <lb/>
armour and his horse. Now by my faith I know well that he will grieve some of <lb/>
the court of King Arthur: for on him knights will be bold, and deem that it is I, and <lb/>
that will beguile them; and because of his armour and shield I am sure I shall ride in <lb/>
peace. And then soon after departed Sir Kay, and thanked his host.</p>
<p>As I laid the book down there was a knock at the door, and my <lb/>
stranger came in. I gave him a pipe and a chair, and made him <reg orig="wel-|come">welcome</reg>. <lb/>
I also comforted him with a hot Scotch whiskey; gave him <lb/>
another one; then still another&mdash;hoping always for his story. After <lb/>
a fourth persuader, he drifted into it himself, in a quite simple and <lb/>
natural way:</p>

<head>THE STRANGER'S HISTORY.</head>
<p>I am an American. I was born and reared in Hartford, in the State <lb/>
of Connecticut&mdash;anyway, just over the river, in the country. So I am a <lb/>
Yankee of the Yankees&mdash;and practical; yes, and nearly barren of <reg orig="senti-|ment">sentiment</reg>, <lb/>
I suppose&mdash;or poetry, in other words. My father was a <reg orig="black-|smith">blacksmith</reg>, <lb/>
my uncle was a horse doctor, and I was both, along at first. Then <lb/>
I went over to the great arms factory and learned my real trade; learned <lb/>
all there was to it; learned to make everything; guns, revolvers, <lb/>
cannon, boilers, engines, all sorts of labor-saving machinery. Why, I <lb/>
could make anything a body wanted&mdash;anything in the world, it didn't <lb/>
make any difference what; and if there wasn't any quick new-fangled <lb/>
way to make a thing, I could invent one&mdash;and do it as easy as rolling <lb/>
off a log. I became head superintendent; had a couple of thousand <lb/>
men under me.</p>
<p>Well, a man like that is a man that is full of fight&mdash;that goes <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
saying. With a couple of thousand rough men under one, one has <lb/>
plenty of that sort of amusement. I had, anyway. At last I met my <lb/>
match, and I got my dose. It was during a misunderstanding <reg orig="con-|ducted">conducted</reg> <lb/>
with crowbars with a fellow we used to call Hercules. He laid <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="DSSR_000002494_0032"/>
me out with a crusher alongside the head that <lb/>
made everything crack, and seemed to spring <lb/>
every joint in my skull and make it overlap <lb/>
its neighbor. Then the world went out in <reg orig="dark-|ness">darkness</reg>, <lb/>
and I didn't feel anything more, and didn't <lb/>
know anything at all&mdash;at least for a while.</p>
<p>When I came to again, I was sitting under an oak tree, on <lb/>
the grass, with a whole beautiful and broad country <reg orig="land-|scape">landscape</reg> <lb/>
all to myself&mdash;nearly. Not entirely; for there was a <lb/>
fellow on a horse, looking down at me&mdash;a fellow fresh out <lb/>
of a picture-book. He was in old-time iron <lb/>
armor from head to heel, with a helmet on <lb/>
his head the shape of a <reg orig="nail-|keg">nail-keg</reg> <lb/>
with slits in it; and he <lb/>
had a shield, and a sword, <lb/>
and a prodigious spear; and <lb/>
his horse had armor on, too, <lb/>
and a steel horn projecting <lb/>
from his forehead, and <reg orig="gor-|geous">gorgeous</reg> <lb/>
red and green silk <lb/>
trappings that hung down all <lb/>
around him like a bed-quilt, <lb/>
nearly to the ground.</p>
<p>"Fair sir, will ye just?" <lb/>
said this fellow.</p>

<p>"Will I which?"</p>
<p>"Will ye try a passage of arms for land or lady or for&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What are you giving me?" I said. "Get along back to your <reg orig="cir-|cus">circus</reg>, <lb/>
or I'll report you."</p>
<p>Now what does this man do but fall back a couple of hundred <lb/>
yards and then come rushing at me as hard as he could tear, with his <lb/>
nail-keg bent down nearly to his horse's neck and his long spear <lb/>
pointed straight ahead. I saw he meant business, so I was up the tree <lb/>
when he arrived.</p>
<p>He allowed that I was his property, the captive of his spear. There <lb/>
was argument on his side&mdash;and the bulk of the advantage&mdash;so I judged <lb/>
it best to humor him. We fixed up an agreement whereby I was to go <lb/>
with him and he was not to hurt me. I came down, and we started <lb/>
away, I walking by the side of his horse. We marched comfortably <lb/>
along, through glades and over brooks which I could not remember to <lb/>
have seen before&mdash;which puzzled me and made me wonder&mdash;and yet <lb/>
we did not come to any circus or sign of a circus. So I gave up the <lb/>
idea of a circus, and concluded he was from an asylum. But we never <lb/>
came to any asylum&mdash;so I was up a stump, as you may say. I asked <lb/>
him how far we were from Hartford. He said he had never heard of <lb/>
the place; which I took to be a lie, but allowed it to go at that. At <lb/>
the end of an hour we saw a far-away town sleeping in a valley by a <lb/>
winding river; and beyond it on a hill, a vast gray fortress, with <reg orig="tow-|ers">towers</reg> <lb/>
and turrets, the first I had ever seen out of a picture.</p>
<p>"Bridgeport?" said I, pointing.</p>
<p>"Camelot," said he.</p>
<p>My stranger had been showing signs of sleepiness. He caught <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
nodding, now, and smiled one of those pathetic, obsolete smiles of <lb/>
his, and said:</p>
<pb n="23" entity="DSSR_000002494_0034"/>
<p>"I find I can't go on; but come with me, I've got it all written out, <lb/>
and you can read it if you like."</p>
<p>In his chamber, he said: "First, I kept a journal; then by and by, <lb/>
after years, I took the journal and turned it into a book. How long <lb/>
ago that was!"</p>
<p>He handed me his manuscript, and pointed out the place where I <lb/>
should begin:</p>
<p>"Begin here&mdash;I've already told you what goes before." He was <lb/>
steeped in drowsiness by this time. As I went out at his door I heard <lb/>
him murmur sleepily: "Give you good den, fair sir."</p>
<p>I sat down by my fire and examined my treasure. The first part <lb/>
of it&mdash;the great bulk of it&mdash;was parchment, and yellow with age. I <lb/>
scanned a leaf particularly and saw that it was a palimpsest. Under <lb/>
the old dim writing of the Yankee historian appeared traces of a <reg orig="pen-|manship">penmanship</reg> <lb/>
which was older and dimmer still&mdash;Latin words and sentences: <lb/>
fragments from old monkish legends, evidently. I turned to the place <lb/>
indicated by my stranger and began to read&mdash;as follows.</p>

<head>CHAPTER I.<lb/> CAMELOT.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Camelot</hi>&mdash;Camelot," said I to myself. "I <lb/>
don't seem to remember hearing of it <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg>. <lb/>
Name of the asylum, likely."</p>
<p>It was a soft, reposeful summer <reg orig="land-|scape">landscape</reg>, <lb/>
as lovely as a dream, and as <reg orig="lone-|some">lonesome</reg> <lb/>
as Sunday. The air was full of the <lb/>
smell of flowers, and the buzzing of <reg orig="in-|sects">insects</reg>, <lb/>
and the twittering of birds, and <lb/>
there were no people, no wagons, there <lb/>
was no stir of life, nothing going on. The <lb/>
road was mainly a winding path with <reg orig="hoof-|prints">hoof-prints</reg> <lb/>
in it, and now and then a faint trace <lb/>
of wheels on either side in the grass&mdash; <lb/>
wheels that apparently had a tire as <lb/>
broad as one's hand.</p>
<p>Presently a fair slip of a girl, about ten <lb/>
years old, with a cataract of golden hair <lb/>
streaming down over her shoulders, came along. Around her head <lb/>
she wore a hoop of flame-red poppies. It was as sweet an outfit as <lb/>
ever I saw, what there was of it. She walked indolently along, with <lb/>
a mind at rest, its peace reflected in her innocent face. The circus <lb/>
man paid no attention to her; didn't even seem to see her. And she <lb/>
&mdash;she was no more startled at his fantastic make-up than if she was <lb/>
used to his like every day of her life. She was going by as <reg orig="indiffer-|ently">indifferently</reg> <lb/>

as she might have gone by a couple of cows; but when she <lb/>
happened to notice me, <hi rend="italic">then</hi> there was a change! Up went her <lb/>
hands, and she was turned to stone; her mouth dropped open, her <lb/>
eyes stared wide and timorously, she was the picture of astonished <lb/>
curiosity touched with fear. And there she stood gazing, in a sort <lb/>
of stupefied fascination, till we turned a corner of the wood and <lb/>
were lost to her view. That she should be startled at me instead <lb/>
of at the other man, was too many for me; I couldn't make head or <lb/>
tail of it. And that she should seem to consider me a spectacle, and <lb/>
totally overlook her own merits in that respect, was another puzzling <lb/>
thing, and a display of magnanimity, too, that was surprising in one so <lb/>
young. There was food for thought here. I moved along as one in a <lb/>
dream.</p>
<p>As we approached the town, signs of life began to appear. At <lb/>
intervals we passed a wretched cabin, with a thatched roof, and about <lb/>
it small fields and garden patches in an indifferent state of cultivation. <lb/>
There were people, too; brawny men, with long, coarse, uncombed <lb/>
hair that hung down over their faces and made them look like <lb/>
animals. They and the women, as a rule, wore a coarse tow-linen <lb/>
robe that came well below the knee, and a rude sort of sandals, and <lb/>
many wore an iron collar. The small boys and girls were always <lb/>
naked; but nobody seemed to know it. All of these people stared at <lb/>
me, talked about me, ran into the huts and fetched out their families <lb/>
to gape at me; but nobody ever noticed that other fellow, except to <lb/>
make him humble salutation and get no response for their pains.</p>
<p>In the town were some substantial windowless houses of stone <lb/>
scattered among a wilderness of thatched cabins; the streets were <lb/>
mere crooked alleys, and unpaved; troops of dogs and nude children <lb/>
played in the sun and made life and noise; hogs roamed and rooted <lb/>
contentedly about, and one of them lay in a reeking wallow in the <lb/>
middle of the main thoroughfare and suckled her family. Presently <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="DSSR_000002494_0040"/>
there was a distant blare of military music; it came nearer, still <lb/>
nearer, and soon a noble cavalcade wound into view, glorious with <lb/>
plumed helmets and flashing mail and flaunting <reg orig="ban-|ners">banners</reg> <lb/>
and rich doublets and horse-cloths and gilded <lb/>
spear heads; and through <lb/>
the muck and swine, and <lb/>
naked brats, and joyous dogs, and <lb/>
shabby huts it took its gallant way, <lb/>
and in its wake we followed. <reg orig="Fol-|lowed">Followed</reg> <lb/>
through one winding alley and <lb/>
then another,&mdash;and climbing, always <lb/>
climbing&mdash;till at last we gained the <lb/>
breezy height where the huge castle <lb/>
stood. There was an <reg orig="ex-|change">exchange</reg> <lb/>
of bugle blasts; then <lb/>
a parley from the walls, <lb/>
where men-at-arms, in <lb/>
hauberk and morion <lb/>
marched back and forth <lb/>
with halberd at shoulder under flapping banners with the rude figure <lb/>
of a dragon displayed upon them; and then the great gates were flung <lb/>

open, the drawbridge was lowered, and the head of the cavalcade <lb/>
swept forward under the frowning arches; and we, following, soon <lb/>
found ourselves in a great paved court, with towers and turrets <reg orig="stretch-|ing">stretching</reg> <lb/>
up into the blue air on all the four sides; and all about us the <lb/>
dismount was going on, and much greeting and ceremony, and <reg orig="run-|ning">running</reg> <lb/>
to and fro, and a gay display of moving and intermingling colors, <lb/>
and an altogether pleasant stir and noise and confusion.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.<lb/> KING ARTHUR'S COURT.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> moment I got a chance I slipped aside privately <lb/>
and touched an ancient common looking man on the <lb/>
shoulder and said, in an insinuating, <lb/>
confidential way&mdash;</p>
<p>"Friend, do me a kindness. Do <lb/>
you belong to the asylum, or are you <lb/>
just here on a visit or <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
like that?"</p>
<p>He looked me over <reg orig="stu-|pidly">stupidly</reg>, <lb/>
and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Marry, fair sir, <lb/>
me seemeth&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That will do," I <lb/>
said; "I reckon you <lb/>
are a patient."</p>
<p>I moved away, <lb/>
cogitating, and at the <lb/>
same time keeping an <lb/>
eye out for any chance <lb/>
passenger in his right <lb/>
mind that might come along and give me some light. I judged I had <lb/>
found one, presently; so I drew him aside and said in his ear&mdash;</p>
<p>"If I could see the head keeper a minute&mdash;only just a minute&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Prithee do not let me."</p>
 <!--<figure rend="inline" id="f9" entity="DSSR_000002494_0044"/>-->

<p>"Let you <hi rend="italic">what?</hi>"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Hinder</hi> me, then, if the word please thee better." Then he went <lb/>
on to say he was an under-cook and could not stop to gossip, though <lb/>
he would like it another time; for it would comfort his very liver to <lb/>
know where I got my clothes. As he started away he pointed and <lb/>
said yonder was one who was idle enough for my purpose, and was <lb/>
seeking me besides, no doubt. This was an airy slim boy in <reg orig="shrimp-|colored">shrimp-colored</reg> <lb/>
tights that made him look like a forked carrot; the rest of his <lb/>
gear was blue silk and dainty laces and ruffles; and he had long <reg orig="yel-|low">yellow</reg> <lb/>
curls, and wore a plumed pink satin cap tilted complacently over <lb/>
his ear. By his look, he was good-natured; by his gait, he was <reg orig="satis-|fied">satisfied</reg> <lb/>
with himself. He was pretty enough to frame. He arrived, looked <lb/>
me over with a smiling and impudent curiosity; said he had come for <lb/>
me, and informed me that he was a page.</p>
<p>"Go 'long," I said; "you ain't more than a paragraph."</p>
<p>It was pretty severe, but I was nettled. However, it never phazed <lb/>
him; he didn't appear to know he was hurt. He began to talk and <lb/>
laugh, in happy, thoughtless, boyish fashion, as we walked along, and <lb/>
made himself old friends with me at once; asked me all sorts of <reg orig="ques-|tions">questions</reg> <lb/>
about myself and about my clothes, but never waited for an <lb/>
answer&mdash;always chattered straight ahead, as if he didn't know he had <lb/>
asked a question and wasn't expecting any reply, until at last he <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg> <lb/>
to mention that he was born in the beginning of the year 513.</p>
<p>It made the cold chills creep over me! I stopped, and said, a little <lb/>
faintly:</p>
<p>"Maybe I didn't hear you just right. Say it again&mdash;and say it slow. <lb/>
What year was it?"</p>
<p>"513."</p>
<p>"513! You don't look it! Come, my boy, I am a stranger and <lb/>
friendless: be honest and honorable with me. Are you in your right <lb/>
mind?"</p>
<pb n="35" entity="DSSR_000002494_0046"/>
<p>He said he was.</p>
<p>"Are these other people in their right minds?"</p>
<p>He said they were.</p>
<p>"And this isn't an asylum? I mean, it isn't a place where they <lb/>
cure crazy people?"</p>
<p>He said it wasn't.</p>
<p>"Well, then," I said, "either I am a lunatic, or something <lb/>
just as awful has happened. Now <lb/>
tell me, honest and true, where <lb/>
am I?"</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">"In King <reg orig="Ar-|thur's">Arthur's</reg> <lb/>
Court."</hi></p>
<p>I waited a <reg orig="min-|ute">minute</reg>, <lb/>
to let that idea <lb/>
shudder its way <lb/>
home, and then <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"And <reg orig="accord-|ing">according</reg> <lb/>
to your <reg orig="no-|tions">notions</reg>, <lb/>
what year is <lb/>
it now?"</p>
<p>"<reg orig="528&mdash;nine-|teenth">528&mdash;nineteenth</reg> <lb/>

<p>I felt a <reg orig="mourn-|ful">mournful</reg> <lb/>
sinking at the <lb/>
heart, and <reg orig="mutter-|ed">muttered</reg>: <lb/>
"I shall never see my friends again&mdash;never, never again. They <lb/>
will not be born for more than thirteen hundred years yet."</p>
<p>I seemed to believe the boy, I didn't know why. <hi rend="italic">Something</hi> in me <lb/>
seemed to believe him&mdash;my consciousness, as you may say; but my <lb/>
reason didn't. My reason straightway began to clamor; that was <lb/>

  <head>"THAT WILL DO," I SAID," I RECKON YOU ARE A PATIENT."</head>
 </figure>-->
<pb n="36" entity="DSSR_000002494_0047"/>
natural. I didn't know how to go about satisfying it, because I knew <lb/>
that the testimony of men wouldn't serve&mdash;my reason would say they <lb/>
were lunatics, and throw out their evidence. But all of a sudden I <lb/>
stumbled on the very thing, just by luck. I knew that the only total <lb/>
eclipse of the sun in the first half of the sixth century occurred on the <lb/>
21st of June, A. D. 528, O. S., and began at 3 minutes after 12 noon. I <lb/>
also knew that no total eclipse of the sun was due in what to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> was <lb/>
the present year&mdash;<hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> 1879. So, if I could keep my anxiety and <lb/>
curiosity from eating the heart out of me for forty-eight hours, I should <lb/>
then find out for certain whether this boy was telling me the truth or <lb/>
not.</p>
<p>Wherefore, being a practical Connecticut man, I now shoved this <lb/>
whole problem clear out of my mind till its appointed day and hour <lb/>
should come, in order that I might turn all my attention to the <reg orig="cir-|cumstances">circumstances</reg> <lb/>
of the present moment, and be alert and ready to make <lb/>
the most out of them that could be made. One thing at a time, is my <lb/>
motto&mdash;and just play that thing for all it is worth, even if it's only two <lb/>
pair and a jack. I made up my mind to two things; if it was still the <lb/>
nineteenth century and I was among lunatics and couldn't get away, <lb/>
I would presently boss that asylum or know the reason why; and if <lb/>
on the other hand it was really the sixth century, all right, I didn't <lb/>
want any softer thing: I would boss the whole country inside of three <lb/>
months; for I judged I would have the start of the best-educated man <lb/>
in the kingdom by a matter of thirteen hundred years and upwards. <lb/>
I'm not a man to waste time after my mind's made up and there's <lb/>
work on hand; so I said to the page&mdash;</p>
<p>"Now, Clarence, my boy&mdash;if that might happen to be your name&mdash; <lb/>
I'll get you to post me up a little if you don't mind. What is the <lb/>
name of that apparition that brought me here?"</p>
<p>"My master and thine? That is the good knight and great lord <lb/>
Sir Kay the Seneschal, foster brother to our liege the king."</p>
<pb n="37" entity="DSSR_000002494_0048"/>
<p>"Very good; go on, tell me everything."</p>
<p>He made a long story of it; but the part that had immediate <lb/>
interest for me was this. He said I was Sir Kay's prisoner, and that <lb/>
in the due course of custom I would be flung into a dungeon and left <lb/>
there on scant commons until my friends ransomed me&mdash;unless I <lb/>
chanced to rot, first. I saw that the last chance had the best show, <lb/>
but I didn't waste any bother about that; time was too precious. <lb/>
The page said, further, that dinner was about ended in the great hall <lb/>
by this time, and that as soon as the sociability and the heavy <reg orig="drink-|ing">drinking</reg> <lb/>
should begin, Sir Kay would have me in and exhibit me before <lb/>
King Arthur and his illustrious knights seated at the Table Round, <lb/>
and would brag about his exploit in capturing me, and would probably <lb/>
exaggerate the facts a little, but it wouldn't be good form for me to <lb/>
correct him, and not over safe, either; and when I was done being <lb/>
exhibited, then ho for the dungeon; but he, Clarence, would find a <lb/>
way to come and see me every now and then, and cheer me up, and <lb/>
help me get word to my friends.</p>
<p>Get word to my friends! I thanked him; I couldn't do less; and <lb/>
about this time a lackey came to say I was wanted; so Clarence led <lb/>
me in and took me off to one side and sat down by me.</p>
<p>Well, it was a curious kind of spectacle, and interesting. It was an <lb/>
immense place, and rather naked&mdash;yes, and full of loud contrasts. It <lb/>
was very, very lofty; so lofty that the banners depending from the <lb/>
arched beams and girders away up there floated in a sort of twilight; <lb/>
there was a stone-railed gallery at each end, high up, with musicians <lb/>
in the one, and women, clothed in stunning colors, in the other. The <lb/>
floor was of big stone flags laid in black and white squares, rather <reg orig="bat-|tered">battered</reg> <lb/>
by age and use, and needing repair. As to ornament, there <lb/>
wasn't any, strictly speaking; though on the walls hung some huge <lb/>
tapestries which were probably taxed as works of art; battle-pieces, <lb/>
they were, with horses shaped like those which children cut out of <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="DSSR_000002494_0049"/>
paper or create in gingerbread; with men on them in scale armor <lb/>
whose scales are represented by round holes&mdash;so that the man's coat <lb/>
looks as if it had been done with a biscuit-punch. There was a <reg orig="fire-|place">fireplace</reg> <lb/>
big enough to camp in; and its projecting sides and hood, of <lb/>
carved and pillared stone-work, had the look of a <reg orig="cathe-|dral">cathedral</reg> <lb/>
door. Along the walls stood men-at-arms, in <reg orig="breast-|plate">breastplate</reg> <lb/>
and morion, with halberds for their only weapon&mdash; <lb/>
rigid as statues; and that is what they looked like.</p>
<p>In the middle of this groined and vaulted public square was an <lb/>

 </figure>
<pb n="39" entity="DSSR_000002494_0050"/>
oaken table which they called the Table Round. It was as large as a <lb/>
circus ring; and around it sat a great company of men dressed in such <lb/>
various and splendid colors that it hurt one's eyes to look at them. <lb/>
They wore their plumed hats, right along, except that whenever one <lb/>
addressed himself directly to the king, he lifted his hat a trifle just as <lb/>
he was beginning his remark.</p>
<p>Mainly they were drinking&mdash;from entire ox horns; but a few were <lb/>
still munching bread or gnawing beef bones. There was about an <lb/>
average of two dogs to one man; and these sat in expectant attitudes <lb/>
till a spent bone was flung to them, and then they went for it by <reg orig="bri-|gades">brigades</reg> <lb/>
and divisions, with a rush, and there ensued a fight which filled <lb/>
the prospect with a tumultuous chaos of plunging heads and bodies <lb/>
and flashing tails, and the storm of howlings and barkings deafened all <lb/>
speech for the time; but that was no matter, for the dog-fight was <lb/>
always a bigger interest anyway; the men rose, sometimes, to observe <lb/>
it the better and bet on it, and the ladies and the musicians stretched <lb/>
themselves out over their balusters with the same object; and all <lb/>
broke into delighted ejaculations from time to time. In the end, the <lb/>
winning dog stretched himself out comfortably with his bone between <lb/>
his paws, and proceeded to growl over it, and gnaw it, and grease the <lb/>
floor with it, just as fifty others were already doing; and the rest of <lb/>
the court resumed their previous industries and entertainments.</p>
<p>As a rule the speech and behavior of these people were gracious <lb/>
and courtly; and I noticed that they were good and serious listeners <lb/>
when anybody was telling anything&mdash;I mean in a dog-fightless <reg orig="inter-|val">interval</reg>. <lb/>
And plainly, too, they were a childlike and innocent lot; <reg orig="tell-|ing">telling</reg> <lb/>
lies of the stateliest pattern with a most gentle and winning <lb/>
naivety, and ready and willing to listen to anybody else's lie, and <lb/>
believe it, too. It was hard to associate them with anything cruel or <lb/>
dreadful; and yet they dealt in tales of blood and suffering with a <lb/>
guileless relish that made me almost forget to shudder.</p>
<pb n="40" entity="DSSR_000002494_0051"/>
<p>I was not the only prisoner present. There were twenty or more. <lb/>
Poor devils, many of them were maimed, hacked, carved, in a <reg orig="fright-|ful">frightful</reg> <lb/>
way; and their hair, their faces, their clothing, were caked with <lb/>
black and stiffened drenchings of blood. They were suffereing sharp <lb/>
physical pain, of course; and weariness, and hunger and thirst, no <lb/>
doubt; and at least none had given them the comfort of a wash, or <lb/>
even the poor charity of a lotion for their wounds; yet you never <lb/>
heard them utter a moan or a groan, or saw them show any sign of <lb/>
restlessness, or any disposition to complain. The thought was forced <lb/>
upon me: "The rascals&mdash;<hi rend="italic">they</hi> have served other people so in their <lb/>
day; it being their own turn, now, they were not expecting any better <lb/>
treatment than this; so their philosophical bearing is not an outcome <lb/>
of mental training, intellectual fortitude, reasoning; it is mere animal <lb/>
training; they are white Indians."</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.<lb/> KNIGHTS OF THE TABLE ROUND.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Mainly</hi> the Round Table talk was <lb/>
monologues&mdash;narrative accounts of <lb/>
the adventures in which these <reg orig="pris-|oners">prisoners</reg> <lb/>
were captured and their friends <lb/>
and backers killed and stripped of <lb/>
their steeds and armor. As a <reg orig="gen-|eral">general</reg> <lb/>
thing&mdash;as far as I could make out&mdash;these <reg orig="murder-|ous">murderous</reg> <lb/>
adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge <lb/>
injuries, nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings <lb/>
out; no, as a rule they were simply duels between <lb/>
strangers&mdash;duels between people who had never even <lb/>
been introduced to each other, and between whom <lb/>
existed no cause of offense whatever. Many a time I <lb/>
had seen a couple of boys, strangers, meet by chance, <lb/>
and say simultaneously, "I can lick you," and go at it <lb/>
on the spot; but I had always imagined until now, <lb/>
that that sort of thing belonged to children only, and <lb/>
was a sign and mark of childhood; but here were these <lb/>
big boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear <lb/>
up into full age and beyond. Yet there <lb/>
was something very engaging about these <lb/>
great simple-hearted creatures, something attractive and lovable. <lb/>
There did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to <lb/>
speak, to bait a fish-hook with; but you didn't seem to mind that, after <lb/>
 <!--<figure rend="inline" id="f13" entity="DSSR_000002494_0054"/>-->
<pb n="44" entity="DSSR_000002494_0055"/>
a little, because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society <lb/>
like that, and, indeed would have marred it, hindered it, spoiled its <lb/>
symmetry&mdash;perhaps rendered its existence impossible.</p>
<p>There was a fine manliness observable in almost every face; and <lb/>
in some a certain loftiness and sweetness that rebuked your belittling <lb/>
criticisms and stilled them. A most noble benignity and purity <lb/>
reposed in the countenance of him they called Sir Galahad, and <reg orig="like-|wise">likewise</reg> <lb/>
in the king's also; and there was majesty and greatness in the <lb/>
giant frame and high bearing of Sir Launcelot of the Lake.</p>
<p>There was presently an incident which centred the general interest <lb/>
upon this Sir Launcelot. At a sign from a sort of master of <reg orig="ceremo-|nies">ceremonies</reg>, <lb/>
six or eight of the prisoners rose and came forward in a body and <lb/>
knelt on the floor and lifted up their hands toward the ladies' gallery and <lb/>
begged the grace of a word with the queen. The most conspicuously <lb/>
situated lady in that massed flower-bed of feminine show and finery <reg orig="in-|clined">inclined</reg> <lb/>
her head by way of assent, and then the spokesman of the <reg orig="prison-|ers">prisoners</reg> <lb/>
delivered himself and his fellows into her hands for free pardon, <reg orig="ran-|som">ransom</reg>, <lb/>
captivity or death, as she in her good pleasure might elect; and <lb/>
this, as he said, he was doing by command of Sir Kay the Seneschal, <lb/>
whose prisoners they were, he having vanquished them by his single <lb/>
might and prowess in sturdy conflict in the field.</p>
<p>Suprise and astonishment flashed from face to face all over the <lb/>
house; the queen's gratified smile faded out at the name of Sir Kay, <lb/>
and she looked disappointed; and the page whispered in my ear with <lb/>
an accent and manner expressive of extravagant derision&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sir <hi rend="italic">Kay,</hi> forsooth! Oh, call me pet names, dearest, call me a <lb/>
marine! In twice a thousand years shall the unholy invention of <lb/>
man labor at odds to beget the fellow to this majestic lie!"</p>
<p>Every eye was fastened with severe inquiry upon Sir Kay. But he <lb/>
was equal to the occasion. He got up and played his hand like a <lb/>
major&mdash;and took every trick. He said he would state the case, exactly <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="DSSR_000002494_0056"/>
according to the facts; he would tell the simple straightforward tale, <lb/>
without comment of his own; "and then," said he, "if ye find glory <lb/>
and honor due, ye will give it unto him who is the mightiest man of <lb/>
his hands that ever bare shield or strake with sword in the ranks of <lb/>
Christian battle&mdash;even him that sitteth there!" and he pointed to Sir <lb/>
Launcelot. Ah, he fetched them; it was a rattling good stroke. Then <lb/>
he went on and told how Sir Launcelot, seeking adventures, some brief <lb/>
time gone by, killed seven giants at one sweep of his sword, and set <lb/>
a hundred and forty-two captive maidens free; and then went further, <lb/>
still seeking adventures, and found him (Sir Kay) fighting a desperate <lb/>
fight against nine foreign knights, and straightway took the battle <lb/>
solely into his own hands, and conquered the nine; and that night Sir <lb/>
Launcelot rose quietly, and dressed him in Sir Kay's armor and took <lb/>
Sir Kay's horse and gat him away into distant lands, and vanquished <lb/>
sixteen knights in one pitched battle and thirty-four in another; and <lb/>
all these and the former nine he made to swear that about <reg orig="Whitsun-|tide">Whitsuntide</reg> <lb/>
they would ride to Arthur's court and yield them to Queen <reg orig="Guen-|ever's">Guenever's</reg> <lb/>
hands as captives of Sir Kay the Seneschal, spoil of his knightly <lb/>
prowess; and now here were these half dozen, and the rest would be <lb/>
along as soon as they might be healed of their desperate wounds.</p>
<p>Well, it was touching to see the queen blush and smile, and look <lb/>
embarrassed and happy, and fling furtive glances at Sir Launcelot that <lb/>
would have got him shot in Arkansas, to a dead certainty.</p>
<p>Everybody praised the valor and magnanimity of Sir Launcelot; <lb/>
and as for me, I was perfectly amazed, that one man, all by himself, <lb/>
should have been able to beat down and capture such battalions <lb/>
of practiced fighters. I said as much to Clarence; but this mocking <lb/>
featherhead only said&mdash;</p>
<p>"An Sir Kay had had time to get another skin of sour wine into <lb/>
him, ye had seen the accompt doubled."</p>
<p>I looked at the boy in sorrow; and as I looked I saw the cloud of a <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="DSSR_000002494_0057"/>
deep despondency settle upon his countenance. I followed the <reg orig="direc-|tion">direction</reg> <lb/>
of his eye, and saw that a very old and white-bearded man, <lb/>
clothed in a flowing black gown, had risen and was standing at the <lb/>
table upon unsteady legs, and feebly swaying his ancient head and <lb/>
surveying the company with his watery and wandering eye. The <lb/>
same suffering look that was in the page's face was observable in all <lb/>
the faces around&mdash;the look of dumb creatures who know that they <lb/>
must endure and make no moan.</p>

  <head>"THE FLIES BUZZED AND BIT UNMOLESTED."</head>
 </figure>
<p>"Marry, we shall have it again," sighed the boy; "that same old <lb/>
weary tale that he hath told a thousand times in the same words, and <lb/>
that he <hi rend="italic">will</hi> tell till he dieth, every time he hath gotten his barrel full <lb/>
and feeleth his exaggeration-mill a-working. Would God I had died <lb/>
or I saw this day!"</p>
<pb n="47" entity="DSSR_000002494_0058"/>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>"Merlin, the mighty liar and magician, perdition singe him for <lb/>
the weariness he worketh with his one tale! But that men fear him <lb/>
for that he hath the storms and the lightnings and all the devils that <lb/>
be in hell at his beck and call, they would have dug his entrails out <lb/>
these many years ago to get at that tale and squelch it. He telleth <lb/>
it always in the third person, making <lb/>
believe he is too modest too glorify <lb/>
himself&mdash;maledictions light upon him, <lb/>
misfortune be his dole! <lb/>
Good friend, prithee <lb/>
call me for evensong."</p>
<p>The boy nestled <lb/>
himself upon my <lb/>
shoulder and <reg orig="pretend-|ed">pretended</reg> <lb/>
to go to sleep. The <lb/>
old man began his <lb/>
tale; and presently the <lb/>
lad was asleep in <reg orig="real-|ity">reality</reg>; <lb/>
so also were the <lb/>
dogs, and the court, <lb/>
the lackeys, and the <lb/>
files of men-at-arms. <lb/>
The droning voice droned on; a soft snoring arose on all sides and <lb/>
supported it like a deep and subdued accompaniment of wind <reg orig="instru-|ments">instruments</reg>. <lb/>
Some heads were bowed upon folded arms, some lay back <lb/>
with open mouths that issued unconscious music; the flies buzzed and <lb/>
bit, unmolested, the rats swarmed softly out from a hundred holes, and <lb/>
pattered about, and made themselves at home everywhere; and one <lb/>
of them sat up like a squirrel on the king's head and held a bit of <lb/>
cheese in its hands and nibbled it, and dribbled the crumbs in the <lb/>

king's face with na&iuml;ve and impudent irreverence. It was a tranquil <lb/>
scene, and restful to the weary eye and the jaded spirit.</p>
<p>This was the old man's tale. He said:</p>
<p>"Right so the king and Merlin departed, and went until an hermit <lb/>
that was a good man and a great leech. So the hermit searched all <lb/>
his wounds and gave him good salves; so the king was there three <lb/>
days, and then were his wounds well amended that he might ride and <lb/>
go, and so departed. And as they rode, Arthur said, I have no <lb/>
sword. No force,<ref target="n2" n="1">*</ref>
<note id="n2" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg> <p>No matter.</p></note>
 said Merlin, hereby is a sword that shall be <lb/>
yours and I may. So they rode till they came to a lake, the which <lb/>
was a fair water and broad, and in the midst of the lake Arthur was <lb/>
ware of an arm clothed in white samite, that held a fair sword in that <lb/>
hand. Lo, said Merlin, yonder is that sword that I spake of. <lb/>
With that they saw a damsel going upon the lake. What damsel is <lb/>
that? said Arthur. That is the Lady of the lake, said Merlin; and <lb/>
within that lake is a rock, and therein is as fair a place as any on <lb/>
earth, and richly beseen, and this damsel will come to you anon, and <lb/>
then speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword. Anon <lb/>
withal came the damsel unto Arthur and saluted him, and he her <lb/>
again. Damsel, said Arthur, what sword is that, that yonder the <lb/>
arm holdeth above the water? I would it were mine, for I have no <lb/>
sword. Sir Arthur King, said the damsel, that sword is mine, and <lb/>
if ye will give me a gift when I ask it you, ye shall have it. By my <lb/>
faith, said Arthur, I will give you what gift ye will ask. Well, said <lb/>
the damsel, go ye into yonder barge and row yourself to the sword, <lb/>
and take it and the scabbard with you, and I will ask my gift when I <lb/>
see my time. So Sir Arthur and Merlin alight, and tied their horses <lb/>
to two trees, and so they went into the ship, and when they came to <lb/>
the sword that the hand held, Sir Arthur took it up by the handles, <lb/>
and took it with him. And the arm and the hand went under the <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="DSSR_000002494_0060"/>
water; and so they came unto the land and rode forth. And then Sir <lb/>
Arthur saw a rich pavilion. What signifieth yonder pavilion? It is <lb/>
the knight's pavilion, said Merlin, that ye fought with last, Sir <reg orig="Pelli-|nore">Pellinore</reg>, <lb/>
but he is out, he is not there; he hath ado with a knight of <lb/>
yours, that hight Egglame, and they have fought together, but at the <lb/>
last Egglame fled, and else he had been dead, and he hath chased <lb/>
him even to Carlion, and we shall meet with him anon in the highway. <lb/>
That is well said, said Arthur, now have I a sword, now will I wage <lb/>
battle with him, and be avenged on him. Sir, ye shall not so, said <lb/>
Merlin, for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing, so that ye <lb/>
shall have no worship to have ado with him; also, he will not lightly <lb/>
be matched of one knight living; and therefore it is my counsel, let <lb/>
him pass, for he shall do you good service in short time, and his sons, <lb/>
after his days. Also ye shall see that day in short space ye shall be <lb/>
right glad to give him your sister to wed. When I see him, I will do <lb/>
as ye advise me, said Arthur. Then Sir Arthur looked on the sword, <lb/>
and liked it passing well. Whether liketh you better, said Merlin, <lb/>
the sword or the scabbard? Me liketh better the sword, said <lb/>
Arthur. Ye are more unwise, said Merlin, for the scabbard is worth <lb/>
ten of the sword, for while ye have the scabbard upon you ye shall <lb/>
never lose no blood, be ye never so sore wounded; therefore, keep well <lb/>
the scabbard always with you. So they rode unto Carlion, and by <lb/>
the way they met with Sir Pellinore; but Merlin had done such a craft <lb/>
that Pellinore saw not Arthur, and he passed by without any words. <lb/>
I marvel, said Arthur, that the knight would not speak. Sir, said <lb/>
Merlin, he saw you not; for and he had seen you ye had not lightly <lb/>
departed. So they came unto Carlion, whereof his knights were <reg orig="pass-|ing">passing</reg> <lb/>
glad. And when they heard of his adventures they marveled that <lb/>
he would jeopard his person so alone. But all men of worship said <lb/>
it was merry to be under such a chieftain that would put his person in <lb/>
adventure as other poor knights did."</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.<lb/> SIR DINADAN THE HUMORIST.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> seemed to me that this quaint lie was most <lb/>
simply and beautifully told; but then <lb/>
I had heard it only once, and that <lb/>
makes a difference; it was pleasant to <lb/>
the others when it was fresh, no doubt.</p>
<p>Sir Dinadan the Humorist was the first to awake, and <lb/>
he soon roused the rest with a practical joke of a <reg orig="suffi-|ciently">sufficiently</reg> <lb/>
poor quality. He tied some <lb/>
metal mugs to a dog's tail and turned <lb/>
him loose, and he tore around and <lb/>
around the place in a frenzy of fright, <lb/>
with all the other dogs bellowing after <lb/>
him and battering and crashing against <lb/>
everything that came in their way and <lb/>
making altogether a chaos of confusion <lb/>
and a most deafening din and turmoil; <lb/>
at which every man and woman of the <lb/>
multitude laughed till the tears flowed, <lb/>
and some fell out of their chairs and <lb/>
wallowed on the floor in ecstasy. It <lb/>
was just like so many children. Sir <lb/>
Dinadan was so proud of his exploit <lb/>
that he could not keep from telling over and over again, to weariness, <lb/>
how the immortal idea happened to occur to him; and as is the way <lb/>
with humorists of his breed, he was still laughing at it after <reg orig="every-|body">everybody</reg> <lb/>
else had got through. He was so set up that he <reg orig="conclud-|ed">concluded</reg> <lb/>
 <!--<figure rend="inline" id="f17" entity="DSSR_000002494_0064"/> -->
<pb n="54" entity="DSSR_000002494_0065"/>
to make a speech&mdash;of course a humorous speech. I think <lb/>
I never heard so many old played-out jokes strung together <lb/>
in my life. He was worse than the minstrels, worse than the <lb/>
clown in the circus. It seemed peculiarly sad to sit here, <lb/>
thirteen hundred years before I was born and listen again <lb/>
to poor, flat, worm-eaten jokes that had given me the dry <lb/>
gripes when I was a boy thirteen hundred years afterwards. <lb/>
It about convinced me that there isn't any such <lb/>
thing as a new joke possible. Everybody <lb/>
laughed at these antiquities&mdash;but then they <lb/>
always do; I had noticed that, centuries later. <reg orig="How-|ever">However</reg>, <lb/>
of course the scoffer didn't laugh&mdash;I mean the <lb/>
boy. No, he scoffed; there wasn't <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
he wouldn't scoff at. He said the <lb/>
most of Sir Dinadan's <lb/>
jokes were rotten and <lb/>
the rest were <reg orig="petri-|fied">petrified</reg>. <lb/>
I said "petrified" <lb/>
was good; as I believed, myself, that the <lb/>
only right way to classify the majestic <lb/>
ages of some of those jokes was by <reg orig="geo-|logic">geologic</reg> <lb/>
periods. But that neat idea hit the <lb/>
boy in a blank <lb/>
place, for <reg orig="geol-|ogy">geology</reg> <lb/>
hadn't <lb/>
been invented <lb/>
yet. However, <lb/>
I made a note of the remark, and calculated to educate the <lb/>
commonwealth up to it if I pulled through. It is no use to <lb/>

throw a good thing away merely because the market isn't ripe <lb/>
yet.</p>
<p>Now Sir Kay arose and began to fire up on his history-mill, with <lb/>
me for fuel. It was time for me to feel serious, and I did. Sir Kay <lb/>
told how he had encountered me in a far land of barbarians, who all <lb/>
wore the same ridiculous garb that I did&mdash;a garb that was a work of <lb/>
enchantment, and intended to make the wearer secure from hurt by <lb/>
human hands. However, he had nullified the force of the <reg orig="enchant-|ment">enchantment</reg> <lb/>
by prayer, and had killed my thirteen knights in a three-hours' <lb/>
battle, and taken me prisoner, sparing my life in order that so strange <lb/>
a curiosity as I was might be exhibited to the wonder and <reg orig="admira-|tion">admiration</reg> <lb/>
of the king and the court. He spoke of me all the time, in the <lb/>
blandest way, as "this prodigious giant," and "this horrible <reg orig="sky-|towering">sky-towering</reg> <lb/>
monster," and "this tusked and taloned man-devouring <lb/>
ogre;" and everybody took in all this bosh in the na&iuml;vest way, and <lb/>
never smiled or seemed to notice that there was any discrepancy <lb/>
between these watered statistics and me. He said that in trying <lb/>
to escape from him I sprang into the top of a tree two hundred <lb/>
cubits high at a single bound, but he dislodged me with a stone <lb/>
the size of a cow, which "all-to brast" the most of my bones, and <lb/>
then swore me to appear at Arthur's court for sentence. He <lb/>
ended by condemning me to die at noon on the 21st; and was <lb/>
so little concerned about it that he stopped to yawn before he named <lb/>
the date.</p>
<p>I was in a dismal state by this time; indeed, I was hardly enough <lb/>
in my right mind to keep the run of a dispute that sprung up as to <lb/>
how I had better be killed, the possibility of the killing being doubted <lb/>
by some, because of the enchantment in my clothes. And yet it was <lb/>
nothing but an ordinary suit of fifteen-dollar slop-shops. Still, I was <lb/>
sane enough to notice this detail, to-wit: many of the terms used in <lb/>
the most matter-of-fact way by this great assemblage of the first <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="DSSR_000002494_0067"/>
ladies and gentlemen in the land would have <lb/>
made a Comanche blush. Indelicacy is too mild <lb/>
a term to convey the idea. However, I had read <lb/>
"Tom Jones," and "Roderick Random," and <lb/>
other books of that kind, and knew that the <lb/>
highest and first ladies and gentlemen in <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg> <lb/>
had remained little or no cleaner <lb/>
in their talk, and in the morals and <lb/>
conduct which such talk implies, clear <lb/>
up to a hundred years ago; in fact clear <lb/>
into our own nineteenth century&mdash;in <lb/>
which century, broadly speaking, the <lb/>
earliest samples of the real lady and <lb/>
real gentleman <reg orig="dis-|coverable">discoverable</reg> <lb/>
in English <lb/>
history&mdash;or in <reg orig="Euro-|pean">European</reg> <lb/>
history, for that <lb/>
matter&mdash;may be said <lb/>
to have made their <lb/>

embarrass a tramp in our day. However, to the unconsciously <reg orig="indeli-|cate">indelicate</reg> <lb/>
all things are delicate. King Arthur's people were not aware <lb/>
that they were indecent, and I had presence of mind enough not to <lb/>
mention it.</p>
<p>They were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were <lb/>
mightily relieved, at last, when old Merlin swept the difficulty away <lb/>
for them with a common-sense hint. He asked them why they were <lb/>
so dull&mdash;why didn't it occur to them to strip me. In half a minute I <lb/>
was as naked as a pair of tongs! And dear, dear, to think of it: I <lb/>
was the only embarrassed person there. Everybody discussed me; <lb/>
and did it as unconcernedly as if I had been a cabbage. Queen <lb/>
Guenever was as na&iuml;vely interested as the rest, and said she had <lb/>
never seen anybody with legs just like mine before. It was the only <lb/>
compliment I got&mdash;if it was a compliment.</p>
<p>Finally I was carried off in one direction, and my perilous clothes <lb/>
in another. I was shoved into a dark and narrow cell in a dungeon, <lb/>
with some scant remnants for dinner, some moldy straw for a bed, <lb/>
and no end of rats for company.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.<lb/> AN INSPIRATION.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I was</hi> so tired that even my fears were <lb/>
not able to keep me awake long.</p>
<p>When I next came to myself, I <lb/>
seemed to have been asleep a very <lb/>
long time. My first thought was, <lb/>
"Well, what an astonishing dream <lb/>
I've had! I reckon I've waked <lb/>
only just in time to keep from <reg orig="be-|ing">being</reg> <lb/>
hanged or drowned or burned, <lb/>
or something. . . . I'll nap <lb/>
again till the whistle blows, and <lb/>
then I'll go down to the arms <reg orig="fac-|tory">factory</reg> <lb/>
and have it out with Hercules."</p>
<p>But just then I heard the harsh <lb/>
music of rusty chains and bolts, a <lb/>
light flashed in my eyes, and that <lb/>
butterfly, Clarence, stood before <lb/>
me! I gasped with surprise; my <lb/>
breath almost got away from me.</p>
<p>"What!" I said, "you here <lb/>
yet? Go along with the rest of the <lb/>
dream! scatter!"</p>
<p>But he only laughed, in his <lb/>
light-hearted way, and fell to making fun of my sorry plight.</p>
<p>"All right," I said resignedly, "let the dream go on; I'm in no <lb/>
hurry."</p>
 <!--<figure rend="inline" id="f21" entity="DSSR_000002494_0072"/>
--><pb n="62" entity="DSSR_000002494_0073"/>
<p>"Prithee what dream?"</p>
<p>"What dream? Why, the dream that I am in Arthur's court&mdash;a <lb/>
person who never existed; and that I am talking to you, who are <lb/>
nothing but a work of the imagination."</p>
<p>"Oh, la, indeed! and is it a dream that you're to be burned <reg orig="to-|morrow">to-morrow</reg>? <lb/>
Ho-ho&mdash;answer me that!"</p>
<p>The shock that went through me was distressing. I now began to <lb/>
reason that my situation was in the last degree serious, dream or no <lb/>
dream; for I knew by past experience of the life-like intensity of <lb/>
dreams, that to be burned to death, even in a dream, would be very <lb/>
far from being a jest, and was a thing to be avoided, by any means, <lb/>
fair or foul, that I could contrive. So I said beseechingly:</p>
<p>"Ah, Clarence, good boy, only friend I've got,&mdash;for you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> my <lb/>
friend, aren't you?&mdash;don't fail me; help me to devise some way of <lb/>
escaping from this place!"</p>
<p>"Now do but hear thyself! Escape? Why, man, the corridors <lb/>
are in guard and keep of men-at-arms."</p>
<p>"No doubt, no doubt. But how many, Clarence? Not many, I <lb/>
hope?"</p>
<p>"Full a score. One may not hope to escape." After a pause&mdash; <lb/>
hesitatingly: "and there be other reasons&mdash;and weightier."</p>
<p>"Other ones? What are they?"</p>
<p>"Well, they say&mdash;oh, but I daren't indeed I daren't!"</p>
<p>"Why, poor lad, what is the matter? Why do you blench? Why <lb/>
do you tremble so?"</p>
<p>"Oh, in sooth, there is need! I do want to tell you, but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Come, come, be brave, be a man&mdash;speak out, there's a good lad!"</p>
<p>He hesitated, pulled one way by desire, the other way by fear; <lb/>
then he stole to the door and peeped out, listening; and finally crept <lb/>
close to me and put his mouth to my ear and told me his fearful news <lb/>
in a whisper, and with all the cowering apprehension of one who was <lb/>
<pb n="63" entity="DSSR_000002494_0074"/>
venturing upon awful ground and speaking of things whose very <reg orig="men-|tion">mention</reg> <lb/>
might be freighted with death.</p>
<p>"Merlin, in his malice, has woven a spell about this dungeon, and <lb/>
there bides not the man in these kingdoms that would be desperate <lb/>
enough to essay to cross its lines with you! Now God pity me, I have <lb/>
told it! Ah, be kind to me, <lb/>
be merciful to a poor boy who <lb/>
means thee well; for an thou <lb/>
betray me I am lost!"</p>
<p>I laughed the only really <lb/>
refreshing laugh I <lb/>
had had for some <lb/>
time; and shouted&mdash;</p>
<p>"Merlin has <lb/>
wrought a spell! <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Merlin,</hi> forsooth! <lb/>
That cheap old <lb/>
humbug, that <reg orig="maun-|dering">maundering</reg> <lb/>
old ass? <lb/>
Bosh, pure bosh, the <lb/>
silliest bosh in the <lb/>
world! Why, it does <lb/>
seem to me that of all <lb/>
the childish, idiotic, <lb/>
chuckle-headed, <reg orig="chick-|en-livered">chicken-livered</reg> <lb/>
superstitions that ev&mdash;oh, damn Merlin!"</p>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f22" entity="DSSR_000002494_0074">
  <head>"OH, BEWARE! THESE ARE AWFUL WORDS!"</head>
 </figure>
 <p>But Clarence had slumped to his knees before I had half finished, <lb/>
and he was like to go out of his mind with fright.</p>

<p>"Oh, beware! These are awful words! Any moment these walls <lb/>
may crumble upon us if you say such things. Oh call them back <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
it is too late!"</p>
<pb n="64" entity="DSSR_000002494_0075"/>
<p>Now this strange exhibition gave me a good idea and set me to <lb/>
thinking. If everybody about here was so honestly and sincerely <lb/>
afraid of Merlin's pretended magic as Clarence was, certainly a <reg orig="supe-|rior">superior</reg> <lb/>
man like me ought to be shrewd enough to contrive some way to <lb/>
take advantage of such a state of things. I went on thinking, and <lb/>
worked out a plan. Then I said:</p>
<p>"Get up. Pull yourself together; look me in the eye. Do you <lb/>
know why I laughed?"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;but for our blessed Lady's sake, do it no more."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll tell you why I laughed. Because I'm a magician <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg>."</p>
<p>"Thou!" The boy recoiled a step, and caught his breath, for the <lb/>
thing hit him rather sudden; but the aspect which he took on was <lb/>
very, very respectful. I took quick note of that; it indicated that a <lb/>
humbug didn't need to have a reputation in this asylum; people stood <lb/>
ready to take him at his word, without that. I resumed:</p>
<p>"I've known Merlin seven hundred years, and he&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Seven hun&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Don't interrupt me. He has died and come alive again thirteen <lb/>
times, and traveled under a new name every time: Smith, Jones, <lb/>
Robinson, Jackson, Peters, Haskins, Merlin&mdash;a new alias every time <lb/>
he turns up. I knew him in Egypt three hundred years ago; I knew <lb/>
him in India five hundred years ago&mdash;he is always blethering around <lb/>
in my way, everywhere I go; he makes me tired. He don't amount to <lb/>
shucks, as a magician; knows some of the old common tricks, but has <lb/>
never got beyond the rudiments, and never will. He is well enough <lb/>
for the provinces&mdash;one-night stands and that sort of thing, you <lb/>
know&mdash;but dear me, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> oughtn't to set up for an expert&mdash;anyway not <lb/>
where there's a real artist. Now look here, Clarence, I am going to <lb/>
stand your friend, right along, and in return you must be mine. I <lb/>
want you to do me a favor. I want you to get word to the king that <lb/>
<pb n="65" entity="DSSR_000002494_0076"/>
I am a magician myself&mdash;and the Supreme Grand High-yu-<reg orig="Mucka-|muck">Mucka-muck</reg> <lb/>
and head of the tribe, at that; and I want him to be made <lb/>
to understand that I am just quietly arranging a little calamity <lb/>
here that will make the fur fly in these realms if Sir Kay's project <lb/>
is carried out and any harm comes to me. Will you get that to the <lb/>
king for me?"</p>
<p>The poor boy was in such a state that he could hardly answer me. <lb/>
It was pitiful to see a creature so terrified, so unnerved, so demoralized. <lb/>
But he promised everything; and on my side he made me promise <lb/>
over and over again that I would remain his friend, and never turn <lb/>
against him or cast any enchantments upon him. Then he worked <lb/>
his way out, staying himself with his hand along the wall, like a sick <lb/>
person.</p>
<p>Presently this thought occurred to me: how heedless I have been! <lb/>
When the boy gets calm, he will wonder why a great magician like <lb/>
me should have begged a boy like him to help me get out of this place; <lb/>
he will put this and that together, and will see that I am a humbug.</p>
<p>I worried over that heedless blunder for an hour, and called myself <lb/>
a great many hard names, meantime. But finally it occurred to me <lb/>
all of a sudden that these animals didn't reason; that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> never put <lb/>
this and that together; that all their talk showed that they didn't <lb/>
know a discrepancy when they saw it. I was at rest, then.</p>
<p>But as soon as one is at rest, in this world, off he goes on <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
else to worry about. It occurred to me that I had made <lb/>
another blunder: I had sent the boy off to alarm his betters with a <lb/>
threat I intending to invent a calamity at my leisure; now the <lb/>
people who are the readiest and eagerest and willingest to swallow <lb/>
miracles are the very ones who are the hungriest to see you perform <lb/>
them; suppose I should be called on for a sample? Suppose I should <lb/>
be asked to name my calamity? Yes, I had made a blunder; I ought <lb/>
to have invented my calamity first. "What shall I do? what can I <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="DSSR_000002494_0077"/>
say, to gain a little time?" I was in trouble again; in the deepest <lb/>
kind of trouble: . . . "There's a footstep!&mdash;they're coming. If I had <lb/>
only just a moment to think. . . . . Good, I've got it. I'm all right."</p>
<p>You see, it was the eclipse. It came into my mind, in the nick of <lb/>
time, how Columbus, or Cortez, or one of those people, played an <lb/>
eclipse as a saving trump once, on some savages, and I saw my <lb/>
chance. I could play it myself, now; and it wouldn't be any <reg orig="plagiar-|ism">plagiarism</reg>, <lb/>
either, because I should get it in nearly a thousand years ahead <lb/>
of those parties.</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f23" entity="DSSR_000002494_0077">
  <head>"HE WAS FRIGHTED EVEN TO THE MARROW."</head>
 </figure>
<p>Clarence came in, subdued, distressed, and said:</p>
<p>"I hasted the message to our liege the king, and straightway he <lb/>
had me to his presence. He was frighted even to the marrow, and was <lb/>
minded to give order for your instant enlargement, and that you be <lb/>
clothed in fine raiment and lodged as befitted one so great; but then <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="DSSR_000002494_0078"/>
came Merlin and spoiled all; for he persuaded the king that you are <lb/>
mad, and know not whereof you speak; and said your threat is but <lb/>
foolishness and idle vaporing. They disputed long, but in the end, <lb/>
Merlin, scoffing, said, 'Wherefore hath he not <hi rend="italic">named</hi> his brave <lb/>
calamity? Verily it is because he cannot.' This thrust did in a most <lb/>
sudden sort close the king's mouth, and he could offer naught to turn <lb/>
the argument; and so, reluctant, and full loth to do you the <reg orig="dis-|courtesy">discourtesy</reg>, <lb/>
he yet prayeth you to consider his perplexed case, as <lb/>
noting how the matter stands, and name the calamity&mdash;if so be you <lb/>
have determined the nature of it and the time of its coming. Oh, <lb/>
prithee delay not; to delay at such a time were to double and treble <lb/>
the perils that already compass thee about. Oh, be thou wise&mdash;name <lb/>
the calamity!"</p>
<p>I allowed silence to accumulate while I got my impressiveness <lb/>
together, and then said:</p>
<p>"How long have I been shut up in this hole?"</p>
<p>"Ye were shut up when yesterday was well spent. It is 9 of the <lb/>
morning now."</p>
<p>"No! Then I have slept well, sure enough. Nine in the morning <lb/>
now! And yet it is the very complexion of midnight, to a shade. <lb/>
This is the 20th, then?"</p>
<p>"The 20th&mdash;yes."</p>
<p>"And I am to be burned alive to-morrow." The boy shuddered.</p>
<p>"At what hour?"</p>
<p>"At high noon."</p>
<p>"Now then, I will tell you what to say." I paused, and stood <lb/>
over that cowering lad a whole minute in awful silence; then in a <lb/>
voice deep, measured, charged with doom, I began, and rose by <lb/>
dramatically graded stages to my colossal climax, which I delivered <lb/>
in as sublime and noble a way as ever I did such a thing in my life: <lb/>
"Go back and tell the king that at that hour I will smother the <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="DSSR_000002494_0079"/>
whole world in the dead blackness of midnight; I will blot out the <lb/>
sun, and he shall never shine again; the fruits of the earth shall rot <lb/>
for lack of light and warmth, and the peoples of the earth shall famish <lb/>
and die, to the last man!"</p>
<p>I had to carry the boy out myself, he sunk into such a collapse. I <lb/>
handed him over to the soldiers, and went back.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.<lb/> THE ECLIPSE.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the stillness and the darkness, realization <lb/>
soon began to supplement knowledge. The <lb/>
mere knowledge of a fact is pale; but when <lb/>
you come to <hi rend="italic">realize</hi> your fact, it takes on color. <lb/>
It is all the difference between hearing of a <lb/>
man being stabbed to the heart, and seeing it <lb/>
done. In the stillness and the darkness, the <lb/>
knowledge that I was in deadly danger took <lb/>
to itself deeper and deeper meaning all the <lb/>
time; a something which was realization <lb/>
crept inch by inch through my veins and <lb/>
turned me cold.</p>
<p>But it is a blessed provision of nature <lb/>
that at times like these, as soon as a <lb/>
man's mercury has got down to a <reg orig="cer-|tain">certain</reg> <lb/>
point there comes a revulsion, <lb/>
and he rallies. Hope springs up, and <lb/>
cheerfulness along with it, and then <lb/>
he is in good shape to do something <lb/>
for himself, if anything can be done. <lb/>
When my rally came, it came with <lb/>
a bound. I said to myself that my <lb/>
eclipse would be sure to save me, and make me the greatest man in <lb/>
the kingdom besides; and straightway my mercury went up to the <lb/>

<pb n="72" entity="DSSR_000002494_0083"/>
top of the tube, and my solicitudes all vanished. I was as happy a <lb/>
man as there was in the world. I was even impatient for to-morrow <lb/>
to come, I so wanted to gather-in that great triumph and be the <reg orig="cen-|tre">centre</reg> <lb/>
of all the nation's wonder and reverence. Besides, in a business <lb/>
way it would be the making of me; I knew that.</p>
<p>Meantime there was one thing which had got pushed into the <lb/>
background of my mind. That was the half-conviction that when the <lb/>
nature of my proposed calamity should be reported to those <reg orig="supersti-|tious">superstitious</reg> <lb/>
people, it would have such an effect that they would want to <lb/>
compromise. So, by and by when I heard footsteps coming, that <lb/>
thought was recalled to me, and I said to myself, "As sure as <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg>, <lb/>
it's the compromise. Well, if it is good, all right, I will accept; <lb/>
but if it isn't, I mean to stand my ground and play my hand for all it <lb/>
is worth."</p>
<p>The door opened, and some men-at-arms appeared. The leader <lb/>
said&mdash;</p>
<p>"The stake is ready. Come!"</p>
<p>The stake! The strength went out of me, and I almost fell down. <lb/>
It is hard to get one's breath at such a time, such lumps come into <lb/>
one's throat, and such gaspings; but as soon as I could speak, I said:</p>
<p>"But this is a mistake&mdash;the execution is to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Order changed; been set forward a day. Haste thee!"</p>
<p>I was lost. There was no help for me. I was dazed, stupefied; I <lb/>
had no command over myself; I only wandered purposelessly about, <lb/>
like one out of his mind; so the soldiers took hold of me, and pulled me <lb/>
along with them, out of the cell and along the maze of underground <lb/>
corridors, and finally into the fierce glare of daylight and the upper <lb/>
world. As we stepped into the vast inclosed court of the castle I got <lb/>
a shock; for the first thing I saw was the stake, standing in the centre, <lb/>
and near it the piled fagots and a monk. On all four sides of the <lb/>
court the seated multitudes rose rank above rank, forming sloping <reg orig="ter-|races">terraces</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="DSSR_000002494_0084"/>
that were rich with color. The king and the queen sat in their <lb/>
thrones, the most conspicuous figures there, of course.</p>
<p>To note all this, occupied but a second. The next second <reg orig="Clar-|ence">Clarence</reg> <lb/>
had slipped from some place of concealment and was pouring <lb/>
news into my ear, his eyes beaming with triumph and gladness. He <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"'Tis through <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the change was wrought! And main hard have I <lb/>
worked to do it, too. But when I revealed to them the calamity in store, <lb/>
and saw how mighty was the terror it did engender, then saw I also <lb/>
that this was the time to strike! Wherefore I diligently pretended, <lb/>
unto this and that and the other one, that your power against the sun <lb/>
could not reach its full until the morrow; and so if any would <lb/>
save the sun and the world, you must be slain to-day, whilst your <lb/>
enchantments are but in the weaving and lack potency. <reg orig="Odsbodi-|kins">Odsbodikins</reg>, <lb/>
it was but a dull lie, a most indifferent invention, but you <lb/>
should have seen them seize it and swallow it, in the frenzy of their <lb/>
fright, as it were salvation sent from heaven; and all the while was I <lb/>
laughing in my sleeve the one moment, to see them so cheaply deceived, <lb/>
and glorifying God the next, that He was content to let the meanest <lb/>
of His creatures be His instrument to the saving of thy life. Ah, how <lb/>
happy has the matter sped! You will not need to do the sun a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> <lb/>
hurt&mdash;ah, forget not that, on your soul forget it not! Only make a <lb/>
little darkness&mdash;only the littlest little darkness, mind, and cease with <lb/>
that. It will be sufficient. They will see that I spoke falsely,&mdash;being <lb/>
ignorant, as they will fancy&mdash;and with the falling of the first shadow <lb/>
of that darkness you shall see them go mad with fear; and they will <lb/>
set you free and make you great! Go to thy triumph, now! But <reg orig="remem-|ber&mdash;ah">remember&mdash;ah</reg>, <lb/>
good friend, I implore thee remember my supplication, and <lb/>
do the blessed sun no hurt. For <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sake, thy true friend."</p>
<p>I choked out some words through my grief and misery; as much as <lb/>
to say I would spare the sun; for which the lad's eyes paid me back <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="DSSR_000002494_0085"/>
with such deep and loving gratitude that I had not the heart to tell him <lb/>
his good-hearted foolishness had ruined me and sent me to my death.</p>
<p>As the soldiers assisted me across the court <lb/>
the stillness was so profound that if I had been <lb/>
blindfold I should have <reg orig="sup-|posed">supposed</reg> <lb/>
I was in a <reg orig="soli-|tude">solitude</reg> <lb/>
instead of walled <lb/>
in by four thousand people. <lb/>
There was not a movement <lb/>
perceptible in those masses <lb/>
of humanity; they were as <lb/>
rigid as stone images, and <lb/>
as pale; and dread sat upon <lb/>
every countenance. This <lb/>
hush <reg orig="continu-|ed">continued</reg> <lb/>
while I was <lb/>
being chained to the stake; it still continued while the fagots were <lb/>
carefully and tediously piled about my ankles, my knees, my thighs, <lb/>

  <head>"IT WAS A NOBLE EFFECT."</head>
 </figure>

my body. Then there was a pause, and a deeper hush, if possible, <lb/>
and a man knelt down at my feet with a blazing torch; the multitude <lb/>
strained forward, gazing, and parting slightly from their seats <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
knowing it; the monk raised his hands above my head, and his <lb/>
eyes toward the blue sky, and began some words in Latin; in this <lb/>
attitude he droned on and on, a little while, and then stopped. I <lb/>
waited two or three moments: then looked up; he was standing there <lb/>
petrified. With a common impulse the multitude rose slowly up and <lb/>
stared into the sky. I followed their eyes; as sure as guns, there was <lb/>
my eclipse beginning! The life went boiling through my veins; I was <lb/>
a new man! The rim of black spread slowly into the sun's disk, my <lb/>
heart beat higher and higher, and still the assemblage and the priest <lb/>
stared into the sky, motionless. I knew that this gaze would be <lb/>
turned upon me, next. When it was, I was ready. I was in one of <lb/>
the most grand attitudes I ever struck, with my arm stretched up <lb/>
pointing to the sun. It was a noble effect. You could <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the shudder <lb/>
sweep the mass like a wave. Two shouts rang out, one close upon <lb/>
the heels of the other:</p>
<p>"Apply the torch!"</p>
<p>"I forbid it!"</p>
<p>The one was from Merlin, the other from the king. Merlin <reg orig="start-|ed">started</reg> <lb/>
from his place&mdash;to apply the torch himself, I judged. I said:</p>
<p>"Stay where you are. If any man moves&mdash;even the king&mdash;before <lb/>
I give him leave, I will blast him with thunder, I will consume him <lb/>
with lightnings!"</p>
<p>The multitude sank meekly into their seats, and I was just <reg orig="expect-|ing">expecting</reg> <lb/>
they would. Merlin hesitated a moment or two, and I was on pins <lb/>
and needles during that little while. Then he sat down, and I took a <lb/>
good breath; for I knew I was master of the situation now. The king <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Be merciful, fair sir, and essay no further in this perilous matter, <lb/>
<pb n="76" entity="DSSR_000002494_0087"/>
lest disaster follow. It was reported to us that your powers could not <lb/>
attain unto their full strength until the morrow; but&mdash;</p>
<p>"Your Majesty thinks the report may have been a lie? It <hi rend="italic">was</hi> <lb/>
a lie."</p>
<p>That made an immense effect; up went appealing hands <reg orig="every-|where">everywhere</reg>, <lb/>
and the king was assailed with a storm of supplications that I <lb/>
might be bought off at any price, and the calamity stayed. The king <lb/>
was eager to comply. He said:</p>
<p>"Name any terms, reverend sir, even to the halving of my kingdom; <lb/>
but banish this calamity, spare the sun!</p>
<p>My fortune was made. I would have taken him up in a minute, but <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> couldn't stop and eclipse; the thing was out of the question. So I <lb/>
asked time to consider. The king said&mdash;</p>
<p>"How long&mdash;ah, how long, good sir? Be merciful; look, it <reg orig="grow-|eth">groweth</reg> <lb/>
darker, moment by moment. Prithee how long?"</p>
<p>"Not long. Half an hour&mdash;maybe an hour."</p>
<p>There were a thousand pathetic protests, but I couldn't shorten up <lb/>
any, for I couldn't remember how long a total eclipse lasts. I was in <lb/>
a puzzled condition, anyway, and wanted to think. Something was <lb/>
wrong about that eclipse, and the fact was very unsettling. If this <lb/>
wasn't the one I was after, how was I to tell whether this was the <lb/>
sixth century, or nothing but a dream? Dear me, if I could only <lb/>
prove it was the latter! Here was a glad new hope. If the boy was <lb/>
right about the date, and this was surely the 20th, it <hi rend="italic">wasn't</hi> the sixth <lb/>
century. I reached for the monk's sleeve, in considerable excitement, <lb/>
and asked him what day of the month it was.</p>
<p>Hang him, he said it was the <hi rend="italic">twenty-first!</hi> It made me turn cold <lb/>
to hear him. I begged him not to make any mistake about it; but <lb/>
he was sure; he knew it was the 21st. So, that feather-headed boy <lb/>
had botched things again! The time of the day was right for the <lb/>
eclipse; I had seen that for myself, in the beginning, by the dial that <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="DSSR_000002494_0088"/>
was near by. Yes, I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> in King Arthur's court, and I might as well <lb/>
make the most out of it I could.</p>
<p>The darkness was steadily growing, the people becoming more <lb/>
and more distressed. I now said:</p>
<p>"I have reflected, Sir King. For a lesson, I will let this darkness <lb/>
proceed, and spread night in the world; but whether I blot out the <lb/>
sun for good, or restore it, shall rest with you. These are the terms, <lb/>
to wit: You shall remain king over all your dominions, and receive <lb/>
all the glories and honors that belong to the kingship; but you shall <lb/>
appoint me your perpetual minister and executive, and give me for <lb/>
my services one per cent of such actual increase of revenue over and <lb/>
above its present amount as I may succeed in creating for the state. <lb/>
If I can't live on that, I sha'n't ask anybody to give me a lift. Is it <lb/>
satisfactory?"</p>
<p>There was a prodigious roar of applause, and out of the midst of it <lb/>
the king's voice rose, saying:</p>
<p>"Away with his bonds, and set him free! and do him homage, <lb/>
high and low, rich and poor, for he is become the king's right hand, <lb/>
is clothed with power and authority, and his seat is upon the highest <lb/>
step of the throne! Now sweep away this creeping night, and bring <lb/>
the light and cheer again, that all the world may bless thee."</p>
<p>But I said:</p>
<p>"That a common man should be shamed before the world, is <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg>; <lb/>
but it were dishonor to the <hi rend="italic">king</hi> if any that saw his minister <lb/>
naked should not also see him delivered from his shame. If I might <lb/>
ask that my clothes be brought again&mdash;"</p>
<p>"They are not meet," the king broke in. "Fetch raiment of <lb/>
another sort; clothe him like a prince!"</p>
<p>My idea worked. I wanted to keep things as they were till the <lb/>
eclipse was total, otherwise they would be trying again to get me to <lb/>
dismiss the darkness, and of course I couldn't do it. Sending for the <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="DSSR_000002494_0089"/>
clothes gained some delay, but not enough. So I had to make <lb/>
another excuse. I said it would be but natural if the king should <lb/>
change his mind and repent to some extent of what he had done <lb/>
under excitement; therefore I would let the darkness grow a while, <lb/>
and if at the end of a reasonable time the king had kept his mind the <lb/>
same, the darkness should be dismissed. Neither the king nor <reg orig="any-|body">anybody</reg> <lb/>
else was satisfied with that <reg orig="arrange-|ment">arrangement</reg>, <lb/>
but I had to stick to my point.</p>
<p>It grew darker and darker and blacker <lb/>
and blacker, while I struggled with those <lb/>
awkward sixth-century clothes. It got to <lb/>
be pitch dark, at last, and the multitude <lb/>
groaned with horror to feel the cold <reg orig="uncan-|ny">uncanny</reg> <lb/>
night breezes fan through the place and see the stars come out <lb/>
and twinkle in the sky. At last the eclipse was total, and I was <lb/>
very glad of it, but everybody else was in misery; which was quite <lb/>
natural. I said:</p>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f27" entity="DSSR_000002494_0089">
  <head>"SMOTHERED WITH BLESSINGS."</head>
 </figure>
<p>"The king, by his silence, still stands to the terms." Then I <lb/>
lifted up my hands&mdash;stood just so a moment&mdash;then I said, with the <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="DSSR_000002494_0090"/>
most awful solemnity: "Let the enchantment dissolve and pass <lb/>
harmless away!"</p>
<p>There was no response, for a moment, in that deep darkness and <lb/>
that graveyard hush. But when the silver rim of the sun pushed <lb/>
itself out, a moment or two later, the assemblage broke loose with a <lb/>
vast shout and came pouring down like a deluge to smother me with <lb/>
blessings and gratitude; and Clarence was not the last of the wash, <lb/>
be sure.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.<lb/> MERLIN'S TOWER.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Inasmuch</hi> as I was now the second <reg orig="person-|age">personage</reg> <lb/>
in the Kingdom, as far as political power <lb/>
and authority were concerned, much was <lb/>
made of me. My raiment was of silks and <lb/>
velvets and cloth of gold, and by <reg orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg> <lb/>
was very showy, also uncomfortable. <lb/>
But habit would soon reconcile me to my <lb/>
clothes; I was aware of that. I was given <lb/>
the choicest suite of apartments in the <reg orig="cas-|tle">castle</reg>, <lb/>
after the king's. They were aglow with <lb/>
loud-colored silken hangings, but the stone <lb/>
floors had nothing but rushes on them for a <lb/>
carpet, and they were misfit rushes at that, <lb/>
being not all of one breed. As for <reg orig="conven-|iences">conveniences</reg>, <lb/>
properly speaking, there weren't any. <lb/>
I mean <hi rend="italic">little</hi> conveniences; it is the little <lb/>
conveniences that make the real comfort of <lb/>
life. The big oaken chairs, graced with rude <lb/>
carvings, were well enough, but that was the <lb/>
stopping-place. There was no soap, no <lb/>
matches, no looking-glass&mdash;except a metal <lb/>
one, about as powerful as a pail of water. And not a chromo. I <lb/>
had been used to chromos for years, and I saw now that without my <lb/>
suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the fabric of my <lb/>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f29" entity="DSSR_000002494_0094"/>-->
<pb n="84" entity="DSSR_000002494_0095"/>
being, and was become a part of me. It made me homesick to look <lb/>
around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness and <reg orig="remem-|ber">remember</reg> <lb/>
that in our house in East Hartford, all unpretending as it was, you <lb/>
couldn't go into a room but you would find an insurance-chromo, or at <lb/>
least a three-color God-Bless-Our-Home over the door; and in the <lb/>
parlor we had nine. But here, even in my grand room of state, there <lb/>

  <head>"THERE WAS NO SOAP, NO MATCHES, <lb/>
   NO LOOKING-GLASS."</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="85" entity="DSSR_000002494_0096"/>
wasn't anything in the nature of a picture except a thing the size of a <lb/>
bed-quilt, which was either woven or knitted, (it had darned places in <lb/>
it,) and nothing in it was the right color or the right shape; and as <lb/>
for proportions, even Raphael himself couldn't have botched them <lb/>
more formidably, after all his practice on those nightmares they call <lb/>
his "celebrated Hampton Court cartoons." Raphael was a bird. We <lb/>
had several of his chromos; one was his "Miraculous Draught of <lb/>
Fishes," where he puts in a miracle of his own&mdash;puts three men into <lb/>
a canoe which wouldn't have held a dog without upsetting. I always <lb/>
admired to study R.'s art, it was so fresh and unconventional.</p>
<p>There wasn't even a bell or a speaking-tube in the castle. I had a <lb/>
great many servants, and those that were on duty lolled in the <reg orig="ante-|room">anteroom</reg>; <lb/>
and when I wanted one of them I had to go and call for him. <lb/>
There was no gas, there were no candles; a bronze dish half full of <lb/>
boarding-house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was the thing <lb/>
that produced what was regarded as light. A lot of these hung along <lb/>
the walls and modified the dark, just toned it down enough to make <lb/>
it dismal. If you went out at night, your servants carried torches. <lb/>
There were no books, pens, paper, or ink, and no glass in the openings <lb/>
they believed to be windows. It is a little thing&mdash;glass is&mdash;until it is <lb/>
absent, then it becomes a big thing. But perhaps the worst of all was, <lb/>
that there wasn't any sugar, coffee, tea or tobacco. I saw that I was <lb/>
just another Robinson Crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island, with <lb/>
no society but some more or less tame animals, and if I wanted to <lb/>
make life bearable I must do as he did&mdash;invent, contrive, create, <reg orig="reor-|ganize">reorganize</reg> <lb/>
things; set brain and hand to work, and keep them busy. <lb/>
Well, that was in my line.</p>
<p>One thing troubled me along at first&mdash;the immense interest which <lb/>
people took in me. Apparently the whole nation wanted a look at <lb/>
me. It soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the British world <lb/>
almost to death: that while it lasted the whole country, from one end <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="DSSR_000002494_0097"/>
to the other, was in a pitiable state of panic, and the churches, <reg orig="her-|mitages">hermitages</reg>, <lb/>
and monkeries overflowed with praying and weeping poor <lb/>
creatures who thought the end of the world was come. Then had <lb/>
followed the news that the producer of this awful event was a stranger, <lb/>
a mighty magician at Arthur's court; that he could have blown out <lb/>
the sun like a candle, and was just going to do it when his mercy was <lb/>
purchased, and he then dissolved his enchantments, and was now <lb/>
recognized and honored as the man who had by his unaided might <lb/>
saved the globe from destruction and its peo- <lb/>ples from extinction. Now if you consider <lb/>
that everybody believed that, and <lb/>
not only believed it but never even <lb/>
dreamed of doubting it, you <lb/>
will easily understand that <lb/>
there was not a person in all <lb/>
Britain that would not have <lb/>
walked fifty miles to <lb/>
get a sight of me. Of <lb/>
course I was all the <lb/>
talk&mdash;all other <reg orig="sub-|jects">subjects</reg> <lb/>
were dropped; <lb/>
even the king <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
suddenly a <reg orig="per-|son">person</reg> <lb/>
of minor interest and notoriety. Within twenty-four hours the <lb/>
delegations began to arrive, and from that time onward for a fortnight <lb/>
they kept coming. The village was crowded, and all the countryside. <lb/>
I had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these reverent <lb/>
and awe-stricken multitudes. It came to be a great burden, as to <lb/>
time and trouble, but of course it was at the same time <reg orig="compensat-|ingly">compensatingly</reg> <lb/>
agreeable to be so celebrated and such a centre of homage. It <lb/>
turned Brer Merlin green with envy and spite, which was a great <reg orig="satis-|faction">satisfaction</reg> <lb/>

  <head>"THE REVERENT AND AWE-STRICKEN MULTITUDES."</head>

to me. But there was one thing I couldn't understand; nobody <lb/>
had asked for an autograph. I spoke to Clarence about it. By George, <lb/>
I had to explain to him what it was. Then he said nobody in the <lb/>
country could read or write but a few dozen priests. Land! think <lb/>
of that.</p>
<p>There was another thing that troubled me a little. Those <reg orig="multi-|tudes">multitudes</reg> <lb/>
presently began to agitate for another miracle. That was <reg orig="nat-|ural">natural</reg>. <lb/>
To be able to carry back to their far homes the boast that they <lb/>
had seen the man who could command the sun, riding in the <lb/>
heavens, and be obeyed, would make them great in the eyes of their <lb/>
neighbors, and envied by them all; but to be able to also say <lb/>
they had seen him work a miracle themselves&mdash;why, people would <lb/>
come a distance to see <hi rend="italic">them.</hi> The pressure got to be pretty strong. <lb/>
There was going to be an eclipse of the moon, and I knew the date <lb/>
and hour, but it was too far away. Two years. I would have given <lb/>
a good deal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was <lb/>
a big market for it. It seemed a great pity to have it wasted, so, and <lb/>
come lagging along at a time when a body wouldn't have any use for <lb/>
it as like as not. If it had been booked for only a month away, I <lb/>
could have sold it short; but as matters stood, I couldn't seem to <lb/>
cipher out any way to make it do me any good, so I gave up trying. <lb/>
Next, Clarence found that old Merlin was making himself busy on the <lb/>
sly among those people. He was spreading a report that I was a <lb/>
humbug, and that the reason I didn't accommodate the people with a <lb/>
miracle was because I couldn't. I saw that I must do something. I <lb/>
presently thought out a plan.</p>
<p>By my authority as executive I threw Merlin into prison&mdash;the same <lb/>
cell I had occupied myself. Then I gave public notice by herald and <lb/>
trumpet that I should be busy with affairs of state for a fortnight, but <lb/>
about the end of that time I would take a moment's leisure and blow <lb/>
up Merlin's stone tower by fires from heaven; in the meantime, whoso <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="DSSR_000002494_0099"/>
listened to evil reports about me, let him beware. Furthermore, I <lb/>
would perform but this one miracle at this time, and no more; if it <lb/>
failed to satisfy and any murmured, I would turn the murmurers into <lb/>
horses, and make them useful. Quiet ensued.</p>
<p>I took Clarence into my confidence, to a certain degree, and we <lb/>
went to work privately. I told him that this was a sort of miracle that <lb/>
required a trifle of preparation; and that it would be sudden death to <lb/>
ever talk about these preparations to anybody. That made his mouth <lb/>
safe enough. Clandestinely we made a few bushels of first-rate <reg orig="blast-|ing-powder">blasting-powder</reg>, <lb/>
and I superintended my armorers while they constructed <lb/>
a lightning rod and some wires. This old stone tower was very <reg orig="mas-|sive&mdash;and">massive&mdash;and</reg> <lb/>
rather ruinous, too, for it was Roman, and four hundred years <lb/>
old. Yes, and handsome, after a rude fashion, and clothed with ivy <lb/>
from base to summit, as with a shirt of scale mail. It stood on a lonely <lb/>
eminence, in good view from the castle, and about half a mile away.</p>
<p>Working by night, we stowed the powder in the tower&mdash;dug stones <lb/>
out, on the inside, and buried the powder in the walls themselves, <lb/>
which were fifteen feet thick at the base. We put in a peck at a time, <lb/>
in a dozen places. We could have blown up the Tower of London with <lb/>
these charges. When the thirteenth night was come we put up our <lb/>
lightning rod, bedded it in one of the batches of powder, and ran wires <lb/>
from it to the other batches. Everybody had shunned that locality <lb/>
from the day of my proclamation, but on the morning of the fourteenth <lb/>
I thought best to warn the people, through the heralds, to keep clear <lb/>
away&mdash;a quarter of a mile away. Then added, by command, that at <lb/>
some time during the twenty-four hours I would consummate the <lb/>
miracle, but would first give a brief notice; by flags on the castle <lb/>
towers, if in the day-time, by torch-baskets in the same places if at <lb/>
night.</p>
<p>Thunder-showers had been tolerably frequent, of late, and I was <lb/>
not much afraid of a failure; still, I shouldn't have cared for a delay <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="DSSR_000002494_0100"/>
of a day or two; I should have explained that I was busy with affairs <lb/>
of state, yet, and the people must wait.</p>
<p>Of course we had a blazing sunny day&mdash;almost the first one without <lb/>
a cloud for three weeks; things always happen so. I kept secluded, <lb/>
and watched the weather. Clarence dropped in from time to time and <lb/>
said the public excitement was growing and growing all the time, and <lb/>
the whole country filling up with human masses as far as one could <lb/>
see from the battlements. At last the wind sprang up and a cloud <lb/>
appeared&mdash;in the right quarter, too, and just at nightfall. For a little <lb/>
while I watched that distant cloud spread and blacken, then I judged <lb/>
it was time for me to appear. I ordered the torch-baskets to be lit, <lb/>
and Merlin liberated and sent to me. A quarter of an hour later I <lb/>
ascended the parapet and there found the king and the court <reg orig="assem-|bled">assembled</reg> <lb/>
and gazing off in the darkness toward Merlin's tower. Already <lb/>
the darkness was so heavy that one could not see far; these people, <lb/>
and the old turrets, being partly in deep shadow and partly in the red <lb/>
glow from the great torch-baskets overhead, made a good deal of a <lb/>
picture.</p>
<p>Merlin arrived in a gloomy mood. I said:</p>
<p>"You wanted to burn me alive when I had not done you any harm, <lb/>
and latterly you have been trying to injure my professional reputation. <lb/>
Therefore I am going to call down fire and blow up your tower, but <lb/>
it is only fair to give you a chance; now if you think you can break <lb/>
my enchantments and ward off the fires, step to the bat, it's your <lb/>
innings."</p>
<p>"I can, fair sir, and I will. Doubt it not."</p>
<p>He drew an imaginary circle on the stones of the roof, and burnt a <lb/>
pinch of powder in it which sent up a small cloud of aromatic smoke, <lb/>
whereat everybody fell back, and began to cross themselves and get <lb/>
uncomfortable. Then he began to mutter and make passes in the air <lb/>
with his hands. He worked himself up slowly and gradually into a <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="DSSR_000002494_0101"/>
sort of frenzy, and got to thrashing <lb/>
around with his arms like the sails <lb/>
of a windmill. By this time the <lb/>
storm had about reached us; the <lb/>
gusts of wind were flaring the <lb/>
torches and making the shadows <lb/>
swash about, the first heavy drops <lb/>
of rain were falling, the world abroad <lb/>
was black as pitch, the <lb/>
lightning began to <lb/>
wink fitfully. Of course <lb/>
my rod would be <lb/>
loading itself now. <lb/>
In fact, things were <lb/>
imminent. So I <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"You have had time enough. I  <lb/>
have given you every advantage, <lb/>
and not interfered. It is plain your <lb/>
magic is weak. It is only fair that I <lb/>
begin now".</p>

  <head>"THAT OLD TOWER LEAPED INTO THE <lb/>
   SKY IN CHUNKS."</head>
 </figure>
<p>I made about three passes in the <lb/>
air, and then there was an awful crash and that old tower leaped <lb/>
into the sky in chunks, along with a vast volcanic fountain of fire that <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="DSSR_000002494_0102"/>
turned night to noonday, and showed a thousand acres of human <lb/>
beings groveling on the ground in a general collapse of consternation. <lb/>
Well, it rained mortar and masonry the rest of the week. This was the <lb/>
report; but probably the facts would have modified it.</p>
<p>It was an effective miracle. The great bothersome temporary <lb/>
population vanished. There were a good many thousand tracks in the <lb/>
mud the next morning, but they were all outward bound. If I had <lb/>
advertised another miracle I couldn't have raised an audience with a <lb/>
sheriff.</p>
<p>Merlin's stock was flat. The king wanted to stop his wages; he <lb/>
even wanted to banish him, but I interfered. I said he would be <reg orig="use-|ful">useful</reg> <lb/>
to work the weather, and attend to small matters like that, and I <lb/>
would give him a lift now and then when his poor little parlor-magic <lb/>
soured on him. There wasn't a rag of his tower left, but I had the <lb/>
government rebuild it for him, and advised him to take boarders; but <lb/>
he was too high-toned for that. And as for being grateful, he never <lb/>
even said thank-you. He was a rather hard lot, take him how you <lb/>
might; but then you couldn't fairly expect a man to be sweet that had <lb/>
been set back so.</p>

I wouldn't have traded it for the twentieth. Look at the <reg orig="opportuni-|ties">opportunities</reg> <lb/>

 <pb n="96" entity="DSSR_000002494_0107"/>
here for a man of knowledge, brains, pluck and enterprise to sail <lb/>
in and grow up with the country. The grandest field that ever was; <lb/>
and all my own; not a competitor; not a man who wasn't a baby to <lb/>
me in acquirements and capacities; whereas, what would I amount to <lb/>
in the twentieth century? I should be foreman of a factory, that is <lb/>
about all; and could drag a seine down-street any day and catch a <lb/>
hundred better men than myself.</p>
<p>What a jump I had made! I couldn't keep from thinking about <lb/>
it, and contemplating it, just as one does who has struck oil. There <lb/>
was nothing back of me that could approach it, unless it might be <lb/>
Joseph's case; and Joseph's only approached it, it didn't equal it, <lb/>
quite. For it stands to reason that as Joseph's splendid financial <reg orig="in-|genuities">ingenuities</reg> <lb/>
advantaged nobody but the king, the general public must <lb/>
have regarded him with a good deal of disfavor, whereas I had done <lb/>
my entire public a kindness in sparing the sun, and was popular by <lb/>
reason of it.</p>
<p>I was no shadow of a king; I was the substance; the king himself <lb/>
was the shadow. My power was colossal; and it was not a mere <lb/>
name, as such things have generally been, it was the genuine article. <lb/>
I stood here, at the very spring and source of the second great period <lb/>
of the world's history; and could see the trickling stream of that <reg orig="his-|tory">history</reg> <lb/>
gather, and deepen and broaden, and roll its mighty tides down <lb/>
the far centuries; and I could note the upspringing of adventurers <lb/>
like myself in the shelter of its long array of thrones: De Montforts, <lb/>
Gavestons, Mortimers, Villierses; the war-making, campaign-<reg orig="direct-|ing">directing</reg> <lb/>
wantons of France, and Charles the Second's sceptre-wielding <lb/>
drabs; but nowhere in the procession was my full-sized fellow visible. <lb/>
I was a Unique; and glad to know that that fact could not be <reg orig="dis-|lodged">dislodged</reg> <lb/>
or challenged for thirteen centuries and a half, for sure.</p>
<p>Yes, in power I was equal to the king. At the same time there <lb/>
was another power that was a trifle stronger than both of us put <lb/>

together. That was the Church. I do not wish to disguise that fact. <lb/>
I couldn't, if I wanted to. But never mind about that, now; it will <lb/>
show up, in its proper place, later on. It didn't cause me any trouble <lb/>
in the beginning&mdash;at lcast any of consequence.</p>
<p>Well, it was a curious country, and full of interest. And the <lb/>
people! They were the <lb/>
quaintest and simplest and <lb/>
trustingest race; why, they <lb/>
were nothing but rabbits. <lb/>
It was pitiful for a person <lb/>
born in a wholesome free <lb/>
atmosphere to listen to <lb/>
their humble and hearty <lb/>
outpourings of loyalty <lb/>
toward their king and <lb/>
Church and <lb/>
nobility; as <lb/>
if they had <lb/>
any more <lb/>
occasion to <lb/>
love and <lb/>
honor king and Church and noble <lb/>
than a slave has to love and honor <lb/>
the lash, or a dog has to love and honor the stranger that kicks him! <lb/>
Why, dear me, <hi rend="italic">any</hi> kind of royalty, howsoever modified, <hi rend="italic">any</hi> kind of <lb/>
aristocracy, howsoever pruned, is rightly an insult; but if you are born <lb/>
and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably never <lb/>
find it out for yourself, and don't believe it when somebody else tells <lb/>
you. It is enough to make a body ashamed of his race to think of <lb/>

the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones without shadow <lb/>
of right or reason, and the seventh-rate people that have always <reg orig="fig-|ured">figured</reg> <lb/>
as its aristocracies&mdash;a company of monarchs and nobles who, as <lb/>
a rule, would have achieved only poverty and obscurity if left, like <lb/>
their betters, to their own exertions.</p>
<p>The most of King Arthur's British nation were slaves, pure and <lb/>
simple, and bore that name, and wore the iron collar on their necks; <lb/>
and the rest were slaves in fact, but without the name; they imagined <lb/>
themselves men and freemen, and called themselves so. The truth <lb/>
was, the nation as a body was in the world for one object, and one <lb/>
only: to grovel before king and Church and noble; to slave for them, <lb/>
sweat blood for them, starve that they might be fed, work that they <lb/>
might play, drink misery to the dregs that they might be happy, go <lb/>
naked that they might wear silks and jewels, pay taxes that they might <lb/>
be spared from paying them, be familiar all their lives with the <reg orig="degrad-|ing">degrading</reg> <lb/>
language and postures of adulation that they might walk in pride <lb/>
and think themselves the gods of this world. And for all this, the <lb/>
thanks they got were cuffs and contempt; and so poor-spirited were <lb/>
they that they took even this sort of attention as an honor.</p>
<p>Inherited ideas are a curious thing, and interesting to observe and <lb/>
examine. I had mine, the king and his people had theirs. In both <lb/>
cases they flowed in ruts worn deep by time and habit, and the man <lb/>
who should have proposed to divert them by reason and argument <lb/>
would have had a long contract on his hands. For instance, those <lb/>
people had inherited the idea that all men without title and a long <lb/>
pedigree, whether they had great natural gifts and acquirements or <lb/>
hadn't, were creatures of no more consideration than so many animals, <lb/>
bugs, insects; whereas I had inherited the idea that human daws who <lb/>
can consent to masquerade in the peacock-shams of inherited <reg orig="digni-|ties">dignities</reg> <lb/>
and unearned titles, are of no good but to be laughed at. The <lb/>
way I was looked upon was odd, but it was natural. You know how <lb/>

the keeper and the public regard the elephant in the menagerie: <lb/>
well, that is the idea. They are full of admiration of his vast bulk and <lb/>
his prodigious strength; they speak with pride of the fact that he can <lb/>
do a hundred marvels which are far and away beyond their own <lb/>
powers; and they speak with the same pride of the fact that in his <lb/>
wrath he is able to drive a thousand men before him. But does that <lb/>
make him one of <hi rend="italic">them?</hi> No; the raggedest tramp in the pit would <lb/>
smile at the idea. He couldn't comprehend it; couldn't take it in; <lb/>
couldn't in any remote way conceive of it. Well, to the king, the <lb/>
nobles, and all the nation, down to the very slaves and tramps, I was <lb/>
just that kind of an elephant, and nothing more. I was admired, also <lb/>
feared; but it was as an animal is admired and feared. The animal is <lb/>
not reverenced, neither was I; I was not even respected. I had no <lb/>
pedigree, no inherited title; so in the king's and nobles' eyes I <lb/>
was mere dirt; the people regarded me with wonder and awe, but <lb/>
there was no reverence mixed with it; through the force of inherited <lb/>
ideas they were not able to conceive of anything being entitled to that <lb/>
except pedigree and lordship. There you see the hand of that awful <lb/>
power, the Roman Catholic Church. In two or three little centuries <lb/>
it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms. Before the <lb/>
day of the Church's supremacy in the world, men were men, and held <lb/>
their heads up, and had a man's pride and spirit and independence; <lb/>
and what of greatness and position a person got, he got mainly by <lb/>
achievement, not by birth. But then the Church came to the front, <lb/>
with an axe to grind; and she was wise, subtle, and knew more than <lb/>
one way to skin a cat&mdash;or a nation; she invented "divine right of <lb/>
kings," and propped it all around, brick by brick, with the Beatitudes <lb/>
&mdash;wrenching them from their good purpose to make them fortify an <lb/>
evil one; she preached (to the commoner,) humility, obedience to <lb/>
superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice; she preached (to the commoner,) <lb/>
meekness under insult; preached (still to the commoner, always to <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="DSSR_000002494_0112"/>
the commoner,) patience, meanness of spirit, non-resistance under <lb/>
oppression; and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies, and <lb/>
taught all the Christian populations of the earth to bow down to them <lb/>
and worship them. Even down to my birth-century that poison was <lb/>
still in the blood <lb/>
of Christendom, <lb/>
and the best of <lb/>
English <reg orig="common-|ers">commoners</reg> <lb/>
was still <reg orig="con-|tent">content</reg> <lb/>
to see his <reg orig="in-|feriors">inferiors</reg> <lb/>
impudently <lb/>
continuing to hold <lb/>
a number of <reg orig="posi-|tions">positions</reg>, <lb/>
such as <reg orig="lord-|ships">lordships</reg> <lb/>
and the <lb/>
throne, to which <lb/>
the grotesque laws <lb/>
of his country did <lb/>
not allow him to <lb/>
aspire; in fact he was not <lb/>
merely contented with this <lb/>
strange condition of things, he was <lb/>
even able to persuade himself that he <lb/>
was proud of it. It seems to show that <lb/>
there isn't anything you can't stand, if you are <lb/>
only born and bred to it. Of course that taint, that reverence for <lb/>
rank and title, had been in our American blood, too&mdash;I know that; <lb/>
but when I left America it had disappeared at least to all intents and <lb/>
purposes. The remnant of it was restricted to the dudes and dudesses. <lb/>
When a disease has worked its way down to that level, it may fairly <lb/>
be said to be out of the system.</p>

<p>But to return to my anomalous position in King Arthur's kingdom. <lb/>
Here I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master <lb/>
intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement <lb/>
the one and only actually great man in that whole British world; and <lb/>
yet there and then, just as in the remote England of my birth-time, <lb/>
the sheep-witted earl who could claim long descent from a king's <lb/>
leman, acquired at second-hand from the slums of London, was a <lb/>
better man than I was. Such a personage was fawned upon in Arthur's <lb/>
realm and reverently <lb/>
looked up to by <reg orig="every-|body">everybody</reg>, <lb/>
even though his <lb/>
dispositions were as <lb/>
mean as his <reg orig="intelli-|gence">intelligence</reg>, <lb/>
and his morals <lb/>
as base as his lineage. <lb/>
There were times when <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">he</hi> could sit down in the <lb/>
king's presence, but I couldn't. <lb/>
I could have got a title easily <lb/>
enough, and that would have raised me a large step <lb/>
in everybody's eyes; even in the king's, the giver of <lb/>
it. But I didn't ask for it; and I declined it when it was <lb/>
offered. I couldn't have enjoyed such a thing with my <reg orig="no-|tions">notions</reg>; <lb/>
and it wouldn't have been fair, anyway, because as far back <lb/>
as I could go, our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister. I <lb/>
couldn't have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proud and set-up <lb/>
over any title except one that should come from the nation itself, the <lb/>
only legitimate source; and such an one I hoped to win; and in the <lb/>
course of years of honest and honorable endeavor, I did win it and did <lb/>
wear it with a high and clean pride. This title fell casually from the <lb/>
lips of a blacksmith, one day, in a village, was caught up as a happy <lb/>

thought and tossed from mouth to mouth with a laugh and an <reg orig="affirm-|ative">affirmative</reg> <lb/>
vote; in ten days it had swept the kingdom, and was become as <lb/>
familiar as the king's name. I was never known by any other <reg orig="desig-|nation">designation</reg> <lb/>
afterwards, whether in the nation's talk or in grave debate upon <lb/>
matters of state at the council-board of the sovereign. This title, <lb/>
translated into modern speech, would be THE BOSS. Elected by the <lb/>
nation. That suited me. And it was a pretty high title. There were <lb/>
very few THE'S, and I was one of them. If you spoke of the duke, or <lb/>
the earl, or the bishop, how could anybody tell which one you meant? <lb/>
But if you spoke of The King or The Queen or The Boss, it was <lb/>
different.</p>
<p>Well, I liked the king, and <hi rend="italic">as</hi> king I respected him&mdash;respected <lb/>
the office; at least respected it as much as I was capable of <reg orig="respect-|ing">respecting</reg> <lb/>
any unearned supremacy; but as <hi rend="italic">men</hi> I looked down upon him and <lb/>
his nobles&mdash;privately. And he and they liked me, and respected my <lb/>
office; but as an animal, without birth or sham title, they looked <lb/>
down upon me&mdash;and were not particularly private about it, either. I <lb/>
didn't charge for my opinion about them, and they didn't charge for <lb/>
their opinion about me: the account was square, the books balanced, <lb/>
everybody was satisfied.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.<lb/> THE TOURNAMENT.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">They</hi> were always having grand <reg orig="tour-|naments">tournaments</reg> <lb/>
there at Camelot; and very <lb/>
stirring and picturesque and <reg orig="ridicu-|lous">ridiculous</reg> <lb/>
human bull-fights they were, <lb/>
too, but just a little wearisome <lb/>
to the practical mind. However, <lb/>
I was generally on hand&mdash;for two reasons: a <lb/>
man must not hold himself aloof from the things <lb/>
which his friends and his community have at <lb/>
heart if he would be liked&mdash;especially as <lb/>
a statesman; and both as business man <lb/>
and statesman I wanted to study the <lb/>
tournament and see if I couldn't invent <lb/>
an improvement on it. That reminds <lb/>
me to remark, in passing, that the very <lb/>
first official thing I did, in my <reg orig="adminis-|tration&mdash;and">administration&mdash;and</reg> <lb/>
it was on the very first day <lb/>
of it, too&mdash;was to start a patent office; <lb/>
for I knew that a country without a <lb/>
patent office and good patent laws <lb/>
was just a crab, and couldn't travel <lb/>
any way but sideways or <reg orig="back-|wards">backwards</reg>.</p>
<p>Things ran along, a <reg orig="tourna-|ment">tournament</reg> <lb/>
nearly every week; and now and then the boys used to want <lb/>
me to take a hand&mdash;I mean Sir Launcelot and the rest&mdash;but I said I <lb/>

would by and by; no hurry yet, and too much government machinery <lb/>
to oil up and set to rights and start a-going.</p>
<p>We had one tournament which was continued from day to day <lb/>
during more than a week, and as many as five hundred knights took <lb/>
part in it, from first to last. They were weeks gathering. They came <lb/>
on horseback from everywhere; from the very ends of the country, <lb/>
and even from beyond the sea; and many brought ladies and all <lb/>
brought squires, and troops of <lb/>
servants. It was a most gaudy <lb/>
and gorgeous crowd, as to <lb/>
costumery, and very <reg orig="charac-|teristic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
of the <reg orig="coun-|try">country</reg> <lb/>
and the time, in <lb/>
the way of high <reg orig="ani-|mal">animal</reg> <lb/>
spirits, innocent <lb/>
indecencies of <reg orig="lan-|guage">language</reg>, <lb/>
and <reg orig="happy-|hearted">happy-hearted</reg> <lb/>
indifference <lb/>
to morals. It <lb/>
was fight or <lb/>
look on, all day <lb/>
and every day; <lb/>
and sing, gamble, dance, carouse, half the night every night. They <lb/>
had a most noble good time. You never saw such people. Those <lb/>
banks of beautiful ladies, shining in their barbaric splendors, would <lb/>
see a knight sprawl from his horse in the lists with a lance-shaft the <lb/>
thickness of your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting, <lb/>
and instead of fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each <lb/>
other for a better view; only sometimes one would dive into her <lb/>
handkerchief, and look ostentatiously broken-hearted, and then you <lb/>
could lay two to one that there was a scandal there somewhere and <lb/>
she was afraid the public hadn't found it out.</p>

<p>The noise at night would have been annoying to me ordinarily, <lb/>
but I didn't mind it in the present circumstances, because it kept me <lb/>
from hearing the quacks detaching legs and arms from the day's <lb/>
cripples. They ruined an uncommon good old cross-cut saw for me, <lb/>
and broke the saw-buck, too, but I let it pass. And as for my axe&mdash; <lb/>
well, I made up my mind that the next time I lent an <lb/>
axe to a surgeon I would pick my century.</p>

  <head>"DETAILED AN INTELLIGENT PRIEST, AND <lb/>
   ORDERED HIM TO REPORT IT."</head>
 </figure>
<p>I not only watched this tournament from day to <lb/>
day, but detailed an intelligent priest from my <lb/>
Department of Public Morals and Agriculture, <lb/>
and ordered him to report it; for it was my <lb/>
purpose by and by, when I should have gotten <lb/>
the people along far enough, to start a newspaper. <lb/>
The first thing you want in a new country, is a <lb/>
patent office; then work up your school <lb/>
system; and after that, out with your paper. <lb/>
A newspaper has its faults, and plenty of <lb/>
them, but no matter, it's hark from <lb/>
the tomb for a dead nation, <lb/>
and don't you forget it. You <lb/>
can't resurrect a dead nation <lb/>
without it; there isn't any way. <lb/>
So I wanted to sample things, <lb/>
and be finding out what sort of <reg orig="re-|porter-material">reporter-material</reg> <lb/>
I might be able <lb/>
to rake together out of the sixth century when I should come to <lb/>
need it.</p>
<p>Well, the priest did very well, considering. He got in all the <lb/>
details, and that is a good thing in a local item: you see he had kept <lb/>
books for the undertaker-department of his church when he was <lb/>
younger, and there, you know, the money's in the details; the more <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="DSSR_000002494_0121"/>
details, the more swag: bearers, mutes, candles, prayers,&mdash;everything <lb/>
counts; and if the bereaved don't buy prayers enough you mark up <lb/>
your candles with a forked pencil, and your bill shows up all right. <lb/>
And he had a good knack at getting in the complimentary thing here <lb/>
and there about a knight that was likely to advertise&mdash;no, I mean a <lb/>
knight that had influence; and he also had a neat gift of exaggeration, <lb/>
for in his time he had kept door for a pious hermit who lived in a sty <lb/>
and worked miracles.</p>
<p>Of course this novice's report lacked whoop and crash and lurid <lb/>
description, and therefore wanted the true ring; but its antique <reg orig="word-|ing">wording</reg> <lb/>
was quaint and sweet and simple, and full of the fragrances and <lb/>
flavors of the time, and these little merits made up in a measure for <lb/>
its more important lacks. Here is an extract from it: <lb/>
<q>Then Sir Brian de les Isles and Grummore Grummorsum, knights of the castle, <lb/>
encountered with Sir Aglovale and Sir Tor, and Sir Tor smote down Sir Grummore <lb/>
Grummorsum to the earth. Then came in Sir Carados of the dolorous tower, and Sir <lb/>
Turquine, knights of the castle, and there encountered with them Sir Percivale de Galis <lb/>
and Sir Lamorak de Galis, that were two brethren, and there encountered Sir Percivale <lb/>
with Sir Carados, and either brake their spears unto their hands, and then Sir Turquine <lb/>
with Sir Lamorak, and either of them smote down other, horse and all, to the earth, and <lb/>
either parties rescued other and horsed them again. And Sir Arnold, and Sir Gauter, <lb/>
knights of the castle encountered with Sir Brandiles and Sir Kay, and these four <lb/>
knights encountered mightily, and brake their spears to their hands. Then came Sir <lb/>
Pertolope from the castle, and there encountered with him Sir Lionel, and there Sir <lb/>
Pertolope the green knight smote down Sir Lionel, brother to Sir Launcelot. All this <lb/>
was marked by noble heralds, who bare him best, and their names. Then Sir Bleobaris <lb/>
brake his spear upon Sir Gareth, but of that stroke Sir Bleobaris fell to the earth. <lb/>
When Sir Galihodin saw that, he bad Sir Gareth keep him, and Sir Gareth smote him to <lb/>
the earth. Then Sir Galihud gat a spear to avenge his brother, and in the same wise <lb/>
Sir Gareth served him, and Sir Dinadan and his brother La Cote Male Taile, and Sir <lb/>
Sagramor le Desirous, and Sir Dodinas le Savage; all these he bare down with one spear. <lb/>
When King Agwisance of Ireland saw Sir Gareth fare so he marvelled what he might be, <lb/>
that one time seemed green, and another time, at his again coming, he seemed blue. <lb/>
And thus at every course that he rode to and fro he changed his color, so that there <lb/>
might neither king nor knight have ready cognizance of him. Then Sir Agwisance the <lb/>
King of Ireland encountered with Sir Gareth, and there Sir Gareth smote him from his <lb/>
horse, saddle and all. And then came King Carados of Scotland, and Sir Gareth smote <lb/>
him down horse and man. And in the same wise he served King Uriens of the land of <lb/>
<pb n="111" entity="DSSR_000002494_0122"/>
Gore. And then there came in Sir Bagdemagus, and Sir Gareth smote him down horse <lb/>
and man to the earth. And Bagdemagus's son Meliganus brake a spear upon Sir <lb/>
Gareth mightily and knightly. And then Sir Galahault the noble prince cried on high, <lb/>
Knight with the many colors, well hast thou justed; now make thee ready that I may <lb/>
just with thee. Sir Gareth heard him, and he gat a great spear, and so they encountered <lb/>
together, and there the prince brake his spear; but Sir Gareth smote him upon the left <lb/>
side of the helm, that he reeled here and there, and he had fallen down had not his men <lb/>
recovered him. Truly said King Arthur, that knight with the many colors is a good <lb/>
knight. Wherefore the king called unto him Sir Launcelot, and prayed him to <reg orig="encoun-|ter">encounter</reg> <lb/>
with that knight. Sir, said Launcelot, I may as well find in my heart for to forbear <lb/>
him at this time, for he hath had travail enough this day, and when a good knight doth <lb/>
so well upon some day, it is no good knight's part to let him of his worship, and, <reg orig="name-|ly">namely</reg>, <lb/>
when he seeth a knight hath done so great labour: for peradventure, said Sir Launcelot, <lb/>
his quarrel is here this day, and peradventure he is best beloved with this lady of all <lb/>
that be here, for I see well he paineth himself and enforceth him to do great deeds, and <lb/>
therefore, said Sir Launcelot, as for me, this day he shall have the honour; though it lay <lb/>
in my power to put him from it, I would not.</q></p>
<p>There was an unpleasant little episode that day, which for reasons <lb/>
of state I struck out of my priest's report. You will have noticed that <lb/>
Garry was doing some great fighting in the engagement. When I say <lb/>
Garry I mean Sir Gareth. Garry was my private pet name for him; <lb/>
it suggests that I had a deep affection for him, and that was the case. <lb/>
But it was a private pet name only, and never spoken aloud to any <lb/>
one, much less to him; being a noble, he would not have endured a <lb/>
familiarity like that from me. Well, to proceed: I sat in the private <lb/>
box set apart for me as the king's minister. While Sir Dinadan was <lb/>
waiting for his turn to enter the lists, he came in there and sat down <lb/>
and began to talk; for he was always making up to me, because I was <lb/>
a stranger and he liked to have a fresh market for his jokes, the most <lb/>
of them having reached that stage of wear where the teller has to do <lb/>
the laughing himself while the other person looks sick. I had always <lb/>
responded to his efforts as well as I could, and felt a very deep and <lb/>
real kindness for him, too, for the reason that if by malice of fate he <lb/>
knew the one particular anecdote which I had heard oftenest and had <lb/>
most hated and most loathed all my life, he had at least spared it me. <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="DSSR_000002494_0123"/>
It was one which I had heard attributed to every humorous person <lb/>
who had ever stood on American soil, from Columbus down to <reg orig="Arte-|mus">Artemus</reg> <lb/>
Ward. It was about a humorous lecturer who flooded an ignorant <lb/>
audience with the killingest jokes for an hour and never got a laugh; <lb/>
and then when he was leaving, some gray simpletons wrung him <lb/>
gratefully by the hand and said it had been the funniest thing they <lb/>
had ever heard, and "it was all they could do to keep from laughin' <lb/>
right out in meetin'." That ancedote never saw the day that it was <lb/>
worth the telling; and yet I had sat under the telling of it hundreds <lb/>
and thousands and millions and billions of times, and cried and cursed <lb/>
all the way through. Then who can hope to know what my feelings <lb/>
were, to hear this armor-plated ass start in on it again, in the murky <lb/>
twilight of tradition, before the dawn of history, while even Lactantius <lb/>
might be referred to as "the late Lactantius," and the Crusades <lb/>
wouldn't be born for five hundred years yet? Just as he finished, the <lb/>
call-boy came; so, haw-hawing like a demon, he went rattling and <lb/>
clanking out like a crate of loose castings, and I knew nothing more. <lb/>
It was some minutes before I came to, and then I opened my eyes <lb/>
just in time to see Sir Gareth fetch him an awful welt, and I <reg orig="uncon-|sciously">unconsciously</reg> <lb/>
out with the prayer, "I hope to gracious he's killed!" But <lb/>
by ill-luck, before I had got half through with the words, Sir Gareth <lb/>
crashed into Sir Sagramor le Desirous and sent him thundering over <lb/>
his horse's crupper, and Sir Sagramor caught my remark and thought <lb/>
I meant it for <hi rend="italic">him.</hi></p>
<p>Well, whenever one of those people got a thing into his head, <lb/>
there was no getting it out again. I knew that, so I saved my breath, <lb/>
and offered no explanations. As soon as Sir Sagramor got well, he <lb/>
notified me that there was a little account to settle between us, and <lb/>
he named a day three or four years in the future; place of settlement, <lb/>
the lists where the offense had been given. I said I would be ready <lb/>
when he got back. You see, he was going for the Holy Grail. The <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="DSSR_000002494_0124"/>
boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail now and then. It was a several <lb/>
years' cruise. They always put in the long absence snooping around, <lb/>
in the most conscientious way, though none of them had any idea <lb/>
where the Holy Grail really was, and I don't think any of them <lb/>
actually expected to find it, or would have known what to do with it <lb/>
if he <hi rend="italic">had</hi> run across it. You see, it was just the Northwest Passage of <lb/>
that day, as you may say; that was all. Every year expeditions <lb/>
went out holy grailing, and next year relief expeditions went out to <lb/>
hunt for <hi rend="italic">them.</hi> There was worlds of reputation in it, but no money. <lb/>
Why, they actually wanted <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to put in! Well, I should smile.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.<lb/> BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> Round Table soon heard of <lb/>
the challenge, and of course it <lb/>
was a good deal discussed, for <lb/>
such things interested the boys. <lb/>
The king thought I ought now <lb/>
to set forth in quest of <reg orig="adven-|tures">adventures</reg>, <lb/>
so that I might gain <reg orig="re-|nown">renown</reg> <lb/>
and be the more worthy to <lb/>
meet Sir Sagramor when the several <lb/>
years should have rolled away. I <lb/>
excused myself for the present; I <lb/>
said it would take me three or four <lb/>
years yet to get things well fixed <lb/>
up and going smoothly; then I <lb/>
should be ready; all the chances <lb/>
were that at the end of that time <lb/>
Sir Sagramor would still be out <lb/>
grailing, so no valuable time would <lb/>
be lost by the postponement; I should then have <lb/>
been in office six or seven years, and I believed my <lb/>
system and machinery would be so well developed that <lb/>
I could take a holiday without its working any harm.</p>
<p>I was pretty well satisfied with what I had already <lb/>
accomplished. In various quiet nooks and corners I had the <reg orig="begin-|nings">beginnings</reg> <lb/>
of all sorts of industries under way&mdash;nuclei of future vast <reg orig="facto-|ries">factories</reg>, <lb/>
the iron and steel missionaries of my future civilization. In these <lb/>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f45" entity="DSSR_000002494_0128"/>-->
<pb n="118" entity="DSSR_000002494_0129"/>
were gathered together the brightest young minds I could find, and I <lb/>
kept agents out raking the country for more, all the time. I was <lb/>
training a crowd of ignorant folk into experts&mdash;experts in every sort <lb/>
of handiwork and scientific calling. These nurseries of mine went <lb/>
smoothly and privately along undisturbed in their obscure country <lb/>
retreats, for nobody was allowed to come into their precincts without <lb/>
a special permit&mdash;for I was afraid of the Church.</p>
<p>I had started a teacher-factory and a lot of Sunday-schools the <lb/>
first thing; as a result, I now had an admirable system of graded <lb/>
schools in full blast in those places, and also a complete variety of <lb/>
Protestant congregations all in a prosperous and growing condition. <lb/>
Everybody could be any kind of a Christian he wanted to; there was <lb/>
perfect freedom in that matter. But I confined public religious <reg orig="teach-|ing">teaching</reg> <lb/>
to the churches and the Sunday-schools, permitting nothing of it <lb/>
in my other educational buildings. I could have given my own sect <lb/>
the preference and made everybody a Presbyterian without any trouble, <lb/>
but that would have been to affront a law of human nature: spiritual <lb/>
wants and instincts are as various in the human family as are physical <lb/>
appetites, complexions, and features, and a man is only at his best, <lb/>
morally, when he is equipped with the religious garment whose color <lb/>
and shape and size most nicely accommodate themselves to the <reg orig="spirit-|ual">spiritual</reg> <lb/>
complexion, angularities, and stature of the individual who wears <lb/>
it; and besides I was afraid of a united Church; it makes a mighty <lb/>
power, the mightiest conceivable, and then when it by and by gets <lb/>
into selfish hands, as it is always bound to do, it means death to <lb/>
human liberty, and paralysis to human thought.</p>
<p>All mines were royal property, and there were a good many of <lb/>
them. They had formerly been worked as savages always work <lb/>
mines&mdash;holes grubbed in the earth and the mineral brought up in sacks <lb/>
of hide by hand, at the rate of a ton a day; but I had begun to put <lb/>
the mining on a scientific basis as early as I could.</p>
<pb n="119" entity="DSSR_000002494_0130"/>
<p>Yes, I had made pretty handsome progress when Sir Sagramor's <lb/>
challenge struck me.</p>
<p>Four years rolled by&mdash;and then! Well, you would never imagine <lb/>
it in the world. Unlimited power <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the ideal thing when it is in safe <lb/>
hands. The depotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect <reg orig="gov-|ernment">government</reg>. <lb/>
An earthly <reg orig="des-|potism">despotism</reg> <lb/>
would be the <reg orig="abso-|lutely">absolutely</reg> <lb/>
perfect earthly <reg orig="gov-|ernment">government</reg>, <lb/>
if the conditions <lb/>
were the same, namely, the despot the perfectest individual of the <lb/>
human race, and his lease of life perpetual. But as a perishable <reg orig="per-|fect">perfect</reg> <lb/>
man must die, and leave his despotism in the hands of an imperfect <lb/>
successor, an earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of <reg orig="govern-|ment">government</reg>, <lb/>
it is the worst form that is possible.</p>

 </figure>
<p>My works showed what a despot could do with the resources of a <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="DSSR_000002494_0131"/>
kingdom at his command. Unsuspected by this dark land, I had the <lb/>
civilization of the nineteenth century booming under its very nose! It <lb/>
was fenced away from the public view, but there it was, a gigantic <lb/>
and unassailable fact&mdash;and to be heard from, yet, if I lived and had <lb/>
luck. There it was, as sure a fact, and as substantial a fact as any <lb/>
serene volcano, standing innocent with its smokeless summit in the <lb/>
blue sky and giving no sign of the rising hell in its bowels. My <lb/>
schools and churches were children four years before; they were <lb/>
grown-up, now; my shops of that day were vast factories, now; <lb/>
where I had a dozen trained men then, I had a thousand, now; <lb/>
where I had one brilliant expert then, I had fifty now. I stood with <lb/>
my hand on the cock, so to speak, ready to turn it on and flood the <lb/>
midnight world with light at any moment. But I was not going to <lb/>
do the thing in that sudden way. It was not my policy. The <reg orig="peo-|ple">people</reg> <lb/>
could not have stood it; and moreover I should have had the <lb/>
Established Roman Catholic Church on my back in a minute.</p>
<p>No, I had been going cautiously all the while. I had had <reg orig="confiden-|tial">confidential</reg> <lb/>
agents trickling through the country some time, whose office was <lb/>
to undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees, and to gnaw a <reg orig="lit-|tle">little</reg> <lb/>
at this and that and the other superstition, and so prepare the <lb/>
way gradually for a better order of things. I was turning on my light <lb/>
one-candle-power at a time, and meant to continue to do so.</p>
<p>I had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom, <lb/>
and they were doing very well. I meant to work this racket more and <lb/>
more, as time wore on, if nothing occurred to frighten me. One of <lb/>
my deepest secrets was my West Point&mdash;my military academy. I kept <lb/>
that most jealously out of sight; and I did the same with my naval <lb/>
academy which I had established at a remote seaport. Both were <lb/>
prospering to my satisfaction.</p>
<p>Clarence was twenty-two now, and was my head executive, my <lb/>
right hand. He was a darling; he was equal to anything; there <lb/>
<pb n="121" entity="DSSR_000002494_0132"/>
wasn't anything he couldn't turn his hand to. Of late I had been <lb/>
training him for journalism, for the time seemed about right for a <lb/>
start in the newspaper line; nothing big, but just a small weekly for <lb/>
experimental circulation in my civilization-nurseries. He took to it <lb/>
like a duck; there was an editor concealed in him, sure. Already he <lb/>
had doubled himself in one way; he talked <lb/>
sixth century and wrote nineteenth. His <lb/>
journalistic style was climbing, steadily; it <lb/>
was already up to the back settlement <reg orig="Ala-|bama">Alabama</reg> <lb/>
mark, and couldn't be told <lb/>
from the editorial output of that region <lb/>
either by matter or flavor.</p>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f47" entity="DSSR_000002494_0132">
  <head>A WEST POINTER.</head>
 </figure>
<p>We had another large departure on <lb/>
hand, too. This was a telegraph and a <reg orig="tele-|phone">telephone</reg>; <lb/>
our first venture in this line. These <lb/>
wires were for private service only, as yet, <lb/>
and must be kept private until a riper day <lb/>
should come. We had a gang of men on the <lb/>
road, working mainly by night. They <lb/>
were stringing ground wires; we <lb/>
were afraid to put up poles, for they <lb/>
would attract too much inquiry. <lb/>
Ground wires were good <lb/>
enough, in both instances, <lb/>
for my wires were protected <lb/>
by an insulation of my own <lb/>
invention which was perfect. My men had orders to strike across <lb/>
country, avoiding roads, and establishing connection with any <reg orig="con-|siderable">considerable</reg> <lb/>
towns whose lights betrayed their presence, and leaving <lb/>
experts in charge. Nobody could tell you how to find any place in <lb/>
the kingdom, for nobody ever went intentionally to any place, but <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="DSSR_000002494_0133"/>
only struck it by accident in his wanderings, and then generally left <lb/>
it without thinking to inquire what its name was. At one time and <lb/>
another we had sent out topographical expeditions to survey and map <lb/>
the kingdom, but the priests had always interfered and raised trouble. <lb/>
So we had given the thing up, for the present; it would be poor <reg orig="wis-|dom">wisdom</reg> <lb/>
to antagonize the Church.</p>
<p>As for the general condition of the <lb/>
country, it was as it had been when I <lb/>
arrived in it, to all intents and purposes <lb/>
I had made changes, but they were <lb/>
necessarily slight, and they were not <lb/>
noticeable. Thus far, I had not even <lb/>
meddled with taxation, outside of the <lb/>
taxes which <reg orig="pro-|vided">provided</reg> <lb/>
the royal <lb/>
revenues. I had <lb/>
systematized <lb/>
those, and put the service <lb/>
on an effective and <reg orig="right-|eous">righteous</reg> <lb/>
basis. As a result, <lb/>
these revenues were <reg orig="al-|ready">already</reg> <lb/>
quadrupled, and yet <lb/>
the burden was so much <lb/>
more equably distributed <lb/>
than before, that all the <lb/>
kingdom felt a sense of relief, and the praises of my administration <lb/>
were hearty and general.</p>

<p>Personally, I struck an interruption, now, but I did not mind it, it <lb/>
could not have happened at a better time. Earlier it could have <lb/>
annoyed me, but now everything was in good hands and swimming <lb/>
right along. The king had reminded me several times, of late, <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="DSSR_000002494_0134"/>
that the postponement I had asked for, four years before, had about <lb/>
run out, now. It was a hint that I ought to be starting out to seek <lb/>
adventures and get up a reputation of a size to make me worthy of the <lb/>
honor of breaking a lance with Sir Sagramor, who was still out <reg orig="grail-|ing">grailing</reg>, <lb/>
but was being hunted for by various relief expeditions, and might <lb/>
be found any year, now. So you see I was expecting this interruption; <lb/>
it did not take me by surprise.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.<lb/> THE YANKEE IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURES.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">There</hi> never was such a country for wandering <lb/>
liars; and they were of both sexes. Hardly a <lb/>
month went by without one of these tramps <lb/>
arriving; and generally loaded with a tale about <lb/>
some princess or other wanting help <lb/>
to get her out of some far-away castle <lb/>
where she was held in captivity by a <lb/>
lawless scoundrel, usually a giant. Now <lb/>
you would think that the first thing the <lb/>
king would do <lb/>
after listening <lb/>
to such a <reg orig="nov-|elette">novelette</reg> <lb/>
from <lb/>
an entire <lb/>
stranger, <lb/>
would be to <lb/>
ask for <reg orig="creden-|tials&mdash;yes">credentials&mdash;yes</reg>, <lb/>
and <lb/>
a pointer or <lb/>
two as to <reg orig="lo-|cality">locality</reg> <lb/>
of <reg orig="cas-|tle">castle</reg>, <lb/>
best route <lb/>
to it, and so <lb/>
on. But <reg orig="no-|body">nobody</reg> <lb/>
ever thought of so simple and common-sense a thing as that. <lb/>
No, everybody swallowed these people's lies whole, and never asked <lb/>

a question of any sort or about anything. Well, one day when I was <lb/>
not around, one of these people came along&mdash;it was a she one, this <lb/>
time&mdash;and told a tale of the usual pattern. Her mistress was a <reg orig="cap-|tive">captive</reg> <lb/>
in a vast and gloomy castle, along with forty-four other young <lb/>
and beautiful girls, pretty much all of them princesses; they had been <lb/>
languishing in that cruel captivity for twenty-six years; the masters <lb/>
of the castle were three stupendous brothers, each with four arms and <lb/>
one eye&mdash;the eye in the centre of the forehead, and as big as a fruit. <lb/>
Sort of fruit not mentioned; their usual slovenliness in statistics.</p>
<p>Would you believe it? The king and the whole Round Table <lb/>
were in raptures over this preposterous opportunity for adventure. <lb/>
Every knight of the Table jumped for the chance, and begged for it; <lb/>
but to their vexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me, who <lb/>
had not asked for it at all.</p>
<p>By an effort, I contained my joy when <reg orig="Clar-|ence">Clarence</reg> <lb/>
brought me the news. But he&mdash;he could <lb/>
not contain his. His mouth gushed delight and <lb/>
gratitude in a steady discharge&mdash;delight <lb/>
in my good fortune, gratitude to the king <lb/>
for this splendid mark of his favor for me. <lb/>
He could keep neither his legs nor his <lb/>
body still, but pirouetted about the place <lb/>
in an airy ecstasy of happiness.</p>

<p>On my side, I could have <lb/>

sake, and did what I could to let on to be glad. Indeed, I <hi rend="italic">said</hi> <lb/>
I was glad. And in a way it was true; I was as glad as a person is <lb/>
when he is scalped.</p>
<p>Well, one must make the best of things, and not waste time with <lb/>
useless fretting, but get down to business and see what can be done. <lb/>
In all lies there is wheat among the chaff; I must get at the wheat <lb/>
in this case: so I sent for the girl and she came. She was a comely <lb/>
enough creature, and soft and modest, but if signs went for anything, <lb/>
she didn't know as much as a lady's watch. I said&mdash;</p>
<p>"My dear, have you been questioned as to particulars?"</p>
<p>She said she hadn't.</p>
<p>"Well, I didn't expect you had, but I thought I would ask to <lb/>
make sure; it's the way I've been raised. Now you mustn't take it <lb/>
unkindly if I remind you that as we don't know you, we must go a <lb/>
little slow. You may be all right, of course, and we'll hope that you <lb/>
are; but to take it for granted isn't business. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> understand that. <lb/>
I'm obliged to ask you a few questions; just answer up fair and <lb/>
square, and don't be afraid. Where do you live, when you are at <lb/>

<p>"Do you know anybody here who can identify you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I reckon that's about the size of it. Don't mind my <lb/>

<p>"<hi rend="italic">How</hi> many?"</p>

even all castles and all directions thereunto vanish out of the earth, <lb/>
leaving the places wherein they tarried desolate and vacant, so <lb/>

digestion is all disordered with eating food that was raised forever and <lb/>
ever before he was born; good land! a man can't keep his functions <lb/>

they fog a thing up so that you can't tell anything about it. <lb/>
Run along, dear; good-day; show her the way, Clarence."</p>
<p>Oh, well, it was reasonably plain, now, why these donkeys didn't <lb/>
prospect these liars for details. It may be that this girl had a fact in <lb/>
her somewhere, but I don't believe you could have sluiced it out with <lb/>
a hydraulic; nor got it with the earlier forms of blasting, even; it was <lb/>
a case for dynamite. Why, she was a perfect ass; and yet the king <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="DSSR_000002494_0144"/>
and his knights had listened to her as if she had been a leaf out of the <lb/>
gospel. It kind of sizes up the whole party. And think of the simple <lb/>
ways of this court: this wandering wench hadn't any more trouble to <lb/>
get access to the king in his palace than she would have had to get <lb/>
into the poor-house in my day and country. In fact he was glad to <lb/>
see her, glad to hear her tale; with that adventure of hers to offer, she <lb/>
was as welcome as a corpse is to a coroner.</p>
<p>Just as I was ending-up these reflections, Clarence came back. I <lb/>
remarked upon the barren result of my efforts with the girl; hadn't got <lb/>
hold of a single point that could help me to find the castle. The <lb/>
youth looked a little surprised, or puzzled, or something, and intimated <lb/>
that he had been wondering to himself what I had wanted to ask the <lb/>
girl all those questions for.</p>
<p>"Why, great guns," I said, "don't I want to find the castle? And <lb/>
how else would I go about it?"</p>
<p>"La, sweet your worship, one may lightly answer that, I ween. <lb/>
She will go with thee. They always do. She will ride with thee."</p>
<p>"Ride with me? Nonsense!"</p>
<p>"But of a truth she will. She will ride with thee. Thou shalt see."</p>
<p>"What? She browse around the hills and scour the woods with <lb/>
me&mdash;alone&mdash;and I as good as engaged to be married? Why, it's <reg orig="scan-|dalous">scandalous</reg>. <lb/>
Think how it would look."</p>
<p>My, the dear face that rose before me! The boy was eager to <lb/>
know all about this tender matter. I swore him to secrecy and then <lb/>
whispered her name&mdash;"Puss Flanagan." He looked disappointed, <lb/>
and said he didn't remember the countess. How natural it was for the <lb/>
little courtier to give her a rank. He asked me where she lived.</p>
<p>"In East Har&mdash;"I came to myself and stopped, a little confused; <lb/>
then I said, "Never mind, now; I'll tell you sometime."</p>
<p>And might he see her? Would I let him see her some day?</p>
<p>It was but a little thing to promise&mdash;thirteen hundred years or so&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="134" entity="DSSR_000002494_0145"/>
and he so eager; so I said Yes. But I sighed; I couldn't help it. <lb/>
And yet there was no sense in sighing, for she wasn't born yet. But <lb/>
that is the way we are made: we don't reason, where we feel; we just <lb/>
feel.</p>
<p>My expedition was all the talk that day and that night, and the <lb/>
boys were very good to me, and made much of me, and seemed to <lb/>
have forgotten their vexation and disappointment, and come to be as <lb/>
anxious for me to hive those ogres and set those ripe old virgins loose <lb/>
as if it were themselves that had the contract. Well, they <hi rend="italic">were</hi> good <lb/>
children&mdash;but just children, that is all. And they gave me no end of <lb/>
points about how to scout for giants, and how to scoop them in; and <lb/>
they told me all sorts of charms against enchantments, and gave me <lb/>
salves and other rubbish to put on my wounds. But it never occurred <lb/>
to one of them to reflect that if I was such a wonderful necromancer <lb/>
as I was pretending to be, I ought not to need salves or instructions, <lb/>
or charms against enchantments, and least of all, arms and armor, on <lb/>
a foray of any kind&mdash;even against fire-spouting dragons, and devils hot <lb/>
from perdition, let alone such poor adversaries as these I was after, <lb/>
these commonplace ogres of the back settlements.</p>
<p>I was to have an early breakfast, and start at dawn, for that was <lb/>
the usual way; but I had the demon's own time with my armor, and <lb/>
this delayed me a little. It is troublesome to get into, and there is so <lb/>
much detail. First you wrap a layer or two of blanket around your <lb/>
body, for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold iron; then you put <lb/>
on your sleeves and shirt of chain-mail&mdash;these are made of small steel <lb/>
links woven together, and they form a fabric so flexible that if you <lb/>
toss your shirt onto the floor, it slumps into a pile like a peck of <lb/>
wet fish-net; it is very heavy and is nearly the uncomfortablest <reg orig="mate-|rial">material</reg> <lb/>
in the world for a night-shirt, yet plenty used it for that&mdash;tax <reg orig="col-|lectors">collectors</reg>, <lb/>
and reformers, and one-horse kings with a defective title, and <lb/>
those sorts of people; then you put on your shoes&mdash;flat-boats roofed <lb/>
<pb n="135" entity="DSSR_000002494_0146"/>
over with interleaving bands of steel&mdash;and screw your clumsy spurs <lb/>
into the heels. Next you buckle your greaves on your legs, and your <lb/>
cuisses on your thighs; then come your backplate and your <reg orig="breast-|plate">breastplate</reg>, <lb/>
and you begin to feel crowded; then you hitch onto the <reg orig="breast-|plate">breastplate</reg> <lb/>
the half-petticoat of broad overlapping bands of steel which <lb/>
hangs down in front but is scolloped out behind so you can sit down, <lb/>
and isn't any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle, either for <lb/>
looks or for wear, or to wipe your hands on; next you belt on your <lb/>
sword; then you put your stove-pipe joints onto your arms, your iron <lb/>
gauntlets onto your hands, your iron rat-trap onto your head, with a <lb/>
rag of steel web hitched onto it to hang over the back of your neck <lb/>
&mdash;and there you are, snug as a candle in a candle-mould. This is no <lb/>
time to dance. Well, a man that is packed away like that, is a nut <lb/>
that isn't worth the cracking, there is so little of the meat, when you <lb/>
get down to it, by comparison with the shell.</p>
<p>The boys helped me, or I never could have got in. Just as we <lb/>
finished, Sir Bedivere happened in, and I saw that as like as not I <lb/>
hadn't chosen the most convenient outfit for a long trip. How <lb/>
stately he looked; and tall and broad and grand. He had on his <lb/>
head a conical steel casque that only came down to his ears, and <lb/>
for visor had only a narrow steel bar that extended down to his <lb/>
upper lip and protected his nose; and all the rest of him, from neck <lb/>
to heel, was flexible chain-mail, trowsers and all. But pretty much <lb/>
all of him was hidden under his outside garment, which of course <lb/>
was of chain-mail, as I said, and hung straight from his shoulders <lb/>
to his ancles; and from his middle to the bottom, both before and <lb/>
behind, was divided, so that he could ride and let the skirts hang <lb/>
down on each side. He was going grailing, and it was just the outfit <lb/>
for it, too. I would have given a good deal for that ulster, but it <lb/>
was too late now to be fooling around. The sun was just up, the <lb/>
king and the court were all on hand to see me off and wish me <lb/>
<pb n="136" entity="DSSR_000002494_0147"/>
luck; so it wouldn't be etiquette for me to tarry. You don't get on <lb/>
your horse yourself; no, if you tried it you would get disappointed. <lb/>
They carry you out, just as they carry a sun-struck man to the drug <lb/>
store, and put you on, and help get you to rights, and fix your feet <lb/>
in the stirrups; and all the while you do feel so strange and stuffy <lb/>
and like somebody else&mdash;like somebody that has been married on a <lb/>
sudden, or struck by lightning, or something like that, and hasn't <lb/>
quite fetched around, yet, and is sort of numb, and can't just get <lb/>
his bearings. Then they stood up the mast they called a spear, in <lb/>
its socket by my left foot, and I gripped it with my hand; lastly <lb/>
they hung my shield around my neck, and I was all complete and <lb/>

  <head>"AND SO WE STARTED."</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="137" entity="DSSR_000002494_0148"/>
ready to up anchor and get to sea. Everybody was as good to me <lb/>
as they could be, and a maid of honor gave me the stirrup-cup her <lb/>
own self. There was nothing more to do, now, but for that damsel <lb/>
to get up behind me on a pillion, which she did, and put an arm or <lb/>
so around me to hold on.</p>
<p>And so we started; and everybody gave us a good-bye and waved <lb/>
their handkerchiefs or helmets. And everybody we met, going down <lb/>
the hill and through the village was respectful to us, except some <lb/>
shabby little boys on the outskirts. They said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Oh, what a guy!" And hove clods at us.</p>
<p>In my experience boys are the same in all ages. They don't <lb/>
respect anything, they don't care for anything or anybody. They <lb/>
say "Go up, baldhead" to the prophet going his unoffending way in <lb/>
the gray of antiquity; they sass me in the holy gloom of the Middle <lb/>
Ages; and I had seen them act the same way in Buchanan's <reg orig="admin-|istration">administration</reg>; <lb/>
I remember, because I was there and helped. The prophet <lb/>
had his bears and settled with his boys; and I wanted to get down <lb/>
and settle with mine, but it wouldn't answer, because I couldn't have <lb/>
got up again. I hate a country without a derrick.</p>

away in billowy perspective to the <lb/>

fleck of white or gray on a <lb/>
wave-summit, which we knew was a castle. We crossed broad <lb/>
natural lawns sparkling with dew, and we moved like spirits, the <lb/>

cushioned turf giving out no sound of foot-fall; we dreamed along <lb/>
through glades in a mist of green light that got its tint from the <reg orig="sun-|drenched">sun-drenched</reg> <lb/>
roof of leaves overhead, and by our feet the clearest and <lb/>
coldest of runlets went frisking and gossiping over its reefs and <reg orig="mak-|ing">making</reg> <lb/>
a sort of whispering music comfortable to hear; and at times we <lb/>
left the world behind and entered into the solemn great deeps and <lb/>
rich gloom of the forest, where furtive wild things whisked and <reg orig="scur-|ried">scurried</reg> <lb/>
by and were gone before you could <lb/>
even get your eye on the place where the <lb/>
noise was; and where only the earliest <lb/>
birds were turning out and getting to business with a song here and a <lb/>
quarrel yonder and a mysterious far-off hammering and drumming for <lb/>
worms on a tree-trunk away somewhere in the impenetrable <reg orig="remote-|nesses">remotenesses</reg> <lb/>
of the woods. And by and by out we would swing again into <lb/>
the glare.</p>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f56" entity="DSSR_000002494_0153">
  <head>THE JOURNEY.</head>
 </figure>
<p>About the third or fourth or fifth time that we swung out into the <lb/>
glare&mdash;it was along there somewhere, a couple of hours or so after <lb/>
sun-up&mdash;it wasn't as pleasant as it had been. It was beginning to get <lb/>
hot. This was quite noticeable. We had a very long pull, after that, <lb/>
without any shade. Now it is curious how progressively little frets <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="DSSR_000002494_0154"/>
grow and multiply after they once get a start. Things which I didn't <lb/>
mind at all, at first, I began to mind now&mdash;and more and more, too, <lb/>
all the time. The first ten or fifteen times I wanted my handkerchief <lb/>
I didn't seem to care; I got along, and said never mind, it isn't any <lb/>
matter, and dropped it out of my mind. But now it was different; I <lb/>
wanted it all the time; it was nag, nag, nag, right along, and no rest; <lb/>
I couldn't get it out of my mind; and so at last I lost my temper and <lb/>
said hang a man that would make a suit of armor without any pockets <lb/>
in it. You see I had my handkerchief in my helmet; and some other <lb/>
things; but it was that kind of a helmet that you can't take off by <lb/>
yourself. That hadn't occurred to me when I put it there; and in <lb/>
fact I didn't know it. I supposed it would be particularly convenient <lb/>
there. And so now, the thought of its being there, so handy and <lb/>
close by, and yet not get-at-able, made it all the worse and the harder <lb/>
to bear. Yes, the thing that you can't get is the thing that you want, <lb/>
mainly; everyone has noticed that. Well, it took my mind off from <lb/>
everything else; took it clear off, and centred it in my helmet; and <lb/>
mile after mile, there it staid, imagining the handkerchief, picturing <lb/>
the handkerchief; and it was bitter and aggravating to have the salt <lb/>
sweat keep trickling down into my eyes, and I couldn't get at it. It <lb/>
seems like a little thing, on paper, but it was not a little thing at all; <lb/>
it was the most real kind of misery. I would not say it if it was not <lb/>
so. I made up my mind that I would carry along a reticule next <lb/>
time, let it look how it might, and people say what they would. Of <lb/>
course these iron dudes of the Round Table would think it was <lb/>
scandalous, and maybe raise Sheol about it, but as for me, give me <lb/>
comfort first, and style afterwards. So we jogged along, and now and <lb/>
then we struck a stretch of dust, and it would tumble up in clouds <lb/>
and get into my nose and make me sneeze and cry; and of course I <lb/>
said things I oughtn't to have said, I don't deny that. I am not <lb/>
better than others. We couldn't seem to meet anybody in this <reg orig="lone-|some">lonesome</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="DSSR_000002494_0155"/>
Britain, not even an ogre; and in the mood I was in then, it <lb/>
was well for the ogre; that is, an ogre with a handkerchief. Most <lb/>
knights would have thought of nothing but getting his armor; but <lb/>
so I got his bandanna, he could keep his hardware, for all me.</p>
<p>Meantime it was getting hotter and hotter in there. You see, the <lb/>
sun was beating down and <reg orig="warm-|ing">warming</reg> <lb/>
up the iron more and more all <lb/>
the time. Well, when you are <lb/>
hot, that way, every little thing <lb/>
irritates you. When I trotted, I <lb/>
rattled like a crate of dishes, and <lb/>
that annoyed me; and moreover <lb/>
I couldn't seem to stand that <lb/>
shield slatting and banging, now <lb/>
about my breast, now around my <lb/>
back; and if I dropped into a <lb/>
walk my joints creaked and <lb/>
screeched in that wearisome way <lb/>
that a wheelbarrow does, and as <lb/>
we didn't create any breeze at <lb/>
that gait, I was like to get fried <lb/>
in that stove; and besides. the <lb/>
quieter you went the heavier the <lb/>
iron settled down on you and the <lb/>
more and more tons you seemed <lb/>
to weigh every minute. And you <lb/>
had to be always changing hands, and passing your spear over to the <lb/>
other foot, it got so irksome for one hand to hold it long at a time.</p>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f57" entity="DSSR_000002494_0155">
  <head>EFFECT OF THE SUN ON THE IRON CLOTHES.</head>
 </figure>
<p>Well, you know, when you perspire that way, in rivers, there comes <lb/>
a time when you when you&mdash;well, when you itch. You are inside, <lb/>
your hands are outside; so there you are; nothing but iron between. <lb/>
<pb n="145" entity="DSSR_000002494_0156"/>
It is not a light thing, let it sound as it may. First it is one place; <lb/>
then another; then some more; and it goes on spreading and <reg orig="spread-|ing">spreading</reg>, <lb/>
and at last the territory is all occupied, and nobody can imagine <lb/>
what you feel like, nor how unpleasant it is. And when it had got to <lb/>
the worst, and it seemed to me that I could not stand anything more, <lb/>
a fly got in through the bars and settled on my nose, and the bars <lb/>
were stuck and wouldn't work, and I couldn't get the visor up; and I <lb/>
could only shake my head, which was baking hot by this time, and <lb/>
the fly&mdash;well, you know how a fly acts when he has got a certainty&mdash; <lb/>
he only minded the shaking enough to change from nose to lip, and <lb/>
lip to ear, and buzz and buzz all around in there, and keep on lighting <lb/>
and biting, in a way that a person already so distressed as I was, <lb/>
simply could not stand. So I gave in, and got Alisande to unship the <lb/>
helmet and relieve me of it. Then she emptied the conveniences out <lb/>
of it and fetched it full of water, and I drank and then stood up and <lb/>
she poured the rest down inside the armor. One cannot think how <lb/>
refreshing it was. She continued to fetch and pour until I was well <lb/>
soaked and thoroughly comfortable.</p>
<p>It was good to have a rest&mdash;and peace. But nothing is quite <reg orig="per-|fect">perfect</reg> <lb/>
in this life, at any time. I had made a pipe a while back, and <lb/>
also some pretty fair tobacco; not the real thing, but what some of <lb/>
the Indians use: the inside bark of the willow, dried. These <reg orig="com-|forts">comforts</reg> <lb/>
had been in the helmet, and now I had them again, but no <lb/>
matches.</p>
<p>Gradually, as the time wore along, one annoying fact was borne in <lb/>
upon my understanding&mdash;that we were weather-bound. An armed <lb/>
novice cannot mount his horse without help and plenty of it. Sandy <lb/>
was not enough; not enough for me, anyway. We had to wait until <lb/>
somebody should come along. Waiting, in silence, would have been <lb/>
agreeable enough, for I was full of matter for reflection, and wanted <lb/>
to give it a chance to work. I wanted to try and think out how it <lb/>
<pb entity="DSSR_000002494_0157"/>

  <head>"SHE CONTINUED TO FETCH AND POUR UNTIL I WAS WELL SOAKED."</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="147" entity="DSSR_000002494_0158"/>
was that rational or even half-rational men could ever have learned <lb/>
to wear armor, considering its inconveniences; and how they had <lb/>
managed to keep up such a fashion for generations when it was plain <lb/>
that what I had suffered to-day they had had to suffer all the days of <lb/>
their lives. I wanted to think that out; and moreover I wanted to <lb/>
think out some way to reform this evil and persuade the people to let <lb/>
the foolish fashion die out; but thinking was out of the question in <lb/>
the circumstances. You couldn't think, where Sandy was. She was <lb/>
a quite biddable creature and good-hearted, but she had a flow of talk <lb/>
that was as steady as a mill, and made your head sore like the drays <lb/>
and wagons in a city. If she had had a cork she would have been a <lb/>
comfort. But you can't cork that kind; they would die. Her clack <lb/>
was going all day, and you would think something would surely <reg orig="hap-|pen">happen</reg> <lb/>
to her works, by and by; but no, they never got out of order; <lb/>
and she never had to slack up for words. She could grind, and pump, <lb/>
and churn and buzz by the week, and never stop to oil up or blow out. <lb/>
And yet the result was just nothing but wind. She never had any <lb/>
ideas, any more than a fog has. She was a perfect blatherskite; I <lb/>
mean for jaw, jaw, jaw, talk, talk, talk, jabber, jabber, jabber; but just <lb/>
as good as she could be. I hadn't minded her mill that morning, on <lb/>
account of having that hornet's nest of other troubles; but more than <lb/>
once in the afternoon I had to say&mdash;</p>
<p>"Take a rest, child; the way you are using up all the domestic air, <lb/>
the kingdom will have to go to importing it by to-morrow, and it's a <lb/>
low enough treasury without that."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Yes,</hi> it is strange how little a while at a time a person can <lb/>

this sweet serenity in this secluded shady nook by this <lb/>
purling stream would have seemed, where I could keep <lb/>
perfectly comfortable all the time by pouring a dipper of <lb/>
water into my armor now and then; yet already I was <lb/>

I had forgotten to bring matches with me&mdash;and <lb/>
partly because we had nothing to cat. Here was another <lb/>
illustration of the childlike improvidence of this age and <lb/>

food on a journey, and would have been scandalized at the <lb/>
idea of hanging a basket of sandwiches on his spear. There <lb/>

was probably not a knight of all the Round Table combination who <lb/>
would not rather have died than been caught carrying such a thing as <lb/>
that on his flagstaff. And yet there could not be anything more <reg orig="sen-|sible">sensible</reg>. <lb/>
It had been my intention to smuggle a couple of sandwiches <lb/>
into my helmet, but I was interrupted in the act, and had to make an <lb/>
excuse and lay them aside, and a dog got them.</p>
<p>Night approached, and with it a storm. The darkness came on <lb/>
fast. We must camp, of course. I found a good shelter for the <lb/>
demoiselle under a rock, and went off and found another for myself. <lb/>
But I was obliged to remain in my armor, because I could not get it <lb/>
off by myself and yet could not allow Alisande to help, because it <lb/>
would have seemed so like undressing before folk. It would not have <lb/>
amounted to that in reality, because I had clothes on underneath; <lb/>
but the prejudices of one's breeding are not gotten rid of just at a jump, <lb/>
and I knew that when it came to stripping off that bob-tailed iron <lb/>
petticoat I should be embarrassed.</p>
<p>With the storm came a change of weather; and the stronger the <lb/>
wind blew, and the wilder the rain lashed around, the colder and <lb/>
colder it got. Pretty soon, various kinds of bugs and ants and worms <lb/>
and things began to flock in out of the wet and crawl down inside my <lb/>
armor to get warm; and while some of them behaved well enough, <lb/>
and snuggled up amongst my clothes and got quiet, the majority were <lb/>
of a restless, uncomfortable sort, and never stayed still, but went on <lb/>
prowling and hunting for they did not know what; especially the <lb/>
ants, which went tickling along in wearisome procession from one end <lb/>
of me to the other by the hour, and are a kind of creatures which I <lb/>
never wish to sleep with again. It would be my advice to persons <lb/>
situated in this way, to not roll or thrash around, because this excites <lb/>
the interest of all the different sorts of animals and makes every last <lb/>
one of them want to turn out and see what is going on, and this makes <lb/>
things worse than they were before, and of course makes you <reg orig="objur-|gate">objurgate</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="DSSR_000002494_0164"/>
harder, too, if you can. Still, if one did not roll and thrash <lb/>
around he would die; so perhaps it is as well to do one way as the <lb/>
other, there is no real choice. Even after I was frozen solid I could <lb/>
still distinguish that tickling, just as a corpse does when he is taking <lb/>
electric treatment. I said I would never wear armor after this trip.</p>
<p>All those trying hours whilst I was frozen and yet was in a living <lb/>
fire, as you may say, on account of that swarm of crawlers, that same <lb/>
unanswerable question kept circling and circling through my tired <lb/>
head: How do people stand this miserable armor? How have they <lb/>
managed to stand it all these generations? How can they sleep at <lb/>
night for dreading the tortures of next day?</p>
<p>When the morning came at last, I was in a bad enough plight: <lb/>
seedy, drowsy, fagged, from want of sleep; weary from thrashing <lb/>
around, famished from long fasting; pining for a bath, and to get rid <lb/>
of the animals; and crippled with rheumatism. And how had it fared <lb/>
with the nobly born, the titled aristocrat, the Demoiselle Alisande la <lb/>
Carteloise? Why, she was as fresh as a squirrel; she had slept like <lb/>
the dead; and as for a bath, probably neither she nor any other noble <lb/>
in the land had ever had one, and so she was not missing it. <reg orig="Meas-|ured">Measured</reg> <lb/>
by modern standards, they were merely modified savages, those <lb/>
people. This noble lady showed no impatience to get to breakfast&mdash; <lb/>
and that smacks of the savage, too. On their journeys those Britons <lb/>
were used to long fasts, and knew how to bear them; and also how <lb/>
to freight up against probable fasts before starting, after the style of <lb/>
the Indian and the anaconda. As like as not, Sandy was loaded for a <lb/>
three-day stretch.</p>
<p>We were off before sunrise, Sandy riding and I limping along <lb/>
behind. In half an hour we came upon a group of ragged poor <reg orig="crea-|tures">creatures</reg> <lb/>
who had assembled to mend the thing which was regarded as a <lb/>
road. They were as humble as animals to me; and when I proposed <lb/>
to breakfast with them, they were so flattered, so overwhelmed by <lb/>
<pb n="154" entity="DSSR_000002494_0165"/>
this extraordinary condescension of mine that at first they were not <lb/>
able to believe that I was in earnest. My lady put up her scornful <lb/>
lip and withdrew to one side; she said in their hearing that she would <lb/>
as soon think of eating with the other cattle&mdash;a remark which <reg orig="embar-|rassed">embarrassed</reg> <lb/>
these poor devils merely because it referred to them, and not <lb/>
because it insulted or offended them, for it didn't. And yet they were <lb/>
not slaves, not chattels. By a sarcasm of law and phrase they were <lb/>
freemen. Seven-tenths of the free population of the country were of <lb/>
just their class and degree: small "independent" farmers, artisans, <lb/>
etc.; which is to say, they were the nation, the actual Nation; they <lb/>
were about all of it that was useful, or worth saving, or really <reg orig="respect-|worthy">respect-worthy</reg>; <lb/>
and to subtract them would have been to subtract the Nation <lb/>
and leave behind some dregs, some refuse, in the shape of a king, <lb/>
nobility and gentry, idle, unproductive, acquainted mainly with the <lb/>
arts of wasting and destroying, and of no sort of use or value in any <lb/>
rationally constructed world. And yet, by ingenious contrivance, <lb/>
this gilded minority, instead of being in the tail of <lb/>
the procession where it belonged, was marching <lb/>
head up and banners flying, at the other end of it; <lb/>

  <head>"BY A SARCASM OF LAW AND PHRASE THEY WERE FREEMEN."</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="155" entity="DSSR_000002494_0166"/>
had elected itself to be the Nation, and these innumerable clams had <lb/>
permitted it so long that they had come at last to accept it as a truth; <lb/>
and not only that, but to believe it right and as it should be. The <lb/>
priests had told their fathers and themselves that this ironical state of <lb/>
things was ordained of God; and so, not reflecting upon how unlike <lb/>
God it would be to amuse himself with sarcasms, and especially such <lb/>
poor transparent ones as this, they had dropped the matter there and <lb/>
become respectfully quiet.</p>
<p>The talk of these meek people had a strange enough sound in a <lb/>
formerly American ear. They were <reg orig="free-|men">freemen</reg>, <lb/>
but they could not leave the estates <lb/>

threatened storm; they had to let him plant fruit trees in their fields, <lb/>
and then keep their indignation to themselves when his heedless fruit <lb/>
gatherers trampled the grain around the trees; they had to smother <lb/>
their anger when his hunting parties galloped through their fields <reg orig="lay-|ing">laying</reg> <lb/>

freeman had <lb/>
liberty to bestow <lb/>
the remnant in <lb/>
his barn, in case it was worth the trouble; there were taxes, and <lb/>
taxes, and taxes, and more taxes, and taxes again, and yet other <lb/>
taxes&mdash;upon this free and independent pauper, but none upon his <lb/>
lord the baron or the bishop, none upon the wasteful nobility or the <lb/>
all-devouring Church; if the baron would sleep unvexed, the freeman <lb/>
must sit up all night after his day's work and whip the ponds to keep <lb/>
the frogs quiet; if the freeman's daughter&mdash;but no, that last infamy of <lb/>
monarchical government is unprintable; and finally, if the freeman, <lb/>
grown desperate with his tortures, found his life unendurable under <lb/>
such conditions, and sacrificed it and fled to death for mercy and <lb/>
refuge, the gentle Church condemned him to eternal fire, the gentle <lb/>

law buried him at midnight at the cross-roads with a stake through <lb/>
his back, and his master the baron or the bishop confiscated all his <lb/>
property and turned his widow and his orphans out of doors.</p>
<p>And here were these freemen assembled in the early morning to <lb/>
work on their lord the bishop's road three days each&mdash;gratis; every <lb/>
head of a family, and every son of a family, three days each, gratis, <lb/>
and a day or so added for their servants. Why, it was like reading <lb/>
about France and the French, before the ever-memorable and blessed <lb/>
Revolution, which swept a thousand years of such villany away in <lb/>
one swift tidal-wave of blood&mdash;one: a settlement of that hoary debt <lb/>
in the proportion of half a drop of blood for each hogshead of it that <lb/>
had been pressed by slow tortures out of that people in the weary <lb/>
stretch of ten centuries of wrong and shame and misery the like of <lb/>
which was not to be mated but in hell. There were two "Reigns of <lb/>
Terror," if we would but remember it and consider it; the one <lb/>
wrought murder in hot passion, the other in heartless cold blood; the <lb/>
one lasted mere months, the other had lasted a thousand years; the <lb/>
one inflicted death upon ten thousand persons, the other upon a <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
millions; but our shudders are all for the "horrors" of the minor <lb/>
Terror, the momentary Terror, so to speak; whereas, what is the <reg orig="hor-|ror">horror</reg> <lb/>
of swift death by the axe, compared with life-long death from <reg orig="hun-|ger">hunger</reg>, <lb/>
cold, insult, cruelty and heart-break? What is swift death by <lb/>
lightning compared with death by slow fire at the stake? A city <reg orig="ceme-|tery">cemetery</reg> <lb/>
could contain the coffins filled by that brief Terror which we have <lb/>
all been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over; but all <lb/>
France could hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real <lb/>
Terror&mdash;that unspeakably bitter and awful Terror which none of us <lb/>
has been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves.</p>
<p>These poor ostensible freemen who were sharing their breakfast <lb/>
and their talk with me, were as full of humble reverence for their king <lb/>
and Church and nobility as their worst enemy could desire. There <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="DSSR_000002494_0169"/>
was something pitifully ludicrous about it. I asked them if they <reg orig="sup-|posed">supposed</reg> <lb/>
a nation of people ever existed, who, with a free vote in every <lb/>
man's hand, would elect that a single family and its descendants <lb/>
should reign over it forever, whether gifted or boobies, to the <reg orig="exclu-|sion">exclusion</reg> <lb/>
of all other families&mdash;including the voter's; and would also elect <lb/>
that a certain hundred families should be raised to dizzy summits of <lb/>
rank, and clothed-on with offensive transmissible glories and <reg orig="privi-|leges">privileges</reg> <lb/>
to the exclusion of the rest of the nation's families&mdash;<hi rend="italic">including <lb/>
his own.</hi></p>
<p>They all looked unhit, and said they didn't know; that they had <lb/>
never thought about it before, and it hadn't ever occurred to them <lb/>
that a nation could be so situated that every man <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have a say in <lb/>
the government. I said I had seen one&mdash;and that it would last until <lb/>
it had an Established Church. Again they were all unhit&mdash;at first. <lb/>
But presently one man looked up and asked me to state that <reg orig="propo-|sition">proposition</reg> <lb/>
again; and state it slowly, so it could soak into his <reg orig="understand-|ing">understanding</reg>. <lb/>
I did it; and after a little he had the idea, and he brought his <lb/>
fist down and said <hi rend="italic">he</hi> didn't believe a nation where every man had a <lb/>
vote would voluntarily get down in the mud and dirt in any such way; <lb/>
and that to steal from a nation its will and preference must be a crime <lb/>
and the first of all crimes.</p>
<p>I said to myself:</p>
<p>"This one's a man. If I were backed by enough of his sort, I <lb/>
would make a strike for the welfare of this country, and try to prove <lb/>
myself its loyalest citizen by making a wholesome change in its <reg orig="sys-|tem">system</reg> <lb/>
of government."</p>
<p>You see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to one's country, not to its <lb/>
institutions or its office-holders. The country is the real thing, the <reg orig="sub-|stantial">substantial</reg> <lb/>
thing, the eternal thing; it is the thing to watch over, and care <lb/>
for, and be loyal to; institutions are extrancous, they are its mere <reg orig="cloth-|ing">clothing</reg>, <lb/>
and clothing can wear out, become ragged, cease to be <reg orig="comfor-|table">comfortable</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="DSSR_000002494_0170"/>
cease to protect the body from winter, disease, and death. <lb/>
To be loyal to rags, to shout for rags, to worship rags, to die <lb/>
for rags&mdash;that is a loyalty of unreason, it is pure animal; it <lb/>
belongs to monarchy, was invented by monarchy; let <reg orig="mon-|archy">monarchy</reg> <lb/>
keep it. I was from Connecticut, whose Constitution <lb/>
declares "that all political power is inherent in the <reg orig="peo-|ple">people</reg>, <lb/>
and all free governments <lb/>
are founded on their authority <lb/>
and instituted for their <reg orig="bene-|fit">benefit</reg>; <lb/>
and that they have <hi rend="italic">at <lb/>
all times</hi> an undeniable and <lb/>
indefeasible right to <hi rend="italic">alter <lb/>
their form of government</hi> <lb/>
in such a manner as <lb/>
they may think <reg orig="ex-|pedient">expedient</reg>."</p>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f64" entity="DSSR_000002494_0170">
  <head>"TWO OF A KIND."</head>
 </figure>
<p>Under that <reg orig="gos-|pel">gospel</reg>, <lb/>
the citizen who <lb/>
thinks he sees that the commonwealth's political clothes are worn out, <lb/>
and yet holds his peace and does not agitate for a new suit, is <reg orig="dis-|loyal">disloyal</reg>; <lb/>
he is a traitor. That he may be the only one who thinks he <lb/>
sees this decay, does not excuse him; it is his duty to agitate any <lb/>
way, and it is the duty of the others to vote him down if they do not <lb/>
see the matter as he does.</p>
<p>And now here I was, in a country where a right to say how the <lb/>
country should be governed was restricted to six persons in each <lb/>
thousand of its population. For the nine hundred and ninety-four <lb/>
to express dissatisfaction with the regnant system and propose to <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="DSSR_000002494_0171"/>
change it, would have made the whole six shudder as one man, it <lb/>
would have been so disloyal, so dishonorable, such putrid black <reg orig="trea-|son">treason</reg>. <lb/>
So to speak, I was become a stockholder in a corporation where <lb/>
nine hundred and ninety-four of the members furnished all the money <lb/>
and did all the work, and the other six elected themselves a <reg orig="perma-|nent">permanent</reg> <lb/>
board of direction and took all the dividends. It seemed to me <lb/>
that what the nine hundred and ninety-four dupes needed was a new <lb/>
deal. The thing that would have best suited the circus side of my <lb/>
nature would have been to resign the Boss-ship and get up an <reg orig="insurrec-|tion">insurrection</reg> <lb/>
and turn it into a revolution; but I knew that the Jack Cade or <lb/>
the Wat Tyler who tries such a thing without first educating his <reg orig="mate-|rials">materials</reg> <lb/>
up to revolution-grade is almost absolutely certain to get left. I <lb/>
had never been accustomed to getting left, even if I do say it myself. <lb/>
Wherefore, the "deal" which had been for some time working into <lb/>
shape in my mind was of a quite different pattern from the Cade-Tyler <lb/>
sort.</p>
<p>So I did not talk blood and insurrection to that man there who sat <lb/>
munching black bread with that abused and mistaught herd of human <lb/>
sheep, but took him aside and talked matter of another sort to him. <lb/>
After I had finished, I got him to lend me a little ink from his veins; <lb/>
and with this and a sliver I wrote on a piece of bark&mdash;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Put him in the Man-Factory&mdash;</hi> <lb/>
and gave it to him, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Take it to the palace at Camelot and give it into the hands of <lb/>
Amyas le Poulet, whom I call Clarence, and he will understand."</p>
<p>"He is a priest, then," said the man, and some of the enthusiasm <lb/>
went out of his face.</p>
<p>"How&mdash;a priest? Didn't I tell you that no chattel of the Church, <lb/>
no bond-slave of pope or bishop can enter my Man-Factory? Didn't <lb/>
I tell you that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> couldn't enter unless your religion, whatever it might <lb/>
be, was your own free property?"</p>
<pb n="161" entity="DSSR_000002494_0172"/>
<p>"Marry, it is so, and for that I was glad; wherefore it liked me not, <lb/>
and bred in me a cold doubt, to hear of this priest being there."</p>
<p>"But he isn't a priest, I tell you."</p>
<p>The man looked far from satisfied. He said:</p>
<p>"He is not a priest, and yet can read?"</p>
<p>"He is not a priest and yet can read&mdash;yes, and write, too, for that <lb/>
matter. I taught him myself." The man's face cleared. "And it is <lb/>
the first thing that you yourself will be taught in that Factory&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I? I would give blood out of my heart to know that art. Why, <lb/>
I will be your slave, your&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No you won't, you won't be anybody's slave. Take your family <lb/>
and go along. Your lord the bishop will confiscate your small <reg orig="prop-|erty">property</reg>, <lb/>
but no matter, Clarence will fix you all right."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I paid</hi> three pennies for my breakfast, and a most <lb/>
extravagant price it was, too, seeing that one <lb/>
could have breakfasted a dozen persons for that <lb/>
money; but I was feeling good by this time, and <lb/>
I had always been a kind of spendthrift any <lb/>
way; and then these people had wanted to <lb/>
give me the food for nothing, scant as their <lb/>
provision was, and so it was a grateful <reg orig="pleas-|ure">pleasure</reg> <lb/>
to emphasize my appreciation and <lb/>
sincere thankfulness with a good big <lb/>
financial lift where the money would do <lb/>
so much more good than it would in my <lb/>
helmet, where, these pennies being made <lb/>
of iron and not stinted in weight, my <lb/>
half dollar's worth was a good deal of <lb/>
a burden to me. I spent money rather <lb/>
too freely in those days, it is true; but <lb/>
one reason for it was that I hadn't got <lb/>
the proportions of things entirely adjusted, <lb/>
even yet, after so long a sojourn in Britain&mdash; <lb/>
hadn't got along to where I was able to <reg orig="ab-|solutely">absolutely</reg> <lb/>
realize that a penny in Arthur's <lb/>
land and a couple of dollars in Connecticut <lb/>
were about one and the same thing: just twins, as you may say, in <lb/>
purchasing power. If my start from Camelot could have been delayed <lb/>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f66" entity="DSSR_000002494_0176"/>-->
<pb n="166" entity="DSSR_000002494_0177"/>
a very few days I could have paid these people in beautiful new coins <lb/>
from our own mint, and that would have pleased me; and them, too, <lb/>
not less. I had adopted the American values exclusively. In a week <lb/>
or two now, cents, nickels, dimes, quarters and half dollars, and also <lb/>
a trifle of gold, would be trickling in thin but steady streams all <lb/>
through the commercial veins of the kingdom, and I looked to see <lb/>
this new blood freshen up its life.</p>
<p>The farmers were bound to throw in something, to sort of offset my <lb/>
liberality, whether I would or no; so I let them give me a flint and <lb/>
steel; and as soon as they had confortably bestowed Sandy and me <lb/>
on our horse, I lit my pipe. When the first blast of smoke shot out <lb/>
through the bars of my helmet, all those people broke for the woods, <lb/>
and Sandy went over backwards and struck the ground with a dull <lb/>
thud. They thought I was one of those fire-belching dragons they <lb/>
had heard so much about from knights and other professional liars. I <lb/>
had infinite trouble to persuade those people to venture back within <lb/>
explaining distance. Then I told them that this was only a bit of <lb/>
enchantment which would work harm to none but my enemies. And <lb/>
I promised, with my hand on my heart, that if all who felt no enmity <lb/>
toward me would <lb/>
come forward and <lb/>
pass before me they <lb/>
should see that only <lb/>
those who remained <lb/>
behind would be <lb/>
struck dead. The <lb/>
procession moved <lb/>
with a good deal of <lb/>
promptness. There <lb/>
were no casualties <lb/>
to report, for <reg orig="no-|body">nobody</reg> <lb/>

had curiosity enough to remain behind to see what would <lb/>
happen.</p>
<p>I lost some time, now, for these big children, their fears gone, <lb/>
became so ravished with wonder over my awe-compelling fireworks <lb/>
that I had to stay there and smoke a couple of pipes out before they <lb/>
would let me go. Still the delay was not wholly unproductive, for it <lb/>
took all that time to get Sandy thoroughly wonted to the new thing, <lb/>
she being so close to it, you know. It plugged up her <reg orig="conversation-|mill">conversation-mill</reg>, <lb/>
too, for a considerable while, and that was a gain. But above all <lb/>
other benefits accruing, I had learned something. I was ready for any <lb/>
giant or any ogre that might come along, now.</p>
<p>We tarried with a holy hermit, that night, and my opportunity <lb/>
came about the middle of the next afternoon. We were crossing a <lb/>
vast meadow by way of short-cut, and I was musing absently, hearing <lb/>
nothing, seeing nothing, when Sandy suddenly interrupted a remark <lb/>
which she had begun that morning, with the cry&mdash;</p>
<p>"Defend thee, lord!&mdash;peril of life is toward!"</p>
<p>And she slipped down from the horse and <lb/>
ran a little way and stood. I looked <lb/>
up and <lb/>
saw, far off <lb/>
in the shade of <lb/>
a tree, half a dozen <lb/>
armed knights and their <lb/>
squires; and straightway <lb/>
there was bustle among <lb/>
them and tightening of <reg orig="sad-|dle-girths">saddle-girths</reg> <lb/>
for the mount. <lb/>
My pipe was ready and <lb/>
would have been lit, if I <lb/>
had not been lost in <lb/>

thinking about how to banish oppression from this land and restore to <lb/>
all its people their stolen rights and manhood without disobliging <lb/>
anybody. I lit up at once, and by the time I had got a good head of <lb/>
reserved steam on, here they came. All together, too; none of those <lb/>
chivalrous magnanimities which one reads so much about&mdash;one courtly <lb/>
rascal at a time, and the rest standing by to see fair play. No, they <lb/>
came in a body, they came with a whirr and a rush, they came like a <lb/>
volley from a battery; came with heads low down, plumes streaming <lb/>
out behind, lances advanced at a level. <lb/>
It was a handsome sight, a beautiful <lb/>
sight&mdash;for a man up a tree. I laid my <lb/>
lance in rest and waited, with my heart <lb/>
beating, till the iron wave was just <lb/>
ready to break over me, then spouted <lb/>
a column of white smoke through the <lb/>
bars of my helmet. You should have seen the wave go to pieces and <reg orig="scat-|ter">scatter</reg>! <lb/>
This was a finer sight than the <lb/>
other one.</p>

<p>But these people stopped, two or <lb/>
three hundred yards away, and this <lb/>
troubled me. My satisfaction <reg orig="col-|lapsed">collapsed</reg>, <lb/>
and fear came; I judged I was <lb/>
a lost man. But Sandy was radiant; and was going to be <reg orig="elo-|quent">eloquent</reg>, <lb/>
but I stopped her, and told her my magic had miscarried, <reg orig="some-|how">somehow</reg> <lb/>
or other, and she must mount, with all dispatch, and we must ride <lb/>
for life. No, she wouldn't. She said that my enchantment had <reg orig="dis-|abled">disabled</reg> <lb/>
those knights; they were not riding on, because they couldn't; <lb/>
wait, they would drop out of their saddles presently, and we would <lb/>
get their horses and harness. I could not deceive such trusting <reg orig="sim-|plicity">simplicity</reg>, <lb/>
so I said it was a mistake; that when my fireworks killed at all, <lb/>

they killed instantly; no, the men would not die, there was something <lb/>
wrong about my apparatus, I couldn't tell what; but we must hurry <lb/>
and get away, for those people would attack us again, in a minute. <lb/>
Sandy laughed, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Lack-a-day, sir, they be not of that breed! Sir Launcelot will <lb/>
give battle to dragons, and will abide by them, and will assail them <lb/>
again, and yet again, and still again, until he do conquer and destroy <lb/>
them; and so likewise will Sir Pellinore and Sir Aglovale and Sir <lb/>
Carados, and mayhap others, but there be none else that will venture <lb/>
it, let the idle say what the idle will. And, la, as to yonder base <reg orig="ruf-|flers">rufflers</reg>, <lb/>
think ye they have not their fill, but yet desire more?"</p>
<p>"Well, then, what are they waiting, for? Why don't they leave? <lb/>
Nobody's hindering. Good land, I'm willing to let bygones be <reg orig="by-|gones">bygones</reg>, <lb/>
I'm sure."</p>
<p>"Leave, is it? Oh, give thyself easement as to that. They dream <lb/>
not of it, no, not they. They wait to yield them."</p>
<p>"Come&mdash;really, is that 'sooth'&mdash;as you people say? If they want <lb/>
to, why don't they?"</p>
<p>"It would like them much; but an ye wot how dragons are <reg orig="es-|teemed">esteemed</reg>, <lb/>
ye would not hold them blamable. They fear to come."</p>
<p>"Well, then, suppose I go to them instead, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ah, wit ye well they would not abide your coming. I will go."</p>
<p>And she did. She was a handy person to have along on a raid. I <lb/>
would have considered this a doubtful errand, myself. I presently <lb/>
saw the knights riding away, and Sandy coming back. That was a <lb/>
relief. I judged she had somehow failed to get the first innings&mdash;I <lb/>
mean in the conversation; otherwise the interview wouldn't have been <lb/>
so short. But it turned out that she had managed the business well; <lb/>
in fact admirably. She said that when she told those people I was <lb/>
The Boss, it hit them where they lived: "smote them sore with fear <lb/>
and dread" was her word; and then they were ready to put up with <lb/>
<pb n="171" entity="DSSR_000002494_0182"/>
anything she might require. So she swore them to appear at Arthur's <lb/>
court within two days and yield them, with horse and harness, and be <lb/>
my knights henceforth, and subject to my command. How much <reg orig="bet-|ter">better</reg> <lb/>
she managed that thing than I should have done it myself! She <lb/>
was a daisy.</p>

<p>You see, I recognized my mistake at once. I had set her works <lb/>
agoing; it was my own fault; she would be thirty days getting down <lb/>
to those facts. And she generally began without a preface and <reg orig="finish-|ed">finished</reg> <lb/>
without a result. If you interrupted her she would either go right <lb/>
along without noticing, or answer with a couple of words, and go back <lb/>
and say the sentence over again. So, interruptions only did harm; <lb/>
and yet I had to interrupt, and interrupt pretty frequently, too, in <lb/>
order to save my life; a person would die if he let her monotony drip <lb/>
on him right along all day.</p>
<p>"Great Scott!" I said in my distress. She went right back and <lb/>
began over again:</p>
<p>"So they two departed and rode into a great forest. And&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Which</hi> two?"</p>
<p>"Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine. And so they came to an abbey of <lb/>
monks, and there were well lodged. So on the morn they heard their <lb/>
<pb n="177" entity="DSSR_000002494_0188"/>
masses in the abbey, and so they rode forth till they came to a great <lb/>
forest; then was Sir Gawaine ware in a valley by a turret, of twelve <lb/>
fair damsels, and two knights armed on great horses, and the damsels <lb/>
went to and fro by a tree. And then was Sir <reg orig="Ga-|waine">Gawaine</reg> <lb/>
ware how there hung a white shield on that <lb/>
tree, and ever as the damsels came by it they spit <lb/>
upon it, and some threw mire upon the shield&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Now, if I hadn't seen the like myself in this <lb/>
country, Sandy, I wouldn't believe it. But I've seen <lb/>
it, and I can just see those creatures now, <reg orig="parad-|ing">parading</reg> <lb/>
before that shield and <lb/>
acting like that. The <lb/>
women here do certainly <lb/>
act like all possessed. Yes, <lb/>
and I mean your best, too, <lb/>
society's very choicest <lb/>
brands. The humblest <reg orig="hello-|girl">hello-girl</reg> <lb/>

  <head>SIR GAWAINE AND SIR UWAINE.</head>
 </figure>
<p>"Hello-girl?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but don't you ask <lb/>
me to explain; it's a new <lb/>
kind of girl; they don't have <lb/>
them here; one often speaks <lb/>
sharply to them when they are not the least in fault, and he can't get over <lb/>
feeling sorry for it and ashamed of himself in thirteen hundred years, <lb/>
it's such shabby mean conduct and so unprovoked; the fact is, no <reg orig="gen-|tleman">gentleman</reg> <lb/>

<p>"Never mind her; never mind her; I tell you I couldn't ever <reg orig="ex-|plain">explain</reg> <lb/>
her so you would understand."</p>
<p>"Even so be it, sith ye are so minded. Then Sir Gawaine and Sir <lb/>
Uwaine went and saluted them, and asked them why they did that <lb/>
despite to the shield. Sirs, said the damsels, we shall tell you. There <lb/>
is a knight in this country that owneth this white shield, and he is a <lb/>
passing good man of his hands, but he hateth all ladies and <reg orig="gentle-|women">gentlewomen</reg>, <lb/>
and therefore we do all this despite to the shield. I will say <lb/>
you, said Sir Gawaine, it beseemeth evil a good knight to despise all <lb/>
ladies and gentlewomen, and peradventure though he hate you he hath <lb/>
some cause, and peradventure he loveth in some other places ladies <lb/>
and gentlewomen, and to be loved again, and he such a man of prowess <lb/>
as ye speak of&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Man of prowess&mdash;yes, that is the man to please them, Sandy. <lb/>
Man of brains&mdash;that is a thing they never think of. Tom Sayers&mdash; <lb/>
John Heenan&mdash;John L. Sullivan&mdash;pity but you could be here. You <lb/>
would have your legs under the Round Table and a "Sir" in front of <lb/>
your names within the twenty-four hours; and you could bring about <lb/>
a new distribution of the married princesses and duchesses of the Court <lb/>
in another twenty-four. The fact is, it is just a sort of polished-up <lb/>
court of Comanches, and there isn't a squaw in it who doesn't stand <lb/>
ready at the dropping of a hat to desert to the buck with the biggest <lb/>
string of scalps at his belt."</p>
<p>"&mdash;and he be such a man of prowess as ye speak of, said Sir <lb/>
Gawaine. Now what is his name? Sir, said they, his name is <reg orig="Mar-|haus">Marhaus</reg> <lb/>
the king's son of Ireland."</p>
<p>"Son of the king of Ireland, you mean; the other form doesn't <lb/>
mean anything. And look out and hold on tight, now, we must jump <lb/>
this gully. . . . There, we are all right now. This horse belongs in <lb/>

  <head>"LOOK OUT AND HOLD ON TIGHT!"</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="179" entity="DSSR_000002494_0190"/>
<p>"I know him well, said Sir Uwaine, he is a passing good <lb/>
knight as any is on live."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">On live.</hi> If you've got a fault in the world, Sandy, it is <lb/>
that you are a shade too archaic. But it isn't any matter."</p>
<p>"&mdash;for I saw him once proved at a justs where many knights <lb/>
were gathered, and that time there might no man withstand <lb/>
him. Ah, said Sir Gawaine, <reg orig="dam-|sels">damsels</reg>, <lb/>
methinketh ye are to blame, <lb/>
for it is to suppose he that hung <lb/>
that shield there will not be long <lb/>
therefrom, and then may those knights <lb/>
match him on horse-back, and that is <lb/>
more your worship than thus; for I will <lb/>
abide no longer to see a knight's shield <lb/>
dishonored. And therewith Sir <lb/>
Uwaine and Sir Gawaine departed <lb/>
a little from them, and then were <lb/>
they ware where Sir Marhaus <lb/>
came riding on a great horse <lb/>
straight toward them. And when <lb/>
the twelve damsels saw Sir <lb/>
Marhaus they fled into the <reg orig="tur-|ret">turret</reg> <lb/>
as they were wild, so that <lb/>
some of them fell by the way. Then the <lb/>
one of the knights of the tower dressed his <lb/>
shield, and said on high, Sir <reg orig="Mar-|haus">Marhaus</reg> <lb/>
defend thee. And so they ran <lb/>
together that the knight brake his <lb/>
spear on Marhaus, and Sir Marhaus <lb/>
smote him so hard that he brake <lb/>
his neck and the horse's back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, that is just the trouble about this state of things, it ruins so <lb/>

<p>"That saw the other knight of the turret, and dressed him toward <lb/>
Marhaus, and they went so eagerly together, that the knight of the <lb/>
turret was soon smitten down, horse and man, stark dead&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So these two knights came together with great random&mdash;"</p>
<p>I saw that I had been asleep and missed a chapter, but I didn't say <lb/>

<p>"&mdash;that Sir Uwaine smote Sir Marhaus that his spear brast in <lb/>

<p>"The truth is, Alisande, these archaics are a little <hi rend="italic">too</hi> simple; the <lb/>

in the matter of variety; they run too much to level Saharas of fact, <lb/>

  <head>MARHAUS, SON OF THE KING OF IRELAND, <lb/>

 </figure>
<p>It was a good deal of a lecture, <lb/>
I thought, but it didn't disturb <lb/>
Sandy, didn't turn a feather; her <lb/>
steam soared steadily up again, the <lb/>
minute I took off the lid:</p>
<p>"Then Sir Marhaus turned his <lb/>
horse and rode toward Gawaine with <lb/>
his spear. And when Sir Gawaine <lb/>
saw that, he dressed his shield, and <lb/>
they aventred their spears, and they <lb/>
came together with all the might <lb/>
of their horses, that either knight <lb/>
smote other so hard in the midst <lb/>
of their shields, but Sir Gawaine's <lb/>
spear brake&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I knew it would."</p>
<p>&mdash;"but Sir Marhaus's spear held; <lb/>
and therewith Sir Gawaine and his horse rushed down to the earth&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Just so&mdash;and brake his back."</p>
<pb n="182" entity="DSSR_000002494_0193"/>
<p>&mdash;"and lightly Sir Gawaine rose upon his feet and pulled out his <lb/>
sword, and dressed him toward Sir Marhaus on foot, and therewith <lb/>
either came unto other eagerly, and smote together with their swords, <lb/>
that their shields flew in cantels, and they bruised their helms and their <lb/>
hauberks, and wounded either other. But Sir Gawaine, fro it passed <lb/>
nine of the clock, waxed by the space of three hours ever stronger and <lb/>
stronger, and thrice his might was increased. All this espied Sir <reg orig="Mar-|haus">Marhaus</reg>, <lb/>
and had great wonder how his might increased, and so they <lb/>
wounded other passing sore; and then when it was come noon&mdash;"</p>
<p>The pelting sing-song of it carried me forward to scenes and sounds <lb/>
of my boyhood days:</p>
<p>"N-e-e-ew Haven! ten minutes for refreshments&mdash;knductr 'll <lb/>
strike the gong-bell two minutes before train leaves&mdash;passengers for <lb/>
the Shore-line please take seats in the rear k'yar, this k'yar don't go <lb/>

<p>&mdash;"and waxed past noon and drew towards evensong. Sir Gawaine's <lb/>
strength feebled and waxed passing faint, that unnethes he might <lb/>
dure any longer, and Sir Marhaus was then bigger and bigger&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Which strained his armor, of course; and yet little would one of <lb/>
these people mind a small thing like that."</p>
<p>&mdash;"and so, Sir Knight, said Sir Marhaus, I have well felt that ye <lb/>
are a passing good knight, and a marvelous man of might as ever I <lb/>
felt any, while it lasteth, and our quarrels are not great, and therefore <lb/>
it were a pity to do you hurt, for I feel you are passing feeble. Ah, <lb/>
said Sir Gawaine, gentle knight, ye say the word that I should say. <lb/>
And therewith they took off their helms and either kissed other, and <lb/>
there they swore together either to love other as brethren&mdash;"</p>
<p>But I lost the thread there, and dozed off to slumber, thinking about <lb/>
what a pity it was that men with such superb strength&mdash;strength <lb/>
enabling them to stand up cased in cruelly burdensome iron and <lb/>
drenched with perspiration, and hack and batter and bang each other <lb/>
<pb n="183" entity="DSSR_000002494_0194"/>
for six hours on a stretch&mdash;should not have been born at a time when <lb/>
they could put it to some useful purpose. Take a jackass, for instance: <lb/>
a jackass has that kind of strength, and puts it to a useful purpose, <lb/>
and is valuable to this world because he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a jackass; but a nobleman <lb/>
is not valuable because he is a jackass. It is a mixture that is always <lb/>
ineffectual, and should never have been attempted in the first place. <lb/>
And yet, once you start a mistake, the trouble is done and you never <lb/>
know what is going to come of it.</p>
<p>When I came to myself again and began to listen, I perceived that <lb/>
I had lost another chapter, and that Alisande had wandered a long <lb/>
way off with her people.</p>
<p>"And so they rode and came into a deep valley full of stones, and <lb/>
thereby they saw a fair stream of water; above thereby was the head <lb/>
of the stream, a fair fountain, and three damsels sitting thereby. In <lb/>
this country, said Sir Marhaus, came never knight since it was <reg orig="chris-|tened">christened</reg>, <lb/>
but he found strange adventures&mdash;"</p>
<p>"This is not good form, Alisande. Sir Marhaus the king's son <lb/>
of Ireland talks like all the rest; you ought to give him a brogue, or <lb/>
at least a characteristic expletive; by this means one would recognize <lb/>
him as soon as he spoke, without his ever being named. It is a <reg orig="com-|mon">common</reg> <lb/>
literary device with the great authors. You should make him <lb/>
say, 'In this country, be jabers, came never knight since it was <reg orig="chris-|tened">christened</reg>, <lb/>
but he found strange adventures, be jabers.' You see how much <lb/>
better that sounds."</p>
<p>&mdash;"came never knight but he found strange adventures, be jabers. <lb/>
Of a truth it doth indeed, fair lord, albeit 'tis passing hard to say, <lb/>
though peradventure that will not tarry but better speed with usage. <lb/>
And then they rode to the damsels, and either saluted other, and the <lb/>
eldest had a garland of gold about her head, and she was threescore <lb/>
winter of age or more&mdash;"</p>
<p>"The <hi rend="italic">damsel</hi> was?"</p>
<pb n="184" entity="DSSR_000002494_0195"/>
<p>"Even so, dear lord&mdash;and her hair was white under the garland&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Celluloid teeth, nine dollars a set, as like as not&mdash;the loose-fit <lb/>
kind, that go up and down like a portcullis when you eat, and fall out <lb/>
when you laugh."</p>
<p>"The second damsel was of thirty winter of age, with a circlet of <lb/>
gold about her head. The third damsel was but fifteen year of age&mdash;"</p>
<p>Billows of thought came rolling over my soul, and the voice faded <lb/>
out of my hearing!</p>
<p>Fifteen! Break&mdash;my heart! oh, my lost darling! Just her age <lb/>
who was so gentle, and lovely, and all the world to me, and whom I <lb/>
shall never see again! How the thought of her carries me back over <lb/>
wide seas of memory to a vague dim time, a happy time, so many, <lb/>
many centuries hence, when I used to wake in the soft summer <lb/>
mornings, out of sweet dreams of her, and say "Hello, Central!" <lb/>
just to hear her dear voice come melting back to me with a "Hello, <lb/>
Hank!" that was music of the spheres to my enchanted ear. She got <lb/>
three dollars a week, but she was worth it."</p>
<p>I could not follow Alisande's further explanation of who our <reg orig="cap-|tured">captured</reg> <lb/>
knights were, now&mdash;I mean in case she should ever get to <lb/>
explaining who they were. My interest was gone, my thoughts were <lb/>
far away, and sad. By fitful glimpses of the drifting tale, caught <lb/>
here and there and now and then, I merely noted in a vague way <lb/>
that each of these three knights took one of these three damsels <lb/>
up behind him on his horse, and one rode north, another east, the <lb/>
other south, to seek adventures, and meet again and lie, after year and <lb/>
day. Year and day&mdash;and without baggage. It was of a piece with <lb/>
the general simplicity of the country.</p>
<p>The sun was now setting. It was about three in the afternoon when <lb/>
Alisande had begun to tell me who the cow-boys were; so she had <lb/>
made pretty good progress with it&mdash;for her. She would arrive some <lb/>
time or other, no doubt, but she was not a person who could be hurried.</p>
<pb n="185" entity="DSSR_000002494_0196"/>
<p>We were approaching a castle which stood on high ground; a huge, <lb/>
strong, venerable structure, whose gray towers and battlements were <lb/>
charmingly draped with ivy, and whose whole majestic mass was <lb/>
drenched with splendors flung from the sinking sun. It was the <reg orig="larg-|est">largest</reg> <lb/>
castle we had seen, and so I thought it might be the one we were <lb/>
after, but Sandy said no. She did not know who owned it; she said <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">If</hi> knights errant were to be believed, not all <lb/>
castles were desirable places to seek <reg orig="hospi-|tality">hospitality</reg> <lb/>
in. As a matter of fact, knights errant <lb/>
were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> persons to be believed&mdash;that is, <lb/>
measured by modern standards of veracity; <lb/>
yet, measured by the standards of their <lb/>
own time, and scaled accordingly, you <lb/>
got the truth. It was very simple: you <lb/>
discounted a statement ninety-seven <reg orig="per-|cent">percent</reg>; <lb/>
the rest was fact. Now after <reg orig="mak-|ing">making</reg> <lb/>
this allowance, the truth remained <lb/>
that if I could find out something about <lb/>
a castle before ringing the door-bell&mdash;I <lb/>
mean hailing the warders&mdash;it was the <lb/>
sensible thing to do. So I was <lb/>
pleased when I saw in the distance <lb/>
a horseman making the <lb/>
bottom turn of the road <lb/>
that wound down from <lb/>
this castle.</p>
<p>As we approached <lb/>
each other, I saw that <lb/>
he wore a plumed <reg orig="hel-|met">helmet</reg>, <lb/>
and seemed to be otherwise clothed in steel, but bore a curious <lb/>
addition also&mdash;a stiff square garment like a herald's tabard. However, <lb/>
 <!--<figure rend="inline" id="f79" entity="DSSR_000002494_0200"/>-->
<pb n="190" entity="DSSR_000002494_0201"/>
I had to smile at my own forgetfulness when I got nearer and read <lb/>
this sign on his tabard:</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"Persimmons's Soap&mdash;All the Prime-Donne Use It."</hi></p>
<p>That was a little idea of my own, and had several wholesome <reg orig="pur-|poses">purposes</reg> <lb/>
in view toward the civilizing and uplifting of this nation. In the <lb/>
first place, it was a furtive, underhand blow at this nonsense of knight <lb/>
errantry, though nobody suspected that but me. I had started a <reg orig="num-|ber">number</reg> <lb/>
of these people out&mdash;the bravest knights I could get&mdash;each <reg orig="sand-|wiched">sandwiched</reg> <lb/>
between bulletin-boards bearing one device or another, and I <lb/>
judged that by and by when they got to be numerous enough they <lb/>
would begin to look ridiculous; and then, even the steel-clad ass that <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">hadn't</hi> any board would himself begin to look ridiculous because he <lb/>
was out of the fashion.</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f80" entity="DSSR_000002494_0201">
  <head>"THIS WOULD UNDERMINE THE CHURCH."</head>
 </figure>
<p>Secondly, these missionaries would gradually, and without <reg orig="creat-|ing">creating</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="191" entity="DSSR_000002494_0202"/>
suspicion or exciting alarm, introduce a rudimentary cleanliness <lb/>
among the nobility, and from them it would work down to the people, <lb/>
if the priests could be kept quiet. This would undermine the Church. <lb/>
I mean would be a step toward that. Next, education&mdash;next, <reg orig="free-|dom&mdash;and">freedom&mdash;and</reg> <lb/>
then she would begin to crumble. It being my conviction <lb/>
that any Established Church is an established crime, an established <lb/>
slave-pen, I had no scruples, but was willing to assail it in any way or <lb/>
with any weapon that promised to hurt it. Why, in my own former <lb/>
day&mdash;in remote centuries not yet stirring in the womb of time&mdash;there <lb/>
were old Englishmen who imagined that they had been born in a free <lb/>
country: a "free" country with the Corporation Act and the Test still <lb/>
in force in it&mdash;timbers propped against men's liberties and dishonored <lb/>
consciences to shore up an Established Anachronism with.</p>
<p>My missionaries were taught to spell out the gilt signs on their <lb/>
tabards&mdash;the showy gilding was a neat idea, I could have got the king <lb/>
to wear a bulletin-board for the sake of that barbaric splendor&mdash;they <lb/>
were to spell out these signs and then explain to the lords and ladies <lb/>
what soap was; and if the lords and ladies were afraid of it, get them <lb/>
to try it on a dog. The missionary's next move was to get the family <lb/>
together and try it on himself; he was to stop at no experiment, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg> <lb/>
desperate, that could convince the nobility that soap was <reg orig="harm-|less">harmless</reg>; <lb/>
if any final doubt remained, he must catch a hermit&mdash;the woods <lb/>
were full of them; saints they called themselves, and saints they were <lb/>
believed to be. They were unspeakably holy, and worked miracles, <lb/>
and everybody stood in awe of them. If a hermit could survive a <lb/>
wash, and that failed to convince a duke, give him up, let him alone.</p>
<p>Whenever my missionaries overcame a knight errant on the road <lb/>
they washed him, and when he got well they swore him to go and get <lb/>
a bulletin-board and disseminate soap and civilization the rest of his <lb/>
days. As a consequence the workers in the field were increasing by <lb/>
degrees, and the reform was steadily spreading. My soap factory felt <lb/>
<pb n="192" entity="DSSR_000002494_0203"/>
the strain early. At first I had only two hands; but before I had <lb/>
left home I was already employing fifteen, and running night and <lb/>
day; and the atmospheric result was getting so pronounced <lb/>
that the king went sort of fainting and gasping around <lb/>
and said he did not believe he could stand it much longer, <lb/>
and Sir Launcelot got so that he did hardly anything but <lb/>
walk up and down the roof and swear, although I told him <lb/>
it was worse up there than anywhere else, but he said he <lb/>
wanted plenty of air; and he was always <reg orig="com-|plaining">complaining</reg> <lb/>
that a palace was no place for a soap <lb/>
factory, anyway, and said if a man was to start <lb/>
one in his house he would be damned if he <reg orig="would-|n't">wouldn't</reg> <lb/>
strangle him. There were <lb/>
ladies present, too, but <lb/>
much these people ever <lb/>
cared for that; they would <lb/>

<p>This missionary knight's <lb/>
name was La Cote Male Taile, <lb/>
and he said that this castle <lb/>
was the abode of Morgan le <lb/>
Fay, sister of King Arthur, <lb/>
and wife of King Uriens, <lb/>
monarch of a realm <lb/>
about as big as the <reg orig="Dis-|trict">District</reg> <lb/>

could stand in the middle of it and throw bricks into the <lb/>
next kingdom. "Kings" and "Kingdoms" were as thick in Britain <lb/>
as they had been in little Palestine in Joshua's time, when people had <lb/>
to sleep with their knees pulled up because they couldn't stretch out <lb/>
without a passport.</p>
<p>La Cote was much depressed, for he had scored here the worst <lb/>
failure of his campaign. He had not worked off a cake; yet he had <lb/>
tried all the tricks of the trade, even to the washing of a hermit; but <lb/>
the hermit died. This was indeed a bad failure, for this animal would <lb/>
now be dubbed a martyr, and would take his place among the saints <lb/>
of the Roman calendar. Thus made he his moan, this poor Sir La <lb/>
Cote Male Taile, and sorrowed passing sore. And so my heart bled <lb/>
for him, and I was moved to comfort and stay him. Wherefore I <lb/>
said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Forbear to grieve, fair knight, for this is not a defeat. We have <lb/>
brains, you and I; and for such as have brains there are no defeats, <lb/>
but only victories. Observe how we will turn this seeming disaster <lb/>
into an advertisement; an advertisement for our soap; and the biggest <lb/>
one, to draw, that was ever thought of; an advertisement that will <lb/>
transform that Mount Washington defeat into a Matterhorn victory. <lb/>
We will put on your bulletin-board, <hi rend="italic">'Patronized by the Elect.'</hi> How <lb/>
does that strike you?"</p>
<p>"Verily, it is wonderly bethought!"</p>
<p>"Well, a body is bound to admit that for just a modest little <reg orig="one-|line">one-line</reg> <lb/>
ad., it's a corker."</p>
<p>So the poor colporteur's griefs vanished away. He was a brave <lb/>
fellow, and had done mighty feats of arms in his time. His chief <reg orig="celeb-|rity">celebrity</reg> <lb/>
rested upon the events of an excursion like this one of mine, <lb/>
which he had once made with a damsel named Maledisant, who was <lb/>
as handy with her tongue as was Sandy, though in a different way, for <lb/>
her tongue churned forth only railings and insult, whereas Sandy's <lb/>
<pb n="194" entity="DSSR_000002494_0205"/>
music was of a kindlier sort. I knew his story well, and <lb/>
so I knew how to interpret the compassion that was in <lb/>
his face when he bade me farewell. He supposed <lb/>
I was having a bitter hard time of it.</p>
<p>Sandy and I discussed his story, as we rode <lb/>
along, and she said that La <lb/>
Cote's bad luck had begun <lb/>
with the very beginning of <lb/>
that trip; for the king's fool <lb/>
had overthrown him on the <lb/>
first day, and in such <lb/>
cases it was <reg orig="custom-|ary">customary</reg> <lb/>
for the girl to <reg orig="de-|sert">desert</reg> <lb/>

but Maledisant <lb/>
didn't do it; and also <lb/>
persisted afterward <lb/>
in sticking to him, <lb/>
after all his defeats. <lb/>
But, said I, suppose <lb/>
the victor should <reg orig="de-|cline">decline</reg> <lb/>
to accept his <lb/>
spoil? She said that <lb/>
that wouldn't answer <lb/>
&mdash;he must. He <reg orig="could-|n't">couldn't</reg> <lb/>
decline; it <reg orig="would-|n't">wouldn't</reg> <lb/>
be regular. I <lb/>
made a note of <lb/>
that. If Sandy's <lb/>

too <reg orig="burden-|some">burdensome</reg>, <lb/>

 </figure>
<pb n="195" entity="DSSR_000002494_0206"/>
some time, I would let a knight defeat me, on the chance that <lb/>
she would desert to him. </p>
<p>In due time we were challenged by the warders, from the castle <lb/>
walls, and after a parley admitted. I have nothing pleasant to tell <lb/>
about that visit. But it was not a disappointment, for I knew Mrs. le <lb/>
Fay by reputation, and was not expecting anything pleasant. She <lb/>
was held in awe by the whole realm, for she had made everybody <lb/>
believe she was a great sorceress. All her ways were wicked, all her <lb/>
instincts devilish. She was loaded to the eye-lids with cold malice. <lb/>
All her history was black with crime; and among her crimes murder <lb/>
was common. I was most curious to see her; as curious as I could <lb/>
have been to see Satan. To my surprise she was beautiful; black <lb/>
thoughts had failed to make her expression repulsive, age had failed <lb/>
to wrinkle her satin skin or mar its bloomy freshness. She could have <lb/>
passed for old Uriens's grand-daughter, she could have been mistaken <lb/>
for sister to her own son.</p>
<p>As soon as we were fairly within the castle gates we were ordered <lb/>
into her presence. King Uriens was there, a kind-faced old man with <lb/>
a subdued look; and also the son, Sir Uwaine le Blanchemains, in <lb/>
whom I was of course interested on account of the tradition that he <lb/>
had once done battle with thirty knights, and also on account of his <lb/>
trip with Sir Gawaine and Sir Marhaus, which Sandy had been aging <lb/>
me with. But Morgan was the main attraction, the conspicuous <reg orig="per-|sonality">personality</reg> <lb/>
here; she was head chief of this household, that was plain. <lb/>
She caused us to be seated, and then she began, with all manner of <lb/>
pretty graces and graciousnesses, to ask me questions. Dear me, it <lb/>
was like a bird or a flute, or something, talking. I felt persuaded that <lb/>
this woman must have been misrepresented, lied about. She trilled <lb/>
along, and trilled along, and presently a handsome young page, <lb/>
clothed like the rainbow, and as easy and undulatory of movement as <lb/>
a wave, came with something on a golden salver, and kneeling to <lb/>
<pb n="196" entity="DSSR_000002494_0207"/>
present it to her, overdid his graces and lost his balance, and so fell <lb/>
lightly against her knee. She slipped a dirk into him in as matter-<reg orig="of-|course">of-course</reg> <lb/>
a way as another person would have harpooned a rat! </p>
<p>Poor child, he slumped to the floor, twisted his silken limbs in one <lb/>
great straining contortion of pain, and was dead. Out of the old king <lb/>
was wrung an involuntary "O-h!" of compassion. The look he got, <lb/>
made him cut it suddenly short and not put any more hyphens in it. <lb/>
Sir Uwaine, at a sign from his mother, went to the ante-room and <lb/>
called some servants, and meanwhile madame went rippling sweetly <lb/>
along with her talk.</p>
<p>I saw that she was a good housekeeper, for while she talked she <lb/>
kept a corner of her eye on the servants to see that they made no balks <lb/>
in handling the body and getting it out; when they came with fresh <lb/>
clean towels, she sent back for the other kind; and when they had <lb/>
finished wiping the floor and were going, she indicated a crimson fleck <lb/>
the size of a tear which their duller eyes had overlooked. It was plain <lb/>
to me that La Cote Male Taile had failed to see the mistress of the <lb/>
house. Often, how louder and clearer than any tongue, does dumb <lb/>
circumstantial evidence speak.</p>
<p>Morgan le Fay rippled along as musically as ever. Marvelous <lb/>
woman. And what a glance she had: when it fell in reproof upon <lb/>
those servants, they shrunk and quailed as timid people do when the <lb/>
lightning flashes out of a cloud. I could have got the habit myself. <lb/>
It was the same with that poor old Brer Uriens; he was always on the <lb/>
ragged edge of apprehension; she could not even turn towards him <lb/>
but he winced.</p>
<p>In the midst of the talk I let drop a complimentary word about <lb/>
King Arthur, forgetting for the moment how this woman hated her <lb/>
brother. That one little compliment was enough. She clouded up <lb/>
like a strom; she called for her guards, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Hale me these varlets to the dungeons!"</p>
<pb n="197" entity="DSSR_000002494_0208"/>
<p>That struck cold on my ears, for her dungeons had a reputation. <lb/>
Nothing occurred to me to say&mdash;or do. But not so with Sandy. As <lb/>
the guard laid a hand upon me, she piped up with the tranquilest <reg orig="con-|fidence">confidence</reg>, <lb/>
and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"God's wownds, dost thou covet destruction, thou maniac? It is <lb/>
The Boss!"</p>
<p>Now what a happy idea that was!&mdash;and so simple; yet it would <lb/>
never have occurred to me. I was born modest; not all over, but in <lb/>
spots; and this was one of the spots.</p>
<p>The effect upon madame was electrical. It cleared her <reg orig="counte-|nance">countenance</reg> <lb/>
and brought back her smiles and all her persuasive graces and <lb/>
blandishments; but nevertheless she was not able to entirely cover up <lb/>
with them the fact that she was in a ghastly fright. She said: </p>
<p>"La, but do list to thine handmaid! as if one gifted with powers <lb/>
like to mine might say the thing which I have said unto one who has <lb/>
vanquished Merlin, and not be jesting. By mine enchantments I <reg orig="fore-|saw">foresaw</reg> <lb/>
your coming, and by them I knew you when you entered here. I <lb/>
did but play this little jest with hope to surprise you into some display <lb/>
of your art, as not doubting you would blast the guards with occult <lb/>
fires, consuming them to ashes on the spot, a marvel much beyond <lb/>
mine own ability, yet one which I have long been childishly curious <lb/>
to see."</p>
<p>The guards were less curious, and got out as soon as they got <reg orig="per-|mission">permission</reg>.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Madame</hi> seeing me pacific and unresentful, no <lb/>
doubt judged that I was deceived by her <reg orig="ex-|cuse">excuse</reg>; <lb/>
for her fright dissolved away, and she <lb/>
was soon so importunate to have me give an <lb/>
exhibition and kill somebody, that the thing <lb/>
grew to be embarrassing. However, to my <lb/>
relief she was presently interrupted by the call <lb/>
to prayers. I will say this much for the nobility: that, <lb/>
tyrannical, murderous, rapacious and morally rotten as <lb/>
they were, they were deeply and enthusiastically religious. <lb/>
Nothing could divert them from the regular and faithful <lb/>
performance of the pieties enjoined by the Church. More <lb/>
than once I had seen a noble who had gotten his enemy <lb/>
at a disadvantage, stop to pray before cutting his throat; <lb/>
more than once I had seen a noble, after ambushing and <lb/>
dispatching his enemy, retire to the nearest wayside shrine <lb/>
and humbly give thanks, without even waiting to rob the <lb/>
body. There was to be nothing finer or sweeter in the <lb/>
life of even Benvenuto Cellini, that rough-hewn saint, ten <lb/>
centuries later. All the nobles of Britain, with their <reg orig="fam-|ilies">families</reg>, <lb/>
attended divine service morning and night daily, in their private <lb/>
chapels, and even the worst of them had family worship five or six <lb/>
times a day besides. The credit of this belonged entirely to the <lb/>
Church. Although I was no friend to that Catholic Church, I was <lb/>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f84" entity="DSSR_000002494_0212"/>-->


<pb n="202" entity="DSSR_000002494_0213"/>
obliged to admit this. And often, in spite of me, I found myself saying, <lb/>
"What would this country be without the Church?" </p>
<p>After prayers we had dinner in a great banqueting hall which was <lb/>
lighted by hundreds of grease-jets, and everything was as fine and <lb/>
lavish and rudely splendid as might become the royal degree of the <lb/>
hosts. At the head of the hall, on a dais, was the table of the king, <lb/>
queen, and their son, Prince Uwaine. Stretching down the hall from <lb/>
this, was the general table, on the floor. At this, above the salt, sat <lb/>

the visiting nobles and the grown members of their families, of both <lb/>
sexes, &mdash;the resident Court, in effect,&mdash;sixty-one persons; below the <lb/>
salt sat minor officers of the household, with their principal <reg orig="subordi-|nates">subordinates</reg>: <lb/>
altogether a hundred and eighteen persons sitting, and about as <lb/>
many liveried servants standing behind their chairs, or serving in one <lb/>
capacity or another. It was a very fine show. In a gallery a band <lb/>
with cymbals, horns, harps and other horrors, opened the proceedings <lb/>
with what seemed to be the crude first-draft or original agony of the <lb/>
wail known to later centuries as "In the Sweet Bye and Bye." It was <lb/>
new, and ought to have been rehearsed a little more. For some <reg orig="rea-|son">reason</reg> <lb/>
or other the queen had the composer hanged, after dinner. </p>

  <head>"ORIGINAL AGONY."</head>

<pb n="204" entity="DSSR_000002494_0215"/>
<p>After this music, the priest who stood behind the royal table said a <lb/>
noble long grace in ostensible Latin. Then the battalion of waiters <lb/>
broke away from their posts, and darted, rushed, flew, fetched and <reg orig="car-|ried">carried</reg>, <lb/>
and the mighty feeding began; no words anywhere, but <reg orig="absorb-|ing">absorbing</reg> <lb/>
attention to business. The rows of chops opened and shut in vast <lb/>
unison, and the sound of it was like to the muffled burr of subterranean <lb/>
machinery. </p>
<p>The havoc continued an hour and a half, and unimaginable was the <lb/>
destruction of substantials. Of the chief feature of the feast&mdash;the huge <lb/>
wild boar that lay stretched out so portly and imposing at the start&mdash; <lb/>
nothing was left but the semblance of a hoop-skirt; and he was but <lb/>
the type and symbol of what had happened to all the other dishes. <lb/></p>
<p>With the pastries and so-on, the heavy drinking began&mdash;and the <lb/>
talk. Gallon after gallon of wine and mead disappeared, and <reg orig="every-|body">everybody</reg> <lb/>
got comfortable, then happy, then sparklingly joyous&mdash;both <lb/>
sexes,&mdash;and bye and bye pretty noisy. Men told anecdotes that were <lb/>
terrific to hear, but nobody blushed; and when the nub was sprung, <lb/>
the assemblage let go with a horse-laugh that shook the fortress. <lb/>
Ladies answered back with historiettes that would almost have made <lb/>
Queen Margaret of Navarre or even the great Elizabeth of England <lb/>
hide behind a handkerchief, but nobody hid here, but only laughed&mdash; <lb/>
howled, you may say. In pretty much all of these dreadful stories, <lb/>
ecclesiastics were the hardy heroes, but that didn't worry the chaplain <lb/>
any, he had his laugh with the rest; more than that, upon invitation <lb/>
he roared out a song which was of as daring a sort as any that was <lb/>
sung that night. </p>
<p>By midnight everybody was fagged out, and sore with laughing; <lb/>
and as a rule, drunk: some weepingly, some affectionately, some <reg orig="hilar-|iously">hilariously</reg>, <lb/>
some quarrelsomely, some dead and under the table. Of the <lb/>
ladies, the worst spectacle was a lovely young duchess, whose <reg orig="wedding-|eve">wedding-eve</reg> <lb/>
this was; and indeed she was a spectacle, sure enough. Just as <lb/>
<pb n="205" entity="DSSR_000002494_0216"/>
she was she could have sat in advance for the portrait of the young <lb/>
daughter of the Regent d'Orleans, at the famous dinner whence she <lb/>
was carried, foul-mouthed, intoxicated and helpless, to her bed, in the <lb/>
lost and lamented days of the Ancient Regime. </p>
<p>Suddenly, even while the priest was lifting his hands, and all <reg orig="con-|scious">conscious</reg> <lb/>
heads were bowed in reverent expectation of the coming <reg orig="bless-|ing">blessing</reg>, <lb/>
there appeared under the arch of the far-off door at the bottom of <lb/>
the hall, an old and bent and white-haired lady, leaning upon a <reg orig="crutch-|stick">crutch-stick</reg>; <lb/>
and she lifted the stick and pointed it toward the queen and <lb/>
cried out&mdash; </p>
<p>"The wrath and curse of God fall upon you, woman without pity, <lb/>
who have slain mine innocent grandchild and made desolate this old <lb/>
heart that had nor chick nor friend nor stay nor comfort in all this <lb/>
world but him!" </p>
<p>Everybody crossed himself in a grisly fright, for a curse was an <lb/>
awful thing to those people; but the queen rose up majestic, with the <lb/>
death-light in her eye, and flung back this ruthless command: </p>
<p>"Lay hands on her! To the stake with her!" </p>
<p>The guards left their posts to obey. It was a shame; it was a cruel <lb/>
thing to see. What could be done? Sandy gave me a look; I knew <lb/>
she had another inspiration. I said&mdash; </p>
<p>"Do what you choose." </p>
<p>She was up and facing toward the queen in a moment. She <reg orig="indi-|cated">indicated</reg> <lb/>
me, and said: </p>
<p>"Madame, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> saith this may not be. Recal the commandment, or <lb/>
he will dissolve the castle and it shall vanish away like the instable <lb/>
fabric of a dream!"</p>
<p>Confound it, what a crazy contract to pledge a person to! What <lb/>
if the queen&mdash; </p>
<p>But my consternation subsided there, and my panic passed off; for <lb/>
the queen, all in a collapse, made no show of resistance but gave a <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="DSSR_000002494_0217"/>
countermanding sign and sunk into her seat. When she reached it <lb/>
she was sober. So were many of the others. The assemblage rose, <lb/>
whiffed ceremony to the winds, and rushed for the door like a mob; <lb/>
overturning chairs, smashing crockery, tugging, struggling, <reg orig="shoulder-|ing">shouldering</reg>, <lb/>
crowding&mdash;anything to get out before I should change my mind <lb/>
and puff the castle into the measureless dim vacancies of space. Well, <lb/>
well, well, they <hi rend="italic">were</hi> a superstitious lot. It is all a body can do to <lb/>
conceive of it.</p>
<p>The poor queen was so scared and humbled that she was even <lb/>
afraid to hang the composer without first consulting me. I was very <lb/>
sorry for her&mdash;indeed any one would have been, for she was really <reg orig="suf-|fering">suffering</reg>; <lb/>
so I was willing to do anything that was reasonable, and had <lb/>
no desire to carry things to wanton extremities. I therefore <reg orig="consid-|ered">considered</reg> <lb/>
the matter thoughtfully, and ended by having the musicians <lb/>
ordered into our presence to play that Sweet Bye and Bye again, which <lb/>
they did. Then I saw that she was right, and gave her permission to <lb/>
hang the whole band. This little relaxation of sternness had a good <lb/>
effect upon the queen. A statesman gains little by the arbitrary <reg orig="exer-|cise">exercise</reg> <lb/>
of iron-clad authority upon all occasions that offer, for this wounds <lb/>
the just pride of his subordinates, and thus tends to undermine his <lb/>
strength. A little concession, now and then, where it can do no harm, <lb/>
is the wiser policy.</p>
<p>Now that the queen was at ease in her mind once more, and <lb/>
measurably happy, her wine naturally began to assert itself again, and <lb/>
it got a little the start of her. I mean it set her music going&mdash;her <lb/>
silver bell of a tongue. Dear me, she was a master talker. It would <lb/>
not become me to suggest that it was pretty late and that I was a tired <lb/>
man and very sleepy. I wished I had gone off to bed when I had the <lb/>
chance. Now I must stick it out; there was no other way. So she <lb/>
tinkled along and along, in the otherwise profound and ghostly hush <lb/>
of the sleeping castle, until bye and bye there came, as if from deep <lb/>
<pb n="207" entity="DSSR_000002494_0218"/>
down under us, a far-away sound, as of a muffled shriek&mdash;with an <lb/>
expression of agony about it that made my flesh crawl. The queen <lb/>
stopped, and her eyes lighted with pleasure; she tilted her graceful <lb/>
head as a bird does when it listens. The sound bored its way up <lb/>
through the stillness again.</p>
<p>"What is it?" I said.</p>
<p>"It is truly a stubborn soul, and endureth long. It is many hours <lb/>
now."</p>
<p>"Endureth what?"</p>
<p>"The rack. Come&mdash;ye shall see a blithe sight. An he yield not <lb/>
his secret now, ye shall see him torn asunder."</p>
<p>What a silky smooth hellion she was; and so composed and serene, <lb/>
when the cords all down my legs were hurting in sympathy with that <lb/>
man's pain. Conducted by mailed guards bearing flaring torches, we <lb/>
tramped along echoing corridors, and down stone stairways dank and <lb/>
dripping, and smelling of mould and ages of imprisoned night&mdash;a chill, <lb/>
uncanny journey and a long one, and not made the shorter or the <lb/>
cheerier by the sorceress's talk, which was about this sufferer and his <lb/>
crime. He had been accused by an anonymous informer, of having <lb/>
killed a stag in the royal preserves. I said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Anonymous testimony isn't just the right thing, your Highness. <lb/>
It were fairer to confront the accused with the accuser."</p>
<p>"I had not thought of that, it being but of small consequence. But <lb/>
an I would, I could not, for that the accuser came masked by night, <lb/>
and told the forester, and straightway got him hence again, and so the <lb/>
forester knoweth him not.</p>
<p>"Then is this Unknown the only person who saw the stag killed?"</p>
<p>"Marry, <hi rend="italic">no</hi> man <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> the killing, but this Unknown saw this hardy <lb/>
wretch near to the spot where the stag lay, and came with right loyal <lb/>
zeal and betrayed him to the forester."</p>
<p>"So the Unknown was near the dead stag, too? Isn't it just <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="208" entity="DSSR_000002494_0219"/>
that he did the killing himself? His loyal zeal&mdash;in a <lb/>
mask&mdash;looks just a shade suspicious. But what is your <reg orig="High-|ness's">Highness's</reg> <lb/>
idea for racking the prisoner? Where is the profit?" </p>
<p>"He will not confess, else; and then were his soul lost. For <lb/>
his crime his life is forfeited by the law&mdash;and of a surety will <lb/>
I see that he payeth it!&mdash;but it were <lb/>
peril to my own soul to let him die <reg orig="un-|confessed">unconfessed</reg> <lb/>
and unabsolved. Nay, I were <lb/>
a fool to fling me into hell for <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">his</hi> accommodation."</p>

  <head>"I CAUGHT A PICTURE THAT WILL NOT GO FROM ME."</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="209" entity="DSSR_000002494_0220"/>
<p>"But, your Highness, suppose he has nothing to confess?" </p>
<p>"As to that, we shall see, anon. An I rack him to death and he <lb/>
confess not, it will peradventure show that he had indeed naught to <lb/>
confess&mdash;ye will grant that that is sooth? Then shall I not be damned <lb/>
for an unconfessed man that had naught to confess&mdash;wherefore, I <lb/>
shall be safe."</p>
<p>It was the stubborn unreasoning of the time. It was useless to <lb/>
argue with her. Arguments have no chance against petrified training; <lb/>
they wear it as little as the waves wear a cliff. And her training was <lb/>
everybody's. The brightest intellect in the land would not have been <lb/>
able to see that her position was defective. </p>
<p>As we entered the rack-cell I caught a picture that will not go from <lb/>
me; I wish it would. A native young giant of thirty or thereabouts, <lb/>
lay stretched upon the frame on his back, with his wrists and ancles <lb/>
tied to ropes which led over windlasses at either end. There was no <lb/>
color in him; his features were contorted and set, and sweat-drops <lb/>
stood upon his forehead. A priest bent over him on each side; the <lb/>
executioner stood by; guards were on duty; smoking torches stood in <lb/>
sockets along the walis; in a corner crouched a poor young creature, <lb/>
her face drawn with anguish, a half-wild and hunted look in her eyes, <lb/>
and in her lap lay a little child asleep. Just as we stepped across the <lb/>
threshold the executioner gave his machine a slight turn, which wrung <lb/>
a cry from both the prisoner and the woman; but I shouted and the <lb/>
executioner released the strain without waiting to see who spoke. I <lb/>
could not let this horror go on; it would have killed me to see it. <lb/>
I asked the queen to let me clear the place and speak to the prisoner <lb/>
privately; and when she was going to object I spoke in a low voice <lb/>
and said I did not want to make a scene before her servants, but I must <lb/>
have my way; for I was King Arthur's representative, and was <reg orig="speak-|ing">speaking</reg> <lb/>
in his name. She saw she had to yield. I asked her to endorse me <lb/>
to these people, and then leave me. It was not pleasant for her, but <lb/>
<pb n="210" entity="DSSR_000002494_0221"/>
she took the pill; and even went further than I was meaning to require.</p>
<p>I only wanted the backing of her own authority; but she said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Ye will do in all things as this lord shall command. It is The <lb/>
Boss."</p>
<p>It was certainly a good word to conjure with: you could see it by <lb/>
the squirming of these rats. The queen's guards fell into line, and she <lb/>
and they marched away, with their torch-bearers, and woke the echoes <lb/>
of the cavernous tunnels with the measured beat of their retreating <lb/>
foot-falls. I had the prisoner taken from the rack and placed upon his <lb/>
bed, and medicaments applied to his hurts, and wine given him to <lb/>
drink. The woman crept near and looked on, eagerly, lovingly, but <lb/>
timorously,&mdash;like one who fears a repulse; indeed, she tried furtively to <lb/>
touch the man's forehead, and jumped back, the picture of fright, when <lb/>
I turned unconsciously toward her. It was pitiful to see. </p>
<p>"Lord," I said, "stroke him, lass, if you want to. Do anything <lb/>
you're a mind to; don't mind me."</p>
<p>Why, her eyes were as grateful as an animal's, when you do it a <lb/>
kindness that it understands. The baby was out of her way and she <lb/>
had her cheek against the man's in a minute, and her hands fondling <lb/>
his hair, and her happy tears running down. The man revived, and <lb/>
caressed his wife with his eyes, which was all he could do. I judged <lb/>
I might clear the den, now, and I did; cleared it of all but the family <lb/>
and myself. Then I said&mdash; </p>
<p>"Now my friend, tell me your side of this matter; I know the <lb/>
other side."</p>
<p>The man moved his head in sign of refusal. But the woman looked <lb/>
pleased&mdash;as it seemed to me&mdash;pleased with my suggestion. I went on: </p>
<p>"You know of me?" </p>
<p>"Yes. All do, in Arthur's realms." </p>
<p>"If my reputation has come to you right and straight, you should <lb/>
not be afraid to speak."</p>
<pb n="211" entity="DSSR_000002494_0222"/>
<p>The woman broke in, eagerly: </p>
<p>"Ah, fair my lord, do thou persuade him! Thou canst an thou <lb/>
wilt. Ah, he suffereth so; and it is for me&mdash;for <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> And how can I <lb/>
bear it? I would I might see him die&mdash;a sweet, swift death; oh, my <lb/>
Hugo, I cannot bear this one!"</p>
<p>And she fell to sobbing and groveling about my feet, and still <reg orig="im-|ploring">imploring</reg>. <lb/>
Imploring what? The man's death? I could not quite get <lb/>
the bearings of the thing. But Hugo interrupted her and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Peace! Ye wit not what ye ask. Shall I starve whom I love, to <lb/>
win a gentle death? I wend thou knewest me better."</p>
<p>"Well," I said, "I can't quite make this out. It is a puzzle. <lb/>
Now&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ah, dear my lord, an ye will but persuade him! Consider how <lb/>
these his tortures wound me! Oh, and he will not speak!&mdash;whereas, <lb/>
the healing, the solace that lie in a blessed swift death&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What <hi rend="italic">are</hi> you maundering about? He's going out from here a <lb/>
free man and whole&mdash;he's not going to die."</p>
<p>The man's white face lit up, and the woman flung herself at me in <lb/>
a most surprising explosion of joy, and cried out&mdash; </p>
<p>"He is saved!&mdash;for it is the King's word by the mouth of the <lb/>
king's servant&mdash;Arthur, the king whose word is gold!"</p>
<p>"Well, then you do believe I can be trusted, after all. Why didn't <lb/>
you before?"</p>
<p>"Who doubted? Not I, indeed; and not she."</p>
<p>"Well, why wouldn't you tell me your story, then?"</p>
<p>"Ye had made no promise; else had it been otherwise."</p>
<p>"I see, I see. . . . And yet I believe I don't quite see, after <lb/>
all. You stood the torture and refused to confess; which shows plain <lb/>
enough to even the dullest understanding that you had nothing to <lb/>
confess&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">I,</hi> my lord? How so? It was I that killed the deer!"</p>
<pb n="212" entity="DSSR_000002494_0223"/>
<p>"You <hi rend="italic">did?</hi> Oh, dear, this is the most mixed-up business that <lb/>
ever&mdash;" </p>
<p>"Dear lord, I begged him on my knees to confess, but&mdash;" </p>
<p>"You <hi rend="italic">did!</hi> It gets thicker and thicker. What did you want him <lb/>
to do that for?" </p>
<p>"Sith it would bring him a quick death and save him all this cruel <lb/>
pain." </p>
<p>"Well&mdash;yes, there is reason in that. But <hi rend="italic">he</hi> didn't want the quick <lb/>
death." </p>
<p>"He? Why, of a surety he <hi rend="italic">did.</hi>" </p>
<p>"Well, then, why in the world <hi rend="italic">didn't</hi> he confess?" </p>
<p>"Ah, sweet sir, and leave my wife and chick without bread and <lb/>
shelter?" </p>
<p>"Oh, heart of gold, now I see it! The bitter law takes the <reg orig="con-|victed">convicted</reg> <lb/>
man's estate and beggars his widow and his orphans. They <lb/>
could torture you to death, but without conviction or confession they <lb/>
could not rob your wife and baby. You stood by them like a man; <lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&mdash;true wife and true woman that you are&mdash;you would have <lb/>
bought him release from torture at cost to yourself of slow starvation <lb/>
and death&mdash;well, it humbles a body to think what your sex can do <lb/>
when it comes to self-sacrifice. I'll book you both for my colony; <lb/>
you'll like it there; it's a Factory where I'm going to turn groping and <lb/>
grubbing automata into <hi rend="italic">men.</hi>" </p>

<head>CHAPTER XVIII.<lb/> IN THE QUEEN'S DUNGEONS.</head>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Well</hi>, I arranged all that; and I had the <lb/>
man sent to his home. I had a great <lb/>
desire to rack the executioner; not <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
he was a good, pains-taking and <lb/>
pain-giving official,&mdash;for surely it was not to <lb/>
his discredit that he performed his functions <lb/>
well&mdash;but to pay him back for wantonly <reg orig="cuff-|ing">cuffing</reg> <lb/>
and otherwise distressing that young <lb/>
woman. The priests told me about this, and <lb/>
were generously hot to have him punished. <lb/>
Something of this disagreeable sort was <lb/>
turning up every now and then. I mean, <lb/>
episodes that showed that not all priests <lb/>
were frauds and self-seekers, but that many, <lb/>
even the <lb/>
great <reg orig="ma-|jority">majority</reg>, <lb/>
of <lb/>
these that <lb/>
were down <lb/>
on the <lb/>
ground <lb/>
among the common people, were sincere and right-hearted, and <reg orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg> <lb/>
to the alleviation of human troubles and sufferings. Well, it <lb/>
was a thing which could not be helped, so I seldom fretted about it, <lb/>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f89" entity="DSSR_000002494_0226"/>-->
<pb n="216" entity="DSSR_000002494_0227"/>
and never many minutes at a time; it has never been my way to <lb/>
bother much about things which you can't cure. But I did not like <lb/>
it, for it was just the sort of thing to keep people reconciled to an <lb/>
Established Church. We <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have a religion&mdash;it goes without <reg orig="say-|ing&mdash;but">saying&mdash;but</reg> <lb/>
my idea is, to have it cut up into forty free sects, so that they <lb/>
will police each other, as had been the case in the United States in my <lb/>
time. Concentration of power in a political machine is bad; and an <lb/>
Established Church is only a political machine; it was invented for <lb/>
that; it is nursed, cradled, preserved for that; it is an enemy to <lb/>
human liberty, and does no good which it could not better do in a <lb/>
split-up and scattered condition. That wasn't law; it wasn't gospel: <lb/>
it was only an opinion&mdash;my opinion, and I was only a man, one man: <lb/>
so it wasn't worth any more than the Pope's&mdash;or any less, for that <lb/>
matter. </p>
<p>Well, I couldn't rack the executioner, neither would I overlook the <lb/>
just complaint of the priests. The man must be punished some how <lb/>
or other, so I degraded him from his office and made him leader of the <lb/>
band&mdash;the new one that was to be started. He begged hard, and said <lb/>
he couldn't play&mdash;a plausible excuse, but too thin; there wasn't a <lb/>
musician in the country that could. </p>
<p>The queen was a good deal outraged, next morning, when she <lb/>
found she was going to have neither Hugo's life nor his property. But <lb/>
I told her she must bear this cross; that while by law and custom she <lb/>
certainly was entitled to both the man's life and his property, there <lb/>
were extenuating circumstances, and so in Arthur the king's name I <lb/>
had pardoned him. The deer was ravaging the man's fields, and he <lb/>
had killed it in sudden passion, and not for gain; and he had carried <lb/>
it into the royal forest in the hope that that might make detection of <lb/>
the misdoer impossible. Confound her, I couldn't make her see that <lb/>
sudden passion is an extenuating circumstance in the killing of <reg orig="veni-|son&mdash;or">venison&mdash;or</reg> <lb/>
of a person&mdash;so I gave it up and let her sulk it out. I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> <lb/>
<pb n="217" entity="DSSR_000002494_0228"/>
think I was going to make her see it by remarking that her own <reg orig="sud-|den">sudden</reg> <lb/>
passion in the case of the page modified that crime. <lb/>
<q>"Crime!" she exclaimed. "How thou talkest! Crime, forsooth! <lb/>
Man, I am going to <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> for him!" </q></p>
<p>Oh, it was no use to waste sense on her. Training&mdash;training is <lb/>
everything; training is all there is <hi rend="italic">to</hi> a person. We speak of nature; it <lb/>
is folly; there is no such thing as nature; what we call by that <reg orig="mislead-|ing">misleading</reg> <lb/>
name is merely heredity and training. We have no thoughts of our <lb/>
own, no opinions of our own; they are transmitted to us, trained <lb/>
into us. All that is original in us, and therefore fairly creditable or <lb/>
discreditable to us, can be covered up and hidden by the point of a <lb/>
cambric needle, all the rest being atoms contributed by, and inherited <lb/>
from, a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years to <lb/>
the Adam-clam or grasshopper or monkey from whom our race has <lb/>
been so tediously and ostentatiously and unprofitably developed. And <lb/>
as for me, all that I think about in this plodding sad pilgrimage, this <lb/>
pathetic drift between the eternities, is to look out and humbly live a <lb/>
pure and high and blameless life, and save that one microscopic atom <lb/>
in me that is truly <hi rend="italic">me:</hi> the rest may land in Sheol and welcome for all <lb/>
I care. </p>
<p>No, confound her, her intellect was good, she had brains enough, <lb/>
but her training made her an ass&mdash;that is, from a many-centuries-later <lb/>
point of view. To kill the page was no crime&mdash;it was her right; and <lb/>
upon her right she stood, serenely and unconscious of offense. She was <lb/>
a result of generations of training in the unexamined and unassailed <lb/>
belief that the law which permitted her to kill a subject when she <lb/>
chose was a perfectly right and righteous one. </p>
<p>Well, we must give even Satan his due. She deserved a <reg orig="compli-|ment">compliment</reg> <lb/>
for one thing; and I tried to pay it, but the words stuck in my <lb/>
throat. She had a right to kill the boy, but she was in no wise obliged <lb/>
to pay for him. That was law for some other people, but not for <lb/>
<pb n="218" entity="DSSR_000002494_0229"/>
her. She knew quite well that she was doing a large and generous <lb/>
thing to pay for that lad, and that I ought in common fairness to come <lb/>
out with something handsome about it, but I couldn't&mdash;my mouth <lb/>
refused. I couldn't help seeing, in my fancy, that poor old grandam <lb/>
with the broken heart, and that fair young creature lying butchered, <lb/>
his little silken pomps and vanities laced with his golden blood. How <lb/>
could she <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> for him? <hi rend="italic">Whom</hi> could she pay? And so, well knowing <lb/>
that this woman, trained as she had been, deserved praise, even <lb/>
adulation, I was yet not able to utter it, trained as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had been. The <lb/>
best I could do was to fish up a compliment from outside, so to speak <lb/>
&mdash;and the pity of it was, that it was true: <lb/>
 <figure rend="block" id="f90" entity="DSSR_000002494_0229">
  <head>THE CHURCH, THE KING, THE NOBLEMAN, AND THE FREEMAN.</head>
 </figure>
<q>"Madame, your people will adore you for this."</q></p>
<p>Quite true, but I meant to hang her for it some day, if I lived. <lb/>
Some of those laws were too bad, altogether too bad. A master might <lb/>
kill his slave for nothing: for mere spite, malice, or to pass the time&mdash; <lb/>
just as we have seen that the crowned head could do it with <hi rend="italic">his</hi> slave, <lb/>
that is to say, anybody. A gentleman could kill a free commoner, and <lb/>
pay for him&mdash;cash or garden-truck. A noble could kill a noble without <lb/>
<pb n="219" entity="DSSR_000002494_0230"/>
expense, as far as the law was concerned, but reprisals in kind were to <lb/>
be expected. <hi rend="italic">Any</hi>body could kill <hi rend="italic">some</hi>body, except the commoner and <lb/>
the slave; these had no privileges. If they killed, it was murder, and <lb/>
the law wouldn't stand murder. It made short work of the <reg orig="experi-|menter&mdash;and">experimenter&mdash;and</reg> <lb/>
of his family too, if he murdered somebody who belonged <lb/>
up among the ornamental ranks. If a commoner gave a noble even so <lb/>
much as a Damiens-scratch which didn't kill or even hurt, he got <lb/>
Damiens's dose for it just the same; they pulled him to rags and <reg orig="tat-|ters">tatters</reg> <lb/>
with horses, and all the world came to see the show, and crack <lb/>
jokes, and have a good time; and some of the performances of the best <lb/>
people present were as tough, and as properly unprintable, as any that <lb/>
have been printed by the pleasant Casanova in his chapter about the <lb/>
dismemberment of Louis XV's poor awkward enemy. </p>
<p>I had had enough of this grisly place by this time, and wanted to <lb/>
leave, but I couldn't, because I had something on my mind that my <lb/>
conscience kept prodding me about, and wouldn't let me forget. If I <lb/>
had the remaking of man, he wouldn't have any conscience. It is one <lb/>
of the most disagreeable things connected with a person; and although <lb/>
it certainly does a great deal of good, it cannot be said to pay, in the <lb/>
long run; it would be much better to have less good and more comfort. <lb/>
Still, this is only my opinion, and I am only one man; others, with less <lb/>
experience, may think differently. They have a right to their view. I <lb/>
only stand to this: I have noticed my conscience for many years, and <lb/>
I know it is more trouble and bother to me than anything else I started <lb/>
with. I suppose that in the beginning I prized it, because we prize <lb/>
anything that is ours; and yet how foolish it was to think so. If we <lb/>
look at it in another way, we see how absurd it is: if I had an anvil in <lb/>
me would I prize it? Of course not. And yet when you come to think, <lb/>
there is no real difference between a conscience and an anvil&mdash;I mean <lb/>
for comfort. I have noticed it a thousand times. And you could <reg orig="dis-|solve">dissolve</reg> <lb/>
an anvil with acids, when you couldn't stand it any longer; but <lb/>
<pb n="220" entity="DSSR_000002494_0231"/>
there isn't any way that you can work off a conscience&mdash;at least so it <lb/>
will stay worked off; not that I know of, anyway. </p>
<p>There was something I wanted to do before leaving, but it was a <lb/>
disagreeable matter, and I hated to go at it. Well, it bothered me all <lb/>
the morning. I could have mentioned it to the old king, but what <lb/>
would be the use?&mdash;he was but an extinct volcano; he had been active <lb/>
in his time, but his fire was out, this good while, he was only a stately <lb/>
ash-pile, now; gentle enough, and kindly enough for my purpose, <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
doubt, but not usable. He was nothing, this so-called king: the <lb/>
queen was the only power there. And she was a Vesuvius. As a favor, <lb/>
she might consent to warm a flock of sparrows for you, but then she <lb/>
might take that very opportunity to turn herself loose and bury a city. <lb/>
However, I reflected that as often as any other way, when you are <lb/>
expecting the worst, you get something that is not so bad, after all. </p>
<p>So I braced up and placed my matter before her royal Highness. I <lb/>
said I had been having a general jail-delivery at Camelot and among <lb/>
neighboring castles, and with her permission I would like to examine <lb/>
her collection, her bric-a-brac&mdash;that is to say, her prisoners. She <lb/>
resisted; but I was expecting that. But she finally consented. I was <lb/>
expecting that, too, but not so soon. That about ended my discomfort. <lb/>
She called her guards and torches, and we went down into the dungeons. <lb/>
These were down under the castle's foundations, and mainly were small <lb/>
cells hollowed out of the living rock. Some of these cells had no light <lb/>
at all. In one of them was a woman, in foul rags, who sat on the <lb/>
ground, and would not answer a question, or speak a word, but only <lb/>
looked up at us once or twice, through a cobweb of tangled hair, as if <lb/>
to see what casual thing it might be that was disturbing with sound <lb/>
and light the meaningless dull dream that was become her life; after <lb/>
that, she sat bowed, with her dirt-caked fingers idly interlocked in her <lb/>
lap, and gave no further sign. This poor rack of bones was a woman <lb/>
of middle age, apparently; but only apparently; she had been there <lb/>
<pb n="221" entity="DSSR_000002494_0232"/>
nine years, and was eighteen when she entered. She was a commoner, <lb/>
and had been sent here on her bridal night by Sir Breuse Sance Pit&eacute;, <lb/>
a neighboring lord whose vassal her father was, and to which said lord <lb/>
she had refused what has since been called <hi rend="italic">le droit du Seigneur;</hi> and <lb/>
moreover, had opposed violence to violence and spilt half a gill of his <lb/>
almost sacred blood. The young husband had interfered at that point, <lb/>
believing the bride's life in danger, and had flung the noble out into <lb/>
the midst of the humble and trembling wedding guests, in the parlor, <lb/>
and left him there astonished at this strange treatment, and <reg orig="implaca-|bly">implacably</reg> <lb/>
cmbittered against both bride and groom. The said lord being <lb/>
cramped for dungeon-room had asked the queen to accommodate his <lb/>
two criminals, and here in her bastile they had been ever since; hither <lb/>
indeed, they had come before their crime was an hour old, and had <lb/>
never seen each other since. Here they were, kerneled like toads in <lb/>
the same rock; they had passed nine pitch dark years within fifty feet <lb/>
of each other, yet neither knew whether the other was alive or not. <lb/>
All the first years, their only question had been&mdash;asked with <reg orig="beseech-|ings">beseechings</reg> <lb/>
and tears that might have moved stones, in time, perhaps, but <lb/>
hearts are not stones: "Is he alive?" "Is she alive?" But they had <lb/>
never got an answer; and at last that question was not asked any <lb/>
more&mdash;or any other. </p>
<p>I wanted to see the man, after hearing all this. He was <reg orig="thirty-|four">thirty-four</reg> <lb/>
years old, and looked sixty. He sat upon a squared block of <lb/>
stone, with his head bent down, his forearms resting on his knees, his <lb/>
long hair hanging like a fringe before his face, and he was muttering <lb/>
to himself. He raised his chin and looked us slowly over, in a listless <lb/>
dull way, blinking with the distress of the torch-light, then dropped <lb/>
his head and fell to muttering again and took no further notice of us. <lb/>
There were some pathetically suggestive dumb witnesses present. On <lb/>
his wrists and ancles were cicatrices, old smooth scars, and fastened <lb/>
to the stone on which he sat was a chain with manacles and fetters <lb/>
<pb n="222" entity="DSSR_000002494_0233"/>
attached; but this apparatus lay idle on the ground, and was thick <lb/>
with rust. Chains cease to be needed after the spirit has gone out of <lb/>
a prisoner. </p>
<p>I could not rouse the man; so I said we would take him to her, and <lb/>
see&mdash;to the bride who was the fairest thing in the earth to him, once <lb/>
&mdash;roses, pearls and dew made flesh, for him; a wonder-work, the <reg orig="mas-|ter-work">master-work</reg> <lb/>
of nature: with eyes like no other eyes, and voice like no <lb/>
other voice, and a freshness, and lithe young grace, and beauty, that <lb/>
belonged properly to the creatures of dreams&mdash;as he thought&mdash;and to <lb/>
no other. The sight of her would set his stagnant blood leaping; the <lb/>
sight of her&mdash; </p>
<p>But it was a disappointment. They sat together on the ground and <lb/>
looked dimly wondering into each other's faces a while, with a sort of <lb/>
weak animal curiosity; then forgot each other's presence, and dropped <lb/>
their eyes, and you saw that they were away again and wandering in <lb/>
some far land of dreams and shadows that we know nothing about. </p>
<p>I had them taken out and sent to their friends. The queen did not <lb/>
like it much. Not that she felt any personal interest in the matter, <lb/>
but she thought it disrespectful to Sir Breuse Sance Pit&eacute;. However, <lb/>
I assured her that if he found he couldn't stand it I would fix him so <lb/>
that he could. </p>
<p>I set forty-seven prisoners loose out of those awful rat-holes, and <lb/>
left only one in captivity. He was a lord, and had killed another <lb/>
lord, a sort of kinsman of the queen. That other lord had ambushed <lb/>
him to assassinate him, but this fellow had got the best of him and cut <lb/>
his throat. However, it was not for that that I left him jailed, but for <lb/>
maliciously destroying the only public well in one of his wretched <reg orig="vil-|lages">villages</reg>. <lb/>
The queen was bound to hang him for killing her kinsman, but <lb/>
I would not allow it: it was no crime to kill an assassin. But I said I <lb/>
was willing to let her hang him for destroying the well; so she <reg orig="con-|cluded">concluded</reg> <lb/>
to put up with that, as it was better than nothing. </p>
<pb n="223" entity="DSSR_000002494_0234"/>
<p>Dear me, for what trifling offenses the most of those forty-seven <lb/>
men and women were shut up there! Indeed some were there for no <lb/>
distinct offense at all, but only to gratify somebody's spite; and not <lb/>
always the queen's by any means, but a friend's. The newest <reg orig="prison-|er's">prisoner's</reg> <lb/>
crime was a mere remark which he had made. He said he <reg orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg> <lb/>
that men were about all alike, and one man as good as another, <lb/>
barring clothes. He said he believed that if you were to strip the <reg orig="na-|tion">nation</reg> <lb/>
naked and send a stranger through <lb/>
the crowd, he couldn't tell the king <lb/>
from a quack doctor, nor a duke <lb/>
from a hotel clerk. Apparently <lb/>
here was a man whose brains <lb/>
had not been reduced to an <lb/>
ineffectual mush by <reg orig="idi-|otic">idiotic</reg> <lb/>
training. I set him <lb/>
loose and sent him to <lb/>
the Factory. </p>
<p>Some of the cells <lb/>
carved in the living rock <lb/>
were just behind the face <lb/>
of the <reg orig="preci-|pice">precipice</reg>, <lb/>
and in <lb/>
each of these <lb/>
an arrow-slit <lb/>
had been <reg orig="pierc-|ed">pierced</reg> <lb/>
outward to <lb/>
the daylight, <lb/>
and so the <reg orig="cap-|tive">captive</reg> <lb/>
had a thin <lb/>
ray from the <lb/>
blessed sun <lb/>

  <head>"THE QUEEN'S OWN."</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="224" entity="DSSR_000002494_0235"/>
for his comfort. The case of one of these poor fellows was <reg orig="particu-|larly">particularly</reg> <lb/>
hard. From his dusky swallow's hole high up in that vast <lb/>
wall of native rock he could peer out through the arrow-slit and see <lb/>
his own home off yonder in the valley; and for twenty-two years he <lb/>
had watched it, with heart-ache and longing, through that crack. He <lb/>
could see the lights shine there at night, and in the daytime he could <lb/>
see figures go in and come out&mdash;his wife and children, some of them, no <lb/>
doubt, though he could not make out, at that distance. In the course <lb/>
of years he noted festivities there, and tried to rejoice, and wondered <lb/>
if they were weddings or what they might be. And he noted funerals; <lb/>
and they wrung his heart. He could make out the coffin, but he could <lb/>
not determine its size, and so could not tell whether it was wife or <lb/>
child. He could see the procession form, with priests and mourners, <lb/>
and move solemnly away, bearing the secret with them. He had left <lb/>
behind him five children and a wife; and in nineteen years he had seen <lb/>
five funerals issue, and none of them humble enough in pomp to denote <lb/>
a servant. So he had lost five of his treasures; there must still be one <lb/>
remaining&mdash;one now infinitely, unspeakably precious,&mdash;but <hi rend="italic">which</hi> one? <lb/>
wife, or child? That was the question that tortured him, by night and <lb/>
by day, asleep and awake. Well, to have an interest, of some sort, and <lb/>
half a ray of light, when you are in a dungeon, is a great support to the <lb/>
body and preserver of the intellect. This man was in pretty good <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
yet. By the time he had finished telling me his distressful tale, I <lb/>
was in the same state of mind that you would have been in yourself, if <lb/>
you have got average human curiosity: that is to say, I was as burning <lb/>
up as he was, to find out which member of the family it was that was <lb/>
left. So I took him over home myself; and an amazing kind of a <reg orig="sur-|prise">surprise</reg> <lb/>
party it was, too&mdash;typhoons and cyclones of frantic joy, and whole <lb/>
Niagaras of happy tears; and by George we found the aforetime young <lb/>
matron graying toward the imminent verge of her half century, and the <lb/>
babies all men and women, and some of them married and <reg orig="experiment-|ing">experimenting</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="225" entity="DSSR_000002494_0236"/>
family-wise themselves&mdash;for not a soul of the tribe was dead! <lb/>
Conceive of the ingenious devilishness of that queen: she had a special <lb/>
hatred for this prisoner, and she had <hi rend="italic">invented</hi> all those funerals herself, <lb/>
to scorch his heart with; and the sublimest stroke of genius of the <lb/>
whole thing was leaving the family-invoice a funeral <hi rend="italic">short,</hi> so as to let <lb/>
him wear his poor old soul out guessing. </p>
<p>But for me, he never would have got out. Morgan le Fay hated <lb/>
him with her whole heart, and she never would have softened toward <lb/>
him. And yet his crime was committed more in thoughtlessness than <lb/>
deliberate depravity. He had said she had red hair. Well, she had; <lb/>
but that was no way to speak of it. When red-headed people are above <lb/>
a certain social grade, their hair is auburn. </p>
<p>Consider it: among these forty-seven captives, there were five whose <lb/>
names, offences and dates of incarceration were no longer known! <lb/>
One woman and four men&mdash;all bent, and wrinkled, and mind-<reg orig="extin-|guished">extinguished</reg> <lb/>
patriarchs. They themselves had long ago forgotten these <lb/>
details; at any rate they had mere vague theories about them, <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg> <lb/>
definite and nothing that they repeated twice in the same way. <lb/>
The succession of priests whose office it had been to pray daily with <lb/>
the captives and remind them that God had put them there, for some <lb/>
wise purpose or other, and teach them that patience, humbleness, and <lb/>
submission to oppression was what He loved to see in parties of a <reg orig="sub-|ordinate">subordinate</reg> <lb/>
rank, had traditions about these poor old human ruins, but <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg> <lb/>
more. These traditions went but little way, for they concerned the <lb/>
length of the incarceration only, and not the names or the offences. <lb/>
And even by the help of tradition the only thing that could be proven <lb/>
was that none of the five had seen daylight for thirty-five years: how <lb/>
much longer this privation had lasted was not guessable. The king and <lb/>
the queen knew nothing about these poor creatures, except that they <lb/>
were heirlooms, assets inherited, along with the throne, from the former <lb/>
firm. Nothing of their history had been transmitted with their persons, <lb/>
<pb n="226" entity="DSSR_000002494_0237"/>
and so the inheriting owners had considered them of no value, and had <lb/>
felt no interest in them. I said to the queen&mdash; <lb/>
<q>"Then why in the world didn't you set them free?" </q></p>
<p>The question was a puzzler. She didn't know <hi rend="italic">why</hi> she hadn't; the <lb/>

thing had never come up in her mind. So here she was, forecasting <lb/>
the veritable history of future prisoners of the castle d'If, without <reg orig="know-|ing">knowing</reg> <lb/>
it. It seemed plain to me now, that with her training, those <reg orig="in-|herited">inherited</reg> <lb/>
prisoners were merely property&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. <lb/>
Well, when we inherit property, it does not occur to us to throw it <lb/>
away, even when we do not value it. </p>
<p>When I brought my procession of human bats up into the open <lb/>
world and the glare of the afternoon sun&mdash;previously blind-folding <lb/>
them, in charity for eyes so long untortured by light&mdash;they were a <lb/>
spectacle to look at. Skeletons, scarecrows, goblins, pathetic frights, <lb/>
every one: legitimatest possible children of Monarchy by the Grace of <lb/>
God and the Established Church. I muttered absently&mdash; </p>
<p>"I <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> I could photograph them!" </p>
<p>You have seen that kind of people who will never let on that they <lb/>
don't know the meaning of a new big word. The more ignorant they <lb/>
are, the more pitifully certain they are to pretend you haven't shot over <lb/>
their heads. The queen was just one of that sort, and was always <lb/>
making the stupidest blunders by reason of it. She hesitated a <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg>; <lb/>
then her face brightened up with sudden comprehension, and <lb/>
she said she would do it for me. </p>
<p>I thought to myself: She? why what can she know about <reg orig="photog-|raphy">photography</reg>? <lb/>
But it was a poor time to be thinking. When I looked <lb/>
around, she was moving on the procession with an axe! </p>
<p>Well, she certainly was a curious one, was Morgan le Fay. I have <lb/>
seen a good many kinds of women in my time, but she laid over them <lb/>
all, for variety. And how sharply characteristic of her this episode <lb/>
was. She had no more idea than a horse, of how to photograph a <reg orig="pro-|cession">procession</reg>; <lb/>
but being in doubt, it was just like her to try to do it with an <lb/>
axe.</p>

had stood by me most helpfully in the castle, <lb/>

than wisdoms double their size; so I thought she had earned a right <lb/>
to work her mill for a while, if she wanted to, and I felt not a pang <lb/>
when she started it up:</p>
<p>"Now turn we unto Sir Marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty <lb/>
winter of age southward&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Are you going to see if you can work up another half-stretch on <lb/>
the trail of the cowboys, Sandy?"</p>
<p>"Even so, fair my lord."</p>
<p>"Go ahead, then. I won't interrupt this time, if I can help it. <reg orig="Be-|gin">Begin</reg> <lb/>
over again; start fair, and shake out all your reefs, and I will load <lb/>
my pipe and give good attention."</p>
<p>"Now turn we unto Sir Marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty <lb/>
winter of age southward. And so they came into a deep forest, and by <lb/>
fortune they were nighted, and rode along in a deep way, and at the <lb/>
last they came into a courtelage where abode the duke of South <lb/>
Marches, and there they asked harbour. And on the morn the duke <lb/>
sent unto Sir Marhaus, and bad him make him ready. And so Sir <lb/>
Marhaus arose and armed him, and there was a mass sung afore him, <lb/>
and he brake his fast, and so mounted on horseback in the court of the <lb/>
castle, there they should do the battle. So there was the duke already <lb/>
on horseback, clean armed, and his six sons by him, and every each had <lb/>
a spear in his hand, and so they encountered, whereas the duke and his <lb/>
two sons brake their spears upon him, but Sir Marhaus held up his spear <lb/>
and touched none of them. Then came the four sons by couples, and <lb/>
two of them brake their spears, and so did the other two. And all this <lb/>
while Sir Marhaus touched them not. Then Sir Marhaus ran to the <lb/>
duke, and smote him with his spear that horse and man fell to the earth. <lb/>
And so he served his sons. And then Sir Marhaus alight down, and <lb/>
bad the duke yield him or else he would slay him. And then some of <lb/>
his sons recovered, and would have set upon Sir Marhaus. Then Sir <lb/>
Marhaus said to the duke, Cease thy sons, or else I will do the <reg orig="utter-|most">uttermost</reg> <lb/>

to you all. When the duke saw he might not escape the death, <lb/>
he cried to his sons, and charged them to yield them to Sir Marhaus. <lb/>
And they kneeled all down and put the pommels of their swords to the <lb/>
knight, and so he received them. And then they holp up their father, <lb/>
and so by their common assent promised unto Sir Marhaus never to be <lb/>
foes unto King Arthur, and thereupon at Whitsuntide after, to come <lb/>
he and his sons, and put them in the king's grace.<ref target="n3" n="2">*</ref>

<p>"Even so standeth the history, fair Sir Boss. Now ye shall wit that <lb/>
that very duke and his six sons are they whom but few days past you <lb/>
also did overcome and send to Arthur's court!"</p>
<p>"Why, Sandy, you can't mean it!"</p>
<p>"An I speak not sooth, let it be the worse for me."</p>
<p>"Well, well, well,&mdash;now who would ever have thought it? One <lb/>
whole duke and six dukelets; why, Sandy, it was an elegant haul. <lb/>
Knight-errantry is a most chuckle-headed trade, and it is tedious hard <lb/>
work, too, but I begin to see that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> money in it, after all, if you <lb/>
have luck. Not that I would ever engage in it as a business; for I <lb/>
wouldn't. No sound and legitimate business can be established on a <lb/>
basis of speculation. A successful whirl in the knight-errantry line&mdash; <lb/>
now what is it when you blow away the nonsense and come down to <lb/>
the cold facts? It's just a corner in pork, that's all, and you can't make <lb/>
anything else out of it. You're rich&mdash;yes,&mdash;suddenly rich&mdash;for about a <lb/>
day, maybe a week: then somebody corners the market on <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> and <lb/>
down goes your bucket-shop; ain't that so, Sandy?"</p>
<p>"Whethersoever it be that my mind miscarrieth, bewraying simple <lb/>
language in such sort that the words do seem to come endlong and <lb/>
overthwart&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There's no use in beating about the bush and trying to get around <lb/>
it that way, Sandy, it's <hi rend="italic">so,</hi> just as I say. I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> it's so. And, <reg orig="more-|over">moreover</reg>, <lb/>
when you come right down to the bed-rock, knight-errantry is <lb/>
<pb n="235" entity="DSSR_000002494_0246"/>
<hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than pork; for whatever happens, the pork's left, and so <reg orig="some-|body's">somebody's</reg> <lb/>
benefited, anyway; but when the market breaks, in a <reg orig="knight-|errantry">knight-errantry</reg> <lb/>
whirl, and every knight in the pool passes in his checks, what <lb/>
have you got for assets? Just a rubbish-pile of battered corpses and a <lb/>
barrel or two of busted hardware. Can you call <hi rend="italic">those</hi> assets? Give <lb/>
me pork, every time. Am I right?"</p>
<p>"Ah, peradventure my head being distraught by the manifold <reg orig="mat-|ters">matters</reg> <lb/>
whereunto the confusions of these but late adventured haps and <lb/>
fortunings whereby not I alone nor you alone, but every each of us, <lb/>
meseemeth&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, it's not your head, Sandy. Your head's all right, as far as it <lb/>
goes, but you don't know business; that's where the trouble is. It <reg orig="un-|fits">unfits</reg> <lb/>
you to argue about business, and you're wrong to be always trying. <lb/>
However, that aside, it was a good haul, anyway, and will breed a <lb/>
handsome crop of reputation in Arthur's court. And speaking of the <lb/>
cow-boys, what a curious country this is for women and men that <lb/>
never get old. Now there's Morgan le Fay, as fresh and young as a <lb/>
Vassar pullet, to all appearances, and here is this old duke of the South <lb/>
Marches still slashing away with sword and lance at his time of life, <lb/>
after raising such a family as he has raised. As I understand it, Sir <lb/>
Gawaine killed seven of his sons, and still he had six left for Sir <reg orig="Mar-|haus">Marhaus</reg> <lb/>
and me to take into camp. And then there was that damsel of <lb/>
sixty winter of age still excursioning around in her frosty bloom&mdash;&mdash; <lb/>
How old are you, Sandy?"</p>
<p>It was the first time I ever struck a still place in her. The mill had <lb/>
shut down for repairs, or something.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XX.<lb/> THE OGRE'S CASTLE.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Between</hi> six and nine we made ten miles, which <lb/>
was plenty for a horse carrying triple&mdash;man, woman, <lb/>
and armor; then we stopped for a long nooning, <lb/>
under some trees by a limpid brook.</p>
<p>Right so came bye and bye a knight riding; and <lb/>
as he drew near he made dolorous moan, and by the <lb/>
words of it I perceived that he was cursing and <lb/>
swearing; yet nevertheless was I glad of his <reg orig="com-|ing">coming</reg>, <lb/>
for that I saw he bore a bulletin-board whereon <lb/>
in letters all of shining gold was writ&mdash;</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">"Use Peterson's Prophylactic Tooth-Brush <lb/>
&mdash;All The Go."</hi></p>
<p>I was glad of his coming, for even by <lb/>
this token I knew him for knight of <lb/>
mine. It was Sir Madok de la <lb/>
Montaine, a burly great fellow <lb/>
whose chief distinction was that <lb/>
he had come within an ace of <lb/>
sending Sir <reg orig="Launce-|lot">Launcelot</reg> <lb/>
down over his <lb/>
horse-tail once. He <lb/>
was never long in a <lb/>
stranger's presence <lb/>
without finding some pretext or other to let out that great fact. But <lb/>
there was another fact of nearly the same size, which he never pushed <lb/>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f97" entity="DSSR_000002494_0250"/>-->
<pb n="240" entity="DSSR_000002494_0251"/>
upon anybody unasked, and yet never withheld when asked: that was, <lb/>
that the reason he didn't quite succeed was, that he was interrupted <lb/>
and sent down over horse-tail himself. This innocent vast lubber did <lb/>
not see any particular difference between the two facts. I liked him, <lb/>
for he was earnest in his work, and very valuable. And he was so fine <lb/>
to look at, with his broad mailed shoulders, and the grand leonine set <lb/>
of his plumed head, and his big shield with its quaint device of a <lb/>
gauntleted hand clutching a prophylactic tooth-brush, with motto: <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">"Try Noyoudont."</hi> This was a tooth-wash that I was introducing.</p>
<p>He was aweary, he said, and indeed he looked it; but he would not <lb/>
alight. He said he was after the stove-polish man; and with this he <lb/>
broke out cursing and swearing anew. The bulletin-boarder referred <lb/>
to was Sir Ossaise of Surluse, a brave knight, and of considerable <lb/>
celebrity on account of his having tried conclusions in a tournament, <lb/>
once, with no less a Mogul than Sir Gaheris himself&mdash;although not <lb/>
successfully. He was of a light and laughing disposition, and to him <lb/>
nothing in this world was serious. It was for this reason that I had <lb/>
chosen him to work up a stove-polish sentiment. There were no stoves <lb/>
yet, and so there could be nothing serious about stove-polish. All <lb/>
that the agent needed to do was to deftly and by degrees prepare the <lb/>
public for the great change, and have them established in <reg orig="predilec-|tions">predilections</reg> <lb/>
toward neatness against the time when the stove should appear <lb/>
upon the stage.</p>
<p>Sir Madok was very bitter, and brake out anew with cursings. He <lb/>
said he had cursed his soul to rags; and yet he would not get down <lb/>
from his horse, neither would he take any rest, or listen to any <reg orig="com-|fort">comfort</reg>, <lb/>
until he should have found Sir Ossaise and settled this account. <lb/>
It appeared, by what I could piece together of the unprofane fragments <lb/>
of his statement, that he had chanced upon Sir Ossaise at dawn of the <lb/>
morning, and been told that if he would make a short cut across the <lb/>
fields and swamps and broken hills and glades, he could head off a <lb/>
<pb n="241" entity="DSSR_000002494_0252"/>
company of travelers who would be rare customers for prophylactics <lb/>
and tooth-wash. With characteristic zeal Sir Madok had plunged <lb/>
away at once upon this quest, and after three hours of awful crosslot <lb/>
riding had overhauled his game. And behold, it was the five <reg orig="patri-|archs">patriarchs</reg> <lb/>
that had been released from the dungeons the evening before! <lb/>
Poor old creatures, it was all of twenty years since any one of them <lb/>
had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or <lb/>
remnant of a tooth.</p>
<p>"Blank-blank-blank him," said Sir Madok, "an I do not stove-polish <lb/>
him an I may find him, leave it to me; for never no knight that hight <lb/>
Ossaise or aught else may do me this disservice and bide on live, an I <lb/>
may find him, the which I have thereunto sworn a great oath this day."</p>
<p>And with these words, and others, he lightly took his spear and gat <lb/>
him thence. In the middle of the afternoon we came upon one of <lb/>
those very patriarchs ourselves, in the edge of a poor village. He <lb/>
was basking in the love of relatives and friends whom he had not seen <lb/>
for fifty years; and about him and caressing him were also descendants <lb/>
of his own body whom he had never seen at all till now; but to him <lb/>
these were all strangers, his memory was gone, his mind was stagnant. <lb/>
It seemed incredible that a man could outlast half a century shut up <lb/>
in a dark hole like a rat, but here were his old wife and some old <reg orig="com-|rades">comrades</reg> <lb/>
to testify to it. They could remember him as he was in the <lb/>
freshness and strength of his young manhood, when he kissed his child <lb/>
and delivered it to it's mother's hands and went away into that long <lb/>
oblivion. The people at the castle could not tell within half a <reg orig="genera-|tion">generation</reg> <lb/>
the length of time the man had been shut up there for his <reg orig="unre-|corded">unrecorded</reg> <lb/>
and forgotten offence; but this old wife knew; and so did her <lb/>
old child, who stood there among her married sons and daughters <reg orig="try-|ing">trying</reg> <lb/>
to realize a father who had been to her a name, a thought, a <reg orig="form-|less">formless</reg> <lb/>
image, a tradition, all her life, and now was suddenly concreted <lb/>
into actual flesh and blood and set before her face.</p>
<pb n="242" entity="DSSR_000002494_0253"/>
<p>It was a curious situation; yet it is not on that account that I have <lb/>
made room for it here, but on account of a thing which seemed to me <lb/>
still more curious. To-wit, that this dreadful matter brought from <lb/>
these down-trodden people no outburst of rage against their <reg orig="oppress-|ors">oppressors</reg>. <lb/>
They had been heritors and subjects of cruelty and outrage so <lb/>
long that nothing could have startled them but a kindness. Yes, here <lb/>
was a curious revelation indeed, of the depth to which this people had <lb/>
been sunk in slavery. Their entire being was reduced to a <reg orig="monoto-|nous">monotonous</reg> <lb/>
dead level of patience, resignation, dumb uncomplaining <reg orig="accept-|ance">acceptance</reg> <lb/>
of whatever might befal them in this life. Their very imagination <lb/>
was dead. When you can say that of a man, he has struck bottom, I <lb/>
reckon; there is no lower deep for him.</p>
<p>I rather wished I had gone some other road. This was not the sort <lb/>
of experience for a statesman to encounter who was planning out a <lb/>
peaceful revolution in his mind. For it could not help bringing up <lb/>
the un-get-aroundable fact that, all gentle cant and philosophising to <lb/>
the contrary notwithstanding, no people in the world ever did achieve <lb/>
their freedom by goody-goody talk and moral suasion: it being <reg orig="immu-|table">immutable</reg> <lb/>
law that all revolutions that will succeed, must <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> in blood, <lb/>
whatever may answer afterward. If history teaches anything, it teaches <lb/>
that. What this folk needed, then, was a Reign of Terror and a <reg orig="guil-|lotine">guillotine</reg>, <lb/>
and I was the wrong man for them.</p>
<p>Two days later, toward noon, Sandy began to show signs of <reg orig="excite-|ment">excitement</reg> <lb/>
and feverish expectancy. She said we were approaching the <lb/>
ogre's castle. I was surprised into an uncomfortable shock. The <lb/>
object of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind; this sudden <lb/>
resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing, for a <lb/>
moment, and roused up in me a smart interest. Sandy's excitement <lb/>
increased every moment; and so did mine, for that sort of thing is <lb/>
catching. My heart got to thumping. You can't reason with your <lb/>
heart; it has its own laws, and thumps about things which the intellect <lb/>
<pb n="243" entity="DSSR_000002494_0254"/>
scorns. Presently, when Sandy slid from the horse, motioned me to <lb/>
stop, and went creeping stealthily, with her head bent nearly to her <lb/>
knees, toward a row of bushes that bordered a declivity, the <reg orig="thump-|ings">thumpings</reg> <lb/>
grew stronger and quicker. And they kept it up while she was <lb/>
gaining her ambush and getting her glimpse over the declivity; and <lb/>
also while I was creeping to her side on my knees. Her eyes were <lb/>
burning, now, as she pointed with her finger, and said in a panting <lb/>
whisper&mdash;</p>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f98" entity="DSSR_000002494_0254">
  <head>SANDY WITH ROYALTY.</head>
 </figure>
<p>"The castle! The castle! Lo, where it looms!"</p>
<p>What a welcome disappointment I experienced! I said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Castle? It is nothing but a pig-sty; a <reg orig="pig-|sty">pigsty</reg> <lb/>
with a wattled fence around it."</p>
<p>She looked surprised and distressed.</p>
<p>The animation faded out of her <lb/>
face; and during many <reg orig="mo-|ments">moments</reg> <lb/>
she was lost in <lb/>
thought and silent. <lb/>
Then&mdash;</p>
<p>"It was not <reg orig="en-|chanted">enchanted</reg> <lb/>
aforetime," <lb/>
she said in a <lb/>
musing <reg orig="fash-|ion">fashion</reg>, <lb/>
as if to <lb/>
herself. "And <lb/>
<pb n="244" entity="DSSR_000002494_0255"/>
how strange is this marvel, and how awful&mdash;that to the one perception <lb/>
it is enchanted and dight in a base and shameful aspect; yet to the <lb/>
perception of the other it is not enchanted, hath suffered no change, <lb/>
but stands firm and stately still, girt with its moat and waving its <reg orig="ban-|ners">banners</reg> <lb/>
in the blue air from its towers. And God shield us, how it pricks <lb/>
the heart to see again these gracious captives, and the sorrow deepened <lb/>
in their sweet faces! We have tarried long, and are to blame."</p>
<p>I saw my cue. The castle was enchanted to <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> not to her. It <lb/>
would be wasted time to try to argue her out of her delusion, it couldn't <lb/>
be done; I must just humor it. So I said&mdash;</p>
<p>"This is a common case&mdash;the enchanting of a thing to one eye and <lb/>
leaving it in its proper form to another. You have heard of it before, <lb/>
Sandy, though you havn't happened to experience it. But no harm <lb/>
is done. In fact it is lucky the way it is. If these ladies were hogs to <lb/>
everybody and to themselves, it would be necessary to break the <reg orig="en-|chantment">enchantment</reg>, <lb/>
and that might be impossible if one failed to find out the <lb/>
particular process of the enchantment. And hazardous, too; for in <lb/>
attempting a disenchantment without the true key, you are liable to <lb/>
err, and turn your hogs into dogs, and the dogs into cats, the cats into <lb/>
rats, and so on, and end by reducing your materials to nothing, finally, <lb/>
or to an odorless gas which you can't follow&mdash;which of course amounts <lb/>
to the same thing. But here, by good luck, no one's eyes but mine are <lb/>
under the enchantment, and so it is of no consequence to dissolve it. <lb/>
These ladies remain ladies to you, and to themselves, and to everybody <lb/>
else; and at the same time they will suffer in no way from my delusion, <lb/>
for when I know that an ostensible hog is a lady, that is enough for <lb/>
me, I know how to treat her."</p>
<p>"Thanks, oh sweet my lord, thou talkest like angel. And I <lb/>
know that thou wilt deliver them, for that thou art minded to great <lb/>
deeds and art as strong a knight of your hands and as brave to will <lb/>
and to do, as any that is on live."</p>
<pb n="245" entity="DSSR_000002494_0256"/>
<p>"I will not leave a princess in the sty, Sandy. Are those three <lb/>
yonder that to my disordered eyes are starveling swineherds&mdash;"</p>
<p>"The ogres? Are <hi rend="italic">they</hi> changed also? It is most wonderful. Now <lb/>
am I fearful; for how canst thou strike with sure aim when five of their <lb/>
nine cubits of stature are to thee invisible? Ah, go warily, fair sir; <lb/>
this is a mightier emprise than I wend."</p>
<p>"You be easy, Sandy. All I need to know is, how <hi rend="italic">much</hi> of an ogre <lb/>
is invisible; then I know how to locate his vitals. Don't you be afraid, <lb/>
I will make short work of these bunco-steerers. Stay where you are."</p>
<p>I left Sandy kneeling there, corpse-faced but plucky and hopeful, <lb/>
and rode down to the pig-sty, and struck up a trade with the <reg orig="swine-|herds">swineherds</reg>. <lb/>
I won their gratitude by buying out all the hogs at the lump <lb/>
sum of sixteen pennies, which was rather above latest quotations. I was <lb/>
just in time; for the Church, the lord of the manor, and the rest of the <lb/>
tax gatherers would have been along next day and swept off pretty <lb/>
much all the stock, leaving the swineherds very short of hogs and <lb/>
Sandy out of princesses. But now the tax people could be paid in <lb/>
cash, and there would be a stake left besides. One of the men had ten <lb/>
children; and he said that last year when a priest came and of his ten <lb/>
pigs took the fattest one for tithes, the wife burst out upon him, and <lb/>
offered him a child and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Thou beast without bowels of mercy, why leave me my child, yet <lb/>
rob me of the wherewithal to feed it?"</p>
<p>How curious. The same thing had happened in the Wales of my <lb/>
day, under this same old Established Church, which was supposed by <lb/>
many to have changed its nature when it changed its disguise.</p>
<p>I sent the three men away, and then opened the sty gate and <reg orig="beck-|oned">beckoned</reg> <lb/>
Sandy to come&mdash;which she did; and not leisurely, but with the <lb/>
rush of a prairie-fire. And when I saw her fling herself upon those <lb/>
hogs, with tears of joy running down her cheeks, and strain them to <lb/>
her heart, and kiss them, and caress them, and call them reverently <lb/>
<pb n="246" entity="DSSR_000002494_0257"/>
by grand princely names, I was ashamed of her, ashamed of the <lb/>
human race. <lb/></p>
<p>We had to drive those hogs home&mdash;ten miles; and no ladies were <lb/>
ever more fickle-minded or contrary. They would stay in no road, no <lb/>
path; they broke out through the brush on all sides, and flowed away <lb/>
in all directions, over rocks, and hills, and the roughest places they <lb/>
could find. And they must not be struck, or roughly accosted; Sandy <lb/>

  <head>"WE GOT THE HOGS HOME."</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="247" entity="DSSR_000002494_0258"/>
could not bear to see them treated in ways unbecoming their rank. <lb/>
The troublesomest old sow of the lot had to be called my Lady, and <lb/>
your Highness, like the rest. It is annoying and difficult to scour <lb/>
around after hogs, in armor. There was one small countess, with an <lb/>
iron ring in her snout and hardly any hair on her back, that was the <lb/>
devil for perversity. She gave me a race of an hour, over all sorts of <lb/>
country, and then we were right where we had started from, having <lb/>
made not a rod of real progress. I seized her at last by the tail, and <lb/>
brought her along, squealing. When I overtook Sandy, she was <reg orig="hor-|rified">horrified</reg>, <lb/>
and said it was in the last degree indelicate to drag a countess <lb/>
by her train.</p>
<p>We got the hogs home just at dark&mdash;most of them. The princess <lb/>
Nerovens de Morganore was missing, and two of her ladies in waiting: <lb/>
namely, Miss Angela Bohun, and the Demoiselle Elaine Courtemains, <lb/>
the former of these two being a young black sow with a white star in <lb/>
her forehead, and the latter a brown one with thin legs and a slight <lb/>
limp in the forward shank on the starboard side&mdash;a couple of the <reg orig="try-|ingest">tryingest</reg> <lb/>
blisters to drive, that I ever saw. Also among the missing were <lb/>
several mere baronesses&mdash;and I wanted them to stay missing; but no, <lb/>
all that sausage-meat had to be found; so, servants were sent out with <lb/>
torches to scour the woods and hills to that end.</p>
<p>Of course the whole drove was housed in the house, and great <lb/>
guns!&mdash;well, I never saw anything like it. Nor ever heard anything <lb/>
like it. And never smelt anything like it. It was like an insurrection <lb/>
in a gasometer.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> I did get to bed at last I was <lb/>
unspeakably tired; the stretching out, <lb/>
and the relaxing of the long-tense <lb/>
muscles, how luxurious, how <reg orig="deli-|cious">delicious</reg>! <lb/>
but that was as far as I could <lb/>
get&mdash;sleep was out of the question, for <lb/>
the present. The ripping and tearing <lb/>
and squealing of the nobility up and <lb/>
down the halls and corridors was <reg orig="pan-|demonium">pandemonium</reg> <lb/>
come again, and kept me <lb/>
broad awake. Being awake, my <lb/>
thoughts were busy, of course; and <lb/>
mainly they busied themselves <lb/>
with Sandy's curious delusion. <lb/>
Here she was, as sane a person <lb/>
as the kingdom could produce; <lb/>
and yet, from my point of view <lb/>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f101" entity="DSSR_000002494_0262"/>-->
<pb n="252" entity="DSSR_000002494_0263"/>
she was acting like a crazy woman. My land, the power of training! of <lb/>
influence! of education! It can bring a body up to believe anything. I <lb/>
had to put myself in Sandy's place to realize that she was not a lunatic. <lb/>
Yes, and put her in mine, to demonstrate how easy it is to seem a <reg orig="lun-|atic">lunatic</reg> <lb/>
to a person who has not been taught as you have been taught. If I <lb/>
had told Sandy I had seen a wagon, uninfluenced by enchantment, spin <lb/>
along fifty miles an hour; had seen a man, unequipped with magic <reg orig="pow-|ers">powers</reg>, <lb/>
get into a basket and soar out of sight among the clouds; and had <lb/>
listened, without any necromancer's help, to the conversation of a <reg orig="per-|son">person</reg> <lb/>
who was several hundred miles away, Sandy would not merely have <lb/>
supposed me to be crazy, she would have thought she knew it. <reg orig="Every-|body">Everybody</reg> <lb/>
around her believed in enchantments; nobody had any doubts; <lb/>
to doubt that a castle could be turned into a sty, and its occupants into <lb/>
hogs, would have been the same as my doubting, among Connecticut <lb/>
people, the actuality of the telephone and its wonders,&mdash;and in both <lb/>
cases would be absolute proof of a diseased mind, an unsettled reason. <lb/>
Yes, Sandy was sane; that must be admitted. If I also would be sane <lb/>
&mdash;to Sandy&mdash;I must keep my superstitions about unenchanted and <reg orig="un-|miraculous">unmiraculous</reg> <lb/>
locomotives, balloons and telephones, to myself. Also, I <lb/>
believed that the world was not flat, and hadn't pillars under it to <reg orig="sup-|port">support</reg> <lb/>
it, nor a canopy over it to turn off a universe of water that <reg orig="occu-|pied">occupied</reg> <lb/>
all space above: but as I was the only person in the kingdom <lb/>
afflicted with such impious and criminal opinions, I recognized that it <lb/>
would be good wisdom to keep quiet about this matter, too, if I did not <lb/>
wish to be suddenly shunned and forsaken by everybody as a madman. <lb/></p>
<p>The next morning Sandy assembled the swine in the dining room <lb/>
and gave them their breakfast, waiting upon them personally and <lb/>
manifesting in every way the deep reverence which the natives of her <lb/>
island, ancient and modern, have always felt for rank, let its outward <lb/>
casket and the mental and moral contents be what they may. I could <lb/>
have eaten with the hogs if I had had birth approaching my lofty <lb/>
<pb n="253" entity="DSSR_000002494_0264"/>
official rank; but I hadn't, and so accepted the unavoidable slight and <lb/>
made no complaint. Sandy and I had our breakfast at the second <lb/>
table. The family were not at home. I said:</p>
<p>"How many are in the family, Sandy, and where do they keep <lb/>
themselves?"</p>
<p>"Family?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Which family, good my lord?"</p>
<p>"Why, this family; your own family."</p>
<p>"Sooth to say, I understand you not. I have no family."</p>
<p>"No family? Why, Sandy, isn't this your home?"</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f102" entity="DSSR_000002494_0264">
  <head>SANDY AND THE BOSS AT THE SECOND TABLE.</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="254" entity="DSSR_000002494_0265"/>
<p>"Now how indeed might that be? I have no home."</p>
<p>"Well, then, whose house is this?"</p>
<p>"Ah, wit you well I would tell you an I knew myself."</p>
<p>"Come&mdash;you don't even know these people? Then who invited us <lb/>
here?"</p>
<p>"None invited us. We but came; that is all."</p>
<p>"Why, woman, this is a most extraordinary performance. The <lb/>
effrontery of it is beyond admiration. We blandly march into a man's <lb/>
house, and cram it full of the only really valuable nobility the sun has <lb/>
yet discovered in the earth, and then it turns out that we don't even <lb/>
know the man's name. How did you ever venture to take this <reg orig="extrav-|agant">extravagant</reg> <lb/>
liberty? I supposed, of course, it was your home. What will the <lb/>
man say?"</p>
<p>"What will he say? Forsooth what can he say but give thanks?"</p>
<p>"Thanks for what?"</p>
<p>Her face was filled with a puzzled surprise:</p>
<p>"Verily, thou troublest mine understanding with strange words. Do <lb/>
ye dream that one of his estate is like to have the honor twice in his <lb/>
life to entertain company such as we have brought to grace his house <lb/>
withal?"</p>
<p>"Well, no&mdash;when you come to that. No, it's an even bet that this <lb/>
is the first time he has had a treat like this."</p>
<p>"Then let him be thankful, and manifest the same by grateful <lb/>
speech and due humility; he were a dog, else, and the heir and <reg orig="ances-|tor">ancestor</reg> <lb/>
of dogs."</p>
<p>To my mind, the situation was uncomfortable. It might become <lb/>
more so. It might be a good idea to muster the hogs and move on. <lb/>
So I said: </p>
<p>"The day is wasting, Sandy. It is time to get the nobility together <lb/>
and be moving."</p>
<p>"Wherefore, fair sir and Boss?"</p>
<pb n="255" entity="DSSR_000002494_0266"/>
<p>"We want to take them to their home, don't we?"</p>
<p>"La, but list to him! They be of all the regions of the earth! Each <lb/>
must hie to her own home; wend you we might do all these journeys <lb/>
in one so brief life as He hath appointed that created life, and thereto <lb/>
death likewise with help of Adam, who by sin done through persuasion <lb/>
of his helpmeet, she being wrought upon and bewrayed by the <reg orig="beguile-|ments">beguilements</reg> <lb/>
of the great enemy of man, that serpent hight Satan, aforetime <lb/>
consecrated and set apart unto that evil work by overmastering spite <lb/>
and envy begotten in his heart through fell ambitions that did blight <lb/>
and mildew a nature erst so white and pure whenso it hove with the <lb/>
shining multitudes its brethren-born in glade and shade of that fair <lb/>
heaven wherein all such as native be to that rich estate and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Great Scott!"</p>
<p>"My lord?"</p>
<p>"Well, you know we havn't got time for this sort of thing. Don't <lb/>
you see, we could distribute these people around the earth in less time <lb/>
than it is going to take you to explain that we can't. We mustn't talk <lb/>
now, we must act. You want to be careful; you mustn't let your mill <lb/>
get the start of you that way, at a time like this. To business, now&mdash; <lb/>
and sharp's the word. Who is to take the aristocracy home?"</p>
<p>"Even their friends. These will come for them from the far parts of <lb/>
the earth."</p>
<p>This was lightning from a clear sky, for unexpectedness; and the <lb/>
relief of it was like pardon to a prisoner. She would remain to deliver <lb/>
the goods, of course.</p>
<p>"Well, then, Sandy, as our enterprise is handsomely and <reg orig="success-|fully">successfully</reg> <lb/>
ended, I will go home and report; and if ever another one&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I also am ready; I will go with thee."</p>
<p>This was recalling the pardon.</p>
<p>"How? You will go with me? Why should you?</p>
<p>"Will I be traitor to my knight, dost think? That were dishonor. <lb/>
<pb n="256" entity="DSSR_000002494_0267"/>
I may not part from thee until in knightly encounter in the field some <lb/>
overmatching champion shall fairly win and fairly wear me. I were to <lb/>
blame an I thought that that might ever hap."</p>
<p>"Elected for the long term," I sighed to myself. "I may as well <lb/>
make the best of it." So then I spoke up and said:</p>
<p>"All right; let us make a start."</p>
<p>While she was gone to cry her farewells over the pork, I gave that <lb/>
whole peerage away to the servants. And I asked them to take a <lb/>
duster and dust around a little where the nobilities had mainly lodged <lb/>
and promenaded, but they considered that that would be hardly worth <lb/>
while, and would moreover be a rather grave departure from custom, <lb/>
and therefore likely to make talk. A departure from custom&mdash;that <reg orig="set-|tled">settled</reg> <lb/>
it; it was a nation capable of committing any crime but that. The <lb/>
servants said they would follow the fashion, a fashion grown sacred <lb/>
through immemorial observance: they would scatter fresh rushes in all <lb/>
the rooms and halls, and then the evidence of the aristocratic visitation <lb/>
would be no longer visible. It was a kind of satire on Nature; it was <lb/>
the scientific method, the geologic method; it deposited the history of <lb/>
the family in a stratified record; and the antiquary could dig through it <lb/>
and tell by the remains of each period what changes of diet the family <lb/>
had introduced successively for a hundred years.</p>
<p>The first thing we struck that day was a procession of pilgrims. It <lb/>
was not going our way, but we joined it nevertheless; for it was hourly <lb/>
being borne in upon me, now, that if I would govern this country wisely, <lb/>
I must be posted in the details of its life, and not at second hand but by <lb/>
personal observation and scrutiny.</p>
<p>This company of pilgrims resembled Chaucer's in this: that it had <lb/>
in it a sample of about all the upper occupations and professions the <lb/>
country could show, and a corresponding variety of costume. There <lb/>
were young men and old men, young women and old women, lively <lb/>
folk and grave folk. They rode upon mules and horses, and there was <lb/>
<pb n="257" entity="DSSR_000002494_0268"/>
not a side-saddle in the party; for this specialty was to remain unknown <lb/>
in England for nine hundred years yet. </p>
<p>It was a pleasant, friendly, sociable herd; pious, happy, merry, and <lb/>
full of unconscious coarsenesses and innocent indecencies. What they <lb/>
regarded as the merry tale went the continual round and caused no more <lb/>
embarrassment than it would have caused in the best English society <lb/>
twelve centuries later. Practical jokes worthy of the English wits of <lb/>
the first quarter of the far-off nineteenth century were sprung here and <lb/>
there and yonder along the line, and compelled the delightedest <reg orig="ap-|plause">applause</reg>; <lb/>
and sometimes when a bright remark was made at one end of <lb/>
the procession and started on its travels toward the other, you could <lb/>
note its progress all the way by the sparkling spray of laughter it threw <lb/>
off from its bows as it plowed along; and also by the blushes of the <lb/>
mules in its wake.</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f103" entity="DSSR_000002494_0268">
  <head>"IT HAD IN IT A SAMPLE OF ABOUT ALL THE UPPER OCCUPATIONS AND PROFESSIONS."</head>
 </figure>
<p>Sandy knew the goal and purpose of this pilgrimage and she posted <lb/>
me. She said:</p>
<p>"They journey to the Valley of Holiness, for to be blessed of the <lb/>
godly hermits and drink of the miraculous waters and be cleansed from <lb/>
sin."</p>
<p>"Where is this watering place?"</p>
<pb n="258" entity="DSSR_000002494_0269"/>
<p>"It lieth a two day journey hence, by the borders of the land that <lb/>
hight the Cuckoo Kingdom."</p>
<p>"Tell me about it. Is it a celebrated place?"</p>
<p>"Oh, of a truth, yes. There be none more so. Of old time there <lb/>
lived there an abbot and his monks. Belike were none in the world <lb/>
more holy than these; for they gave themselves to study of pious <lb/>
books, and spoke not the one to the other, or indeed to any, and ate <lb/>
decayed herbs and naught thereto, and slept hard, and prayed much, <lb/>
and washed never; also they wore the same garment until it fell from <lb/>
their bodies through age and decay. Right so came they to be known <lb/>
of all the world by reason of these holy austerities, and visited by rich <lb/>
and poor, and reverenced."</p>
<p>"Proceed."</p>
<p>"But always there was lack of water there. Whereas, upon a <lb/>
time, the holy abbot prayed, and for answer a great stream of clear <lb/>
water burst forth by miracle in a desert place. Now were the fickle <lb/>
monks tempted of the Fiend, and they wrought with their abbot <lb/>
unceasingly by beggings and beseechings that he would construct a <lb/>
bath; and when he was become aweary and might not resist more, he <lb/>
said have ye your will, then, and granted that they asked. Now mark <lb/>
thou what 'tis to forsake the ways of purity the which He loveth, and <lb/>
wanton with such as be worldly and an offense. These monks did <lb/>
enter into the bath and come thence washed as white as snow; and <lb/>
lo, in that moment His sign appeared, in miraculous rebuke! for His <lb/>
insulted waters ceased to flow, and utterly vanished away."</p>
<p>"They fared mildly, Sandy, considering how that kind of crime is <lb/>
regarded in this country."</p>
<p>"Belike; but it was their first sin; and they had been of perfect <lb/>
life for long, and differing in naught from the angels. Prayers, <lb/>
tears, torturings of the flesh, all was vain to beguile that water to <lb/>
flow again. Even processions; even burnt offerings; even votive <lb/>
<pb n="259" entity="DSSR_000002494_0270"/>
candles to the Virgin, did fail every each of them; and all in the land <lb/>
did marvel."</p>
<p>"How odd to find that even this industry has its financial panics, <lb/>
and at times sees its assignats and greenbacks languish to zero, and <lb/>
everything come to a standstill. Go on, Sandy."</p>
<p>"And so upon a time, after year and day, the good abbot made <lb/>
humble surrender and destroyed the bath. And behold, His anger <lb/>
was in that moment appeased, and the waters gushed richly forth <lb/>
again, and even unto this day they have not ceased to flow in that <lb/>
generous measure."</p>
<p>"Then I take it nobody has washed since."</p>
<p>"He that would essay it could have his halter free; yea, and swiftly <lb/>
would he need it, too."</p>
<p>"The community has prospered since?"</p>
<p>"Even from that very day. The fame of the miracle went abroad <lb/>
into all lands. From every land came monks to join; they came even <lb/>
as the fishes come, in shoals; and the monastery added building to <lb/>
building, and yet others to these, and so spread wide its arms and took <lb/>
them in. And nuns came, also; and more again, and yet more; and built <lb/>
over against the monastery on the yon side of the vale, and added <reg orig="build-|ing">building</reg> <lb/>
to building, until mighty was that nunnery. And these were <reg orig="friend-|ly">friendly</reg> <lb/>
unto those, and they joined their loving labors together, and together <lb/>
they built a fair great foundling asylum midway of the valley between."</p>
<p>"You spoke of some hermits, Sandy."</p>
<p>"These have gathered there from the ends of the earth. A hermit <lb/>
thriveth best where there be multitudes of pilgrims. Ye shall not find <lb/>
no hermit of no sort wanting. If any shall mention a hermit of a <lb/>
kind he thinketh new and not to be found but in some far strange <lb/>
land, let him but scratch among the holes and caves and swamps that <lb/>
line that Valley of Holiness, and whatsoever be his breed, it skills not, <lb/>
he shall find a sample of it there."</p>
<pb n="260" entity="DSSR_000002494_0271"/>
<p>I closed up alongside of a burly fellow with a <lb/>
fat good-humored face, purposing to make myself <lb/>
agreeable and pick up some further <lb/>
crumbs of fact; but I had hardly more <lb/>
than scraped acquaintance with him <lb/>
when he began eagerly and awkwardly <lb/>
to lead up, in the immemorial <lb/>
way, to that same old anecdote <lb/>
&mdash;the one Sir Dinadan told me, <lb/>
what time I got into trouble <lb/>
with Sir Sagramore and <lb/>
was challenged of him <lb/>
on account of it. I <reg orig="ex-|cused">excused</reg> <lb/>
myself and <reg orig="drop-|ped">dropped</reg> <lb/>
to the rear of the <lb/>
procession, sad at heart, <lb/>
willing to go hence from this <lb/>

this brief day of broken rest, of <lb/>
cloud and storm, of weary <lb/>
struggle and monotonous <reg orig="de-|feat">defeat</reg>; <lb/>
and yet shrinking from <lb/>
the change, as remembering <lb/>

  <head>A BAND OF SLAVES.</head>
 </figure>
<p>Early in the afternoon we <lb/>
overtook another <reg orig="proces-|sion">procession</reg> <lb/>
of pilgrims; but in this one was no merriment, no jokes, no laughter, <lb/>
no playful ways, nor any happy giddiness, whether of youth or age. Yet <lb/>
both were here, both age and youth; gray old men and women, strong <lb/>
<pb n="261" entity="DSSR_000002494_0272"/>
men and women of middle age, young husbands, young wives, little boys <lb/>
and girls, and three babies at the breast. Even the children were <reg orig="smile-|less">smileless</reg>; <lb/>
there was not a face among all these half a hundred people but <lb/>
was cast down, and bore that set expression of hopelessness which is <lb/>
bred of long and hard trials and old acquaintance with despair. They <lb/>
were slaves. Chains led from their fettered feet and their manacled <lb/>
hands to a sole-leather belt about their waists; and all except the <lb/>
children were also linked together in a file, six feet apart, by a single <lb/>
chain which led from collar to collar all down the line. They were on <lb/>
foot, and had tramped three hundred miles in eighteen days, upon the <lb/>
cheapest odds and ends of food, and stingy rations of that. They had <lb/>
slept in these chains every night, bundled together like swine. They <lb/>
had upon their bodies some poor rags, but they could not be said to be <lb/>
clothed. Their irons had chafed the skin from their ankles and made <lb/>
sores which were ulcerated and wormy. Their naked feet were torn, <lb/>
and none walked without a limp. Originally there had been a <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
of these unfortunates, but about half had been sold on the trip. <lb/>
The trader in charge of them rode a horse and carried a whip with a <lb/>
short handle and a long heavy lash divided into several knotted tails <lb/>
at the end. With this whip he cut the shoulders of any that tottered <lb/>
from weariness and pain, and straitened them up. He did not speak; <lb/>
the whip conveyed his desire without that. None of these poor <reg orig="crea-|tures">creatures</reg> <lb/>
looked up as we rode along by; they showed no consciousness <lb/>
of our presence. And they made no sound but one; that was the dull <lb/>
and awful clank of their chains from end to end of the long file, as <lb/>
forty-three burdened feet rose and fell in unison. The file moved in <lb/>
a cloud of its own making.</p>
<p>All these faces were gray with a coating of dust. One has seen the <lb/>
like of this coating upon furniture in unoccupied houses, and has <reg orig="writ-|ten">written</reg> <lb/>
his idle thought in it with his finger. I was reminded of this when <lb/>
I noticed the faces of some of those women, young mothers carrying <lb/>
<pb n="262" entity="DSSR_000002494_0273"/>
babes that were near to death and freedom, how a something in their <lb/>
hearts was written in the dust upon their faces, plain to see, and lord <lb/>
how plain to read! for it was the track of tears. One of these young <lb/>
mothers was but a girl, and it hurt me to the heart to read that writing, <lb/>
and reflect that it was come up out of the breast of such a child, a breast <lb/>
that ought not to know trouble yet, but only the gladness of the <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
of life; and no doubt&mdash;</p>
<p>She reeled just then, giddy with fatigue, and down came the lash <lb/>
and flicked a flake of skin from her naked shoulder. It stung me as if <lb/>
I had been hit instead. The master halted the file and jumped from <lb/>
his horse. He stormed and swore at this girl, and said she had made <lb/>
annoyance enough with her laziness, and as this was the last chance <lb/>
he should have, he would settle the account now. She dropped on her <lb/>
knees and put up her hands and began to beg and cry and implore, in <lb/>
a passion of terror, but the master gave no attention. He snatched <lb/>
the child from her, and then made the men-slaves who were chained <lb/>
before and behind her throw her on the ground and hold her there <lb/>
and expose her body; and then he laid on with his lash like a madman <lb/>
till her back was flayed, she shrieking and struggling the while, <reg orig="pit-|eously">piteously</reg>. <lb/>
One of the men who was holding her turned away his face, <lb/>
and for this humanity he was reviled and flogged.</p>
<p>All our pilgrims looked on and commented&mdash;on the expert way <lb/>
in which the whip was handled. They were too much hardened by <lb/>
lifelong every-day familiarity with slavery to notice that there was <lb/>
anything else in the exhibition that invited comment. This was what <lb/>
slavery could do, in the way of ossifying what one may call the <reg orig="supe-|rior">superior</reg> <lb/>
lobe of human feeling; for these pilgrims were kindhearted people, <lb/>
and they would not have allowed that man to treat a horse like that.</p>
<p>I wanted to stop the whole thing and set the slaves free, but that <lb/>
would not do. I must not interfere too much and get myself a name <lb/>
for riding over the country's laws and the citizen's rights roughshod. <lb/>
<pb n="263" entity="DSSR_000002494_0274"/>
If I lived and prospered I would be the death of slavery, that I was <lb/>
resolved upon; but I would try to fix it so that when I became its <reg orig="exe-|cutioner">executioner</reg> <lb/>
it should be by command of the nation.</p>
<p>Just here was the wayside shop of a smith; and now arrived a landed <lb/>
proprietor who had bought this girl a few miles back, deliverable here <lb/>
where her irons could be taken off. They were removed; then there <lb/>
was a squabble between the gentleman and the dealer as to which <lb/>
should pay the blacksmith. The moment the girl was delivered from <lb/>
her irons, she flung herself, all tears and frantic sobbings, into the arms <lb/>
of the slave who had turned away his face when she was whipped. He <lb/>
strained her to his breast, and smothered her face and the child's with <lb/>
kisses, and washed them with the rain of his tears. I suspected. I <lb/>
inquired. Yes, I was right: it was husband and wife. They had to be <lb/>
torn apart by force; the girl had to be dragged away, and she <reg orig="strug-|gled">struggled</reg> <lb/>
and fought and shrieked like one gone mad till a turn of the road <lb/>
hid her from sight; and even after that, we could still make out the <lb/>
fading plaint of those receding shrieks. And the husband and father, <lb/>
with his wife and child gone, never to be seen by him again in life?&mdash; <lb/>
well, the look of him one might not bear at all, and so I turned away; <lb/>
but I knew I should never get his picture out of my mind again, and <lb/>
there it is to this day, to wring my heart-strings whenever I think of it.</p>
<p>We put up at the inn in a village just at nightfall, and when I rose <lb/>
next morning and looked abroad, I was ware where a knight came <lb/>
riding in the golden glory of the new day, and recognized him for <lb/>
knight of mine&mdash;Sir Ozana le Cure Hardy. He was in the gentlemen's <lb/>
furnishing line, and his missionarying specialty was plug hats. He <lb/>
was clothed all in steel, in the beautifulest armor of the time&mdash;up to <lb/>
where his helmet ought to have been; but he hadn't any helmet, he <lb/>
wore a shiny stove-pipe hat, and was as ridiculous a spectacle as one <lb/>
might want to see. It was another of my surreptitious schemes for <lb/>
extinguishing knighthood by making it grotesque and absurd. Sir <lb/>
<pb n="264" entity="DSSR_000002494_0275"/>
Ozana's saddle was hung about with leather hat-boxes, and every time <lb/>
he overcame a wandering knight he swore him into my service and <lb/>
fitted him with a plug and made him wear it. I dressed and ran down <lb/>
to welcome Sir Ozana and get his news.</p>
<p>"How is trade?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Ye will note that I have but these four left; yet were they sixteen <lb/>
whenas I got me from Camelot."</p>
<p>"Why, you have certainly done nobly, Sir Ozana. Where have <lb/>
you been foraging of late?"</p>
<p>"I am but now come from the Valley of Holiness, please you sir."</p>
<p>"I am pointed for that place myself. Is there anything stirring in <lb/>
the monkery, more than common?"</p>
<p>"By the mass ye may not question it! . . . Give him good feed, <lb/>
boy, and stint it not, an thou valuest thy crown; so get ye lightly to <lb/>
the stable and do even as I bid. . . . . . . Sir, it is parlous news <lb/>
I bring, and&mdash;be these pilgrims? Then ye may not do better, good <lb/>
folk, than gather and hear the tale I have to tell, sith it concerneth <lb/>
you, forasmuch as ye go to find that ye will not find, and seek that ye <lb/>
will seek in vain, my life being hostage for my word, and my word and <lb/>
message being these, namely: That a hap has happened whereof the <lb/>
like has not been seen no more but once this two hundred years, which <lb/>
was the first and last time that that said misfortune strake the holy <lb/>
valley in that form by commandment of the Most High whereto by <lb/>
reasons just and causes thereunto contributing, wherein the matter&mdash;"</p>
<p>"The miraculous fount hath ceased to flow!" This shout burst <lb/>
from twenty pilgrim mouths at once.</p>
<p>"Ye say well, good people. I was verging to it, even when ye <lb/>
spake."</p>
<p>"Has somebody been washing again?"</p>
<p>"Nay, it is suspected, but none believe it. It is thought to be some <lb/>
other sin, but none wit what."</p>
<pb n="265" entity="DSSR_000002494_0276"/>
<p>"How are they feeling about the calamity?"</p>
<p>"None may describe it in words. The fount is these nine days dry. <lb/>
The prayers that did begin then, and the lamentations in sackcloth and <lb/>
ashes, and the holy processions, none of these have ceased nor night <lb/>
nor day; and so the monks and the nuns and the foundlings be all <lb/>
exhausted, and do hang up prayers writ upon parchment, sith that no <lb/>
strength is left in man to lift up voice. And at last they sent for thee, <lb/>
Sir Boss, to try magic and enchantment; and if you could not come, <lb/>
then was the messenger to fetch Merlin, and he is there these three <lb/>
days, now, and saith he will fetch that water though he burst the globe <lb/>
and wreck its kingdoms to accomplish it; and right bravely doth he <lb/>
work his magic and call upon his hellions to hie them hither and help, <lb/>
but not a whiff of moisture hath he started yet, even so much as might <lb/>
qualify as mist upon a copper mirror an ye count not the barrel of sweat <lb/>
he sweateth betwixt sun and sun over the dire labors of his task; and <lb/>
if ye&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>Breakfast was ready. As soon as it was over I showed to Sir Ozana <lb/>
these words which I had written on the inside of his hat: <hi rend="italic">"Chemical <lb/>
Department, Laboratory extension, Section G. Pxxp. Send two of first <lb/>
size, two of No. 3, and six of No. 4, together with the proper <reg orig="comple-|mentary">complementary</reg> <lb/>
details&mdash;and two of my trained assistants."</hi> And I said:</p>
<p>"Now get you to Camelot as fast as you can fly, brave knight, and <lb/>
show the writing to Clarence, and tell him to have these required <reg orig="mat-|ters">matters</reg> <lb/>
in the Valley of Holiness with all possible dispatch."</p>
<p>"I will well, Sir Boss," and he was off.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> pilgrims were human beings. <reg orig="Other-|wise">Otherwise</reg> <lb/>
they would have acted differently. <lb/>
They had come a long and difficult <reg orig="jour-|ney">journey</reg>, <lb/>
and now when the journey was <lb/>
nearly finished, and they learned that <lb/>
the main thing they had come <lb/>
for had ceased to exist, they <lb/>
didn't do as horses or cats or <lb/>
angle-worms would probably <lb/>

as forty times as anxious now <lb/>
to see the place where it had <lb/>
used to be. There is no <reg orig="ac-|counting">accounting</reg> <lb/>
for human beings.</p>
<p>We made good time; and a <lb/>
couple of hours before sunset <lb/>
we stood upon the high <reg orig="con-|fines">confines</reg> <lb/>
of the Valley of Holiness <lb/>
and our eyes swept it from end to end and noted its features. That <lb/>
is, its large features. These were the three masses of buildings. They <lb/>

<pb n="270" entity="DSSR_000002494_0281"/>
were distant and isolated temporalities shrunken to toy constructions <lb/>
in the lonely waste of what seemed a desert&mdash;and was. Such a scene <lb/>
is always mournful, it is so impressively still, and looks so steeped in <lb/>
death. But there was a sound here which interrupted the stillness only <lb/>
to add to its mournfulness; this was the faint far sound of tolling bells <lb/>
which floated fitfully to us on the passing breeze, and so faintly, so softly, <lb/>
that we hardly knew whether we heard it with our ears or with our spirits.</p>
<p>We reached the monastery before dark, and there the males were <lb/>
given lodging, but the women were sent over to the nunnery. The <lb/>
bells were close at hand, now, and their solemn booming smote upon <lb/>
the ear like a message of doom. A superstitious despair possessed the <lb/>
heart of every monk and published itself in his ghastly face. <reg orig="Every-|where">Everywhere</reg>, <lb/>
these black-robed, soft-sandled, tallow-visaged spectres <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg>, <lb/>
flitted about and disappeared, noiseless as the creatures of a <lb/>
troubled dream, and as uncanny.</p>
<p>The old abbot's joy to see me was pathetic. Even to tears; but <lb/>
he did the shedding himself. He said:</p>
<p>"Delay not, son, but get to thy saving work. An we bring not the <lb/>
water back again, and soon, we are ruined, and the good work of two <lb/>
hundred years must end. And see thou do it with enchantments that <lb/>
be holy, for the Church will not endure that work in her cause be done <lb/>
by devil's magic."</p>
<p>"When I work, Father, be sure there will be no devil's work <reg orig="con-|nected">connected</reg> <lb/>
with it. I shall use no arts that come of the devil, and no <lb/>
elements not created by the hand of God. But is Merlin working <lb/>
strictly on pious lines?"</p>
<p>"Ah, he said he would, my son, he said he would, and took oath <lb/>
to make his promise good."</p>
<p>"Well, in that case, let him proceed."</p>
<p>"But surely you will not sit idle by, but help?"</p>
<p>"It will not answer to mix methods, Father; neither would it be <lb/>
<pb n="271" entity="DSSR_000002494_0282"/>
professional courtesy. Two of a trade must not under-bid each other. <lb/>
We might as well cut rates and be done with it; it would arrive at that <lb/>
in the end. Merlin has the contract; no other magician can touch it <lb/>
till he throws it up."</p>
<p>"But I will take it from him; it is a terrible emergency and the act <lb/>
is thereby justified. And if it were not so, who will give law to the <lb/>
Church? The Church giveth law to all; and what she wills to do, that <lb/>
she may do, hurt whom it may. I will take it from him; you shall <reg orig="be-|gin">begin</reg> <lb/>
upon the moment."</p>
<p>"It may not be, Father. No doubt, as you say, where power is <lb/>
supreme, one can do as one likes and suffer no injury; but we poor <lb/>
magicians are not so situated. Merlin is a very good magician in a <lb/>
small way, and has quite a neat provincial reputation. He is struggling <lb/>
along, doing the best he can, and it would not be etiquette for me to <lb/>
take his job until he himself abandons it."</p>
<p>The abbot's face lighted.</p>
<p>"Ah, that is simple. There are ways to persuade him to <reg orig="aban-|don">abandon</reg> <lb/>
it."</p>
<p>"No-no, Father, it skills not, as these people say. If he were <reg orig="per-|suaded">persuaded</reg> <lb/>
against his will, he would load that well with a malicious <lb/>
enchantment which would balk me until I found out its secret. It <lb/>
might take a month. I could set up a little enchantment of mine <lb/>
which I call the telephone, and he could not find out its secret in a <lb/>
hundred years. Yes, you perceive, he might block me for a month. <lb/>
Would you like to risk a month in a dry time like this?"</p>
<p>"A month! The mere thought of it maketh me to shudder. Have <lb/>
it thy way, my son. But my heart is heavy with this disappointment. <lb/>
Leave me, and let me wear my spirit with weariness and waiting, even <lb/>
as I have done these ten long days, counterfeiting thus the thing that <lb/>
is called rest, the prone body making outward sign of repose where <lb/>
inwardly is none."</p>
<pb n="272" entity="DSSR_000002494_0283"/>
<p>Of course it would have been best, all round, for Merlin to waive <lb/>
etiquette and quit and call it half a day, since he would never be able <lb/>
to start that water, for he was a true magician of the time: which is to <lb/>
say, the big miracles, the ones that gave him his reputation, always <lb/>
had the luck to be performed when nobody but Merlin was present; he <lb/>
couldn't start this well with all this crowd around to see; a crowd was <lb/>
as bad for a magician's miracle in that day as it was for a spiritualist's <lb/>
miracle in mine: there was sure to be some skeptic on hand to turn up <lb/>
the gas at the crucial moment and spoil everything. But I did not <lb/>
want Merlin to retire from the job until I was ready to take hold of it <lb/>
effectively myself; and I could not do that until I got my things from <lb/>
Camelot, and that would take two or three days.</p>
<p>My presence gave the monks hope, and cheered them up a good <lb/>
deal; insomuch that they ate a square meal that night for the first time <lb/>
in ten days. As soon as their stomachs had been properly reinforced <lb/>
with food, their spirits began to rise fast; when the mead began to go <lb/>
round they rose faster. By the time everybody was half-seas over, the <lb/>
holy community was in good shape to make a night of it; so we stayed <lb/>
by the board and put it through on that line. Matters got to be very <lb/>
jolly. Good old questionable stories were told that made the tears <lb/>
run down and cavernous mouths stand wide and the round bellies shake <lb/>
with laughter; and questionable songs were bellowed out in a mighty <lb/>
chorus that drowned the boom of the tolling bells.</p>
<p>At last I ventured a story myself; and vast was the success of it. <lb/>
Not right off, of course, for the native of those islands does not as <lb/>
a rule dissolve upon the early applications of a humorous thing; but <lb/>
the fifth time I told it, they began to crack, in places; the eighth <lb/>
time I told it, they began to crumble; at the twelfth repetition they <lb/>
fell apart in chunks; and at the fifteenth they disintegrated, and I got <lb/>
a broom and swept them up. This language is figurative. Those <lb/>
islanders&mdash;well, they are slow pay, at first, in the matter of return for <lb/>

your investment of effort, but in the end they make the pay of all <lb/>
other nations poor and small by contrast.</p>
<p>I was at the well next day betimes. Merlin was there, enchanting <lb/>
away like a beaver, but not raising the moisture. He was not in a <lb/>
pleasant humor; and every time I hinted that perhaps this contract was <lb/>
a shade too hefty for a novice he unlimbered his tongue and cursed <lb/>
like a bishop&mdash;French bishop of the Regency days, I mean.</p>
<p>Matters were about as I expected to find them. The "fountain" <lb/>
was an ordinary well, it had been dug in the ordinary way, and stoned <lb/>
up in the ordinary way. There was no miracle about it. Even the <lb/>
lie that had created its reputation was not miraculous; I could have <lb/>
told it myself, with one hand tied behind me. The well was in a <lb/>
dark chamber which stood in the centre of a cut-stone chapel, whose <lb/>
walls were hung with pious pictures of a workmanship that would <lb/>
have made a chromo feel good; pictures historically commemorative <lb/>
of curative miracles which had been achieved by the waters when <lb/>
nobody was looking. That is, nobody but angels: they are always <lb/>
on deck when there is a miracle to the fore&mdash;so as to get put in the <lb/>
picture, perhaps. Angels are as fond of that as a fire company; look <lb/>
at the old masters.</p>
<p>The well-chamber was dimly lighted by lamps; the water was <lb/>
drawn with a windlass and chain, by monks, and poured into troughs <lb/>
which delivered it into stone reservoirs outside, in the chapel&mdash;when <lb/>
there was water to draw, I mean&mdash;and none but monks could enter <lb/>
the well-chamber. I entered it, for I had temporary authority to do <lb/>
so, by courtesy of my professional brother and subordinate. But he <lb/>
hadn't entered it himself. He did everything by incantations; he <lb/>
never worked his intellect. If he had stepped in there and used his <lb/>
eyes, instead of his disordered mind, he could have cured the well <lb/>
by natural means, and then turned it into a miracle in the customary <lb/>
way; but no, he was an old numskull, a magician who believed in his <lb/>
<pb n="275" entity="DSSR_000002494_0286"/>
own magic; and no magician can thrive who is handicapped with a <lb/>
superstition like that.</p>
<p>I had an idea that the well had sprung a leak; that some of the <lb/>
wall stones near the bottom had fallen and exposed fissures that <lb/>
allowed the water to escape. I measured the chain&mdash;98 feet. Then I <lb/>
called in a couple of monks, locked the door, took a candle, and made <lb/>
them lower me in the bucket. When the chain was all paid out, the <lb/>
candle confirmed my suspicion; a considerable section of the wall was <lb/>
gone, exposing a good big fissure.</p>
<p>I almost regretted that my theory about the well's trouble was <lb/>
correct, because I had another one that had a showy point or two <lb/>
about it for a miracle. I remembered that in America, many centuries <lb/>
later, when an oil well ceased to flow, they used to blast it out with a <lb/>
dynamite torpedo. If I should find this well dry, and no explanation <lb/>
of it, I could astonish these people most nobly by having a person of <lb/>
no especial value drop a dynamite bomb into it. It was my idea to <lb/>
appoint Merlin. However, it was plain that there was no occasion for <lb/>
the bomb. One cannot have everything the way he would like it. A <lb/>
man has no business to be depressed by a disappointment, anyway; <lb/>
he ought to make up his mind to get even. That is what I did. I <lb/>
 <figure rend="block" id="f108" entity="DSSR_000002494_0286">
  <head>"AT THE TWELFTH REPETITION THEY FELL APART IN CHUNKS."</head>
 </figure>
 <pb n="276" entity="DSSR_000002494_0287"/>
said to myself, I am in no hurry, I can wait; that bomb will come <lb/>
good, yet. And it did, too.</p>
<p>When I was above ground again, I turned out the monks, and let <lb/>
down a fish-line: the well was a hundred and fifty feet deep, and <lb/>
there was forty-one feet of water in it! I called in a monk and asked:</p>
<p>"How deep is the well?"</p>
<p>"That, sir, I wit not, having never been told."</p>
<p>"How does the water usually stand in it?"</p>
<p>Near to the top, these two centuries, as the testimony goeth, <lb/>
brought down to us through our predecessors."</p>
<p>It was true&mdash;as to recent times at least&mdash;for there was witness to it, <lb/>
and better witness than a monk; only about twenty or thirty feet of <lb/>
the chain showed wear and use, the rest of it was unworn and rusty. <lb/>
What had happened when the well gave out that other time? Without <lb/>
doubt some practical person had come along and mended the leak, <lb/>
and then had come up and told the abbot he had discovered by <lb/>
divination that if the sinful bath were destroyed the well would flow <lb/>
again. The leak had befallen again, now, and these children would <lb/>
have prayed, and processioned, and tolled their bells for heavenly <lb/>
succor till they all dried up and blew away, and no innocent of them <lb/>
all would ever have thought to drop a fish-line into the well or go <lb/>
down in it and find out what was really the matter. Old habit of <lb/>
mind is one of the toughest things to get away from in the world. It <lb/>
transmits itself like physical form and feature; and for a man, in those <lb/>
days, to have had an idea that his ancestors hadn't had, would have <lb/>
brought him under suspicion of being illegitimate. I said to the <lb/>
monk:</p>
<p>"It is a difficult miracle to restore water in a dry well, but we will <lb/>
try, if my brother Merlin fails. Brother Merlin is a very passable <lb/>
artist, but only in the parlor-magic line, and he may not succeed; in <lb/>
fact is not likely to succeed. But that should be nothing to his <reg orig="dis-|credit">discredit</reg>; <lb/>
<pb n="277" entity="DSSR_000002494_0288"/>
the man that can do <hi rend="italic">this</hi> kind of miracle knows enough to <lb/>
keep hotel."</p>
<p>"Hotel? I mind not to have heard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Of hotel? It's what you call hostel. The man that can do this <lb/>
miracle can keep hostel. I can do this miracle; I shall do this miracle; <lb/>
yet I do not try to conceal from you that it is a miracle to tax the <lb/>
occult powers to the last strain."</p>
<p>"None knoweth that truth better than the brotherhood, indeed; <lb/>
for it is of record that aforetime it was parlous difficult and took a year. <lb/>
Natheless, God send you good success, and to that end will we pray."</p>
<p>As a matter of business it was a good idea to get the notion around <lb/>
that the thing was difficult. Many a small thing has been made large <lb/>
by the right kind of advertising. That monk was filled up with the <lb/>
difficulty of this enterprise; he would fill up the others. In two days <lb/>
the solicitude would be booming.</p>
<p>On my way home at noon, I met Sandy. She had been sampling <lb/>
the hermits. I said:</p>
<p>"I would like to do that, myself. This is Wednesday. Is there a <lb/>
matin&egrave;e?"</p>
<p>"A which, please you, sir?"</p>
<p>"Matin&egrave;e. Do they keep open, afternoons?"</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"The hermits, of course."</p>
<p>"Keep open?"</p>
<p>"Yes, keep open. Isn't that plain enough? Do they knock off at <lb/>
noon."</p>
<p>"Knock off?"</p>
<p>"Knock off?&mdash;yes, knock off. What is the matter with knock off? <lb/>
I never saw such a dunderhead; can't you understand anything at all? <lb/>
In plain terms, do they shut up shop, draw the game, bank the fires&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Shut up shop, draw&mdash;"</p>
<pb n="278" entity="DSSR_000002494_0289"/>
<p>"There, never mind, let it go; You make me tired. You can't <lb/>
seem to understand the simplest thing."</p>
<p>"I would I might please thee, sir, and it is to me dole and sorrow <lb/>
that I fail, albeit sith I am but a simple damsel and taught of none, <lb/>
being from the cradle unbaptised in those deep waters of learning that <lb/>
do anoint with a sovereignty him that partaketh of that most noble <lb/>
sacrament, investing him with reverend state to the mental eye of the <lb/>
humble mortal who, by bar and lack of that great consecration seeth <lb/>
in his own unlearned estate but a symbol of that other sort of lack and <lb/>
loss which men do publish to the pitying eye with sackcloth trappings <lb/>
whereon the ashes of grief do lie bepowdered and bestrewn, and so, <lb/>
when such shall in the darkness of his mind encounter these golden <lb/>
phrases of high mystery, these shut-up-shops, and draw-the-game, <lb/>
and bank-the-fires, it is but by the grace of God that he burst not for <lb/>
envy of the mind that can beget, and tongue that can deliver so great <lb/>
and mellow-sounding miracles of speech, and if there do ensue <reg orig="con-|fusion">confusion</reg> <lb/>
in that humbler mind, and failure to divine the meanings of these <lb/>
wonders, then if so be this miscomprehension is not vain but sooth and <lb/>
true, wit ye well it is the very substance of worshipful dear homage <lb/>
and may not lightly be misprized, nor had been, an ye had noted this <lb/>
complexion of my mood and mind and understood that that I would I <lb/>

the desired <hi rend="italic">would,</hi> and so I pray you mercy of my fault, and that ye <lb/>
will of your kindness and your charity forgive it, good my master and <lb/>
most dear lord."</p>
<p>I couldn't make it all out&mdash;that is, the details&mdash;but I got the general <lb/>
idea; and enough of it, too, to be ashamed. It was not fair to spring <lb/>
those nineteenth century technicalities upon the untutored infant of the <lb/>
sixth and then rail at her because she couldn't get their drift; and <lb/>
when she was making the honest best drive at it she could, too, and no <lb/>
<pb n="279" entity="DSSR_000002494_0290"/>
fault of hers that she couldn't fetch the home-plate; and so I <reg orig="apolo-|gized">apologized</reg>. <lb/>
Then we meandered pleasantly away toward the hermit-holes <lb/>
in sociable converse together, and better friends than ever.</p>
<p>I was gradually coming to have a mysterious and shuddery <reg orig="rever-|ence">reverence</reg> <lb/>
for this girl; for nowadays whenever she <lb/>
pulled out from the station and got her train <lb/>
fairly started on one of those horizonless <reg orig="trans-|continental">transcontinental</reg> <lb/>
sentences of hers, it was borne in upon <lb/>
me that I was <lb/>
standing in the <lb/>
awful presence <lb/>
of the Mother of <lb/>
the German <lb/>
Language. I <lb/>
was so <reg orig="impress-|ed">impressed</reg> <lb/>
with this, that <lb/>
sometimes when she began to empty one of these sentences on me I <lb/>
unconsciously took the very attitude of reverence, and stood <reg orig="uncov-|ered">uncovered</reg>; <lb/>
and if words had been water, I had been drowned, sure. She <lb/>
had exactly the German way: whatever was in her mind to be <reg orig="deliv-|ered">delivered</reg>, <lb/>

whether a mere remark, or a sermon, or a cyclopedia, or the <reg orig="his-|tory">history</reg> <lb/>
of a war, she would get it into a single sentence or die. <reg orig="When-|ever">Whenever</reg> <lb/>
the literary German dives into a sentence, that is the last you are <lb/>
going to see of him till he emerges on the other side of his Atlantic <lb/>
with his verb in his mouth.</p>
<p>We drifted from hermit to hermit all the afternoon. It was a most <lb/>
strange menagerie. The chief emulation among them seemed to be, <lb/>
to see which could manage to be the uncleanest and most prosperous <lb/>
with vermin. Their manner and attitudes were the last expression of <lb/>
complacent self-righteousness. It was one anchorite's pride to lie naked <lb/>
in the mud and let the insects bite him and blister him unmolested; it <lb/>
was another's to lean against a rock, all day long, conspicuous to the <lb/>
admiration of the throng of pilgrims, and pray; it was another's to go <lb/>
naked, and crawl around on all fours; it was another's to drag about <lb/>
with him, year in and year out, eighty pounds of iron; it was another's <lb/>
to never lie down when he slept, but to stand among the thorn-bushes <lb/>
and snore when there were pilgrims around to look; a woman, who <lb/>
had the white hair of age, and no other apparel, was black from crown <lb/>
to heel with forty-seven years of holy abstinence from water. Groups <lb/>
of gazing pilgrims stood around all and every of these strange <reg orig="ob-|jects">objects</reg>, <lb/>
lost in reverent wonder, and envious of the fleckless sanctity <lb/>
which these pious austerities had won for them from an exacting <lb/>
heaven.</p>
<p>By and by we went to see one of the supremely great ones. He was <lb/>
a mighty celebrity; his fame had penetrated all Christendom; the <lb/>
noble and the renowned journeyed from the remotest lands on the <lb/>
globe to pay him reverence. His stand was in the centre of the widest <lb/>
part of the valley; and it took all that space to hold his crowds.</p>
<p>His stand was a pillar sixty feet high, with a broad platform on the <lb/>
top of it. He was now doing what he had been doing every day for <lb/>
twenty years up there&mdash;bowing his body ceaselessly and rapidly <lb/>
<pb n="281" entity="DSSR_000002494_0292"/>
almost to his feet. It was his way of praying. I timed him with a <lb/>
stop-watch, and he made 1244 revolutions in 24 minutes and 46 seconds. <lb/>
It seemed a pity to have all this power going to waste. It was one of <lb/>
the most useful motions in mechanics, the pedal-movement; so I made <lb/>
a note in my memorandum book, purposing some day to apply a <reg orig="sys-|tem">system</reg> <lb/>
of elastic cords to him and run a sewing-machine with it. I <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
carried out that scheme, and got five years' good service out of <lb/>
him; in which time he turned out upwards of eighteen thousand <reg orig="first-|rate">first-rate</reg> <lb/>
tow-linen shirts, which was ten a day. I worked him Sundays <lb/>
and all; he was going, Sundays, the same as week-days, and it was no <lb/>
use to waste the power. These shirts cost me nothing but just the <lb/>
mere trifle for the materials&mdash;I furnished those myself, it would not <lb/>
have been right to make him do that&mdash;and they sold like smoke to <lb/>
pilgrims at a dollar and a half apiece, which was the price of fifty cows <lb/>
or a blooded race-horse in Arthurdom. They were regarded as a <lb/>
perfect protection against sin, and advertised as such by my knights <lb/>
everywhere, with the paint-pot and stencil-plate; insomuch that there <lb/>
was not a cliff or a boulder or a dead-wall in England but you could <lb/>
read on it at a mile distance:</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"Buy the only genuine St. Stylite; patronized by the Nobility. <lb/>
Patent applied for."</hi></p>
<p>There was more money in the business than one knew what to do <lb/>
with. As it extended, I brought out a line of goods suitable for kings, <lb/>
and a nobby thing for duchesses and that sort, with ruffles down the <lb/>
fore-hatch and the running-gear clewed up with a feather-stitch to <lb/>
leeward and then hauled aft with a back-stay and triced up with a <reg orig="half-|turn">half-turn</reg> <lb/>
in the standing rigging forward of the weather-gaskets. Yes, it <lb/>
was a daisy.</p>
<p>But about that time I noticed that the motive power had taken to <lb/>
standing on one leg, and I found that there was something the matter <lb/>
with the other one; so I stocked the business and unloaded, taking Sir <lb/>
<pb n="282" entity="DSSR_000002494_0293"/>
Bors de Ganis into camp financially along with certain of his friends: <lb/>
for the works stopped within a year, and the good saint got him to his <lb/>
rest. But he had earned it. I can say that for him.</p>
<p>When I saw him that first time&mdash;however, his personal condition <lb/>
will not quite bear description here. You can read it in the Lives of <lb/>
the Saints.<ref target="n4" n="3">*</ref>

<head>CHAPTER XXIII.<lb/> RESTORATION OF THE FOUNTAIN. <lb/></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Saturday</hi> noon I went to the well and <lb/>
looked on a while. Merlin was still burning <lb/>
smoke-powders, and pawing the air, and <lb/>
muttering gibberish as hard as ever, <lb/>
but looking pretty down-hearted, for of <lb/>
course he had not started even a <reg orig="per-|spiration">perspiration</reg> <lb/>
in that well yet. Finally I said:</p>
<p>"How does the thing promise by this <lb/>
time, partner?"</p>
<p>"Behold, I am even now busied with <lb/>
trial of the powerfulest enchantment <lb/>
known to the princes of the occult arts <lb/>
in the lands of the East; an it fail me, <lb/>
naught can avail. Peace, until I finish."</p>
<p>He raised a smoke this time that <lb/>
darkened all the <lb/>
region, and must <lb/>
have made matters <lb/>
uncomfortable for <lb/>
the hermits, for the <lb/>
wind was their way, <lb/>
and it rolled down <lb/>
over their <lb/>
dens in a <lb/>
dense and <lb/>

billowy fog. He poured out volumes of speech to match, and <reg orig="con-|torted">contorted</reg> <lb/>
his body and sawed the air with his hands in a most <reg orig="extraor-|dinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
way. At the end of twenty minutes he dropped down panting, <lb/>
and about exhausted. Now arrived the abbot and several hundred <lb/>
monks and nuns, and behind them a multitude of pilgrims and a couple <lb/>
of acres of foundlings, all drawn by the prodigious smoke, and all in a <lb/>
grand state of excitement. The abbot enquired anxiously for results.</p>
<p>Merlin said:</p>
<p>"If any labor of mortal might break the spell that binds these <lb/>
waters, this which I have but just essayed had done it. It has failed; <lb/>
whereby I do now know that that which I had feared is a truth <reg orig="estab-|lished">established</reg>: <lb/>
the sign of this failure is, that the most potent spirit known to <lb/>
the magicians of the East, and whose name none may utter and live, <lb/>
has laid his spell upon this well. The mortal does not breathe, nor <lb/>
ever will, who can penetrate the secret of that spell, and without that <lb/>
secret none can break it. The water will flow no more forever, good <lb/>
Father. I have done what man could. Suffer me to go."</p>
<p>Of course this threw the abbot into a good deal of a consternation. <lb/>
He turned to me with the signs of it in his face, and said:</p>
<p>"Ye have heard him. Is it true?"</p>
<p>"Part of it is."</p>
<p>"Not all, then, not all! What part is true?"</p>
<p>"That that spirit with the Russian name has put his spell upon the <lb/>
well."</p>
<p>"God's wownds, then are we ruined!"</p>
<p>"Possibly."</p>
<p>"But not certainly? Ye mean, not certainly?"</p>
<p>"That is it."</p>
<p>"Wherefore, ye also mean that when he saith none can break the <lb/>
spell&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, when he says that, he says what isn't necessarily true. <lb/>
<pb n="287" entity="DSSR_000002494_0298"/>
There are conditions under which an effort to break it may have some <lb/>
chance&mdash;that is, some small, some trifling chance&mdash;of success."</p>
<p>"The conditions&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, they are nothing difficult. Only these: I want the well and <lb/>
the surroundings for the space of half a mile, entirely to myself from <lb/>
sunset to-day until I remove the ban&mdash;and nobody allowed to cross <lb/>
the ground but by my authority."</p>
<p>"Are these all?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And you have no fear to try?"</p>
<p>"Oh, none. One may fail, of course; and one may also succeed. <lb/>
One can try, and I am ready to chance it. I have my conditions?"</p>
<p>"These and all others ye may name. I will issue commandment <lb/>
to that effect."</p>
<p>"Wait," said Merlin, with an evil smile. "Ye wit that he that <lb/>
would break this spell must know that spirit's name?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know his name."</p>
<p>"And wit you also that to know it skills not of itself, but ye must <lb/>
likewise pronounce it? Ha-ha! Knew ye that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I knew that, too."</p>
<p>"You had that knowledge! Art a fool? Are ye minded to utter <lb/>
that name and die?"</p>
<p>"Utter it? Why certainly. I would utter it if it was Welsh."</p>
<p>"Ye are even a dead man, then; and I go to tell Arthur."</p>
<p>"That's all right. Take your gripsack and get along. The thing <lb/>
for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to do is to go home and work the weather, John W. Merlin."</p>
<p>It was a home shot, and it made him wince; for he was the worst <lb/>
weather-failure in the kingdom. Whenever he ordered up the <reg orig="dan-|ger-signals">danger-signals</reg> <lb/>
along the coast there was a week's dead calm, sure, and <lb/>
every time he prophecied fair weather it rained brick-bats. But I kept <lb/>
him in the weather bureau right along, to undermine his reputation. <lb/>
<pb n="288" entity="DSSR_000002494_0299"/>
However, that shot raised his bile, and instead of starting home to <reg orig="re-|port">report</reg> <lb/>
my death, he said he would remain and enjoy it.</p>
<p>My two experts arrived in the evening, and pretty well fagged, for <lb/>
they had traveled double tides. They had pack-mules along, and had <lb/>
brought everything I needed&mdash;tools, pump, lead pipe, Greek fire, <lb/>
sheaves of big rockets, roman candles, colored-fire sprays, electric <lb/>
apparatus, and a lot of sundries&mdash;everything necessary for the <reg orig="state-|liest">stateliest</reg> <lb/>
kind of a miracle. They got their supper and a nap, and about <lb/>
midnight we sallied out through a solitude so wholly vacant and <reg orig="com-|plete">complete</reg> <lb/>
that it quite overpassed the required conditions. We took <reg orig="pos-|session">possession</reg> <lb/>
of the well and its surroundings. My boys were experts in all <lb/>
sorts of things, from the stoning up of a well to the constructing of a <lb/>
mathematical instrument. An hour before sunrise we had that leak <lb/>
mended in ship-shape fashion, and the water began to rise. Then we <lb/>
stowed our fire-works in the chapel, locked up the place, and went <lb/>
home to bed.</p>
<p>Before the noon mass was over, we were at the well again; for <lb/>
there was a deal to do, yet, and I was determined to spring the miracle <lb/>
before midnight, for business reasons: for whereas a miracle worked <lb/>
for the Church on a week-day is worth a good deal, it is worth six <lb/>
times as much if you get it in on a Sunday. In nine hours the water <lb/>
had risen to its customary level; that is to say, it was within <reg orig="twenty-|three">twenty-three</reg> <lb/>
feet of the top. We put in a little iron pump, one of the first <lb/>
turned out by my works near the capital; we bored into a stone <reg orig="res-|ervoir">reservoir</reg> <lb/>
which stood against the outer wall of the well-chamber and <lb/>
inserted a section of lead pipe that was long enough to reach to the <lb/>
door of the chapel and project beyond the threshold, where the <reg orig="gush-|ing">gushing</reg> <lb/>
water would be visible to the two hundred and fifty acres of people <lb/>
I was intending should be present on the flat plain in front of this little <lb/>
holy hillock at the proper time.</p>
<p>We knocked the head out of an empty hogshead and hoisted this <lb/>
<pb n="289" entity="DSSR_000002494_0300"/>
hogshead to the flat roof of the chapel, where we clamped it down fast, <lb/>
poured in gunpowder till it lay loosely an inch deep on the bottom, <lb/>
then we stood up rockets in the hogshead as thick as they could <lb/>
loosely stand, all the different breeds of rockets there are; and they <lb/>
made a portly and imposing sheaf, I can tell you. We grounded the <lb/>
wire of a pocket electrical battery in that powder, we placed a whole <lb/>
magazine of Greek fire on each corner of the roof&mdash;blue on one corner, <lb/>
green on another, red on another, and purple on the last, and grounded <lb/>
a wire in each.</p>
<p>About two hundred yards off, in the flat, we built a pen of <reg orig="scant-|lings">scantlings</reg>, <lb/>
about four feet high, and laid planks on it, and so made a <reg orig="plat-|form">platform</reg>. <lb/>
We covered it with swell tapestries borrowed for the occasion, <lb/>
and topped it off with the abbot's own throne. When you are going <lb/>
to do a miracle for an ignorant race, you want to get in every detail <lb/>
that will count; you want to make all the properties impressive to the <lb/>
public eye; you want to make matters comfortable for your head guest; <lb/>
then you can turn yourself loose and play your effects for all they are <lb/>
worth. I know the value of these things, for I know human nature. <lb/>
You can't throw too much style into a miracle. It costs trouble, and <lb/>
work, and sometimes money; but it pays in the end. Well, we brought <lb/>
the wires to the ground at the chapel, and then brought them under <lb/>
the ground to the platform, and hid the batteries there. We put a <lb/>
rope fence a hundred feet square around the platform to keep off the <lb/>
common multitude, and that finished the work. My idea was, doors <lb/>
open at 10.30, performance to begin at 11.25 sharp. I wished I could <lb/>
charge admission, but of course that wouldn't answer. I instructed my <lb/>
boys to be in the chapel as early as 10, before anybody was around, <lb/>
and be ready to man the pumps at the proper time, and make the fur <lb/>
fly. Then we went home to supper.</p>
<p>The news of the disaster to the well had traveled far, by this time; <lb/>
and now for two or three days a steady avalanche of people had been <lb/>
<pb n="290" entity="DSSR_000002494_0301"/>
pouring into the valley. The lower end of the valley was become one <lb/>
huge camp; we should have a good house, no question about that. <lb/>
Criers went the rounds early in the evening and announced the <reg orig="com-|ing">coming</reg> <lb/>
attempt, which put every pulse up to fever-heat. They gave <lb/>
notice that the abbot and his official suite would move in state and <lb/>
occupy the platform at 10.30, up to which time all the region which <lb/>
was under my ban must be clear; the bells would then cease from <reg orig="toll-|ing">tolling</reg>, <lb/>
and this sign should be permission to the multitudes to close in and <lb/>
take their places.</p>
<p>I was at the platform and all ready to do the honors when the <lb/>
abbot's solemn procession hove in sight&mdash;which it did not do till it <lb/>
was nearly to the rope fence, because it was a starless black night and <lb/>
no torches permitted. With it came Merlin, and took a front seat on <lb/>
the platform; he was as good as his word, for once. One could not <lb/>
see the multitudes banked together beyond the ban, but they were <lb/>
there, just the same. The moment the bells stopped, those banked <lb/>
masses broke and poured over the line like a vast black wave, and for <lb/>
as much as a half hour it continued to flow, and then it solidified itself, <lb/>
and you could have walked upon a pavement of human heads to&mdash;well, <lb/>
miles.</p>

  <head>"THE ABBOT'S SOLEMN PROCESSION."</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="291" entity="DSSR_000002494_0302"/>
<p>We had a solemn stage-wait, now, for about twenty minutes&mdash;a <lb/>
thing I had counted on for effect; it is always good to let your <reg orig="audi-|ence">audience</reg> <lb/>
have a chance to work up its expectancy. At length, out of the <lb/>
silence a noble Latin chant&mdash;men's voices&mdash;broke and swelled up and <lb/>
rolled away into the night, a majestic tide of melody. I had put that <lb/>
up, too, and it was one of the best effects I ever invented. When it was <lb/>
finished I stood up on the platform and extended my hands abroad, <lb/>
for two minutes, with my face uplifted&mdash;that always produces a dead <lb/>
hush&mdash;and then slowly pronounced this ghastly word with a kind of <lb/>
awfulness which caused hundreds to tremble, and many women to faint:</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">"Constantinopolitanischerdudelsackspfeifenmachersgesellschafft!"</hi></p>
<p>Just as I was moaning out the closing hunks of that word, I touched <lb/>
off one of my electric connections, and all that murky world of people <lb/>
stood revealed in a hideous blue glare! It was immense&mdash;that effect! <lb/>
Lots of people shrieked, women curled up and quit in every direction, <lb/>
foundlings collapsed by platoons. The abbot and the monks crossed <lb/>
themselves nimbly and their lips fluttered with agitated prayers. <reg orig="Mer-|lin">Merlin</reg> <lb/>
held his grip, but he was astonished clear down to his corns; he <lb/>
had never seen anything to begin with that, before. Now was the <lb/>
time to pile in the effects. I lifted my hands and groaned out this <lb/>
word&mdash;as it were in agony&mdash;</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">"<reg orig="Dihilistendynamittheaterkaestchenssprengungsattentaetsversuch-|ungen">Dihilistendynamittheaterkaestchenssprengungsattentaetsversuchungen</reg>!"</hi></p>
<p>&mdash;and turned on the red fire! You should have heard that Atlantic <lb/>
of people moan and howl when that crimson hell joined the blue! <lb/>
After sixty seconds I shouted&mdash;</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">"<reg orig="Transvaaltruppentropentransporttrampelthiertreiber-|trauungsthraenentragoedie">Transvaaltruppentropentransporttrampelthiertreibertrauungsthraenentragoedie</reg>!"</hi></p>
<p>&mdash;and lit up the green fire! After waiting only forty seconds, this <lb/>
<pb n="292" entity="DSSR_000002494_0303"/>
time, I spread my arms abroad <lb/>
and thundered out the <reg orig="devas-|tating">devastating</reg> <lb/>
syllables of this word <lb/>
of words&mdash;</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">"<reg orig="Mekkamusel-|mannenmassenmen">Mekkamuselmannenmassenmen</reg>- <lb/>
<lb/>
<reg orig="chenmoerdermohren-|muttermarmormonumentenmacher">chenmoerdermohrenmuttermarmormonumentenmacher</reg>!"</hi></p>
<p>&mdash;and whirled on the purple glare! There they <lb/>
were, all going at once, red, blue, green, purple! <lb/>
&mdash;four furious volcanoes pouring vast clouds of <lb/>
radiant smoke aloft, and spreading a blinding <lb/>
rainbowed noonday to the furthest confines of that <lb/>
valley. In the distance one could see that fellow <lb/>
on the pillar standing rigid against the <reg orig="back-|ground">background</reg> <lb/>
of sky, his see-saw stopped for the first <lb/>
time in twenty years. I knew the boys were at <lb/>
the pump, now, and ready. So I said to the <lb/>
abbot:</p>
<p>"The time is come, Father. I am about to <reg orig="pro-|nounce">pronounce</reg> <lb/>
the dread name and command the spell to <lb/>
dissolve. You want to brace up, and take hold of <lb/>
something." Then I shouted to the people: "<reg orig="Be-|hold">Behold</reg>, <lb/>
in another minute the spell will be broken, or <lb/>
no mortal can break it. If it break, all will know it, <lb/>
for you will see the sacred water gush from <lb/>
the chapel door!"</p>

  <head>"THAT FELLOW ON THE PIL- <lb/>
   LAR STANDING RIGID."</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="293" entity="DSSR_000002494_0304"/>
<p>I stood a few moments, to let the hearers have a chance to spread <lb/>
my announcement to those who couldn't hear, and so convey it to the <lb/>
furthest ranks, then I made a grand exhibition of extra posturing and <lb/>
gesturing, and shouted:</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f114" entity="DSSR_000002494_0304">
  <head>"BGWJJILLIGKKK!!"</head>
 </figure>
<p>"Lo, I command the fell spirit that possesses the holy fountain to <lb/>
now disgorge into the skies all the infernal fires that still remain in <lb/>
him, and straightway dissolve his spell and flee hence to the pit, there <lb/>
<pb n="294" entity="DSSR_000002494_0305"/>
to lie bound a thousand years. By his own dread name I command it <lb/>
&mdash;BGWJJILLIGKKK!"</p>
<p>Then I touched off the hogshead of rockets, and a vast fountain of <lb/>
dazzling lances of fire vomited itself toward the zenith with a hissing <lb/>
rush, and burst in mid-sky into a storm of flashing jewels! One mighty <lb/>
groan of terror started up from the massed people&mdash;then suddenly <lb/>
broke into a wild hosannah of joy&mdash;for there, fair and plain in the <reg orig="un-|canny">uncanny</reg> <lb/>
glare, they saw the freed water leaping forth! The old abbot <lb/>
could not speak a word, for tears and the chokings in his throat; <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
utterance of any sort, he folded me in his arms and mashed me. It <lb/>
was more eloquent than speech. And harder to get over, too, in a <lb/>
country where there were really no doctors that were worth a <reg orig="dam-|aged">damaged</reg> <lb/>
nickel.</p>
<p>You should have seen those acres of people throw themselves down <lb/>
in that water and kiss it; kiss it, and pet it, and fondle it, and talk to <lb/>
it as if it were alive, and welcome it back with the dear names they <lb/>
gave their darlings, just as if it had been a friend who was long gone <lb/>
away and lost, and was come home again. Yes, it was pretty to see, <lb/>
and made me think more of them than I had done before.</p>
<p>I sent Merlin home on a shutter. He had caved in and gone down <lb/>
like a landslide when I pronounced that fearful name, and had never <lb/>
come to since. He never had heard that name before,&mdash;neither had I <lb/>
&mdash;but to him it was the right one; any jumble would have been the <lb/>
right one. He admitted, afterward, that that spirit's own mother could <lb/>
not have pronounced that name better than I did. He never could <lb/>
understand how I survived it, and I didn't tell him. It is only young <lb/>
magicians that give away a secret like that. Merlin spent three months <lb/>
working enchantments to try to find out the deep trick of how to <reg orig="pro-|nounce">pronounce</reg> <lb/>
that name and outlive it. But he didn't arrive.</p>
<p>When I started to the chapel, the populace uncovered and fell back <lb/>
reverently to make a wide way for me, as if I had been some kind of a <lb/>
<pb n="295" entity="DSSR_000002494_0306"/>
superior being&mdash;and I was. I was aware of that. I took along a <reg orig="night-|shift">night-shift</reg> <lb/>
of monks, and taught them the mystery of the pump, and set them <lb/>
to work, for it was plain that a good part of the people out there were <lb/>
going to sit up with the water all night, consequently it was but right <lb/>
that they should have all they wanted of it. To those monks that <lb/>
pump was a good deal of a miracle itself, and they were full of wonder <lb/>
over it; and of admiration, too, of the exceeding effectiveness of its <lb/>
performance.</p>
<p>It was a great night, an immense night. There was reputation in <lb/>
it. I could hardly get to sleep for glorying over it.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIV.<lb/> A RIVAL MAGICIAN</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">My</hi> influence in the Valley of Holiness was <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
prodigious now. It seemed worth while <lb/>
to try to turn it to some valuable account. The <lb/>
thought came to me the next morning, and <lb/>
was suggested by my seeing one of my knights <lb/>
who was in the soap line come riding in. <reg orig="Ac-|cording">According</reg> <lb/>
to history, the monks of this place two <lb/>
centuries before, had been worldly <lb/>
minded enough to want to wash. It <lb/>
might be that there was a leaven <lb/>
of this unrighteousness still <reg orig="re-|maining">remaining</reg>. <lb/>
So I sounded a Brother:</p>
<p>"Wouldn't you like a bath?" <lb/>
He shuddered at the thought <lb/>
&mdash;the thought of the peril of it to <lb/>
the well&mdash;but he said with <lb/>
feeling&mdash;</p>
<p>"One needs not to ask <lb/>
that of a poor body who has <lb/>
not known that blessed <reg orig="re-|freshment">refreshment</reg> <lb/>
sith that he was <lb/>
a boy. Would God I might wash me! but it may not be, fair sir, tempt <lb/>
me not; it is forbidden."</p>
<p>And then he sighed in such a sorrowful way that I was resolved he <lb/>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f116" entity="DSSR_000002494_0310"/>-->
<pb n="300" entity="DSSR_000002494_0311"/>
should have at least one layer of his real estate removed, if it sized up <lb/>
my whole influence and bankrupted the pile. So I went to the abbot <lb/>
and asked for a permit for this Brother. He blenched at the idea&mdash;I <lb/>
don't mean that you could see him blench, for of course you couldn't <lb/>
see it without you scraped him, and I didn't care enough about it to <lb/>
scrape him, but I knew the blench was there, just the same, and within <lb/>
a book-cover's thickness of the surface, too&mdash;blenched, and trembled. <lb/>
He said:</p>
<p>"Ah, son, ask aught else thou wilt, and it is thine, and freely granted <lb/>
out of a grateful heart&mdash;but this, oh, this! Would you drive away the <lb/>
blessed water again?"</p>
<p>"No, Father, I will not drive it away. I have mysterious <reg orig="knowl-|edge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
which teaches me that there was an error that other time when <lb/>
it was thought the institution of the bath banished the fountain." A <lb/>
large interest began to show up in the old man's face. "My <reg orig="knowl-|edge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
informs me that the bath was innocent of that misfortune, which <lb/>
was caused by quite another sort of sin."</p>
<p>"These are brave words&mdash;but&mdash;but right welcome, if they be true."</p>
<p>"They are true, indeed. Let me build the bath again, Father. Let <lb/>
me build it again, and the fountain shall flow forever."</p>
<p>"You promise this?&mdash;you promise it? Say the word&mdash;say you <lb/>
promise it!"</p>
<p>"I do promise it."</p>
<p>"Then will I have the first bath myself! Go&mdash;get ye to your work. <lb/>
Tarry not, tarry not, but go."</p>
<p>I and my boys were at work, straight off. The ruins of the old bath <lb/>
were there yet, in the basement of the monastery, not a stone missing. <lb/>
They had been left just so, all these lifetimes, and avoided with a pious <lb/>
fear, as things accursed. In two days we had it all done and the water <lb/>
in&mdash;a spacious pool of clear pure water that a body could swim in. It <lb/>
was running water, too. It came in, and went out, through the ancient <lb/>
<pb n="301" entity="DSSR_000002494_0312"/>
pipes. The old abbot kept his word and was the first to try it. He <lb/>
went down black and shaky, leaving the whole black community above <lb/>
troubled and worried and full of bodings; but he came back white and <lb/>
joyful, and the game was made! another triumph scored.</p>
<p>It was a good campaign that we made in that Valley of Holiness, <lb/>
and I was very well satisfied, and ready to move on, now, but I struck <lb/>
a disappointment. I caught a heavy cold, and it started up an old <lb/>
lurking rheumatism of mine. Of course the rheumatism hunted up my <lb/>
weakest place and located itself there. This was the place where the <lb/>
abbot put his arms about me and mashed me, what time he was moved <lb/>
to testify his gratitude to me with an embrace.</p>
<p>When at last I got out, I was a shadow. But everybody was full of <lb/>
attentions and kindnesses, and these brought cheer back into my life <lb/>
and were the right medicine to help a convalescent swiftly up toward <lb/>
health and strength again; so I gained fast.</p>
<p>Sandy was worn out with nursing, so I made up my mind to turn <lb/>
out and go a cruise alone, leaving her at the nunnery to rest up. My <lb/>
idea was to disguise myself as a freeman of peasant degree and wander <lb/>
through the country a week or two on foot. This would give me a <lb/>
chance to eat and lodge with the lowliest and poorest class of free <reg orig="citi-|zens">citizens</reg> <lb/>
on equal terms. There was no other way to inform myself <reg orig="per-|fectly">perfectly</reg> <lb/>
of their every-day life and the operation of the laws upon it. If <lb/>
I went among them as a gentleman, there would be restraints and <reg orig="con-|ventionalities">conventionalities</reg> <lb/>
which would shut me out from their private joys and <lb/>
troubles, and I should get no further than the outside shell.</p>
<p>One morning I was out on a long walk to get up muscle for my trip <lb/>
and had climbed the ridge which bordered the northern extremity of <lb/>
the valley, when I came upon an artificial opening in the face of a low <lb/>
precipice, and recognized it by its location as a hermitage which had <lb/>
often been pointed out to me from a distance, as the den of a hermit of <lb/>
high renown for dirt and austerity. I knew he had lately been offered <lb/>
<pb n="302" entity="DSSR_000002494_0313"/>
a situation in the Great Sahara, where lions and sandflies made the <lb/>
hermit-life peculiarly attractive and difficult, and had gone to Africa <lb/>
to take possession, so I thought I would look in and see how the <reg orig="at-|mosphere">atmosphere</reg> <lb/>
of this den agreed with its reputation.</p>
<p>My surprise was great: the place was newly swept and scoured. <lb/>
Then there was another surprise. Back in the gloom of the cavern I <lb/>
heard the clink of a little bell, and then this exclamation:</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"Hello, Central! Is this you, Camelot?</hi> &mdash;&mdash;Behold, thou mayst <lb/>
glad thy heart an thou hast faith to believe the wonderful when that it <lb/>
cometh in unexpected guise and maketh itself manifest in impossible <lb/>
places&mdash;here standeth in the flesh his mightiness The Boss, and with <lb/>
thine own ears shall ye hear him speak!"</p>

<pb n="303" entity="DSSR_000002494_0314"/>
<p>Now what a radical reversal of things this was; what a jumbling <lb/>
together of extravagant incongruities; what a fantastic conjunction of <lb/>
opposites and irreconcilables&mdash;the home of the bogus miracle become <lb/>
the home of a real one, the den of a medieval hermit turned into a <reg orig="tele-|phone">telephone</reg> <lb/>
office!</p>
<p>The telephone clerk stepped into the light, and I recognized one of <lb/>
my young fellows. I said:</p>
<p>"How long has this office been established here, Ulfius?"</p>
<p>"But since midnight, fair Sir Boss, an it please you. We saw many <lb/>
lights in the valley, and so judged it well to make a station, for that <lb/>
where so many lights be needs must they indicate a town of goodly size."</p>
<p>"Quite right. It isn't a town in the customary sense, but it's a good <lb/>
stand, anyway. Do you know where you are?"</p>
<p>"Of that I have had no time to make inquiry; for whenas my <reg orig="com-|radeship">comradeship</reg> <lb/>
moved hence upon their labors, leaving me in charge, I got <lb/>
me to needed rest, purposing to inquire when I waked, and report the <lb/>
place's name to Camelot for record."</p>
<p>"Well, this is the Valley of Holiness."</p>
<p>It didn't take; I mean, he didn't start at the name, as I had <reg orig="sup-|posed">supposed</reg> <lb/>
he would. He merely said&mdash;</p>
<p>"I will so report it."</p>
<p>"Why, the surrounding regions are filled with the noise of late <reg orig="won-|ders">wonders</reg> <lb/>
that have happened here! You didn't hear of them?"</p>
<p>"Ah, ye will remember we move by night, and avoid speech with <lb/>
all. We learn naught but that we get by the telephone from Camelot."</p>
<p>"Why <hi rend="italic">they</hi> know all about this thing. Haven't they told you <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
about the great miracle of the restoration of a holy fountain?"</p>
<p>"Oh, <hi rend="italic">that?</hi> Indeed yes. But the name of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> valley doth woundily <lb/>
differ from the name of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> one; indeed to differ wider were not pos&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What was that name, then?"</p>
<p>"The Valley of Hellishness."</p>
<pb n="304" entity="DSSR_000002494_0315"/>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">That</hi> explains it. Confound a telephone, anyway. It is the very <lb/>
demon for conveying similarities of sound that are miracles of <reg orig="diver-|gence">divergence</reg> <lb/>
from similarity of sense. But no matter, you know the name of <lb/>
the place now. Call up Camelot."</p>
<p>He did it, and had Clarence sent for. It was good to hear my boy's <lb/>
voice again. It was like being home. After some affectionate <reg orig="inter-|changes">interchanges</reg>, <lb/>
and some account of my late illness, I said:</p>
<p>"What is new?"</p>
<p>"The king and queen and many of the court do start even in this <lb/>
hour, to go to your Valley to pay pious homage to the waters ye have <lb/>
restored, and cleanse themselves of sin, and see the place where the <lb/>
infernal spirit spouted true hell-flames to the clouds&mdash;an ye listen <lb/>
sharply ye may hear me wink and hear me likewise smile a smile, <lb/>
sith 'twas I that made selection of those flames from out our stock and <lb/>
sent them by your order."</p>
<p>"Does the king know the way to this place?"</p>
<p>"The king?&mdash;no, nor to any other in his realms, mayhap; but the <lb/>
lads that holp you with your miracle will be his guide and lead the way, <lb/>
and appoint the places for rests at noons and sleeps at night."</p>
<p>"This will bring them here&mdash;when?"</p>
<p>"Mid-afternoon, or later, the third day."</p>
<p>"Anything else in the way of news?"</p>
<p>"The king hath begun the raising of the standing army ye <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg> <lb/>
to him; one regiment is complete and officered."</p>
<p>"The mischief! I wanted a main hand in that, myself. There is <lb/>
only one body of men in the kingdom that are fitted to officer a <reg orig="regu-|lar">regular</reg> <lb/>
army."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;and now ye will marvel to know there's not so much as one <lb/>
West Pointer in that regiment."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? Are you in earnest?"</p>
<p>"It is truly as I have said."</p>
<pb n="305" entity="DSSR_000002494_0316"/>
<p>"Why, this makes me uneasy. Who were chosen, and <lb/>
what was the method? Competitive examination?"</p>
<p>"Indeed I know naught of the method. I but <lb/>
know this&mdash;these officers be all of noble family, and <lb/>
are born&mdash;what is it you call it? &mdash;chuckleheads."</p>
<p>"There's something wrong, Clarence."</p>
<p>"Comfort yourself, then; for two <reg orig="candi-|dates">candidates</reg> <lb/>
for a lieutenancy do travel hence <lb/>
with the king&mdash;young nobles both&mdash;and if <lb/>
you but wait where you are you will <lb/>
hear them questioned.</p>
<p>"That is news to the purpose. <lb/>
I will get one West Pointer in, <lb/>
anyway. Mount a man and send him to that school <lb/>
with a message; let him kill horses, if <lb/>
necessary, but he must be there before <reg orig="sun-|set">sunset</reg> <lb/>
to-night and say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There is no need. I have laid a ground <lb/>
wire to the school. Prithee let me <reg orig="con-|nect">connect</reg> <lb/>
you with it."</p>
<p>It sounded good! In this atmosphere <lb/>
of telephones and lightning communication with distant regions, I was <lb/>
breathing the breath of life again after long suffocation. I realized, <lb/>
then, what a creepy, dull, inanimate horror this land had been to me <lb/>
all these years, and how I had been in such a stifled condition of mind <lb/>
as to have grown used to it almost beyond the power to notice it.</p>
<p>I gave my order to the superintendent of the Academy personally. <lb/>
I also asked him to bring me some paper and a fountain pen and a box <lb/>
or so of safety matches. I was getting tired of doing without these <reg orig="con-|veniences">conveniences</reg>. <lb/>
I could have them, now, as I wasn't going to wear armor <lb/>
any more at present, and therefore could get at my pockets.</p>
 <!--<figure rend="inline" id="f118" entity="DSSR_000002494_0316"/>-->
<pb n="306" entity="DSSR_000002494_0317"/>
<p>When I got back to the monastery, I found a thing of interest going <lb/>
on. The abbot and his monks were assembled in the great hall, <lb/>
observing with childish wonder and faith the performances of a new <lb/>
magician, a fresh arrival. His dress was the extreme of the fantastic; <lb/>
as showy and foolish as the sort of thing an Indian medicine-man wears. <lb/>
He was mowing, and mumbling, and gesticulating, and drawing <reg orig="mys-|tical">mystical</reg> <lb/>
figures in the air and on the floor,&mdash;the regular thing, you know. <lb/>
He was a celebrity from Asia&mdash;so he said, and that was enough. That <lb/>
sort of evidence was as good as gold, and passed current everywhere.</p>
<p>How easy and cheap it was to be a great magician on this fellow's <lb/>
terms. His specialty was to tell you what any individual on the face <lb/>
of the globe was doing at the moment; and what he had done at any <lb/>
time in the past, and what he would do at any time in the future. He <lb/>
asked if any would like to know what the Emperor of the East was <lb/>
doing now? The sparkling eyes and the delighted rubbing of hands <lb/>
made eloquent answer&mdash;this reverend crowd <hi rend="italic">would</hi> like to know what <lb/>
that monarch was at, just at this moment. The fraud went through <lb/>
some more mummery, and then made grave announcement:</p>
<p>"The high and mighty Emperor of the East doth at this moment <lb/>
put money in the palm of a holy begging friar&mdash;one, two, three pieces, <lb/>
and they be all of silver."</p>
<p>A buzz of admiring exclamations broke out, all around:</p>
<p>"It is marvelous!" "Wonderful!" "What study, what labor, to <lb/>
have acquired a so amazing power as this!"</p>
<p>Would they like to know what the Supreme Lord of Inde was doing? <lb/>
Yes. He told them what the Supreme Lord of Inde was doing. Then <lb/>
he told them what the Sultan of Egypt was at; also what the King of <lb/>
the Remote Seas was about. And so on and so on; and with each new <lb/>
marvel the astonishment at his accuracy rose higher and higher. They <lb/>
thought he must surely strike an uncertain place sometime; but no, he <lb/>
never had to hesitate, he always knew, and always with unerring <reg orig="pre-|cision">precision</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="307" entity="DSSR_000002494_0318"/>
I saw that if this thing went on I should lose my supremacy, <lb/>
this fellow would capture my following, I should be left out in the cold. <lb/>
I must put a cog in his wheel, and do it right away, too. I said:</p>
<p>"If I might ask, I should very greatly like to know what a certain <lb/>
person is doing."</p>
<p>"Speak, and freely. I will tell you."</p>
<p>"It will be difficult&mdash;perhaps impossible."</p>
<p>"My art knoweth not that word. The more difficult it is, the more <lb/>
certainly will I reveal it to you."</p>
<p>You see, I was working up the interest. It was getting pretty high, <lb/>
too; you could see that by the craning necks all around, and the half <lb/>
suspended breathing. So now I climaxed it:</p>
<p>"If you make no mistake&mdash;if you tell me truly what I want to know <lb/>
&mdash;I will give you two hundred silver pennies."</p>
<p>"The fortune is mine! I will tell you what you would know."</p>
<p>"Then tell me what I am doing with my right hand."</p>
<p>"Ah-h!" There was a general gasp of surprise. It had not occurred <lb/>
to anybody in the crowd&mdash;that simple trick of inquiring about <reg orig="some-|body">somebody</reg> <lb/>
who wasn't ten thousand miles away. The magician was hit hard; <lb/>
it was an emergency that had never happened in his experience before, <lb/>
and it corked him; he didn't know how to meet it. He looked stunned, <lb/>
confused; he couldn't say a word. "Come," I said, "what are you <lb/>
waiting for? Is it possible you can answer up, right off, and tell what <lb/>
anybody on the other side of the earth is doing, and yet can't tell what <lb/>
a person is doing who isn't three yards from you? Persons behind me <lb/>
know what I am doing with my right hand&mdash;they will endorse you if <lb/>
you tell correctly." He was still dumb. "Very well, I'll tell you why <lb/>
you don't speak up and tell; it is because you don't know. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> a <lb/>
magician! Good friends, this tramp is a mere fraud and liar."</p>
<p>This distressed the monks and terrified them. They were not used <lb/>
to hearing these awful beings called names, and they did not know <lb/>
<pb n="308" entity="DSSR_000002494_0319"/>
what might be the consequence. There was a dead silence, now; <lb/>
superstitious bodings were in every mind. The magician began to pull <lb/>
his wits together, and when he presently smiled an easy, nonchalant <lb/>
smile, it spread a mighty relief around; for it indicated that his mood <lb/>
was not destructive. He said:</p>
<p>"It hath struck me speechless, the frivolity of this person's speech. <lb/>
Let all know, if perchance there be any who know it not, that <reg orig="enchan-|ters">enchanters</reg> <lb/>
of my degree deign not to concern themselves with the doings of <lb/>
any but Kings, Princes, Emperors, them that be born in the purple and <lb/>
them only. Had ye asked me what Arthur the great king is doing, it <lb/>
were another matter, and I had told ye; but the doings of a subject <lb/>
interest me not."</p>
<p>"Oh, I misunderstood you. I thought you said 'anybody,' and so <lb/>
I supposed 'anybody' included&mdash;well, anybody; that is, everybody."</p>
<p>"It doth&mdash;anybody that is of lofty birth; and the better if he be <lb/>
royal."</p>
<p>"That, it meseemeth, might well be," said the abbot, who saw his <lb/>
opportunity to smooth things and avert disaster, "for it were not likely <lb/>
that so wonderful a gift as this would be conferred for the revelation of <lb/>
the concerns of lesser beings than such as be born near to the summits <lb/>
of greatness. Our Arthur the king&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Would you know of him?" broke in the enchanter.</p>
<p>"Most gladly, yea, and gratefully."</p>
<p>Everybody was full of awe and interest again, right away, the <reg orig="incor-|rigible">incorrigible</reg> <lb/>
idiots. They watched the incantations absorbingly, and looked <lb/>
at me with a "There, now, what can you say to that?" air, when the <lb/>
announcement came:</p>
<p>"The king is weary with the chase, and lieth in his palace these <lb/>
two hours sleeping a dreamless sleep."</p>
<p>"God's benison upon him!" said the abbot, and crossed himself; <lb/>
"may that sleep be to the refreshment of his body and his soul."</p>
<pb n="309" entity="DSSR_000002494_0320"/>
<p>"And so it might be, if he were sleeping," I said, "but the king is <lb/>
not sleeping, the king rides."</p>
<p>Here was trouble again&mdash;a conflict of authority. Nobody knew <lb/>
which of us to believe; I still had some reputation left. The <reg orig="magi-|cian's">magician's</reg> <lb/>
scorn was stirred, and he said:</p>
<p>"Lo, I have seen many wonderful soothsayers and prophets and <lb/>
magicians in my life-days, but none before that could sit idle and see <lb/>
to the heart of things with never an incantation to help."</p>
<p>"You have lived in the woods, and lost much by it. I use <reg orig="incanta-|tions">incantations</reg> <lb/>
myself, as this good brotherhood are aware&mdash;but only on <reg orig="occa-|sions">occasions</reg> <lb/>
of moment."</p>
<p>When it comes to sarcasaming, I reckon I know how to keep my <lb/>
end up. That jab made this fellow squirm. The abbot inquired after <lb/>
the queen and the court, and got this information:</p>
<p>"They be all on sleep, being overcome by fatigue, like as to the <lb/>
king."</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>"That is merely another lie. Half of them are about their <reg orig="amuse-|ments">amusements</reg>, <lb/>
the queen and the other half are not sleeping, they ride. Now <lb/>
perhaps you can spread yourself a little, and tell us where the king <lb/>
and queen and all that are this moment riding with them are going?"</p>
<p>"They sleep now, as I said; but on the morrow they will ride, for <lb/>
they go a journey toward the sea."</p>
<p>"And where will they be the day after to-morrow at vespers?"</p>
<p>"Far to the north of Camelot, and half their journey will be done."</p>
<p>"That is another lie, by the space of a hundred and fifty miles. <lb/>
Their journey will not be merely half done, it will be all done, and <lb/>
they will be <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> in this valley."</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">That</hi> was a noble shot! It set the abbot and the monks in a <lb/>
whirl of excitement, and it rocked the enchanter to his base. I <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg> <lb/>
the thing right up:</p>
<pb n="310" entity="DSSR_000002494_0321"/>
<p>"If the king does not arrive, I will have myself ridden on a rail; if <lb/>
he does I will ride you on a rail instead."</p>
<p>Next day I went up to the telephone office and found that the king <lb/>
had passed through two towns that were on the line. I spotted his <lb/>
progress on the succeeding day in the same way. I kept these <reg orig="mat-|ters">matters</reg> <lb/>
to myself. The third day's reports showed that if he kept up his <lb/>
gait he would arrive by four in the afternoon. There was still no sign <lb/>
anywhere of interest in his coming; there seemed to be no preparations <lb/>
making to receive him in state; a strange thing, truly. Only one thing <lb/>
could explain this: that other magician had been cutting under me, <lb/>
sure. This was true. I asked a friend of mine, a monk, about it, and <lb/>
he said, yes, the magician had tried some further enchantments and <lb/>
found out that the court had concluded to make no journey at all, but <lb/>
stay at home. Think of that! Observe how much a reputation was <lb/>

worth in such a country. These people had seen me do the very <reg orig="show-|iest">showiest</reg> <lb/>
bit of magic in history, and the only one within their memory that <lb/>
had a positive value, and yet here they were, ready to take up with an <lb/>
adventurer who could offer no evidence of his powers but his mere <lb/>
unproven word.</p>
<p>However, it was not good politics to let the king come without any <lb/>
fuss and feathers at all, so I went down and drummed up a procession <lb/>
of pilgrims and smoked out a batch of hermits and started them out at <lb/>
two o'clock to meet him. And that was the sort of state he arrived in. <lb/>
The abbot was helpless with rage and humiliation when I brought <lb/>
him out on a balcony and showed him the head of the state marching <lb/>
in and never a monk on hand to offer him welcome, and no stir of life <lb/>
or clang of joy-bell to glad his spirit. He took one look and then flew <lb/>
to rouse out his forces. The next minute the bells were dinning <reg orig="furi-|ously">furiously</reg>, <lb/>
and the various buildings were vomiting monks and nuns, who <lb/>
went swarming in a rush toward the coming procession; and with <lb/>
them went that magician&mdash;and he was on a rail, too, by the abbot's <lb/>
order; and his reputation was in the mud, and mine was in the sky <lb/>
again. Yes, a man can keep his trade-mark current in such a country, <lb/>
but he can't sit around and do it; he has got to be on deck and <reg orig="attend-|ing">attending</reg> <lb/>

<head>CHAPTER XXV.<lb/> A COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> the king traveled for change of air, or <lb/>
made a progress, or visited a distant noble <lb/>
whom he wished to bankrupt with the cost <lb/>
of his keep, part of the administration <lb/>
moved with him. It was a fashion of the <lb/>
time. The Commission charged with the <lb/>
examination of candidates for posts <lb/>
in the army came with the king <lb/>
to the Valley, <lb/>
whereas they could <lb/>
have transacted their <lb/>
business just as well <lb/>
at home. And <reg orig="al-|though">although</reg> <lb/>
this <reg orig="expedi-|tion">expedition</reg> <lb/>
was strictly a <lb/>
holiday excursion for <lb/>
the king, he kept <lb/>
some of his business <lb/>
functions going, just <lb/>
the same. He <reg orig="touch-|ed">touched</reg> <lb/>
for the evil, as <lb/>
usual; he held <lb/>
court in the <lb/>
gate at sunrise and tried cases, for he was himself Chief Justice of the <lb/>
King's Bench.</p>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f121" entity="DSSR_000002494_0326"/>
<pb n="316" entity="DSSR_000002494_0327"/>
<p>He shone very well in this latter office. He was a wise and humane <lb/>
judge, and he clearly did his honest best and fairest,&mdash;according to his <lb/>
lights. That is a large reservation. His lights&mdash;I mean his rearing&mdash; <lb/>
often colored his decisions. Whenever there was a dispute between a <lb/>
noble or gentleman and a person of lower degree, the king's leanings <lb/>
and sympathies were for the former class always, whether he suspected <lb/>
it or not. It was impossible that this should be otherwise. The <reg orig="blunt-|ing">blunting</reg> <lb/>
effects of slavery upon the slaveholder's moral perceptions are <lb/>
known and conceded, the world over; and a privileged class, an <reg orig="aris-|tocracy">aristocracy</reg>, <lb/>
is but a band of slaveholders under another name. This has <lb/>
a harsh sound, and yet should not be offensive to any&mdash;even to the <lb/>
noble himself&mdash;unless the fact itself be an offense: for the statement <lb/>
simply formulates a fact. The repulsive feature of slavery is the <hi rend="italic">thing,</hi> <lb/>
not its name. One needs but to hear an aristocrat speak of the classes <lb/>
that are below him to recognize&mdash;and in but indifferently modified <lb/>
measure&mdash;the very air and tone of the actual slaveholder; and behind <lb/>
these are the slaveholder's spirit, the slaveholder's blunted feeling. <lb/>
They are the result of the same cause in both cases: the possessor's old <lb/>
and inbred custom of regarding himself as a superior being. The <lb/>
king's judgments wrought frequent injustices, but it was merely the <lb/>
fault of his training, his natural and unalterable sympathies. He was <lb/>
as unfitted for a judgeship as would be the average mother for the <lb/>
position of milk-distributor to starving children in famine-time; her <lb/>
own children would fare a shade better than the rest.</p>
<p>One very curious case came before the king. A young girl, an <lb/>
orphan, who had a considerable estate, married a fine young fellow <lb/>
who had nothing. The girl's property was within a seignory held <lb/>
by the Church. The bishop of the diocese, an arrogant scion of the <lb/>
great nobility, claimed the girl's estate on the ground that she had <lb/>
married privately, and thus had cheated the Church out of one of its <lb/>
rights as lord of the seignory&mdash;the one heretofore referred to as <hi rend="italic">le droit</hi> <lb/>
<pb n="317" entity="DSSR_000002494_0328"/>
<hi rend="italic">du seigneur.</hi> The penalty of refusal or avoidance was confiscation. <lb/>
The girl's defence was, that the lordship of the seignory was vested in <lb/>
the bishop, and the particular right here involved was not transferable, <lb/>
but must be exercised by the lord himself or stand vacated; and that <lb/>
an older law, of the Church itself, strictly barred the bishop from <reg orig="exer-|cising">exercising</reg> <lb/>
it. It was a very odd case, indeed.</p>
<p>It reminded me of something I had read in my youth about the <lb/>
ingenious way in which the aldermen of London raised the money that <lb/>
built the Mansion House. A person who had not taken the Sacrament <lb/>
according to the Anglican rite, could not stand as a candidate for <lb/>
sheriff of London. Thus Dissenters were ineligible; they could not <lb/>
run if asked, they could not serve if elected. The aldermen, who <lb/>
without any question were Yankees in disguise, hit upon this neat <lb/>
device: they passed a by-law imposing a fine of &pound;400 upon any one <lb/>
who should refuse to be a candidate for sheriff, and a fine of &pound;600 upon <lb/>
any person who, after being elected sheriff, refused to serve. Then <lb/>
they went to work and elected a lot of Dissenters, one after another, <lb/>
and kept it up until they had collected &pound;15,000 in fines; and there <lb/>
stands the stately Mansion House to this day, to keep the blushing <lb/>
citizen in mind of a long past and lamented day when a band of <lb/>
Yankees slipped into London and played games of the sort that has <lb/>
given their race a unique and shady reputation among all truly good <lb/>
and holy peoples that be in the earth.</p>
<p>The girl's case seemed strong to me; the bishop's case was just as <lb/>
strong. I did not see how the king was going to get out of this hole. <lb/>
But he got out. I append his decision:</p>
<p>"Truly I find small difficulty here, the matter being even a child's <lb/>
affair for simpleness. An the young bride had conveyed notice, as in <lb/>
duty bound, to her feudal lord and proper master and protector the <lb/>
bishop, she had suffered no loss, for the said bishop could have got a <lb/>
dispensation making him, for temporary conveniency, eligible to the <lb/>
<pb n="318" entity="DSSR_000002494_0329"/>
exercise of his said right, and thus would she have kept all she had. <lb/>
Whereas, failing in her first duty, she hath by that failure failed in all; <lb/>
for whoso, clinging to a rope, severeth it above his hands, must fall; <lb/>
it being no defence to claim that the rest of the rope is sound, neither <lb/>
any deliverance from his peril, as he shall find. Pardy, the woman's <lb/>
case is rotten at the source. It is the decree of the Court that she <lb/>
forfeit to the said lord bishop all her goods, even to the last farthing <lb/>
that she doth possess, and be thereto mulcted in the costs. Next!"</p>
<p>Here was a tragic end to a beautiful honeymoon not yet three <lb/>
months old. Poor young creatures! They had lived these three <lb/>
months lapped to the lips in worldly comforts. These clothes and <lb/>
trinkets they were wearing were as fine and dainty as the shrewdest <lb/>
stretch of the sumptuary laws allowed to people of their degree; and <lb/>
in these pretty clothes, she crying on his shoulder, and he trying to <lb/>
comfort her with hopeful words set to the music of despair, they <lb/>
went from the judgment seat out into the world homeless, bedless, <lb/>
breadless; why, the very beggars by the roadsides were not so poor <lb/>
as they.</p>
<p>Well, the king was out of the hole; and on terms satisfactory to <lb/>
the Church and the rest of the aristocracy, no doubt. Men write many <lb/>
fine and plausible arguments in support of monarchy, but the fact <reg orig="re-|mains">remains</reg> <lb/>
that where every man in a State has a vote, brutal laws are <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg>. <lb/>
Arthur's people were of course poor material for a republic, <lb/>
because they had been debased so long by monarchy; and yet even they <lb/>
would have been intelligent enough to make short work of that law which <lb/>
the king had just been administering if it had been submitted to their <lb/>
full and free vote. There is a phrase which has grown so common in <lb/>
the world's mouth that it has come to seem to have sense and meaning <lb/>
&mdash;the sense and meaning implied when it is used: that is the phrase <lb/>
which refers to this or that or the other nation as possibly being "<reg orig="ca-|pable">capable</reg> <lb/>
of self-government;" and the implied sense of it is, that there has <lb/>

been a nation somewhere, sometime or other which <hi rend="italic">wasn't</hi> capable of <lb/>
it&mdash;wasn't as able to govern itself as some self-appointed specialists <lb/>
were or would be to govern it. The master minds of all nations, in all <lb/>
ages, have sprung in affluent multitude from the mass of the nation, <lb/>
and from the mass of the nation only&mdash;not from its privileged classes; <lb/>
and so, no matter what the nation's intellectual grade was, whether <lb/>
high or low, the bulk of its ability was in the long ranks of its <reg orig="name-|less">nameless</reg> <lb/>
and its poor, and so it never saw the day that it had not the <lb/>
material in abundance whereby to govern itself. Which is to assert <lb/>
an always self-proven fact: that even the best governed and most free <lb/>
and most enlightened monarchy is still behind the best condition <reg orig="at-|tainable">attainable</reg> <lb/>
by its people; and that the same is true of kindred <reg orig="govern-|ments">governments</reg> <lb/>
of lower grades, all the way down to the lowest.</p>
<p>King Arthur had hurried up the army business altogether beyond <lb/>
my calculations. I had not supposed he would move in the matter <lb/>
while I was away; and so I had not mapped out a scheme for <reg orig="deter-|mining">determining</reg> <lb/>
the merits of officers; I had only remarked that it would be <lb/>
wise to submit every candidate to a sharp and searching examination; <lb/>
and privately I meant to put together a list of military qualifications <lb/>
that nobody could answer to but my West Pointers. That ought to <lb/>
have been attended to before I left; for the king was so taken with <lb/>
the idea of a standing army that he couldn't wait but must get about it <lb/>
at once, and get up as good a scheme of examination as he could <reg orig="in-|vent">invent</reg> <lb/>
out of his own head.</p>
<p>I was impatient to see what this was; and to show, too, how much <lb/>
more admirable was the one which I should display to the Examining <lb/>
Board. I intimated this, gently, to the king, and it fired his curiosity. <lb/>
When the Board was assembled, I followed him in, and behind us <lb/>
came the candidates. One of these candidates was a bright young <lb/>
West Pointer of mine, and with him were a couple of my West Point <lb/>
professors.</p>
<pb n="321" entity="DSSR_000002494_0332"/>
<p>When I saw the Board, I did not know whether to cry or to laugh. <lb/>
The head of it was the officer known to later centuries as Norroy <lb/>
King-at-Arms! The two other members were chiefs of bureaux in <lb/>
his department; and all three were priests, of course; all officials who <lb/>
had to know how to read and write were priests.</p>
<p>My candidate was called first, out of courtesy to me, and the head <lb/>
of the Board opened on him with official solemnity:</p>
<p>"Name?"</p>
<p>"Mal-ease."</p>
<p>"Son of?"</p>
<p>"Webster."</p>
<p>"Webster&mdash;Webster. Hm&mdash;I&mdash;my memory faileth to recall the <lb/>
name. Condition?"</p>
<p>"Weaver."</p>
<p>"Weaver!&mdash;God keep us!"</p>
<p>The king was staggered, from his summit to his foundations; one <lb/>
clerk fainted, and the others came near it. The chairman pulled <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
together, and said indignantly:</p>
<p>"It is sufficient. Get you hence."</p>
<p>But I appealed to the king. I begged that my candidate might be <lb/>
examined. The king was willing, but the Board, who were all <reg orig="well-|born">well-born</reg> <lb/>
folk, implored the king to spare them the indignity of <reg orig="examin-|ing">examining</reg> <lb/>
the weaver's son. I knew they didn't know enough to examine <lb/>
him anyway, so I joined my prayers to theirs and the king turned the <lb/>
duty over to my professors. I had had a blackboard prepared, and it <lb/>
was put up now, and the circus began. It was beautiful to hear the <lb/>
lad lay out the science of war, and wallow in details of battle and <lb/>
seige, of supply, transportation, mining and countermining, grand <lb/>
tactics, big strategy and little strategy, signal service, infantry, cavalry, <lb/>
artillery, and all about seige guns, field guns, gatling guns, rifled guns, <lb/>
smooth bores, musket practice, revolver practice&mdash;and not a solitary <lb/>
<pb n="322" entity="DSSR_000002494_0333"/>
word of it all could these catfish make head or tail of, you understand <lb/>
&mdash;and it was handsome to see him chalk off mathematical nightmares <lb/>
on the blackboard that would stump the angels themselves, and do it <lb/>
like nothing, too&mdash;all about eclipses, and comets, and solstices, and <lb/>
constellations, and mean time, and sidereal time, and dinner time, and <lb/>
bedtime, and every other imaginable thing above the clouds or under <lb/>
them that you could harry or bullyrag an enemy with and make him <lb/>
wish he hadn't come&mdash;and when the boy made his military salute and <lb/>
stood aside at last, I was proud enough to hug him, and all those other <lb/>
people were so dazed they looked partly petrified, partly drunk, and <lb/>
wholly caught out and snowed under. I judged that the cake was <lb/>
ours, and by a large majority.</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f123" entity="DSSR_000002494_0333">
  <head>"NOT A WORD OF IT ALL COULD THESE CAT-FISH MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF."</head>
 </figure>
<p>Education is a great thing. This was the same youth who had come <lb/>
to West Point so ignorant that when I asked him, "If a general officer <lb/>
should have a horse shot under him on the field of battle, what ought <lb/>
he to do?" answered up naively and said:</p>
<p>"Get up and brush himself."</p>
<pb n="323" entity="DSSR_000002494_0334"/>
<p>One of the young nobles was called up, now. I thought I would <lb/>
question him a little myself. I said:</p>
<p>"Can your lordship read?"</p>
<p>His face flushed indignantly, and he fired this at me:</p>
<p>"Takest me for a clerk? I trow I am not of a blood that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Answer the question!"</p>
<p>He crowded his wrath down and made out to answer "No."</p>
<p>"Can you write?"</p>
<p>He wanted to resent this, too, but I said:</p>
<p>"You will confine yourself to the questions, and make no <reg orig="com-|ments">comments</reg>. <lb/>
You are not here to air your blood or your graces, and <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg> <lb/>
of the sort will be permitted. Can you write?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Do you know the multiplication table?"</p>
<p>"I wit not what ye refer to."</p>
<p>"How much is 9 times 6?"</p>
<p>"It is a mystery that is hidden from me by reason that the <reg orig="emer-|gency">emergency</reg> <lb/>
requiring the fathoming of it hath not in my life-days occurred, <lb/>
and so, not having no need to know this thing, I abide barren of the <lb/>
knowledge."</p>
<p>"If A trade a barrel of onions to B, worth 2 pence the bushel, in <lb/>
exchange for a sheep worth 4 pence and a dog worth a penny, and C <lb/>
kill the dog before delivery, because bitten by the same, who mistook <lb/>
him for D, what sum is still due to A from B, and which party pays for <lb/>
the dog, C, or D, and who gets the money? if A, is the penny <reg orig="suffi-|cient">sufficient</reg>, <lb/>
or may he claim consequential damages in the form of additional <lb/>
money to represent the possible profit which might have inured from <lb/>
the dog, and classifiable as earned increment, that is to say, usufruct?"</p>
<p>"Verily, in the all-wise and unknowable providence of God, who <lb/>
moveth in mysterious ways his wonders to perform, have I never heard <lb/>
the fellow to this question for confusion of the mind and congestion of <lb/>
<pb n="324" entity="DSSR_000002494_0335"/>
the ducts of thought. Wherefore I beseech you let the dog and the <lb/>
onions and these people of the strange and godless names work out <lb/>
their several salvations from their piteous and wonderful difficulties <lb/>
without help of mine, for indeed their trouble is sufficient as it is, <reg orig="where-|as">whereas</reg> <lb/>
an I tried to help I should but damage their cause the more and yet <lb/>
mayhap not live myself to see the desolation wrought."</p>
<p>"What do you know of the laws of attraction and gravitation?"</p>
<p>"If there be such, mayhap his grace the king did promulgate them <lb/>
whilst that I lay sick about the beginning of the year and thereby failed <lb/>
to hear his proclamation."</p>
<p>"What do you know of the science of optics?"</p>
<p>"I know of governors of places, and seneschals of castles, and <reg orig="sher-|iffs">sheriffs</reg> <lb/>
of counties, and many like small offices and titles of honor, but him <lb/>
you call the Science of Optics I have not heard of before; peradventure <lb/>
it is a new dignity."</p>
<p>"Yes, in this country."</p>
<p>Try to conceive of this mollusk gravely applying for an official <reg orig="posi-|tion">position</reg>, <lb/>
of any kind under the sun! Why, he had all the ear-marks of a <lb/>
type-writer copyist, if you leave out the disposition to contribute <reg orig="unin-|vited">uninvited</reg> <lb/>
emendations of your grammar and punctuation. It was <reg orig="unaccount-|able">unaccountable</reg> <lb/>
that he didn't attempt a little help of that sort out of his majestic <lb/>
supply of incapacity for the job. But that didn't prove that he hadn't <lb/>
material in him for the disposition, it only proved that he wasn't a <reg orig="type-|writer">typewriter</reg> <lb/>
copyist yet. After nagging him a little more, I let the professors <lb/>
loose on him and they turned him inside out, on the line of scientific <lb/>
war, and found him empty, of course. He knew somewhat about the <lb/>
warfare of the time&mdash;bushwhacking around for ogres, and bull-fights in <lb/>
the tournament ring, and such things&mdash;but otherwise he was empty and <lb/>
useless. Then we took the other young noble in hand, and he was the <lb/>
first one's twin, for ignorance and incapacity. I delivered them into the <lb/>
hands of the chairman of the Board with the comfortable consciousness <lb/>
<pb n="325" entity="DSSR_000002494_0336"/>
that their cake was dough. They were examined in the previous order <lb/>
of precedence.</p>
<p>"Name, so please you?"</p>
<p>"Pertipole, son of Sir Pertipole, Baron of Barley Mash."</p>
<p>"Grandfather?"</p>
<p>"Also Sir Pertipole, Baron of Barley Mash."</p>
<p>"Great-grandfather?"</p>
<p>"The same name and title."</p>
<p>"Great-great-grandfather?"</p>
<p>"We had none, worshipful sir, the line failing before it had reached <lb/>
so far back."</p>
<p>"It mattereth not. It is a good four generations, and fulfilleth the <lb/>
requirements of the rule."</p>
<p>"Fulfills what rule?" I asked.</p>
<p>"The rule requiring four generations of nobility or else the <reg orig="candi-|date">candidate</reg> <lb/>
is not eligible."</p>
<p>"A man not eligible for a lieutenancy in the army unless he can <lb/>
prove four generations of noble descent?"</p>
<p>"Even so; neither lieutenant nor any other officer may be <reg orig="commis-|sioned">commissioned</reg> <lb/>
without that qualification."</p>
<p>"Oh come, this is an astonishing thing. What good is such a <reg orig="qual-|ification">qualification</reg> <lb/>
as that?"</p>
<p>"What good? It is a hardy question, fair sir and Boss, since it <lb/>
doth go far to impugn the wisdom of even our holy Mother Church <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>."</p>
<p>"As how?"</p>
<p>"For that she hath established the self-same rule regarding saints. <lb/>
By her law none may be canonized until he hath lain dead four <reg orig="gen-|erations">generations</reg>."</p>
<p>"I see, I see&mdash;it is the same thing. It is wonderful. In the one <lb/>
case a man lies dead-alive four generations&mdash;mummified in ignorance <lb/>
<pb n="326" entity="DSSR_000002494_0337"/>
and sloth&mdash;and that qualifies him to command live people, and take <lb/>
their weal and woe into his impotent hands; and in the other case, a <lb/>
man lies bedded with death and worms four generations, and that <reg orig="qual-|ifies">qualifies</reg> <lb/>
him for office in the celestial camp. Does the king's grace <reg orig="ap-|prove">approve</reg> <lb/>
of this strange law?"</p>
<p>The king said:</p>
<p>"Why, truly I see naught about it that is strange. All places of <lb/>
honor and of profit do belong, by natural right, to them that be of <lb/>
noble blood, and so these dignities in the army are their property and <lb/>
would be so without this or any rule. The rule is but to mark a limit. <lb/>
Its purpose is to keep out too recent blood, which would bring into <lb/>
contempt these offices, and men of lofty lineage would turn their backs <lb/>
and scorn to take them. I were to blame an I permitted this calamity. <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">You</hi> can permit it an you are minded so to do, for you have the <reg orig="dele-|gated">delegated</reg> <lb/>
authority, but that the king should do it were a most strange <lb/>
madness and not comprehensible to any."</p>
<p>"I yield. Proceed, sir Chief of the Herald's College."</p>

<p>The chairman resumed as follows:</p>
<p>"By what illustrious achievement for the honor of the Throne and <lb/>
State did the founder of your great line lift himself to the sacred <reg orig="dig-|nity">dignity</reg> <lb/>
of the British nobility?"</p>
<p>"He built a brewery."</p>
<p>"Sire, the Board finds this candidate perfect in all the requirements <lb/>
and qualifications for military command, and doth hold his case open <lb/>
for decision after due examination of his competitor."</p>
<p>The competitor came forward and proved exactly four generations <lb/>
of nobility himself. So there was a tie in military qualifications that far.</p>
<p>He stood aside, a moment, and Sir Pertipole was questioned <reg orig="fur-|ther">further</reg>:</p>
<p>"Of what condition was the wife of the founder of your line?"</p>
<p>"She came of the highest landed gentry, yet she was not noble; <lb/>
she was gracious and pure and charitable, of a blameless life and <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg>, <lb/>
insomuch that in these regards was she peer of the best lady in <lb/>
the land."</p>
<p>"That will do. Stand down." He called up the competing <reg orig="lord-|ling">lordling</reg> <lb/>
again, and asked: "What was the rank and condition of the <lb/>
great-grandmother who conferred British nobility upon your great <lb/>
house?"</p>
<p>"She was a king's leman and did climb to that splendid eminence <lb/>
by her own unholpen merit from the sewer where she was born."</p>
<p>"Ah, this indeed is true nobility, this is the right and perfect <reg orig="inter-|mixture">intermixture</reg>. <lb/>
The lieutenancy is yours, fair lord. Hold it not in contempt; <lb/>
it is the humble step which will lead to grandeurs more worthy of the <lb/>
splendor of an origin like to thine."</p>
<p>I was down in the bottomless pit of humiliation. I had promised <lb/>
myself an easy and zenith-scouring triumph, and this was the outcome!</p>
<p>I was almost ashamed to look my poor disappointed cadet in the <lb/>
face. I told him to go home and be patient, this wasn't the end.</p>
<pb n="328" entity="DSSR_000002494_0339"/>
<p>I had a private audience with the king, and made a proposition. I <lb/>
said it was quite right to officer that regiment with nobilities, and he <lb/>
couldn't have done a wiser thing. It would also be a good idea to add <lb/>
five hundred officers to it; in fact, add as many officers as there were <lb/>
nobles and relatives of nobles in the country, even if there should <lb/>
finally be five times as many officers as privates in it; and thus make <lb/>
it the crack regiment, the envied regiment, the King's Own regiment, <lb/>
and entitled to fight on its own hook and in its own way, and go <lb/>
whither it would and come when it pleased, in time of war, and be <reg orig="ut-|terly">utterly</reg> <lb/>
swell and independent. This would make that regiment the <lb/>
heart's desire of all the nobility, and they would all be satisfied and <lb/>
happy. Then we would make up the rest of the standing army out of <lb/>
commonplace materials, and officer it with nobodies, as was proper&mdash; <lb/>
nobodies selected on a basis of mere efficiency&mdash;and we would make <lb/>
this regiment toe the line, allow it no aristocratic freedom from <reg orig="re-|straint">restraint</reg>, <lb/>
and force it to do all the work and persistent hammering, to <lb/>
the end that whenever the King's Own was tired and wanted to go off <lb/>
for a change and rummage around amongst ogres and have a good time, <lb/>
it could go without uneasiness, knowing that matters were in safe <lb/>
hands behind it, and business going to be continued at the old stand, <lb/>
same as usual. The king was charmed with the idea.</p>
<p>When I noticed that, it gave me a valuable notion. I thought I saw <lb/>
my way out of an old and stubborn difficulty at last. You see, the <lb/>
royalties of the Pendragon stock were a long-lived race and very <reg orig="fruit-|ful">fruitful</reg>. <lb/>
Whenever a child was born to any of these&mdash;and it was pretty <lb/>
often&mdash;there was wild joy in the nation's mouth, and piteous sorrow in <lb/>
the nation's heart. The joy was questionable, but the grief was honest. <lb/>
Because the event meant another call for a Royal Grant. Long was the <lb/>
list of these royalties, and they were a heavy and steadily increasing <lb/>
burden upon the treasury and a menace to the crown. Yet Arthur could <lb/>
not believe this latter fact, and he would not listen to any of my <reg orig="vari-|ous">various</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="329" entity="DSSR_000002494_0340"/>
projects for substituting something in the place of the royal grants. <lb/>
If I could have persuaded him to now and then provide a support for <lb/>
one of these outlying scions from his own pocket, I could have made <lb/>
a grand to-do over it, and it would have had a good effect with the <lb/>
nation; but no, he wouldn't hear of such a thing. He had something <lb/>
like a religious passion for a royal grant; he seemed to look upon it as <lb/>
a sort of sacred swag, and one could not irritate him in any way so <lb/>
quickly and so surely as by an attack upon that venerable institution. <lb/>
If I ventured to cautiously hint that there was not another respectable <lb/>
family in England that would humble itself to hold out the <reg orig="hat&mdash;how-|ever">hat&mdash;however</reg>, <lb/>
that is as far as I ever got; he always cut me short, there, and <lb/>
peremptorily, too.</p>
<p>But I believed I saw my chance at last. I would form this crack <lb/>
regiment out of officers alone&mdash;not a single private. Half of it should <lb/>
consist of nobles, who should fill all the places up to Major General, <lb/>
and serve gratis and pay their own expenses; and they would be glad <lb/>
to do this when they should learn that the rest of the regiment would <lb/>
consist exclusively of princes of the blood. These princes of the blood <lb/>
should range in rank from Lieutenant General up to Field Marshal, <lb/>
and be gorgeously salaried and equipped and fed by the state. <reg orig="More-|over&mdash;and">Moreover&mdash;and</reg> <lb/>
this was the master stroke&mdash;it should be decreed that these <lb/>
princely grandees should be always addressed by a stunningly gaudy <lb/>
and awe-compelling title, (which I would presently invent,) and they <lb/>
and they only in all England should be so addressed. Finally, all <lb/>
princes of the blood should have free choice: join that regiment, <lb/>
get that great title, and renounce the royal grant, or stay out and <reg orig="re-|ceive">receive</reg> <lb/>
a grant. Neatest touch of all: unborn but imminent princes <lb/>
of the blood could be <hi rend="italic">born</hi> into the regiment, and start fair, with <lb/>
good wages and a permanent situation, upon due notice from the <lb/>
parents.</p>
<p>All the boys would join, I was sure of that; so, all existing grants <lb/>
<pb n="330" entity="DSSR_000002494_0341"/>
would be relinquished; that the newly born would always join was <lb/>
equally certain. Within sixty days that quaint and bizarre anomaly, <lb/>
the Royal Grant, would cease to be a living fact, and take its place <lb/>
among the curiosities of the past.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVI.<lb/> THE FIRST NEWSPAPER.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> I told the king I was going out <reg orig="dis-|guised">disguised</reg> <lb/>
as a petty freeman to scour the <lb/>
country and familiarize myself with the <lb/>
humbler life of the people, he was all <lb/>
afire with the novelty of the thing in a <lb/>
minute, and was bound to take a chance in the <reg orig="adven-|ture">adventure</reg> <lb/>
himself&mdash;nothing should stop him&mdash;he would <lb/>
drop everything and go along&mdash;it was the prettiest idea he <lb/>
had run across for many a day. He wanted to glide out <lb/>
the back way and start at once; but I showed him that <lb/>
that wouldn't answer. You see, he was billed for the <lb/>
king's-evil&mdash;to touch for it, I mean&mdash;and it wouldn't be <lb/>
right to disappoint the house; and it wouldn't make a <reg orig="de-|lay">delay</reg> <lb/>
worth considering, anyway, it was only a one-night <lb/>
stand. And I thought he ought to tell the queen he was <lb/>
going away. He clouded up at that, and looked sad. I was <lb/>
sorry I had spoken, especially when he said mournfully:</p>
<p>"Thou forgettest that Launcelot is here; and where <lb/>
Launcelot is, she noteth not the going forth of the king, nor <lb/>
what day he returneth."</p>
<p>Of course I changed the subject. Yes, <reg orig="Guene-|ver">Guenever</reg> <lb/>
was beautiful, it is true, but take her all around <lb/>
she was pretty slack. I never meddled in these <lb/>
matters, they weren't my affair, but I did hate to <lb/>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f126" entity="DSSR_000002494_0344"/>-->
<pb n="334" entity="DSSR_000002494_0345"/>
see the way things were going on, and I don't mind saying that much. <lb/>
Many's the time she had asked me, "Sir Boss, hast seen Sir Launcelot <lb/>
about?" but if ever she went fretting around for the king I didn't <reg orig="hap-|pen">happen</reg> <lb/>
to be around at the time.</p>
<p>There was a very good lay-out for the king's-evil business&mdash;very <lb/>
tidy and creditable. The king sat under a canopy of state, about him <lb/>
were clustered a large body of the clergy <lb/>
in full canonicals. Conspicuous, both for <lb/>
location and personal outfit, stood <reg orig="Mari-|nel">Marinel</reg>, <lb/>
a hermit of the quack-doctor <reg orig="spe-|cies">species</reg>, <lb/>
to introduce the sick. All abroad <lb/>
over the spacious floor, and clear down <lb/>
to the doors, in a thick jumble, lay or <lb/>
sat the scrofulous, under a strong light. <lb/>
It was as good as a tableau; in fact it <lb/>
had all the look of being gotten up <lb/>
for that, though it wasn't. There were <lb/>
eight hundred sick people present. <lb/>
The work was slow; it lacked the <reg orig="in-|terest">interest</reg> <lb/>
of novelty for me, because I <lb/>
had seen the ceremonies before; the <lb/>
thing soon became tedious, but the <lb/>
proprieties required me to stick it <lb/>
out. The doctor was there for the <lb/>
reason that in all such crowds there were many people who only <lb/>
imagined something was the matter with them, and many who were <lb/>
consciously sound but wanted the immortal honor of fleshly contact <lb/>
with a king, and yet others who pretended to illness in order to get <lb/>
the piece of coin that went with the touch. Up to this time this coin <lb/>
had been a wee little gold piece worth about a third of a dollar. When <lb/>
you consider how much that amount of money would buy, in that age <lb/>

 </figure>
<pb n="335" entity="DSSR_000002494_0346"/>
and country, and how usual it was to be scrofulous, when not dead, <lb/>
you will understand that the annual king's-evil appropriation was just <lb/>
the River and Harbor bill of that government for the grip it took on <lb/>
the treasury and the chance it afforded for skinning the surplus. So I <lb/>
had privately concluded to touch the treasury itself for the king's-evil. <lb/>
I covered sixth-sevenths of the appropriation into the treasury a week <lb/>
before starting from Camelot on my adventures, and ordered that the <lb/>
other seventh be inflated into five-cent nickels and delivered into the <lb/>
hands of the head clerk of the King's Evil Department; a nickel to <lb/>
take the place of each gold coin, you see, and do its work for it. It <lb/>
might strain the nickel some, but I judged it could stand it. As a rule, <lb/>
I do not approve of watering stock, but I considered it square enough <lb/>
in this case, for it was just a gift, anyway. Of course you can water a <lb/>
gift as much as you want to; and I generally do. The old gold and <lb/>
silver coins of the country were of ancient and unknown origin, as a <lb/>
rule, but some of them were Roman; they were ill shapen, and seldom <lb/>
rounder than a moon that is a week past the full; they were hammered, <lb/>
not minted, and they were so worn with use that the devices upon them <lb/>
were as illegible as blisters, and looked like them. I judged that a <lb/>
sharp, bright new nickel, with a first-rate likeness of the king on one <lb/>
side of it and Guenever on the other, and a blooming pious motto, <lb/>
would take the tuck out of scrofula as handy as a nobler coin and please <lb/>
the scrofulous fancy more; and I was right. This batch was the first <lb/>
it was tried on, and it worked to a charm. The saving in expense was <lb/>
a notable economy. You will see that by these figures: We touched <lb/>
a trifle over 700 of the 800 patients; at former rates, this would have <lb/>
cost the government about $240; at the new rate we pulled through <lb/>
for about $35, thus saving upward of $200 at one swoop. To appreciate <lb/>
the full magnitude of this stroke, consider these other figures: the <lb/>
annual expenses of a national government amount to the equivalent of <lb/>
a contribution of three days' average wages of every individual of the <lb/>
<pb n="336" entity="DSSR_000002494_0347"/>
population, counting every individual as if he were a man. If you take <lb/>
a nation of 60,000,000 where average wages are $2 per day, three days' <lb/>
wages taken from each individual will provide $360,000,000 and pay the <lb/>
government's expenses. In my day, in my own country, this money <lb/>
was collected from imposts, and the citizen imagined that the foreign <lb/>
importer paid it, and it made him comfortable to think so; whereas, in <lb/>
fact, it was paid by the American people, and was so equally and <lb/>
exactly distributed among them that the annual cost to the 100-<reg orig="mill-|ionaire">millionaire</reg> <lb/>
and the annual cost to the sucking child of the day laborer was <lb/>
precisely the same&mdash;each paid $6. Nothing could be equaler than that, <lb/>
I reckon. Well, Scotland and Ireland were tributary to Arthur, and <lb/>
the united populations of the British Islands amounted to something <lb/>
less than 1,000,000. A mechanic's average wage was 3 cents a day, <lb/>
when he paid his own keep. By this rule, the national government's <lb/>
expenses were $90,000 a year, or about $250 a day. Thus, by the <reg orig="sub-|stitution">substitution</reg> <lb/>
of nickels for gold on a king's-evil day, I not only injured no <lb/>
one, dissatisfied no one, but pleased all concerned and saved four-fifths <lb/>
of that day's national expense into the bargain&mdash;a saving which would <lb/>
have been the equivalent of $800,000 in my day in America. In <reg orig="mak-|ing">making</reg> <lb/>
this substitution I had drawn upon the wisdom of a very remote <lb/>
source&mdash;the wisdom of my boyhood&mdash;for the true statesman does not <lb/>
despise any wisdom, howsoever lowly may be its origin: in my <reg orig="boy-|hood">boyhood</reg> <lb/>
I had always saved my pennies and contributed buttons to the <lb/>
foreign missionary cause. The buttons would answer the ignorant <lb/>
savage as well as the coin, the coin would answer me better than the <lb/>
buttons; all hands were happy and nobody hurt.</p>
<p>Marinel took the patients as they came. He examined the <reg orig="can-|didate">candidate</reg>; <lb/>
if he couldn't qualify he was warned off; if he could he was <lb/>
passed along to the king. A priest pronounced the words, "They shall <lb/>
lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover." Then the king <lb/>
stroked the ulcers, while the reading continued; finally, the patient <lb/>
<pb n="337" entity="DSSR_000002494_0348"/>
graduated and got his nickel&mdash;the king hanging it around his neck <lb/>
himself&mdash;and was dismissed. Would you think that that would cure? <lb/>
It certainly did. Any mummery will cure <lb/>
if the patient's faith is strong in it. Up by <lb/>
Astolat there was a chapel where the <reg orig="Vir-|gin">Virgin</reg> <lb/>
had once appeared to a girl who used <lb/>
to herd geese around there&mdash;the girl said <lb/>
so herself&mdash;and they built the chapel <lb/>
upon that spot and hung a picture in it <lb/>
representing the occurrence&mdash;a picture <lb/>
which you would think it dangerous for <lb/>
a sick person to approach; whereas, on <lb/>
the contrary, thousands of <lb/>
the lame and the sick <lb/>
came and prayed before <lb/>
it every year and went <lb/>
away whole and sound; and <lb/>
even the well could look <lb/>
upon it and live. Of course <lb/>
when I was told these <lb/>
things I did not believe <lb/>
them; but when I <lb/>
went there and <lb/>
saw them I had <lb/>
to succumb. I <lb/>
saw the cures <reg orig="ef-|fected">effected</reg> <lb/>
myself; and <lb/>
they were real <lb/>
cures and not <lb/>
questionable. I saw cripples whom I had seen around Camelot for <lb/>
years on crutches, arrive and pray before that picture, and put down <lb/>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f128" entity="DSSR_000002494_0348">
  <head>"HAST SEEN SIR LAUNCELOT ABOUT?"</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="338" entity="DSSR_000002494_0349"/>
their crutches and walk off without a limp. There were piles of crutches <lb/>
there which had been left by such people as a testimony.</p>
<p>In other places people operated on a patient's mind, without saying <lb/>
a word to him, and cured him. In others, experts assembled patients <lb/>
in a room and prayed over them, and appealed to their faith, and those <lb/>
patients went away cured. Wherever you find a king who can't cure <lb/>
the king's-evil you can be sure that the most valuable superstition that <lb/>
supports his throne&mdash;the subject's belief in the divine appointment of <lb/>
his sovereign&mdash;has passed away. In my <lb/>
youth the monarchs of England had <lb/>
ceased to touch for the evil, but there <lb/>
was no occasion for this diffidence: they could <lb/>
have cured it forty-nine times in fifty.</p>
<p>Well, when the priest had been droning for <lb/>
three hours, and the good king <reg orig="polish-|ing">polishing</reg> <lb/>
the evidences, and the sick were <lb/>
still pressing forward as plenty as <lb/>
ever, I got to feeling intolerably bored. <lb/>
I was sitting by an open window not <lb/>
far from the canopy of state. For the five <lb/>
hundredth time a patient stood forward <lb/>
to have his repulsivenesses stroked; <lb/>
again those words were being <reg orig="dron-|ed">droned</reg> <lb/>
out: "they shall lay their hands on the sick"&mdash;when outside there <lb/>
rang clear as a clarion a note that enchanted my soul and tumbled <lb/>
thirteen worthless centuries about my ears: "Camelot <hi rend="italic">Weekly Hosan-</hi> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">nah and Literary Volcano!</hi>&mdash;latest irruption&mdash;only two cents&mdash;all <lb/>
about the big miracle in the Valley of Holiness!" One greater than <lb/>
kings had arrived&mdash;the newsboy. But I was the only person in all <lb/>
that throng who knew the meaning of this mighty birth, and what this <lb/>
imperial magician was come into the world to do.</p>

that. There is a profound monotonousness about its facts that <lb/>
baffles and defeats one's sincerest efforts to make them sparkle and <lb/>
<pb n="342" entity="DSSR_000002494_0353"/>
enthuse. The best way to manage&mdash;in fact, the only sensible way&mdash;is <lb/>
to disguise repetitiousness of fact under variety of form: skin your fact <lb/>
each time and lay on a new cuticle of words. It deceives the eye; you <lb/>
think it is a new fact; it gives you the idea that the court is carrying <lb/>
on like everything; this excites you, and you drain the whole column, <lb/>
with a good appetite, and perhaps never notice that it's a barrel of soup <lb/>
made out of a single bean. Clarence's way was good, it was simple, it <lb/>

<p>However, take the paper by and large, I was vastly pleased with it. <lb/>
Little crudities of a mechanical sort were observable here and there, <lb/>
but there were not enough of them to amount to anything, and it was <lb/>
good enough Arkansas proof-reading, anyhow, and better than was <lb/>
needed in Arthur's day and realm. As a rule, the grammar was leaky <lb/>
and the construction more or less lame; but I did not much mind these <lb/>
things. They are common defects of my own, and one mustn't criticise <lb/>

<p>I was hungry enough for literature to want to take down the whole <lb/>

<pb n="343" entity="DSSR_000002494_0354"/>
think, and won't the rain injure it? Is it writing that appears on it, or <lb/>
is it only ornamentation? They suspected it was writing, because those <lb/>
among them who knew how to read Latin and had a smattering of <lb/>
Greek, recognized some of the letters, but they could make nothing <lb/>
out of the result as a whole. I put my information <lb/>

<p>"It is a public journal; I will explain what that <lb/>

this, in every <lb/>
minute detail&mdash;they can't be told apart." Then they all broke out <lb/>
with exclamations of surprise and admiration:</p>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f130" entity="DSSR_000002494_0354">
  <head>SOLID COMFORT.</head>

<p>"A thousand! Verily a mighty work&mdash;a year's work for many <lb/>
men."</p>
<p>"No&mdash;merely a day's work for a man and a boy."</p>
<p>They crossed themselves, and whiffed out a protective prayer or two.</p>
<pb n="344" entity="DSSR_000002494_0355"/>
<p>"Ah-h&mdash;a miracle, a wonder! Dark work of enchantment."</p>
<p>I let it go at that. Then I read in a low voice, to as many as could <lb/>
crowd their shaven heads within hearing distance, part of the account <lb/>
of the miracle of the restoration of the well, and was accompanied by <lb/>
astonished and reverent ejaculations all through: "Ah-h-h!" "How <lb/>
true!" "Amazing, amazing!" "These be the very haps as they <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg>, <lb/>
in marvelous exactness!" And might they take this strange <lb/>
thing in their hands, and feel of it and examine it?&mdash;they would be <lb/>
very careful. Yes. So they took it, handling it as cautiously and <reg orig="de-|voutly">devoutly</reg> <lb/>
as if it had been some holy thing come from some supernatural <lb/>
region; and gently felt of its texture, caressed its pleasant smooth <reg orig="sur-|face">surface</reg> <lb/>
with lingering touch, and scanned the mysterious characters with <lb/>
fascinated eyes. These grouped bent heads, these charmed faces, these <lb/>
speaking eyes&mdash;how beautiful to me! For was not this my darling, and <lb/>
was not all this mute wonder and interest and homage a most eloquent <lb/>
tribute and unforced compliment to it? I knew, then, how a mother <lb/>
feels when women, whether strangers or friends, take her new baby, <lb/>
and close themselves about it with one eager impulse, and bend their <lb/>
heads over it in a tranced adoration that makes all the rest of the <reg orig="uni-|verse">universe</reg> <lb/>
vanish out of their consciousness and be as if it were not, for that <lb/>
time. I knew how she feels, and that there is no other satisfied <reg orig="ambi-|tion">ambition</reg>, <lb/>
whether of king, conqueror or poet, that ever reaches half way to <lb/>
that serene far summit or yields half so divine a contentment.</p>
<p>During all the rest of the s&eacute;ance my paper traveled from group to <lb/>
group all up and down and about that huge hall, and my happy eye <lb/>
was upon it always, and I sat motionless, steeped in satisfaction, drunk <lb/>
with enjoyment. Yes, this was heaven; I was tasting it once, if I <lb/>
might never taste it more.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVII.<lb/> THE YANKEE AND THE KING TRAVEL INCOGNITO.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">About</hi> bedtime I took the king to my private <lb/>
quarters to cut his hair and help him get the <lb/>
hang of the lowly raiment he was to wear. The <lb/>
high classes wore their hair banged across the <lb/>
forehead but hanging to the shoulders the rest <lb/>
of the way around, whereas the lowest ranks of <lb/>
commoners were banged fore and aft both; the <lb/>
slaves were bangless, and allowed their hair free <lb/>
growth. So I inverted a bowl over his head and cut <lb/>
away all the locks that hung below it. I also trimmed <lb/>
his whiskers and moustache until they were only <lb/>
about a half inch long; and tried to do it <reg orig="inartisti-|cally">inartistically</reg>, <lb/>
and succeeded. It was a villanous <reg orig="disfigure-|ment">disfigurement</reg>. <lb/>
When he got his lubberly sandals on, and <lb/>
his long robe of coarse brown linen cloth, which <lb/>
hung straight from his neck to his ankle-bones, he <lb/>
was no longer the comeliest man in his kingdom, <lb/>
but one of the unhandsomest and most <reg orig="com-|monplace">commonplace</reg> <lb/>
and unattractive. We were dressed <lb/>
and barbered alike, and could pass for small <lb/>
farmers, or farm bailiffs, or shepherds, or <reg orig="car-|ters">carters</reg>; <lb/>
yes, or for village artisans, if we chose, <lb/>
our costume being in effect universal among the poor, because of its <lb/>
strength and cheapness. I don't mean that it was really cheap to a <lb/>

<pb n="348" entity="DSSR_000002494_0359"/>
very poor person, but I do mean that it was the cheapest <reg orig="ma-|terial">material</reg> <lb/>
there was for male attire&mdash;manufactured material, you <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg>.</p>
<p>We slipped away an hour before dawn, and by broad sun-up had <lb/>
made eight or ten miles, and were in the midst of a sparsely settled <lb/>
country. I had a pretty heavy knapsack; it was laden with provisions <lb/>
&mdash;provisions for the king to taper down on, till he could take to the <lb/>
coarse fare of the country without damage.</p>
<p>I found a comfortable seat for the king by the roadside, and then <lb/>
gave him a morsel or two to stay his stomach with. Then I said I <lb/>
would find some water for him, and strolled away. Part of my project <lb/>
was to get out of sight and sit down and rest a little myself. It had <lb/>
always been my custom to stand, when in his presence; even at the <lb/>
council board, except upon those rare occasions when the sitting was <lb/>
a very long one, extending over hours; then I had a trifling little <reg orig="back-|less">backless</reg> <lb/>
thing which was like a reversed culvert and was as comfortable as <lb/>
the toothache. I didn't want to break him in suddenly, but do it by <lb/>
degrees. We should have to sit together now when in company, or <lb/>
people would notice; but it would not be good politics for me to be <lb/>
playing equality with him when there was no necessity for it.</p>
<p>I found the water, some three hundred yards away, and had been <lb/>
resting about twenty minutes, when I heard voices. That is all right, <lb/>
I thought&mdash;peasants going to work; nobody else likely to be stirring <lb/>
this early. But the next moment these comers jingled into sight <lb/>
around a turn of the road&mdash;smartly clad people of quality, with <reg orig="lug-|gage-mules">luggage-mules</reg> <lb/>
and servants in their train! I was off like a shot, through <lb/>
the bushes, by the shortest cut. For a while it did seem that these <lb/>
people would pass the king before I could get to him; but desperation <lb/>
gives you wings, you know, and I canted my body forward, inflated my <lb/>
breast, and held my breath and flew. I arrived. And in plenty good <lb/>
enough time, too.</p>
<pb n="349" entity="DSSR_000002494_0360"/>
<p>"Pardon, my king, but it's no time for ceremony&mdash;jump! Jump to <lb/>
your feet&mdash;some quality are coming!"</p>
<p>"Is that a marvel? Let them come."</p>
<p>"But my liege! You must not be seen sitting. Rise!&mdash;and stand <lb/>
in humble posture while they pass. You are a peasant, you know."</p>
<p>"True&mdash;I had forgot it, so lost was I in planning of a huge war <lb/>
with Gaul"&mdash;he was up by this time, but a farm could have got up <lb/>
quicker, if there was any kind of a boom in real estate&mdash;"and <lb/>
right-so a thought came randoming overthwart this majestic dream <lb/>
the which&mdash;"</p>
<p>"A humbler attitude, my lord the king&mdash;and quick! Duck your <lb/>
head!&mdash;more!&mdash;still more!&mdash;droop it!"</p>
<p>He did his honest best, but lord it was no great things. He looked <lb/>
as humble as the leaning tower at Pisa. It is the most you could say <lb/>
of it. Indeed it was such a thundering poor success that it raised <reg orig="won-|dering">wondering</reg> <lb/>
scowls all along the line, and a gorgeous flunkey at the tail end <lb/>
of it raised his whip; but I jumped in time and was under it when it <lb/>
fell; and under cover of the volley of coarse laughter which followed, I <lb/>
spoke up sharply and warned the king to take no notice. He <reg orig="mas-|tered">mastered</reg> <lb/>
himself for the moment, but it was a sore tax; he wanted to eat <lb/>
up the procession. I said:</p>
<p>"It would end our adventures at the very start; and we, being <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
weapons, could do nothing with that armed gang. If we are going <lb/>
to succeed in our emprise, we must not only look the peasant but act <lb/>
the peasant."</p>
<p>"It is wisdom; none can gainsay it. Let us go on, Sir Boss. I will <lb/>
take note and learn, and do the best I may."</p>
<p>He kept his word. He did the best he could, but I've seen better. <lb/>
If you have ever seen an active, heedless, enterprising child going <reg orig="dili-|gently">diligently</reg> <lb/>
out of one mischief and into another all day long, and an <reg orig="anx-|ious">anxious</reg> <lb/>
mother at its heels all the while, and just saving it by a hair from <lb/>
<pb n="350" entity="DSSR_000002494_0361"/>
drowning itself or breaking its neck with each new experiment, you've <lb/>
seen the king and me.</p>
<p>If I could have foreseen what the thing was going to be like, I <lb/>
should have said, No, if anybody wants to make his living exhibiting <lb/>
a king as a peasant, let him take the layout; I can do better with a <lb/>
menagerie, and last longer. And yet, during the first three days I <lb/>
never allowed him to enter a hut or other dwelling. If he could pass <lb/>
muster anywhere, during his early noviciate, it would be in small inns <lb/>
and on the road; so to these places we confined ourselves. Yes, he <lb/>
certainly did the best he could, but what of that? He didn't improve <lb/>
a bit that I could see.</p>
<p>He was always frightening me, always breaking out with fresh <lb/>
astonishers, in new and unexpected places. Toward evening on the <lb/>
second day, what does he do but blandly fetch out a dirk from inside <lb/>
his robe!</p>
<p>"Great guns, my liege, where did you get that?"</p>
<p>"From a smuggler at the inn, yester eve."</p>
<p>"What in the world possessed you to buy it?"</p>
<p>"We have escaped divers dangers by wit&mdash;thy wit&mdash;but I have <lb/>
bethought me that it were but prudence if I bore a weapon, too. Thine <lb/>
might fail thee in some pinch."</p>
<p>"But people of our condition are not allowed to carry arms. What <lb/>
would a lord say&mdash;yes, or any other person of whatever condition&mdash;if <lb/>
he caught an upstart peasant with a dagger on his person?"</p>
<p>It was a lucky thing for us that nobody came along just then. I <lb/>
persuaded him to throw the dirk away; and it was as easy as <reg orig="persuad-|ing">persuading</reg> <lb/>
a child to give up some bright fresh new way of killing itself. We <lb/>
walked along, silent and thinking. Finally the king said:</p>
<p>"When ye know that I meditate a thing inconvenient, or that hath <lb/>
a peril in it, why do you not warn me to cease from that project?"</p>
<p>It was a startling question, and a puzzler. I didn't quite know how <lb/>
<pb n="351" entity="DSSR_000002494_0362"/>
to take hold of it, or what to say, and so of course I ended by saying <lb/>
the natural thing:</p>
<p>"But sire, how can <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know what your thoughts are?"</p>
<p>The king stopped dead in his tracks, and stared at me.</p>
<p>"I believed thou wert greater than Merlin; and truly in magic thou <lb/>
art. But prophecy is greater than magic. Merlin is a prophet."</p>
<p>I saw I had made a blunder. I must get back my lost ground. <lb/>
After deep reflection and careful planning, I said:</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f133" entity="DSSR_000002494_0362">
  <head>"WHY DO YE NOT WARN ME TO CEASE?"</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="352" entity="DSSR_000002494_0363"/>
<p>"Sire, I have been misunderstood. I will explain. There are <lb/>
two kinds of prophecy. One is the gift to foretell things that <lb/>
are but a little way off, the other is the gift to foretell things that <lb/>
are whole ages and centuries away. Which is the mightier gift, <lb/>
do you think?"</p>
<p>"Oh, the last, most surely!"</p>
<p>"True. Does Merlin possess it?"</p>
<p>"Partly, yes. He foretold mysteries about my birth and future <lb/>
kingship that were twenty years away."</p>
<p>"Has he ever gone beyond that?"</p>
<p>"He would not claim more, I think."</p>
<p>"It is probably his limit. All prophets have their limit. The limit <lb/>
of some of the great prophets has been a hundred years."</p>
<p>"These are few, I ween."</p>
<p>"There have been two still greater ones, whose limit was four <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
and six hundred years, and one whose limit compassed even seven <lb/>
hundred and twenty."</p>
<p>"Gramercy, it is marvelous!"</p>
<p>"But what are these in comparison with me? They are nothing."</p>
<p>"What? Canst thou truly look beyond even so vast a stretch of <lb/>
time as&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Seven hundred years? My liege, as clear as the vision of an <lb/>
eagle does my prophetic eye penetrate and lay bare the future of this <lb/>
world for nearly thirteen centuries and a half!"</p>
<p>My land, you should have seen the king's eyes spread slowly open, <lb/>
and lift the earth's entire atmosphere as much as an inch! That <reg orig="set-|tled">settled</reg> <lb/>
Brer Merlin. One never had any occasion to prove his facts, with <lb/>
these people; all he had to do was to state them. It never occurred <lb/>
to anybody to doubt the statement.</p>
<p>"Now, then," I continued, "I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> work both kinds of prophecy&mdash; <lb/>
the long and the short&mdash;if I chose to take the trouble to keep in <reg orig="prac-|tice">practice</reg>; <lb/>
<pb n="353" entity="DSSR_000002494_0364"/>
but I seldom exercise any but the long kind, because the other <lb/>
is beneath my dignity. It is properer to Merlin's sort&mdash;stump-tail <lb/>
prophets, as we call them in the profession. Of course I whet up now <lb/>
and then and flirt out a minor prophecy, but not often&mdash;hardly <lb/>
ever, in fact. You will remember that there was great talk, when <lb/>
you reached the Valley of Holiness, about my having prophecied <lb/>
your coming and the very hour of your arrival, two or three days <lb/>
beforehand."</p>
<p>"Indeed, yes, I mind it now."</p>
<p>"Well, I could have done it as much as forty times easier, and <lb/>
piled on a thousand times more detail into the bargain, if it had been <lb/>
five hundred years away instead of two or three days."</p>
<p>"How amazing that it should be so!"</p>
<p>"Yes, a genuine expert can always foretell a thing that is five <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
years away easier than he can a thing that's only five hundred <lb/>
seconds off."</p>
<p>"And yet in reason it should clearly be the other way: it should <lb/>
be five hundred times as easy to foretell the last as the first, for indeed <lb/>
it is so close by that one uninspired might almost see it. In truth the <lb/>
law of prophecy doth contradict the likelihoods, most strangely <reg orig="mak-|ing">making</reg> <lb/>
the difficult easy, and the easy difficult."</p>
<p>It was a wise head. A peasant's cap was no safe disguise for it; <lb/>
you could know it for a king's, under a diving bell, if you could hear it <lb/>
work its intellect.</p>
<p>I had a new trade, now, and plenty of business in it. The king <lb/>
was as hungry to find out everything that was going to happen <lb/>
during the next thirteen centuries as if he were expecting to live <lb/>
in them. From that time out, I prophecied myself bald-headed <reg orig="try-|ing">trying</reg> <lb/>
to supply the demand. I have done some indiscreet things in <lb/>
my day, but this thing of playing myself for a prophet was the <lb/>
worst. Still, it had its ameliorations. A prophet doesn't have to <lb/>
<pb n="354" entity="DSSR_000002494_0365"/>
have any brains. They are good to have, of course, for the ordinary <lb/>
exigencies of life, but they are no use in professional work. It is <lb/>
the restfulest vocation there is. When the spirit of prophecy comes <lb/>
upon you, you merely cake your intellect and lay it off in a cool <lb/>
place for a rest, and unship your jaw and leave it alone; it will work <lb/>
itself: the result is prophecy.</p>
<p>Every day a knight errant or so came along, and the sight of them <lb/>
fired the king's martial spirit every time. He would have forgotten <lb/>
himself, sure, and said something to them in a style a suspicious shade <lb/>
or so above his ostensible degree, and so I always got him well out of <lb/>
the road in time. Then he would stand, and look with all his eyes; <lb/>
and a proud light would flash from them, and his nostrils would inflate <lb/>
like a war-horse's, and I knew he was longing for a brush with them. <lb/>
But about noon of the third day I had stopped in the road to take a <lb/>
precaution which had been suggested by the whip-stroke that had <reg orig="fal-|len">fallen</reg> <lb/>
to my share two days before; a precaution which I had afterward <lb/>
decided to leave untaken, I was so loath to institute it; but now I had <lb/>
just had a fresh reminder: while striding heedlessly along, with jaw <lb/>
spread and intellect at rest, for I was prophecying, I stubbed my toe <lb/>
and fell sprawling. I was so pale I couldn't think, for a moment; then <lb/>
I got softly and carefully up and unstrapped my knapsack. I had that <lb/>
dynamite bomb in it, done up in wool, in a box. It was a good thing <lb/>
to have along; the time would come when I could do a valuable <reg orig="mira-|cle">miracle</reg> <lb/>
with it, maybe, but it was a nervous thing to have about me, and I <lb/>
didn't like to ask the king to carry it. Yet I must either throw it away <lb/>
or think up some safe way to get along with its society. I got it out <lb/>
and slipped it into my scrip, and just then, here came a couple of <lb/>
knights. The king stood, stately as a statue, gazing toward them&mdash; <lb/>
had forgotten himself again, of course&mdash;and before I could get a word <lb/>
of warning out, it was time for him to skip, and well that he did it, too. <lb/>
He supposed they would turn aside. Turn aside to avoid trampling <lb/>
<pb n="355" entity="DSSR_000002494_0366"/>
peasant dirt under foot? When had he ever turned aside himself&mdash;or <lb/>
ever had the chance to do it, if a peasant saw him or any other noble <lb/>
knight in time to judiciously save him the trouble? The knights paid <lb/>
no attention to the king at all; it was his place to look out himself, and <lb/>
if he hadn't skipped he would have been placidly ridden down, and <lb/>
laughed at besides.</p>
<p>The king was in a flaming fury, and launched out his challenge <lb/>
and epithets with a most royal vigor. The knights were some little <lb/>
distance by, now. They halted, greatly surprised, and turned in their <lb/>
saddles and looked back, as if wondering if it might be worth while <lb/>
to bother with such scum as we. Then they wheeled and started for us. <lb/>
Not a moment must be lost. I started for <hi rend="italic">them.</hi> I passed them at a <lb/>
rattling gait, and as I went by I flung out a hair-lifting soul-scorching <lb/>
thirteen-jointed insult which made the king's effort poor and cheap by <lb/>
comparison. I got it out of the nineteenth century where they know <lb/>
how. They had such headway that they were nearly to the king <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
they could check up; then, frantic with rage, they stood up their <lb/>
horses on their hind hoofs and whirled them around, and the next <lb/>
moment here they came, breast to breast. I was seventy yards off, <lb/>
then, and scrambling up a great boulder at the roadside. When they <lb/>
were within thirty yards of me they let their long lances droop to a <lb/>
level, depressed their mailed heads, and so, with their horse-hair <lb/>
plumes streaming straight out behind, most gallant to see, this <reg orig="light-|ning">lightning</reg> <lb/>
express came tearing for me! When they were within fifteen yards, <lb/>
I sent that bomb with a sure aim, and it struck the ground just under <lb/>
the horses' noses.</p>
<p>Yes, it was a neat thing, very neat and pretty to see. It resembled <lb/>
a steamboat explosion on the Mississippi; and during the next fifteen <lb/>
minutes we stood under a steady drizzle of microscopic fragments of <lb/>
knights and hardware and horse-flesh. I say we, for the king joined <lb/>
the audience, of course, as soon as he had got his breath again. There <lb/>
<pb n="356" entity="DSSR_000002494_0367"/>
was a hole there which would afford steady work for all the people in <lb/>
that region for some years to come&mdash;in trying to explain it, I mean; as <lb/>
for filling it up, that service would be comparatively prompt, and would <lb/>
fall to the lot of a select few&mdash;peasants of that seignory; and they <lb/>
wouldn't get anything for it, either.</p>
<p>But I explained it to the king myself. I said it was done with a <lb/>
 <figure rend="block" id="f134" entity="DSSR_000002494_0367">
  <head>ANOTHER MIRACLE.</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="357" entity="DSSR_000002494_0368"/>
dynamite bomb. This information did him no damage, because it left <lb/>
him as intelligent as he was before. However, it was a noble miracle, <lb/>
in his eyes, and was another settler for Merlin. I thought it well <lb/>
enough to explain that this was a miracle of so rare a sort that it <lb/>
couldn't be done except when the atmospheric conditions were just <lb/>
right. Otherwise he would be encoring it every time we had a good <lb/>
subject, and that would be inconvenient, because I hadn't any more <lb/>
bombs along.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVIII.<lb/> DRILLING THE KING.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">On</hi> the morning of the fourth day, when it was just <lb/>
sunrise, and we had been tramping an hour <lb/>
in the chill dawn, I came to a resolution: the <lb/>
king <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be drilled; things could not go on <lb/>
so, he must be taken in hand and deliberately <lb/>
and conscientiously drilled, or we couldn't ever <lb/>
venture to enter a dwelling; the very cats would know <lb/>
this masquerader for a humbug and no peasant. So I <lb/>
called a halt and said:</p>
<p>"Sire, as between clothes and countenance, you are <lb/>
all right, there is no discrepancy; but as between your <lb/>
clothes and your bearing, you are all wrong, there is a <lb/>
most noticeable discrepancy. Your soldierly stride, your <lb/>
lordly port&mdash;these will not do. You stand too straight, <lb/>
your looks are too high, too confident. The cares of a <lb/>
kingdom do not stoop the shoulders, they do not droop <lb/>
the chin, they do not depress the high level of the <reg orig="eye-|glance">eyeglance</reg>, <lb/>
they do not put doubt and fear in the heart and <lb/>
hang out the signs of them in slouching body and unsure <lb/>
step. It is the sordid cares of the lowly born that do these <lb/>
things. You must learn the trick; you must imitate the <lb/>
trade-marks of poverty, misery, oppression, insult, and the other <reg orig="sev-|eral">several</reg> <lb/>
and common inhumanities that sap the manliness out of a man <lb/>
and make him a loyal and proper and approved subject and a <reg orig="satisfac-|tion">satisfaction</reg> <lb/>

to his masters, or the very infants will know you for better than <lb/>
your disguise, and we shall go to pieces at the first hut we stop at. <lb/>
Pray try to walk like this."</p>
<p>The king took careful note, and then tried an imitation.</p>
<p>"Pretty fair&mdash;pretty fair. Chin a little lower, please&mdash;there, very <lb/>
good. Eyes too high; pray don't look at the horizon, look at the <lb/>
ground, ten steps in front of you. Ah&mdash;that is better, that is very <lb/>

except that it don't delude."</p>
<pb n="363" entity="DSSR_000002494_0374"/>
<p>"What then, must one do, to prevail?"</p>
<p>"Let me think . . . . . I can't seem to quite get at it. In fact there <lb/>
isn't anything that can right the matter but practice. This is a good <lb/>
place for it: roots and stony ground to break up your stately gait, a <lb/>
region not liable to interruption, only one field and one hut in sight, and <lb/>
they so far away that nobody could see us from there. It will be well <lb/>
to move a little off the road and put in the whole day drilling you, sire."</p>
<p>After the drill had gone on a little while, I said:</p>
<p>"Now, sire, imagine that we are at the door of the hut yonder, and <lb/>
the family are before us. Proceed, please&mdash;accost the head of the house."</p>

  <head>"BROTHER!&mdash;TO DIRT <lb/>

 </figure>
<p>The king unconsciously straightened up like a monument, and said, <lb/>
with frozen austerity:</p>
<p>"Varlet, bring a seat; and serve to me what cheer ye have."</p>
<p>"Ah, your grace, that is not well done."</p>
<p>"In what lacketh it?"</p>
<p>"These people do not call <hi rend="italic">each other</hi> varlets."</p>
<p>"Nay, is that true?"</p>
<p>"Yes; only those above them call them so."</p>
<p>"Then must I try again. I will call him villein."</p>
<p>"No-no; for he may be a freeman."</p>
<pb n="364" entity="DSSR_000002494_0375"/>
<p>"Ah&mdash;so. Then peradventure I should call him goodman."</p>
<p>"That would answer, your grace, but it would be still better if you <lb/>
said friend, or brother."</p>
<p>"Brother!&mdash;to dirt like that?"</p>
<p>"Ah, but <hi rend="italic">we</hi> are pretending to be dirt like that, too."</p>
<p>"It is even true. I will say it. Brother, bring a seat, and thereto <lb/>
what cheer ye have, withal. <hi rend="italic">Now</hi> 'tis right."</p>
<p>"Not quite, not wholly right. You have asked for one, not <hi rend="italic">us</hi>&mdash; <lb/>
for one, not both; food for one, a seat for one."</p>
<p>The king looked puzzled&mdash;he wasn't a very heavy weight, <reg orig="intellect-|ually">intellectually</reg>. <lb/>
His head was an hour-glass; it could stow an idea, but it had <lb/>
to do it a grain at a time, not the whole idea at once.</p>
<p>"Would <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have a seat also&mdash;and sit?"</p>
<p>"If I did not sit, the man would perceive that we were only <reg orig="pre-|tending">pretending</reg> <lb/>
to be equals&mdash;and playing the deception pretty poorly, too."</p>
<p>"It is well and truly said! How wonderful is truth, come it in <lb/>
whatsoever unexpected form it may! Yes, he must bring out seats <lb/>
and food for both, and in serving us present not ewer and napkin with <lb/>
more show of respect to the one than to the other."</p>
<p>"And there is even yet a detail that needs correcting. He must <lb/>
bring nothing outside;&mdash;we will go in&mdash;in among the dirt, and possibly <lb/>
other repulsive things,&mdash;and take the food with the household, and <lb/>
after the fashion of the house, and all on equal terms, except the man <lb/>
be of the serf class; and finally, there will be no ewer and no napkin, <lb/>
whether he be serf or free. Please walk again, my liege. There&mdash;it <lb/>
is better&mdash;it is the best yet; but not perfect. The shoulders have <lb/>
known no ignobler burden than iron mail, and they will not stoop."</p>
<p>"Give me, then, the bag. I will learn the spirit that goeth with <lb/>
burdens that have not honor. It is the spirit that stoopeth the <reg orig="shoul-|ders">shoulders</reg>, <lb/>
I ween, and not the weight; for armor is heavy, yet it is a proud <lb/>
burden, and a man standeth straight in it. . . . . . Nay, but me no <lb/>
<pb n="365" entity="DSSR_000002494_0376"/>
buts, offer me no objections. I will <lb/>
have the thing. Strap it upon my back." <lb/></p>
<p>He was complete, now, with that <lb/>
knapsack on, and looked as little like <lb/>
a king as any man I had ever seen. <lb/>
But it was an obstinate pair of <reg orig="shoul-|ders">shoulders</reg>; <lb/>
they could not seem to learn the <lb/>
trick of stooping with any sort of <lb/>
deceptive naturalness. The drill <lb/>
went on, I prompting <lb/>
and correcting: <lb/></p>
<p>"Now, make <reg orig="be-|lieve">believe</reg> <lb/>

and eaten up by relentless creditors; you are out of work&mdash;which is <lb/>
horse-shoeing, let us say&mdash;and can get none; and your wife is sick, <lb/>
your children are crying because they are hungry&mdash;"</p>
<p>And so on, and so on. I drilled him as representing in turn, all <lb/>
sorts of people out of luck and suffering dire privations and misfortunes. <lb/>
But lord it was only just words, words&mdash;they meant nothing in the <lb/>
world to him, I might just as well have whistled. Words realize <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg>, <lb/>
vivify nothing to you, unless you have suffered in your own person <lb/>
the thing which the words try to describe. There are wise people who <lb/>
talk ever so knowingly and complacently about "the working classes," <lb/>
and satisfy themselves that a day's hard intellectual work is very much <lb/>
harder than a day's hard manual toil, and is righteously entitled to <lb/>
much bigger pay. Why, they really think that, you know, because <lb/>
they know all about the one, but haven't tried the other. But I know <lb/>
all about both; and so far as I am concerned, there isn't money enough <lb/>
in the universe to hire me to swing a pick-axe thirty days, but I will <lb/>
do the hardest kind of intellectual work for just as near nothing as you <lb/>
can cipher it down&mdash;and I will be satisfied, too.</p>
<p>Intellectual "work" is misnamed; it is a pleasure, a dissipation, <lb/>
and is its own highest reward. The poorest paid architect, engineer, <lb/>
general, author, sculptor, painter, lecturer, advocate, legislator, actor, <lb/>
preacher, singer, is constructively in heaven when he is at work; and <lb/>
as for the magician with the fiddle-bow in his hand who sits in the <lb/>
midst of a great orchestra with the ebbing and flowing tides of divine <lb/>
sound washing over him&mdash;why, certainly, he is at work, if you wish to <lb/>
call it that, but lord, it's a sarcasm just the same. The law of work <lb/>
does seem utterly unfair&mdash;but there it is, and nothing can change it: <lb/>
the higher the pay in enjoyment the worker gets out of it, the higher <lb/>
shall be his pay in cash, also. And it's also the very law of those <lb/>
transparent swindles, transmissible nobility and kingship.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIX.<lb/> THE SMALL-POX HUT.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> we arrived at that hut at mid-afternoon, <lb/>
we saw no signs of life about it. The field <lb/>
near by had been denuded of its crop some <lb/>
time before, and had a skinned look, so <reg orig="ex-|haustively">exhaustively</reg> <lb/>
had it been harvested and gleaned. <lb/>
Fences, sheds, everything had a ruined <lb/>
look, and were eloquent of poverty. <lb/>
No animal was around anywhere, no <lb/>
living thing in sight. The stillness was awful, it was <lb/>
like the stillness of death. The cabin was a <reg orig="one-|story">one-story</reg> <lb/>
one, whose thatch was black with age, and <lb/>
ragged from lack of repair.</p>
<p>The door stood a trifle ajar. We <reg orig="ap-|proached">approached</reg> <lb/>
it stealthily&mdash;on <reg orig="tip-|toe">tiptoe</reg> <lb/>
and at half-breath&mdash;for <lb/>
that is the way one's feeling <lb/>
makes him do, at such a <lb/>
time. The king knocked. We <lb/>
waited. No answer. Knocked again. No <lb/>
answer. I pushed the door softly open and <lb/>
looked in. I made out some dim forms, <lb/>
and a woman started up from the <lb/>
ground and stared at me, as one <lb/>
does who is wakened from sleep. Presently she found her voice&mdash;</p>
<p>"Have mercy!" she pleaded. "All is taken, nothing is left."</p>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f141" entity="DSSR_000002494_0380"/>-->
<pb n="370" entity="DSSR_000002494_0381"/>
<p>"I have not come to take anything, poor woman."</p>
<p>"You are not a priest?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Nor come not from the lord of the manor?"</p>
<p>"No, I am a stranger."</p>
<p>"Oh, then, for the fear of God, who visits with misery and death <lb/>
such as be harmless, tarry not here, but fly! This place is under his <lb/>
curse&mdash;and his Church's."</p>
<p>"Let me come in and help you&mdash;you are sick and in trouble."</p>
<p>I was better used to the dim light, now. I could see her hollow <lb/>
eyes fixed upon me. I could see how emaciated she was.</p>
<p>"I tell you the place is under the Church's ban. Save yourself&mdash; <lb/>
and go, before some straggler see thee here, and report it."</p>
<p>"Give yourself no trouble about me; I don't care anything for the <lb/>
Church's curse. Let me help you."</p>
<p>"Now all good spirits&mdash;if there be any such&mdash;bless thee for that <lb/>
word. Would God I had a sup of water!&mdash;but hold, hold, forget I said <lb/>
it, and fly; for there is that here that even he that feareth not the <lb/>
Church must fear: this disease whereof we die. Leave us, thou brave, <lb/>
good stranger, and take with thee such whole and sincere blessing as <lb/>
them that be accursed can give."</p>
<p>But before this I had picked up a wooden bowl and was rushing <lb/>
past the king on my way to the brook. It was ten yards away. When <lb/>
I got back and entered, the king was within, and was opening the <reg orig="shut-|ter">shutter</reg> <lb/>
that closed the window-hole, to let in air and light. The place was <lb/>
full of a foul stench. I put the bowl to the woman's lips, and as she <lb/>
gripped it with her eager talons the shutter came open and a strong <lb/>
light flooded her face. Small-pox!</p>
<p>I sprang to the king, and said in his ear:</p>
<p>"Out of the door on the instant, sire! the woman is dying of that <lb/>
disease that wasted the skirts of Camelot two years ago."</p>
<pb n="371" entity="DSSR_000002494_0382"/>
<p>He did not budge.</p>
<p>"Of a truth I shall remain&mdash;and likewise help."</p>
<p>I whispered again:</p>
<p>"King, it must not be. You must go."</p>
<p>"Ye mean well, and ye speak not unwisely. But it were shame <lb/>
that a king should know fear, and shame that belted knight should <lb/>
withhold his hand where be such as need succor. Peace, I will not go. <lb/>
It is you who must go. The Church's ban is not upon me, but it <reg orig="for-|biddeth">forbiddeth</reg> <lb/>
you to be here, and she will deal with you with a heavy hand <lb/>
an word come to her of your trespass."</p>
<p>It was a desperate place for him to be in, and might cost him his <lb/>
life, but it was no use to argue with him. If he considered his knightly <lb/>
honor at stake here, that was the end of argument; he would stay, and <lb/>
nothing could prevent it; I was aware of that. And so I dropped the <lb/>
subject. The woman spoke:</p>
<p>"Fair sir, of your kindness will ye climb the ladder there, and <lb/>
bring me news of what ye find? Be not afraid to report, for times can <lb/>
come when even a mother's heart is past breaking&mdash;being already <lb/>
broke."</p>
<p>"Abide," said the king, "and give the woman to eat. I will go." <lb/>
And he put down the knapsack.</p>
<p>I turned to start but the king had already started. He halted, and <lb/>
looked down upon a man who lay in a dim light, and had not noticed <lb/>
us, thus far, or spoken.</p>
<p>"Is it your husband?" the king asked.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Is he asleep?"</p>
<p>"God be thanked for that one charity, yes&mdash;these three hours. <lb/>
Where shall I pay to the full, my gratitude! for my heart is bursting <lb/>
with it for that sleep he sleepeth now."</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<pb n="372" entity="DSSR_000002494_0383"/>
<p>"We will be careful. We will not wake him."</p>
<p>"Ah, no, that ye will not, for he is dead."</p>
<p>"Dead?"</p>
<p>"Yes, what triumph it is to know it! None can harm him, none <lb/>
insult him more. He is in heaven, now, and happy; or if not there, he <lb/>
bides in hell and is content; for in that place he will find neither abbot <lb/>
nor yet bishop. We were boy and girl together; we were man and <lb/>
wife these five and twenty years, and never separated till this day. <lb/>
Think how long that is, to love and suffer together. This morning was <lb/>
he out of his mind, and in his fancy we were boy and girl again and <lb/>
wandering in the happy fields; and so in that innocent glad converse <lb/>
wandered he far and farther, still lightly gossiping, and entered into <lb/>
those other fields we know not of, and was shut away from mortal <lb/>
sight. And so there was no parting, for in his fancy I went with him; <lb/>
he knew not but I went with him, my hand in his&mdash;my young soft <lb/>
hand, not this withered claw. Ah, yes, to go, and know it not; to <lb/>
separate and know it not; how could one go peacefuler than that? It <lb/>
was his reward for a cruel life patiently borne."</p>
<p>There was a slight noise from the direction of the dim corner where <lb/>
the ladder was. It was the king, descending. I could see that he was <lb/>
bearing something in one arm, and assisting himself with the other. <lb/>
He came forward into the light; upon his breast lay a slender girl of <lb/>
fifteen. She was but half conscious; she was dying of small-pox. <lb/>
Here was heroism at its last and loftiest possibility, its utmost summit; <lb/>
this was challenging death in the open field unarmed, with all the odds <lb/>
against the challenger, no reward set upon the contest, and no <reg orig="admir-|ing">admiring</reg> <lb/>
world in silks and cloth of gold to gaze and applaud; and yet the <lb/>
king's bearing was as serenely brave as it had always been in those <lb/>
cheaper contests where knight meets knight in equal fight and clothed <lb/>
in protecting steel. He was great, now; sublimely great. The rude <lb/>
statues of his ancestors in his palace should have an addition&mdash;I would <lb/>
<pb n="373" entity="DSSR_000002494_0384"/>
see to that; and it would not be a mailed king killing a giant or a <lb/>
dragon, like the rest, it would be a king in commoner's garb bearing <lb/>
death in his arms that a peasant mother <lb/>
might look her last upon her child and <lb/>
be comforted.</p>
<p>He laid the girl down by her mother, <lb/>
who poured out endearments and caresses <lb/>
from an overflowing heart, and one could <lb/>
detect a flickering faint light of response <lb/>
in the child's eyes, but that was all. The <lb/>
mother hung over her, kissing her, petting <lb/>
her, and imploring her to speak, but the <lb/>
lips only moved and no sound came. I <lb/>
snatched my liquor flask from my <reg orig="knap-|sack">knapsack</reg>, <lb/>
but the woman forbade me, and said: </p>
<p>"No&mdash;she does not suffer; it is better <lb/>
so. It might bring her back to life. <lb/>
None that be so good and kind as <lb/>
ye are, would do <lb/>
her that cruel hurt. <lb/>
For look you&mdash; <lb/>
what is left to live <lb/>
for? Her brothers <lb/>
are gone, her <reg orig="fath-|er">father</reg> <lb/>
is gone, her <reg orig="moth-|er">mother</reg> <lb/>
goeth, the <lb/>
Church's curse is <lb/>
upon her and none <lb/>
may shelter or <reg orig="be-|friend">befriend</reg> <lb/>
her even though she lay perishing in the road. She is <reg orig="deso-|late">desolate</reg>. <lb/>
I have not asked you, good heart, if her sister be still on live, <lb/>

here overhead; I had no need; ye had gone back, else, and not left <lb/>
the poor thing forsaken&mdash;"</p>
<p>"She lieth at peace," interrupted the king, in a subdued voice.</p>
<p>"I would not change it. How rich is this day in happiness! Ah, my <lb/>
Annis, thou shalt join thy sister soon&mdash;thou'rt on thy way, and these <lb/>
be merciful friends, that will not hinder."</p>
<p>And so she fell to murmuring and cooing over the girl again, and <lb/>
softly stroking her face and hair, and kissing her and calling her by <lb/>
endearing names; but there was scarcely sign of response, now, in the <lb/>
glazing eyes. I saw tears well from the king's eyes, and trickle down <lb/>
his face. The woman noticed them, too, and said:</p>
<p>"Ah, I know that sign: thou'st a wife at home, poor soul, and you <lb/>
and she have gone hungry to bed, many's the time, that the little ones <lb/>
might have your crust; you know what poverty is, and the daily insults <lb/>
of your betters, and the heavy hand of the Church and the king."</p>
<p>The king winced under this accidental home-shot, but kept still; <lb/>
he was learning his part; and he was playing it well, too, for a pretty <lb/>
dull beginner. I struck up a diversion. I offered the woman food and <lb/>
liquor, but she refused both. She would allow nothing to come between <lb/>
her and the release of death. Then I slipped away and brought the <lb/>
dead child from aloft, and laid it by her. This broke her down again, <lb/>
and there was another scene that was full of heart-break. By and by I <lb/>
made another diversion, and beguiled her to sketch her story.</p>
<p>"Ye know it well, yourselves, having suffered it&mdash;for truly none of <lb/>
our condition in Britain escape it. It is the old, weary tale. We fought <lb/>
and struggled and succeeded; meaning by success, that we lived and <lb/>
did not die; more than that is not to be claimed. No troubles came <lb/>
that we could not outlive, till this year brought them; then came they <lb/>
all at once, as one might say, and overwhelmed us. Years ago the <lb/>
lord of the manor planted certain fruit trees on our farm; in the best <lb/>
part of it, too&mdash;a grievous wrong and shame&mdash;"</p>
<pb n="375" entity="DSSR_000002494_0386"/>
<p>"But it was his right," interrupted the king.</p>
<p>"None denieth that, indeed; an the law mean anything, what is <lb/>
the lord's is his, and what is mine is his also. Our farm was ours by <lb/>
lease, therefore 'twas likewise his, to do with it as he would. Some <lb/>
little time ago, three of those trees were found hewn down. Our three <lb/>
grown sons ran frightened to report the crime. Well, in his lordship's <lb/>
dungeon there they lie, who saith there shall they lie and rot till they <lb/>
confess. They have naught to confess, being innocent, wherefore there <lb/>
will they remain until they die. Ye know that right well, I ween. <lb/>
Think how this left us; a man, a woman and two children, to gather a <lb/>
crop that was planted by so much greater force, yes, and protect it <lb/>
night and day from pigeons and prowling animals that be sacred and <lb/>
must not be hurt by any of our sort. When my lord's crop was nearly <lb/>
ready for the harvest, so also was ours; when his bell rang to call us <lb/>
to his fields to harvest his crops for nothing, he would not allow that I <lb/>
and my two girls should count for our three <lb/>
captive sons, but for only two of them; <lb/>
so, for the lacking one were we daily <lb/>
fined. All this time our own crop <lb/>
was perishing through neglect; and <lb/>
so both the priest and his lordship <lb/>
fined us because their shares <lb/>
of it were suffering through <lb/>
damage. In the end the fines <lb/>
ate up our crop&mdash;and they <lb/>
took it all; they took it <lb/>
all and made us harvest <lb/>
it for them, without pay <lb/>
or food, and we <reg orig="starv-|ing">starving</reg>. <lb/>
Then the worst came <lb/>
when I, being out of my <lb/>

mind with hunger and loss of my boys, and grief to see my husband and <lb/>
my little maids in rags and misery and despair, uttered a deep blasphemy <lb/>
&mdash;oh! a thousand of them!&mdash;against the Church and the Church's ways. <lb/>
It was ten days ago. I had fallen sick with this disease, and it was to <lb/>
the priest I said the words, for he was come to chide me for lack of due <lb/>
humility under the chastening hand of God. He carried my trespass <lb/>
to his betters; I was stubborn; wherefore, presently upon my head <lb/>
and upon all heads that were dear to me, fell the curse of Rome.</p>
<p>"Since that day, we are avoided, shunned with horror. None has <lb/>
come near this hut to know whether we live or not. The rest of us <lb/>
were taken down. Then I roused me and got up, as wife and mother <lb/>
will. It was little they could have eaten in any case; it was less than <lb/>
little they had to eat. But there was water, and I gave them that. <lb/>
How they craved it! and how they blessed it! But the end came <reg orig="yester-|day">yesterday</reg>; <lb/>
my strength broke down. Yesterday was the last time I ever saw <lb/>
my husband and this youngest child alive. I have lain here all these <lb/>
hours&mdash;these ages, ye may say&mdash;listening, listening, for any sound up <lb/>
there that&mdash;"</p>
<p>She gave a sharp quick glance at her eldest daughter, then cried <lb/>
out, "Oh, my darling!" and feebly gathered the stiffening form to her <lb/>
sheltering arms. She had recognized the death rattle.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">At</hi> midnight all was over, and we sat in the <lb/>
presence of four corpses. We covered <lb/>
them with such rags as we could find, <lb/>
and started away, fastening the door <reg orig="be-|hind">behind</reg> <lb/>
us. Their home must be these <lb/>
people's grave, for they could not have <lb/>

wild beasts, lepers, and no soul that <lb/>
valued its hope of eternal life would <lb/>
throw it away by meddling in any <lb/>

outcasts.</p>
<p>We had not moved four steps <lb/>
when I caught a sound as of <reg orig="foot-|steps">footsteps</reg> <lb/>
upon gravel. My heart <lb/>
flew to my throat. We must <lb/>
not be seen coming from that <lb/>
house. I plucked at the king's <lb/>
robe and we drew back and took <lb/>
shelter behind the corner <lb/>
of the cabin.</p>
<p>"Now we are safe," I <lb/>
said, "but it was a <lb/>
close call&mdash;so to speak. <lb/>

If the night had been lighter he might have seen us, no doubt, he <lb/>
seemed to be so near."</p>
<p>"Mayhap it is but a beast and not a man at all."</p>
<p>"True. But man or beast, it will be wise to stay here a minute <lb/>
and let it get by and out of the way."</p>
<p>"Hark! It cometh hither."</p>
<p>True again. The step was coming toward us&mdash;straight toward the <lb/>
hut. It must be a beast, then, and we might as well have saved our <lb/>
trepidation. I was going to step out, but the king laid his hand upon <lb/>
my arm. There was a moment of silence, then we heard a soft knock <lb/>
on the cabin door. It made me shiver. Presently the knock was <reg orig="re-|peated">repeated</reg>, <lb/>
and then we heard these words in a guarded voice:</p>
<p>"Mother! Father! Open&mdash;we have got free, and we bring news to <lb/>
pale your cheeks but glad your hearts; and we may not tarry, but must <lb/>
fly! And&mdash;but they answer not. Mother! father!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>I drew the king toward the other end of the hut and whispered:</p>
<p>"Come&mdash;now we can get to the road."</p>
<p>The king hesitated, was going to demur; but just then we heard <lb/>
the door give way, and knew that those desolate men were in the <reg orig="pres-|ence">presence</reg> <lb/>
of their dead.</p>
<p>"Come, my liege! in a moment they will strike a light, and then <lb/>
will follow that which it would break your heart to hear."</p>
<p>He did not hesitate this time. The moment we were in the road, I <lb/>
ran; and after a moment he threw dignity aside and followed. I did <lb/>
not want to think of what was happening in the hut&mdash;I couldn't bear <lb/>
it; I wanted to drive it out of my mind; so I struck into the first <reg orig="sub-|ject">subject</reg> <lb/>
that lay under that one in my mind:</p>
<p>"I have had the disease those people died of, and so have nothing <lb/>
to fear; but if you have not had it also&mdash;"</p>
<p>He broke in upon me to say he was in trouble, and it was his <reg orig="con-|science">conscience</reg> <lb/>
that was troubling him:</p>
<pb n="381" entity="DSSR_000002494_0392"/>
<p>"These young men have got free, they say&mdash;but <hi rend="italic">how?</hi> It is not <lb/>
likely that their lord hath set them free."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, I make no doubt they escaped."</p>
<p>"That is my trouble; I have a fear that this is so, and your <reg orig="suspi-|cion">suspicion</reg> <lb/>
doth confirm it, you having the same fear."</p>
<p>"I should not call it by that name though. I do suspect that they <lb/>
escaped, but if they did, I am not sorry, certainly."</p>
<p>"I am not sorry, I <hi rend="italic">think</hi>&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What is it? What is there for one to be troubled about?"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">If</hi> they did escape, then are we bound in duty to lay hands upon <lb/>
them and deliver them again to their lord; for it is not seemly that <lb/>
one of his quality should suffer a so insolent and high-handed outrage <lb/>
from persons of their base degree."</p>
<p>There it was, again. He could see only one side of it. He was <lb/>
born so, educated so, his veins were full of ancestral blood that was <lb/>
rotten with this sort of unconscious brutality, brought down by <reg orig="inherit-|ance">inheritance</reg> <lb/>
from a long procession of hearts that had each done its share <lb/>
toward poisoning the stream. To imprison these men without proof, <lb/>
and starve their kindred, was no harm, for they were merely <reg orig="peas-|ants">peasants</reg> <lb/>
and subject to the will and pleasure of their lord, no matter <lb/>
what fearful form it might take; but for these men to break out of <lb/>
unjust captivity was insult and outrage, and a thing not to be <reg orig="coun-|tenanced">countenanced</reg> <lb/>
by any conscientious person who knew his duty to his <lb/>
sacred caste.</p>
<p>I worked more than half an hour before I got him to change the <lb/>
subject&mdash;and even then an outside matter did it for me. This was a <lb/>
something which caught our eyes as we struck the summit of a small <lb/>
hill&mdash;a red glow, a good way off.</p>
<p>"That's a fire," said I.</p>
<p>Fires interested me considerably, because I was getting a good <lb/>
deal of an insurance business started, and was also training some <lb/>
<pb n="382" entity="DSSR_000002494_0393"/>
horses and building some steam fire engines, with an eye to a paid fire <lb/>
department by and by. The priests opposed both my fire and <reg orig="life-|insurance">life-insurance</reg>, <lb/>
on the ground that it was an insolent attempt to hinder the <lb/>
decrees of God; and if you pointed out that they did not hinder the <lb/>
decrees in the least, but only modified the hard consequences of them <lb/>
if you took out policies and had luck, they retorted that that was <lb/>
gambling against the decrees of God, and was just as bad. So they <lb/>
managed to damage those industries more or less, but I got even on <lb/>
my Accident business. As a rule, a knight is a lummux, and <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
even a labrick, and hence open to pretty poor arguments when <lb/>
they come glibly from a superstition-monger, but even <hi rend="italic">he</hi> could see <lb/>
the practical side of a thing once in a while; and so of late you couldn't <lb/>

clean up a tournament and pile the result without finding one of my <lb/>
accident-tickets in every helmet.</p>
<p>We stood there awhile, in the thick darkness and stillness, looking <lb/>
toward the red blur in the distance, and trying to make out the <reg orig="mean-|ing">meaning</reg> <lb/>
of a far away murmur that rose and fell fitfully on the night. <lb/>
Sometimes it swelled up and for a moment seemed less remote; but <lb/>
when we were hopefully expecting it to betray its cause and nature, it <lb/>
dulled and sank again, carrying its mystery with it. We started down <lb/>
the hill in its direction, and the winding road plunged us at once into <lb/>
almost solid darkness&mdash;darkness that was packed and crammed in <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
two tall forest walls. We groped along down for half a mile, <lb/>
perhaps, that murmur growing more and more distinct all the time, <lb/>
the coming storm threatening more and more, with now and then a <lb/>
little shiver of wind, a faint show of lightning, and dull grumblings of <lb/>
distant thunder. I was in the lead. I ran against something&mdash;a soft <lb/>
heavy something which gave, slightly, to the impulse of my weight; at <lb/>
the same moment the lightning glared out, and within a foot of my <lb/>
face was the writhing face of a man who was hanging from the limb of <lb/>
a tree! That is, it seemed to be writhing, but it was not. It was a <lb/>
grewsome sight. Straightway there was an ear-splitting explosion of <lb/>
thunder, and the bottom of heaven fell out; the rain poured down in <lb/>
a deluge. No matter, we must try to cut this man down, on the chance <lb/>
that there might be life in him yet, mustn't we? The lightning came <lb/>
quick and sharp, now, and the place was alternately noonday and <reg orig="mid-|night">midnight</reg>. <lb/>
One moment the man would be hanging before me in an <reg orig="in-|tense">intense</reg> <lb/>
light, and the next he was blotted out again in the darkness. I <lb/>
told the king we must cut him down. The king at once objected.</p>
<p>"If he hanged himself, he was willing to lose his property to his <lb/>
lord; so let him be. If others hanged him, belike they had the right <lb/>
&mdash;let him hang."</p>
<p>"But&mdash;"</p>
<pb n="384" entity="DSSR_000002494_0395"/>
<p>"But me no buts, but even leave him as he is. And for yet another <lb/>
reason. When the lightning cometh again&mdash;there, look abroad."</p>
<p>Two others hanging, within fifty yards of us!</p>
<p>"It is not weather meet for doing useless courtesies unto dead folk. <lb/>
They are past thanking you. Come&mdash;it is unprofitable to tarry here."</p>
<p>There was reason in what he said, so we moved on. Within the <lb/>
next mile we counted six more hanging forms by the blaze of the <lb/>
lightning, and altogether it was a grisly excursion. That murmur was <lb/>
a murmur no longer, it was a roar; a roar of men's voices. A man <lb/>
came flying by, now, dimly through the darkness, and other men <reg orig="chas-|ing">chasing</reg> <lb/>
him. They disappeared. Presently another case of the kind <reg orig="occur-|red">occurred</reg>, <lb/>
and then another and another. Then a sudden turn of the road <lb/>
brought us in sight of that fire&mdash;it was a large <lb/>
manor house, and little or nothing was left of it&mdash; <lb/>
and everywhere men were flying and other men <lb/>
raging after them in pursuit.</p>
<p>I warned the king that this was not a safe place <lb/>
for strangers. We would better get away from the <lb/>
light, until matters should improve. We stepped <lb/>
back a little, and hid in the edge of the wood. From this hiding place <lb/>
we saw both men and women hunted by the mob. The fearful work <lb/>
went on until nearly dawn. Then, the fire being out and the storm <lb/>
spent, the voices and flying footsteps presently ceased, and darkness <lb/>
and stillness reigned again.</p>
<p>We ventured out, and hurried cautiously away; and although we <lb/>
were worn out and sleepy, we kept on until we had put this place some <lb/>
miles behind us. Then we asked hospitality at the hut of a charcoal <lb/>
burner, and got what was to be had. A woman was up and about, but <lb/>
the man was still asleep, on a straw shake-down, on the clay floor. <lb/>
The woman seemed uneasy until I explained that we were travelers <lb/>
and had lost our way and been wandering in the woods all night. She <lb/>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f147" entity="DSSR_000002494_0395"/>-->
<pb n="385" entity="DSSR_000002494_0396"/>
became talkative, then, and asked if we had heard of the terrible <reg orig="go-|ings-on">goings-on</reg> <lb/>
at the manor house of Abblasoure. Yes, we had heard of them, <lb/>
but what we wanted now, was rest and sleep. The king broke in:</p>
<p>"Sell us the house and take yourselves away, for we be perilous <lb/>
company, being but late come from people that died of the Spotted <lb/>
Death."</p>
<p>It was good of him, but unnecessary. One of the commonest <reg orig="dec-|orations">decorations</reg> <lb/>
of the nation was the waffle-iron face. I had early noticed <lb/>
that the woman and her husband were both so decorated. She made <lb/>
us entirely welcome, and had no fears; and plainly she was immensely <lb/>
impressed by the king's proposition; for of course it was a good deal <lb/>
of an event in her life to run across a person of the king's humble <reg orig="ap-|pearance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
who was ready to buy a man's house for the sake of a night's <lb/>
lodging. It gave her a large respect for us, and she strained the lean <lb/>
possibilities of her hovel to their utmost to make us comfortable.</p>
<p>We slept till far into the afternoon, and then got up hungry enough <lb/>
to make cotter fare quite palatable to the king, the more particularly <lb/>
as it was scant in quantity. And also in variety; it consisted solely <lb/>
of onions, salt, and the national black bread&mdash;made out of horse-feed. <lb/>
The woman told us about the affair of the evening before. At ten or <lb/>
eleven at night, when everybody was in bed, the manor house burst <lb/>
into flames. The countryside swarmed to the rescue, and the family <lb/>
were saved, with one exception, the master. He did not appear. <lb/>
Everybody was frantic over this loss, and two brave yeomen sacrificed <lb/>
their lives in ransacking the burning house seeking that valuable <reg orig="per-|sonage">personage</reg>. <lb/>
But after a while he was found&mdash;what was left of him&mdash;which <lb/>
was his corpse. It was in a copse three hundred yards away, bound, <lb/>
gagged, stabbed in a dozen places.</p>
<p>Who had done this? Suspicion fell upon a humble family in the <lb/>
neighborhood who had been lately treated with peculiar harshness by <lb/>
the baron; and from these people the suspicion easily extended itself <lb/>
<pb n="386" entity="DSSR_000002494_0397"/>
to their relatives and familiars. A suspicion was enough; my lord's <lb/>
liveried retainers proclaimed an instant crusade against these people, <lb/>
and were promptly joined by the community in general. The woman's <lb/>
husband had been active with the mob, and had not returned home <lb/>
until nearly dawn. He was gone, now, to find out what the general <lb/>
result had been. While we were still talking, he came back from his <lb/>
quest. His report was revolting enough. Eighteen persons hanged <lb/>
or butchered, and two yeomen and thirteen prisoners lost in the fire.</p>
<p>"And how many prisoners were there altogether, in the vaults?"</p>
<p>"Thirteen."</p>
<p>"Then every one of them was lost."</p>
<p>"Yes, all."</p>
<p>"But the people arrived in time to save the family; how is it they <lb/>
could save none of the prisoners?"</p>
<p>The man looked puzzled, and said:</p>
<p>"Would one unlock the vaults at such a time? Marry, some would <lb/>
have escaped."</p>
<p>"Then you mean that nobody <hi rend="italic">did</hi> unlock them?"</p>
<p>"None went near them, either to lock or unlock. It standeth to <lb/>
reason that the bolts were fast; wherefore it was only needful to <reg orig="estab-|lish">establish</reg> <lb/>
a watch, so that if any broke the bonds he might not escape, but <lb/>
be taken. None were taken."</p>
<p>"Natheless, three did escape," said the king, "and ye will do well <lb/>
to publish it and set justice upon their track, for these murthered the <lb/>
baron and fired the house."</p>
<p>I was just expecting he would come out with that. For a moment <lb/>
the man and his wife showed an eager interest in this news and an <reg orig="im-|patience">impatience</reg> <lb/>
to go out and spread it; then a sudden something else <lb/>
betrayed itself in their faces, and they began to ask questions. I <reg orig="an-|swered">answered</reg> <lb/>
the questions myself, and narrowly watched the effects <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg>. <lb/>
I was soon satisfied that the knowledge of who these three <lb/>
<pb n="387" entity="DSSR_000002494_0398"/>
prisoners were, had somehow changed the atmosphere; that our hosts' <lb/>
continued eagerness to go and spread the news was now only <reg orig="pre-|tended">pretended</reg> <lb/>
and not real. The king did not notice the change, and I was <lb/>
glad of that. I worked the conversation around toward other details <lb/>
of the night's proceedings, and noted that these people were relieved <lb/>
to have it take that direction.</p>
<p>The painful thing observable about all this business was, the alacrity <lb/>
with which this oppressed community had turned their cruel hands <lb/>
against their own class in the interest of the common oppressor. This <lb/>
man and woman seemed to feel that in a quarrel between a person of <lb/>
their own class and his lord, it was the natural and proper and rightful <lb/>
thing for that poor devil's whole caste to side with the master and fight <lb/>
his battle for him, without ever stopping to inquire into the rights or <lb/>
wrongs of the matter. This man had been out helping to hang his <lb/>
neighbors, and had done his work with zeal, and yet was aware that <lb/>
there was nothing against them but a mere suspicion, with nothing <lb/>
back of it describable as evidence, still neither he nor his wife seemed <lb/>
to see anything horrible about it.</p>
<p>This was depressing&mdash;to a man with the dream of a republic in his <lb/>
head. It reminded me of a time thirteen centuries away, when the <lb/>
"poor whites" of our South who were always despised and frequently <lb/>
insulted, by the slave-lords around them, and who owed their base <lb/>
condition simply to the presence of slavery in their midst, were yet <lb/>
pusillanimously ready to side with slave-lords in all political moves for <lb/>
the upholding and perpetuating of slavery, and did also finally shoulder <lb/>
their muskets and pour out their lives in an effort to prevent the <reg orig="de-|struction">destruction</reg> <lb/>
of that very institution which degraded them. And there <lb/>
was only one redeeming feature connected with that pitiful piece of <lb/>
history; and that was, that secretly the "poor white" did detest the <lb/>
slave-lord, and did feel his own shame. That feeling was not brought <lb/>
to the surface, but the fact that it was there and could have been <lb/>
<pb n="388" entity="DSSR_000002494_0399"/>
brought out, under favoring circumstances, was something&mdash;in fact it <lb/>
was enough; for it showed that a man is at bottom a man, after all, <lb/>
even if it doesn't show on the outside.</p>
<p>Well, as it turned out, this charcoal burner was just the twin of the <lb/>
Southern "poor white" of the far future. The king presently showed <lb/>
impatience, and said:</p>
<p>"An ye prattle here all the day, justice will miscarry. Think ye <lb/>
the criminals will abide in their father's house? They are fleeing, they <lb/>
are not waiting. You should look to it that a party of horse be set <lb/>
upon their track."</p>
<p>The woman paled slightly, but quite perceptibly, and the man <lb/>
looked flustered and irresolute. I said:</p>
<p>"Come, friend, I will walk a little way with you, and explain which <lb/>
direction I think they would try to take. If they were merely resisters <lb/>
of the gabelle or some kindred absurdity I would try to protect them <lb/>
from capture; but when men murder a person of high degree and <reg orig="like-|wise">likewise</reg> <lb/>
burn his house, that is another matter."</p>
<p>The last remark was for the king&mdash;to quiet him. On the road the <lb/>
man pulled his resolution together, and began the march with a steady <lb/>
gait, but there was no eagerness in it. By and by I said:</p>
<p>"What relation were these men to you&mdash;cousins?"</p>
<p>He turned as white as his layer of charcoal would let him, and <lb/>
stopped, trembling.</p>
<p>"Ah, my God, how knew you that?"</p>
<p>"I didn't know it; it was a chance guess."</p>
<p>"Poor lads, they are lost. And good lads they were, too."</p>
<p>"Were you actually going yonder to tell on them?"</p>
<p>He didn't quite know how to take that; but he said, hesitatingly:</p>
<p>"Ye-s."</p>
<p>"Then I think you are a damned scoundrel!"</p>
<p>It made him as glad as if I had called him an angel.</p>
<pb n="389" entity="DSSR_000002494_0400"/>
<p>"Say the good words again, brother! for surely ye mean that ye <lb/>
would not betray me an I failed of my duty."</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f148" entity="DSSR_000002494_0400">
  <head>"A TREE IS KNOWN BY ITS FRUITS."</head>
 </figure>
<p>"Duty? There is no duty in the matter, except the duty to keep <lb/>
still and let those men get away, They've done a righteous deed."</p>
<pb n="390" entity="DSSR_000002494_0401"/>
<p>He looked pleased; pleased, and touched with apprehension at the <lb/>
same time. He looked up and down the road to see that no one was <lb/>
coming, and then said in a cautious voice: </p>
<p>"From what land come you, brother, that you speak such perilous <lb/>
words, and seem not to be afraid?"</p>
<p>"They are not perilous words when spoken to one of my own caste, <lb/>
I take it. You would not tell anybody I said them?"</p>
<p>"I? I would be drawn asunder by wild horses first."</p>
<p>"Well, then, let me say my say. I have no fears of your repeating <lb/>
it. I think devil's work has been done last night upon those innocent <lb/>
poor people. That old baron got only what he deserved. If I had my <lb/>
way, all his kind should have the same luck."</p>
<p>Fear and depression vanished from the man's manner, and <reg orig="grate-|fulness">gratefulness</reg> <lb/>
and a brave animation took their place:</p>
<p>"Even though you be a spy, and your words a trap for my <reg orig="undo-|ing">undoing</reg>, <lb/>
yet are they such refreshment that to hear them again and others <lb/>
like to them, I would go to the gallows happy, as having had one good <lb/>
feast at least in a starved life. And I will say my say, now, and ye <lb/>
may report it if ye be so minded. I helped to hang my neighbors for <lb/>
that it were peril to my own life to show lack of zeal in the master's <lb/>
cause; the others helped for none other reason. All rejoice to-day that <lb/>
he is dead, but all do go about seemingly sorrowing, and shedding the <lb/>
hypocrite's tear, for in that lies safety. I have said the words. I have <lb/>
said the words! the only ones that have ever tasted good in my mouth, <lb/>
and the reward of that taste is sufficient. Lead on, an ye will, be it <lb/>
even to the scaffold, for I am ready."</p>
<p>There it was, you see. A man <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a man, at bottom. Whole ages <lb/>
of abuse and oppression cannot crush the manhood clear out of him. <lb/>
Whoever thinks it a mistake, is himself mistaken. Yes, there is plenty <lb/>
good enough material for a republic in the most degraded people that <lb/>
ever existed&mdash;even the Russians; plenty of manhood in them&mdash;even in <lb/>
<pb n="391" entity="DSSR_000002494_0402"/>
the Germans&mdash;if one could but force it out of its timid and suspicious <lb/>
privacy, to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever <lb/>
was set up and any nobility that ever supported it. We should see <lb/>
certain things yet, let us hope and believe. First, a modified <reg orig="mon-|archy">monarchy</reg>, <lb/>
till Arthur's days were done, then the destruction of the throne, <lb/>
nobility abolished, every member of it bound out to some useful trade, <lb/>
universal suffrage instituted, and the whole government placed in the <lb/>
hands of the men and women of the nation there to remain. Yes, <lb/>
there was no occasion to give up my dream yet a while.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> strolled along in a sufficiently indolent <lb/>
fashion, now, and talked. We must <reg orig="dis-|pose">dispose</reg> <lb/>
of about the amount of time it ought <lb/>
to take to go to the little hamlet of <reg orig="Abbla-|soure">Abblasoure</reg> <lb/>
and put justice on the track of those <lb/>

meantime I had an auxiliary interest which <lb/>
had never paled yet, never lost its novelty for me, <lb/>
since I had been in Arthur's kingdom: the <reg orig="behav-|ior&mdash;born">behavior&mdash;born</reg> <lb/>
of nice and exact subdivisions of caste <lb/>
&mdash;of chance passers-by toward each other. <reg orig="Tow-|ard">Toward</reg> <lb/>
the shaven monk who trudged along with his <lb/>
cowl tilted back and the sweat washing down his <lb/>
fat jowls, the coal burner was deeply reverent; <lb/>
to the gentleman he was abject; with the small <lb/>
farmer and the free mechanic he was cordial <lb/>
and gossipy; and when a slave passed by with <lb/>
a countenance respectfully lowered, this chap's nose <lb/>
was in the air&mdash;he couldn't even see him. Well, <lb/>
there are times when one would like to hang the <lb/>
whole human race and finish the farce.</p>
<p>Presently we struck an incident. A small mob <lb/>
of half naked boys and girls came tearing out of the woods, scared <lb/>
and shrieking. The eldest among them were not more than twelve <lb/>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f150" entity="DSSR_000002494_0406"/>-->
<pb n="396" entity="DSSR_000002494_0407"/>
or fourteen years old. They implored help, but they were so beside <lb/>
themselves that we couldn't make out what the matter was. <reg orig="How-|ever">However</reg>, <lb/>
we plunged into the wood, they skurrying in the lead, and the <lb/>
trouble was quickly revealed: they had hanged a little fellow with a <lb/>
bark rope, and he was kicking and struggling, in the process of <reg orig="chok-|ing">choking</reg> <lb/>
to death. We rescued him, and fetched him around. It was some <lb/>
more human nature; the admiring little folk imitating their elders; <lb/>
they were playing mob, and had achieved a success which promised <lb/>
to be a good deal more serious than they had bargained for.</p>
<p>It was not a dull excursion for me. I managed to put in the time <lb/>
very well. I made various acquaintanceships, and in my quality of <lb/>
stranger was able to ask as many questions as I wanted to. A thing <lb/>
which naturally interested me, as a statesman, was the matter of wages. <lb/>
I picked up what I could under that head during the afternoon. A <lb/>
man who hasn't had much experience, and doesn't think, is apt to <lb/>
measure a nation's prosperity or lack of prosperity by the mere size of <lb/>
the prevailing wages: if the wages be high, the nation is prosperous; <lb/>
if low, it isn't. Which is an error. It isn't what sum you get, it's how <lb/>
much you can buy with it that's the important thing; and it's that that <lb/>
tells whether your wages are high in fact or only high in name. I <lb/>
could remember how it was in the time of our great civil war in the <lb/>
nineteenth century. In the North a carpenter got three dollars a day, <lb/>
gold valuation; in the South he got fifty&mdash;payable in Confederate <reg orig="shin-|plasters">shin-plasters</reg> <lb/>
worth a dollar a bushel. In the North a suit of over-alls cost <lb/>
three dollars&mdash;a day's wages; in the South it cost seventy-five&mdash;which <lb/>
was two day's wages. Other things were in proportion. Consequently, <lb/>
wages were twice as high in the North as they were in the South, <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
the one wage had that much more purchasing power that the <lb/>
other had.</p>
<p>Yes, I made various acquaintances in the hamlet, and a thing that <lb/>
gratified me a good deal was to find our new coins in circulation&mdash;lots <lb/>
<pb n="397" entity="DSSR_000002494_0408"/>
of milrays, lots of mills, lots of cents, a good many nickels, and some <lb/>
silver; all this among the artisans and commonalty generally; yes, and <lb/>
even some gold&mdash;but that was at the bank, that is to say, the <reg orig="gold-|smith's">goldsmith's</reg>. <lb/>
I dropped in there while Marco the son of Marco was <reg orig="hag-|gling">haggling</reg> <lb/>
with a shopkeeper over a quarter of a pound of salt, and asked <lb/>
for change for a twenty dollar gold piece. They furnished it&mdash;that is, <lb/>
after they had chewed the piece, and rung it on the counter, and tried <lb/>
acid on it, and asked me where I got it, and who I was, and where I <lb/>
was from, and where I was going to, and when I expected to get there, <lb/>
and perhaps a couple of hundred more questions; and when they got <lb/>
aground, I went right on and furnished them a lot of information <reg orig="vol-|untarily">voluntarily</reg>: <lb/>

first wife was a Free Will Baptist, and her grandfather was a <reg orig="Prohi-|bitionist">Prohibitionist</reg>, <lb/>
and I used to know a man who had two thumbs on each hand <lb/>
and a wart on the inside of his upper lip, and died in the hope of a <lb/>
glorious resurrection, and so-on, and so-on, and so-on, till even that <lb/>
hungry village questioner began to look satisfied, and also a shade put <lb/>
out; but he had to respect a man of my financial strength, and so he <lb/>
didn't give me any lip, but I noticed he took it out of his underlings, <lb/>
which was a perfectly natural thing to do. Yes, they changed my <lb/>
twenty, but I judged it strained the bank a little, which was a thing to <lb/>
be expected, for it was the same as walking into a paltry village store <lb/>
in the nineteenth century and requiring the boss of it to change a <reg orig="two-|thousand">two-thousand</reg> <lb/>
dollar bill for you all of a sudden. He could do it, maybe; <lb/>
but at the same time he would wonder how a small farmer happened <lb/>
to be carrying so much money around in his pocket; which was <reg orig="prob-|ably">probably</reg> <lb/>
this goldsmith's thought, too; for he followed me to the door and <lb/>
stood there gazing after me with reverent admiration.</p>
<p>Our new money was not only handsomely circulating, but its <reg orig="lan-|guage">language</reg> <lb/>
was already glibly in use; that is to say, people had dropped <lb/>
the names of the former moneys, and spoke of things as being worth <lb/>
so many dollars or cents or mills or milrays, now. It was very <reg orig="grati-|fying">gratifying</reg>. <lb/>
We were progressing, that was sure.</p>
<p>I got to know several master mechanics, but about the most <reg orig="inter-|esting">interesting</reg> <lb/>
fellow among them was the blacksmith, Dowley. He was a live <lb/>
man and a brisk talker, and had two journeymen and three apprentices, <lb/>
and was doing a raging business. In fact, he was getting rich, hand <lb/>
over fist, and was vastly respected. Marco was very proud of having <lb/>
such a man for a friend. He had taken me there ostensibly to let me <lb/>
see the big establishment which bought so much of his charcoal, but <lb/>
really to let me see what easy and almost familiar terms he was on with <lb/>
this great man. Dowley and I fraternized at once; I had had just such <lb/>
<pb n="399" entity="DSSR_000002494_0410"/>
picked men, splendid fellows, under me in the Colt Arms Factory. I <lb/>
was bound to see more of him, so I invited him to come out to Marco's, <lb/>
Sunday, and dine with us. Marco was appalled, and held his breath; <lb/>
and when the grandee accepted, he was so grateful that he almost <reg orig="for-|got">forgot</reg> <lb/>
to be astonished at the condescension.</p>
<p>Marco's joy was exhuberant&mdash;but only for a moment; then he grew <lb/>
thoughtful, then sad; and when he heard me tell Dowley I should have <lb/>
Dickon the boss mason, and Smug the boss wheel wright out there, too, <lb/>
the coal-dust on his face turned to chalk, and he lost his grip. But I <lb/>
knew what was the matter with him; it was the expense. He saw ruin <lb/>
before him; he judged that his financial days were numbered. <reg orig="How-|ever">However</reg>, <lb/>
on our way to invite the others, I said:</p>
<p>"You must allow me to have these friends come; and you must <lb/>
also allow me to pay the costs."</p>
<p>His face cleared, and he said with spirit:</p>
<p>"But not all of it, not all of it. Ye cannot well bear a burden like <lb/>
to this alone."</p>
<p>I stopped him, and said:</p>
<p>"Now let's understand each other on the spot, old friend. I am <lb/>
only a farm bailiff, it is true; but I am not poor, nevertheless. I have <lb/>
been very fortunate this year&mdash;you would be astonished to know how <lb/>
I have thriven. I tell you the honest truth when I say I could <reg orig="squan-|der">squander</reg> <lb/>
away as many as a dozen feasts like this and never care <hi rend="italic">that</hi> for <lb/>
the expense!" and I snapped my fingers. I could see myself rise a <lb/>
foot at a time in Marco's estimation, and when I fetched out those last <lb/>
words I was become a very tower, for style and altitude. "So you see, <lb/>
you must let me have my way. You can't contribute a cent to this <lb/>
orgy, that's <hi rend="italic">settled."</hi></p>
<p>"It's grand and good of you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, it isn't. You've opened your house to Jones and me in the <lb/>
most generous way; Jones was remarking upon it to-day, just before <lb/>
<pb n="400" entity="DSSR_000002494_0411"/>
you came back from the village; for although he wouldn't be likely to <lb/>
say such a thing to you,&mdash;because Jones isn't a talker, and is diffident <lb/>
in society&mdash;he has a good heart and a grateful, and knows how to <reg orig="ap-|preciate">appreciate</reg> <lb/>
it when he is well treated; yes, you and your wife have been <lb/>
very hospitable toward us&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ah, brother, 'tis nothing&mdash;<hi rend="italic">such</hi> hospitality!"</p>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f152" entity="DSSR_000002494_0411">
  <head>"WHEN A SLAVE PASSED HE COULDN'T EVEN SEE HIM."</head>
 </figure>
<p>"But it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> something; the best a man has, freely given, is always <lb/>
something, and is as good as a prince can do, <lb/>
and ranks right along beside it&mdash;for even a <lb/>
prince can but do his best. And so we'll shop <lb/>
around and get up this layout, now, and don't <lb/>
you worry about the <reg orig="ex-|pense">expense</reg>. <lb/>
I'm one of the <lb/>
worst spendthrifts that <lb/>
ever was born. Why, do <lb/>
you know, sometimes in <lb/>
a single week I spend&mdash; <lb/>
but never mind about <lb/>
that&mdash;you'd never <reg orig="be-|lieve">believe</reg> <lb/>
it anyway."</p>
<p>And so we went <reg orig="gad-|ding">gadding</reg> <lb/>
along, dropping in <lb/>
here and there, pricing <lb/>
things, and gossiping with the shopkeepers about the riot, and now <lb/>
and then running across pathetic reminders of it, in the persons of <lb/>
shunned and tearful and houseless remnants of families whose homes <lb/>
had been taken from them and their parents butchered or hanged. <lb/>
The raiment of Marco and his wife was of coarse tow-linen and <reg orig="linsey-|woolsey">linsey-woolsey</reg> <lb/>
respectively, and resembled township maps, it being made up <lb/>
pretty exclusively of patches which had been added, township by <reg orig="town-|ship">township</reg>, <lb/>
in the course of five or six years, until hardly a hand's-breadth of <lb/>
<pb n="401" entity="DSSR_000002494_0412"/>
the original garments was surviving and present. Now I wanted to fit <lb/>
these people out with new suits, on account of that swell company, and <lb/>
I didn't know just how to get at it with delicacy, until at last it struck <lb/>
me that as I had already been liberal in inventing wordy gratitude for <lb/>
the king, it would be just the thing to back it up with evidence of a <lb/>
substantial sort; so I said:</p>
<p>"And Marco, there's another thing which you must permit&mdash;out of <lb/>
kindness for Jones&mdash;because you wouldn't want to offend him. He <lb/>
was very anxious to testify his appreciation in some way, but he is so <lb/>
diffident he couldn't venture it himself, and so he begged me to buy <lb/>
some little things and give them to you and Dame Phyllis and let him <lb/>
pay for them without your ever knowing they came from him&mdash;you <lb/>
know how a delicate person feels about that sort of thing&mdash;and so I <lb/>
said I would, and we would keep mum. Well, his idea was, a new <lb/>
outfit of clothes for you both&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, it is wastefulness! It may not be, brother, it may not be. <lb/>
Consider the vastness of the sum&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Hang the vastness of the sum! Try to keep quiet for a moment, <lb/>
and see how it would seem; a body can't get in a word edgeways, you <lb/>
talk so much. You ought to cure that, Marco; it isn't good form, you <lb/>
know, and it will grow on you if you don't check it. Yes, we'll step <lb/>
in here, now, and price this man's stuff&mdash;and don't forget to remember <lb/>
to not let on to Jones that you know he had anything to do with it. <lb/>
You can't think how curiously sensitive and proud he is. He's a <lb/>
farmer&mdash;pretty fairly well-to-do farmer&mdash;and I'm his bailiff; <hi rend="italic">but</hi>&mdash;the <lb/>
imagination of that man! Why, sometimes when he forgets himself <lb/>
and gets to blowing off, you'd think he was one of the swells of the <lb/>
carth; and you might listen to him a hundred years and never take <lb/>
him for a farmer&mdash;especially if he talked agriculture. He <hi rend="italic">thinks</hi> he's <lb/>
a Sheol of a farmer; thinks he's old Grayback from Wayback; but <lb/>
between you and me privately he don't know as much about farming <lb/>
<pb n="402" entity="DSSR_000002494_0413"/>
as he does about running a kingdom&mdash;still, whatever he talks about, <lb/>
you want to drop your underjaw and listen, the same as if you had <lb/>
never heard such incredible wisdom in all your life before, and were <lb/>
afraid you might die before you got enough of it. That will please <lb/>
Jones."</p>
<p>It tickled Marco to the marrow to hear about such an odd character; <lb/>
but it also prepared him for accidents; and in my experience when <lb/>
you travel with a king who is letting on to be something else and can't <lb/>
remember it more than about half the time, you can't take too many <lb/>
precautions.</p>
<p>This was the best store we had come across yet; it had everything <lb/>
in it, in small quantities, from anvils and dry goods all the way down to <lb/>
fish and pinchbeck jewelry. I concluded I would bunch my whole <lb/>
invoice right here, and not go pricing around any more. So I got rid <lb/>
of Marco, by sending him off to invite the mason and the wheelwright, <lb/>
which left the field free to me. For I never care to do a thing in a <lb/>
quiet way; it's got to be theatrical or I don't take any interest in it. I <lb/>
showed up money enough, in a careless way, to corral the shopkeeper's <lb/>
respect, and then I wrote down a list of the things I wanted, and <lb/>
handed it to him to see if he could read it. He could, and was proud <lb/>
to show that he could. He said he had been educated by a priest, and <lb/>
could read and write both. He ran it through, and remarked with <lb/>
satisfaction that it was a pretty heavy bill. Well, and so it was, for a <lb/>
little concern like that. I was not only providing a swell dinner, but <lb/>
some odds and ends of extras. I ordered that the things be carted <lb/>
out and delivered at the dwelling of Marco the son of Marco by <reg orig="Satur-|day">Saturday</reg> <lb/>
evening, and send me the bill at dinner-time Sunday. He said I <lb/>
could depend upon his promptness and exactitude, it was the rule of <lb/>
the house. He also observed that he would throw in a couple of <reg orig="miller-|guns">miller-guns</reg> <lb/>
for the Marcos, gratis&mdash;that everybody was using them now. He <lb/>
had a mighty opinion of that clever device. I said:</p>
<pb entity="DSSR_000002494_0414"/>
 <figure rend="page" id="f153" entity="DSSR_000002494_0414">
  <head>"PRESENTLY WE STRUCK AN INCIDENT."</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="404" entity="DSSR_000002494_0415"/>
<p>"And please fill them up to the middle mark, too; and add that to <lb/>
the bill."</p>
<p>He would, with pleasure. He filled them, and I took them with <lb/>
me. I couldn't venture to tell him that the miller-gun was a little <lb/>
invention of my own, and that I had officially ordered that every <reg orig="shop-|keeper">shopkeeper</reg> <lb/>
in the kingdom keep them on hand and sell them at <reg orig="govern-|ment-price&mdash;which">government-price&mdash;which</reg> <lb/>
was the merest trifle, and the shopkeeper got that, <lb/>
not the government. We furnished them for nothing.</p>
<p>The king had hardly missed us when we got back at night-fall. <lb/>
He had early dropped again into his dream of a grand invasion of Gaul <lb/>
with the whole strength of his kingdom at his back, and the afternoon <lb/>
had slipped away without his ever coming to himself again.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXII.<lb/> DOWLEY'S HUMILIATION.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Well</hi>, when that cargo arrived, <lb/>
toward sunset, Saturday afternoon, <lb/>
I had my hands full to keep the <lb/>
Marcos from fainting. They were <lb/>
sure Jones and I were ruined past <lb/>
help, and they blamed themselves <lb/>
as accessories to this bankruptcy. <lb/>
You see, in addition to the <reg orig="dinner-|materials">dinner-materials</reg>, <lb/>
which called for a <reg orig="suffi-|ciently">sufficiently</reg> <lb/>
round sum, I had bought <lb/>
a lot of extras for the future <reg orig="com-|fort">comfort</reg> <lb/>
of the family: for instance, <lb/>
a big lot of wheat, a delicacy <lb/>
as rare to the tables of their <lb/>
class as was ice-cream to a <lb/>
hermit's; also a sizeable deal <lb/>
dinner table; also <lb/>
two entire pounds <lb/>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f155" entity="DSSR_000002494_0418"/>-->
<pb n="408" entity="DSSR_000002494_0419"/>
of salt, which was another piece of extravagance in those people's eyes; <lb/>
also crockery, stools, the clothes, a small cask of beer, and so on. I <lb/>
instructed the Marcos to keep quiet about this sumptuousness, so as to <lb/>
give me a chance to surprise the guests and show off a little. <reg orig="Con-|cerning">Concerning</reg> <lb/>
the new clothes, the simple couple were like children; they <lb/>
were up and down, all night, to see if it wasn't nearly daylight, so that <lb/>
they could put them on, and they were into them at last as much as an <lb/>
hour before dawn was due. Then their pleasure&mdash;not to say delirium <lb/>
&mdash;was so fresh and novel and inspiring that the sight of it paid me well <lb/>
for the interruptions which my sleep had suffered. The king had slept <lb/>
just as usual&mdash;like the dead. The Marcos could not thank him for <lb/>
their clothes, that being forbidden; but they tried every way they could <lb/>
think of to make him see how grateful they were. Which all went for <lb/>
nothing: he didn't notice any change.</p>
<p>It turned out to be one of those rich and rare fall days which is just <lb/>
a June day toned down to a degree where it is heaven to be out of <lb/>
doors. Toward noon the guests arrived and we assembled under a <lb/>
great tree and were soon as sociable as old acquaintances. Even the <lb/>
king's reserve melted a little, though it was some little trouble to him <lb/>
to adjust himself to the name of Jones along at first. I had asked him <lb/>
to try to not forget that he was a farmer; but I had also considered it <lb/>
prudent to ask him to let the thing stand at that, and not elaborate it <lb/>
any. Because he was just the kind of person you could depend on to <lb/>
spoil a little thing like that if you didn't warn him, his tongue was so <lb/>
handy, and his spirit so willing, and his information so uncertain.</p>
<p>Dowley was in fine feather, and I early got him started, and then <lb/>
adroitly worked him around onto his own history for a text and <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
for a hero, and then it was good to sit there and hear him hum. <lb/>
Self-made man, you know. They know how to talk. They do deserve <lb/>
more credit than any other breed of men, yes, that is true; and they <lb/>
are among the very first to find it out, too. He told how he had begun <lb/>
<pb n="409" entity="DSSR_000002494_0420"/>
life an orphan lad without money and without <lb/>
friends able to help him; how he had lived as <lb/>
the slaves of the meanest <reg orig="mas-|ter">master</reg> <lb/>
lived; how his day's work <lb/>
was from sixteen to eighteen <lb/>
hours long, and yielded him <lb/>
only enough black bread to <lb/>
keep him in a half-fed <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg>; <lb/>
how his faithful <reg orig="en-|deavors">endeavors</reg> <lb/>
finally attracted <lb/>
the attention of a good <lb/>
blacksmith, who came <lb/>
near knocking him dead <lb/>
with kindness by <reg orig="sudden-|ly">suddenly</reg> <lb/>
offering, when he was <lb/>
totally unprepared, to <lb/>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f156" entity="DSSR_000002494_0420">
  <head>"AND WERE SOON AS SOCIABLE AS OLD ACQUAINTANCES."</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="410" entity="DSSR_000002494_0421"/>
take him as his bound apprentice for nine years and give him board <lb/>
and clothes and teach him the trade&mdash;or "mystery" as Dowley called <lb/>
it. That was his first great rise, his first gorgeous stroke of fortune; <lb/>
and you saw that he couldn't yet speak of it without a sort of eloquent <lb/>
wonder and delight that such a gilded promotion should have fallen <lb/>
to the lot of a common human being. He got no new clothing <reg orig="dur-|ing">during</reg> <lb/>
his apprenticeship, but on his graduation day his master tricked <lb/>
him out in spang-new tow-linens and made him feel unspeakably rich <lb/>
and fine.</p>
<p>"I remember me of that day!" the wheelwright sang out, with <reg orig="en-|thusiasm">enthusiasm</reg>.</p>
<p>"And I likewise!" cried the mason. "I would not believe they <lb/>
were thine own; in faith I could not."</p>
<p>"Nor others!" shouted Dowley, with sparkling eyes. "I was like <lb/>
to lose my character, the neighbors wending I had mayhap been <lb/>
stealing. It was a great day, a great day; one forgetteth not days like <lb/>
that."</p>
<p>Yes, and his master was a fine man, and prosperous, and always <lb/>
had a great feast of meat twice in the year, and with it white bread, <lb/>
true wheaten bread; in fact, lived like a lord, so to speak. And in time <lb/>
Dowley succeeded to the business and married the daughter.</p>
<p>"And now consider what is come to pass," said he, impressively. <lb/>
"Two times in every month there is fresh meat upon my table." He <lb/>
made a pause here, to let that fact sink home, then added&mdash;"and eight <lb/>
times, salt meat."</p>
<p>"It is even true," said the wheelwright, with bated breath.</p>
<p>"I know it of mine own knowledge," said the mason, in the same <lb/>
reverent fashion.</p>
<p>"On my table appeareth white bread every Sunday in the year," <lb/>
added the master smith, with solemnity. "I leave it to your own <reg orig="con-|sciences">consciences</reg>, <lb/>
friends, if this is not also true?"</p>
<pb n="411" entity="DSSR_000002494_0422"/>
<p>"By my head, yes!" cried the mason.</p>
<p>"I can testify it&mdash;and I do," said the wheelwright.</p>
<p>"And as to furniture, ye shall say yourselves what mine equipment <lb/>
is." He waved his hand in fine gesture of granting frank and <reg orig="unham-|pered">unhampered</reg> <lb/>
freedom of speech, and added: "Speak as ye are moved; speak <lb/>
as ye would speak an I were not here."</p>
<p>"Ye have five stools, and of the sweetest workmanship at that, <lb/>
albeit your family is but three," said the wheelwright, with deep <lb/>
respect.</p>
<p>"And six wooden goblets, and six platters of wood and two of <lb/>
pewter to eat and drink from withal," said the mason, impressively. <lb/>
"And I say it as knowing God is my judge, and we tarry not here <lb/>
alway, but must answer at the last day for the things said in the body, <lb/>
be they false or be they sooth."</p>
<p>"Now ye know what manner of man I am, brother Jones," said the <lb/>
smith, with a fine and friendly condescension, "and doubtless ye would <lb/>
look to find me a man jealous of his due of respect and but sparing of <lb/>
outgo to strangers till their rating and quality be assured, but trouble <lb/>
yourself not, as concerning that; wit ye well ye shall find me a man <lb/>
that regardeth not these matters but is willing to receive any he as his <lb/>
fellow and equal that carrieth a right heart in his body, be his worldly <lb/>
estate howsoever modest. And in token of it, here is my hand; and I <lb/>
say with my own mouth we are equals&mdash;equals"&mdash;and he smiled around <lb/>
on the company with the satisfaction of a god who is doing the <reg orig="hand-|some">handsome</reg> <lb/>
and gracious thing and is quite well aware of it.</p>
<p>The king took the hand with a poorly disguised reluctance, and let <lb/>
go of it as willingly as a lady lets go of a fish; all of which had a good <lb/>
effect, for it was mistaken for an embarrassment natural to one who was <lb/>
being beamed upon by greatness.</p>
<p>The dame brought out the table, now, and set it under the tree. It <lb/>
caused a visible stir of surprise, it being brand new and a sumptuous <lb/>
<pb n="412" entity="DSSR_000002494_0423"/>
article of deal. But the surprise rose higher still, when the dame, with <lb/>
a body oozing easy indifference at every pore, but eyes that gave it all <lb/>
away by absolutely flaming with vanity, slowly unfolded an actual <lb/>
simon-pure tablecloth and spread it. That was a notch above even <lb/>
the blacksmith's domestic grandeurs, and it hit him hard; you could <lb/>
see it. But Marco was in Paradise; you could see that, too. Then <lb/>
the dame brought two fine new stools&mdash;whew! that was a sensation; <lb/>
it was visible in the eyes of every guest. Then she brought two more <lb/>
&mdash;as calmly as she could. Sensation again&mdash;with awed murmurs. <lb/>
Again she brought two&mdash;walking on air, she was so proud. The <lb/>
guests were petrified, and the mason muttered:</p>
<p>"There is that about earthly pomps which doth ever move to <reg orig="rev-|erence">reverence</reg>."</p>
<p>As the dame turned away, Marco couldn't help slapping on the <lb/>
climax while the thing was hot; so he said with what was meant for <lb/>
a languid composure but was a poor imitation of it:</p>
<p>"These suffice; leave the rest."</p>
<p>So there were more yet! It was a fine effect. I couldn't have <lb/>
played the hand better myself.</p>
<p>From this out, the madam piled up the surprises with a rush that <lb/>
fired the general astonishment up to a hundred and fifty in the shade, <lb/>
and at the same time paralyzed expression of it down to gasped "Oh's" <lb/>
and "Ah's", and mute upliftings of hands and eyes. She fetched <lb/>
crockery&mdash;new, and plenty of it; new wooden goblets and other table <lb/>
furniture; and beer, fish, chicken, a goose, eggs, roast beef, roast <reg orig="mut-|ton">mutton</reg>, <lb/>
a ham, a small roast pig, and a wealth of genuine white wheaten <lb/>
bread. Take it by and large, that spread laid everything far and away <lb/>
in the shade that ever that crowd had seen before. And while they <lb/>
sat there just simply stupefied with wonder and awe, I sort of waved <lb/>
my hand as if by accident, and the store-keeper's son emerged from <lb/>
space and said he had come to collect.</p>

<p>He ceased. There was a pale and awful silence. Not a limb <lb/>
stirred. Not a nostril betrayed the passage of breath.</p>
<p>"Is that all?" I asked, in a voice of the most perfect calmness.</p>
<p>"All, fair sir, save that certain matters of light moment are placed <lb/>
together under a head hight sundries. If it would like you, I will <lb/>
sepa&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It is of no consequence," I said, accompanying the words with a <lb/>
gesture of the most utter indifference; "give me the grand total, <lb/>
please."</p>
<p>The clerk leaned against the tree to stay himself, and said:</p>
<p>"Thirty-nine thousand one hundred and fifty milrays!"</p>
<pb n="415" entity="DSSR_000002494_0426"/>
<p>The wheelwright fell off his stool, the others grabbed the table to <lb/>
save themselves, and there was a deep and general ejaculation of&mdash;</p>
<p>"God be with us in the day of disaster!"</p>
<p>The clerk hastened to say:</p>
<p>"My father chargeth me to say he cannot honorably require you <lb/>
to pay it all at this time, and therefore only prayeth you&mdash;"</p>
<p>I paid no more heed than if it were the idle breeze, but with an air <lb/>
of indifference amounting almost to weariness, got out my money and <lb/>
tossed four dollars onto the table. Ah, you should have seen them <lb/>
stare!</p>
<p>The clerk was astonished and charmed. He asked me to retain <lb/>
one of the dollars as security, until he could go to town and&mdash;I <reg orig="inter-|rupted">interrupted</reg>:</p>
<p>"What, and fetch back nine cents? Nonsense. Take the whole. <lb/>
Keep the change."</p>
<p>There was an amazed murmur to this effect:</p>
<p>"Verily this being is <hi rend="italic">made</hi> of money! He throweth it away even <lb/>
as it were dirt."</p>
<p>The blacksmith was a crushed man.</p>
<p>The clerk took his money and reeled away drunk with fortune. I <lb/>
said to Marco and his wife:</p>
<p>"Good folk, here is a little trifle for you"&mdash;handing the miller-guns <lb/>
as if it were a matter of no consequence though each of them contained <lb/>
fifteen cents in solid cash; and while the poor creatures went to pieces <lb/>
with astonishment and gratitude, I turned to the others and said as <lb/>
calmly as one would ask the time of day:</p>
<p>"Well, if we are all ready, I judge the dinner is. Come, fall to."</p>
<p>Ah, well, it was immense; yes, it was a daisy. I don't know that <lb/>
I ever put a situation together better, or got happier spectacular effects <lb/>
out of the materials available. The blacksmith&mdash;well, he was simply <lb/>
mashed. Land! I wouldn't have felt what that man was feeling, for <lb/>
<pb n="416" entity="DSSR_000002494_0427"/>
anything in the world. Here he had been blowing and bragging about <lb/>
his grand meat-feast twice a year, and his fresh meat twice a month, <lb/>
and his salt meat twice a week, and his white bread every Sunday the <lb/>
year round&mdash;all for a family of three: the entire cost for the year not <lb/>
above 69.2.6 (sixty-nine cents, two mills and six milrays,) and all of a <lb/>
sudden here comes along a man who slashes out nearly four dollars on <lb/>
a single blow-out; and not only that, but acts as if it made him tired <lb/>
to handle such small sums. Yes, Dowley was a good deal wilted, and <lb/>
shrunk-up and collapsed; he had the aspect of a bladder-balloon that's <lb/>
been stepped on by a cow.</p>

<p>You prove your superiority over him in <lb/>

prosperous and rich; I could have had his adoration if I had had some <lb/>
little gimcrack title of nobility. And not only his, but any commoner's <lb/>
in the land, though he were the mightiest production of all the ages, <lb/>
in intellect, worth, and character, and I bankrupt in all three. This <lb/>
was to remain so, as long as England should exist in the earth. With <lb/>
the spirit of prophecy upon me, I could look into the future and see <lb/>
her erect statues and monuments to her unspeakable Georges and <lb/>
other royal and noble clothes-horses, and leave unhonored the <reg orig="crea-|tors">creators</reg> <lb/>
of this world&mdash;after God&mdash;Gutenberg, Watt, Arkwright, Whitney, <lb/>
Morse, Stephenson, Bell.</p>
<p>The king got his cargo aboard, and then, the talk not turning upon <lb/>
battle, conquest, or iron-clad duel, he dulled down to drowsiness and <lb/>
went off to take a nap. Mrs. Marco cleared the table, placed the <reg orig="beer-|keg">beer-keg</reg> <lb/>
handy, and went away to eat her dinner of leavings in humble <lb/>
privacy, and the rest of us soon drifted into matters near and dear to <lb/>
the hearts of our sort&mdash;business and wages, of course. At a first glance, <lb/>
things appeared to be exceeding prosperous in this little tributary <lb/>
kingdom&mdash;whose lord was King Bagdemagus&mdash;as compared with the <lb/>
state of things in my own region. They had the "protection" system <lb/>
in full force here, whereas we were working along down towards free <lb/>
trade, by easy stages, and were now about half way. Before long, <lb/>
Dowley and I were doing all the talking, the others hungrily <lb/>
listening. Dowley warmed to his work, snuffed an advantage in <lb/>
the air, and began to put questions which he considered pretty <lb/>
awkward ones for me, and they did have something of that <lb/>
look: </p>
<p>"In your country, brother, what is the wage of a master bailiff, <lb/>
master hind, carter, shepherd, swineherd?"</p>
<p>"Twenty-five milrays a day; that is to say, a quarter of a cent."</p>
<p>The smith's face beamed with joy. He said: </p>
<p>"With us they are allowed the double of it! And what may a <lb/>
<pb n="421" entity="DSSR_000002494_0432"/>
mechanic get&mdash;carpenter, dauber, mason, painter, blacksmith, <reg orig="wheel-|wright">wheelwright</reg> <lb/>
and the like?"</p>
<q>"On the average, fifty milrays; half a cent a day."</q>
<q>"Ho-ho! With us they are allowed a hundred! With us any good <lb/>
mechanic is allowed a cent a day! I count out the tailor, <lb/>
but not the others&mdash;they are all allowed a cent a day, and <lb/>
in driving times they get more&mdash;yes, up to a hundred and <lb/>
ten and even fifteen mil-rays a day. I've paid a <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
and fifteen myself, within the week. 'Rah for <lb/>
protection&mdash;to Sheol with free-trade!"</q>
<p>And his face shone upon the company <lb/>
like a sunburst. But I didn't scare at all. I <lb/>
rigged up my pile-driver, <lb/>
and allowed myself fifteen <lb/>
minutes to drive him into <lb/>
the earth&mdash;drive him <hi rend="italic">all</hi> in&mdash;drive <lb/>
him in till not even the curve <lb/>
<pb n="422" entity="DSSR_000002494_0433"/>
of his skull should show above ground. Here is the way I started in <lb/>
on him. I asked:</p>
<p>"What do you pay a pound for salt?"</p>
<p>"A hundred milrays."</p>
<p>"We pay forty. What do you pay for beef and mutton&mdash;when you <lb/>
buy it?" That was a neat hit; it made the color come.</p>
<p>"It varieth somewhat, but not much; one may say 75 milrays the <lb/>
pound."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">We</hi> pay 33. What do you pay for eggs?"</p>
<p>"Fifty milrays the dozen."</p>
<p>"We pay 20. What do you pay for beer?"</p>
<p>"It costeth us 8&frac12; milrays the pint."</p>
<p>"We get it for 4; 25 bottles for a cent. What do you pay for <lb/>
wheat?"</p>
<p>"At the rate of 900 milrays the bushel."</p>
<p>"We pay 400. What do you pay for a man's tow-linen suit?"</p>
<p>"Thirteen cents."</p>
<p>"We pay 6. What do you pay for a stuff gown for the wife of the <lb/>
laborer or the mechanic?"</p>
<p>"We pay 8. 4. 0."</p>
<p>"Well, observe the difference: you pay eight cents and four mills, <lb/>
we pay only four cents." I prepared, now, to sock it to him. I said: <lb/>
"Look here, dear friend, <hi rend="italic">what's become of your high wages you were</hi> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">bragging so about, a few minutes ago?"</hi>&mdash;and I looked around on the <lb/>
company with placid satisfaction, for I had slipped up on him gradually <lb/>
and tied him hand and foot, you see, without his ever noticing that he <lb/>
was being tied at all. "What's become of those noble high wages of <lb/>
yours?&mdash;I seem to have knocked the stuffing all out of them, it appears <lb/>
to me."</p>
<p>But if you will believe me, he merely looked surprised, that is all! <lb/>
he didn't grasp the situation at all, didn't know he had walked into a <lb/>
<pb n="423" entity="DSSR_000002494_0434"/>
trap, didn't discover that he was <hi rend="italic">in</hi> a trap. I could have shot him, from <lb/>
sheer vexation. With cloudy eye and a struggling intellect, he fetched <lb/>
this out:</p>
<p>"Marry, I seem not to understand. It is <hi rend="italic">proved</hi> that our wages be <lb/>
double thine; how then may it be that thou'st knocked therefrom the <lb/>
stuffing?&mdash;an I miscall not the wonderly word, this being the first time <lb/>
under grace and providence of God it hath been granted me to hear it."</p>
<p>Well, I was stunned; partly with this unlooked-for stupidity on <lb/>
his part, and partly because his fellows so manifestly sided with him <lb/>
and were of his mind&mdash;if you might call it mind. My position was <lb/>
simple enough, plain enough; how could it ever be simplified more? <lb/>
However, I must try:</p>
<p>"Why, look here, brother Dowley, don't you see? Your wages are <lb/>
merely higher than ours in <hi rend="italic">name,</hi> not in <hi rend="italic">fact.</hi>"</p>
<p>"Hear him! They are the <hi rend="italic">double</hi>&mdash;ye have confessed it yourself."</p>
<p>"Yes-yes, I don't deny that at all. But that's got nothing to do <lb/>
with it; the <hi rend="italic">amount</hi> of the wages in mere coins, with meaningless names <lb/>
attached to them to know them by, has got nothing to do with it. The <lb/>
thing is, how much can you <hi rend="italic">buy</hi> with your wages?&mdash;that's the idea. <lb/>
While it is true that with you a good mechanic is allowed about three <lb/>
dollars and a half a year, and with us only about a dollar and <reg orig="seventy-|five&mdash;">seventyfive&mdash;</reg>;"</p>
<p>"There&mdash;ye're confessing it again, ye're confessing it again!"</p>
<p>"Confound it, I've never denied it I tell you! What I say is this. <lb/>
With us <hi rend="italic">half</hi> a dollar buys more than a <hi rend="italic">dollar</hi> buys with you&mdash;and <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> it stands to reason and the commonest kind of common sense, <lb/>
that our wages are <hi rend="italic">higher</hi> than yours."</p>
<p>He looked dazed, and said, despairingly:</p>
<p>"Verily, I cannot make it out. Ye've just <hi rend="italic">said</hi> ours are the higher, <lb/>
and with the same breath ye take it back."</p>
<p>"Oh, great Scott, isn't it possible to get such a simple thing through <lb/>
<pb n="424" entity="DSSR_000002494_0435"/>
your head? Now look here&mdash;let me illustrate. We pay four cents for <lb/>
a woman's stuff gown, you pay 8. 4. 0. which is 4 mills more than <hi rend="italic">double.</hi> <lb/>
What do you allow a laboring woman who works on a farm?"</p>
<p>"Two mills a day."</p>
<p>"Very good; we allow but half as much; we pay her only a tenth <lb/>
of a cent a day; and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Again ye're conf&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Wait! Now, you see, the thing is very simple; this time you'll <lb/>
understand it. For instance, it takes your woman 42 days to earn her <lb/>
gown, at 2 mills a day&mdash;7 week's work; but ours earns hers in forty <lb/>
days&mdash;two days <hi rend="italic">short</hi> of 7 weeks. Your woman has a gown, and her <lb/>
whole seven weeks' wages are gone; ours has a gown, and two days' <lb/>
wages left, to buy something else with. There&mdash;<hi rend="italic">now</hi> you understand it!"</p>
<p>He looked&mdash;well, he merely looked dubious, it's the most I can say; <lb/>
so did the others. I waited&mdash;to let the thing work. Dowley spoke at <lb/>
last&mdash;and betrayed the fact that he actually hadn't gotten away from <lb/>
his rooted and grounded superstitions yet. He said, with a trifle of <lb/>
hesitancy:</p>
<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;ye cannot fail to grant that two mills a day is better <lb/>
than one."</p>
<p>Shucks! Well, of course I hated to give it up. So I chanced another <lb/>
flyer:</p>
<p>"Let us suppose a case. Suppose one of your journeymen goes out <lb/>
and buys the following articles:</p>
<list>
<item>"I pound of salt;</item>
<item>I dozen eggs;</item>
<item>I dozen pints of beer;</item>
<item>I bushel of wheat;</item>
<item>I tow-linen suit;</item>
<item>5 pounds of beef;</item>
<item>5 pounds of mutton.</item>
</list>
<pb n="425" entity="DSSR_000002494_0436"/>
<p>"The lot will cost him 32 cents. It takes him 32 working days to <lb/>
earn the money&mdash;5 weeks and 2 days. Let him come to us and work <lb/>
32 days at <hi rend="italic">half</hi> the wages; he can buy all those things for a shade <lb/>
under 14&frac12;; cents; they will cost him a shade under 29 days' work, and <lb/>
he will have about half a week's wages over. Carry it through the <lb/>
year; he would save nearly a week's wages every two months, <hi rend="italic">your</hi> <lb/>
man nothing; thus saving five or six weeks' wages in a year, your man <lb/>
not a cent. <hi rend="italic">Now</hi> I reckon you understand that 'high wages' and 'low <lb/>
wages' are phrases that don't mean anything in the world until you <lb/>
find out which of them will <hi rend="italic">buy</hi> the most!"</p>
<p>It was a crusher.</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f160" entity="DSSR_000002494_0436">
  <head>EVOLUTION.</head>
 </figure>
<p>But alas, it didn't crush. No, I had to give it up. What those people <lb/>
valued was <hi rend="italic">high wages;</hi> it didn't seem to be a matter of any <reg orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg> <lb/>
to them whether the high wages would buy anything or not. <lb/>
They stood for "protection," and swore by it, which was reasonable <lb/>
enough, because interested parties had gulled them into the notion that <lb/>
it was protection which had created their high wages. I proved to <lb/>
them that in a quarter of a century their wages had advanced but 30 <lb/>
per cent, while the cost of living had gone up 100; and that with us, in <lb/>
a shorter time, wages had advanced 40 per cent. while the cost of <reg orig="liv-|ing">living</reg> <lb/>
had gone steadily down. But it didn't do any good. Nothing could <lb/>
unseat their strange beliefs.</p>
<p>Well, I was smarting under a sense of defeat. Undeserved defeat, <lb/>
<pb n="426" entity="DSSR_000002494_0437"/>
but what of that? That didn't soften the smart any. And to think of <lb/>
the circumstances! the first statesman of the age, the capablest man, <lb/>
the best informed man in the entire world, the loftiest uncrowned head <lb/>
that had moved through the clouds of any political firmament for <reg orig="cent-|uries">centuries</reg>, <lb/>
sitting here apparently defeated in argument by an ignorant <reg orig="coun-|try">country</reg> <lb/>
blacksmith! And I could see that those others were sorry for me!&mdash; <lb/>
which made me blush till I could smell my whiskers scorching. Put <reg orig="your-|self">yourself</reg> <lb/>
in my place; feel as mean as I did, as ashamed as I felt&mdash;wouldn't <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> have struck below the belt to get even? Yes, you would; it is simply <lb/>
human nature. Well, that is what I did. I am not trying to justify it; <lb/>
I'm only saying that I was mad, and <hi rend="italic">anybody</hi> would have done it.</p>
<p>Well, when I make up my mind to hit a man, I don't plan out a <lb/>
love-tap; no, that isn't my way; as long as I'm going to hit him at all, <lb/>
I'm going to hit him a lifter. And I don't jump at him all of a sudden, <lb/>
and risk making a blundering half-way business of it; no, I get away <lb/>
off yonder to one side, and work up on him gradually, so that he never <lb/>
suspects that I'm going to hit him at all; and by and by, all in a flash, <lb/>
he's flat of his back, and he can't tell for the life of him how it all <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg>. <lb/>
That is the way I went for brother Dowley. I started to <reg orig="talk-|ing">talking</reg> <lb/>
lazy and comfortable, as if I was just talking to pass the time; and <lb/>
the oldest man in the world couldn't have taken the bearings of my <lb/>
starting place and guessed where I was going to fetch up:</p>
<p>"Boys, there's a good many curious things about law, and custom, <lb/>
and usage, and all that sort of thing, when you come to look at it; <lb/>
yes, and about the drift and progress of human opinion and movement, <lb/>
too. There are written laws&mdash;they perish; but there are also <reg orig="unwrit-|ten">unwritten</reg> <lb/>
laws&mdash;<hi rend="italic">they</hi> are eternal. Take the unwritten law of wages: it says <lb/>
they've got to advance, little by little, straight through the centuries. <lb/>
And notice how it works. We know what wages are now, here and <lb/>
there and yonder; we strike an average, and say that's the wages of <lb/>
to-day. We know what the wages were a hundred years ago, and <lb/>
<pb n="427" entity="DSSR_000002494_0438"/>
what they were two hundred years ago; that's as far back as we can <lb/>
get, but it suffices to give us the law of progress, the measure and rate <lb/>
of the periodical augmentation; and so, without a document to help <lb/>
us, we can come pretty close to determining what the wages were three <lb/>
and four and five hundred years ago. Good, so far. Do we stop there? <lb/>
No. We stop looking backward; we face around and apply the law to <lb/>
the future. My friends, I can tell you what people's wages are going <lb/>
to be at any date in the future you want to know, for hundreds and <lb/>
hundreds of years."</p>
<p>"What, goodman, what!"</p>
<p>"Yes. In seven hundred years wages will have risen to six times <lb/>
what they are now, here in your region, and farm hands will be allowed <lb/>
3 cents a day, and mechanics 6."</p>
<p>"I would I might die now and live then!" interrupted Smug the <lb/>
mason, with a fine avaricious glow in his eye.</p>
<p>"And that isn't all; they'll get their board besides&mdash;such as it is: <lb/>
it won't bloat them. Two hundred and fifty years later&mdash;pay attention, <lb/>
now&mdash;a mechanic's wages will then be&mdash;mind you, this is law, not <reg orig="guess-|work">guesswork</reg>; <lb/>
a mechanic's wages will then be <hi rend="italic">twenty</hi> cents a day!"</p>
<p>There was a general gasp of awed astonishment. Dickon the <lb/>
wheelwright murmured, with raised eyes and hands:</p>
<p>"More than three weeks pay for one day's work!"</p>
<p>"Riches!&mdash;of a truth, yes, riches!" muttered Marco, his breath <reg orig="com-|ing">coming</reg> <lb/>
quick and short, with excitement.</p>
<p>"Wages will keep on rising, little by little, little by little, as steadily <lb/>
as a tree grows, and at the end of three hundred and forty years more <lb/>
there'll be at least <hi rend="italic">one</hi> country where the mechanic's average wage will <lb/>
be <hi rend="italic">two hundred</hi> cents a day!"</p>
<p>It knocked them absolutely dumb! Not a man of them could get <lb/>
his breath for upwards of two minutes. Then the coalburner said <lb/>
prayerfully:</p>
<pb n="428" entity="DSSR_000002494_0439"/>
<p>"Might I but live to see it!"</p>
<p>"It is the income of an earl!" said Smug.</p>
<p>"An earl, say ye?" said Dowley; "ye could say more than that <lb/>
and speak no lie; there's no earl in the realm of Bagdemagus that hath <lb/>
an income like to that. Income of an earl&mdash;mf! it's the income of an <lb/>
angel!"</p>
<p>"Now then, that is what is going to happen as regards wages. In <lb/>
that remote day, that man will earn, with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> week's work, that bill of <lb/>
goods which it takes you upwards of <hi rend="italic">five</hi> weeks to earn now. Some <lb/>
other pretty surprising things are going to happen, too. Brother <reg orig="Dow-|ley">Dowley</reg>, <lb/>
who is it that determines, every spring, what the particular wage <lb/>
of each kind of mechanic, laborer, and servant shall be for that year?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes the courts, sometimes the town council; but most of <lb/>
all, the magistrate. Ye may say, in general terms, it is the magistrate <lb/>
that fixes the wages."</p>
<p>"Doesn't ask any of those poor devils to <hi rend="italic">help</hi> him fix their wages <lb/>
for them, does he?"</p>
<p>"Hm! That <hi rend="italic">were</hi> an idea! The master that's to pay him the <lb/>
money is the one that's rightly concerned in that matter, ye will notice."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;but I thought the other man might have some little trifle at <lb/>
stake in it, too; and even his wife and children, poor creatures. The <lb/>
masters are these: nobles, rich men, the prosperous generally. These <lb/>
few, who do no work, determine what pay the vast hive shall have <lb/>
who <hi rend="italic">do</hi> work. You see? They're a 'combine'&mdash;a trade union, to coin <lb/>
a new phrase&mdash;who band themselves together to force their lowly <lb/>
brother to take what they choose to give. Thirteen hundred years <lb/>
hence&mdash;so says the unwritten law&mdash;the 'combine' will be the other <lb/>
way, and then how these fine people's posterity will fume and fret and <lb/>
grit their teeth over the insolent tyranny of trade unions! Yes indeed! <lb/>
the magistrate will tranquilly arrange the wages from now clear away <lb/>
down into the nineteenth century; and then all of a sudden the <reg orig="wage-|earner">wage-earner</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="429" entity="DSSR_000002494_0440"/>
will consider that a couple of thousand years or so is enough of <lb/>
this one-sided sort of thing; and he will rise up and take a hand in <reg orig="fix-|ing">fixing</reg> <lb/>
his wages himself. Ah, he will have a long and bitter account of <lb/>
wrong and humiliation to settle."</p>
<p>"Do ye believe&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That he actually will help to fix his own wages? Yes, indeed. <lb/>
And he will be strong and able, then."</p>
<p>"Brave times, brave times, of a truth!" sneered the prosperous <lb/>
smith.</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f161" entity="DSSR_000002494_0440">
  <head>DISCREPANCY IN NOSES MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.</head>
 </figure>
<p>"Oh,&mdash;and there's another detail. In that day, a master may hire <lb/>
a man for only just one day, or one week, or one month at a time, if <lb/>
he wants to."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"It's true. Moreover, a magistrate won't be able to force a man to <lb/>
work for a master a whole year on a stretch whether the man wants to <lb/>
or not."</p>
<p>"Will there be <hi rend="italic">no</hi> law or sense in that day?"</p>
<p>"Both of them, Dowley. In that day a man will be his own <reg orig="prop-|erty">property</reg>, <lb/>
not the property of magistrate and master. And he can leave <lb/>
town whenever he wants to, if the wages don't suit him!&mdash;and they <lb/>
can't put him in the pillory for it."</p>

<p>"Perdition catch such an age!" shouted Dowley, in strong <reg orig="indig-|nation">indignation</reg>. <lb/>
"An age of dogs, an age barren of reverence for superiors <lb/>
and respect for authority! The pillory&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, wait, brother; say no good word for that institution. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> think <lb/>
the pillory ought to be abolished."</p>
<p>"A most strange idea. Why?"</p>
<p>"Well, I'll tell you why. Is a man ever put in the pillory for a <lb/>
capital crime?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Is it right to condemn a man to a slight punishment for a small <lb/>
offense and then kill him?"</p>
<p>There was no answer. I had scored my first point! For the first <lb/>
time, the smith wasn't up and ready. The company noticed it. Good <lb/>
effect.</p>
<p>"You don't answer, brother. You were about to glorify the pillory <lb/>
a while ago, and shed some pity on a future age that isn't going to use <lb/>
it. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> think the pillory ought to be abolished. What usually happens <lb/>
when a poor fellow is put in the pillory for some little offence that <lb/>
didn't amount to anything in the world? The mob try to have some <lb/>
fun with him, don't they?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"They begin by clodding him; and they laugh themselves to pieces <lb/>
to see him try to dodge one clod and get hit with another?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Then they throw dead cats at him, don't they?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, then, suppose he has a few personal enemies in that mob&mdash; <lb/>
and here and there a man or a woman with a secret grudge against <lb/>
him&mdash;and suppose especially, that he is unpopular in the community, <lb/>
for his pride, or his prosperity, or one thing or another&mdash;stones and <lb/>
bricks take the place of clods and cats presently, don't they?"</p>
<pb n="431" entity="DSSR_000002494_0442"/>
<p>"There is no doubt of it."</p>
<p>"As a rule he is crippled for life, isn't he?&mdash;jaws broken, teeth <lb/>
smashed out?&mdash;or legs mutilated, gangrened, presently cut off?&mdash;or an <lb/>
eye knocked out, maybe both eyes?"</p>
<p>"It is true, God knoweth it."</p>
<p>"And if he is unpopular he can depend on <hi rend="italic">dying,</hi> right there in the <lb/>
stocks, can't he?"</p>
<p>"He surely can! One may not deny it."</p>
<p>"I take it none of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are unpopular&mdash;by reason of pride or <reg orig="inso-|lence">insolence</reg>, <lb/>
or conspicuous prosperity, or any of those things that excite <lb/>
envy and malice among the base scum of a village? <hi rend="italic">You</hi> wouldn't <lb/>
think it much of a risk to take a chance in the stocks?"</p>
<p>Dowley winced, visibly. I judged he was hit. But he didn't betray <lb/>
it by any spoken word. As for the others, they spoke out plainly, and <lb/>
with strong feeling. They said they had seen enough of the stocks to <lb/>
know what a man's chance in them was, and they would never consent <lb/>
to enter them if they could compromise on a quick death by hanging.</p>
<p>"Well, to change the subject&mdash;for I think I've established my point <lb/>
that the stocks ought to be abolished. I think some of our laws are <lb/>
pretty unfair. For instance, if I do a thing which ought to deliver me <lb/>
to the stocks, and you know I did it and yet keep still and don't report <lb/>
me, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will get the stocks if anybody informs on you."</p>
<p>"Ah, but that would serve you but right," said Dowley, "for you <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">must</hi> inform. So saith the law."</p>
<p>The others coincided.</p>
<p>"Well, all right, let it go, since you vote me down. But there's <lb/>
one thing which certainly isn't fair. The magistrate fixes a mechanic's <lb/>
wage at 1 cent a day, for instance. The law says that if any master <lb/>
shall venture even under utmost press of business, to pay anything <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">over</hi> that cent a day, even for a single day, he shall be both fined and <lb/>
pilloried for it; and whoever knows he did it and doesn't inform, they <lb/>
<pb n="432" entity="DSSR_000002494_0443"/>
also shall be fined and pilloried. Now it seems to me unfair, Dowley, <lb/>
and a deadly peril to all of us, that because you thoughtlessly confessed, <lb/>
a while ago, that within a week you have paid a cent and fifteen mil&mdash;"</p>
<p>Oh, I tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi> it was a smasher! You ought to have seen them go <lb/>
to pieces, the whole gang. I had just slipped up on poor smiling and <lb/>
complacent Dowley so nice and easy and softly, that he never <reg orig="sus-|pected">suspected</reg> <lb/>
anything was going to happen <lb/>
till the blow came crashing down and <lb/>
knocked him all to rags.</p>
<p>A fine effect. In fact as fine as any <lb/>
I ever produced, with so little time to <lb/>
work it up in.</p>
<p>But I saw in a moment that I had <lb/>
overdone the thing a little. I was <reg orig="ex-|pecting">expecting</reg> <lb/>
to scare them, but I wasn't <lb/>
expecting to scare them to death. <lb/>
They were mighty near it, though. <lb/>
You see they had been a whole <reg orig="life-|time">lifetime</reg> <lb/>
learning to appreciate the <reg orig="pil-|lory">pillory</reg>; <lb/>
and to have that thing staring <lb/>
them in the face, and every one of <lb/>
them distinctly at the mercy of me, a <lb/>
stranger, if I chose to go and report&mdash; <lb/>
well, it was awful, and they couldn't <lb/>
seem to recover from the shock, they <lb/>
couldn't seem to pull themselves together. Pale, shaky, dumb, <reg orig="piti-|ful">pitiful</reg>? <lb/>
Why, they weren't any better than so many dead men. It was <lb/>
very uncomfortable. Of course I thought they would appeal to me to <lb/>
keep mum, and then we would shake hands, and take a drink all <lb/>
round, and laugh it off, and there an end. But no; you see I was an <lb/>
unknown person, among a cruelly oppressed and suspicious people, <lb/>
<pb n="433" entity="DSSR_000002494_0444"/>
a people always accustomed to having advantage taken of their <reg orig="help-|lessness">helplessness</reg>, <lb/>
and never expecting just or kind treatment from any but <lb/>
their own families and very closest intimates. Appeal to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to be <lb/>
gentle, to be fair, to be generous? Of course they wanted to, but <lb/>
they couldn't dare.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXIV.<lb/> THE VANKEE AND THE KING SOLD <lb/>
AS SLAVES.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Well</hi>, what had I better do? Nothing in <lb/>
a hurry, sure. I must get up a <reg orig="diver-|sion">diversion</reg>; <lb/>
anything to employ me while I <lb/>
could think, and while these poor <reg orig="fel-|lows">fellows</reg> <lb/>
could have a chance to come <lb/>
to life again. There sat Marco, <lb/>
petrified in the act of trying <lb/>
to get the hang of his <reg orig="miller-|gun&mdash;turned">millergun&mdash;turned</reg> <lb/>
to stone, just in <lb/>
the attitude he was in when my <lb/>
pile-driver fell, the toy still gripped <lb/>
in his unconscious fingers. So I <lb/>
took it from him and proposed <lb/>
to explain its mystery. Mystery! a <lb/>
simple little thing like that; and yet <lb/>
it was mystery enough, for that race <lb/>
and that age.</p>
<p>I never saw such an awkward people, <lb/>
with machinery; you see, they were totally <lb/>
unused to it. The miller-gun was a little <lb/>
double - barreled tube <lb/>
of toughened glass, <lb/>
with a neat little <lb/>
trick of a spring to <lb/>
it, which upon <reg orig="press-|ure">pressure</reg> <lb/>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f163" entity="DSSR_000002494_0448"/>-->
<pb n="438" entity="DSSR_000002494_0449"/>
would let a shot escape. But the shot wouldn't hurt anybody, <lb/>
it would only drop into your hand. In the gun were two sizes&mdash; <lb/>
wee mustard - seed shot, and another sort that were several times <lb/>
larger. They were money. The mustard-seed shot represented <reg orig="mil-|rays">milrays</reg>, <lb/>
the larger ones mills. So the gun was a purse; and very handy, <lb/>
too; you could pay out money in the dark with it, with accuracy; and <lb/>
you could carry it in your mouth; or in your vest pocket, if you had <lb/>
one. I made them of several sizes&mdash;one size so large that it would <lb/>
carry the equivalent of a dollar. Using shot for money was a good <lb/>
thing for the government; the metal cost nothing, and the money <lb/>
couldn't be counterfeited, for I was the only person in the kingdom <lb/>
who knew how to manage a shot tower. "Paying the shot" soon came <lb/>
to be a common phrase. Yes, and I knew it would still be passing <lb/>
men's lips, away down in the nineteenth century, yet none would <reg orig="sus-|pect">suspect</reg> <lb/>
how and when it originated.</p>
<p>The king joined us, about this time, mightily refreshed by his nap, <lb/>
and feeling good. Anything could make me nervous now, I was so <lb/>
uneasy&mdash;for our lives were in danger; and so it worried me to detect a <lb/>
complacent something in the king's eye which seemed to indicate that <lb/>
he had been loading himself up for a performance of some kind or other; <lb/>
confound it, why must he go and choose such a time as this?</p>
<p>I was right. He began, straight off, in the most innocently artful, <lb/>
and transparent, and lubberly way, to lead up to the subject of <reg orig="agri-|culture">agriculture</reg>. <lb/>
The cold sweat broke out all over me. I wanted to whisper <lb/>
in his ear, "Man, we are in awful danger! every moment is worth a <lb/>
principality till we get back these men's confidence; <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> waste any <lb/>
of this golden time." But of course I couldn't do it. Whisper to him? <lb/>
It would look as if we were conspiring. So I had to sit there and look <lb/>
calm and pleasant while the king stood over that dynamite mine and <lb/>
mooned along about his damned onions and things. At first the tumult <lb/>
of my own thoughts, summoned by the danger-signal and swarming <lb/>
<pb n="439" entity="DSSR_000002494_0450"/>
to the rescue from every quarter of my skull, kept up such a hurrah <lb/>
and confusion and fifing and drumming that I couldn't take in a word; <lb/>
but presently when my mob of gathering plans began to crystalize <lb/>
and fall into position and form line of battle, a sort of order and quiet <lb/>
ensued and I caught the boom of the king's batteries, as if out of <reg orig="re-|mote">remote</reg> <lb/>
distance:</p>
<p>"&mdash;were not the best way, methinks, albeit it is not to be denied <lb/>
that authorities differ as concerning this point, some contending that <lb/>
the onion is but an unwholesome berry when stricken early from the <lb/>
tree&mdash;"</p>
<p>The audience showed signs of life, and sought each other's eyes in <lb/>
a surprised and troubled way.</p>
<p>"&mdash;whileas others do yet maintain, with much show of reason, that <lb/>
this is not of necessity the case, instancing that plums and other like <lb/>
cereals do be always dug in the unripe state&mdash;"</p>
<p>The audience exhibited distinct distress; yes, and also fear.</p>
<p>"&mdash;yet are they clearly wholesome, the more especially when one <lb/>
doth assuage the asperities of their nature by admixture of the <reg orig="tran-|quilizing">tranquilizing</reg> <lb/>
juice of the wayward cabbage&mdash;"</p>
<p>The wild light of terror began to glow in these men's eyes, and one <lb/>
of them muttered, "These be errors, every one&mdash;God hath surely <lb/>
smitten the mind of this farmer." I was in miserable apprehension; I <lb/>
sat upon thorns.</p>
<p>"&mdash;and further instancing the known truth that in the case of <reg orig="ani-|mals">animals</reg>, <lb/>
the young, which may be called the green fruit of the creature, <lb/>
is the better, all confessing that when a goat is ripe, his fur doth heat <lb/>
and sore engame his flesh, the which defect, taken in connection with <lb/>
his several rancid habits, and fulsome appetites, and godless attitudes <lb/>
of mind, and bilious quality of morals&mdash;"</p>
<p>They rose and went for him! With a fierce shout, "The one would <lb/>
betray us, the other is mad! Kill them! Kill them!" they flung <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>

 </figure>
<pb n="441" entity="DSSR_000002494_0452"/>
upon us. What joy flamed up in the king's eye! He might be <lb/>
lame in agriculture, but this kind of thing was just in his line. He had <lb/>
been fasting long, he was hungry for a fight. He hit the blacksmith a <lb/>
crack under the jaw that lifted him clear off his feet and stretched him <lb/>
flat of his back. "St. George for Britain!" and he downed the <reg orig="wheel-|wright">wheelwright</reg>. <lb/>
The mason was big, but I laid him out like nothing. The <lb/>
three gathered themselves up and came again; went down again; came <lb/>
again; and kept on repeating this, with native British pluck, until they <lb/>
were battered to jelly, reeling with exhaustion, and so blind that they <lb/>
couldn't tell us from each other; and yet they kept right on, hammering <lb/>
away with what might was left in them. Hammering each other&mdash;for <lb/>
we stepped aside and looked on while they rolled, and struggled, and <lb/>
gouged, and pounded, and bit, with the strict and wordless attention <lb/>
to business of so many bulldogs. We looked on without apprehension, <lb/>
for they were fast getting past ability to go for help against us, and the <lb/>
arena was far enough from the public road to be safe from intrusion.</p>
<p>Well, while they were gradually playing out, it suddenly occured <lb/>
to me to wonder what had become of Marco. I looked around; he <lb/>
was nowhere to be seen. Oh, but this was ominous! I pulled the <lb/>
king's sleeve, and we glided away and rushed for the hut. No Marco <lb/>
there, no Phyllis there! They had gone to the road for help, sure. I <lb/>
told the king to give his heels wings, and I would explain later. We <lb/>
made good time across the open ground, and as we darted into the <lb/>
shelter of the wood I glanced back and saw a mob of excited peasants <lb/>
swarm into view, with Marco and his wife at their head. They were <lb/>
making a world of noise, but that couldn't hurt anybody; the wood was <lb/>
dense, and as soon as we were well into its depths we would take to a <lb/>
tree and let them whistle. Ah, but then came another sound&mdash;dogs! <lb/>
Yes, that was quite another matter. It magnified our contract&mdash;we <lb/>
must find running water.</p>
<p>We tore along at a good gait, and soon left the sounds far behind <lb/>
<pb n="442" entity="DSSR_000002494_0453"/>
and modified to a murmur. We struck a stream and darted into it. We <lb/>
waded swiftly down it, in the dim forest light, for as much as three <lb/>
hundred yards, and then came across an oak with a great bough <reg orig="stick-|ing">sticking</reg> <lb/>
out over the water. We climbed up on this bough, and began to <lb/>
work our way along it to the body of the tree; now we began to hear <lb/>
those sounds more plainly; so the mob had struck our trail. For a <lb/>
while the sounds approached pretty fast. And then for another while <lb/>
they didn't. No doubt the dogs had found the place where we had <lb/>
entered the stream, and were now waltzing up and down the shores <lb/>
trying to pick up the trail again.</p>
<p>When we were snugly lodged in the tree and curtained with foliage, <lb/>
the king was satisfied, but I was doubtful. I believed we could crawl <lb/>
along a branch and get into the next tree, and I judged it worth while <lb/>
to try. We tried it, and made a success of it, though the king slipped, <lb/>
at the junction, and came near failing to connect. We got comfortable <lb/>
lodgement and satisfactory concealment among the foliage, and then <lb/>
we had nothing to do but listen to the hunt.</p>
<p>Presently we heard it coming&mdash;and coming on the jump, too; yes, <lb/>
and down both sides of the stream. Louder&mdash;louder&mdash;next minute it <lb/>
swelled swiftly up into a roar of shoutings, barkings, tramplings, and <lb/>
swept by like a cyclone.</p>
<p>"I was afraid that the overhanging branch would suggest <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
to them," said I, "but I don't mind the disappointment. Come, <lb/>
my liege, it were well that we make good use of our time. We've <lb/>
flanked them. Dark is coming on, presently. If we can cross the <lb/>
stream and get a good start, and borrow a couple of horses from <reg orig="some-|body's">somebody's</reg> <lb/>
pasture to use for a few hours, we shall be safe enough."</p>
<p>We started down, and got nearly to the lowest limb, when we <lb/>
seemed to hear the hunt returning. We stopped to listen.</p>
<p>"Yes," said I, "they're baffled, they've given it up, they're on their <lb/>
way home. We will climb back to our roost again, and let them go by."</p>
<pb n="443" entity="DSSR_000002494_0454"/>
<p>So we climbed back. The king listened a moment and said: </p>
<p>"They still search&mdash;I wit the sign. We did best to abide."</p>
<p>He was right. He knew more about hunting than I did. The noise <lb/>
approached steadily, but not with a rush. The king said: </p>
<p>"They reason that we were advantaged by no parlous start of them, <lb/>
and being on foot are as yet no mighty way from where we took the <lb/>
water."</p>
<p>"Yes, sire, that is about it, I am afraid, though I was hoping better <lb/>
things."</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f165" entity="DSSR_000002494_0454">
  <head>"YES, SIRE, THAT IS ABOUT IT, I AM AFRAID."</head>
 </figure>
<p>The noise drew nearer and nearer, and soon the van was drifting <lb/>
under us, on both sides of the water. A voice called a halt from the <lb/>
other bank, and said:</p>
<p>"An they were so minded, they could get to yon tree by this <lb/>
branch that overhangs, and yet not touch ground. Ye will do well to <lb/>
send a man up it."</p>
<p>"Marry, that will we do!"</p>
<p>I was obliged to admire my cuteness in foreseeing this very thing <lb/>
and swapping trees to beat it. But don't you know, there are some <lb/>
things that can beat smartness and foresight? Awkwardness and <reg orig="stu-|pidity">stupidity</reg> <lb/>
can. The best swordsman in the world doesn't need to fear the <lb/>
<pb n="444" entity="DSSR_000002494_0455"/>
second best swordsman in the world; no, the person for him to be <lb/>
afraid of is some ignorant antagonist who has never had a sword in his <lb/>
hand before; he doesn't do the thing he ought to do, and so the expert <lb/>
isn't prepared for him; he does the thing he ought not to do: and often <lb/>
it catches the expert out and ends him on the spot. Well, how could <lb/>
I, with all my gifts, make any valuable preparation against a <reg orig="near-|sighted">nearsighted</reg>, <lb/>
cross-eyed pudding-headed clown who would aim himself at <lb/>
the wrong tree and hit the right one? And that is what he did. He <lb/>
went for the wrong tree, which was of course the right one by mistake, <lb/>
and up he started.</p>
<p>Matters were serious, now. We remained still, and awaited <reg orig="devel-|opments">developments</reg>. <lb/>
The peasant toiled his difficult way up. The king raised <lb/>
himself up and stood; he made a leg ready, and when the comer's head <lb/>
arrived in reach of it there was a dull thud, and down went the man <lb/>
floundering to the ground. There was a wild outbreak of anger, below, <lb/>
and the mob swarmed in from all around, and there we were treed, and <lb/>
prisoners. Another man started up; the bridging bough was detected, <lb/>
and a volunteer started up the tree that furnished the bridge. The <lb/>
king ordered me to play Horatius and keep the bridge. For a while <lb/>
the enemy came thick and fast; but no matter, the head man of each <lb/>
procession always got a buffet that dislodged him as soon as he came <lb/>
in reach. The king's spirits rose, his joy was limitless. He said that <lb/>
if nothing occurred to mar the prospect we should have a beautiful <lb/>
night, for on this line of tactics we could hold the tree against the <lb/>
whole countryside.</p>
<p>However, the mob soon came to that conclusion themselves; <reg orig="where-|fore">wherefore</reg> <lb/>
they called off the assault and began to debate other plans. They <lb/>
had no weapons, but there were plenty of stones, and stones might <lb/>
answer. We had no objections. A stone might possibly penetrate to <lb/>
us once in a while, but it wasn't very likely; we were well protected <lb/>
by boughs and foliage, and were not visible from any good <reg orig="aiming-|point">aiming-point</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="445" entity="DSSR_000002494_0456"/>
If they would but waste half an hour in stone-throwing, the <lb/>
dark would come to our help. We were feeling very well satisfied. <lb/>
We could smile; almost laugh.</p>
<p>But we didn't; which was just as well, for we should have been <reg orig="in-|terrupted">interrupted</reg>. <lb/>
Before the stones had been raging through the leaves and <lb/>
bouncing from the boughs fifteen minutes, we began to notice a smell. <lb/>
A couple of sniffs of it was enough of an explanation: it was smoke! <lb/>
Our game was up at last. We recognized that. When smoke invites <lb/>
you, you have to come. They raised their pile of dry brush and damp <lb/>
weeds higher and higher, and when they saw the thick cloud begin to <lb/>
roll up and smother the tree, they broke out in a storm of joy-clamors. <lb/>
I got enough breath to say:</p>
<p>"Proceed, my liege; after you is manners."</p>
<p>The king gasped:</p>
<p>"Follow me down, and then back thyself against one side of the <lb/>
trunk, and leave me the other. Then will we fight. Let each pile his <lb/>
dead according to his own fashion and taste."</p>
<p>Then he descended barking and coughing, and I followed. I struck <lb/>
the ground an instant after him; we sprang to our appointed places, <lb/>
and began to give and take with all our might. The pow-wow and <lb/>
racket were prodigious; it was a tempest of riot and confusion and <lb/>
thick-falling blows. Suddenly some horsemen tore into the midst of <lb/>
the crowd, and a voice shouted:</p>
<p>"Hold&mdash;or ye are dead men!"</p>
<p>How good it sounded! The owner of the voice bore all the marks <lb/>
of a gentleman: picturesque and costly raiment, the aspect of <reg orig="com-|mand">command</reg>, <lb/>
a hard countenance, with complexion and features marred by <lb/>
dissipation. The mob fell humbly back, like so many spaniels. <lb/>
The gentleman inspected us critically, then said sharply to the <lb/>
peasants:</p>
<p>"What are ye doing to these people?"</p>
<pb n="446" entity="DSSR_000002494_0457"/>
<p>"They be madmen, worshipful sir, that have come wandering we <lb/>
know not whence, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ye know not whence? Do ye pretend ye know them not?"</p>
<p>"Most honored sir, we speak but the truth. They are strangers <lb/>
and unknown to any in this region; and they be the most violent and <lb/>
bloodthirsty madmen that ever&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Peace! Ye know not what ye say. They are not mad. Who <lb/>
are ye? And whence are ye? Explain."</p>
<p>"We are but peaceful strangers, sir," I said, "and traveling upon <lb/>
our own concerns. We are from a far country, and unacquainted here. <lb/>
We have purposed no harm; and yet but for your brave interference <lb/>
and protection these people would have killed us. As you have divined, <lb/>
sir, we are not mad; neither are we violent or bloodthirsty."</p>
<p>The gentleman turned to his retinue and said calmly:</p>
<p>"Lash me these animals to their kennels!"</p>
<p>The mob vanished in an instant; and after them plunged the <reg orig="horse-|men">horsemen</reg>, <lb/>
laying about them with their whips and pitilessly riding down <lb/>
such as were witless enough to keep the road instead of taking to the <lb/>
bush. The shrieks and supplications presently died away in the <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg>, <lb/>
and soon the horsemen began to straggle back. Meantime the <lb/>
gentleman had been questioning us more closely, but had dug no <reg orig="par-|ticulars">particulars</reg> <lb/>
out of us. We were lavish of recognition of the service he was <lb/>
doing us, but we revealed nothing more than that we were friendless <lb/>
strangers from a far country. When the escort were all returned, the <lb/>
gentleman said to one of his servants:</p>
<p>"Bring the led horses and mount these people."</p>
<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
<p>We were placed toward the rear, among the servants. We traveled <lb/>
pretty fast, and finally drew rein some time after dark at a roadside inn <lb/>
some ten or twelve miles from the scene of our troubles. My lord <lb/>
went immediately to his room, after ordering his supper, and we saw <lb/>
<pb n="447" entity="DSSR_000002494_0458"/>
no more of him. At dawn in the morning we breakfasted and made <lb/>
ready to start.</p>
<p>My lord's chief attendant sauntered forward at that moment with <lb/>
indolent grace, and said:</p>
<p>"Ye have said ye should continue upon this road, which is our <lb/>
direction likewise; wherefore my lord, the earl Grip, hath given <reg orig="com-|mandment">commandment</reg> <lb/>
that ye retain the horses and ride, and that certain of us <lb/>
ride with ye a twenty mile to a fair town that hight Cambenet, whenso <lb/>
ye shall be out of peril."</p>
<p>We could do nothing less than express our thanks and accept the <lb/>
offer. We jogged along, six in the <lb/>
party, at a moderate and <reg orig="comfort-|able">comfortable</reg> <lb/>
gait, and in conversation <reg orig="learn-|ed">learned</reg> <lb/>
that my lord Grip was a very <lb/>
great personage in his own region, <lb/>
which lay a day's journey beyond <lb/>
Cambenet. We loitered to such a <lb/>
degree that it was near the middle <lb/>
of the forenoon when we entered the <lb/>
market square of the town. We <reg orig="dis-|mounted">dismounted</reg>, <lb/>
and left our thanks once <lb/>
more for my lord, and then <reg orig="approach-|ed">approached</reg> <lb/>
a crowd assembled in the centre <lb/>
of the square, to see what might be the object of interest. It was the <lb/>
remnant of that old peregrinating band of slaves! So they had been <lb/>
dragging their chains about, all this weary time. That poor husband <lb/>
was gone, and also many others; and some few purchases had been <lb/>
added to the gang. The king was not interested, and wanted to move <lb/>
along, but I was absorbed, and full of pity. I could not take my eyes <lb/>
away from these worn and wasted wrecks of humanity. There they <lb/>
sat, grouped upon the ground, silent, uncomplaining, with bowed <lb/>

heads, a pathetic sight. And by hideous contrast, a redundant orator <lb/>
was making a speech to another gathering not thirty steps away, in <lb/>
fulsome laudation of "our glorious British liberties!"</p>
<p>I was boiling. I had forgotten I was a plebeian, I was <reg orig="remember-|ing">remembering</reg> <lb/>
I was a man. Cost what it might, I would mount that rostrum and&mdash;</p>
<p>Click! the king and I were handcuffed together! Our companions, <lb/>
those servants, had done it; my lord Grip stood looking on. The king <lb/>
burst out in a fury, and said:</p>
<p>"What meaneth this ill-mannered jest?"</p>
<p>My lord merely said to his head miscreant, coolly:</p>
<p>"Put up the slaves and sell them!"</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Slaves!</hi> The word had a new sound&mdash;and how unspeakably awful! <lb/>
The king lifted his manacles and brought them down with a deadly <lb/>
force; but my lord was out of the way when they arrived. A dozen of <lb/>
the rascal's servants sprang forward, and in a moment we were <reg orig="help-|less">helpless</reg>, <lb/>
with our hands bound behind us. We so loudly and so earnestly <lb/>
proclaimed ourselves freemen, that we got the interested attention of <lb/>
that liberty-mouthing orator and his patriotic crowd, and they <reg orig="gath-|ered">gathered</reg> <lb/>
about us and assumed a very determined attitude. The orator said:</p>
<p>"If indeed ye are freemen, ye have nought to fear&mdash;the God-given <lb/>
liberties of Britain are about ye for your shield and shelter! (Applause.) <lb/>
Ye shall soon see. Bring forth your proofs."</p>
<p>"What proofs?"</p>
<p>"Proof that ye are freemen."</p>
<p>Ah&mdash;I remembered! I came to myself; I said nothing. But the <lb/>
king stormed out:</p>
<p>"Thou'rt insane, man. It were better, and more in reason, that <lb/>
this thief and scoundrel here prove that we are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> freemen."</p>
<p>You see, he knew his own laws just as other people so often know <lb/>
the laws: by words, not by effects. They take a <hi rend="italic">meaning,</hi> and get to <lb/>
be very vivid, when you come to apply them to yourself.</p>
<pb n="449" entity="DSSR_000002494_0460"/>
<p>All hands shook their heads and looked disappointed; some turned <lb/>
away, no longer interested. The orator said&mdash;and this time in the <lb/>
tones of business, not of sentiment:</p>
<p>"An ye do not know your country's laws, it were time ye learned <lb/>
them. Ye are strangers to us; ye will not deny that. Ye may be <lb/>
freemen, we do not deny that; but also ye may be slaves. The law <lb/>
is clear: it doth not require the claimant to prove ye are slaves, it <reg orig="re-|quireth">requireth</reg> <lb/>
you to prove ye are <hi rend="italic">not.</hi>"</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>"Dear sir, give us only time to send to Astolat; or give us only time <lb/>
to send to the Valley of Holiness&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Peace, good man, these are extraordinary requests, and you may <lb/>
not hope to have them granted. It would cost much time, and would <lb/>
unwarrantably inconvenience your master&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Master,</hi> idiot!" stormed the king. "I have no master, I myself <lb/>
am the m&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Silence, for God's sake!"</p>
<p>I got the words out in time to stop the king. We were in trouble <lb/>
enough already; it could not help us any to give these people the <lb/>
notion that we were lunatics.</p>
<p>There is no use in stringing out the details. The earl put us up <lb/>
and sold us at auction. This same infernal law had existed in our own <lb/>
South in my own time, more than thirteen hundred years later, and <lb/>
under it hundreds of freemen who could not prove that they were <reg orig="free-|men">freemen</reg> <lb/>
had been sold into life-long slavery without the circumstance <lb/>
making any particular impression upon me; but the minute law and <lb/>
the auction block came into my personal experience, a thing which <lb/>
had been merely improper before became suddenly hellish. Well, <lb/>
that's the way we are made.</p>
<p>Yes, we were sold at auction, like swine. In a big town and an <reg orig="act-|ive">active</reg> <lb/>
market we should have brought a good price; but this place was <lb/>
<pb n="450" entity="DSSR_000002494_0461"/>
utterly stagnant and so we sold at a figure which makes me ashamed, <lb/>
every time I think of it. The King of England brought seven dollars, <lb/>
and his prime minister nine; whereas the king was easily worth twelve <lb/>
dollars and I as easily worth fifteen. But that is the way things <lb/>
always go; if you force a sale on a dull market, I don't care what the <lb/>
property is, you are going to make a poor business of it, and you can <lb/>
make up your mind to it. If the earl had had wit enough to&mdash;</p>

<p>However, there is no occasion for my working my sympathies up <lb/>
on his account. Let him go, for the present: I took his number, so to <lb/>
speak.</p>
<p>The slave dealer bought us both, and hitched us onto that long <lb/>
chain of his, and we constituted the rear of his procession. We took <lb/>
up our line of march and passed out of Cambenet at noon; and it <lb/>

women, and under windows where sat the sweet and the lovely, and <lb/>
yet never attract a curious eye, never provoke a single remark. Dear, <lb/>
dear, it only shows that there is nothing diviner about a king than <lb/>
there is about a tramp, after all. He is just a cheap and hollow <reg orig="artifi-|ciality">artificiality</reg> <lb/>
when you don't know he is a king. But reveal his quality, and <lb/>

<head>CHAPTER XXXV.<lb/> A PITIFUL INCIDENT.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It's</hi> a world of surprises. The king brooded; <lb/>
this was natural. What would he brood about, <lb/>
should you say? Why, about the prodigious <lb/>
nature of his fall, of course&mdash;from the loftiest <lb/>
place in the world to the lowest; from the most <lb/>
illustrious station in the world to the obscurest; <lb/>
from the grandest vocation among men to the <lb/>
basest. No, I take my oath that the thing that <lb/>
graveled him most, to start with, was not this, but <lb/>
the price he had fetched! He <lb/>
couldn't seem to get over that <lb/>
seven dollars. Well, it stunned <lb/>
me so, when I first found it out, <lb/>
that I couldn't believe it; <lb/>
it didn't seem natural. <lb/>
But as soon as my <reg orig="men-|tal">mental</reg> <lb/>
sight cleared and I got <lb/>
a right focus on it, I saw I <lb/>
was <reg orig="mis-|taken">mistaken</reg>: <lb/>
it <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">was</hi> <reg orig="nat-|ural">natural</reg>. <lb/>
For <lb/>
this reason: a king is a mere artificiality, and <lb/>
so a king's feel-ings, like the impulses of an <lb/>
automatic doll, are mere artificialities; but as a <lb/>
man, he is a reality, and his feelings, as a man, are real, not <lb/>
 <!--<figure rend="inline" id="f169" entity="DSSR_000002494_0466"/>-->
<pb n="456" entity="DSSR_000002494_0467"/>
phantoms. It shames the average man to be valued below his own <lb/>
estimate of his worth; and the king certainly wasn't anything more <lb/>
than an average man, if he was up that high.</p>
<p>Confound him, he wearied me with arguments to show that in <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
like a fair market he would have fetched twenty-five dollars, sure <lb/>
&mdash;a thing which was plainly nonsense, and full of the baldest conceit; <lb/>
I wasn't worth it myself. But it was tender ground for me to argue <lb/>
on. In fact I had to simply shirk argument and do the diplomatic <reg orig="in-|stead">instead</reg>. <lb/>
I had to throw conscience aside, and brazenly concede that he <lb/>
ought to have brought twenty-five dollars; whereas I was quite well <lb/>
aware that in all the ages, the world had never seen a king that was <lb/>
worth half the money, and during the next thirteen centuries wouldn't <lb/>
see one that was worth the fourth of it. Yes, he tired me. If he began <lb/>
to talk about the crops; or about the recent weather; or about the <lb/>
condition of politics, or about dogs, or cats, or morals, or theology&mdash; <lb/>
no matter what&mdash;I sighed, for I knew what was coming: he was going <lb/>
to get out of it a palliation of that tiresome seven-dollar sale. <reg orig="Wher-|ever">Wherever</reg> <lb/>
we halted, where there was a crowd, he would give me a look <lb/>
which said, plainly: "if that thing could be tried over again, now, with <lb/>
this kind of folk, you would see a different result." Well, when he <lb/>
was first sold, it secretly tickled me to see him go for seven dollars; <lb/>
but before he was done with his sweating and worrying I wished he <lb/>
had fetched a hundred. The thing never got a chance to die, for <lb/>
every day, at one place or another, possible purchasers looked us over, <lb/>
and as often as any other way, their comment on the king was <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
like this:</p>
<p>"Here's a two-dollar-and-a-half chump with a thirty-dollar style. <lb/>
Pity but style was marketable."</p>
<p>At last this sort of remark produced an evil result. Our owner was <lb/>
a practical person and he perceived that this defect must be mended if <lb/>
he hoped to find a purchaser for the king. So he went to work to take <lb/>
<pb n="457" entity="DSSR_000002494_0468"/>
the style out of his sacred majesty. I could have given the man some <lb/>
valuable advice, but I didn't; you mustn't volunteer advice to a <reg orig="slave-|driver">slave-driver</reg> <lb/>
unless you want to damage the cause you are arguing for. I had <lb/>
found it a sufficiently difficult job to reduce the king's style to a <reg orig="peas-|ant's">peasant's</reg> <lb/>
style, even when he was a willing and anxious pupil; now then, <lb/>
to undertake to reduce the king's style to a slave's style&mdash;and by force <lb/>
&mdash;go to! it was a stately contract. Never mind the details&mdash;it will save <lb/>
me trouble to let you imagine them. I will only remark that at the <lb/>
end of a week there was plenty of evidence that lash and club and fist <lb/>
had done their work well; the king's body was a sight to see&mdash;and to <lb/>
weep over; but his spirit?&mdash;why, it wasn't even phased. Even that dull <lb/>
clod of a slave-driver was able to see that there can be such a thing as <lb/>
a slave who will remain a man till he dies; whose bones you can break, <lb/>
but whose manhood you can't. This man found that from his first effort <lb/>
down to his latest, he couldn't ever come within reach of the king but <lb/>
the king was ready to plunge for him, and did it. So he gave up, at <lb/>
last, and left the king in possession of his style unimpaired. The fact <lb/>

  <head>ON THE TRAMP.</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="458" entity="DSSR_000002494_0469"/>
is, the king was a good deal more than a king, he was a man; and <lb/>
when a man is a man, you can't knock it out of him.</p>
<p>We had a rough time for a month, tramping to and fro in the earth, <lb/>
and suffering. And what Englishman was the most interested in the <lb/>
slavery question by that time? His grace the king! Yes; from being <lb/>
the most indifferent, he was become the most interested. He was <reg orig="be-|come">become</reg> <lb/>
the bitterest hater of the institution I had ever heard talk. And <lb/>
so I ventured to ask once more a question which I had asked years <lb/>
before and had gotten such a sharp answer that I had not thought it <lb/>
prudent to meddle in the matter further. Would he abolish slavery?</p>
<p>His answer was as sharp as before, but it was music this time; I <lb/>
shouldn't ever wish to hear pleasanter, though the profanity was not <lb/>
good, being awkwardly put together, and with the crash-word almost <lb/>
in the middle instead of at the end, where of course it ought to have <lb/>
been.</p>
<p>I was ready and willing to get free, now; I hadn't wanted to get <lb/>
free any sooner. No, I cannot quite say that. I had wanted to, but I <lb/>
had not been willing to take desperate chances, and had always <reg orig="dis-|suaded">dissuaded</reg> <lb/>
the king from them. But now&mdash;ah, it was a new atmosphere! <lb/>
Liberty would be worth any cost that might be put upon it now. I set <lb/>
about a plan, and was straightway charmed with it. It would require <lb/>
time, yes, and patience, too, a great deal of both. One could invent <lb/>
quicker ways, and fully as sure ones; but none that would be as <reg orig="pict-|uresque">picturesque</reg> <lb/>
as this; none that could be made so dramatic. And so I was <lb/>
not going to give this one up. It might delay us months, but no <reg orig="mat-|ter">matter</reg>, <lb/>
I would carry it out or break something.</p>
<p>Now and then we had an adventure. One night we were overtaken <lb/>
by a snow-storm while still a mile from the village we were making <lb/>
for. Almost instantly we were shut up as in a fog, the driving snow <lb/>
was so thick. You couldn't see a thing, and we were soon lost. The <lb/>
slave-driver lashed us desperately, for he saw ruin before him, but his <lb/>
<pb n="459" entity="DSSR_000002494_0470"/>
lashings only made matters worse, for they drove us further from the <lb/>
road and from likelihood of succor. So we had to stop, at last, and <lb/>
slump down in the snow where we were. The storm continued until <lb/>
toward midnight, then ceased. By this time two of our feebler men <lb/>
and three of our women were dead, and others past moving and <reg orig="threat-|ened">threatened</reg> <lb/>
with death. Our master was nearly beside himself. He stirred <lb/>
up the living and made us stand, jump, slap ourselves, to restore our <lb/>
circulation, and he helped as well as he could with his whip.</p>
<p>Now came a diversion. We heard shrieks and yells, and soon a <lb/>
woman came running, and crying; and seeing our group, she flung <lb/>
herself into our midst and begged for protection. A mob of people <lb/>
came tearing after her, some with torches, and they said she was a <lb/>
witch who had caused several cows to die by a strange disease, and <lb/>
practiced her arts by help of a devil in the form of a black cat. This <lb/>
poor woman had been stoned until she hardly looked human, she was <lb/>
so battered and bloody. The mob wanted to burn her.</p>
<p>Well, now, what do you suppose our master did? When we closed <lb/>
around this poor creature to shelter her, he saw his chance. He said, <lb/>
burn her here, or they shouldn't have her at all. Imagine that! They <lb/>
were willing. They fastened her to a post; they brought wood and <lb/>
piled it about her; they applied the torch while she shrieked and <lb/>
pleaded and strained her two young daughters to her breast; and our <lb/>
brute, with a heart solely for business, lashed us into position about <lb/>
the stake and warmed us into life and commercial value by the same <lb/>
fire which took away the innocent life of that poor harmless mother. <lb/>
That was the sort of master we had. I took <hi rend="italic">his</hi> number. That <reg orig="snow-|storm">snowstorm</reg> <lb/>
cost him nine of his flock; and he was more brutal to us than <lb/>
ever, after that, for many days together, he was so enraged over his <lb/>
loss.</p>
<p>We had adventures, all along. One day we ran into a procession. <lb/>
And such a procession! All the riff-raff of the kingdom seemed to be <lb/>
<pb n="460" entity="DSSR_000002494_0471"/>
comprehended in it; and all drunk at that. In the van was a cart with <lb/>
a coffin in it, and on the coffin sat a comely young girl of about <reg orig="eight-|een">eighteen</reg> <lb/>
suckling a baby, which she squeezed to her breast in a passion of <lb/>
love every little while, and every little while wiped from its face the <lb/>
tears which her eyes rained down upon it; and always the foolish little <lb/>
thing smiled up at her, happy and content, kneading her breast with <lb/>
its dimpled fat hand, which she patted and fondled right over her <lb/>
breaking heart.</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f171" entity="DSSR_000002494_0471">
  <head>SLAVES WARMING THEMSELVES.</head>
 </figure>
<p>Men and women, boys and girls, trotted along beside or after the <lb/>
cart, hooting, shouting profane and ribald remarks, singing snatches of <lb/>
foul song, skipping, dancing&mdash;a very holiday of hellions, a sickening <lb/>
sight. We had struck a suburb of London, outside the walls, and this <lb/>
<pb n="461" entity="DSSR_000002494_0472"/>
was a sample of one sort of London society. Our master secured a <lb/>
good place for us near the gallows. A priest was in attendance, and <lb/>
he helped the girl climb up, and said comforting words to her, and <lb/>
made the under-sheriff provide a stool for her. Then he stood there <lb/>
by her on the gallows, and for a moment looked down upon the mass <lb/>
of upturned faces at his feet, then out over the solid pavement of heads <lb/>
that stretched away on every side occupying the vacancies far and <lb/>
near, and then began to tell the story of the case. And there was pity <lb/>
in his voice&mdash;how seldom a sound that was in that ignorant and <reg orig="sav-|age">savage</reg> <lb/>
land! I remember every detail of what he said, except the words <lb/>
he said it in; and so I change it into my own words:</p>
<p>"Law is intended to mete out justice. Sometimes it fails. This <lb/>
cannot be helped. We can only grieve, and be resigned, and pray for <lb/>
the soul of him who falls unfairly by the arm of the law, and that his <lb/>
fellows may be few. A law sends this poor young thing to death&mdash;and <lb/>
it is right. But another law had placed her where she must commit <lb/>
her crime or starve, with her child&mdash;and before God that law is <reg orig="respon-|sible">responsible</reg> <lb/>
for both her crime and her ignominious death!</p>
<p>"A little while ago this young thing, this child of eighteen years, <lb/>
was as happy a wife and mother as any in England; and her lips were <lb/>
blithe with song, which is the native speech of glad and innocent <lb/>
hearts. Her young husband was as happy as she; for he was doing <lb/>
his whole duty, he worked early and late at his handicraft, his bread <lb/>
was honest bread well and fairly earned, he was prospering, he was <lb/>
furnishing shelter and sustenance to his family, he was adding his mite <lb/>
to the wealth of the nation. By consent of a treacherous law, instant <lb/>
destruction fell upon this holy home and swept it away! That young <lb/>
husband was waylaid and impressed, and sent to sea. The wife knew <lb/>
nothing of it. She sought him everywhere, she moved the hardest <lb/>
hearts with the supplications of her tears, the broken eloquence of her <lb/>
despair. Weeks dragged by, she watching, waiting, hoping, her mind <lb/>
<pb n="462" entity="DSSR_000002494_0473"/>
going slowly to wreck under the burden of her misery. Little by little <lb/>
all her small possessions went for food. When she could no longer <lb/>
pay her rent, they turned her out of doors. She begged, while she had <lb/>
strength; when she was starving, at last, and her milk failing, she stole a <lb/>
piece of linen cloth of the value of a fourth part of a cent, thinking to <lb/>
sell it and save her child. But she was seen by the owner of the cloth. <lb/>
She was put in jail and brought to trial. The man testified to the <lb/>
facts. A plea was made for her, and her sorrowful story was told in <lb/>
her behalf. She spoke, too, by permission, and said she did steal the <lb/>
cloth, but that her mind was so disordered of late, by trouble, that <lb/>
when she was overborne with hunger all acts, criminal or other, swam <lb/>
meaningless through her brain and she knew nothing rightly, except <lb/>
that she was <hi rend="italic">so</hi> hungry! For a moment all were touched, and there <lb/>
was disposition to deal mercifully with her, seeing that she was so <lb/>
young and friendless, and her case so piteous, and the law that robbed <lb/>
her of her support to blame as being the first and only cause of her <lb/>
transgression; but the prosecuting officer replied that whereas these <lb/>
things were all true, and most pitiful as well, still there was much <lb/>

  <head>"A SAMPLE OF ONE SORT OF LONDON SOCIETY."</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="463" entity="DSSR_000002494_0474"/>
small theft in these days, and mistimed mercy here would be a danger <lb/>
to property&mdash;Oh, my God, is there no property in ruined homes, and <lb/>
orphaned babes, and broken hearts that British law holds precious!&mdash; <lb/>
and so he must require sentence.</p>
<p>"When the judge put on his black cap, the owner of the stolen <lb/>
linen rose trembling up, his lip quivering, his face as gray as ashes; <lb/>
and when the awful words came, he cried out, "Oh, poor child, poor <lb/>
child, I did not know it was death!" and fell as a tree falls. When <lb/>
they lifted him up his reason was gone; before the sun was set, he <lb/>
had taken his own life. A kindly man; a man whose heart was right, <lb/>
at bottom; add his murder to this that is to be now done here; and <lb/>
charge them both where they belong&mdash;to the rulers and the bitter laws <lb/>
of Britain. The time is come, my child; let me pray over thee&mdash;not <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">for</hi> thee, dear abused poor heart and innocent, but for them that be <lb/>
guilty of thy ruin and death, who need it more."</p>
<p>After his prayer they put the noose around the young girl's neck, <lb/>
and they had great trouble to adjust the knot under her ear, because <lb/>
she was devouring the baby all the time, wildly kissing it, and <reg orig="snatch-|ing">snatching</reg> <lb/>
it to her face and her breast, and drenching it with tears, and <lb/>
half moaning half shrieking all the while, and the baby crowing, and <lb/>
laughing, and kicking its feet with delight over what it took for romp <lb/>
and play. Even the hangman couldn't stand it, but turned away. <lb/>
When all was ready the priest gently pulled and tugged and forced the <lb/>
child out of the mother's arms, and stepped quickly out of her reach; <lb/>
but she clasped her hands, and made a wild spring toward him, with a <lb/>
shriek; but the rope&mdash;and the under-sheriff&mdash;held her short. Then <lb/>
she went on her knees and stretched out her hands and cried:</p>
<p>"One more kiss&mdash;Oh, my God, one more, one more,&mdash;it is the dying <lb/>
that begs it!"</p>
<p>She got it; she almost smothered the little thing. And when they <lb/>
got it away again, she cried out:</p>
<pb n="464" entity="DSSR_000002494_0475"/>
<p>"Oh, my child, my darling, it will die! It has no home, it has no <lb/>
father, no friend, no mother&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It has them all!" said that good priest. "All these will I be to <lb/>
it till I die."</p>
<p>You should have seen her face then! Gratitude? Lord, what do <lb/>
you want with words to express that? Words are only painted fire; <lb/>
a look is the fire itself. She gave that look, and carried it away to the <lb/>
treasury of heaven, where all things that are divine belong.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">London</hi>&mdash;to a slave&mdash;was a sufficiently <reg orig="inter-|esting">interesting</reg> <lb/>
place. It was merely a great big village; <lb/>
and mainly mud and thatch. The streets <lb/>
were muddy, crooked, unpaved. The <lb/>
populace was an ever flocking and <reg orig="drift-|ing">drifting</reg> <lb/>
swarm of rags, and splendors, of <lb/>
nodding plumes and shining armor. <lb/>
The king had a palace there; he saw <lb/>
the outside of it. It made him sigh; <lb/>
yes, and swear a little, in a poor <reg orig="juven-|ile">juvenile</reg> <lb/>
sixth century way. We saw knights <lb/>
and grandees whom we knew, but they <lb/>
didn't know us in our rags and dirt and <lb/>
raw welts and bruises, and wouldn't have <lb/>
recognized us if we had hailed them, nor <lb/>
stopped to answer, either, it being <reg orig="un-|lawful">unlawful</reg> <lb/>
to speak with slaves on a chain. <lb/>
Sandy passed within ten yards of me on <lb/>
a mule&mdash;hunting for me, I imagined. But <lb/>
the thing which clean broke my heart <lb/>
was some-thing which happened in <lb/>
front of our old barrack <lb/>
in a square, while <lb/>
we were <reg orig="en-|during">enduring</reg> <lb/>
the <lb/>

spectacle of a man being boiled to death in oil for counterfeiting <reg orig="pen-|nies">pennies</reg>. <lb/>
It was the sight of a newsboy&mdash;and I couldn't get at him! Still, <lb/>
I had one comfort; here was proof that Clarence was still alive and <lb/>
banging away. I meant to be with him before long; the thought was <lb/>
full of cheer.</p>
<p>I had one little glimpse of another thing, one day, which gave me a <lb/>
great uplift. It was a wire stretching from housetop to housetop. <reg orig="Tele-|graph">Telegraph</reg> <lb/>
or telephone, sure. I did very much wish I had a little piece of it. <lb/>
It was just what I needed, in order to carry out my project of escape. <lb/>
My idea was, to get loose some night, along with the king, then gag <lb/>
and bind our master, change clothes with him, batter him into the <lb/>
aspect of a stranger, hitch him to the slave-chain, assume possession <lb/>
of the property, march to Camelot, and&mdash;</p>

 </figure>
<p>But you get my idea; you see what a stunning dramatic surprise I <lb/>
would wind up with at the palace. It was all feasible, if I could only <lb/>
get hold of a slender piece of iron which I could shape into a <reg orig="lock-|pick">lock-pick</reg>. <lb/>
I could then undo the lumbering padlocks with which our chains <lb/>
were fastened, whenever I might choose. But I never had any luck; <lb/>
no such thing ever happened to fall in my way. However, my chance <lb/>
came at last. A gentleman who had come twice before to dicker for <lb/>
me, without result, or indeed any approach to a result, came again. I <lb/>
was far from expecting ever to belong to him, for the price asked for <lb/>
<pb n="469" entity="DSSR_000002494_0480"/>
me from the time I was first enslaved was exorbitant, and always <reg orig="pro-|voked">provoked</reg> <lb/>
either anger or derision, yet my master stuck stubbornly to it&mdash; <lb/>
twenty-two dollars. He wouldn't bate a cent. The king was greatly <lb/>
admired, because of his grand physique, but his kingly style was <lb/>
against him, and he wasn't salable; nobody wanted that kind of a <lb/>
slave. I considered myself safe from parting from him because of my <lb/>
extravagant price. No, I was not expecting to ever belong to this <lb/>
gentleman whom I have <lb/>
spoken of, but he had <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
which I expected <lb/>
would belong to me <reg orig="event-|ually">eventually</reg>, <lb/>
if he would but visit <lb/>
us often enough. It was a <lb/>
steel thing with a long pin <lb/>
to it, with which his long <lb/>
cloth outside garment was <lb/>
fastened together in front. <lb/>
There were three of them. <lb/>
He had disappointed me <lb/>
twice, because he did not <lb/>
come quite close enough to <lb/>
me to make my project <reg orig="en-|tirely">entirely</reg> <lb/>
safe; but this time I <lb/>
succeeded; I captured the lower clasp of the three, and when he <lb/>
missed it he thought he had lost it on the way.</p>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f176" entity="DSSR_000002494_0480">
  <head>SANDY RODE BY ON A MULE.</head>
 </figure>
<p>I had a chance to be glad about a minute, then straightway a chance <lb/>
to be sad again. For when the purchase was about to fail, as usual, <lb/>
the master suddenly spoke up and said what would be worded thus&mdash; <lb/>
in modern English:</p>
<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do. I'm tired supporting these two for no good. <lb/>
Give me twenty-two dollars for this one, and I'll throw the other one in."</p>
<pb n="470" entity="DSSR_000002494_0481"/>
<p>The king couldn't get his breath, he was in such a fury. He began <lb/>
to choke and gag, and meantime the master and the gentleman moved <lb/>
away, discussing.</p>
<p>"An ye will keep the offer open&mdash;"</p>
<p>"'Tis open till the morrow at this hour."</p>
<p>"Then will I answer you at that time," said the gentleman, and <lb/>
disappeared, the master following him.</p>
<p>I had a time of it to cool the king down, but I managed it. I <reg orig="whis-|pered">whispered</reg> <lb/>
in his ear, to this effect:</p>
<p>"Your grace <hi rend="italic">will</hi> go for nothing, but after another fashion. And <lb/>
so shall I. To-night we shall both be free."</p>
<p>"Ah! How is that?"</p>
<p>"With this thing which I have stolen, I will unlock these locks and <lb/>
cast off these chains to-night. When he comes about nine-thirty to <lb/>
inspect us for the night, we will seize him, gag him, batter him, and <lb/>
early in the morning we will march out of this town, proprietors of this <lb/>
caravan of slaves."</p>
<p>That was as far as I went, but the king was charmed and satisfied. <lb/>
That evening we waited patiently for our fellow-slaves to get to sleep <lb/>
and signify it by the usual sign, for you must not take many chances <lb/>
on those poor fellows if you can avoid it. It is best to keep your own <lb/>
secrets. No doubt they fidgeted only about as usual, but it didn't seem <lb/>
so to me. It seemed to me that they were going to be forever getting <lb/>
down to their regular snoring. As the time dragged on I got <reg orig="nerv-|ously">nervously</reg> <lb/>
afraid we shouldn't have enough of it left for our needs; so I made <lb/>
several premature attempts, and merely delayed things by it; for I <lb/>
couldn't seem to touch a padlock, there in the dark, without starting <lb/>
a rattle out of it which interrupted somebody's sleep and made him <lb/>
turn over and wake some more of the gang.</p>
<p>But finally I did get my last iron off, and was a free man once more. <lb/>
I took a good breath of relief, and reached for the king's irons. Too <lb/>
<pb n="471" entity="DSSR_000002494_0482"/>
late! in comes the master, with a light in one hand and his heavy <reg orig="walk-|ing-staff">walking-staff</reg> <lb/>
in the other. I snuggled close among the wallow of snorers, <lb/>
to conceal as nearly as possible that I was naked of irons; and I kept <lb/>
a sharp lookout and prepared to spring for my man the moment he <lb/>
should bend over me.</p>
<p>But he didn't approach. He stopped, gazed absently toward our <lb/>
dusky mass a minute, evidently thinking about something else; then <lb/>
set down his light, moved musingly toward the door, and before a body <lb/>
could imagine what he was going to do, he was out of <lb/>
the door and had closed it behind him.</p>
<p>"Quick!" said the king. "Fetch him back!"</p>
<p>Of course it was the thing to do, and I was up and <lb/>
out in a moment. <lb/>
But dear me, there <lb/>
were no lamps in <lb/>
those days, and it <lb/>
was a dark night. <lb/>
But I glimpsed a dim <reg orig="fig-|ure">figure</reg> <lb/>
a few steps away. I <lb/>
darted for it, threw myself <lb/>
upon it, and then there was a state of <lb/>
things and lively! We fought and scuffled <lb/>
and struggled, and drew a crowd in no time. <lb/>
They took an immense interest in the fight and encouraged us all they <lb/>
could, and in fact couldn't have been pleasanter or more cordial if it <lb/>
had been their own fight. Then a tremendous row broke out behind <lb/>
us, and as much as half of our audience left us, with a rush, to invest <lb/>
some sympathy in that. Lanterns began to swing in all directions; it <lb/>
was the watch, gathering from far and near. Presently a halberd fell <lb/>
across my back, as a reminder, and I knew what it meant. I was in <lb/>
custody. So was my adversary. We were marched off toward <lb/>

prison, one on each side of the watchman. Here was disaster, here <lb/>
was a fine scheme gone to sudden destruction! I tried to imagine what <lb/>
would happen when the master should discover that it was I who had <lb/>
been fighting him; and what would happen if they jailed us together <lb/>
in the general apartment for brawlers and petty law breakers, as was <lb/>
the custom; and what might&mdash;</p>
<p>Just then my antagonist turned his face around in my direction, the <lb/>
freckled light from the watchman's tin lantern fell on it, and by George <lb/>
he was the wrong man!</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Sleep?</hi> It was impossible. It would naturally <lb/>
have been impossible in that noisome cavern <lb/>
of a jail, with its mangy crowd of drunken, <lb/>
quarrelsome and song-singing rapscallions. But <lb/>
the thing that made sleep all the more a thing <lb/>
not to be dreamed of, was my racking <reg orig="impati-|ence">impatience</reg> <lb/>
to get out of this place and find out the <lb/>

in consequence of that <lb/>

<p>It was a long night <lb/>
but the morning got <lb/>
around at last. I made <lb/>
a full and frank <reg orig="expla-|nation">explanation</reg> <lb/>
to the court. I <lb/>
said I was a slave, the <lb/>
property of the great <lb/>
Earl Grip, who had <lb/>
arrived just after <lb/>
dark at the Tabard <lb/>
inn in the village on the other side of the water, <lb/>
and had stopped there over night, by compulsion, he <lb/>
being taken deadly sick with a strange and sudden <lb/>

disorder. I had been ordered to cross to the city in all haste and <lb/>
bring the best physician; I was doing my best; naturally I was running <lb/>
with all my might; the night was dark, I ran against this common <reg orig="per-|son">person</reg> <lb/>
here, who seized me by the throat and began to pummel me, <lb/>
although I told him my errand, and implored him, for the sake of <lb/>
the great earl my master's mortal peril&mdash;</p>
<p>The common person interrupted and said it was a lie; and was <reg orig="go-|ing">going</reg> <lb/>
to explain how I rushed upon him and attacked him without a <lb/>
word&mdash;</p>
<p>"Silence, sirrah!" from the court. "Take him hence and give <lb/>
him a few stripes whereby to teach him how to treat the servant of a <lb/>
nobleman after a <reg orig="dif-|ferent">different</reg> <lb/>
fashion another <lb/>
time. Go!"</p>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f180" entity="DSSR_000002494_0487">
  <head>"IT LAY THERE ALL BATTERED TO PULP."</head>
 </figure>
<p>Then the court <lb/>
begged my pardon, <lb/>
and hoped I would <lb/>
not fail to tell his <reg orig="lord-|ship">lordship</reg> <lb/>
it was in no wise <lb/>
the court's fault that this high-handed thing had happened. I said I <lb/>
would make it all right, and so took my leave. Took it just in time, <lb/>
too; he was starting to ask me why I did'nt fetch out these facts the <lb/>
moment I was arrested. I said I would if I had thought of it&mdash;which <lb/>
was true&mdash;but that I was so battered by that man that all my wit was <lb/>
knocked out of me&mdash;and so forth and so on, and got myself away, still <lb/>
mumbling.</p>
<p>I didn't wait for breakfast. No grass grew under my feet. I was <lb/>
soon at the slave quarters. Empty&mdash;everybody gone! That is, <reg orig="every-|body">everybody</reg> <lb/>
except one body&mdash;the slave-master's. It lay there all battered <lb/>
to pulp; and all about were the evidences of a terrific fight. There <lb/>
was a rude board coffin on a cart at the door, and workmen, assisted <lb/>
<pb n="477" entity="DSSR_000002494_0488"/>
by the police, were thinning a road through the gaping crowd in order <lb/>
that they might bring it in.</p>
<p>I picked out a man humble enough in life to condescend to talk <lb/>
with one so shabby as I, and got his account of the matter.</p>
<p>"There were sixteen slaves here. They rose against their master <lb/>
in the night, and thou seest how it ended."</p>
<p>"Yes. How did it begin?"</p>
<p>"There was no witness but the slaves. They said the slave that <lb/>
was most valuable got free of his bonds and escaped in some strange <lb/>
way&mdash;by magic arts 'twas thought, by reason that he had no key, and <lb/>
the locks were neither broke nor in any wise injured. When the <reg orig="mas-|ter">master</reg> <lb/>
discovered his loss, he was mad with despair, and threw himself <lb/>
upon his people with his heavy stick, who resisted and brake his back <lb/>
and in other and divers ways did give him hurts that brought him <lb/>
swiftly to his end."</p>
<p>"This is dreadful. It will go hard with the slaves, no doubt, upon <lb/>
the trial."</p>
<p>"Marry, the trial is over."</p>
<p>"Over!"</p>
<p>"Would they be a week, think you&mdash;and the matter so simple? <lb/>
They were not the half of a quarter of an hour at it."</p>
<p>"Why, I don't see how they could determine which were the guilty <lb/>
ones in so short a time."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Which</hi> ones? Indeed they considered not particulars like to that. <lb/>
They condemned them in a body. Wit ye not the law?&mdash;which men <lb/>
say the Romans left behind them here when they went&mdash;that if one <lb/>
slave killeth his master all the slaves of that man must die for it."</p>
<p>"True. I had forgotten. And when will these die?"</p>
<p>"Belike within a four and twenty hours; albeit some say they will <lb/>
wait a pair of days more, if peradventure they may find the missing one <lb/>
meantime."</p>
<pb n="478" entity="DSSR_000002494_0489"/>
<p>The missing one! It made me feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Is it likely they will find him?"</p>
<p>"Before the day is spent&mdash;yes. They seek him everywhere. They <lb/>
stand at the gates of the town, with certain of the slaves who will <reg orig="dis-|cover">discover</reg> <lb/>
him to them if he cometh, and none can pass out but he will be <lb/>
first examined."</p>
<p>"Might one see the place where the rest are confined?"</p>
<p>"The outside of it&mdash;yes. The inside of it&mdash;but ye will not want to <lb/>
see that."</p>
<p>I took the address of that prison, for future reference, and then <reg orig="saunt-|ered">sauntered</reg> <lb/>
off. At the first second-hand clothing shop I came to, up a back <lb/>
street, I got a rough rig suitable for a common seaman who might be <lb/>
going on a cold voyage, and bound up my face with a liberal bandage, <lb/>
saying I had a toothache. This concealed my worst bruises. It was <lb/>
a transformation. I no longer resembled my former self. Then I <lb/>
struck out for that wire, found it and followed it to its den. It was a <lb/>
little room over a butcher's shop&mdash;which meant that business wasn't <lb/>
very brisk in the telegraphic line. The young chap in charge was <lb/>
drowsing at his table. I locked the door and put the vast key in my <lb/>
bosom. This alarmed the young fellow, and he was going to make a <lb/>
noise; but I said:</p>
<p>"Save your wind; if you open your mouth you are dead, sure. <lb/>
Tackle your instrument. Lively, now! Call Camelot."</p>
<p>"This doth amaze me! How should such as you know aught of <lb/>
such matters as&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Call Camelot! I am a desperate man. Call Camelot, or get away <lb/>
from the instrument and I will do it myself."</p>
<p>"What&mdash;you?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;certainly. Stop gabbling. Call the palace." He made the <lb/>
call.</p>
<p>"Now then, call Clarence."</p>
<pb n="479" entity="DSSR_000002494_0490"/>
<p>"Clarence <hi rend="italic">who?</hi>"</p>
<p>"Never mind Clarence who. Say you want Clarence; you'll get <lb/>
an answer."</p>
<p>He did so. We waited five nerve-straining minutes&mdash;ten minutes <lb/>
&mdash;how long it did seem!&mdash;and then came a click that was as familiar <lb/>
to me as a human voice; for Clarence had been my own pupil.</p>
<p>"Now, my lad, vacate! They wouldn't have known <hi rend="italic">my</hi> touch, <reg orig="may-|be">maybe</reg>, <lb/>
and so your call was surest; but I'm all right, now."</p>
<p>He vacated the place and cocked his ear to listen&mdash;but it didn't <lb/>
win. I used a cipher. I <lb/>
didn't waste any time in <lb/>
sociabilities with Clarence, <lb/>
but squared away for <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg>, <lb/>
straight-off&mdash;thus:</p>
<p>"The king is here and <lb/>
in danger. We were <reg orig="cap-|tured">captured</reg> <lb/>
and brought here as <lb/>
slaves. We should not be <lb/>
able to prove our identity <lb/>
&mdash;and the fact is, I am not <lb/>
in a position to try. Send <lb/>
a telegram for the palace here which will carry conviction with it."</p>
<p>His answer came straight back:</p>
<p>"They don't know anything about the telegraph; they haven't had <lb/>
any experience yet, the line to London is so new. Better not venture <lb/>
that. They might hang you. Think up something else."</p>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f181" entity="DSSR_000002494_0490">
  <head>STREETS OF LONDON.</head>
 </figure>
<p>Might hang us! Little he knew how closely he was crowding the <lb/>
facts. I couldn't think up anything for the moment. Then an idea <lb/>
struck me, and I started it along:</p>
<p>"Send five hundred picked knights with Launcelot in the lead; <lb/>
and send them on the jump. Let them enter by the southwest <lb/>
<pb n="480" entity="DSSR_000002494_0491"/>
gate, and look out for the man with a white cloth around his <lb/>
right arm."</p>
<p>The answer was prompt:</p>
<p>"They shall start in half an hour."</p>
<p>"All right, Clarence; now tell this lad here that I'm a friend of <lb/>
yours and a dead-head; and that he must be discreet and say nothing <lb/>
about this visit of mine."</p>
<p>The instrument began to talk to the youth and I hurried away. I <lb/>
fell to ciphering. In half an hour it would be nine o'clock. Knights <lb/>
and horses in heavy armor couldn't travel very fast. These would <lb/>
make the best time they could, and now that the ground was in good <lb/>
condition, and no snow or mud, they would probably make a <reg orig="seven-|mile">seven-mile</reg> <lb/>
gait; they would have to change horses a couple of times; they <lb/>
would arrive about six, or a little after; it would still be plenty light <lb/>
enough; they would see the white cloth which I should tie around my <lb/>
right arm, and I would take command. We would surround that prison <lb/>
and have the king out in no time. It would be showy and picturesque <lb/>
enough, all things considered, though I would have preferred noonday, <lb/>
on account of the more theatrical aspect the thing would have.</p>
<p>Now then, in order to increase the strings to my bow, I thought I <lb/>
would look up some of those people whom I had formerly recognized, <lb/>
and make myself known. That would help us out of our scrape, <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
the knights. But I must proceed cautiously, for it was a risky <lb/>
business. I must get into sumptuous raiment, and it wouldn't do to <lb/>
run and jump into it. No, I must work up to it by degrees, buying <lb/>
suit after suit of clothes, in shops wide apart, and getting a little finer <lb/>
article with each change, until I should finally reach silk and velvet, <lb/>
and be ready for my project. So I started.</p>
<p>But the scheme fell through like scat! The first corner I turned, I <lb/>
came plump upon one of our slaves, snooping around with a watchman. <lb/>
I coughed, at the moment, and he gave me a sudden look that bit right <lb/>
<pb n="481" entity="DSSR_000002494_0492"/>
into my marrow. I judge he thought he had heard that cough before. <lb/>
I turned immediately into a shop and worked along down the counter, <lb/>
pricing things and watching out of the corner of my eye. Those people <lb/>
had stopped, and were talking together and looking in at the door. I <lb/>
made up my mind to get out the back way, if there was a back way, <lb/>
and I asked the shopwoman if I could step out there and look for the <lb/>
escaped slave, who was believed to be in hiding back there somewhere, <lb/>
and said I was an officer in disguise, and my pard was yonder at the <lb/>
door with one of the murderers in charge, and would she be good <lb/>
enough to step there and tell him he needn't wait, but had better go <lb/>
at once to the further end of the back alley and be ready to head him <lb/>
off when I rousted him out.</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f182" entity="DSSR_000002494_0492">
  <head>"HE GAVE ME A SUDDEN LOOK THAT BIT RIGHT INTO MY MARROW."</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="482" entity="DSSR_000002494_0493"/>
<p>She was blazing with eagerness to see one of those already <reg orig="cele-|brated">celebrated</reg> <lb/>
murderers, and she started on the errand at once. I slipped <lb/>
out the back way, locked the door behind me, put the key in my <lb/>
pocket and started off, chuckling to myself and comfortable.</p>
<p>Well, I had gone and spoiled it again, made another mistake. A <lb/>
double one, in fact. There were plenty of ways to get rid of that <reg orig="offi-|cer">officer</reg> <lb/>
by some simple and plausible device, but no, I must pick out a <lb/>
picturesque one; it is the crying defect of my character. And then, I <lb/>
had ordered my procedure upon what the officer, being human, would <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">naturally</hi> do; whereas when you are least expecting it, a man will now <lb/>
and then go and do the very thing which it's <hi rend="italic">not</hi> natural for him to do. <lb/>
The natural thing for the officer to do, in this case, was to follow <lb/>
straight on my heels; he would find a stout oaken door, securely <reg orig="lock-|ed">locked</reg>, <lb/>
between him and me; before he could break it down, I should be <lb/>
far away and engaged in slipping into a succession of baffling disguises <lb/>
which would soon get me into a sort of raiment which was a surer <reg orig="pro-|tection">protection</reg> <lb/>
from meddling law-dogs in Britain than any amount of mere <lb/>
innocence and purity of character. But instead of doing the natural <lb/>
thing, the officer took me at my word, and followed my instructions. <lb/>
And so, as I came trotting out of that cul de sac, full of satisfaction with <lb/>
my own cleverness, he turned the corner and I walked right into his <lb/>
handcuffs. If I had known it was a cul de sac&mdash;however, there isn't any <lb/>
excusing a blunder like that, let it go. Charge it up to profit and <lb/>
loss.</p>
<p>Of course I was indignant, and swore I had just come ashore from <lb/>
a long voyage, and all that sort of thing&mdash;just to see, you know, if it <lb/>
would deceive that slave. But it didn't. He knew me. Then I <reg orig="re-|proached">reproached</reg> <lb/>
him for betraying me. He was more surprised than hurt. <lb/>
He stretched his eyes wide, and said:</p>
<p>"What, wouldst have me let thee, of all men, escape and not hang <lb/>
with us, when thou'rt the very <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of our hanging? Go to!"</p>
<pb n="483" entity="DSSR_000002494_0494"/>
<p>"Go to" was their way of saying "I should smile!" or "I like <lb/>
that!" Queer talkers, those people.</p>
<p>Well, there was a sort of bastard justice in his view of the case, and <lb/>
so I dropped the matter. When you can't cure a disaster by <reg orig="argu-|ment">argument</reg>, <lb/>
what is the use to argue? It isn't my way. So I only said:</p>
<p>"You're not going to be hanged. None of us are."</p>
<p>Both men laughed, and the slave said:</p>
<p>"Ye have not ranked as a fool&mdash;before. You might better keep <lb/>
your reputation, seeing the strain would not be for long."</p>
<p>"It will stand it, I reckon. Before to-morrow we shall be out of <lb/>
prison, and free to go where we will, besides."</p>
<p>The witty officer lifted at his left ear with his thumb, made a <reg orig="rasp-|ing">rasping</reg> <lb/>
noise in his throat, and said:</p>
<p>"Out of prison&mdash;yes&mdash;ye say true. And free likewise to go where <lb/>
ye will, so ye wander not out of his grace the Devil's sultry realm."</p>
<p>I kept my temper, and said, indifferently:</p>
<p>"Now I suppose you really think we are going to hang within a <lb/>
day or two."</p>
<p>"I thought it not many minutes ago, for so the thing was decided <lb/>
and proclaimed."</p>
<p>"Ah, then you've changed your mind, is that it?"</p>
<p>"Even that. I only <hi rend="italic">thought,</hi> then; I <hi rend="italic">know,</hi> now."</p>
<p>I felt sarcastical, so I said:</p>
<p>"Oh, sapient servant of the law, condescend to tell us, then, what <lb/>
you <hi rend="italic">know.</hi>"</p>
<p>"That ye will all be hanged <hi rend="italic">to-day,</hi> at mid-afternoon! Oho! that <lb/>
shot hit home! Lean upon me."</p>
<p>The fact is I did need to lean upon somebody. My knights <lb/>
couldn't arrive in time. They would be as much as three hours too <lb/>
late. Nothing in the world could save the King of England; nor me, <lb/>
which was more important. More important, not merely to me, but to <lb/>
<pb n="484" entity="DSSR_000002494_0495"/>
the nation&mdash;the only nation on earth standing ready to blossom into <lb/>
civilization. I was sick. I said no more, there wasn't anything to say. <lb/>
I knew what the man meant; that if the missing slave was found, the <lb/>
postponement would be revoked, the execution take place to-day. <lb/>
Well, the missing slave was found.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<lb/> SIR LAUNCELOT AND KNIGHTS TO THE RESCUE.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Nearing</hi> four in the afternoon. The scene was just <reg orig="out-|side">outside</reg> <lb/>
the walls of London. A cool, comfortable, superb <lb/>
day, with a brilliant sun; the kind of day to make one <lb/>
want to live, not die. The multitude was prodigious <lb/>
and far reaching; and yet we fifteen poor devils hadn't a <lb/>
friend in it. There was something painful in that thought, <lb/>
look at it how you might. There we sat, on our tall <reg orig="scaf-|fold">scaffold</reg>, <lb/>
the butt of the hate and <reg orig="mock-|ery">mockery</reg> <lb/>
of all those enemies. We were <lb/>
being made a holiday spectacle. <lb/>
They had built a sort of <lb/>
grand stand for the <reg orig="nobil-|ity">nobility</reg> <lb/>
and gentry, and these <lb/>
were there in full <lb/>
force, with <lb/>
their ladies. <lb/>
We <reg orig="recog-|nized">recognized</reg> <lb/>
a <lb/>
good many <lb/>
of them.</p>
<p>The crowd <lb/>

and <reg orig="unex-|pected">unexpected</reg> <lb/>

out of the king. The moment we were freed of our bonds he sprang <lb/>
up, in his fantastic rags, with face bruised out of all recognition, and <lb/>
proclaimed himself Arthur, King of Britain, and denounced the awful <lb/>
penalties of treason upon every soul there present if hair of his sacred <lb/>
head were touched. It startled and surprised him to hear them break <lb/>
into a vast roar of laughter. It wounded his dignity, and he locked <lb/>
himself up in silence, then, although the crowd begged him to go on, <lb/>
and tried to provoke him to it by cat-calls, jeers, and shouts of</p>
<p>"Let him speak! The king! The King! his humble subjects <reg orig="hun-|ger">hunger</reg> <lb/>
and thirst for words of wisdom out of the mouth of their master his <lb/>
Serene and Sacred Raggedness!"</p>
<p>But it went for nothing. He put on all his majesty and sat under <lb/>
this rain of contempt and insult unmoved. He certainly was great in <lb/>
his way. Absently, I had taken off my white bandage and wound it <lb/>
about my right arm. When the crowd noticed this, they began upon <lb/>
me. They said:</p>
<p>"Doubtless this sailor-man is his minister&mdash;observe his costly badge <lb/>
of office!"</p>
<p>I let them go on until they got tired, and then I said:</p>
<p>"Yes, I am his minister, The Boss; and to-morrow you will hear <lb/>
that from Camelot which&mdash;"</p>
<p>I got no further. They drowned me out with joyous derision. But <lb/>
presently there was silence; for the sheriffs of London, in their official <lb/>
robes, with their subordinates, began to make a stir which indicated <lb/>
that business was about to begin. In the hush which followed, our <lb/>
crime was recited, the death warrant read, then everybody uncovered <lb/>
while a priest uttered a prayer.</p>
<p>Then a slave was blindfolded, the hangman unslung his rope. <lb/>
There lay the smooth road below us, we upon one side of it, the banked <lb/>
multitude walling its other side&mdash;a good clear road, and kept free by <lb/>
the police&mdash;how good it would be to see my five hundred horsemen <lb/>

come tearing down it! But, no, it was out of the <reg orig="possi-|bilities">possibilities</reg>. <lb/>
I followed its receding thread out into the <lb/>
distance&mdash;not a horseman on it, or sign of one.</p>
<p>There was a jerk, and the slave <lb/>
hung dangling; dangling and <reg orig="hid-|eously">hideously</reg> <lb/>
squirming, for his <lb/>
limbs were not tied.</p>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f186" entity="DSSR_000002494_0501">
  <head>"WHO FAILS SHALL SUP IN HELL TO-NIGHT."</head>
 </figure>
<p>A second rope <lb/>
was unslung, in a moment <lb/>
another slave was dangling.</p>
<p>In a minute a third slave <lb/>
was struggling in the air. It <lb/>
was dreadful. I turned away <lb/>
my head a moment, and when <lb/>
I turned back I missed the <lb/>
king! They were <reg orig="blindfold-|ing">blindfolding</reg> <lb/>
him! I was paralyzed; I <lb/>
couldn't move, I was <reg orig="chok-|ing">choking</reg>, <lb/>
my tongue was petrified. <lb/>
They finished <reg orig="blind-|folding">blindfolding</reg> <lb/>
him, they led <lb/>
him under the rope. I <lb/>
couldn't shake off that <lb/>
clinging impotence. But <lb/>
when I saw them put the noose around his neck, then everything let <lb/>
go in me and I made a spring to the rescue&mdash;and as I made it I shot <lb/>
one more glance abroad&mdash;by George, here they came, a-tilting!&mdash;five <lb/>
hundred mailed and belted knights on bicycles!</p>
<p>The grandest sight that ever was seen. Lord, how the plumes <lb/>
streamed, how the sun flamed and flashed from the endless procession <lb/>
of webby wheels!</p>
<pb n="491" entity="DSSR_000002494_0502"/>
<p>I waved my right arm as Launcelot swept in&mdash;he recognized my <lb/>
rag&mdash;I tore away noose and bandage, and shouted:</p>
<p>"On your knees, every rascal of you, and salute the king! Who <lb/>
fails shall sup in hell to-night!"</p>
<p>I always use that high style when I'm climaxing an effect. Well, <lb/>
it was noble to see Launcelot and the boys swarm up onto that scaffold <lb/>
and heave sheriffs and such overboard. And it was fine to see that <lb/>
astonished multitude go down on their knees and beg their lives of the <lb/>
king they had just been deriding and insulting. And as he stood <lb/>
apart, there, receiving this homage in his rags, I thought to myself, <lb/>
well really there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> something peculiarly grand about the gait and <lb/>
bearing of a king, after all.</p>
<p>I was immensely satisfied. Take the whole situation all around, it <lb/>
was one of the gaudiest effects I ever instigated.</p>
<p>And presently up comes Clarence, his own self! and winks, and <lb/>
says, very modernly:</p>
<p>"Good deal of a surprise, wasn't it? I knew you'd like it. I've had <lb/>
the boys practicing, this long time, privately; and just hungry for a <lb/>
chance to show off."</p>

<p>Up to the day set, there was no talk in all Britain of anything but <lb/>
this combat. All other topics sank into insignificance and passed out <lb/>
of men's thoughts and interest. It was not because a tournament was <lb/>
a great matter; it was not because Sir Sagramour had found the Holy <lb/>
Grail, for he had not, but had failed; it was not because the second <lb/>
(official) personage in the kingdom was one of the duellists; no, all <lb/>
these features were commonplace. Yet there was abundant reason <lb/>
for the extraordinary interest which this coming fight was creating. <lb/>
It was born of the fact that all the nation knew that this was not to be <lb/>
a duel between mere men, so to speak, but a duel between two mighty <lb/>
magicians; a duel not of muscle but of mind, not of human skill but of <lb/>
superhuman art and craft; a final struggle for supremacy between the <lb/>
two master enchanters of the age. It was realized that the most <lb/>
prodigious achievements of the most renowned knights could not be <lb/>
worthy of comparison with a spectacle like this; they could be but <lb/>
child's play, contrasted with this mysterious and awful battle of the <lb/>
gods. Yes, all the world knew it was going to be in reality a duel <lb/>
between Merlin and me, a measuring of his magic powers against mine. <lb/>
It was known that Merlin had been busy whole days and nights <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg>, <lb/>
imbuing Sir Sagramour's arms and armor with supernal <reg orig="pow-|ers">powers</reg> <lb/>
of offence and defence, and that he had procured for him from the <lb/>
spirits of the air a fleecy veil which would render the wearer invisible <lb/>
to his antagonist while still visible to other men. Against Sir <reg orig="Sagra-|mour">Sagramour</reg>, <lb/>
so weaponed and protected, a thousand knights could <reg orig="accom-|plish">accomplish</reg> <lb/>
nothing; against him no known enchantments could prevail. <lb/>
These facts were sure; regarding them there was no doubt, no reason <lb/>
for doubt. There was but one question: might there be still other <reg orig="en-|chantments">enchantments</reg>, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">unknown</hi> to Merlin, which could render Sir Sagramour's <lb/>
veil transparent to me, and make his enchanted mail vulnerable to my <lb/>
weapons? This was the one thing to be decided in the lists. Until <lb/>
then the world must remain in suspense.</p>
<pb n="498" entity="DSSR_000002494_0509"/>
<p>So the world thought there was a vast matter at stake here, and <lb/>
the world was right, but it was not the one they had in their minds. <lb/>
No, a far vaster one was upon the cast of this die: <hi rend="italic">the life of knight-</hi> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">errantry.</hi> I was a champion, it was true, but not the champion of the <lb/>
frivolous black arts, I was the champion of hard unsentimental <reg orig="com-|mon-sense">common-sense</reg> <lb/>
and reason. I was entering the lists to either destroy <lb/>
knight-errantry or be its victim.</p>
<p>Vast as the show-grounds were, there were no vacant spaces in <lb/>
them outside of the lists, at ten o'clock on the morning of the 16th. <lb/>
The mammoth grand stand was clothed in flags, streamers, and rich <lb/>
tapestries, and packed with several acres of small-fry tributary kings, <lb/>
their suites, and the British aristocracy; with our own royal gang in <lb/>
the chief place, and each and every individual a flashing prism of gaudy <lb/>
silks and velvets&mdash;well, I never saw anything to begin with it but a <lb/>
fight between an Upper Mississippi sunset and the aurora borealis. <lb/>
The huge camp of beflagged and gay-colored tents at one end of the <lb/>
lists, with a stiff-standing sentinel at every door and a shining shield <lb/>
hanging by him for challenge, was another fine sight. You see, every <lb/>
knight was there who had any ambition or any caste feeling; for my <lb/>
feeling toward their order was not much of a secret, and so here was <lb/>
their chance. If I won my fight with Sir Sagramour, others would <lb/>
have the right to call me out as long as I might be willing to respond.</p>
<p>Down at our end there were but two tents; one for me, and another <lb/>
for my servants. At the appointed hour the king made a sign, and the <lb/>
heralds, in their tabards, appeared and made proclamation, naming <lb/>
the combatants and stating the cause of quarrel. There was a pause, <lb/>
then a ringing bugle blast, which was the signal for us to come forth. <lb/>
All the multitude caught their breath, and an eager curiosity flashed <lb/>
into every face.</p>
<p>Out from his tent rode great Sir Sagramour, an imposing tower of <lb/>
iron, stately and rigid, his huge spear standing upright in its socket <lb/>
<pb n="499" entity="DSSR_000002494_0510"/>
and grasped in his strong hand, his grand horse's face and breast <lb/>
cased in steel, his body clothed in rich trappings that almost dragged <lb/>
the ground&mdash;oh, a most noble picture. A great shout went up, of <lb/>
welcome and admiration.</p>
<p>And then out I came. But I didn't get any shout. There was a <lb/>
wondering and eloquent silence, for a moment, then a great wave of <lb/>
laughter began to sweep along that human sea, but a warning <reg orig="bugle-|blast">bugle-blast</reg> <lb/>
cut its career short. I was in the simplest <lb/>
and comfortablest of gymnast <reg orig="costumes&mdash;flesh-|colored">costumes&mdash;flesh-colored</reg> <lb/>
tights from neck to heel, with <lb/>
blue silk puffings about my <lb/>
loins, and <reg orig="bare-|headed">bareheaded</reg>. <lb/>
My horse <lb/>
was not above <lb/>
medium size, but <lb/>
he was alert, <reg orig="slen-|der-limbed">slender-limbed</reg>, <lb/>
muscled <lb/>
with watch-springs, and just a greyhound to go. He was a beauty, <lb/>
glossy as silk, and naked as he was when he was born, except for <lb/>
bridle and ranger-saddle.</p>
<p>The iron tower and the gorgeous bed-quilt came cumbrously <lb/>
but gracefully pirouetting down the lists, and we tripped lightly <lb/>
up to meet them. We halted; the tower saluted, I responded; <lb/>
then we wheeled and rode side by side to the grand stand and <lb/>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f189" entity="DSSR_000002494_0510">
  <head>"GO IT, SLIM JIM!"</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="500" entity="DSSR_000002494_0511"/>
faced our king and queen, to whom we made obeisance. The queen <lb/>
exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Alack, Sir Boss, wilt fight naked, and without lance or sword or&mdash;"</p>
<p>But the king checked her and made her understand, with a polite <lb/>
phrase or two, that this was none of her business. The bugles rang <lb/>
again; and we separated and rode to the ends of the lists, and took <lb/>
position. Now old Merlin stepped into view and cast a dainty web of <lb/>
gossamer threads over Sir Sagramour which turned him into Hamlet's <lb/>
ghost; the king made a sign, the bugles blew, Sir Sagramour laid his <lb/>
great lance in rest, and the next moment here he came thundering <lb/>
down the course with his veil flying out behind, and I went whistling <lb/>
through the air like an arrow to meet him&mdash;cocking my ear, the while, <lb/>
as if nothing the invisible knight's position and progress by hearing, not <lb/>
sight. A chorus of encouraging shouts burst out for him, and one <lb/>
brave voice flung out a heartening word for me&mdash;said:</p>
<p>"Go it, slim Jim!"</p>
<p>It was an even bet that Clarence had procured that favor for me&mdash; <lb/>
and furnished the language, too. When that formidable lance-point <lb/>
was within a yard and a half of my breast I twitched my horse aside <lb/>
without an effort and the big knight swept by, scoring a blank. I got <lb/>
plenty of applause that time. We turned, braced up, and down we <lb/>
came again. Another blank for the knight, a roar of applause for <lb/>
me. This same thing was repeated once more; and it fetched such a <lb/>
whirlwind of applause that Sir Sagramour lost his temper, and at once <lb/>
changed his tactics and set himself the task of chasing me down. <lb/>
Why, he hadn't any show in the world at that; it was a game of tag, <lb/>
with all the advantage on my side; I whirled out of his path with ease <lb/>
whenever I chose, and once I slapped him on the back as I went to <lb/>
the rear. Finally I took the chase into my own hands; and after that, <lb/>
turn, or twist, or do what he would, he was never able to get behind <lb/>
me again; he found himself always in front, at the end of his maneuvre. <lb/>

So he gave up that business and retired to his end of the lists. His <lb/>
temper was clear gone, now, and he forgot himself and flung an insult <lb/>
at me which disposed of mine. I slipped my lasso from the horn of <lb/>
my saddle, and grasped the coil in my right hand. This time you <lb/>
should have seen him come!&mdash;it was a business trip, sure; by his gait <lb/>
there was blood in his eye. I was sitting my horse at ease, and <reg orig="swing-|ing">swinging</reg> <lb/>
the great loop of my lasso in wide circles about my head; the <lb/>
moment he was under way, I started for him; when the space between <lb/>
us had narrowed to forty feet, I sent the snaky spirals of the rope <lb/>
a-cleaving through the air, then darted aside and faced about and <lb/>
brought my trained animal to a halt with all his feet braced under <lb/>
him for a surge. The next moment the rope sprang taut and yanked <lb/>
Sir Sagramour out of the saddle! Great Scott, but there was a <reg orig="sensa-|tion">sensation</reg>!</p>
<p>Unquestionably the popular thing in this world is novelty. These <lb/>
people had never seen anything of that cow-boy business before, and <lb/>
it carried them clear off their feet with delight. From all around and <lb/>
everywhere, the shout went up&mdash;</p>
<p>"Encore! encore!"</p>
<p>I wondered where they got the word, but there was no time to <lb/>
cipher on philological matters, because the whole knight-errantry hive <lb/>
was just humming, now, and my prospect for trade couldn't have been <lb/>
better. The moment my lasso was released and Sir Sagramour had <lb/>
been assisted to his tent, I hauled in the slack, took my station and <lb/>
began to swing my loop around my head again. I was sure to have <lb/>
use for it as soon as they could elect a successor for Sir Sagramour, <lb/>
and that couldn't take long where there were so many hungry <reg orig="candi-|dates">candidates</reg>. <lb/>
Indeed, they elected one straight off&mdash;Sir Hervis de Revel.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Bzz!</hi> Here he came, like a house afire; I dodged; he passed like <lb/>
a flash, with my horse-hair coils settling around his neck; a second or <lb/>
so later, <hi rend="italic">fst!</hi> his saddle was empty.</p>
<pb n="503" entity="DSSR_000002494_0514"/>
<p>I got another encore; and another, and another, and still another. <lb/>
When I had snaked five men out, things began to look serious to the <lb/>
iron-clads, and they stopped and consulted together. As a result, they <lb/>
decided that it was time to waive etiquette and send their greatest and <lb/>
best against me. To the astonishment of that little world, I lassoed <lb/>
Sir Lamorak de Galis, and after him Sir Galahad. So you see there <lb/>
was simply nothing to be done, now, but play their right bower&mdash;bring <lb/>
out the superbest of the superb, the mightiest of the mighty, the great <lb/>
Sir Launcelot himself!</p>
<p>A proud moment for me? I should think so. Yonder was Arthur, <lb/>
King of Britain; yonder was Guenever; yes, and whole tribes of little <lb/>
provincial kings and kinglets; and in the tented camp yonder, <reg orig="re-|nowned">renowned</reg> <lb/>
knights from many lands; and likewise the selectest body <lb/>
known to chivalry, the Knights of the Table Round, the most <reg orig="illus-|trious">illustrious</reg> <lb/>
in Christendom; and biggest fact of all, the very sun of their <lb/>
shining system was yonder couching his lance, the focal point of forty <lb/>
thousand adoring eyes; and all by myself, here was I laying for him. <lb/>
Across my mind flitted the dear image of a certain hello-girl of West <lb/>
Hartford, and I wished she could see me now. In that moment, down <lb/>
came the Invincible, with the rush of a whirlwind&mdash;the courtly world <lb/>
rose to its feet and bent forward&mdash;the fateful coils went circling through <lb/>
the air, and before you could wink I was towing Sir Launcelot across <lb/>
the field on his back, and kissing my hand to the storm of waving <reg orig="ker-|chiefs">kerchiefs</reg> <lb/>
and the thunder-crash of applause that greeted me!</p>
<p>Said I to myself, as I coiled my lariat and hung it on my <reg orig="saddle-|horn">saddle-horn</reg>, <lb/>
and sat there drunk with glory, "The victory is perfect&mdash;no <lb/>
other will venture against me&mdash;knight-errantry is dead." Now imagine <lb/>
my astonishment&mdash;and everybody else's too&mdash;to hear the peculiar <lb/>
bugle-call which announces that another competitor is about to enter <lb/>
the lists! There was a mystery here; I couldn't account for this thing. <lb/>
Next, I noticed Merlin gliding away from me; and then I noticed that <lb/>
<pb n="504" entity="DSSR_000002494_0515"/>
my lasso was gone! The old sleight-of-hand expert had stolen it, <lb/>
sure, and slipped it under his robe.</p>
<p>The bugle blew again. I looked, and down came Sagramour riding <lb/>
again, with his dust brushed off and his veil nicely re-arranged. I <reg orig="trot-|ted">trotted</reg> <lb/>
up to meet him, and pretended to find him by the sound of his <lb/>
horse's hoofs. He said:</p>
<p>"Thou'rt quick of ear, but it will not save thee from this!" and he <lb/>
touched the hilt of his great sword. "An ye are not able to see it, <lb/>
because of the influence of the veil, know that it is no cumbrous lance, <lb/>
but a sword&mdash;and I <lb/>
ween ye will not be <lb/>
able to avoid it."</p>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f191" entity="DSSR_000002494_0515">
  <head>BRER MERLIN STEALS THE LARIAT.</head>
 </figure>
<p>His visor was up; <lb/>
there was death in his <lb/>
smile. I should never <lb/>
be able to dodge his <lb/>
sword, that was plain. <lb/>
Somebody was going <lb/>
to die, this time. If <lb/>
he got the drop on <lb/>
me, I could name the <lb/>
corpse. We rode <reg orig="for-|ward">forward</reg> <lb/>
together, and saluted the royalties. This time the king was <reg orig="dis-|turbed">disturbed</reg>. <lb/>
He said:</p>
<p>"Where is thy strange weapon?"</p>
<p>"It is stolen, sire."</p>
<p>"Hast another at hand?"</p>
<p>"No, sire, I brought only the one."</p>
<p>Then Merlin mixed in:</p>
<p>"He brought but the one because there was but the one to bring. <lb/>
There exists none other but that one. It belongeth to the king of the <lb/>
<pb n="505" entity="DSSR_000002494_0516"/>
Demons of the Sea. This man is a pretender, and ignorant; else he <lb/>
had known that that weapon can be used in but eight bouts only, and <lb/>
then it vanisheth away to its home under the sea."</p>
<p>"Then is he weaponless," said the king. "Sir Sagramour, ye will <lb/>
grant him leave to borrow."</p>
<p>"And I will lend!" said Sir Launcelot, limping up. "He is as <lb/>
brave a knight of his hands as any that be on live, and he shall have <lb/>
mine."</p>
<p>He put his hand on his sword to draw it, but Sir Sagramour said:</p>
<p>"Stay, it may not be. He shall fight with his own weapons; it was <lb/>
his privilege to choose them and bring them. If he has erred, on his <lb/>
head be it."</p>
<p>"Knight!" said the king. "Thou'rt overwrought with passion; it <lb/>
disorders thy mind. Wouldst kill a naked man?"</p>
<p>"An he do it, he shall answer it to me," said Sir Launcelot.</p>
<p>"I will answer it to any he that desireth!" retorted Sir Sagramour <lb/>
hotly.</p>
<p>Merlin broke in, rubbing his hands and smiling his lowdownest <lb/>
smile of malicious gratification:</p>
<p>"'Tis well said, right well said! And 'tis enough of parleying, let <lb/>
my lord the king deliver the battle signal."</p>
<p>The king had to yield. The bugle made proclamation, and we <lb/>
turned apart and rode to our stations. There we stood, a hundred <lb/>
yards apart, facing each other, rigid and motionless, like horsed <lb/>
statues. And so we remained, in a soundless hush, as much as a full <lb/>
minute, everybody gazing, nobody stirring. It seemed as if the king <lb/>
could not take heart to give the signal. But at last he lifted his hand, <lb/>
the clear note of the bugle followed, Sir Sagramour's long blade <reg orig="de-|scribed">described</reg> <lb/>
a flashing curve in the air, and it was superb to see him come. <lb/>
I sat still. On he came. I did not move. People got so excited that <lb/>
they shouted to me:</p>
<pb n="506" entity="DSSR_000002494_0517"/>
<p>"Fly, fly! Save thyself! This is murther!"</p>
<p>I never budged so much as an inch, till that thundering apparition <lb/>
had got within fifteen paces of me; then I snatched a dragoon revolver <lb/>
out of my holster, there was a flash and a roar, and the revolver was <lb/>
back in the holster before anybody could tell what had happened.</p>
<p>Here was a riderless horse plunging by, and yonder lay Sir <reg orig="Sagra-|mour">Sagramour</reg>, <lb/>
stone dead.</p>
<p>The people that ran to him were stricken dumb to find that the life <lb/>
was actually gone out of the man and no reason for it visible, no hurt <lb/>
upon his body, nothing like a wound. There was a hole through the <lb/>
breast of his chain-mail, but they attached no importance to a little <lb/>
thing like that; and as a bullet-wound there produces but little blood, <lb/>
none came in sight because of the clothing and swaddlings under the <lb/>
armor. The body was dragged over to let the king and the swells <lb/>
look down upon it. They were stupefied with astonishment, naturally. <lb/>
I was requested to come and explain the miracle. But I remained in <lb/>
my tracks, like a statue, and said:</p>
<p>"If it is a command, I will come, but my lord the king knows that <lb/>
I am where the laws of combat require me to remain while any desire <lb/>
to come against me."</p>
<p>I waited. Nobody challenged. Then I said:</p>
<p>"If there are any who doubt that this field is well and fairly won, <lb/>
I do not wait for them to challenge me, I challenge them."</p>
<p>"It is a gallant offer," said the king, "and well beseems you. <lb/>
Whom will you name, first?"</p>
<p>"I name none, I challenge all! Here I stand, and dare the <reg orig="chiv-|alry">chivalry</reg> <lb/>
of England to come against me&mdash;not by individuals, but in mass!"</p>
<p>"What!" shouted a score of knights.</p>
<p>"You have heard the challenge. Take it, or I proclaim you <reg orig="rec-|reant">recreant</reg> <lb/>
knights and vanquished, every one!"</p>
<p>It was a "bluff" you know. At such a time it is sound judgment <lb/>
<pb n="507" entity="DSSR_000002494_0518"/>
to put on a bold face and play your hand for a hundred times what it <lb/>
is worth; forty-nine times out of fifty nobody dares to "call," and you <lb/>
rake in the chips. But just this once&mdash;well, things looked squally! <lb/>
In just no time, five hundred knights were scrambling into their <reg orig="sad-|dles">saddles</reg>, <lb/>
and before you could wink a widely scattering drove were under <lb/>
way and clattering down upon me. I snatched both revolvers from <lb/>
the holsters and began to measure distances and calculate chances.</p>
<p>Bang! One saddle empty. Bang! another one. Bang&mdash;bang! <lb/>
and I bagged two. Well it was nip and tuck with <lb/>
us, and I knew it. If I spent the <lb/>
eleventh shot without <reg orig="con-|vincing">convincing</reg> <lb/>
these people, <lb/>
the twelfth man <lb/>
would <lb/>
kill me, <lb/>
sure.</p>

<p>And so I <lb/>
never did feel so <lb/>
happy as I did when my <lb/>
ninth downed its man and I <lb/>
detected the wavering in the <lb/>
crowd which is premonitory of panic. An instant lost now, could <lb/>

<head>CHAPTER XL.<lb/> THREE YEARS LATER.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> I broke the back of <reg orig="knight-|errantry">knight-errantry</reg> <lb/>
that time, I no longer felt <lb/>
obliged to work in secret. So, the very <lb/>
next day I exposed my hidden schools, <lb/>
my mines, and my vast system of <reg orig="clandes-|tine">clandestine</reg> <lb/>
factories and work-shops to an <lb/>
astonished world. That is to say, I <lb/>
exposed the nineteenth century to <lb/>
the inspection of the sixth.</p>
<p>Well it is always a good plan <lb/>
to follow up an advantage <lb/>
promptly. The knights <lb/>
were temporarily down, but <lb/>
if I would keep them <lb/>
so I must just <lb/>
simply par-alyze them&mdash; <lb/>
nothing short of that would <reg orig="an-|swer">answer</reg>. <lb/>
You see, I was "bluffing" that <lb/>
last time, in the field; it would be <reg orig="nat-|ural">natural</reg> <lb/>
for them to work around to that <lb/>
conclusion, if I gave them a chance.</p>
<p>So I must not give them time: <lb/>
and I didn't.</p>
<p>I renewed my challenge, <lb/>
engraved it on <lb/>
brass, posted it <lb/>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f194" entity="DSSR_000002494_0522"/>-->

up where any priest could read it to them, and also kept it standing, <lb/>
in the advertising columns of the paper.</p>
<p>I not only renewed it, but added to its proportions. I said, name <lb/>
the day, and I would take fifty assistants and stand up <hi rend="italic">against the <lb/>
massed chivalry of the whole earth and destroy it.</hi></p>
<p>I was not bluffing this time. I meant what I said; I could do what <lb/>
I promised. There wasn't any way to misunderstand the language of <lb/>
that challenge. Even the dullest of the chivalry perceived that this <lb/>
was a plain case of "put up, or shut up." They were wise and did the <lb/>
latter. In all the next three years they gave me no trouble worth <lb/>
mentioning.</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f195" entity="DSSR_000002494_0523">
  <head>THREE YEARS LATER.</head>
 </figure>
<p>Consider the three years sped. Now look around on England. A <lb/>
happy and prosperous country, and strangely altered. Schools <reg orig="every-|where">everywhere</reg>, <lb/>
and several colleges; a number of pretty good newspapers. <lb/>
Even authorship was taking a start; Sir Dinadan the Humorist was <lb/>
first in the field, with a volume of gray-headed jokes which I had been <lb/>
familiar with during thirteen centuries. If he had left out that old <reg orig="ran-|cid">rancid</reg> <lb/>
one about the lecturer I wouldn't have said anything; but I <reg orig="could-|n't">couldn't</reg> <lb/>
stand that one. I suppressed the book and hanged the author.</p>
<pb n="513" entity="DSSR_000002494_0524"/>
<p>Slavery was dead and gone; all men were equal before the law; <reg orig="tax-|ation">taxation</reg> <lb/>
had been equalized. The telegraph, the telephone, the <reg orig="phono-|graph">phonograph</reg>, <lb/>
the type-writer, the sewing machine, and all the thousand <reg orig="will-|ing">willing</reg> <lb/>
and handy servants of steam and electricity were working their <lb/>
way into favor. We had a steamboat or two on the Thames, we had <lb/>
steam war-ships, and the beginnings of a steam commercial marine; I <lb/>
was getting ready to send out an expedition to discover America.</p>
<p>We were building several lines of railway, and our line from Camelot <lb/>
to London was already finished and in operation. I was shrewd enough <lb/>
to make all offices connected with the passenger service places of <lb/>
high and distinguished honor. My idea was to attract the chivalry and <lb/>
nobility, and make them useful and keep them out of mischief. The <lb/>
plan worked very well, the competition for the places was hot. The <lb/>
conductor of the 4.33 express was a duke, there wasn't a passenger <lb/>
conductor on the line below the degree of earl. They were good men, <lb/>
every one, but they had two defects which I couldn't cure, and so had <lb/>
to wink at: they wouldn't lay aside their armor, and they would <lb/>
"knock down" fares&mdash;I mean rob the company.</p>
<p>There was hardly a knight in all the land who wasn't in some <reg orig="use-|ful">useful</reg> <lb/>
employment. They were going from end to end of the country in <lb/>
all manner of useful missionary capacities; their penchant for <reg orig="wander-|ing">wandering</reg>, <lb/>
and their experience in it, made them altogether the most <reg orig="effect-|ive">effective</reg> <lb/>
spreaders of civilization we had. They went clothed in steel and <lb/>
equipped with sword and lance and battle axe, and if they couldn't <lb/>
persuade a person to try a sewing machine on the instalment plan, or <lb/>
a melodeon, or a barbed wire fence, or a prohibition journal, or any of <lb/>
the other thousand and one things they canvassed for, they removed <lb/>
him and passed on.</p>
<p>I was very happy. Things were working steadily toward a secretly <lb/>
longed-for point. You see, I had two schemes in my head which were <lb/>
the vastest of all my projects. The one was, to overthrow the <reg orig="Cath-|olic">Catholic</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="514" entity="DSSR_000002494_0525"/>
Church and set up the Protestant faith on its ruins&mdash;not as an <lb/>
Established Church, but a go-as-you-please one; and the other <reg orig="pro-|ject">project</reg> <lb/>
was, to get a decree issued by and by, commanding that upon <lb/>
Arthur's death unlimited suffrage should be introduced, and given to <lb/>
men and women alike&mdash;at any rate to all men, wise or unwise, and <lb/>
to all mothers who at middle age should be found to know nearly as <lb/>
much as their sons at twenty-one. Arthur was good for thirty years <lb/>
yet, he being about my own age&mdash;that is to say, forty&mdash;and I believed <lb/>
that in that time I could easily have the active part of the population <lb/>
of that day ready and eager for an event which should be the first of <lb/>
its kind in the history of the world&mdash;a rounded and complete <reg orig="govern-|mental">governmental</reg> <lb/>
revolution without bloodshed. The result to be a republic. <lb/>
Well, I may as well confess, though I do feel ashamed when I think <lb/>
of it: I was beginning to have a base hankering to be its first <reg orig="presi-|dent">president</reg> <lb/>
myself. Yes, there was more or less human nature in me; I <lb/>
found that out.</p>
<p>Clarence was with me as concerned the revolution, but in a <reg orig="modi-|fied">modified</reg> <lb/>
way. His idea was a republic, without privileged orders but with <lb/>
a hereditary royal family at the head of it instead of an elective chief <lb/>
magistrate. He believed that no nation that had ever known the joy <lb/>
of worshiping a royal family could ever be robbed of it and not fade <lb/>
away and die of melancholy. I urged that kings were dangerous. He <lb/>
said, then have cats. He was sure that a royal family of cats would <lb/>
answer every purpose. They would be as useful as any other royal <lb/>
family, they would know as much, they would have the same virtues <lb/>
and the same treacheries, the same disposition to get up shindies with <lb/>
other royal cats, they would be laughably vain and absurd and never <lb/>
know it, they would be wholly inexpensive; finally, they would have <lb/>
as sound a divine right as any other royal house, and "Tom VII, or <lb/>
Tom XI, or Tom XIV by the grace of God King," would sound as well <lb/>
as it would when applied to the ordinary royal tomcat with tights on. <lb/>
<pb n="515" entity="DSSR_000002494_0526"/>
"And as a rule," said he, in his neat modern English, "the character <lb/>
of these cats would be considerably above the character of the average <lb/>
king, and this would be an immense moral advantage to the nation, <lb/>
for the reason that a nation always models its morals after its <reg orig="mon-|arch's">monarch's</reg>. <lb/>
The worship of royalty being founded in unreason, these <reg orig="grace-|ful">graceful</reg> <lb/>
and harmless cats would easily become as sacred as any other <reg orig="roy-|alties">royalties</reg>, <lb/>
and indeed more so, because it would presently be noticed that <lb/>
they hanged nobody, beheaded nobody, imprisoned nobody, inflicted <lb/>
no cruelties or injustices of any sort, and so must be worthy of a deeper <lb/>
love and reverence than the customary human king, and would <reg orig="cer-|tainly">certainly</reg> <lb/>
get it. The eyes of the whole harried world would soon be fixed <lb/>
upon this humane and gentle system, and royal butchers would <reg orig="pres-|ently">presently</reg> <lb/>
begin to disappear; their subjects would fill the vacancies with <lb/>
catlings from our own royal house; we should become a factory; we <lb/>
should supply the thrones of the world; within forty years all Europe <lb/>
would be governed by cats, and we should furnish the cats. The reign <lb/>
of universal peace would begin then, to end no more forever. . . . . . <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Me-e-e-yow-ow-ow-ow&mdash;fzt!&mdash;wow!</hi>"</p>
<p>Hang him, I supposed he was in earnest, and was beginning to be <lb/>
persuaded by him, until he exploded that cat-howl and startled me <lb/>
almost out of my clothes. But he never could be in earnest. He didn't <lb/>
know what it was. He had pictured a distinct and perfectly rational <lb/>
and feasible improvement upon constitutional monarchy, but he was <lb/>
too feather-headed to know it, or care anything about it, either. I was <lb/>
going to give him a scolding, but Sandy came flying in at that moment, <lb/>
wild with terror, and so choked with sobs that for a minute she could <lb/>
not get her voice. I ran and took her in my arms, and lavished caresses <lb/>
upon her and said, beseechingly:</p>
<p>"Speak, darling, speak! What is it?"</p>
<p>Her head fell limp upon my bosom, and she gasped, almost <reg orig="inau-|dibly">inaudibly</reg>:</p>
<pb n="516" entity="DSSR_000002494_0527"/>
<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">Hello, Central</hi>!"</p>
<p>"Quick!" I shouted to Clarence; "telephone the king's homeopath <lb/>
to come!"</p>
<p>In two minutes I was kneeling by the child's crib, and Sandy was <lb/>
dispatching servants here, there and everywhere, all over the palace. <lb/>
I took in the situation almost at a glance&mdash;membraneous croup! I bent <lb/>
down and whispered:</p>
<p>"Wake up, sweetheart! Hello-Central!"</p>
<p>She opened her soft eyes languidly, and made out to say&mdash;</p>
<p>"Papa."</p>
<p>That was a comfort. She was far from dead, yet. I sent for <reg orig="prep-|arations">preparations</reg> <lb/>
of sulphur, I rousted out the croup-kettle myself; for I don't <lb/>
sit down and wait for doctors when Sandy or the child is sick. I knew <lb/>
how to nurse both of them, and had had experience. This little chap <lb/>
had lived in my arms a good part of its small life, and often I could <lb/>
soothe away its troubles and get it to laugh through the tear-dews on <lb/>
its eye-lashes when even its mother couldn't.</p>
<p>Sir Launcelot, in his richest armor, came striding along the great <lb/>
hall, now, on his way to the stock-board; he was president of the <reg orig="stock-|board">stock-board</reg>, <lb/>
and occupied the Siege Perilous, which he had bought of Sir <lb/>
Galahad; for the stock-board consisted of the Knights of the Round <lb/>
Table, and they used the Round Table for business purposes, now. <lb/>
Seats at it were worth&mdash;well, you would never believe the figure, so it <lb/>
is no use to state it. Sir Launcelot was a bear, and he had put up a <lb/>
corner in one of the new lines, and was just getting ready to squeeze <lb/>
the shorts to-day; but what of that? He was the same old Launcelot, <lb/>
and when he glanced in as he was passing the door and found out that <lb/>
his pet was sick, that was enough for him; bulls and bears might fight <lb/>
it out their own way for all him, he would come right in here and stand <lb/>
by little Hello-Central for all he was worth. And that was what he <lb/>
did. He shied his helmet into the corner, and in half a minute he had <lb/>
<pb n="517" entity="DSSR_000002494_0528"/>
a new wick in the alcohol lamp and was firing up on the croup-kettle. <lb/>
By this time Sandy had built a blanket canopy over the crib, and <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
was ready.</p>
<p>Sir Launcelot got up steam, he and I loaded up the kettle with <reg orig="un-|slaked">unslaked</reg> <lb/>
lime and carbolic acid, with a touch of lactic acid added thereto, <lb/>
then filled the thing up with water and inserted the steam-spout under <lb/>
the canopy. Everything was ship-shape, now, and we sat down on <lb/>
either side of the crib to stand our watch. Sandy was so grateful and <lb/>
so comforted that she charged a couple of church-wardens with <reg orig="willow-|bark">willow-bark</reg> <lb/>
and sumach-tobacco for us, and told us to smoke as much as we <lb/>
pleased, it couldn't get under the canopy, and she was used to smoke, <lb/>
being the first lady in the land who had ever seen a cloud blown. <lb/>
Well, there couldn't be a more contented or comfortable sight than Sir <lb/>
Launcelot in his noble armor sitting in gracious serenity at the end of <lb/>

of course, Guenever&mdash;however, it's no use to cry over what's done and <lb/>
can't be helped.</p>
<p>Well, he stood watch-and-watch with me, right straight through, <lb/>
for three days and nights, till the child was out of danger; then he took <lb/>
her up in his great arms and kissed her, with his plumes falling about <lb/>
her golden head, then laid her softly in Sandy's lap again and took his <lb/>
stately way down the vast hall, between the ranks of admiring <reg orig="men-|at-arms">men-at-arms</reg> <lb/>
and menials, and so disappeared. And no instinct warned me <lb/>
that I should never look upon him again in this world! Lord, what a <lb/>
world of heart-break it is.</p>
<p>The doctors said we must take the child away, if we would coax her <lb/>
back to health and strength again. And she must have sea air. So we <lb/>
took a man-of-war, and a suite of two hundred and sixty persons, and <lb/>
went cruising about, and after a fortnight of this we stepped ashore on <lb/>
the French coast, and the doctors thought it would be a good idea to <lb/>
make something of a stay there. The little king of that region offered <lb/>
us his hospitalities, and we were glad to accept. If he had had as many <lb/>
conveniences as he lacked, we should have been plenty comfortable <lb/>
enough; even as it was, we made out very well, in his queer old castle, <lb/>
by the help of comforts and luxuries from the ship.</p>
<p>At the end of a month I sent the vessel home for fresh supplies, and <lb/>
for news. We expected her back in three or four days. She would bring <lb/>
me, along with other news, the result of a certain experiment which I <lb/>
had been starting. It was a project of mine to replace the tournament <lb/>
with something which might furnish an escape for the extra steam of <lb/>
the chivalry, keep those bucks entertained and out of mischief, and at <lb/>
the same time preserve the best thing in them, which was their hardy <lb/>
spirit of emulation. I had had a choice band of them in private <reg orig="train-|ing">training</reg> <lb/>
for some time, and the date was now arriving for their first public <lb/>
effort.</p>
<p>This experiment was base-ball. In order to give the thing vogue <lb/>
<pb n="519" entity="DSSR_000002494_0530"/>
from the start, and place it out of the reach of criticism, I chose my <lb/>
nines by rank, not capacity. There wasn't a knight in either team who <lb/>
wasn't a sceptred sovereign. As for material of this sort, there was a <lb/>
glut of it, always, around Arthur. You couldn't throw a brick in any <lb/>
direction and not cripple a king. Of course I couldn't get these people <lb/>
to leave off their armor; they wouldn't do that when they bathed. <lb/>
They consented to differentiate the armor so that a body could tell one <lb/>
team from the other, but that was the most they would <lb/>
do. So, one of the teams wore chain-mail ulsters, and <lb/>
the other wore plate-armor made of my new Bessemer <lb/>
steel. Their practice in the field was the most fantastic <lb/>
thing I ever saw. Being ball-proof, they never skipped out <lb/>
of the way, but stood still and took the result; <lb/>
when a Bessemer was at the bat and a ball <lb/>
hit him, it would bound a hundred and <lb/>
fifty yards, sometimes. And when a man <lb/>
was running, and threw himself on his stomach <lb/>
to slide to his base, it was like an iron-clad <reg orig="com-|ing">coming</reg> <lb/>
into port. At <lb/>
first I appointed <lb/>
men of no rank <lb/>
to act as umpires, but I had to <lb/>
discontinue that. These <reg orig="peo-|ple">people</reg> <lb/>
were no easier to please <lb/>
than other nines. The umpire's first decision was usually his last; <lb/>
they broke him in two with a bat, and his friends toted him home on <lb/>
a shutter. When it was noticed that no umpire ever survived a <lb/>
game, umpiring got to be unpopular. So I was obliged to appoint <lb/>
somebody whose rank and lofty position under the government would <lb/>
protect him.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XLI.<lb/> THE INTERDICT.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">However</hi>, my attention was suddenly <lb/>
snatched from such matters; our child <lb/>
began to lose ground again, and <lb/>
we had to go to sitting up <lb/>
with her, her case <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
so serious. We <lb/>
couldn't bear to allow <lb/>
anybody to help, in this <lb/>
service, so we two stood <lb/>
watch-and-watch, day in and <lb/>
day out. Ah, Sandy, what a <lb/>
right heart she had, how <reg orig="sim-|ple">simple</reg>, <lb/>
and genuine, and good she <lb/>
was! She was a flawless wife <lb/>
and mother; and yet I had married <lb/>
her for no particular reason, except <lb/>
that by the customs of <reg orig="chiv-|alry">chivalry</reg> <lb/>
she was my <lb/>
property until <lb/>
some knight should <lb/>
win her from me <lb/>
in the field. She <lb/>
had hunted Britain over <lb/>
for me; had found me at the hanging-bout outside of London, and had <lb/>
straightway resumed her old place at my side in the placidest way <lb/>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f199" entity="DSSR_000002494_0534"/>-->
<pb n="524" entity="DSSR_000002494_0535"/>
and as of right. I was a New Englander, and in my opinion this sort <lb/>
of partnership would compromise her, sooner or later. She couldn't <lb/>
see how, but I cut argument short and we had a wedding.</p>
<p>Now I didn't know I was drawing a prize, yet that was what I did <lb/>
draw. Within the twelvemonth I became her worshiper; and ours <lb/>
was the dearest and perfectest comradeship that ever was. People <lb/>
talk about beautiful friendships between two persons of the same sex. <lb/>
What is the best of that sort, as compared with the friendship of man <lb/>
and wife, where the best impulses and highest ideals of both are the <lb/>
same? There is no place for comparison between the two friendships; <lb/>
the one is earthly, the other divine.</p>
<p>In my dreams, along at first, I still wandered thirteen centuries <lb/>
away, and my unsatisfied spirit went calling and harking all up and <lb/>
down the unreplying vacancies of a vanished world. Many a time <lb/>
Sandy heard that imploring cry come from my lips in my sleep. With <lb/>
a grand magnanimity she saddled that cry of mine upon our child, <lb/>
conceiving it to be the name of some lost darling of mine. It touched <lb/>
me to tears, and it also nearly knocked me off my feet, too, when she <lb/>
smiled up in my face for an earned reward, and played her quaint and <lb/>
pretty surprise upon me:</p>
<p>"The name of one who was dear to thee is here preserved, here <lb/>
made holy, and the music of it will abide alway in our ears. Now <lb/>
thou'lt kiss me, as knowing the name I have given the child."</p>
<p>But I didn't know it, all the same. I hadn't an idea in the world; <lb/>
but it would have been cruel to confess it and spoil her pretty game; <lb/>
so I never let on, but said:</p>
<p>"Yes, I know, sweetheart&mdash;how dear and good it is of you, too! <lb/>
But I want to hear these lips of yours, which are also mine, utter it <lb/>
first&mdash;then its music will be perfect."</p>
<p>Pleased to the marrow, she murmured&mdash;</p>
<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">Hello-Central</hi>!"</p>
<pb entity="DSSR_000002494_0536"/>
 <figure rend="page" id="f200" entity="DSSR_000002494_0536">
  <head>"HELLO-CENTRAL!"</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="526" entity="DSSR_000002494_0537"/>
<p>I didn't laugh&mdash;I am always thankful for that&mdash;but the strain <reg orig="rup-|tured">ruptured</reg> <lb/>
every cartilage in me, and for weeks afterward I could hear my <lb/>
bones clack when I walked. She never found out her mistake. The <lb/>
first time she heard that form of salute used at the telephone she was <lb/>
surprised, and not pleased; but I told her I had given order for it: that <lb/>
henceforth and forever the telephone must always be invoked with that <lb/>
reverent formality, in perpetual honor and remembrance of my lost <lb/>
friend and her small namesake. This was not true. But it answered.</p>
<p>Well, during two weeks and a half we watched by the crib, and in <lb/>
our deep solicitude we were unconscious of any world outside of that <lb/>
sick-room. Then our reward came: the centre of the universe turned <lb/>
the corner and began to mend. Grateful? It isn't the term. There <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">isn't</hi> any term for it. You know that, yourself, if you've watched your <lb/>
child through the Valley of the Shadow and seen it come back to life <lb/>
and sweep night out of the earth with one all-illuminating smile that <lb/>
you could cover with your hand.</p>
<p>Why, we were back in this world in one instant! Then we looked <lb/>
the same startled thought into each other's eyes at the same moment: <lb/>
more than two weeks gone, and that ship not back yet!</p>
<p>In another minute I appeared in the presence of my train. They <lb/>
had been steeped in troubled bodings all this time&mdash;their faces showed <lb/>
it. I called an escort and we galloped five miles to a hill-top <reg orig="over-|looking">overlooking</reg> <lb/>
the sea. Where was my great commerce that so lately had <lb/>
made these glistering expanses populous and beautiful with its <reg orig="white-|winged">white-winged</reg> <lb/>
flocks? Vanished, every one! Not a sail, from verge to verge, <lb/>
not a smoke-bank&mdash;just a dead and empty solitude, in place of all that <lb/>
brisk and breezy life.</p>
<p>I went swiftly back, saying not a word to anybody. I told Sandy <lb/>
this ghastly news. We could imagine no explanation that would <reg orig="be-|gin">begin</reg> <lb/>
to explain. Had there been an invasion? an earthquake? a <reg orig="pesti-|lence">pestilence</reg>? <lb/>
Had the nation been swept out of existence? But guessing <lb/>
<pb n="527" entity="DSSR_000002494_0538"/>
was profitless. I must go&mdash;at once. I borrowed the king's navy&mdash;a <lb/>
"ship" no bigger than a steam launch&mdash;and was soon ready.</p>
<p>The parting&mdash;ah, yes, that was hard. As I was devouring the child <lb/>
with last kisses, it brisked up and jabbered out its vocabulary!&mdash;the <lb/>
first time in more than two weeks, and it made fools of us for joy. The <lb/>
darling mispronunciations of childhood!&mdash;dear me, there's no music <lb/>
that can touch it; and how <lb/>
one grieves when it wastes <lb/>
away and dissolves into <reg orig="cor-|rectness">correctness</reg>, <lb/>
knowing it will <lb/>
never visit his bereaved ear <lb/>
again. Well, how good it <lb/>
was to be able to carry that <lb/>
gracious memory away <lb/>
with me!</p>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f201" entity="DSSR_000002494_0538">
  <head>"WHERE WAS MY GREAT COMMERCE?"</head>
 </figure>
<p>I approached England <lb/>
the next morning, with the <lb/>
wide highway of salt water <lb/>
all to myself. There were <lb/>
ships in the harbor, at Dover, <lb/>
but they were naked <lb/>
as to sails, and there <lb/>
was no sign of life <lb/>
about them. It was <lb/>
Sunday; yet at Canterbury the streets were empty; strangest of all, <lb/>
there was not even a priest in sight, and no stroke of a bell fell upon <lb/>
my ear. The mournfulness of death was everywhere. I couldn't <lb/>
understand it. At last, in the further edge of that town I saw a <lb/>
small funeral procession&mdash;just a family and a few friends following a <lb/>
coffin&mdash;no priest; a funeral without bell, book or candle; there was <lb/>
a church there, close at hand, but they passed it by, weeping, and <lb/>
<pb n="528" entity="DSSR_000002494_0539"/>
did not enter it; I glanced up at the belfry, and there hung the bell, <lb/>
shrouded in black, and its tongue tied back. Now I knew! Now I <lb/>
understood the stupendous calamity that had overtaken England. <reg orig="In-|vasion">Invasion</reg>? <lb/>
Invasion is a triviality to it. It was the <hi rend="small-caps">Interdict</hi>!</p>
<p>I asked no questions; I didn't need to ask any. The Church had <lb/>
struck; the thing for me to do was to get into a disguise, and go warily. <lb/>
One of my servants gave me a suit of his clothes, and when we were <lb/>
safe beyond the town I put them on, and from that time I traveled <lb/>
alone; I could not risk the embarrassment of company.</p>
<p>A miserable journey. A desolate silence everywhere. Even in <lb/>
London itself. Traffic had ceased; men did not talk or laugh, or go <lb/>
in groups, or even in couples; they moved aimlessly about, each man <lb/>
by himself, with his head down, and woe and terror at his heart. The <lb/>
Tower showed recent war-scars. Verily, much had been happening.</p>
<p>Of course I meant to take the train for Camelot. Train! Why, the <lb/>
station was as vacant as a cavern. I moved on. The journey to <reg orig="Came-|lot">Camelot</reg> <lb/>
was a repetition of what I had already seen. The Monday and the <lb/>
Tuesday differed in no way from the Sunday. I arrived, far in the <lb/>
night. From being the best electric-lighted town in the kingdom and <lb/>
the most like a recumbent sun of anything you ever saw, it was become <lb/>
simply a blot&mdash;a blot upon darkness&mdash;that is to say, it was darker and <lb/>
solider than the rest of the darkness, and so you could see it a little <lb/>
better; it made me feel as if maybe it was symbolical&mdash;a sort of sign <lb/>
that the Church was going to <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> the upper hand, now, and snuff out <lb/>
all my beautiful civilization just like that. I found no life stirring in <lb/>
the sombre streets. I groped my way with a heavy heart. The vast <lb/>
castle loomed black upon the hill-top, not a spark visible about it. <lb/>
The drawbridge was down, the great gate stood wide, I entered <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
challenge, my own heels making the only sound I heard&mdash;and it <lb/>
was sepulchral enough, in those huge vacant courts.</p>

he was about to call when I left."</p>
<p>"Very well, he did call. The boys couldn't deliver. Oh, he had <lb/>
them&mdash;and he just settled his grip and squeezed them. They were <lb/>
laughing in their sleeves over their smartness in selling stock to him <lb/>
at 15 and 16 and along there, that wasn't worth 10. Well, when they <lb/>
had laughed long enough on that side of their mouths, they rested-up <lb/>
that side by shifting the laugh to the other side. That was when they <lb/>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that was the <lb/>

Launcelot and his <lb/>

<p>"Rush! Go on."</p>
<p>"Sir Gaheris, and Sir Gareth&mdash;both!"</p>
<p>"Oh, incredible! Their love for Launcelot was indestructible."</p>
<p>"Well, it was an accident. They were simply on-lookers; they <lb/>
were unarmed, and were merely there to witness the queen's <reg orig="punish-|ment">punishment</reg>. <lb/>
Sir Launcelot smote down whoever came in the way of his <lb/>
blind fury, and he killed these without noticing who they were. Here <lb/>
is an instantaneous photograph one of our boys got of the battle; it's <lb/>
for sale on every news stand. There&mdash;the figures nearest the queen <lb/>
are Sir Launcelot with his sword up, and Sir Gareth gasping his latest <lb/>
breath. You can catch the agony in the queen's face through the <lb/>
curling smoke. It's a rattling battle-picture."</p>
<p>"Indeed it is. We must take good care of it; its historical value <lb/>
is incalculable. Go on."</p>
<p>"Well, the rest of the tale is just war, pure and simple. Launcelot <lb/>
retreated to his town and castle of Joyous Gard, and gathered there a <lb/>
great following of knights. The king, with a great host, went there, <lb/>
and there was desperate fighting during several days, and as a result, <lb/>
all the plain around was paved with corpses and cast iron. Then the <lb/>
Church patched up a peace between Arthur and Launcelot and the <lb/>
queen and everybody&mdash;everybody but Sir Gawaine. He was bitter <lb/>
about the slaying of his brothers, Gareth and Gaheris, and would not <lb/>
be appeased. He notified Launcelot to get him thence, and make <lb/>
swift preparation, and look to be soon attacked. So Launcelot sailed <lb/>
to his Duchy of Guienne, with his following, and Gawaine soon <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg>, <lb/>
with an army, and he beguiled Arthur to go with him. Arthur <lb/>
left the kingdom in Sir Mordred's hands until you should return&mdash;"</p>
<pb n="535" entity="DSSR_000002494_0546"/>
<p>"Ah&mdash;a king's customary wisdom!"</p>
<p>"Yes. Sir Mordred set himself at once to work to make his <reg orig="king-|ship">kingship</reg> <lb/>
permanent. He was going to marry Guenever, as a first move; <lb/>
but she fled and shut herself up in the Tower of London. Mordred <lb/>
attacked; the Bishop of Canterbury dropped down on him with the <lb/>
Interdict. The king returned; Mordred fought him at Dover, at <reg orig="Can-|terbury">Canterbury</reg>, <lb/>
and again at Barham Down. Then there was talk of peace <lb/>

  <head>"THE REST OF THE TALE IS JUST WAR, PURE AND SIMPLE."</head>
 </figure>
<p>"Well, upon my word! My dream of a republic to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a dream, and <lb/>
so remain."</p>
<p>"Yes. The two armies lay near Salisbury. Gawaine&mdash;Gawaine's <lb/>
head is at Dover Castle, he fell in the fight there&mdash;Gawaine appeared <lb/>
to Arthur in a dream, at least his ghost did, and warned him to refrain <lb/>
from conflict for a month, let the delay cost what it might. But <reg orig="bat-|tle">battle</reg> <lb/>
was precipitated by an accident. Arthur had given order that if a <lb/>
<pb n="536" entity="DSSR_000002494_0547"/>
sword was raised during the consultation over the proposed treaty <lb/>
with Mordred, sound the trumpet and fall on! for he had no confidence <lb/>
in Mordred. Mordred had given a similar order to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> people. Well, <lb/>
by and by an adder bit a knight's heel; the knight forgot all about the <lb/>
order, and made a slash at the adder with his sword. Inside of half a <lb/>
minute those two prodigious hosts came together with a crash! They <lb/>
butchered away all day. Then the king&mdash;however, we have started <lb/>
something fresh since you left&mdash;our paper has."</p>
<p>"No? What is that?"</p>
<p>"War correspondence!"</p>
<p>"Why, that's good."</p>
<p>"Yes, the paper was booming right along, for the Interdict made <lb/>
no impression, got no grip, while the war lasted. I had war <reg orig="corre-|spondents">correspondents</reg> <lb/>
with both armies. I will finish that battle by reading you <lb/>
what one of the boys says: <lb/>
<q>Then the king looked about him, and then was he ware of all his host and of all his <lb/>
good knights were left no more on live but two knights, that was Sir Lucan de Butlere, <lb/>
and his brother Sir Bedivere: and they were full sore wounded. Jesu mercy, said the <lb/>
king, where are all my noble knights becomen? Alas that ever I should see this doleful <lb/>
day. For now, said Arthur, I am come to mine end. But would to God that I wist <lb/>
where were that traitor Sir Mordred, that hath caused all this mischief. Then was King <lb/>
Arthur ware where Sir Mordred leaned upon his sword among a great heap of dead men. <lb/>
Now give me my spear, said Arthur unto Sir Lucan, for yonder I have espied the traitor <lb/>
that all this woe hath wrought. Sir, let him be, said Sir Lucan, for he is unhappy; and <lb/>
if ye pass this unhappy day, ye shall be right well revenged upon him. Good lord, <reg orig="re-|member">remember</reg> <lb/>
ye of your night's dream, and what the spirit of Sir Gawaine told you this night, <lb/>
yet God of his great goodness hath preserved you hitherto. Therefore, for God's sake, <lb/>
my lord, leave off by this. For blessed be God ye have won the field: for here we be <lb/>
three on live, and with Sir Mordred is none on live. And if ye leave off now, this wicked <lb/>
day of destiny is past. Tide me death, betide me life, saith the king, now I see him <reg orig="yon-|der">yonder</reg> <lb/>
alone, he shall never escape mine hands, for at a better avail shall I never have him. <lb/>
God speed you well, said Sir Bedivere. Then the king gat his spear in both his hands, <lb/>
and ran toward Sir Mordred, crying, Traitor, now is thy death day come. And when Sir <lb/>
Mordred heard Sir Arthur, he ran until him with his sword drawn in his hand. And <lb/>
then King Arthur smote Sir Mordred under the shield, with a foin of his spear <reg orig="through-|out">throughout</reg> <lb/>
the body more than a fathom. And when Sir Mordred felt that he had his death's <lb/>
wound, he thrust himself, with the might that he had, up to the but of King Arthur's <lb/>
<pb n="537" entity="DSSR_000002494_0548"/>
spear. And right so he smote his father Arthur with his sword holden in both his hands, <lb/>
on the side of the head, that the sword pierced the helmet and the brain-pan, and <reg orig="there-|withal">therewithal</reg> <lb/>
Sir Mordred fell stark dead to the earth. And the noble Arthur fell in a swoon to <lb/>
the earth, and there he swooned oft-times."</q></p>
<p>"That is a good piece of war correspondence, Clarence; you are <lb/>
a first-rate newspaper man. Well&mdash;is the king all right? Did he get <lb/>
well?"</p>
<p>"Poor soul, no. He is dead."</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f206" entity="DSSR_000002494_0548">
  <head>"TRAITOR, NOW IS THY DEATH DAY COME."</head>
 </figure>
<p>I was utterly stunned; it had not seemed to me that any wound <lb/>
could be mortal to him.</p>
<p>"And the queen, Clarence?"</p>
<p>"She is a nun, in Almesbury."</p>
<p>"What changes! and in such a short while. It is inconceivable. <lb/>
What next, I wonder?"</p>
<p>"I can tell you what next."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<pb n="538" entity="DSSR_000002494_0549"/>
<p>"Stake our lives and stand by them!"</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p>"The Church is master, now. The Interdict included you with <lb/>
Mordred; it is not to be removed while you remain alive. The clans <lb/>
are gathering. The Church has gathered all the knights that are left <lb/>
alive, and as soon as you are discovered we shall have business on our <lb/>
hands."</p>
<p>"Stuff! With our deadly scientific war-material; with our hosts <lb/>
of trained&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Save your breath&mdash;we haven't sixty faithful left!"</p>
<p>"What are you saying? Our schools, our colleges, our vast <reg orig="work-|shops">workshops</reg>, <lb/>
our&mdash;"</p>
<p>"When those knights come, those establishments will empty <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
and go over to the enemy. Did you think you had educated <lb/>
the superstition out of those people?"</p>
<p>"I certainly did think it."</p>
<p>"Well, then, you may unthink it. They stood every strain easily <lb/>
&mdash;until the Interdict. Since then, they merely put on a bold outside <lb/>
&mdash;at heart they are quaking. Make up your mind to it&mdash;when the <lb/>
armies come, the mask will fall."</p>
<p>"It's hard news. We are lost. They will turn our own science <lb/>
against us."</p>
<p>"No they won't."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because I and a handful of the faithful have blocked that game. <lb/>
I'll tell you what I've done, and what moved me to it. Smart as you <lb/>
are, the Church was smarter. It was the Church that sent you <reg orig="cruis-|ing&mdash;through">cruising&mdash;through</reg> <lb/>
her servants the doctors."</p>
<p>"Clarence!"</p>
<p>"It is the truth. I know it. Every officer of your ship was the <lb/>
Church's picked servant, and so was every man of the crew."</p>
<pb n="539" entity="DSSR_000002494_0550"/>
<p>"Oh, come!"</p>
<p>"It is just as I tell you. I did not find out these things at once, <lb/>
but I found them out finally. Did you send me verbal information, by <lb/>
the commander of the ship, to the effect that upon his return to you, <lb/>
with supplies, you were going to leave Cadiz&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Cadiz! I haven't been at Cadiz at all!"</p>
<p>&mdash;"going to leave Cadiz and cruise in distant seas indefinitely, for <lb/>
the health of your family? Did you send me that word?"</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f207" entity="DSSR_000002494_0550">
  <head>"THE CHURCH IS MASTER, NOW."</head>
 </figure>
<p>"Of course not. I would have written, wouldn't I?"</p>
<p>"Naturally. I was troubled and suspicious. When the <reg orig="command-|er">commander</reg> <lb/>
sailed again I managed to ship a spy with him. I have never heard <lb/>
of vessel or spy since. I gave myself two weeks to hear from you in. <lb/>
Then I resolved to send a ship to Cadiz. There was a reason why I <lb/>
didn't."</p>
<p>"What was that?"</p>
<p>"Our navy had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared! Also as <lb/>
suddenly and as mysteriously, the railway and telegraph and <reg orig="tele-|phone">telephone</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="540" entity="DSSR_000002494_0551"/>
service ceased, the men all deserted, poles were cut down, the <lb/>
Church laid a ban upon the electric light! I had to be up and doing <lb/>
&mdash;and straight off. Your life was safe&mdash;nobody in these kingdoms but <lb/>
Merlin would venture to touch such a magician as you without ten <lb/>
thousand men at his back&mdash;I had nothing to think of but how to put <lb/>
preparations in the best trim against your coming. I felt safe myself <lb/>
&mdash;nobody would be anxious to touch a pet of yours. So this is what I <lb/>
did. From our various works I selected all the men&mdash;boys I mean&mdash; <lb/>
whose faithfulness under whatsoever pressure I could swear to, and I <lb/>
called them together secretly and gave them their instructions. There <lb/>
are fifty-two of them; none younger than fourteen, and none above <lb/>
seventeen years old."</p>
<p>"Why did you select boys?"</p>
<p>"Because all the others were born in an atmosphere of superstition <lb/>
and reared in it. It is in their blood and bones. We imagined we had <lb/>
educated it out of them; they thought so, too; the Interdict woke them <lb/>
up like a thunderclap! It revealed them to themselves, and it <reg orig="reveal-|ed">revealed</reg> <lb/>
them to me, too. With boys it was different. Such as have been <lb/>
under our training from seven to ten years have had no acquaintance <lb/>
with the Church's terrors, and it was among these that I found my <lb/>
fifty-two. As a next move, I paid a private visit to that old cave of <lb/>
Merlin's&mdash;not the small one&mdash;the big one&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, the one where we secretly established our first great electric <lb/>
plant when I was projecting a miracle."</p>
<p>"Just so. And as that miracle hadn't become necessary then, I <lb/>
thought it might be a good idea to utilize the plant now. I've <reg orig="pro-|visioned">provisioned</reg> <lb/>
the cave for a siege&mdash;"</p>
<p>"A good idea, a first rate idea."</p>
<p>"I think so. I placed four of my boys there, as a guard&mdash;inside, <lb/>
and out of sight. Nobody was to be hurt&mdash;while outside; but any <reg orig="at-|tempt">attempt</reg> <lb/>
to enter&mdash;well, we said just let anybody try it! Then I went <lb/>
<pb n="541" entity="DSSR_000002494_0552"/>
out into the hills and uncovered and cut the secret wires which <reg orig="con-|nected">connected</reg> <lb/>
your bedroom with the wires that go to the dynamite deposits <lb/>
under all our vast factories, mills, workshops, magazines, etc., and <lb/>
about midnight I and my boys turned out and connected that wire with <lb/>
the cave, and nobody but you and I suspects where the other end of it <lb/>
goes to. We laid it under ground, of course, and it was all finished in <lb/>
a couple of hours or so. We shan't have to leave our fortress, now, <lb/>
when we want to blow up our civilization."</p>
<p>"It was the right move&mdash;and the natural one; a military necessity, <lb/>
in the changed condition of things. Well, what changes <hi rend="italic">have</hi> come! <lb/>
We expected to be besieged in the palace some time or other, but&mdash; <lb/>
however, go on."</p>
<p>"Next, we built a wire fence."</p>
<p>"Wire fence?"</p>
<p>"Yes. You dropped the hint of it yourself, two or three years ago."</p>
<p>"Oh, I remember&mdash;the time the Church tried her strength against <lb/>
us the first time, and presently thought it wise to wait for a hopefuler <lb/>
season. Well, how have you arranged the fence?"</p>
<p>"I start twelve immensely strong wires&mdash;naked, not insulated&mdash; <lb/>
from a big dynamo in the cave&mdash;dynamo with no brushes except a <lb/>
positive and a negative one&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right."</p>
<p>"The wires go out from the cave and fence-in a circle of level <lb/>
ground a hundred yards in diameter; they make twelve independent <lb/>
fences, ten feet apart&mdash;that is to say, twelve circles within circles&mdash;and <lb/>
their ends come into the cave again."</p>
<p>"Right; go on."</p>
<p>"The fences are fastened to heavy oaken posts only three feet apart, <lb/>
and these posts are sunk five feet in the ground."</p>
<p>"That is good and strong."</p>
<p>"Yes. The wires have no ground-connection outside of the cave. <lb/>
<pb n="542" entity="DSSR_000002494_0553"/>
They go out from the positive brush of the dynamo; there is a <reg orig="ground-|connection">ground-connection</reg> <lb/>
through the negative brush; the other ends of the wire <reg orig="re-|turn">return</reg> <lb/>
to the cave, and each is grounded independently."</p>
<p>"No-no, that won't do!"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"It's too expensive&mdash;uses up force for nothing. You don't want <lb/>
any ground-connection except the one through the negative brush. <lb/>
The other end of every wire must be brought back into the cave and <lb/>
fastened independently, and <hi rend="italic">without</hi> any ground-connection. Now, <lb/>
then, observe the economy of it. A cavalry charge hurls itself against <lb/>
the fence; you are using no power, you are spending no money, for <lb/>
there is only one ground-connection till those horses come against the <lb/>
wire; the moment they touch it they form a connection with the <reg orig="nega-|tive">negative</reg> <lb/>
brush <hi rend="italic">through the ground,</hi> and drop dead. Don't you see?&mdash;you <lb/>
are using no energy until it is needed; your lightning is there, and <lb/>
ready, like the load in a gun; but it isn't costing you a cent till you <lb/>
touch it off. Oh, yes, the single ground-connection&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Of course! I don't know how I overlooked that. It's not only <lb/>
cheaper, but it's more effectual than the other way, for if wires break <lb/>
or get tangled, no harm is done."</p>
<p>"No, especially if we have a tell-tale in the cave and disconnect <lb/>
the broken wire. Well, go on. The gatlings?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;that's arranged. In the centre of the inner circle, on a <lb/>
spacious platform six feet high, I've grouped a battery of thirteen <reg orig="gat-|ling">gatling</reg> <lb/>
guns, and provided plenty of ammunition."</p>
<p>"That's it. They command every approach, and when the Church's <lb/>
knights arrive, there's going to be music. The brow of the precipice <lb/>
over the cave&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I've got a wire fence there, and a gatling. They won't drop any <lb/>
rocks down on us."</p>
<p>"Well, and the glass-cylinder dynamite torpedoes?"</p>
<pb n="543" entity="DSSR_000002494_0554"/>
<p>"That's attended to. It's the prettiest garden that was ever <reg orig="plant-|ed">planted</reg>. <lb/>
It's a belt forty feet wide, and goes around the outer <reg orig="fence&mdash;dis-|tance">fence&mdash;distance</reg> <lb/>
between it and the fence one hundred yards&mdash;kind of neutral <lb/>
ground, that space is. There isn't a single square yard of that whole <lb/>
belt but is equipped with a torpedo. We laid them on the surface of <lb/>
the ground, and sprinkled a layer of sand over them. It's an innocent <lb/>
looking garden, but you let a man start in to hoe it once, and you'll <lb/>
see."</p>
<p>"You tested the torpedoes?"</p>
<p>"Well, I was going to, but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But what? Why, it's an immense oversight not to apply a&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Test? Yes, I know; but they're all right; I laid a few in the <reg orig="pub-|lic">public</reg> <lb/>
road beyond our lines and they've been tested."</p>
<p>"Oh, that alters the case. Who did it?"</p>
<p>"A Church committee."</p>
<p>"How kind!"</p>
<p>"Yes. They came to command us to make submission. You see <lb/>
they didn't really come to test the torpedoes; that was merely an <lb/>
incident."</p>
<p>"Did the committee make a report?"</p>
<p>"Yes, they made one. You could have heard it a mile."</p>
<p>"Unanimous?"</p>
<p>"That was the nature of it. After that I put up some signs, for <lb/>
the protection of future committees, and we have had no intruders <lb/>
since."</p>
<p>"Clarence, you've done a world of work, and done it perfectly."</p>
<p>"We had plenty of time for it; there wasn't any occasion for hurry."</p>
<p>We sat silent awhile, thinking. Then my mind was made up, and <lb/>
I said:</p>
<p>"Yes, everything is ready; everything is shipshape, no detail is <lb/>
wanting. I know what to do, now."</p>
<pb n="544" entity="DSSR_000002494_0555"/>
<p>"So do I: sit down and wait."</p>
<p>"No, <hi rend="italic">sir!</hi> rise up and <hi rend="italic">strike!</hi>"</p>
<p>"Do you mean it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed! The <hi rend="italic">de</hi>fensive isn't in my line, and the <hi rend="italic">of</hi>fensive is. <lb/>
That is, when I hold a fair hand&mdash;two-thirds as good a hand as the <lb/>
enemy. Oh, yes, we'll rise up and strike; that's our game."</p>
<p>"A hundred to one, you are right. When does the performance <lb/>
begin?"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Now!</hi> We'll proclaim the Republic."</p>
<p>"Well, that <hi rend="italic">will</hi> precipitate things, sure enough!"</p>
<p>"It will make them buzz, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> tell you! England will be a hornet's <lb/>
nest before noon to-morrow, if the Church's hand hasn't lost its <reg orig="cun-|ning&mdash;and">cunning&mdash;and</reg> <lb/>
we know it hasn't. Now you write and I'll dictate&mdash;thus: <lb/>
<q rend="center">"PROCLAMATION.</q>
<ornament type="line"/>
<q>"BE IT KNOWN UNTO ALL. Whereas the king having died and left no heir, it <lb/>
becomes my duty to continue the executive authority vested in me, until a government <lb/>
shall have been created and set in motion. The monarchy has lapsed, it no longer exists. <lb/>
By consequence, all political power has reverted to its original source, the people of the <lb/>
nation. With the monarchy, its several adjuncts died also; wherefore there is no longer <lb/>
a nobility, no longer a privileged class, no longer an Established Church: all men are <lb/>

is hereby proclaimed,</hi> as being the natural estate of a nation when other authority has ceased. <lb/>
It is the duty of the British people to meet together immediately, and by their votes elect <lb/>

<p>I signed it "The Boss," and dated it from Merlin's Cave. Clarence <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Why, that tells where we are, and invites them to call right away."</p>
<p>"That is the idea. We <hi rend="italic">strike</hi>&mdash;by the Proclamation&mdash;then it's their <lb/>

<head>CHAPTER XLIII.<lb/>THE BATTLE OF THE SAND-BELT.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> Merlin's Cave&mdash;Clarence and I and fifty-two <lb/>
fresh, bright, well educated, clean-minded <lb/>
young British boys. At dawn I sent an <lb/>
order to the factories and to all our <lb/>
great works to stop operations and <lb/>
remove all life to a safe distance, as <lb/>
everything was going to be blown up <lb/>
by secret mines, "<hi rend="italic">and no telling at <lb/>
what moment&mdash;therefore, vacate at <lb/>
once.</hi>" These people knew me, and <lb/>
had confidence in my word. They <lb/>
would clear out without waiting to <lb/>
part their hair, and I could take my <lb/>
own time about dating the <reg orig="explo-|sion">explosion</reg>. <lb/>
You couldn't hire one of them <lb/>
to go back during the century, if the <lb/>
explosion was still impending.</p>
<p>We had a week of waiting. It was not dull for <lb/>
me, because I was writing all the time. During the <lb/>
first three days, I finished turning my old diary into this <lb/>
narrative form; it only required a chapter or so to bring it down <lb/>
to date. The rest of the week I took up in writing letters to my <lb/>
wife. It was always my habit to write to Sandy every day, <reg orig="when-|ever">whenever</reg> <lb/>
we were separate, and now I kept up the habit for love of it, <lb/>
<!-- <figure rend="inline" id="f209" entity="DSSR_000002494_0560"/>-->
<pb n="550" entity="DSSR_000002494_0561"/>
and of her, though I <reg orig="could-|n't">couldn't</reg> <lb/>
do anything with the <lb/>
letters, of course, after I <lb/>
had written them. But <lb/>
it put in the time, you <lb/>
see, and was almost like <lb/>
talking; it was almost as <lb/>
if I was saying, "Sandy, if you and <reg orig="Hello-|Central">HelloCentral</reg> <lb/>
were here in the cave, instead of only your <lb/>
photographs, what good times we could have!" <lb/>
And then, you know, I could imagine the <lb/>
baby goo-gooing something out in <reg orig="re-|ply">reply</reg>, <lb/>
with its fists in its mouth and itself <lb/>
stretched across its mother's lap on its back, <lb/>
and she a-laughing and admiring and <reg orig="wor-|shiping">worshiping</reg>, <lb/>
and now and then tickling <lb/>
under the baby's chin to set it cackling, <lb/>
and then maybe throwing in a <lb/>
word of answer to me <lb/>
herself&mdash;and so on and so <lb/>
on&mdash;well, don't you <lb/>
know, I could sit <lb/>
there in the cave <lb/>
with my <lb/>
pen, and <lb/>
keep it up, <lb/>
that way, by the hour with them. Why, it was almost like having us <lb/>
all together again.</p>

  <head>"I COULD IMAGINE THE BABY GOO-GOOING."</head>
 </figure>
<p>I had spies out, every night, of course, to get news. Every report <lb/>
made things look more and more impressive. The hosts were <reg orig="gather-|ing">gathering</reg>, <lb/>
gathering; down all the roads and paths of England the knights <lb/>
<pb n="551" entity="DSSR_000002494_0562"/>
were riding, and priests rode with them, to hearten these original <reg orig="Cru-|saders">Crusaders</reg>, <lb/>
this being the Church's war. All the nobilities, big and little, <lb/>
were on their way, and all the gentry. This was all as was expected. <lb/>
We should thin out this sort of folk to such a degree that the people <lb/>
would have nothing to do but just step to the front with their republic <lb/>
and&mdash;</p>
<p>Ah, what a donkey I was! Toward the end of the week I began to <lb/>
get this large and disenchanting fact through my head: that the mass <lb/>
of the nation had swung their caps and shouted for the republic for <lb/>
about one day, and there an end! The Church, the nobles, and the <lb/>
gentry then turned one grand, all-disapproving frown upon them and <lb/>
shriveled them into sheep! From that moment the sheep had begun <lb/>
to gather to the fold&mdash;that is to say, the camps&mdash;and offer their <reg orig="value-|less">valueless</reg> <lb/>
lives and their valuable wool to the "righteous cause." Why, <lb/>
even the very men who had lately been slaves were in the "righteous <lb/>
cause," and glorifying it, praying for it, sentimentally slabbering over <lb/>
it, just like all the other commoners. Imagine such human muck as <lb/>
this; conceive of this folly!</p>
<p>Yes, it was now "Death to the Republic!" everywhere&mdash;not a <reg orig="dis-|senting">dissenting</reg> <lb/>
voice. All England was marching against us! Truly this was <lb/>
more than I had bargained for.</p>
<p>I watched my fifty-two boys narrowly; watched their faces, their <lb/>
walk, their unconscious attitudes: for all these are a language&mdash;a <reg orig="lan-|guage">language</reg> <lb/>
given us purposely that it may betray us in times of emergency, <lb/>
when we have secrets which we want to keep. I knew that that <lb/>
thought would keep saying itself over and over again in their minds <lb/>
and hearts, <hi rend="italic">All England is marching against us!</hi> and evermore <reg orig="stren-|uously">strenuously</reg> <lb/>
imploring attention with each repetition, ever more sharply <lb/>
realizing itself to their imaginations, until even in their sleep they <lb/>
would find no rest from it, but hear the vague and flitting creatures of <lb/>
their dreams say, <hi rend="italic">All England</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="small-caps">All England</hi>!&mdash;<hi rend="italic">is marching against</hi> <lb/>
<pb n="552" entity="DSSR_000002494_0563"/>
<hi rend="italic">you!</hi> I knew all this would happen; I knew that ultimately the <reg orig="press-|ure">pressure</reg> <lb/>
would become so great that it would compel utterance; therefore, <lb/>
I must be ready with an answer at that time&mdash;an answer well chosen <lb/>
and tranquilizing.</p>
<p>I was right. The time came. They <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to speak. Poor lads, it <lb/>
was pitiful to see, they were so pale, so worn, so troubled. At first <lb/>
their spokesman could hardly find voice or words; but he presently <lb/>
got both. This is what he said&mdash;and he put it in the neat modern <lb/>
English taught him in my schools:</p>
<p>"We have tried to forget what we are&mdash;English boys! We have <lb/>
tried to put reason before sentiment, duty before love; our minds <reg orig="ap-|prove">approve</reg>, <lb/>
but our hearts reproach us. While apparently it was only the <lb/>
nobility, only the gentry, only the twenty-five or thirty thousand <lb/>
knights left alive out of the late wars, we were of one mind, and <reg orig="undis-|turbed">undisturbed</reg> <lb/>
by any troubling doubt; each and every one of these <reg orig="fifty-|two">fifty-two</reg> <lb/>
lads who stand here before you, said, 'They have chosen&mdash;it is <lb/>
their affair.' But think!&mdash;the matter is altered&mdash;<hi rend="italic">all England is march-</hi> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">ing against us!</hi> Oh, sir, consider!&mdash;reflect!&mdash;these people are our <lb/>
people, they are bone of our bone, flesh of our flesh, we love them&mdash;do <lb/>
not ask us to destroy our nation!"</p>
<p>Well, it shows the value of looking ahead, and being ready for a <lb/>
thing when it happens. If I hadn't foreseen this thing and been fixed, <lb/>
that boy would have had me!&mdash;I couldn't have said a word. But I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> <lb/>
fixed. I said:</p>
<p>"My boys, your hearts are in the right place, you have thought the <lb/>
worthy thought, you have done the worthy thing. You are English <lb/>
boys, you will remain English boys, and you will keep that name <reg orig="un-|smirched">unsmirched</reg>. <lb/>
Give yourselves no further concern, let your minds be at <lb/>
peace. Consider this: while all England <hi rend="italic">is</hi> marching against us, who <lb/>
is in the van? Who, by the commonest rules of war, will march in the <lb/>
front? Answer me."</p>
<pb n="553" entity="DSSR_000002494_0564"/>
<p>"The mounted host of mailed knights."</p>
<p>"True. They are 30,000 strong. Acres deep, they will march. <lb/>
Now, observe: none but <hi rend="italic">they</hi> will ever strike the sand-belt! Then <lb/>
there will be an episode! Immediately after, the civilian multitude in <lb/>
the rear will retire, to meet business engagements elsewhere. None <lb/>
but nobles and gentry are knights, and <hi rend="italic">none but these</hi> will remain to <lb/>
dance to our music after that episode. It is absolutely true that we <lb/>
shall have to fight nobody but these thirty thousand knights. Now <lb/>
speak, and it shall be as you decide. Shall we avoid the battle, retire <lb/>
from the field."</p>
<p>"NO!!!"</p>
<p>The shout was unanimous and hearty.</p>
<p>"Are you&mdash;are you&mdash;well, afraid of these thirty thousand <lb/>
knights?"</p>
<p>That joke brought out a good laugh, the boy's troubles vanished <lb/>
away, and they went gaily to their posts. Ah, they were a darling <lb/>
fifty-two! As pretty as girls, too.</p>
<p>I was ready for the enemy, now. Let the approaching big day <lb/>
come along&mdash;it would find us on deck.</p>
<p>The big day arrived on time. At dawn the sentry on watch in the <lb/>
corral came into the cave and reported a moving black mass under the <lb/>
horizon, and a faint sound which he thought to be military music. <lb/>
Breakfast was just ready; we sat down and ate it.</p>
<p>This over, I made the boys a little speech, and then sent out a <lb/>
detail to man the battery, with Clarence in command of it.</p>
<p>The sun rose presently and sent its unobstructed splendors over the <lb/>
land, and we saw a prodigious host moving slowly toward us, with the <lb/>
steady drift and aligned front of a wave of the sea. Nearer and nearer <lb/>
it came, and more and more sublimely imposing became its aspect; <lb/>
yes, all England was there, apparently. Soon we could see the <reg orig="innum-|erable">innumerable</reg> <lb/>
banners fluttering, and then the sun struck the sea of armor and <lb/>
<pb n="554" entity="DSSR_000002494_0565"/>
set it all aflash. Yes, it was a fine sight; I hadn't ever seen anything <lb/>
to beat it.</p>
<p>At last we could make out details. All the front ranks, no telling <lb/>
how many acres deep, were horsemen&mdash;plumed knights in armor. <lb/>
Suddenly we heard the blare of trumpets; the slow walk burst into a <lb/>
gallop, and then&mdash;well, it was wonderful to see! Down swept that <lb/>
vast horse-shoe wave&mdash;it approached the sand-belt&mdash;my breath stood <lb/>
still; nearer, nearer&mdash;the strip of green turf beyond the yellow belt <lb/>
grew narrow&mdash;narrower still&mdash;became a mere ribbon in front of the <lb/>
horses&mdash;then disappeared under their hoofs. Great Scott! Why, the <lb/>
whole front of that host shot into the sky with a thunder-crash, and <lb/>
became a whirling tempest of rags and fragments; and along the <lb/>
ground lay a thick wall of smoke that hid what was left of the multitude <lb/>
from our sight.</p>
<p>Time for the second step in the plan of campaign! I touched a <lb/>
button, and shook the bones of England loose from her spine!</p>
<p>In that explosion all our noble civilization-factories went up in <lb/>
the air and disappeared from the earth. It was a pity, but it was <lb/>
necessary. We could not afford to let the enemy turn our own <reg orig="weap-|ons">weapons</reg> <lb/>
against us.</p>
<p>Now ensued one of the dullest quarter-hours I had ever endured. <lb/>
We waited in a silent solitude enclosed by our circles of wire, and by <lb/>
a circle of heavy smoke outside of these. We couldn't see over the <lb/>
wall of smoke, and we couldn't see through it. But at last it began to <lb/>
shred away lazily, and by the end of another quarter-hour the land was <lb/>
clear and our curiosity was enabled to satisfy itself. No living creature <lb/>
was in sight! We now perceived that additions had been made to our <lb/>
defences. The dynamite had dug a ditch more than a hundred feet <lb/>
wide, all around us, and cast up an embankment some twenty-five feet <lb/>
high on both borders of it. As to destruction of life, it was amazing. <lb/>
Moreover, it was beyond estimate. Of course we could not <hi rend="italic">count</hi> the <lb/>

dead, because they did not exist as individuals, but merely as <reg orig="homo-|geneous">homogeneous</reg> <lb/>
protoplasm, with alloys of iron and buttons.</p>
<p>No life was in sight, but necessarily there must have been some <lb/>
wounded in the rear ranks, who were carried off the field under cover <lb/>
of the wall of smoke; there would be sickness among the others&mdash;there <lb/>
always is, after an episode like that. But there would be no <reg orig="reinforce-|ments">reinforcements</reg>; <lb/>
this was the last stand of the chivalry of England; it was all <lb/>
that was left of the order, after the recent annihilating wars. So I felt <lb/>
quite safe in believing that the utmost force that could for the future <lb/>
be brought against us would be but small; that is, of knights. I <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg> <lb/>
issued a congratulatory proclamation to my army in these words:</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Soldiers, Champions Of Human Liberty And Equality:</hi> Your General <reg orig="congratu-|lates">congratulates</reg> <lb/>
you! In the pride of his strength and the vanity of his renown, an arrogant enemy <lb/>
came against you. You were ready. The conflict was brief; on your side, glorious. <lb/>
This mighty victory having been achieved utterly without loss, stands without example <lb/>
in history. So long as the planets shall continue to move in their orbits, the <hi rend="small-caps">Battle</hi> <lb/>
<hi rend="small-caps">Of The Sand-Belt</hi> will not perish out of the memories of men. THE BOSS.</p>
<p>I read it well, and the applause I got was very gratifying to me. I <lb/>
then wound up with these remarks:</p>
<p>"The war with the English nation, as a nation, is at an end. The <lb/>
nation has retired from the field and the war. Before it can be <reg orig="per-|suaded">persuaded</reg> <lb/>
to return, war will have ceased. This campaign is the only <lb/>
one that is going to be fought. It will be brief&mdash;the briefest in history. <lb/>
Also the most destructive to life, considered from the standpoint of <lb/>
proportion of casualties to numbers engaged. We are done with the <lb/>
nation; henceforth we deal only with the knights. English knights <lb/>
can be killed, but they cannot be conquered. We know what is before <lb/>
us. While one of these men remains alive, our task is not finished, the <lb/>
war is not ended. We will kill them all." [Loud and long continued <lb/>
applause.]</p>
<p>I picketed the great embankments thrown up around our lines by <lb/>
<pb n="557" entity="DSSR_000002494_0568"/>
the dynamite explosion&mdash;merely a lookout of a couple of boys to <lb/>
announce the enemy when he should appear again.</p>
<p>Next, I sent an engineer and forty men to a point just beyond our <lb/>
lines on the south, to turn a mountain brook that was there, and bring <lb/>
it within our lines and under our command, arranging it in such a way <lb/>
that I could make instant use of it in an emergency. The forty men <lb/>
were divided into two shifts of twenty each, and were to relieve each <lb/>
other every two hours. In ten hours the work was accomplished.</p>
<p>It was nightfall, now, and I withdrew my pickets. The one who had <lb/>
had the northern outlook reported a camp in sight, but visible with the <lb/>
glass only. He also reported that a few knights had been feeling their <lb/>
way toward us, and had driven some cattle across our lines, but that <lb/>
the knights themselves had not come very near. That was what I had <lb/>
been expecting. They were feeling us, you see; they wanted to know <lb/>
if we were going to play that red terror on them again. They would <lb/>
grow bolder in the night, perhaps. I believed I knew what project <lb/>
they would attempt, because it was plainly the thing I would attempt <lb/>
myself if I were in their places and as ignorant as they were. I <reg orig="men-|tioned">mentioned</reg> <lb/>
it to Clarence.</p>
<p>"I think you are right," said he; "it is the obvious thing for them <lb/>
to try."</p>
<p>"Well, then," I said, "if they do it they are doomed."</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"They won't have the slightest show in the world."</p>
<p>"Of course they won't."</p>
<p>"It's dreadful, Clarence. It seems an awful pity."</p>
<p>The thing disturbed me so, that I couldn't get any peace of mind <lb/>
for thinking of it and worrying over it. So, at last, to quiet my <reg orig="con-|science">conscience</reg>, <lb/>
I framed this message to the knights:</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">To the Honorable the Commander of the Insurgent Chivalry of England</hi>: <lb/>
You fight in vain. We know your strength&mdash;if one may call it by that name. We know <lb/>
<pb n="558" entity="DSSR_000002494_0569"/>
that at the utmost you cannot bring against us above five and twenty thousand knights. <lb/>
Therefore, you have no chance&mdash;none whatever. Reflect: we are well equipped, well <lb/>
fortified, we number 54. Fifty-four what? Men? No, <hi rend="italic">minds</hi>&mdash;the capablest in the <lb/>
world; a force against which mere animal might may no more hope to prevail than may <lb/>
the idle waves of the sea hope to prevail against the granite barriers of England. Be <lb/>
advised. We offer you your lives; for the sake of your families, do not reject the gift. <lb/>
We offer you this chance, and it is the last: throw down your arms; surrender uncon <lb/>
ditionally to the Republic, and all will be forgiven.</p>
<p rend="right">(Signed). <hi rend="small-caps">The Boss.</hi></p>
<p>I read it to Clarence, and said I proposed to send it by a flag of <lb/>
truce. He laughed the sarcastic laugh he was born with, and said:</p>
<p>"Somehow it seems impossible for you to ever fully realize what <lb/>
these nobilities are. Now let us save a little time and trouble. <reg orig="Con-|sider">Consider</reg> <lb/>
me the commander of the knights yonder. Now then, you are <lb/>
the flag of truce; approach and deliver me your message, and I will <lb/>
give you your answer."</p>
<p>I humored the idea. I came forward under an imaginary guard of <lb/>
the enemy's soldiers, produced my paper, and read it through. For <lb/>
answer, Clarence struck the paper out of my hand, pursed up a <reg orig="scorn-|ful">scornful</reg> <lb/>
lip and said with lofty disdain&mdash;</p>
<p>"Dismember me this animal, and return him in a basket to the <lb/>
base-born knave who sent him; other answer have I none!"</p>
<p>How empty is theory in presence of fact! And this was just fact, <lb/>
and nothing else. It was the thing that would have happened, there <lb/>
was no getting around that. I tore up the paper and granted my <reg orig="mis-|timed">mistimed</reg> <lb/>
sentimentalities a permanent rest.</p>
<p>Then, to business. I tested the electric signals from the gatling <lb/>
platform to the cave, and made sure that they were all right; I tested <lb/>
and re-tested those which commanded the fences&mdash;these were signals <lb/>
whereby I could break and renew the electric current in each fence <lb/>
independently of the others, at will. I placed the brook-connection <lb/>
under the guard and authority of three of my best boys, who would <lb/>
alternate in two-hour watches all night and promptly obey my signal, <lb/>
<pb n="559" entity="DSSR_000002494_0570"/>
if I should have <reg orig="oc-|casion">occasion</reg> <lb/>
to give it&mdash; <lb/>
three <reg orig="revolver-|shots">revolver-shots</reg> <lb/>
in quick <reg orig="suc-|cession">succession</reg>. <lb/>
<reg orig="Sentry-|duty">Sentry-duty</reg> <lb/>
was discarded <lb/>
for the night, and <lb/>
the corral left <lb/>
empty of life; I <reg orig="or-|dered">ordered</reg> <lb/>
that quiet be <lb/>
maintained in the <lb/>
cave, and the <reg orig="elec-|tric">electric</reg> <lb/>
lights turned <lb/>
down to a glimmer.</p>
<p>As soon as it <lb/>
was good and dark, <lb/>
I shut off the <reg orig="cur-|rent">current</reg> <lb/>
from all of the <lb/>
fences, and then <lb/>
groped my way out <lb/>
to the embankment <lb/>
bordering our side <lb/>
of the great <reg orig="dyna-|mite">dynamite</reg> <lb/>
ditch. I crept <lb/>
to the top of it and <lb/>
lay there on the <lb/>
slant of the muck <lb/>
to watch. But it <lb/>
was too dark to see <lb/>
anything. As for <lb/>
sounds, there were <lb/>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f212" entity="DSSR_000002494_0570">
  <head>HIGH CHURCH.</head>
 </figure>
<pb n="560" entity="DSSR_000002494_0571"/>
none. The stillness was death-like. True, there were the usual <reg orig="night-|sounds">night-sounds</reg> <lb/>
of the country&mdash;the whir of night-birds, the buzzing of insects, <lb/>
the barking of distant dogs, the mellow lowing of far-off kine&mdash;but <lb/>
these didn't seem to break the stillness, they only intensified it, and <lb/>
added a grewsome melancholy to it into the bargain.</p>
<p>I presently gave up looking, the night shut down so black, but I <lb/>
kept my ears strained to catch the least suspicious sound, for I judged <lb/>
I had only to wait and I shouldn't be disappointed. However, I had <lb/>
to wait a long time. At last I caught what you may call indistinct <lb/>
glimpses of sound&mdash;dulled metallic sound. I pricked up my ears, then, <lb/>
and held my breath, for this was the sort of thing I had been waiting <lb/>
for. This sound thickened, and approached&mdash;from toward the north. <lb/>
Presently I heard it at my own level&mdash;the ridge-top of the opposite <lb/>
embankment, a hundred feet or more away. Then I seemed to see a <lb/>
row of black dots appear along that ridge&mdash;human heads? I couldn't <lb/>
tell; it mightn't be anything at all; you can't depend on your eyes <lb/>
when your imagination is out of focus. However, the question was <lb/>
soon settled. I heard that metallic noise descending into the great <lb/>
ditch. It augmented fast, it spread all along, and it unmistakably <reg orig="fur-|nished">furnished</reg> <lb/>
me this fact: an armed host was taking up its quarters in the <lb/>
ditch. Yes, these people were arranging a little surprise party for us. <lb/>
We could expect entertainment about dawn, possibly earlier.</p>
<p>I groped my way back to the corral, now; I had seen enough. I <lb/>
went to the platform and signalled to turn the current onto the two <lb/>
inner fences. Then I went into the cave, and found everything <reg orig="satis-|factory">satisfactory</reg> <lb/>
there&mdash;nobody awake but the working-watch. I woke <reg orig="Clar-|ence">Clarence</reg> <lb/>
and told him the great ditch was filling up with men, and that I <lb/>
believed all the knights were coming for us in a body. It was my <reg orig="no-|tion">notion</reg> <lb/>
that as soon as dawn approached we could expect the ditch's <lb/>
ambuscaded thousands to swarm up over the embankment and make <lb/>
an assault, and be followed immediately by the rest of their army.</p>
<pb n="561" entity="DSSR_000002494_0572"/>
<p>Clarence said:</p>
<p>"They will be wanting to send a scout or two in the dark to make <lb/>
preliminary observations. Why not take the lightning off the outer <lb/>
fences, and give them a chance?"</p>
<p>"I've already done it, Clarence. Did you ever know me to be <lb/>
inhospitable?"</p>
<p>"No, you are a good heart. I want to go and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Be a reception committee? I will go, too."</p>
<p>We crossed the corral and lay down together between the two <lb/>
inside fences. Even the dim light of the cave had disordered our <reg orig="eye-|sight">eyesight</reg> <lb/>
somewhat, but the focus straightway began to regulate itself and <lb/>
soon it was adjusted for present circumstances. We had had to feel <lb/>
our way before, but we could make out to see the fence posts now. <lb/>
We started a whispered conversation, but suddenly Clarence broke off <lb/>
and said:</p>
<p>"What is that?"</p>
<p>"What is what?"</p>
<p>"That thing yonder?"</p>
<p>"What thing&mdash;where?"</p>
<p>"There beyond you a little piece&mdash;a dark something&mdash;a dull shape <lb/>
of some kind&mdash;against the second fence."</p>
<p>I gazed and he gazed. I said:</p>
<p>"Could it be a man, Clarence?"</p>
<p>"No, I think not. If you notice, it looks a lit&mdash;why, it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a man!&mdash; <lb/>
leaning on the fence."</p>
<p>"I certainly believe it is; let's us go and see."</p>
<p>We crept along on our hands and knees until we were pretty close, <lb/>
and then looked up. Yes, it was a man&mdash;a dim great figure in armor, <lb/>
standing erect, with both hands on the upper wire&mdash;and of course there <lb/>
was a smell of burning flesh. Poor fellow, dead as a door-nail, and <lb/>
never knew what hurt him. He stood there like a statue&mdash;no motion <lb/>
<pb n="562" entity="DSSR_000002494_0573"/>
about him, except that his plumes <lb/>
swished about a little in the night <lb/>
wind. We rose up and looked in <lb/>
through the bars of his visor, but <lb/>
couldn't make out whether we knew <lb/>
him or not&mdash;features too dim and shadowed. <lb/>
We heard muffled sounds approaching, <lb/>
and we sank down to the ground where we <lb/>
were. We made out another knight <lb/>
vaguely; he was coming very <reg orig="stealth-|ily">stealthily</reg>, <lb/>
and feeling his way. He was near <lb/>
enough, now, for us to see him put <lb/>
out a hand, find an upper wire, then <lb/>
bend and step under it and over the <lb/>
lower one. Now he arrived at the <lb/>
first knight&mdash;and started slightly <lb/>
when he discovered him. He stood <lb/>
a moment&mdash;no doubt wondering <lb/>
why the other one didn't move <lb/>
on; then he said, in a low <lb/>
voice, "Why dreamest thou <lb/>
here, good Sir Mar&mdash;" then <lb/>
he laid his hand on <lb/>
the corpse's <lb/>
shoulder&mdash;and <lb/>
just <reg orig="utter-|ed">uttered</reg> <lb/>
a little <lb/>
soft moan <lb/>
and sunk <lb/>
down <lb/>
dead.</p>

  <head>AFTER THE EXPLOSION.</head>
 </figure>

<pb n="563" entity="DSSR_000002494_0574"/>
<p>Killed by a dead man, you see&mdash;killed by a dead friend, in fact. <lb/>
There was something awful about it.</p>
<p>These early birds came scattering along after each other, about <lb/>
one every five minutes in our vicinity, during half an hour. They <lb/>
brought no armor of offence but their swords; as a rule they carried <lb/>
the sword ready in the hand, and put it forward and found the wires <lb/>
with it. We would now and then see a blue spark when the knight <lb/>
that caused it was so far away as to be invisible to us; but we knew <lb/>
what had happened, all the same, poor fellow; he had touched a <lb/>
charged wire with his sword and been elected. We had brief intervals <lb/>
of grim stillness, interrupted with piteous regularity by the clash made <lb/>
by the falling of an iron-clad; and this sort of thing was going on, right <lb/>
along, and was very creepy, there in the dark and lonesomeness.</p>
<p>We concluded to make a tour between the inner fences. We elected <lb/>
to walk upright, for convenience sake; we argued that if discerned, we <lb/>
should be taken for friends rather than enemies, and in any case we <lb/>
should be out of reach of swords, and these gentry did not seem to <lb/>
have any spears along. Well, it was a curious trip. Everywhere dead <lb/>
men were lying outside the second fence&mdash;not plainly visible, but still <lb/>
visible; and we counted fifteen of those pathetic statues&mdash;dead knights <lb/>
standing with their hands on the upper wire.</p>
<p>One thing seemed to be sufficiently demonstrated: our current was <lb/>
so tremendous that it killed before the victim could cry out. Pretty <lb/>
soon we detected a muffled and heavy sound, and next moment we <lb/>
guessed what it was. It was a surprise in force coming! I whispered <lb/>
Clarence to go and wake the army, and notify it to wait in silence in <lb/>
the cave for further orders. He was soon back, and we stood by the <lb/>
inner fence and watched the silent lightning do its awful work upon <lb/>
that swarming host. One could make out but little of detail; but he <lb/>
could note that a black mass was piling itself up beyond the second <lb/>
fence. That swelling bulk was dead men! Our camp was enclosed <lb/>
<pb n="564" entity="DSSR_000002494_0575"/>
with a solid wall of the dead&mdash;a bulwark, a breastwork, of corpses, <lb/>
you may say. One terrible thing about this thing was the absence <lb/>
of human voices; there were no cheers, no war cries: being intent <lb/>
upon a surprise, these men moved as noiselessly as they could; and <lb/>
always when the front rank was near enough to their goal to make it <lb/>
proper for them to begin to get a shout ready, of course they struck <lb/>
the fatal line and went down without testifying.</p>
<p>I sent a current through the third fence, now; and almost <reg orig="immedi-|ately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
through the fourth and fifth, so quickly were the gaps filled up. <lb/>
I believed the time was come, now, for my climax; I believed that <lb/>
that whole army was in our trap. Anyway, it was high time to find <lb/>
out. So I touched a button and set fifty electric suns aflame on the top <lb/>
of our precipice.</p>
<p>Land, what a sight! We were enclosed in three walls of dead men! <lb/>
All the other fences were pretty nearly filled with the living, who were <lb/>
stealthily working their way forward through the wires. The sudden <lb/>
glare paralyzed this host, petrified them, you may say, with <reg orig="astonish-|ment">astonishment</reg>; <lb/>
there was just one instant for me to utilize their immobility in, <lb/>
and I didn't lose the chance. You see, in another instant they would <lb/>
have recovered their faculties, then they'd have burst into a cheer and <lb/>
made a rush, and my wires would have gone down before it; but that <lb/>
lost instant lost them their opportunity forever; while even that slight <lb/>
fragment of time was still unspent, I shot the current through all the <lb/>
fences and struck the whole host dead in their tracks! <hi rend="italic">There</hi> was a <lb/>
groan you could <hi rend="italic">hear!</hi> It voiced the death-pang of eleven thousand <lb/>
men. It swelled out on the night with awful pathos.</p>
<p>A glance showed that the rest of the enemy&mdash;perhaps ten thousand <lb/>
strong&mdash;were between us and the encircling ditch, and pressing <reg orig="for-|ward">forward</reg> <lb/>
to the assault. Consequently we had them <hi rend="italic">all!</hi> and had them <lb/>
past help. Time for the last act of the tragedy. I fired the three <reg orig="ap-|pointed">appointed</reg> <lb/>
revolver shots&mdash;which meant:</p>
<pb n="565" entity="DSSR_000002494_0576"/>
<p>"Turn on the water!"</p>
<p>There was a sudden rush and roar, and in a minute the mountain <lb/>
brook was raging through the big ditch and creating a river a hundred <lb/>
feet wide and twenty-five deep.</p>
<p>"Stand to your guns, men! Open fire!"</p>
<p>The thirteen gatlings began to vomit death into the fated ten <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg>. <lb/>
They halted, they stood their ground a moment against that <lb/>
withering deluge of fire, then they broke, faced about and swept <reg orig="tow-|ard">toward</reg> <lb/>
the ditch like chaff before a gale. A full fourth part of their force <lb/>
never reached the top of the lofty embankment; the three-fourths <lb/>
reached it and plunged over&mdash;to death by drowning.</p>

<p>Within ten short minutes after we had opened fire, armed <reg orig="resist-|ance">resistance</reg> <lb/>

<head>CHAPTER XLIV.<lb/>A POSTSCRIPT BY CLARENCE.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I clarence</hi>, must write it for him. He <reg orig="pro-|posed">proposed</reg> <lb/>
that we two go out and see if any help <lb/>
could be afforded the wounded. I was <reg orig="strenu-|ous">strenuous</reg> <lb/>
against the project. I said that if there <lb/>
were many, we could do but little for them; <lb/>
and it would not be wise for us to trust <reg orig="our-|selves">ourselves</reg> <lb/>
among them, anyway. But he could <lb/>
seldom be turned from a purpose once <reg orig="form-|ed">formed</reg>; <lb/>
so we shut off the electric current from <lb/>
the fences, took an escort along, climbed <lb/>
over the enclosing ramparts of dead knights, <lb/>
and moved out upon the field. The first <lb/>
wounded man who appealed for help, was <lb/>
sitting with his back against a dead comrade. <lb/>
When the Boss bent over him and spoke to <lb/>
him, the man recognized him and stabbed him. <lb/>
That knight was Sir Meliagraunce, as I found <lb/>
out by tearing off his helmet. He will not ask <lb/>
for help any more.</p>
<p>We carried the Boss to the cave and gave <lb/>
his wound, which was not very serious, the best <lb/>
care we could. In this service we had the <lb/>
help of Merlin, though we did not know it. <lb/>
He was disguised as a woman, and appeared to be a simple old <reg orig="peas-|ant">peasant</reg> <lb/>
goodwife. In this disguise, with brown-stained face and smooth <lb/>
 <figure rend="inline" id="f216" entity="DSSR_000002494_0580"/>
<pb n="570" entity="DSSR_000002494_0581"/>
shaven, he had appeared a few days after the Boss was hurt, and <lb/>
offered to cook for us, saying her people had gone off to join certain <lb/>
new camps which the enemy were forming, and that she was starving. <lb/>
The Boss had been getting along very well, and had amused himself <lb/>
with finishing up his record.</p>
<p>We were glad to have this woman, for we were short handed. We <lb/>
were in a trap, you see&mdash;a trap of our own making. If we stayed <lb/>
where we were, our dead would kill us; if we moved out of our <reg orig="de-|fences">defences</reg>, <lb/>
we should no longer be invincible. We had conquered; in turn <lb/>
we were conquered. The Boss recognized this; we all recognized it. <lb/>
If we could go to one of those new camps and patch up some kind of <lb/>
terms with the enemy&mdash;yes, but the Boss could not go, and neither <lb/>
could I, for I was among the first that were made sick by the <reg orig="poison-|ous">poisonous</reg> <lb/>
air bred by those dead thousands. Others were taken down, and <lb/>
still others. To-morrow&mdash;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">To-morrow.</hi> It is here. And with it the end. About midnight I <lb/>
awoke, and saw that hag making curious passes in the air about the <lb/>
Boss's head and face, and wondered what it meant. Everybody but <lb/>
the dynamo-watch lay steeped in sleep; there was no sound. The <lb/>
woman ceased from her mysterious foolery, and started tip-toeing <lb/>
toward the door. I called out&mdash;</p>
<p>"Stop! What have you been doing?"</p>
<p>She halted, and said with an accent of malicious satisfaction:</p>
<p>"Ye were conquerors; ye are conquered! These others are <reg orig="perish-|ing&mdash;you">perishing&mdash;you</reg> <lb/>
also. Ye shall all die in this place&mdash;every one&mdash;except <hi rend="italic">him.</hi> <lb/>
He sleepeth, now&mdash;and shall sleep thirteen centuries. I am Merlin!"</p>
<p>Then such a delirium of silly laughter overtook him that he reeled <lb/>
about like a drunken man, and presently fetched up against one of our <lb/>
wires. His mouth is spread open yet; apparently he is still laughing. <lb/>
I suppose the face will retain that petrified laugh until the corpse turns <lb/>
to dust.</p>
<pb n="571" entity="DSSR_000002494_0582"/>
<p>The Boss has never stirred&mdash;sleeps like a stone. If he does not <lb/>
wake to-day we shall understand what kind of a sleep it is, and his <lb/>
body will then be borne to a place in one of the remote recesses of the <lb/>
cave where none will ever find it to desecrate it. As for the rest of us <lb/>
&mdash;well, it is agreed that if any one of us ever escapes alive from this <lb/>
place, he will write the fact here, and loyally hide this Manuscript with <lb/>
the Boss, our dear good chief, whose property it is, be he alive or dead.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> dawn was come when I laid the Manuscript aside. The rain <lb/>
had almost ceased, the world was gray and sad, the exhausted storm <lb/>
was sighing and sobbing itself to rest. I went to the stranger's room, <lb/>

and listened at his door, which was slightly ajar. I could hear his <lb/>
voice, and so I knocked. There was no answer, but I still heard the <lb/>
voice. I peeped in. The man lay on his back, in bed, talking brokenly <lb/>
but with spirit, and punctuating with his arms, which he thrashed about, <lb/>
restlessly, as sick people do in delirium. I slipped in softly and bent <lb/>
over him. His mutterings and ejaculations went on. I spoke&mdash;merely <lb/>
a word, to call his attention. His glassy eyes and his ashy face were <lb/>
alight in an instant with pleasure, gratitude, gladness, welcome:</p>
 <figure rend="block" id="f219" entity="DSSR_000002494_0584">
  <head>"HANDS OFF! MY PERSON IS SACRED."</head>
 </figure>

 <p>"O, Sandy, you are come at last&mdash;how I have longed for you! <lb/>
Sit by me&mdash;do not leave me&mdash;never leave me again, Sandy, never <lb/>
again. Where is your hand?&mdash;give it me, dear, let me hold it&mdash;there <lb/>
&mdash;now all is well, all is peace, and I am happy again&mdash;<hi rend="italic">we</hi> are happy <lb/>
again, isn't it so, Sandy? You are so dim, so vague, you are but a <lb/>
mist, a cloud, but you are <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> and that is blessedness sufficient; and <lb/>
<pb n="574" entity="DSSR_000002494_0585"/>
I have your hand; don't take it away&mdash;it is for only a little while, I shall <lb/>
not require it long. . . . . Was that the child? . . . . <reg orig="Hello-|Central">Hello-Central</reg>! <lb/>
. . . She doesn't answer. Asleep, perhaps? Bring her <lb/>
when she wakes, and let me touch her hands, her face, her hair, and <lb/>
tell her good-bye. . . . . . . Sandy! . . . . . Yes, you <lb/>
are there. I lost myself a moment, and I thought you were gone. <lb/>
. . Have I been sick long? It must be so; it seems months to me. <lb/>
And such dreams! such strange and awful dreams, Sandy! Dreams <lb/>
that were as real as reality&mdash;delirium, of course, but <hi rend="italic">so</hi> real! Why, I <lb/>
thought the king was dead, I thought you were in Gaul and couldn't <lb/>
get home, I thought there was a revolution; in the fantastic frenzy of <lb/>
these dreams, I thought that Clarence and I and a handful of my cadets <lb/>
fought and exterminated the whole chivalry of England! But even <lb/>
that was not the strangest. I seemed to be a creature out of a remote <lb/>
unborn age, centuries hence, and even <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was as real as the rest! <lb/>
Yes, I seemed to have flown back out of that age into this of ours, and <lb/>
then forward to it again, and was set down, a stranger and forlorn in <lb/>
that strange England, with an abyss of thirteen centuries yawning <lb/>
between me and you! between me and my home and my friends! <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
me and all that is dear to me, all that could make life worth the <lb/>
living! It was awful&mdash;awfuler than you can ever imagine, Sandy. Ah, <lb/>
watch by me, Sandy&mdash;stay by me every moment&mdash;<hi rend="italic">don't</hi> let me go out <lb/>
of my mind again; death is nothing, let it come, but not with those <lb/>
dreams, not with the torture of those hideous dreams&mdash;I cannot endure <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">that</hi> again. . . . . . . . Sandy? . . . . ."</p>
<p>He lay muttering incoherently some little time; then for a time he <lb/>
lay silent, and apparently sinking away toward death. Presently his <lb/>
fingers began to pick busily at the coverlet, and by that sign I knew <lb/>
that his end was at hand. With the first suggestion of the <reg orig="death-|rattle">death-rattle</reg> <lb/>
in his throat he started up slightly, and seemed to listen; then <lb/>
he said:</p>
<pb n="575" entity="DSSR_000002494_0586"/>
<p>"A bugle? . . . . . It is the king! The drawbridge, there! <lb/>
Man the battlements!&mdash;turn out the&mdash;"</p>
<p>He was getting up his last "effect;" but he never finished it.</p>
