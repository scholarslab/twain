   <p>Residents of Elmira cherished fond<lb/>
    memories of Mark Twain. With Mrs.<lb/>
    Clemens and the children he had spent<lb/>
    many happy summers at Quarry Farm,<lb/>
    on East Hill, overlooking the city,<lb/>
    the home of Mrs. Susan L. Crane. Mrs.<lb/>
    Clemens's sister, who was one of those<lb/>
    who mourned to-day. A path from the<lb/>
    Crane house winds through the wooded<lb/>
    grounds to the summer lodge which was<lb/>
    Mark Twain's workshop.  Here he wrote<lb/>
    "Roughing It," "A Tramp Abroad" and <lb/>
    other works.
   </p>
   <p>
    Below this lodge, a short way down in<lb/>
    the wodds, is another rustic structure<lb/>
    with barked roof, which the author built <lb/>
    for his children.  Here may still be seen<lb/>
    many of the playthings of the little ones<lb/>
    &mdash; undisturbed since their occupancy.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was during the Quaker City Expedition<lb/>
    in 1867, which Twain has immortalized<lb/>
    in "The Innocents Abroad,"<lb/>
    that the humorist met General Langdon,<lb/>
    then a young man, the son of Jarvis<lb/>
    Langdon, a wealthy Elmiran.  Langdon<lb/>
    took kindly to young Clemens and the<lb/>
    intimacy which gre out of the meeting <lb/>
    led to marriage of the author with Olivia<lb/>
    L. Langdon.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I saw her first," wrote Twain of his <lb/>
    wife in his autobiography, "in the form of<lb/>
    an ivory miniature in her borther <lb/>
    Charley's stateroom in the steamer <lb/>
    Quaker City in the Bay of Smyrna, in the <lb/>
    summer of 1867, when she was in her 22d<lb/>
    year. I saw her in the flesh for the first <lb/>
    time in New York in the following December.<lb/>
    She was slender and beautiful <lb/>
    and girlish, and she was both girl and <lb/>
    woman. She remained both girl and<lb/>
    woman to the last of her life."
   </p>
   <p>
    Over Mrs. Clemens's grace alongside<lb/>
    the fresh made one to-day stands a stone<lb/>
    engraved with this epitaph:<lb/>
    <q>
     <l>Warm summer sun</l>
     <l>Shine kindly here.</l>
     <l>Warm southern wind</l>
     <l>Blow softly here.</l>
     <l>Green sod above</l>
     <l>Lie light, lie light.</l>
     <l>Good night, dear heart</l>
     <l>Good night, good night.</l>

      </p>
      <p>
       <hi rend="small-caps">hannibal</hi>, Mo., April 21. &mdash; The news<lb/>
       of the death of Samuel L. Clemens (Mark<lb/>
       Twain) was learned in this, his boyhood<lb/>
       home, with the deepest sorrow. When the<lb/>
       news was told to Mrs. Laura Fraser<lb/>
       (Becky Thatcher), the humorist's first <lb/>
       sweetheart, she was overcome with grief<lb/>
       and wept.
      </p>
      <p>
       <hi rend="small-caps">paris</hi>, Mo., April 21. &mdash; "The old days are<lb/>
       passing. The men who made them are<lb/>
       gone, and even the long sweep of the majestic<lb/>
       yellow river seems to have dwindled<lb/>
       and lessened. The noise of its traffic, the<lb/>
       music of its many deep-throated voices<lb/>
       are practically no more. The man who <lb/>
       caught them and who froze them into human<lb/>
       words for the delight of the world is<lb/>
       dead."
      </p>
      <p>
       So spoke B. C. M. (Barney) Farthing,<lb/>
       friend and schoolmate of Mark Twain, and<lb/>
       the original of "Huckleberry Finn," when <lb/>
       told to-night of the death of his boyhood<lb/>
       friend and companion, wiping tears from<lb/>
       his eyes as he did so.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I can't talk to you about it," he said,<lb/>
       "for all that I might say would be either<lb/>
       construed as boasting intimacy with the<lb/>
       greatest literary figure the Nation has ever<lb/>
       produced or as an effort to gain a cheap<lb/>
       notoriety.  I desire neither. Even the sale<lb/>
       of the manuscript I have dealing with the<lb/>
       old days at Hannibal and the poetry of the <lb/>
       great river seems a sacriledge now.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I prepared it in love and for the instruction<lb/>
       of those who did not know the<lb/>
       older life, and somehow I hate to either<lb/>
       write or speak of the matter. I can see<lb/>
       the gray-haired man who died in Redding<lb/>
       to-day as he stood at the windown of<lb/>
       the old Hannival Courier office, fifty years<lb/>
       ago, his sleeves rolled up, leaning on his<lb/>
       case, bargaining with me and his younger<lb/>
       brother Henry for a mite of a boat that<lb/>
       lay down at the river's edge.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I can see the schocky hair and the quizzical <lb/>

       withal the shrewdness, that shone from<lb/>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<ornament type="line"/>
<p>Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two were <lb/>
experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates of mine. <lb/>
Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an individual&mdash;he <lb/>
is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom I knew, and therefore <lb/>
belongs to the composite order of architecture.</p>
<p>The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and slaves <lb/>
in the West at the period of this story&mdash;that is to say, thirty or forty years ago.</p>
<p>Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls, I <lb/>
hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account, for part of my <lb/>
plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what they once were <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>, <lb/>
and of how they felt and thought and talked, and what queer enterprises <lb/>
they sometimes engaged in.</p>

vines and "jimpson" weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So she <lb/>
lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg>, <lb/>
and shouted:</p>
<p>"Y-o-u-u <hi rend="italic">Tom!</hi>"</p>
<p>There was a slight noise behind her and she <lb/>
turned just in time to seize a small boy by the <lb/>
slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.</p>
<p>"There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. <lb/>
What you been doing in there?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at <lb/>
your mouth. What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> that truck?"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't know, aunt."</p>
<p>"Well, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know. It's jam&mdash;that's what it is. <lb/>
Forty times I've said if you didn't let that jam <lb/>
alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch."</p>
<p>The switch hovered in the air&mdash;the peril was <lb/>
desperate&mdash;</p>
<p>"My! Look behind you, aunt!"</p>
<p>The old lady whirled round, and snatched her <lb/>
skirts out of danger. The lad fled, on the <lb/>
instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and <lb/>
disappeared over it.</p>

<p>His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle laugh.</p>
<p>"Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything? Ain't he played me tricks <lb/>
enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old fools <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="DSSR_000002931_0034"/>
is the biggest fools there is. Can't learn an old dog new tricks, as the saying is. <lb/>
But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days, and how is a body <lb/>
to know what's coming? He 'pears to know just how long he can torment me <lb/>
before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a <lb/>
minute or make me laugh, it's all down again and I can't hit him a lick. I <lb/>
ain't doing my duty by that boy, and that's the Lord's truth, goodness knows. <lb/>
Spare the rod and spile the child, as the Good Book says. I'm a laying up sin <lb/>
and suffering for us both, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know. He's full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! <lb/>
he's my own dead sister's boy, poor thing, and I ain't got the heart to lash him, <lb/>
somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and every <lb/>
time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is born of <lb/>
woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says, and I reckon it's <lb/>
so. He'll play hookey this evening,<ref target="n1" n="1">*</ref>
<note id="n1" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>South-western for "afternoon."</p></note>
 and I'll just be obleeged to make him <lb/>
work, tomorrow, to punish him. It's mighty hard to make him work Saturdays, <lb/>
when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he hates <lb/>
anything else, and I've <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to do some of my duty by him, or I'll be the <reg orig="ruina-|tion">ruination</reg> <lb/>
of the child."</p>
<p>Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home <lb/>
barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day's wood and <lb/>
split the kindlings before <reg orig="sup-|per&mdash;at">supper&mdash;at</reg> <lb/>
least he was there in <lb/>
time to tell his adventures <lb/>
to Jim while Jim did <reg orig="three-|fourths">three-fourths</reg> <lb/>
of the work. Tom's <lb/>
younger brother (or rather, <lb/>
half-brother) Sid, was already <lb/>
through with his part of the <lb/>
work (picking up chips) for <lb/>
he was a quiet boy, and had <lb/>
no adventurous, troublesome <lb/>
ways.</p>
<figure id="f4" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0034">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">a good opportunity</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity offered, <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="DSSR_000002931_0035"/>
Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and very deep&mdash;for she <lb/>
wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like many other <reg orig="simple-|hearted">simple-hearted</reg> <lb/>
souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent <lb/>
for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate her most <lb/>
transparent devices as marvels of low cunning. Said she:</p>
<p>"Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes'm."</p>
<p>"Powerful warm, warn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes'm."</p>
<p>"Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?"</p>
<p>A bit of a scare shot through Tom&mdash;a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He <lb/>
searched Aunt Polly's face, but it told him nothing. So he said:</p>
<p>"No'm&mdash;well, not very much."</p>
<p>The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and said:</p>
<p>"But you ain't too warm now, though." And it flattered her to reflect that <lb/>
she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that that <lb/>
was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew where the wind <lb/>
lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:</p>
<p>"Some of us pumped on our heads&mdash;mine's damp yet. See?"</p>
<p>Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial <lb/>
evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new inspiration:</p>
<p>"Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump <lb/>
on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!"</p>
<p>The trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket. His shirt <lb/>
collar was securely sewed.</p>
<p>"Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played hookey and <lb/>
been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're a kind of a singed <lb/>
cat, as the saying is&mdash;better'n you look. <hi rend="italic">This</hi>time."</p>
<p>She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom had <lb/>
stumbled into obedient conduct for once.</p>
<p>But Sidney said:</p>
<p>"Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread, but it's <lb/>
black."</p>
<pb n="21" entity="DSSR_000002931_0036"/>
<p>"Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!"</p>
<p>But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:</p>
<p>"Siddy, I'll lick you for that."</p>
<p>In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into the <lb/>
lappels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them&mdash;one needle carried <lb/>
white thread and the other black. He said:</p>
<p>"She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes she sews <lb/>
it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to geeminy she'd stick <lb/>
to one or t'other&mdash;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> can't keep the run of 'em. But I bet you I'll lam Sid for that. <lb/>
I'll learn him!"</p>
<p>He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well <lb/>
though&mdash;and loathed him.</p>
<p>Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not because <lb/>
his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man's are to a man, <lb/>
but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of <lb/>
his mind for the time&mdash;just as men's misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of <lb/>
new enterprises. This new interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he <lb/>
had just acquired from a negro, and he was suffering to practice it undisturbed. It <lb/>
consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by touching <lb/>
the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music&mdash; <lb/>
the reader probably remembers how to do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence <lb/>
and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his <lb/>
mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an <reg orig="astron-|omer">astronomer</reg> <lb/>
feels who has discovered a new planet&mdash;no doubt, as far as strong, deep, <lb/>
unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the astronomer.</p>
<p>The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom checked <lb/>
his whistle. A stranger was before him&mdash;a boy a shade larger than himself. A <lb/>
new comer of any age or either sex was an impressive curiosity in the poor little <lb/>
shabby village of St. Petersburgh. This boy was well-dressed, too&mdash;well-dressed on <lb/>
a week-day. This was simply astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his <reg orig="close-|buttoned">close-buttoned</reg> <lb/>
blue cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. <lb/>
He had shoes on&mdash;and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="DSSR_000002931_0037"/>
of ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom's vitals. The more <lb/>
Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose at his finery <lb/>
and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow. Neither boy <lb/>
spoke. If one moved, the other moved&mdash;but only sidewise, in a circle; they kept <lb/>
face to face and eye to eye all the time. Finally Tom said:</p>
<p>"I can lick you!"</p>
<p>"I'd like to see you try it."</p>
<p>"Well, I can do it."</p>
<p>"No you can't, either."</p>
<p>"Yes I can."</p>
<p>"No you can't."</p>
<p>"I can."</p>
<p>"You can't."</p>
<p>"Can!"</p>
<p>"Can't!"</p>
<p>An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:</p>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>"'Tisn't any of your business, maybe."</p>
<p>"Well I 'low I'll <hi rend="italic">make</hi> it my business."</p>
<p>"Well why don't you?"</p>
<p>"If you say much I will."</p>
<p>"Much&mdash;much&mdash;<hi rend="italic">much</hi>. There now."</p>
<p>"Oh, you think you're mighty smart, <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> you? I could lick you with one <lb/>
hand tied behind me, if I wanted to."</p>
<p>"Well why don't you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it? You <hi rend="italic">say</hi> you can do it."</p>
<p>"Well I <hi rend="italic">will</hi>, if you fool with me."</p>
<p>"Oh yes&mdash;I've seen whole families in the same fix."</p>
<p>"Smarty! You think you're <hi rend="italic">some</hi>, now, <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> you? Oh what a hat!"</p>
<p>"You can lump that hat if you don't like it. I dare you to knock it off&mdash;and <lb/>
anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs."</p>
<p>"You're a liar!"</p>
<p>"You're another."</p>
<pb n="23" entity="DSSR_000002931_0038"/>
<p>"You're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up."</p>
<p>"Aw&mdash;take a walk!"</p>
<p>"Say&mdash;if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and bounce a rock off'n <lb/>
your head."</p>
<p>"Oh, of <hi rend="italic">course</hi> you will."</p>
<p>"Well I <hi rend="italic">will,</hi>"</p>
<p>"Well why don't you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it then? What do you keep <hi rend="italic">saying</hi> you will for? Why <lb/>
don't you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it? It's because you're afraid."</p>
<p>"I <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> afraid."</p>
<p>"You are."</p>
<p>"I ain't."</p>
<p>"You are."</p>
<p>Another pause, and more eyeing and <reg orig="sid-|ling">sidling</reg> <lb/>
around each other. Presently they <lb/>
were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:</p>
<p>"Get away from here!"</p>
<p>"Go away yourself!"</p>
<p>"I won't."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">I</hi> won't either."</p>
<figure id="f5" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0038">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">who's afraid?</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>So they stood, each with a foot placed <lb/>
at an angle as a brace, and both shoving <lb/>
with might and main, and glowering at each <lb/>
other with hate. But neither could get an <lb/>
advantage. After struggling till both were <lb/>
hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain with <lb/>
watchful caution, and Tom said:</p>
<p>"You're a coward and a pup. I'll tell my big brother on you, and he can thrash <lb/>
you with his little finger, and I'll make him do it, too."</p>
<p>"What do I care for your big brother? I've got a brother that's bigger than he <lb/>
is&mdash;and what's more, he can throw him over that fence, too." [Both brothers were <lb/>
imaginary.]</p>
<p>"That's a lie."</p>
<pb n="24" entity="DSSR_000002931_0039"/>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Your</hi> saying so don't make it so."</p>
<p>Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:</p>
<p>"I dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you can't stand up. Anybody <lb/>
that'll take a dare will steal sheep."</p>
<p>The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:</p>
<p>"Now you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it."</p>
<p>"Don't you crowd me now; you better look out."</p>
<p>"Well, you <hi rend="italic">said</hi> you'd do it&mdash;why don't you do it?"</p>
<p>"By jingo! for two cents I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> do it."</p>
<p>The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out with <lb/>
derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys were rolling <lb/>
and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and for the space of a minute <lb/>
they tugged and tore at each other's hair and clothes, punched and scratched <lb/>
each other's noses, and covered themselves with dust and glory. Presently the <lb/>
confusion took form and through the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the <lb/>
new boy, and pounding him with his fists.</p>
<p>"Holler 'nuff!" said he.</p>
<p>The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying&mdash;mainly from rage.</p>
<p>"Holler 'nuff!"&mdash;and the pounding went on.</p>
<p>At last the stranger got out a smothered "'Nuff!" and Tom let him up and said:</p>
<p>"Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with next time."</p>
<p>The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, <lb/>
and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he <lb/>
would do to Tom the "next time he caught him out." To which Tom responded <lb/>
with jeers, and started off in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the <lb/>
new boy snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and <lb/>
then turned tail and ran like an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus <lb/>
found out where he lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, <lb/>
daring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through <lb/>
the window and declined. At last the enemy's mother appeared, and called Tom <lb/>
a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but he <lb/>
said he "'loved" to "lay" for that boy.</p>
<pb n="25" entity="DSSR_000002931_0040"/>
<p>He got home pretty late, that night, and when he climbed cautiously in at the <lb/>
window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and when she <lb/>
saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into <lb/>
captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Saturday</hi> morning was <lb/>
come, and all the summer world was <lb/>
bright and fresh, and brimming with <lb/>
life. There was a song in every heart; <lb/>
and if the heart was young the music <lb/>
issued at the lips. There was cheer <lb/>
in every face and a spring in every <lb/>
step. The locust trees were in bloom <lb/>
and the fragrance of the blossoms <lb/>
filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond <lb/>
the village and above it, was green <lb/>
with vegetation, and it lay just far <lb/>
enough away to seem a Delectable <lb/>
Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.</p>
<p>Tom appeared on the sidewalk with <lb/>
a bucket of whitewash and a <reg orig="long-|handled">long-handled</reg> <lb/>
brush. He surveyed the <lb/>
fence, and all gladness left him and <lb/>
a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence <lb/>
nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. Sighing <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="DSSR_000002931_0042"/>
he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the <lb/>
operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the <lb/>
far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box <reg orig="dis-|couraged">discouraged</reg>. <lb/>
Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing "Buffalo <lb/>
Gals." Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in <lb/>
Tom's eyes, before, but now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there <lb/>
was company at the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always <lb/>
there waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarreling, fighting, <reg orig="skylark-|ing">skylarking</reg>. <lb/>
And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty <lb/>
yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hour&mdash;and even <lb/>
then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:</p>
<p>"Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some."</p>
<p>Jim shook his head and said:</p>
<p>"Can't, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an' git dis water an' not <lb/>
stop foolin' roun' wid anybody. She say she spec' Mars Tom gwine to ax me to <lb/>
whitewash, an' so she tole me go 'long an' 'tend to my own business&mdash;she 'lowed <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">she'd</hi> 'tend to de whitewashin'."</p>
<p>"Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That's the way she always talks. <lb/>
Gimme the bucket&mdash;I won't be gone only a minute. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> won't ever know."</p>
<p>"Oh, I dasn't Mars Tom. Ole missis she'd take an' tar de head off'n me. <lb/>
'Deed she would."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">She!</hi> She never licks anybody&mdash;whacks 'em over the head with her thimble <lb/>
&mdash;and who cares for that, I'd like to know. She talks awful, but talk don't hurt <lb/>
&mdash;anyways it don't if she don't cry. Jim, I'll give you a marvel. I'll give you a <lb/>
white alley!"</p>
<p>Jim began to waver.</p>
<p>"White alley, Jim! And it's a bully taw."</p>
<p>"My! Dat's a mighty gay marvel, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> tell you! But Mars Tom I's powerful <lb/>
'fraid ole missis&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And besides, if you will I'll show you my sore toe."</p>
<p>Jim was only human&mdash;this attraction was too much for him. He put down his <lb/>
pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the <lb/>
<pb n="28" entity="DSSR_000002931_0043"/>
bandage was being unwound. In another moment he was flying down the street <lb/>
with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly <lb/>
was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.</p>
<figure id="f8" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0043">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">tendin' to business.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>But Tom's energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had planned <lb/>
for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys would come tripping <lb/>
along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of <lb/>
him for having to work&mdash;the very thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out <lb/>
his worldly wealth and examined it&mdash;bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to <lb/>
buy an exchange of <hi rend="italic">work,</hi> maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an <lb/>
hour of pure freedom. So he returned his straightened means to his pocket, and <lb/>
gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless moment an <lb/>
inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great, magnificent inspiration.</p>
<p>He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in sight <lb/>
presently&mdash;the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been dreading. Ben's <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="DSSR_000002931_0044"/>
gait was the hop-skip-and-jump&mdash;proof enough that his heart was light and his <lb/>
anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and giving a long, melodious whoop, <lb/>
at intervals, followed by a deep-toned ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he <lb/>
was personating a steamboat. As he drew near, he slackened speed, took the <lb/>
middle of the street, leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and <lb/>
with laborious pomp and circumstance&mdash;for he was personating the "Big Missouri," <lb/>
and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat, and captain, <lb/>
and engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own <lb/>
hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:</p>
<p>"Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!" The headway ran almost out and he drew <lb/>
up slowly toward the side-walk.</p>
<p>"Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!" His arms straightened and stiffened <lb/>
down his sides.</p>
<p>"Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-<reg orig="chow-|wow">chow-wow</reg>! <lb/>
Chow!" His right hand, meantime, describing stately circles,&mdash;for it was <lb/>
representing a forty-foot wheel.</p>
<p>"Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!" <lb/>
The left hand began to describe circles.</p>
<p>"Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labbord! Come ahead on <lb/>
the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow! Ting-a-ling-ling! <lb/>
Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! <hi rend="italic">Lively</hi> now! Come&mdash;out with your <lb/>
spring-line&mdash;what're you about there! Take a turn round that stump with the <lb/>
bight of it! Stand by that stage, now&mdash;let her go! Done with the engines, sir!</p>
<p>Ting-a-ling-ling! <hi rend="italic">Sh't! sh't! sh't!"</hi> (trying the gauge-cocks.)</p>
<p>Tom went on whitewashing&mdash;paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared a <lb/>
moment and then said:</p>
<p>"Hi-<hi rend="italic">yi! You're</hi> up a stump, ain't you!"</p>
<p>No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist; then he <lb/>
gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as before. Ben <lb/>
ranged up alongside of him. Tom's mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck <lb/>
to his work. Ben said:</p>
<p>"Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?"</p>
<p>Tom wheeled suddenly and said:</p>
<pb n="30" entity="DSSR_000002931_0045"/>
<p>"Why it's you Ben! I warn't noticing."</p>
<p>"Say&mdash;<hi rend="italic">I</hi>'m going in a swimming, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am. Don't you wish you could? But of <lb/>
course you'd druther <hi rend="italic">work</hi>&mdash;wouldn't you? Course you would!"</p>
<p>Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:</p>
<p>"What do you call work?"</p>
<p>"Why ain't <hi rend="italic">that</hi> work?"</p>
<p>Tom resumed his whitewashing, and <lb/>
answered carelessly:</p>
<p>"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it aint. <lb/>
All I know, is, it suits Tom Sawyer."</p>
<p>"Oh come, now, you don't mean to <lb/>
let on that you <hi rend="italic">like</hi> it?"</p>
<p>The brush continued to move.</p>
<p>"Like it? Well I don't see why I <lb/>
oughtn't to like it. Does a boy get a <lb/>
chance to whitewash a fence every <lb/>
day?"</p>
<figure id="f9" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0045">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">'ain't that work?</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>That put the thing in a new light. <lb/>
Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom <lb/>
swept his brush daintily back and <lb/>
forth&mdash;stepped back to note the effect <lb/>
&mdash;added a touch here and <reg orig="there&mdash;criti-|cised">there&mdash;criticised</reg> <lb/>
the effect again&mdash;Ben watching <lb/>
every move and getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed. <lb/>
Presently he said:</p>
<p>"Say, Tom, let <hi rend="italic">me</hi> whitewash a little."</p>
<p>Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:</p>
<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly's awful <lb/>
particular about this fence&mdash;right here on the street, you know&mdash;but if it was the <lb/>
back fence I wouldn't mind and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> wouldn't. Yes, she's awful particular about <lb/>
this fence; it's got to be done very careful; I reckon there ain't one boy in a <lb/>
thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it the way it's got to be done.</p>
<pb n="31" entity="DSSR_000002931_0046"/>
<p>"No&mdash;is that so? Oh come, now&mdash;lemme just try. Only just a little&mdash;I'd let <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">you</hi>, if you was me, Tom."</p>
<p>"Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly&mdash;well Jim wanted to do it, but <lb/>
she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn't let Sid. Now don't <lb/>
you see how I'm fixed? If you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen <lb/>
to it&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say&mdash;I'll give you the <lb/>
core of my apple."</p>
<p>"Well, here&mdash;. No, Ben, now don't. I'm afeard&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I'll give you <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of it!"</p>
<p>Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face but alacrity in his heart. <lb/>
And while the late steamer "Big Missouri" worked and sweated in the sun, the <lb/>
retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled his legs, munched his <lb/>
apple, and planned the slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of <reg orig="mate-|rial">material</reg>; <lb/>
boys happened along every little while; they came to jeer, but remained to <lb/>
whitewash. By the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to <lb/>
Billy Fisher for a kite, in good repair; and when <hi rend="italic">he</hi> played out, Johnny Miller <lb/>
bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with&mdash;and so on, and so on, hour <lb/>
after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a poor <reg orig="poverty-|stricken">poverty-stricken</reg> <lb/>
boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in wealth. He had beside <lb/>
the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a jews-harp, a piece of blue <lb/>
bottle-glass to look through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, <lb/>
a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, <lb/>
six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a dog-collar&mdash;but <lb/>
no dog&mdash;the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel, and a dilapidated old <lb/>
window-sash.</p>
<figure id="f10" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0046"/>
<pb n="32" entity="DSSR_000002931_0047"/>
<p>He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while&mdash;plenty of company&mdash;and the <lb/>
fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn't run out of whitewash, he <lb/>
would have bankrupted every boy in the village.</p>
<p>Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He had <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg> <lb/>
a great law of human action, without knowing it&mdash;namely, that in order to <lb/>
make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing <lb/>
difficult to attain. If he had been a great <lb/>
and wise philosopher, like the writer of this <lb/>
book, he would now have comprehended that <lb/>
Work consists of whatever a body is <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> <lb/>
to do, and that Play consists of whatever a <lb/>
body is not obliged to do. And this would <lb/>
help him to understand why constructing <lb/>
artificial flowers or performing on a <reg orig="tread-|mill">treadmill</reg> <lb/>
is work, while rolling ten-pins or <reg orig="climb-|ing">climbing</reg> <lb/>
Mont Blanc is only amusement. There <lb/>
are wealthy gentlemen in England who <lb/>
drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty <lb/>
or thirty miles on a daily line, in the <reg orig="sum-|mer">summer</reg>, <lb/>
because the privilege costs them <reg orig="con-|siderable">considerable</reg> <lb/>
money; but if they were offered <lb/>
wages for the service, that would turn it into <lb/>
work and then they would resign.</p>

<p>The boy mused a while over the substantial change which had taken place in <lb/>
his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward head-quarters to report.</p>

</figure>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Tom</hi> presented himself before Aunt <lb/>
Polly, who was sitting by an open <lb/>
window in a pleasant rearward <reg orig="apart-|ment">apartment</reg>, <lb/>
which was bed-room, <reg orig="breakfast-|room">breakfast-room</reg>, <lb/>
dining-room, and library, <reg orig="com-|bined">combined</reg>. <lb/>
The balmy summer air, the <lb/>
restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, <lb/>
and the drowsing murmur of the <lb/>
bees had had their effect, and she was <lb/>
nodding over her knitting&mdash;for she <lb/>
had no company but the cat, and it <lb/>
was asleep in her lap. Her <reg orig="specta-|cles">spectacles</reg> <lb/>
were propped up on her gray <lb/>
head for safety. She had thought <lb/>
that of course Tom had deserted <lb/>
long ago, and she wondered at <reg orig="see-|ing">seeing</reg> <lb/>
him place himself in her power <lb/>
again in this intrepid way. He said: "Mayn't I go and play now, aunt?" <lb/>
"What, a'ready? How much have you done?"</p>
<pb n="34" entity="DSSR_000002931_0049"/>
<p>"It's all done, aunt."</p>
<p>"Tom, don't lie to me&mdash;I can't bear it."</p>
<p>"I ain't, aunt; it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> all done."</p>
<p>Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for <lb/>
herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent of Tom's <lb/>
statement true. When she found the entire fence whitewashed, and not only <lb/>
whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a streak added to <lb/>
the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She said:</p>
<p>"Well, I never! There's no getting round it, you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> work when you're a <lb/>
mind to, Tom." And then she diluted the compliment by adding, "But it's <lb/>
powerful seldom you're a mind to, I'm bound to say. Well, go 'long and play; <lb/>
but mind you get back sometime in a week, or I'll tan you."</p>
<p>She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him <lb/>
into the closet and selected a choice <lb/>
apple and delivered it to him, along <lb/>
with an improving lecture upon <lb/>
the added value and flavor a treat <lb/>
took to itself when it came <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
sin through virtuous effort. <lb/>
And while she closed with a happy <lb/>
scriptural flourish, he "hooked" a <lb/>
doughnut.</p>

</figure>
<p>Then he skipped out, and saw <lb/>
Sid just starting up the outside <lb/>
stairway that led to the back rooms <lb/>
on the second floor. Clods were <lb/>
handy and the air was full of them <lb/>
in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a hail-storm; and before Aunt <lb/>
Polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue, six or <lb/>
seven clods had taken personal effect, and Tom was over the fence and gone. <lb/>
There was a gate, but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make <lb/>
use of it. His soul was at peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling <lb/>
attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble.</p>
<pb n="35" entity="DSSR_000002931_0050"/>
<p>Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the <lb/>
back of his aunt's cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach of <lb/>
capture and punishment, and hasted toward the public square of the village, <lb/>
where two "military" companies of boys had met for conflict, according to <lb/>
previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these armies, Joe Harper <lb/>
(a bosom friend,) General of the other. These two great commanders did not <lb/>
condescend to fight in person&mdash;that being better suited to the still smaller fry <lb/>
&mdash;but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders <lb/>
delivered through aides-de-camp. Tom's army won a great victory, after a <lb/>
long and hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged, <lb/>
the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon and the day for the necessary <lb/>
battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and marched away, and <lb/>
Tom turned homeward alone.</p>
<figure id="f14" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0050">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">after the battle.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new girl <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="DSSR_000002931_0051"/>
in the garden&mdash;a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow hair plaited into <lb/>
two long tails, white summer frock and embroidered pantalettes. The <reg orig="fresh-|crowned">fresh-crowned</reg> <lb/>
hero fell without firing a shot. A certain Amy Lawrence vanished <lb/>
out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind. He had thought <lb/>
he loved her to distraction, he had regarded his passion as adoration; and <lb/>
behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality. He had been months <lb/>
winning her; she had confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the <reg orig="hap-|piest">happiest</reg> <lb/>
and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one <lb/>
instant of time she had gone out of his heart <lb/>
like a casual stranger whose visit is done.</p>
<p>He worshiped this new angel with <reg orig="fur-|tive">furtive</reg> <lb/>
eye, till he saw that she had discovered <lb/>
him; then he pretended he did not know she <lb/>
was present, and began to "show off" in all <lb/>
sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win <lb/>
her admiration. He kept up this grotesque <lb/>
foolishness for some time; but by and by, <lb/>
while he was in the midst of some dangerous <lb/>
gymnastic performances, he glanced aside <lb/>
and saw that the little girl was wending <lb/>
her way toward the house. Tom came up <lb/>
to the fence and leaned on it, grieving, and <lb/>
hoping she would tarry yet a while longer. <lb/>
She halted a moment on the steps and then <lb/>
moved toward the door. Tom heaved a <lb/>
great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up, right away, <lb/>
for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared.</p>
<figure id="f15" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0051">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"showing off."</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and then <lb/>
shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg> <lb/>
something of interest going on in that direction. Presently he picked <lb/>
up a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose, with his head tilted far <lb/>
back; and as he moved from side to side, in his efforts, he edged nearer and <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="DSSR_000002931_0052"/>
nearer toward the pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes <lb/>
closed upon it, and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round <lb/>
the corner. But only for a minute&mdash;only while he could button the flower <lb/>
inside his jacket, next his heart&mdash;or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not <lb/>
much posted in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.</p>
<p>He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, "showing off," as <lb/>
before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom comforted <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
a little with the hope that she had been near some window, meantime, and <lb/>
been aware of his attentions. Finally he rode home reluctantly, with his poor <lb/>
head full of visions.</p>
<p>All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered "what <lb/>
had got into the child." He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and did <lb/>
not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his aunt"s very <lb/>
nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:</p>
<p>"Aunt, you don"t whack Sid when he takes it."</p>
<p>"Well, Sid don"t torment a body the way you do. You"d be always into that <lb/>
sugar if I warn"t watching you."</p>
<p>Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity, <lb/>
reached for the sugar-bowl&mdash;a sort of glorying over Tom which was well-nigh <lb/>
unbearable. But Sid"s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke. Tom <lb/>
was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was <lb/>
silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a word, even when his aunt <lb/>
came in, but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief; and <lb/>
then he would tell, and there would be nothing so good in the world as to see <lb/>
that pet model "catch it." He was so brim-full of exultation that he could <lb/>
hardly hold himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck <lb/>
discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles. He said to himself, <lb/>
"Now it"s coming!" And the next instant he was sprawling on the floor!</p>
<p>The potent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom cried out:</p>
<p>"Hold on, now, what "er you belting <hi rend="italic">me</hi> for?&mdash;Sid broke it!"</p>
<p>Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when <lb/>
she got her tongue again, she only said:</p>
<pb n="38" entity="DSSR_000002931_0053"/>
<p>"Umf! Well, you didn't get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some <lb/>
other audacious mischief when I wasn't around, like enough."</p>
<figure id="f16" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0053">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">not amiss.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Then her conscience reproached <lb/>
her, and she yearned to say something <lb/>
kind and loving; but she <lb/>
judged that this would be <reg orig="con-|strued">construed</reg> <lb/>
into a confession that she <lb/>
had been in the wrong, and <reg orig="disci-|pline">discipline</reg> <lb/>
forbade that. So she kept <lb/>
silence, and went about her affairs <lb/>
with a troubled heart. Tom sulked <lb/>
in a corner and exalted his woes. <lb/>
He knew that in her heart his aunt <lb/>
was on her knees to him, and he <lb/>
was morosely gratified by the <reg orig="con-|sciousness">consciousness</reg> <lb/>
of it. He would hang <lb/>
out no signals, he would take <lb/>
notice of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then, <lb/>
through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured himself <lb/>
lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little <lb/>
forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and die with that word <lb/>
unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured himself brought <lb/>
home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at rest. <lb/>
How she would throw herself upon him, and how her tears would fall like <lb/>
rain, and her lips pray God to give her back her boy and she would never, <lb/>
never abuse him any more! But he would lie there cold and white and make <lb/>
no sign&mdash;a poor little sufferer, whose griefs were at an end. He so worked <lb/>
upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams, that he had to keep <reg orig="swallow-|ing">swallowing</reg>, <lb/>
he was so like to choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which <lb/>
overflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled from the end of his <lb/>
nose. And such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could <lb/>
not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="DSSR_000002931_0054"/>
it; it was too sacred for such <reg orig="con-|tact">contact</reg>; <lb/>
and so, presently, when his <lb/>
cousin Mary danced in, all alive with <lb/>
the joy of seeing home again after <lb/>
an age-long visit of one week to the <lb/>
country, he got up and moved in <lb/>
clouds and darkness out at one door <lb/>
as she brought song and sunshine in <lb/>
at the other.</p>
<figure id="f17" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0054">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">Mary.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>He wandered far from the <reg orig="accus-|tomed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
haunts of boys, and sought <lb/>
desolate places that were in harmony <lb/>
with his spirit. A log raft in the <lb/>
river invited him, and he seated <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
on its outer edge and <reg orig="contem-|plated">contemplated</reg> <lb/>
the dreary vastness of the <lb/>
stream, wishing, the while, that he could <lb/>
only be drowned, all at once and <reg orig="uncon-|sciously">unconsciously</reg>, <lb/>
without undergoing the <reg orig="uncom-|fortable">uncomfortable</reg> <lb/>
routine devised by nature. Then <lb/>
he thought of his flower. He got it out, <lb/>
rumpled and wilted, and it mightily <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg> <lb/>
his dismal felicity. He wondered <lb/>
if <hi rend="italic">she</hi> would pity him if she knew? Would <lb/>
she cry, and wish that she had a right to <lb/>
put her arms around his neck and <reg orig="com-|fort">comfort</reg> <lb/>
him? Or would she turn coldly away <lb/>
like all the hollow world? This picture <lb/>
brought such an agony of pleasureable <lb/>
suffering that he worked it over and over <lb/>
again in his mind and set it up in new and <lb/>
varied lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing and <lb/>
departed in the darkness.</p>
<figure id="f18" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0054"/>
<pb n="40" entity="DSSR_000002931_0055"/>
<p>About half past nine or ten o'clock he <lb/>
came along the deserted street to where <lb/>
the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a <lb/>
moment; no sound fell upon his listening <lb/>
ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon <lb/>
the curtain of a second-story window. Was <lb/>
the sacred presence there? He climbed the <lb/>
fence, threaded his stealthy way through <lb/>
the plants, till he stood under that window; <lb/>
he looked up at it long, and with emotion; <lb/>
then he laid him down on the ground <lb/>
under it, disposing himself upon his back, <lb/>
with his hands clasped upon his breast and <lb/>
holding his poor wilted flower. And thus <lb/>
he would die&mdash;out in the cold world, with <lb/>
no shelter over his homeless head, no <lb/>
friendly hand to wipe the death-damps <lb/>
from his brow, no loving face to bend <lb/>
pityingly over him when the great agony <lb/>
came. And thus <hi rend="italic">she</hi> would see him when <lb/>
she looked out upon the glad morning, and <lb/>
oh! would she drop one little tear upon his <lb/>
poor, lifeless form, would she heave one <lb/>
little sigh to see a bright young life so <lb/>
rudely blighted, so untimely cut down?</p>
<p>The window went up, a maid-servant's <lb/>
discordant voice profaned the holy calm, <lb/>
and a deluge of water drenched the prone <lb/>
martyr's remains!</p>
<figure id="f19" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0055"/>
<p>The strangling hero sprang up with a <lb/>
relieving snort. There was a whiz as <lb/>
of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound as of <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="DSSR_000002931_0056"/>
shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the fence and shot <lb/>
away in the gloom.</p>
<p>Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his drenched <lb/>
garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he had any dim idea <lb/>
of making any "references to allusions," he thought better of it and held his <lb/>
peace, for there was danger in Tom's eye.</p>
<p>Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made mental <lb/>
note of the omission.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> sun rose upon a tranquil world, <lb/>
and beamed down upon the peaceful <lb/>
village like a benediction. Breakfast <lb/>
over, Aunt Polly had family worship; <lb/>
it began with a prayer built from the <lb/>
ground up of solid courses of <reg orig="Scrip-|tural">Scriptural</reg> <lb/>
quotations, welded together with <lb/>
a thin mortar of originality; and from <lb/>
the summit of this she delivered a <lb/>
grim chapter of the Mosaic Law, as <lb/>
from Sinai.</p>
<p>Then Tom girded up his loins, so to <lb/>
speak, and went to work to "get his <lb/>
verses." Sid had learned his lesson <lb/>
days before. Tom bent all his <reg orig="ener-|gies">energies</reg> <lb/>
to the memorizing of five verses, <lb/>
and he chose part of the Sermon on <lb/>
the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter. At the end of <lb/>
half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson, but no more, for his <lb/>
<pb n="43" entity="DSSR_000002931_0058"/>
mind was traversing the whole field of human thought, and his hands were busy <lb/>
with distracting recreations. Mary took his book to hear him recite, and he tried <lb/>
to find his way through the fog:</p>
<p>"Blessed are the&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Poor"&mdash;</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;poor; blessed are the poor&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>
<p>"In spirit&mdash;"</p>
<p>"In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they&mdash;they&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Theirs</hi>&mdash;"</p>
<p>"For <hi rend="italic">theirs.</hi> Blessed are the poor in spirit, for <hi rend="italic">theirs</hi> is the kingdom of heaven. <lb/>
Blessed are they that mourn, for they&mdash;they&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Sh&mdash;"</p>
<p>"For they&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>
<p>"S, H, A&mdash;"</p>
<p>"For they S, H&mdash;Oh I don't know what it is!"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Shall!</hi>"</p>
<p>"Oh, <hi rend="italic">shall!</hi> for they shall&mdash;for they shall&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;shall mourn&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;blessed <lb/>
are they that shall&mdash;they that&mdash;a&mdash;they that shall mourn, for they shall&mdash;a&mdash;shall <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">what</hi>? Why don't you tell me Mary?&mdash;what do you want to be so mean for?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I'm not teasing you. I wouldn't do <lb/>
that. You must go and learn it again. Don't you be discouraged, Tom, you'll <lb/>
manage it&mdash;and if you do, I'll give you something ever so nice. There, now, <lb/>
that's a good boy."</p>
<p>"All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is."</p>
<p>"Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it's nice, it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> nice."</p>
<p>"You bet you that's so, Mary. All right, I'll tackle it again."</p>
<p>And he did "tackle it again"&mdash;and under the double pressure of curiosity and <lb/>
prospective gain, he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a shining success. <lb/>
Mary gave him a bran-new "Barlow" knife worth twelve and a half cents; and <lb/>
the convulsion of delight that swept his system shook him to his foundations. <lb/>
True, the knife would not cut anything, but it was a "sure-enough" Barlow, and <lb/>
there was inconceivable grandeur in that&mdash;though where the western boys ever <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="DSSR_000002931_0059"/>
got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury, is an <lb/>
imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify <lb/>
the cupboard with it, and was arranging to <lb/>
begin on the bureau, when he was called off <lb/>
to dress for Sunday-School.</p>
<p>Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a <lb/>
piece of soap, and he went outside the door <lb/>
and set the basin on a little bench there; then <lb/>
he dipped the soap in the water and laid it <lb/>
down; turned up his sleeves; poured out the <lb/>
water on the ground, gently, and then entered <lb/>
the kitchen and began to wipe his face <reg orig="dili-|gently">diligently</reg> <lb/>
on the towel behind the door. But <lb/>
Mary removed the towel and said:</p>
<p>"Now ain't you ashamed, Tom. You <lb/>
mustn't be so bad. Water won't hurt you."</p>
<figure id="f22" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0059">

<p>Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin <lb/>
was refilled, and this time he stood over it <lb/>
a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath and began. When he <lb/>
entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut and groping for the towel <lb/>
with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his <lb/>
face. But when he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the <lb/>
clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and <lb/>
beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread <reg orig="down-|ward">downward</reg> <lb/>
in front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when <lb/>
she was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of color, <lb/>
and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into a <lb/>
dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately smoothed out the curls, with <lb/>
labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair close down to his head; for he held <lb/>
curls to be effeminate, and his own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary <lb/>
got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years <lb/>
&mdash;they were simply called his "other clothes"&mdash;and so by that we know the size <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="DSSR_000002931_0060"/>
of his wardrobe. The girl "put him to rights" after he had dressed himself; she <lb/>
buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down <lb/>
over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat. <lb/>
He now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable. He was fully as <reg orig="uncom-|fortable">uncomfortable</reg> <lb/>
as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole clothes and <reg orig="cleanli-|ness">cleanliness</reg> <lb/>
that galled him. He hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was <lb/>
blighted; she coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought <lb/>
them out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
he didn't want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:</p>
<p>"Please, Tom&mdash;that's a good boy."</p>
<p>So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three children <lb/>
set out for Sunday-school&mdash;a place that <lb/>
Tom hated with his whole heart; but <lb/>
Sid and Mary were fond of it.</p>
<p>Sabbath-school hours were from nine <lb/>
to half past ten; and then church <reg orig="ser-|vice">service</reg>. <lb/>
Two of of the children always <lb/>
remained for the sermon voluntarily, <lb/>
and the other always remained too&mdash; <lb/>
for stronger reasons. The church's <lb/>
high-backed, uncushioned pews would <lb/>
seat about three hundred persons; the <lb/>
edifice was but a small, plain affair, with <lb/>
a sort of pine board tree-box on top of <lb/>
it for a steeple. At the door Tom <lb/>
dropped back a step and accosted a <lb/>
Sunday-dressed comrade:</p>
<p>"Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What'll you take for her?"</p>
<p>"What'll you give?"</p>
<p>"Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook."</p>
<p>"Less see 'em."</p>

<p>Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands. <lb/>
Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some small <lb/>
trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other boys as they came, <lb/>
and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. He <lb/>
entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded <lb/>
to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, <lb/>
a grave, elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled <lb/>
a boy's hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned <lb/>
around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear him say "Ouch!" <lb/>
and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom's whole class were of a pattern <lb/>
&mdash;restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came to recite their lessons, not <lb/>
one of them knew his verses perfectly, but had to be prompted all along. However, <lb/>
they worried through, and each got his reward&mdash;in small blue tickets, each with a <lb/>
passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. <lb/>
Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets <lb/>
equalled a yellow one: for ten yellow tickets the Superintendant gave a very plainly <lb/>
bound Bible, (worth forty cents in those easy times,) to the pupil. How many of <lb/>
my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two thousand <lb/>
verses, even for a Dor&eacute; Bible? And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this <lb/>
way&mdash;it was the patient work of two years&mdash;and a boy of German parentage had <lb/>
won four or five. He once recited three thousand verses without stopping; but <lb/>
the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an <lb/>
idiot from that day forth&mdash;a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great <reg orig="occa-|sions">occasions</reg>, <lb/>
before company, the Superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always made <lb/>
this boy come out and "spread himself." Only the older pupils managed to keep <lb/>
their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible, and so <lb/>
the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the <lb/>
successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every <lb/>
scholar's heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks. <lb/>
It is possible that Tom's mental stomach had never really hungered for one of <lb/>
those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for <lb/>
the glory and the eclat that came with it.</p>
<pb n="47" entity="DSSR_000002931_0062"/>
<p>In due course the Superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with a closed <lb/>
hymn book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves, and <reg orig="com-|manded">commanded</reg> <lb/>
attention. When a Sunday-school Superintendent makes his customary <lb/>
little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of <lb/>
<figure id="f24" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0062">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">necessities.</hi></head>
</figure>
music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a <lb/>
solo at a concert&mdash;though why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the <lb/>
sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer. This Superintendent was a slim <lb/>
creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he wore a stiff <lb/>
standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points <lb/>
curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth&mdash;a fence that compelled a straight <lb/>
lookout ahead, and a turning of the whole body when a side view was required; <lb/>
his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long <lb/>
as a bank note, and had fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in <lb/>
the fashion of the day, like sleigh-runners&mdash;an effect patiently and laboriously <lb/>
<pb n="48" entity="DSSR_000002931_0063"/>
produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for <lb/>
hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mein, and very sincere and honest <lb/>
at heart; and he held sacred things and places in such reverence, and so separated <lb/>
them from worldly matters, that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice <lb/>
had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He <lb/>
began after this fashion:</p>
<p>"Now children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can <lb/>
and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There&mdash;that is it. That is <lb/>
the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one little girl who is looking <lb/>
out of the window&mdash;I am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere&mdash;perhaps up <lb/>
in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I <lb/>
want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little <lb/>
faces assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good." And so <lb/>
forth and so on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was <lb/>
of a pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.</p>
<p>The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other <lb/>
recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings and whisperings that <lb/>
extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible <lb/>
rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound ceased suddenly, with the <reg orig="sub-|sidence">subsidence</reg> <lb/>
of Mr. Walters' voice, and the conclusion of the speech was received with <lb/>
a burst of silent gratitude.</p>
<p>A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more <lb/>
or less rare&mdash;the entrance of visitors; lawyer Thatcher, accompanied by a very <lb/>
feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair; <lb/>
and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter"s wife. The lady was leading a <lb/>
child. Tom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings; <reg orig="conscience-|smitten">conscience-smitten</reg>, <lb/>
too&mdash;he could not meet Amy Lawrence"s eye, he could not brook her <lb/>
loving gaze. But when he saw this small new-comer his soul was all ablaze with <lb/>
bliss in a moment. The next moment he was "showing off" with all his might&mdash; <lb/>
cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces&mdash;in a word, using every art that seemed <lb/>
likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one alloy <lb/>
&mdash;the memory of his humiliation in this angel"s garden&mdash;and that record in sand <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="DSSR_000002931_0064"/>
was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.</p>
<p>The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr. Walters' <lb/>
speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The middle-aged <lb/>
man turned out to be a prodigious personage&mdash;no less a one than the county <lb/>
judge&mdash;altogether the most august creation these children had ever looked upon&mdash; <lb/>
and they wondered what kind of material he was made of&mdash;and they half <lb/>
wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might, too. He was from <reg orig="Con-|stantinople">Constantinople</reg>, <lb/>
twelve miles away&mdash;so he had traveled, and seen the world&mdash;these very <lb/>
eyes had looked upon the county court house&mdash;which was said to have a tin roof. <lb/>
The awe which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence <lb/>
and the ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of <lb/>
their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar with <lb/>
the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music to his <lb/>
soul to hear the whisperings:</p>
<p>"Look at him, Jim! He's a going up there. Say&mdash;look! he's a going to shake <lb/>
hands with him&mdash;he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> shaking hands with him! By jings, don't you wish you <lb/>
was Jeff?"</p>
<p>Mr. Walters fell to "showing off," with all sorts of official bustlings and activities <lb/>
giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging directions here, there, everywhere <lb/>
that he could find a target. The librarian "showed off"&mdash;running hither and <lb/>
thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that <lb/>
insect authority delights in. The young lady teachers "showed off"&mdash;bending <lb/>
sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers at <lb/>
bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers <lb/>
"showed off" with small scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine <lb/>
attention to discipline&mdash;and most of the teachers, of both sexes, found business <lb/>
up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had to be done <lb/>
over again two or three times, (with much seeming vexation.) The little girls <lb/>
"showed off" in various ways, and the little boys "showed off" with such <reg orig="dili-|gence">diligence</reg> <lb/>
that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. <lb/>
And above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all <lb/>
the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur&mdash;for he was "<reg orig="show-|ing">showing</reg> <lb/>
off," too.</p>
<pb n="50" entity="DSSR_000002931_0065"/>
<p>There was only one thing wanting, to make Mr. Walters' ecstacy complete. <lb/>
and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy. Several <lb/>
pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough&mdash;he had been around <lb/>
among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now, to have that <lb/>
German lad back again with a sound mind.</p>
<p>And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward <lb/>
with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a <lb/>
Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not expecting an <lb/>
application from this source for the next ten years. But there was no getting <lb/>
around it&mdash;here were the certified checks, and they were good for their face. <lb/>
Tom was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other elect, and <lb/>
the great news was announced from head-quarters. It was the most stunning <lb/>
surprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new <lb/>
hero up to the judicial one's altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze <lb/>
upon in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy&mdash;but those that <lb/>
suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves <lb/>
had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to Tom for the wealth <lb/>
he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges. These despised themselves, as <lb/>
being the dupes of a wily fraud, a guileful snake in the grass.</p>
<p>The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the Superintendent <lb/>
could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked somewhat of the true gush, <lb/>
for the poor fellow's instinct taught him that there was a mystery here that could <lb/>
not well bear the light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> boy had <lb/>
warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises&mdash;a dozen <lb/>
would strain his capacity, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in her <lb/>
face&mdash;but he wouldn't look. She wondered; then she was just a grain troubled; <lb/>
next a dim suspicion came and went&mdash;came again; she watched; a furtive glance <lb/>
told her worlds&mdash;and then her heart broke, and she was jealous, and angry, and <lb/>
the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most of all, (she thought.)</p>
<p>Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath would <lb/>
hardly come, his heart quaked&mdash;partly because of the awful greatness of the <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="DSSR_000002931_0066"/>
man, but mainly because he was <hi rend="italic">her</hi> parent. He would have liked to fall down <lb/>
and worship him, if it were in the dark. The Judge put his hand on Tom's head <lb/>
and called him a fine little man, and <lb/>
asked him what his name was. The <lb/>
boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:</p>
<p>"Tom."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, not Tom&mdash;it is&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Thomas."</p>
<p>"Ah, that's it. I thought there was <lb/>
more to it, maybe. That's very well. <lb/>
But you've another one I daresay, and <lb/>
you'll tell it to me, won't you?"</p>
<p>"Tell the gentlemen your other name, <lb/>
Thomas," said Walters, "and say <hi rend="italic">sir.</hi> <lb/>
&mdash;You mustn't forget your manners."</p>
<p>"Thomas Sawyer&mdash;sir."</p>
<figure id="f25" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0066">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">tom as a sunday-school hero.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"That's it! That's a good boy. Fine <lb/>
boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two <lb/>
thousand verses is a great many&mdash;very, <lb/>
very great many. And you never can be <lb/>
sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth more than <lb/>
anything there is in the world; it's what makes great men and good men; you'll <lb/>
be a great man and a good man yourself, some day, Thomas, and then you'll look <lb/>
back and say, It's all owing to the precious Sunday-school privileges of my <reg orig="boy-|hood&mdash;it's">boyhood&mdash;it's</reg> <lb/>
all owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn&mdash;it's all owing to <lb/>
the good Superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me <lb/>
a beautiful Bible&mdash;a splendid elegant Bible, to keep and have it all for my own, <lb/>
always&mdash;it's all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will say, Thomas&mdash; <lb/>
and you wouldn't take any money for those two thousand verses&mdash;no indeed you <lb/>
wouldn't. And now you wouldn't mind telling me and this lady some of the things <lb/>
you've learned&mdash;no, I know you wouldn't&mdash;for we are proud of little boys that <lb/>
learn. Now no doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples. Won't <lb/>
you tell us the names of the first two that were appointed?"</p>
<pb n="52" entity="DSSR_000002931_0067"/>
<p>Tom was tugging at a button hole and looking sheepish. He blushed, now, <lb/>
and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters' heart sank within him. He said to himself, it <lb/>
is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest question&mdash;why <hi rend="italic">did</hi> the <lb/>
Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up and say;</p>
<p>"Answer the gentleman, Thomas&mdash;don't be afraid."</p>
<p>Tom still hung fire.</p>
<p>"Now I know you'll tell <hi rend="italic">me</hi>" said the lady. "The names of the first two <lb/>
disciples were&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">David and Goliah</hi>!"</p>
<p>Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">About</hi> half-past ten the cracked <lb/>
bell of the small church began to <lb/>
ring, and presently the people <lb/>
began to gather for the morning <lb/>
sermon. The Sunday school <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg> <lb/>
distributed themselves about <lb/>
the house and occupied pews with <lb/>
their parents, so as to be under <lb/>
supervision. Aunt Polly came, <lb/>
and Tom and Sid and Mary sat <lb/>
with her&mdash;Tom being placed next <lb/>
the aisle, in order that he might <lb/>
be as far away from the open <lb/>
window and the seductive <reg orig="out-|side">outside</reg> <lb/>
summer scenes as possible. <lb/>
The crowd filed up the aisles: <lb/>
the aged and needy postmaster, <lb/>
who had seen better days; the mayor and his wife&mdash;for they had a mayor <lb/>
there, among other unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow <lb/>
<pb n="54" entity="DSSR_000002931_0069"/>
Douglass, fair, smart and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, <lb/>
her hill mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much <lb/>
the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could boast; the <lb/>
bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the new notable <lb/>
from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by a troop of lawn-clad <lb/>
and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all the young clerks in town in <lb/>
a body&mdash;for they had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane-heads, a circling <lb/>
wall of oiled and simpering admirers, till the <lb/>
last girl had run their gauntlet; and last of <lb/>
all came the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, <lb/>
taking as heedful care of his mother as if <lb/>
she were cut glass. He always brought his <lb/>
mother to church, and was the pride of all <lb/>
the matrons. The boys all hated him, he <lb/>
was so good. And besides, he had been <lb/>
"thrown up to them" so much. His white <lb/>
handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket <lb/>
behind, as usual on Sundays&mdash;accidentally.<lb/>
Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked <lb/>
upon boys who had, as snobs.</p>
<p>The congregation being fully assembled, <lb/>
now, the bell rang once more, to warn <reg orig="lag-|gards">laggards</reg> <lb/>
and stragglers, and then a solemn hush <lb/>
fell upon the church which was only broken <lb/>
by the tittering and whispering of the choir in the gallery. The choir always <lb/>
tittered and whispered all through service. There was once a church choir <lb/>
that was not ill-bred, but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great <lb/>
many years ago, and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think <lb/>
it was in some foreign country.</p>
<figure id="f28" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0069">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">the model boy.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a <lb/>
peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His voice <lb/>
began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a certain point, <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="DSSR_000002931_0070"/>
where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged <lb/>
down as if from a spring-board: <lb/>
<q>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow'ry <hi rend="italic">beds</hi> <lb/>
of ease,</l>
<l>Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro' <hi rend="italic">blood-</hi> <lb/>
-y seas?</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church "sociables" he was <lb/>
always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies would <lb/>
lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps, and "wall" their <lb/>
eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, "Words cannot express it; it is <lb/>
too beautiful, <hi rend="italic">too</hi> beautiful for this mortal earth."</p>
<figure id="f29" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0070">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">the church choir.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a <lb/>
bulletin board, and read off "notices" of meetings and societies and things till <lb/>
it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of doom&mdash;a queer custom <lb/>
which is still kept up in America, even in cities, away here in this age of <lb/>
abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is to justify a traditional custom, <lb/>
the harder it is to get rid of it.</p>
<pb n="56" entity="DSSR_000002931_0071"/>
<p>And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer, it was, and went <lb/>
into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the church; <lb/>
for the other churches of the village; for the village itself; for the county; for <lb/>
the State; for the State officers; for the United States; for the churches of the <lb/>
United States; for Congress; for the President; for the officers of the <reg orig="Govern-|ment">Government</reg>; <lb/>
for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions <lb/>
groaning under the heel of European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for <lb/>
such as have the light and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor <lb/>
ears to hear withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed <lb/>
with a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace and <lb/>
favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a grateful harvest <lb/>
of good. Amen.</p>
<p>There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down. <lb/>
The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he only <lb/>
endured it&mdash;if he even did that much. He was restive all through it; he kept <lb/>
tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously&mdash;for he was not listening, but <lb/>
he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman's regular route over it&mdash;and <lb/>
when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear detected it and his <lb/>
whole nature resented it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In <lb/>
the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him <lb/>
and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its <lb/>
head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part <lb/>
company with the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; <lb/>
scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they <lb/>
had been coat tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew <lb/>
it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom's hands itched to <lb/>
grab for it they did not dare&mdash;he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed <lb/>
if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on. But with the closing <lb/>
sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and the instant the "Amen" <lb/>
was out the fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt detected the act and made <lb/>
him let it go.</p>
<p>The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="DSSR_000002931_0072"/>
argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod&mdash;and yet <lb/>
it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the <lb/>
predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving. <lb/>
Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he always knew how many <lb/>
pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse. <lb/>
However, this time he was really interested for a little while. The minister <lb/>
made a grand and moving picture of the assembling together of the world's <lb/>
hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together <lb/>
and a little child should lead them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of <lb/>
the great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the <reg orig="conspicu-|ousness">conspicuousness</reg> <lb/>
of the principal character before the on-looking nations; his face <lb/>
lit with the thought, and he said to <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
that he wished he could be that child, <lb/>
if it was a tame lion.</p>

<p>Now he lapsed into suffering again, <lb/>
as the dry argument was resumed. <reg orig="Pres-|ently">Presently</reg> <lb/>
he bethought him of a treasure <lb/>
he had and got it out. It was a large <lb/>
black beetle with formidable jaws&mdash;a <lb/>
"pinch-bug," he called it. It was in a <lb/>
percussion-cap box. The first thing the <lb/>
beetle did was to take him by the finger. <lb/>
A natural fillip followed, the beetle went <lb/>
floundering into the aisle and lit on its <lb/>
back, and the hurt finger went into the <lb/>
boy's mouth. The beetle lay there <reg orig="work-|ing">working</reg> <lb/>
its helpless legs, unable to turn over. <lb/>
Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was <lb/>
safe out of his reach. Other people <reg orig="un-|interested">uninterested</reg> <lb/>
in the sermon, found relief in <lb/>
the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling <lb/>
along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet, weary of <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="DSSR_000002931_0073"/>
captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted <lb/>
and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around it; smelt at it from <lb/>
a safe distance; walked around it again; grew bolder, and took a closer <lb/>
smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing <lb/>
it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his <lb/>
stomach with the beetle between his paws, and continued his experiments; <lb/>
grew weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded. His head nodded, <lb/>
and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. <lb/>
There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle's head, and the beetle fell a couple <lb/>
of yards away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators <lb/>
shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and <reg orig="handker-|chiefs">handkerchiefs</reg>, <lb/>
and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish, and probably felt <lb/>
so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a craving for revenge. So <lb/>
he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it from <lb/>
every point of a circle, lighting with his fore paws within an inch of the <reg orig="crea-|ture">creature</reg>, <lb/>
making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till <lb/>
his ears flapped again. But <lb/>
he grew tired once more, <lb/>
after a while; tried to amuse <lb/>
himself with a fly but found <lb/>
no relief; followed an ant <lb/>
around, with his nose close <lb/>
to the floor, and quickly <lb/>
wearied of that; yawned, <lb/>
sighed, forgot the beetle <lb/>
entirely, and sat down on <lb/>
it! Then there was a wild <lb/>
yelp of agony and the <reg orig="poo-|dle">poodle</reg> <lb/>
went sailing up the <lb/>
aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front <lb/>
of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he <lb/>
clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till <lb/>

presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and <lb/>
the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and <lb/>
sprang into its master's lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of <lb/>
distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.</p>
<p>By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with suppressed <lb/>
laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead stand-still. The discourse was <lb/>
resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all possibility of <reg orig="impressive-|ness">impressiveness</reg> <lb/>
being at an end; for even the gravest sentiments were constantly being <lb/>
received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth, under cover of some remote <lb/>
pew-back, as if the poor parson had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a <lb/>
genuine relief to the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the <lb/>
benediction pronounced.</p>
<p>Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was <lb/>
some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety in it. He <lb/>
had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog should play with <lb/>
his pinch-bug, but he did not think it was upright in him to carry it off.</p>

</figure>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Monday</hi> morning found Tom <lb/>
Sawyer miserable. Monday morning <lb/>
always found him so&mdash;because it began <lb/>
another week's slow suffering in school. <lb/>
He generally began that day with <reg orig="wish-|ing">wishing</reg> <lb/>
he had had no intervening holiday, <lb/>
it made the going into captivity and <lb/>
fetters again so much more odious.</p>
<p>Tom lay thinking. Presently it <reg orig="oc-|curred">occurred</reg> <lb/>
to him that he wished he was <lb/>
sick; then he could stay home from <lb/>
school. Here was a vague possibility. <lb/>
He canvassed his system. No ailment <lb/>
was found, and he investigated again. <lb/>
This time he thought he could detect <lb/>
colicky symptoms, and he began to encourage them with considerable hope. But <lb/>
they soon grew feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. <lb/>
<pb n="61" entity="DSSR_000002931_0076"/>
Suddenly he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. <lb/>
This was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a "starter," as he called it, <lb/>
when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument, his aunt <lb/>
would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought he would hold the tooth in <lb/>
reserve for the present, and seek further. Nothing offered for some little time, and <lb/>
then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a <lb/>
patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the <lb/>
boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection. <lb/>
But now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed well <lb/>
worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit.</p>
<p>But Sid slept on unconscious.</p>
<p>Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.</p>
<p>No result from Sid.</p>
<p>Tom was painting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then <lb/>
swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.</p>
<p>Sid snored on.</p>
<p>Tom was aggravated. He said, "Sid, Sid!" and shook him. This course <lb/>
worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then brought <lb/>
himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom. Tom went on <lb/>
groaning. Sid said:</p>
<p>"Tom! Say, Tom!" [No response.] "Here Tom! <hi rend="italic">Tom!</hi> What is the <lb/>
matter, Tom?" And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.</p>
<p>Tom moaned out:</p>
<p>"O don't, Sid. Don't joggle me."</p>
<p>"Why what's the matter Tom? I must call auntie."</p>
<p>"No&mdash;never mind. It'll be over by and by, maybe. Don't call anybody."</p>
<p>"But I must! <hi rend="italic">Don't</hi> groan so, Tom, it's awful. How long you been this <lb/>
way?"</p>
<p>"Hours. Ouch! O don't stir so, Sid, you'll kill me."</p>
<p>"Tom, why didn't you wake me sooner? O, Tom, <hi rend="italic">don't!</hi> It makes my flesh <lb/>
crawl to hear you. Tom, what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the matter?"</p>
<p>"I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you've ever done to <lb/>
me. When I'm gone&mdash;"</p>
<pb n="62" entity="DSSR_000002931_0077"/>
<p>"O, Tom, you ain't dying are you? Don't, Tom&mdash;O, don't. Maybe&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell 'em so, Sid. And Sid, you give my <lb/>
window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that's come to town, and <lb/>
tell her&mdash;"</p>
<p>But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality, now, <lb/>
so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had gathered <lb/>
quite a genuine tone.</p>
<p>Sid flew down stairs and said:</p>
<p>"O, Aunt Polly, come! Tom's dying!"</p>
<p>"Dying!"</p>
<p>"Yes'm. Don't wait&mdash;come quick!"</p>
<p>"Rubbage! I don't believe it!"</p>
<p>But she fled up stairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels. And her <lb/>
face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the bedside she <lb/>
gasped out:</p>
<p>"You Tom! Tom, what's the matter with you?"</p>
<p>"O, auntie, I'm&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What's the matter with you&mdash;what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the matter with you, child?"</p>
<p>"O auntie, my sore toe's mortified!"</p>
<p>The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a little, <lb/>
then did both together. This restored her and she said:</p>
<p>"Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and <lb/>
climb out of this."</p>
<p>The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a little <lb/>
foolish, and he said:</p>
<p>"Aunt Polly it <hi rend="italic">seemed</hi> mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my tooth at all."</p>
<p>"Your tooth, indeed! What's the matter with your tooth?"</p>
<p>"One of them's loose, and it aches perfectly awful."</p>
<p>"There, there, now, don't begin that groaning again. Open your mouth. Well <lb/>
&mdash;your tooth <hi rend="italic">is</hi> loose, but you're not going to die about that. Mary get me a silk <lb/>
thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen."</p>
<p>Tom said:</p>
<pb n="63" entity="DSSR_000002931_0078"/>
<p>"O, please auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any more. I wish I may <lb/>
never stir if it does. Please don't, auntie. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't want to stay home from school."</p>
<p>"Oh, you don't, don't you? So all this row was because you thought you'd get <lb/>
to stay home from school and go a fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so, and you <lb/>
seem to try every way you can to break <lb/>
my old heart with your outrageousness." <lb/>
By this time the dental instruments were <lb/>
ready. The old lady made one end of the <lb/>
silk thread fast to Tom's tooth with a <lb/>
loop and tied the other to the bed-post. <lb/>
Then she seized the chunk of fire and <lb/>
suddenly thrust it almost into the boy's <lb/>
face. The tooth hung dangling by the <lb/>
bedpost, now.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">dentistry.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>But all trials bring their compensations. <lb/>
As Tom wended to school after breakfast, <lb/>
he was the envy of every boy he met <lb/>
because the gap in his upper row of teeth <lb/>
enabled him to expectorate in a new and <lb/>
admirable way. He gathered quite a <reg orig="fol-|lowing">following</reg> <lb/>
of lads interested in the exhibition; <lb/>
and one that had cut his finger and had <lb/>
been a centre of fascination and homage up to this time, now found himself <lb/>
suddenly without an adherent, and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and <lb/>
he said with a disdain which he did not feel, that it wasn't anything to spit like <lb/>
Tom Sawyer; but another boy said "Sour grapes!" and he wandered away a <reg orig="dis-|mantled">dismantled</reg> <lb/>
hero.</p>
<p>Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry Finn, <lb/>
son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all <lb/>
the mothers of the town, because he was idle, and lawless, and vulgar and bad&mdash; <lb/>
and because all their children admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden <lb/>
society, and wished they dared to be like him. Tom was like the rest of the <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="DSSR_000002931_0079"/>
respectable boys, in that he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and <lb/>
was under strict orders not to play with him. So he played with him every time <lb/>
he got a chance. Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of <reg orig="full-|grown">fullgrown</reg> <lb/>
men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat <lb/>
was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat, when he <lb/>
wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the <lb/>
back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of the trousers bagged <lb/>
low and contained nothing; the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled up.</p>
<p>Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on door-steps in fine <lb/>
weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to school or to church, <lb/>
or call any being master or obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when <lb/>
and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited him; nobody forbade him to <lb/>
fight; he could sit up as late as he pleased; <lb/>
he was always the first boy that went barefoot <lb/>
in the spring and the last to resume leather <lb/>
in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put on <lb/>
clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. <lb/>
In a word, everything that goes to make life <lb/>
precious, that boy had. So thought every <lb/>
harassed, hampered, respectable boy in St. <lb/>
Petersburgh.</p>
<figure id="f35" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0079">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">huckleberry finn.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Tom hailed the romantic outcast:</p>
<p>"Hello, Huckleberry!"</p>
<p>"Hello yourself, and see how you like it."</p>
<p>"What's that you got?"</p>
<p>"Dead cat."</p>
<p>"Lemme see him Huck. My, he's pretty<lb/>
stiff. Where'd you get him?"</p>
<p>"Bought him off'n a boy."</p>
<p>"What did you give?"</p>
<p>"I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter house."</p>
<p>"Where'd you get the blue ticket?"</p>
<pb n="65" entity="DSSR_000002931_0080"/>
<p>"Bought it off'n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick."</p>
<p>"Say&mdash;what is dead cats good for, Huck?"</p>
<p>"Good for? Cure warts with."</p>
<p>"No! Is that so? I know something that's better."</p>
<p>"I bet you don't. What is it?"</p>
<p>"Why, spunk-water."</p>
<p>"Spunk-water! I wouldn't give a dern for spunk-water."</p>
<p>"You wouldn't wouldn't you? D'you ever try it?"</p>
<p>"No, I hain't. But Bob Tanner did."</p>
<p>"Who told you so!"</p>
<p>"Why he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny told Jim <lb/>
Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the nigger told me. <lb/>
There now!"</p>
<p>"Well, what of it? They'll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I don't know <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">him.</hi> But I never see a nigger that <hi rend="italic">wouldn't</hi> lie. Shucks! Now you tell me how <lb/>
Bob Tanner done it, Huck."</p>
<p>"Why he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain water was."</p>
<p>"In the day time?"</p>
<p>"Certainly"</p>
<p>"With his face to the stump?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Least I reckon so."</p>
<p>"Did he <hi rend="italic">say</hi> anything?"</p>
<p>"I don't reckon he did. I don't know."</p>
<p>"Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool <lb/>
way as that! Why that ain't a going to do any good. You got to go all by <reg orig="your-|self">yourself</reg>, <lb/>
to the middle of the woods, where you know there's a spunk-water stump, and <lb/>
just as it's midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say: <lb/>
<q>
<l>"Barley-corn, Barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,</l>
<l>Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts."</l>
</q>
and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around <lb/>
three times and walk home without speaking to anybody. Because if you speak <lb/>
the charm's busted."</p>
<pb n="66" entity="DSSR_000002931_0081"/>
<p>"Well that sounds like a good way; but that ain't the way Bob Tanner done."</p>
<p>"No, sir, you can bet he didn't, becuz he's the wartiest boy in this town; and <lb/>
he wouldn't have a wart on him if he'd knowed how to work spunk-water. I've <lb/>
took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way Huck. I play with frogs so <lb/>
much that I've always got considerable many warfs. Sometimes I take 'em off <lb/>
with a bean."</p>
<p>"Yes, bean's good. I've done that."</p>
<p>"Have you? What's your way?"</p>
<p>"You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood, and <lb/>
then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury <lb/>
it 'bout midnight at the cross-roads in the dark of the moon, and then you burn <lb/>
up the rest of the bean. You see that piece that's got the blood on it will keep <lb/>
drawing and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the <lb/>
blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she comes."</p>
<p>"Yes that's it Huck&mdash;that's it; though when you're burying it if you say 'Down <lb/>
bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!' it's better. That's the way Jo <lb/>
Harper does, and he's been nearly to Coonville and most everywheres. But say <lb/>
&mdash;how do you cure 'em with dead cats?"</p>
<p>"Why you take your cat and go and get in the graveyard 'long about midnight <lb/>
when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it's midnight a devil <lb/>
will come, or maybe two or three, but you can't see 'em, you can only hear <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
like the wind, or maybe hear 'em talk; and when they're taking that feller <lb/>
away, you heave your cat after 'em and say 'Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, <lb/>
warts follow cat, <hi rend="italic">I</hi>'m done with ye!' That'll fetch <hi rend="italic">any</hi> wart."</p>
<p>"Sounds right. D'you ever try it, Huck?"</p>
<p>"No, but old mother Hopkins told me."</p>
<p>"Well I reckon it's so, then. Becuz they say she's a witch."</p>
<p>"Say! Why Tom I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own self. <lb/>
He come along one day, and he see she was a witching him, so he took up a rock, <lb/>
and if she hadn't dodged, he'd a got her. Well that very night he rolled off'n a <lb/>
shed wher' he was a layin drunk, and broke his arm."</p>
<p>"Why that's awful. How did he know she was a witching him."</p>
<pb n="67" entity="DSSR_000002931_0082"/>
<p>"Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy, <lb/>
they're a witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when they mumble <lb/>
they're saying the Lord's Prayer back-ards."</p>
<p>"Say, Hucky, when you going to try the <lb/>
cat?"</p>
<p>"To-night. I reckon they'll come after old <lb/>
Hoss Williams to-night."</p>
<p>"But they buried him Saturday. Didn't <lb/>
they get him Saturday night?"</p>
<p>"Why how you talk! How could their <lb/>
charms work till midnight?&mdash;and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> it's <lb/>
Sunday. Devils don't slosh around much of a <lb/>
Sunday, I don't reckon."</p>
<p>"I never thought of that. That's so. <lb/>
Lemme go with you?"</p>
<p>"Of course&mdash;if you ain't afeard."</p>
<p>"Afeard! 'Tain't likely. Will you meow?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;and you meow back, if you get a <lb/>
chance. Last time, you kep' me a meowing <lb/>
around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at <lb/>
me and says 'Dern that cat!' and so I hove a <lb/>

<p>"I won't. I couldn't meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but I'll <lb/>
meow this time. Say&mdash;what's that?"</p>
<p>"Nothing but a tick."</p>
<p>"Where'd you get him?"</p>
<p>"Out in the woods."</p>
<p>"What'll you take for him?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I don't want to sell him."</p>
<p>"All right. It's a mighty small tick, anyway."</p>
<p>"O, anybody can run a tick down that don't belong to them. I'm satisfied with <lb/>
it. It's a good enough tick for me."</p>
<pb n="68" entity="DSSR_000002931_0083"/>
<p>"Sho, there's ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of 'em if I wanted to."</p>
<p>"Well why don't you? Becuz you know mighty well you can't. This is a <lb/>
pretty early tick, I reckon. It's the first one I've seen this year."</p>
<p>"Say Huck&mdash;I'll give you my tooth for him."</p>
<p>"Less see it."</p>
<p>Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed it <lb/>
wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:</p>
<p>"Is it genuwyne?"</p>
<p>Tom lifted his lip aud showed the vacancy.</p>
<p>"Well, all right," said Huckleberry, "it's a trade."</p>
<p>Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the <reg orig="pinch-|bug's">pinchbug's</reg> <lb/>
prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than before.</p>
<p>When Tom reached the little isolated frame School-house, he strode in briskly, <lb/>
with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He hung his hat <lb/>
on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like alacrity. The master, <lb/>
throned on high in his great splint-bottom arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the <lb/>
drowsy hum of study. The interruption roused him.</p>
<p>"Thomas Sawyer!"</p>
<p>Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.</p>
<p>"Sir!"</p>
<p>"Come up here. Now sir, why are you late again, as usual?"</p>
<p>Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of yellow hair <lb/>
hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy of love; and by <lb/>
that form was <hi rend="italic">the only vacant place</hi> on the girl's side of the school-house. He <lb/>
instantly said:</p>
<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn</hi>!"</p>
<p>The master's pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of study <lb/>
ceased. The pupils wondered if this fool-hardy boy had lost his mind. The <lb/>
master said:</p>
<p>"You&mdash;you did what?"</p>
<p>"Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn."</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the words.</p>
<pb n="69" entity="DSSR_000002931_0084"/>
<p>"Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever listened to. <lb/>
No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your jacket."</p>
<p>The master's arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches notably <lb/>
diminished. Then the order followed:</p>
<p>"Now sir, go and sit with the <hi rend="italic">girls!</hi> <lb/>
And let this be a warning to you."</p>
<p>The titter that rippled around the room <lb/>
appeared to abash the boy, but in reality <lb/>
that result was caused rather more by his <lb/>
worshipful awe of his unknown idol and <lb/>
the dread pleasure that lay in his high <lb/>
good fortune. He sat down upon the end <lb/>
of the pine bench and the girl hitched <lb/>
herself away from him with a toss of her <lb/>
head. Nudges and winks and whispers <lb/>
traversed the room, but Tom sat still, <lb/>
with his arms upon the long, low desk <lb/>
before him, and seemed to study his book.</p>
<figure id="f37" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0084">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">result of tom's truthfulness.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>By and by attention ceased from him, <lb/>
and the accustomed school murmur rose <lb/>
upon the dull air once more. Presently <lb/>
the boy began to steal furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, "made a <lb/>
mouth" at him and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. <lb/>
When she cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it <lb/>
away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away, again, but with less <reg orig="ani-|mosity">animosity</reg>. <lb/>
Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it remain. Tom <lb/>
scrawled on his slate, "Please take it&mdash;I got more." The girl glanced at the <lb/>
words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw something on the slate, <lb/>
hiding his work with his left hand. For a time the girl refused to notice; but <lb/>
her human curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. <lb/>
The boy worked on, apparently unconcious. The girl made a sort of non-<reg orig="com-|mittal">committal</reg> <lb/>
attempt to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last <lb/>
she gave in and hesitatingly whispered:</p>
<pb n="70" entity="DSSR_000002931_0085"/>
<p>"Let me see it."</p>
<p>Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends to it <lb/>
and a cork-screw of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl's interest <lb/>
began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything else. When it was <lb/>
finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:</p>
<p>"It's nice&mdash;make a man."</p>
<p>The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He could <lb/>
have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical; she was satisfied <lb/>
with the monster, and whispered:</p>
<p>"It's a beautiful man&mdash;now make me coming along."</p>
<p>Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed the <lb/>
spreading fingers with a <reg orig="por-|tentous">portentous</reg> <lb/>
fan. The girl said:</p>
<p>"It's ever so nice&mdash;I wish I <lb/>
could draw."</p>
<p>"It's easy," whispered Tom, <lb/>
"I'll learn you."</p>
<p>"O, will you? When?"</p>
<p>"At noon. Do you go home <lb/>
to dinner?"</p>
<p>"I'll stay if you will."</p>
<p>"Good,&mdash;that's a whack. <lb/>
What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Becky Thatcher. What's yours? Oh, I know. It's Thomas Sawyer."</p>
<p>"That's the name they lick me by. I'm Tom when I'm good. You call me <lb/>
Tom, will you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<figure id="f38" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0085">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">tom as an artists.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from the <lb/>
girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom said:</p>
<p>"Oh it ain't anything."</p>
<p>"Yes it is."</p>
<p>"No it ain't. You don't want to see."</p>
<pb n="71" entity="DSSR_000002931_0086"/>
<p>"Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me."</p>
<p>"You'll tell."</p>
<p>"No I won't&mdash;deed and deed and double deed I won't."</p>
<p>"You won't tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?"</p>
<p>"No I won't ever tell <hi rend="italic">any</hi>body. Now let me."</p>
<p>"Oh, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> don't want to see!"</p>
<p>"Now that you treat me so, I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> see." And she put her small hand upon his <lb/>
and a little scuffle ensued, Tom <reg orig="pretend-|ing">pretending</reg> <lb/>
to resist in earnest but letting his <lb/>
hand slip by degrees till these words <lb/>
were revealed: "<hi rend="italic">I love you.</hi>"</p>
<p>"O, you bad thing!" And she hit <lb/>
his hand a smart rap but reddened and <lb/>
looked pleased, nevertheless.</p>
<p>Just at this juncture the boy felt a <lb/>
slow, fateful grip closing on his ear, and <lb/>
a steady lifting impulse. In that vise he <lb/>
was borne across the house and deposited <lb/>
in his own seat, under a peppering fire of <lb/>
giggles from the whole school. Then the <lb/>
master stood over him during a few awful <lb/>
moments, and finally moved away to his <lb/>
throne without saying a word. But <reg orig="al-|though">although</reg> <lb/>
Tom's ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.</p>

</figure>
<p>As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but the <lb/>
turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the reading class <lb/>
and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and turned lakes into <reg orig="moun-|tains">mountains</reg>, <lb/>
mountains into rivers, and rivers into continents, till chaos was come again; <lb/>
then in the spelling class, and got "turned down," by a succession of mere baby <lb/>
words till he brought up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he <lb/>
had worn with ostentation for months.</p>

</figure>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> harder Tom tried to fasten <lb/>
his mind on his book, the more his <lb/>
ideas wandered. So at last, with a <lb/>
sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It <lb/>
seemed to him that the noon recess <lb/>
would never come. The air was <lb/>
utterly dead. There was not a breath <lb/>
stirring. It was the sleepiest of <lb/>
sleepy days. The drowsing murmur <lb/>
of the five and twenty studying <lb/>
scholars, soothed the soul like the <lb/>
spell that is in the murmur of bees. <lb/>
Away off in the flaming sunshine, <lb/>
Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides <lb/>
through a shimmering veil of heat, <lb/>
tinted with the purple of distance; <lb/>
a few birds floated on lazy wing high <lb/>
in the air; no other living thing was visible but some cows, and they were <lb/>
asleep. Tom's heart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="DSSR_000002931_0088"/>
to do to pass the dreary time. His hand wandered into his pocket and his face <lb/>
lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. <lb/>
Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put <lb/>
him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that <lb/>
amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when he <lb/>
started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him <lb/>
take a new direction.</p>
<p>Tom's bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and now <lb/>
he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an instant. <lb/>
This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn friends all the <lb/>
week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a pin out of his lappel <lb/>
and began to assist in exercising the prisoner. The sport grew in interest <lb/>
momently. Soon Tom said that they were interfering with each other, and <lb/>
neither getting the fullest benefit of the tick. So he put Joe's slate on the <lb/>
desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom.</p>
<p>"Now," said he, "as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and I'll <lb/>
let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side, you're to leave <lb/>
him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over."</p>
<p>"All right, go ahead; start him up."</p>
<p>The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe harassed <lb/>
him a while, and then he got away and crossed back again. This change of <lb/>
base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing <lb/>
interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the two heads bowed <lb/>
together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all things else. At last luck <lb/>
seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The tick tried this, that, and the other <lb/>
course, and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves, but time and <lb/>
again just as he would have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom's <lb/>
fingers would be twitching to begin, Joe's pin would deftly head him off, and <lb/>
keep possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was <lb/>
too strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry <lb/>
in a moment. Said he:</p>
<p>"Tom, you let him alone."</p>
<pb n="74" entity="DSSR_000002931_0089"/>
<p>"I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe."</p>
<p>"No, sir, it ain't fair; you just let him alone."</p>
<p>"Blame it, I ain't going to stir him much."</p>
<p>"Let him alone, I tell you!"</p>
<p>"I won't!"</p>
<p>"You shall&mdash;he's on my side of the line."</p>
<p>"Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't care whose tick he is&mdash;he's on my side of the line, and you shan't <lb/>
touch him."</p>
<p>"Well I'll just bet I will, though. He's my tick and I'll do what I blame <lb/>
please with him, or die!"</p>
<p>A tremendous whack came down on Tom's shoulders, and its duplicate on <lb/>
Joe's; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from the two <lb/>
jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been too absorbed to <lb/>
notice the hush that had stolen upon the school a while before when the master <lb/>
came tip-toeing down the room and stood over them. He had contemplated a <lb/>
good part of the performance before he contributed his bit of variety to it.</p>
<p>When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered <lb/>
in her ear:</p>
<p>"Put on your bonnet and let on you're going home; and when you get to <lb/>
the corner, give the rest of 'em the slip, and turn down through the lane and <lb/>
come back. I'll go the other way and come it over 'em the same way."</p>
<p>So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with another. <lb/>
In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and when they reached <lb/>
the school they had it all to themselves. Then they sat together, with a slate <lb/>
before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil and held her hand in his, guiding <lb/>
it, and so created another surprising house. When the interest in art began to <lb/>
wane, the two fell to talking. Tom was swimming in bliss. He said:</p>
<p>"Do you love rats?"</p>
<p>"No! I hate them!"</p>
<p>"Well, I do too&mdash;<hi rend="italic">live</hi> ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your head <lb/>
with a string."</p>
<pb n="75" entity="DSSR_000002931_0090"/>
<p>"No, I don't care for rats much, anyway. What <hi rend="italic">I</hi> like is chewing-gum."</p>
<p>"O, I should say so! I wish I had some now."</p>
<p>"Do you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you must give it <lb/>
back to me."</p>
<p>That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs <lb/>
against the bench in excess of contentment.</p>
<p>"Was you ever at a circus?" said Tom.</p>
<p>"Yes, and my pa's going to take me again some time, if I'm good."</p>
<p>"I been to the circus three or four times&mdash;lots of times. Church ain't shucks <lb/>
to a circus. There's things going on at a circus all the time. I'm going to be <lb/>
a clown in a circus when I grow up."</p>
<p>"O, are you! That will be nice. They're so lovely, all spotted up."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's so. And they get slathers of money&mdash;most a dollar a day, Ben <lb/>
Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?"</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"Why, engaged to be married."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Would you like to?"</p>
<p>"I reckon so. I don't know. What is it like?"</p>
<p>"Like?" Why it ain't like anything. You only just tell a boy you won't <lb/>
ever have any body but him, ever ever <hi rend="italic">ever</hi>, and then you kiss and that's all. <lb/>
Anybody can do it."</p>
<p>"Kiss? What do you kiss for?"</p>
<p>"Why that, you know, is to&mdash;well, they always do that."</p>
<p>"Everybody?"</p>
<p>"Why yes, everybody that's in love with each other. Do you remember <lb/>
what I wrote on the slate?"</p>
<p>"Ye&mdash;yes."</p>
<p>"What was it?"</p>
<p>"I shant tell you."</p>
<p>"Shall I tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi>?"</p>
<p>"Ye&mdash;yes&mdash;but some other time."</p>
<pb n="76" entity="DSSR_000002931_0091"/>
<p>"No, now."</p>
<p>"No, not now&mdash;to-morrow."</p>
<p>"O, no, <hi rend="italic">now.</hi> Please Becky&mdash;I'll whisper it, I'll whisper it ever so easy."</p>
<p>Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about <lb/>
her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to her ear. <lb/>
And then he added:</p>
<p>"Now you whisper it to me&mdash;just the same."</p>
<p>She resisted, for a while, and then said:</p>
<p>"You turn your face away so you can't see, and then I will. But you mustn't <lb/>
ever tell anybody&mdash;<hi rend="italic">will</hi> you, Tom? Now you won't, <hi rend="italic">will</hi> you?"</p>
<p>"No, indeed indeed I won't. Now Becky."</p>
<p>He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred his <lb/>
curls and whispered, "I&mdash;love&mdash;you!"</p>
<p>Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches, <lb/>
with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little white <lb/>
apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:</p>
<p>"Now Becky, it's all done&mdash;all over but the kiss. Don't you be afraid of that <lb/>
&mdash;it aint anything at all. Please, Becky."&mdash;And he tugged at her apron and <lb/>
the hands.</p>
<p>By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing with <lb/>
the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and said:</p>
<p>"Now it's all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain't ever <lb/>
to love anybody but me, and you ain't ever to marry anybody but me, never <lb/>
never and forever. Will you?"</p>
<p>"No, I'll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I'll never marry anybody <lb/>
but you&mdash;and you ain't to ever marry anybody but me, either."</p>
<p>"Certainly. Of course. That's <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of it. And always coming to school <lb/>
or when we're going home, you're to walk with me, when there ain't anybody <lb/>
looking&mdash;and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because that's the <lb/>
way you do when you're engaged."</p>
<p>"It's so nice. I never heard of it before."</p>
<p>"Oh its ever so gay! Why me and Amy Lawrence"&mdash;</p>
<pb n="77" entity="DSSR_000002931_0092"/>
<p>The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.</p>
<p>"O, Tom! Then I ain't the first you've ever been engaged to!"</p>
<p>The child began to cry. Tom said:</p>
<p>"O don't cry, Becky, I don't care for her any more."</p>
<p>"Yes you do, Tom,&mdash;you know you do."</p>
<p>Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and <lb/>
turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with <reg orig="sooth-|ing">soothing</reg> <lb/>
words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was up, and <lb/>
he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and uneasy, for a <lb/>
while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping she would repent and <lb/>
come to find him. But she did not. Then he began to feel badly and fear that <lb/>
he was in the wrong. It was a hard <reg orig="strug-|gle">struggle</reg> <lb/>
with him to make new advances, now, <lb/>
but he nerved himself to it and entered. <lb/>
She was still standing back there in the <lb/>
corner, sobbing, with her face to the wall. <lb/>
Tom's heart smote him. He went to her <lb/>
and stood a moment, not knowing exactly <lb/>
how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:</p>
<p>"Becky, I&mdash;I don't care for anybody but <lb/>
you."</p>
<p>No reply&mdash;but sobs.</p>
<p>"Becky,"&mdash;pleadingly. "Becky, won't <lb/>
you say something?"</p>
<p>More sobs.</p>

<p>Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass <lb/>
knob from the top of an andiron, and <lb/>
passed it around her so that she could see <lb/>
it, and said:</p>
<p>"Please, Becky, won't you take it?"</p>
<p>She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over <lb/>
the hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently Becky <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="DSSR_000002931_0093"/>
began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she flew around <lb/>
to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:</p>
<p>"Tom! Come back Tom!"</p>
<p>She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions but <lb/>
silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid herself; and <lb/>
by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she had to hide her griefs <lb/>
and still her broken heart and take up the cross of a long, dreary, aching <lb/>
afternoon, with none among the strangers about her to exchange sorrows with.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Tom</hi> dodged hither and thither <lb/>
through lanes until he was well out <lb/>
of the track of returning scholars, <lb/>
and then fell into a moody jog. He <lb/>
crossed a small "branch" two or <lb/>
three times, because of a prevailing <lb/>
juvenile superstition that to cross <lb/>
water baffled pursuit. Half an hour <lb/>
later he was disappearing behind the <lb/>
Douglas mansion on the summit of <lb/>
Cardiff Hill, and the school-house <lb/>
was hardly distinguishable away off <lb/>
in the valley behind him. He entered <lb/>
a dense wood, picked his pathless <lb/>
way to the centre of it, and sat down <lb/>
on a mossy spot under a spreading <lb/>
oak. There was not even a zephyr <lb/>
stirring; the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the birds; nature <lb/>
lay in a trance that was broken by no sound but the occasional far-off <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="DSSR_000002931_0095"/>
hammering of a woodpecker, and this seemed to render the pervading silence and <lb/>
sense of loneliness the more profound. The boy's soul was steeped in <reg orig="melan-|choly">melancholy</reg>; <lb/>
his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long <lb/>
with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to <lb/>
him that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy <lb/>
Hodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie and slumber <lb/>
and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through the trees and <lb/>
caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and nothing to bother and <lb/>
grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a clean Sunday-school record he <lb/>
could be willing to go, and be done with it all. Now as to this girl. What had he <lb/>
done? Nothing. He had meant the best in the world, and been treated like a <lb/>
dog&mdash;like a very dog. She would be sorry some day&mdash;maybe when it was too <lb/>
late. Ah, if he could only die <hi rend="italic">temporarily!</hi></p>
<p>But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained shape <lb/>
long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into the concerns <lb/>
of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and disappeared mysteriously? <lb/>
What if he went away&mdash;ever so far away, into unknown countries beyond the seas <lb/>
&mdash;and never come back any more! How would she feel then! The idea of <lb/>
being a clown recurred to him now, only to fill him with disgust. For frivolity <lb/>
and jokes and spotted tights were an offense, when they intruded themselves <lb/>
upon a spirit that was exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, <lb/>
he would be a soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious. <lb/>
No&mdash;better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on the <reg orig="war-|path">warpath</reg> <lb/>
in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the Far West, and <lb/>
away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with feathers, hideous with <lb/>
paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy summer morning, with a <lb/>
blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eye-balls of all his companions with <lb/>
unappeasable envy. But no, there was something gaudier even than this. He <lb/>
would be a pirate! That was it! <hi rend="italic">Now</hi> his future lay plain before him, and <lb/>
glowing with unimaginable splendor. How his name would fill the world, and <lb/>
make people shudder! How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in <lb/>
his long, low, black-hulled racer, the "Spirit of the Storm," with his grisly flag <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="DSSR_000002931_0096"/>
flying at the fore! And at the zenith of his <lb/>
fame, how he would suddenly appear at the <lb/>
old village and stalk into church, brown and <lb/>
weather-beaten, in his black velvet doublet <lb/>
and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson <lb/>
sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his <lb/>
crime-rusted cutlass at his side, his slouch <lb/>
hat with waving plumes, his black flag <reg orig="un-|furled">unfurled</reg>, <lb/>
with the skull and cross-bones on it, <lb/>
and hear with swelling ecstasy the <reg orig="whisper-|ings">whisperings</reg>, <lb/>
"It's Tom Sawyer the Pirate!&mdash;the <lb/>
Black Avenger of the Spanish Main!"</p>
<p>Yes, it was settled; his career was <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg>. <lb/>
He would run away from home and <lb/>
enter upon it. He would start the very next <lb/>
morning. Therefore he must now begin to <lb/>
get ready. He would collect his resources <lb/>
together. He went to a rotten log near at <lb/>
hand and began to dig under one end of it <lb/>
with his Barlow knife. He soon struck <lb/>
wood that sounded hollow. He put his <lb/>
hand there and uttered this incantation <lb/>
impressively:</p>
<p>"What hasn't come here, <hi rend="italic">come!</hi> What's <lb/>
here, <hi rend="italic">stay</hi> here!"</p>
<figure id="f44" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0096">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">tom meditates.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Then he scraped away the dirt, and <reg orig="ex-|posed">exposed</reg> <lb/>
a pine shingle. He took it up and <lb/>
disclosed a shapely little treasure-house <lb/>
whose bottom and sides were of shingles. <lb/>
In it lay a marble. Tom's astonishment <lb/>
was boundless! He scratched his head <lb/>
with a perplexed air, and said:</p>
<pb n="82" entity="DSSR_000002931_0097"/>
<p>"Well, that beats anything?"</p>
<p>Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The truth <lb/>
was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and all his comrades had <lb/>
always looked upon as infallible. If you buried a marble with certain necessary <lb/>
incantations, and left it alone a fortnight, and then opened the place with the <lb/>
incantation he had just used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever <lb/>
lost had gathered themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely <lb/>
they had been separated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably <lb/>
failed. Tom's whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had <lb/>
many a time heard of this thing succeeding, but never of its failing before. It did <lb/>
not occur to him that he had tried it several times before, himself, but could <lb/>
never find the hiding places afterwards. He puzzled over the matter some time, <lb/>
and finally decided that some witch had interfered and broken the charm. He <lb/>
thought he would satisfy himself on that point; so he searched around till he <lb/>
found a small sandy spot with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid <lb/>
himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and called:</p>
<p>"Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug, <reg orig="doodle-|bug">doodlebug</reg> <lb/>
tell me what I want to know!"</p>
<p>The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a second <lb/>
and then darted under again in a fright.</p>
<p>"He dasn't tell! So it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a witch that done it. I just knowed it."</p>
<p>He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he gave up <lb/>
discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have the marble he had <lb/>
just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a patient search for it. But <lb/>
he could not find it. Now he went back to his treasure-house and carefully <lb/>
placed himself just as he had been standing when he tossed the marble away; <lb/>
then he took another marble from his pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:</p>
<p>"Brother go find your brother!"</p>
<p>He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must have <lb/>
fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last repetition was <reg orig="suc-|cessful">successful</reg>. <lb/>
The two marbles lay within a foot of each other.</p>
<p>Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green aisles of the <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="DSSR_000002931_0098"/>
forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned a suspender into a belt, <lb/>
raked away some brush behind the rotten log, disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a <lb/>
lath sword and a tin trumpet, and in a moment had seized these things and <lb/>
bounded away. bare legged, with fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a <lb/>
great elm, blew an answering blast, and then began to tip-toe and look warily out, <lb/>
this way and that. He said cautiously&mdash;to an imaginary company:</p>
<p>"Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow."</p>
<p>Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom. Tom <lb/>
called:</p>
<p>"Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?"</p>
<p>"Guy of Guisborne wants no man's pass. <lb/>
Who art thou that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Dares to hold such language," said Tom, <lb/>
prompting&mdash;for they talked "by the book," <lb/>
from memory.</p>
<p>"Who art thou that dares to hold such <lb/>
language?"</p>
<p>"I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy <lb/>
caitiff carcase soon shall know."</p>
<p>"Then art thou indeed that famous <reg orig="out-|law">outlaw</reg>? <lb/>
Right gladly will I dispute with thee <lb/>
the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!"</p>
<p>They took their lath swords, dumped their
other traps on the ground, struck a fencing <lb/>
attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, <lb/>
careful combat, "two up and two down." <lb/>
Presently Tom said:</p>
<p>"Now if you've got the hang, go it lively!"</p>
<figure id="f45" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0098">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">robin hood and his foe.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>So they "went it lively," panting and <lb/>
perspiring with the work. By and by Tom shouted:</p>
<p>"Fall! fall! Why don't you fall?"</p>
<p>"I shan't! Why don't you fall yourself? You're getting the worst of it."</p>
<pb n="84" entity="DSSR_000002931_0099"/>
<p>"Why that ain't anything. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can't fall; that ain't the way it is in the book. <lb/>
The book says 'Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy of <reg orig="Guis-|borne">Guisborne</reg>.' <lb/>
You're to turn around and let me hit you in the back."</p>
<p>There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the whack <lb/>
and fell.</p>
<p>"Now," said Joe, getting up, "You got to let me kill <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. That's fair."</p>
<p>"Why I can't do that, it ain't in the book."</p>
<p>"Well it's blamed mean,&mdash;that's all."</p>
<p>"Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's son and lam me <lb/>
with a quarter-staff; or I'll be the Sheriff of <lb/>
Nottingham and you be Robin Hood a little <lb/>
while and kill me."</p>
<p>This was satisfactory, and so these <reg orig="ad-|ventures">adventures</reg> <lb/>
were carried out. Then Tom <lb/>
became Robin Hood again, and was <reg orig="al-|lowed">allowed</reg> <lb/>
by the treacherous nun to bleed his <lb/>
strength away through his neglected wound. <lb/>
And at last Joe, representing a whole tribe <lb/>
of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly <lb/>
forth, gave his bow into his feeble hands, <lb/>
and Tom said, "Where this arrow falls, <lb/>
there bury poor Robin Hood under the <lb/>
greenwood tree." Then he shot the arrow <lb/>
and fell back and would have died but he <lb/>
lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a <lb/>
corpse.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">death of robin hood.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>The boys dressed themselves, hid their <lb/>
accoutrements, and went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and <lb/>
wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for <lb/>
their loss. They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest <lb/>
than President of the United States forever.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">At</hi> half past nine, that night, Tom <lb/>
and Sid were sent to bed, as usual. <lb/>
They said their prayers, and Sid was <lb/>
soon asleep. Tom lay awake and <lb/>
waited, in restless impatience. When <lb/>
it seemed to him that it must be nearly <lb/>
daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! <lb/>
This was despair. He would have <lb/>
tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves <reg orig="de-|manded">demanded</reg>, <lb/>
but he was afraid he might <lb/>
wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared <lb/>
up into the dark. Everything was <reg orig="dis-|mally">dismally</reg> <lb/>
still. By and by, out of the <reg orig="still-|ness">stillness</reg>, <lb/>
little, scarcely preceptible noises <lb/>
began to emphasize themselves. The <lb/>
ticking of the clock began to bring <lb/>
itself into notice. Old beams began to <lb/>
crack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad. <lb/>
A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly's chamber. And now the <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="DSSR_000002931_0101"/>
tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate, began. Next <lb/>
the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the bed's head made Tom <lb/>
shudder&mdash;it meant that somebody's days were numbered. Then the howl of a <reg orig="far-|off">far-off</reg> <lb/>
dog rose on the night air, and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter <lb/>
distance. Tom was in an agony. At last he was satisfied that time had ceased <lb/>
and eternity begun; he began to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven <lb/>
but he did not hear it. And then there came mingling with his half-formed dreams, <lb/>
a most melancholy caterwauling. The <lb/>
raising of a neighboring window <reg orig="dis-|turbed">disturbed</reg> <lb/>
him. A cry of "Scat! you devil!" <lb/>
and the crash of an empty bottle against <lb/>
the back of his aunt's woodshed brought <lb/>
him wide awake, and a single minute <lb/>
later he was dressed and out of the <lb/>
window and creeping along the roof of <lb/>
the "ell" on all fours. He "meow'd" <lb/>
with caution once or twice, as he went; <lb/>
then jumped to the roof of the <reg orig="wood-|shed">woodshed</reg> <lb/>
and thence to the ground. <reg orig="Huckle-|berry">Huckleberry</reg> <lb/>
Finn was there, with his dead cat. <lb/>
The boys moved off and disappeared in <lb/>
the gloom. At the end of half an hour <lb/>
they were wading through the tall grass <lb/>
of the graveyard.</p>
<figure id="f48" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0101">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">tom's mode of egress.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned <lb/>
western kind. It was on a hill, about a <lb/>
mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence around it, which <lb/>
leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the time, but stood upright <lb/>
nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the whole cemetery. All the old graves <lb/>
were sunken in, there was not a tombstone on the place; round-topped, <reg orig="worm-|eaten">worm-eaten</reg> <lb/>
boards staggered over the graves, leaning for support and finding none. <lb/>
"Sacred to the memory of" So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="DSSR_000002931_0102"/>
could no longer have been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had <lb/>
been light.</p>
<p>A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the spirits <lb/>
of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked little, and only <lb/>
under their breath, for the time and the place and the pervading solemnity and <lb/>
silence oppressed their spirits. They found the sharp new heap they were <lb/>
seeking, and ensconsced themselves within the protection of three great elms <lb/>
that grew in a bunch within a few feet of the grave.</p>
<p>Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of a <lb/>
distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom's reflections <lb/>
grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a whisper:</p>
<p>"Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?"</p>
<p>Huckleberry whispered:</p>
<p>"I wisht I knowed. It's awful solemn like, <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> it?"</p>
<p>"I bet it is."</p>
<p>There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter inwardly. <lb/>
Then Tom whispered:</p>
<p>"Say, Hucky&mdash;do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?"</p>
<p>"O' course he does. Least his sperrit does."</p>
<p>Tom, after a pause:</p>
<p>"I wish I'd said <hi rend="italic">Mister</hi> Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody <lb/>
calls him Hoss."</p>
<p>"A body can't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these-yer dead people, <lb/>
Tom."</p>
<p>This was a damper, and conversation died again. Presently Tom seized <lb/>
his comrade's arm and said:</p>
<p>"Sh!"</p>
<p>"What is it, Tom?" And the two clung together with beating hearts.</p>
<p>"Sh! There 'tis again! Didn't you hear it?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There! Now you hear it."</p>
<p>"Lord, Tom they're coming! They're coming, sure. What'll we do?"</p>
<pb n="88" entity="DSSR_000002931_0103"/>
<p>"I dono. Think they'll see us?"</p>
<p>"O, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn't come."</p>
<p>"O, don't be afeard. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't believe they'll bother us. We ain't doing any <lb/>
harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won't notice us at all."</p>
<p>"I'll try to, Tom, but Lord I'm all of a shiver."</p>
<p>"Listen!"</p>
<p>The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled sound <lb/>
of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.</p>
<p>"Look! See there!" whispered Tom. <lb/>
"What is it?"</p>
<p>"It's devil-fire. O, Tom, this is awful."</p>
<p>Some vague figures approached through <lb/>
the gloom, swinging an old-fashioned tin <lb/>
lantern that freckled the ground with <reg orig="innu-|merable">innumerable</reg> <lb/>
little spangles of light. Presently <lb/>
Huckleberry whispered with a shudder:</p>
<p>"It's the devils sure enough. Three of <lb/>
'em! Lordy, Tom, we're goners! Can <lb/>
you pray?"</p>
<p>"I'll try, but don't you be afeard. They <lb/>
ain't going to hurt us. Now I lay me <lb/>
down to sleep, I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Sh!"</p>
<p>"What is it, Huck?"</p>
<figure id="f49" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0103">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">tom's effort at prayer.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"They're <hi rend="italic">humans!</hi> One of 'em is, <reg orig="any-|way">anyway</reg>. <lb/>
One of 'em's old Muff Potter's voice."</p>
<p>"No&mdash;tain't so, is it?"</p>
<p>"I bet I know it. Don't you stir nor budge. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> ain't sharp enough to notice <lb/>
us. Drunk, same as usual, likely&mdash;blamed old rip!"</p>
<p>"All right, I'll keep still. Now they're stuck. Can't find it. Here they <lb/>
come again. Now they're hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They're <lb/>
p'inted right, this time. Say Huck, I know another o' them voices; it's Injun <lb/>
Joe."</p>
<pb n="89" entity="DSSR_000002931_0104"/>
<p>"That's so&mdash;that murderin' half-breed! I'd druther they was devils a dern <lb/>
sight. What kin they be up to?"</p>
<p>The whispers died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the <lb/>
grave and stood within a few feet of the boys' hiding-place."</p>
<p>"Here it is," said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern up <lb/>
and revealed the face of young Dr. Robinson.</p>
<p>Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple <lb/>
of shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open the grave. The <lb/>
doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat down with his <lb/>
back against one of the elm trees. He was so close the boys could have touched <lb/>
him.</p>
<p>"Hurry, men!" he said in a low voice; "the moon might come out at any <lb/>
moment."</p>
<p>They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was <lb/>
no noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of <lb/>
mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon the <lb/>
coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two the men had <lb/>
hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with their shovels, got <lb/>
out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The moon drifted from <lb/>
behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face. The barrow was got ready and <lb/>
the corpse placed on it, covered with a blanket, and bound to its place with <lb/>
the rope. Potter took out a large spring-knife and cut off the dangling end <lb/>
of the rope and then said:</p>
<p>"Now the cussed thing's ready, Sawbones, and you'll just out with another <lb/>
five, or here she stays."</p>
<p>"That's the talk!" said Injun Joe.</p>
<p>"Look here, what does this mean?" said the doctor. "You required your <lb/>
pay in advance, and I've paid you."</p>
<p>"Yes, and you done more than that," said Injun Joe, approaching the doctor, <lb/>
who was now standing. "Five years ago you drove me away from your <lb/>
father's kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to eat, and you <lb/>
said I warn't there for any good; and when I swore I'd get even with you if it <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="DSSR_000002931_0105"/>
took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for a vagrant. Did you think <lb/>
I'd forget? The Injun blood ain't in me for nothing. And now I've <hi rend="italic">got</hi> you, <lb/>
and you got to <hi rend="italic">settle</hi>, you know!"</p>
<p>He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time. The <lb/>
doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground. Potter <lb/>
dropped his knife, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Here, now, don't you hit my pard!" and the next moment he had grappled <lb/>
with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main, trampling <lb/>
the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe sprang to his <lb/>
feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter's knife, and went <reg orig="creep-|ing">creeping</reg>, <lb/>
catlike and stooping, round and round about the combatants, seeking an <lb/>
opportunity. All at once the doctor flung himself free, seized the heavy head <lb/>
board of Williams' grave and felled Potter to the earth with it&mdash;and in the <lb/>
same instant the half-breed saw his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in <lb/>
the young man's breast. He reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him <lb/>
with his blood, and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful <lb/>
spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.</p>
<p>Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the <lb/>
two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave a <lb/>
long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">That</hi> score is settled&mdash;damn you."</p>
<p>Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter's <lb/>
open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three&mdash;four&mdash;five <lb/>
minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed <lb/>
upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a shudder. Then <lb/>
he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and then around him, <lb/>
confusedly. His eyes met Joe's.</p>
<p>"Lord, how is this, Joe?" he said.</p>
<p>"It's a dirty business," said Joe, without moving. "What did you do it for?"</p>
<p>"I! I never done it!"</p>
<p>"Look here! That kind of talk won't wash."</p>
<p>Potter trembled and grew white.</p>
<pb n="91" entity="DSSR_000002931_0106"/>
<p>"I thought I'd got sober. I'd no business to drink to-night. But it's in my <lb/>
head yet&mdash;worse'n when we started here. I'm all in a muddle; can't recollect <lb/>
anything of it hardly. Tell me, Joe&mdash;<hi rend="italic">honest</hi>, now, old feller&mdash;did I do it? Joe, <lb/>
I never meant to&mdash;'pon my soul and honor I never meant to, Joe. Tell me how <lb/>
it was Joe. O, it's awful&mdash;and him so young and promising."</p>
<p>"Why you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the head-board <lb/>
and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering, like, and <lb/>
snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched you another awful <lb/>
clip&mdash;and here you've laid, as dead as a wedge till now."</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">muff potter outwitted.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"O, I didn't know what I was a doing. I wish I may die this minute if I <lb/>
did. It was all on account of the whisky; and the excitement, I reckon. I <lb/>
never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I've fought, but never with <reg orig="weep-|ons">weepons</reg>. <lb/>
They'll all say that. Joe, don't tell! Say you won't tell, Joe&mdash;that's a <lb/>
good feller. I always liked you Joe, and stood up for you, too. Don't you <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="DSSR_000002931_0107"/>
remember? You <hi rend="italic">won't</hi> tell, <hi rend="italic">will</hi> you Joe?" And the poor creature dropped on <lb/>
his knees before the stolid murderer, and clasped his appealing hands.</p>
<p>"No, you've always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I won't <lb/>
go back on you.&mdash;There, now, that's as fair as a man can say."</p>
<p>"O, Joe, you're an angel. I'll bless you for this the longest day I live." <lb/>
And Potter began to cry.</p>
<p>"Come, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for blubbering. <lb/>
You be off yonder way and I'll go this. Move, now, and don't leave any tracks <lb/>
behind you."</p>
<p>Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed stood <lb/>
looking after him. He muttered:</p>
<p>"If he's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had <lb/>
the look of being, he won't think of the knife till he's gone so far he'll be <lb/>
afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself&mdash;chicken-heart!"</p>
<p>Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the <reg orig="lid-|less">lidless</reg> <lb/>
coffin and the open grave were under no inspection but the moon's. The <lb/>
stillness was complete again, too.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> two boys flew on and on, <lb/>
toward the village, <reg orig="speech-|less">speechless</reg> <lb/>
with horror. They <lb/>
glanced backward over their <reg orig="shoul-|ders">shoulders</reg> <lb/>
from time to time, <reg orig="apprehen-|sively">apprehensively</reg>, <lb/>
as if they feared they might be <lb/>

breath; and as they sped by some <reg orig="out-|lying">outlying</reg> <lb/>
cottages that lay near the village, <lb/>
the barking of the aroused watch-dogs <lb/>
seemed to give wings to their feet.</p>
<p>"If we can only get to the old <lb/>
tannery, before we break down!" <lb/>
whispered Tom, in short catches <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
breaths, "I can't stand it much <lb/>
longer."</p>
<p>Huckleberry's hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed their <lb/>
eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it. They gained <lb/>
steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast they burst through the open door <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="DSSR_000002931_0109"/>
and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond. By and by <lb/>
their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:</p>
<p>"Huckleberry, what do you reckon 'll come of this?"</p>
<p>"If Dr. Robinson dies, I reckon hanging 'll come of it."</p>
<p>"Do you though?"</p>
<p>"Why I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> it, Tom."</p>
<p>Tom thought a while, then he said:</p>
<p>"Who'll tell? We?"</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? S'pose something happened and Injun Joe <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">didn't</hi> hang? Why he'd kill us some time or other, just as dead sure as we're a <lb/>
laying here."</p>
<p>"That's just what I was thinking to myself, Huck."</p>
<p>"If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he's fool enough. He's generally <lb/>
drunk enough."</p>
<p>Tom said nothing&mdash;went on thinking. Presently he whispered:</p>
<p>"Huck, Muff Potter don't <hi rend="italic">know</hi> it. How can he tell?"</p>
<p>"What's the reason he don't know it?"</p>
<p>"Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D' you reckon he <lb/>
could see anything? D' you reckon he knowed anything?"</p>
<p>"By hokey, that's so Tom!"</p>
<p>"And besides, look-a-here&mdash;maybe that whack done for <hi rend="italic">him</hi>!"</p>
<p>"No, 'taint likely Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and besides, <lb/>
he always has. Well when pap's full, you might take and belt him over the head <lb/>
with a church and you couldn't phase him. He says so, his own self. So it's the <lb/>
same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man was dead sober, I reckon maybe <lb/>
that whack might fetch him; I dono."</p>
<p>After another reflective silence, Tom said:</p>
<p>"Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?"</p>
<p>"Tom, we <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to keep mum. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> know that. That Injun devil would'nt make <lb/>
any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak 'bout this <lb/>
and they didn't hang him. Now look-a-here, Tom, less take and swear to one <lb/>
another&mdash;that's what we got to do&mdash;swear to keep mum."</p>
<pb n="95" entity="DSSR_000002931_0110"/>
<p>"I'm agreed. It's the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear that <lb/>
we&mdash;"</p>
<p>"O, no, that wouldn't do for this. That's good enough for little rubbishy <reg orig="com-|mon">common</reg> <lb/>
things&mdash;specially with gals, cuz <hi rend="italic">they</hi> go back on you anyway, and blab if they <lb/>
get in a huff&mdash;but there orter be writing 'bout a big thing like this. And blood."</p>
<p>Tom's whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful; the <lb/>
hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it. He picked <lb/>
up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moonlight, took a little fragment of "red <lb/>
keel" out of his pocket, got the moon on his work, and painfully scrawled these <lb/>
lines, emphasizing each slow down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his <lb/>
teeth, and letting up the pressure on the up-strokes:</p>
<figure id="f162" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0110">
<figDesc>Tom's handwriting</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>"Huck Finn and <lb/>

they will keep mum <lb/>
about this and they <lb/>
wish they may Drop <lb/>
down dead in their <lb/>
tracks if they ever <lb/>
tell and Rot."</p>
<pb n="96" entity="DSSR_000002931_0111"/>
<p>Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom's facility in writing, and the <lb/>
sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lappel and was going <lb/>
to prick his flesh, but Tom said:</p>
<p>"Hold on! Don't do that. A pin's brass. It might have verdigrease on it."</p>
<p>"What's verdigrease?"</p>
<p>"It's p'ison. That's what it is. You just swaller some of it once&mdash;you'll see."</p>
<p>So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked the <lb/>
ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after many squeezes, <lb/>
Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his little finger for a pen. <lb/>
Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and an F, and the oath was <lb/>
complete. They buried the shingle close to the wall, with some dismal <reg orig="ceremo-|nies">ceremonies</reg> <lb/>
and incantations, and the fetters that bound their tongues were considered <lb/>

<p>A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined <reg orig="build-|ing">building</reg>, <lb/>
now, but they did not notice it.</p>
<p>"Tom," whispered Huckleberry, "does this keep us from <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> telling&mdash;<hi rend="italic">always</hi>?"</p>
<p>"Of course it does. It don't make any difference <hi rend="italic">what</hi> happens, we got to keep <lb/>
mum. We'd drop down dead&mdash;don't <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I reckon that's so."</p>
<p>They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up a long, <lb/>
lugubrious howl just outside&mdash;within ten feet of them. The boys clasped each <lb/>
other suddenly, in an agony of fright.</p>
<p>"Which of us does he mean?" gasped Huckleberry.</p>
<p>"I dono&mdash;peep through the crack. Quick!"</p>
<p>"No, <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, Tom!"</p>
<p>"I can't&mdash;I can't <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it, Huck!"</p>
<p>"Please, Tom. There 'tis again!"</p>
<p>"O, lordy, I'm thankful!" whispered Tom. "I know his voice. It's Bull <lb/>
Harbison."<ref target="n2" n="2">*</ref>
<note id="n2" place="foot" n="2"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>If Mr. Harbison had owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of him as "Harbison's <lb/>
Bull," but a son or a dog of that name was "Bull Harbison."</p></note>
</p>
<pb n="97" entity="DSSR_000002931_0112"/>
<p>"O, that's good&mdash;I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I'd a bet <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
it was a <hi rend="italic">stray</hi> dog."</p>
<p>The dog howled again. The boys' hearts sank once more.</p>
<p>"O, my! that ain't no Bull Harbison!" whispered Huckleberry. "<hi rend="italic">Do</hi>, Tom!"</p>
<p>Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His whisper <lb/>
was hardly audible when he said:</p>
<p>"O, Huck, IT'S A STRAY DOG!"</p>
<p>"Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?"</p>
<p>"Huck, he must mean us both&mdash;we're right together."</p>
<p>"O, Tom, I reckon we're goners. I reckon there ain't no mistake 'bout where <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">I'll</hi> go to. I been so wicked."</p>
<p>"Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a feller's <lb/>
told <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I'd a tried&mdash;but no, I wouldn't, <lb/>
of course. But if ever I get off this time, I lay I'll just <hi rend="italic">waller</hi> in Sunday-schools!"</p>
<p>And Tom began to snuffle a little.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">You</hi> bad!" and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. "Consound it, Tom Sawyer, <lb/>
you're just old pie, 'longside o'what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am. O, <hi rend="italic">lordy</hi>, lordy, lordy, I wisht I only <lb/>
had half your chance."</p>
<p>Tom choked off and whispered:</p>
<p>"Look, Hucky, look! He's got his <hi rend="italic">back</hi> to us!"</p>
<p>Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.</p>
<p>"Well he has, by jingoes! Did he before?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. O, this is bully, you know. <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Now</hi> who can he mean?"</p>
<p>The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.</p>
<p>"Sh! What's that?" he whispered.</p>
<p>"Sounds like&mdash;like hogs grunting. No&mdash;it's somebody snoring, Tom."</p>
<p>"That <hi rend="italic">is</hi> it? Where 'bouts is it, Huck?"</p>
<p>"I bleeve it's down at 'tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep <lb/>
there, sometimes, 'long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts things when <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">he</hi> snores. Besides, I reckon he ain't ever coming back to this town any more."</p>
<p>The spirit of adventure rose in the boys' souls once more.</p>
<pb n="98" entity="DSSR_000002931_0113"/>
<p>"Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?"</p>
<p>"I don't like to, much. Tom, s'pose it's Injun Joe!"</p>
<p>Tom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the boys <lb/>
agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their heels if the <lb/>
snoring stopped. So they went tip-toeing stealthily down, the one behind the <lb/>
other. When they had got to within five steps of the snorer, Tom stepped on a <lb/>
stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man moaned, writhed a little, and his <lb/>
face came into the moonlight. It was Muff Potter. The boys' hearts had stood <lb/>
still, and their hopes too, when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. <lb/>
They tip-toed out, through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little <lb/>
distance to exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the <lb/>
night air again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few feet <lb/>
of where Potter was lying, and <hi rend="italic">facing</hi> Potter, with his nose pointing heavenward.</p>

<pb n="99" entity="DSSR_000002931_0114"/>
<p>"O, geeminy it's <hi rend="italic">him</hi>!" exclaimed both boys, in a breath.</p>
<p>"Say, Tom&mdash;they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller's <lb/>
house, 'bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come in and <lb/>
lit on the bannisters and sung, the very same evening; and there ain't anybody <lb/>
dead there yet."</p>
<p>"Well I know that. And suppose there ain't. Didn't Gracie Miller fall in the <lb/>
kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but she ain't <hi rend="italic">dead</hi>. And what's more, she's getting better, too."</p>
<p>"All right, you wait and see. She's a goner, just as dead sure as Muff Potter's <lb/>
a goner. That's what the niggers say, and they know all about these kind of <lb/>
things, Huck."</p>
<p>Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window, <lb/>
the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and fell asleep <lb/>
congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He was not aware that <lb/>
the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for an hour.</p>
<p>When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the <lb/>
light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not been <lb/>
called&mdash;persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled him with bodings. <lb/>
Within five minutes he was dressed and down stairs, feeling sore and drowsy. <lb/>
The family were still at table, but they had finished breakfast. There was no <lb/>
voice of rebuke; but there were averted eyes; there was a silence and an air of <lb/>
solemnity that struck a chill to the culprit's heart. He sat down and tried to seem <lb/>
gay, but it was up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into <lb/>
silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.</p>
<p>After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in the hope <lb/>
that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt wept over him and <lb/>
asked him how he could go and break her old heart so; and finally told him to go <lb/>
on, and ruin himself and bring her grey hairs with sorrow to the grave, for it was <lb/>
no use for her to try any more. This was worse than a thousand whippings, and <lb/>
Tom's heart was sorer now than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, <lb/>
promised reform over and over again and then received his dismissal, feeling that <lb/>
he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble confidence. <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="DSSR_000002931_0115"/>
He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward Sid; and so <lb/>
the latter's prompt retreat through the back gate was unnecessary. He moped to <lb/>
school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging, along with Joe Harper, for playing <lb/>
hooky the day before, with the air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes <lb/>
and wholly dead to trifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows <lb/>
on his desk and his jaws in his hands and stared at the wall with the stony stare <lb/>
of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go. His elbow was <lb/>
pressing against some hard substance. After a long time he slowly and sadly <lb/>
changed his position, and took up this object with a sigh. It was in a paper. <lb/>
He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal sigh followed, and his heart broke. <lb/>
It was his brass andiron knob!</p>
<p>This final feather broke the camel's back.</p>

</figure>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Close</hi> upon the hour of noon the <lb/>
whole village was suddenly <reg orig="electri-|fied">electrified</reg> <lb/>
with the ghastly news. No need <lb/>
of the as yet undreamed-of telegraph; <lb/>
the tale flew from man to man, from <lb/>
group to group, from house to house, <lb/>
with little less than telegraphic speed. <lb/>
Of course the schoolmaster gave <reg orig="holi-|day">holiday</reg> <lb/>
for that afternoon; the town <lb/>
would have thought strangely of him <lb/>
if he had not.</p>
<p>A gory knife had been found close <lb/>
to the murdered man, and it had been <lb/>
recognized by somebody as <reg orig="belong-|ing">belonging</reg> <lb/>
to Muff Potter&mdash;so the story ran. <lb/>
And it was said that a belated citizen <lb/>
had come upon Potter washing himself in the "branch" about one or two <lb/>
o'clock in the morning, and that Potter had at once sneaked off&mdash;suspicious <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="DSSR_000002931_0117"/>
circumstances, especially the washing, which was not a habit with Potter. <lb/>
It was also said that the town had been ransacked for this "murderer," <lb/>
(the public are not slow in the matter <lb/>
of sifting evidence and arriving at a <lb/>
verdict), but that he could not be found. <lb/>
Horsemen had departed down all the <lb/>
roads in every direction, and the Sheriff <lb/>
"was confident" that he would be <reg orig="cap-|tured">captured</reg> <lb/>
before night.</p>
<figure id="f56" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0117">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">a suspicious incident.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>All the town was drifting toward <lb/>
the graveyard. Tom's heart-break <reg orig="van-|ished">vanished</reg> <lb/>
and he joined the procession, not <lb/>
because he would not a thousand times <lb/>
rather go anywhere else, but because an <lb/>
awful, unaccountable fascination drew <lb/>
him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, <lb/>
he wormed his small body through the <lb/>
crowd and saw the dismal spectacle. <lb/>
It seemed to him an age since he was <lb/>
there before. Somebody pinched his arm. He turned, and his eyes met <lb/>
Huckleberry's. Then both looked elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody <lb/>
had noticed anything in their mutual glance. But everybody was talking, and <lb/>
intent upon the grisly spectacle before them.</p>
<p>"Poor fellow!" "Poor young fellow!" "This ought to be a lesson to <lb/>
grave-robbers!" "Muff Potter'll hang for this if they catch him!" This was <lb/>
the drift of remark; and the minister said, "It was a judgment; His hand is <lb/>
here."</p>
<p>Now Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid face of <lb/>
Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle, and voices <lb/>
shouted, "It's him! it's him! he's coming himself!"</p>
<p>"Who? Who?" from twenty voices.</p>
<p>"Muff Potter!"</p>
<pb n="103" entity="DSSR_000002931_0118"/>
<p>"Hallo, he's stopped!&mdash;Look out, he's turning! Don't let him get away!"</p>
<p>People in the branches of the trees over Tom's head, said he wasn't trying <lb/>
to get away&mdash;he only looked doubtful and perplexed.</p>
<p>"Infernal impudence!" said a bystander; "wanted to come and take a quiet <lb/>
look at his work, I reckon&mdash;didn't expect any company."</p>
<p>The crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously <reg orig="lead-|ing">leading</reg> <lb/>
Potter by the arm. The poor fellow's face was haggard, and his eyes <lb/>
showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the murdered man, <lb/>
he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands and burst into tears.</p>
<p>"I didn't do it, friends," he sobbed; "'pon my word and honor I never done it."</p>
<p>"Who's accused you?" shouted a voice.</p>
<figure id="f57" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0118">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">injun joe's two victims.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>This shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around <lb/>
him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and exclaimed:</p>
<pb n="104" entity="DSSR_000002931_0119"/>
<p>"O, Injun Joe, you promised me you'd never&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Is that your knife?" and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.</p>
<p>Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the <lb/>
ground. Then he said:</p>
<p>"Something told me 't if I didn't come back and get&mdash;" He shuddered; then <lb/>
waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, "Tell 'em, Joe, <lb/>
tell 'em&mdash;it ain't any use any more."</p>
<p>Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the <reg orig="stony-|hearted">stony-hearted</reg> <lb/>
liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every moment that the <lb/>
clear sky would deliver God's lightnings upon his head, and wondering to see <lb/>
how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had finished and still stood <lb/>
alive and whole, their wavering impulse to break their oath and save the poor <lb/>
betrayed prisoner's life faded and vanished away, for plainly this miscreant had <lb/>
sold himself to Satan and it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such <lb/>
a power as that.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you leave? What did you want to come here for?" somebody <lb/>
said.</p>
<p>"I couldn't help it&mdash;I couldn't help it," Potter moaned. "I wanted to run <lb/>
away, but I couldn't seem to come anywhere but here." And he fell to sobbing <lb/>
again.</p>
<p>Injun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes afterward on <lb/>
the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the lightnings were still <lb/>
withheld, were confirmed in their belief that Joe had sold himself to the devil. <lb/>
He was now become, to them, the most balefully interesting object they had <lb/>
ever looked upon, and they could not take their fascinated eyes from his face.</p>
<p>They inwardly resolved to watch him, nights, when opportunity should offer, <lb/>
in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.</p>
<p>Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in a <lb/>
wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering crowd that <lb/>
the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy circumstance <lb/>
would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were disappointed, for <lb/>
more than one villager remarked:</p>
<pb n="105" entity="DSSR_000002931_0120"/>
<p>"It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it."</p>
<p>Tom's fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as much <lb/>
as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:</p>
<p>"Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me <lb/>
awake about half the time."</p>
<p>Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.</p>
<p>"It's a bad sign," said Aunt Polly, gravely. "What you got on your mind, <lb/>
Tom?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. Nothing 't I know of." But the boy's hand shook so that he <lb/>
spilled his coffee.</p>
<p>"And you do talk such stuff," Sid said. "Last night you said 'it's blood, it's <lb/>
blood, that's what it is!' You said that over and over. And you said, 'Don't <lb/>
torment me so&mdash;I'll tell!' Tell <hi rend="italic">what?</hi> What is it you'll tell?"</p>
<p>Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might <lb/>
have happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly's face <lb/>
and she came to Tom's relief without knowing it. She said:</p>
<p>"Sho! It's that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night myself. <lb/>
Sometimes I dream it's me that done it."</p>
<p>Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied. <lb/>
Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after that he <lb/>
complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every night. He <lb/>
never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently slipped the bandage <lb/>
free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good while at a time, and <reg orig="after-|ward">afterward</reg> <lb/>
slipped the bandage back to its place again. Tom's distress of mind <lb/>
wore off gradually and the toothache grew irksome and was discarded. If Sid <lb/>
really managed to make anything out of Tom's disjointed mutterings, he kept <lb/>
it to himself.</p>
<p>It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding inquests <lb/>
on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind. Sid noticed <lb/>
that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries, though it had been his <lb/>
habit to take the lead in all new enterprises; he noticed, too, that Tom never <lb/>
acted as a witness,&mdash;and that was strange; and Sid did not overlook the fact <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="DSSR_000002931_0121"/>
that Tom even showed a marked aversion to these inquests, and always avoided <lb/>
them when he could. Sid marveled, but said nothing. However, even inquests <lb/>
went out of vogue at last, and ceased to torture Tom's conscience.</p>
<p>Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his opportunity <lb/>
and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such small comforts <lb/>
through to the "murderer" as he could get hold of. The jail was a trifling <lb/>
little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge of the village, and no guards <lb/>
were afforded for it; indeed it was seldom occupied. These offerings greatly <lb/>
helped to ease Tom's conscience.</p>
<p>The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride him <lb/>
on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character that nobody <lb/>
could be found who was willing to take the lead in the matter, so it was <lb/>
dropped. He had been careful to begin both of his inquest-statements with <lb/>
the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery that preceded it; therefore it <lb/>
was deemed wisest not to try the case in the courts at present.</p>

</figure>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">One</hi> of the reasons why <lb/>
Tom's mind had drifted away from <lb/>
its secret troubles was, that it had <lb/>
found a new and weighty matter to <lb/>
interest itself about. Becky Thatcher <lb/>
had stopped coming to school. Tom <lb/>
had struggled with his pride a few <lb/>
days, and tried to "whistle her down <lb/>
the wind," but failed. He began to <lb/>
find himself hanging around her <lb/>
father's house, nights, and feeling <lb/>
very miserable. She was ill. What <lb/>
if she should die! There was <reg orig="dis-|traction">distraction</reg> <lb/>
in the thought. He no <lb/>
longer took an interest in war, nor <lb/>
even in piracy. The charm of life <lb/>
was gone; there was nothing but <lb/>
dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat; there was no joy in them <lb/>
any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to try all manner of remedies <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="DSSR_000002931_0123"/>
on him. She was one of those people who are infatuated with patent medicines <lb/>
and all new-fangled methods of producing health or mending it. She was an <lb/>
inveterate experimenter in these things. When something fresh in this line came <lb/>
out she was in a fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never <lb/>
ailing, but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the <lb/>
"Health" periodicals and phreneological frauds; and the solemn ignorance they <lb/>
were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the "rot" they contained about <lb/>
ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how <lb/>
to get up, and what to eat, and what to <lb/>
drink, and how much exercise to take, and <lb/>
what frame of mind to keep one's self in, <lb/>
and what sort of clothing to wear, was all <lb/>
gospel to her, and she never observed that <lb/>
her health-journals of the current month <lb/>
customarily upset everything they had <reg orig="rec-|ommended">recommended</reg> <lb/>
the month before. She was as <lb/>
simple-hearted and honest as the day was <lb/>
long, and so she was an easy victim. She <lb/>
gathered together her quack periodicals <lb/>
and her quack medicines, and thus armed <lb/>
with death, went about on her pale horse, <lb/>
metaphorically speaking, with "hell <reg orig="follow-|ing">following</reg> <lb/>
after." But she never suspected that <lb/>
she was not an angel of healing and the <lb/>
balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering neighbors.</p>

</figure>
<p>The water treatment was new, now, and Tom's low condition was a windfall to <lb/>
her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the woodshed <lb/>
and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed him down with <lb/>
a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she rolled him up in a wet sheet <lb/>
and put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul clean and "the yellow <lb/>
stains of it came through his pores"&mdash;as Tom said.</p>
<p>Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and pale <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="DSSR_000002931_0124"/>
and dejected. She added not baths, sitz baths, shower baths and plunges. The <lb/>
boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the water with a slim <lb/>
oatmeal diet and blister plasters. She calculated his capacity as she would a jug's, <lb/>
and filled him up every day with quack cure-alls.</p>
<p>Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase filled the <lb/>
old lady's heart with consternation. This indifference must be broken up at any <lb/>
cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first time. She ordered a lot at once. <lb/>
She tasted it and was filled with gratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. <lb/>
She dropped the water treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to <lb/>
Pain-killer. She gave Tom a tea-spoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety <lb/>
for the result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again; for <lb/>
the "indifference" was broken up. The boy could not have shown a wilder, <lb/>
heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.</p>
<p>Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be romantic enough, <lb/>
in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have too little sentiment and too <lb/>
much distracting variety about it. So he thought over various plans for relief, and <lb/>
finally hit upon that of professing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so <lb/>
often that he became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
and quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings <lb/>
to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle clandestinely. <lb/>
She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it did not occur to her that <lb/>
the boy was mending the health of a crack in the sitting-room floor with it.</p>
<p>One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt's yellow cat came <lb/>
along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging for a taste. Tom said:</p>
<p>"Don't ask for it unless you want it, Peter."</p>
<p>But Peter signified that he did want it.</p>
<p>"You better make sure."</p>
<p>Peter was sure.</p>
<p>"Now you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because there ain't anything <lb/>
mean about <hi rend="italic">me</hi>; but if you find you don't like it, you musn't blame anybody but <lb/>
your own self."</p>
<p>Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down the <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="DSSR_000002931_0125"/>
Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then delivered a <lb/>
war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging against furniture, <lb/>
upsetting flower pots and making general havoc. Next he rose on his hind feet <lb/>
and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment, with his head over his shoulder and <lb/>
his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around <lb/>
the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered <lb/>
in time to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah, <lb/>
and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots with him. <lb/>
The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over her glasses; Tom lay <lb/>
on the floor expiring with laughter.</p>
<figure id="f61" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0125">

</figure>
<p>"Tom, what on earth ails that cat?"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't know, aunt," gasped the boy.</p>
<p>"Why I never see anything like it. What <hi rend="italic">did</hi> make him act so?"</p>
<p>"Deed I don't know Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they're having a <lb/>
good time."</p>
<pb n="111" entity="DSSR_000002931_0126"/>
<p>"They do, do they?" There was something in the tone that made Tom <lb/>
apprehensive.</p>
<p>"Yes'm. That is, I believe they do."</p>
<p>"You <hi rend="italic">do</hi>?"</p>
<p>"Yes'm."</p>
<p>The old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized by <lb/>
anxiety. Too late he divined her "drift." The handle of the tell-tale tea-spoon <lb/>
was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it up. Tom winced, <lb/>
and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual handle&mdash;his ear&mdash;and <lb/>
cracked his head soundly with her thimble.</p>
<p>"Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?"</p>
<p>"I done it out of pity for him&mdash;because he hadn't any aunt."</p>
<p>"Hadn't any aunt!&mdash;you numscull. What has that got to do with it?"</p>
<p>"Heaps. Because if he'd a had one she'd a burnt him out herself! She'd a <lb/>
roasted his bowels out of him 'thout any more feeling than if he was a human!"</p>
<p>Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in a new <lb/>
light; what was cruelty to a cat <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be cruelty to a boy, too. She began to <lb/>
soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she put her hand on Tom's <lb/>
head and said gently:</p>
<p>"I was meaning for the best, Tom. And Tom, it <hi rend="italic">did</hi> do you good."</p>
<p>Tom looked up in her face with just a preceptible twinkle peeping through his <lb/>
gravity:</p>
<p>"I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It done <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">him</hi> good, too. I never see him get around so since&mdash;"</p>
<p>"O, go 'long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try and <lb/>
see if you can't be a good boy, for once, and you needn't take any more medicine."</p>
<p>Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing had <lb/>
been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late, he hung about the <lb/>
gate of the school-yard instead of playing with his comrades. He was sick, he <lb/>
said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he <lb/>
really was looking&mdash;down the road. Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and <lb/>
Tom's face lighted; he gazed a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="DSSR_000002931_0127"/>
Jeff arrived, Tom accosted him, and "led up" warily to opportunities for remark <lb/>
about Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and <lb/>
watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the owner of <lb/>
it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks ceased to appear, <lb/>
and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered the empty school house <lb/>
and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed in at the gate, and Tom's <lb/>
heart gave a great bound. The next instant he was out, and "going on" like an <lb/>
Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys, jumping over the fence at risk of life and <lb/>
limb, throwing hand-springs, standing on his head&mdash;doing all the heroic things he <lb/>
could conceive of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky <lb/>
Thatcher was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never <lb/>
looked. Could it be posssble that she was not aware that he was there? He <lb/>
carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping around, snatched <lb/>
a boy's cap, hurled it to the roof of the school-house, broke through a group of <lb/>
boys, tumbling them in every direction, and fell sprawling, himself, under Becky's <lb/>
nose, almost upsetting her&mdash;and she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard <lb/>
her say. "Mf! some people think they're mighty smart&mdash;always showing off!"</p>
<p>Tom's cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and <lb/>
crestfallen.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">joe harper.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Tom's</hi> mind was made up now. <lb/>
He was gloomy and desperate. He <lb/>
was a forsaken, friendless boy, he <lb/>
said; nobody loved him; when they <lb/>
found out what they had driven him <lb/>
to, perhaps they would be sorry; he <lb/>
had tried to do right and get along, <lb/>
but they would not let him; since <lb/>
nothing would do them but to be rid <lb/>
of him, let it be so; and let them <lb/>
blame <hi rend="italic">him</hi> for the consequences&mdash; <lb/>
why shouldn't they? What right had <lb/>
the friendless to complain? Yes, <lb/>
they had forced him to it at last: <lb/>
he would lead a life of crime. There <lb/>
was no choice.</p>
<p>By this time he was far down <lb/>
Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to "take up" tinkled faintly upon his <lb/>
ear. He sobbed, now, to think he should never, never hear that old familiar <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="DSSR_000002931_0129"/>
sound any more&mdash;it was very hard, but it was forced on him; since he was <lb/>
driven out into the cold world, he must submit&mdash;but he forgave them. Then <lb/>
the sobs came thick and fast.</p>
<p>Just at this point he met his soul's sworn comrade, Joe Harper&mdash;hard-eyed, <lb/>
and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart. Plainly here were <lb/>
"two souls with but a single thought." Tom, wiping his eyes with his sleeve, <lb/>
began to blubber out something about a resolution to escape from hard usage <lb/>
and lack of sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the great world never <lb/>
to return; and ended by hoping that Joe would not forget him.</p>
<p>But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going to <lb/>
make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother had <lb/>
whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and knew <lb/>
nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished him to go; <lb/>
if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but succumb; he hoped <lb/>
she would be happy, and never regret having driven her poor boy out into the <lb/>
unfeeling world to suffer and die.</p>
<p>As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand <lb/>
by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved them of <lb/>
their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for being a hermit, <lb/>
and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying, some time, of cold, and want, <lb/>
and grief; but after listening to Tom, he conceded that there were some <reg orig="con-|spicuous">conspicuous</reg> <lb/>
advantages about a life of crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.</p>
<p>Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi river was <lb/>
a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island, with a <reg orig="shal-|low">shallow</reg> <lb/>
bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a rendezvous. It was not <lb/>
inhabited; it lay far over toward the further shore, abreast a dense and almost <lb/>
wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson's Island was chosen. Who were to be <lb/>
the subjects of their piracies, was a matter that did not occur to them. Then <lb/>
they hunted up Huckleberry Finn, and he joined them promptly, for all careers <lb/>
were one to him; he was indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a <lb/>
lonely spot on the river bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour <lb/>
&mdash;which was midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="DSSR_000002931_0130"/>
capture. Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could <lb/>
steal in the most dark and mysterious way&mdash;as became outlaws. And before the <lb/>
afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of <reg orig="spread-|ing">spreading</reg> <lb/>
the fact that pretty soon the town would "hear something." All who got <lb/>
this vague hint were cautioned to "be mum and wait."</p>
<p>About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles, and stopped <lb/>
in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the meeting-place. It was <lb/>
starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay like an ocean at rest. Tom <lb/>
listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the quiet. Then he gave a low, <lb/>
distinct whistle. It was answered from under the bluff. Tom whistled twice <lb/>
more; these signals were answered in the same way. Then a guarded voice <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Who goes there?"</p>
<p>"Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names."</p>
<p>"Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas." <lb/>
Tom had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.</p>
<p>"Tis well. Give the countersign."</p>
<p>Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the <lb/>
brooding night:</p>
<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">Blood</hi>!"</p>
<p>Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it, <lb/>
tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was an easy, <lb/>
comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked the advantages <lb/>
of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.</p>
<p>The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn <lb/>
himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a skillet <lb/>
and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought a few <reg orig="corn-|cobs">corncobs</reg> <lb/>
to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or "chewed" but <lb/>
himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it would never do to <lb/>
start without some fire. That was a wise thought; matches were hardly known <lb/>
there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred <lb/>
yards above, and they went stealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk. <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="DSSR_000002931_0131"/>
They made an imposing adventure of it, saying "Hist!" every now and then, <lb/>
and suddenly halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary <lb/>
dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal whispers that if "the foe" stirred, to <lb/>
"let him have it to the hilt," because "dead men tell no tales." They knew <lb/>
well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying in stores or <lb/>
having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their conducting this thing in <lb/>
an unpiratical way.</p>
<p>They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and Joe <lb/>
at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded arms, <lb/>
and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:</p>
<p>"Luff, and bring her to the wind!"</p>
<p>"Aye-aye, sir!"</p>
<p>"Steady, stead-y-y-y!"</p>
<p>"Steady it is, sir!"</p>
<p>"Let her go off a point!"</p>
<p>"Point it is, sir!"</p>
<p>As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream it <lb/>
was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for "style," and <lb/>
were not intended to mean anything in particular.</p>
<p>"What sail's she carrying?"</p>
<p>"Courses, tops'ls and flying-jib, sir."</p>
<p>"Send the r'yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of <reg orig="ye,&mdash;foretopmast-|stuns'l">ye,&mdash;foretopmaststuns'l</reg>! <lb/>
Lively, now!"</p>
<p>"Aye-aye, sir!"</p>
<p>"Shake out that maintogalans'l! Sheets and braces! <hi rend="italic">Now</hi>, my hearties!"</p>
<p>"Aye-aye, sir!"</p>
<p>"Hellum-a-lee&mdash;hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port, <lb/>
port! <hi rend="italic">Now</hi>, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!"</p>
<p>"Steady it is, sir!"</p>
<p>The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head <lb/>
right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was not <lb/>
more than a two or three-mile current. Hardly a word was said during the <lb/>
next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before the distant <lb/>
<pb n="117" entity="DSSR_000002931_0132"/>
town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay, peacefully <reg orig="sleep-|ing">sleeping</reg>, <lb/>
beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water, unconscious of the <lb/>
tremendous event that was happening. The Black Avenger stood still with <lb/>
folded arms, "looking his last" upon the scene of his former joys and his later <lb/>
<figure id="f64" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0132">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">on board their first prize.</hi></head>
</figure>
sufferings, and wishing "she" could see him now, abroad on the wild sea, <lb/>
facing peril and death with dauntless heart, going to his doom with a grim <lb/>
smile on his lips. It was but a small strain on his imagination to remove <reg orig="Jack-|son's">Jackson's</reg> <lb/>
Island beyond eye-shot of the village, and so he "looked his last" with <lb/>
a broken and satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; <lb/>
and they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift them <lb/>
out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in time, and <lb/>
made shift to avert it. About two o'clock in the morning the raft grounded on <lb/>
the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island, and they waded <lb/>
back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part of the little raft's <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="DSSR_000002931_0133"/>
belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they spread over a nook in the <lb/>
bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions; but they themselves would sleep <lb/>
in the open air in good weather, as became outlaws.</p>
<p>They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps within <lb/>
the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in the frying-pan <lb/>
for supper, and used up half of the <lb/>
corn "pone" stock they had brought. <lb/>
It seemed glorious sport to be feasting <lb/>
in that wild free way in the virgin <reg orig="for-|est">forest</reg> <lb/>
of an unexplored and uninhabited <lb/>
island, far from the haunts of men, and <lb/>
they said they never would return to <lb/>
civilization. The climbing fire lit up <lb/>
their faces and threw its ruddy glare <lb/>
upon the pillared tree trunks of their <lb/>
forest temple, and upon the varnished <lb/>
foliage and festooning vines.</p>
<figure id="f65" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0133">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">the pirates ashore.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>When the last crisp slice of bacon <lb/>
was gone, and the last allowance of corn <lb/>
pone devoured, the boys stretched <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
out on the grass, filled with <reg orig="con-|tentment">contentment</reg>. <lb/>
They could have found a <lb/>
cooler place, but they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as <lb/>
the roasting camp-fire.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Ain't</hi> it gay?" said Joe.</p>
<p>"It's <hi rend="italic">nuts!</hi>" said Tom. "What would the boys say if they could see us?"</p>
<p>"Say? Well they'd just die to be here&mdash;hey Hucky!"</p>
<p>"I reckon so," said Huckleberry; "anyways <hi rend="italic">I</hi>'m suited. I dont want <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg> <lb/>
better'n this. I don't ever get enough to eat, gen'ally&mdash;and here they can't <lb/>
come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so."</p>
<p>"It's just the life for me," said Tom. "You don't have to get up, mornings, <lb/>
and you don't have to go to school, and wash, and all that blame foolishness. <lb/>
You see a pirate don't have to do <hi rend="italic">anything</hi>, Joe, when he's ashore, but a hermit <lb/>
<pb n="119" entity="DSSR_000002931_0134"/>
<hi rend="italic">he</hi> has to be praying considerable, and then he don't have any fun, anyway, all <lb/>
by himself that way."</p>
<p>"O yes, that's so," said Joe, "but I hadn't thought much about it, you know. <lb/>
I'd a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I've tried it."</p>
<p>"You see," said Tom, "people don't go much on hermits, now-a-days, like <lb/>
they used to in old times, but a pirate's always respected. And a hermit's got <lb/>
to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put sack-cloth and ashes on his <lb/>
head, and stand out in the rain, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What does he put sack-cloth and ashes on his head for?" inquired Huck.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">I</hi> dono. But they've <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to do it. Hermits always do. You'd have to do <lb/>
that if you was a hermit."</p>
<p>"Dern'd if I would," said Huck.</p>
<p>"Well what would you do?"</p>
<p>"I dono. But I wouldn't do that."</p>
<p>"Why Huck, you'd <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to. How'd you get around it?"</p>
<p>"Why I just wouldn't stand it. I'd run away."</p>
<p>"Run away! Well you <hi rend="italic">would</hi> be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You'd be a <lb/>
disgrace."</p>
<p>The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished <lb/>
gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with tobacco, <lb/>
and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke <lb/>
&mdash;he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The other pirates envied <lb/>
him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly. Presently <lb/>
Huck said:</p>
<p>"What does pirates have to do?"</p>
<p>Tom said:</p>
<p>"Oh they have just a bully time&mdash;take ships, and burn them, and get the <lb/>
money and bury it in awful places in their island where there's ghosts and <lb/>
things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships&mdash;make 'em walk a plank."</p>
<p>"And they carry the women to the island," said Joe; "they don't kill the <lb/>
women."</p>
<p>"No," assented Tom, "they don't kill the women&mdash;they're too noble. And <lb/>
the women's always beautiful, too."</p>
<pb n="120" entity="DSSR_000002931_0135"/>
<p>"And don't they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh, no! All gold and silver <lb/>
and di'monds," said Joe, with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Who?" said Huck.</p>
<p>"Why the pirates."</p>
<p>Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.</p>
<p>"I reckon I ain't dressed fitten for a pirate," said he, with a regretful pathos <lb/>
in his voice; "but I ain't got none but these."</p>
<p>But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough, after <lb/>
they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand that his <lb/>
poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for wealthy pirates <lb/>
to start with a proper wardrobe.</p>
<p>Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the eyelids <lb/>
of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the Red-Handed, <lb/>
and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary. The Terror of the <lb/>
Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had more difficulty in getting <lb/>
to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly, and lying down, since there was <lb/>
nobody there with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud; in truth <lb/>
they had a mind not to say them at all, but they were afraid to proceed to such <lb/>
lengths as that, lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt <lb/>
from Heaven. Then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent <lb/>
verge of sleep&mdash;but an intruder came, now, that would not "down." It was <lb/>
conscience. They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing <lb/>
wrong to run away; and next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the <lb/>
real torture came. They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that <lb/>
they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was <lb/>
not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the end, <lb/>
that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was <lb/>
only "hooking," while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain <lb/>
simple <hi rend="italic">stealing</hi>&mdash;and there was a command against that in the Bible. So they <lb/>
inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business, their piracies <lb/>
should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing. Then conscience <lb/>
granted a truce, and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> Tom awoke in the <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>, <lb/>
he wondered where he was. He <lb/>
sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked <lb/>
around. Then he comprehended. It <lb/>
was the cool gray dawn, and there was <lb/>
a delicious sense of repose and peace <lb/>
in the deep pervading calm and silence <lb/>
of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not <lb/>
a sound obtruded upon great Nature's <lb/>
meditation. Beaded dew-drops stood <lb/>
upon the leaves and grasses. A white <lb/>
layer of ashes covered the fire, and a <lb/>
thin blue breath of smoke rose straight <lb/>
into the air. Joe and Huck still slept.</p>
<p>Now, far away in the woods a bird <lb/>
called; another answered; presently <lb/>
the hammering of a woodpecker was <lb/>
heard. Gradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened, and as gradually <lb/>
sounds multiplied and life manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="DSSR_000002931_0137"/>
sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm <lb/>
came crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air from <lb/>
time to time and "sniffing around," then proceeding again&mdash;for he was measuring, <lb/>
Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own accord, he sat as still <lb/>
as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling, by turns, as the creature still came <lb/>
toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a <lb/>
painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down <lb/>
upon Tom's leg and began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad&mdash;for that <lb/>
meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes&mdash;without the shadow of a doubt <lb/>
a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared, from nowhere in <lb/>
particular, and went about their labors; one struggled manfully by with a dead <lb/>
spider five times as big as itself in its arms, and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. <lb/>
A brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom <lb/>
bent down close to it and said, "Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house <lb/>
is on fire, your children's alone," and she took wing and went off to see about it&mdash; <lb/>
which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was credulous <lb/>
about conflagrations and he had practiced upon its simplicity more than once. A <lb/>
tumble-bug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and Tom touched the creature, <lb/>
to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead. The birds were <lb/>
fairly rioting by this time. A cat-bird, the northern mocker, lit in a tree over <lb/>
Tom's head, and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of <reg orig="enjoy-|ment">enjoyment</reg>; <lb/>
then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig <lb/>
almost within the boy's reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers <lb/>
with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the "fox" kind <lb/>
came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, <lb/>
for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely <lb/>
knew whether to be afraid or not. All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; <lb/>
long lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and <lb/>
a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.</p>
<p>Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a shout, and <lb/>
in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each other <lb/>
in the shallow limpid water of the white sand-bar. They felt no longing for the <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="DSSR_000002931_0138"/>
little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A <lb/>
vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only <lb/>
gratified them, since its going was <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
like burning the bridge between them <lb/>
and civilization.</p>
<p>They came back to camp wonderfully <lb/>
refreshed, glad-hearted, and ravenous; and <lb/>
they soon had the camp-fire blazing up <lb/>
again. Huck found a spring of clear cold <lb/>
water close by, and the boys made cups of <lb/>
broad oak or hickory leaves, and felt that <lb/>
water, sweetened with such a wild-wood <lb/>
charm as that, would be a good enough <lb/>
substitute for coffee. While Joe was slicing <lb/>
bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked <lb/>
him to hold on a minute; they stepped to <lb/>
a promising nook in the river bank and <lb/>
threw in their lines; almost immediately <lb/>
they had reward. Joe had not had time to <lb/>
get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass, a couple <lb/>
of sun-perch and a small catfish&mdash;provisions enough for quite a family. They <lb/>
fried the fish with the bacon and were astonished; for no fish had ever seemed so <lb/>
delicious before. They did not know that the quicker a fresh water fish is on the <lb/>
fire after he is caught the better he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce <lb/>
open air sleeping, open air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger <lb/>
makes, too.</p>

</figure>
<p>They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke, and then <lb/>
went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They tramped gaily <lb/>
along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush, among solemn monarchs <lb/>
of the forest, hung from their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of <lb/>
grape-vines. Now and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and <lb/>
jeweled with flowers.</p>
<pb n="124" entity="DSSR_000002931_0139"/>
<p>They found plenty of things to be delighted with but nothing to be astonished <lb/>
at. They discovered that the island was about three miles long and a quarter of <lb/>
a mile wide, and that the shore it lay <lb/>
closest to was only separated from it <lb/>
by a narrow channel hardly two hundred <lb/>
yards wide. They took a swim about <lb/>
every hour, so it was close upon the <lb/>
middle of the afternoon when they got <lb/>
back to camp. They were too hungry <lb/>
to stop to fish, but they fared <reg orig="sumptu-|ously">sumptuously</reg> <lb/>
upon cold ham, and then threw <lb/>
themselves down in the shade to talk. <lb/>
But the talk soon began to drag, and <lb/>
then died. The stillness, the solemnity <lb/>
that brooded in the woods, and the sense <lb/>
of loneliness, began to tell upon the <lb/>
spirits of the boys. They fell to <reg orig="think-|ing">thinking</reg>. <lb/>
A sort of undefined longing crept <lb/>
upon them. This took dim shape, <reg orig="pre-|sently&mdash;it">presently&mdash;it</reg> <lb/>
was budding home-sickness. Even Finn the Red-Handed was dreaming <lb/>
of his door-steps and empty hogsheads. But they were all ashamed of their <reg orig="weak-|ness">weakness</reg>, <lb/>
and none was brave enough to speak his thought.</p>

</figure>
<p>For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar sound in <lb/>
the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a clock which he takes no <lb/>
distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound became more pronounced, and <lb/>
forced a recognition. The boys started, glanced at each other, and then each <lb/>
assumed a listening attitude. There was a long silence, profound and unbroken; <lb/>
then a deep, sullen boom came floating down out of the distance.</p>
<p>"What is it!" exclaimed Joe, under his breath.</p>
<p>"I wonder," said Tom in a whisper.</p>
<p>"Tain't thunder," said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, "becuz thunder&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Hark!" said Tom. "Listen&mdash;don't talk."</p>
<pb n="125" entity="DSSR_000002931_0140"/>
<p>They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom troubled <lb/>
the solemn hush.</p>
<p>"Let's go and see."</p>
<p>They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They <lb/>
parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little steam <lb/>
ferry boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the current. Her <lb/>
broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great many skiffs rowing <lb/>
about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferry boat, but the <lb/>
boys could not determine what the men in them were doing. Presently a great <lb/>
jet of white smoke burst from the ferry boat's side, and as it expanded and rose in <lb/>
a lazy cloud, that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.</p>
<figure id="f69" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0140">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">the search for the drowned.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"I know now!" exclaimed Tom; "somebody's drownded!"</p>
<p>"That's it!" said Huck; "they done that last summer, when Bill Turner got <lb/>
drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes him come up to <lb/>
<pb n="126" entity="DSSR_000002931_0141"/>
the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put quicksilver in 'em and set 'em <lb/>
afloat, and wherever there's anybody that's drownded, they'll float right there and <lb/>
stop."</p>
<p>"Yes, I've heard about that," said Joe. "I wonder what makes the bread do that."</p>
<p>"Oh it ain't the bread, so much," said Tom; "I reckon it's mostly what they <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">say</hi> over it before they start it out."</p>
<p>"But they don't say anything over it," said Huck. "I've seen 'em and they <lb/>
don't."</p>
<p>"Well that's funny," said Tom. "But maybe they say it to themselves. Of <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">course</hi> they do. Anybody might know that."</p>
<p>The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because an <lb/>
ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not be expected to <lb/>
act very intelligently when sent upon an errand of such gravity.</p>
<p>"By jings I wish I was over there, now," said Joe.</p>
<p>"I do too," said Huck. "I'd give heaps to know who it is."</p>
<p>The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought flashed <lb/>
through Tom's mind, and he exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Boys, I know who's drownded&mdash;it's us!"</p>
<p>They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they were <lb/>
missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account; tears were <lb/>
being shed; accusing memories of unkindnesses to these poor lost lads were <lb/>
rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being indulged; and best of <lb/>
all, the departed were the talk of the whole town, and the envy of all the boys, as <lb/>
far as this dazzling notoriety was concerned. This was fine. It was worth while <lb/>
to be a pirate, after all.</p>
<p>As twilight drew on, the ferry boat went back to her accustomed business and <lb/>
the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were jubilant with <lb/>
vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble they were making. <lb/>
They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then fell to guessing at what the <lb/>
village was thinking and saying about them; and the pictures they drew of the <lb/>
public distress on their account were gratifying to look upon&mdash;from their point of <lb/>
view. But when the shadows of night closed them in, they gradually ceased to <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="DSSR_000002931_0142"/>
talk, and sat gazing into the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. <lb/>
The excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts <lb/>
of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as much as they <lb/>
were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a sigh or two escaped, <lb/>
unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a round-about "feeler" as to <lb/>
how the others might look upon a return to civilization&mdash;not right now, but&mdash;</p>
<p>Tom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted, as yet, joined in <lb/>
with Tom, and the waverer quickly "<reg orig="ex-|plained">explained</reg>," <lb/>
and was glad to get out of the <lb/>
scrape with as little taint of <reg orig="chicken-|hearted">chickenhearted</reg> <lb/>
home-sickness clinging to his <reg orig="gar-|ments">garments</reg> <lb/>
as he could. Mutiny was <reg orig="effectu-|ally">effectually</reg> <lb/>
laid to rest for the moment.</p>

</figure>
<p>As the night deepened, Huck began <lb/>
to nod, and presently to snore. Joe <lb/>
followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow <lb/>
motionless, for some time, watching the <lb/>
two intently. At last he got up <reg orig="cauti-|ously">cautiously</reg>, <lb/>
on his knees, and went searching <lb/>
among the grass and the flickering <reg orig="reflec-|tions">reflections</reg> <lb/>
flung by the camp-fire. He picked <lb/>
up and inspected several large semi-<reg orig="cylin-|ders">cylinders</reg> <lb/>
of the thin white bark of a sycamore, <lb/>
and finally chose two which seemed to suit <lb/>
him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something upon each of these <lb/>
with his "red keel;" one he rolled up and put in his jacket pocket, and the other <lb/>
he put in Joe's hat and removed it to a little distance from the owner. And he <lb/>
also put into the hat certain school-boy treasures of almost inestimable value&mdash; <lb/>
among them a lump of chalk, an India rubber ball, three fish-hooks, and one <lb/>
of that kind of marbles known as a "sure 'nough crystal." Then he tip-toed <lb/>
his way cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and <lb/>
straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sand-bar.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">A few</hi> minutes later Tom was <lb/>
in the shoal water of the bar, <lb/>
wading toward the Illinois shore. <lb/>
Before the depth reached his middle <lb/>
he was half way over; the current <lb/>
would permit no more wading, now, <lb/>
so he struck out confidently to swim <lb/>
the remaining hundred yards. He <lb/>
swam quartering up stream, but <lb/>
still was swept downward rather <lb/>
faster than he had expected. <reg orig="How-|ever">However</reg>, <lb/>
he reached the shore finally, and <lb/>
drifted along till he found a low <lb/>
place and drew himself out. He <lb/>
put his hand on his jacket pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck <lb/>
through the woods, following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="DSSR_000002931_0144"/>
before ten o'clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw <lb/>
the ferry boat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything <lb/>
was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching with <lb/>
all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes and climbed <lb/>
into the skiff that did "yawl" duty at the boat's stern. He laid himself down <lb/>
under the thwarts and waited, panting.</p>
<p>Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to "cast off." <lb/>
A minute or two later the skiff's head was standing high up, against the boat's <lb/>
swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in his success, for he knew <lb/>
it was the boat's last trip for the night. At the end of a long twelve or fifteen <lb/>
minutes the wheels stopped, and Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in <lb/>
the dusk, landing fifty yards down stream, out of danger of possible stragglers.</p>
<p>He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his aunt's <lb/>
back fence. He climbed over, approached the "ell" and looked in at the <lb/>
sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There sat Aunt Polly, Sid, <lb/>
Mary, and Joe Harper's mother, grouped together, talking. They were by the <lb/>
bed, and the bed was between them and the door. Tom went to the door and <lb/>
began to softly lift the latch; then he pressed gently and the door yielded a <lb/>
crack; he continued pushing cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, <lb/>
till he judged he might squeeze through on his knees; and so he put his head <lb/>
through and began, warily.</p>
<p>"What makes the candle blow so?" said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. <lb/>
"Why that door's open, I believe. Why of course it is. No end of strange <lb/>
things now. Go 'long and shut it, Sid."</p>
<p>Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and "breathed" <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his aunt's foot.</p>
<p>"But as I was saying," said Aunt Polly, "he warn't <hi rend="italic">bad</hi>, so to say&mdash;only <reg orig="mis-|ch">misch</reg><hi rend="italic">ee</hi>vous. <lb/>
Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn't any <lb/>
more responsible than a colt. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> never meant any harm, and he was the <reg orig="best-|hearted">best-hearted</reg> <lb/>
boy that ever was "&mdash;and she began to cry.</p>
<p>"It was just so with my Joe&mdash;always full of his devilment, and up to every <lb/>
kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he could be&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="DSSR_000002931_0145"/>
and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking that cream, <lb/>
never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because it was sour, and I <lb/>
never to see him again in this world, never, never, never, poor abused boy!" <lb/>
And Mrs Harper sobbed as if her heart would break.</p>
<p>"I hope Tom's better off where he is," said Sid, "but if he'd been better in <lb/>
some ways&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Sid</hi>!" Tom felt the glare of the old lady's eye, though he could not see it. <lb/>
"Not a word against my Tom, now that he's gone! God'll take care of <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&mdash; <lb/>
never you trouble <hi rend="italic">your</hi>self, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don't know how to give <lb/>
him up! I don't know how to give him up! He was such a comfort to me, <lb/>
although he tormented my old heart out of me, 'most."</p>

</figure>
<p>"The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away,&mdash;Blessed be the name of <lb/>
the Lord! But it's <hi rend="italic">so</hi> hard&mdash;Oh, it's so hard! Only last Saturday my Joe <lb/>
<pb n="131" entity="DSSR_000002931_0146"/>
busted a fire-cracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling. <reg orig="Lit-|tle">Little</reg> <lb/>
did I know then, how soon&mdash;O, if it was to do over again I'd hug him and <lb/>
bless him for it."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just exactly <lb/>
how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took and filled <lb/>
the cat full of Pain-Killer, and I did think the cretur would tear the house <lb/>
down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom's head with my thimble, poor boy, <lb/>
poor dead boy. But he's out of all his troubles now. And the last words I <lb/>
ever heard him say was to reproach&mdash;"</p>
<p>But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely down. <lb/>
Tom was snuffling, now, himself&mdash;and more in pity of himself than <reg orig="any-|body">anybody</reg> <lb/>
else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word for him <lb/>
from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself than ever <lb/>
before. Still he was sufficiently touched by his aunt's grief to long to rush <lb/>
out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy&mdash;and the theatrical <reg orig="gor-|geousness">gorgeousness</reg> <lb/>
of the thing appealed strongly to his nature, too, but he resisted and <lb/>
lay still.</p>
<p>He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was conjectured <lb/>
at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim; then the small <lb/>
raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing lads had promised <lb/>
that the village should "hear something" soon; the wise-heads had "put this <lb/>
and that together" and decided that the lads had gone off on that raft and <lb/>
would turn up at the next town below, presently; but toward noon the raft <lb/>
had been found, lodged against the Missouri shore some five or six miles below <lb/>
the village,&mdash;and then hope perished; they must be drowned, else hunger <lb/>
would have driven them home by nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that <lb/>
the search for the bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the <reg orig="drown-|ing">drowning</reg> <lb/>
must have occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, <lb/>
would otherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the <lb/>
bodies continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the <lb/>
funerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing good-night and turned to go. Then with a <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="DSSR_000002931_0147"/>
mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other's arms <lb/>
and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was tender far <lb/>
beyond her wont, in her good-night to Sid and Mary. Sid snuffled a bit and <lb/>
Mary went off crying with all her heart.</p>
<p>Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly, <lb/>
and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice, that <lb/>
he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.</p>
<p>He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making <reg orig="broken-|hearted">broken-hearted</reg> <lb/>
ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and turning over. <lb/>
But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her sleep. Now the boy stole <lb/>
out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the candle-light with his hand, and <lb/>
stood regarding her. His heart was full of pity for her. He took out his <reg orig="syc-|amore">sycamore</reg> <lb/>
scroll and placed it by the candle. But something occurred to him, and <lb/>
he lingered considering. His face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; <lb/>
he put the bark hastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded <lb/>
lips, and straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.</p>
<p>He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large there, <lb/>
and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was tenantless except <lb/>
that there was a watchman, who always turned in and slept like a graven image. <lb/>
He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped into it, and was soon rowing <reg orig="cau-|tiously">cautiously</reg> <lb/>
up stream. When he had pulled a mile above the village, he started <lb/>
quartering across and bent himself stoutly to his work. He hit the landing on <lb/>
the other side neatly, for this was a familiar bit of work to him. He was <lb/>
moved to capture the skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and <lb/>
therefore legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be <lb/>
made for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and <lb/>
entered the wood.</p>
<p>He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meantime to keep <lb/>
awake, and then started wearily down the home-stretch. The night was far <lb/>
spent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the island <lb/>
bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the great river <lb/>
with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream. A little later he <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="DSSR_000002931_0148"/>
paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and heard Joe say:</p>
<p>"No, Tom's true-blue, Huck, and he'll come back. He won't desert. He <lb/>
knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom's too proud for that sort <lb/>
of thing. He's up to something or other. Now I wonder what?"</p>
<p>"Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain't they?"</p>
<p>"Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain't back <lb/>
here to breakfast."</p>
<p>"Which he is!" exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping grandly <lb/>
into camp.</p>
<p>A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the <lb/>
boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures. They <lb/>
were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done. Then <lb/>
Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the other pirates <lb/>
got ready to fish and explore.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">After</hi> dinner all the gang turned <lb/>
out to hunt for turtle eggs on the <lb/>
bar. They went about poking sticks <lb/>
into the sand, and when they found <lb/>
a soft place they went down on their <lb/>
knees and dug with their hands. <lb/>
Sometimes they would take fifty or <lb/>
sixty eggs out of one hole. They <lb/>
were perfectly round white things a <lb/>
trifle smaller than an English walnut. <lb/>
They had a famous fried-egg feast <lb/>
that night, and another on Friday <lb/>
morning.</p>
<p>After breakfast they went <reg orig="whoop-|ing">whooping</reg> <lb/>
and prancing out on the bar, and <lb/>
chased each other round and round, <lb/>
shedding clothes as they went, until <lb/>
they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the <lb/>
bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their legs from under them from <lb/>
<pb n="135" entity="DSSR_000002931_0150"/>
time to time and greatly increased the fun. And now and then they stooped in a <lb/>
group and splashed water in each other's faces with their palms, gradually <lb/>
approaching each other, with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays and <lb/>
finally gripping and struggling till the <lb/>
best man ducked his neighbor, and then <lb/>
they all went under in a tangle of white <lb/>
legs and arms and came up blowing, <lb/>
sputtering, laughing and gasping for breath <lb/>
at one and the same time.</p>
<p>When they were well exhausted, they <lb/>
would run out and sprawl on the dry, hot <lb/>
sand, and lie there and cover themselves <lb/>
up with it, and by and by break for the <lb/>
water again and go through the original <lb/>
performance once more. Finally it <reg orig="oc-|curred">occurred</reg> <lb/>
to them that their naked skin <lb/>
represented flesh-colored "tights" very <lb/>
fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and <lb/>
had a circus&mdash;with three clowns in it, for <lb/>
none would yield this proudest post to <lb/>
his neighbor.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">the pirates' egg market.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Next they got their marbles and played "knucks" and "ring-taw" and "keeps" <lb/>
till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another swim, but Tom <lb/>
would not venture, because he found that in kicking off his trousers he had kicked <lb/>
his string of rattlesnake rattles off his ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped <lb/>
cramp so long without the protection of this mysterious charm. He did not <lb/>
venture again until he had found it, and by that time the other boys were tired <lb/>
and ready to rest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the "dumps," <lb/>
and fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay drowsing <lb/>
in the sun. Tom found himself writing "<hi rend="small-caps">Becky</hi>" in the sand with his big toe; <lb/>
he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his weakness. But he wrote it <lb/>
again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He erased it once more and then took <lb/>
<pb n="136" entity="DSSR_000002931_0151"/>
himself out of temptation by driving the other boys together and joining them.</p>
<p>But Joe's spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so <reg orig="home-|sick">homesick</reg> <lb/>
that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay very near the <lb/>
surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was down-hearted, but tried hard not <lb/>
to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready to tell, yet, but if this <reg orig="muti-|nous">mutinous</reg> <lb/>
depression was not broken up soon, he would have to bring it out. He said, <lb/>
with a great show of cheerfulness:</p>
<p>"I bet there's been pirates on this island before, boys. We'll explore it again. <lb/>
They've hid treasures here somewhere. How'd you feel to light on a rotten chest <lb/>
full of gold and silver&mdash;hey?"</p>
<p>But it roused only a faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply. Tom <lb/>
tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was discouraging <lb/>
work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking very gloomy. Finally <lb/>
he said:</p>
<p>"O, boys, let's give it up. I want to go home. It's so lonesome."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, Joe, you'll feel better by and by," said Tom. "Just think of the <reg orig="fish-|ing">fishing</reg> <lb/>
that's here."</p>
<p>"I don't care for fishing. I want to go home."</p>
<p>"But Joe, there ain't such another swimming place anywhere."</p>
<p>"Swimming's no good. I don't seem to care for it, somehow, when there ain't <lb/>
anybody to say I shan't go in. I mean to go home."</p>
<p>"O, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon."</p>
<p>"Yes, I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> want to see my mother&mdash;and you would too, if you had one. I ain't <lb/>
any more baby than you are." And Joe snuffled a little.</p>
<p>"Well, we'll let the cry-baby go home to his mother, <hi rend="italic">won't</hi> we Huck? Poor <lb/>
thing&mdash;does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> like it here, <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> <lb/>
you Huck? We'll stay, won't we?"</p>
<p>Huck said "Y-e-s"&mdash;without any heart in it.</p>
<p>"I'll never speak to you again as long as I live," said Joe, rising. "There <lb/>
now!" And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.</p>
<p>"Who cares!" said Tom. "Nobody wants you to. Go 'long home and get <lb/>
laughed at. O, you're a nice pirate. Huck and me ain't cry-babies. We'll stay, <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="DSSR_000002931_0152"/>
won't we Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get along without <lb/>
him, per'aps."</p>
<p>But Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly on <lb/>
with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eyeing Joe's <reg orig="prepa-|rations">preparations</reg> <lb/>
so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence. Presently, without <lb/>
a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the Illinois shore. Tom's heart began <lb/>
to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck could not bear the look, and dropped his <lb/>
eyes. Then he said:</p>
<p>"I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now it'll be <lb/>
worse. Let's us go too, Tom."</p>
<p>"I won't! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay."</p>
<p>"Tom, I better go."</p>
<p>"Well go 'long&mdash;who's hendering you."</p>
<p>Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:</p>
<p>"Tom, I wisht you'd come too. Now you think it over. We'll wait for you <lb/>
when we get to shore."</p>
<p>"Well you'll wait a blame long time, that's all."</p>
<p>Huck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a strong <lb/>
desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too. He hoped the <lb/>
boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It suddenly dawned on Tom <lb/>
that it was become very lonely and still. He made one final struggle with his <lb/>
pride, and then darted after his comrades, yelling:</p>
<p>"Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!"</p>
<p>They presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they were, <lb/>
he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till at last they saw the <lb/>
"point" he was driving at, and then they set up a war-whoop of applause and <lb/>
said it was "splendid!" and said if he had told them at first, they wouldn't have <lb/>
started away. He made a plausible excuse; but his real reason had been the <lb/>
fear that not even the secret would keep them with him any very great length of <lb/>
time, and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.</p>
<p>The lads came gaily back and went at their sports again with a will, chattering <lb/>
all the time about Tom's stupendous plan and admiring the genius of it. After a <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="DSSR_000002931_0153"/>
dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to learn to smoke, now. Joe <lb/>
caught at the idea and said he would like to try, too. So Huck made pipes and <lb/>
filled them. These novices had never smoked anything before but cigars made of <lb/>
grape-vine and they "bit" the tongue and were not considered manly, anyway.</p>
<p>Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff, charily, <lb/>
and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste, and they <lb/>
gagged a little, but Tom said:</p>
<p>"Why it's just as easy! If I'd a knowed <hi rend="italic">this</hi> was all, I'd a learnt long ago."</p>
<p>"So would I," said Joe. "It's just nothing."</p>
<p>"Why many a time I've looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish I <lb/>
could do that; but I never thought I could," said Tom.</p>
<p>"That's just the way with me, hain't it Huck? You've heard me talk just that <lb/>
way&mdash;haven't you Huck? I'll leave it to Huck if I haven't."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;heaps of times," said Huck.</p>
<p>"Well I have too," said Tom; "O, hundreds of times. Once down by the <lb/>
slaughter-house. Don't you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and <lb/>
Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don't you remember Huck, <lb/>
'bout me saying that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's so," said Huck. "That was the day after I lost a white alley. <lb/>
No, 'twas the day before."</p>
<p>"There&mdash;I told you so," said Tom. "Huck recollects it."</p>
<p>"I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day," said Joe. "<hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't feel sick.'</p>
<p>"Neither do I," said Tom. "<hi rend="italic">I</hi> could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff <lb/>
Thatcher couldn't."</p>
<p>"Jeff Thatcher! Why he'd keel over just with two draws. Just let him try it <lb/>
once. <hi rend="italic">He'd</hi> see!"</p>
<p>"I bet he would. And Johnny Miller&mdash;I wish I could see Johnny Miller <lb/>
tackle it once."</p>
<p>"O, dont <hi rend="italic">I!</hi>" said Joe, "Why I bet you Johnny Miller couldn't any more do <lb/>
this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch <hi rend="italic">him."</hi></p>
<p>" 'Deed it would, Joe. Say&mdash;I wish the boys could see us now."</p>
<p>"So do I."</p>
<pb n="139" entity="DSSR_000002931_0154"/>
<p>"Say&mdash;boys, don't say anything about it, and some time when they're around, <lb/>
I'll come up to you and say 'Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.' And you'll say, <lb/>
kind of careless like, as if it warn't anything, you'll say, 'Yes, I got my <hi rend="italic">old</hi> pipe, <lb/>
and another one, but my tobacker ain't very good.' And I'll say, 'Oh, that's all <lb/>
right, if it's <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> enough.' And then you'll out with the pipes, and we'll light up <lb/>
just as ca'm, and then just see 'em look!"</p>
<p>"By jings that'll be gay, Tom! I wish it was <hi rend="italic">now</hi>!"</p>
<p>"So do I! And when we tell 'em we <lb/>
learned when we was off pirating, won't <lb/>
they wish they'd been along?"</p>
<p>"O, I reckon not! I'll just <hi rend="italic">bet</hi> they <lb/>
will!"</p>

</figure>
<p>So the talk ran on. But presently it <lb/>
began to flag a trifle, and grow disjointed. <lb/>
The silences widened; the expectoration <lb/>
marvelously increased. Every pore inside <lb/>
the boys' cheeks became a spouting <reg orig="fount-|ain">fountain</reg>; <lb/>
they could scarcely bail out the <lb/>
cellars under their tongues fast enough to <lb/>
prevent an inundation; little overflowings <lb/>
down their throats occurred in spite of all <lb/>
they could do, and sudden retchings <lb/>
followed every time. Both boys were <lb/>
looking very pale and miserable, now. <lb/>
Joe's pipe dropped from his nerveless <lb/>
fingers. Tom's followed. Both fountains were going furiously and both pumps <lb/>
bailing with might and main. Joe said feebly:</p>
<p>"I've lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it."</p>
<p>Tom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:</p>
<p>"I'll help you. You go over that way and I'll hunt around by the spring. No, <lb/>
you needn't come, Huck&mdash;we can find it."</p>
<p>So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome, <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="DSSR_000002931_0155"/>
and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both very <lb/>
pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had had any <lb/>
trouble they had got rid of it.</p>
<p>They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look, <lb/>
and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare theirs, <lb/>
they said no, they were not feeling very well&mdash;something they ate at dinner had <lb/>
disagreed with them.</p>
<p>About midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding <lb/>
oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys huddled <lb/>
themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of the fire, though <lb/>
the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was stifling. They sat still, intent <lb/>
and waiting. The solemn hush continued. Beyond the light of the fire <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness. Presently there came a <lb/>
quivering glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. <lb/>
By and by another came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan <lb/>
came sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting breath <lb/>
upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit of the Night had <lb/>
gone by. There was a pause. Now a wierd flash turned night into day and <lb/>
showed every little grass-blade, separate and distinct, that grew about their feet. <lb/>
And it showed three white, startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went <reg orig="roll-|ing">rolling</reg> <lb/>
and tumbling down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the <lb/>
distance. A sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the <lb/>
flaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the forest and an <lb/>
instant crash followed that seemed to rend the tree-tops right over tbe boys' heads. <lb/>
They clung together in terror, in the thick gloom that followed. A few big <reg orig="rain-|drops">raindrops</reg> <lb/>
fell pattering upon the leaves.</p>
<p>"Quick! boys, go for the tent!" exclaimed Tom.</p>
<p>They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no two <lb/>
plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through the trees, making <lb/>
everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after another came, and peal on <lb/>
peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching rain poured down and the <lb/>
rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground. The boys cried out to each <lb/>
<pb n="141" entity="DSSR_000002931_0156"/>
other, but the roaring wind and the <lb/>
booming thunder-blasts drowned their <lb/>
voices utterly. However one by one <lb/>
they straggled in at last and took shelter <lb/>
under the tent, cold, scared, and <reg orig="stream-|ing">streaming</reg> <lb/>
with water; but to have company in <lb/>
misery seemed something to be grateful <lb/>
for. They could not talk, the old sail <lb/>
flapped so furiously, even if the other <lb/>
noises would have allowed them. The <lb/>
tempest rose higher and higher, and <lb/>
presently the sail tore loose from its <lb/>
fastenings and went winging away on <lb/>
the blast. The boys seized each others' <lb/>
hands and fled, with many tumblings and <lb/>
bruises, to the shelter of a great oak that <lb/>
stood upon the river bank. Now the <lb/>
battle was at its highest. Under the <lb/>
ceaseless conflagration of lightning that <lb/>
flamed in the skies, everything below <lb/>
stood out in clean-cut and shadowless <lb/>
distinctness: the bending trees, the <reg orig="bil-|lowy">billowy</reg> <lb/>
river, white with foam, the driving <lb/>
spray of spume-flakes, the dim outlines <lb/>
of the high bluffs on the other side, <lb/>
glimpsed through the drifting cloud-rack <lb/>
and the slanting veil of rain. Every little <lb/>
while some giant tree yielded the fight <lb/>
and fell crashing through the younger <lb/>
growth; and the unflagging thunder-peals <lb/>
came now in ear-splitting explosive <lb/>
bursts, keen and sharp, and unspeakably <lb/>
<figure id="f77" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0156"/>
<pb n="142" entity="DSSR_000002931_0157"/>
appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to <lb/>
tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to the tree tops, blow it away, and <lb/>
deafen every creature in it, all at one and the same moment. It was a wild <lb/>
night for homeless young heads to be out in.</p>
<p>But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and weaker <lb/>
threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The boys went back <lb/>
to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still something to be <reg orig="thank-|ful">thankful</reg> <lb/>
for, because the great sycamore, the shelter of their beds, was a ruin, now, <lb/>
blasted by the lightnings, and they were not under it when the catastrophe happened.</p>
<p>Everything in camp was drenched, the camp-fire as well; for they were but <reg orig="heed-|less">heedless</reg> <lb/>
lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against rain. Here was <lb/>
matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and chilled. They were eloquent <lb/>
in their distress; but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up <lb/>
under the great log it had been built against, (where it curved upward and <reg orig="separa-|ted">separated</reg> <lb/>
itself from the ground,) that a hand-breadth or so of it had escaped wetting; <lb/>
so they patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under <lb/>
sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they piled on <lb/>
great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace and were glad-hearted once <lb/>
more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast, and after that they sat by <lb/>
the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning, for <lb/>
there was not a dry spot to sleep on, anywhere around.</p>
<p>As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over them and they <lb/>
went out on the sand-bar and lay down to sleep. They got scorched out by and <lb/>
by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After the meal they felt rusty, and <lb/>
stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once more. Tom saw the signs, and fell to <lb/>
cheering up the pirates as well as he could. But they cared nothing for marbles, <lb/>
or circus, or swimming, or anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, <lb/>
and raised a ray of cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. <lb/>
This was to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change. <lb/>
They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were stripped, and <lb/>
striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many zebras,&mdash;all of them <lb/>
chiefs, of course&mdash;and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an <lb/>
English settlement.</p>
<pb n="143" entity="DSSR_000002931_0158"/>
<p>By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each other <lb/>
from ambush with dreadful war-whoops, and killed and scalped each other by <lb/>
thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely satisfactory one.</p>
<p>They assembled in camp toward supper <lb/>
time, hungry and happy; but now a <reg orig="diffi-|culty">difficulty</reg> <lb/>
arose&mdash;hostile Indians could not <lb/>
break the bread of hospitality together <lb/>
without first making peace, and this was <lb/>
a simple impossibility without smoking <lb/>
a pipe of peace. There was no other <lb/>
process that ever they had heard of. Two <lb/>
of the savages almost wished they had <lb/>
remained pirates. However, there was no <lb/>
other way; so with such show of <reg orig="cheerful-|ness">cheerfulness</reg> <lb/>
as they could muster they called for <lb/>
the pipe and took their whiff as it passed, <lb/>
in due form.</p>
<figure id="f78" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0158">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">terrible slaughter.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>And behold they were glad they had <lb/>
gone into savagery, for they had gained <lb/>
something; they found that they could now <lb/>
smoke a little without having to go and <lb/>
hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable. <lb/>
They were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort. No, they <lb/>
practiced cautiously, after supper, with right fair success, and so they spent a <lb/>
jubilant evening. They were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than <lb/>
they would have been in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We will <lb/>
leave them to smoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them <lb/>
at present.</p>

<figure id="f79" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0159"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">But</hi> there was no hilarity in the <reg orig="lit-|tle">little</reg> <lb/>
town that same tranquil Saturday <lb/>
afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt <lb/>
Polly's family, were being put into <lb/>
mourning, with great grief and many <lb/>
tears. An unusual quiet possessed the <lb/>
village, although it was ordinarily quiet <lb/>
enough, in all conscience. The <reg orig="vil-|lagers">villagers</reg> <lb/>
conducted their concerns with <lb/>
an absent air, and talked little; but <lb/>
they sighed often. The Saturday <reg orig="hol-|iday">holiday</reg> <lb/>
seemed a burden to the children. <lb/>
They had no heart in their sports, and <lb/>
gradually gave them up.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Becky Thatcher <lb/>
found herself moping about the <reg orig="deser-|ted">deserted</reg> <lb/>
school-house yard, and feeling very <lb/>
melancholy. But she found nothing there to comfort her. She soliloquised:</p>
<p>"Oh, if I only had his brass andiron-knob again! But I haven't got <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
now to remember him by." And she choked back a little sob.</p>
<pb n="145" entity="DSSR_000002931_0160"/>
<p>Presently she stopped, and said to herself:</p>
<p>"It was right here. O, if it was to do over again, I wouldn't say that&mdash;I <lb/>
wouldn't say it for the whole world. But he's gone now; I'll never never <lb/>
never see him any more."</p>
<p>This thought broke her down and she wandered away, with the tears rolling <lb/>
down her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls,&mdash;playmates of Tom's <lb/>
and Joe's&mdash;came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and talking in <lb/>
reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so, the last time they saw him, and how <lb/>
Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with awful prophecy, as they could <lb/>
easily see now!)&mdash;and each speaker pointed out the exact spot where the lost <lb/>
lads stood at the time, and then added something like "and I was a standing just <lb/>
so&mdash;just as I am now, and as if you was him&mdash;I was as close as that&mdash;and he <lb/>
smiled, just this way&mdash;and then something seemed to go all over me, <reg orig="like,&mdash;aw-|ful">like,&mdash;awful</reg>, <lb/>
you know&mdash;and I never thought what it meant, of course, but I can see now!"</p>
<p>Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and many <lb/>
claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or less tampered <lb/>
with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided who <hi rend="italic">did</hi> see the <lb/>
departed last, and exchanged the last words with them, the lucky parties took <lb/>
upon themselves a sort of sacred importance, and were gaped at and envied by <lb/>
all the rest. One poor chap, who had no other grandeur to offer, said with <lb/>
tolerably manifest pride in the remembrance:</p>
<p>"Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once."</p>
<p>But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that, and <lb/>
so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered away, still <lb/>
recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.</p>
<p>When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell began <lb/>
to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still Sabbath, and <lb/>
the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush that lay upon <lb/>
nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment in the vestibule to <lb/>
converse in whispers about the sad event. But there was no whispering in the <lb/>
house; only the funereal rustling of dresses as the women gathered to their <lb/>
seats, disturbed the silence there. None could remember when the little church <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="DSSR_000002931_0161"/>
had been so full before. There was finally a waiting pause, an expectant <reg orig="dumb-|ness">dumbness</reg>, <lb/>
and then Aunt Polly entered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the <lb/>
Harper family, all in deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister <lb/>
as well, rose reverently and stood, until the mourners were seated in the front <lb/>
pew. There was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled <lb/>
sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving <lb/>
hymn was sung, and the text followed: "I am the Resurrection and the Life."</p>
<p>As the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the graces, <lb/>
the winning ways and the rare promise of the lost lads, that every soul there, <lb/>
thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang in remembering that he had <lb/>
persistently blinded himself to them, always before, and had as persistently <lb/>
seen only faults and flaws in the poor boys. The minister related many a <lb/>
touching incident in the lives of the departed, too, which illustrated their sweet, <lb/>
generous natures, and the people could easily see, now, how noble and <reg orig="beauti-|ful">beautiful</reg> <lb/>
those episodes were, and remembered with grief that at the time they <lb/>
occurred they had seemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The <lb/>
congregation became more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till <lb/>
at last the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a <lb/>
chorus of anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and <lb/>
crying in the pulpit.</p>
<p>There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later the <lb/>
church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above his <reg orig="hand-|kerchief">handkerchief</reg>, <lb/>
and stood transfixed! First one and then another pair of eyes <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg> <lb/>
the minister's, and then almost with one impulse the congregation rose <lb/>
and stared while the three dead boys came marching up the aisle, Tom in the lead, <lb/>
Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags, sneaking sheepishly in the rear! <lb/>
They had been hid in the unused gallery listening to their own funeral sermon!</p>
<p>Aunt Polly, Mary and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored <lb/>
ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while poor <lb/>
Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what to do or <lb/>
where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and started to <lb/>
slink away, but Tom seized him and said:</p>
<p>"Aunt Polly, it ain't fair. Somebody's got to be glad to see Huck."</p>
<pb n="147" entity="DSSR_000002931_0162"/>
<p>"And so they shall. <hi rend="italic">I'</hi>m glad to see him, poor motherless thing!" And <lb/>
the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing capable <lb/>
of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.</p>
<p>Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: "Praise God from <lb/>
whom all blessings flow&mdash;<hi rend="small-caps">Sing</hi>!&mdash;and put your hearts in it!"</p>
<p>And they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and while <lb/>
it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the envying <lb/>
juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the proudest <lb/>
moment of his life.</p>
<figure id="f80" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0162">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">tom's proudest moment.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>As the "sold" congregation trooped out they said they would almost be <reg orig="wil-|ling">willing</reg> <lb/>
to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that once more.</p>
<p>Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day&mdash;according to Aunt Polly's varying <lb/>
moods&mdash;than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew which <lb/>
expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">That</hi> was Tom's great secret&mdash;the <lb/>
scheme to return home with his brother <lb/>
pirates and attend their own funerals. <lb/>
They had paddled over to the <reg orig="Mis-|souri">Missouri</reg> <lb/>
shore on a log, at dusk on <reg orig="Satur-|day">Saturday</reg>, <lb/>
landing five or six miles below the <lb/>
village; they had slept in the woods at <lb/>
the edge of the town till nearly daylight, <lb/>
and had then crept through back lanes <lb/>
and alleys and finished their sleep in <lb/>
the gallery of the church among a <lb/>
chaos of invalided benches.</p>
<p>At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt <lb/>
Polly and Mary were very loving to <lb/>
Tom, and very attentive to his wants. <lb/>
There was an unusual amount of talk. <lb/>
In the course of it Aunt Polly said:</p>
<p>"Well, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody suffering 'most <lb/>
a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you could be so hard-hearted <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="DSSR_000002931_0164"/>
as to let <hi rend="italic">me</hi> suffer so. If you could come over on a log to go to your funeral, you <lb/>
could have come over and give me a hint some way that you warn't <hi rend="italic">dead,</hi> but only <lb/>
run off."</p>
<p>"Yes, you could have done that, Tom," said Mary; "and I believe you would <lb/>
if you had thought of it."</p>
<p>"Would you Tom?" said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. "Say, now, <lb/>
would you, if you'd thought of it?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;well I don't know. 'Twould a spoiled everything."</p>
<p>"Tom, I hoped you loved me that much," said Aunt Polly, with a grieved tone <lb/>
that discomforted the boy. "It would been something if you'd cared enough to <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">think</hi> of it, even if you didn't <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it."</p>
<p>"Now auntie, that ain't any harm," pleaded Mary; "it's only Tom's giddy way <lb/>
&mdash;he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything."</p>
<p>"More's the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, too. Tom, you'll look back, some day, when it's too late, and wish you'd <lb/>
cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so little."</p>
<p>"Now auntie, you know I do care for you," said Tom.</p>
<p>"I'd know it better if you acted more like it."</p>
<p>"I wish now I'd thought," said Tom, with a repentant tone; "but I dreamed <lb/>
about you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"It ain't much&mdash;a cat does that much&mdash;but it's better than nothing. What did <lb/>
you dream?"</p>
<p>"Why Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the bed, <lb/>
and Sid was sitting by the wood-box, and Mary next to him."</p>
<p>"Well, so we did. So we always do. I'm glad your dreams could take even <lb/>
that much trouble about us."</p>
<p>"And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here."</p>
<p>"Why, she <hi rend="italic">was</hi> here! Did you dream any more?"</p>
<p>"O, lots. But it's so dim, now."</p>
<p>"Well, <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to recollect&mdash;can't you?"</p>
<p>"Some how it seems to me that the wind&mdash;the wind blowed the&mdash;the&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!"</p>
<pb n="150" entity="DSSR_000002931_0165"/>
<p>Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then said:</p>
<p>"I've got it now! I've got it now! It blowed the candle!"</p>
<p>"Mercy on us! Go on, Tom&mdash;go on!"</p>
<figure id="f82" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0165">

<p>"And it seems to me that you said, 'Why I believe that that door&mdash;'"</p>
<p>"Go <hi rend="italic">on,</hi> Tom!"</p>
<p>"Just let me study a moment&mdash;just a moment. Oh, yes&mdash;you said you believed <lb/>
the door was open."</p>
<p>"As I'm a sitting here, I did! Didn't I, Mary! Go on!"</p>
<p>"And then&mdash;and then&mdash;well I won't be certain, but it seems like as if you made <lb/>
Sid go and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?"</p>
<p>"You made him&mdash;you&mdash;O, you made him shut it."</p>
<p>"Well for the land's sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my days! <lb/>
Don't tell <hi rend="italic">me</hi> there ain't anything in dreams, any more. Sereny Harper shall <lb/>
know of this before I'm an hour older. I'd like to see her get around <hi rend="italic">this</hi> with <lb/>
her rubbage 'bout superstition. Go on, Tom!"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I warn't <hi rend="italic">bad,</hi> <lb/>
only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible than&mdash;than&mdash; <lb/>

<pb n="151" entity="DSSR_000002931_0166"/>
<p>"And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!"</p>
<p>"And then you began to cry."</p>
<p>"So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same and she <lb/>
wished she hadn't whipped him for taking cream when she'd throwed it out her <lb/>
own self&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophecying&mdash;that's what you <lb/>
was doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!"</p>
<p>"Then Sid he said&mdash;he said&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't think I said anything," said Sid.</p>
<p>"Yes you did, Sid," said Mary.</p>
<p>"Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?"</p>
<p>"He said&mdash;I <hi rend="italic">think</hi> he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone to, but if <lb/>
I'd been better sometimes&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">There,</hi> d'you hear that! It was his very words!"</p>
<p>"And you shut him up sharp."</p>
<p>I lay I did! There must a been an angel there. There <hi rend="italic">was</hi> an angel there, <lb/>
somewheres!"</p>
<p>"And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a fire-cracker, and you told <lb/>
about Peter and the Pain-killer&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Just as true as I live!"</p>
<p>"And then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river for us, and <lb/>
'bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper hugged and <lb/>
cried, and she went."</p>
<p>"It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I'm a sitting in these <lb/>
very tracks Tom you couldn't told it more like, if you'd a seen it! And <hi rend="italic">then</hi> <lb/>
what? Go on, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Then I thought you prayed for me&mdash;and I could see you and hear every word <lb/>
you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry, that I took and wrote on a <lb/>
piece of sycamore bark, <hi rend="italic">'We ain't dead&mdash;we are only off being pirates,'</hi> and put it <lb/>
on the table by the candle; and then you looked so good, laying there asleep, that <lb/>
I thought I went and leaned over and kissed you on the lips."</p>
<pb n="152" entity="DSSR_000002931_0167"/>
<p>"Did you, Tom, <hi rend="italic">did</hi> you! I just forgive you everything for that!" And she <lb/>
siezed the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the guiltiest of <lb/>
villains.</p>
<p>"It was very kind, even though it was only a&mdash;dream," Sid soliloquised just <lb/>
audibly.</p>
<p>"Shut up Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he'd do if he was <lb/>
awake. Here's a big Milum apple I've been saving for you Tom, if you was ever <lb/>
found again&mdash;now go 'long to school. I'm thankful to the good God and Father <lb/>
of us all I've got you back, that's long-suffering and merciful to them that believe <lb/>
on Him and keep His word, though goodness knows I'm unworthy of it, but if <lb/>
only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His hand to help them over the <lb/>
rough places, there's few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest <lb/>
when the long night comes. Go 'long Sid, Mary, Tom&mdash;take yourselves off&mdash; <lb/>
you've hendered me long enough."</p>

</figure>
<p>The children left for school, and the old <lb/>
lady to call on Mrs. Harper and vanquish <lb/>
her realism with Tom's marvelous dream. <lb/>
Sid had better judgment than to utter the <lb/>
thought that was in his mind as he left the <lb/>
house. It was this: "Pretty thin&mdash;as long <lb/>
a dream as that, without any mistakes in it!"</p>
<p>What a hero Tom was become, now! <lb/>
He did not go skipping and prancing, but <lb/>
moved with a dignified swagger as became a <lb/>
pirate who felt that the public eye was on <lb/>
him. And indeed it was; he tried not to <lb/>
seem to see the looks or hear the remarks <lb/>
as he passed along, but they were food and <lb/>
drink to him. Smaller boys than himself <lb/>
flocked at his heels, as proud to be seen <lb/>
with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer at the head of <lb/>
a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into town. Boys of his own <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="DSSR_000002931_0168"/>
size pretended not to know he had been away at all; but they were consuming <lb/>
with envy, nevertheless. They would have given anything to have that swarthy <lb/>
sun-tanned skin of his, and his glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have <lb/>
parted with either for a circus.</p>
<p>At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered such <lb/>
eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were not long in becoming <lb/>
insufferably "stuck-up." They began to tell their adventures to hungry listeners <lb/>
&mdash;but they only began; it was not a thing likely to have an end, with imaginations <lb/>
like theirs to furnish material. And finally, when they got out their pipes and <lb/>
went serenely puffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.</p>
<p>Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory <lb/>
was sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished, maybe <lb/>
she would be wanting to "make up." Well, let her&mdash;she should see that he could <lb/>
be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she arrived. Tom pretended <lb/>
not to see her. He moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began <lb/>
to talk. Soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth with flushed <lb/>
face and dancing eyes, pretending to be busy chasing school-mates, and screaming <lb/>
with laughter when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her <lb/>
captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction <lb/>
at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him; and so, <lb/>
instead of winning him it only "set him up" the more and made him the more <lb/>
diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about. Presently she gave over <lb/>
skylarking, and moved irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing <lb/>
furtively and wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was <reg orig="talk-|ing">talking</reg> <lb/>
more particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp <lb/>
pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her <lb/>
feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to a girl <lb/>
almost at Tom's elbow&mdash;with sham vivacity:</p>
<p>"Why Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn't you come to Sunday-school?"</p>
<p>"I did come&mdash;didn't you see me?"</p>
<p>"Why no! Did you? Where did you sit?</p>
<p>"I was in Miss Peter's class, where I always go. I saw <hi rend="italic">you</hi>."</p>
<pb n="154" entity="DSSR_000002931_0169"/>
<p>"Did you? Why it's funny I didn't see you. I wanted to tell you about the <lb/>
pic-nic."</p>
<p>"O, that's jolly. Who's going to give it?"</p>
<p>"My ma's going to let me have one."</p>
<p>"O, goody; I hope she'll let <hi rend="italic">me</hi> come."</p>
<p>"Well she will. The pic-nic's for me. She'll let anybody come that I want, <lb/>
and I want you."</p>
<p>"That's ever so nice. When is it going to be?"</p>
<p>"By and by. Maybe about vacation."</p>
<p>"O, won't it be fun! You going to have <lb/>
all the girls and boys?"</p>
<p>"Yes, every one that's friends to me&mdash; <lb/>
or wants to be;" and she glanced ever so <lb/>
furtively at Tom, but he talked right along <lb/>
to Amy Lawrence about the terrible storm <lb/>
on the island, and how the lightning tore <lb/>
the great sycamore tree "all to flinders" <lb/>
while he was "standing within three feet of <lb/>
it."</p>
<p>"O, may I come?" said Gracie Miller.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And me?" said Sally Rogers.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And me, too?" said Susy Harper. "And <lb/>
Joe?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">a flirtation.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged for <lb/>
invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still talking, and <lb/>
took Amy with him. Becky's lips trembled and the tears came to her eyes; she <lb/>
hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on chattering, but the life had gone <lb/>
out of the pic-nic, now, and out of everything else; she got away as soon as she <lb/>
could and hid herself and had what her sex call "a good cry." Then she sat <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="DSSR_000002931_0170"/>
moody, with wounded pride till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a <reg orig="vin-|dictive">vindictive</reg> <lb/>
cast in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew <lb/>
what <hi rend="italic">she'd</hi> do.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">becky retaliates.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant self-satisfaction. <lb/>
And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate her with the performance. <lb/>
At last he spied her, but there was a <lb/>
sudden falling of his mercury. She was <lb/>
sitting cosily on a little bench behind the <lb/>
school-house looking at a picture book <lb/>
with Alfred Temple&mdash;and so absorbed <lb/>
were they, and their heads so close <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg> <lb/>
over the book that they did not <lb/>
seem to be conscious of anything in the <lb/>
world besides. Jealousy ran red hot <lb/>
through Tom's veins. He began to hate <lb/>
himself for throwing away the chance <lb/>
Becky had offered for a reconciliation. <lb/>
He called himself a fool, and all the hard <lb/>
names he could think of. He wanted to <lb/>
cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily <lb/>
along, as they walked, for her heart was <lb/>
singing, but Tom's tongue had lost its <lb/>
function. He did not hear what Amy <lb/>
was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer an <lb/>
awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as otherwise. He kept drifting to <lb/>
the rear of the school-house, again and again, to sear his eye-balls with the <reg orig="hate-|ful">hateful</reg> <lb/>
spectacle there. He could not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he <lb/>
thought he saw, that Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in <lb/>
the land of the living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was <lb/>
winning her fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.</p>
<p>Amy's happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had to attend <lb/>
to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in vain&mdash;the girl <lb/>
<pb n="156" entity="DSSR_000002931_0171"/>
chirped on. Tom thought, "O hang her, ain't I ever going to get rid of her?" <lb/>
At last he <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be attending to those things&mdash;and she said artlessly that she would <lb/>
be "around" when school let out. And he hastened away, hating her for it.</p>
<p>"Any other boy!" Tom thought, grating his teeth. "Any boy in the whole <lb/>
town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is aristocracy! <lb/>
O, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw this town, mister, and I'll lick <lb/>
you again! You just wait till I catch you out! I'll just take and&mdash;"</p>
<p>And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy&mdash;pummeling <lb/>
the air, and kicking and gouging. "Oh, you do, do you? You holler 'nough, do <lb/>
you? Now, then, let that learn you!" And so the imaginary flogging was <lb/>
finished to his satisfaction.</p>
<figure id="f86" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0171">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">a sudden frost.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy's <lb/>
grateful happiness, and his jealousy could <lb/>
bear no more of the other distress. Becky <lb/>
resumed her picture-inspections with Alfred, <lb/>
but as the minutes dragged along and no <lb/>
Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to <lb/>
cloud and she lost interest; gravity and <lb/>
absent-mindedness followed, and then <reg orig="mel-|ancholy">melancholy</reg>; <lb/>
two or three times she pricked <lb/>
up her ear at a footstep, but it was a <lb/>
false hope; no Tom came. At last she <lb/>
grew entirely miserable and wished she <lb/>
hadn't carried it so far. When poor Alfred, <lb/>
seeing that he was losing her, he did not <lb/>
know how, and kept exclaiming: "O here's <lb/>
a jolly one! look at this!" she lost <reg orig="pa-|tience">patience</reg> <lb/>
at last, and said, "Oh, don't bother <lb/>
me! I don't care for them!" and burst <lb/>
into tears, and got up and walked away.</p>
<p>Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she said.</p>
<p>"Go away and leave me alone, can't you! I hate you!"</p>
<pb n="157" entity="DSSR_000002931_0172"/>
<p>So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done&mdash;for she had said she <lb/>
would look at pictures all through the nooning&mdash;and she walked on, crying. <lb/>
Then Alfred went musing into the deserted school-house. He was humiliated <lb/>
and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth&mdash;the girl had simply made a <lb/>
convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer. He was far from hating <lb/>
Tom the less when this thought occurred <lb/>
to him. He wished there was some way to <lb/>
get that boy into trouble without much risk <lb/>
to himself. Tom's spelling book fell under <lb/>
his eye. Here was his opportunity. He <lb/>
gratefully opened to the lesson for the <lb/>
afternoon and poured ink upon the page.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">counter-irritation.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Becky, glancing in at a window behind <lb/>
him at the moment, saw the act, and <lb/>
moved on, without discovering herself. <lb/>
She started homeward, now, intending to <lb/>
find Tom and tell him; Tom would be <lb/>
thankful and their troubles would be <lb/>
healed. Before she was half way home, <lb/>
however, she had changed her mind. The <lb/>
thought of Tom's treatment of her when <lb/>
she was talking about her pic-nic came <lb/>
scorching back and filled her with shame. She resolved to let him get whipped <lb/>
on the damaged spelling-book's account, and to hate him forever, into the <lb/>
bargain.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Tom</hi> arrived at home in a dreary <lb/>

said to him showed him that he had <lb/>
brought his sorrows to an <reg orig="unprom-|ising">unpromising</reg> <lb/>
market:</p>
<p>"Tom, I've a notion to skin you <lb/>
alive!"</p>
<p>"Auntie, what have I done?"</p>
<p>"Well, you've done enough. Here <lb/>
I go over to Sereny Harper, like an <lb/>

make her believe all that rubbage <lb/>
about that dream, when lo and <reg orig="be-|hold">behold</reg> <lb/>
you she'd found out from Joe <lb/>
that you was over here and heard all <lb/>
the talk we had that night. Tom I <lb/>

go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a word."</p>
<pb n="159" entity="DSSR_000002931_0174"/>
<p>This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had <lb/>
seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked mean <lb/>
and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to say <lb/>
for a moment. Then he said:</p>
<p>"Auntie, I wish I hadn't done it&mdash;but I didn't think."</p>
<p>"O, child you never think. You never think of anything but your own <lb/>
selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from Jackson's <lb/>
island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could think to fool me <lb/>
with a lie about a dream; but you couldn't ever think to pity us and save us <lb/>
from sorrow."</p>
<p>"Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean. I didn't, <lb/>
honest. And besides I didn't come over here to laugh at you that night."</p>
<p>"What did you come for, then?"</p>
<p>"It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn't got <lb/>
drowned."</p>
<p>"Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could <lb/>
believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never did&mdash; <lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know it, Tom."</p>
<p>"Indeed and 'deed I did, auntie&mdash;I wish I may never stir if I didn't."</p>
<p>"O, Tom, don't lie&mdash;don't do it. It only makes things a hundred times <lb/>
worse."</p>
<p>"It ain't a lie, auntie, it's the truth. I wanted to keep you from grieving&mdash; <lb/>
that was all that made me come."</p>
<p>"I'd give the whole world to believe that&mdash;it would cover up a power of sins <lb/>
Tom. I'd 'most be glad you'd run off and acted so bad. But it aint <reg orig="reason-|able">reasonable</reg>; <lb/>
because, why didn't you tell me, child?"</p>
<p>"Why, you see, auntie, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got <lb/>
all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn't <lb/>
somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and kept <lb/>
mum."</p>
<p>"What bark?"</p>
<p>"The bark I had wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirating. I wish, now, <lb/>
you'd waked up when I kissed you&mdash;I do, honest."</p>
<pb n="160" entity="DSSR_000002931_0175"/>
<p>The hard lines in his aunt's face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned <lb/>
in her eyes.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"Did</hi> you kiss me, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Why yes I did."</p>
<p>"Are you sure you did, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Why yes I did, auntie&mdash;certain sure."</p>
<p>"What did you kiss me for, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry."</p>
<p>The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in her <lb/>
voice when she said:</p>
<p>"Kiss me again, Tom!&mdash;and be off with you to school, now, and don't bother <lb/>
me any more."</p>
<p>The moment he was gone, she ran to a <lb/>
closet and got out the ruin of a jacket <lb/>
which Tom had gone pirating in. Then <lb/>
she stopped, with it in her hand, and said <lb/>
to herself:</p>
<p>"No, I don't dare. Poor boy, I reckon <lb/>
he's lied about it&mdash;but it's a blessed, <lb/>
blessed lie, there's such comfort come <lb/>
from it. I hope the Lord&mdash;I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> the <lb/>

<p>She put the jacket away, and stood by <lb/>
musing a minute. Twice she put out her <lb/>
hand to take the garment again, and twice <lb/>
she refrained. Once more she ventured, <lb/>
and this time she fortified herself with the thought: "It's a good lie&mdash;it's a <lb/>
good lie&mdash;I won't let it grieve me." So she sought the jacket pocket. A <lb/>
moment later she was reading Tom's piece of bark through flowing tears and <lb/>
saying: "I could forgive the boy, now, if he'd committed a million sins!"</p>

coming upon Becky Thatcher at the <lb/>

nevertheless. He moped into the school-yard wishing she were a boy, and <lb/>
imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently encountered her <lb/>
and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled one in return, and the <lb/>
angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in her hot resentment, that she <lb/>
could hardly wait for school to "take in," she was so impatient to see Tom flogged <lb/>
for the injured spelling-book. If she had had any lingering notion of exposing <lb/>
Alfred Temple, Tom's offensive fling had driven it entirely away.</p>
<p>Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself. The <lb/>
master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied ambition. The <lb/>
darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but poverty had decreed that he should <lb/>
be nothing higher than a village schoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious <lb/>
book out of his desk and absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were <lb/>
reciting. He kept that book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in <lb/>
school but was perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. <lb/>
Every boy and girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two <reg orig="theo-|ries">theories</reg> <lb/>
were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case. Now, as <lb/>
Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she noticed that the <lb/>
key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She glanced around; found <lb/>
herself alone, and the next instant she had the book in her hands. The title-page <lb/>
&mdash;Professor somebody's "Anatomy"&mdash;carried no information to her mind; so she <lb/>
began to turn the leaves. She came at once upon a handsomely engraved and <lb/>
colored frontispiece&mdash;a human figure, stark naked. At that moment a shadow <lb/>
fell on the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the door, and caught a glimpse of <lb/>
the picture. Becky snatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear <lb/>
the pictured page half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk, <lb/>
turned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.</p>
<p>"Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person and <lb/>
look at what they're looking at."</p>
<p>"How could <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know you was looking at anything?"</p>
<pb n="163" entity="DSSR_000002931_0178"/>
<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself Tom Sawyer; you know you're going to <lb/>
tell on me, and O, what shall I do, what shall I do! I'll be whipped, and I never <lb/>
was whipped in school."</p>
<p>Then she stamped her little foot and <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Be</hi> so mean if you want to! <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know <lb/>
something that's going to happen. You <lb/>
just wait and you'll see! Hateful, hateful, <lb/>
hateful!"&mdash;and she flung out of the house <lb/>
with a new explosion of crying.</p>
<p>Tom stood still, rather flustered by this <lb/>
onslaught. Presently he said to himself:</p>
<p>"What a curious kind of a fool a girl is. <lb/>
Never been licked in school! Shucks. <lb/>
What's a licking! That's just like a girl <lb/>
&mdash;they're so thin-skinned and chicken <lb/>
hearted. Well, of course <hi rend="italic">I</hi> ain't going to <lb/>
tell old Dobbins on this little fool, because <lb/>
there's other ways of getting even on her, <lb/>
that ain't so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask who it was tore his <lb/>
book. Nobody'll answer. Then he'll do just the way he always does&mdash;ask first <lb/>
one and then t'other, and when he comes to the right girl he'll know it, without <lb/>
any telling. Girl's faces always tell on them. They ain't got any back-bone. <lb/>
She'll get licked. Well, it's a kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because <lb/>
there ain't any way out of it." Tom conned the thing a moment longer and then <lb/>
added: "All right, though; she'd like to see me in just such a fix&mdash;let her sweat <lb/>
it out!"</p>
<figure id="f91" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0178">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">caught in the act.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the <lb/>
master arrived and school "took in." Tom did not feel a strong interest in his <lb/>
studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls' side of the room Becky's face <lb/>
troubled him. Considering all things, he did not want to pity her, and yet it was <lb/>
all he could do to help it. He could get up no exultation that was really worthy <lb/>
<pb n="164" entity="DSSR_000002931_0179"/>
the name. Presently the spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom's mind <lb/>
was entirely full of his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up <lb/>
from her lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She <lb/>
did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he spilt the <lb/>
ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only seemed to make <lb/>
the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad of that, and she <lb/>
tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she was not certain. When the <lb/>
worst came to the worst, she had an impulse to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, <lb/>
but she made an effort and forced herself to keep still&mdash;because, said she to <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>, <lb/>
"he'll tell about me tearing the picture sure. I wouldn't say a word, not <lb/>
to save his life!"</p>
<p>Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all broken-hearted, <lb/>
for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly upset the ink on the <reg orig="spell-|ing-book">spelling-book</reg> <lb/>
himself, in some skylarking bout&mdash;he had denied it for form's sake and <lb/>
because it was custom, and had stuck to the denial from principle.</p>
<p>A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air was <lb/>
drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened himself up, <lb/>
yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book, but seemed undecided <lb/>
whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the pupils glanced up languidly, but <lb/>
there were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes. Mr. <lb/>
Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while, then took it out and settled <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
in his chair to read! Tom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted <lb/>
and helpless rabbit look as she did, with a gun leveled at its head. Instantly he <lb/>
forgot his quarrel with her. Quick&mdash;something must be done! done in a flash, <lb/>
too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention. Good! <lb/>
&mdash;he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring through the <lb/>
door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little instant, and the chance was <lb/>
lost&mdash;the master opened the volume. If Tom only had the wasted opportunity back <lb/>
again! Too late. There was no help for Becky now, he said. The next moment <lb/>
the master faced the school. Every eye sunk under his gaze. There was that in <lb/>
it which smote even the innocent with fear. There was silence while one might <lb/>
count ten, the master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke:</p>
<pb n="165" entity="DSSR_000002931_0180"/>
<p>"Who tore this book?"</p>
<p>There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg>; <lb/>
the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.</p>
<p>"Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?"</p>
<p>"A denial. Another pause.</p>
<p>"Joseph Harper, did you?"</p>
<p>Another denial. Tom's uneasiness grew more and more intense under the slow <lb/>
torture of these proceedings. The master <lb/>
scanned the ranks of boys&mdash;considered <lb/>
a while, then turned to the girls:</p>
<p>"Amy Lawrence?"</p>
<p>A shake of the head.</p>
<p>"Gracie Miller?"</p>
<p>The same sign.</p>
<figure id="f92" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0180">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">tom astonishes the school.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"Susan Harper, did you do this?"</p>
<p>Another negative. The next girl was <lb/>
Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling <lb/>
from head to foot with excitement and a <lb/>
sense of the hopelessness of the situation.</p>
<p>"Rebecca Thatcher," [Tom glanced at <lb/>
her face&mdash;it was white with terror,]&mdash;"did <lb/>
you tear&mdash;no, look me in the face"&mdash;[her <lb/>
hands rose in appeal]&mdash; "did you tear <lb/>
this book?"</p>
<p>A thought shot like lightning through Tom's brain. He sprang to his feet <lb/>
and shouted&mdash;"<hi rend="italic">I</hi> done it!"</p>
<p>The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a moment, <lb/>
to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward to go to his <lb/>
punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that shone upon him out of <lb/>
poor Becky's eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings. Inspired by the <lb/>
splendor of his own act, he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that <lb/>
even Mr. Dobbins had ever administered; and also received with indifference the <lb/>
<pb n="166" entity="DSSR_000002931_0181"/>
added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed <lb/>
&mdash;for he knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not <lb/>
count the tedious time as loss, either.</p>
<p>Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for with <lb/>
shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own treachery; <lb/>
but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to pleasanter musings, <lb/>
and he fell asleep at last, with Becky's latest words lingering dreamily in his ear&mdash;</p>
<p>"Tom, how <hi rend="italic">could</hi> you be so noble!"</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Vacation</hi> was approaching. The <lb/>
schoolmaster, always severe, grew <lb/>
severer and more exacting than <lb/>
ever, for he wanted the school to <lb/>
make a good showing on "<reg orig="Ex-|amination">Examination</reg>" <lb/>
day. His rod and his <lb/>
ferule were seldom idle now&mdash;at <lb/>
least among the smaller pupils. <lb/>
Only the biggest boys, and young <lb/>
ladies of eighteen and twenty <lb/>
escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins's <lb/>
lashings were very vigorous ones, <lb/>
too; for although he carried, under <lb/>
his wig, a perfectly bald and shiny <lb/>
head, he had only reached middle <lb/>
age and there was no sign of <lb/>
feebleness in his muscle. As the <lb/>
great day approached, all the <lb/>
tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a vindictive <lb/>
pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence was, that the <lb/>
<pb n="168" entity="DSSR_000002931_0183"/>
smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and their nights in <reg orig="plot-|ting">plotting</reg> <lb/>
revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief. <lb/>
But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution that followed every vengeful <lb/>
success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the <lb/>
field badly worsted. At last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that <lb/>
promised a dazzling victory. They swore-in the sign-painter's boy, told him <lb/>
the scheme, and asked his help. He had his own reasons for being delighted, <lb/>
for the master boarded in his father's family and had given the boy ample <lb/>
<figure id="f95" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0183">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">examination evening.</hi></head>
</figure>
cause to hate him. The master's wife would go on a visit to the country in a <lb/>
few days, and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master <lb/>
always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and <lb/>
the sign-painter's boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
on Examination Evening he would "manage the thing" while he napped <lb/>
<pb n="169" entity="DSSR_000002931_0184"/>
in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried <lb/>
away to school.</p>
<p>In the fullness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in the <lb/>
evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with wreaths and <lb/>
festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in his great chair <lb/>
upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him. He was looking <lb/>
tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and six rows in front <lb/>
of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the <lb/>
pupils. To his left, back of the rows of citizens, was a spacious temporary <reg orig="plat-|form">platform</reg> <lb/>
upon which were seated the scholars who were to take part in the <reg orig="exer-|cises">exercises</reg> <lb/>
of the evening; rows of small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable <lb/>
state of discomfort; rows of gawky big boys; snow-banks of girls and young <lb/>
ladies clad in lawn and muslin and conspiciously conscious of their bare arms, <lb/>
their grandmothers' ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and the <lb/>
flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with non-<reg orig="partici-|pating">participating</reg> <lb/>
scholars.</p>
<p>The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited, <lb/>
"You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage, etc"&mdash; <lb/>
accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which <lb/>
a machine might have used&mdash;supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order. <lb/>
But he got through safely, though cruelly scared, and got a fine round of <lb/>
applause when he made his manufactured bow and retired.</p>
<p>A little shame-faced girl lisped "Mary had a little lamb, etc.," performed a <lb/>
compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and sat down flushed <lb/>
and happy.</p>
<p>Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into the <lb/>
unquenchable and indestructible "Give me liberty or give me death" speech, <lb/>
with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the middle of it. <lb/>
A ghastly stage-fright siezed him, his legs quaked under him and he was like <lb/>
to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the house&mdash;but he had the <lb/>
house's silence, too, which was even worse than its sympathy. The master <lb/>
frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom struggled a while and then <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="DSSR_000002931_0185"/>
retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak attempt at applause, but it died <lb/>
early.</p>
<figure id="f96" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0185">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">on exhibition.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"The Boy stood on the Burning Deck" followed; also "The Assyrian Came <lb/>
Down," and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises, and <lb/>
a spelling fight. The meager Latin class recited with honor. The prime <lb/>
feature of the evening was in order, now&mdash;original "compositions" by the <lb/>
young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform, <lb/>
cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty ribbon), and <reg orig="pro-|ceeded">proceeded</reg> <lb/>
to read, with labored attention to "expression" and punctuation. The <lb/>
themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by <lb/>
their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and doubtless all their <reg orig="ances-|tors">ancestors</reg> <lb/>
in the female line clear back to the Crusades. "Friendship" was one; <lb/>
"Memories of Other Days;" "Religion in History;" "Dream Land;" "The <lb/>
Advantages of Culture;" "Forms of Political Government Compared and <lb/>
<pb n="171" entity="DSSR_000002931_0186"/>
Contrasted;" "Melancholy;" "Filial Love;" "Heart Longings," etc., etc.</p>
<p>A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted <reg orig="melan-|choly">melancholy</reg>; <lb/>
another was a wasteful and opulent gush of "fine language;" another <lb/>
was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases <lb/>
until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that conspicuously <lb/>
marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that <lb/>
wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them. No matter <lb/>
what the subject might be, a brain-racking effort was made to squirm it into <lb/>
some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate <lb/>
with edification. The glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to <lb/>
compass the banishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient <lb/>
to-day; it never will be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is <lb/>
no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close <lb/>
their compositions with a sermom; and you will find that the sermon of the <lb/>
most frivolous and least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the <lb/>
most relentlessly pious. But enough of this. Homely truth is unpalatable.</p>
<p>Let us return to the "Examination." The first composition that was read <lb/>
was one entitled "Is this, then, Life?" Perhaps the reader can endure an <lb/>
extract from it:</p>
<p>"In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the youthful mind look <lb/>
forward to some anticipated scene of festivity! Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures <lb/>
of joy. In fancy, the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, 'the <lb/>
observed of all observers.' Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling through the <lb/>
mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest, her step is lightest in the gay assembly.</p>
<p>"In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance <lb/>
into the elysian world, of which she has had such bright dreams. How fairy-like does every thing <lb/>
appear to her enchanted vision! each new scene is more charming than the last. But after a while <lb/>
she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity: the flattery which once charmed her soul, <lb/>
now grates harshly upon her ear; the ball-room has lost its charms; and with wasted health and <lb/>
imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the <lb/>
longings of the soul!"</p>
<p>And so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to time <lb/>
during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of "How sweet!" <lb/>
"How eloquent!" "So true!" etc., and after the thing had closed with a <lb/>
peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.</p>
<pb n="172" entity="DSSR_000002931_0187"/>
<p>Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the "interesting" <reg orig="pale-|ness">paleness</reg> <lb/>
that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a "poem." Two stanzas of <lb/>
it will do:</p>
<q><text id="d36"><body><div1 type="quotation">

<p>There were very few there who knew what "<hi rend="italic">t&ecirc;te</hi>" meant, but the poem was <lb/>
very satisfactory, nevertheless.</p>
<p>Next appeared a dark complexioned, black eyed, black haired young lady, <lb/>
who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression and began to <lb/>
read in a measured, solemn tone.</p>
<q><text id="d37"><body><div1 type="quotation">
<head>A VISION.</head>
<p>Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single star quivered; but <lb/>
the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific <lb/>
lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the <lb/>
power exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous winds unanimously <lb/>
came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness <lb/>

thereof, <lb/>
<q>
<l>"My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide&mdash;</l>

She moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy's Eden by the <lb/>

soft was her step, it failed to make even a sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by her <lb/>
genial touch, as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided away unperceived&mdash;unsought. <lb/>
A strange sadness rested upon her features, like icy tears upon the robe of December, as she <lb/>
pointed to the contending elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented.</p>

<p>This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with <lb/>
a sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the first <lb/>
prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the <lb/>
evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize to the author of it, <lb/>
made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most "eloquent" <lb/>
thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel Webster himself might well be <lb/>
proud of it.</p>
<p>It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which <lb/>
the word "beauteous" was over-fondled, and human experience referred to as <lb/>
"life's page," was up to the usual average.</p>

<p>Now the master, mellow almost to the <lb/>
verge of geniality, put his chair aside, <lb/>
turned his back to the audience, and <lb/>
began to draw a map of America on the <lb/>
blackboard, to exercise the geography <lb/>
class upon. But he made a sad business <lb/>
of it with his unsteady hand, and a <lb/>
smothered titter rippled over the house. <lb/>
He knew what the matter was and set <lb/>
himself to right it. He sponged out <lb/>
lines and re-made them; but he only <lb/>
distorted them more than ever, and the <lb/>
tittering was more pronounced. He <lb/>
threw his entire attention upon his work, <lb/>
now, as if determined not to be put down <lb/>
by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were <lb/>
fastened upon him; he imagined he was <lb/>
succeeding, and yet the tittering <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg>; <lb/>
it even manifestly increased. <lb/>
And well it might. There was a garret <lb/>
above, pierced with a scuttle over his <lb/>
head; and down through this scuttle <lb/>
came a cat, suspended around the <lb/>
haunches by a string; she had a rag <lb/>
tied about her head and jaws to keep <lb/>
her from mewing; as she slowly <reg orig="de-|scended">descended</reg> <lb/>
she curved upward and clawed <lb/>
at the string, she swung downward and <lb/>
clawed at the intangible air. The <reg orig="titter-|ing">tittering</reg> <lb/>
rose higher and higher&mdash;the cat was <lb/>
within six inches of the absorbed teacher's <lb/>
head&mdash;down, down, a little lower, and <lb/>
<pb n="175" entity="DSSR_000002931_0190"/>
she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it and was snatched <lb/>
up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession! And <lb/>
how the light did blaze abroad from the master's bald pate&mdash;for the <reg orig="sign-|painter's">sign-painter's</reg> <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Tom</hi> joined the new order of Cadets <lb/>
of Temperance, being attracted by <lb/>
the showy character of their "regalia." <lb/>
He promised to abstain from smoking, <lb/>
chewing and profanity as long as he <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
a member. Now he found out <lb/>
a new thing&mdash;namely, that to promise <lb/>
not to do a thing is the surest way in <lb/>
the world to make a body want to go <lb/>
and do that very thing. Tom soon <lb/>
found himself tormented with a desire <lb/>
to drink and swear; the desire grew <lb/>
to be so intense that nothing but the <lb/>
hope of a chance to display himself <lb/>
in his red sash kept him from <reg orig="with-|drawing">withdrawing</reg> <lb/>
from the order. Fourth of <lb/>
July was coming; but he soon gave <lb/>
that up&mdash;gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours&mdash;and <lb/>
fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently <lb/>
<pb n="177" entity="DSSR_000002931_0192"/>
on his death-bed and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an <lb/>
official. During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge's <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high&mdash;so high that he <lb/>
would venture to get out his regalia and practice before the looking-glass. But <lb/>
the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was pronounced <lb/>
upon the mend&mdash;and then convalescent. Tom was disgusted; and felt a sense of <lb/>
injury, too. He handed in his resignation at once&mdash;and that night the Judge <lb/>
suffered a relapse and died. Tom resolved that he would never trust a man like <lb/>
that again.</p>
<figure id="f101" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0192">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">happy for two days.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill <lb/>
the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again, however&mdash;there was <lb/>
something in that. He could drink and swear, now&mdash;but found to his surprise <lb/>
<pb n="178" entity="DSSR_000002931_0193"/>
that he did not want to. The simple fact that he could, took the desire away; <lb/>
and the charm of it.</p>
<p>Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning to <lb/>
hang a little heavily on his hands.</p>
<p>He attempted a diary&mdash;but nothing happened during three days, and so he <lb/>
abandoned it.</p>
<p>The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a sensation. <lb/>
Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were happy for two days.</p>
<p>Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained hard, there <lb/>
was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man in the world (as Tom <lb/>
supposed) Mr. Benton, an actual United States Senator, proved an overwhelming <lb/>
disappointment&mdash;for he was not twenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the <lb/>
neighborhood of it.</p>
<p>A circus came. The boys played circus <lb/>
for three days afterward in tents made of <lb/>
rag carpeting&mdash;admission, three pins for <lb/>
boys, two for girls&mdash;and then circusing was <lb/>
abandoned.</p>
<figure id="f102" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0193">

</figure>
<p>A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came <lb/>
&mdash;and went again and left the village duller <lb/>
and drearier than ever.</p>
<p>There were some boys-and-girls' parties, <lb/>
but they were so few and so delightful that <lb/>
they only made the aching voids between <lb/>
ache the harder.</p>
<p>Becky Thatcher was gone to her <reg orig="Constan-|tinople">Constantinople</reg> <lb/>
home to stay with her parents during <lb/>
vacation&mdash;so there was no bright side to life <lb/>
anywhere.</p>
<p>The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very cancer <lb/>
for permanency and pain.</p>
<pb n="179" entity="DSSR_000002931_0194"/>
<p>Then came the measles.</p>
<p>During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its <reg orig="happen-|ings">happenings</reg>. <lb/>
He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got upon his feet <lb/>
at last and moved feebly down town, a melancholy change had come over <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
and every creature. There had been a "revival," and everybody had "got <lb/>
religion," not only the adults, but even the boys and girls. Tom went about, <lb/>
hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed sinful face, but disappointment <lb/>
crossed him everywhere. He found Joe Harper studying a Testament, and <lb/>
turned sadly away from the depressing spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and <lb/>
found him visiting the poor with a basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, <lb/>
who called his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. <lb/>
Every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in <lb/>
desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn and was <lb/>
received with a scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he crept home and to <lb/>
bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost, forever and forever.</p>
<p>And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful claps of <lb/>
thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his head with the <reg orig="bed-|clothes">bedclothes</reg> <lb/>
and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for he had not the <lb/>
shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him. He believed he had <lb/>
taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and <lb/>
that this was the result. It might have seemed to him a waste of pomp and <reg orig="am-|munition">ammunition</reg> <lb/>
to kill a bug with a battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing <reg orig="incon-|gruous">incongruous</reg> <lb/>
about the getting up such an expensive thunder storm as this to knock <lb/>
the turf from under an insect like himself.</p>
<p>By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its object. <lb/>
The boy's first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His second was to wait <lb/>
&mdash;for there might not be any more storms.</p>
<p>The next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks he <lb/>
spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad at last he <lb/>
was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how lonely was his <lb/>
estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted listlessly down the <lb/>
<pb n="180" entity="DSSR_000002931_0195"/>
street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a juvenile court that was trying a <lb/>
cat for murder, in the presence of her victim, a bird. He found Joe Harper and <lb/>
Huck Finn up an alley eating a stolen melon. Poor lads! they&mdash;like Tom&mdash;had <lb/>
suffered a relapse.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">At</hi> last the sleepy atmosphere was <lb/>
stirred&mdash;and vigorously: the murder <lb/>
trial came on in the court. It <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
the absorbing topic of village <lb/>
talk immediately. Tom could not <lb/>
get away from it. Every reference <lb/>
to the murder sent a shudder to his <lb/>
heart, for his troubled conscience <lb/>
and fears almost persuaded him that <lb/>
these remarks were put forth in his <lb/>
hearing as "feelers;" he did not see <lb/>
how he could be suspected of <reg orig="know-|ing">knowing</reg> <lb/>
anything about the murder, but <lb/>
still he could not be comfortable in <lb/>
the midst of this gossip. It kept <lb/>
him in a cold shiver all the time. <lb/>
He took Huck to a lonely place to <lb/>
have a talk with him. It would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little <lb/>
while; to divide his burden of distress with another sufferer. Moreover, he <lb/>
wanted to assure himself that Huck had remained discreet.</p>
<pb n="182" entity="DSSR_000002931_0197"/>
<p>"Huck, have you ever told anybody about&mdash;that?"</p>
<p>"'Bout what?"</p>
<p>"You know what."</p>
<p>"Oh&mdash;'course I haven't."</p>
<p>"Never a word?"</p>
<p>"Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?"</p>
<p>"Well, I was afeard."</p>
<p>"Why Tom Sawyer, we wouldn't be alive two days if that got found out. <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">You</hi> know that."</p>
<p>Tom felt more comfortable. After a pause:</p>
<p>"Huck, they couldn't anybody get you to tell, could they?"</p>
<p>"Get me to tell? Why if I wanted that half-breed devil to drownd me they <lb/>
could get me to tell. They ain't no different way."</p>
<p>"Well, that's all right, then. I reckon we're safe as long as we keep mum. <lb/>
But let's swear again, anyway. It's more surer."</p>
<p>"I'm agreed."</p>
<p>So they swore again with dread solemnities.</p>
<p>"What is the talk around, Huck? I've heard a power of it."</p>
<p>"Talk? Well, it's just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the time. <lb/>
It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so's I want to hide som'ers."</p>
<p>"That's just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he's a goner. <lb/>
Don't you feel sorry for him, sometimes?"</p>
<p>"Most always&mdash;most always. He ain't no account; but then he hain't ever <lb/>
done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to get drunk <lb/>
on&mdash;and loafs around considerable; but lord we all do that&mdash;leastways most of <lb/>
us,&mdash;preachers and such like. But he's kind of good&mdash;he give me half a fish, <lb/>
once, when there warn't enough for two; and lots of times he's kind of stood <lb/>
by me when I was out of luck."</p>
<p>"Well, he's mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line. I <lb/>
wish we could get him out of there."</p>
<p>"My! we couldn't get him out Tom. And besides, 'twouldn't do any good; <lb/>
they'd ketch him again."</p>
<pb n="183" entity="DSSR_000002931_0198"/>
<p>"Yes&mdash;so they would. But I hate to hear 'em abuse him so like the dickens <lb/>
when he never done&mdash;that."</p>
<p>"I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest looking villain in <lb/>
this country, and they wonder he wasn't ever hung before."</p>
<p>"Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I've heard 'em say that if he was to <lb/>
get free they'd lynch him."</p>
<p>"And they'd do it, too."</p>
<p>The boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the <reg orig="twi-|light">twilight</reg> <lb/>
drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood of the <lb/>
little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that something would <reg orig="hap-|pen">happen</reg> <lb/>
that might clear away their difficulties. But nothing happened; there <lb/>
seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in this luckless captive.</p>
<p>The boys did as they had often done before&mdash;went to the cell grating and <lb/>
gave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor and <lb/>
there were no guards.</p>
<p>His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before&mdash;it <lb/>
cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and treacherous to the last <lb/>
degree when Potter said:</p>
<p>"You've been mighty good to me, boys&mdash;better'n anybody else in this town. <lb/>
And I don't forget it, I don't. Often I says to myself, says I, 'I used to mend <lb/>
all the boys' kites and things, and show 'em where the good fishin' places was, <lb/>
and befriend 'em what I could, and now they've all forgot old Muff when he's <lb/>
in trouble; but Tom don't, and Huck don't&mdash;<hi rend="italic">they</hi> don't forget him, says I, <lb/>
'and I don't forget them.' Well, boys, I done an awful thing&mdash;drunk and crazy <lb/>
at the time&mdash;that's the only way I account for it&mdash;and now I got to swing for <lb/>
it, and it's right. Right, and <hi rend="italic">best,</hi> too I reckon&mdash;hope so, anyway. Well, we <lb/>
won't talk about that. I don't want to make <hi rend="italic">you</hi> feel bad; you've befriended <lb/>
me. But what I want to say, is, don't <hi rend="italic">you</hi> ever get drunk&mdash;then you won't ever <lb/>
get here. Stand a little furder west&mdash;so&mdash;that's it; it's a prime comfort to see <lb/>
faces that's friendly when a body's in such a muck of trouble, and there don't <lb/>
none come here but yourn. Good friendly faces&mdash;good friendly faces. Git <lb/>
up on one another's backs and let me touch 'em. That's it. Shake hands&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="184" entity="DSSR_000002931_0199"/>
yourn'll come through the bars, but mine's <lb/>
too big. Little hands, and weak&mdash;but <lb/>
they've helped Muff Potter a power, and <lb/>
they'd help him more if they could."</p>
<p>Tom went home miserable, and his <lb/>
dreams that night were full of horrors. <lb/>
The next day and the day after, he hung <lb/>
about the court room, drawn by an almost <lb/>
irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing <lb/>
himself to stay out. Huck was having <lb/>
the same experience. They studiously <lb/>
avoided each other. Each wandered away, <lb/>
from time to time, but the same dismal <lb/>
fascination always brought them back <lb/>
presently. Tom kept his ears open when <lb/>
idlers sauntered out of the court room, <lb/>
but invariably heard distressing news&mdash; <lb/>
the toils were closing more and more <reg orig="re-|lentlessly">relentlessly</reg> <lb/>
around poor Potter. At the <lb/>
end of the second day the village talk was <lb/>
to the effect that Injun Joe's evidence <lb/>
stood firm and unshaken, and that there <lb/>
was not the slightest question as to what <lb/>
the jury's verdict would be.</p>
<figure id="f105" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0199"/>
<p>Tom was out late, that night, and came <lb/>
to bed through the window. He was in <lb/>
a tremendous state of excitement. It was <lb/>
hours before he got to sleep. All the <lb/>
village flocked to the Court house the <lb/>
next morning, for this was to be the great <lb/>
day. Both sexes were about equally <reg orig="rep-|resented">represented</reg> <lb/>
in the packed audience. After <lb/>
<pb n="185" entity="DSSR_000002931_0200"/>
a long wait the jury filed in and took their places; shortly afterward, Potter, <lb/>
pale and haggard, timid and hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, <lb/>
and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous <lb/>
was Injun Joe, stolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge <lb/>
arrived and the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual <reg orig="whis-|perings">whisperings</reg> <lb/>
among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These <lb/>
details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation <lb/>
that was as impressive as it was fascinating.</p>
<p>Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing <lb/>
in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was discovered, <lb/>
and that he immediately sneaked away. After some further questioning, <reg orig="coun-|sel">counsel</reg> <lb/>
for the prosecution said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Take the witness."</p>
<p>The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when his <lb/>
own counsel said&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have no questions to ask him."</p>
<p>The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse. Counsel <lb/>
for the prosecution said:</p>
<p>"Take the witness."</p>
<p>"I have no questions to ask him," Potter's lawyer replied.</p>
<p>A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter's possession.</p>
<p>"Take the witness."</p>
<p>Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience <lb/>
began to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his client's <lb/>
life without an effort?</p>
<p>Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter's guilty behavior when brought <lb/>
to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the stand without <lb/>
being cross-questioned.</p>
<p>Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the graveyard <lb/>
upon that morning which all present remembered so well, was brought out by <lb/>
credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined by Potter's lawyer. <lb/>
The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house expressed itself in murmurs <lb/>
<pb n="186" entity="DSSR_000002931_0201"/>
and provoked a reproof from the bench. Counsel for the prosecution now <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have <lb/>
fastened this awful crime beyond all possibility of question, upon the unhappy <lb/>
prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here."</p>
<p>A groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and <lb/>
rocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned in the <reg orig="court-|room">courtroom</reg>. <lb/>
Many men were moved, and many women's compassion testified itself <lb/>
in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:</p>
<p>"Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we foreshadowed <lb/>
our purpose to prove that our client did <lb/>
this fearful deed while under the influence <lb/>
of a blind and irresponsible delirium <lb/>
produced by drink. We have changed <lb/>
our mind. We shall not offer that plea." <lb/>
[Then to the clerk]: "Call Thomas <lb/>
Sawyer!"</p>
<p>A puzzled amazement awoke in every <lb/>
face in the house, not even excepting <lb/>
Potter's. Every eye fastened itself with <lb/>
wondering interest upon Tom as he rose <lb/>
and took his place upon the stand. The <lb/>
boy looked wild enough, for he was badly <lb/>
scared. The oath was administered.</p>
<p>"Thomas Sawyer, where were you on <lb/>
the seventeenth of June, about the hour <lb/>
of midnight?"</p>
<figure id="f106" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0201">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">tom swears.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Tom glanced at Injun Joe's iron face and his tongue failed him. The <reg orig="audi-|ence">audience</reg> <lb/>
listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few moments, <lb/>
however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed to put enough <lb/>
of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:</p>
<p>"In the graveyard!"</p>
<pb n="187" entity="DSSR_000002931_0202"/>
<p>"A little bit louder, please. Don't be afraid. You were&mdash;"</p>
<p>"In the graveyard."</p>
<p>A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe's face.</p>
<p>"Were you anywhere near Horse Williams's grave?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Speak up&mdash;just a trifle louder. How near were you?"</p>
<p>"Near as I am to you."</p>
<p>"Were you hidden, or not?"</p>
<p>"I was hid."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"Behind the elms that's on the edge of the grave."</p>
<p>Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.</p>
<p>"Any one with you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. I went there with&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Wait&mdash;wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion's name. <lb/>
We will produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with <lb/>
you."</p>
<p>Tom hesitated and looked confused.</p>
<p>"Speak out my boy&mdash;don't be diffident. The truth is always respectable. <lb/>
What did you take there?"</p>
<p>"Only a&mdash;a&mdash;dead cat."</p>
<p>There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.</p>
<p>"We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now my boy, tell us everything <lb/>
that occurred&mdash;tell it in your own way&mdash;don't skip anything, and don't be <lb/>
afraid."</p>
<p>Tom began&mdash;hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his words <lb/>
flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased but his own <lb/>
voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and bated breath the <lb/>
audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time, rapt in the ghastly <reg orig="fas-|cinations">fascinations</reg> <lb/>
of the tale. The strain upon pent emotion reached its climax when <lb/>
the boy said&mdash;</p>
<p>"&mdash;and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell, Injun <lb/>
Joe jumped with the knife and&mdash;"</p>
<pb n="188" entity="DSSR_000002931_0203"/>
<p>Crash! Quick as lightning the half-breed sprang for a window, tore his <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Tom</hi> was a glittering hero once more&mdash; <lb/>
the pet of the old, the envy of the <lb/>
young. His name even went into <lb/>
immortal print, for the village paper <lb/>
magnified him. There were some that <lb/>
believed he would be President, yet, <lb/>
if he escaped hanging.</p>
<p>As usual, the fickle, unreasoning <lb/>
world took Muff Potter to its bosom <lb/>
and fondled him as lavishly as it had <lb/>
abused him before. But that sort <lb/>
of conduct is to the world's credit; <lb/>
therefore it is not well to find fault <lb/>
with it.</p>
<p>Tom's days were days of splendor <lb/>
and exultation to him, but his nights <lb/>
were seasons of horror. Injun Joe <lb/>
infested all his dreams, and always with doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation <lb/>
could persuade the boy to stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the <lb/>
<pb n="190" entity="DSSR_000002931_0205"/>
same state of wretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the <lb/>
lawyer the night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid that <lb/>
his share in the business might leak out, <lb/>
yet, notwithstanding Injun Joe's flight had <lb/>
saved him the suffering of testifying in <lb/>
court. The poor fellow had got the <reg orig="attor-|ney">attorney</reg> <lb/>
to promise secrecy, but what of that? <lb/>
Since Tom's harrassed conscience had <lb/>
managed to drive him to the lawyer's <lb/>
house by night and wring a dread tale <lb/>
from lips that had been sealed with the <lb/>
dismalest and most formidable of oaths, <lb/>
Huck's confidence in the human race was <lb/>
well nigh obliterated.</p>

</figure>
<p>Daily Muff Potter's gratitude made Tom <lb/>
glad he had spoken; but nightly he wished <lb/>
he had sealed up his tongue.</p>
<p>Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe <lb/>
would never be captured; the other half <lb/>
he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a safe breath again <lb/>
until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.</p>
<p>Rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun Joe was <lb/>
found. One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels, a detective, came up <lb/>
from St Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked wise, and made that sort of <lb/>
astounding success which members of that craft usually achieve. That is to say <lb/>
he "found a clew." But you can't hang a "clew" for murder and so after that <lb/>
detective had got through and gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was <lb/>
before.</p>
<p>The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened weight of <lb/>
apprehension.</p>

<p>"Why, is it hid all around?"</p>
<pb n="192" entity="DSSR_000002931_0207"/>
<p>"No indeed it ain't. It's hid in mighty particular places, Huck&mdash;sometimes on <lb/>
islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of an old dead tree, just <lb/>
where the shadow falls at midnight; but <lb/>
mostly under the floor in ha'nted houses."</p>
<figure id="f111" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0207">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">the private conference.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"Who hides it?"</p>
<p>"Why robbers, of course &mdash; who'd you <lb/>
reckon? Sunday-school sup'rintendents?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. If 'twas mine I wouldn't <lb/>
hide it; I'd spend it and have a good <lb/>
time."</p>
<p>"So would I. But robbers don't do that <lb/>
way. They always hide it and leave it <lb/>
there."</p>
<p>"Don't they come after it any more?"</p>
<p>"No, they think they will, but they <reg orig="gen-|erally">generally</reg> <lb/>
forget the marks, or else they die. <lb/>
Anyway it lays there a long time and gets <lb/>
rusty; and by and by somebody finds an <lb/>
old yellow paper that tells how to find the <lb/>
marks&mdash;a paper that's got to be ciphered <lb/>
over about a week because it's mostly signs and hy'roglyphics."</p>
<p>"Hyro&mdash;which?"</p>
<p>"Hy'rogliphics&mdash;pictures and things, you know, that don't seem to mean <lb/>
anything."</p>
<p>"Have you got one of them papers, Tom?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Well then, how you going to find the marks?"</p>
<p>"I don't want any marks. They always bury it under a ha'nted house or on an <lb/>
island, or under a dead tree that's got one limb sticking out. Well, we've tried <lb/>
Jackson's Island a little, and we can try it again some time; and there's the old <lb/>
ha'nted house up the Still-House branch, and there's lots of dead-limb trees&mdash; <lb/>
dead loads of 'em."</p>
<pb n="193" entity="DSSR_000002931_0208"/>
<p>"Is it under all of them?"</p>
<p>"How you talk! No!"</p>
<p>"Then how you going to know which one to go for?"</p>
<p>"Go for all of'em!"</p>
<p>"Why Tom, it'll take all summer."</p>
<p>"Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars <lb/>
in it, all rusty and gay, or a rotten chest full of di'monds. How's that?"</p>
<p>Huck's eyes glowed.</p>
<p>"That's bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred <lb/>
dollars and I don't want no di'monds."</p>
<p>"All right. But I bet you <hi rend="italic">I</hi> ain't going to throw off on di'monds. Some of <lb/>
'em's worth twenty dollars apiece&mdash;there ain't any, hardly, but's worth six bits or <lb/>
a dollar."</p>
<p>"No! Is that so?"</p>
<p>"Cert'nly&mdash;anybody'll tell you so. Hain't you ever seen one, Huck?"</p>
<p>"Not as I remember."</p>
<p>"O, kings have slathers of them."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know no kings, Tom."</p>
<p>"I reckon you don't. But if you was to go to Europe you'd see a raft of'em <lb/>
hopping around."</p>
<p>"Do they hop?"</p>
<p>"Hop? &mdash;your granny! No!"</p>
<p>"Well what did you say they did, for?"</p>
<p>"Shucks, I only meant you'd <hi rend="italic">see</hi> 'em&mdash;not hopping, of course&mdash;what do they <lb/>
want to hop for?&mdash;but I mean you'd just see 'em&mdash;scattered around, you know, in <lb/>
a kind of a general way. Like that old hump-backed Richard."</p>
<p>"Richard? What's his other name?"</p>
<p>"He didn't have any other name. Kings don't have any but a given name."</p>
<p>"No?"</p>
<p>"But they don't."</p>
<p>"Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don't want to be a king and have <lb/>
<pb n="194" entity="DSSR_000002931_0209"/>
only just a given name, like a nigger. But say&mdash;where you going to dig first?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know. S'pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the hill <lb/>
t'other side of Still-House branch?"</p>
<p>"I'm agreed."</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">a king, poor fellow!</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>So they got a crippled pick and a shovel, <lb/>
and set out on their three-mile tramp. They <lb/>
arrived hot and panting, and threw <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
down in the shade of a neighboring <lb/>
elm to rest and have a smoke.</p>
<p>"I like this," said Tom.</p>
<p>"So do I."</p>
<p>"Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, <lb/>
what you going to do with your share?"</p>
<p>"Well I'll have pie and a glass of soda <lb/>
every day, and I'll go to every circus <lb/>
that comes along. I bet I'll have a gay <lb/>
time."</p>
<p>"Well ain't you going to save any of it?"</p>
<p>"Save it? What for?"</p>
<p>"Why so as to have something to live on, by and by."</p>
<p>"O, that ain't any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day and <lb/>
get his claws on it if I didn't hurry up, and I tell you he'd clean it out pretty <lb/>
quick. What you going to do with yourn, Tom?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to buy a new drum, and a sure-'nough sword, and a red neck-tie <lb/>
and a bull pup, and get married."</p>
<p>"Married!"</p>
<p>"That's it."</p>
<p>"Tom, you&mdash;why you ain't in your right mind."</p>
<p>"Wait&mdash;you'll see."</p>
<p>"Well that's the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my mother. <lb/>
Fight! Why they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty well."</p>
<p>"That ain't anything. The girl I'm going to marry won't fight."</p>
<pb n="195" entity="DSSR_000002931_0210"/>
<p>"Tom, I reckon they're all alike. They'll all comb a body. Now you better <lb/>
think 'bout this a while. I tell you you better. What's the name of the gal?"</p>
<p>"It ain't a gal at all&mdash;it's a girl."</p>
<p>"It's all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl&mdash;both's right, like <lb/>
enough. Anyway, what's her name, Tom?"</p>
<p>"I'll tell you some time&mdash;not now."</p>
<p>"All right&mdash;that'll do. Only if you get married I'll be more lonesomer than ever."</p>
<p>"No you won't. You'll come and live <lb/>
with me. Now stir out of this and we'll <lb/>
go to digging."</p>
<figure id="f113" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0210">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">business.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>They worked and sweated for half an <lb/>
hour. No result. They toiled another <lb/>
half hour. Still no result. Huck said:</p>
<p>"Do they always bury it as deep as <lb/>
this?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes&mdash;not always. Not <reg orig="gener-|ally">generally</reg>. <lb/>
I reckon we haven't got the right <lb/>
place."</p>
<p>So they chose a new spot and began <lb/>
again. The labor dragged a little, but <lb/>
still they made progress. They pegged <lb/>
away in silence for some time. Finally <lb/>
Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the <lb/>
beaded drops from his brow with his <lb/>
sleeve, and said:</p>
<p>"Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?"</p>
<p>"I reckon maybe we'll tackle the old tree that's over yonder on Cardiff Hill <lb/>
back of the widow's."</p>
<p>"I reckon that'll be a good one. But won't the widow take it away from us <lb/>
Tom? It's on her land."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">She</hi> take it away! Maybe she'd like to try it once. Whoever finds one of <lb/>
these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don't make any difference whose land <lb/>
it's on."</p>
<pb n="196" entity="DSSR_000002931_0211"/>
<p>That was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?"</p>
<p>"It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> mighty curious Huck. I don't understand it. Sometimes witches <reg orig="inter-|fere">interfere</reg>. <lb/>
I reckon maybe that's what's the trouble now."</p>
<p>"Shucks, witches ain't got no power in the daytime."</p>
<p>"Well, that's so. I didn't think of that. Oh, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know what the matter is! <lb/>
What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow of the <lb/>
limb falls at midnight, and that's where you dig!"</p>
<p>"Then consound it, we've fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang it <lb/>
all, we got to come back in the night. It's an awful long way. Can you get out?"</p>
<p>"I bet I will. We've got to do it to night, too, because if some body sees these <lb/>
holes they'll know in a minute what's here and they'll go for it."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll come around and maow to night."</p>
<p>"All right. Let's hide the tools in the bushes."</p>
<p>The boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in the <lb/>
shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by old <reg orig="tra-|ditions">traditions</reg>. <lb/>
Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked in the murky <lb/>
nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance, an owl answered <lb/>
with his sepulchral note. The boys were subdued by these solemnities, and <lb/>
talked little. By and by they judged that twelve had come; they marked where <lb/>
the shadow fell, and began to dig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their <lb/>
interest grew stronger, and their industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened <lb/>
and still deepened, but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike <lb/>
upon something, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone <lb/>
or a chunk. At last Tom said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It ain't any use, Huck, we're wrong again."</p>
<p>"Well but we <hi rend="italic">can't</hi> be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot."</p>
<p>"I know it, but then there's another thing."</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"Why we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too early." <lb/>
Huck dropped his shovel.</p>
<p>"That's it," said he. "That's the very trouble. We got to give this one up. <lb/>
We can't ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing's too awful, here this <lb/>
<pb n="197" entity="DSSR_000002931_0212"/>
time of night with witches and ghosts a fluttering around so. I feel as if something's <lb/>
behind me all the time; and I'm afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there's others <lb/>
in front a-waiting for a chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here."</p>
<p>"Well, I've been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a dead <lb/>
man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it."</p>
<p>"Lordy!"</p>
<p>"Yes, they do. I've always heard that."</p>
<p>"Tom I don't like to fool around much where there's dead people. A body's <lb/>
bound to get into trouble with 'em, sure."</p>
<p>"I don't like to stir 'em up, either. S'pose this one here was to stick his skull <lb/>
out and say something!"</p>
<p>"Don't, Tom! It's awful."</p>
<p>"Well it just is. Huck, I don't feel comfortable a bit."</p>
<p>"Say, Tom, let's give this place up, and try somewheres else."</p>
<p>"All right, I reckon we better."</p>
<p>"What'll it be?"</p>
<p>Tom considered a while; and then said&mdash;</p>
<p>"The ha'nted house. That's it!"</p>
<p>"Blame it, I don't like ha'nted houses Tom. Why they're a dern sight worse'n <lb/>
dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don't come sliding <lb/>
around in a shroud, when you ain't noticing, and peep over your shoulder all of a <lb/>
sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I couldn't stand such a thing <lb/>
as that, Tom&mdash;nobody could."</p>
<p>"Yes, but Huck, ghosts don't travel around only at night. They won't hender <lb/>
us from digging there in the day time."</p>
<p>"Well that's so. But you know mighty well people don't go about that ha'nted <lb/>
house in the day nor the night."</p>
<p>"Well, that's mostly because they don't like to go where a man's been murdered, <lb/>
anyway&mdash;but nothing's ever been seen around that house except in the night&mdash;just <lb/>
some blue lights slipping by the windows&mdash;no regular ghosts."</p>
<p>"Well where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom, you can <lb/>
bet there's a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason. Becuz <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know <lb/>
that they don't anybody but ghosts use 'em."</p>
<pb n="198" entity="DSSR_000002931_0213"/>
<p>"Yes, that's so. But anyway they don't come around in the daytime, so what's <lb/>
the use of our being afeared?"</p>
<p>"Well, all right. We'll tackle the ha'nted house if you say so&mdash;but I reckon <lb/>
it's taking chances."</p>

</figure>
<p>They had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle of the <reg orig="moon-|lit">moonlit</reg> <lb/>
valley below them stood the "ha'nted" house, utterly isolated, its fences gone <lb/>
long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the chimney crumbled to <lb/>
ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof caved in. The boys gazed a <lb/>
while, half expecting to see a blue light flit past a window; then talking in a low <lb/>
tone, as befitted the time and the circumstances, they struck far off to the right, <lb/>
to give the haunted house a wide berth, and took their way homeward through the <lb/>
woods that adorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">About</hi> noon the next day the <lb/>
boys arrived at the dead tree; they <lb/>
had come for their tools. Tom was <lb/>
impatient to go to the haunted <lb/>
house; Huck was measurably so, <lb/>
also&mdash;but suddenly said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Lookyhere, Tom, do you know <lb/>
what day it is?"</p>
<p>Tom mentally ran over the days <lb/>
of the week, and then quickly lifted <lb/>
his eyes with a startled look in <lb/>
them&mdash;</p>
<p>"My! I never once thought of <lb/>
it, Huck!"</p>
<p>"Well I didn't neither, but all at <lb/>
once it popped onto me that it was <lb/>
Friday."</p>
<p>"Blame it, a body can't be too careful, Huck. We might a got into an awful <lb/>
scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday."</p>
<pb n="200" entity="DSSR_000002931_0215"/>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Might!</hi> Better say we <hi rend="italic">would!</hi> There's some lucky days, maybe, but Friday <lb/>
ain't."</p>
<p>"Any fool knows that. I don't reckon <hi rend="italic">you</hi> was the first that found it out, <lb/>
Huck."</p>
<p>"Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain't all, neither. I had a <lb/>
rotten bad dream last night&mdash;dreampt about rats."</p>
<p>"No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Well that's good, Huck. When they don't fight it's only a sign that there's <lb/>
trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty sharp and <lb/>
keep out of it. We'll drop this thing for <reg orig="to-|day">today</reg>, <lb/>
and play. Do you know Robin Hood, <lb/>
Huck?"</p>
<figure id="f116" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0215">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">the greatest and best.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"No. Who's Robin Hood?"</p>
<p>"Why he was one of the greatest men <lb/>
that was ever in England&mdash;and the best. He <lb/>
was a robber."</p>
<p>"Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?"</p>
<p>"Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people <lb/>
and kings, and such like. But he never <lb/>
bothered the poor. He loved 'em. He <reg orig="al-|ways">always</reg> <lb/>
divided up with 'em perfectly square."</p>
<p>"Well, he must 'a' been a brick."</p>
<p>"I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the <lb/>
noblest man that ever was. They ain't any <lb/>
such men now, I can tell you. He could <lb/>
lick any man in England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take <lb/>
his yew bow and plug a ten cent piece every time, a mile and a half."</p>
<p>"What's a <hi rend="italic">yew</hi> bow?"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't know. It's some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that <lb/>
dime only on the edge he would set down and cry&mdash;and curse. But we'll play <lb/>
Robin Hood&mdash;it's noble fun. I'll learn you."</p>
<p>"I'm agreed."</p>
<pb n="201" entity="DSSR_000002931_0216"/>
<p>So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a <lb/>
yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the <lb/>
morrow's prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink into the <lb/>
west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of the trees and <lb/>
soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff Hill.</p>
<p>On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again. They <lb/>
had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their last hole, <lb/>
not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were so many cases <lb/>
where people had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it, <lb/>
and then somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust <lb/>
of a shovel. The thing failed this time, however, so the boys shouldered their <lb/>
tools and went away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune but had <reg orig="ful-|filled">fulfilled</reg> <lb/>
all the requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.</p>
<p>When they reached the haunted house there was something so wierd and grisly <lb/>
about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun, and something <lb/>
so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the place, that they were <lb/>
afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they crept to the door and took a <lb/>
trembling peep. They saw a weed-grown, floorless room, unplastered, an <lb/>
ancient fireplace, vacant windows, a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and <lb/>
everywhere, hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, <lb/>
softly, with quickened pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the <reg orig="slight-|est">slightest</reg> <lb/>
sound, and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.</p>
<p>In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the place a <lb/>
critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own boldness, and <lb/>
wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look up stairs. This was <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring each other, and of course <lb/>
there could be but one result&mdash;they threw their tools into a corner and made <lb/>
the ascent. Up there were the same signs of decay. In one corner they found <lb/>
a closet that promised mystery, but the promise was a fraud&mdash;there was <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg> <lb/>
in it. Their courage was up now and well in hand. They were about to go <lb/>
down and begin work when&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sh!" said Tom.</p>
<p>"What is it?" whispered Huck, blanching with fright.</p>
<pb n="202" entity="DSSR_000002931_0217"/>
<p>"Sh! ..... There! ..... Hear it?"</p>
<p>"Yes! ..... O, my! Let's run!"</p>
<p>"Keep still! Don't you budge! They're coming right toward the door."</p>
<p>The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to knot holes <lb/>
in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.</p>
<p>"They've stopped ...... No&mdash;coming ...... Here they are. Don't <lb/>
whisper another word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!"</p>
<p>Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: "There's the old deaf and <lb/>
dumb Spaniard that's been about town once or twice lately&mdash;never saw t'other <lb/>
man before."</p>
<p>"T'other" was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant in <lb/>
his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a <hi rend="italic">serap&egrave;;</hi> he had bushy white <reg orig="whisk-|ers">whiskers</reg>; <lb/>
long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore green <reg orig="gog-|gles">goggles</reg>. <lb/>
When they came in, "t'other" was talking in a low voice; they sat down <lb/>
on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the wall, and the speaker <lb/>
continued his remarks. His manner became less guarded and his words more <lb/>
distinct as he proceeded:</p>
<p>"No," said he, "I've thought it all over, and I don't like it. It's dangerous."</p>
<p>"Dangerous!" grunted the "deaf and dumb" Spaniard,&mdash;to the vast <reg orig="sur-|prise">surprise</reg> <lb/>
of the boys. "Milksop!"</p>
<p>This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe's! There was <lb/>
silence for some time. Then Joe said:</p>
<p>"What's any more dangerous than that job up yonder&mdash;but nothing's come <lb/>
of it."</p>
<p>"That's different. Away up the river so, and not another house about. <lb/>
'Twon't ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn't succeed."</p>
<p>"Well, what's more dangerous than coming here in the day time!&mdash;anybody <lb/>
would suspicion us that saw us."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">I</hi> know that. But there warn't any other place as handy after that fool of <lb/>
a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it warn't any <lb/>
use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys playing over there on <lb/>
the hill right in full view."</p>
<pb n="203" entity="DSSR_000002931_0218"/>
<p>"Those infernal boys," quaked again under the inspiration of this remark, <lb/>
and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and <lb/>
concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had waited a year.</p>
<p>The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and <lb/>
thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:</p>
<p>"Look here, lad&mdash;you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there <lb/>
till you hear from me. I'll take the chances on dropping into this town just <lb/>
once more, for a look. We'll do that 'dangerous' job after I've spied around a <lb/>
little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas! We'll leg it <lb/>
together!"</p>
<p>This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"I'm dead for sleep! It's your turn to watch."</p>
<p>He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred <lb/>
him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to nod; <lb/>
his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.</p>
<p>The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered&mdash;</p>
<p>"Now's our chance&mdash;come!"</p>
<p>Huck said:</p>
<p>"I can't&mdash;I'd die if they was to wake."</p>
<p>Tom urged&mdash;Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and <lb/>
started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak from <lb/>
the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never made a <lb/>
second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging moments till it <lb/>
seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray; and then <lb/>
they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.</p>
<p>Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around&mdash;smiled grimly <lb/>
upon his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees&mdash;stirred him up <lb/>
with his foot and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Here! <hi rend="italic">You're</hi> a watchman, ain't you! All right, though&mdash;nothing's <lb/>
happened."</p>
<p>"My! have I been asleep?"</p>
<pb n="204" entity="DSSR_000002931_0219"/>
<p>"Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What'll we do <lb/>
with what little swag we've got left?"</p>
<p>"I don't know&mdash;leave it here as we've always done, I reckon. No use to take <lb/>
it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver's something to <lb/>
carry."</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;all right&mdash;it won't matter to come here once more."</p>
<p>"No&mdash;but I'd say come in the night as we used to do&mdash;it's better."</p>
<p>"Yes; but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right chance <lb/>
at that job; accidents might happen; 'tain't in such a very good place; we'll <lb/>
just regularly bury it&mdash;and bury it deep."</p>
<p>"Good idea," said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down, <lb/>
raised one of the rearward hearthstones and took out a bag that jingled <reg orig="pleas-|antly">pleasantly</reg>. <lb/>
He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself and as much <lb/>
for Injun Joe and passed the bag to the latter, who was on his knees in the <lb/>
corner, now, digging with his bowie knife.</p>
<p>The boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. With <reg orig="gloat-|ing">gloating</reg> <lb/>
eyes they watched every movement. Luck!&mdash;the splendor of it was <lb/>
beyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make <lb/>
half a dozen boys rich! Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest <reg orig="aus-|pices&mdash;there">auspices&mdash;there</reg> <lb/>
would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to dig. <lb/>
They nudged each other every moment&mdash;eloquent nudges and easily <reg orig="under-|stood">understood</reg>, <lb/>
for they simply meant&mdash;"O, but ain't you glad <hi rend="italic">now</hi> we're here!"</p>
<p>Joe's knife struck upon something.</p>
<p>"Hello!" said he.</p>
<p>"What is it?" said his comrade.</p>
<p>"Half-rotten plank&mdash;no it's a box, I believe. Here&mdash;bear a hand and we'll <lb/>
see what it's here for. Never mind, I've broke a hole."</p>
<p>He reached his hand in and drew it out&mdash;</p>
<p>"Man, it's money!"</p>
<p>The two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys <lb/>
above were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.</p>
<p>Joe's comrade said&mdash;</p>
<pb n="205" entity="DSSR_000002931_0220"/>
<p>"We'll make quick work of this. There's an old rusty pick over amongst <lb/>
the weeds in the corner the other side of the fire-place&mdash;I saw it a minute ago."</p>
<p>He ran and brought the boys' pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the pick, <lb/>
looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to himself, and <lb/>
then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was not very large; <lb/>
it was iron bound and had been very strong before the slow years had injured <lb/>
it. The men contemplated the treasure a while in blissful silence.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">hidden treasures unearthed.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"Pard, there's thousands of dollars here," said Injun Joe.</p>
<p>"'Twas always said that Murrel's gang used around here one summer," the <lb/>
stranger observed.</p>
<p>"I know it," said Injun Joe; "and this looks like it, I should say."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Now</hi> you won't need to do that job."</p>
<p>The half-breed frowned. Said he&mdash;</p>
<p>"You don't know me. Least you don't know all about that thing. 'Tain't <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="DSSR_000002931_0221"/>
robbery altogether&mdash;it's <hi rend="italic">revenge!</hi>" and a wicked light flamed in his eyes. "I'll <lb/>
need your help in it. When it's finished&mdash;then Texas. Go home to your <lb/>
Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me."</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;if you say so, what'll we do with this&mdash;bury it again?"</p>
<p>"Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] <hi rend="italic">No!</hi> by the great Sachem, no! <lb/>
[Profound distress overhead.] I'd nearly forgot. That pick had fresh earth <lb/>
on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What business has <lb/>
a pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth on them? Who <lb/>
brought them here&mdash;and where are they gone? Have you heard anybody?&mdash; <lb/>
seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and see the <lb/>
ground disturbed? Not exactly&mdash;not exactly. We'll take it to my den."</p>
<p>"Why of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number <lb/>
One?"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;Number Two&mdash;under the cross. The other place is bad&mdash;too <lb/>
common."</p>
<p>"All right. It's nearly dark enough to start."</p>
<p>Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously <reg orig="peep-|ing">peeping</reg> <lb/>
out. Presently he said:</p>
<p>"Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be up <lb/>
stairs?"</p>
<p>The boys' breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife, halted <lb/>
a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The boys thought <lb/>
of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came creaking up the <lb/>
stairs&mdash;the intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of <lb/>
the lads&mdash;they were about to spring for the closet, when there was a crash of <lb/>
rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on the ground amid the <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;bris</hi> of the <lb/>
ruined stairway. He gathered himself up cursing, and his comrade said:</p>
<p>"Now what's the use of all that? If it's anybody, and they're up there, let <lb/>
them <hi rend="italic">stay</hi> there&mdash;who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and get into <lb/>
trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes&mdash;and then let them <lb/>
follow us if they want to. I'm willing. In my opinion, whoever hove those <lb/>
things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or devils or <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg>. <lb/>
I'll bet they're running yet."</p>
<pb n="207" entity="DSSR_000002931_0222"/>
<p>Joe grumbled a while; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight <lb/>
was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving. Shortly <lb/>
afterward they slipped out of the house <lb/>
in the deepening twilight, and moved <lb/>
toward the river with their precious <lb/>
box.</p>

</figure>
<p>Tom and Huck rose up, weak but <lb/>
vastly relieved, and stared after them <lb/>
through the chinks between the logs of <lb/>
the house. Follow? Not they. They <lb/>
were content to reach ground again <lb/>
without broken necks, and take the <lb/>
townward track over the hill. They <lb/>
did not talk much. They were too <lb/>
much absorbed in hating themselves&mdash; <lb/>
hating the ill luck that made them take <lb/>
the spade and the pick there. But for <lb/>
that, Injun Joe never would have <reg orig="sus-|pected">suspected</reg>. <lb/>
He would have hidden the <lb/>
silver with the gold to wait there till his "revenge" was satisfied, and then he <lb/>
would have had the misfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, <lb/>
bitter luck that the tools were ever brought there!</p>
<p>They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to town <lb/>
spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to "Number <lb/>
Two," wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred to Tom:</p>
<p>"Revenge?" What if he means <hi rend="italic">us</hi>, Huck!"</p>
<p>"O, don't!" said Huck, nearly fainting.</p>
<p>They talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe that <lb/>
he might possibly mean somebody else&mdash;at least that he might at least mean<lb/>
nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.</p>
<p>Very, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company <lb/>
would be a palpable improvement, he thought.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> adventure of the day mightily <reg orig="tor-|mented">tormented</reg> <lb/>
Tom's dreams that night. <lb/>
Four times he had his hands on that <lb/>
rich treasure and four times it wasted <lb/>
to nothingness in his fingers as sleep <lb/>
forsook him and wakefulness brought <lb/>
back the hard reality of his <reg orig="misfor-|tune">misfortune</reg>. <lb/>
As he lay in the early morning <lb/>
recalling the incidents of his great <reg orig="ad-|venture">adventure</reg>, <lb/>
he noticed that they seemed <lb/>
curiously subdued and far away &mdash; <lb/>
somewhat as if they had happened in <lb/>
another world, or in a time long gone <lb/>
by. Then it occurred to him that <lb/>
the great adventure itself must be <lb/>
a dream! There was one very strong <lb/>
argument in favor of this idea &mdash; <lb/>
namely, that the quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had <lb/>
never seen as much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of <lb/>
<pb n="209" entity="DSSR_000002931_0224"/>
his age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to "hundreds" <lb/>
and "thousands" were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that no such sums <lb/>
really existed in the world. He never had supposed for a moment that so large a <lb/>
sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any one's <reg orig="posses-|sion">possession</reg>. <lb/>
If his notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed, they would have been <lb/>
found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, <lb/>
ungraspable dollars.</p>
<figure id="f120" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0224">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">the next day's conference.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer under the <lb/>
attrition of thinking them over, and so he <lb/>
presently found himself leaning to the <lb/>
impression that the thing might not have <lb/>
been a dream, after all. This uncertainty <lb/>
must be swept away. He would snatch a <lb/>
hurried breakfast and go and find Huck.</p>
<p>Huck was sitting on the gunwale of a <lb/>
flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the <lb/>
water and looking very melancholy. Tom <lb/>
concluded to let Huck lead up to the <reg orig="sub-|ject">subject</reg>. <lb/>
If he did not do it, then the <reg orig="adven-|ture">adventure</reg> <lb/>
would be proved to have been only <lb/>
a dream.</p>
<p>"Hello, Huck!"</p>
<p>"Hello, yourself."</p>
<p>Silence, for a minute.</p>
<p>"Tom, if we'd a left the blame tools at <lb/>
the dead tree, we'd 'a' got the money. O, ain't it awful!"</p>
<p>" 'Tain't a dream, then, 'tain't a dream! Somehow I most wish it was. Dog'd <lb/>
if I don't, Huck."</p>
<p>"What ain't a dream?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was."</p>
<p>"Dream! If them stairs hadn't broke down you'd 'a' seen how much dream it <lb/>
was! I've had dreams enough all night&mdash;with that patch-eyed Spanish devil <lb/>
going for me all through 'em&mdash;rot him!"</p>
<pb n="210" entity="DSSR_000002931_0225"/>
<p>"No, not rot him. <hi rend="italic">Find</hi> him! Track the money!"</p>
<p>"Tom, we'll never find him. A feller don't have only once chance for such a <lb/>
pile&mdash;and that one's lost. I'd feel mighty shaky if I was to see him, anyway."</p>
<p>"Well, so'd I; but I'd like to see him, anyway&mdash;and track him out&mdash;to his <lb/>
Number Two."</p>
<p>"Number Two&mdash;yes, that's it. I ben thinking 'bout that. But I can't make <lb/>
nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?"</p>
<p>"I dono. It's too deep. Say, Huck&mdash;maybe it's the number of a house!"</p>
<p>"Goody! ...... No, Tom, that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in this one-horse <lb/>
town. They ain't no numbers here."</p>
<p>"Well, that's so. Lemme think a minute. Here&mdash;it's the number of a room&mdash; <lb/>
in a tavern, you know!"</p>
<p>"O, that's the trick! They ain't only two taverns. We can find out quick."</p>
<p>"You stay here, Huck, till I come."</p>
<p>Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck's company in public <lb/>
places. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No. 2 had <lb/>
long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied. In the less <lb/>
ostentatious house No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper's young son said it <lb/>
was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody go into it or come out of <lb/>
it except at night; he did not know any particular reason for this state of things; <lb/>
had had some little curiosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the <lb/>
mystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was "ha'nted;" had <lb/>
noticed that there was a light in there the night before.</p>
<p>"That's what I've found out, Huck. I reckon that's the very No. 2 we're after."</p>
<p>"I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?"</p>
<p>"Lemme think."</p>
<p>Tom thought a long time. Then he said:</p>
<p>"I'll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out into <lb/>
that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle-trap of a brick store. <lb/>
Now you get hold of all the door-keys you can find, and I'll nip all of Auntie's and <lb/>
the first dark night we'll go there and try 'em. And mind you keep a lookout <lb/>
for Injun Joe, because he said he was going to drop into town and spy around <lb/>
<pb n="211" entity="DSSR_000002931_0226"/>
once more for a chance to get his revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; <lb/>
and if he don't go to that No. 2, that ain't the place."</p>
<p>"Lordy I don't want to foller him by myself!"</p>
<p>"Why it'll be night, sure. He mightn't ever see you&mdash;and if he did, maybe <lb/>
he'd never think anything."</p>
<p>"Well, if it's pretty dark I reckon I'll track him. I dono&mdash;I dono. I'll try."</p>
<p>"You bet <hi rend="italic">I</hi>'ll follow him, if it's dark, Huck. Why he might 'a' found out he <lb/>
couldn't get his revenge, and be going right after that money."</p>
<p>"It's so, Tom, it's so. I'll foller him; I will, by jingoes!"</p>
<p>"Now you're <hi rend="italic">talking!</hi> Don't you ever weaken, Huck, and I won't."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">That</hi> night Tom and Huck were <lb/>
ready for their adventure. They <lb/>
hung about the neighborhood of the <lb/>
tavern until after nine, one watching <lb/>
the alley at a distance and the other <lb/>
the tavern door. Nobody entered <lb/>
the alley or left it; nobody <reg orig="resem-|bling">resembling</reg> <lb/>
the Spaniard entered or left <lb/>
the tavern door. The night <reg orig="prom-|ised">promised</reg> <lb/>
to be a fair one; so Tom went <lb/>

a considerable degree of darkness <lb/>
came on, Huck was to come and <lb/>
"maow," whereupon he would slip <lb/>
out and try the keys. But the night <lb/>
remained clear, and Huck closed <lb/>
his watch and retired to bed in an <lb/>
empty sugar hogshead about twelve.</p>
<p>Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday <lb/>
night promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt's old tin <lb/>
<pb n="213" entity="DSSR_000002931_0228"/>
lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the lantern in Huck's sugar <lb/>
hogshead and the watch began. An hour before midnight the tavern closed up <lb/>
and its lights (the only ones <reg orig="there-|abouts)">thereabouts)</reg> <lb/>
were put out. No Spaniard <lb/>
had been seen. Nobody had entered <lb/>
or left the alley. Everything was <reg orig="aus-|picious">auspicious</reg>. <lb/>

</figure>
<p>Tom got his lantern, lit it in the <reg orig="hogs-|head">hogshead</reg>, <lb/>
wrapped it closely in the towel, <lb/>
and the two adventurers crept in the <lb/>
gloom toward the tavern. Huck stood <lb/>
sentry and Tom felt his way into the <lb/>
alley. Then there was a season of <lb/>
waiting anxiety that weighed upon <lb/>
Huck's spirits like a mountain. He <lb/>
began to wish he could see a flash <lb/>
from the lantern&mdash;it would frighten <lb/>
him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive yet. It seemed hours since <lb/>
Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have fainted; maybe he was dead; <lb/>
maybe his heart had burst under terror and excitement. In his uneasiness Huck <lb/>
found himself drawing closer and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful <lb/>
things, and momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take <lb/>
away his breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to <lb/>
inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the way it was <lb/>
beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came tearing by him:</p>
<p>"Run!" said he; "run, for your life!"</p>
<p>He needn't have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or <lb/>
forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never stopped <lb/>
till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the lower end of the <lb/>
<pb n="214" entity="DSSR_000002931_0229"/>
village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured <lb/>
down. As soon as Tom got his breath he said:</p>
<p>"Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could; but they <lb/>
seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn't hardly get my breath I <lb/>
was so scared. They wouldn't turn in the lock, either. Well, without noticing <lb/>
what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and open comes the door! It warn't <lb/>
locked! I hopped in, and shook off the towel, and, <hi rend="italic">great C&oelig;sar's ghost!</hi>"</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;what'd you see, Tom!"</p>
<p>"Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe's hand!"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Yes! He was laying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch on <lb/>
his eye and his arms spread out."</p>
<p>"Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?"</p>
<pb n="215" entity="DSSR_000002931_0230"/>

<p>'I'd never 'a' thought of the towel, I bet!"</p>
<p>"Well, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it."</p>
<p>"Say, Tom, did you see that box?"</p>
<p>"Huck I didn't wait to look around. I didn't see the box, I didn't see the <lb/>
cross. I didn't see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by Injun Joe; <lb/>
yes, and I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room. Don't you see, now, <lb/>
what's the matter with that ha'nted room?"</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"Why it's ha'nted with whisky! Maybe <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Temperance Taverns have got <lb/>
a ha'nted room, hey Huck?"</p>
<p>"Well I reckon maybe that's so. Who'd 'a' thought such a thing? But say, <lb/>
Tom, now's a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe's drunk."</p>
<p>"It is, that! You try it!"</p>
<p>Huck shuddered.</p>
<p>"Well, no&mdash;I reckon not."</p>
<p>"And <hi rend="italic">I</hi> reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain't <lb/>
enough. If there'd been three, he'd be drunk enough and I'd do it."</p>
<p>There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:</p>
<p>"Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun Joe's <lb/>
not in there. It's too scary. Now if we watch every night, we'll be dead sure to <lb/>
see him go out, some time or other, and then we'll snatch that box quicker'n <lb/>
lightning."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm agreed. I'll watch the whole night long, and I'll do it every night, <lb/>
too, if you'll do the other part of the job."</p>
<p>"All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper street a block and <lb/>
maow&mdash;and if I'm asleep, you throw some gravel at the window and that'll fetch <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>"Agreed, and good as wheat!"</p>
<p>"Now Huck, the storm's over, and I'll go home. It'll begin to be daylight in <lb/>
a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will you?"</p>
<p>"I said I would, Tom, and I will. I'll ha'nt that tavern every night for a year! <lb/>
I'll sleep all day and I'll stand watch all night."</p>
<pb n="216" entity="DSSR_000002931_0231"/>
<p>"That's all right. Now where you going to sleep?"</p>
<p>"In Ben Rogers's hayloft. He let's me, and so does his pap's nigger man, <lb/>
Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any time <lb/>
I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it. That's a <lb/>

him. Sometimes I've set right down and eat <hi rend="italic">with</hi> him. But you needn't tell that. <lb/>
A body's got to do things when he's awful hungry he wouldn't want to do as a <lb/>

<p>"Well, if I don't want you in the day time, I'll let you sleep. I won't come <lb/>

morning was a glad piece of <lb/>
news&mdash;Judge Thatcher's family had <lb/>
come back to town the night before. <lb/>
Both Injun Joe and the treasure <lb/>
sunk into secondary importance for <lb/>
a moment, and Becky took the chief <lb/>
place in the boy's interest. He saw <lb/>
her and they had an exhausting <lb/>
good time playing "hi-spy" and <lb/>
"gully-keeper" with a crowd of <lb/>
their schoolmates. The day was <lb/>
completed and crowned in a <reg orig="pecul-|iarly">peculiarly</reg> <lb/>

her mother to appoint the next day <lb/>
for the long-promised and <reg orig="long-|delayed">long-delayed</reg> <lb/>
picnic, and she consented. <lb/>
The child's delight was boundless; and Tom's not more moderate. The <reg orig="invi-|tations">invitations</reg> <lb/>
were sent out before sunset, and straightway the young folks of the <lb/>
<pb n="218" entity="DSSR_000002931_0233"/>
village were thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation. <lb/>
Tom's excitement enabled him to keep awake until a pretty late hour, and he had <lb/>
good hopes of hearing Huck's "maow," and of having his treasure to astonish. <lb/>
Becky and the pic-nickers with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal <lb/>
came that night.</p>
<p>Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy and rollicking <lb/>
company were gathered at Judge Thatcher's, and everything was ready for a start. <lb/>
It was not the custom for elderly people to mar pic-nics with their presence. The <lb/>
children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of <lb/>
eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old <lb/>
steam ferry-boat was chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed <lb/>
up the main street laden with provision baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss the <lb/>
fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs. Thatcher <lb/>
said to Becky, was&mdash;</p>
<p>"You'll not get back till late. Perhaps you'd better stay all night with some <lb/>
of the girls that live near the ferry landing, child."</p>
<p>"Then I'll stay with Susy Harper, mamma."</p>
<p>"Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don't be any trouble."</p>
<p>Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:</p>
<p>"Say&mdash;I'll tell you what we'll do. 'Stead of going to Joe Harper's we'll climb <lb/>
right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas's. She'll have ice cream! She <lb/>
has it most every day&mdash;dead loads of it. And she'll be awful glad to have us."</p>
<p>"O, that will be fun!"</p>
<p>Then Becky reflected a moment and said:</p>
<p>"But what will mamma say?"</p>
<p>"How'll she ever know?"</p>
<p>The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:</p>
<p>"I reckon it's wrong&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But shucks! Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm? All she <lb/>
wants is that you'll be safe; and I bet you she'd 'a' said go there if she'd 'a' <lb/>
thought of it. I know she would!"</p>
<p>The widow Douglas's splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and Tom's <lb/>
<pb n="219" entity="DSSR_000002931_0234"/>
persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say nothing to <reg orig="any-|body">anybody</reg> <lb/>
about the night's programme. Presently it occurred to Tom that maybe <lb/>
Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The thought took a deal <lb/>
of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he could not bear to give up the fun at <lb/>
Widow Douglas's. And why should he give it up, he reasoned&mdash;the signal did <lb/>
not come the night before, so why should it be any more likely to come to-night? <lb/>
The sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and boy like, he <lb/>
determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of <lb/>
the box of money another time that day.</p>
<p>Three miles below town the ferry-boat stopped at the mouth of a woody hollow <lb/>
and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and <lb/>
craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter. All the different <lb/>
ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with, and by and by the rovers <lb/>
straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites, and then the <reg orig="destruc-|tion">destruction</reg> <lb/>
of the good things began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of <lb/>
rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks. By and by somebody shouted&mdash;</p>
<p>"Who's ready for the cave?"</p>
<p>Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there was <lb/>
a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the hillside&mdash;an <lb/>
opening shaped like a letter A. It's massive oaken door stood unbarred. Within <lb/>
was a small chamber, chilly as an ice-house, and walled by Nature with solid <lb/>
limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was romantic and mysterious to <lb/>
stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the <lb/>
sun. But the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off, and the romping <lb/>
began again. The moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon <lb/>
the owner of it; a struggle and a gallant defense followed, but the candle was <lb/>
soon knocked down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter <lb/>
and a new chase. But all things have an end. By and by the procession went <lb/>
filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of lights <lb/>
dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet <lb/>
overhead. This main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide. Every <lb/>
few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand <lb/>
<pb n="220" entity="DSSR_000002931_0235"/>
&mdash;for McDougal's cave was but a vast <lb/>
labyrinth of crooked isles that ran into <lb/>
each other and out again and led nowhere. <lb/>
It was said that one might wander days <lb/>
and nights together through its intricate <lb/>
tangle of rifts and chasms, and never find <lb/>
the end of the cave; and that he might go <lb/>
down, and down, and still down, into the <lb/>
earth, and it was just the same&mdash;labyrinth <lb/>
underneath labyrinth, and no end to any of <lb/>
them. No man "knew" the cave. That <lb/>
was an impossible thing. Most of the <lb/>
young men knew a portion of it, and it <lb/>
was not customary to venture much beyond <lb/>
this known portion. Tom Sawyer knew as <lb/>
much of the cave as any one.</p>
<figure id="f127" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0235"/>
<p>The procession moved along the main <lb/>
avenue some three-quarters of a mile, and <lb/>
then groups and couples began to slip <lb/>
aside into branch avenues, fly along the <lb/>
dismal corridors, and take each other by <lb/>
surprise at points where the corridors <lb/>
joined again. Parties were able to elude <lb/>
each other for the space of half an hour <lb/>
without going beyond the "known" ground.</p>
<p>By and by, one group after another came <lb/>
straggling back to the mouth of the cave, <lb/>
panting, hilarious, smeared from head to <lb/>
foot with tallow drippings, daubed with clay, <lb/>
and entirely delighted with the success of <lb/>
the day. Then they were astonished to <lb/>
find that they had been taking no note of <lb/>
<pb n="221" entity="DSSR_000002931_0236"/>
time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had been calling for <lb/>
half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day's adventures was romantic <lb/>
and therefore satisfactory. When the ferry-boat with her wild freight pushed into <lb/>
the stream, nobody cared sixpence for the wasted time but the captain of the <lb/>
craft.</p>
<p>Huck was already upon his watch when the ferry-boat's lights went glinting past <lb/>
the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young people were as subdued and <lb/>
still as people usually are who are nearly tired to death. He wondered what boat <lb/>
it was, and why she did not stop at the wharf&mdash;and then he dropped her out of his <lb/>
mind and put his attention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and <lb/>
dark. Ten o'clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began <lb/>
to wink out, all straggling foot passengers disappeared, the village betook itself <lb/>
to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence and the ghosts. <lb/>
Eleven o'clock came, and the tavern <lb/>
lights were put out; darkness <reg orig="every-|where">everywhere</reg>, <lb/>
now. Huck waited what seemed <lb/>
a weary long time, but nothing happened. <lb/>
His faith was weakening. Was there any <lb/>
use? Was there really any use? Why <lb/>
not give it up and turn in?</p>
<figure id="f128" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0236">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">huck on duty.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>A noise fell upon his ear. He was all <lb/>
attention in an instant. The alley door <lb/>
closed softly. He sprang to the corner of <lb/>
the brick store. The next moment two <lb/>
men brushed by him, and one seemed to <lb/>
have something under his arm. It must <lb/>
be that box! So they were going to <reg orig="re-|move">remove</reg> <lb/>
the treasure. Why call Tom now? <lb/>
It would be absurd&mdash;the men would get <lb/>
away with the box and never be found <lb/>
again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow them; he would trust to the <lb/>
darkness for security from discovery. So communing with himself, Huck stepped <lb/>
<pb n="222" entity="DSSR_000002931_0237"/>
out and glided along behind the men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to <lb/>
keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible.</p>
<p>They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up a cross <lb/>
street. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the path that led up <lb/>
Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old Welchman's house, half way <lb/>
up the hill without hesitating, and still climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, <lb/>
they will bury it in the old quarry. But they never stopped at the quarry. They <lb/>
passed on, up the summit. They plunged into the narrow path between the tall <lb/>
sumach bushes, and were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and <lb/>
shortened his distance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted <lb/>
along a while; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved <lb/>
on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that he <lb/>
seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an owl came from <lb/>
over the hill&mdash;ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was everything lost! <lb/>
He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man cleared his throat not four <lb/>
feet from him! Huck's heart shot into his throat, but he swallowed it again; and <lb/>
then he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, <lb/>
and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where <lb/>
he was. He knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow <reg orig="Doug-|las's">Douglas's</reg> <lb/>
grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won't be hard to <lb/>
find.</p>
<p>Now there was a voice&mdash;a very low voice&mdash;Injun Joe's:</p>
<p>"Damn her, maybe she's got company&mdash;there's lights, late as it is."</p>
<p>"I can't see any."</p>
<p>This was that stranger's voice&mdash;the stranger of the haunted house. A deadly <lb/>
chill went to Huck's heart&mdash;this, then, was the "revenge" job! His thought was, <lb/>
to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been kind to him more <lb/>
than once, and maybe these men were going to murder her. He wished he dared <lb/>
venture to warn her; but he knew he didn't dare&mdash;they might come and catch <lb/>
him. He thought all this and more in the moment that elapsed between the <lb/>
stranger's remark and Injun Joe's next&mdash;which was&mdash;</p>
<p>"Because the bush is in your way. Now&mdash;this way&mdash;now you see, don't you?"</p>
<pb n="223" entity="DSSR_000002931_0238"/>
<p>"Yes. Well there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> company there, I reckon. Better give it up."</p>
<p>"Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and maybe <lb/>
never have another chance. I tell you again, as I've told you before, I don't care <lb/>
for her swag&mdash;you may have it. But her husband was rough on me&mdash;many times <lb/>
he was rough on me&mdash;and mainly he was the justice of the peace that jugged me <lb/>
for a vagrant. And that ain't all. It ain't a millionth part of it! He had me <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">horsewhipped!</hi>&mdash;horsewhipped in front of the jail, like a nigger!&mdash;with all the town <lb/>
looking on! <hi rend="small-caps">Horsewhipped</hi>!&mdash;do you understand? He took advantage of me <lb/>
and died. But I'll take it out of <hi rend="italic">her</hi>."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't kill her! Don't do that!"</p>
<p>"Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill <hi rend="italic">him</hi> if he was here; <lb/>
but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don't kill her&mdash; <lb/>
bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils&mdash;you notch her ears like a <lb/>
sow!"</p>
<p>"By God, that's&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I'll tie her to the <lb/>
bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I'll not cry, if she does. My <lb/>
friend, you'll help in this thing&mdash;for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sake&mdash;that's why you're here&mdash;I mightn't <lb/>
be able alone. If you flinch, I'll kill you. Do you understand that? And if I <lb/>
have to kill you, I'll kill her&mdash;and then I reckon nobody'll ever know much about <lb/>
who done this business."</p>
<p>"Well, if it's got to be done, let's get at it. The quicker the better&mdash;I'm all in <lb/>
a shiver."</p>
<p>"Do it <hi rend="italic">now?</hi> And company there? Look here&mdash;I'll get suspicious of you, <lb/>
first thing you know. No&mdash;we'll wait till the lights are out&mdash;there's no hurry."</p>
<p>Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue&mdash;a thing still more awful than any <lb/>
amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped gingerly back; <lb/>
planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing, one-legged, in a precarious <lb/>
way and almost toppling over, first on one side and then on the other. He took <lb/>
another step back, with the same elaboration and the same risks; then another <lb/>
and another, and&mdash;a twig snapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he <lb/>
listened. There was no sound&mdash;the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="DSSR_000002931_0239"/>
measureless. Now he turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes <lb/>
&mdash;turned himself as carefully as if he were a ship&mdash;and then stepped quickly but <lb/>
cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and so he picked <lb/>
up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he reached the <reg orig="Welch-|man's">Welchman's</reg>. <lb/>
He banged at the door, and presently the heads of the old man and his <lb/>
two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.</p>
<figure id="f129" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0239">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">a rousing act.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"What's the row there? Who's banging? What do you want?"</p>
<p>"Let me in&mdash;quick! I'll tell everything."</p>
<p>"Why who are you?"</p>
<p>"Huckleberry Finn&mdash;quick, let me in!"</p>
<p>"Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain't a name to open many doors, I judge! <lb/>
But let him in, lads, and let's see what's the trouble."</p>
<p>"Please don't ever tell <hi rend="italic">I</hi> told you," were Huck's first words when he got in</p>
<pb n="225" entity="DSSR_000002931_0240"/>
<p>"Please don't&mdash;I'd be killed, sure&mdash;but the Widow's been good friends to me <lb/>
sometimes, and I want to tell&mdash;I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> tell if you'll promise you won't ever say it <lb/>
was me."</p>
<p>"By George he <hi rend="italic">has</hi> got something to tell, or he wouldn't act so!" exclaimed <lb/>
the old man; "out with it and nobody here'll ever tell, lad."</p>
<p>Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the hill, and <lb/>
just entering the sumach path on tip-toe, their weapons in their hands. Huck <lb/>
accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great bowlder and fell to <reg orig="listen-|ing">listening</reg>. <lb/>
There was a lagging, anxious silence, and then all of a sudden there was an <lb/>
explosion of firearms and a cry.</p>
<p>Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as <lb/>
fast as his legs could carry him.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">As</hi> the earliest suspicion of dawn <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
on Sunday morning, Huck <lb/>
came groping up the hill and rapped <lb/>
gently at the old Welchman's door. <lb/>
The inmates were asleep but it was <lb/>
a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger, <lb/>
on account of the exciting episode <lb/>
of the night. A call came from a <lb/>
window&mdash;</p>
<p>"Who's there!"</p>
<p>Huck's scared voice answered in a <lb/>
low tone:</p>
<p>"Please let me in! It's only Huck <lb/>
Finn!"</p>
<p>"It's a name that can open this door <lb/>
night or day, lad!&mdash;and welcome!"</p>
<p>These were strange words to the <lb/>
vagabond boy's ears, and the pleasantest he had ever heard. He could not <reg orig="rec-|ollect">recollect</reg> <lb/>
that the closing word had ever been applied in his case before. The door <lb/>
<pb n="227" entity="DSSR_000002931_0242"/>
was quickly unlocked, and he entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man <lb/>
and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves.</p>
<p>"Now my boy I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast will be ready <lb/>
as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping hot one, too&mdash;make yourself easy <lb/>
about that! I and the boys hoped you'd turn up and stop here last night."</p>
<p>"I was awful scared," said Huck, "and I run. I took out when the pistols <lb/>
went off, and I didn't stop for three mile. I've come now becuz I wanted to know <lb/>
about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn't want to run acrost <lb/>
them devils, even if they was dead."</p>
<figure id="f132" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0242">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">result of a sneeze.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"Well, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of it&mdash;but there's <lb/>
a bed here for you when you've had your <lb/>
breakfast. No, they ain't dead, lad&mdash;we <lb/>
are sorry enough for that. You see we <lb/>
knew right where to put our hands on <lb/>
them, by your description; so we crept <lb/>
along on tip-toe till we got within fifteen <lb/>
feet of them&mdash;dark as a cellar that sumach <lb/>
path was&mdash;and just then I found I was <lb/>
going to sneeze. It was the meanest kind <lb/>
of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no <lb/>
use&mdash;'twas bound to come, and it did <lb/>
come! I was in the lead with my pistol <lb/>
raised, and when the sneeze started those <lb/>
scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the <lb/>
path, I sung out, 'Fire, boys!' and blazed <lb/>
away at the place where the rustling was. <lb/>
So did the boys. But they were off in a <lb/>
jiffy, those villains, and we after them, down through the woods. I judge we <lb/>
never touched them. They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets <lb/>
whizzed by and didn't do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their <lb/>
feet we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got <lb/>
a posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it is <lb/>
<pb n="228" entity="DSSR_000002931_0243"/>
light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys will be <lb/>
with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of those rascals&mdash; <lb/>
'twould help a good deal. But you could'nt see what they were like, in the dark, <lb/>
lad, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"O, yes, I saw them down town and follered them."</p>
<p>"Splendid! Describe them&mdash;describe them, my boy!"</p>
<p>"One's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that's ben around here once or twice, <lb/>
and t'other's a mean looking ragged&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That's enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods <lb/>
back of the widow's one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and tell <lb/>
the sheriff&mdash;get your breakfast to-morrow morning!"</p>
<p>The Welchman's sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck <lb/>
sprang up and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Oh, please don't tell <hi rend="italic">any</hi>body it was me that blowed on them! Oh, please!"</p>
<p>"All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what you did."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, no! Please don't tell!"</p>
<p>When the young men were gone, the old Welchman said&mdash;</p>
<p>"They won't tell&mdash;and I won't. But why don't you want it known?"</p>
<p>Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too much <lb/>
about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything <lb/>
against him for the whole world&mdash;he would be killed for knowing it, sure.</p>
<p>The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:</p>
<p>"How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking suspicious?"</p>
<p>Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:</p>
<p>"Well, you see, I'm a kind of a hard lot,&mdash;least everybody says so, and I don't <lb/>
see nothing agin it&mdash;and sometimes I can't sleep much, on accounts of thinking <lb/>
about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing. That was the way <lb/>
of it last night. I couldn't sleep, and so I come along up street 'bout midnight, <lb/>
a-turning it all over, and when I got to that old shackly brick store by the <lb/>
Temperance Tavern, I backed up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just <lb/>
then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something <lb/>
under their arm and I reckoned they'd stole it. One was a-smoking, and t'other <lb/>
<pb n="229" entity="DSSR_000002931_0244"/>
one wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their <lb/>
faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard, by his white <lb/>
whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t'other one was a rusty, ragged looking <lb/>
devil."</p>
<p>"Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?"</p>
<p>This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know&mdash;but somehow it seems as if I did."</p>
<p>"Then they went on, and you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Follered 'em&mdash;yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up&mdash;they sneaked <lb/>
along so. I dogged 'em to the widder's stile, and stood in the dark and heard the <lb/>
ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he'd spile her looks just <lb/>
as I told you and your two&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What! The <hi rend="italic">deaf and dumb</hi> man said <lb/>
all that!"</p>
<figure id="f133" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0244">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">cornered.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Huck had made another terrible mistake! <lb/>
He was trying his best to keep the old man <lb/>
from getting the faintest hint of who the <lb/>
Spaniard might be, and yet his tongue <lb/>
seemed determined to get him into trouble <lb/>
in spite of all he could do. He made <reg orig="sev-|eral">several</reg> <lb/>
efforts to creep out of his scrape, but <lb/>
the old man's eye was upon him and he <lb/>
made blunder after blunder. Presently the <lb/>
Welchman said:</p>
<p>"My boy, don't be afraid of me. I <lb/>
wouldn't hurt a hair of your head for all <lb/>
the world. No&mdash;I'd protect you&mdash;I'd <reg orig="pro-|tect">protect</reg> <lb/>
you. This Spaniard is not deaf and <lb/>
dumb; you've let that slip without <reg orig="intend-|ing">intending</reg> <lb/>
it; you can't cover that up now. You know something about that Spamard <lb/>
that you want to keep dark. Now trust me&mdash;tell me what it is, and trust me&mdash;I <lb/>
won't betray you."</p>
<pb n="230" entity="DSSR_000002931_0245"/>
<p>Huck looked into the old man's honest eyes a moment, then bent over and <lb/>
whispered in his ear&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Tain't a Spaniard&mdash;it's Injun Joe!"</p>
<p>The Welchman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:</p>
<p>"It's all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and slitting <lb/>
noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because white men don't <lb/>
take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That's a different matter altogether."</p>
<p>During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man said that <lb/>
the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going to bed, was to get a <lb/>
lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood. They found <lb/>
none, but captured a bulky bundle of&mdash;</p>
<p>"Of <hi rend="small-caps">What?"</hi></p>
<p>If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more <reg orig="stun-|ning">stunning</reg> <lb/>
suddenness from Huck's blanched lips. His eyes were staring wide, now, <lb/>
and his breath suspended&mdash;waiting for the answer. The Welchman started&mdash; <lb/>
stared in return&mdash;three seconds&mdash;five seconds&mdash;ten&mdash;then replied&mdash;</p>
<p>"Of burglar's tools. Why what's the <hi rend="italic">matter</hi> with you?"</p>
<p>Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The <reg orig="Welch-|man">Welchman</reg> <lb/>
eyed him gravely, curiously&mdash;and presently said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Yes, burglar's tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what did <lb/>
give you that turn? What were <hi rend="italic">you</hi> expecting we'd found?"</p>
<p>Huck was in a close place&mdash;the inquiring eye was upon him&mdash;he would have <lb/>
given anything for material for a plausible answer&mdash;nothing suggested itself&mdash;the <lb/>
inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper&mdash;a senseless reply offered&mdash;there was <lb/>
no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered it&mdash;feebly:</p>
<p>"Sunday-school books, maybe."</p>
<p>Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and <reg orig="joy-|ously">joyously</reg>, <lb/>
shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and ended by saying <lb/>
that such a laugh was money in a man's pocket, because it cut down the doctor's <lb/>
bills like everything. Then he added:</p>
<p>"Poor old chap, you're white and jaded&mdash;you ain't well a bit&mdash;no wonder <lb/>
you're a little flighty and off your balance. But you'll come out of it. Rest and <lb/>
sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope."</p>
<pb n="231" entity="DSSR_000002931_0246"/>
<p>Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a <reg orig="sus-|picious">suspicious</reg> <lb/>
excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from the <lb/>
tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the talk at the widow's stile. <lb/>
He had only <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> it was not the treasure, however&mdash;he had not known that it <lb/>
wasn't &mdash;and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his <reg orig="self-|possession">self-possession</reg>. <lb/>
But on the whole he felt glad the little episode had happened, for <lb/>
now he knew beyond all question that that bundle was not <hi rend="italic">the</hi> bundle, and so his <lb/>
mind was at rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact everything seemed to be <lb/>
drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still in No. 2, the <lb/>
men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and Tom could seize the gold <lb/>
that night without any trouble or any fear of interruption.</p>
<p>Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck jumped <lb/>
for a hiding place, for he had no mind to be connected even remotely with the late <lb/>
event. The Welchman admitted several ladies and gentlemen, among them the <lb/>
widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of citzens were climbing up the hill&mdash;to <lb/>
stare at the stile. So the news had spread.</p>
<p>The Welchman had to tell the story of the night to the visitors. The widow's <lb/>
gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.</p>
<p>"Don't say a word about it madam. There's another that you're more beholden <lb/>
to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don't allow me to tell his name. <lb/>
We wouldn't have been there but for him."</p>
<p>Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main <lb/>
matter&mdash;but the Welchman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors, and <lb/>
through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he refused to part with his <lb/>
secret. When all else had been learned, the widow said:</p>
<p>"I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise. Why <lb/>
didn't you come and wake me?"</p>
<p>"We judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't likely to come again&mdash; <lb/>
they hadn't any tools left to work with, and what was the use of waking you up <lb/>
and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard at your house all the <lb/>
rest of the night. They've just come back."</p>
<p>More visitors came, and the story had to be told and re-told for a couple of <lb/>
hours more.</p>
<pb n="232" entity="DSSR_000002931_0247"/>
<p>There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody was <lb/>
early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came that not a <lb/>
sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the sermon was finished, <lb/>
Judge Thatcher's wife dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she moved down the <lb/>
aisle with the crowd and said:</p>
<p>"Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired to <lb/>
death."</p>
<p>"Your Becky?"</p>
<p>"Yes," with a startled look,&mdash;"didn't she stay with you last night?"</p>
<p>"Why, no."</p>
<p>Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into <lb/>
a pew, just as Aunt Polly, talking briskly <lb/>
with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:</p>
<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Thatcher. Good <lb/>
morning Mrs. Harper. I've got a boy that's <lb/>
turned up missing. I reckon my Tom staid <lb/>
at your house last night&mdash;one of you. And <lb/>
now he's afraid to come to church. I've <lb/>
got to settle with him."</p>
<p>Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and <lb/>
turned paler than ever.</p>
<p>"He didn't stay with us," said Mrs. <reg orig="Har-|per">Harper</reg>, <lb/>
beginning to look uneasy. A marked <lb/>
anxiety came into Aunt Polly's face.</p>
<p>"Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this <lb/>
morning?"</p>
<p>"No'm."</p>
<figure id="f134" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0247">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">alarming discoveries.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"When did you see him last?"</p>
<p>Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had stopped <lb/>
moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding uneasiness took <lb/>
possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously questioned, and young <lb/>
teachers. They all said they had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on <lb/>
board the ferry-boat on the homeward trip; it was dark; no one thought of <lb/>
<pb n="233" entity="DSSR_000002931_0248"/>
inquiring if any one was missing. One young man finally blurted out his fear <lb/>
that they were still in the cave! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell <lb/>
to crying and wringing her hands.</p>
<p>The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group, to group, from street to street, and <lb/>
within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the whole town was up! <lb/>
The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant insignificance, the burglars were <reg orig="for-|gotten">forgotten</reg>, <lb/>
horses were saddled, skiffs were manned, the ferry-boat ordered out, and <lb/>
before the horror was half an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down <lb/>
high-road and river toward the cave.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">tom and becky stir up the town.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women <lb/>
visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They cried <lb/>
with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the tedious night the <lb/>
town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at last, all the word that <lb/>
came was, "Send more candles&mdash;and send food." Mrs. Thatcher was almost <lb/>
<pb n="234" entity="DSSR_000002931_0249"/>
crazed; and Aunt Polly also. Judge Thatcher sent messages of hope and <reg orig="en-|couragement">encouragement</reg> <lb/>
from the cave, but they conveyed no real cheer.</p>
<p>The old Welchman came home toward daylight, spattered with candle grease, <lb/>
smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck still in the bed that <lb/>
had been provided for him, and delirious with fever. The physicians were all at <lb/>
the cave, so the Widow Douglas came and took charge of the patient. She said <lb/>
she would do her best by him, because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, <lb/>
he was the Lord's, and nothing that was the Lord's was a thing to be neglected. <lb/>
The Welchman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said&mdash;</p>
<p>"You can depend on it. That's the Lord's mark. He don't leave it off. He <lb/>
never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his hands."</p>

</figure>
<p>Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village, but <lb/>
the strongest of the citizens continued <lb/>
searching. All the news that could be <lb/>
gained was that remotenesses of the <reg orig="cav-|ern">cavern</reg> <lb/>
were being ransacked that had never <lb/>
been visited before; that every corner <lb/>
and crevice was going to be thoroughly <lb/>
searched; that wherever one wandered <lb/>
through the maze of passages, lights were <lb/>
to be seen flitting hither and thither in <lb/>
the distance, and shoutings and pistol <lb/>
shots sent their hollow reverberations to <lb/>
the ear down the sombre aisles. In one <lb/>
place, far from the section usually <reg orig="trav-|ersed">traversed</reg> <lb/>
by tourists, the names "<hi rend="small-caps">Becky &amp; <lb/>
Tom</hi>" had been found traced upon the <lb/>
rocky wall with candle smoke, and near <lb/>
at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. <lb/>
Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last <lb/>
relic she should ever have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could <lb/>
ever be so precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the <lb/>
awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away speck <lb/>
<pb n="235" entity="DSSR_000002931_0250"/>
of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score <lb/>
of men go trooping down the echoing aisle&mdash;and then a sickening disappointment <lb/>
always followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher's light.</p>
<p>Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and the <lb/>
village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything. The <reg orig="acci-|dental">accidental</reg> <lb/>
discovery, just made, that the <reg orig="pro-|prietor">proprietor</reg> <lb/>
of the Temperance Tavern kept <lb/>
liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered <lb/>
the public pulse, tremendous as the fact <lb/>
was. In a lucid interval, Huck feebly led <lb/>
up to the subject of taverns, and finally <lb/>
asked&mdash;dimly dreading the worst&mdash;if <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
had been discovered at the <reg orig="Temper-|ance">Temperance</reg> <lb/>
Tavern since he had been ill?</p>
<p>"Yes," said the widow.</p>
<p>Huck started up in bed, wild-eyed:</p>
<p>"What! What was it?"</p>
<p>"Liquor!&mdash;and the place has been shut <lb/>
up. Lie down, child&mdash;what a turn you did <lb/>
give me!"</p>
<p>"Only tell me just one thing&mdash;only just <lb/>
one&mdash;please! Was it Tom Sawyer that <lb/>
found it?"</p>
<figure id="f137" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0250">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">huck questions the widow.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>The widow burst into tears. "Hush, hush, child, hush! I've told you before, <lb/>
you must <hi rend="italic">not</hi> talk. You are very, very sick!"</p>
<p>Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great <reg orig="pow-|wow">powwow</reg> <lb/>
if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever&mdash;gone forever! <lb/>
But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should cry.</p>
<p>These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and under the <lb/>
weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:</p>
<p>"There&mdash;he's asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody <lb/>
could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain't many left, now, that's got hope enough, <lb/>
or strength enough, either, to go on searching."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Now</hi> to return to Tom and Becky's <lb/>
share in the pic-nic. They tripped <lb/>
along the murky aisles with the rest <lb/>
of the company, visiting the <reg orig="famil-|iar">familiar</reg> <lb/>
wonders of the cave&mdash;wonders <lb/>
dubbed with rather over-descriptive <lb/>
names, such as "The <reg orig="Drawing-|Room">Drawing-Room</reg>," <lb/>
"The Cathedral," "<reg orig="Alad-|din's">Aladdin's</reg> <lb/>
Palace," and so on. Presently <lb/>
the hide-and-seek frolicking began, <lb/>
and Tom and Becky engaged in it <lb/>
with zeal until the exertion began to <lb/>
grow a trifle wearisome; then they <lb/>
wandered down a sinuous avenue <lb/>
holding their candles aloft and <reg orig="read-|ing">reading</reg> <lb/>
the tangled web-work of names, <lb/>
dates, post-office addresses and <reg orig="mot-|toes">mottoes</reg> <lb/>
with which the rocky walls had <lb/>
been frescoed (in candle smoke.) Still drifting along and talking, they scarcely <lb/>
noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls were not frescoed. <lb/>
<pb n="237" entity="DSSR_000002931_0252"/>
They smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf and moved on. <lb/>
Presently they came to a place where a little stream of water, trickling over a <lb/>
ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it, had, in the slow-dragging <lb/>
ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone. <lb/>
Tom squeezed his small body behind it in order to illuminate it for Becky's <lb/>
gratification. He found that it <reg orig="cur-|tained">curtained</reg> <lb/>
a sort of steep natural stairway <lb/>
which was enclosed between narrow <lb/>
walls, and at once the ambition to be a <lb/>
discoverer seized him. Becky <reg orig="respond-|ed">responded</reg> <lb/>
to his call, and they made a <reg orig="smoke-|mark">smoke-mark</reg> <lb/>
for future guidance, and started <lb/>
upon their quest. They wound this <lb/>
way and that, far down into the secret <lb/>
depths of the cave, made another mark, <lb/>
and branched off in search of novelties <lb/>
to tell the upper world about. In one <lb/>
place they found a spacious cavern, <lb/>
from whose ceiling depended a <reg orig="multi-|tude">multitude</reg> <lb/>
of shining stalactites of the length <lb/>
and circumference of a man's leg; they <lb/>
walked all about it, wondering and <reg orig="ad-|miring">admiring</reg>, <lb/>
and presently left it by one of <lb/>
the numerous passages that opened <lb/>
into it. This shortly brought them to <lb/>
a bewitching spring, whose basin was <lb/>
encrusted with a frost work of <reg orig="glitter-|ing">glittering</reg> <lb/>
crystals; it was in the midst of a <lb/>
cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been <lb/>
formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together, the result <lb/>
of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the roof vast knots of bats <lb/>
had packed themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed <lb/>
<figure id="f139" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0252">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">wonders of the cave.</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="238" entity="DSSR_000002931_0253"/>
the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and <reg orig="dart-|ing">darting</reg> <lb/>
furiously at the candles. Tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort <lb/>
of conduct. He siezed Becky's hand and hurried her into the first corridor <lb/>
that offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck Becky's light out with its <lb/>
<figure id="f140" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0253">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">attacked by natives.</hi></head>
</figure>
wing while she was passing out of the cavern. The bats chased the children <lb/>
a good distance; but the fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, <lb/>
and at last got rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, <lb/>
shortly, which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the <lb/>
shadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would be <lb/>
<pb n="239" entity="DSSR_000002931_0254"/>
best to sit down and rest a while, first. Now, for the first time, the deep stillness <lb/>
of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children. Becky said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Why, I didn't notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of the <lb/>
others."</p>
<p>"Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them&mdash;and I don't know <lb/>
how far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn't hear <lb/>
them here."</p>
<p>Becky grew apprehensive.</p>
<p>"I wonder how long we've been down here, Tom. We better start back."</p>
<p>"Yes, I reckon we better. P'raps we better."</p>
<p>"Can you find the way, Tom? It's all a mixed-up crookedness to me."</p>
<p>"I reckon I could find it&mdash;but then the bats. If they put both our candles <lb/>
out it will be an awful fix. Let's try some other way, so as not to go through <lb/>
there."</p>
<p>"Well. But I hope we won't get lost. It would be so awful!" and the <lb/>
girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.</p>
<p>They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long way, <lb/>
glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar about the <lb/>
look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an examination, <lb/>
Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he would say <lb/>
cheerily&mdash;</p>
<p>"Oh, it's all right. This ain't the one, but we'll come to it right away!"</p>
<p>But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began to <lb/>
turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of finding <lb/>
the one that was wanted. He still said it was "all right," but there was such <lb/>
a leaden dread at his heart, that the words had lost their ring and sounded just <lb/>
as if he had said, "All is lost!" Becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear, <lb/>
and tried hard to keep back the tears, but they would come. At last she said:</p>
<p>"O, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way! We seem to get <lb/>
worse and worse off all the time."</p>
<p>Tom stopped.</p>
<p>"Listen!" said he.</p>
<pb n="240" entity="DSSR_000002931_0255"/>
<p>Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous <lb/>
in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down the empty aisles and <lb/>
died out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking <lb/>
laughter.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid," said Becky.</p>
<p>"It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they <hi rend="italic">might</hi> hear us, you know" and he <lb/>
shouted again.</p>
<p>The "might" was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so <reg orig="con-|fessed">confessed</reg> <lb/>
a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but there was <lb/>
no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried his steps. <lb/>
It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed <lb/>
another fearful fact to Becky&mdash;he could <lb/>
not find his way back!</p>
<figure id="f141" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0255">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">despair.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"O, Tom, you didn't make any marks!"</p>
<p>"Becky I was such a fool! Such a <lb/>
fool! I never thought we might want <lb/>
to come back! No&mdash;I can't find the <lb/>
way. It's all mixed up."</p>
<p>"Tom, Tom, we're lost! we're lost! <lb/>
We never can get out of this awful <lb/>
place! O, why <hi rend="italic">did</hi> we ever leave the <lb/>
others!"</p>
<p>She sank to the ground and burst into <lb/>
such a frenzy of crying that Tom was <lb/>
appalled with the idea that she might <lb/>
die, or lose her reason. He sat down <lb/>
by her and put his arms around her; <lb/>
she buried her face in his bosom, she <lb/>
clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the <lb/>
far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom begged her to pluck up <lb/>
hope again, and she said she could not. He fell to blaming and abusing <lb/>
himself for getting her into this miserable situation; this had a better effect.</p>
<pb n="241" entity="DSSR_000002931_0256"/>
<p>She said she would try to hope again, she would get up and follow wherever <lb/>
he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more. For he was no <lb/>
more to blame than she, she said.</p>
<p>So they moved on, again&mdash;aimlessly&mdash;simply at random&mdash;all they could do <lb/>
was to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of reviving&mdash; <lb/>
not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its nature to revive when <lb/>
the spring has not been taken out of it by age and familiarity with failure.</p>
<p>By and by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out. This economy meant <lb/>
so much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died <lb/>
again. She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his <lb/>
pockets&mdash;yet he must economise.</p>
<p>By and by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay no <lb/>
attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown <lb/>
to be so precious; moving, in some direction, in any direction, was at least <lb/>
progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten <lb/>
its pursuit.</p>
<p>At last Becky's frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down. Tom <lb/>
rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there, and the <reg orig="com-|fortable">comfortable</reg> <lb/>
beds and above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom tried to think of <lb/>
some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements were grown <reg orig="thread-|bare">threadbare</reg> <lb/>
with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore so heavily upon <lb/>
Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful. He sat looking into <lb/>
her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of <lb/>
pleasant dreams; and by and by a smile dawned and rested there. The <reg orig="peace-|ful">peaceful</reg> <lb/>
face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit, and his <lb/>
thoughts wandered away to by-gone times and dreamy memories. While he <lb/>
was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh&mdash;but it was <lb/>
stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan followed it.</p>
<p>"Oh, how <hi rend="italic">could</hi> I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I <lb/>
don't, Tom! Don't look so! I won't say it again."</p>
<p>"I'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and we'll find the <lb/>
way out."</p>
<pb n="242" entity="DSSR_000002931_0257"/>
<p>"We can try, Tom; but I've seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I <lb/>
reckon we are going there."</p>
<p>"Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let's go on trying."</p>
<p>They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried <lb/>
to estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was that it <lb/>
seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not be, for their <lb/>
candles were not gone yet. A long time after this&mdash;they could not tell how <lb/>
long&mdash;Tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water&mdash;they must <lb/>
find a spring. They found one presently, and Tom said it was time to rest <lb/>
again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky said she thought she could go on a <lb/>
little farther. She was surprised to hear Tom dissent. She could not <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg> <lb/>
it. They sat down, and Tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of <lb/>
them with some clay. Thought was <lb/>
soon busy; nothing was said for some <lb/>
time. Then Becky broke the silence:</p>
<p>"Tom, I am so hungry!"</p>
<figure id="f142" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0257">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">the wedding cake.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Tom took something out of his pocket.</p>
<p>"Do you remember this?" said he.</p>
<p>Becky almost smiled.</p>
<p>"It's our wedding cake, Tom."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;I wish it was as big as a barrel, <lb/>
for it's all we've got."</p>
<p>"I saved it from the pic-nic for us <lb/>
to dream on, Tom, the way grown-up <lb/>
people do with wedding cake&mdash;but it'll <lb/>
be our&mdash;"</p>
<p>She dropped the sentence where it <lb/>
was. Tom divided the cake and Becky <lb/>
ate with good appetite, while Tom <reg orig="nib-|bled">nibbled</reg> <lb/>
at his moiety. There was abundance of cold water to finish the feast <lb/>
with. By and by Becky suggested that they move on again. Tom was silent <lb/>
a moment. Then he said:</p>
<pb n="243" entity="DSSR_000002931_0258"/>
<p>"Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?"</p>
<p>Becky's face paled, but she thought she could.</p>
<p>"Well then, Becky, we must stay here, where there's water to drink. That <lb/>
little piece is our last candle!"</p>
<p>Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort <lb/>
her but with little effect. At length Becky said:</p>
<p>"Tom!"</p>
<p>"Well, Becky?"</p>
<p>"They'll miss us and hunt for us!"</p>
<p>"Yes, they will! Certainly they will!"</p>
<p>"Maybe they're hunting for us now, Tom."</p>
<p>"Why I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are."</p>
<p>"When would they miss us, Tom?"</p>
<p>"When they get back to the boat, I reckon."</p>
<p>"Tom, it might be dark, then&mdash;would they notice we hadn't come?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they <lb/>
got home."</p>
<p>A frightened look in Becky's face brought Tom to his senses and he saw that <lb/>
he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night! The <lb/>
children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of grief from <lb/>
Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers also&mdash;that the <lb/>
Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher discovered that <lb/>
Becky was not at Mrs. Harper's.</p>
<p>The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it melt <lb/>
slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone at last; saw <lb/>
the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of smoke, linger at its top <lb/>
a moment, and then&mdash;the horror of utter darkness reigned!</p>
<p>How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that she <lb/>
was crying in Tom's arms, neither could tell. All that they knew was, that <lb/>
after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of a dead stupor <lb/>
of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said it might be Sunday, <lb/>
now&mdash;maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but her sorrows were <lb/>
<pb n="244" entity="DSSR_000002931_0259"/>
too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that they must have been <lb/>
missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going on. He would shout and <lb/>
maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in the darkness the distant <lb/>
echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no more.</p>
<p>The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A <lb/>
portion of Tom's half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But they <lb/>
seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted desire.</p>
<p>By and by Tom said:</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Sh!</hi> Did you hear that?"</p>
<p>Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the faintest, <lb/>
far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by the hand, <lb/>
started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently he listened again; <lb/>
again the sound was heard, and apparently a little nearer.</p>
<p>"It's them!" said Tom; "they're coming! Come along Becky&mdash;we're all <lb/>
right now!"</p>
<p>The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow, <lb/>
however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded <lb/>
against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three feet <lb/>
deep, it might be a hundred&mdash;there was no passing it at any rate. Tom got <lb/>
down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No bottom. They <lb/>
must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They listened; evidently <lb/>
the distant shoutings were growing more distant! a moment or two more <lb/>
and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking misery of it! Tom <lb/>
whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He talked hopefully to <lb/>
Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came again.</p>
<p>The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged <lb/>
on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed it <lb/>
must be Tuesday by this time.</p>
<p>Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It <lb/>
would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the heavy <lb/>
time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to a projection, <lb/>
and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the line as he groped <lb/>
<pb n="245" entity="DSSR_000002931_0260"/>
along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a "jumping-off place." <lb/>
Tom got down on his knees and felt below, and then as far around the corner <lb/>
as he could reach with his hands conveniently; he made an effort to stretch <lb/>
yet a little further to the right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a <lb/>
human hand, holding a candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up <lb/>
a glorious shout, and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged <lb/>
<figure id="f143" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0260">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">a new terror.</hi></head>
</figure>
to&mdash;Injun Joe's! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly <lb/>
gratified the next moment, to see the "Spaniard" take to his heels and get <lb/>
himself out of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice <lb/>
and come over and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must <lb/>
have disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom's <lb/>
<pb n="246" entity="DSSR_000002931_0261"/>
fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he had <lb/>
strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and nothing <lb/>
should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He was careful <lb/>
to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he had only shouted <lb/>
"for luck."</p>
<p>But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run. Another <lb/>
tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought changes. The <lb/>
children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed that it must be <lb/>
Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now, and that the search <lb/>
had been given over. He proposed to explore another passage. He felt <lb/>
willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But Becky was very weak. <lb/>
She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be roused. She said she <lb/>
would wait, now, where she was, and die&mdash;it would not be long. She told Tom <lb/>
to go with the kite-line and explore if he chose; but she implored him to come <lb/>
back every little while and speak to her; and she made him promise that when <lb/>
the awful time came, he would stay by her and hold her hand until all was <lb/>
over.</p>
<p>Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show of <lb/>
being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave; then he <lb/>
took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the passages on <lb/>
his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with bodings of coming <lb/>
doom.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Tuesday</hi> afternoon came, and waned <lb/>
to the twilight. The village of St. <lb/>
Petersburg still mourned. The lost <lb/>
children had not been found. Public <lb/>
prayers had been offered up for them, <lb/>
and many and many a private prayer <lb/>
that had the petitioner's whole heart <lb/>
in it; but still no good news came from <lb/>
the cave. The majority of the <reg orig="search-|ers">searchers</reg> <lb/>
had given up the quest and gone <lb/>
back to their daily avocations, saying <lb/>
that it was plain the children could <lb/>
never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was <lb/>
very ill, and a great part of the time <lb/>
delirious. People said it was <reg orig="heart-|breaking">heartbreaking</reg> <lb/>
to hear her call her child, <lb/>
and raise her head and listen a whole <lb/>
minute at a time, then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had <lb/>
drooped into a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. <lb/>
The village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.</p>
<pb n="248" entity="DSSR_000002931_0263"/>
<p>Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells, and in <lb/>
a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad people, who shouted, <lb/>
"Turn out! turn out! they're found! they're found!" Tin pans and horns were <lb/>
added to the din, the population massed itself and moved toward the river, met <lb/>
the children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens, thronged <lb/>
around it, joined its homeward march, and swept magnificently up the main street <lb/>
roaring huzzah after huzzah!</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">the "turn out" to receive tom and becky.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the greatest <lb/>
night the little town had ever seen. During the first half hour a procession of <lb/>
villagers filed through Judge Thatcher's house, siezed the saved ones and kissed <lb/>
them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher's hand, tried to speak but couldn't&mdash;and drifted <lb/>
out raining tears all over the place.</p>
<p>Aunt Polly's happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's nearly so. It would <lb/>
<pb n="249" entity="DSSR_000002931_0264"/>
be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the great news to <lb/>
the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon a sofa with an eager <lb/>
auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful adventure, putting in <lb/>
many striking additions to adorn it withal; and closed with a description of how <lb/>
he left Becky and went on an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues <lb/>
as far as his kite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch <lb/>
of the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off speck that <lb/>
looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it, pushed his head and <lb/>
shoulders through a small hole and saw the broad Mississippi rolling by! And if <lb/>
it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that speck of daylight <lb/>
and would not have explored that passage any more! He told how he went back <lb/>
for Becky and broke the good news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff, <lb/>
for she was tired, and knew she was going to die, and wanted to. He described <lb/>
<figure id="f146" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0264">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">the escape from the cave.</hi></head>
</figure>
<pb n="250" entity="DSSR_000002931_0265"/>
how he labored with her and convinced her; and how she almost died for joy <lb/>
when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how <lb/>
he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there <lb/>
and cried for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them <lb/>
and told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men didn't <lb/>
believe the wild tale at first, "because," said they, "you are five miles down the <lb/>
river below the valley the cave is in"&mdash;then took them aboard, rowed to a house, <lb/>
gave them supper, made them rest till two or three hours after dark and then <lb/>
brought them home.</p>
<p>Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him were <lb/>
tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind them, and <lb/>
informed of the great news.</p>
<p>Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be shaken off <lb/>
at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were bedridden all of <reg orig="Wed-|nesday">Wednesday</reg> <lb/>
and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and more tired and worn, all the <lb/>
time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday, was down town Friday, and nearly as <lb/>
whole as ever Saturday; but Becky did not leave her room until Sunday, and then <lb/>
she looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness.</p>
<p>Tom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could not <lb/>
be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday. He was <lb/>
admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his adventure and <lb/>
introduce no exciting topic. The widow Douglas staid by to see that he obeyed. <lb/>
At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event; also that the "ragged man's" <lb/>
body had eventually been found in the river near the ferry landing; he had been <lb/>
drowned while trying to escape, perhaps.</p>
<p>About a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave, he started off to visit Huck, <lb/>
who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting talk, and Tom had <lb/>
some that would interest him, he thought. Judge Thatcher's house was on Tom's <lb/>
way, and he stopped to see Becky. The Judge and some friends set Tom to <lb/>
talking, and some one asked him ironically if he wouldn't like to go to the cave <lb/>
again. Tom said he thought he wouldn't mind it. The Judge said:</p>
<p>"Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least doubt. But <lb/>
<pb n="251" entity="DSSR_000002931_0266"/>
we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any more."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and <reg orig="triple-|locked&mdash;and">triplelocked&mdash;and</reg> <lb/>
I've got the keys."</p>
<p>Tom turned as white as a sheet.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!" <lb/>
The water was brought and thrown into Tom's face.</p>
<p>"Ah, now you're all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Judge, Injun Joe's in the cave!"</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Within</hi> a few minutes the news had <lb/>
spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of men <lb/>
were on their way to McDougal's cave, <lb/>
and the ferry-boat, well filled with <lb/>
passengers, soon followed. Tom <reg orig="Saw-|yer">Sawyer</reg> <lb/>
was in the skiff that bore Judge <lb/>
Thatcher.</p>
<p>When the cave door was unlocked, a <lb/>
sorrowful sight presented itself in the <lb/>
dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe <lb/>
lay stretched upon the ground, dead, <lb/>
with his face close to the crack of the <lb/>
door, as if his longing eyes had been <lb/>
fixed, to the latest moment, upon the <lb/>
light and the cheer of the free world <lb/>
outside. Tom was touched, for he <lb/>
knew by his own experience how this <lb/>
wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but nevertheless he felt an abounding <lb/>
sense of relief and security, now, which revealed to him in a degree which he had <lb/>
<pb n="253" entity="DSSR_000002931_0268"/>
not fully appreciated before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him <lb/>
since the day he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.</p>
<figure id="f149" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0268">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">caught at last.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Injun Joe's bowie knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great <reg orig="found-|ation-beam">foundation-beam</reg> <lb/>
of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with tedious labor; <lb/>
useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a sill outside it, and upon that <lb/>
stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect; the only damage done was to <lb/>
the knife itself. But if there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would <lb/>
have been useless still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could <lb/>
not have squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only <lb/>
hacked that place in order to be doing something&mdash;in order to pass the weary <lb/>
time&mdash;in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could find half a <lb/>
dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this vestibule, left there by <lb/>
tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner had searched them out and eaten <lb/>
them. He had also contrived to catch a few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, <lb/>
<pb n="254" entity="DSSR_000002931_0269"/>
leaving only their claws. The poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one <lb/>
place near at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for <lb/>
ages, builded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken <lb/>
off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a <lb/>
stone, wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch <lb/>
the precious drop that fell once in every three minutes <lb/>
with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick&mdash;a dessert <lb/>
spoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop <lb/>
was falling when the Pyramids were new; when Troy <lb/>
fell; when the foundations of Rome were laid; when <lb/>
Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the <lb/>
British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the <lb/>
massacre at Lexington was "news." It is falling now; <lb/>
it will still be falling when all these things shall have <lb/>
sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight <lb/>
of tradition, and been swallowed up in the thick night <lb/>
of oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a mission? <lb/>
Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years <lb/>
to be ready for this flitting human insect's need? and <lb/>
has it another important object to accomplish ten <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg> <lb/>
years to come? No matter. It is many and many <lb/>
a year since the hapless half-breed scooped out the <lb/>
stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the <lb/>
tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow <lb/>
dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of <lb/>
McDougal's cave. Injun Joe's cup stands first in the <lb/>
list of the cavern's marvels; even "Aladdin's Palace" <lb/>
cannot rival it.</p>
<figure id="f150" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0269">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">drop after drop.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked there in <lb/>
boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and hamlets for seven <lb/>
miles around; they brought their children, and all sorts of provisions, and <reg orig="con-|fessed">confessed</reg> <lb/>
that they had had almost as satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could <lb/>
have had at the hanging.</p>
<pb n="255" entity="DSSR_000002931_0270"/>
<p>This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing&mdash;the petition to the <reg orig="Gover-|nor">Governor</reg> <lb/>
for Injun Joe's pardon. The petition had been largely signed; many tearful <lb/>
and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of sappy women been <lb/>
appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the governor, and implore him <lb/>
to be a merciful ass and trample his duty under foot. Injun Joe was believed to <lb/>
have killed five citizens of the village, but what of that? If he had been Satan <lb/>
himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names <lb/>
to a pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and <lb/>
leaky water-works.</p>

</figure>
<p>The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have an <lb/>
important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom's adventure from the Welchman <lb/>
and the widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned there was one <lb/>
thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted to talk about now. <lb/>
Huck's face saddened. He said:</p>
<p>"I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but whisky. <lb/>
Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must 'a' ben you, soon as I heard <lb/>
'bout that whisky business; and I knowed you hadn't got the money becuz you'd <lb/>
'a' got at me some way or other and told me even if you was mum to everybody <lb/>
else. Tom, something's always told me we'd never get holt of that swag."</p>
<p>"Why Huck, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> never told on that tavern-keeper. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> know his tavern was all <lb/>
<pb n="256" entity="DSSR_000002931_0271"/>
right the Saturday I went to the pic-nic. Don't you remember you was to watch <lb/>
there that night?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes! Why it seems 'bout a year ago. It was that very night that I <lb/>
follered Injun Joe to the widder's."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">You</hi> followed him?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe's left friends behind him, and <lb/>
I don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn't ben for <lb/>
me he'd be down in Texas now, all right."</p>
<p>Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only heard <lb/>
of the Welchmen's part of it before.</p>
<p>"Well," said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, "whoever <lb/>
nipped the whisky in No. 2, nipped the money too, I reckon&mdash;anyways it's a goner <lb/>
for us, Tom."</p>
<p>"Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!"</p>
<p>"What!" Huck searched his comrade's face keenly. "Tom, have you got on <lb/>
the track of that money again?"</p>
<p>"Huck, it's in the cave!"</p>
<p>Huck's eyes blazed.</p>
<p>"Say it again, Tom!"</p>
<p>"The money's in the cave!"</p>
<p>"Tom,&mdash;honest injun, now&mdash;is it fun, or earnest?"</p>
<p>"Earnest, Huck&mdash;just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in there <lb/>
with me and help get it out?"</p>
<p>"I bet I will! I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it and not get lost."</p>
<p>"Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the world."</p>
<p>"Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's &mdash;"</p>
<p>"Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it I'll agree to give <lb/>
you my drum and everything I've got in the world. I will, by jings."</p>
<p>"All right&mdash;it's a whiz. When do you say?"</p>
<p>"Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?"</p>
<p>"Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days, now, but I <lb/>
can't walk more'n a mile, Tom&mdash;least I don't think I could."</p>
<pb n="257" entity="DSSR_000002931_0272"/>
<p>"It's about five mile into there the way <lb/>
anybody but me would go, Huck, but <lb/>
there's a mighty short cut that they don't <lb/>
anybody but me know about. Huck, I'll <lb/>
take you right to it in a skiff. I'll float <lb/>
the skiff down there, and I'll pull it back <lb/>
again all by myself. You needn't ever <lb/>
turn your hand over."</p>
<p>"Less start right off, Tom."</p>
<p>"All right. We want some bread and <lb/>
meat, and our pipes, and a little bag or <lb/>
two, and two or three kite-strings, and <lb/>
some of these new fangled things they <lb/>
call lucifer matches. I tell you many's <lb/>
the time I wished I had some when I <lb/>
was in there before."</p>
<p>A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a <lb/>
small skiff from a citizen who was absent, <lb/>
and got under way at once. When they <lb/>
were several miles below "Cave Hollow," <lb/>
Tom said:</p>
<p>"Now you see this bluff here looks all <lb/>
alike all the way down from the cave <lb/>
hollow&mdash;no houses, no wood-yards, bushes <lb/>
all alike. But do you see that white place <lb/>
up yonder where there's been a <reg orig="land-|slide">landslide</reg>? <lb/>
Well that's one of my marks. <lb/>
We'll get ashore, now."</p>
<figure id="f152" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002931_0272">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">a business trip.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>They landed.</p>
<p>"Now Huck, where we're a-standing you <lb/>
could touch that hole I got out of with a <lb/>
fishing-pole. See if you can find it."</p>
<pb n="258" entity="DSSR_000002931_0273"/>
<p>Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly marched <lb/>
into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in this country. You <lb/>
just keep mum about it. All along I've been wanting to be a robber, but I knew <lb/>
I'd got to have a thing like this, and where to run across it was the bother. We've <lb/>
got it now, and we'll keep it quiet, only we'll let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in&mdash; <lb/>
because of course there's got to be a Gang, or else there wouldn't be any style <lb/>
about it. Tom Sawyer's Gang&mdash;it sounds splendid, don't it, Huck?"</p>
<p>"Well, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?"</p>
<p>"Oh, most anybody. Waylay people&mdash;that's mostly the way."</p>
<p>"And kill them?"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom."</p>
<p>"What's a ransom?"</p>
<p>"Money. You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends; and after you've <lb/>
kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill them. That's the general way. <lb/>
Only you don't kill the women. You shut up the women, but you don't kill them. <lb/>
They're always beautiful and rich, and awfully scared. You take their watches <lb/>
and things, but you always take your hat off and talk polite. They ain't anybody <lb/>
as polite as robbers&mdash;you'll see that in any book. Well the women get to loving <lb/>
you, and after they've been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and <lb/>
after that you couldn't get them to leave. If you drove them out they'd turn right <lb/>
around and come back. It's so in all the books."</p>
<p>"Why it's real bully, Tom. I b'lieve it's better'n to be a pirate."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and circuses and all that."</p>
<p>By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in the <lb/>
lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel; then made their <lb/>
spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought them to the spring <lb/>
and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him. He showed Huck the fragment of <lb/>
candle-wick perched on a lump of clay against the wall, and described how he and <lb/>
Becky had watched the flame struggle and expire.</p>
<p>The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and gloom of <lb/>
the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently entered and followed <lb/>
<pb n="259" entity="DSSR_000002931_0274"/>
Tom's other corridor until they reached the "jumping-off place." The candles <lb/>
revealed the fact that it was not really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty <lb/>
or thirty feet high. Tom whispered&mdash;</p>
<p>"Now I'll show you something, Huck."</p>
<p>He held his candle aloft and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There&mdash;on the <lb/>
big rock over yonder&mdash;done with candle smoke."</p>
<p>"Tom, its a <hi rend="italic">cross!</hi>"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Now</hi> where's your Number Two? '<hi rend="italic">Under the cross,</hi>' hey? Right yonder's <lb/>
where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!"</p>
<p>Huck stared at the mystic sign a while, and then said with a shaky voice&mdash;</p>
<p>"Tom, less git out of here!"</p>
<p>"What! and leave the treasure?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;leave it. Injun Joe's ghost is round about there, certain."</p>
<p>"No it ain't, Huck, no it ain't. It would ha'nt the place where he died&mdash;away <lb/>
out at the mouth of the cave&mdash;five mile from here."</p>
<p>"No, Tom, it wouldn't. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of <lb/>
ghosts, and so do you."</p>
<p>Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in his mind. But <lb/>
presently an idea occurred to him&mdash;</p>
<p>"Looky here, Huck, what fools we're making of ourselves! Injun Joe's ghost <lb/>
ain't a going to come around where there's a cross!"</p>
<p>The point was well taken. It had its effect.</p>
<p>"Tom I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us, that cross is. I <lb/>
reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for that box."</p>
<p>Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended. Huck <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg>. <lb/>
Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood in. <lb/>
The boys examined three of them with no result. They found a small recess in the <lb/>
one nearest the base of the rock, with a pallet of blankets spread down in it; also <lb/>
an old suspender, some bacon rhind, and the well gnawed bones of two or three <lb/>
fowls. But there was no money box. The lads searched and re-searched this <lb/>
place, but in vain. Tom said:</p>
<pb n="260" entity="DSSR_000002931_0275"/>
<p>"He said <hi rend="italic">under</hi> the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the cross. <lb/>
It can't be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the ground."</p>
<p>They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck <lb/>
could suggest nothing. By and by Tom said:</p>
<p>"Looky here, Huck, there's foot-prints and some candle grease on the clay <lb/>
about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now what's that for? I <lb/>
bet you the money <hi rend="italic">is</hi> under the rock. I'm going to dig in the clay."</p>
<p>"That ain't no bad notion, Tom!" said Huck with animation.</p>
<p>Tom's "real Barlow" was out at once, and he had not dug four inches before <lb/>
he struck wood.</p>
<p>"Hey, Huck!&mdash;you hear that?"</p>
<p>Huck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and <lb/>
removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock. Tom <lb/>
got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could, but said he <lb/>
could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed to explore. He stooped and <lb/>
passed under; the narrow way descended gradually. He followed its winding <lb/>
course, first to the right, then to the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short <lb/>
curve, by and by, and exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>"My goodness, Huck, looky here!"</p>
<p>It was the treasure box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern, along <lb/>
with an empty powder keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two or three pairs <lb/>
of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish well soaked with the <lb/>
water-drip.</p>
<p>"Got it at last!" said Huck, plowing among the tarnished coins with his <lb/>
hand. "My, but we're rich, Tom!"</p>
<p>"Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to believe, but we <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">have</hi> got it, sure! Say&mdash;let's not fool around here. Let's snake it out. Lemme <lb/>
see if I can lift the box."</p>
<p>It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward fashion, <lb/>
but could not carry it conveniently.</p>
<p>"I thought so," he said; <hi rend="italic">they</hi> carried it like it was heavy, that day at the <lb/>
ha'nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of fetching the <lb/>
little bags along."</p>
<pb n="261" entity="DSSR_000002931_0276"/>
<p>The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross-rock.</p>
<p>"Now less fetch the guns and things," said Huck.</p>
<p>"No, Huck&mdash;leave them there. They're just the tricks to have when we go <lb/>
to robbing. We'll keep them there all the time, and we'll hold our orgies there, <lb/>
too. It's an awful snug place for orgies."</p>
<p>"What's orgies?"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">I</hi> dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we've got to have <lb/>
them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long time. It's getting <lb/>
late, I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll eat and smoke when we get to the skiff."</p>
<figure id="f153" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0276">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">"got it at last!"</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily out, <lb/>
found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the skiff. As the <lb/>
sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got under way. Tom <lb/>
skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting cheerily with Huck, <lb/>
and landed shortly after dark.</p>
<pb n="262" entity="DSSR_000002931_0277"/>
<p>"Now Huck," said Tom, "we'll hide the money in the loft of the widow's <lb/>
wood-shed, and I'll come up in the morning and we'll count it and divide, and <lb/>
then we'll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be safe. Just <lb/>
you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook Benny Taylor's little <lb/>
wagon; I won't be gone a minute."</p>
<p>He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small <lb/>
sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off, dragging <lb/>
his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welchman's house, they <lb/>
stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the Welchman stepped <lb/>
out and said:</p>
<p>"Hallo, who's that?"</p>
<p>"Huck and Tom Sawyer."</p>
<p>"Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting. <lb/>
Here&mdash;hurry up, trot ahead&mdash;I'll haul the wagon for you. Why, it's not as <lb/>
light as it might be. Got bricks in it?&mdash;or old metal?"</p>
<p>"Old metal," said Tom.</p>
<p>"I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away <lb/>
more time, hunting up six bit's worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than <lb/>
they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that's human nature <lb/>
&mdash;hurry along, hurry along!"</p>
<p>The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.</p>
<p>"Never mind; you'll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas's."</p>
<p>Huck said with some apprehension&mdash;for he was long used to being falsely <lb/>
accused&mdash;</p>
<p>"Mr. Jones, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> haven't been doing nothing."</p>
<p>The Welchman laughed.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know, Huck, my boy. I don't know about that. Ain't you <lb/>
and the widow good friends?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Well, she's ben good friends to me, any ways."</p>
<p>"All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?"</p>
<p>This question was not entirely answered in Huck's slow mind before he <lb/>
found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas's drawing-room. <lb/>
Mr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.</p>
<pb n="263" entity="DSSR_000002931_0278"/>
<p>The place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence <lb/>
in the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the Rogerses, <lb/>
Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great many more, and <lb/>
all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys as heartily as any one <lb/>
could well receive two such looking beings. They were covered with clay <lb/>
and candle grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson with humiliation, and frowned <lb/>
and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered half as much as the two boys <lb/>
did, however. Mr. Jones said:</p>
<p>"Tom wasn't at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and <lb/>
Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry."</p>
<p>"And you did just right," said the widow:&mdash;" Come with me, boys."</p>
<p>She took them to a bed chamber and said:</p>
<p>"Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of clothes&mdash; <lb/>
shirts, socks, everything complete. They're Huck's&mdash;no, no thanks, Huck&mdash; <lb/>
Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they'll fit both of you. Get into <lb/>
them. We'll wait&mdash;come down when you are slicked up enough."</p>
<p>Then she left.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Huck</hi> said: "Tom, we can slope, if we <lb/>

<p>"Shucks, what do you want to <lb/>

<p>"Well I ain't used to that kind of <lb/>

going down there, Tom."</p>
<p>"O, bother! It ain't anything. I <lb/>
don't mind it a bit. I'll take care of <lb/>
you."</p>
<p>Sid appeared.</p>
<p>"Tom," said he, "Auntie has been <lb/>
waiting for you all the afternoon. <lb/>
Mary got your Sunday clothes ready, <lb/>
and everybody's been fretting about you. Say&mdash;ain't this grease and clay, on <lb/>
your clothes?"</p>
<p>"Now Mr. Siddy, you jist 'tend to your own business. What's all this <reg orig="blow-|out">blowout</reg> <lb/>
about, anyway?"</p>
<pb n="265" entity="DSSR_000002931_0280"/>
<p>"It's one of the widow's parties that she's always having. This time its for <lb/>
the Welchman and his sons, on account of that scrape they helped her out of <lb/>
the other night. And say&mdash;I can tell you something, if you want to know."</p>
<p>"Well, what?"</p>
<p>"Why old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people <lb/>
here to-night, but I overheard him tell auntie to-day about it, as a secret, but <lb/>
I reckon it's not much of a secret <hi rend="italic">now</hi>. Everybody knows&mdash;the widow, too, for <lb/>
all she tries to let on she don't. Mr. Jones was bound Huck should be here&mdash; <lb/>
couldn't get along with his grand secret without Huck, you know!"</p>
<p>"Secret about what, Sid?"</p>
<p>"About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow's. I reckon Mr. Jones was <lb/>
going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop pretty <lb/>
flat."</p>
<p>Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.</p>
<p>"Sid, was it you that told?"</p>
<p>"O, never mind who it was. <hi rend="italic">Somebody</hi> told&mdash;that's enough."</p>
<p>"Sid, there's only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and that's <lb/>
you. If you had been in Huck's place you'd 'a' sneaked down the hill and never <lb/>
told anybody on the robbers. You can't do any but mean things, and you can't <lb/>
bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones. There&mdash;no thanks, as the <lb/>
widow says"&mdash;and Tom cuffed Sid's ears and helped him to the door with <lb/>
several kicks. "Now go and tell auntie if you dare&mdash;and to-morrow you'll <lb/>
catch it!"</p>
<p>Some minutes later the widow's guests were at the supper table, and a dozen <lb/>
children were propped up at little side tables in the same room, after the fashion <lb/>
of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr. Jones made his little <lb/>
speech, in which he thanked the widow for the honor she was doing himself <lb/>
and his sons, but said that there was another person whose modesty&mdash;</p>
<p>And so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck's share in the <reg orig="ad-|venture">adventure</reg> <lb/>
in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the surprise it <lb/>
occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and effusive as it <lb/>
might have been under happier circumstances. However, the widow made a <lb/>
<pb n="266" entity="DSSR_000002931_0281"/>
pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many compliments and so <lb/>
much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot the nearly intolerable <reg orig="dis-|comfort">discomfort</reg> <lb/>
of his new clothes in the entirely intolerable discomfort of being set <lb/>
up as a target for everybody's gaze and everybody's laudations.</p>
<p>The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have <lb/>
him educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in <lb/>
business in a modest way. Tom's chance was come. He said:</p>
<p>"Huck don't need it. Huck's rich!"</p>
<p>Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept <lb/>
back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But the <lb/>
silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f156" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002931_0281">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">tom backs his statement.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>"Huck's got money. Maybe you don't believe it, but he's got lots of it. Oh, <lb/>
you needn't smile&mdash;I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute."</p>
<pb n="267" entity="DSSR_000002931_0282"/>
<p>Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed <lb/>
interest&mdash;and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.</p>
<p>"Sid, what ails Tom?" said Aunt Polly. "He&mdash;well, there ain't ever any <lb/>
making of that boy out. I never&mdash;"</p>
<p>Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly did <lb/>
not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the table <lb/>
and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"There&mdash;what did I tell you? Half of it's Huck's and half of it's mine!"</p>
<p>The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for a <lb/>
moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said he <lb/>
could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brim full of interest. <lb/>
There was scarcely an interruption from anyone to break the charm of its <lb/>
flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said&mdash;</p>
<p>"I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it don't <lb/>
amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I'm willing <lb/>
to allow."</p>
<p>The money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg> <lb/>
dollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time <lb/>
before, though several persons were there who were worth considerably more <lb/>
than that in property.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> reader may rest satisfied that Tom's <lb/>
and Huck's windfall made a mighty stir <lb/>
in the poor little village of St. <reg orig="Peters-|burg">Petersburg</reg>. <lb/>
So vast a sum, all in actual cash, <lb/>
seemed next to incredible. It was talked <lb/>
about, gloated over, glorified, until the <lb/>
reason of many of the citizens tottered <lb/>
under the strain of the unhealthy <reg orig="ex-|citement">excitement</reg>. <lb/>
Every "haunted" house in <lb/>
St. Petersburg and the neighboring <reg orig="vil-|lages">villages</reg> <lb/>
was dissected, plank by plank, and <lb/>
its foundations dug up and ransacked <lb/>
for hidden treasure&mdash;and not by boys, <lb/>
but men&mdash;pretty grave, unromantic men, <lb/>
too, some of them. Wherever Tom and <lb/>
Huck appeared they were courted, <reg orig="ad-|mired">admired</reg>, <lb/>
stared at. The boys were not able <lb/>
to remember that their remarks had possessed weight before; but now their sayings <lb/>
were treasured and repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded <lb/>
<pb n="269" entity="DSSR_000002931_0284"/>
as remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying <reg orig="common-|place">common-place</reg> <lb/>
things; moreover, their past history was raked up and discovered to bear <lb/>
marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper published biographical <lb/>
sketches of the boys.</p>
<p>The widow Douglas put Huck's money out at six per cent., and Judge Thatcher <lb/>
did the same with Tom's at Aunt Polly's request. Each lad had an income, now, <lb/>
that was simply prodigious&mdash;a dollar for every week-day in the year and half of <lb/>
the Sundays. It was just what the minister got&mdash;no, it was what he was promised <lb/>
&mdash;he generally couldn't collect it. A dollar and a quarter a week would board, <lb/>
lodge and school a boy in those old simple days&mdash;and clothe him and wash him, <lb/>
too, for that matter.</p>
<p>Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no <lb/>
commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When <lb/>
Becky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her whipping at <lb/>
school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded grace for the mighty <lb/>
lie which Tom had told in order to shift that whipping from her shoulders to his <lb/>
own, the Judge said with a fine outburst that it was a noble, a generous, a <reg orig="mag-|nanimous">magnanimous</reg> <lb/>
lie&mdash;a lie that was worthy to hold up its head and march down through <lb/>
history breast to breast with George Washington's lauded Truth about the <lb/>
hatchet! Becky thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as <lb/>
when he walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight <lb/>
off and told Tom about it.</p>
<p>Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some day. <lb/>
He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the National <lb/>
military academy and afterwards trained in the best law school in the country, in <lb/>
order that he might be ready for either career or both.</p>
<p>Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was now under the widow Douglas's <lb/>
protection, introduced him into society&mdash;no, dragged him into it, hurled him into <lb/>
it&mdash;and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The widow's <lb/>
servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they bedded him <lb/>
nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot or stain which he <lb/>
could press to his heart and know for a friend. He had to eat with knife and <lb/>
<pb n="270" entity="DSSR_000002931_0285"/>
fork; he had to use napkin, cup and plate; he had to learn his book, he had to <lb/>
go to church; he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his <lb/>
mouth; whithersoever he turned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him <lb/>
in and bound him hand and foot.</p>
<p>He bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up missing. <lb/>
For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in great distress. <lb/>
The public were profoundly concerned; they searched high and low, they dragged <lb/>
the river for his body. Early the third morning Tom Sawyer wisely went poking <lb/>
among some old empty hogsheads down behind the abandoned slaughter-house, <lb/>
and in one of them he found the refugee. Huck had slept there; he had just <lb/>
breakfasted upon some stolen odds and ends of food, and was lying off, now, in <lb/>
comfort with his pipe. He was unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old <lb/>
ruin of rags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free and <lb/>
happy. Tom routed him out, told him the trouble he had been causing, and <lb/>
urged him to go home. Huck's face lost its tranquil content, and took a <reg orig="melan-|choly">melancholy</reg> <lb/>
cast. He said:</p>
<p>"Don't talk about it, Tom. I've tried it, and it don't work; it don't work, Tom. <lb/>
It ain't for me; I ain't used to it. The widder's good to me, and friendly; but I <lb/>
can't stand them ways. She makes me git up just at the same time every morning; <lb/>
she makes me wash, they comb me all to thunder; she won't let me sleep in <lb/>
the wood-shed; I got to wear them blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; <lb/>
they don't seem to any air git through 'em, somehow; and they're so rotten nice <lb/>
that I can't set down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher's; I hain't slid on a <lb/>
cellar-door for&mdash;well, it 'pears to be years; I got to go to church and sweat and <lb/>
sweat&mdash;I hate them ornery sermons! I can't ketch a fly in there, I can't chaw, <lb/>
I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by a bell; she goes to bed by a <lb/>
bell; she gits up by a bell&mdash;everything's so awful reg'lar a body can't stand it."</p>
<p>"Well, everybody does that way, Huck."</p>
<p>"Tom, it don't make no difference. I ain't everybody, and I can't <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> it. It's <lb/>
awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy&mdash;I don't take no interest in <lb/>
vittles, that way. I got to ask, to go a-fishing; I got to ask, to go in a-swimming&mdash; <lb/>
dern'd if I hain't got to ask to do everything. Well, I'd got to talk so nice it wasn't <lb/>

no comfort&mdash;I'd got to go up in the attic and rip out a while, every day, to git a <lb/>
taste in my mouth, or I'd a died, Tom. The widder wouldn't let me smoke; she <lb/>
wouldn't let me yell, she wouldn't let me gape, nor stretch, nor scratch, before <lb/>
folks&mdash;" [Then with a spasm of special irritation and injury],&mdash;"And dad fetch <lb/>
it, she prayed all the time! I never <hi rend="italic">see</hi> such a woman! I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to shove, Tom&mdash;I <lb/>

well, I wouldn't stand <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> Tom. Lookyhere, Tom, being rich ain't what it's <lb/>

you was dead all the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar'l suits me, <lb/>
and I ain't ever going to shake 'em any more. Tom, I wouldn't ever got into all <lb/>

along with your'n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes&mdash;not many times, becuz I <lb/>
<pb n="272" entity="DSSR_000002931_0287"/>
don't give a dern for a thing 'thout it's tollable hard to git&mdash;and you go and beg <lb/>
off for me with the widder."</p>
<p>"Oh, Huck, you know I can't do that. 'Taint fair; and besides if you'll try <lb/>
this thing just a while longer you'll come to like it."</p>
<p>"Like it! Yes&mdash;the way I'd like a hot stove if I was to set on it long enough. <lb/>
No, Tom, I won't be rich, and I won't live in them cussed smothery houses. I <lb/>
like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and I'll stick to 'em, too. Blame <lb/>
it all! just as we'd got guns, and a cave, and all just fixed to rob, here this dern <lb/>
foolishness has got to come up and spile it all!"</p>
<p>Tom saw his opportunity&mdash;</p>
<p>"Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain't going to keep me back from turning <lb/>
robber."</p>
<p>"No! Oh, good-licks, are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Just as dead earnest as I'm a sitting here. But Huck, we can't let you into <lb/>
the gang if you ain't respectable, you know."</p>
<p>Huck's joy was quenched.</p>
<p>"Can't let me in, Tom? Didn't you let me go for a pirate?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but that's different. A robber is more high-toned than what a pirate is&mdash; <lb/>
as a general thing. In most countries they're awful high up in the nobility&mdash; <lb/>
dukes and such."</p>
<p>"Now Tom, hain't you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn't shet me out, <lb/>
would you, Tom? You wouldn't do that, now, <hi rend="italic">would</hi> you, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Huck, I wouldn't want to, and I <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> want to&mdash;but what would people say? <lb/>
Why they'd say, 'Mph! Tom Sawyer's Gang! pretty low characters in it!' <lb/>
They'd mean you, Huck. You wouldn't like that, and I wouldn't."</p>
<p>Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he said:</p>
<p>"Well, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I can <lb/>
come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang, Tom."</p>
<p>"All right, Huck, it's a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I'll ask the widow <lb/>
to let up on you a little, Huck."</p>
<p>"Will you Tom&mdash;now will you? That's good. If she'll let up on some of the <lb/>
roughest things, I'll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd through or bust. <lb/>
When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?"</p>
<pb n="273" entity="DSSR_000002931_0288"/>
<p>"Oh, right off. We'll get the boys together and have the initiation to-night, <lb/>
maybe."</p>
<p>"Have the which?"</p>
<p>"Have the initiation."</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"It's to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang's secrets, even <lb/>
if you're chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and all his family that hurts one <lb/>
of the gang."</p>
<p>"That's gay&mdash;that's mighty gay, Tom, I tell you."</p>
<p>"Well I bet it is. And all that swearing's got to be done at midnight, in the <lb/>
lonesomest, awfulest place you can find&mdash;a ha'nted house is the best, but they're <lb/>
all ripped up now."</p>

<p>"Well, midnight's good, anyway, Tom."</p>
<p>"Yes, so it is. And you've got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with blood."</p>
<p>"Now that's something <hi rend="italic">like!</hi> Why it's a million times bullier than pirating. <lb/>
I'll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be a reg'lar ripper of a <lb/>
robber, and everybody talking 'bout it, I reckon she'll be proud she snaked me in <lb/>
out of the wet."</p>

<head>CONCLUSION.</head>
<ornament type="line"/>
<p>So endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a <hi rend="italic">boy,</hi> it must stop here; <lb/>
the story could not go much further without becoming the history of a <hi rend="italic">man.</hi> <lb/>
When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows exactly where to stop&mdash; <lb/>
that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of juveniles, he must stop where he <lb/>
best can.</p>
<p>Most of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are prosperous <lb/>
and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the story of the <lb/>
younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they turned out to be; <lb/>
therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that part of their lives at present.</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">the end.</hi></p>

<head>TO THE PUBLIC.</head>
<p>It has been claimed that books sold by Agents are higher in price than those of equal <lb/>
value sold at book-stores. This belief often prevents persons from buying of an Agent. <lb/>
So far as our books are concerned, there is no foundation for such a claim. Please consider <lb/>
the following statements.</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">First.</hi> Most of our books are fully illustrated, not only with full page but with text <reg orig="en-|gravings">engravings</reg>. <lb/>
These illustrations must be printed on something better than ordinary book <lb/>
paper, and to be well executed it requires the whole book to be on fine, heavy paper <lb/>
suitable for the cuts, costing very high. Again, the printing of the text with cuts costs more <lb/>
than twice the price of plain printing. Hence, few books are printed with text engravings. <lb/>
For proof, we ask you to count up all you can remember of them, aside from ours. <lb/>
You will find they are very few. Publishers avoid them universally.</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Second.</hi> We claim that we sell you books with from two hundred to three hundred <lb/>
engravings, finely printed on extra fine paper, and most firmly bound, as low as you can <lb/>
buy any book equal in <hi rend="italic">weight, size,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">popularity,</hi> which contain but few if any cuts, at any <lb/>
book-store; while you will be asked there for books illustrated as are our $3.50 ones (if <lb/>
they have any such) at least $5 or $6. We do not ask you to take our word for this, <lb/>
but to test it by enquiry and comparison. We certainly sell books lower than book-stores.</p>
<p>We allow our Agents exactly the discount on our price, that publishers allow the regular <lb/>
trade, and <hi rend="italic">no more;</hi> and as through our Agents we sell ten times more of our books than do <lb/>
the trade publishers, we can afford a better book for a given sum. We ask investigation on <lb/>
this subject that all my know whether we speak truly or not. We assert that no books of <lb/>
equal cost of the <hi rend="small-caps">"Beyond The Mississippi," &middot;'The Innocents Abroad," "Overland <lb/>
Through Asia," "Roughing It,"</hi> and others of our books have ever been sold in this <lb/>
country at the price we sell them at.</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Third.</hi> We employ only those Agents who enter into agreements with us, pledging <lb/>
themselves not to put any books into stores; and it is only through unreliable Agents that <lb/>
they are seen there. The great popularity of our works, and their ready sale make it an <lb/>
object for the trade to get them. Having, by some means, obtained them, dealers sometimes <lb/>
sell our books at a reduced price even without profit to themselves. This is done to injure <lb/>
Agents, and the Subscription-Business, and is the sole and only ground for the current belief <lb/>
that the trade sell books lower than the subscription houses.</p>
<p>Our Agents are instructed by us to introduce our books, but never to press them upon <lb/>
those who do not desire them. We publish none but valuable and popular work, and we <lb/>
bespeak for our Agents a kind reception.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi> says of us and one of our books:</p>
<p>"If this book can make its way among the Subscription-Book public, it will do a vast <lb/>
service to literature in educating the popular taste to the appreciation of good reading, <lb/>
and the time will yet come when the Book-Agent will be welcomed at all our doors instead <lb/>
of warned from them by every prohibitory device."</p>
<p>Also says the <hi rend="italic">New York Journal of Commerce:</hi></p>
<p>"This is precisely the sort of book which every one ought to be glad to have thrust in his <lb/>
face and urged on his attention. The purchaser will be grateful to the agent who has <lb/>
induced him to buy it."</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Such commendations from such authority speak volumes for our books.</hi></p>
