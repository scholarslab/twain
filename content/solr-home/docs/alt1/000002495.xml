as Beatrice passed along on her way to get a chunk <lb/>
of chestnut cake to defend herself with in case of a <lb/>
Ghibelline outbreak before she got to school, at the <lb/>

this day and it is just as light and good as it was <lb/>
then, too, and this is not flattery, far from it. He <lb/>

this book, and those two or three legal chapters are <lb/>
right and straight, now. He told me so himself.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> scene of this chronicle is the town of <lb/>

the Mississippi, half a day's journey, per <lb/>

<figure id="f6" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0022"/>
<p>In 1830 it was a snug little collection of <lb/>
modest one- and two-story frame dwellings <lb/>
whose whitewashed exteriors were almost <lb/>
concealed from sight by climbing tangles of <lb/>
rose-vines, honeysuckles and morning-glories. <lb/>
Each of these pretty homes had a garden in <lb/>
front fenced with white palings and opulently <lb/>
stocked with hollyhocks, marigolds, touch-<reg orig="me-|nots">menots</reg>, <lb/>
prince's-feathers and other old-fashioned <lb/>
flowers; while on the window-sills of the <lb/>
houses stood wooden boxes containing <reg orig="moss-|rose">moss-rose</reg> <lb/>

plants and terra-cotta pots in which grew <lb/>
a breed of geranium whose spread of intensely <lb/>
red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tink <lb/>
of the rose-clad house-front like an explosion <lb/>
of flame. When there was room on the <lb/>
ledge outside of the pots and boxes for a cat, <lb/>
the cat was there&mdash;in sunny weather&mdash; <lb/>
stretched at full length, asleep and blissful, <lb/>
with her furry belly to the sun and a paw <lb/>
curved over her nose. Then that house was <lb/>
complete, and its contentment and peace were <lb/>
made manifest to the world by this symbol, <lb/>
whose testimony is infallible. A home <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
a cat&mdash;and a well-fed, well-petted and <lb/>
properly revered cat&mdash;may be a perfect home, <lb/>
perhaps, but how can it prove title?</p>
<figure id="f9" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0023"/>
<p>All along the streets, on both sides, at the <lb/>
outer edge of the brick sidewalks, stood <lb/>
locust-trees with trunks protected by wooden <lb/>
boxing, and these furnished shade for <reg orig="sum-|mer">summer</reg> <lb/>
and a sweet fragrance in spring when the <lb/>
clusters of buds came forth. The main street, <lb/>
one block back from the river, and running <lb/>
parallel with it, was the sole business street. <lb/>
It was six blocks long, and in each block two <lb/>
<figure id="f10" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0023"/>
<pb n="19" entity="DSSR_000002495_0024"/>
or three brick stores three stories high towered <lb/>
above interjected bunches of little frame shops. <lb/>
Swinging signs creaked in the wind, the <lb/>
street's whole length. The candy-striped <lb/>
pole which indicates nobility proud and <lb/>
ancient along the palace-bordered canals of <lb/>
Venice, indicated merely the humble <reg orig="barber-|shop">barbershop</reg> <lb/>
along the main street of Dawson's <lb/>
Landing. On a chief corner stood a lofty <lb/>
unpainted pole wreathed from top to bottom <lb/>
with tin pots and pans and cups, the chief <lb/>
tinmonger's noisy notice to the world (when <lb/>
the wind blew) that his shop was on hand for <lb/>
business at that corner.</p>
<p>The hamlet's front was washed by the clear <lb/>
waters of the great river; its body stretched <lb/>
itself rearward up a gentle incline; its most <lb/>
rearward border fringed itself out and <reg orig="scat-|tered">scattered</reg> <lb/>
its houses about the base-line of the <lb/>
hills; the hills rose high, inclosing the town <lb/>
in a half-moon curve, clothed with forests <lb/>
from foot to summit.</p>
<figure id="f11" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0024"/>
<p>Steamboats passed up and down every hour <lb/>
or so. Those belonging to the little Cairo <lb/>
line and the little Memphis line always <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="DSSR_000002495_0025"/>
stopped; the big Orleans liners stopped for <lb/>
hails only, or to land passengers or freight; <lb/>
and this was the case also with the great <lb/>
flotilla of "transients." These latter came <lb/>
out of a dozen rivers&mdash;the Illinois, the <reg orig="Miss-|ouri">Missouri</reg>, <lb/>
the Upper Mississippi, the Ohio, the <lb/>
Monongahela, the Tennessee, the Red River, <lb/>
the White River, and so on; and were bound <lb/>
every whither and stocked with every <reg orig="imagin-|able">imaginable</reg> <lb/>
comfort or necessity which the <reg orig="Miss-|issippi's">Mississippi's</reg> <lb/>
communities could want, from the <lb/>
frosty Falls of St. Anthony down through <lb/>
nine climates to torrid New Orleans.</p>
<figure id="f12" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0025"/>
<p>Dawson's Landing was a slavcholding <lb/>
town, with a rich slave-worked grain and pork <lb/>
country back of it. The town was sleepy and <lb/>
comfortable and contented. It was fifty years <lb/>
old, and was growing slowly&mdash;very slowly, in <lb/>
fact, but still it was growing.</p>
<p>The chief citizen was York Leicester <reg orig="Dris-|coll">Driscoll</reg>, <lb/>
about forty years old, judge of the <lb/>
country court. He was very proud of his old <lb/>
Virginian ancestry, and in his hospitalities <lb/>
and his rather formal and stately manners he <lb/>
kept up its traditions. He was fine and just <lb/>
<figure id="f13" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0025"/>
<pb n="21" entity="DSSR_000002495_0026"/>
and generous. To be a gentleman&mdash;a <reg orig="gentle-|man">gentleman</reg> <lb/>
without stain or blemish&mdash;was his only <lb/>
religion, and to it he was always faithful. <lb/>
He was respected, esteemed and beloved by <lb/>
all the community. He was well off, and was <lb/>
gradually adding to his store. He and his <lb/>
wife were very nearly happy, but not quite, <lb/>
for they had no children. The longing for <lb/>
the treasure of a child had grown stronger <lb/>
and stronger as the years slipped away, but <lb/>
the blessing never came&mdash;and was never to <lb/>
come.</p>
<figure id="f14" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0026"/>
<p>With this pair lived the Judge's widowed <lb/>
sister, Mrs. Rachel Pratt, and she also was <lb/>
childless&mdash;childless, and sorrowful for that <lb/>
reason, and not to be comforted. The women <lb/>
were good and commonplace people, and did <lb/>
their duty and had their reward in clear <reg orig="con-|sciences">consciences</reg> <lb/>
and the community's approbation. <lb/>
They were Presbyterians, the Judge was a <lb/>
free-thinker.</p>
<figure id="f15" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0026"/>
<p>Pembroke Howard, lawyer and bachelor, <lb/>
aged about forty, was another old Virginian <lb/>
grandee with proved descent from the First <lb/>
Families. He was a fine, brave, majestic <lb/>
<figure id="f16" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0026"/>
<figure id="f17" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0026"/>
<pb n="22" entity="DSSR_000002495_0027"/>
creature, a gentleman according to the nicest <lb/>
requirements of the Virginia rule, a devoted <lb/>
Presbyterian, an authority on the "code," and <lb/>
a man always courteously ready to stand up <lb/>
before you in the field if any act or word of <lb/>
his had seemed doubtful or suspicious to you, <lb/>
and explain it with any weapon you might <lb/>
prefer from brad-awls to artillery. He was <lb/>
very popular with the people, and was the <lb/>
Judge's dearest friend.</p>
<figure id="f18" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0027"/>
<p>Then there was Colonel Cecil Burleigh <lb/>
Essex, another F. F. V. of formidable caliber <lb/>
&mdash;however, with him we have no concern.</p>
<figure id="f19" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0027"/>
<p>Percy Northumberland Driscoll, brother to <lb/>
the Judge, and younger than he by five years, <lb/>
was a married man, and had had children <lb/>
around his hearthstone; but they were <reg orig="at-|tacked">attacked</reg> <lb/>
in detail by measles, croup and <reg orig="scar-|let">scarlet</reg> <lb/>
fever, and this had given the doctor a <lb/>
chance with his effective antediluvian methods; <lb/>
so the cradles were empty. He was a <reg orig="pros-|perous">prosperous</reg> <lb/>
man, with a good head for <reg orig="specula-|tions">speculations</reg>, <lb/>
and his fortune was growing. On the <lb/>
1st of February, 1830, two boy babes were <lb/>
born in his house: one to him, the other to <lb/>
<figure id="f20" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0027"/>
<pb n="23" entity="DSSR_000002495_0028"/>
one of his slave girls, Roxana by name. <lb/>
Roxana was twenty years old. She was up <lb/>
and around the same day, with her hands full, <lb/>
for she was tending both babies.</p>
<p>Mrs. Percy Driscoll died within the week. <lb/>
Roxy remained in charge of the children. <lb/>
She had her own way, for Mr. Driscoll soon <lb/>
absorbed himself in his speculations and left <lb/>
her to her own devices.</p>
<figure id="f21" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0028"/>
<p>In that same month of February, Dawson's <lb/>
Landing gained a new citizen. This was Mr. <lb/>
David Wilson, a young fellow of Scotch <lb/>
parentage. He had wandered to this remote <lb/>
region from his birthplace in the interior of <lb/>
the State of New York, to seek his fortune. <lb/>
He was twenty-five years old, college-bred, <lb/>
and had finished a post-college course in an <lb/>
Eastern law school a couple of years before.</p>
<figure id="f22" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0028"/>
<p>He was a homely, freckled, sandy-haired <lb/>
young fellow, with an intelligent blue eye that <lb/>
had frankness and comradeship in it and a <lb/>
covert twinkle of a pleasant sort. But for an <lb/>
unfortunate remark of his, he would no doubt <lb/>
have entered at once upon a successful career at <lb/>
Dawson's Landing. But he made his fatal <reg orig="re-|mark">remark</reg> <lb/>
<figure id="f23" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0028"/>
<pb n="24" entity="DSSR_000002495_0029"/>
the first day he spent in the village, and it <lb/>
"gaged" him. He had just made the <reg orig="acquain-|tance">acquaintance</reg> <lb/>
of a group of citizens when an invisible <lb/>
dog began to yelp and snarl and howl and <lb/>
make himself very comprehensively <reg orig="disagree-|able">disagreeable</reg>, <lb/>
whereupon young Wilson said, much as <lb/>
one who is thinking aloud&mdash;</p>
<p>"I wish I owned half of that dog."</p>
<p>"Why?" somebody asked.</p>
<p>"Because I would kill my half."</p>
<figure id="f24" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0029"/>
<p>The group searched his face with curiosity, <lb/>
with anxiety even, but found no light there, no <lb/>
expression that they could read. They fell <lb/>
away from him as from something uncanny, and <lb/>
went into privacy to discuss him. One said:</p>
<p>"'Pears to be a fool."</p>
<p>"'Pears?" said another. "<hi rend="italic">Is</hi>, I reckon you <lb/>
better say."</p>
<p>"Said he wished he owned <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of the dog, <lb/>
the idiot," said a third. "What did he reckon <lb/>
would become of the other half if he killed his <lb/>
half? Do you reckon he thought it would <lb/>
live?"</p>
<p>"Why, he must have thought it, unless he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> <lb/>
the downrightest fool in the world; because if <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="DSSR_000002495_0030"/>
he had n't thought it, he would have wanted <lb/>
to own the whole dog, knowing that if he killed <lb/>
his half and the other half died, he would be <lb/>
responsible for that half just the same as if he <lb/>
had killed that half instead of his own. Don't <lb/>
it look that way to you, gents?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it does. If he owned one half of the <lb/>
general dog, it would be so; if he owned one <lb/>

but by that time the nickname had got well <lb/>
stuck on, and it stayed. That first day's <reg orig="ver-|dict">verdict</reg> <lb/>

was to continue to hold its place for twenty long <lb/>
years.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Pudd'nhead Wilson</hi> had a trifle of money <lb/>
when he arrived, and he bought a small house <lb/>
on the extreme western verge of the town. <reg orig="Be-|tween">Between</reg> <lb/>
it and Judge Driscoll's house there was <lb/>
only a grassy yard, with a paling fence <reg orig="divid-|ing">dividing</reg> <lb/>
the properties in the middle. He hired a <lb/>
small office down in the town and hung out <lb/>
a tin sign with these words on it:</p>
<figure id="f27" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0032"/>
<p rend="center">DAVID WILSON.</p>
<p>ATTORNEY AND COUNSELOR-AT-LAW. </p>
<p>SURVEYING, CONVEYANCING, ETC.</p>
<p>But his deadly remark had ruined his chance <lb/>
&mdash;at least in the law. No clients came. He <lb/>

<figure id="f29" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0032"/>
<pb n="28" entity="DSSR_000002495_0033"/>
took down his sign, after a while, and put it up <lb/>
on his own house with the law features knocked <lb/>
out of it. It offered his services now in the <lb/>
humble capacities of land-surveyor and expert <lb/>
accountant. Now and then he got a job of <reg orig="sur-|veying">surveying</reg> <lb/>
to do, and now and then a merchant got <lb/>
him to straighten out his books. With Scotch <lb/>
patience and pluck he resolved to live down his <lb/>
reputation and work his way into the legal <lb/>
field yet. Poor fellow, he could not foresee <lb/>
that it was going to take him such a weary <lb/>
long time to do it.</p>
<figure id="f30" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0033"/>
<p>He had a rich abundance of idle time, but <lb/>
it never hung heavy on his hands, for he <reg orig="in-|terested">interested</reg> <lb/>
himself in every new thing that was <lb/>
born into the universe of ideas, and studied it <lb/>
and experimented upon it at his house. One <lb/>
of his pet fads was palmistry. To another one <lb/>
he gave no name, neither would he explain to <lb/>
anybody what its purpose was, but merely said <lb/>
it was an amusement. In fact he had found <lb/>
that his fads added to his reputation as a <reg orig="pud-|d'nhead">pudd'nhead</reg>; <lb/>
therefore he was growing chary of <lb/>
being too communicative about them. The <lb/>
fad without a name was one which dealt with <lb/>
<figure id="f31" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0033"/>
<pb n="29" entity="DSSR_000002495_0034"/>
people's finger-marks. He carried in his coat <lb/>
pocket a shallow box with grooves in it, and <lb/>
in the grooves strips of glass five inches long <lb/>
and three inches wide. Along the lower edge <lb/>
of each strip was pasted a slip of white paper. <lb/>
He asked people to pass their hands through <lb/>
their hair (thus collecting upon them a thin <lb/>
coating of the natural oil) and then make a <lb/>
thumb-mark on a glass strip, following it with <lb/>
the mark of the ball of each finger in <reg orig="succes-|sion">succession</reg>. <lb/>
Under this row of faint grease-prints he <lb/>
would write a record on the strip of white <reg orig="pa-|per&mdash;thus">paper&mdash;thus</reg>:</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="small-caps">John Smith,</hi> <hi rend="italic">right hand&mdash;</hi></p>
<figure id="f32" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0034"/>
<p>and add the day of the month and the year, <lb/>
then take Smith's left hand on another glass <lb/>
strip, and add name and date and the words <lb/>
"left hand." The strips were now returned <lb/>
to the grooved box, and took their place <lb/>
among what Wilson called his "records."</p>
<p>He often studied his records, examining and <lb/>
poring over them with absorbing interest until <lb/>
far into the night; but what he found there&mdash; <lb/>
<figure id="f33" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0034"/>
<pb n="30" entity="DSSR_000002495_0035"/>
if he found anything&mdash;he revealed to no one. <lb/>
Sometimes he copied on paper the involved <lb/>
and delicate pattern left by the ball of a finger, <lb/>
and then vastly enlarged it with a pantograph <lb/>
so that he could examine its web of curving <lb/>
lines with ease and convenience.</p>
<p>One sweltering afternoon&mdash;it was the first <lb/>
day of July, 1830&mdash;he was at work over a set <lb/>
of tangled account-books in his work-room, <lb/>
which looked westward over a stretch of <reg orig="va-|cant">vacant</reg> <lb/>
lots, when a conversation outside <reg orig="dis-|turbed">disturbed</reg> <lb/>
him. It was carried on in yells, which <lb/>
showed that the people engaged in it were not <lb/>
close together:</p>
<figure id="f34" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0035"/>
<p>"Say, Roxy, how does yo' baby come on?" <lb/>
This from the distant voice.</p>
<p>"Fust-rate; how does <hi rend="italic">you</hi> come on, <reg orig="Jas-|per">Jasper</reg>?" <lb/>
This yell was from close by.</p>
<p>"Oh, I 's middlin'; hain't got noth'n' to <lb/>

you bimeby, Roxy."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">You</hi> is, you black mud-cat! Yah&mdash;yah&mdash; <lb/>

<figure id="f35" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0035"/>
<pb n="31" entity="DSSR_000002495_0036"/>
Roxy followed this sally with another <reg orig="dis-|charge">discharge</reg> <lb/>
of care-free laughter.</p>
<p>"You 's jealous, Roxy, dat 's what 's de <lb/>
matter wid <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> you hussy&mdash;yah&mdash;yah&mdash;yah! <lb/>
Dat 's de time I got you!"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> got me, hain't you. 'Clah to <lb/>

to me I 'd sell you down de river 'fo' you git <lb/>
too fur gone. Fust time I runs acrost yo' <lb/>
marster, I 's gwine to tell him so."</p>
<p>This idle and aimless jabber went on and <lb/>
on, both parties enjoying the friendly duel and <lb/>
each well satisfied with his own share of the <lb/>
wit exchanged&mdash;for wit they considered it.</p>
<figure id="f36" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0036"/>
<p>Wilson stepped to the window to observe <lb/>
the combatants; he could not work while their <lb/>
chatter continued. Over in the vacant lots was <lb/>
Jasper, young, coal-black and of magnificent <lb/>
build, sitting on a wheelbarrow in the pelting <lb/>
sun&mdash;at work, supposably, whereas he was in <lb/>
fact only preparing for it by taking an hour's <lb/>
rest before beginning. In front of Wilson's <lb/>
porch stood Roxy, with a local hand-made <lb/>
baby-wagon, in which sat her two charges&mdash; <lb/>
<figure id="f37" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0036"/>
<pb n="32" entity="DSSR_000002495_0037"/>
one at each end and facing each other. From <lb/>
Roxy's manner of speech, a stranger would <lb/>
have expected her to be black, but she was <lb/>
not. Only one sixteenth of her was black, and <lb/>
that sixteenth did not show. She was of <reg orig="ma-|jestic">majestic</reg> <lb/>
form and stature, her attitudes were <lb/>
imposing and statuesque, and her gestures <lb/>
and movements distinguished by a noble and <lb/>
stately grace. Her complexion was very fair, <lb/>
with the rosy glow of vigorous health in the <lb/>
cheeks, her face was full of character and <reg orig="ex-|pression">expression</reg>, <lb/>
her eyes were brown and liquid, and <lb/>
she had a heavy suit of fine soft hair which was <lb/>
also brown, but the fact was not apparent <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
her head was bound about with a <reg orig="check-|ered">checkered</reg> <lb/>
handkerchief and the hair was concealed <lb/>
under it. Her face was shapely, intelligent <lb/>
and comely&mdash;even beautiful. She had an easy, <lb/>
independent carriage&mdash;when she was among <lb/>
her own caste&mdash;and a high and "sassy" way, <lb/>
withal; but of course she was meek and <reg orig="hum-|ble">humble</reg> <lb/>
enough where white people were.</p>
<figure id="f38" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0037"/>
<p>To all intents and purposes Roxy was as <lb/>
white as anybody, but the one sixteenth of <lb/>
her which was black outvoted the other fifteen <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="DSSR_000002495_0038"/>
parts and made her a negro. She was a <lb/>
slave, and salable as such. Her child was <lb/>
thirty-one parts white, and he, too, was a <lb/>
slave, and by a fiction of law and custom a <lb/>
negro. He had blue eyes and flaxen curls <lb/>
like his white comrade, but even the father <lb/>
of the white child was able to tell the children <lb/>
apart&mdash;little as he had commerce with them&mdash; <lb/>
by their clothes: for the white babe wore <lb/>
ruffled soft muslin and a coral necklace, while <lb/>
the other wore merely a coarse tow-linen <lb/>
shirt which barely reached to its knees, and <lb/>
no jewelry.</p>
<figure id="f39" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0038"/>
<p>The white child's name was Thomas &agrave; <lb/>
Becket Driscoll, the other's name was Valet <lb/>
de Chambre: no surname&mdash;slaves had n't the <lb/>
privilege. Roxana had heard that phrase <lb/>
somewhere, the fine sound of it had pleased <lb/>
her ear, and as she had supposed it was a <lb/>
name, she loaded it on to her darling. It <lb/>
soon got shortened to "Chambers," of course.</p>
<figure id="f40" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0038"/>
<p>Wilson knew Roxy by sight, and when the <lb/>
duel of wit began to play out, he stepped <reg orig="out-|side">outside</reg> <lb/>
to gather in a record or two. Jasper <lb/>
went to work energetically, at once, <reg orig="perceiv-|ing">perceiving</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="DSSR_000002495_0039"/>
that his leisure was observed. Wilson <lb/>
inspected the children and asked&mdash;</p>
<p>"How old are they, Roxy?"</p>
<p>"Bofe de same age, sir&mdash;five months. <lb/>
Bawn de fust o' Feb'uary."</p>
<p>"They're handsome little chaps. One's <lb/>
just as handsome as the other, too."</p>
<p>A delighted smile exposed the girl's white <lb/>
teeth, and she said:</p>
<p>"Bless yo' soul, Misto Wilson, it 's pow'ful <lb/>
nice o' you to say dat, 'ca'se one of 'em ain't <lb/>
on'y a nigger. Mighty prime little nigger, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> <lb/>
al'ays says, but dat's ca'se it's mine, o' course."</p>
<p>"How do you tell them apart, Roxy, when <lb/>
they have n't any clothes on?"</p>
<p>Roxy laughed a laugh proportioned to her <lb/>
size, and said:</p>
<p>"Oh, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> kin tell 'em 'part, Misto Wilson, but <lb/>
I bet Marse Percy could n't, not to save his <lb/>
life."</p>
<figure id="f41" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0039"/>
<p>Wilson chatted along for awhile, and <reg orig="pres-|ently">presently</reg> <lb/>
got Roxy's finger-prints for his <reg orig="collec-|tion&mdash;right">collection&mdash;right</reg> <lb/>
hand and left&mdash;on a couple of his <lb/>
glass strips; then labeled and dated them, and <lb/>
took the "records" of both children, and <lb/>
labeled and dated them also.</p>
<figure id="f42" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0039"/>
<pb n="35" entity="DSSR_000002495_0040"/>
<p>Two months later, on the 3d of September, <lb/>
he took this trio of finger-marks again. He <lb/>
liked to have a "series," two or three "<reg orig="tak-|ings">takings</reg>" <lb/>
at intervals during the period of <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg>, <lb/>
these to be followed by others at <reg orig="inter-|vals">intervals</reg> <lb/>
of several years.</p>
<p>The next day&mdash;that is to say, on the 4th of <lb/>
September&mdash;something occurred which <reg orig="pro-|foundly">profoundly</reg> <lb/>
impressed Roxana. Mr. Driscoll <lb/>
missed another small sum of money&mdash;which is <lb/>
a way of saying that this was not a new thing, <lb/>
but had happened before. In truth it had <lb/>
happened three times before. Driscoll's <lb/>
patience was exhausted. He was a fairly <lb/>
humane man toward slaves and other animals; <lb/>
he was an exceedingly humane man toward <lb/>
the erring of his own race. Theft he could <lb/>
not abide, and plainly there was a thief in his <lb/>
house. Necessarily the thief must be one of <lb/>
his negroes. Sharp measures must be taken. <lb/>
He called his servants before him. There <lb/>
were three of these, besides Roxy: a man, a <lb/>
woman, and a boy twelve years old. They <lb/>
were not related. Mr. Driscoll said:</p>
<p>"You have all been warned before. It has <lb/>
<figure id="f43" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0040"/>
<pb n="36" entity="DSSR_000002495_0041"/>
done no good. This time I will teach you a <lb/>
lesson. I will sell the thief. Which of you <lb/>
is the guilty one?"</p>
<p>They all shuddered at the threat, for here <lb/>
they had a good home, and a new one was <lb/>
likely to be a change for the worse. The <reg orig="de-|nial">denial</reg> <lb/>
was general. None had stolen anything <lb/>
&mdash;not money, anyway&mdash;a little sugar, or cake, <lb/>
or honey, or something like that, that "Marse <lb/>
Percy wouldn't mind or miss," but not money <lb/>
&mdash;never a cent of money. They were <reg orig="elo-|quent">eloquent</reg> <lb/>
in their protestations, but Mr. Driscoll <lb/>
was not moved by them. He answered each <lb/>
in turn with a stern "Name the thief!"</p>
<p>The truth was, all were guilty but Roxana; <lb/>
she suspected that the others were guilty, but <lb/>
she did not know them to be so. She was <lb/>
horrified to think how near she had come to <lb/>
being guilty herself; she had been saved in <lb/>
the nick of time by a revival in the colored <lb/>
Methodist Church, a fortnight before, at <lb/>
which time and place she "got religion." <lb/>
The very next day after that gracious <reg orig="experi-|ence">experience</reg>, <lb/>
while her change of style was fresh <lb/>
upon her and she was vain of her purified <lb/>
<figure id="f44" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0041"/>
<figure id="f45" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0041"/>
<pb n="37" entity="DSSR_000002495_0042"/>
condition, her master left a couple of dollars <lb/>
lying unprotected on his desk, and she <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg> <lb/>
upon that temptation when she was <lb/>
polishing around with a dust-rag. She looked <lb/>
at the money awhile with a steadily rising <reg orig="re-|sentment">resentment</reg>, <lb/>
then she burst out with&mdash;</p>
<p>"Dad blame dat revival, I wisht it had 'a' <lb/>
be'n put off till to-morrow!"</p>
<p>Then she covered the tempter with a book, <lb/>
and another member of the kitchen cabinet <lb/>
got it. She made this sacrifice as a matter of <lb/>
religious etiquette; as a thing necessary just <lb/>
now, but by no means to be wrested into a <lb/>
precedent; no, a week or two would limber <lb/>
up her piety, then she would be rational <lb/>
again, and the next two dollars that got left <lb/>
out in the cold would find a comforter&mdash;and <lb/>
she could name the comforter.</p>
<figure id="f46" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0042"/>
<p>Was she bad? Was she worse than the <lb/>
general run of her race? No. They had an <lb/>
unfair show in the battle of life, and they held <lb/>
it no sin to take military advantage of the <reg orig="en-|emy&mdash;in">enemy&mdash;in</reg> <lb/>
a small way; in a small way, but not <lb/>
in a large one. They would smouch <reg orig="provi-|sions">provisions</reg> <lb/>
from the pantry whenever they got a <lb/>
<figure id="f47" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0042"/>
<pb n="38" entity="DSSR_000002495_0043"/>
chance; or a brass thimble, or a cake of wax, <lb/>
or an emery-bag, or a paper of needles, or a <lb/>
silver spoon, or a dollar bill, or small articles <lb/>
of clothing, or any other property of light <lb/>
value; and so far were they from considering <lb/>
such reprisals sinful, that they would go to <lb/>
church and shout and pray the loudest and <lb/>
sincerest with their plunder in their pockets. <lb/>
A farm smoke-house had to be kept heavily <lb/>
padlocked, for even the colored deacon <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
could not resist a ham when Providence <lb/>
showed him in a dream, or otherwise, where <lb/>
such a thing hung lonesome and longed for <lb/>
some one to love. But with a hundred <reg orig="hang-|ing">hanging</reg> <lb/>
before him the deacon would not take <lb/>
two&mdash;that is, on the same night. On frosty <lb/>
nights the humane negro prowler would warm <lb/>
the end of a plank and put it up under the <lb/>
cold claws of chickens roosting in a tree; a <lb/>
drowsy hen would step on to the comfortable <lb/>
board, softly clucking her gratitude, and the <lb/>
prowler would dump her into his bag, and <lb/>
later into his stomach, perfectly sure that in <lb/>
taking this trifle from the man who daily <lb/>
robbed him of an inestimable treasure&mdash;his <lb/>
<figure id="f48" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0043"/>
<pb n="39" entity="DSSR_000002495_0044"/>
liberty&mdash;he was not committing any sin that <lb/>
God would remember against him in the Last <lb/>
Great Day.</p>
<p>"Name the thief!"</p>
<p>For the fourth time Mr. Driscoll had said <lb/>
it, and always in the same hard tone. And <lb/>
now he added these words of awful import:</p>
<p>"I give you one minute"&mdash;he took out his <lb/>
watch. "If at the end of that time you have <lb/>
not confessed, I will not only sell all four of <lb/>
you, <hi rend="italic">but</hi>&mdash; I will sell you <hi rend="small-caps">down the river</hi>!"</p>
<figure id="f49" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0044"/>
<p>It was equivalent to condemning them to <lb/>
hell! No Missouri negro doubted this. <lb/>
Roxy reeled in her tracks and the color <reg orig="van-|ished">vanished</reg> <lb/>
out of her face; the others dropped to <lb/>
their knees as if they had been shot; tears <lb/>
gushed from their eyes, their supplicating <lb/>
hands went up, and three answers came in the <lb/>
one instant:</p>
<p>"I done it!"</p>
<p>"I done it!"</p>
<p>"I done it!&mdash;have mercy, marster&mdash;Lord <lb/>
have mercy on us po' niggers!"</p>
<figure id="f50" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0044"/>
<p>"Very good," said the master, putting up his <lb/>
watch, "I will sell you <hi rend="italic">here</hi> though you don't <lb/>

deserve it. You ought to be sold down the <lb/>
river."</p>
<p>The culprits flung themselves prone, in an <lb/>
ecstasy of gratitude, and kissed his feet, <reg orig="de-|claring">declaring</reg> <lb/>
that they would never forget his <reg orig="good-|ness">goodness</reg> <lb/>
and never cease to pray for him as long <lb/>
as they lived. They were sincere, for like a <lb/>
god he had stretched forth his mighty hand <lb/>
and closed the gates of hell against them. <lb/>
He knew, himself, that he had done a noble <lb/>
and gracious thing, and was privately well <lb/>
pleased with his magnanimity; and that night <lb/>
he set the incident down in his diary, so that <lb/>
his son might read it in after years, and be <lb/>
thereby moved to deeds of gentleness and <lb/>
humanity himself.</p>

<p>Once, when she was tucking it back in its <lb/>

cradle again, the other child nestled in its <lb/>
sleep and attracted her attention. She went <lb/>
and stood over it a long time communing with <lb/>
herself:</p>
<p>"What has my po' baby done, dat he <lb/>
couldn't have yo' luck? He hain't done <lb/>
noth'n'. God was good to you; why warn't <lb/>
he good to him? Dey can't sell <hi rend="italic">you</hi> down de <lb/>
river. I hates yo' pappy; he hain't got no <lb/>
heart&mdash;for niggers he hain't, anyways. I <lb/>
hates him, en I could kill him!" She paused <lb/>
awhile, thinking; then she burst into wild <lb/>
sobbings again, and turned away, saying, <lb/>
"Oh, I got to kill my chile, dey ain't no <lb/>
yuther way,&mdash;killin' <hi rend="italic">him</hi> wouldn't save de chile <lb/>
fum goin' down de river. Oh, I got to do it, <lb/>
yo' po' mammy's got to kill you to save you, <lb/>
honey"&mdash;she gathered her baby to her bosom, <lb/>
now, and began to smother it with caresses&mdash; <lb/>
"Mammy's got to kill you&mdash;how <hi rend="italic">kin</hi> I do it! <lb/>
But yo' mammy ain't gwine to desert you&mdash; <lb/>
no, no; <hi rend="italic">dah</hi>, don't cry&mdash;she gwine <hi rend="italic">wid</hi> you, <lb/>
she gwine to kill herself too. Come along, <lb/>
honey, come along wid mammy; we gwine to <lb/>

is all over&mdash;dey don't sell po' niggers down the <lb/>
river over <hi rend="italic">yonder.</hi>"</p>
<p>She started toward the door, crooning to the <lb/>
child and hushing it; midway she stopped, <lb/>
suddenly. She had caught sight of her new <lb/>
Sunday gown&mdash;a cheap curtain-calico thing, <lb/>
a conflagration of gaudy colors and fantastic <lb/>
figures. She surveyed it wistfully, longingly.</p>
<p>"Hain't ever wore it yet," she said, "en it's <lb/>
jist lovely." Then she nodded her head in <reg orig="re-|sponse">response</reg> <lb/>
to a pleasant idea, and added, "No, I <lb/>
ain't gwine to be fished out, wid everybody <lb/>
lookin' at me, in dis mis'able ole <reg orig="linsey-|woolsey">linsey-woolsey</reg>."</p>
<figure id="f56" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0048"/>
<p>She put down the child and made the change. <lb/>
She looked in the glass and was astonished at <lb/>
her beauty. She resolved to make her <reg orig="death-|toilet">death-toilet</reg> <lb/>
perfect. She took off her <reg orig="handkerchief-|turban">handkerchief-turban</reg> <lb/>
and dressed her glossy wealth of hair <lb/>
"like white folks"; she added some odds and <lb/>
ends of rather lurid ribbon and a spray of <reg orig="atro-|cious">atrocious</reg> <lb/>
artificial flowers; finally she threw over <lb/>
her shoulders a fluffy thing called a "cloud' <lb/>
in that day, which was of a blazing red <reg orig="com-|plexion">complexion</reg>. <lb/>
Then she was ready for the tomb</p>
<figure id="f57" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0048"/>
<pb n="44" entity="DSSR_000002495_0049"/>
<p>She gathered up her baby once more; but <lb/>
when her eye fell upon its miserably short <lb/>
little gray tow-linen shirt and noted the <reg orig="con-|trast">contrast</reg> <lb/>
between its pauper shabbiness and her <lb/>
own volcanic irruption of infernal splendors, <lb/>
her mother-heart was touched, and she was <lb/>
ashamed.</p>
<p>"No, dolling, mammy ain't gwine to treat <lb/>
you so. De angels is gwine to 'mire you jist <lb/>
as much as dey does yo' mammy. Ain't <lb/>
gwine to have 'em putt'n' dey han's up 'fo' <lb/>
dey eyes en sayin' to David en Goliah en <lb/>
dem yuther prophets, 'Dat chile is dress' too <lb/>
indelicate fo' dis place.'"</p>
<p>By this time she had stripped off the shirt. <lb/>
Now she clothed the naked little creature in <lb/>
one of Thomas &agrave; Becket's snowy long <reg orig="baby-|gowns">baby-gowns</reg>, <lb/>
with its bright blue bows and dainty <lb/>
flummery of ruffles.</p>
<p>"Dah&mdash;now you's fixed." She propped the <lb/>
child in a chair and stood off to inspect it. <lb/>
Straightway her eyes began to widen with <lb/>
astonishment and admiration, and she clapped <lb/>
her hands and cried out, "Why, it do beat <lb/>
all!&mdash;I <hi rend="italic">never</hi> knowed you was so lovely. <lb/>
<figure id="f58" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0049"/>
<pb n="45" entity="DSSR_000002495_0050"/>
Marse Tommy ain't a bit puttier&mdash;not a single <lb/>
bit."</p>
<p>She stepped over and glanced at the other <lb/>
infant; she flung a glance back at her own; <lb/>
then one more at the heir of the house. Now <lb/>
a strange light dawned in her eyes, and in a <lb/>
moment she was lost in thought. She seemed <lb/>
in a trance; when she came out of it she <reg orig="mut-|tered">muttered</reg>, <lb/>
"When I 'uz a-washin' 'em in de tub, <lb/>
yistiddy, his own pappy asked me which of <lb/>
'em was his'n."</p>
<p>She began to move about like one in a <lb/>
dream. She undressed Thomas &agrave; Becket, <lb/>
stripping him of everything, and put the <reg orig="tow-|linen">tow-linen</reg> <lb/>
shirt on him. She put his coral <reg orig="neck-|lace">necklace</reg> <lb/>
on her own child's neck. Then she <lb/>
placed the children side by side, and after <lb/>
earnest inspection she muttered&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f59" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0050"/>
<p>"Now who would b'lieve clo'es could do de <lb/>
like o' dat? Dog my cats if it ain't all <hi rend="italic">I</hi> kin <lb/>
do to tell t' other fum which, let alone his <lb/>

<p>She put her cub in Tommy's elegant <reg orig="cra-|dle">cradle</reg> <lb/>
and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"You's young Marse <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> fum dis out, en <lb/>

I got to practise and git used to 'memberin' <lb/>

Dah&mdash;now you lay still en don't fret no <lb/>

heaven, you's saved, you's saved!&mdash;dey ain't <lb/>
no man kin ever sell mammy's po' little <lb/>
honey down de river now!"</p>
<p>She put the heir of the house in her own <lb/>
child's unpainted pine cradle, and said, con <lb/>
templating its slumbering form uncasily&mdash;</p>
<p>"I's sorry for you, honey; I's sorry, God <lb/>
knows I is,&mdash;but what <hi rend="italic">kin</hi> I do, what <hi rend="italic">could</hi> I <lb/>

some time, en den he'd go down de river, <lb/>
sho', en I could n't, could n't, <hi rend="italic">could n't</hi> stan' it."</p>
<p>She flung herself on her bed and began to <lb/>
think and toss, toss and think. By and by <lb/>
she sat suddenly upright, for a comforting <lb/>
thought had flown through her worried mind&mdash; <lb/></p>
<p>"' T ain't no sin&mdash;<hi rend="italic">white</hi> folks has done it! <lb/>
It ain't no sin, glory to goodness it ain't no <lb/>
sin! <hi rend="italic">Dey's</hi> done it&mdash;yes, en dey was de <lb/>

<figure id="f60" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0051"/>
<pb n="47" entity="DSSR_000002495_0052"/>
<p>She began to muse; she was trying to <lb/>
gather out of her memory the dim particulars <lb/>
of some tale she had heard some time or <lb/>
other. At last she said&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f61" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0052"/>
<p>"Now I's got it; now I' member. It was <lb/>
dat ole nigger preacher dat tole it, de time he <lb/>
come over here fum Illinois en preached in <lb/>
de nigger church. He said dey ain't nobody <lb/>
kin save his own self&mdash;can't do it by faith, <lb/>
can't do it by works, can't do it no way at all. <lb/>
Free grace is de <hi rend="italic">on'y</hi> way, en dat don't come <lb/>

He s'lect out anybody dat suit him, en put <lb/>
another one in his place, en make de fust one <lb/>
happy forever en leave t' other one to burn wid <lb/>
Satan. De preacher said it was jist like dey <lb/>
done in Englan' one time, long time ago. De <lb/>
queen she lef' her baby layin' aroun' one day, <lb/>
en went out callin'; en one o' de niggers <reg orig="roun'-|'bout">roun''bout</reg> <lb/>

en tuck en toted de queen's chile home to de <lb/>
nigger-quarter, en nobody ever foun' it out, <lb/>
en her chile was de king bimeby, en sole de <lb/>
queen's chile down de river one time when <lb/>
dey had to settle up de estate. Dah, now&mdash; <lb/>
de preacher said it his own self, en it ain't no <lb/>

&mdash;yes, <hi rend="italic">dey</hi> done it; en not on'y jis' common <lb/>
white folks nuther, but de biggest quality dey <lb/>
is in de whole bilin'. Oh, I 's <hi rend="italic">so</hi> glad I <lb/>
'member'bout dat!"</p>
<p>She got up light-hearted and happy, and <lb/>
went to the cradles and spent what was left <lb/>
of the night "practising." She would give <lb/>
her own child a light pat and say humbly, <lb/>
"Lay still, Marse Tom," then give the real <lb/>
Tom a pat and say with severity, " Lay <hi rend="italic">still,</hi> <lb/>
Chambers!&mdash;does you want me to take <lb/>
somep'n' <hi rend="italic">to</hi> you?"</p>
<figure id="f63" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0053"/>
<p>As she progressed with her practice, she <lb/>
was surprised to see how steadily and surely <lb/>
the awe which had kept her tongue reverent <lb/>
and her manner humble toward her young <lb/>
master was transferring itself to her speech <lb/>
<figure id="f64" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0053"/>
<pb n="49" entity="DSSR_000002495_0054"/>
and manner toward the usurper, and how <lb/>
similarly handy she was becoming in <reg orig="trans-|ferring">transferring</reg> <lb/>
her motherly curtness of speech and <lb/>
peremptoriness of manner to the unlucky heir <lb/>
of the ancient house of Driscoll.</p>
<figure id="f65" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0054"/>
<p>She took occasional rests from practising, <lb/>
and absorbed herself in calculating her chances. <lb/></p>
<p>"Dey'll sell dese niggers to-day fo' stealin' <lb/>

<p>The new negroes gave Roxy no trouble, of <lb/>
course. The master gave her none, for one <lb/>
of his speculations was in jeopardy, and his <lb/>
mind was so occupied that he hardly saw the <lb/>
children when he looked at them, and all Roxy <lb/>
had to do was to get them both into a gale of <lb/>
laughter when he came about; then their <lb/>
faces were mainly cavities exposing gums, and <lb/>
he was gone again before the spasm passed <lb/>
and the little creatures resumed a human <lb/>
aspect.</p>
<figure id="f68" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0055"/>
<p>Within a few days the fate of the <reg orig="specu-|lation">speculation</reg> <lb/>
became so dubious that Mr. Percy <lb/>
went away with his brother the Judge, to <lb/>
see what could be done with it. It was a <lb/>
land speculation as usual, and it had gotten <lb/>
complicated with a lawsuit. The men were <lb/>
gone seven weeks. Before they got back <lb/>
Roxy had paid her visit to Wilson, and was <lb/>
satisfied. Wilson took the finger-prints, <lb/>
<figure id="f69" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0055"/>
<pb n="51" entity="DSSR_000002495_0056"/>
labeled them with the names and with the <lb/>
date&mdash;October the first&mdash;put them carefully <lb/>
away and continued his chat with Roxy, <lb/>
who seemed very anxious that he should <reg orig="ad-|mire">admire</reg> <lb/>
the great advance in flesh and beauty <lb/>
which the babies had made since he took their <lb/>
finger-prints a month before. He <reg orig="compli-|mented">complimented</reg> <lb/>

and as they were without any <reg orig="dis-|guise">disguise</reg> <lb/>

<p>But he did n't. He discovered nothing; <lb/>
and she went home jubilant, and dropped all <lb/>
concern about the matter permanently out of <lb/>
her mind.</p>

Becket" &mdash;shortening this latter name to <lb/>

<p>"Tom" was a bad baby, from the very <lb/>
beginning of his usurpation. He would cry <lb/>
for nothing; he would burst into storms of <lb/>
devilish temper without notice, and let go <lb/>
<figure id="f71" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0057"/>
<pb n="53" entity="DSSR_000002495_0058"/>
scream after scream and squall after squall, <lb/>
then climax the thing with "holding his <lb/>
breath"&mdash;that frightful specialty of the <reg orig="teeth-|ing">teething</reg> <lb/>
nursling, in the throes of which the <reg orig="creat-|ure">creature</reg> <lb/>
exhausts its lungs, then is convulsed with <lb/>
noiseless squirmings and twistings and <reg orig="kick-|ings">kickings</reg> <lb/>
in the effort to get its breath, while the <lb/>
lips turn blue and the mouth stands wide and <lb/>
rigid, offering for inspection one wee tooth <lb/>
set in the lower rim of a hoop of red gums; <lb/>
and when the appalling stillness has endured <lb/>
until one is sure the lost breath will never <lb/>
return, a nurse comes flying, and dashes water <lb/>
in the child's face, and&mdash;presto! the lungs fill, <lb/>
and instantly discharge a shriek, or a yell, or <lb/>
a howl which bursts the listening car and <reg orig="sur-|prises">surprises</reg> <lb/>
the owner of it into saying words which <lb/>
would not go well with a halo if he had one. <lb/>
The baby Tom would claw anybody who came <lb/>
within reach of his nails, and pound anybody <lb/>
he could reach with his rattle. He would <lb/>
scream for water until he got it, and then <lb/>
throw cup and all on the floor and scream for <lb/>
more. He was indulged in all his caprices, <lb/>
howsoever troublesome and exasperating they <lb/>
<figure id="f72" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0058"/>
<pb n="54" entity="DSSR_000002495_0059"/>
might be; he was allowed to eat anything he <lb/>
wanted, particularly things that would give <lb/>
him the stomach-ache.</p>
<p>When he got to be old enough to begin to <lb/>
toddle about and say broken words and get <lb/>
an idea of what his hands were for, he was a <lb/>
more consummate pest than ever. Roxy got <lb/>
no rest while he was awake. He would call <lb/>
for anything and everything he saw, simply <lb/>
saying "Awant it!" (want it), which was a <lb/>
command. When it was brought, he said in <lb/>
a frenzy, and motioning it away with his <lb/>
hands, " Don't awnt it! don't awnt it!" and <lb/>
the moment it was gone he set up frantic yells <lb/>
of "Awnt it! awnt it! awnt it!" and Roxy <lb/>
had to give wings to her heels to get that <lb/>
thing back to him again before he could get <lb/>
time to carry out his intention of going into <lb/>
convulsions about it.</p>
<figure id="f73" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0059"/>
<p>What he preferred above all other things <lb/>
was the tongs. This was because his "father" <lb/>
had forbidden him to have them lest he break <lb/>
windows and furniture with them. The <lb/>
moment Roxy's back was turned he would <lb/>
toddle to the presence of the tongs and say <lb/>
<figure id="f74" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0059"/>
<pb n="55" entity="DSSR_000002495_0060"/>
"Like it!" and cock his eye to one side to <lb/>
see if Roxy was observing; then, "Awnt it!" <lb/>
and cock his eye again; then, "Hab it!" <lb/>
with another furtive glance; and finally, <lb/>
"Take it!"&mdash;and the prize was his. The <lb/>
next moment the heavy implement was raised <lb/>
aloft; the next, there was a crash and a <lb/>
squall, and the cat was off on three legs to <lb/>
meet an engagement; Roxy would arrive just <lb/>
as the lamp or a window went to irremediable <lb/>
smash.</p>
<p>Tom got all the petting, Chambers got <lb/>
none. Tom got all the delicacies, Chambers <lb/>
got mush and milk, and clabber without <lb/>
sugar. In consequence Tom was a sickly <lb/>
child and Chambers was n't. Tom was "<reg orig="frac-|tious">fractious</reg>," <lb/>
as Roxy called it, and overbearing; <lb/>
Chambers was meek and docile.</p>
<figure id="f75" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0060"/>
<p>With all her splendid common sense and <lb/>
practical every-day ability, Roxy was a <reg orig="dot-|ing">doting</reg> <lb/>
fool of a mother. She was this toward <lb/>
her child&mdash;and she was also more than this: <lb/>
by the fiction created by herself, he was <reg orig="be-|come">become</reg> <lb/>
her master; the necessity of <reg orig="recogniz-|ing">recognizing</reg> <lb/>
this relation outwardly and of perfecting <lb/>
<figure id="f76" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0060"/>
<pb n="56" entity="DSSR_000002495_0061"/>
herself in the forms required to express the <lb/>
recognition, had moved her to such diligence <lb/>
and faithfulness in practicing these forms that <lb/>
this exercise soon concreted itself into habit; <lb/>
it became automatic and unconscious; then a <lb/>
natural result followed: deceptions intended <lb/>
solely for others gradually grew practically <lb/>
into self-deceptions as well; the mock <reg orig="rever-|ence">reverence</reg> <lb/>
became real reverence, the mock <reg orig="obse-|quiousness">obsequiousness</reg> <lb/>
real obsequiousness, the mock <lb/>
homage real homage; the little counterfeit rift <lb/>
of separation between imitation-slave and <lb/>
imitation-master widened and widened, and <lb/>
became an abyss, and a very real one&mdash;and <lb/>
on one side of it stood Roxy, the dupe of her <lb/>
own deceptions, and on the other stood her <lb/>
child, no longer a usurper to her, but her <lb/>
accepted and recognized master. He was her <lb/>
darling, her master, and her deity all in one, <lb/>
and in her worship of him she forgot who she <lb/>
was and what he had been.</p>
<p>In babyhood Tom cuffed and banged and <lb/>
scratched Chambers unrebuked, and <reg orig="Cham-|bers">Chambers</reg> <lb/>
early learned that between meekly <reg orig="bear-|ing">bearing</reg> <lb/>
it and resenting it, the advantage all lay <lb/>
<figure id="f77" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0061"/>
<pb n="57" entity="DSSR_000002495_0062"/>
with the former policy. The few times that <lb/>
his persecutions had moved him beyond <reg orig="con-|trol">control</reg> <lb/>
and made him fight back had cost him <lb/>
very dear at headquarters; not at the hands <lb/>
of Roxy, for if she ever went beyond scolding <lb/>
him sharply for "forgitt'n' who his young <lb/>
marster was," she at least never extended her <lb/>
punishment beyond a box on the ear. No, <lb/>
Percy Driscoll was the person. He told <lb/>
Chambers that under no provocation <reg orig="what-|ever">whatever</reg> <lb/>
was he privileged to lift his hand against <lb/>
his little master. Chambers overstepped the <lb/>
line three times, and got three such <reg orig="convinc-|ing">convincing</reg> <lb/>
canings from the man who was his father <lb/>
and did n't know it, that he took Tom's <reg orig="cruel-|ties">cruelties</reg> <lb/>
in all humility after that, and made no <lb/>
more experiments.</p>
<p>Outside of the house the two boys were <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg> <lb/>
all through their boyhood. Chambers <lb/>
was strong beyond his years, and a good <lb/>
fighter; strong because he was coarsely fed <lb/>
and hard worked about the house, and a good <lb/>
fighter because Tom furnished him plenty of <lb/>
practice&mdash;on white boys whom he hated and <lb/>
was afraid of. Chambers was his constant <lb/>
<figure id="f78" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0062"/>
<pb n="58" entity="DSSR_000002495_0063"/>
body-guard, to and from school; he was <reg orig="pres-|ent">present</reg> <lb/>
on the playground at recess to protect his <lb/>
charge. He fought himself into such a <reg orig="for-|midable">formidable</reg> <lb/>
reputation, by and by, that Tom could <lb/>
have changed clothes with him, and "ridden <lb/>
in peace," like Sir Kay in Launcelot's armor.</p>
<figure id="f79" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0063"/>
<p>He was good at games of skill, too. Tom <lb/>
staked him with marbles to play "keeps" <lb/>
with, and then took all the winnings away <lb/>
from him. In the winter season Chambers <lb/>
was on hand, in Tom's worn-out clothes, with <lb/>
"holy" red mittens, and "holy" shoes, and <lb/>
pants "holy" at the knees and seat, to drag <lb/>
a sled up the hill for Tom, warmly clad, to <lb/>
ride down on; but he never got a ride <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>. <lb/>
He built snow men and snow <reg orig="fortifica-|tions">fortifications</reg> <lb/>
under Tom's directions. He was Tom's <lb/>
patient target when Tom wanted to do some <lb/>
snowballing, but the target could n't fire back. <lb/>
Chambers carried Tom's skates to the river <lb/>
and strapped them on him, then trotted around <lb/>
after him on the ice, so as to be on hand <lb/>
when wanted; but he was n't ever asked to try <lb/>
the skates himself.</p>
<p>In summer the pet pastime of the boys of <lb/>

Dawson's Landing was to steal apples, <lb/>
peaches, and melons from the farmers' <reg orig="fruit-|wagons,&mdash;mainly">fruitwagons,&mdash;mainly</reg> <lb/>
on account of the risk they <lb/>
ran of getting their heads laid open with the <lb/>
butt of the farmer's whip. Tom was a <reg orig="distin-|guished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
adept at these thefts&mdash;by proxy. <lb/>
Chambers did his stealing, and got the <reg orig="peach-|stones">peach-stones</reg>, <lb/>
apple-cores, and melon-rinds for his <lb/>
share.</p>
<p>Tom always made Chambers go in <reg orig="swim-|ming">swimming</reg> <lb/>
with him, and stay by him as a <reg orig="protec-|tion">protection</reg>. <lb/>
When Tom had had enough, he would <lb/>
slip out and tie knots in Chambers's shirt, dip <lb/>
the knots in the water to make them hard to <lb/>
undo, then dress himself and sit by and laugh <lb/>
while the naked shiverer tugged at the <reg orig="stub-|born">stubborn</reg> <lb/>
knots with his teeth.</p>
<p>Tom did his humble comrade these various <lb/>
ill turns partly out of native viciousness, and <lb/>
partly because he hated him for his <reg orig="superiori-|ties">superiorities</reg> <lb/>
of physique and pluck, and for his <reg orig="mani-|fold">manifold</reg> <lb/>
clevernesses. Tom could n't dive, for it <lb/>
gave him splitting headaches. Chambers <lb/>
could dive without inconvenience, and was <lb/>
fond of doing it. He excited so much <reg orig="admir-|ation">admiration</reg>, <lb/>
<figure id="f81" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0064"/>
<pb n="60" entity="DSSR_000002495_0065"/>
one day, among a crowd of white boys, <lb/>
by throwing back somersaults from the stern <lb/>
of a canoe, that it wearied Tom's spirit, and at <lb/>
last he shoved the canoe underneath <reg orig="Cham-|bers">Chambers</reg> <lb/>
while he was in the air&mdash;so he came <lb/>
down on his head in the canoe-bottom; and <lb/>
while he lay unconscious, several of Tom's <lb/>
ancient adversaries saw that their long-desired <lb/>
opportunity was come, and they gave the <lb/>
false heir such a drubbing that with <reg orig="Cham-|bers's">Chambers's</reg> <lb/>
best help he was hardly able to drag <lb/>
himself home afterward.</p>
<figure id="f82" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0065"/>
<p>When the boys were fifteen and upward, <lb/>
Tom was "showing off" in the river one day, <lb/>
when he was taken with a cramp, and shouted <lb/>
for help. It was a common trick with the <lb/>
boys&mdash;particularly if a stranger was present&mdash; <lb/>
to pretend a cramp and howl for help; then <lb/>
when the stranger came tearing hand over hand <lb/>
to the rescue, the howler would go on <reg orig="strug-|gling">struggling</reg> <lb/>
and howling till he was close at hand, <lb/>
then replace the howl with a sarcastic smile <lb/>
and swim blandly away, while the town boys <lb/>
assailed the dupe with a volley of jeers and <lb/>
laughter. Tom had never tried this joke as <lb/>
<figure id="f83" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0065"/>
<pb n="61" entity="DSSR_000002495_0066"/>
yet, but was supposed to be trying it now, so <lb/>
the boys held warily back; but Chambers <reg orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg> <lb/>
his master was in earnest, therefore he <lb/>
swam out, and arrived in time, unfortunately, <lb/>
and saved his life.</p>
<p>This was the last feather. Tom had <reg orig="man-|aged">managed</reg> <lb/>
to endure everything else, but to have <lb/>
to remain publicly and permanently under <lb/>
such an obligation as this to a nigger, and to <lb/>
this nigger of all niggers&mdash;this was too much. <lb/>
He heared insults upon Chambers for "<reg orig="pre-|tending">pretending</reg> <lb/>
to think he was in earnest in calling <lb/>
for help, and said that anybody but a <reg orig="block-|headed">block-headed</reg> <lb/>
nigger would have known he was <lb/>
funning and left him alone.</p>
<p>Tom's enemies were in strong force here, so <lb/>
they came out with their opinions quite freely. <lb/>
They laughed at him, and called him coward, <lb/>
liar, sneak, and other sorts of pet names, and <lb/>
told him they meant to call Chambers by a <lb/>
new name after this, and make it common in <lb/>
the town&mdash;"Tom Driscoll's niggerpappy,"&mdash; <lb/>
to signify that he had had a second birth into <lb/>
this life, and that Chambers was the author of <lb/>
his new being. Tom grew frantic under these <lb/>
taunts, and shouted&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f84" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0066"/>
<pb n="62" entity="DSSR_000002495_0067"/>
<p>"Knock their heads off, Chambers! knock <lb/>
their heads off! What do you stand there <lb/>
with your hands in your pockets for?"</p>
<p>Chambers expostulated, and said, "But, <lb/>
Marse Tom, dey's too many of 'em&mdash;dey's&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Do you hear me?"</p>
<p>"Please, Marse Tom, don't make me! <lb/>
Dey's so many of 'em dat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>Tom sprang at him and drove his <reg orig="pocket-|knife">pocketknife</reg> <lb/>
into him two or three times before the <lb/>
boys could snatch him away and give the <lb/>
wounded lad a chance to escape. He was <lb/>
considerably hurt, but not seriously. If the <lb/>
blade had been a little longer his career would <lb/>
have ended there.</p>
<figure id="f85" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0067"/>
<p>Tom had long ago taught Roxy "her <lb/>
place." It had been many a day now since <lb/>
she had ventured a caress or a fondling <lb/>
epithet in his quarter. Such things, from a <lb/>
"nigger," were repulsive to him, and she had <lb/>
been warned to keep her distance and <reg orig="remem-|ber">remember</reg> <lb/>
who she was. She saw her darling <reg orig="gradu-|ally">gradually</reg> <lb/>
cease from being her son, she saw <hi rend="italic">that</hi> <reg orig="de-|tail">detail</reg> <lb/>
perish utterly; all that was left was <reg orig="mas-|ter&mdash;master">master&mdash;master</reg>, <lb/>
pure and simple, and it was not a <lb/>
<figure id="f86" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0067"/>
<pb n="63" entity="DSSR_000002495_0068"/>
gentle mastership, either. She saw herself <lb/>
sink from the sublime height of motherhood <lb/>
to the somber depths of unmodified slavery. <lb/>
The abyss of separation between her and her <lb/>
boy was complete. She was merely his chattel, <lb/>
now, his convenience, his dog, his cringing <lb/>
and helpless slave, the humble and unresisting <lb/>
victim of his capricious temper and vicious <lb/>
nature.</p>
<p>Sometimes she could not go to sleep, even <lb/>
when worn out with fatigue, because her rage <lb/>
boiled so high over the day's experiences with <lb/>
her boy. She would mumble and mutter to <lb/>
herself&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f87" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0068"/>
<p>"He struck me, en I war n't no way to <lb/>
blame&mdash;struck me in de face, right before <lb/>
folks. En he's al'ays callin' me nigger-wench, <lb/>
en hussy, en all dem mean names, when I 's <lb/>
doin' de very bes' I kin. Oh, Lord, I done so <lb/>
much for him&mdash;I lift' him away up to what he <lb/>
is&mdash;en dis is what I git for it."</p>
<p>Sometimes when some outrage of peculiar <lb/>
offensiveness stung her to the heart, she <lb/>
would plan schemes of vengeance and revel <lb/>
in the fancied spectacle of his exposure to the <lb/>
<figure id="f88" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0068"/>
<pb n="64" entity="DSSR_000002495_0069"/>
world as an impostor and a slave; but in the <lb/>
midst of these joys fear would strike her: she <lb/>
had made him too strong; she could prove <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg>, <lb/>
and&mdash;heavens, she might get sold down <lb/>
the river for her pains! So her schemes <reg orig="al-|ways">always</reg> <lb/>
went for nothing, and she laid them aside <lb/>
in impotent rage against the fates, and against <lb/>
herself for playing the fool on that fatal <reg orig="Sep-|tember">September</reg> <lb/>
day in not providing herself with a <lb/>
witness for use in the day when such a thing <lb/>
might be needed for the appeasing of her <reg orig="ven-|geance-hungry">vengeance-hungry</reg> <lb/>
heart.</p>
<p>And yet the moment Tom happened to be <lb/>
good to her, and kind,&mdash;and this occurred <lb/>
every now and then,&mdash;all her sore places were <lb/>
healed, and she was happy; happy and proud, <lb/>
for this was her son, her nigger son, lording it <lb/>
among the whites and securely avenging their <lb/>
crimes against her race.</p>
<p>There were two grand funerals in Dawson's <lb/>
Landing that fall&mdash;the fall of 1845. One was <lb/>
that of Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex, the <lb/>
other that of Percy Driscoll.</p>
<p>On his death-bed Driscoll set Roxy free <lb/>
and delivered his idolized ostensible son <reg orig="sol-|emnly">solemnly</reg> <lb/>
<figure id="f89" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0069"/>
<pb n="65" entity="DSSR_000002495_0070"/>
into the keeping of his brother, the <lb/>
Judge and his wife. Those childless people <lb/>
were glad to get him. Childless people are <lb/>
not difficult to please.</p>
<p>Judge Driscoll had gone privately to his <lb/>
brother, a month before, and bought <reg orig="Cham-|bers">Chambers</reg>. <lb/>
He had heard that Tom had been <reg orig="try-|ing">trying</reg> <lb/>
to get his father to sell the boy down the <lb/>
river, and he wanted to prevent the scandal&mdash; <lb/>
for public sentiment did not approve of that <lb/>
way of treating family servants for light cause <lb/>
or for no cause.</p>
<p>Percy Driscoll had worn himself out in <reg orig="try-|ing">trying</reg> <lb/>
to save his great speculative landed estate, <lb/>
and had died without succeeding. He was <lb/>
hardly in his grave before the boom collapsed <lb/>
and left his hitherto envied young devil of an <lb/>
heir a pauper. But that was nothing; his <lb/>
uncle told him he should be his heir and have <lb/>
all his fortune when he died; so Tom was <lb/>
comforted.</p>
<p>Roxy had no home, now; so she resolved <lb/>
to go around and say good-by to her friends <lb/>
and then clear out and see the world&mdash;that is <lb/>
to say, she would go chambermaiding on a <lb/>

<pb n="66" entity="DSSR_000002495_0071"/>
steamboat, the darling ambition of her race <lb/>
and sex.</p>
<p>Her last call was on the black gaint, Jasper. <lb/>
She found him chopping Pudd'nhead Wilson's <lb/>
winter Provision of wood.</p>
<p>Wilson was chatting with him when Roxy <reg orig="ar-|rived">arrived</reg>. <lb/>
He asked her how she could bear to go <lb/>
off chambermaiding and leave her boys; and <lb/>
chaffingly offered to copy off a series of their <lb/>
finger-Prints, reaching up to their twelfth year, <lb/>
for her to remember them by; but she sobered <lb/>
in a moment, , wondering if he suspected <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg>; <lb/>
then she said she believed she did n't <lb/>
want them. Wilson said to himself, "The <lb/>
drop of black blood in her is superstious; <lb/>
she thinks there's some devilry, some <reg orig="witch-|business">witch-business</reg> <lb/>
about my glass mystery somewhere; <lb/>
she used to come here with an old horseshoe <lb/>
in her hand; it could have been an accident, <lb/>
but I doubt it."</p>

nevertheless; then she died, and her husband <lb/>
and his childless sister, Mrs. Pratt, continued <lb/>
the bliss-business at the old stand. Tom was <lb/>
petted and indulged and spoiled to his entire <lb/>

was nineteen, then he was sent to Yale. He <lb/>
went handsomely equipped with "conditions," <lb/>
but otherwise he was not an object of <reg orig="distinc-|tion">distinction</reg> <lb/>
there. He remained at Yale two years, <lb/>
and then threw up the struggle. He came <lb/>

home with his manners a good deal improved; <lb/>
he had lost his surlines and brusqueness, and <lb/>
was rather pleasantly soft and smooth, now; <lb/>
he was furtively, and sometimes openly, <reg orig="iron-|ical">ironical</reg> <lb/>
of speech, and given to gently touching <lb/>
people on the raw, but he did it with a <reg orig="good-|natured">good-natured</reg> <lb/>
semiconscious air that carried it off <lb/>
safely, and kept him from getting into trouble. <lb/>
He was as indolent as ever and showed no <lb/>
very strenuous desire to hunt up an <reg orig="occupa-|tion">occupation</reg>. <lb/>
People argued from this that he <reg orig="pre-|ferred">preferred</reg> <lb/>
to be supported by his uncle until his <lb/>
uncle's shoes should become vacant. He <lb/>
brought back one or two new habits with him, <lb/>
one of which he rather openly <reg orig="practised&mdash;tip-|pling&mdash;but">practised&mdash;tippling&mdash;but</reg> <lb/>
concealed another, which was <reg orig="gam-|bling">gambling</reg>. <lb/>
It would not do to gamble where his <lb/>
uncle could hear of it; he knew that quite well.</p>
<p>Tom's Eastern polish was not popular <lb/>
among the young people. They could have <lb/>
endured it, perhaps, if Tom had stopped there; <lb/>
but he wore gloves, and that they could n't <lb/>
stand, and would n't; so he was mainly <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
society. He brought home with him a <lb/>
suit of clothes of such exquisite style and cut <lb/>
<figure id="f94" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0073"/>
<pb n="69" entity="DSSR_000002495_0074"/>
and fashion,&mdash;Eastern fashion, city fashion,&mdash; <lb/>
that it filled everybody with anguish and was <lb/>
regarded as a peculiarly wanton affront. He <lb/>
enjoyed the feeling which he was exciting, and <lb/>
paraded the town serence and happy all day; <lb/>
but the young fellows set a tailor to work <lb/>
that night, and when Tom started out on his <lb/>
parade next morning he found the old <reg orig="de-|formed">deformed</reg> <lb/>
negro bell-ringer straddling along in <lb/>
his wake tricked out in a flamboyant <reg orig="curtain-|calico">curtain-calico</reg> <lb/>
exaggeration of his finery, and imitating <lb/>
his fancy Eastern graces as well as he could.</p>
<figure id="f95" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0074"/>
<p>Tom surrendered, and after that clothed <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
in the local fashion. But the dull country, <lb/>
town was tiresome to him, since his <reg orig="acquain-|tanceship">acquaintanceship</reg> <lb/>
with livelier regions, and it grew <lb/>
daily more and more so. He began to make <lb/>
little trips to St. Louis for refreshment. <lb/>
There he found companionship to suit him, <lb/>
and pleasures to his taste, along with more <lb/>
freedom, in some particulars, than he could <lb/>
have at home. So, during the next two years <lb/>
his visits to the city grew in frequency and <lb/>
his tarryings there grew steadily longer in <lb/>
duration.</p>
<pb n="70" entity="DSSR_000002495_0075"/>
<p>He was getting into deep waters. He was <lb/>
taking chances, privately, which might get him <lb/>
into trouble some day&mdash;in fact, <hi rend="italic">did.</hi></p>
<p>Judge Driscoll had retired from the bench <lb/>
and from all business activities in 1850, and <lb/>
had now been comfortably idle three years. <lb/>
He was president of the Free-thinkers' Society, <lb/>
and Pudd'nhead Wilson was the other <reg orig="mem-|ber">member</reg>. <lb/>
The society's weekly discussions were <lb/>
now the old lawyer's main interest in life. <lb/>
Pudd'nhead was still toiling in obscurity at <lb/>
the bottom of the ladder, under the blight of <lb/>
that unlucky remark which he had let fall <lb/>
twenty-three years before about the dog.</p>
<p>Judge Driscoll was his friend, and claimed <lb/>
that he had a mind above the average, but <lb/>
that was regarded as one of the Judge's whims, <lb/>
and it failed to modify the public opinion. <lb/>
Or rather, that was one of the reasons why <lb/>
it failed, but there was another and better one. <lb/>
If the Judge had stopped with bare assertion, <lb/>
it would have had a good deal of effect; but <lb/>
he made the mistake of trying to prove his <reg orig="po-|sition">position</reg>. <lb/>
For some years Wilson had been <reg orig="pri-|vately">privately</reg> <lb/>
at work on a whimsical almanac, for <lb/>
<figure id="f96" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0075"/>
<pb n="71" entity="DSSR_000002495_0076"/>
his amusement&mdash;a calendar, with a little dab <lb/>
of ostensible philosophy, usually in ironical <lb/>
form, appended to each date; and the Judge <lb/>
thought that these quips and fancies of <reg orig="Wil-|son's">Wilson's</reg> <lb/>
were neatly turned and cute; so he <reg orig="car-|ried">carried</reg> <lb/>
a handful of them around, one day, and <lb/>
read them to some of the chief citizens. But <lb/>
irony was not for those people; their mental <lb/>
vision was not focussed for it. They read <lb/>
those playful trifles in the solidest earnest, <lb/>
and decided without hesitancy that if there <lb/>
had ever been any doubt that Dave Wilson <lb/>
was a pudd'nhead&mdash;which there had n't&mdash;this <lb/>
revelation removed that doubt for good and <lb/>
all. That is just the way in this world; an <lb/>
enemy can partly ruin a man, but it takes a <lb/>
good-natured injudicious friend to complete <lb/>
the thing and make it perfect. After this <lb/>
the Judge felt tenderer than ever toward <lb/>
Wilson, and surer than ever that his calendar <lb/>
had merit.</p>
<p>Judge Driscoll could be a free-thinker and <lb/>
still hold his place in society because he was <lb/>
the person of most consequence in the <reg orig="com-|munity">community</reg>, <lb/>
and therefore could venture to go <lb/>

<pb n="72" entity="DSSR_000002495_0077"/>
his own way and follow out his own notions. <lb/>
The other member of his pet organization <lb/>
was allowed the like liberty because he was a <lb/>
cipher in the estimation of the public, and <lb/>
nobody attached any importance to what he <lb/>
thought or did. He was liked, he was <reg orig="wel-|come">welcome</reg> <lb/>
enough all around, but he simply did n't <lb/>
count for anything.</p>

<p>The widow Cooper&mdash;affectionately called <lb/>
"aunt Patsy" by everybody&mdash;lived in a <lb/>
snug and comely cottage with her daughter <lb/>
Rowena, who was nineteen, romantic, amiable, <lb/>
and very pretty, but otherwise of no <reg orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg>. <lb/>
Rowena had a couple of young <lb/>
brothers&mdash;also of no consequence.</p>
<p>The widow had a large spare room which <lb/>
she let to a lodger, with board, when she <lb/>

for a year now, to her sorrow. Her income <lb/>
was only sufficient for the family support, <lb/>

village applicant, oh, no!&mdash;this letter was <lb/>
from away off yonder in the dim great world <lb/>
to the North: it was from St. Louis. She sat <lb/>
on her porch gazing out with unseeing eyes <lb/>
upon the shining reaches of the mighty <reg orig="Mis-|sissippi">Mississippi</reg>, <lb/>
her thoughts steeped in her good <lb/>
fortune. Indeed it was specially good <reg orig="for-|tune">fortune</reg>, <lb/>
for she was to have two lodgers instead <lb/>
of one.</p>
<p>She had read the letter to the family, and <lb/>
Rowena had danced away to see to the <reg orig="clean-|ing">cleaning</reg> <lb/>
and airing of the room by the slave woman <lb/>
Nancy, and the boys had rushed abroad in <lb/>
the town to spread the great news, for it was <lb/>
matter of public interest, and the public would <lb/>
wonder and not be pleased if not informed. <lb/>
Presently Rowena returned, all ablush with <lb/>
joyous excitement, and begged for a re-<reg orig="read-|ing">reading</reg> <lb/>

allow us to pay for two, we will not incommode you. We <lb/>
shall be down Thursday.</q></p>
<p>"Italians! How romantic! Just think, ma <lb/>
&mdash;there's never been one in this town, and <lb/>
everybody will be dying to see them, and <lb/>
they're all <hi rend="italic">ours!</hi> Think of that!"</p>
<figure id="f102" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0079"/>
<p>"Yes, I reckon they'll make a grand stir."</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed they will. The whole town <lb/>
will be on its head! Think&mdash;they've been in <lb/>
Europe and everywhere! There's never <lb/>
been a traveler in this town before. Ma, I <lb/>
should n't wonder if they've seen kings!"</p>
<p>"Well, a body can't tell; but they'll make <lb/>
stir enough, without that."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's of course. Luigi&mdash;Angelo. <lb/>
They're lovely names; and so grand and <lb/>
foreign&mdash;not like Jones and Robinson and <lb/>
such. Thursday they are coming, and this is <lb/>
only Tuesday; it's a cruel long time to wait. <lb/>
Here comes Judge Driscoll in at the gate. <lb/>
He's heard about it. I'll go and open the <lb/>
door."</p>
<figure id="f103" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0079"/>
<p>The Judge was full of congratulations and <lb/>
curiosity. The letter was read and discussed. <lb/>
Soon Justice Robinson arrived with more <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="DSSR_000002495_0080"/>
congratulations, and there was a new reading <lb/>
and a new discussion. This was the beginning. <lb/>
Neighbor after neighbor, of both sexes, <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg>, <lb/>
and the procession drifted in and out <lb/>
all day and evening and all Wednesday and <lb/>
Thursday. The letter was read and re-read <lb/>
until it was nearly worn out; everybody <reg orig="ad-|mired">admired</reg> <lb/>
its courtly and gracious tone, and <lb/>
smooth and practised style, everybody was <lb/>
sympathetic and excited, and the Coopers <lb/>
were steeped in happiness all the while.</p>
<figure id="f104" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0080"/>
<p>The boats were very uncertain in low water, <lb/>
in these primitive times. This time the <lb/>
Thursday boat had not arrived at ten at <lb/>
night&mdash;so the people had waited at the <reg orig="land-|ing">landing</reg> <lb/>
all day for nothing; they were driven to <lb/>
their homes by a heavy storm without having <lb/>
had a view of the illustrious foreigners.</p>
<p>Eleven o'clock came; and the Cooper <lb/>
house was the only one in the town that still <lb/>
had lights burning. The rain and thunder <lb/>
were booming yet, and the anxious family <lb/>
were still waiting, still hoping. At last there <lb/>
was a knock at the door and the family <lb/>
jumped to open it. Two negro men entered, <lb/>

<pb n="76" entity="DSSR_000002495_0081"/>
each carrying a trunk, and proceeded up-stairs <lb/>
toward the guest-room. The entered the <lb/>
twins&mdash;the handsomest, the best dressed, the <lb/>
most distinguished-looking pair of young <lb/>
fellows the West had ever seen. One was a <lb/>
little fairer than the other, but otherwise <lb/>
they were exact duplicates.</p>

succeeded. Aunty Patsy called them by <lb/>

She was full of the keenest curiosity <lb/>
about them, and showed it; they responded <lb/>
by talking about themselves, which pleased <lb/>
her greatly. It presently appeared that in <lb/>

and hardship. As the talk wandered along <lb/>

the old lady watched for the right place to <lb/>
drop in a question or two concerning that <reg orig="mat-|ter">matter</reg>, <lb/>
and when she found it she said to the <lb/>
blond twin who was now doing the <reg orig="biog-|raphies">biographies</reg> <lb/>
in his turn while the brunette one <lb/>
rested&mdash;</p>
<p>"If it ain't asking what I ought not to ask, <lb/>
Mr. Angelo, how did you come to be so <lb/>
friendless and in such trouble when you were <lb/>
little? Do you mind telling? But don't if <lb/>
you do."</p>
<p>"Oh, we don't mind it at all, madam; in <lb/>
our case it was merely misfortune, and <reg orig="no-|body's">nobody's</reg> <lb/>
fault. Our parents were well to do, <lb/>
there in Italy, and we were their only child. <lb/>
We were of the old Florentine nobility"&mdash; <lb/>
Rowena's heart gave a great bound, her <lb/>
nostrils expanded, and a fine light played in <lb/>
her eyes&mdash;"and when the war broke out my <lb/>
father was on the losing side and had to fly <lb/>
for his life. His estates were confiscated, <lb/>
his personal property seized, and there we <lb/>
were, in Germany, strangers, friendless, and in <lb/>
fact paupers. My brother and I were ten years <lb/>
old, and well educated for that age, very <reg orig="stu-|dious">studious</reg>, <lb/>
<figure id="f109" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0083"/>
<pb n="79" entity="DSSR_000002495_0084"/>
very fond of our books, and well <lb/>
grounded in the German, French, Spanish, <lb/>
and English languages. Also, we were <reg orig="mar-|velous">marvelous</reg> <lb/>
musical prodigies&mdash;if you will allow <lb/>
me to say it, it being only the truth.</p>
<figure id="f110" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0084"/>
<p>"Our father survived his misfortunes only <lb/>
a month, our mother soon followed him, and <lb/>
we were alone in the world. Our parents <lb/>
could have made themselves comfortable by <lb/>
exhibiting us as a show, and they had many <lb/>
and large offers; but the thought revolted <lb/>
their pride, and they said they would starve <lb/>
and die first. But what they would n't <reg orig="con-|sent">consent</reg> <lb/>
to do we had to do without the formality <lb/>
of consent. We were seized for the debts <lb/>
occasioned by their illness and their funerals, <lb/>
and placed among the attractions of a cheap <lb/>
museum in Berlin to earn the liquidation <lb/>
money. It took us two years to get out of <lb/>
that slavery. We traveled all about Germany <lb/>
receiving no wages, and not even our keep. <lb/>
We had to be exhibited for nothing, and beg <lb/>
our bread.</p>
<figure id="f111" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0084"/>
<p>"Well, madam, the rest is not of much <lb/>
consequence. When we escaped from that <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="DSSR_000002495_0085"/>
slavery at twelve years of age, we were in <lb/>
some respects men. Experience had taught <lb/>
us some valuable things; among others, how <lb/>
to take care of ourselves, how to avoid and <lb/>
defeat sharks and sharpers, and how to conduct <lb/>
our own business for our own profit and <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
other people's help. We traveled <reg orig="every-|where&mdash;years">everywhere&mdash;years</reg> <lb/>
and years&mdash;picking up <reg orig="smatter-|ings">smatterings</reg> <lb/>
of strange tongues, familiarizing ourselves <lb/>
with strange sights and strange customs, <lb/>
accumulating an education of a wide and <lb/>
varied and curious sort. It was a pleasant <lb/>
life. We went to Venice&mdash;to London, Paris, <lb/>
Russia, India, China, Japan&mdash;"</p>
<p>At this point Nancy the slave woman <lb/>
thrust her head in at the door and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Ole Missus, de house is plum' jam full o' <lb/>
people, en dey's jes a-spi'lin' to see de <reg orig="gen'l-|men">gen'lmen</reg>!" <lb/>
She indicated the twins with a nod of <lb/>
her head, and tucked it back out of sight <lb/>
again.</p>
<figure id="f112" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0085"/>
<p>It was a proud occasion for the widow, and <lb/>
she promised herself high satisfaction in <reg orig="show-|ing">showing</reg> <lb/>
off her fine foreign birds before her <reg orig="neight-|bors">neightbors</reg> <lb/>
and friends&mdash;simple folk who had hardly <lb/>

ever seen a foreigner of any kind, and never <lb/>
one of any distinction or style. Yet her <lb/>
feeling was moderate indeed when contrasted <lb/>
with Rowena's. Rowena was in the clouds, <lb/>
she walked on air; this was to be the greatest <lb/>
day, the most romantic episode, in the <reg orig="col-|orless">colorless</reg> <lb/>
history of that dull country town. She <lb/>
was to be familiarly near the source of its <lb/>
glory and feel the full flood of it pour over <lb/>
her and about her; the other girls could only <lb/>
gaze and envy, not partake.</p>
<p>The widow was ready, Rowena was ready, <lb/>
so also were the foreigners.</p>
<figure id="f114" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0086"/>
<p>The party moved along the hall, the twins <lb/>
in advance, and entered the open parlor door, <lb/>
whence issued a low hum of conversation. <lb/>
The twins took a position near the door the <lb/>
widow stood at Luigi's side, Rowena stood <lb/>
beside Angelo, and the march-past and the <lb/>
introductions began. The widow was all <lb/>
smiles and contentment. She received the <lb/>
procession and passed it on to Rowena.</p>
<p>"Good mornin', Sister <reg orig='Cooper"&mdash;hand-|shake'>Cooper"&mdash;handshake</reg>.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Brother Higgins&mdash;Count <lb/>
<figure id="f115" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0086"/>
<pb n="82" entity="DSSR_000002495_0087"/>
Luigi Capello, Mr. Higgins"&mdash;hand-shake, <lb/>
followed by a devouring stare and "I'm glad <lb/>
to see ye," on the part of Higgins, and a <reg orig="cour-|teous">courteous</reg> <lb/>
inclination of the head and a pleasant <lb/>
"Most happy!" on the part of Count Luigi.</p>
<figure id="f116" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0087"/>
<p>"Good mornin', Roweny"&mdash;hand-shake.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Mr. Higgins&mdash;present <lb/>
you to Count Angelo Capello." Hand-shake, <lb/>
admiring stare, "Glad to see ye,"&mdash;courteous <lb/>
nod, smily "Most happy!" and Higgins <lb/>
passes on.</p>
<p>None of these visitors was at ease, but, <lb/>
being honest people, they did n't pretend to <lb/>
be. None of them had ever seen a person <lb/>
bearing a title of nobility before, and none <lb/>
had been expecting to see one now, <reg orig="conse-|quently">consequently</reg> <lb/>
the title came upon them as a kind of <lb/>
pile-driving surprise and caught them <reg orig="unpre-|pared">unprepared</reg>. <lb/>
A few tried to rise to the emergency, <lb/>
and got out an awkward "My lord," or <lb/>
"Your lordship," or something of that sort, <lb/>
but the great majority were overwhelmed by <lb/>
the unaccustomed word and its dim and awful <lb/>
associations with gilded courts and stately <lb/>
ceremony and anointed kingship, so they only <lb/>
<figure id="f117" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0087"/>
<pb n="83" entity="DSSR_000002495_0088"/>
fumbled through the hand-shake and passed <lb/>
on, speechless. Now and then, as happens <lb/>
at all receptions everywhere, a more than <lb/>
ordinarily friendly soul blocked the procession <lb/>
and kept it waiting while he inquired how <lb/>
the brothers liked the village, and how long <lb/>
they were going to stay, and if their families <lb/>
were well, and dragged in the weather, and <lb/>
hoped it would get cooler soon, and all that <lb/>
sort of thing, so as to be able to say, when <lb/>
they got home, "I had quite a long talk with <lb/>
them"; but nobody did or said anything of a <lb/>
regrettable kind, and so the great affair went <lb/>
through to the end in a creditable and <reg orig="statis-|factory">statisfactory</reg> <lb/>
fashion.</p>
<p>General conversation followed, and the <lb/>
twins drifted about from group to group, <reg orig="talk-|ing">talking</reg> <lb/>
easily and fluently and winning approval, <lb/>
compelling admiration and achieving favor <lb/>
from all. The widow followed their <reg orig="conquer-|ing">conquering</reg> <lb/>
march with a proud eye, and every now <lb/>
and then Rowena said to herself with deep <lb/>
satisfaction, "And to think they are ours&mdash;all <lb/>
ours!"</p>
<p>There were no idle moments for mother or <lb/>
<figure id="f118" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0088"/>
<pb n="84" entity="DSSR_000002495_0089"/>
daughter. Eager inquiries concerning the <lb/>
twins were pouring into their enchanted ears <lb/>
all the time; each was the constant center of <lb/>
a group of breathless listeners; each <reg orig="recog-|nized">recognized</reg> <lb/>
that she knew now for the first time the <lb/>
real meaning of that great word Glory, and <lb/>
perceived the stupendous value of it, and <lb/>
understood why men in all ages had been <lb/>
willing to throw away meaner happinesses, <lb/>
treasure, life itself, to get a taste of its sublime <lb/>
and supreme joy. Napoleon and all his kind <lb/>
stood accounted for&mdash;and justified.</p>
<p>When Rowena had at last done all her <lb/>
duty by the people in the parlor, she went <lb/>
up-stairs to satisfy the longings of an <reg orig="over-|flow-meeting">overflow-meeting</reg> <lb/>
there, for the parlor was not big <lb/>
enough to hold all the comers. Again she <lb/>
was besieged by cager questioners and again <lb/>
she swam in sunset seas of glory. When the <lb/>
forenoon was nearly gone, she recognized <lb/>
with a pang that this most splendid episode <lb/>
of her life was almost over, that nothing could <lb/>
prolong it, that nothing quite its equal could <lb/>
ever fall to her fortune again. But never <lb/>
mind, it was sufficient unto itself, the grand <lb/>
<figure id="f119" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0089"/>
<pb n="85" entity="DSSR_000002495_0090"/>
occation had moved on an ascending scale <lb/>
from the start, and was a noble and <reg orig="memor-|able">memorable</reg> <lb/>
success. If the twins could but do some <lb/>
crowning act, now, to climax it, something <reg orig="un-|usual">unusual</reg>, <lb/>
something startling, something to <reg orig="con-|centrate">concentrate</reg> <lb/>
upon themselves the company's <lb/>
loftiest admiration, something in the nature of <lb/>
an electric surprise&mdash;</p>
<p>Here a prodigious slam-banging broke out <lb/>
below, and everybody rushed down to sec. <lb/>
It was the twins knocking out a classic <reg orig="four-|handed">four-handed</reg> <lb/>
piece on the piano, in great style. <lb/>
Rowena was satisfied&mdash;satisfied down to the <lb/>
bottom of her heart.</p>
<figure id="f120" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0090"/>
<p>The young strangers were kept long at the <lb/>
piono. The villagers were astonished and <lb/>
enchanted with the magnificence of their <reg orig="per-|formance">performance</reg>, <lb/>
and could not bear to have them <lb/>
stop. All the music that they had ever heard <lb/>
before seemed spiritless prentice-work and <lb/>
barren of grace or charm when compared <lb/>
with these intoxicating floods of melodious <lb/>
sound. They realized that for once in their <lb/>
lives they were hearing masters.</p>

The twins had accepted several invitations <lb/>
while the reception was in progress, and had <lb/>
also volunteered to play some duets at an <lb/>
amateur entertainment for the benefit of a <lb/>
local charity. Society was cager to receive <lb/>

and were paraded down the main street, <lb/>

everybody flocking to the windows and <reg orig="side-|walks">sidewalks</reg> <lb/>
to see.</p>
<p>The Judge showed the strangers the new <lb/>

man lived, and the Freemasons' hall, and the <lb/>
Methodist church, and the Presbyterian <lb/>
church, and where the Baptist church was <reg orig="go-|ing">going</reg> <lb/>
to be when they got some money to build <lb/>
it with, and showed them the town hall and <lb/>
the slaughter-house, and got out the <reg orig="indepen-|dent">independent</reg> <lb/>

put out an imaginary fire; then he let them <lb/>

and poured out an exhaustless stream of <reg orig="en-|thusiasm">enthusiasm</reg> <lb/>
over all these splendors, and seemed <lb/>
very well satisfied with the responses he got, <lb/>
for the twins admired his admiration, and paid <lb/>

could have done better if some fifteen or <reg orig="six-|teen">sixteen</reg> <lb/>
hundred thousand previous experiences <lb/>
of this sort in various countries had not <reg orig="al-|ready">already</reg> <lb/>
rubbed off a considerable part of the <lb/>

<p>The Judge laid himself out hospitably to <lb/>
make them have a good time, and if there <lb/>

was a defect anywhere it was not his fault <lb/>
He told them a good many humorous <reg orig="anec-|dotes">anecdotes</reg>, <lb/>
and always forgot the nub, but they <lb/>
were always able to furnish it, for these yarns <lb/>
were of a pretty early vintage, and they had <lb/>
had many a rejuvenating pull at them before. <lb/>
And he told them all about his several <reg orig="dig-|nities">dignities</reg>, <lb/>
and how he had held this and that and <lb/>
the other place of honor or profit, and had <lb/>
once been to the legislature, and was now <lb/>
president of the Society of Free-thinkers. <lb/>
He said the society had been in existence <lb/>
four years, and already had two members, <lb/>
and was firmly established. He would call <lb/>
for the brothers in the evening if they would <lb/>
like to attend a meeting of it.</p>
<figure id="f124" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0093"/>
<p>Accordingly he called for them, and on the <lb/>
way he told them all about Pudd'nhead <reg orig="Wil-|son">Wilson</reg>, <lb/>
in order that they might get a favorable <lb/>
impression of him in advance and be <reg orig="pre-|pared">prepared</reg> <lb/>
to like him. This scheme succeeded&mdash; <lb/>
the favorable impression was achieved. Later <lb/>
it was confirmed and solidified when Wilson <lb/>
proposed that out of courtesy to the strangers <lb/>
the usual topics be put aside and the hour be <lb/>
<figure id="f125" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0093"/>
<pb n="89" entity="DSSR_000002495_0094"/>
devoted to conversation upon ordinary <reg orig="sub-|jects">subjects</reg> <lb/>
and the cultivation of friendly relations <lb/>
and good-fellowship,&mdash;a proposition which <lb/>
was put to vote and carried.</p>
<p>The hour passed quickly away in lively <lb/>
talk, and when it was ended the lonesome and <lb/>
neglected Wilson was richer by two friends <lb/>
than he had been when it began. He invited <lb/>
the twins to look in at his lodgings, presently, <lb/>
after disposing of an intervening engagement, <lb/>
and they accepted with pleasure.</p>
<figure id="f126" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0094"/>
<p>Toward the middle of the evening they <lb/>
found themselves on the road to his house. <lb/>
Pudd'nhead was at home waiting for them <lb/>
and putting in his time puzzling over a thing <lb/>
which had come under his notice that <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>. <lb/>
The matter was this: He happened to <lb/>
be up very early&mdash;at dawn, in fact; and he <lb/>
crossed the hall which divided his cottage <lb/>
through the center, and entered a room to get <lb/>
something there. The window of the room <lb/>
had no curtains, for that side of the house <lb/>
had long been unoccupied, and through this <lb/>
window he caught sight of something which <lb/>
surprised and interested him. It was a <lb/>
<figure id="f127" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0094"/>
<pb n="90" entity="DSSR_000002495_0095"/>
young woman&mdash;a young woman where <reg orig="prop-|erly">properly</reg> <lb/>
no young woman belonged; for she was <lb/>
in Judge Driscoll's house, and in the bedroom <lb/>
over the Judge's private study or <reg orig="sitting-|room">sitting-room</reg>. <lb/>
This was young Tom Driscoll's <reg orig="bed-|room">bedroom</reg>. <lb/>
He and the Judge, the Judge's <lb/>
widowed sister Mrs. Pratt and three negro <lb/>
servants were the only people who belonged <lb/>
in the house. Who, then, might this young <lb/>
lady be? The two houses were separated by <lb/>
an ordinary yard, with a low fence running <lb/>
back through its middle from the street in <lb/>
front to the lane in the rear. The distance <lb/>
was not great, and Wilson was able to see the <lb/>
girl very well, the window-shades of the room <lb/>
she was in being up, and the window also. <lb/>
The girl had on a neat and trim summer <lb/>
dress, patterned in broad stripes of pink and <lb/>
white, and her bonnet was equipped with a <lb/>
pink veil. She was practising steps, gaits <lb/>
and attitudes, apparently; she was doing the <lb/>
thing gracefully, and was very much absorbed <lb/>
in her work. Who could she be, and how <lb/>
came she to be in young Tom Driscoll's <lb/>
room?</p>
<figure id="f128" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0095"/>
<figure id="f129" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0095"/>
<pb n="91" entity="DSSR_000002495_0096"/>
<p>Wilson had quickly chosen a position from <lb/>
which he could watch the girl without <reg orig="run-|ning">running</reg> <lb/>
much risk of being seen by her, and he <lb/>
remained there hoping she would raise her <lb/>
veil and betray her face. But she <reg orig="dis-|appointed">disappointed</reg> <lb/>
him. After a matter of twenty <lb/>
minutes she disappeared, and although he <lb/>
stayed at his post half an hour longer, she <lb/>
came no more.</p>
<figure id="f130" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0096"/>
<p>Toward noon he dropped in at the Judge's <lb/>
and talked with Mrs. Pratt about the great <lb/>
event of the day, the levee of the <reg orig="dis-|tinguished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>

He asked after her nephew Tom, and she <lb/>
said he was on his way home, and that she <lb/>
was expecting him to arrive a little before <lb/>
night; and added that she and the Judge <lb/>
were gratified to gather from his letters that <lb/>
he was conducting himself very nicely and <lb/>
creditably&mdash;at which Wilson winked to <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
privately. Wilson did not ask if there <lb/>
was a newcomer in the house, but he asked <lb/>
questions that would have brought <reg orig="light-|throwing">light-throwing</reg> <lb/>
answers as to that matter if Mrs. <lb/>
Pratt had had any light to throw; so he went <lb/>

away satisfied that he knew of things that <lb/>
were going on in her house of which she <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
was not aware.</p>
<p>He was now waiting for the twins, and still <lb/>
puzzling over the problem of who that girl <lb/>
might be, and how she happened to be in <lb/>
that young fellow's room at daybreak in the <lb/>
morning.</p>

</argument>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> is necessary now, to hunt up Roxy.</p>
<p>At the time she was set free and went away <lb/>
chambermaiding, she was thirty-five. She got <lb/>
a berth as second chambermaid on a <reg orig="Cincin-|nati">Cincinnati</reg> <lb/>
boat in the New Orleans trade, the <hi rend="italic">Grand</hi> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Mogul</hi>. A couple of trips made her wonted <lb/>
and easy-going at the work, and infatuated <lb/>
her with the stir and adventure and <reg orig="indepen-|dence">independence</reg> <lb/>
of steamboat life. Then she was <reg orig="pro-|moted">promoted</reg> <lb/>
and became head chambermaid. She <lb/>
was a favorite with the officers, and <reg orig="exceed-|ingly">exceedingly</reg> <lb/>
proud of their joking and friendly ways <lb/>
with her.</p>
<figure id="f133" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0098"/>
<pb n="94" entity="DSSR_000002495_0099"/>
<p>During eight years she served three parts <lb/>
of the year on that boat, and the winters on a <lb/>
Vicksburg packet. But now for two months <lb/>
she had had rheumatism in her arms, and was <lb/>
obliged to let the wash-tub alone. So she <reg orig="re-|signed">resigned</reg>. <lb/>
But she was well fixed&mdash;rich, as she <lb/>
would have described it; for she had lived a <lb/>
steady life, and had banked four dollars every <lb/>
month in New Orleans as a provision for her <lb/>
old age. She said in the start that she had "put <lb/>
shoes on one bar' footed nigger to tromple on <lb/>
her with," and that one mistake like that was <lb/>
enough; she would be independent of the <lb/>
human race thenceforth forevermore if hard <lb/>
work and economy could accomplish it. <lb/>
When the boat touched the levee at New <lb/>
Orleans she bade good-by to her comrades on <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Grand Mogul</hi> and moved her kit ashore.</p>
<figure id="f134" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0099"/>
<p>But she was back in an hour. The bank had <lb/>
gone to smash and carried her four hundred <lb/>
dollars with it. She was a pauper, and <reg orig="home-|less">homeless</reg>. <lb/>
Also disabled bodily, at least for the <lb/>
present. The officers were full of sympathy <lb/>
for her in her trouble, and made up a little <lb/>
purse for her. She resolved to go to her <reg orig="birth-|place">birthplace</reg>; <lb/>
<figure id="f135" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0099"/>
<pb n="95" entity="DSSR_000002495_0100"/>
she had friends there among the <reg orig="ne-|groes">negroes</reg>, <lb/>
and the unfortunate always help the <lb/>
unfortunate, she was well aware of that; <lb/>
those lowly comrades of her youth would not <lb/>
let her starve.</p>
<p>She took the little local packet at Cairo, <lb/>
and now she was on the home-stretch. Time <lb/>
had worn away her bitterness against her son, <lb/>
and she was able to think of him with serenity. <lb/>
She put the vile side of him out of her mind, <lb/>
and dwelt only on recollections of his <reg orig="occa-|sional">occasional</reg> <lb/>
acts of kindness to her. She gilded and <lb/>
otherwise decorated these, and made them <lb/>
very pleasant to contemplate. She began to <lb/>
long to see him. She would go and fawn <lb/>
upon him, slave-like&mdash;for this would have to be <lb/>
her attitude, of course&mdash;and maybe she would <lb/>
find that time had modified him, and that he <lb/>
would be glad to see his long-forgotten old <lb/>
nurse and treat her gently. That would be <lb/>
lovely; that would make her forget her woes <lb/>
and her poverty.</p>
<p>Her poverty! That thought inspired her <lb/>
to add another castle to her dream: maybe <lb/>
he would give her a trifle now and then&mdash; <lb/>
<figure id="f136" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0100"/>
<pb n="96" entity="DSSR_000002495_0101"/>
maybe a dollar, once a month, say; any little <lb/>
thing like that would help, oh, ever so much.</p>
<p>By the time she reached Dawson's Landing <lb/>
she was her old self again; her blues were <lb/>
gone, she was in high feather. She would <lb/>
get along, surely; there were many kitchens <lb/>
where the servants would share their meals <lb/>
with her, and also steal sugar and apples and <lb/>
other dainties for her to carry home&mdash;or give <lb/>
her a chance to pilfer them herself, which <lb/>
would answer just as well. And there was <lb/>
the church. She was a more rabid and <reg orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg> <lb/>
Methodist than ever, and her piety was <lb/>
no sham, but was strong and sincere. Yes, <lb/>
with plenty of creature comforts and her old <lb/>
place in the amen-corner in her possession <lb/>
again, she would be perfectly happy and at <lb/>
peace thenceforward to the end.</p>
<figure id="f137" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0101"/>
<p>She went to Judge Driscoll's kitchen first of <lb/>
all. She was received there in great form and <lb/>
with vast enthusiasm. Her wonderful travels, <lb/>
and the strange countries she had seen and the <lb/>
adventures she had had, made her a marvel, and <lb/>
a heroine of romance. The negroes hung <reg orig="en-|chanted">enchanted</reg> <lb/>
upon the great story of her <reg orig="experi-|ences">experiences</reg>, <lb/>
interrupting her all along with eager <lb/>
<figure id="f138" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0101"/>
<pb n="97" entity="DSSR_000002495_0102"/>
questions, with laughter, exclamations of <reg orig="de-|light">delight</reg> <lb/>
and expressions of applause; and she was <lb/>
obliged to confess to herself that if there was <lb/>
anything better in this world than <reg orig="steamboat-|ing">steamboating</reg>, <lb/>
it was the glory to be got by telling about <lb/>
it. The audience loaded her stomach with <lb/>
their dinners, and then stole the pantry bare <lb/>
to load up her basket.</p>
<p>Tom was in St. Louis. The servants said <lb/>
he had spent the best part of his time there <lb/>
during the previous two years. Roxy came <lb/>
every day, and had many talks about the family <lb/>
and its affairs. Once she asked why Tom was <lb/>
away so much. The ostensible "Chambers" <lb/>
said:</p>
<figure id="f139" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0102"/>
<p>"De fac' is, ole marster kin git along <reg orig="bet-|ter">better</reg> <lb/>
when young marster's away den he kin <lb/>
when he's in de town; yes, enne love him <reg orig="bet-|ter">better</reg>, <lb/>
too; so he gives him fifty dollahs a <lb/>
month&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, is dat so? Chambers, you's a-jokin', <lb/>
ain't you?"</p>
<p>"'Clah to goodness I ain't, mammy; Marse <lb/>
Tom tole me so his own self. But nemmine, <lb/>
't ain't enough."</p>
<figure id="f140" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0102"/>
<pb n="98" entity="DSSR_000002495_0103"/>
<p>"My lan', what de reason 't ain't enough?" </p>
<p>"Well, I's gwine to tell you, if you gimme <lb/>
a chanst, mammy. De reason it ain't enough <lb/>
is 'ca'se Marse Tom gambles."</p>
<p>Roxy threw up her hands in astonishment <lb/>
and Chambers went on&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f141" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0103"/>
<p>"Ole marster found it out, 'ca'se he had to <lb/>
pay two hundred dollahs for Marse Tom's <reg orig="gam-|blin">gamblin</reg>' <lb/>
debts, en dat's true, mammy, jes as dead <lb/>
certain as you 's bawn."</p>
<p>"Two&mdash;hund'd&mdash;dollahs! Why, what is you <lb/>
talkin' 'bout? Two&mdash;hund'd&mdash;dollahs. Sakes <lb/>
alive, it 's 'mos' enough to buy a tol'able good <lb/>
second-hand nigger wid. En you ain't <lb/>
lyin', honey?&mdash;you would n't lie to yo'ole <lb/>
mammy?"</p>
<p>"It 's God's own truth, jes as I tell you&mdash; <lb/>
two hund'd dollahs&mdash;I wisht I may never stir <lb/>
outen my tracks if it ain't so. En, oh, my <lb/>
lan', ole Marse was jes a-hoppin'! he was <lb/>
b'ilin' mad, I tell you! He tuck 'n' <reg orig="dissen-|hurrit">dissenhurrit</reg> <lb/>
him."</p>
<p>He licked his chops with relish after that <lb/>
stately word. Roxy struggled with it a <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg>, <lb/>
then gave it up and said&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f142" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0103"/>
<pb n="99" entity="DSSR_000002495_0104"/>
<p>"Dissen<hi rend="italic">whiched</hi> him?"</p>
<p>"Dissenhurrit him."</p>
<p>"What's dat? What do it mean?"</p>
<p>"Means he bu'sted de will."</p>
<p>"Bu's&mdash;ted de will! He would n't <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> <lb/>
treat him so! Take it back, you mis'able <lb/>
imitation nigger dat I bore in sorrow en <reg orig="trib-|bilation">tribbilation</reg>."</p>
<p>Roxy's pet castle&mdash;an occasional dollar from <lb/>
Tom's pocket&mdash;was tumbling to ruin before <lb/>
her eyes. She could not abide such a disaster <lb/>
as that; she could n't endure the thought of <lb/>
it. Her remark amused Chambers:</p>
<figure id="f143" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0104"/>
<p>"Yah-yah-yah! jes listen to dat! If I's <lb/>
imitation, what is you? Bofe of us is <reg orig="imita-|tion">imitation</reg> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">white</hi>&mdash;dat's what we is&mdash;en pow'ful <lb/>

'mount to noth'n as imitation <hi rend="italic">niggers;</hi> en as <lb/>

<p>"Shet up yo' foolin', 'fo' I knock you side <lb/>
de head, en tell me 'bout de will. Tell me <lb/>
't ain't bu'sted&mdash;do, honey, en I 'll never forgit <lb/>
you."</p>
<p>"Well, '<hi rend="italic">tain't</hi>&mdash;'ca'se dey's a new one made, <lb/>
en Marse Tom's all right ag'in. But what is <lb/>
<figure id="f144" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0104"/>
<pb n="100" entity="DSSR_000002495_0105"/>
you in sich a sweat 'bout it for, mammy? <lb/>
'Tain't none o' your business I don't reckon."</p>
<p>"'Tain't none o' my business? Whose <lb/>
business is it den, I 'd like to know? Wuz I <lb/>
his mother tell he was fifteen years old, or <lb/>
wus n't I?&mdash;you answer me dat. En you <lb/>
speck I could see him turned out po' en ornery <lb/>
on de worl' en never care noth 'n' 'bout it? <lb/>
I reckon if you 'd ever be'n a mother yo'self, <lb/>
Valet de Chambers, you would n't talk sich <lb/>
foolishness as dat."</p>
<figure id="f145" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0105"/>
<p>"Well, den, ole Marse forgive him en fixed <lb/>
up de will ag'in&mdash;do dat satisfy you?"</p>
<p>Yes, she was satisfied now, and quite happy <lb/>
and sentimental over it. She kept coming <lb/>
daily, and at last she was told that Tom had <lb/>
come home. She began to tremble with <lb/>
emotion, and straightway sent to beg him to <lb/>
let his "po' ole nigger mammy have jes one <lb/>
sight of him en die for joy."</p>
<p>Tom was stretched at his lazy ease on a <lb/>
sofa when Chambers brought the petition. <lb/>
Time had not modified his ancient detestation <lb/>
of the humble drudge and protector of his <lb/>
boyhood; it was still bitter and <reg orig="uncom-|promising">uncompromising</reg>. <lb/>
<figure id="f146" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0105"/>
<pb n="101" entity="DSSR_000002495_0106"/>
He sat up and bent a severe <lb/>
gaze upon the fair face of the young fellow <lb/>
whose name he was unconsciously using and <lb/>
whose family rights he was enjoying. He <lb/>
maintained the gaze until the victim of it had <lb/>
become satisfactorily pallid with terror, then <lb/>
he said&mdash;</p>
<p>"What does the old rip want with <lb/>
me?"</p>
<figure id="f147" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0106"/>
<p>The petition was meckly repeated.</p>
<p>"Who gave you permission to come and <lb/>
disturb me with the social attentions of <reg orig="nig-|gers">niggers</reg>?"</p>
<p>Tom had risen. The other young man <lb/>
was trembling now, visibly. He saw what <lb/>
was coming, and bent his head sideways, and <lb/>
put up his left arm to shield it. Tom rained <lb/>
cuffs upon the head and its shield, saying no <lb/>
word: the victim received each blow with a <lb/>
beseeching "Please, Marse Tom!&mdash;oh, please, <lb/>
Marse Tom!" Seven blows&mdash;then Tom said, <lb/>
"Face the door&mdash;march!' He followed <reg orig="be-|hind">behind</reg> <lb/>
with one, two, three solid kicks. The <lb/>
last one helped the pure-white slave over the <lb/>
door-still, and he limped away mopping his <lb/>
<figure id="f148" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0106"/>
<pb n="102" entity="DSSR_000002495_0107"/>
eyes with his old ragged sleeve. Tom <lb/>
shouted after him, "Send her in!"</p>
<p>Then he flung himself panting on the sofa <lb/>
again, and rasped out the remark, "He <reg orig="ar-|rived">arrived</reg> <lb/>
just at the right moment; I was full to <lb/>
the brim with bitter thinkings, and nobody to <lb/>
take it out of. How refreshing it was! I <lb/>
feel better."</p>
<figure id="f149" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0107"/>
<p>Tom's mother entered now, closing the <lb/>
door behind her, and approached her son with <lb/>
all the wheelding and supplicating servilities <lb/>
that fear and interest can impart to the words <lb/>
and attitudes of the born slave. She stopped <lb/>
a yard from her boy and made two or three <lb/>
admiring exclamations over his manly stature <lb/>
and general handsomeness, and Tom put an <lb/>
arm under his head and hoisted a leg over <lb/>
the sofa-back in order to look properly <reg orig="in-|different">indifferent</reg>.</p>
<p>"My lan', how you is growed, honey! <lb/>
'Clah to goodness, I would n't a-knowed you, <lb/>
Marse Tom! 'deed I would n't! Look at me <lb/>
good; does you 'member old Roxy?&mdash;does <lb/>
you know yo' old nigger mammy, honey? <lb/>
Well now, I kin lay down en die in peace, <lb/>
'ca'se I 'se seed&mdash;"</p>
<figure id="f150" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0107"/>
<pb n="103" entity="DSSR_000002495_0108"/>
<p>"Cut it short, &mdash;it, cut it short! What <lb/>
is it you want?"</p>
<p>"You heah dat? Jes de same old Marse <lb/>
Tom, al'ays so gay and funnin' wid de ole <lb/>
mammy. I 'uz jes as shore&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Cut it short, I tell you, and get along! <lb/>
What do you want."</p>
<figure id="f151" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0108"/>
<p>This was a bitter disappointment. Roxy had <lb/>
for so many days nourished and fondled and <lb/>
petted her notion that Tom would be glad to <lb/>
see his old nurse, and would make her proud <lb/>
and happy to the marrow with a cordial word <lb/>
or two, that it took two rebuffs to convince <lb/>
her that he was not funning, and that her <lb/>
beautiful dream was a fond and foolish <lb/>
vanity, a shabby and pitiful mistake. She <lb/>
was hurt to the heart, and so ashamed that <lb/>
for a moment she did not quite know what to <lb/>
do or how to act. Then her breast began to <lb/>
heave, the tears came, and in her forlornness <lb/>
she was moved to try that other dream of <lb/>
hers&mdash;an appeal to her boy's charity; and so, <lb/>
upon the impulse, and without reflection, she <lb/>
offered her supplication:</p>
<figure id="f152" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0108"/>
<p>"Oh, Marse Tom, de po' ole mammy is in <lb/>
<figure id="f153" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0108"/>
<pb n="104" entity="DSSR_000002495_0109"/>
sich hard luck dese days; en she 's kinder <lb/>
crippled in de arms en can't work, en if you <lb/>
could gimme a dollah&mdash;on'y jes one little <lb/>
dol&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>Tom was on his feet so suddenly that the <lb/>
supplicant was startled into a jump herself.</p>
<figure id="f154" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0109"/>
<p>"A dollar!&mdash;give you a dollar! I 've a <lb/>
notion to strangle you! Is <hi rend="italic">that</hi> your errand <lb/>
here? Clear out! and be quick about it!"</p>
<p>Roxy backed slowly toward the door. <lb/>
When she was half-way she stopped, and said <lb/>
mournfully:</p>
<p>"Marse Tom I nussed you when you was <lb/>
a little baby, en I raised you all by myself tell <lb/>
you was 'most a young man; en now you is <lb/>
young en rich, en I is po' en gitt'n ole, en I <lb/>
come heah b'lievin' dat you would he'p de ole <lb/>
mammy 'long down de little road dat 's lef' <lb/>
'twix' her en de grave, en&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>Tom relished this tune less than any that <lb/>
had preceded it, for it began to wake up a <lb/>
sort of echo in his conscience; so he <reg orig="in-|terrupted">interrupted</reg> <lb/>
and said with decision, though <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
asperity, that he was not in a situation to <lb/>
help her, and was n't going to do it.</p>
<figure id="f155" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0109"/>
<pb n="105" entity="DSSR_000002495_0110"/>
<p>"Ain't you ever gwine to he'p me, Marse <lb/>
Tom?"</p>
<p>"No! Now go away and don't bother me <lb/>
any more."</p>
<p>Roxy's head was down, in an attitude of <lb/>
humility. But now the fires of her old wrongs <lb/>
flamed up in her breast and began to burn <lb/>
fiercely. She raised her head slowly, till it <lb/>
was well up, and at the same time her great <lb/>
frame unconsciously assumed an erect and <lb/>
masterful attitude, with all the majesty and <lb/>
grace of her vanished youth in it. She raised <lb/>
her finger and punctuated with it:</p>
<figure id="f156" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0110"/>
<p>"You has said de word. You has had yo' <lb/>
chance, en you has trompled it under yo' <lb/>
foot. When you git another one, you 'll git <lb/>
down on yo' knees en <hi rend="italic">beg</hi> for it!"</p>
<p>A cold chill went to Tom's heart, he did n't <lb/>
know why; for he did not reflect that such <lb/>
words, from such an incongruous source, and <lb/>
so solemnly delivered, could not easily fail of <lb/>
that effect. However, he did the natural <lb/>
thing: he replied with bluster and mockery:</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">You 'll</hi> give me a chance&mdash;<hi rend="italic">you</hi>! Perhaps <lb/>
I'd better get down on my knees now! But <lb/>
<figure id="f157" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0110"/>
<pb n="106" entity="DSSR_000002495_0111"/>
in case I don't&mdash;just for argument's sake&mdash; <lb/>
what 's going to happen, pray?"</p>
<p>"Dis is what is gwine to happen. I 's <lb/>
gwine as straight to yo' uncle as I kin walk, <lb/>
en tell him every las' thing I knows 'bout <lb/>
you."</p>
<p>Tom's cheek blenched, and she saw it. <lb/>
Disturbing thoughts began to chase each <lb/>
other through his head. "How can she <lb/>
know? And yet she must have found out&mdash; <lb/>
she looks it. I 've had the will back only <lb/>
three months, and am already deep in dept <lb/>
again, and moving heaven and earth to save <lb/>
myself from exposure and destruction, with a <lb/>
reasonably fair show of getting the thing <lb/>
covered up if I 'm let alone, and now this <lb/>
fiend has gone and found me out somehow or <lb/>
other. I wonder how much she knows? <lb/>
Oh, oh, oh, it 's enough to break a body's <lb/>
heart! But I 've got to humor her&mdash;there's <lb/>
no other way."</p>
<figure id="f158" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0111"/>
<p>Then he worked up a rather sickly sample <lb/>
of a gay laugh and a hollow chipperness of <lb/>
manner, and said:</p>
<p>"Well, well, Roxy dear, old friends like <lb/>
<figure id="f159" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0111"/>
<pb n="107" entity="DSSR_000002495_0112"/>
you and me must n't quarrel. Here 's your <lb/>
dollar&mdash;now tell me what you know."</p>
<p>He held out the wild-cat bill; she stood as <lb/>
she was, and made no movement. It was her <lb/>
turn to scorn persuasive foolery, now, and she <lb/>
did not waste it. She said, with a grim <reg orig="im-|placability">implacability</reg> <lb/>
in voice and manner which made <lb/>
Tom almost realize that even a former slave <lb/>
can remember for ten minutes insults and <reg orig="in-|juries">injuries</reg> <lb/>
returned for compliments and flatteries <lb/>
received, and can also enjoy taking revenge <lb/>
for them when the opportunity offers:</p>
<figure id="f160" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0112"/>
<p>"What does I know? I 'll tell you what I <lb/>
knows. I knows enough to bu'st dat will to <lb/>

<p>Tom was aghast.</p>
<p>"More?" he said. "What do you call <lb/>
more? Where 's there any room for more?"</p>
<p>Roxy laughed a mocking laugh, and said <lb/>
scoffingly, with a toss of her head, and her <lb/>
hands on her hips&mdash;</p>

<p>She swung herself around disdainfully, and <lb/>
started away. Tom was in a panic. He <lb/>
seized her skirts, and implored her to wait. <lb/>
She turned and said, loftily&mdash;</p>
<p>"Look-a-heah, what'uz it I tole you?"</p>
<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;I don't remember anything. <lb/>
What was it you told me?"</p>

<figure id="f162" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0113"/>
<p>Tom was stupefied for a moment. He was <lb/>
panting with excitement. Then he said:</p>
<p>"Oh, Roxy, you would n't require your <lb/>
young master to do such a horrible thing. <lb/>
You can't mean it."</p>
<p>"I 'll let you know mighty quick whether I <lb/>

<p>Tom slumped to his knees and began to <lb/>
beg, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>"You see I 'm begging, and it 's honest <lb/>
begging, too! Now tell me, Roxy, tell me."</p>
<p>The heir of two centuries of unatoned <reg orig="in-|sult">insult</reg> <lb/>
and outrage looked down on him and <lb/>
seemed to drink in deep draughts of <reg orig="satisfac-|tion">satisfaction</reg>. <lb/>
Then she said&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f164" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0114"/>
<p>"Fine nice young white gen'l'man kneelin' <lb/>

<p>Tom did it. He said, humbly&mdash;</p>
<p>"Now, Roxy, don't punish me any more. <lb/>
I deserved what I 've got, but be good and <lb/>
let me off with that. Don't go to uncle. <lb/>
Tell me&mdash;I 'll give you the five dollars."</p>
<p>"Yes, I bet you will; en you won't stop <lb/>

<p>"Is you 'feared o' de ha'nted house?"</p>
<p>"N-no."</p>
<p>"Well, den, you come to de ha'nted house <lb/>

stopped and said, "Gimme de dollah bill!" <lb/>
He gave it to her. She examined it and <lb/>
said, "H'm&mdash;like enough de bank 's bu'sted." <lb/>
She started again, but halted again. "Has <lb/>
you got any whisky?"</p>
<figure id="f166" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0115"/>
<p>"Yes, a little."</p>
<p>"Fetch it!"</p>
<p>He ran to his room overhead and brought <lb/>
down a bottle which was two-thirds full. She <lb/>
tilted it up and took a drink. Her eyes <reg orig="spar-|kled">sparkled</reg> <lb/>
with satisfaction, and she tucked the <reg orig="bot-|tle">bottle</reg> <lb/>
under her shawl, saying, "It 's prime. <lb/>
I 'll take it along."</p>
<p>Tom humbly held the door for her, and she <lb/>
marched out as grim and erect as a grenadier.</p>

</argument>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Tom</hi> flung himself on the sofa, and put his <lb/>
throbbing head in his hands, and rested his <lb/>
elbows on his knees. He rocked himself <lb/>
back and forth and moaned.</p>
<figure id="f168" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0116"/>
<p>"I 've knelt to a nigger wench!" he <reg orig="mut-|tered">muttered</reg>. <lb/>
"I thought I had struck the deepest <lb/>

was nothing to this. . .. Well, there is one <lb/>

<p>But that was a hasty conclusion.</p>
<p>At ten that night he climbed the ladder in <lb/>

the haunted house, pale, weak and wretched. <lb/>
Roxy was standing in the door of one of the <lb/>
rooms, waiting, for she had heard him.</p>
<p>This was a two-story log house which had <lb/>
acquired the reputation a few years before of <lb/>
being haunted, and that was the end of its <reg orig="use-|fulness">usefulness</reg>. <lb/>
Nobody would live in it afterward, <lb/>
or go near it by night, and most people even <lb/>
gave it a wide berth in the daytime. As it <lb/>
had no competition, it was called <hi rend="italic">the</hi> haunted <lb/>
house. It was getting crazy and ruinous, <lb/>
now, from long neglect. It stood three <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
yards beyond Pudd'nhead Wilson's <lb/>
house, with nothing between but vacancy. It <lb/>
was the last house in the town at that end.</p>
<figure id="f170" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0117"/>
<p>Tom followed Roxy into the room. She <lb/>
had a pile of clean straw in the corner for a <lb/>
bed, some cheap but well-kept clothing was <lb/>
hanging on the wall, there was a tin lantern <lb/>
freckling the floor with little spots of light, <lb/>
and there were various soap-and-candle boxes <lb/>
scattered about, which served for chairs. The <lb/>
two sat down. Roxy said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Now den, I 'll tell you straight off, en I 'll <lb/>
begin to k'leck de money later on; I ain't in <lb/>

no hurry. What does you reckon I 's gwine <lb/>
to tell you?"</p>
<p>"Well, you&mdash;you&mdash;oh, Roxy, don't make <lb/>
it too hard for me! Come right out and tell <lb/>

I 'm in on account of dissipation and <reg orig="foolish-|ness">foolishness</reg>."</p>

<p>Tom stared at her, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Why, Roxy, what do you mean?"</p>
<p>She rose, and gloomed above him like a <lb/>
Fate.</p>
<p>"I means dis&mdash;en it's de Lord's truth. <lb/>
You ain't no more kin to ole Marse Driscoll <lb/>

<p>Tom sprang up and seized a billet of wood <lb/>
and raised but his mother only laughed at <lb/>
him and said&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f174" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0119"/>
<p>'Set down, you pup! Does you think you <lb/>

tell you! Now den, you set still en behave <lb/>
yo 'self; en don't you git up ag'in till I tell <lb/>

<p>Tom fretted and chafed awhile in a <reg orig="whirl-|wind">whirlwind</reg> <lb/>
of disorganizing sensations and emotions, <lb/>
and finally said, with something like settled <lb/>
conviction&mdash;</p>
<p>"The whole thing is moonshine; now then, <lb/>
go ahead and do your worst; I 'm done with <lb/>
you."</p>
<p>Roxy made no answer. She took the <reg orig="lan-|tern">lantern</reg> <lb/>
and started toward the door. Tom was <lb/>
in a cold panic in a moment.</p>
<figure id="f176" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0120"/>
<p>"Come back, come back!" he wailed. "I <lb/>
did n't mean it, Roxy; I take it all back, and <lb/>
I 'll never say it again! Please come back, <lb/>
Roxy!"</p>
<p>The woman stood a moment, then she said <lb/>
gravely:</p>
<p>"Dat 's one thing you 's got to stop, Valet <lb/>
de Chambers. You can't call me <hi rend="italic">Roxy,</hi> same <lb/>
as if you was my equal. Chillen don't speak <lb/>
to dey mammies like dat. You 'll call me ma <lb/>
<figure id="f177" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0120"/>
<pb n="116" entity="DSSR_000002495_0121"/>
or mammy, dat's what you 'll call <reg orig="me&mdash;least-|ways">me&mdash;leastways</reg> <lb/>
when dey ain't nobody aroun'. <hi rend="italic">Say</hi> <lb/>
it!"</p>
<p>It cost Tom a struggle, but he got it out.</p>
<p>"Dat 's all right. Don't you ever forgit it <lb/>
ag'in, if you knows what 's good for you. <lb/>
Now den, you has said you would n't ever <lb/>
call it lies en moonshine ag'in. I 'll tell you <lb/>
dis, for a warnin': if you ever does say it <lb/>
ag'in, it 's de <hi rend="italic">las'</hi> time you 'll ever say it to <lb/>
me; I 'll tramp as straight to de Judge as I <lb/>
kin walk, en tell him who you is, en <hi rend="italic">prove</hi> it. <lb/>
Does you b'lieve me when I says dat?"</p>
<figure id="f178" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0121"/>
<p>"Oh," groaned Tom, "I more than believe <lb/>
it; I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> it."</p>
<p>Roxy knew her conquest was complete. <lb/>
She could have proved nothing to anybody, <lb/>
and her threat about the writings was a lie; <lb/>
but she knew the person she was dealing <lb/>
with, and had made both statements without <lb/>
any doubt as to the effect they would produce.</p>
<p>She went and sat down on her candle-box, <lb/>
and the pride and pomp of her victorious <reg orig="atti-|tude">attitude</reg> <lb/>
made it a throne. She said&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f179" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0121"/>
<p>"Now den, Chambers, we's gwine to talk <lb/>
<pb n="117" entity="DSSR_000002495_0122"/>
business, en dey ain't gwine to be no mo' <reg orig="fool-|ishness">foolishness</reg>. <lb/>
In de fust place, you gits fifty <reg orig="dol-|lahs">dollahs</reg> <lb/>
a month; you 's gwine to han' over half <lb/>
of it to yo' ma. Plank it out!"</p>
<p>But Tom had only six dollars in the world. <lb/>
He gave her that, and promised to start fair <lb/>
on next month's pension.</p>
<p>"Chambers, how much is you in debt?"</p>
<p>Tom shuddered, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Nearly three hundred dollars."</p>
<p>"How is you gwine to pay it?"</p>
<p>Tom groaned out&mdash; "Oh, I don't know; <lb/>
don't ask me such awful questions."</p>
<p>But she stuck to her point until she wearied <lb/>
a confession out of him: he had been <reg orig="prowl-|ing">prowling</reg> <lb/>
about in disguise, stealing small valuables <lb/>
from private houses; in fact, had made a good <lb/>
deal of a raid on his fellow-villagers a fortnight <lb/>
before, when he was supposed to be in St. <lb/>
Louis; but he doubted if he had sent away <lb/>
enough stuff to realize the required amount, <lb/>
and was afraid to make a further venture in <lb/>
the present excited state of the town. His <lb/>
mother approved of his conduct, and offered <lb/>
<figure id="f180" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0122"/>
<pb n="118" entity="DSSR_000002495_0123"/>
to help, but this frightened him. He <reg orig="trem-|blingly">tremblingly</reg> <lb/>
ventured to say that if she would retire <lb/>
from the town he should feel better and safer, <lb/>
and could hold his head higher&mdash;and was <reg orig="go-|ing">going</reg> <lb/>
on to make an argument, but she <reg orig="inter-|rupted">interrupted</reg> <lb/>
and surprised him pleasantly by saying <lb/>
she was ready; it did n't make any difference <lb/>
to her where she stayed, so that she got her <lb/>
share of the pension regularly. She said she <lb/>
would not go far, and would call at the <lb/>
haunted house once a month for her money. <lb/>
Then she said&mdash;</p>
<p>"I don't hate you so much now, but I 've <lb/>
hated you a many a year&mdash;and anybody <lb/>
would. Did n't I change you off, en give <lb/>
you a good fambly en a good name, en made <lb/>
you a white gen'l'man en rich, wid store <lb/>
clothes on&mdash;en what did I git for it? You <reg orig="de-|spised">despised</reg> <lb/>
me all de time, en was al'ays sayin' <lb/>
mean hard things to me befo' folks, en <lb/>
would n't ever let me forgit I's a nigger&mdash;en <lb/>
&mdash;en&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>She fell to sobbing, and broke down. Tom <lb/>
said&mdash; "But you know I did n't know you <lb/>
were my mother; and besides&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<figure id="f181" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0123"/>
<pb n="119" entity="DSSR_000002495_0124"/>
<p>"Well, nemmine 'bout dat, now; let it go. <lb/>
I 's gwine to fo'git it." Then she added <lb/>
fiercely, "En don't ever make me remember <lb/>
it ag'in, or you 'll be sorry, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> tell you."</p>
<p>When they were parting, Tom said, in the <lb/>
most persuasive way he could command&mdash;</p>
<p>"Ma, would you mind telling me who was <lb/>
my father?"</p>
<p>He had supposed he was asking an <reg orig="embar-|rassing">embarrassing</reg> <lb/>
question. He was mistaken. Roxy <lb/>
drew herself up with a proud toss of her head, <lb/>
and said&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f182" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0124"/>
<p>"Does I mine tellin' you? No, dat I <lb/>
don't! You ain't got no 'casion to be <lb/>
shame' o' yo' father, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> kin tell you. He wuz <lb/>

stock. Fust famblies, he wuz. Jes as <lb/>
good stock as de Driscolls en de Howards, de <lb/>

prouder air, if possible, and added <reg orig="impres-|sively">impressively</reg>: <lb/>
"Does you 'member Cunnel Cecil <lb/>
Burleigh Essex, dat died de same year yo' <lb/>

turned out en give him de bigges' funeral dis <lb/>

<p>Under the inspiration of her soaring <reg orig="com-|placency">complacency</reg> <lb/>
the departed graces of her earlier <lb/>
days returned to her, and her bearing took to <lb/>
itself a dignity and state that might have <lb/>
passed for queenly if her surroundings had <lb/>
been a little more in keeping with it.</p>
<p>"Dey ain't another nigger in dis town dat 's <lb/>

and his first thought was, "Oh, joy, it was all <lb/>

words, "A nigger! I am a nigger! Oh, I <lb/>

<figure id="f185" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0126"/>
<p>He woke at dawn with one more repetition <lb/>

to think. Sufficiently bitter thinkings <lb/>

after this fashion:</p>
<figure id="f186" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0126"/>
<pb n="122" entity="DSSR_000002495_0127"/>
<p>"Why were niggers <hi rend="italic">and</hi> whites made? <lb/>
What crime did the uncreated first nigger <lb/>
commit that the curse of birth was decreed <lb/>
for him? And why is this awful difference <lb/>
made between white and black? . . . How <lb/>
hard the nigger's fate seems, this morning!&mdash; <lb/>
yet until last night such a thought never <lb/>
entered my head."</p>
<p>He sighed and groaned an hour or more <lb/>
away. Then "Chambers" came humbly in to <lb/>
say that breakfast was nearly ready. "Tom" <lb/>
blushed scarlet to see this aristocratic white <lb/>
youth cringe to him, a nigger, and call him <lb/>
"Young Marster." He said roughly&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f187" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0127"/>
<p>"Get out of my sight!" and when the <lb/>
youth was gone, he muttered, "He has done <lb/>
me no harm, poor wretch, but he is an eyesore <lb/>

and I am a&mdash;oh, I wish I was dead!"</p>

tidal waves, and clouds of volcanic <lb/>

lakes where deserts had been, and deserts where <lb/>
green prairies had smiled before. The <reg orig="tre-|mendous">tremendous</reg> <lb/>
catastrophe which had befallen Tom <lb/>
had changed his moral landscape in much the <lb/>

lifted to ideals, some of his ideals had sunk <lb/>
to the valleys, and lay there with the <reg orig="sack-|cloth">sackcloth</reg> <lb/>
and ashes of pumice-stone and sulphur <lb/>
on their ruined heads.</p>
<p>For days he wandered in lonely places, <lb/>
thinking, thinking, thinking&mdash;trying to get <lb/>
his bearings. It was new work. If he met a <lb/>
friend, he found that the habit of a lifetime <lb/>
had in some mysterious way vanished&mdash;his <lb/>
arm hung limp, instead of involuntarily <reg orig="ex-|tending">extending</reg> <lb/>
the hand for a shake. It was the <lb/>
"nigger" in him asserting its humility, and <lb/>
he blushed and was abashed. And the "<reg orig="nig-|ger">nigger</reg>" <lb/>
in him was surprised when the white <lb/>
friend put out his hand for a shake with him. <lb/>
He found the "nigger" in him involuntarily <lb/>
giving the road, on the sidewalk, to the <lb/>
white rowdy and loafer. When Rowena, <lb/>
the dearest thing his heart knew, the idol <lb/>
of his secret worship, invited him in, the "<reg orig="nig-|ger">nigger</reg>" <lb/>
<figure id="f189" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0128"/>
<pb n="124" entity="DSSR_000002495_0129"/>
in him made an embarrassed excuse and <lb/>
was afraid to enter and sit with the dread <lb/>
white folks on equal terms. The "nigger" <lb/>
in him went shrinking and skulking here and <lb/>
there and yonder, and fancying it saw <reg orig="suspi-|cion">suspicion</reg> <lb/>
and maybe detection in all faces, tones, <lb/>
and gestures. So strange and <reg orig="uncharacteris-|tic">uncharacteristic</reg> <lb/>
was Tom's conduct that people noticed it, <lb/>
and turned to look after him when he passed <lb/>
on; and when he glanced back&mdash;as he could <lb/>
not help doing, in spite of his best resistance <lb/>
&mdash;and caught that puzzled expression in a <lb/>
person's face, it gave him a sick feeling, and <lb/>
he took himself out of view as quickly as he <lb/>
could. He presently came to have a hunted <lb/>
sense and a hunted look, and then he fled <lb/>
away to the hill-tops and the solitudes. He <lb/>
said to himself that the curse of Ham was <lb/>
upon him.</p>
<figure id="f190" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0129"/>
<p>He dreaded his meals; the "nigger" in him <lb/>
was ashamed to sit at the white folks' table, <lb/>
and feared discovery all the time; and once <lb/>
when Judge Driscoll said, "What's the <reg orig="mat-|ter">matter</reg> <lb/>
with you? You look as meek as a <reg orig="nig-|ger">nigger</reg>," <lb/>
he felt as secret murderers are said to feel <lb/>
<figure id="f191" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0129"/>
<pb n="125" entity="DSSR_000002495_0130"/>
when the accuser says, "Thou art the man!" <lb/>
Tom said he was not well, and left the table.</p>
<p>His ostensible "aunt's" solicitudes and <reg orig="en-|dearments">endearments</reg> <lb/>
were become a terror to him, and <lb/>
he avoided them.</p>
<p>And all the time, hatred of his ostensible <lb/>
"uncle" was steadily growing in his heart; <lb/>
for he said to himself, "He is white; and I <lb/>
am his chattel, his property, his goods, and <lb/>
he can sell me, just as he could his dog."</p>
<p>For as much as a week after this, Tom <lb/>
imagined that his character had undergone a <lb/>
pretty radical change. But that was because <lb/>
he did not know himself.</p>
<p>In several ways his opinions were totally <lb/>
changed, and would never go back to what <lb/>
they were before, but the main structure of <lb/>
his character was not changed, and could not <lb/>
be changed. One or two very important <lb/>
features of it were altered, and in time effects <lb/>
would result from this, if opportunity offered <lb/>
&mdash;effects of a quite serious nature, too. <lb/>
Under the influence of a great mental and <lb/>
moral upheaval his character and habits had <lb/>
taken on the appearance of complete change, <lb/>
<figure id="f192" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0130"/>
<pb n="126" entity="DSSR_000002495_0131"/>
but after a while with the subsidence of the <lb/>
storm both began to settle toward their <reg orig="for-|mer">former</reg> <lb/>
places. He dropped gradually back into <lb/>
his old frivolous and easy-going ways and <lb/>
conditions of feeling and manner of speech, <lb/>
and no familiar of his could have detected <lb/>
anything in him that differentiated him from <lb/>
the weak and careless Tom of other days.</p>
<figure id="f193" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0131"/>
<p>The theft-raid which he had made upon the <lb/>
village turned out better than he had ventured <lb/>
to hope. It produced the sum necessary to <lb/>
pay his gaming-debts, and saved him from <reg orig="ex-|posure">exposure</reg> <lb/>
to his uncle and another smashing of <lb/>
the will. He and his mother learned to like <lb/>
each other fairly well. She couldn't love <lb/>
him, as yet, because there "warn't nothing <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">to</hi> him," as she expressed it, but her nature <lb/>
needed something or somebody to rule over, <lb/>
and he was better than nothing. Her strong <lb/>
character and aggressive and commanding <lb/>
ways compelled Tom's admiration in spite of <lb/>
the fact that he got more illustrations of them <lb/>
than he needed for his comfort. However, <lb/>
as a rule her conversation was made up of <lb/>
racy tattle about the privacies of the chief <lb/>
<figure id="f194" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0131"/>
<pb n="127" entity="DSSR_000002495_0132"/>
families of the town (for she went harvesting <lb/>
among their kitchens every time she came to <lb/>
the village), and Tom enjoyed this. It was <lb/>
just in his ling. She always collected her half <lb/>
of his pension punctually, and he was always <lb/>
at the haunted house to have a chat with her <lb/>
on these occasions. Every now and then she <lb/>
paid him a visit there on between-days also.</p>
<p>Occasionally he would run up to St. Louis <lb/>
for a few weeks, and at last temptation caught <lb/>
him again. He won a lot of money, but lost <lb/>
it, and with it a deal more besides, which he <lb/>
promised to raise as soon as possible.</p>
<figure id="f195" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0132"/>
<p>For this purpose he projected a new raid <lb/>
on his town. He never meddled with any <lb/>
other town, for he was afraid to venture into <lb/>
houses whose ins and outs he did not know <lb/>
and the habits of whose households he was <lb/>
not acquainted with. He arrived at the <lb/>
haunted house in disguise on the Wednesday <lb/>
before the advent of the twins&mdash;after writing <lb/>
his aunt Pratt that he would not arrive until <lb/>
two days after&mdash;and lay in hiding there with <lb/>
his mother until toward daylight Friday <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>, <lb/>
when he went to his uncle's house and <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="DSSR_000002495_0133"/>
entered by the back way with his own key, <lb/>
and slipped up to his room, where he could <lb/>
have the use of mirror and toilet articles. He <lb/>
had a suit of girl's clothes with him in a <reg orig="bun-|dle">bundle</reg> <lb/>
as a disguise for his raid, and was wearing <lb/>
a suit of his mother's clothing, with black <lb/>
gloves and veil. By dawn he was tricked out <lb/>
for his raid, but he caught a glimpse of <reg orig="Pudd'n-|head">Pudd'nhead</reg> <lb/>
Wilson through the window over the <lb/>
way, and knew that Pudd'nhead had caught a <lb/>
glimpse of him. So he entertained Wilson <lb/>
with some airs and graces and attitudes for a <lb/>
while, then stepped out of sight and resumed <lb/>
the other disguise, and by and by went down <lb/>
and out the back way and started down town <lb/>
to reconnoiter the scene of his intended labors.</p>
<figure id="f196" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0133"/>
<p>But he was ill at ease. He had changed <lb/>
back to Roxy's dress, with the stoop of age <lb/>
added to the disguise, so that Wilson would <lb/>
not brother himself about a humble old <reg orig="wo-|man">woman</reg> <lb/>
leaving a neighbor's house by the back <lb/>
way in the early morning, in case he was still <lb/>
spying. But supposing Wilson had seen him <lb/>
leave, and had thought it suspicious, and had <lb/>
also followed him? The thought made Tom <lb/>
<figure id="f197" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0133"/>
<pb n="129" entity="DSSR_000002495_0134"/>
cold. He gave up the raid for the day, and <lb/>
hurried back to the haunted house by the <reg orig="ob-|scurest">obscurest</reg> <lb/>
route he knew. His mother was <lb/>
gone; but she came back, by and by, with the <lb/>
news of the grand reception at Patsy Cooper's, <lb/>
and soon persuaded him that the opportunity <lb/>
was like a special providence, it was so <reg orig="invit-|ing">inviting</reg> <lb/>
and perfect. So he went raiding, after <lb/>
all, and made a nice success of it while <reg orig="every-|body">everybody</reg> <lb/>
was gone to Patsy Cooper's. Success <lb/>
gave him nerve and even actual intrepidity; <lb/>
insomuch, indeed, that after he had conveyed <lb/>
his harvest to his mother in a back alley, he <lb/>
went to the reception himself, and added <reg orig="sev-|eral">several</reg> <lb/>
of the valuables of that house to his <reg orig="tak-|ings">takings</reg>.</p>
<figure id="f198" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0134"/>
<p>After this long digression we have how <reg orig="ar-|rived">arrived</reg> <lb/>
once more at the point where <reg orig="Pudd'n-|head">Pudd'nhead</reg> <lb/>
Wilson, while waiting for the arrival of <lb/>
the twins on that same Friday evening, sat <lb/>
puzzling over the strange apparition of that <lb/>
morning&mdash;a girl in young Tom Driscoll's <reg orig="bed-|room">bedroom</reg>; <lb/>
fretting, and guessing, and puzzling <lb/>
over it, and wondering who the shameless <lb/>
creature might be.</p>

It flowed along chattily and sociably, <lb/>
and under its influence the new friendship <lb/>
gathered ease and strength. Wilson got out <lb/>
his Calendar, by request, and read a passage <lb/>
or two from it, which the twins praised quite <lb/>

that he complied gladly when they asked him <lb/>
to lend them a batch of the work to read at <lb/>

home. In the course of their wide travels they <lb/>
had found out that there are three sure ways <lb/>
of pleasing an author; they were now <reg orig="work-|ing">working</reg> <lb/>
the best of the three.</p>
<p>There was an interruption, now. Young <lb/>
Tom Driscoll appeared, and joined the party. <lb/>
He pretended to be seeing the distinguished <lb/>
strangers for the first time when they rose to <lb/>
shake hands; but this was only a blind, as he <lb/>
had already had a glimpse of them, at the <reg orig="re-|ception">reception</reg>, <lb/>
while robbing the house. The twins <lb/>
made mental note that he was smooth-faced <lb/>
and rather handsome, and smooth and <reg orig="undu-|latory">undulatory</reg> <lb/>
in his movements&mdash;graceful, in fact. <lb/>
Angelo thought he had a good eye; Luigi <lb/>
thought there was something veiled and sly <lb/>
about it. Angelo thought he had a pleasant <lb/>
free-and-easy way of talking; Luigi thought <lb/>
it was more so than was agreeable. Angelo <lb/>
thought he was a sufficiently nice young man; <lb/>
Luigi reserved his dicision. Tom's first <reg orig="con-|tribution">contribution</reg> <lb/>
to the conversation was a question <lb/>
which he had put to Wilson a hundred times <lb/>
before. It was always cheerily and good-<reg orig="na-|turedly">naturedly</reg> <lb/>
put, and always inflicted a little pang, <lb/>
<figure id="f203" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0136"/>
<figure id="f204" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0136"/>
<pb n="132" entity="DSSR_000002495_0137"/>
for it touched a secret sore; but this time the <lb/>
pang was sharp, since strangers were present.</p>
<p>"Well, how does the law come on? Had a <lb/>
case yet?"</p>
<p>Wilson bit his lip, but answered, "No&mdash;not <lb/>
yet," with as much indifference as he could <reg orig="as-|sume">assume</reg>. <lb/>
Judge Driscoll had generously left the <lb/>
law feature out of the Wilson biography which <lb/>
he had furnished to the twins. Young Tom <lb/>
laughed pleasantly, and said:</p>
<p>"Wilson's a lawyer, gentlemen, but he <lb/>
does n't practise now."</p>
<p>The sarcasm bit, but Wilson kept himself <lb/>
under control, and said without passion:</p>
<p>"I don't practise, it is true. It is true that <lb/>
I have never had a case, and have had to earn <lb/>
a poor living for twenty years as an expert <reg orig="ac-|countant">accountant</reg> <lb/>
in a town where I can't get hold of <lb/>
a set of books to untangle as often as I should <lb/>
like. But it is also true that I did fit myself <lb/>
well for the practice of the law. By the time <lb/>
I was your age, Tom, I had chosen a <reg orig="profes-|sion">profession</reg>, <lb/>
and was soon competent to enter upon <lb/>
it." Tom winced. "I never got a chance to <lb/>
try my hand at it, and I may never get a <lb/>
<figure id="f205" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0137"/>
<figure id="f206" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0137"/>
<pb n="133" entity="DSSR_000002495_0138"/>
chance; and yet if I ever do get it I shall be <lb/>
found ready, for I have kept up my law-<reg orig="stud-|ies">studies</reg> <lb/>
all these years,"</p>
<p>"That's it; that's good grit! I like to see <lb/>
it. I've a notion to throw all my business <lb/>
your way. My business and your law-practice <lb/>
ought to make a pretty gay team, Dave," and <lb/>
the young fellow laughed again.</p>
<p>"If you will throw&mdash;" Wilson had thought of <lb/>
the girl in Tom's bedroom, and was going to <lb/>
say, "If you will throw the surreptitious and <lb/>
disreputable part of your business my way, it <lb/>
may amount to something;" but thought <lb/>
better of it and said, "However, this matter <lb/>
does n't fit well in a general conversation."</p>
<figure id="f207" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0138"/>
<p>"All right, we 'll change the subject; I <lb/>
guess you were about to give me another dig, <lb/>
anyway, so I 'm willing to change. How 's <lb/>
the Awful Mystery flourishing these days? <lb/>
Wilson's got a scheme for driving plain <reg orig="win-|dow-glass">window-glass</reg> <lb/>
out of the market by decorating it <lb/>
with greasy finger-marks, and getting rich <lb/>
by selling it at famine prices to the crowned <lb/>
heads over in Europe to outfit their palaces <lb/>
with. Fetch it out, Dave."</p>
<figure id="f208" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0138"/>
<pb n="134" entity="DSSR_000002495_0139"/>
<p>Wilson brought three of his glass strips, <lb/>
and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"I get the subject to pass the fingers of his <lb/>
right hand through his hair, so as to get a <reg orig="lit-|tle">little</reg> <lb/>
coating of the natural oil on them, and <lb/>
then press the balls of them on the glass. A <lb/>
fine and delicate print of the lines in the skin <lb/>
results, and is permanent, if it does n't come <lb/>
in contact with someth&iacute;ng able to rub it off. <lb/>
You begin, Tom."</p>
<figure id="f209" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0139"/>
<p>"Why, I think you took my finger-marks <lb/>
once or twice before."</p>
<p>"Yes; but you were a little boy the last <lb/>
time, only about twelve years old."</p>
<p>"That's so. Of course I 've changed <reg orig="en-|tirely">entirely</reg> <lb/>
since then, and variety is what the <lb/>
crowned heads want, I guess."</p>
<figure id="f210" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0139"/>
<p>He passed his fingers through his crop of <lb/>
short hair, and pressed them one at a time on <lb/>
the glass. Angelo made a print of his fingers <lb/>
on another glass, and Luigi followed with the <lb/>
third. Wilson marked the glasses with <lb/>
names and date, and put them away. Tom <lb/>
gave one of his little laughs, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"I thought I would n't say anything, but if <lb/>
<figure id="f211" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0139"/>
<pb n="135" entity="DSSR_000002495_0140"/>
variety is what you are after, you have wasted <lb/>
a piece of glass. The hand-print of one twin is <lb/>
the same as the hand-print of the fellow-twin."</p>
<p>"Well, it's done now, and I like to have <lb/>
them both, anyway," said Wilson, returning <lb/>
to his place.</p>
<figure id="f212" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0140"/>
<p>"But look here, Dave," said Tom, "you <lb/>
used to tell people's fortunes, too, when you <lb/>
took their finger-marks. Dave's just an <reg orig="all-|round">all-round</reg> <lb/>
genius&mdash;a genius of the first water, <lb/>
gentlemen; a great scientist running to seed <lb/>
here in this village, a prophet with the kind <lb/>
of honor that prophets generally get at home <lb/>
&mdash;for here they don't give shucks for his <reg orig="sci-|entifics">scientifics</reg>, <lb/>
and they call his skull a notion-factory <lb/>
&mdash;hey, Dave, ain't it so? But never mind; <lb/>
he'll make his mark some day&mdash;finger-marks, <lb/>
you know, he-he! But really, you want to <lb/>
let him take a shy at your palms once; it's <lb/>
worth twice the price of admission or your <lb/>
money's returned at the door. Why, he'll <lb/>
read your wrinkles as easy as a book, and not <lb/>
only tell you fifty or sixty things that's going <lb/>
to happen to you, but fifty or sixty thousand <lb/>
that ain't. Come, Dave, show the gentlemen <lb/>
<figure id="f213" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0140"/>
<pb n="136" entity="DSSR_000002495_0141"/>
what an inspired Jack-at-all-science we 've got <lb/>
in this town, and don't know it."</p>
<p>Wilson winced under this nagging and not <lb/>
very courteous chaff, and the twins suffered <lb/>
with him and for him. They rightly judged, <lb/>
now, that the best way to relieve him would <lb/>
be to take the thing in earnest and treat it <lb/>
with respect, ignoring Tom's rather overdone <lb/>
raillery; so Luigi said&mdash;</p>
<p>"We have seen something of palmistry in <lb/>
our wanderings, and know very well what <lb/>
astonishing things it can do. If it is n't a <lb/>
science, and one of the greatest of them, too, <lb/>
I don't know what its other name ought to <lb/>
be. In the Orient&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>Tom looked surprised and incredulous. <lb/>
He said&mdash;</p>
<p>"That juggling a science? But really, you <lb/>
ain't serious, are you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, entirely so. Four years ago we had <lb/>
our hands read out to us as if our palms had <lb/>
been covered with print."</p>
<figure id="f214" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0141"/>
<p>"Well, do you mean to say there was <reg orig="act-|ually">actually</reg> <lb/>
anything in it?" asked Tom, his <reg orig="incre-|dulity">incredulity</reg> <lb/>
beginning to weaken a little.</p>
<figure id="f215" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0141"/>
<pb n="137" entity="DSSR_000002495_0142"/>
<p>"There was this much in it," said Angelo: <lb/>
"What was told us of our characters was <reg orig="mi-|nutely">minutely</reg> <lb/>
exact&mdash;we could not have bettered it <lb/>
ourselves. Next, two or three memorable <lb/>
things that had happened to us were laid bare <lb/>
&mdash;things which no one present but ourselves <lb/>
could have known about."</p>
<p>"Why, it 's rank sorcery!" exclaimed Tom, <lb/>
who was now becoming very much interested. <lb/>
"And how did they make out with what was <lb/>
going to happen to you in the future?"</p>
<figure id="f216" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0142"/>
<p>"On the whole, quite fairly," said Luigi. <lb/>
"Two or three of the most striking things <lb/>
foretold have happened since; much the <lb/>
most striking one of all happened within that <lb/>
same year. Some of the minor prophecies <lb/>
have come true; some of the minor and some <lb/>
of the major ones have not been fulfilled yet, <lb/>
and of course may never be: still, I should be <lb/>
more surprised if they failed to arrive than if <lb/>
they did n't."</p>
<p>Tom was entirely sobered, and profoundly <lb/>
impressed. He said, apologetically&mdash;</p>
<p>"Dave, I was n't meaning to belittle that <lb/>
science; I was only chaffing&mdash;chattering, I <lb/>
<figure id="f217" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0142"/>
<pb n="138" entity="DSSR_000002495_0143"/>
reckon I 'd better say. I wish you would <lb/>
look at their palms. Come, won't you?"</p>
<p>"Why, certainly, if you want me to; but <lb/>
you know I 've had no chance to become an <lb/>
expert, and don't claim to be one. When a <lb/>
past event is somewhat prominently recorded <lb/>
in the palm I can generally detect that, but <lb/>
minor ones often escape me,&mdash;not always, of <lb/>
course,but often,&mdash;but I have n't much <reg orig="con-|fidence">confidence</reg> <lb/>
in myself when it comes to reading <lb/>
the future. I am talking as if palmistry was <lb/>
a daily study with me, but that is not so. I <lb/>
have n't examined half a dozen hands in the <lb/>
last half dozen years; you see, the people got <lb/>
to joking about it, and I stopped to let the talk <lb/>
die down. I 'll tell you what we 'll do, Count <lb/>
Luigi: I 'll make a try at your past, and if I <lb/>
have any sucess there&mdash;no, on the whole, <lb/>
I 'll let the future alone; that's really the <lb/>
affair of an expert."</p>
<figure id="f218" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0143"/>
<p>He took Luigi's hand. Tom said&mdash; <lb/>
"Wait&mdash;don't look yet, Dave! Count <reg orig="Lu-|igi">Luigi</reg>, <lb/>
here's paper and pencil.Set down that <lb/>
thing that you said was the most striking one <lb/>
that was foretold to you, and happened less <lb/>
<figure id="f219" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0143"/>
<pb n="139" entity="DSSR_000002495_0144"/>
than a year afterward, and give it to me so I <lb/>
can see if Dave finds it in your hand."</p>
<p>Luigi wrote a line privately, and folded up <lb/>
the piece of paper, and handed it to Tom, <lb/>
saying&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f220" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0144"/>
<p>"I'll tell you when to look at it, if he <lb/>
finds it."</p>
<p>Wilson begen to study Luigi's palm, tracing <lb/>
life lines, heart lines, head lines, and so on, <lb/>
and nothing carefully their relations with the <lb/>
cobweb of finer and more delicate marks and <lb/>
lines that enmeshed them on all sides; he <lb/>
felt of the fleshy cushion at the base of the <lb/>
thumb, and noted its shape; he felt of the <lb/>
fleshy side of the hand between the wrist and <lb/>
the base of the little finger, and noted its <lb/>
shape also; he painstakingly examined the <lb/>
fingers, observing their form, proportions, <lb/>
and natural manner of disposing themselves <lb/>
when in repose. All this process was watched <lb/>
by the three spectators with absorbing <reg orig="inter-|est">interest</reg>, <lb/>
their heads bent together over Luigi's <lb/>
palm, and nobody disturbing the stillness <lb/>
with a word. Wilson now entered upon a <lb/>
close survey of the palm again, and his <reg orig="reve-|lations">revelations</reg> <lb/>
began.</p>
<figure id="f221" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0144"/>
<pb n="140" entity="DSSR_000002495_0145"/>
<p>He mapped out Luigi's character and <reg orig="dis-|position">disposition</reg>, <lb/>
his tastes, aversions, proclivities, <reg orig="am-|bitions">ambitions</reg>, <lb/>
and eccentricities in a way which <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
made Luigi wince and the others laugh, <lb/>
but both twins declared that the chart was <lb/>
artistically drawn and was correct.</p>
<p>Next, Wilson took up Luigi's history. He <lb/>
proceeded cautiously and with hesitation, now, <lb/>
moving his finger slowly along the great lines <lb/>
of the palm, and now and then halting it at a <lb/>
"star" or some such landmark, and <reg orig="examin-|ing">examining</reg> <lb/>
that neighborhood minutely. He <reg orig="pro-|claimed">proclaimed</reg> <lb/>
one or two past events, Luigi <reg orig="con-|firmed">confirmed</reg> <lb/>
his correctness, and the search went on. <lb/>
Presently Wilson glanced up suddenly with a <lb/>
surprised expression&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f222" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0145"/>
<p>"Here is record of an incident which you <lb/>
would perhaps not wish me to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Bring it out," said Luigi, good-naturedly; <lb/>
" I promise you it sha' n't embarrass me."</p>
<p>But Wilson still hesitated, and did not seem <lb/>
quite to know what to do. Then he said&mdash;</p>
<p>" I think it is too delicate a matter to&mdash;to <lb/>
&mdash;I believe I would rather write it or whisper <lb/>
it to you, and let you decide for yourself <lb/>
whether you want it talked out or not."</p>
<figure id="f223" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0145"/>
<pb n="141" entity="DSSR_000002495_0146"/>
<p>"That will answer," said Luigi; "write <lb/>
it."</p>
<p>Wilson wrote something on a slip of paper <lb/>
and handed it to Luigi, who read it to himself <lb/>
and said to Tom&mdash;</p>
<p>"Unfold your slip and read it, Mr. <reg orig="Dris-|coll">Driscoll</reg>."</p>
<p>Tom read:</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">It was prophesied that I would kill a man.</hi> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">It came true before the year was out.</hi>"</p>
<p>"Tom added, "Great Scott!"</p>
<p>Luigi handed Wilson's paper to Tom, and <lb/>
said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Now read this one."</p>
<p>Tom read:</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">You have killed some one, but whether</hi> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">man, woman or child, I do not make out.</hi>"</p>
<figure id="f224" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0146"/>
 <p>"C&aelig;sar's ghost!" commented Tom, with <lb/>
astonishment. "It beats anything that was <lb/>
ever heard of! Why, a man's own hand is <lb/>
his deadliest enemy! Just think of that&mdash;a <lb/>
man's own hand keeps a record of the deepest <lb/>
and fatalest secrets of his life, and is <reg orig="treacher-|ously">treacherously</reg> <lb/>
ready to expose him to any black-magic <lb/>
stranger that comes along. But what do you <lb/>
<figure id="f225" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0146"/>
<pb n="142" entity="DSSR_000002495_0147"/>
let a person look at your hand for, with that <lb/>
awful thing printed in it?"</p>
<p>"Oh," said Luigi, reposefully, " I don't <lb/>
mind it. I killed the man for good reasons, <lb/>
and I don't regret it."</p>
<p>"What were the reasons?"</p>
<p>"Well, he needed killing."</p>
<figure id="f226" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0147"/>
<p>"I 'll tell you why he did it, since he won't <lb/>
say himself," said Angelo, warmly. "He did <lb/>
it to save my life, that 's what he did it for. <lb/>
So it was a noble act, and not a thing to be <lb/>
hid in the dark."</p>
<p>"So it was, so it was," said Wilson; "to do <lb/>
such a thing to save a brother's life is a great <lb/>
and fine action."</p>
<p>"Now come," said Luigi, "it is very pleasant <lb/>
to hear you say these things, but for <reg orig="unsel-|fishness">unselfishness</reg>, <lb/>
or herosim, or magnanimity, the <lb/>
circumstances won't stand scrutiny. You <lb/>
overlook one detail; suppose I had n't saved <lb/>
Angelo's life, what would have become of <lb/>
mine? If I had let the man kill him, <lb/>
would n't he have killed me, too? I saved <lb/>
my own life, you see."</p>
<p>"Yes; that is your way of talking," said <lb/>
<figure id="f227" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0147"/>
<pb n="143" entity="DSSR_000002495_0148"/>
Angelo, "but I know you&mdash;I don't believe <lb/>
you thought of yourself at all. I keep that <lb/>
weapon yet that Luigi killed the man with, <lb/>
and I'll show it to you sometime. That <reg orig="in-|cident">incident</reg> <lb/>
makes it interesting, and it had a <reg orig="his-|tory">history</reg> <lb/>
before it came into Luigi's hands which <lb/>
adds to its interest. It was given to Luigi <lb/>
by a great Indian prince, the Gaikowar of <lb/>
Baroda, and it had been in his family two or <lb/>
three centuries. It killed a good many <reg orig="dis-|agreeable">disagreeable</reg> <lb/>
people who troubled that <reg orig="hearth-|stone">hearthstone</reg> <lb/>
at one time and another. It is n't much <lb/>
to look at, except that it is n't shaped like <lb/>
other knives, or dirks, or whatever it may be <lb/>
called&mdash;here, I'll draw it for you." He took <lb/>
a sheet of paper and made a rapid sketch. <lb/>
"There it is&mdash;a broad and murderous blade, <lb/>
with edges like a razor for sharpness. The <lb/>
devices engraved on it are the ciphers or <lb/>
names of its long line of possessors&mdash;I had <lb/>
Luigi's name added in Roman letters myself <lb/>
with our coat of arms, as you see. You notice <lb/>
what a curious handle the thing has. It is <lb/>
solid ivory, polished like a mirror, and is four <lb/>
or five inches long&mdash;round, and as thick as <lb/>
<figure id="f228" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0148"/>
<figure id="f229" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0148"/>
<pb n="144" entity="DSSR_000002495_0149"/>
a large man's wrist, with the end squared off <lb/>
flat, for your thumb to rest on; for you grasp <lb/>
it, with your thumb resting on the blunt end <lb/>
&mdash;so&mdash;and lift it aloft and strike downward. <lb/>
The Gaikowar showed us how the thing was <lb/>
done when he gave it to Luigi, and before that <lb/>
night was ended Luigi had used the knife, <lb/>
and the Gaikowar was a man short by reason <lb/>
of it. The sheath is magnificently <reg orig="orna-|mented">ornamented</reg> <lb/>
with gems of great value. You will <lb/>
find the sheath more worth looking at than <lb/>
the knife itself, of course."</p>
<p>Tom said to himself&mdash;</p>
<p>"It 's lucky I came here. I would have sold <lb/>
that knife for a song; I supposed the jewels <lb/>
were glass."</p>
<p>"But go on; don't stop," said Wilson. <lb/>
"Our curiosity is up now, to hear about the <lb/>
homicide. Tell us about that."</p>
<p>"Well, briefly, the knife was to blame for <lb/>
that, all around. A native servant slipped <lb/>
into our room in the palace in the night, to <lb/>
kill us and steal the knife on account of the <lb/>
fortune incrusted on its sheath, without a <lb/>
doubt. Luigi had it under his pillow; we <lb/>
<figure id="f230" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0149"/>
<figure id="f231" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0149"/>
<pb n="145" entity="DSSR_000002495_0150"/>
were in bed together. There was a dim <lb/>
night-light burning. I was asleep, but Luigi <lb/>
was awake, and he thought he detected a <lb/>
vague form nearing the bed. He slipped the <lb/>
knife out of the sheath and was ready, and <reg orig="un-|embarassed">unembarassed</reg> <lb/>
by hampering bed-clothes, for <lb/>
the weather was hot and we had n't any. <lb/>
Suddenly that native rose at the bedside, and <lb/>
bent over me with his right hand lifted and a <lb/>
dirk in it aimed at my throat; but Luigi <lb/>
grabbed his wrist, pulled him downward, and <lb/>
drove his own knife into the man's neck. <lb/>
That is the whole story."</p>
<figure id="f232" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0150"/>
<p>Wilson and Tom drew deep breaths, and <lb/>
after some general chat about the tragedy, <lb/>
Pudd'nhead said, taking Tom's hand&mdash;</p>
<p>"Now, Tom, I 've never had a look at your <lb/>
palms, as it happens; perhaps you 've got <lb/>
some little questionable privacies that need&mdash; <lb/>
hel-lo!"</p>
<p>Tom had snatched away his hand, and was <lb/>
looking a good deal confused.</p>
<p>"Why, he's blushing!" said Luigi.</p>
<p>Tom darted an ugly look at him, and said <lb/>
sharply&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f233" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0150"/>
<pb n="146" entity="DSSR_000002495_0151"/>
<p>"Well, if I am, it ain't because I'm a <reg orig="mur-|derer">murderer</reg>!" <lb/>
Luigi's dark face flushed, but <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
he could speak or move, Tom added with <lb/>
anxious haste: "Oh, I beg a thousand <reg orig="par-|dons">pardons</reg>. <lb/>
I did n't mean that; it was out before I <lb/>
thought, and I'm very, very, sorry&mdash;you must <lb/>
forgive me!"</p>
<figure id="f234" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0151"/>
<p>Wilson came to the rescue, and smoothed <lb/>
things down as well as he could; and in fact <lb/>
was entirely successful as far as the twins <lb/>
were concerned, for they felt sorrier for the <lb/>
affront put upon him by his guest's outburst <lb/>
of ill manners than for the insult offered to <lb/>
Luigi. But the success was not so <reg orig="pro-|nounced">pronounced</reg> <lb/>
with the offender. Tom tried to <lb/>
seem at his ease, and he went through the <lb/>
motions fairly well, but at bottom he felt <reg orig="re-|sentful">resentful</reg> <lb/>
toward all the three witnesses of his <lb/>
exhibition; in fact, he felt so annoyed at them <lb/>
for having witnessed it and noticed it that <lb/>
he almost forgot to feel annoyed at <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
for placing it before them. However, <lb/>
something presently happened which made <lb/>
him almost comfortable, and brought him <lb/>
nearly back to a state of charity and <reg orig="friend-|liness">friendliness</reg>. <lb/>
<figure id="f235" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0151"/>
<pb n="147" entity="DSSR_000002495_0152"/>
This was a little spat between the <lb/>
twins; not much of a spat, but still a spat; <lb/>
and before they got far with it they were <lb/>
in a decided condition of irritation with each <lb/>
other. Tom was charmed; so pleased, <reg orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg>, <lb/>
that he cautiously did what he could to <lb/>
increase the irritation while pretending to be <lb/>
actuated by more respectable motives. By <lb/>
his help the fire got warmed up to the <reg orig="blazing-|point">blazing-point</reg>, <lb/>
and he might have had the happiness <lb/>
of seeing the flames show up, in another <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg>, <lb/>
but for the interruption of a knock on <lb/>
the door&mdash;an interruption which fretted him <lb/>
as much as it gratified Wilson. Wilson <lb/>
opened the door.</p>
<figure id="f236" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0152"/>
<p>The visitor was a good-natured, ignorant, <lb/>
energetic, middle-aged Irishman named John <lb/>
Buckstone, who was a great politician in a <lb/>
small way, and always took a large share in <lb/>
public matters of every sort. One of the <lb/>
town's chief excitements, just now, was over <lb/>
the matter of rum. There was a strong rum <lb/>
party and a strong anti-rum party. Buckstone <lb/>
was training with the rum party, and he had <lb/>
been sent to hunt up the twins and invite <lb/>
<figure id="f237" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0152"/>
<pb n="148" entity="DSSR_000002495_0153"/>
them to attend a mass-meeting of that faction. <lb/>
He delivered his errand, and said the clans <lb/>
were already gathering in the big hall over <lb/>
the market-house. Luigi accepted the <reg orig="invita-|tion">invitation</reg> <lb/>
cordially, Angelo less cordially, since he <lb/>
disliked crowds, and did not drink the <reg orig="power-|ful">powerful</reg> <lb/>
intoxicants of America. In fact, he was <lb/>
even a teetotaler sometimes&mdash;when it was <lb/>
judicious to be one.</p>
<p>The twins left with Buckstone, and Tom <lb/>
Driscoll joined company with them uninvited.</p>
<p>In the distance one could see a long <reg orig="waver-|ing">wavering</reg> <lb/>
line of torches drifting down the main <lb/>
street, and could hear the throbbing of the <lb/>
bass drum, the clash of cymbals, the <reg orig="squeak-|ing">squeaking</reg> <lb/>
of a fife or two, and the faint roar of <reg orig="re-|mote">remote</reg> <lb/>
hurrahs. The tail-end of this procession <lb/>
was climbing the market-house stairs when <lb/>
the twins arrived in its neighborhood; when <lb/>
they reached the hall it was full of people, <lb/>
torches, smoke, noise and enthusiasm. They <lb/>
were conducted to the platform by Buckstone <lb/>
&mdash;Tom Driscoll still following&mdash;and were <lb/>
delivered to the chairman in the midst of <lb/>
a prodigious explosion of welcome. When <lb/>
<figure id="f238" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0153"/>
<pb n="149" entity="DSSR_000002495_0154"/>
the noise had moderated a little, the chair <lb/>
proposed that "our illustrious guests be at <lb/>
once elected, by complimentary acclamation, <lb/>
to membership in our ever-glorious <reg orig="organiza-|tion">organization</reg>, <lb/>
the paradise of the free and the perdition <lb/>
of the slave."</p>
<p>This eloquent discharge opened the <reg orig="flood-|gates">floodgates</reg> <lb/>
of enthusiasm again, and the election <lb/>
was carried with thundering unanimity. Then <lb/>
arose a storm of cries:</p>
<p>"Wet them down! Wet them down! <lb/>
Give them a drink!"</p>
<p>Glasses of whisky were handed to the <lb/>
twins. Luigi waved his aloft, then brought <lb/>
it to his lips; but Angelo set his down. <lb/>
There was another storm of cries:</p>
<figure id="f239" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0154"/>
<p>"What's the matter with the other one?"</p>
<p>"What is the blond one going back on us <lb/>
for?" "Explain! Explain!"</p>
<figure id="f240" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0154"/>
<p>The chairman inquired, and then reported&mdash;</p>
<p>"We have made an unfortunate mistake, <lb/>
gentlemen. I find that the Count Angelo <lb/>
Cappello is opposed to our creed&mdash;is a <reg orig="teeto-|taler">teetotaler</reg>, <lb/>
in fact, and was not intending to apply <lb/>
for membership with us. He desires that we <lb/>
<figure id="f241" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0154"/>
<pb n="150" entity="DSSR_000002495_0155"/>
reconsider the vote by which he was elected. <lb/>
What is the pleasure of the house?"</p>
<p>There was a general burst of laughter, <reg orig="plen-|tifully">plentifully</reg> <lb/>
accented with whistlings and cat-calls, <lb/>
but the energetic use of the gavel presently <lb/>
restored something like order. Then a man <lb/>
spoke from the crowd, and said that while he <lb/>
was very sorry that the mistake had been <lb/>
made, it would not be possible to rectify it at <lb/>
the present meeting. According to the <reg orig="by-|laws">bylaws</reg> <lb/>
it must go over to the next regular <lb/>
meeting for action. He would not offer a <lb/>
motion, as none was required. He desired to <lb/>
apologize to the gentleman in the name of <lb/>
the house, and begged to assure him that as <lb/>
far as it might lie in the power of the Sons of <lb/>
Liberty, his temporary membership in the <lb/>
order would be made pleasant to him.</p>
<figure id="f242" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0155"/>
<p>This speech was received with great <reg orig="ap-|plause">applause</reg>, <lb/>
mixed with cries of&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f243" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0155"/>
<p>"That's the talk!" "He's a good fellow, <lb/>
anyway, if he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a teetotaler!" "Drink his <lb/>
health!" "Give him a rouser, and no <reg orig="heel-|taps">heel-taps</reg>!"</p>
<p>Glasses were handed around, and <reg orig="every-|body">everybody</reg> <lb/>
<figure id="f244" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0155"/>
<pb n="151" entity="DSSR_000002495_0156"/>
on the platform drank Angelo's health, <lb/>
while the house bollowed forth in song:</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>For he's a jolly good fel-low,</l>
<l>For he's a jolly good fel-low,</l>
<l>For he's a jolly good fe-el-low,&mdash;</l>
<l rend="indent">Which nobody can deny.</l>
</lg>
<p>Tom Driscoll drank. It was his second <lb/>
glass, for he had drunk Angelo's the moment <lb/>
that Angelo had set it down. The two drinks <lb/>
made him very merry&mdash;almost idiotically so&mdash; <lb/>
and he began to take a most lively and <reg orig="promi-|nent">prominent</reg> <lb/>
part in the proceedings, particularly in <lb/>
the music and cat-calls and side-remarks.</p>
<p>The chairman was still standing at the <lb/>
front, the twins at his side. The <reg orig="extraordi-|narily">extraordinarily</reg> <lb/>
close resemblance of the brothers to <lb/>
each other suggested a witticism to Tom <lb/>
Driscoll, and just as the chairman began a <lb/>
speech he skipped forward and said with an <lb/>
air of tipsy confidence to the audience&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f245" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0156"/>
<p>"Boys, I move that he keeps still and lets <lb/>
this human philopena snip you out a speech."</p>
<p>The descriptive aptness of the phrase caught <lb/>
the house, and a mighty burst of laughter <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg>.</p>
<figure id="f246" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0156"/>
<pb n="152" entity="DSSR_000002495_0157"/>
<p>Luigi's southern blood leaped to the <reg orig="boiling-|point">boiling-point</reg> <lb/>
in a moment under the sharp <reg orig="humilia-|tion">humiliation</reg> <lb/>
of this insult delivered in the presence of <lb/>
four hundred strangers. It was not in the <lb/>
young man's nature to let the matter pass, or <lb/>
to delay the squaring of the account. He <lb/>
took a couple of strides and halted behind the <lb/>
unsuspecting joker. Then he drew back and <lb/>
delivered a kick of such titantic vigor that it <lb/>
lifted Tom clear over the footlights and landed <lb/>
him on the heads of the front row of the Sons <lb/>
of Liberty.</p>
<figure id="f247" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0157"/>
<p>Even a sober person does not like to have <lb/>
a human being emptied on him when he is <lb/>
not doing any harm; a person who is not <lb/>
sober cannot endure such an attention at all. <lb/>
The nest of Sons of Liberty that Driscoll <lb/>
landed in had not a sober bird in it; in fact <lb/>
there was probably not an entirely sober one <lb/>
in the auditorium. Driscoll was promptly <lb/>
and indignantly flung on to the heads of Sons <lb/>
in the next row, and these Sons passed him <lb/>
on toward the rear, and then immediately <lb/>
began to pummel the front-row Sons who had <lb/>
passed him to them. This course was strictly <lb/>
<figure id="f248" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0157"/>
<pb n="153" entity="DSSR_000002495_0158"/>
followed by bench after bench as Driscoll <lb/>
traveled in his tumultuous and airy flight <lb/>
toward the door; so he left behind him an <lb/>
ever lengthening wake of raging and plunging <lb/>
and fighting and swearing humanity. Down <lb/>
went group after group of torches, and <reg orig="pres-|ently">presently</reg> <lb/>
above the deafening clatter of the gavel, <lb/>
roar of angry voices, and crash of succumbing <lb/>
benches, rose the paralyzing cry of "<hi rend="small-caps">Fire</hi>!"</p>
<p>The fighting ceased instantly; the cursing <lb/>
ceased; for one distinctly defined moment <lb/>
there was a dead hush, a motionless calm, <lb/>
where the tempest had been; then with one <lb/>
impulse the multitude awoke to life and <lb/>
energy again, and went surging and <reg orig="strug-|gling">struggling</reg> <lb/>
and swaying, this way and that, its <lb/>
outer edges melting away through windows <lb/>
and doors and gradually lessening the pressure <lb/>
and relieving the mass.</p>
<p>The fire-boys were never on hand so <reg orig="sud-|denly">suddenly</reg> <lb/>
before; for there was no distance to go, <lb/>
this time, their quarters being in the rear end <lb/>
of the market-house. There was an engine <lb/>
company and a hook-and-ladder company. <lb/>
Half of each was composed of rummies and <lb/>
<figure id="f249" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0158"/>
<pb n="154" entity="DSSR_000002495_0159"/>
the other half of anti-rummies, after the moral <lb/>
and political share-and-share-alike fashion of <lb/>
the frontier town of the period. Enough <lb/>
anti-rummies were loafing in quarters to man <lb/>
the engine and the ladders. In two minutes <lb/>
they had their red shirts and helmets on&mdash;they <lb/>
never stirred officially in unofficial costume&mdash; <lb/>
and as the mass meeting overhead smashed <lb/>
through the long row of windows and poured <lb/>
out upon the roof of the arcade, the deliverers <lb/>
were ready for them with a powerful stream of <lb/>
water which washed some of them off the <lb/>
roof and nearly drowned the rest. But water <lb/>
was preferable to fire, and still the stampede <lb/>
from the windows continued, and still the <reg orig="piti-|less">pitiless</reg> <lb/>
drenchings assailed it until the building <lb/>
was empty; then the fire-boys mounted to the <lb/>
hall and flooded it with water enough to <reg orig="anni-|hilate">annihilate</reg> <lb/>
forty times as much fire as there was <lb/>
there; for a village fire-company does not <reg orig="of-|ten">often</reg> <lb/>
get a chance to show off, and so when it <lb/>
does get a chance it makes the most of it. <lb/>
Such citizens of that village as were of a <lb/>
thoughtful and judicious temperament did not <lb/>
insure against fire; they insured against the <lb/>
fire-company.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Judge Driscoll</hi> was in bed and asleep by <lb/>
ten o'clock on Friday night, and he was up <lb/>
and gone a-fishing before daylight in the <lb/>
morning with his friend Pembroke Howard. <lb/>
These two had been boys together in Virginia <lb/>
<figure id="f252" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0160"/>
<pb n="156" entity="DSSR_000002495_0161"/>
when that State still ranked as the chief and <lb/>
most imposing member of the Union, and <lb/>
they still coupled the proud and affectionate <lb/>
adjective "old" with her name when they <lb/>
spoke of her. In Missouri a recognized <reg orig="su-|periority">superiority</reg> <lb/>
attached to any person who hailed <lb/>
from Old Virginia; and this superiority was <lb/>
exalted to supremacy when a person of such <lb/>
nativity could also prove descent from the <lb/>
First Families of that great commonwealth. <lb/>
The Howards and Driscolls were of this <reg orig="aris-|tocracy">aristocracy</reg>. <lb/>
In their eyes it was a nobility. It <lb/>
had its unwritten laws, and they were as clearly <lb/>
defined and as strict as any that could be <lb/>
found among the printed statutes of the land. <lb/>
The F. F. V. was born a gentleman; his <reg orig="high-|est">highest</reg> <lb/>
duty in life was to watch over that great <lb/>
inheritance and keep it unsmirched. He <lb/>
must keep his honor spotless. Those laws <lb/>
were his chart; his course was marked out on <lb/>
it; if he swerved from it by so much as half a <lb/>
point of the compass it meant shipwreck to <lb/>
his honor; that is to say, degradation from his <lb/>
rank as a gentleman. These laws required <lb/>
certain things of him which his religion might <lb/>

<pb n="157" entity="DSSR_000002495_0162"/>
forbid: then his religion must yield&mdash;the laws <lb/>
could not be relaxed to accommodate religions <lb/>
or anything else. Honor stood first; and the <lb/>
laws defined what it was and wherein it <reg orig="dif-|fered">differed</reg> <lb/>
in certain details from honor as defined <lb/>
by church creeds and by the social laws and <lb/>
customs of some of the minor divisions of the <lb/>
globe that had got crowded out when the <lb/>
sacred boundaries of Virginia were staked <lb/>
out.</p>

<p>If Judge Driscoll was the recognized first <lb/>
citizen of Dawson's Landing, Pembroke <reg orig="How-|ard">Howard</reg> <lb/>
was easily its recognized second citizen. <lb/>
He was called "the great lawyer"&mdash;an earned <lb/>
title. He and Driscoll were of the same age <lb/>
&mdash;a year or two past sixty.</p>
<p>Although Driscoll was a free-thinker and <lb/>
Howard a strong and determined <reg orig="Presbyte-|rian">Presbyterian</reg>, <lb/>
their warm intimacy suffered no <reg orig="impair-|ment">impairment</reg> <lb/>
in consequence. They were men whose <lb/>
opinions were their own property and not <lb/>
subject to revision and amendment, <reg orig="sugges-|tion">suggestion</reg> <lb/>
or criticism, by anybody, even their <lb/>
friends.</p>

down stream in their skiff, talking national <lb/>
politics and other high matters, and presently <lb/>
met a skiff coming up from town, with a man <lb/>
in it who said:</p>
<p>"I reckon you know one of the new twins <lb/>
gave your nephew a kicking last night, <lb/>
Judge?"</p>
<p>"Did <hi rend="italic">what?</hi>"</p>
<p>"Gave him a kicking."</p>
<p>The old Judge's lips paled, and his eyes <reg orig="be-|gan">began</reg> <lb/>
to flame. He choked with anger for a <lb/>
moment, then he got out what he was trying <lb/>
to say&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f258" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0163"/>
<p>"Well&mdash;well&mdash;go on! give me the details."</p>
<p>The man did it. At the finish the Judge <lb/>
was silent a minute, turning over in his mind <lb/>
the shameful picture of Tom's flight over the <lb/>
footlights; then he said, as if musing aloud&mdash; <lb/>
"H'm&mdash;I don't understand it. I was asleep <lb/>
at home. He did n't wake me. Thought he <lb/>
was competent to manage his affair without <lb/>
my help, I reckon." His face lit up with <lb/>
pride and pleasure at that thought, and he <lb/>
said with a cheery complacency, "I like that <lb/>
&mdash;it's the true old blood&mdash;hey, Pembroke?"</p>
<figure id="f259" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0163"/>
<pb n="159" entity="DSSR_000002495_0164"/>
<p>Howard smiled an iron smile, and nodded <lb/>
his head approvingly. Then the news-bringer <lb/>
spoke again&mdash;</p>
<p>"But Tom beat the twin on the trial."</p>
<p>The Judge looked at the man wonderingly, <lb/>
and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"The trial? What trial?"</p>
<p>"Why, Tom had him up before Judge <reg orig="Rob-|inson">Robinson</reg> <lb/>
for assault and battery."</p>
<p>The old man shrank suddenly together <lb/>
like one who has received a death-stroke. <lb/>
Howard sprang for him as he sank forward in <lb/>
a swoon, and took him in his arms, and <lb/>
bedded him on his back in the boat. He <lb/>
sprinkled water in his face, and said to the <lb/>
startled visitor&mdash;</p>
<p>"Go, now&mdash;don't let him come to and find <lb/>
you here. You see what an effect your <reg orig="heed-|less">heedless</reg> <lb/>
speech has had; you ought to have been <lb/>
more considerate than to blurt out such a <lb/>
cruel piece of slander as that."</p>
<p>"I'm right down sorry I did it now, Mr. <lb/>
Howard, and I would n't have done it if I had <lb/>
thought: but it ain't slander; it's perfectly <lb/>
true, just as I told him."</p>
<figure id="f260" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0164"/>
<pb n="160" entity="DSSR_000002495_0165"/>
<p>He rowed away. Presently the old Judge <lb/>
came out of his faint and looked up piteously <lb/>
into the sympathetic face that was bent over <lb/>
him.</p>
<p>"Say it ain't true, Pembroke; tell me it <lb/>
ain't true!" he said in a weak voice.</p>
<p>There was nothing weak in the deep <reg orig="organ-|tones">organ-tones</reg> <lb/>
that responded&mdash;</p>
<p>"You know it's a lie as well as I do, old <lb/>
friend. He is of the best blood of the Old <lb/>
Dominion."</p>
<figure id="f261" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0165"/>
<p>"God bless you for saying it!" said the old <lb/>
gentleman, fervently. "Ah, Pembroke, it <lb/>
was such a blow!"</p>
<p>Howard stayed by his friend, and saw him <lb/>
home, and entered the house with him. It <lb/>
was dark, and past supper-time, but the Judge <lb/>
was not thinking of supper; he was eager to <lb/>
hear the slander refuted from headquarters, <lb/>
and as eager to have Howard hear it, too. <lb/>
Tom was sent for, and he came immediately. <lb/>
He was bruised and lame, and was not a <lb/>
happy-looking object. His uncle made him <lb/>
sit down, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"We have been hearing about your <reg orig="adven-|ture">adventure</reg>, <lb/>
<figure id="f262" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0165"/>
<pb n="161" entity="DSSR_000002495_0166"/>
Tom, with a handsome lie added to it <lb/>
for embellishment. Now pulverize that lie to <lb/>
dust! What measures have you taken? How <lb/>
does the thing stand?"</p>
<p>Tom answered guilelessly: "It don't stand <lb/>
at all; it's all over. I had him up in court <lb/>
and beat him. Pudd'nhead Wilson defended <lb/>
him&mdash;first case he ever had, and lost it. The <lb/>
judge fined the miserable hound five dollars <lb/>
for the assault."</p>
<figure id="f263" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0166"/>
<p>Howard and the Judge sprang to their <lb/>
feet with the opening sentence&mdash;why, neither <lb/>
knew; then they stood gazing vacantly at <lb/>
each other. Howard stood a moment, then <lb/>
sat mournfully down without saying anything. <lb/>
The Judge's wrath began to kindle, and he <lb/>
burst out&mdash;</p>
<p>"You cur! You scum! You vermin! Do <lb/>
you mean to tell me that blood of my race <lb/>
has suffered a blow and crawled to a court <lb/>
of law about it? Answer me!"</p>
<p>Tom's head drooped, and he answered <lb/>
with an eloquent silence. His uncle stared <lb/>
at him with a mixed expression of amazement <lb/>
and shame and incredulity that was sorrowful <lb/>
to see. At last he said&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f264" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0166"/>
<pb n="162" entity="DSSR_000002495_0167"/>
<p>"Which of the twins was it?"</p>
<p>"Count Luigi."</p>
<p>"You have challenged him?"</p>
<p>"N&mdash;no," hesitated Tom, turning pale.</p>
<p>"You will challenge him to-night. Howard <lb/>
will carry it."</p>
<p>Tom began to turn sick, and to show it. <lb/>
He turned his hat round and round in his <lb/>
hand, his uncle glowering blacker and blacker <lb/>
upon him as the heavy seconds drifted by; <lb/>
then at last he began to stammer, and said <lb/>
piteously&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f265" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0167"/>
<p>"Oh, please don't ask me to do it, uncle! <lb/>
He is a murderous devil&mdash;I never could&mdash;I&mdash; <lb/>
I'm afraid of him!"</p>
<p>Old Driscoll's mouth opened and closed <lb/>
three times before he could get it to perform <lb/>
its office; then he stormed out&mdash;</p>
<p>"A coward in my family! A Driscoll a <lb/>
coward! Oh, what have I done to deserve <lb/>
this infamy!" He tottered to his secretary in <lb/>
the corner repeating that lament again and <lb/>
again in heartbreaking tones, and got out of <lb/>
a drawer a paper, which he slowly tore to bits <lb/>
scattering the bits absently in his track as he <lb/>
<figure id="f266" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0167"/>
<pb n="163" entity="DSSR_000002495_0168"/>
walked up and down the room, still grieving <lb/>
and lamenting. At last he said&mdash;</p>
<p>"There it is, shreds and fragments once <lb/>
more&mdash;my will. Once more you have forced <lb/>
me to disinherit you, you base son of a most <lb/>
noble father! Leave my sight! Go&mdash;before <lb/>
I spit on you!"</p>
<figure id="f267" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0168"/>
<p>The young man did not tarry. Then the <lb/>
Judge turned to Howard:</p>
<p>"You will be my second, old friend?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"There is pen and paper. Draft the <reg orig="car-|tel">cartel</reg>, <lb/>
and lose no time."</p>
<p>"The Count shall have it in his hands in <lb/>
fifteen minutes," said Howard.</p>
<p>Tom was very heavy-hearted. His <reg orig="appe-|tite">appetite</reg> <lb/>
was gone with his property and his <reg orig="self-re-|spect">self-respect</reg>. <lb/>
He went out the back way and <lb/>
wandered down the obscure lane grieving, <lb/>
and wondering if any course of future conduct, <lb/>
however discreet and carefully perfected and <lb/>
watched over, could win back his uncle's <lb/>
favor and persuade him to reconstruct once <lb/>
more that generous will which had just gone <lb/>
to ruin before his eyes. He finally concluded <lb/>
<figure id="f268" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0168"/>
<pb n="164" entity="DSSR_000002495_0169"/>
that it could. He said to himself that he <lb/>
had accomplished this sort of triumph once <lb/>
already, and that what had been done once <lb/>
could be done again. He would set about it. <lb/>
He would bend every energy to the task, and <lb/>
he would score that triumph once more, cost <lb/>
what it might to his convenience, limit as it <lb/>
might his frivolous and liberty-loving life.</p>
<p>"To begin," he said to himself, "I'll square <lb/>
up with the proceeds of my raid, and then <lb/>
gambling has got to be stopped&mdash;and stopped <lb/>
short off. It's the worst vice I've got&mdash;from <lb/>
my standpoint, anyway, because it's the one <lb/>
he can most easily find out, through the <reg orig="im-|patience">impatience</reg> <lb/>
of my creditors. He thought it <reg orig="ex-|pensive">expensive</reg> <lb/>
to have to pay two hundred dollars to <lb/>
them for me once. Expensive&mdash;<hi rend="italic">that!</hi> Why, <lb/>
it cost me the whole of his fortune&mdash;but of <lb/>
course he never thought of that; some <reg orig="peo-|ple">people</reg> <lb/>
can't think of any but their own side of a <lb/>
case. If he had known how deep I am in, <lb/>
now, the will would have gone to pot without <lb/>
waiting for a duel to help. Three hundred <lb/>
dollars! It's a pile! But he'll never hear <lb/>
of it, I'm thankful to say. The minute I've <lb/>
<figure id="f269" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0169"/>
<pb n="165" entity="DSSR_000002495_0170"/>
cleared it off, I'm safe; and I'll never touch a <lb/>
card again. Anyway, I won't while he lives, <lb/>
I make oath to that. I'm entering on my <lb/>
last reform&mdash;I know it&mdash;yes, and I'll win; but <lb/>
after that, if I ever slip again I'm gone."</p>

fences inclosing vacant country on each <lb/>

he came moping back again, with many sighs <lb/>
and heavy with trouble. He sorely wanted <lb/>
cheerful company. Rowena! His heart gave <lb/>
a bound at the thought, but the next thought <lb/>
quieted it&mdash;the detested twins would be <lb/>
there.</p>
<p>He was on the inhabited side of Wilson's <lb/>

that the sitting-room was lighted. This <lb/>
would do; others made him feel unwelcome <lb/>
sometimes, but Wilson never failed in <reg orig="cour-|tesy">courtesy</reg> <lb/>
toward him, and a kindly courtesy does <lb/>
at least save one's feelings, even if it is not <lb/>
professing to stand for a welcome. Wilson <lb/>
heard footsteps at his threshold, then the <lb/>
clearing of a throat.</p>
<figure id="f272" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0172"/>
<p>"It's that fickle-tempered, dissipated young <lb/>

<p>A dejected knock. "Come in!"</p>
<p>Tom entered, and drooped into a chair, <lb/>
without saying anything. Wilson said <lb/>
kindly&mdash;</p>
<p>"Why, my boy, you look desolate. Don't <lb/>
take it so hard. Try and forget you have <lb/>
been kicked.'</p>
<p>"Oh, dear," said Tom, wretchedly, "it's <lb/>

<p>"Why, Tom, what do you mean? Has <lb/>

<p>"Flung me? No, but the old man has."</p>
<p>Wilson said to himself, "Aha!" and <lb/>
thought of the mysterious girl in the bedroom. <lb/>
"The Driscolls have been making <reg orig="discover-|ies">discoveries</reg>!" <lb/>
Then he said aloud, gravely:</p>
<p>"Tom, there are some kinds of dissipation <lb/>
which&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<figure id="f274" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0173"/>
<p>"Oh, shucks, this has n't got anything to <lb/>
do with dissipation. He wanted me to <reg orig="chal-|lenge">challenge</reg> <lb/>
that derned Italian savage, and I <lb/>
would n't do it."</p>
<p>"Yes, of course he would do that," said <lb/>
Wilson in a meditative matter-of-course way, <lb/>
"but the thing that puzzled me was, why he <lb/>
did n't look to that last night, for one thing, <lb/>
and why he let you carry such a matter into <lb/>
a court of law at all, either before the duel or <lb/>
after it. It's no place for it. It was not like <lb/>
him. I could n't understand it. How did it <lb/>

<p>"It happened because he did n't know <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>

<p>"And you did n't wake him? Tom, is <lb/>
that possible?"</p>
<p>Tom was not getting much comfort here. <lb/>
He fidgeted a moment, then said:</p>
<p>"I did n't choose to tell him&mdash;that's all. <lb/>
He was going a-fishing before dawn, with <lb/>
Pembroke Howard, and if I got the twins into <lb/>
the common calaboose&mdash;and I thought sure I <lb/>
could&mdash;I never dreamed of their slipping out <lb/>
on a paltry fine for such an outrageous <reg orig="of-|fense&mdash;well">offense&mdash;well</reg>, <lb/>
once in the calaboose they would <lb/>
be disgraced, and uncle would n't want any <lb/>
duels with that sort of characters, and <lb/>
would n't allow any."</p>
<figure id="f276" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0174"/>
<p>"Tom, I am ashamed of you! I don't see <lb/>
how you could treat your good old uncle so. <lb/>
I am a better friend of his than you are; for <lb/>
if I had known the circumstances I would <lb/>
have kept that case out of court until I got <lb/>
word to him and let him have a gentleman's <lb/>
chance."</p>
<p>"You would?" exclaimed Tom, with lively <lb/>
surprise. "And it your first case! And you <lb/>
know perfectly well there never would have <lb/>

you? And you'd have finished your days a <lb/>
pauper nobody, instead of being an actually <lb/>

you would really have done that, would you?"</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>Tom looked at him a moment or two, then <lb/>
shook his head sorrowfully and said&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f278" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0175"/>
<p>"I believe you&mdash;upon my word I do. I <lb/>
don't know why I do, but I do. Pudd'nhead <lb/>
Wilson, I think you're the biggest fool I <lb/>
ever saw."</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>"Don't mention it."</p>
<p>"Well, he has been requiring you to fight <lb/>
the Italian and you have refused. You <reg orig="degen-|erate">degenerate</reg> <lb/>
remnant of an honorable line! I'm <lb/>
thoroughly ashamed of you, Tom!"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's nothing! I don't care for <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg>, <lb/>
now that the will's torn up again."</p>
<p>"Tom, tell me squarely&mdash;did n't he find <lb/>
any fault with you for anything but those two <lb/>
things&mdash;carrying the case into court and <reg orig="re-|fusing">refusing</reg> <lb/>
to fight?"</p>
<p>He watched the young fellow's face <reg orig="nar-|rowly">narrowly</reg>, <lb/>
but it was entirely reposeful, and so <lb/>
also was the voice that answered:</p>
<figure id="f279" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0175"/>
<pb n="171" entity="DSSR_000002495_0176"/>
<p>"No, he did n't find any other fault with <lb/>
me. If he had had any to find, he would <lb/>
have begun yesterday, for he was just in the <lb/>
humor for it. He drove that jack-pair around <lb/>
town and showed them the sights, and when <lb/>
he came home he could n't find his father's old <lb/>
silver watch that don't keep time and he <lb/>
thinks so much of, and could n't remember <lb/>
what he did with it three or four days ago <lb/>
when he saw it last, and so when I arrived he <lb/>
was all in a sweat about it, and when I <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg> <lb/>
that it probably was n't lost but stolen, <lb/>
it put him in a regular passion and he said I <lb/>
was a fool&mdash;which convinced me, without any <lb/>
trouble, that that was just what he was afraid <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">had</hi> happened, himself, but did not want to <lb/>

ones."</p>

stolen. There's been another raid on the <lb/>

you remember."</p>
<p>"You don't mean it!"</p>
<p>"It's as sure as you are born! Have you <lb/>
missed anything yourself?"</p>
<p>"No. That is, I did miss a silver <reg orig="pencil-|case">pencil-case</reg> <lb/>
that Aunt Mary Pratt gave me last <lb/>
birthday&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You'll find it stolen&mdash;that's what you'll <lb/>

<p>"No, I sha' n't; for when I suggested theft <lb/>
about the watch and got such a rap, I went <lb/>
and examined my room, and the pencil-case <lb/>
was missing, but it was only mislaid, and I <lb/>
found it again."</p>
<figure id="f282" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0177"/>
<p>"You are sure you missed nothing else?"</p>
<p>"Well, nothing of consequence. I missed <lb/>
a small plain gold ring worth two or three <lb/>
dollars, but that will turn up. I'll look <lb/>
again."</p>
<p>"In my opinion you'll not find it. There's <lb/>
been a raid, I tell you, Come <hi rend="italic">in!</hi>"</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Robinson entered, followed by <lb/>

Buckstone and the town-constable, Jim Blake. <lb/>
They sat down, and after some wandering <lb/>
and aimless weather-conversation Wilson <lb/>
said&mdash;</p>
<p>"By the way, we've just added another to <lb/>
the list of thefts, maybe two. Judge Driscoll's <lb/>
old silver watch is gone, and Tom here has <lb/>
missed a gold ring."</p>
<p>"Well, it is a bad business," said the <reg orig="Jus-|tice">Justice</reg>, <lb/>
"and gets worse the further it goes. The <lb/>
Hankses, the Dobsons, the Pilligrews, the <reg orig="Or-|tons">Ortons</reg>, <lb/>
the Grangers, the Hales, the Fullers, <lb/>
the Holcombs, in fact everybody that lives <lb/>
around about Patsy Cooper's has been robbed <lb/>
of little things like trinkets and teaspoons and <lb/>
such-like small valuables that are easily <lb/>
carried off. It's perfectly plain that the <lb/>
thief took advantage of the reception at Patsy <lb/>
Cooper's when all the neighbors were in her <lb/>
house and all their niggers hanging around <lb/>
her fence for a look at the show, to raid the <lb/>
vacant houses undisturbed. Patsy is <reg orig="miser-|able">miserable</reg> <lb/>
about it; miserable on account of the <lb/>
neighbors, and particularly miserable on <reg orig="ac-|count">account</reg> <lb/>
of her foreigners, of course; so <reg orig="miser-|able">miserable</reg> <lb/>
<figure id="f284" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0178"/>
<pb n="174" entity="DSSR_000002495_0179"/>
on their account that she has n't any <lb/>
room to worry about her own little losses."</p>
<p>"It's the same old raider," said Wilson. <lb/>
"I suppose there is n't any doubt about that."</p>
<p>"Constable Blake does n't think so."</p>
<p>"No, you're wrong there," said Blake; <lb/>
"the other times it was a man; there was <lb/>
plenty of signs of that, as we know, in the <lb/>
profession, though we never got hands on him; <lb/>
but this time it's a woman."</p>
<figure id="f285" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0179"/>
<p>Wilson thought of the mysterious girl <lb/>
straight off. She was always in his mind now. <lb/>
But she failed him again. Blake continued:</p>
<p>"She's a stoop-shouldered old woman with <lb/>
a covered basket on her arm, in a black veil, <lb/>
dressed in mourning. I saw her going aboard <lb/>
the ferry-boat yesterday. Lives in Illinois, I <lb/>
reckon; but I don't care where she lives, I'm <lb/>
going to get her&mdash;she can make herself sure <lb/>
of that."</p>
<p>"What makes you think she's the thief?"</p>
<p>"Well, there ain't any other, for one thing; <lb/>
and for another, some of the nigger draymen <lb/>
that happened to be driving along saw her <lb/>
coming out of or going into houses, and told <lb/>
<figure id="f286" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0179"/>
<pb n="175" entity="DSSR_000002495_0180"/>
me so&mdash;and it just happens that they was <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">robbed</hi> houses, every time."</p>
<figure id="f287" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0180"/>
<p>It was granted that this was plenty good <lb/>
enough circumstantial evidence. A pensive <lb/>
silence followed, which lasted some moments, <lb/>
then Wilson said&mdash;</p>
<p>"There's one good thing, anyway. She <lb/>
can't either pawn or sell Count Luigi's costly <lb/>
Indian dagger."</p>
<p>"My!" said Tom, "is <hi rend="italic">that</hi> gone?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, that was a haul! But why can't <lb/>
she pawn it or sell it?"</p>
<p>"Because when the twins went home from <lb/>
the Sons of Liberty meeting last night, news <lb/>
of the raid was sifting in from everywhere, <lb/>
and Aunt Patsy was in distress to know if <lb/>
they had lost anything. They found that the <lb/>
dagger was gone, and they notified the police <lb/>
and pawnbrokers everywhere. It was a great <lb/>
haul, yes, but the old woman won't get <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
out of it, because she'll get caught."</p>
<p>"Did they offer a reward?" asked Buckstone.</p>
<p>"Yes; five hundred dollars for the knife, <lb/>
and five hundred more for the thief."</p>
<figure id="f288" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0180"/>
<pb n="176" entity="DSSR_000002495_0181"/>
<p>"What a leather-headed idea!" exclaimed <lb/>
the constable. "The thief da's n't go near <lb/>
them, nor send anybody. Whoever goes is <lb/>
going to get himself nabbed, for there ain't <lb/>
any pawnbroker that's going to lose the <lb/>
chance to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>If anybody had noticed Tom's face at that <lb/>
time, the gray-green color of it might have <lb/>
provoked curiosity; but nobody did. He <lb/>
said to himself: "I'm gone! I never can <lb/>
square up; the rest of the plunder won't <lb/>
pawn or sell for half of the bill. Oh, I know <lb/>
it&mdash;I'm gone, I'm gone&mdash;and this time it's <lb/>
for good. Oh, this is awful&mdash;I don't know <lb/>
what to do, nor which way to turn!"</p>
<p>"Softly, softly," said Wilson to Blake. "I <lb/>
planned their scheme for them at midnight <lb/>
last night, and it was all finished up <reg orig="ship-|shape">shipshape</reg> <lb/>
by two this morning. They'll get <lb/>
their dagger back, and then I'll explain to <lb/>
you how the thing was done."</p>
<p>There were strong signs of a general <reg orig="curi-|osity">curiosity</reg>, <lb/>
and Buckstone said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, you have whetted us up pretty <lb/>
sharp, Wilson, and I'm free to say that <lb/>
<figure id="f289" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0181"/>
<pb n="177" entity="DSSR_000002495_0182"/>
if you don't mind telling us in <reg orig="confi-|dence&mdash;&mdash;">confidence&mdash;&mdash;"</reg></p>
<p>"Oh, I'd as soon tell as not, Buckstone, <lb/>
but as long as the twins and I agreed to say <lb/>
nothing about it, we must let it stand so. <lb/>
But you can take my word for it you won't <lb/>
be kept waiting three days. Somebody will <lb/>
apply for that reward pretty promptly, and <lb/>
I'll show you the thief and the dagger both <lb/>
very soon afterward."</p>
<figure id="f290" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0182"/>
<p>The constable was disappointed, and also <lb/>
perplexed. He said&mdash;</p>
<p>"It may all be&mdash;yes, and I hope it will, <lb/>
but I'm blamed if I can see my way through <lb/>
it. It's too many for yours truly."</p>
<p>The subject seemed about talked out. <reg orig="No-|body">Nobody</reg> <lb/>
seemed to have anything further to <lb/>
offer. After a silence the justice of the peace <lb/>
informed Wilson that he and Buckstone and <lb/>
the constable had come as a committee, on <lb/>
the part of the Democratic party, to ask him <lb/>
to run for mayor&mdash;for the little town was <lb/>
about to become a city and the first charter <lb/>
election was approaching. It was the first <lb/>
attention which Wilson had ever received at <lb/>
<figure id="f291" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0182"/>
<pb n="178" entity="DSSR_000002495_0183"/>
the hands of any party; it was a sufficiently <lb/>
humble one, but it was a recognition of his <lb/>
d&eacute;but into the town's life and activities at <lb/>
last; it was a step upward, and he was deeply <lb/>
gratified. He accepted, and the committee <lb/>
departed, followed by young Tom.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">About</hi> the time that Wilson was bowing <lb/>

entering the next house to report. He found <lb/>
the old Judge sitting grim and straight in his <lb/>
chair, waiting.</p>
<p>"Well, Howard&mdash;the news?"</p>
<p>"The best in the world."</p>
<p>"Accepts, does he?" and the light of battle <lb/>
gleamed joyously in the Judge's eye.</p>
<p>"Accepts? Why, he jumped at it."</p>
<p>"Did, did he? Now that's fine&mdash;that's <lb/>
very fine. I like that. When is it to be?"</p>
<p>"Now! Straight off! To-night! An <lb/>

<pb n="180" entity="DSSR_000002495_0185"/>
<p>"Admirable? He's a darling! Why, it's <lb/>
an honor as well as a pleasure to stand up <lb/>
before such a man. Come&mdash;off with you! <lb/>
Go and arrange everything&mdash;and give him&mdash; <lb/>
my heartiest compliments. A rare fellow, <lb/>
indeed; an admirable fellow, as you have <lb/>
said!"</p>
<figure id="f295" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0185"/>
<p>Howard hurried away, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>"I'll have him in the vacant stretch <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
Wilson's and the haunted house within <lb/>
the hour, and I'll bring my own pistols."</p>
<p>Judge Driscoll began to walk the floor in a <lb/>
state of pleased excitement; but presently he <lb/>
stopped, and began to think&mdash;began to think <lb/>
of Tom. Twice he moved toward the <reg orig="secre-|tary">secretary</reg>, <lb/>
and twice he turned away again; but <lb/>
finally he said&mdash;</p>
<p>"This may be my last night in the world&mdash; <lb/>
I must not take the chance. He is worthless <lb/>
and unworthy, but it is largely my fault. He <lb/>
was intrusted to me by my brother on his <reg orig="dy-|ing">dying</reg> <lb/>
bed, and I have indulged him to his hurt, <lb/>
instead of training him up severely, and <reg orig="mak-|ing">making</reg> <lb/>
a man of him. I have violated my trust, <lb/>
and I must not add the sin of desertion to <lb/>
<figure id="f296" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0185"/>
<pb n="181" entity="DSSR_000002495_0186"/>
that. I have forgiven him once already, and <lb/>
would subject him to a long and hard trial <lb/>
before forgiving him again, if I could live; <lb/>
but I must not run that risk. No, I must <reg orig="re-|store">restore</reg> <lb/>
the will. But if I survive the duel, I <lb/>
will hide it away, and he will not know, and I <lb/>
will not tell him until he reforms, and I see <lb/>
that his reformation is going to be permanent."</p>
<figure id="f297" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0186"/>
<p>He re-drew the will, and his ostensible <lb/>
nephew was heir to a fortune again. As he <lb/>
was finishing his task, Tom, wearied with <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg> <lb/>
brooding tramp, entered the house and <lb/>
went tiptoeing past the sitting-room door. <lb/>
He glanced in, and hurried on, for the sight <lb/>
of his uncle had nothing but terrors for him <lb/>
to-night. But his uncle was writing! That <lb/>
was unusual at this late hour. What could he <lb/>
be writing? A chill of anxiety settled down <lb/>
upon Tom's heart. Did that writing concern <lb/>
him? He was afraid so. He reflected that <lb/>
when ill luck begins, it does not come in <lb/>
sprinkles, but in showers. He said he would <lb/>
get a glimpse of that document or know the <lb/>
reason why. He heard some one coming, <lb/>
and stepped out of sight and hearing. It was <lb/>
<figure id="f298" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0186"/>
<pb n="182" entity="DSSR_000002495_0187"/>
Pembroke Howard. What could be <reg orig="hatch-|ing">hatching</reg>.</p>
<p>Howard said, with great satisfaction: </p>
<p>"Everything's right and ready. He's gone <lb/>
to the battle-ground with his second and the <lb/>
surgeon&mdash;also with his brother. I've <reg orig="ar-|ranged">arranged</reg> <lb/>
it all with Wilson&mdash;Wilson's his sec <lb/>
ond. We are to have three shots apiece."</p>
<p>"Good! How is the moon?"</p>
<p>"Bright as day, nearly. Perfect, for the <lb/>
distance&mdash;fifteen yards. No wind&mdash;not a <lb/>
breath; hot and still."</p>
<p>"All good; all first-rate. Here, Pembroke, <lb/>
read this, and witness it."</p>
<p>Pembroke read and witnessed the will, then <lb/>
gave the old man's hand a hearty shake and <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Now that's right, York&mdash;but I knew you <lb/>
would do it. You could n't leave that poor <lb/>
chap to fight along without means or <reg orig="profes-|sion">profession</reg>, <lb/>
with certain defeat before him, and I <lb/>
knew you would n't, for his father's sake if not <lb/>
for his own."</p>
<p>"For his dead father's sake I could n't, I <lb/>
know; for poor Percy&mdash;but you know what <lb/>

Percy was to me. But mind&mdash;Tom is not to <lb/>
know of this unless I fall to-night."</p>
<p>"I understand. I'll keep the secret."</p>
<p>The Judge put the will away, and the two <lb/>
started for the battle-ground. In another <lb/>
minute the will was in Tom's hands. His <lb/>
misery vanished, his feelings underwent a <reg orig="tre-|mendous">tremendous</reg> <lb/>
revulsion. He put the will carefully <lb/>
back in its place, and spread his mouth and <lb/>
swung his hat once, twice, three times around <lb/>
his head, in imitation of three rousing huzzas, <lb/>
no sound issuing from his lips. He fell to <lb/>
communing with himself excitedly and <reg orig="joy-|ously">joyously</reg>, <lb/>
but every now and then he let off <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg> <lb/>
volley of dumb hurrahs.</p>
<p>He said to himself: "I've got the fortune <lb/>
again, but I'll not let on that I know about <lb/>
it. And this time I'm going to hang on to <lb/>
it. I take no more risks. I'll gamble no <lb/>
more, I'll drink no more, because&mdash;well, <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
I'll not go where there is any of that <lb/>
sort of thing going on, again. It's the sure <lb/>
way, and the only sure way; I might have <lb/>
thought of that sooner&mdash;well, yes, if I had <lb/>
wanted to. But now&mdash;dear me, I've had a <lb/>
<figure id="f300" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0188"/>
<pb n="184" entity="DSSR_000002495_0189"/>
scare this time, and I'll take no more chances. <lb/>
Not a single chance more. Land! I <reg orig="per-|suaded">persuaded</reg> <lb/>
myself this evening that I could fetch <lb/>
him around without any great amount of <lb/>
effort, but I've been getting more and more <lb/>
heavy-hearted and doubtful straight along, <lb/>
ever since. If he tells me about this thing, <lb/>
all right; but if he does n't, I sha' n't, let on. <lb/>
I&mdash;well, I'd like to tell Pudd'n head Wilson, <lb/>
but&mdash;no, I'll think about that; perhaps I <lb/>
won't." He whirled off another dead huzza, <lb/>
and said, "I'm reformed, and this time I'll <lb/>
stay so, sure!"</p>
<p>He was about to close with a final grand <lb/>
silent demonstration, when he suddenly <reg orig="recol-|lected">recollected</reg> <lb/>
that Wilson had put it out of his power <lb/>
to pawn or sell the Indian knife, and that he <lb/>
was once more in awful peril of exposure by <lb/>
his creditors for that reason. His joy <lb/>
collapsed utterly, and he turned away and <lb/>
moped toward the door moaning and <reg orig="lament-|ing">lamenting</reg> <lb/>
over the bitterness of his luck. He <lb/>
dragged himself up-stairs, and brooded in his <lb/>
room a long time disconsolate and forlorn, <lb/>
with Luigi's Indian knife for a text. At last <lb/>
he sighed and said:</p>
<figure id="f301" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0189"/>
<pb n="185" entity="DSSR_000002495_0190"/>
<p>"When I supposed these stones were glass <lb/>
and this ivory bone, the thing had n't any <reg orig="in-|terest">interest</reg> <lb/>
for me because it had n't any value, and <lb/>
could n't help me out of my trouble. But <lb/>
now&mdash;why, now it is full of interest; yes, and <lb/>
of a sort to break a body's heart. It's a bag <lb/>
of gold that has turned to dirt and ashes in <lb/>
my hands. It could save me, and save me so <lb/>
easily, and yet I've got to go to ruin. It's <lb/>
like drowning with a life-preserver in my <lb/>
reach. All the hard luck comes to me, and <lb/>
all the good luck goes to other people&mdash; <lb/>
Pudd'nhead Wilson, for instance; even his <lb/>
career has got a sort of a little start at last, <lb/>
and what has he done to deserve it, I should <lb/>
like to know? Yes, he has opened his own <lb/>
road, but he is n't content with that, but must <lb/>
block mine. It's a sordid, selfish world, and <lb/>
I wish I was out of it." He allowed the <lb/>
light of the candle to play upon the jewels of <lb/>
the sheath, but the flashings and sparklings <lb/>
had no charm for his eye; they were only just <lb/>
so many pangs to his heart. "I must not <lb/>
say anything to Roxy about this thing," he <lb/>
said, "she is too daring. She would be for <lb/>
<figure id="f302" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0190"/>

<pb n="186" entity="DSSR_000002495_0191"/>
digging these stones out and selling them, <lb/>
and then&mdash;why, she would be arrested and <lb/>
the stones traced, and then&mdash;" The thought <lb/>
made him quake, and he hid the knife away, <lb/>
trembling all over and glancing furtively <lb/>
about, like a criminal who fancies that the <lb/>
accuser is already at hand.</p>
<figure id="f304" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0191"/>
<p>Should he try to sleep? Oh, no, sleep was <lb/>
not for him; his trouble was too haunting, too <lb/>
afflicting for that. He must have somebody <lb/>
to mourn with. He would carry his despair <lb/>
to Roxy.</p>
<p>He had heard several distant gunshots, but <lb/>
that sort of thing was not uncommon, and <lb/>
they had made no impression upon him. He <lb/>
went out at the back door, and turned <reg orig="west-|ward">westward</reg>. <lb/>
He passed Wilson's house and <reg orig="pro-|ceeded">proceeded</reg> <lb/>
along the lane, and presently saw <lb/>
several figures approaching Wilson's place <lb/>
through the vacant lots. These were the <reg orig="du-|elists">duelists</reg> <lb/>
returning from the fight; he thought he <lb/>
recognized them, but as he had no desire for <lb/>
white people's company, he stooped down <reg orig="be-|hind">behind</reg> <lb/>
the fence until they were out of his way.</p>
<figure id="f305" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0191"/>
<p>Roxy was feeling fine. She said:</p>
<pb n="187" entity="DSSR_000002495_0192"/>
<p>"Whah was you, child? Warn't you in it?"</p>
<p>"In what?"</p>
<p>"In de duel."</p>
<p>"Duel? Has there been a duel?"</p>
<p>"'Co'se dey has. De ole Jedge has be'n <lb/>

<figure id="f306" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0192"/>
<p>"Great Scott!" Then he added to himself: <lb/>
"That's what made him re-make the will; he <lb/>
thought he might get killed, and it softened <lb/>
him toward me. And that's what he and <lb/>
Howard were so busy about. . . . Oh dear, <lb/>
if the twin had only killed him, I should be <lb/>
out of my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What is you mumblin' bout, Chambers? <lb/>
Whah was you? Did n't you know dey was <lb/>
gwyne to be a duel?"</p>
<p>"No, I did n't. The old man tried to get <lb/>
me to fight one with Count Luigi, but he <lb/>
did n't succeed, so I reckon he concluded to <lb/>
patch up the family honor himself."</p>
<p>He laughed at the idea, and went rambling <lb/>
on with a detailed account of his talk with the <lb/>
Judge, and how shocked and ashamed the <lb/>
Judge was to find that he had a coward in his <lb/>
family. He glanced up at last, and got a <lb/>
<figure id="f307" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0192"/>
<pb n="188" entity="DSSR_000002495_0193"/>
shock himself. Roxana's bosom was heaving <lb/>
with suppressed passion, and she was <reg orig="glower-|ing">glowering</reg> <lb/>
down upon him with measureless contempt <lb/>
written in her face.</p>
<p>"En you refuse' to fight a man dat kicked <lb/>

It's enough to make him turn in his grave."</p>
<p>The last three sentences stung Tom into a <lb/>
fury, and he said to himself that if his father <lb/>
were only alive and in reach of assassination <lb/>
his mother would soon find that he had a very <lb/>
clear notion of the size of his indebtedness to <lb/>
that man, and was willing to pay it up in full, <lb/>
and would do it too, even at risk of his life; <lb/>
but he kept his thought to himself; that was <lb/>
safest in his mother's present state.</p>

<p>She sat down on her candle-box and fell into <lb/>
a reverie. Tom did not disturb her; he <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
lacked prudence, but it was not in <reg orig="cir-|cumstances">circumstances</reg> <lb/>
of this kind. Roxana's storm <lb/>
went gradually down, but it died hard, and <lb/>
even when it seemed to be quite gone, it <lb/>
would now and then break out in a distant <lb/>
rumble, so to speak, in the form of muttered <lb/>
ejaculations. One of these was, "Ain't <reg orig="nig-|ger">nigger</reg> <lb/>
enough in him to show in his finger-nails, <lb/>
en dat takes mighty little&mdash;yit dey's enough <lb/>
to paint his soul."</p>

<pb n="190" entity="DSSR_000002495_0195"/>
<p>Presently she muttered. "Yassir, enough to <lb/>
paint a whole thimbleful of 'em." At last her <lb/>
ramblings ceased altogether, and her <reg orig="counte-|nance">countenance</reg> <lb/>
began to clear&mdash;a welcome sign to <lb/>
Tom, who had learned her moods, and knew <lb/>
she was on the threshold of good-humor, now. <lb/>
He noticed that from time to time she <reg orig="uncon-|sciously">unconsciously</reg> <lb/>
carried her finger to the end of her <lb/>
nose. He looked closer and said:</p>
<figure id="f311" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0195"/>
<p>"Why, mammy, the end of your nose is <lb/>
skinned. How did that come?"</p>
<p>She sent out the sort of whole-hearted peal <lb/>
of laughter which God has vouchsafed in its <lb/>
perfection to none but the happy angels in <lb/>
heaven and the bruised and broken black slave <lb/>
on the earth, and said:</p>
<p>"Dad fetch dat duel, I be'n in it myself."</p>
<p>"Gracious! did a bullet do that?"</p>
<p>"Yassir, you bet it did!"</p>

<p>He laughed and said he was going to try, <lb/>

having! All its life it had been asleep, but <lb/>
now it hardly got a chance for a nod, so swiftly <lb/>
did big events and crashing surprises come <lb/>

first glimpse of Real Nobility, also grand <lb/>

robber-raid; Friday evening, dramatic kicking <lb/>
of the heir of the chief citizen in presence of <lb/>

night, duel between chief citizen and titled <lb/>
stranger.</p>
<p>The people took more pride in the duel than <lb/>
in all the other events put together, perhaps. <lb/>
It was a glory to their town to have such <lb/>
a thing happen there. In their eyes the <reg orig="princi-|pals">principals</reg> <lb/>
had reached the summit of human honor. <lb/>
Everybody paid homage to their names; their <lb/>
praises were in all mouths. Even the <reg orig="duel-|ists">duelists</reg>' <lb/>
subordinates came in for a handsome <lb/>
share of the public approbation: wherefore <lb/>
Pudd'nhead Wilson was suddenly become a <lb/>
man of consequence. When asked to run for <lb/>
the mayoralty Saturday night he was risking <lb/>
defeat, but Sunday morning found him a <lb/>
made man and his success assured.</p>
<figure id="f329" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0203"/>
<p>The twins were prodigiously great, now; <lb/>
the town took them to its bosom with <reg orig="enthu-|siasm">enthusiasm</reg>. <lb/>
Day after day, and night after night, <lb/>
they went dining and visiting from house to <lb/>
house, making friends, enlarging and <reg orig="solid-|ifying">solidifying</reg> <lb/>
their popularity, and charming and <lb/>
surprising all with their musical prodigies, and <lb/>
now and then heightening the effects with <lb/>
samples of what they could do in other <reg orig="direc-|tions">directions</reg>, <lb/>
<figure id="f330" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0203"/>

<pb n="199" entity="DSSR_000002495_0204"/>
out of their stock of rare and curious <lb/>
accomplishments. They were so pleased <lb/>
that they gave the regulation thirty days' <lb/>
notice, the required preparation for <reg orig="citizen-|ship">citizenship</reg>, <lb/>
and resolved to finish their days in this <lb/>
pleasant place. That was the climax. The <lb/>
delighted community rose as one man and <lb/>
applauded; and when the twins were asked <lb/>
to stand for seats in the forthcoming <reg orig="alder-|manic">aldermanic</reg> <lb/>
board, and consented, the public <reg orig="con-|tentment">contentment</reg> <lb/>
was rounded and complete.</p>
<figure id="f332" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0204"/>
<p>Tom Driscoll was not happy over these <lb/>
things; they sunk deep, and hurt all the way <lb/>
down. He hated the one twin for kicking <lb/>
him, and the other one for being the kicker's <lb/>
brother.</p>
<p>Now and then the people wondered why <lb/>
nothing was heard of the raider, or of the <lb/>
stolen knife or the other plunder, but nobody <lb/>
was able to throw any light on that matter. <lb/>
Nearly a week had drifted by, and still the <lb/>
thing remained a vexed mystery.</p>
<p>On Saturday Constable Blake and <reg orig="Pudd'n-|head">Pudd'nhead</reg> <lb/>
Wilson met on the street, and Tom <lb/>
Driscoll joined them in time to open their <lb/>
<pb n="200" entity="DSSR_000002495_0205"/>
conversation for them. He said to Blake&mdash; <lb/>
"You are not looking well, Blake; you <lb/>
seem to be annoyed about something. Has <lb/>
anything gone wrong in the detective <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg>? <lb/>
I believe you fairly and justifiably <lb/>
claim to have a pretty good reputation in that <lb/>
line, is n't it so?"&mdash;which made Blake feel <lb/>
good, and look it; but Tom added, "for a <lb/>
country detective"&mdash;which made Blake feel <lb/>
the other way, and not only look it, but betray <lb/>
it in his voice&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f333" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0205"/>
<p>"Yes, sir, I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> got a reputation; and it's <lb/>
as good as anybody's in the profession, too, <lb/>
country or no country."</p>
<p>"Oh, I beg pardon; I did n't mean any <reg orig="of-|fense">offense</reg>. <lb/>
What I started out to ask was only <lb/>
about the old woman that raided the town&mdash; <lb/>
the stoop-shouldered old woman, you know, <lb/>
that you said you were going to catch; and I <lb/>
knew you would, too, because you have the <lb/>
reputation of never boasting, and&mdash;well, you <lb/>
&mdash;you've caught the old woman?"</p>
<p>"D&mdash;&mdash; the old woman!"</p>
<p>"Why, sho! you don't mean to say you <lb/>
have n't caught her?"</p>
<figure id="f334" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0205"/>
<pb n="201" entity="DSSR_000002495_0206"/>
<p>"No; I have n't caught her. If anybody <lb/>
could have caught her, I could; but nobody <lb/>
could n't, I don't care who he is."</p>
<p>"I am sorry, real sorry&mdash;for your sake; <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg>, <lb/>
when it gets around that a detective <lb/>
has expressed himself so confidently, and <lb/>
then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<figure id="f335" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0206"/>
<p>"Don't you worry, that's all&mdash;don't you <lb/>
worry; and as for the town, the town need n't <lb/>
worry, either. She's my meat&mdash;make <reg orig="your-|self">yourself</reg> <lb/>
easy about that. I'm on her track; I've <lb/>
got clues that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<figure id="f336" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0206"/>
<p>"That's good! Now if you could get an <lb/>
old veteran detective down from St. Louis to <lb/>
help you find out what the clues mean, and <lb/>
where they lead to, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I'm plenty veteran enough myself, and I <lb/>
don't need anybody's help. I'll have her <reg orig="in-|side">inside</reg> <lb/>
of a we&mdash;inside of a month. That I'll <lb/>
swear to!"</p>
<p>Tom said carelessly&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f337" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0206"/>
<p>"I suppose that will answer&mdash;yes, that <lb/>
will answer. But I reckon she is pretty old, <lb/>
and old people don't often outlive the <reg orig="cau-|tious">cautious</reg> <lb/>
pace of the professional detective when <lb/>
<pb n="202" entity="DSSR_000002495_0207"/>
he has got his clues together and is out on <lb/>
his still-hunt."</p>
<p>Blake's dull face flusned under this gibe, <lb/>
but before he could set his retort in order <lb/>
Tom had turned to Wilson, and was saying, <lb/>
with placid indifference of manner and voice&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f338" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0207"/>
<p>"Who got the reward, Pudd'nhead?"</p>
<p>Wilson winced slightly, and saw that his <lb/>
own turn was come.</p>
<p>"What reward?"</p>
<p>"Why, the reward for the thief, and the <lb/>
other one for the knife."</p>
<p>Wilson answered&mdash;and rather <reg orig="uncomfort-|ably">uncomfortably</reg>, <lb/>
to judge by his hesitating fashion of <reg orig="de-|livering">delivering</reg> <lb/>
himself&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, the&mdash;well, in fact, nobody has <lb/>
claimed it yet."</p>
<p>Tom seemed surprised.</p>
<figure id="f339" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0207"/>
<p>"Why, is that so?"</p>
<p>Wilson showed a trifle of irritation when <lb/>
he replied&mdash;</p>
<p>"Yes, it's so. And what of it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing. Only I thought you had <lb/>
struck out a new idea, and invented a scheme <lb/>
that was going to revolutionize the time-worn <lb/>
<figure id="f340" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0207"/>
<pb n="203" entity="DSSR_000002495_0208"/>
and ineffectual methods of the&mdash;&mdash;" He <lb/>
stopped, and turned to Blake, who was happy <lb/>
now that another had taken his place on the <lb/>
gridiron: "Blake, did n't you understand him <lb/>
to intimate that it would n't be necessary for <lb/>
you to hunt the old woman down?"</p>
<p>"B'George, he said he'd have thief and <lb/>
swag both inside of three days&mdash;he did, by <lb/>
hokey! and that's just about a week ago. <lb/>
Why, I said at the time that no thief and no <lb/>
thief's pal was going to try to pawn or sell a <lb/>
thing where he knowed the pawnbroker could <lb/>
get both rewards by taking <hi rend="italic">him</hi> into camp <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">with</hi> the swag. It was the blessedest idea <lb/>
that ever <hi rend="italic">I</hi> struck!"</p>
<figure id="f341" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0208"/>
<p>"You'd change your mind," said Wilson, <lb/>
with irritated bluntness, "if you knew the <reg orig="en-|tire">entire</reg> <lb/>
scheme instead of only part of it."</p>
<p>"Well," said the constable, pensively, "I <lb/>
had the idea that it would n't work, and up to <lb/>
now I'm right anyway."</p>
<p>"Very well, then, let it stand at that, and <lb/>
give it a further show. It has worked at <lb/>
least as well as your own methods, you <reg orig="per-|ceive">perceive</reg>."</p>
<figure id="f342" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0208"/>
<pb n="204" entity="DSSR_000002495_0209"/>
<p>The constable had n't anything handy to <lb/>
hit back with, so he discharged a discontented <lb/>
sniff, and said nothing.</p>
<p>After the night that Wilson had partly <reg orig="re-|vealed">revealed</reg> <lb/>
his scheme at his house, Tom had tried <lb/>
for several days to guess out the secret of the <lb/>
rest of it, but had failed. Then it occurred <lb/>
to him to give Roxana's smarter head a <lb/>
chance at it. He made up a supposititious <lb/>
case, and laid it before her. She thought it <lb/>
over, and delivered her verdict upon it. Tom <lb/>
said to himself, "She's hit it, sure!" He <lb/>
thought he would test that verdict, now, and <lb/>
watch Wilson's face; so he said reflectively&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f343" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0209"/>
<p>"Wilson, you're not a fool&mdash;a fact of <reg orig="re-|cent">recent</reg> <lb/>
discovery. Whatever your scheme was, <lb/>
it had sense in it, Blake's opinion to the <reg orig="con-|trary">contrary</reg> <lb/>
notwithstanding, I don't ask you to <lb/>
reveal it, but I will suppose a case&mdash;a case <lb/>
which will answer as a starting-point for the <lb/>
real thing I am going to come at, and that's <lb/>
all I want. You offered five hundred dollars <lb/>
for the knife, and five hundred for the thief. <lb/>
We will suppose, for argument's sake, that <lb/>
the first reward is <hi rend="italic">advertised</hi> and the <reg orig="sec-|ond">second</reg> <lb/>
<figure id="f344" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0209"/>
<pb n="205" entity="DSSR_000002495_0210"/>
offered by <hi rend="italic">private letter</hi> to pawnbrokers <lb/>
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>Blake slapped his thigh, and cried out&mdash;</p>
<p>"By Jackson, he's got you, Puddn'head! <lb/>
Now why could n't I or <hi rend="italic">any</hi> fool have thought <lb/>
of that?"</p>
<p>Wilson said to himself, "Anybody with a <lb/>
reasonably good head would have thought of <lb/>
it. I am not surprised that Blake did n't <reg orig="de-|tect">detect</reg> <lb/>
it; I am only surprised that Tom did. <lb/>
There is more to him than I supposed." He <lb/>
said nothing aloud, and Tom went on:</p>
<p>"Very well. The thief would not suspect <lb/>
that there was a trap, and he would bring or <lb/>
send the knife, and say he bought it for a <lb/>
song, or found it in the road, or something <lb/>
like that, and try to collect the reward, and <lb/>
be arrested&mdash;would n't he?"</p>
<figure id="f345" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0210"/>
<p>"Yes," said Wilson.</p>
<p>"I think so," said Tom. "There can't be <lb/>
any doubt of it. Have you ever seen that <lb/>
knife?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Has any friend of yours?"</p>
<p>"Not that I know of."</p>
<figure id="f346" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0210"/>
<pb n="206" entity="DSSR_000002495_0211"/>
<p>"Well, I begin to think I understand why <lb/>
your scheme failed."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Tom? What are <lb/>
you driving at?" asked Wilson, with a <reg orig="dawn-|ing">dawning</reg> <lb/>
sense of discomfort.</p>
<p>"Why, that there <hi rend="italic">is n't</hi> any such knife."</p>
<p>"Look here, Wilson," said Blake, "Tom <lb/>
Driscoll's right, for a thousand dollars&mdash;if I <lb/>
had it."</p>
<figure id="f347" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0211"/>
<p>Wilson's blood warmed a little, and he <reg orig="won-|dered">wondered</reg> <lb/>
if he had been played upon by those <lb/>
strangers; it certainly had something of that <lb/>
look. But what could they gain by it? He <lb/>
threw out that suggestion. Tom replied:</p>
<p>"Gain? Oh, nothing that you would <lb/>
value, maybe. But they are strangers making <lb/>
their way in a new community. Is it nothing <lb/>
to them to appear as pets of an Oriental <lb/>
prince&mdash;at no expense? Is it nothing to them <lb/>
to be able to dazzle this poor little town with <lb/>
thousand-dollar rewards&mdash;at no expense? <lb/>
Wilson, there is n't any such knife, or your <lb/>
scheme would have fetched it to light. Or if <lb/>
there is any such knife, they've got it yet. <lb/>
I believe, myself, that they've seen such a <lb/>
<pb n="207" entity="DSSR_000002495_0212"/>
knife, for Angelo pictured it out with his <lb/>
pencil too swiftly and handily for him to have <lb/>
been inventing it, and of course I can't swear <lb/>
that they've never had it; but this I'll go <lb/>
bail for&mdash;if they had it when they came to this <lb/>
town, they've got it yet."</p>
<figure id="f348" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0212"/>
<p>Blake said&mdash;</p>
<p>"It looks mighty reasonable, the way Tom <lb/>
puts it; it most certainly does."</p>
<p>Tom responded, turning to leave&mdash;</p>
<p>"You find the old woman, Blake, and if she <lb/>
can't furnish the knife, go and search the <lb/>
twins!"</p>
<p>Tom sauntered away. Wilson felt a good <lb/>
deal depressed. He hardly knew what to <lb/>
think. He was loth to withdraw his faith <lb/>
from the twins, and was resolved not to do it <lb/>
on the present indecisive evidence; but&mdash; <lb/>
well, he would think, and then decide how to <lb/>
act.</p>
<figure id="f349" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0212"/>
<p>"Blake, what do you think of this matter?"</p>
<p>"Well, Pudd'nhead, I'm bound to say I <lb/>
put it up the way Tom does. They had n't <lb/>
the knife; or if they had it, they've got it <lb/>
yet."</p>
<pb n="208" entity="DSSR_000002495_0213"/>
<p>The men parted. Wilson said to himself:</p>
<p>"I believe they had it; if it had been stolen, <lb/>
the scheme would have restored it, that is <reg orig="cer-|tain">certain</reg>. <lb/>
And so I believe they've got it yet."</p>
<figure id="f350" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0213"/>
<p>Tom had no purpose in his mind when he <lb/>
encountered those two men. When he began <lb/>
his talk he hoped to be able to gall them a <lb/>
little and get a trifle of malicious <reg orig="entertain-|ment">entertainment</reg> <lb/>
out of it. But when he left, he left in <lb/>
great spirits, for he perceived that just by pure <lb/>
luck and no troublesome labor he had <reg orig="accom-|plished">accomplished</reg> <lb/>
several delightful things: he had <lb/>
touched both men on a raw spot and seen <lb/>
them squirm; he had modified Wilson's <reg orig="sweet-|ness">sweetness</reg> <lb/>
for the twins with one small bitter taste <lb/>
that he would n't be able to get out of his <lb/>
mouth right away; and, best of all, he had <lb/>
taken the hated twins down a peg with the <lb/>
community; for Blake would gossip around <lb/>
freely, after the manner of detectives, and <lb/>
within a week the town would be laughing at <lb/>
them in its sleeve for offering a gaudy reward <lb/>
for a bauble which they either never possessed <lb/>
or had n't lost. Tom was very well satisfied <lb/>
with himself.</p>
<figure id="f351" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0213"/>
<figure id="f352" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0213"/>
<pb n="209" entity="DSSR_000002495_0214"/>
<p>Tom's behavior at home had been perfect <lb/>
during the entire week. His uncle and aunt <lb/>
had seen nothing like it before. They could <lb/>
find no fault with him anywhere.</p>
<p>Saturday evening he said to the Judge&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f353" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0214"/>
<p>"I've had something preying on my mind, <lb/>
uncle, and as I am going away, and might <lb/>
never see you again, I can't bear it any longer. <lb/>
I made you believe I was afraid to fight that <lb/>
Italian adventurer. I had to get out of it on <lb/>
some pretext or other, and maybe I chose <lb/>
badly, being taken unawares, but no <reg orig="honor-|able">honorable</reg> <lb/>
person could consent to meet him in the <lb/>
field, knowing what I knew about him."</p>
<p>"Indeed? What was that?"</p>
<p>"Cound Luigi is a confessed assassin."</p>
<p>"Incredible!"</p>
<p>"It is perfectly true. Wilson detected it in <lb/>
his hand, by palmistry, and charged him with <lb/>
it, and cornered him up so close that he had <lb/>
to confess; but both twins begged us on their <lb/>
kness to keep the secret, and swore they <lb/>
would lead straight lives here; and it was all <lb/>
so pitiful that we gave our word of honor <lb/>
never to expose them while they kept that <lb/>
<figure id="f354" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0214"/>
<pb n="210" entity="DSSR_000002495_0215"/>
promise. You would have done it yourself, <lb/>
uncle."</p>
<p>"You are right, my boy; I would. A <lb/>
man's secret is still his own property, and <lb/>
sacred, when it has been surprised out of him <lb/>
like that. You did well, and I am proud of <lb/>
you." Then he added mournfully, "But I <lb/>
wish I could have been saved the shame of <lb/>
meeting an assassin on the field of honor."</p>
<p>"It could n't be helped, uncle. If I had <lb/>
known you were going to challenge him I <lb/>
should have felt obliged to sacrifice my <lb/>
pledged word in order to stop it, but Wilson <lb/>
could n't be expected to do otherwise than <lb/>
keep silent."</p>
<p>"Oh no; Wilson did right, and is in no way <lb/>
to blame. Tom, Tom, you have lifted a <lb/>
heavy load from my heart; I was stung to the <lb/>
very soul when I seemed to have discovered <lb/>
that I had a coward in my family."</p>
<p>"You may imagine what it cost <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to <lb/>
assume such a part, uncle."</p>
<p>"Oh, I know it, poor boy, I know it. And <lb/>
I can understand how much it has cost you to <lb/>
remain under that unjust stigma to this time. <lb/>
<figure id="f355" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0215"/>
<pb n="211" entity="DSSR_000002495_0216"/>
But it is all right now, and no harm is done. <lb/>
You have restored my comfort of mind, and <lb/>
with it your own; and both of us had suffered <lb/>
enough."</p>
<figure id="f356" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0216"/>
<p>The old man sat awhile plunged in thought; <lb/>
then he looked up with a satisfied light in his <lb/>
eye, and said: "That this assassin should <lb/>
have put the affront upon me of letting me <lb/>
meet him on the field of honor as if he were a <lb/>
gentleman is a matter which I will presently <lb/>
settle&mdash;but not now. I will not shoot him <lb/>
until after election. I see a way to ruin them <lb/>
both before; I will attend to that first. <lb/>
Neither of them shall be elected, that I <reg orig="prom-|ise">promise</reg>. <lb/>
You are sure that the fact that he is <lb/>
an assassin has not got abroad?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly certain of it, sir."</p>
<p>"It will be a good card. I will fling a hint <lb/>
at it from the stump on the polling-day. It <lb/>
will sweep the ground from under both of <lb/>
them."</p>
<p>"There's not a doubt of it. It will finish <lb/>
them."</p>
<p>"That and outside work among the voters <lb/>
will, to a certainty. I want you to come <lb/>
<figure id="f357" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0216"/>
<pb n="212" entity="DSSR_000002495_0217"/>
down here by and by and work privately <lb/>
among the rag-tag and bobtail. You shall <lb/>
spend money among them; I will furnish it."</p>
<figure id="f358" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0217"/>
<p>Another point scored against the detested <lb/>
twins! Really it was a great day for Tom. <lb/>
He was encouraged to chance a parting shot, <lb/>
now, at the same target, and did it.</p>
<p>"You know that wounderful Indian knife <lb/>
that the twins have been making such a to-do <lb/>
about? Well, there's no track or trace of it <lb/>
yet; so the town is beginning to sneer and <lb/>
gossip and laugh. Half the people believe <lb/>
they never had any such knife, the other half <lb/>
believe they had it and have got it still. I've <lb/>
heard twenty people talking like that <reg orig="to-|day">today</reg>."</p>
<p>Yes, Tom's blemishless week had restored <lb/>
him to the favor of his aunt and uncle.</p>
<p>His mother was satisfied with him, too. <lb/>
Privately, she believed she was coming to love <lb/>
him, but she did not say so. She told him to <lb/>
go along to St. Louis, now, and she would <lb/>
get ready and follow. Then she smashed her <lb/>
whisky bottle and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Dah now! I's a-gwyne to make you <lb/>
<figure id="f359" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0217"/>

I's bown' you ain't gwyne to git no bad <lb/>

could n't go into no bad comp'ny. Well, you's <lb/>
gwyne into my comp'ny, en I's gwyne to fill <lb/>
de bill. Now, den, trot along, trot along!"</p>
<p>Tom went aboard one of the big transient <lb/>
boats that night with his heavy satchel of <reg orig="mis-|cellaneous">miscellaneous</reg> <lb/>
plunder, and slept the sleep of the <lb/>
unjust, which is serener and sounder than the <lb/>
other kind, as we know by the hanging-eve <lb/>
history of a million rascals. But when he got <lb/>
up in the morning, luck was against him <lb/>
again: A brother-thief had robbed him while <lb/>
he slept, and gone ashore at some intermediate <lb/>
landing.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> Roxana arrived, she found her son <lb/>
in such despair and misery that her heart was <lb/>
touched and her motherhood rose up strong <lb/>
in her. He was ruined past hope, now; his <lb/>
destruction would be immediate and sure, <lb/>
and he would be an outcast and friendless. <lb/>
That was reason enough for a mother to love <lb/>
a child; so she loved him, and told him so. <lb/>
It made him wince, secretly&mdash;for she was a <lb/>
"nigger." That he was one himself was far <lb/>
from reconciling him to that despised race.</p>
<figure id="f362" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0219"/>
<pb n="215" entity="DSSR_000002495_0220"/>
<p>Roxana poured out endearments upon him, <lb/>
to which he responded uncomfortably, but as <lb/>
well as he could. And she tried to comfort <lb/>
him, but that was not possible. These <reg orig="inti-|macies">intimacies</reg> <lb/>
quickly became horrible to him, and <lb/>
within the hour he began to try to get up <lb/>
courage enough to tell her so, and require <lb/>
that they be discontinued or very considerably <lb/>
modified. But he was afraid of her; and <reg orig="be-|sides">besides</reg>, <lb/>
there came a lull, now, for she had <reg orig="be-|gun">begun</reg> <lb/>
to think. She was trying to invent a <lb/>
saving plan. Finally she started up, and said <lb/>
she had found a way out. Tom was almost <lb/>
suffocated by the joy of this sudden good news. <lb/>
Roxana said:</p>
<figure id="f363" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0220"/>
<p>"Here is de plan, en she'll win, sure. I's a <lb/>
nigger, en nobody ain't gwyne to doubt it dat <lb/>
hears me talk. I's wuth six hund'd dollahs. <lb/>
Take en sell me, en pay of dese gamblers."</p>
<p>Tom was dazed. He was not sure he had <lb/>
heard aright. He was dumb for a moment; <lb/>
then he said:</p>
<p>"Do you mean that you would be sold into <lb/>
slavery to save me?"</p>
<p>"Ain't you my chile? En does you know <lb/>

you's gwyne to buy yo' ole mammy free ag'in. <lb/>

<p>Tom's hopes began to rise, and his spirits <lb/>
along with them. He said&mdash;</p>
<p>"It's lovely of you, mammy&mdash;it's just&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Say it ag'in! En keep on sayin'it? It's <lb/>

<p>"I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> say it again, mammy, and I'll keep on <lb/>

a bargain."</p>
<p>Tom forged a bill of sale and sold his <lb/>
mother to an Arkansas cotton-planter for a <lb/>
trifle over six hundred dollars. He did not <lb/>
want to commit this treachery, but luck <lb/>
threw the man in his way, and this saved <lb/>
him the necessity of going up country to <lb/>
hunt up a purchaser, with the added risk of <lb/>
having to answer a lot of questions, whereas <lb/>
this planter was so pleased with Roxy that <lb/>
he asked next to none at all. Besides, the <lb/>
planter insisted that Roxy would n't know <lb/>
where she was, at first, and that by the time <lb/>
she found out she would already have become <lb/>
contented. And Tom argued with himself <lb/>
that it was an immense advantage for Roxy <lb/>
to have a master who was so pleased with <lb/>
<figure id="f366" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0222"/>

<figure id="f368" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0223"/>
her, as this planter manifestly was. In <reg orig="al-|most">almost</reg> <lb/>
no time his flowing reasonings carried <lb/>
him to the point of even half believing he was <lb/>
doing Roxy a splendid surreptitious service <lb/>
in selling her "down the river." And then <lb/>
he kept diligently saying to himself all the <lb/>
time: "It's for only a year. In a year I <lb/>
buy her free again; she'll keep that in mind, <lb/>
and it'll reconcile her." Yes; the little <lb/>
deception could do no harm, and everything <lb/>
would come out right and pleasant in the <lb/>
end, any way. By agreement, the <reg orig="conversa-|tion">conversation</reg> <lb/>
in Roxy's presence was all about the <lb/>
man's "upcountry" farm, and how pleasant a <lb/>
place it was, and how happy the slaves were <lb/>
there; so poor Roxy was entirely deceived; <lb/>
and easily, for she was not dreaming that her <lb/>
own son could be guilty of treason to a <lb/>
mother who, in voluntarily going into <reg orig="slav-|ery&mdash;slavery">slavery&mdash;slavery</reg> <lb/>
of any kind, mild or severe, or <lb/>
of any duration, brief or long&mdash;was making a <lb/>
sacrifice for him compared with which death <lb/>
would have been a poor and commonplace <lb/>
one. She lavished tears and loving caresses <lb/>
upon him privately, and then went away with <lb/>
<figure id="f369" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0223"/>
<pb n="219" entity="DSSR_000002495_0224"/>
her owner&mdash;went away broken-hearted, and <lb/>
yet proud of what she was doing, and glad <lb/>
that it was in her power to do it.</p>
<p>Tom squared his accounts, and resolved to <lb/>
keep to the very letter of his reform, and <lb/>
never to put that will in jeopardy again. He <lb/>
had three hundred dollars left. According <lb/>
to his mother's plan, he was to put that <lb/>
safely away, and add her half of his pension to <lb/>
it monthly. In one year this fund would buy <lb/>
her free again.</p>
<p>For a whole week he was not able to sleep <lb/>
well, so much the villiany which he had <lb/>
played upon his trusting mother preyed upon <lb/>
his rag of a conscience; but after that he <lb/>
began to get comfortable again, and was <lb/>
presently able to sleep like any other <reg orig="mis-|creant">miscreant</reg>.</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> boat bore Roxy away from St. Louis <lb/>

up stream. She! Why, she had been <lb/>
steamboating for years. At dawn she got <lb/>
up and went listlessly and sat down on the <lb/>
cable-coil again. She passed many a snag <lb/>
whose "break" could have told her a thing <lb/>
to break her heart, for it showed a current <lb/>
moving in the same direction that the boat <lb/>
was going; but her thoughts were elsewhere, <lb/>
and she did not notice. But at last the roar <lb/>
of a bigger and nearer break than usual <lb/>
brought her out of her torpor, and she looked <lb/>
up, and her practised eye fell upon that <reg orig="tell-|tale">telltale</reg> <lb/>
rush of water. For one moment her <lb/>
petrified gaze fixed itself there. Then her <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> summer weeks dragged by, and then <lb/>
the political campaign opened&mdash;opened in <lb/>
pretty warm fashion, and waxed hotter and <lb/>
hotter daily. The twins threw themselves <lb/>
into it with their whole heart, for their <reg orig="self-|love">self-love</reg> <lb/>
was engaged. Their popularity, so <reg orig="gen-|eral">general</reg> <lb/>
at first, had suffered afterward; mainly <lb/>
because they had been <hi rend="italic">too</hi> popular, and so a <lb/>
natural reaction had followed. Besides, it <lb/>
had been diligently whispered around that it <lb/>
<pb n="222" entity="DSSR_000002495_0227"/>
was curious&mdash;indeed, <hi rend="italic">very</hi> curious&mdash;that that <lb/>
wonderful knife of theirs did not turn up&mdash;<hi rend="italic">if</hi> <lb/>
it was so valuable, or <hi rend="italic">if</hi> it had ever existed. <lb/>
And with the whisperings went chucklings <lb/>
and nudgings and winks, and such things <lb/>
have an effect. The twins considered that <lb/>
success in the election would reinstate them, <lb/>
and that defeat would work them irreparable <lb/>
damage. Therefore they worked hard, but <lb/>
not harder than Judge Driscoll and Tom <lb/>
worked against them in the closing days of <lb/>
the canvas. Tom's conduct had remained so <lb/>
letter-perfect during two whole months, now, <lb/>
that his uncle not only trusted him with <lb/>
money with which to persuade voters, but <lb/>
trusted him to go and get it himself out of <lb/>
the safe in the private sitting-room.</p>
<figure id="f373" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0227"/>
<p>The closing speech of the campaign was <lb/>
made by Judge Driscoll, and he made it <lb/>
against both of the foreigners. It was <reg orig="disas-|trously">disastrously</reg> <lb/>
effective. He poured out rivers of <lb/>
ridicule upon them, and forced the big <reg orig="mass-|meeting">mass-meeting</reg> <lb/>
to laugh and applaud. He scoffed <lb/>
at them as adventurers, mountebanks, <reg orig="side-|show">sideshow</reg> <lb/>
riff-raff, dime museum freaks; he <reg orig="as-|sailed">assailed</reg> <lb/>

their showy titles with measureless <lb/>
derision; he said they were back-alley <reg orig="bar-|bers">barbers</reg> <lb/>
disguised as nobilities, peanut pedlers <lb/>
masquerading as gentlemen, organ-grinders <lb/>
bereft of their brother monkey. At last he <reg orig="stop-|ped">stopped</reg> <lb/>
and stood still. He waited until the place <lb/>
had become absolutely silent and expectant, <lb/>
then he delivered his deadliest shot; <reg orig="de-|livered">delivered</reg> <lb/>
it with ice-cold seriousness and <reg orig="delib-|eration">deliberation</reg>, <lb/>
with a significant emphasis upon the <lb/>
closing words: he said he believed that the <lb/>
reward offered for the lost knife was humbug <lb/>
and buncombe, and that its owner would know <lb/>
where to find it whenever he should have <reg orig="oc-|casion">occasion</reg> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">to assassinate somebody.</hi></p>
<figure id="f375" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0228"/>
<p>Then he stepped from the stand, leaving a <lb/>
startled and impressive hush behind him <reg orig="in-|stead">instead</reg> <lb/>
of the customary explosion of cheers <lb/>
and party cries.</p>
<p>The strange remark flew far and wide over <lb/>
the town and made an extraordinary <reg orig="sensa-|tion">sensation</reg>. <lb/>
Everybody was asking, "What could <lb/>
he mean by that?" And everybody went on <lb/>
asking that question, but in vain; for the <lb/>
Judge only said he knew what he was talking <lb/>

about, and stopped there; Tom said he <lb/>
had n't any idea what his uncle meant, and <lb/>
Wilson, whenever he was asked what he <lb/>
thought it meant, parried the question by <lb/>
asking the questioner what <hi rend="italic">he</hi> thought it <lb/>
meant.</p>
<figure id="f377" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0229"/>
<p>Wilson was elected, the twins were <reg orig="de-|feated&mdash;crushed">defeated&mdash;crushed</reg>, <lb/>
in fact, and left forlorn and <lb/>
substantially friendless. Tom went back to <lb/>
St. Louis happy.</p>
<p>Dawson's Landing had a week of repose, <lb/>
now, and it needed it. But it was in an <reg orig="ex-|pectant">expectant</reg> <lb/>
state, for the air was full of rumors of <lb/>
a new duel. Judge Driscoll's election labors <lb/>
had prostrated him, but it was said that as <lb/>
soon as he was well enough to entertain a <lb/>
challenge he would get one from Count Luigi.</p>
<p>The brothers withdrew entirely from <reg orig="soci-|ety">society</reg>, <lb/>
and nursed their humiliation in privacy. <lb/>
They avoided the people, and went out for <lb/>
exercise only late at night, when the streets <lb/>
were deserted.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> friday after the election was a rainy <lb/>
one in St. Louis. It rained all day long, and <lb/>
rained hard, apparently trying its best to <lb/>
wash that soot-blackened town white, but of <lb/>
course not succeeding. Toward midnight <lb/>
Tom Driscoll arrived at his lodgings from the <lb/>
theatre in the heavy downpour, and closed <lb/>
his umberella and let himself in; but when he <lb/>
would have shut the door, he found that there <lb/>
was another person entering&mdash;doubtless <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg> <lb/>

and tramped up-stairs behind Tom. Tom <lb/>
found his door in the dark, and entered it and <lb/>
turned up the gas. When he faced about, <lb/>
lightly whistling, he saw the back of a man. <lb/>
The man was closing and locking his door <lb/>
for him. His whistle faded out and he felt <lb/>
uneasy. The man turned around, a wreck of <lb/>
shabby old clothes, sodden with rain and all <lb/>
a-drip, and showed a black face under an old <lb/>
slouch hat. Tom was frightened. He tried <lb/>
to order the man out, but the words refused <lb/>
to come, and the other man got the start. <lb/>
He said, in a low voice&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f382" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0231"/>
<p>"Keep still&mdash;I's yo' mother!"</p>
<p>Tom sunk in a heap on a chair, and gasped <lb/>
out&mdash;</p>
<p>"It was mean of me, and base&mdash;I know it; <lb/>
but I meant it for the best, I did indeed&mdash;I <lb/>
can swear it."</p>
<p>Roxana stood awhile looking mutely down <lb/>
on him while he writhed in shame and went on <lb/>
incoherently babbling self-accusations mixed <lb/>
with pitiful attempts at explanation and <reg orig="palli-|ation">palliation</reg> <lb/>
of his crime; then she seated herself <lb/>
and took off her hat, and her unkempt masses <lb/>

of long brown hair tumbled down about her <lb/>
shoulders.</p>
<p>"It ain't no fault o' yo'n dat dat ain't <lb/>
gray," she said sadly, noticing the hair.</p>
<p>"I know it, I know it! I'm a scoundrel. <lb/>
But I swear I meant it for the best. It was a <lb/>
mistake, of course, but I thought it was for <lb/>
the best, I truly did."</p>
<p>Roxy began to cry softly, and presently <lb/>
words began to find their way out between <lb/>
her sobs. They were uttered lamentingly, <lb/>
rather than angrily&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sell a pusson down de river&mdash;<hi rend="italic">down de</hi> <lb/>

Leastways, I's suffered so much dat mournin' <lb/>

<p>These words should have touched Tom <lb/>

and gave his crushed spirit a most grateful <reg orig="re-|bound">rebound</reg>, <lb/>
and filled all his small soul with a deep <lb/>
sense of relief. But he kept prudently still, <lb/>
and ventured no comment. There was a <lb/>
voiceless interval of some duration, now, in <lb/>
which no sounds were heard but the beating <lb/>
of the rain upon the panes, the sighing and <lb/>
complaining of the winds, and now and then <lb/>
a muffled sob from Roxana. The sobs <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
more and more infrequent, and at last <lb/>
ceased. Then the refugee began to talk <lb/>
again:</p>
<figure id="f386" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0233"/>
<p>"Shet down dat light a little. More. <lb/>

<p>Tom's heart was fired&mdash;with fury 'against <lb/>
the planter's wife; and he said to himself, "But <lb/>
for that meddlesome fool, everything would <lb/>
have gone all right." He added a deep and <lb/>
bitter curse against her.</p>
<p>The expression of this sentiment was fiercely <lb/>

for his mother's wrongs and of feeling <reg orig="re-|sentment">resentment</reg> <lb/>

which she had been doubting. But her flash <lb/>
of happiness was only a flash, and went out <lb/>
again and left her spirit dark; for she said to <lb/>
herself, "He sole me down de river&mdash;he can't <lb/>

<figure id="f401" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0240"/>
<pb n="236" entity="DSSR_000002495_0241"/>
he says that her coming here instead of flying <lb/>
to a free State looks bad for me, and that if I <lb/>
don't find her for him, and that pretty soon, <lb/>
he will make trouble for me. I never <reg orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg> <lb/>
that story; I could n't believe she <lb/>
would be so dead to all motherly instincts as <lb/>
to come here, knowing the risk she would <lb/>
run of getting me into irremediable trouble. <lb/>
And after all, here she is! And I stupidly <lb/>
swore I would help him find her, thinking it <lb/>
was a perfectly safe thing to promise. If I <lb/>
venture to deliver her up, she&mdash;she&mdash;but how <lb/>
can I help myself? I've got to do that or <lb/>
pay the money, and where's the money to <lb/>
come from? I&mdash;I&mdash;well, I should think that <lb/>
if he would swear to treat her kindly <reg orig="here-|after&mdash;and">hereafter&mdash;and</reg> <lb/>
she says, herself, that he is a good <lb/>
man&mdash;and if he would swear to never allow <lb/>
her to be overworked, or ill fed, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>A flash of lightning exposed Tom's pallid <lb/>
face, drawn and rigid with these worrying <lb/>
thoughts. Roxana spoke up sharply now, <lb/>
and there was apprehension in her voice&mdash;</p>
<p>"Turn up dat light! I want to see yo' <lb/>
face better. Dah now&mdash;lemme look at you.</p>
<figure id="f402" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0241"/>

<p>Chambers, you's as white as yo' shirt! Has <lb/>
you seen dat man? Has he be'n to see you?"</p>
<p>"Ye-s."</p>
<p>"When?"</p>
<p>"Monday noon."</p>
<p>"Monday noon! Was he on my track?"</p>
<p>"He&mdash;well, he thought he was. That is, <lb/>
he hoped he was. This is the bill you saw." <lb/>
He took it out of his pocket.</p>
<figure id="f403" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0242"/>
<p>"Read it to me!"</p>
<p>She was panting with excitement, and <lb/>
there was a dusky glow in her eyes that Tom <lb/>
could not translate with certainty, but there <lb/>
seemed to be something threatening about it. <lb/>
The handbill had the usual rude woodcut of a <lb/>
turbaned negro woman running, with the <reg orig="cus-|tomary">customary</reg> <lb/>
bundle on a stick overher shoulder, <lb/>
and the heading in bold type, "$100 <hi rend="small-caps">Re</hi>- <lb/>
<hi rend="small-caps">ward</hi>." Tom read the bill aloud&mdash;at least <lb/>
the part that described Roxana and named <lb/>
the master and his St. Louis address and the <lb/>
address of the Fourth-street agency; but he <lb/>
left out the item that applicants for the <reg orig="re-|ward">reward</reg> <lb/>
might also apply to Mr. Thomas <reg orig="Dris-|coll">Driscoll</reg>.</p>
<figure id="f404" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0242"/>
<pb n="238" entity="DSSR_000002495_0243"/>
<p>"Gimme de bill!"</p>
<p>Tom had folded it and was putting it in his <lb/>
pocket. He felt a chilly streak creeping <lb/>
down his back, but said as carelessly as he <lb/>
could&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f405" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0243"/>
<p>"The bill? Why, it isn't any use to you, <lb/>
you can't read it. What do you want with <lb/>
it?"</p>
<p>"Gimme de bill!" Tom gave it to her, <lb/>
but with a reluctance which he could not <reg orig="en-|tirely">entirely</reg> <lb/>
disguise. "Did you read it <hi rend="italic">all</hi> to me?"</p>
<p>"Certainly I did."</p>
<p>"Hole up yo' han' en swah to it."</p>
<p>Tom did it. Roxana put the bill carefully <lb/>
away in her pocket, with her eyes fixed upon <lb/>
Tom's face all the while; then she said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Yo's lyin!"</p>
<p>"What would I want to lie about it for?"</p>
<p>"I don't know&mdash;but you is. Dat's my <lb/>
opinion, anyways. But nemmine 'bout dat. <lb/>
When I seed dat man I'uz dat sk'yerd dat I <lb/>
could sca'cely wobble home. Den I give a <lb/>
nigger man a dollar for dese clo'es, en I ain't <lb/>
be'n in a house sence, night ner day, till now. <lb/>
I blacked my face en laid hid in de cellar of a <lb/>

people roun' sca'cely. But to-night I be'n <lb/>
a-stannin' in de dark alley ever sence night <lb/>
come, waitin' for you to go by. En here I is."</p>
<p>She fell to thinking. Presently she said&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f407" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0244"/>
<p>"You seed dat man at noon, las' <reg orig="Mon-|day">Monday</reg>?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I seed him de middle o' dat arternoon. <lb/>
He hunted you up, didn't he?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Did he give you de bill dat time?"</p>
<p>"No, he had n't got it printed yet."</p>
<p>Roxana darted a suspicious glance at him.</p>
<p>"Did you he'p him fix up de bill?"</p>
<p>Tom cursed himself for making that stupid <lb/>
blunder, and tried to rectify it by saying he <lb/>
remembered, now, that it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> at noon <reg orig="Mon-|day">Monday</reg> <lb/>
that the man gave him the bill. Roxana <lb/>
said&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f408" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0244"/>

<p>"You's lyin' ag'in, sho." Then she <reg orig="straight-|ened">straightened</reg> <lb/>
up and raised her finger:</p>
<p>"Now den! I's gwine to ask you a <reg orig="ques-|tion">question</reg>, <lb/>
en I wants to know how you's gwine to <lb/>
git aroun't it. You knowed he 'uz arter me; <lb/>
en if you run off, 'stid o' stayin' here to he'p <lb/>
him, he'd know dey 'uz somethin' wrong 'bout <lb/>
dis business, en den he would inquire 'bout <lb/>
you, en dat would take him to yo' uncle, en <lb/>
yo' uncle would read de bill en see dat you <lb/>

you know <hi rend="italic">him,</hi> I reckon! He'd t'ar up de <lb/>

you answer me dis question: hain't you tole <lb/>
dat man dat I would be sho' to come here, en <lb/>
den you would fix it so he could set a trap <lb/>
en ketch me?"</p>
<p>Tom recognized that neither lies nor <reg orig="argu-|ments">arguments</reg> <lb/>
could help him any longer&mdash;he was in a <lb/>
vise, with the screw turned on, and out of it <lb/>
there was no budging. His face began to <lb/>
take on an ugly look, and presently he said, <lb/>
with a snarl&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, what could I do? You see, <reg orig="your-|self">yourself</reg>, <lb/>
<figure id="f409" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0245"/>
<pb n="241" entity="DSSR_000002495_0246"/>
that I was in his grip and could n't get <lb/>
out."</p>
<p>Roxy scorched him with a scornful gaze <lb/>
awhile, then she said&mdash;</p>
<p>"What could you do? You could be <reg orig="Ju-|das">Judas</reg> <lb/>
to yo' own mother to save yo' wuthless <lb/>
hide! Would anybody b'lieve it? No&mdash;a <lb/>
dog could n't! You is de low-downest <reg orig="orneri-|est">orneriest</reg> <lb/>

en I's 'sponsible for it!"&mdash;and she spat on <lb/>
him.</p>
<figure id="f410" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0246"/>
<p>He made no effort to resent this. Roxy <reg orig="re-|flected">reflected</reg> <lb/>
a moment, then she said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Now I'll tell you what you's gwine to do. <lb/>
You's gwine to give dat man de money dat <lb/>
you's got laid up, en make him wait till you <lb/>
kin go to de Jedge en git de res' en buy me <lb/>
free agin."</p>
<p>"Thunder! what are you thinking of? Go <lb/>
and ask him for three hundred dollars and <lb/>
odd? What would I tell him I want with it, <lb/>
pray?"</p>
<p>Roxy's answer was delivered in a serene <lb/>
and level voice&mdash;</p>
<p>"You'll tell him you's sole me to pay yo' <lb/>
<figure id="f411" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0246"/>

gamblin' debts en dat you lied to me en was a <lb/>
villain, en dat I 'quires you to git dat money <lb/>
en buy me back ag'in."</p>
<p>"Why, you've gone stark mad! He would <lb/>
tear the will to shreds in a minute&mdash;don't you <lb/>
know that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I does."</p>
<figure id="f412" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0247"/>
<p>"Then you don't believe I'm idiot enough <lb/>
to go to him, do you?"</p>
<p>"I don't b'lieve nothin' 'bout it&mdash;I <hi rend="italic">knows</hi> <lb/>
you's a-goin'. I knows it 'ca'se you knows <lb/>
dat if you don't raise dat money I'll go to <lb/>
him myself, en den he'll sell <hi rend="italic">you</hi> down de <lb/>
river, en you kin see how you like it!"</p>
<p>Tom rose, trembling and excited, and there <lb/>
was an evil light in his eye. He strode to <lb/>
the door and said he must get out of this <lb/>
suffocating place for a moment and clear his <lb/>
brain in the fresh air so that he could <reg orig="deter-|mine">determine</reg> <lb/>
what to do. The door would n't open. <lb/>
Roxy smiled grimly, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"I's got de key, honey&mdash;set down. You <lb/>
needn't cle'r up yo' brain none to fine out what <lb/>
you gwine to do&mdash;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> knows what you's gwine <lb/>

<pb n="243" entity="DSSR_000002495_0248"/>
hands through his hair with a helpless and <lb/>
desperate air. Roxy said, "Is dat man in <lb/>
dis house?"</p>
<p>Tom glanced up with a surprised <reg orig="expres-|sion">expression</reg>, <lb/>
and asked&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f414" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0248"/>
<p>"What gave you such an idea?"</p>
<p>"You done it. Gwine out to cle'r yo' <lb/>

cle'r, en in de second place yo' ornery eye <lb/>
tole on you. You's de low-downest hound <lb/>
dat ever&mdash;but I done tole you dat befo'. <lb/>
Now den, dis is Friday. You kin fix it up <lb/>
wid dat man, en tell him you's gwine away to <lb/>
git de res' o' de money, en dat you'll be back <lb/>
wid it nex' Tuesday, or maybe Wednesday. <lb/>
You understan'?"</p>
<p>Tom answered sullenly&mdash;</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"En when you gits de new bill o' sale dat <lb/>
sells me to my own self, take en send it in de <lb/>
mail to Mr. Pudd'nhead Wilson, en write on <lb/>
de back dat he's to keep it tell I come. You <lb/>

<p>"Yes."</p>
<figure id="f415" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0248"/>
<pb n="244" entity="DSSR_000002495_0249"/>
<p>"Dat's all den. Take yo' umbreller, en <lb/>
put on yo' hat."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Beca'se you's gwine to see me home to <lb/>
de wharf. You see dis knife? I's toted it <lb/>
aroun' sence de day I seed dat man en bought <lb/>
dese clo'es en it. If he ketch me, I's gwine to <lb/>
kill myself wid it. Now start along, en go <lb/>
sof', en lead de way; en if you gives a sign in <lb/>
dis house, or if anybody comes up to you in <lb/>
de street, I's gwine to jam it right into you. <lb/>
Chambers, does you b'lieve me when I says <lb/>
dat?"</p>
<figure id="f416" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0249"/>
<p>"It's no use to bother me with that <reg orig="ques-|tion">question</reg>. <lb/>
I know your word's good."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's diff'rent from yo'n! Shet de <lb/>
light out en move along&mdash;here's de key."</p>
<p>They were not followed. Tom trembled <lb/>
every time a late straggler brushed by them <lb/>
on the street, and half expected to feel the <lb/>
cold steel in his back. Roxy was right at <lb/>
his heels and always in reach. After <reg orig="tramp-|ing">tramping</reg> <lb/>
a mile they reached a wide vacancy on <lb/>
the deserted wharves, and in this dark and <lb/>
rainy desert they parted.</p>

<p>As Tom trudged home his mind was full <lb/>
of dreary thoughts and wild plans; but at <lb/>

<p>"There is but the one way out. I must <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Dawson's Landing</hi> was comfortably <reg orig="finish-|ing">finishing</reg> <lb/>
its season of dull repose and waiting <reg orig="pa-|tiently">patiently</reg> <lb/>
for the duel. Count Luigi was waiting, <lb/>
too; but not patiently, rumor said. Sunday <lb/>
came, and Luigi insisted on having his <reg orig="chal-|lenge">challenge</reg> <lb/>
conveyed. Wilson carried it. Judge <lb/>
Driscoll declined to fight with an assassin&mdash; <lb/>
"that is," he added significantly, "in the field <lb/>
of honor."</p>
<p>Elsewhere, of course, he would be ready. <lb/>
Wilson tried to convince him that if he had <lb/>
been present himself when Angelo told about <lb/>
the homicide committed by Luigi, he would <lb/>
not have considered the act discreditable to <lb/>
<figure id="f420" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0251"/>
<pb n="247" entity="DSSR_000002495_0252"/>
Luigi; but the obstinate old man was not to <lb/>
be moved.</p>
<p>Wilson went back to his principal and <reg orig="re-|ported">reported</reg> <lb/>
the failure of his mission. Luigi was <lb/>
incensed, and asked how it could be that the <lb/>
old gentleman, who was by no means <reg orig="dull-|witted">dull-witted</reg>, <lb/>
held his trifling nephew's evidence and <lb/>
inferences to be of more value than Wilson's. <lb/>
But Wilson laughed, and said&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f421" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0252"/>
<p>"That is quite simple; that is easily <reg orig="expli-|cable">explicable</reg>. <lb/>
I am not his doll&mdash;his baby&mdash;his <reg orig="in-|fatuation">infatuation</reg>: <lb/>
his nephew is. The Judge and his <lb/>
late wife never had any children. The Judge <lb/>
and his wife were past middle age when this <lb/>
treasure fell into their lap. One must make <lb/>
allowances for a parental instinct that has <lb/>
been starving for twenty-five or thirty years. <lb/>
It is famished, it is crazed with hunger by <lb/>
that time, and will be entirely satisfied with <lb/>
anything that comes handy; its taste is <reg orig="atro-|phied">atrophied</reg>, <lb/>
it can't tell mud-cat from shad. A <lb/>
devil born to a young couple is measurably <lb/>
recognizable by them as a devil before long, <lb/>
but a devil adopted by an old couple is an <lb/>
angel to them, and remains so, through thick <lb/>
<figure id="f422" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0252"/>
<pb n="248" entity="DSSR_000002495_0253"/>
and thin. Tom is this old man's angel; he is <lb/>
infatuated with him. Tom can persuade him <lb/>
into things which other people can't&mdash;not all <lb/>
things; I don't mean that, but a good many&mdash; <lb/>
particularly one class of things: the things <lb/>
that create or abolish personal partialities or <lb/>
prejudices in the old man's mind. The old <lb/>
man liked both of you. Tom conceived a <lb/>
hatred for you. That was enough; it turned <lb/>
the old man around at once. The oldest and <lb/>
strongest friendship must go to the ground <lb/>
when one of these late-adopted darlings <lb/>
throws a brick at it."</p>
<figure id="f423" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0253"/>
<p>"It's a curious philosophy," said Luigi.</p>
<p>"It ain't a philosophy at all&mdash;it's a fact. <lb/>
And there is something pathetic and <reg orig="beauti-|ful">beautiful</reg> <lb/>
about it, too. I think there is nothing <lb/>
more pathetic than to see one of these poor <lb/>
old childless couples taking a menagerie of <lb/>
yelping little worthless dogs to their hearts; <lb/>
and then adding some cursing and squawking <lb/>
parrots and a jackass-voiced macaw; and <lb/>
next a couple of hundred screeching <reg orig="song-|birds">songbirds</reg>, <lb/>
and presently some fetid guinea-pigs <lb/>
and rabbits, and a howling colony of cats. It <lb/>

<pb n="249" entity="DSSR_000002495_0254"/>
is all a groping and ignorant effort to <reg orig="con-|struct">construct</reg> <lb/>
out of base metal and brass filings, so <lb/>
to speak, something to take the place of that <lb/>
golden treasure denied them by Nature, a <lb/>
child. But this is a digression. The <reg orig="un-|written">unwritten</reg> <lb/>
law of this region requires you to kill <lb/>
Judge Driscoll on sight, and he and the <reg orig="com-|munity">community</reg> <lb/>
will expect that attention at your <lb/>
hands&mdash;though of course your own death by <lb/>
his bullet will answer every purpose. Look <lb/>
out for him! Are you heeled&mdash;that is, fixed?"</p>
<p>"Yes; he shall have his opportunity. If <lb/>
he attacks me I will respond."</p>
<p>As Wilson was leaving, he said&mdash;</p>
<p>"The Judge is still a little used up by his <lb/>
campaign work, and will not get out for a <lb/>
day or so; but when he does get out, you <lb/>
want to be on the alert."</p>
<p>About eleven at night the twins went out <lb/>
for exercise, and started on a long stroll in <lb/>
the veiled moonlight.</p>
<figure id="f425" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0254"/>
<p>Tom Driscoll had landed at Hackett's <lb/>
Store, two miles below Dawson's, just about <lb/>
half an hour earlier, the only passenger for <lb/>
that lonely spot, and had walked up the shore <lb/>
<figure id="f426" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0254"/>
<pb n="250" entity="DSSR_000002495_0255"/>
road and entered Judge Driscoll's house <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
having encountered any one either on the <lb/>
road or under the roof.</p>
<figure id="f427" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0255"/>
<p>He pulled down his window-blinds and <lb/>
lighted his candle. He laid off his coat and <lb/>
hat and began his preparations. He <reg orig="un-|locked">unlocked</reg> <lb/>
his trunk and got his suit of girl's <lb/>
clothes out from under the male attire in it, <lb/>
and laid it by. Then he blacked his face <lb/>
with burnt cork and put the cork in his <lb/>
pocket. His plan was, to slip down to his <reg orig="un-|cle's">uncle's</reg> <lb/>
private sitting-room below, pass into the <lb/>
bedroom, steal the safe-key from the old <lb/>
gentleman's clothes, and then go back and <lb/>
rob the safe. He took up his candle to start. <lb/>
His courage and confidence were high, up to <lb/>
this point, but both began to waver a little, <lb/>
now. Suppose he should make a noise, by <lb/>
some accident, and get caught&mdash;say, in the <lb/>
act of opening the safe? Perhaps it would <lb/>
be well to go armed. He took the Indian <lb/>
knife from its hiding-place, and felt a <lb/>
pleasant return of his wandering courage. <lb/>
He slipped stealthily down the narrow stair, <lb/>
his hair rising and his pulses halting at the <lb/>
<figure id="f428" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0255"/>
<pb n="251" entity="DSSR_000002495_0256"/>
slightest creak. When he was half-way down, <lb/>
he was disturbed to perceive that the landing <lb/>
below was touched by a faint glow of light. <lb/>
What could that mean? Was his uncle still <lb/>
up? No, that was not likely; he must have <lb/>
left his night-taper there when he went to <lb/>
bed. Tom crept on down, pausing at every <lb/>
step to listen. He found the door standing <lb/>
open, and glanced in. What he saw pleased <lb/>
him beyond measure. His uncle was asleep <lb/>
on the sofa; on a small table at the head of <lb/>
the sofa a lamp was burning low, and by it <lb/>
stood the old man's small tin cash-box, closed. <lb/>
Near the box was a pile of bank-notes and a <lb/>
piece of paper covered with figures in pencil. <lb/>
The safe-door was not open. Evidently the <lb/>
sleeper had wearied himself with work upon <lb/>
his finances, and was taking a rest.</p>
<p>Tom set his candle on the stairs, and <reg orig="be-|gan">began</reg> <lb/>
to make his way toward the pile of notes, <lb/>
stooping low as he went. When he was <reg orig="pass-|ing">passing</reg> <lb/>
his uncle, the old man stirred in his sleep, <lb/>
and Tom stopped instantly&mdash;stopped, and <lb/>
softly drew the knife from its sheath, with his <lb/>
heart thumping, and his eyes fastened upon <lb/>
<figure id="f429" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0256"/>
<pb n="252" entity="DSSR_000002495_0257"/>
his benefactor's face. After a moment or two <lb/>
he ventured forward again&mdash;one step&mdash; <lb/>
reached for his prize and seized it, dropping <lb/>
the knife-sheath. Then he felt the old man's <lb/>
strong grip upon him, and a wild cry of <lb/>
"Help! help!" rang in his ear. Without <lb/>
hesitation he drove the knife home&mdash;and was <lb/>
free. Some of the notes escaped from his <lb/>
left hand and fell in the blood on the floor. <lb/>
He dropped the knife and snatched them up <lb/>
and started to fly; transferred them to his <lb/>
left hand, and seized the knife again, in his <lb/>
fright and confusion, but remembered himself <lb/>
and flung it from him, as being a dangerous <lb/>
witness to carry away with him.</p>
<figure id="f430" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0257"/>
<p>He jumped for the stair-foot, and closed <lb/>
the door behind him; and as he snatched his <lb/>
candle and fled upward, the stillness of the <lb/>
night was broken by the sound of urgent <reg orig="foot-|steps">footsteps</reg> <lb/>
approaching the house. In another <lb/>
moment he was in his room and the twins <lb/>
were standing aghast over the body of the <lb/>
murdered man!</p>
<figure id="f431" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0257"/>
<p>Tom put on his coat, buttoned his hat <reg orig="un-|der">under</reg> <lb/>
it, threw on his suit of girl's clothes, <lb/>
<pb n="253" entity="DSSR_000002495_0258"/>
dropped the veil, blew out his light, locked <lb/>
the room door by which he had just entered, <lb/>
taking the key, passed through his other door <lb/>
into the back hall, locked that door and kept <lb/>
the key, then worked his way along in the <lb/>
dark and descended the back stairs. He was <lb/>
not expecting to meet anybody, for all <reg orig="inter-|est">interest</reg> <lb/>
was centered in the other part of the <lb/>
house, now; his calculation proved correct. <lb/>
By the time he was passing through the <reg orig="back-|yard">backyard</reg>, <lb/>
Mrs. Pratt, her servants, and a dozen <lb/>
half-dressed neighbors had joined the twins <lb/>
and the dead, and accessions were still <reg orig="arriv-|ing">arriving</reg> <lb/>
at the front door.</p>
<figure id="f432" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0258"/>
<p>As Tom, quaking as with a palsy, passed out <lb/>
at the gate, three women came flying from <lb/>
the house on the opposite side of the lane. <lb/>
They rushed by him and in at the gate, <reg orig="ask-|ing">asking</reg> <lb/>
him what the trouble was there, but not <lb/>
waiting for an answer. Tom said to himself, <lb/>
"Those old maids waited to dress&mdash;they did <lb/>
the same thing the night Stevens's house <lb/>
burned down next door." In a few minutes <lb/>
he was in the haunted house. He lighted a <lb/>
candle and took off his girl-clothes. There <lb/>
<figure id="f433" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0258"/>
<pb n="254" entity="DSSR_000002495_0259"/>
was blood on him all down his left side, and <lb/>
his right hand was red with the stains of the <lb/>
blood-soaked notes which he had crushed in <lb/>
it; but otherwise he was free from this sort <lb/>
of evidence. He cleansed his hand on the <lb/>
straw, and cleaned most of the smut from his <lb/>
face. Then he burned his male and female <lb/>
attire to ashes, scattered the ashes, and put <lb/>
on a disguise proper for a tramp. He blew <lb/>
out his light, went below, and was soon <reg orig="loaf-|ing">loafing</reg> <lb/>
down the river road with the intent to <lb/>
borrow and use one of Roxy's devices. He <lb/>
found a canoe and paddled off down-stream, <lb/>
setting the canoe adrift as dawn approached, <lb/>
and making his way by land to the next <reg orig="vil-|lage">village</reg>, <lb/>
where he kept out of sight till a <reg orig="tran-|sient">transient</reg> <lb/>
steamer came along, and then took deck <lb/>
passage for St.Louis. He was ill at ease <reg orig="un-|til">until</reg> <lb/>
Dawson's Landing was behind him; then <lb/>
he said to himself, "All the detectives on <lb/>
earth could n't trace me now; there's not a <lb/>
vestige of a clue left in the world; that <reg orig="homi-|cide">homicide</reg> <lb/>
will take its place with the permanent <lb/>
mysteries, and people won't get done trying <lb/>
to guess out the secret of it for fifty years."</p>
<figure id="f434" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0259"/>
<figure id="f435" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0259"/>
<pb n="255" entity="DSSR_000002495_0260"/>
<p>In St.Louis, next morning, he read this <lb/>
brief telegram in the papers&mdash;dated at <reg orig="Daw-|son's">Dawson's</reg> <lb/>
Landing: <lb/>
<q>Judge Driscoll, an old and respected citizen, was <reg orig="as-|sassinated">assassinated</reg> <lb/>
here about midnight by a profligate Italian <reg orig="no-|bleman">nobleman</reg> <lb/>
or barber on account of a quarrel growing out of <lb/>
the recent election. The assassin will probably be <lb/>
lynched.</q></p>
<figure id="f436" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0260"/>
<p>"One of the twins!" soliloquized Tom; <lb/>
"how lucky! It is the knife that has done <lb/>
him this grace. We never know when <reg orig="for-|tune">fortune</reg> <lb/>
is trying to favor us. I actually cursed <lb/>
Pudd'nhead Wilson in my heart for putting it <lb/>
out of my power to sell that knife. I take it <lb/>
back, now."</p>
<p>Tom was now rich and independent. He <lb/>
arranged with the planter, and mailed to <reg orig="Wil-|son">Wilson</reg> <lb/>
the new bill of sale which sold Roxana to <lb/>
herself; then he telegraphed his Aunt Pratt: <lb/>
<q>Have seen the awful news in the papers and am almost <lb/>
prostrated with grief. Shall start by packet to-day. Try <lb/>
to bear up till I come.</q></p>
<p>When Wilson reached the house of <reg orig="mourn-|ing">mourning</reg> <lb/>
and had gathered such details as Mrs. <lb/>
Pratt and the rest of the crowd could tell him, <lb/>
<figure id="f437" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0260"/>
<pb n="256" entity="DSSR_000002495_0261"/>
he took command as mayor, and gave orders <lb/>
that nothing should be touched, but <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
left as it was until Justice Robinson <lb/>
should arrive and take the proper measures as <lb/>
coroner. He cleared everybody out of the <lb/>
room but the twins and himself. The sheriff <lb/>
soon arrived and took the twins away to jail. <lb/>
Wilson told them to keep heart, and promised <lb/>
to do his best in their defense when the case <lb/>
should come to trial. Justice Robinson came <lb/>
presently, and with him Constable Blake. <lb/>
They examined the room thoroughly. They <lb/>
found the knife and the sheath. Wilson <lb/>
noticed that there were finger-prints on the <lb/>
knife-handle. That pleased him, for the twins <lb/>
had required the earliest comers to make a <lb/>
scrutiny of their hands and clothes, and <reg orig="nei-|ther">neither</reg> <lb/>
these people nor Wilson himself had <lb/>
found any blood-stains upon them. Could <lb/>
there be a possibility that the twins had spoken <lb/>
the truth when they said they found the man <lb/>
dead when they ran into the house in answer <lb/>
to the cry for help? He thought of that <reg orig="mys-|terious">mysterious</reg> <lb/>
girl at once. But this was not the <lb/>
sort of work for a girl to be engaged in. No <lb/>
<figure id="f438" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0261"/>
<figure id="f439" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0261"/>
<pb n="257" entity="DSSR_000002495_0262"/>
matter; Tom Driscoll's room must be <reg orig="exam-|ined">examined</reg>.</p>
<p>After the coroner's jury had viewed the <lb/>
body and its surroundings, Wilson suggested <lb/>
a search up-stairs, and he went along. The <lb/>
jury forced an entrance to Tom's room, but <lb/>
found nothing, of course.</p>
<p>The coroner's jury found that the homicide <lb/>
was committed by Luigi, and that Angelo was <lb/>
accessory to it.</p>
<figure id="f440" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0262"/>
<p>The town was bitter against the <reg orig="unfortu-|nates">unfortunates</reg>, <lb/>
and for the first few days after the <lb/>
murder they were in constant danger of being <lb/>
lynched. The grand jury presently indicted <lb/>
Luigi for murder in the first degree, and <reg orig="An-|gelo">Angelo</reg> <lb/>
as accessory before the fact. The twins <lb/>
were transferred from the city jail to the <lb/>
county prison to await trial.</p>
<p>Wilson examined the finger-marks on the <lb/>
knife-handle and said to himself, "Neither of <lb/>
the twins made those marks." Then manifestly <lb/>
there was another person concerned, either in <lb/>
his own interest or as hired assassin.</p>
<p>But who could it be? That, he must try <lb/>
to find out. The safe was not open, the <lb/>
<figure id="f441" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0262"/>
<pb n="258" entity="DSSR_000002495_0263"/>
cash-box was closed, and had three thousand <lb/>
dollars in it. Then robbery was not the <lb/>
motive, and revenge was. Where had the <lb/>
murdered man an enemy except Luigi? <lb/>
There was but that one person in the world <lb/>
with a deep grudge against him.</p>
<p>The mysterious girl! The girl was a great <lb/>
trial to Wilson. If the motive had been <reg orig="rob-|bery">robbery</reg>, <lb/>
the girl might answer; but there was n't <lb/>
any girl that would want to take this old <lb/>
man's life for revenge. He had no quarrels <lb/>
with girls; he was a gentleman.</p>
<p>Wilson had perfect tracings of the <reg orig="finger-|marks">fingermarks</reg> <lb/>
of the knife-handle; and among his <lb/>
glass-records he had a great array of the <reg orig="fin-|ger-prints">finger-prints</reg> <lb/>
of women and girls, collected during <lb/>
the last fifteen or eighteen years, but he <lb/>
scanned them in vain, they successfully <reg orig="with-|stood">withstood</reg> <lb/>
every test; among them were no <reg orig="dupli-|cates">duplicates</reg> <lb/>
of the prints on the knife.</p>
<p>The presence of the knife on the stage of <lb/>
the murder was a worrying circumstance for <lb/>
Wilson. A week previously he had as good <lb/>
as admitted to himself that he believed Luigi <lb/>
had possessed such a knife, and that he still <lb/>
<figure id="f442" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0263"/>
<pb n="259" entity="DSSR_000002495_0264"/>
possessed it notwithstanding his pretense that <lb/>
it had been stolen. And now here was the <lb/>
knife, and with it the twins. Half the town <lb/>
had said the twins were humbugging when <lb/>
they claimed that they had lost their knife, <lb/>
and now these people were joyful, and said, <lb/>
"I told you so!"</p>
<p>If their finger-prints had been on the <reg orig="han-|dle&mdash;but">handle&mdash;but</reg> <lb/>
it was useless to bother any further <lb/>
about that; the finger-prints on the handle <lb/>
were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> theirs&mdash;that he knew perfectly.</p>
<p>Wilson refused to suspect Tom; for first, <lb/>
Tom could n't murder anybody&mdash;he had n't <lb/>
character enough; secondly, if he could <reg orig="mur-|der">murder</reg> <lb/>
a person he would n't select his doting <lb/>
benefactor and nearest relative; thirdly, <reg orig="self-|interest">self-interest</reg> <lb/>
was in the way; for while the uncle <lb/>
lived, Tom was sure of a free support and a <lb/>
chance to get the destroyed will revived again, <lb/>
but with the uncle gone, that chance was gone, <lb/>
too. It was true the will had really been <reg orig="re-|vived">revived</reg>, <lb/>
as was now discovered, but Tom could <lb/>
not have been aware of it, or he would have <lb/>
spoken of it, in his native talky, unsecretive <lb/>
way. Finally, Tom was in St. Louis when <lb/>
<figure id="f443" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0264"/>
<pb n="260" entity="DSSR_000002495_0265"/>
the murder was done, and got the news out of <lb/>
the morning journals, as was shown by his <lb/>
telegram to his aunt. These speculations <lb/>
were unemphasized sensations rather than <lb/>
articulated thoughts, for Wilson would have <lb/>
laughed at the idea of seriously connecting <lb/>
Tom with the murder.</p>
<p>Wilson regarded the case of the twins as <lb/>
desperate&mdash;in fact, about hopeless. For he <lb/>
argued that if a confederate was not found, an <lb/>
enlightened Missouri jury would hang them, <lb/>
sure; if a confederate was found, that would <lb/>
not improve the matter, but simply furnish one <lb/>
more person for the sheriff to hang. <reg orig="Noth-|ing">Nothing</reg> <lb/>
could save the twins but the discovery of <lb/>
a person who did the murder on his sole <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg> <lb/>
account&mdash;an undertaking which had all <lb/>
the aspect of the impossible. Still, the person <lb/>
who made the finger-prints must be sought. <lb/>
The twins might have no case <hi rend="italic">with</hi> him, but <lb/>
they certainly would have none without him.</p>
<p>So Wilson mooned around, thinking, <reg orig="think-|ing">thinking</reg>, <lb/>
guessing, guessing, day and night, and <lb/>
arriving nowhere. Whenever he ran across a <lb/>
girl or a woman he was not acquainted with, <lb/>
<figure id="f444" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0265"/>
<pb n="261" entity="DSSR_000002495_0266"/>
he got her finger-prints, on one pretext or <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg>; <lb/>
and they always cost him a sigh when <lb/>
he got home, for they never tallied with the <lb/>
finger-marks on the knife-handle.</p>
<figure id="f445" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0266"/>
<p>As to the mysterious girl, Tom swore he <lb/>
knew no such girl, and did not remember ever <lb/>
seeing a girl wearing a dress like the one <reg orig="de-|scribed">described</reg> <lb/>
by Wilson. He admitted that he did <lb/>
not always lock his room, and that sometimes <lb/>
the servants forgot to lock the house doors; <lb/>
still, in his opinion the girl must have made <lb/>
but few visits or she would have been <reg orig="discov-|ered">discovered</reg>. <lb/>
When Wilson tried to connect her with <lb/>
the stealing-raid, and thought she might have <lb/>
been the old woman's confederate, if not the <lb/>
very thief herself disguised as an old woman, <lb/>
Tom seemed struck, and also much interested, <lb/>
and said he would keep a sharp eye out for <lb/>
this person or persons, although he was afraid <lb/>
that she or they would be too smart to venture <lb/>
again into a town where everybody would now <lb/>
be on the watch for a good while to come.</p>
<p>Everybody was pitying Tom, he looked so <lb/>
quiet and sorrowful, and seemed to feel his <lb/>
great loss so deeply. He was playing a part, <lb/>
<pb n="262" entity="DSSR_000002495_0267"/>
but it was not all a part. The picture of his <lb/>
alleged uncle, as he had last seen him, was <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
him in the dark pretty frequently, when <lb/>
he was awake, and called again in his dreams, <lb/>
when he was asleep. He would n't go into <lb/>
the room where the tragedy had happened. <lb/>
This charmed the doting Mrs. Pratt, who <lb/>
realized now, "as she had never done before," <lb/>
she said, what a sensitive and delicate nature <lb/>
her darling had, and how he adored his poor <lb/>
uncle.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> weeks dragged along, no friend <reg orig="visit-|ing">visiting</reg> <lb/>
the jailed twins but their counsel and <lb/>
Aunt Patsy Cooper, and the day of trial came <lb/>
at last&mdash;the heaviest day in Wilson's life; for <lb/>
with all his tireless diligence he had <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg> <lb/>
no sign or trace of the missing <reg orig="con-|federate">confederate</reg>. <lb/>
"Confederate" was the term he <lb/>
had long ago privately accepted for that <reg orig="per-|son&mdash;not">person&mdash;not</reg> <lb/>
as being unquestionably the right <lb/>
term, but as being at least possibly the right <lb/>
one, though he was never able to understand <lb/>

the confederate had done, instead of <reg orig="remain-|ing">remaining</reg> <lb/>
by the murdered man and getting caught <lb/>
there.</p>
<p>The court-house was crowded, of course, <lb/>
and would remain so to the finish, for not <lb/>
only in the town itself, but in the country for <lb/>
miles around, the trial was the one topic of <lb/>
conversation among the people. Mrs. Pratt, <lb/>
in deep mourning, and Tom with a weed on <lb/>
his hat, had seats near Pembroke Howard, <lb/>
the public prosecutor, and back of them sat a <lb/>
great array of friends of the family. The <lb/>
twins had but one friend present to keep <lb/>
their counsel in countenance, their poor <lb/>
old sorrowing landlady. She sat near <reg orig="Wil-|son">Wilson</reg>, <lb/>
and looked her friendliest. In the <lb/>
"nigger corner" sat Chambers; also Roxy, <lb/>
with good clothes on, and her bill of sale <lb/>
in her pocket. It was her most precious <lb/>
possession, and she never parted with it, day <lb/>
or night. Tom had allowed her thirty-five <lb/>
dollars a month ever since he came into his <lb/>
property, and had said that he and she ought <lb/>
to be grateful to the twins for making them <lb/>
rich; but had roused such a temper in her by <lb/>
<figure id="f449" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0269"/>
<figure id="f450" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0269"/>
<pb n="265" entity="DSSR_000002495_0270"/>
this speech that he did not repeat the <reg orig="argu-|ment">argument</reg> <lb/>
afterward. She said the old Judge had <lb/>
treated her child a thousand times better than <lb/>
he deserved, and had never done her an <reg orig="un-|kindness">unkindness</reg> <lb/>
in his life; so she hated these <reg orig="out-|landish">outlandish</reg> <lb/>
devils for killing him, and should n't <lb/>
ever sleep satisfied till she saw them hanged <lb/>
for it. She was here to watch the trial, now, <lb/>
and was going to lift up just one "hooraw" <lb/>
over it if the County Judge put her in jail a <lb/>
year for it. She gave her turbanced head a <lb/>
toss and said, "When dat verdic' comes, I's <lb/>

<figure id="f451" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0270"/>
<p>Pembroke Howard briefly sketched the <lb/>
State's case. He said he would show by a <lb/>
chain of circumstantial evidence without break <lb/>
or fault in it anywhere, that the principal <lb/>
prisoner at the bar committed the murder; <lb/>
that the motive was partly revenge, and partly <lb/>
a desire to take his own life out of jeopardy, <lb/>
and that his brother, by his presence, was a <lb/>
consenting accessory to the crime; a crime <lb/>
which was the basest known to the calendar <lb/>
of human misdeeds&mdash;assassination; that it <lb/>
was conceived by the blackest of hearts and <lb/>
<figure id="f452" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0270"/>
<pb n="266" entity="DSSR_000002495_0271"/>
consummated by the cowardliest of hands; a <lb/>
crime which had broken a loving sister's heart, <lb/>
blighted the happiness of a young nephew <lb/>
who was as dear as a son, brought <reg orig="inconsola-|ble">inconsolable</reg> <lb/>
grief to many friends, and sorrow and loss <lb/>
to the whole community. The utmost penalty <lb/>
of the outraged law would be exacted, and <lb/>
upon the accused, now present at the bar, <lb/>
that penalty would unquestionably be <reg orig="exe-|cuted">executed</reg>. <lb/>
He would reserve further remark <reg orig="un-|til">until</reg> <lb/>
his closing speech.</p>
<figure id="f453" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0271"/>
<p>He was strongly moved, and so also was <lb/>
the whole house; Mrs. Pratt and several other <lb/>
women were weeping when he sat down, and <lb/>
many an eye that was full of hate was riveted <lb/>
upon the unhappy prisoners.</p>
<p>Witness after witness was called by the <lb/>
State, and questioned at length; but the <reg orig="cross-|questioning">cross-questioning</reg> <lb/>
was brief. Wilson knew they <lb/>
could furnish nothing valuable for his side. <lb/>
People were sorry for Pudd'nhead; his <reg orig="bud-|ding">budding</reg> <lb/>
career would get hurt by this trial.</p>
<p>Several witnesses swore they heard Judge <lb/>
Driscoll say in his public speech that the <lb/>
twins would be able to find their lost knife <lb/>
<figure id="f454" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0271"/>
<pb n="267" entity="DSSR_000002495_0272"/>
again when they needed it to assassinate <lb/>
somebody with. This was not news, but now <lb/>
it was seen to have been sorrowfully <reg orig="pro-|phetic">prophetic</reg>, <lb/>
and a profound sensation quivered <lb/>
through the hushed court-room when those <lb/>
dismal words were repeated.</p>
<p>The public prosecutor rose and said that it <lb/>
was within his knowledge, through a <reg orig="conver-|sation">conversation</reg> <lb/>
held with Judge Driscoll on the last day <lb/>
of his life, that counsel for the defense had <lb/>
brought him a challenge from the person <lb/>
charged at this bar with murder; that he had <lb/>
refused to fight with a confessed assassin&mdash; <lb/>
"that is, on the field of honor," but had added <lb/>
significantly, that he would be ready for <lb/>
him elsewhere. Presumably the person here <lb/>
charged with murder was warned that he must <lb/>
kill or be killed the first time he should meet <lb/>
Judge Driscoll. If counsel for the defense <lb/>
chose to let the statement stand so, he would <lb/>
not call him to the witness stand. Mr. Wilson <lb/>
said he would offer no denial. [Murmurs in <lb/>
the house&mdash;"It is getting worse and worse <lb/>
for Wilson's case."]</p>
<p>Mrs. Pratt testified that she heard no <reg orig="out-|cry">outcry</reg>, <lb/>

and did not know what woke her up, <lb/>
unless it was the sound of rapid footsteps <lb/>
approaching the front door. She jumped up <lb/>
and ran out in the hall just as she was, and <lb/>
heard the footsteps flying up the front steps <lb/>
and then following behind her as she ran to <lb/>
the sitting-room. There she found the <reg orig="ac-|cused">accused</reg> <lb/>
standing over her murdered brother. <lb/>
[Here she broke down and sobbed. <reg orig="Sensa-|tion">Sensation</reg> <lb/>
in the court.] Resuming, she said the <lb/>
persons entering behind her were Mr. Rogers <lb/>
and Mr. Buckstone.</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Wilson, she said the <lb/>
twins proclaimed their innocence; declared <lb/>
that they had been taking a walk, and had <lb/>
hurried to the house in response to a cry for <lb/>
help which was so loud and strong that they <lb/>
had heard it at a considerable distance; that <lb/>
they begged her and the gentlemen just <reg orig="men-|tioned">mentioned</reg> <lb/>
to examine their hands and clothes&mdash; <lb/>
which was done, and no blood stains found.</p>
<p>Confirmatory evidence followed from <reg orig="Rog-|ers">Rogers</reg> <lb/>
and Buckstone.</p>
<p>The finding of the knife was verified, the <lb/>
advertisement minutely describing it and <reg orig="offer-|ing">offering</reg> <lb/>

a reward for it was put in evidence, and <lb/>
its exact correspondence with that description <lb/>
proved. Then followed a few minor details, <lb/>
and the case for the State was closed.</p>
<p>Wilson said that he had three witnesses, the <lb/>
Misses Clarkson, who would testify that they <lb/>
met a veiled young woman leaving Judge <lb/>
Driscoll's premises by the back gate a few <lb/>
minutes after the cries for help were heard, <lb/>
and that their evidence, taken with certain <reg orig="cir-|cumstantial">circumstantial</reg> <lb/>
evidence which he would call the <lb/>
court's attention to, would in his opinion <reg orig="con-|vince">convince</reg> <lb/>
the court that there was still one person <lb/>
concerned in this crime who had not yet been <lb/>
found, and also that a stay of proceedings <lb/>
ought to be granted, in justice to his clients, <lb/>
until that person should be discovered. As <lb/>
it was late, he would ask leave to defer the <reg orig="ex-|amination">examination</reg> <lb/>
of his three witnesses until the next <lb/>
morning.</p>
<figure id="f457" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0274"/>
<p>The crowd poured out of the place and went <lb/>
flocking away in excited groups and couples, <lb/>
talking the events of the session over with <reg orig="vi-|vacity">vivacity</reg> <lb/>
and consuming interest, and everybody <lb/>
seemed to have had a satisfactory and <reg orig="enjoy-|able">enjoyable</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="270" entity="DSSR_000002495_0275"/>
day except the accused, their counsel, and <lb/>
their old-lady friend. There was no cheer <lb/>
among these, and no substantial hope.</p>
<p>In parting with the twins Aunt Patsy did <lb/>
attempt a good-night with a gay pretense of <lb/>
hope and cheer in it, but broke down without <lb/>
finishing.</p>
<p>Absolutely secure as Tom considered <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
to be, the opening solemnities of the trial <lb/>
had nevertheless oppressed him with a <lb/>
vague uneasiness, his being a nature sensitive <lb/>
to even the smallest alarms; but from the <lb/>
moment that the poverty and weakness of <lb/>
Wilson's case lay exposed to the court, he was <lb/>
comfortable once more, even jubilant. He <lb/>
left the court-room sarcastically sorry for <reg orig="Wil-|son">Wilson</reg>. <lb/>
"The Clarksons met an unknown <lb/>
woman in the back lane," he said to himself&mdash; <lb/>
"<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is his case! I'll give him a century to <lb/>
find her in&mdash;a couple of them if he likes. A <lb/>
woman who does n't exist any longer, and the <lb/>
clothes that gave her her sex burnt up and the <lb/>
ashes thrown away&mdash;oh, certainly, he'll find <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">her</hi> easy enough!" This reflection set him <lb/>
to admiring, for the hundredth time, the <lb/>
<figure id="f458" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0275"/>
<pb n="271" entity="DSSR_000002495_0276"/>
shrewd ingenuities by which he had insured <lb/>
himself against detection&mdash;more, against even <lb/>
suspicion.</p>
<p>"Nearly always in cases like this there is <lb/>
some little detail or other overlooked, some <lb/>
wee little track or trace left behind, and <reg orig="detec-|tion">detection</reg> <lb/>
follows; but here there's not even the <lb/>
faintest suggestion of a trace left. No more <lb/>
than a bird leaves when it flies through the <lb/>
air&mdash;yes, through the night, you may say. The <lb/>
man that can track a bird through the air in <lb/>
the dark and find that bird is the man to track <lb/>
me out and find the Judge's assassin&mdash;no other <lb/>
need apply. And that is the job that has been <lb/>
laid out for poor Pudd'nhead Wilson, of all <lb/>
people in the world! Lord, it will be <reg orig="patheti-|cally">pathetically</reg> <lb/>
funny to see him grubbing and groping <lb/>
after that woman that don't exist, and the <lb/>
right person sitting under his very nose all <lb/>
the time!" The more he thought the <reg orig="situa-|tion">situation</reg> <lb/>
over, the more the humor of it struck <lb/>
him. Finally he said, "I'll never let him <lb/>
hear the last of that woman. Every time I <lb/>
catch him in company, to his dying day, I'll <lb/>
ask him in the guileless affectionate way that <lb/>
<figure id="f459" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0276"/>

<pb n="272" entity="DSSR_000002495_0277"/>
used to gravel him so when I inquired how <lb/>
his unborn law-business was coming along, <lb/>
'Got on her track yet&mdash;hey, Pudd'nhead?'" <lb/>
He wanted to laugh, but that would not have <lb/>
answered; there were people about, and he <lb/>
was mourning for his uncle. He made up his <lb/>
mind that it would be good entertainment to <lb/>
look in on Wilson that night and watch him <lb/>
worry over his barren law-case and goad him <lb/>
with an exasperating word or two of sympathy <lb/>
and commiseration now and then.</p>
<figure id="f461" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0277"/>
<p>Wilson wanted no supper, he had no <reg orig="appe-|tite">appetite</reg>. <lb/>
He got out all the finger-prints of girls <lb/>
and women in his collection of records and <lb/>
pored gloomily over them an hour or more, <lb/>
trying to convince himself that that <reg orig="trouble-|some">troublesome</reg> <lb/>
girl's marks were there somewhere and <lb/>
had been overlooked. But it was not so. <lb/>
He drew back his chair, clasped his hands over <lb/>
his head, and gave himself up to dull and arid <lb/>
musings.</p>
<p>Tom Driscoll dropped in, an hour after <lb/>
dark, and said with a pleasant laugh as he <lb/>
took a seat&mdash;</p>
<p>"Hello, we've gone back to the amusements <lb/>
<figure id="f462" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0277"/>
<pb n="273" entity="DSSR_000002495_0278"/>
of our days of neglect and obscurity for <reg orig="con-|solation">consolation</reg>, <lb/>
have we?" and he took up one of the <lb/>
glass strips and held it against the light to <lb/>
inspect it. "Come, cheer up, old man; <lb/>
there's no use in losing your grip and going <lb/>
back to this child's-play merely because this <lb/>
big sunspot is drifting across your shiny new <lb/>
disk. It'll pass, and you'll be all right <lb/>
again,"&mdash;and he laid the glass down. "Did <lb/>
you think you could win always?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no," said Wilson, with a sigh, "I <lb/>
did n't expect that, but I can't believe Luigi <lb/>
killed your uncle, and I feel very sorry for <lb/>
him. It makes me blue. And you would feel <lb/>
as I do, Tom, if you were not prejudiced <lb/>
against those young fellows."</p>
<p>"I don't know about that," and Tom's <lb/>
countenence darkened, for his memory <reg orig="re-|verted">reverted</reg> <lb/>
to his kicking; "I owe them no good <lb/>
will, considering the brunette one's treatment <lb/>
of me that night. Prejudice or no prejudice, <lb/>
Pudd'nhead, I don't like them, and when they <lb/>
get their deserts you're not going to find me <lb/>
sitting on the mourner's bench."</p>
<figure id="f463" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0278"/>
<pb n="274" entity="DSSR_000002495_0279"/>
<p>He took up another strip of glass, and <reg orig="ex-|claimed&mdash;">exclaimed&mdash;"</reg></p>
<p>"Why, here's old Roxy's label! Are you <lb/>
going to ornament the royal palaces with <reg orig="nig-|ger">nigger</reg> <lb/>
paw-marks, too? By the date here, I <lb/>
was seven months old when this was done, <lb/>
and she was nursing me and her little nigger <lb/>
cub. There's a line straight across her <lb/>
thumb-print. How comes that?" and Tom <lb/>
held out the piece of glass to Wilson.</p>
<p>"That is common," said the bored man, <lb/>
wearily. "Scar of a cut or a scratch, <reg orig='usu-|ally"&mdash;and'>usually"&mdash;and</reg> <lb/>
he took the strip of glass <reg orig="indiffer-|ently">indifferently</reg>, <lb/>
and raised it toward the lamp.</p>
<figure id="f464" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0279"/>
<p>All the blood sunk suddenly out of his face; <lb/>
his hand quaked, and he gazed at the polished <lb/>
surface before him with the glassy stare of a <lb/>
corpse.</p>
<p>"Great Heavens, what's the matter with <lb/>
you, Wilson? Are you going to faint?"</p>
<p>Tom sprang for a glass of water and offered <lb/>
it, but Wilson shrank shuddering from him <lb/>
and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"No, no!&mdash;take it away!" His breast <lb/>
was rising and falling, and he moved his head <lb/>
<figure id="f465" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0279"/>
<pb n="275" entity="DSSR_000002495_0280"/>
about in a dull and wandering way, like a <reg orig="per-|son">person</reg> <lb/>
who has been stunned. Presently he <lb/>
said, "I shall feel better when I get to bed; <lb/>
I have been overwrought to-day; yes, and <lb/>
over worked for many days."</p>
<p>"Then I'll leave you and let you to get to <lb/>
your rest. Good-night, old man." But as <lb/>
Tom went out he could n't deny himself a <lb/>
small parting gibe: "Don't take it so hard; <lb/>
a body can't win every time; you'll hang <lb/>
somebody yet."</p>
<p>Wilson muttered to himself, "It is no lie to <lb/>
say I am sorry I have to begin with you, <lb/>
miserable dog though you are!"</p>
<p>He braced himself up with a glass of cold <lb/>
whisky, and went to work again. He did not <lb/>
compare the new finger-marks unintentionally <lb/>
left by Tom a few minutes before on Roxy's <lb/>
glass with the tracings of the marks left on the <lb/>
knife-handle, there being no need of that (for <lb/>
his trained eye), but busied himself with <lb/>
another matter, muttering from time to time, <lb/>
"Idiot that I was!&mdash;Nothing but a <hi rend="italic">girl</hi> <lb/>
would do me&mdash;a man in girl's clothes never <lb/>
occurred to me." First, he hunted out the <lb/>
<figure id="f466" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0280"/>
<pb n="276" entity="DSSR_000002495_0281"/>
plate containing the finger-prints made by <lb/>
Tom when he was twelve years old, and laid <lb/>
it by itself; then he brought forth the marks <lb/>
made by Tom's baby fingers when he was a <lb/>
suckling of seven months, and placed these <lb/>
two plates with the one containing this <reg orig="sub-|ject's">subject's</reg> <lb/>
newly (and unconsciously) made <reg orig="rec-|ord">record</reg>.</p>
<p>"Now the series is complete," he said with <lb/>
satisfaction, and sat down to inspect these <lb/>
things and enjoy them.</p>
<p>But his enjoyment was brief. He stared a <lb/>
considerable time at the three strips, and <lb/>
seemed stupefied with astonishment. At last <lb/>
he put them down and said, "I can't make it <lb/>
out at all&mdash;hang it, the baby's don't tally with <lb/>
the others!"</p>
<p>He walked the floor for half an hour <reg orig="puz-|zling">puzzling</reg> <lb/>
over his enigma, then he hunted out two <lb/>
other glass plates.</p>
<p>He sat down and puzzled over these things <lb/>
a good while, but kept muttering, "It's no <lb/>
use; I can't understand it. They don't tally <lb/>
right, and yet I'll swear the names and dates <lb/>
are right, and so of course they <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to tally. <lb/>
<figure id="f467" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0281"/>
<pb n="277" entity="DSSR_000002495_0282"/>
I never labeled one of these things carelessly <lb/>
in my life. There is a most extraordinary <lb/>
mystery here."</p>
<p>He was tired out, now, and his brains were <lb/>
beginning to clog. He said he would sleep <lb/>
himself fresh, and then see what he could do <lb/>
with this riddle. He slept through a troubled <lb/>
and unrestful hour, then unconsciousness <reg orig="be-|gan">began</reg> <lb/>
to shred away, and presently he rose <lb/>
drowsily to a sitting posture. "Now what <lb/>
was that dream?" he said, trying to recall it; <lb/>
"what was that dream?&mdash;it seemed to unravel <lb/>
that puz&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>He landed in the middle of the floor at a <lb/>
bound, without finishing the sentence, and <lb/>
ran and turned up his light and seized his <lb/>
"records." He took a single swift glance at <lb/>
them and cried out&mdash;</p>
<p>"It's so! Heavens, what a revelation! <lb/>
And for twenty-three years no man has ever <lb/>
suspected it!"</p>

</argument>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Wilson</hi> put on enough clothes for business <lb/>
purposes and went to work under a high <reg orig="pres-|sure">pressure</reg> <lb/>
of steam. He was awake all over. All <lb/>
sense of weariness had been swept away by <lb/>
the invigorating refreshment of the great and <lb/>
hopeful discovery which he had made. He <lb/>
made fine and accurate reproductions of a <reg orig="num-|ber">number</reg> <lb/>
of his "records," and then enlarged them on <lb/>
a scale of ten to one with his pantograph. He <lb/>
did these pantograph enlargements on sheets of <lb/>
white cardboard, and made each individual line <lb/>
of the bewildering maze of whorls or curves <lb/>
or loops which constituted the "pattern," of a <lb/>
"record" stand out bold and black by <reg orig="reinfor-|cing">reinforcing</reg> <lb/>

it with ink. To the untrained eye the <reg orig="col-|lection">collection</reg> <lb/>
of delicate originals made by the human <lb/>
finger on the glass plates looked about alike; <lb/>
but when enlarged ten times they resembled <lb/>
the markings of a block of wood that has been <lb/>
sawed across the grain, and the dullest eye <lb/>
could detect at a glance, and at a distance of <lb/>
many feet, that no two of the patterns were <lb/>
alike. When Wilson had at last finished his <lb/>
tedious and difficult work, he arranged its <reg orig="re-|sults">results</reg> <lb/>
according to a plan in which a <reg orig="progres-|sive">progressive</reg> <lb/>
order and sequence was a principal <reg orig="feat-|ure">feature</reg>; <lb/>
then he added to the batch several <reg orig="panto-|graph">pantograph</reg> <lb/>
enlargements which he had made from <lb/>
time to time in bygone years.</p>
<p>The night was spent and the day well <reg orig="ad-|vanced">advanced</reg>, <lb/>
now. By the time he had snatched <lb/>
a trifle of breakfast it was nine o'clock, and <lb/>
the court was ready to begin its sitting. He <lb/>
was in his place twelve minutes later with his <lb/>
"records."</p>
<figure id="f471" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0284"/>
<p>Tom Driscoll caught a slight glimpse of the <lb/>
records, and nudged his nearest friend and <lb/>
said, with a wink, "Pudd'nhead's got a rare <lb/>
eye to business&mdash;thinks that as long as he <lb/>

can't win his case it's at least a noble good <lb/>
chance to advertise his palace-window <reg orig="decora-|tions">decorations</reg> <lb/>
without any expense." Wilson was <reg orig="in-|formed">informed</reg> <lb/>
that his witnesses had been delayed, but <lb/>
would arrive presently; but he rose and said <lb/>
he should probably not have occasion to make <lb/>
use of their testimony. [An amused murmur <lb/>
ran through the room&mdash;"It's a clean <reg orig="back-|down">backdown</reg>! <lb/>
he gives up without hitting a lick!"] <lb/>
Wilson continued&mdash;"I have other testimony <lb/>
&mdash;and better. [This compelled interest, and <lb/>
evoked murmurs of surprise that had a <reg orig="detec-|tible">detectible</reg> <lb/>
ingredient of disappointment in them.] If <lb/>
I seem to be springing this evidence upon the <lb/>
court, I offer as my justification for this, that <lb/>
I did not discover its existence until late last <lb/>
night, and have been engaged in examining <lb/>
and classifying it ever since, until half an hour <lb/>
ago. I shall offer it presently; but first I <lb/>
wish to say a few preliminary words.</p>
<figure id="f473" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0285"/>
<p>"May it please the Court, the claim given <lb/>
the front place, the claim most persistently <lb/>
urged, the claim most strenuously and I may <lb/>
even say aggressively and defiantly insisted <lb/>
upon by the prosecution, is this&mdash;that the <reg orig="per-|son">person</reg> <lb/>
<figure id="f474" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0285"/>
<pb n="281" entity="DSSR_000002495_0286"/>
whose hand left the blood-stained <reg orig="finger-|prints">fingerprints</reg> <lb/>
upon the handle of the Indian knife is <lb/>
the person who committed the murder." <reg orig="Wil-|son">Wilson</reg> <lb/>
paused, during several moments, to give <lb/>
impressiveness to what he was about to say, <lb/>
and then added tranquilly, "<hi rend="italic">We grant that <lb/>
claim."</hi></p>
<p>It was an electrical surprise. No one was <lb/>
prepared for such an admission. A buzz of <lb/>
astonishment rose on all sides, and people were <lb/>
heard to intimate that the overworked lawyer <lb/>
had lost his mind. Even the veteran judge, <lb/>
accustomed as he was to legal ambushes and <lb/>
masked batteries in criminal procedure, was <lb/>
not sure that his ears were not deceiving him, <lb/>
and asked counsel what it was he had said. <lb/>
Howard's impassive face betrayed no sign, but <lb/>
his attitude and bearing lost something of <lb/>
their careless confidence for a moment. <reg orig="Wil-|son">Wilson</reg> <lb/>
resumed:</p>
<figure id="f475" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0286"/>
<p>"We not only grant that claim, but we <reg orig="wel-|come">welcome</reg> <lb/>
it and strongly endorse it. Leaving <lb/>
that matter for the present, we will now <reg orig="pro-|ceed">proceed</reg> <lb/>
to consider other points in the case <lb/>
which we propose to establish by evidence, <lb/>
<figure id="f476" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0286"/>
<pb n="282" entity="DSSR_000002495_0287"/>
and shall include that one in the chain in its <lb/>
proper place."</p>
<p>He had made up his mind to try a few <lb/>
hardy guesses, in mapping out his theory of <lb/>
the origin and motive of the murder&mdash;guesses <lb/>
designed to fill up gaps in it&mdash;guesses which <lb/>
could help if they hit, and would probably do <lb/>
no harm if they did n't.</p>
<figure id="f477" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0287"/>
<p>"To my mind, certain circumstances of the <lb/>
case before the court seem to suggest a motive <lb/>
for the homicide quite different from the one <lb/>
insisted on by the State. It is my conviction <lb/>
that the motive was not revenge, but robbery. <lb/>
It has been urged that the presence of the <reg orig="ac-|cused">accused</reg> <lb/>
brothers in that fatal room, just after <lb/>
notification that one of them must take the <lb/>
life of Judge Driscoll or lose his own the <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
the parties should meet, clearly signifies <lb/>
that the natural instinct of self-preservation <lb/>
moved my clients to go there secretly and save <lb/>
Count Luigi by destroying his adversary.</p>
<p>"Then why did they stay there, after the <lb/>
deed was done? Mrs. Pratt had time, <reg orig="al-|though">although</reg> <lb/>
she did not hear the cry for help, but <lb/>
woke up some moments later, to run to that <lb/>
<figure id="f478" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0287"/>
<pb n="283" entity="DSSR_000002495_0288"/>
room&mdash;and there she found these men standing <lb/>
and making no effort to escape. If they were <lb/>
guilty, they ought to have been running out <lb/>
of the house at the same time that she was <lb/>
running to that room. If they had had such <lb/>
a strong instinct toward self-preservation as <lb/>
to move them to kill that unarmed man, what <lb/>
had become of it now, when it should have <lb/>
been more alert than ever? Would any of us <lb/>
have remained there? Let us not slander <lb/>
our intelligence to that degree.</p>
<figure id="f479" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0288"/>
<p>"Much stress has been laid upon the fact <lb/>
that the accused offered a very large reward <lb/>
for the knife with which this murder was done; <lb/>
that no thief came forward to claim that <reg orig="ex-|traordinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
reward; that the latter fact was <lb/>
good circumstantial evidence that the claim <lb/>
that the knife had been stolen was a vanity <lb/>
and a fraud; that these details taken in con. <lb/>
nection with the memorable and apparently <lb/>
prophetic speech of the deceased concerning <lb/>
that knife, and the final discovery of that very <lb/>
knife in the fatal room where no living person <lb/>
was found present with the slaughtered man <lb/>
but the owner of the knife and his brother, <lb/>
<figure id="f480" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0288"/>
<pb n="284" entity="DSSR_000002495_0289"/>
form an indestructible chain of evidence which <lb/>
fixes the crime upon those unfortunate <reg orig="stran-|gers">strangers</reg>.</p>
<figure id="f481" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0289"/>
<p>"But I shall presently ask to be sworn, and <lb/>
shall testify that there was a large reward <reg orig="of-|fered">offered</reg> <lb/>
for the <hi rend="italic">thief,</hi> also; that it was offered <reg orig="se-|cretly">secretly</reg> <lb/>
and not advertisde; that this fact was <lb/>
indiscreetly mentioned&mdash;or at least tacitly <reg orig="ad-|mitted&mdash;in">admitted&mdash;in</reg> <lb/>
what was supposed to be safe <reg orig="cir-|cumstances">circumstances</reg>, <lb/>
but may <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have been. The <lb/>
thief may have been present himself. [Tom <lb/>
Driscoll had been looking at the speaker, but <lb/>
dropped his eyes at this point.] In that case <lb/>
he would retain the knife in his possession, <lb/>
not daring to offer it for sale, or for pledge in <lb/>
a pawn-shop. [There was a nodding of heads <lb/>
among the audience by way of admission that <lb/>
this was not a bad stroke.] I shall prove to <lb/>
the satisfaction of the jury that there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a <lb/>
person in Judge Driscoll's room several <lb/>
minutes before the accused entered it. [This <lb/>
produced a strong sensation; the last <reg orig="drowsy-|head">drowsy-head</reg> <lb/>
in the court-room roused up, now, and <lb/>
made preparation to listen.] If it shall seem <lb/>
necessary, I will prove by the Misses <reg orig="Clark-|son">Clarkson</reg> <lb/>
<figure id="f482" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0289"/>
<pb n="285" entity="DSSR_000002495_0290"/>
that they met a veiled person&mdash;ostensibly <lb/>
a woman&mdash;coming out of the back gate a few <lb/>
minutes after the cry for help was heard. <lb/>
This person was not a woman, but a man <lb/>
dressed in woman's clothes." Another <reg orig="sensa-|tion">sensation</reg>. <lb/>
Wilson had his eye on Tom when he <lb/>
hazarded this guess, to see what effect it would <lb/>
produce. He was satisfied with the result, <lb/>
and said to himself, "It was a success&mdash;he's <lb/>
hit!"</p>
<figure id="f483" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0290"/>
<p>"The object of that person in that house <lb/>
was robbery, not murder. It is true that the <lb/>
safe was not open, but there was an ordinary <lb/>
tin cash-box on the table, with three thousand <lb/>
dollars in it. It is easily supposable that the <lb/>
thief was concealed in the house; that he <lb/>
knew of this box, and of its owner's habit of <lb/>
counting its contents and arranging his <reg orig="ac-|counts">accounts</reg> <lb/>
at night&mdash;if he had that habit, which I <lb/>
do not assert, of course;&mdash;that he tried to take <lb/>
the box while its owner slept, but made a noise <lb/>

save himself from capture; and that he fled <lb/>
without his booty because he heard help <lb/>
coming.</p>

<p>"I have now done with my theory, and will <lb/>
proceed to the evidences by which I propose <lb/>
to try to prove its soundness." Wilson took <lb/>
up several of his strips of glass. When the <lb/>
audience recognized these familiar mementoes <lb/>
of Pudd'nhead's old-time childish "puttering" <lb/>
and folly, the tense and funereal interest <reg orig="van-|ished">vanished</reg> <lb/>
out of their faces, and the house burst <lb/>
into volleys of relieving and refreshing <reg orig="laugh-|ter">laughter</reg>, <lb/>
and Tom chirked up and joined in the <lb/>
fun himself; but Wilson was apparently not <lb/>
disturbed. He arranged his records on the <lb/>
table before him, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"I beg the indulgence of the court while I <lb/>
make a few remarks in explanation of some <lb/>
evidence which I am about to introduce, and <lb/>
which I shall presently ask to be allowed to <lb/>
verify under oath on the witness stand. <lb/>
Every human being carries with him from his <lb/>
cradle to his grave certain physical marks <lb/>
which do not change their character, and by <lb/>
which he can always be identified&mdash;and that <lb/>
without shade of doubt or question. These <lb/>
marks are his signature, his physiological <reg orig="au-|tograph">autograph</reg>, <lb/>
so to speak, and this autograph can <lb/>
<figure id="f485" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0291"/>
<pb n="287" entity="DSSR_000002495_0292"/>
not be counterfeited, nor can he disguise it or <lb/>
hide it away, nor can it become illegible by <lb/>
the wear and mutations of time. This <reg orig="signa-|ture">signature</reg> <lb/>
is not his face&mdash;age can change that <lb/>
beyond recognition; it is not his hair, for that <lb/>
can fall out; it is not his height, for duplicates <lb/>
of that exist; it is not his form, for duplicates <lb/>
of that exist also, whereas this signature is <lb/>
each man's very own&mdash;there is no duplicate of <lb/>
it among the swarming populations of the <lb/>
globe! [The audience were interested once <lb/>
more.]</p>
<figure id="f486" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0292"/>
<p>"This autograph consists of the delicate lines <lb/>
or corrugations with which Nature marks the <lb/>
insides of the hands and the soles of the feet. <lb/>
If you will look at the balls of your fingers,&mdash; <lb/>
you that have very sharp eyesight,&mdash;you will <lb/>
observe that these dainty curving lines lie close <lb/>
together, like those that indicate the borders <lb/>
of oceans in maps, and that they form various <lb/>
clearly defined patterns, such as arches, circles, <lb/>
long curves, whorls, etc., and that these <reg orig="pat-|terns">patterns</reg> <lb/>
differ on the different fingers. [Every <lb/>
man in the room had his hand up to the light, <lb/>
now, and his head canted to one side, and <lb/>
<figure id="f487" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0292"/>
<pb n="288" entity="DSSR_000002495_0293"/>
<figure id="f488" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0293"/>
was minutely scrutinizing the balls of his <lb/>
fingers; there were whispered ejaculations of <lb/>
"Why, it's so&mdash;I never noticed that before!"] <lb/>
The patterns on the right hand are not the <lb/>
same as those on the left. [Ejaculations of <lb/>
"Why, that's so, too!"] Taken finger for <lb/>
finger, your patterns differ from your <reg orig="neigh-|bor's">neighbor's</reg>. <lb/>
[Comparisons were made all over the <lb/>
house&mdash;even the judge and jury were <reg orig="ab-|sorbed">absorbed</reg> <lb/>
in this curious work.] The patterns <lb/>
of a twin's right hand are not the same as <lb/>
those on his left. One twin's patterns are <lb/>
never the same as his fellow-twin's patterns&mdash; <lb/>
the jury will find that the patterns upon the <lb/>
finger-balls of the accused follow this rule. <lb/>
[An examination of the twins' hands was <reg orig="be-|gun">begun</reg> <lb/>
at once.] You have often heard of twins <lb/>
who were so exactly alike that when dressed <lb/>
alike their own parents could not tell them <lb/>
apart. Yet there was never a twin born into <lb/>
this world that did not carry from birth to <lb/>
death a sure identifier in this mysterious and <lb/>
marvelous natal autograph. That once known <lb/>
to you, his fellow-twin could never personate <lb/>
him and deceive you."</p>
<figure id="f489" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0293"/>
<pb n="289" entity="DSSR_000002495_0294"/>
<p>Wilson stopped and stood silent. <reg orig="Inatten-|tion">Inattention</reg> <lb/>
dies a quick and sure death when a <lb/>
speaker does that. The stillness gives <reg orig="warn-|ing">warning</reg> <lb/>
that something is coming. All palms and <lb/>
finger-balls went down, now, all slouching <lb/>
forms straightened, all heads came up, all eyes <lb/>
were fastened upon Wilson's face. He waited <lb/>
yet one, two, three moments, to let his pause <lb/>
complete and perfect its spell upon the house; <lb/>
then, when through the profound hush he <lb/>
could hear the ticking of the clock on the <lb/>
wall, he put out his hand and took the Indian <lb/>
knife by the blade and held it aloft where all <lb/>
could see the sinister spots upon its ivory <lb/>
handle; then he said, in a level and <reg orig="passion-|less">passionless</reg> <lb/>
voice&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f490" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0294"/>
<p>"Upon this haft stands the assassin's natal <lb/>
autograph, written in the blood of that <reg orig="help-|less">helpless</reg> <lb/>
and unoffending old man who loved you <lb/>
and whom you all loved. There is but one <lb/>
man in the whole earth whose hand can <reg orig="dupli-|cate">duplicate</reg> <lb/>
that crimson sign,"&mdash;he paused and <lb/>
raised his eyes to the pendulum swinging back <lb/>
and forth,&mdash;"and please God we will produce <lb/>
<figure id="f491" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0294"/>
<pb n="290" entity="DSSR_000002495_0295"/>
that man in this room before the clock strikes <lb/>
noon!"</p>
<p>Stunned, distraught, unconscious of its own <lb/>
movement, the house half rose, as if expecting <lb/>
to see the murderer appear at the door, and a <lb/>
breeze of muttered ejaculations swept the <lb/>
place. "Order in the court!&mdash;sit down!" <lb/>
This from the sheriff. He was obeyed, and <lb/>
quiet reigned again. Wilson stole a glance <lb/>
at Tom, and said to himself, "He is flying <lb/>
signals of distress, now; even people who <reg orig="de-|spise">despise</reg> <lb/>
him are pitying him; they think this is a <lb/>
hard ordeal for a young fellow who has lost <lb/>
his benefactor by so cruel a stroke&mdash;and they <lb/>
are right." He resumed his speech:</p>
<figure id="f492" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0295"/>
<p>"For more than twenty years I have <lb/>
amused my compulsory leisure with collecting <lb/>
these curious physical signatures in this town. <lb/>
At my house I have hundreds upon hundreds <lb/>
of them. Each and every one is labelled <lb/>
with name and date; not labelled the next <lb/>
day or even the next hour, but in the very <lb/>
minute that the impression was taken. When <lb/>
I go upon the witness stand I will repeat under <lb/>
oath the things which I am now saying. I <lb/>
<figure id="f493" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0295"/>
<pb n="291" entity="DSSR_000002495_0296"/>
have the finger-prints of the court, the sheriff, <lb/>
and every member of the jury. There is <lb/>
hardly a person in this room, white or black, <lb/>
whose natal signature I cannot produce, and <lb/>
not one of them can so disguise himself that I <lb/>
cannot pick him out from a multitude of <lb/>
his fellow-creatures and unerringly identify <lb/>
him by his hands. And if he and I should <lb/>
live to be a hundred I could still do it. <lb/>
[The interest of the audience was steadily <lb/>
deepening, now.]</p>
<p>"I have studied some of these signatures so <lb/>
much that I know them as well as the bank <lb/>
cashier knows the autograph of his oldest <reg orig="cus-|tomer">customer</reg>. <lb/>
While I turn my back now, I beg <lb/>
that several persons will be so good as to pass <lb/>
their fingers through their hair, and then <lb/>
press them upon one of the panes of the <reg orig="win-|dow">window</reg> <lb/>
near the jury, and that among them the <lb/>
accused may set <hi rend="italic">their</hi> finger-marks. Also, I <lb/>
beg that these experimenters, or others, will <lb/>
set their finger-marks upon another pane, and <lb/>
add again the marks of the accused, but not <lb/>
placing them in the same order or relation to <lb/>
the other signatures as before&mdash;for, by one <lb/>
<figure id="f494" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0296"/>
<pb n="292" entity="DSSR_000002495_0297"/>
chance in a millon, a person might happen <lb/>
upon the right marks by pure guess-work <hi rend="italic">once</hi>, <lb/>
therefore I wish to be tested twice."</p>
<p>He turned his back, and the two panes were <lb/>
quickly covered with delicately-lined oval <lb/>
spots, but visible only to such persons as could <lb/>
get a dark background for them&mdash;the foliage <lb/>
of a tree, outside, for instance. Then, upon <lb/>
call, Wilson went to the window, made his <lb/>
examination, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"This is Count Luigi's right hand; this one, <lb/>
three signatures below, is his left. Here is <lb/>
Count Angelo's right; down here is his left. <lb/>
Now for the other pane: here and here are <lb/>
Count Luigi's, here and here are his brother's." <lb/>
He faced about. "Am I right?"</p>
<p>A deafening explosion of applause was the <lb/>
answer. The Bench said&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f495" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0297"/>
<p>"This certainly approaches the miraculous!"</p>
<p>Wilson turned to the window again and <lb/>
remarked, pointing with his finger&mdash;</p>
<p>"This is the signature of Mr. Justice <reg orig="Rob-|inson">Robinson</reg>. <lb/>
[Applause.] This, of Constable Blake. <lb/>
[Applause.] This, of John Mason, juryman. <lb/>
[Applause.] This, of the sheriff. [Applause.] <lb/>
<figure id="f496" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0297"/>
<pb n="293" entity="DSSR_000002495_0298"/>
I cannot name the others, but I have them <lb/>
all at home, named and dated, and could <lb/>
identify them all by my finger-print records."</p>
<p>He moved to his place through a storm of <lb/>
applause&mdash;which the sheriff stopped, and also <lb/>
made the people sit down, for they were all <lb/>
standing and struggling to see, of course. <lb/>
Court, jury, sheriff, and everybody had been <lb/>
too absorbed in observing Wilson's <reg orig="perform-|ance">performance</reg> <lb/>
to attend to the audience earlier.</p>
<p>"Now, then," said Wilson, "I have here <lb/>
the natal autographs of two children&mdash;thrown <lb/>
up to ten times the natural size by the <reg orig="panto-|graph">pantograph</reg>, <lb/>
so that any one who can see at all can <lb/>
tell the markings apart at a glance. We will <lb/>
call the children <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi>. Here are <hi rend="italic">A's</hi> <lb/>
finger-marks, taken at the age of five months. <lb/>
Here they are again, taken at seven months. <lb/>
[Tom started.] They are alike, you see. <lb/>
Here are <hi rend="italic">B's</hi> at five months, and also at seven <lb/>
months. They, too, exactly copy each other, <lb/>
but the patterns are quite different from <hi rend="italic">A's</hi>, <lb/>
you observe. I shall refer to these again <lb/>
presently, but we will turn them face down, <lb/>
now.</p>
<figure id="f497" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0298"/>
<pb n="294" entity="DSSR_000002495_0299"/>
<p>"Here, thrown up ten sizes, are the natal <lb/>
autographs of the two persons who are here <lb/>
before you accused of murdering Judge <reg orig="Dris-|coll">Driscoll</reg>. <lb/>
I made these pantograph copies last <lb/>
night, and will so swear when I go upon the <lb/>
witness stand. I ask the jury to compare <lb/>
them with the finger-marks of the accused <lb/>
upon the window panes, and tell the court <lb/>
if they are the same."</p>
<figure id="f498" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0299"/>
<p>He passed a powerful magnifying-glass to <lb/>
the foreman.</p>
<p>One juryman after another took the <reg orig="card-|board">cardboard</reg> <lb/>
and the glass and made the comparison. <lb/>
Then the foreman said to the judge&mdash;</p>
<p>"Your honor, we are all agreed that they <lb/>
are identical."</p>
<figure id="f499" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0299"/>
<p>Wilson said to the foreman&mdash;</p>
<p>"Please turn that cardboard face down, <lb/>
and take this one, and compare it searchingly, <lb/>
by the magnifier, with the fatal signature <lb/>
upon the knife-handle, and report your finding <lb/>
to the court."</p>
<figure id="f500" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0299"/>
<p>Again the jury made minute examinations, <lb/>
and again reported&mdash;</p>
<pb n="295" entity="DSSR_000002495_0300"/>
<p>"We find them to be exactly identical, <lb/>
your honor."</p>
<p>Wilson turned toward the counsel for the <lb/>
prosecution, and there was a clearly <reg orig="recogniz-|able">recognizable</reg> <lb/>
note of warning in his voice when he <lb/>
said&mdash;</p>
<p>"May it please the court, the State has <lb/>
claimed, strenuously and persistently, that <lb/>
the blood-stained finger-prints upon that <lb/>
knife-handle were left there by the assassin of <lb/>
Judge Driscoll. You have heard us grant <lb/>
that claim, and welcome it." He turned to <lb/>
the jury: "Compare the finger-prints of the <lb/>
accused with the finger-prints left by the <reg orig="as-|sassin&mdash;and">assassin&mdash;and</reg> <lb/>
report."</p>
<figure id="f501" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0300"/>
<p>The comparison began. As it proceeded, <lb/>
all movement and all sound ceased, and the <lb/>
deep silence of an absorbed and waiting <reg orig="sus-|pense">suspense</reg> <lb/>
settled upon the house; and when at <lb/>
last the words came&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f502" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0300"/>
<p><hi rend="italic">"They do not even resemble,"</hi> a <reg orig="thunder-|crash">thunder-crash</reg> <lb/>
of applause followed and the house <lb/>
sprang to its feet, but was quickly repressed <lb/>
by official force and brought to order again. <lb/>
Tom was altering his position every few <reg orig="min-|utes">minutes</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="296" entity="DSSR_000002495_0301"/>
now, but none of his changes brought <lb/>
repose nor any small trifle of comfort. When <lb/>
the house's attention was become fixed once <lb/>
more, Wilson said gravely, indicating the <lb/>
twins with a gesture&mdash;</p>
<p>"These men are innocent&mdash;I have no <reg orig="fur-|ther">further</reg> <lb/>
concern with them. [Another outbreak <lb/>
of applause began, but was promptly checked.] <lb/>
We will now proceed to find the guilty. <lb/>
[Tom's eyes were starting from their sockets <lb/>
&mdash;yes, it was a cruel day for the bereaved <lb/>
youth, everybody thought.] We will return <lb/>
to the infant autographs of <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> I will <lb/>
ask the jury to take these large pantograph <lb/>
facsimiles of <hi rend="italic">A's</hi> marked five months and <lb/>
seven months. Do they tally?"</p>
<p>The foreman responded&mdash;</p>
<p>"Perfectly."</p>
<p>"Now examine this pantograph, taken at <lb/>
eight months, and also marked <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Does it <lb/>
tally with the other two?"</p>
<p>The surprised response was&mdash;</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">No&mdash;they differ widely!</hi>"</p>
<p>"You are quite right. Now take these <lb/>
two pantographs of <hi rend="italic">B's</hi> autograph, marked <lb/>
<figure id="f503" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0301"/>
<pb n="297" entity="DSSR_000002495_0302"/>
five months and seven months. Do they tally <lb/>
with each other?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;perfectly."</p>
<p>"Take this third pantograph marked <hi rend="italic">B,</hi> <lb/>
eight months. Does it tally with <hi rend="italic">B's</hi> other <lb/>
two?"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">By no means!</hi>"</p>
<p>"Do you know how to account for those <lb/>
strange discrepancies? I will tell you. For <lb/>
a purpose unknown to us, but probably a <reg orig="sel-|fish">selfish</reg> <lb/>
one, somebody changed those children in <lb/>
the cradle."</p>
<p>This produced a vast sensation, naturally; <lb/>
Roxana was astonished at this admirable <lb/>
guess, but not disturbed by it. To guess the <lb/>
exchange was one thing, to guess who did it <lb/>
quite another. Pudd'nhead Wilson could do <lb/>
wonderful things, no doubt, but he could n't <lb/>
do impossible ones. Safe? She was <reg orig="per-|fectly">perfectly</reg> <lb/>
safe. She smiled privately.</p>
<p>"Between the ages of seven months and <lb/>
eight months those children were changed in <lb/>
the cradle"&mdash;he made one of his effect-<reg orig="collect-|ing">collecting</reg> <lb/>
pauses, and added&mdash;"and the person who <lb/>
did it is in this house!"</p>
<figure id="f504" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0302"/>
<pb n="298" entity="DSSR_000002495_0303"/>
<p>Roxy's pulses stood still! The house was <lb/>
thrilled as with an electric shock, and the <reg orig="peo-|ple">people</reg> <lb/>
half rose as if to seek a glimpse of the <lb/>
person who had made that exchange. Tom <lb/>
was growing limp; the life seemed oozing <lb/>
out of him. Wilson resumed:</p>
<figure id="f505" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0303"/>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">A</hi> was put into <hi rend="italic">B's</hi> cradle in the nursery; <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">B</hi> was transferred to the kitchen and became <lb/>
a negro and a slave, [Sensation&mdash;confusion <lb/>
of angry ejaculations]&mdash;but within a quarter <lb/>
of an hour he will stand before you white and <lb/>
free! [Burst of applause, checked by the <reg orig="offi-|cers.]">officers.]</reg> <lb/>
From seven months onward until now, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">A</hi> has still been a usurper, and in my <reg orig="finger-|record">finger-record</reg> <lb/>
he bears <hi rend="italic">B's</hi> name. Here is his <reg orig="pan-|tograph">pantograph</reg> <lb/>
at the age of twelve. Compare it <lb/>
with the assassin's signature upon the <reg orig="knife-|handle">knife-handle</reg>. <lb/>
Do they tally?"</p>
<p>The foreman answered&mdash;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"To the minutest detail!"</hi></p>
<p>Wilson said, solemnly&mdash;</p>
<p>"The murderer of your friend and mine&mdash; <lb/>
York Driscoll of the generous hand and the <lb/>
kindly spirit&mdash;sits in among you. Valet de <lb/>
Chambre, negro and slave,&mdash;falsely called <lb/>

<pb n="299" entity="DSSR_000002495_0304"/>
Thomas &agrave; Becket Driscoll,&mdash;make upon the <lb/>
window the finger-prints that will hang you!"</p>
<p>Tom turned his ashen face imploringly <lb/>
toward the speaker, made some impotent <lb/>
movements with his white lips, then slid limp <lb/>
and lifeless to the floor.</p>
<p>Wilson broke the awed silence with the <lb/>
words&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f507" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0304"/>
<p>"There is no need. He has confessed."</p>
<p>Roxy flung herself upon her knees, covered <lb/>
her face with her hands, and out through her <lb/>
sobs the words struggled&mdash;</p>
<p>"De Lord have mercy on me, po' misable <lb/>
sinner dat I is!"</p>
<p>The clock struck twelve.</p>
<p>The court rose; the new prisoner, <reg orig="hand-|cuffed">handcuffed</reg>, <lb/>
was removed.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> town sat up all night to discuss the <lb/>

as to when Tom's trial would begin. Troop <lb/>

and require a speech, and shout <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
hoarse over every sentence that fell <lb/>
from his lips&mdash;for all his sentences were <lb/>

member of it was quite sure to raise his voice <lb/>
and say&mdash;</p>
<p>"And this is the man the likes of us have <lb/>
called a pudd'nhead for more than twenty <lb/>
years. He has resigned from that position, <lb/>
friends."</p>
<p>"Yes, but it is n't vacant&mdash;we're elected."</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> twins were heroes of romance, now, <lb/>
and with rehabilitated reputations. But they <lb/>
were weary of Western adventure, and <lb/>
straightway retired to Europe.</p>
<p>Roxy's heart was broken. The young <reg orig="fel-|low">fellow</reg> <lb/>
upon whom she had inflicted twenty-three <lb/>
years of slavery continued the false heir's <lb/>
pension of thirty-five dollars a month to her, <lb/>
but her hurts were too deep for money to <lb/>
heal; the spirit in her eye was quenched, her <lb/>
martial bearing departed with it, and the <lb/>
voice of her laughter ceased in the land. In <lb/>
her church and its affairs she found her only <lb/>
solace.</p>
<p>The real heir suddenly found himself rich <lb/>
and free, but in a most embarrassing <reg orig="situa-|tion">situation</reg>. <lb/>
He could neither read nor write, and <lb/>
<figure id="f510" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0306"/>
<pb n="302" entity="DSSR_000002495_0307"/>
his speech was the basest dialect of the <reg orig="ne-|gro">negro</reg> <lb/>
quarter. His gait, his attitudes, his <reg orig="ges-|tures">gestures</reg>, <lb/>
his bearing, his laugh&mdash;all were vulgar <lb/>
and uncouth; his manners were the manners <lb/>
of a slave. Money and fine clothes could not <lb/>
mend these defects or cover them up; they <lb/>
only made them the more glaring and the <lb/>
more pathetic. The poor fellow could not <lb/>
endure the terrors of the white man's parlor, <lb/>
and felt at home and at peace nowhere but in <lb/>
the kitchen. The family pew was a misery <lb/>
to him, yet he could nevermore enter into <lb/>
the solacing refuge of the "nigger gallery"&mdash; <lb/>
that was closed to him for good and all. But <lb/>
we cannot follow his curious fate further&mdash; <lb/>
that it would be a long story.</p>
<figure id="f511" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0307"/>
<p>The false heir made a full confession and <lb/>
was sentenced to imprisonment for life. But <lb/>
now a complication came up. The Percy <lb/>
Driscoll estate was in such a crippled shape <lb/>
when its owner died that it could pay only <lb/>
sixty per cent. of its great indebtedness, and <lb/>
was settled at that rate. But the creditors <lb/>
came forward, now, and complained that <reg orig="inas-|much">inasmuch</reg> <lb/>
as through an error for which <hi rend="italic">they</hi> were <lb/>

in no way to blame the false heir was not <reg orig="in-|ventoried">inventoried</reg> <lb/>
at that time with the rest of the <lb/>
property, great wrong and loss had thereby <lb/>
been inflicted upon them. They rightly <lb/>
claimed that "Tom" was lawfully their <reg orig="prop-|erty">property</reg> <lb/>
and had been so for eight years; that <lb/>
they had already lost sufficiently in being <reg orig="de-|prived">deprived</reg> <lb/>
of his services during that long period, <lb/>
and ought not to be required to add anything <lb/>
to that loss; that if he had been delivered up <lb/>
to them in the first place, they would have <lb/>
sold him and he could not have murdered <lb/>
Judge Driscoll; therefore it was not he that <lb/>
had really committed the murder, the guilt <lb/>
lay with the erroneous inventory. <reg orig="Every-|body">Everybody</reg> <lb/>
saw that there was reason in this. <lb/>
Everybody granted that if "Tom" were <lb/>
white and free it would be unquestionably <lb/>
right to punish him&mdash;it would be no loss to <lb/>
anybody; but to shut up a valuable slave for <lb/>
life&mdash;that was quite another matter.</p>
<p>As soon as the Governor understood the <lb/>
case, he pardoned Tom at once, and the <lb/>
creditors sold him down the river.</p>

<head>THOSE EXTRAORDINARY TWINS.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">A man</hi> who is not born with the novel-writing <lb/>
gift has a troublesome time of it when he tries to <lb/>
build a novel. I know this from experience. He <lb/>
has no clear idea of his story; in fact he has no <lb/>
story. He merely has some people in his mind, and <lb/>
an incident or two, also a locality. He knows these <lb/>
people, he knows the selected locality, and he trusts <lb/>
that he can plunge those people into those incidents <lb/>
with interesting results. So he goes to work. To <lb/>
write a novel? No&mdash;that is a thought which comes <lb/>
later; in the beginning he is only proposing to tell <lb/>
a little tale; a very little tale; a six-page tale. But <lb/>
as it is a tale which he is not acquainted with, and <lb/>
can only find out what it is by listening as it goes <lb/>
along telling itself, it is more than apt to go on and <lb/>
on and on till it spreads itself into a book. I know <lb/>
about this, because it has happened to me so many <lb/>
times.</p>
<figure id="f515" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0314"/>
<pb n="310" entity="DSSR_000002495_0315"/>
<p>And I have noticed another thing: that as the <lb/>
short tale grows into the long tale, the original <reg orig="in-|tention">intention</reg> <lb/>
(or motif) is apt to get abolished and find <lb/>
itself superseded by a quite different one. It was <lb/>
so in the case of a magazine sketch which I once <lb/>
started to write&mdash;a funny and fantastic sketch about <lb/>
a prince and a pauper; it presently assumed a grave <lb/>
cast of its own accord, and in that new shape spread <lb/>
itself out into a book. Much the same thing <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg> <lb/>
with "Pudd'nhead Wilson." I had a <reg orig="suffi-|ciently">sufficiently</reg> <lb/>
hard time with that tale, because it changed <lb/>
itself from a farce to a tragedy while I was going <lb/>
along with it,&mdash;a most embarrassing circumstance. <lb/>
But what was a great deal worse was, that it was <lb/>
not one story, but two stories tangled together; <lb/>
and they obstructed and interrupted each other at <lb/>
every turn and created no end of confusion and <reg orig="an-|noyance">annoyance</reg>. <lb/>
I could not offer the book for publication, <lb/>
for I was afraid it would unseat the reader's reason, <lb/>
I did not know what was the matter with it, for I <lb/>
had not noticed, as yet, that it was two stories in <lb/>
one. It took me months to make that discovery. I <lb/>
carried the manuscript back and forth across the <lb/>
Atlantic two or three times, and read it and studied <lb/>
over it on shipboard; and at last I saw where the <lb/>
difficulty lay. I had no further trouble. I pulled <lb/>
one of the stories out by the roots, and left the other <lb/>
one&mdash;a kind of literary C&aelig;sarean operation.</p>
<figure id="f516" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0315"/>
<pb n="311" entity="DSSR_000002495_0316"/>
<p>Would the reader care to know something about <lb/>
the story which I pulled out? He has been told <lb/>
many a time how the born-and-trained novelist <lb/>
works; won't he let me round and complete his <lb/>
knowledge by telling him how the jack-leg does it?</p>
<p>Originally the story was called "Those <reg orig="Extraordi-|nary">Extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
Twins." I meant to make it very short. I <lb/>
had seen a picture of a youthful Italian "freak"&mdash; <lb/>
or "freaks"&mdash;which was&mdash;or which were&mdash;on <reg orig="ex-|hibition">exhibition</reg> <lb/>
in our cities&mdash;a combination consisting of <lb/>
two heads and four arms joined to a single body and <lb/>
a single pair of legs&mdash;and I thought I would write <lb/>
an extravagantly fantastic little story with this <lb/>
freak of nature for hero&mdash;or heroes&mdash;a silly young <lb/>
Miss for heroine, and two old ladies and two boys for <lb/>
the minor parts. I lavishly elaborated these people <lb/>
and their doings, of course. But the tale kept <lb/>
spreading along and spreading along, and other <reg orig="peo-|ple">people</reg> <lb/>
got to intruding themselves and taking up more <lb/>
and more room with their talk and their affairs. <lb/>
Among them came a stranger named Pudd'nhead <lb/>
Wilson, and a woman named Roxana; and presently <lb/>
the doings of these two pushed up into prominence <lb/>
a young fellow named Tom Driscoll, whose proper <lb/>
place was away in the obscure background. Before <lb/>
the book was half finished those three were taking <lb/>
things almost entirely into their own hands and <lb/>
working the whole tale as a private venture of their <lb/>
<figure id="f517" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0316"/>
<pb n="312" entity="DSSR_000002495_0317"/>
own&mdash;a tale which they had nothing at all to do <lb/>
with, by rights.</p>
<p>When the book was finished and I came to look <lb/>
around to see what had become of the team I had <lb/>
originally started out with&mdash;Aunt Patsy Cooper, <lb/>
Aunt Betsy Hale, the two boys, and Rowena the <lb/>
light-weight heroine&mdash;they were nowhere to be <lb/>
seen; they had disappeared from the story some <lb/>
time or other. I hunted about and found them&mdash; <lb/>
found them stranded, idle, forgotten, and <reg orig="perma-|nently">permanently</reg> <lb/>
useless. It was very awkward. It was <reg orig="awk-|ward">awkward</reg> <lb/>
all around, but more particularly in the case <lb/>
of Rowena, because there was a lovematch on, <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
her and one of the twins that constituted the <lb/>
freak, and I had worked it up to a blistering heat <lb/>
and thrown in a quite dramatic love-quarrel, wherein <lb/>
Rowena scathingly denounced her betrothed for <lb/>
getting drunk, and scoffed at his explanation of how <lb/>
it had happened, and wouldn't listen to it, and had <lb/>
driven him from her in the usual "forever" way; <lb/>
and now here she sat crying and broken-hearted; for <lb/>
she had found that he had spoken only the truth; <lb/>
that it was not he, but the other half of the freak <lb/>
that had drunk the liquor that made him drunk; <lb/>
that her half was a prohibitionist and had never <lb/>
drunk a drop in his life, and although tight as a <lb/>
brick three days in the week, was wholly innocent <lb/>
of blame; and indeed, when sober, was constantly <lb/>
<figure id="f518" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0317"/>
<pb n="313" entity="DSSR_000002495_0318"/>
doing all he could to reform his brother, the other <lb/>
half, who never got any satisfaction out of drinking, <lb/>
anyway, because liquor never affected him. Yes, <lb/>
here she was, stranded with that deep injustice of <lb/>
hers torturing her poor torn heart.</p>
<p>I didn't know what to do with her. I was as <lb/>
sorry for her as anybody could be, but the campaign <lb/>
was over, the book was finished, she was <reg orig="side-|tracked">sidetracked</reg>, <lb/>
and there was no possible way of crowding <lb/>
her in, anywhere. I could not leave her there, of <lb/>
course; it would not do. After spreading her out <lb/>
so, and making such a to-do over her affairs, it would <lb/>
be absolutely necessary to account to the reader for <lb/>
her. I thought and thought and studied and <lb/>
studied; but I arrived at nothing. I finally saw <lb/>
plainly that there was really no way but one&mdash;I <lb/>
must simply give her the grand bounce. It grieved <lb/>
me to do it, for after associating with her so much I <lb/>
had come to kind of like her after a fashion, <reg orig="notwith-|standing">notwithstanding</reg> <lb/>
she was such an ass and said such stupid, <lb/>
irritating things and was so nauseatingly sentimental. <lb/>
Still it had to be done. So at the top of Chapter <lb/>
XVII. I put a "Calendar" remark concerning July <lb/>
the Fourth, and began the chapter with this <reg orig="statis-|tic">statistic</reg>:</p>
<figure id="f519" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0318"/>
<p>"Rowena went out in the back yard after supper <lb/>
to see the fireworks and fell down the well and got <lb/>
drowned."</p>
<figure id="f520" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0318"/>
<pb n="314" entity="DSSR_000002495_0319"/>
<p>It seemed abrupt, but I thought maybe the reader <lb/>
wouldn't notice it, because I changed the subject <lb/>
right away to something else. Anyway it loosened <lb/>
up Rowena from where she was stuck and got her <lb/>
out of the way, and that was the main thing. It <lb/>
seemed a prompt good way of weeding out people <lb/>
that had got stalled, and a plenty good enough way <lb/>
for those others; so I hunted up the two boys and <lb/>
said "they went out back one night to stone the cat <lb/>
and fell down the well and got drowned." Next <lb/>
I searched around and found old Aunt Patsy Cooper <lb/>
and Aunt Betsy Hale where they were aground, <lb/>
and said "they went out back one night to visit the <lb/>
sick and fell down the well and got drowned." I <lb/>
was going to drown some of the others, but I gave <lb/>
up the idea, partly because I believed that if I kept <lb/>
that up it would arouse attention, and perhaps <reg orig="sym-|pathy">sympathy</reg> <lb/>
with those people, and partly because it was <lb/>
not a large well and would not hold any more <reg orig="any-|way">anyway</reg>.</p>
<figure id="f521" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0319"/>
<p>Still the story was unsatisfactory. Here was a set <lb/>
of new characters who were become inordinately <lb/>
prominent and who persisted in remaining so to the <lb/>
end; and back yonder was an older set who made <lb/>
a large noise and a great to-do for a little while and <lb/>
then suddenly played out utterly and fell down the <lb/>
well. There was a radical defect somewhere, and I <lb/>
must search it out and cure it.</p>
<pb n="315" entity="DSSR_000002495_0320"/>
<p>The defect turned out to be the one already <lb/>
spoken of&mdash;two stories in one, a farce and a tragedy. <lb/>
So I pulled out the farce and left the tragedy. This <lb/>
left the original team in, but only as mere names, <lb/>
not as characters. Their prominence was wholly <lb/>
gone; they were not even worth drowning; so I <reg orig="re-|moved">removed</reg> <lb/>
that detail. Also I took those twins apart <lb/>
and made two separate men of them. They had no <lb/>
occasion to have foreign names now, but it was too <lb/>
much trouble to remove them all through, so I left <lb/>
them christened as they were and made no <reg orig="explana-|tion">explanation</reg>.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> conglomerate twins were brought on <lb/>
the stage in Chapter I. of the original <reg orig="extrav-|aganza">extravaganza</reg>. <lb/>
Aunt Patsy Cooper has received <lb/>
their letter applying for board and lodging, <lb/>
and Rowena, her daughter, insane with joy, is <lb/>
begging for a hearing of it:</p>
<p>"Well, set down then, and be quiet a <reg orig="min-|ute">minute</reg> <lb/>
and don't fly around so; it fairly makes <lb/>
me tired to see you. It starts off so: <lb/>
'<hi rend="small-caps">Honored Madam</hi>&mdash;'"</p>
<p>"I like that, ma, don't you? It shows they're <lb/>
high-bred."</p>
<p>"Yes, I noticed that when I first read it. <lb/>
'My brother and I have seen your <reg orig="advertise-|ment">advertisement</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="318" entity="DSSR_000002495_0323"/>
by chance, in a copy of your local <lb/>
journal&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It's so beautiful and smooth, ma&mdash;don't <lb/>
you think so?"</p>
<p>"Yes, seems so to me&mdash;'and beg leave to <lb/>
take the room you offer. We are twenty-four <lb/>
years of age, and twins&mdash;'"</p>
<p>"Twins! How sweet! I do hope they <lb/>
are handsome, and I just know they are! <lb/>
Don't you hope they are, ma?"</p>
<p>"Land, I ain't particular. 'We are Italians <lb/>
by birth&mdash;'"</p>
<figure id="f523" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0323"/>
<p>"It's so romantic! Just think&mdash;there 's <lb/>
never been one in this town, and everybody <lb/>

Think of that!"</p>
<p>"&mdash;'but have lived long in the various <reg orig="coun-|tries">countries</reg> <lb/>
of Europe, and several years in the <lb/>

<p>"Oh, just think what wonders they 've seen, <lb/>
ma! Won't it be good to hear them talk?"</p>
<p>"I reckon so; yes, I reckon so. 'Our <lb/>
names are Luigi and Angelo Capello&mdash;'"</p>
<p>"Beautiful, perfectly beautiful! Not like <lb/>
Jones and Robinson and those horrible names."</p>
<pb n="319" entity="DSSR_000002495_0324"/>
<p>"'You desire but one guest, but dear <lb/>
madam, if you will allow us to pay for two we <lb/>
will not discommode you. We will sleep <lb/>
together in the same bed. We have always <lb/>
been used to this, and prefer it.' And then he <lb/>
goes on to say they will be down Thursday."</p>
<p>"And this is Tuesday&mdash;I don't know how <lb/>
I'm ever going to wait, ma! The time does <lb/>
drag along so, and I'm so dying to see them! <lb/>
Which of them do you reckon is the tallest, <lb/>

<p>"How do you s'pose I can tell, child? <lb/>
Mostly they are the same size&mdash;twins are."</p>
<p>"Well then, which do you reckon is the best <lb/>
looking?"</p>
<p>"Goodness knows&mdash;I don't."</p>
<p>"I think Angelo is; it 's the prettiest name, <lb/>
anyway. Don't you think it 's a sweet name, <lb/>
ma?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it 's well enough. I 'd like both of <lb/>
them better if I knew the way to pronounce <lb/>
them&mdash;the Eyetalian way, I mean. The <lb/>
Missouri way and the Eyetalian way is different <lb/>
I judge."</p>
<p>"Maybe&mdash;yes. It 's Luigi that writes the <lb/>

letter. What do you reckon is the reason <lb/>
Angelo did n't write it?"</p>
<p>"Why, how can I tell? What's the <reg orig="differ-|ence">difference</reg> <lb/>
who writes it, so long as it's done?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I hope it was n't because he is sick! <lb/>
You don't think he is sick, do you, ma?"</p>
<p>"Sick your granny; what's to make him <lb/>
sick?"</p>
<p>"Oh, there 's never any telling. These <lb/>
foreigners with that kind of names are so <lb/>
delicate, and of course that kind of names are <lb/>
not suited to our climate&mdash;you would n't <reg orig="ex-|pect">expect</reg> <lb/>
it."</p>
<p>[And so-on and so-on, no end. The time drags <lb/>
along; Thursday comes; the boat arrives in a <lb/>
pouring storm toward midnight.]</p>
<figure id="f525" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0325"/>
<p>At last there was a knock at the door and <lb/>
the anxious family jumped to open it. Two <lb/>
negro men entered, each carrying a trunk, and <lb/>
proceeded up-stairs toward the guest-room. <lb/>
Then followed a stupefying apparition&mdash;a <lb/>
double-headed human creature with four arms, <lb/>
one body, and a single pair of legs!</p>
<figure id="f526" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0325"/>
<p>It&mdash;or they, as you please&mdash;bowed with <lb/>
<pb n="321" entity="DSSR_000002495_0326"/>
elaborate foreign formality, but the Coopers <lb/>
could not respond immediately; they were <lb/>
paralyzed. At this moment there came from <lb/>
the rear of the group a fervent ejaculation&mdash; <lb/>
"My lan'!"&mdash;followed by a crash of crockery, <lb/>
and the slave-wench Nancy stood pertified and <lb/>
staring, with a tray of wrecked tea-things at <lb/>
her feet. The incident broke the spell, and <lb/>
brought the family to consciousness. The <lb/>
beautiful heads of the new-comer bowed again, <lb/>
and one of them said with easy grace and <lb/>
dignity:</p>
<p>"I crave the honor, madam and miss, to <lb/>
introduce to you my brother, Count Luigi <lb/>
Capello," (the other head bowed) "and <reg orig="my-|self&mdash;Count">myself&mdash;Count</reg> <lb/>
Angelo; and at the same time <lb/>
offer sincere apologies for the lateness of our <lb/>
coming, which was unavoidable," and both <lb/>
heads bowed again.</p>
<p>The poor old lady was in a whirl of <reg orig="amaze-|ment">amazement</reg> <lb/>
and confusion, but she managed to <reg orig="stam-|mer">stammer</reg> <lb/>
out:</p>
<p>"I'm sure I'm glad to make your <reg orig="acquaint-|ance">acquaintance</reg>, <lb/>
sir&mdash;I mean, gentlemen. As for the <lb/>
delay, it is nothing, don't mention it. This <lb/>
<figure id="f527" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0326"/>
<pb n="322" entity="DSSR_000002495_0327"/>
is my daughter Rowena, sir&mdash;gentlemen. <lb/>
Please step into the parlor and sit down and <lb/>
have a bite and sup; you are dreadful wet <lb/>
and must be uncomfortable&mdash;both of you, I <lb/>
mean."</p>
<p>But to the old lady's relief they courteously <lb/>
excused themselves, saying it would be wrong <lb/>
to keep the family out of their beds longer; <lb/>
then each head bowed in turn and uttered a <lb/>
friendly good-night, and the singular figure <lb/>
moved away in the wake of Rowena's small <lb/>
brothers, who bore candles, and disappeared <lb/>
up the stairs.</p>
<p>The widow tottered into the parlor and <lb/>
sank into a chair with a gasp, and Rowena <lb/>
followed, tongue-tied and dazed. The two sat <lb/>
silent in the throbbing summer heat <reg orig="uncon-|scious">unconscious</reg> <lb/>
of the million-voiced music of the <reg orig="mos-|quitoes">mosquitoes</reg>, <lb/>
unconscious of the roaring gale, the <lb/>
lashing and thrashing of the rain along the <reg orig="win-|dows">windows</reg> <lb/>
and the roof, the white glare of the <reg orig="light-|ning">lightning</reg>, <lb/>
the tumultuous booming and bellowing of <lb/>
the thunder; conscious of nothing but that <reg orig="pro-|digy">prodigy</reg>, <lb/>
that uncanny apparition that had come <lb/>
and gone so suddenly&mdash;that weird strange thing <lb/>
<figure id="f528" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0327"/>
<pb n="323" entity="DSSR_000002495_0328"/>
that was so soft-spoken and so gentle of <reg orig="man-|ner">manner</reg> <lb/>
and yet had shaken them up like an <reg orig="earth-|quake">earthquake</reg> <lb/>
with the shock of its gruesome aspect. <lb/>
At last a cold little shudder quivered along <lb/>
down the widow's meager frame and she said <lb/>
in a weak voice:</p>
<p>"Ugh, it was awful&mdash;just the mere look of <lb/>
that phillipene!"</p>
<p>Rowena did not answer. Her faculties were <lb/>
still caked, she had not yet found her voice. <lb/>
Presently the widow said, a little resentfully:</p>
<p>"Always been <hi rend="italic">used</hi> to sleeping together&mdash; <lb/>
in fact, <hi rend="italic">prefer</hi> it. And I was thinking it <lb/>
was to accommodate me. I thought it was <lb/>
very good of them, whereas a person situated <lb/>
as that young man is&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ma, you ought n't to begin by getting up <lb/>
a prejudice against him. I'm sure he is <reg orig="good-|hearted">goodhearted</reg> <lb/>
and means well. Both of his faces <lb/>
show it."</p>
<p>"I'm not so certain about that. The one on <lb/>
the left&mdash;I mean the one on <hi rend="italic">it's</hi> left&mdash;has n't <lb/>
near as good a face, in my opinion, as its <lb/>
brother."</p>
<p>"That's Luigi."</p>
<figure id="f529" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0328"/>
<pb n="324" entity="DSSR_000002495_0329"/>
<p>"Yes, Luigi; anyway it's the dark-skinned <lb/>
one; the one that was west of his brother <lb/>
when they stood in the door. Up to all kinds <lb/>
of mischief and disobedience when he was a <lb/>
boy, I 'll be bound. I lay his mother had <lb/>
trouble to lay her hand on him when she <lb/>
wanted him. But the one on the right is as <lb/>
good as gold, I can see that."</p>
<figure id="f530" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0329"/>
<p>"That's Angelo."</p>
<p>"Yes, Angelo, I reckon, though I can't tell <lb/>
t' other from which by their names, yet awhile. <lb/>
But it's the right-hand one&mdash;the blonde one. <lb/>
He has such kind blue eyes, and curly <reg orig="cop-|per">copper</reg> <lb/>
hair and fresh complexion&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And such a noble face!&mdash;oh, it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a noble <lb/>
face, ma, just royal, you may say! And <lb/>
beautiful&mdash;deary me, how beautiful! But <lb/>
both are that; the dark one's as beautiful as <lb/>
a picture. There's no such wonderful faces <lb/>
and handsome heads in this town&mdash;none that <lb/>
even begin. And such hands&mdash;especially <lb/>
Angelo's&mdash;so shapely and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Stuff, how could you tell which they <reg orig="be-|longed">belonged</reg> <lb/>
to?&mdash;they had gloves on."</p>

<p>Why, did n't I see them take off their <lb/>
hats?"</p>
<p>"That don't signify. They might have <lb/>
taken off each other's hats. Nobody could <lb/>
tell. There was just a wormy squirming of <lb/>
arms in the air&mdash;seemed to be a couple of <lb/>
dozen of them, all writhing at once, and it <lb/>
just made me dizzy to see them go."</p>
<p>"Why, ma, I had n't any difficulty. There's <lb/>
two arms on each shoulder&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There, now. One arm on each shoulder <lb/>
belongs to each of the creatures, don't it? <lb/>
For a person to have two arms on one <lb/>
shoulder would n't do him any good, would <lb/>
it? Of course not. Each has an arm on <lb/>
each shoulder. Now then, you tell me which <lb/>
of them belongs to which, if you can. <hi rend="italic">They</hi> <lb/>
don't know, themselves&mdash;they just work <reg orig="which-|ever">whichever</reg> <lb/>
arm comes handy. Of course they do; <lb/>
especially if they are in a hurry and can't <lb/>
stop to think which belongs to which."</p>
<p>The mother seemed to have the rights of <lb/>
the argument, so the daughter abandoned the <lb/>
struggle. Presently the widow rose with a <lb/>
yawn and said:</p>
<figure id="f532" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0330"/>
<pb n="326" entity="DSSR_000002495_0331"/>
<p>"Poor thing, I hope it won't catch cold; it <lb/>
was powerful wet, just drenched, you may say. <lb/>
I hope it has left its boots outside, so they <lb/>
can be dried." Then she gave a little start, <lb/>
and looked perplexed. "Now I remember I <lb/>
heard one of them ask Joe to call him at half <lb/>
after seven&mdash;I think it was the one on the left <lb/>
&mdash;no, it was the one to the east of the other <lb/>
one&mdash;but I did n't hear the other one say <lb/>
anything. I wonder if he wants to be called <lb/>
too. Do you reckon it's too late to ask?"</p>
<p>"Why, ma, it's not necessary. Calling <lb/>
one is calling both. If one gets up, the <lb/>
other's <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to."</p>
<p>"Sho, of course; I never thought of that. <lb/>
Well, come along, maybe we can get some <lb/>
sleep, but I don't know, I'm so shook up with <lb/>
what we've been through."</p>
<p>The stranger had made an impression on <lb/>
the boys, too. They had a word of talk as <lb/>
they were getting to bed. Henry, the gentle, <lb/>
the humane, said:</p>
<figure id="f533" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0331"/>
<p>"I feel ever so sorry for it, don't you, Joe?"</p>
<p>But Joe was a boy of this world, active, <lb/>
enterprising, and had a theatrical side to him:</p>
<figure id="f534" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0331"/>
<pb n="327" entity="DSSR_000002495_0332"/>
<p>"Sorry? Why, how you talk! It can't <lb/>
stir a step without attracting attention. It's <lb/>
just grand!"</p>
<p>Henry said, reproachfully:</p>
<p>"Instead of pitying it, Joe, you talk as <lb/>
if&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Talk as if <hi rend="italic">what?</hi> I know one thing <lb/>
mighty certain: if you can fix me so I can eat <lb/>
for two and only have to stub toes for one, I <lb/>
ain't going to fool away no such chance just <lb/>
for sentiment."</p>
<p>The twins were wet and tired, and they <reg orig="pro-|ceeded">proceeded</reg> <lb/>
to undress without any preliminary <lb/>
remarks. The abundance of sleeves made <lb/>
the partnership-coat hard to get off, for it <lb/>
was like skinning a tarantula; but it came at <lb/>
last, after much tugging and perspiring. The <lb/>
mutual vest followed. Then the brothers <lb/>
stood up before the glass, and each took off <lb/>
his own cravat and collar. The collars were <lb/>
of the standing kind, and came high up under <lb/>
the ears, like the sides of a wheelbarrow, as <lb/>
required by the fashion of the day. The <lb/>
cravats were as broad as a bank bill, with <lb/>
fringed ends which stood far out to right and <lb/>
<figure id="f535" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0332"/>
<pb n="328" entity="DSSR_000002495_0333"/>
left like the wings of a dragon-fly, and this <lb/>
also was strictly in accordance with the <reg orig="fash-|ion">fashion</reg> <lb/>
of the time. Each cravat, as to color, was <lb/>
in perfect taste, so far as its owner's <reg orig="com-|plexion">complexion</reg> <lb/>
was concerned&mdash;a delicate pink, in <lb/>
the case of the blonde brother, a violent <lb/>
scarlet in the case of the brunette&mdash;but as a <lb/>
combination they broke all the laws of taste <lb/>
known to civilization. Nothing more fiendish <lb/>
and irreconcilable than those shrieking and <lb/>
blaspheming colors could have been contrived. <lb/>
The wet boots gave no end of trouble&mdash;to <lb/>
Luigi. When they were off at last, Angelo <lb/>
said, with bitterness:</p>
<p>"I wish you would n't wear such tight <lb/>
boots, they hurt my feet."</p>
<figure id="f536" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0333"/>
<p>Luigi answered with indifference:</p>
<p>"My friend, when I am in command of our <lb/>
body, I choose my apparel according to my <lb/>
own convenience, as I have remarked more <lb/>
than several times already. When you are in <lb/>
command, I beg you will do as you please."</p>
<p>Angelo was hurt, and the tears came into <lb/>
his eyes. There was gentle reproach in his <lb/>
voice, but not anger, when he replied:</p>
<pb n="329" entity="DSSR_000002495_0334"/>
<p>"Luigi, I often consult your wishes, but <lb/>
you never consult mine. When I am in <reg orig="com-|mand">command</reg> <lb/>
I treat you as a guest; I try to make <lb/>
you feel at home; when you are in command <lb/>
you treat me as an intruder, you make me <lb/>
feel unwelcome. It embarrasses me cruelly <lb/>
in company, for I can see that people notice it <lb/>
and comment on it."</p>
<p>"Oh, damn the people," responded the <lb/>
brother languidly, and with the air of one who <lb/>
is tired of the subject.</p>
<p>A slight shudder shook the frame of Angelo, <lb/>
but he said nothing and the conversation <lb/>
ceased. Each buttoned his own share of the <lb/>
night-shirt in silence; then Luigi, with Paine's <lb/>
"Age of Reason" in his hand, sat down in <lb/>
one chair and put his feet in another and lit <lb/>
his pipe, while Angelo took his "Whole <lb/>
Duty of Man," and both began to read. <lb/>
Angelo presently began to cough; his <reg orig="cough-|ing">coughing</reg> <lb/>
increased and became mixed with gaspings <lb/>
for breath, and he was finally obliged to make <lb/>
an appeal to his brother's humanity:</p>
<p>"Luigi, if you would only smoke a little <lb/>
milder tobacco, I am sure I could learn not to <lb/>
<figure id="f537" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0334"/>
<pb n="330" entity="DSSR_000002495_0335"/>
mind it in time, but this is so strong, and the <lb/>
pipe is so rank that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Angelo. I would n't be such a baby! I <lb/>
have learned to smoke in a week, and the <lb/>
trouble is already over with me; if you would <lb/>
try, you could learn too, and then you would <lb/>
stop spoiling my comfort with your everlasting <lb/>
complaints."</p>
<p>"Ah, brother, that is a strong <reg orig="word&mdash;ever-|lasting&mdash;and">word&mdash;everlasting&mdash;and</reg> <lb/>
is n't quite fair. I only complain <lb/>
when I suffocate; you know I don't complain <lb/>
when we are in the open air."</p>
<p>"Well, anyway, you could learn to smoke <lb/>
yourself."</p>
<p>"But my <hi rend="italic">principles,</hi> Luigi, you forget my <lb/>
principles. You would not have me do a <lb/>
thing which I regard as a sin?"</p>
<p>"Oh, bosh!"</p>
<figure id="f538" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0335"/>
<p>The conversation ceased again, for Angelo <lb/>
was sick and discouraged and strangling; but <lb/>
after some time he closed his book and asked <lb/>
Luigi to sing "From Greenland's Icy <reg orig="Moun-|tains">Mountains</reg>" <lb/>
with him, but he would not, and when <lb/>
he tried to sing by himself Luigi did his best <lb/>
to drown his plaintive tenor with a rude and <lb/>
<pb n="331" entity="DSSR_000002495_0336"/>
rollicking song delivered in a thundering <lb/>
bass.</p>
<p>After the singing there was silence, and <lb/>
neither brother was happy. Before blowing <lb/>
the light out Luigi swallowed half a tumbler <lb/>
of whiskey, and Angelo, whose sensitive <reg orig="or-|ganization">organization</reg> <lb/>
could not endure intoxicants of any <lb/>
kind, took a pill to keep it from giving him <lb/>
the headache.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> family sat in the breakfast-room <reg orig="wait-|ing">waiting</reg> <lb/>
for the twins to come down. The widow <lb/>
was quiet, the daughter was all alive with <lb/>
happy excitement. She said:</p>
<p>"Ah, they 're a boon, ma, just a boon! <lb/>
don't you think so?"</p>
<p>"Laws, I hope so, I don't know."</p>
<p>"Why, ma, yes you do. They 're so fine <lb/>
and handsome, and high-bred and polite, so <lb/>
every way superior to our gawks here in this <lb/>
village; why, they 'll make life different from <lb/>
what it was&mdash;so humdrum and commonplace, <lb/>
you know&mdash;oh, you may be sure they 're full <lb/>
of accomplishments, and knowledge of the <lb/>
world, and all that, that will be an immense <lb/>
advantage to society here. Don't you think <lb/>
so, ma?"</p>
<p>"Mercy on me, how should I know, and <lb/>
<figure id="f540" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0337"/>
<pb n="333" entity="DSSR_000002495_0338"/>
I've hardly set eyes on them yet." After a <lb/>
pause she added, "They made considerable <lb/>
noise after they went up."</p>
<p>"Noise? Why, ma, they were singing! <lb/>
And it was beautiful, too."</p>
<p>"Oh, it was well enough, but too mixed-up, <lb/>
seemed to me."</p>
<p>"Now, ma, honor bright, did you ever hear <lb/>
'Greenland's Icy Mountains' sung sweeter&mdash; <lb/>
now did you?"</p>
<p>"If it had been sung by itself, it would <lb/>
have been uncommon sweet, I don't deny it; <lb/>
but what they wanted to mix it up with 'Old <lb/>
Bob Ridley' for, I can't make out. Why, they <lb/>
don't go together, at all. They are not of the <lb/>
same nature. 'Bob Ridley' is a common <lb/>
rackety slam-bang secular song, one of the <lb/>
rippingest and rantingest and noisiest there is. <lb/>
I am no judge of music, and I don't claim it, <lb/>
but in my opinion nobody can make those two <lb/>
songs go together right."</p>
<p>"Why, ma, I thought&mdash;"</p>
<figure id="f541" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0338"/>
<p>"It don't make any difference what you <lb/>
thought, it can't be done. They tried it, and <lb/>
to my mind it was a failure. I never heard <lb/>
<figure id="f542" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0338"/>
<pb n="334" entity="DSSR_000002495_0339"/>
such a crazy uproar; seemed to me, sometimes, <lb/>
the roof would come off; and as for the cats <lb/>
&mdash;well, I 've lived a many a year, and seen <lb/>
cats aggravated in more ways than one, but <lb/>
I 've never seen cats take on the way they took <lb/>
on last night."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't think that that goes for <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg>, <lb/>
ma, because it is the nature of cats that <lb/>
any sound that is unusual&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Unusual! You may well call it so. Now <lb/>
if they are going to sing duets every night, I <lb/>
do hope they will both sing the same tune at <lb/>
the same time, for in my opinion a duet that <lb/>
is made up of two different tunes is a mistake; <lb/>
especially when the tunes ain't any kin to one <lb/>
another, that way."</p>
<p>"But, ma, I think it must be a foreign <reg orig="cus-|tom">custom</reg>; <lb/>
and it must be right too, and the best <lb/>
way, because they have had every opportunity <lb/>
to know what is right, and it don't stand to <lb/>
reason that with their education they would <lb/>
do anything but what the highest musical <reg orig="au-|thorities">authorities</reg> <lb/>
have sanctioned. You can't help <lb/>
but admit that, ma."</p>
<p>The argument was formidably strong; <lb/>
<figure id="f543" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0339"/>
<pb n="335" entity="DSSR_000002495_0340"/>
the old lady could not find any way around it; <lb/>
so, after thinking it over a while she gave in <lb/>
with a sigh of discontent, and admitted that <lb/>
the daughter's position was probably correct. <lb/>
Being vanquished, she had no mind to continue <lb/>
the topic at that disadvantage, and was about <lb/>
to seek a change when a change came of itself. <lb/>
A footstep was heard on the stairs, and she <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"There&mdash;he 's coming!"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">They,</hi> ma&mdash;you ought to say <hi rend="italic">they</hi>&mdash;it 's <lb/>
nearer right."</p>
<p>The new lodger, rather shoutingly dressed <lb/>
but looking superbly handsome, stepped with <lb/>
courtly carriage into the trim little <reg orig="breakfast-|room">breakfast-room</reg> <lb/>
and put out all his cordial arms at once, <lb/>
like one of those pocket-knives with a <reg orig="multi-|plicity">multiplicity</reg> <lb/>
of blades, and shook hands with the <lb/>
whole family simultaneously. He was so easy <lb/>
and pleasant and hearty that all embarrassment <lb/>
presently thawed away and disappeared, and <lb/>
a cheery feeling of friendliness and <reg orig="comrade-|ship">comradeship</reg> <lb/>
took its place. He&mdash;or preferably they <lb/>
&mdash;were asked to occupy the seat of honor at <lb/>
the foot of the table. They consented with <lb/>
<figure id="f544" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0340"/>
<pb n="336" entity="DSSR_000002495_0341"/>
thanks, and carved the beefsteak with one set <lb/>
of their hands while they distributed it at the <lb/>
same time with the other set.</p>
<p>"Will you have coffee, gentlemen, or tea?"</p>
<p>"Coffee for Luigi, if you please, madam, <lb/>
tea for me."</p>
<p>"Cream and sugar?"</p>
<p>"For me, yes, madam; Luigi takes his <lb/>
coffee black. Our natures differ a good deal <lb/>
from each other, and our tastes also."</p>
<p>The first time the negro girl Nancy <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
in the door and saw the two heads <lb/>
turned in opposite directions and both talking <lb/>
at once, then saw the commingling arms feed <lb/>
potatoes into one mouth and coffee into the <lb/>
other at the same time, she had to pause and <lb/>
pull herself out of a faintness that came over <lb/>
her; but after that she held her grip and <lb/>
was able to wait on the table with fair <reg orig="cour-|age">courage</reg>.</p>
<figure id="f545" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0341"/>
<p>Conversation fell naturally into the <reg orig="custom-|ary">customary</reg> <lb/>
grooves. It was a little jerky, at first, <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
none of the family could get smoothly <lb/>
through a sentence without a wobble in it <lb/>
here and a break there, caused by some new <lb/>
<figure id="f546" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0341"/>
<pb n="337" entity="DSSR_000002495_0342"/>
surprise in the way of attitude or gesture on <lb/>
the part of the twins. The weather suffered <lb/>
the most. The weather was all finished up <lb/>
and disposed of, as a subject, before the <reg orig="sim-|ple">simple</reg> <lb/>
Missourians had gotten sufficiently wonted <lb/>
to the spectacle of one body feeding two <lb/>
heads to feel composed and reconciled in the <lb/>
presence of so bizarre a miracle. And even <lb/>
after everybody's mind became tranquilized <lb/>
where was still one slight distraction left: the <lb/>
hand that picked up a biscuit carried it to the <lb/>
wrong head, as often as any other way, and <lb/>
the wrong mouth devoured it. This was a <lb/>
puzzling thing, and marred the talk a little. <lb/>
It bothered the widow to such a degree that <lb/>
she presently dropped out of the conversation <lb/>
without knowing it, and fell to watching and <lb/>
guessing and talking to herself:</p>
<figure id="f547" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0342"/>
<p>"Now that hand is going to take that <lb/>
coffee to&mdash;no, it 's gone to the other mouth; <lb/>
I can't understand it; and now, here is the <lb/>
dark complected hand with a potato on its <lb/>
fork, I'll see what goes with it&mdash;there, the <lb/>
light complected head 's got it, as sure as I <lb/>
live!" Finally Rowena said:</p>
<figure id="f548" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0342"/>
<pb n="338" entity="DSSR_000002495_0343"/>
<p>"Ma, what is the matter with you? Are <lb/>
you dreaming about something?"</p>
<p>The old lady came to herself and blushed; <lb/>
then she explained with the first random thing <lb/>
that came into her mind: "I saw Mr. <reg orig="An-|gelo">Angelo</reg> <lb/>
take up Mr. Luigi's coffee, and I thought <lb/>
maybe he&mdash;sha' n't I give <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a cup, Mr. <reg orig="An-|gelo">Angelo</reg>?"</p>
<p>"Oh no, madam, I am very much obliged, <lb/>
but I never drink coffee, much as I would like <lb/>
to. You did see me take up Luigi's cup, it is <lb/>
true, but if you noticed, I didn't carry it to <lb/>
my mouth, but to his."</p>
<p>"Y&mdash;es, I thought you did. Did you mean <lb/>
to?"</p>
<figure id="f549" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0343"/>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>The widow was a little embarrassed again. <lb/>
She said:</p>
<p>"I don't know but what I'm foolish, and <lb/>
you must n't mind; but you see, he got the <lb/>
coffee I was expecting to see you drink, and <lb/>
you got a potato that I thought he was going <lb/>
to get. So I thought it might be a <reg orig="mis-|take">mistake</reg> <lb/>
all around, and everybody getting what <lb/>
was n't intended for him."</p>
<figure id="f550" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0343"/>
<pb n="339" entity="DSSR_000002495_0344"/>
<p>Both twins laughed and Luigi said:</p>
<p>"Dear madam, there was n't any mistake. <lb/>
We are always helping each other that way. <lb/>
It is a great economy for us both; it saves <lb/>
time and labor. We have a system of signs <lb/>
which nobody can notice or understand but <lb/>
ourselves. If I am using both my hands and <lb/>
want some coffee, I make the sign and Angelo <lb/>
furnishes it to me; and you saw that when he <lb/>
needed a potato I delivered it."</p>
<figure id="f551" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0344"/>
<p>"How convenient!"</p>
<p>"Yes, and often of the extremest value. <lb/>
Take the Mississippi boats, for instance. They <lb/>
are always over-crowded. There is table-room <lb/>
for only half of the passengers, therefore they <lb/>
have to set a second table for the second half. <lb/>
The stewards rush both parties, they give <lb/>
them no time to eat a satisfying meal, both <lb/>
divisions leave the table hungry. It is n't so <lb/>
with us. Angelo books himself for the one <lb/>
table, I book myself for the other. Neither of <lb/>
us eats anything at the other's table, but <lb/>
just simply works&mdash;works. Thus, you see <lb/>
there are four hands to feed Angelo, and the <lb/>
<figure id="f552" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0344"/>
<pb n="340" entity="DSSR_000002495_0345"/>
same four to feed me. Each of us eats two <lb/>
meals."</p>
<p>The old lady was dazed with admiration, <lb/>
and kept saying, "It is <hi rend="italic">per</hi>fectly wonderful, <lb/>
perfectly wonderful!" and the boy Joe licked <lb/>
his chops enviously, but said nothing&mdash;at <lb/>
least aloud.</p>
<p>"Yes," continued Luigi, "our construction <lb/>
may have its disadvantages&mdash;in fact, <hi rend="italic">has</hi>&mdash;but <lb/>
it also has its compensations, of one sort and <lb/>
another. Take travel, for instance. Travel <lb/>
is enormously expensive, in all countries; we <lb/>
have been obliged to do a vast deal of it&mdash;come, <lb/>
Angelo, don't put any more sugar in your tea, <lb/>
I'm just over one indigestion and don't want <lb/>
another right away&mdash;been obliged to do a deal <lb/>
of it, as I was saying. Well, we always travel <lb/>
as one person, since we occupy but one seat; <lb/>
so we save half the fare."</p>
<figure id="f553" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0345"/>
<p>"How romantic!" interjected Rowena, with <lb/>
effusion.</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear young lady, and how <reg orig="practi-|cal">practical</reg> <lb/>
too, and economical. In Europe, beds in <lb/>
the hotels are not charged with the board, but <lb/>
separately&mdash;another saving, for we stood to <lb/>
<figure id="f554" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0345"/>
<pb n="341" entity="DSSR_000002495_0346"/>
our rights and paid for the one bed only. The <lb/>
landlords often insisted that as both of us <reg orig="oc-|cupied">occupied</reg> <lb/>
the bed we ought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, they did n't," said Angelo. "They <lb/>
did it only twice, and in both cases it was a <lb/>
double bed&mdash;a rare thing in Europe&mdash;and the <lb/>
double bed gave them some excuse. Be fair to <lb/>
the landlords; twice does n't constitute 'often.'"</p>
<p>"Well, that depends&mdash;that depends. I <lb/>
knew a man who fell down a well twice. He <lb/>
said he did n't mind the first time, but he <lb/>
thought the second time was once too often. <lb/>
Have I misused that word, Mrs. Cooper?"</p>
<p>"To tell the truth, I was afraid you had, <lb/>
but it seems to look, now, like you had n't." <lb/>
She stopped, and was evidently struggling <lb/>
with the difficult problem a moment, then she <lb/>
added in the tone of one who is convinced <lb/>
without being converted, "It seems so, but <lb/>
I can't somehow tell why."</p>
<figure id="f555" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0346"/>
<p>Rowena thought Luigi's retort was <reg orig="wonder-|fully">wonderfully</reg> <lb/>
quick and bright, and she remarked to <lb/>
herself with satisfaction that there was n't any <lb/>
young native of Dawson's Landing that could <lb/>
have risen to the occasion like that. Luigi <lb/>
<figure id="f556" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0346"/>
<pb n="342" entity="DSSR_000002495_0347"/>
detected the applause in her face, and <reg orig="ex-|pressed">expressed</reg> <lb/>
his pleasure and his thanks with his <lb/>
eyes; and so eloquently withal, that the girl <lb/>
was proud and pleased, and hung out the <reg orig="deli-|cate">delicate</reg> <lb/>
sign of it on her cheeks.</p>
<p>Luigi went on, with animation:</p>
<p>"Both of us get a bath for one ticket, theater <lb/>
seat for one ticket, pew-rent is on the same <lb/>
basis, but at peep-shows we pay double."</p>
<p>"We have much to be thankful for," said <lb/>
Angelo, impressively, with a reverent light in <lb/>
his eye and a reminiscent tone in his voice, <lb/>
"we have been greatly blessed. As a rule, <lb/>
what one of us has lacked, the other, by the <lb/>
bounty of Providence, has been able to supply. <lb/>
My brother is hardy, I am not; he is very <lb/>
masculine, assertive, aggressive; I am much <lb/>
less so. I am subject to illness, he is never <lb/>
ill. I cannot abide medicines, and cannot take <lb/>
them, but he has no prejudice against them, <lb/>
and&mdash;"</p>
<figure id="f557" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0347"/>
<p>"Why, goodness gracious," interrupted the <lb/>

medicine for you?"</p>
<p>"Always, madam."</p>

<p>"Why, I never heard such a thing in my <lb/>
life! I think it's beautiful of you."</p>
<p>"Oh, madam, it's nothing, don't mention it, <lb/>
it's really nothing at all."</p>
<p>"But I say it's beautiful, and I stick to it!" <lb/>
cried the widow, with a speaking moisture in <lb/>
her eye. "A well brother to take the <reg orig="medi-|cine">medicine</reg> <lb/>
for his poor sick brother&mdash;I wish I had <lb/>
such a son," and she glanced reproachfully at <lb/>
her boys. "I declare I'll never rest till I've <lb/>
shook you by the hand," and she scrambled <lb/>
out of her chair in a fever of generous <reg orig="enthu-|siasm">enthusiasm</reg>, <lb/>
and made for the twins, blind with her <lb/>
tears, and began to shake. The boy Joe <reg orig="cor-|rected">corrected</reg> <lb/>
her:</p>
<p>"You're shaking the wrong one, ma."</p>
<p>This flurried her, but she made a swift <lb/>
change and went on shaking.</p>
<p>"Got the wrong one again ma," said the <lb/>
boy.</p>
<p>"Oh, shut up, can't you!" said the widow, <lb/>
embarrassed and irritated. "Give me <hi rend="italic">all</hi> <lb/>
your hands, I want to shake them all; for I <lb/>
know you are both just as good as you can <lb/>
be."</p>

<p>It was a victorious thought, a master-stroke <lb/>
of diplomacy, though, that never occurred to <lb/>
her and she cared nothing for diplomacy. She <lb/>
shook the four hands in turn cordially, and <lb/>
went back to her place in a state of high and <lb/>
fine exaltation that made her look young and <lb/>
handsome.</p>
<figure id="f561" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0349"/>
<p>"Indeed I owe everything to Luigi," said <lb/>
Angelo, affectionately. "But for him I could <lb/>
not have survived our boyhood days, when we <lb/>
were friendless and poor&mdash;ah, so poor! We <lb/>
lived from hand to mouth&mdash;lived on the coarse <lb/>
fare of unwilling charity, and for weeks and <lb/>
weeks together not a morsel of food passed my <lb/>
lips, for its character revolted me and I could <lb/>
not eat it. But for Luigi I should have <lb/>
died. He ate for us both."</p>
<p>"How noble!" sighed Rowena.</p>
<p>"Do you hear that?" said the widow, <reg orig="se-|verely">severely</reg>, <lb/>
to her boys. "Let it be an example to <lb/>
you&mdash;I mean you, Joe."</p>
<p>Joe gave his head a barely perceptible <lb/>
disparaging toss and said: "Et for both. It <lb/>
ain't anything&mdash;I'd a done it."</p>
<p>"Hush, if you have n't got any better <reg orig="man-|ners">manners</reg> <lb/>
<figure id="f562" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0349"/>
<pb n="345" entity="DSSR_000002495_0350"/>
than that. You don't see the point at <lb/>
all. It was n't good food."</p>
<p>"I don't care&mdash;it was food, and I 'd 'a et it <lb/>
if it was rotten."</p>
<p>"Shame! Such language! Can't you <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg>? <lb/>
They were starving&mdash;actually starving <lb/>
&mdash;and he ate for both, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Shucks! you gimme a chance and I'll&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There, now&mdash;close your head! and don't <lb/>
you open it again till you're asked."</p>
<p>[Angelo goes on and tells how his parents the Count and <lb/>
Countess had to fly from Florence for political reasons, <lb/>
and died poor in Berlin bereft of their great property by <lb/>
confiscation; and how he and Luigi had to travel with a <lb/>
freak-show during two years and suffer semi-starvation.]</p>
<figure id="f563" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0350"/>
<p>"That hateful black-bread! but I seldom <lb/>
ate anything during that time; that was poor <lb/>
Luigi's affair&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I'll never <hi rend="italic">Mister</hi> him again!" cried the <lb/>
widow, with strong emotion, "he's Luigi to <lb/>
me, from this out!"</p>
<p>"Thank you a thousand times, madam, a <lb/>
thousand times! though in truth I don't <lb/>
deserve it."</p>
<p>"Ah, Luigi is always the fortunate one <lb/>

when honors are showering," said Angelo, <lb/>
plaintively, "now what have I done, Mrs. <lb/>
Cooper, that you leave me out? Come, you <lb/>
must strain a point in my favor."</p>
<p>"Call you Angelo? Why, certainly I will; <lb/>
what are you thinking of! In the case of <lb/>
twins, why&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But, ma, you're breaking up the story&mdash; <lb/>
do let him go on."</p>
<p>"You keep still, Rowena Cooper, and he <lb/>
can go on all the better, I reckon. One <lb/>
interruption don't hurt, it's two that makes <lb/>
the trouble."</p>
<p>"But you've added one, now, and that is <lb/>
three."</p>
<p>"Rowena! I will not allow you to talk <lb/>
back at me when you have got nothing <lb/>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p>[After breakfast the whole village crowded in, and there <lb/>
was a grand reception in honor of the twins; and at the <lb/>
close of it the gifted "freak" captured everybody's <reg orig="admi-|ration">admiration</reg> <lb/>
by sitting down at the piano and knocking out a <lb/>
classic four-handed piece in great style. Then the Judge <lb/>
took it&mdash;or them&mdash;driving in his buggy and showed off <lb/>
his village.]</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">All</hi> along the streets the people crowded the <lb/>
windows and stared at the amazing twins. <lb/>
Troops of small boys flocked after the buggy, <lb/>
excited and yelling. At first the dogs showed <lb/>
no interest. They thought they merely saw <lb/>
three men in a buggy&mdash;a matter of no <reg orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg>; <lb/>
but when they found out the facts of <lb/>
the case, they altered their opinion pretty <lb/>
radically, and joined the boys, expressing their <lb/>
minds as they came. Other dogs got <reg orig="inter-|ested">interested</reg>; <lb/>
indeed all the dogs. It was a spirited <lb/>
sight to see them come leaping fences, tearing <lb/>
around corners, swarming out of every <reg orig="by-|street">by-street</reg> <lb/>
<figure id="f566" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0352"/>
<pb n="348" entity="DSSR_000002495_0353"/>
and alley. The noise they made was <lb/>
something beyond belief&mdash;or praise. They <lb/>
did not seem to be moved by malice but only <lb/>
by prejudice, the common human prejudice <lb/>
against lack of conformity. If the twins <lb/>
turned their heads, they broke and fled in <lb/>
every direction, but stopped at a safe distance <lb/>
and faced about; and then formed and came <lb/>
on again as soon as the strangers showed <lb/>
them their back. Negroes and farmers' <lb/>
wives took to the woods when the buggy came <lb/>
upon them suddenly, and altogether the drive <lb/>
was pleasant and animated, and a refreshment <lb/>
all around.</p>
<p>[It was a long and lively drive. Angelo was a <reg orig="Meth-|odist">Methodist</reg>, <lb/>
Luigi was a Freethinker. The Judge was very <lb/>
proud of his Freethinker Society, which was flourishing <lb/>
along in a most prosperous way and already had two <lb/>
members&mdash;himself and the obscure and neglected <reg orig="Pudd'n-|head">Pudd'nhead</reg> <lb/>
Wilson. It was to meet that evening, and he invited <lb/>
Luigi to join; a thing which Luigi was glad to do, <lb/>
partly because it would please himself, and partly <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
it would gravel Angelo.]</p>
<p>They had now arrived at the widow's gate, <lb/>
and the excursion was ended. The twins <reg orig="po-|litely">politely</reg> <lb/>
expressed their obligations for the <reg orig="pleas-|ant">pleasant</reg> <lb/>
<figure id="f567" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0353"/>
<pb n="349" entity="DSSR_000002495_0354"/>
outing which had been afforded them; to <lb/>
which the Judge bowed his thanks, and then <lb/>
said he would now go and arrange for the <lb/>
Freethinkers' meeting, and would call for <lb/>
Count Luigi in the evening.</p>
<p>"For you also, dear sir," he added hastily, <lb/>
turning to Angelo and bowing. "In <reg orig="address-|ing">addressing</reg> <lb/>
myself particularly to your brother, I was <lb/>
not meaning to leave you out. It was an <reg orig="unin-|tentional">unintentional</reg> <lb/>
rudeness, I assure you, and due <lb/>
wholly to accident&mdash;accident and <reg orig="preoccupa-|tion">preoccupation</reg>. <lb/>
I beg you to forgive me."</p>
<p>His quick eye had seen the sensitive blood <lb/>
mount into Angelo's face, betraying the wound <lb/>
that had been inflicted. The sting of the <lb/>
slight had gone deep, but the apology was so <lb/>
prompt, and so evidently sincere, that the <lb/>
hurt was almost immediately healed, and a <lb/>
forgiving smile testified to the kindly Judge <lb/>
that all was well again.</p>
<p>Concealed behind Angelo's modest and <reg orig="un-|assuming">unassuming</reg> <lb/>
exterior, and unsuspected by any <lb/>
but his intimates, was a lofty pride, a pride of <lb/>
almost abnormal proportions indeed, and this <lb/>
rendered him ever the prey of slights; and <lb/>
<figure id="f568" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0354"/>
<pb n="350" entity="DSSR_000002495_0355"/>
although they were almost always imaginary <lb/>
ones, they hurt none the less on that account. <lb/>
By ill fortune Judge Driscoll had happened <lb/>
to touch his sorest point, <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> his conviction <lb/>
that his brother's presence was welcomer <reg orig="every-|where">everywhere</reg> <lb/>
than his own; that he was often invited, <lb/>
out of mere courtesy, where only his brother <lb/>
was wanted, and that in a majority of cases <lb/>
he would not be included in an invitation if he <lb/>
could be left out without offence. A sensitive <lb/>
nature like this is necessarily subject to moods; <lb/>
moods which traverse the whole gamut of <reg orig="feel-|ing">feeling</reg>; <lb/>
moods which know all the climes of <lb/>
emotion, from the sunny heights of joy to the <lb/>
black abysses of despair. At times, in his <lb/>
seasons of deepest depression, Angelo almost <lb/>
wished that he and his brother might become <lb/>
segregated from each other and be separate <lb/>
individuals, like other men. But of course as <lb/>
soon as his mind cleared and these diseased <lb/>
imaginings passed away, he shuddered at the <lb/>
repulsive thought, and earnestly prayed that <lb/>
it might visit him no more. To be separate, <lb/>
and as other men are! How awkward it would <lb/>
seem; how unendurable. What would he do <lb/>
<figure id="f569" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0355"/>
<figure id="f570" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0355"/>
<pb n="351" entity="DSSR_000002495_0356"/>
with his hands, his arms? How would his <lb/>
legs feel? How odd, and strange, and <reg orig="gro-|tesque">grotesque</reg> <lb/>
every action, attitude, movement, <reg orig="gest-|ure">gesture</reg> <lb/>
would be. To sleep by himself, eat by <lb/>
himself, walk by himself&mdash;how lonely, how <lb/>
unspeakably lonely! No, no, any fate but <lb/>
that. In every way and from every point, <lb/>
the idea was revolting.</p>
<p>This was of course natural; to have felt <lb/>
otherwise would have been unnatural. He <lb/>
had known no life but a combined one; he <lb/>
had been familiar with it from his birth; he <lb/>
was not able to conceive of any other as <reg orig="be-|ing">being</reg> <lb/>
agreeable, or even bearable. To him, in <lb/>
the privacy of his secret thoughts, all other <lb/>
men were monsters, deformities; and during <lb/>
three-fourths of his life their aspect had filled <lb/>
him with what promised to be an <reg orig="unconquer-|able">unconquerable</reg> <lb/>
aversion. But at eighteen his eye <reg orig="be-|gan">began</reg> <lb/>
to take note of female beauty; and little <lb/>
by little, undefined longings grew up in his <lb/>
heart, under whose softening influences the old <lb/>
stubborn aversion gradually diminished, and <lb/>
finally disappeared. Men were still <reg orig="monstros-|ities">monstrosities</reg> <lb/>
to him, still deformities, and in his sober <lb/>
moments he had no desire to be like them, <lb/>
<figure id="f571" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0356"/>
<pb n="352" entity="DSSR_000002495_0357"/>
but their strange and unsocial and uncanny <lb/>
construction was no longer offensive to him.</p>
<p>This had been a hard day for him, <reg orig="physi-|cally">physically</reg> <lb/>
and mentally. He had been called in <lb/>
the morning before he had quite slept off the <lb/>
effects of the liquor which Luigi had drunk; <lb/>
and so, for the first half hour had had the seedy <lb/>
feeling, and languor, the brooding depression, <lb/>
the cobwebby mouth and druggy taste that <lb/>
come of dissipation and are so ill a <reg orig="prepara-|tion">preparation</reg> <lb/>
for bodily or intellectual activities; the <lb/>
long violent strain of the reception had <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg>; <lb/>
and this had been followed, in turn, <lb/>
by the dreary sight-seeing, the Judge's <reg orig="weary-|ing">wearying</reg> <lb/>
explanations and laudations of the sights, <lb/>
and the stupefying clamor of the dogs. As <lb/>
a congrous conclusion, a fitting end, his <reg orig="feel-|ings">feelings</reg> <lb/>
had been hurt, a slight had been put <lb/>
upon him. He would have been glad to <lb/>
forego dinner and betake himself to rest and <lb/>
sleep, but he held his peace and said no word, <lb/>
for he knew his brother, Luigi, was fresh. <lb/>
unweary, full of life, spirit, energy; he would <lb/>
have scoffed at the idea of wasting valuable <lb/>
time on a bed or a sofa, and would have <reg orig="re-|fused">refused</reg> <lb/>
permission.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Rowena</hi> was dining out, Joe and Harry <lb/>
were belated at play, there were but three <lb/>
chairs and four persons that noon at the home <lb/>
dinner-table&mdash;the twins, the widow, and her <lb/>
chum, Aunt Betsey Hale. The widow soon <lb/>
perceived that Angelo's spirits were as low as <lb/>
Luigi's were high, and also that he had a <lb/>
jaded look. Her motherly solicitude was <lb/>
aroused, and she tried to get him interested <lb/>
in the talk and win him to a happier frame of <lb/>
mind, but the cloud of sadness remained on <lb/>
his countenance. Luigi lent his help, too. <lb/>
He used a form and a phrase which he was <lb/>
always accustomed to employ in these <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg>. <lb/>
He gave his brother an affectionate <lb/>
slap on the shoulder and said, encouragingly:</p>
<p>"Cheer up, the worst is yet to come!"</p>
<figure id="f573" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0358"/>
<pb n="354" entity="DSSR_000002495_0359"/>
<p>But this did no good. It never did. If <lb/>
anything it made the matter worse, as a rule, <lb/>
because it irritated Angelo. This made it a <lb/>
favorite with Luigi. By and by the widow <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Angelo, you are tired, you've overdone <lb/>
yourself; you go right to bed, after dinner, <lb/>
and get a good nap and a rest, then you'll be <lb/>
all right."</p>
<p>"Indeed I would give anything if I could <lb/>
do that, madam."</p>
<p>"And what's to hender, I'd like to know? <lb/>
Land, the room's yours to do what you please <lb/>
with! The idea that you can't do what you <lb/>
like with your own!"</p>
<p>"But you see, there's one prime essential <lb/>
&mdash;an essential of the very first importance&mdash; <lb/>
which is n't my own."</p>
<figure id="f574" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0359"/>
<p>"What is that?"</p>
<p>"My body."</p>
<p>The old ladies looked puzzled, and Aunt <lb/>
Betsy Hale said:</p>
<p>"Why bless your heart, how is that?"</p>
<p>"It's my brother's."</p>
<p>"Your brother's! I don't quite <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg>. <lb/>
<figure id="f575" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0359"/>
<pb n="355" entity="DSSR_000002495_0360"/>
I supposed it belonged to both of <lb/>
you."</p>
<p>"So it does. But not to both at the same <lb/>
time."</p>
<p>"That is mighty curious; I don't see how <lb/>
it can be. I should n't think it could be <reg orig="man-|aged">managed</reg> <lb/>
that way."</p>
<p>"Oh, it's a good enough arrangement, and <lb/>
goes very well; in fact it would n't do to have <lb/>
it otherwise. I find that the teetotalers and <lb/>
the anti-teetotalers hire the use of the same <lb/>
hall for their meetings. Both parties don't <lb/>
use it at the same time, do they?"</p>
<p>"You bet they don't!" said both old ladies <lb/>
in a breath.</p>
<figure id="f576" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0360"/>
<p>"And moreover," said Aunt Betsy, "the <lb/>
Freethinkers and the Baptist Bible-class use <lb/>
the same room over the Market-house, but you <lb/>
can take my word for it they don't mush up <lb/>
together and use it at the same time."</p>
<p>"Very well," said Angelo, "you <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg> <lb/>
it now. And it stands to reason that <lb/>
the arrangement could n't be improved. I'll <lb/>
prove it to you. If our legs tried to obey <lb/>
two wills, how could we ever get anywhere? <lb/>
<figure id="f577" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0360"/>
<pb n="356" entity="DSSR_000002495_0361"/>
I would start one way, Luigi would start <lb/>
another, at the same moment&mdash;the result <lb/>
would be a standstill, would n't it?"</p>
<p>"As sure as you are born! Now ain't <lb/>
that wonderful! A body would never have <lb/>
thought of it."</p>
<p>"We should always be arguing and fussing <lb/>
and disputing over the merest trifles. We <lb/>
should lose worlds of time, for we could n't go <lb/>
down-stairs or up, could n't go to bed, could n't <lb/>
rise, could n't wash, could n't dress, could n't <lb/>
stand up, could n't sit down, could n't even <lb/>
cross our legs, without calling a meeting first <lb/>
and explaining the case and passing resolutions, <lb/>
and getting consent. It would n't ever do&mdash; <lb/>
now would it?"</p>
<figure id="f578" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0361"/>
<p>"Do? Why, it would wear a person out <lb/>
in a week! Did you ever hear anything <lb/>
like it, Patsy Cooper?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you'll find there's more than one <lb/>
thing about them that ain't commonplace," <lb/>
said the widow, with the complacent air of a <lb/>
person with a property-right in a novelty <lb/>
that is under admiring scrutiny.</p>
<p>"Well now, how ever do you manage it? <lb/>
I don't mind saying I'm suffering to know."</p>
<pb n="357" entity="DSSR_000002495_0362"/>
<p>"He who made us," said Angelo reverently, <lb/>
"and with us this difficulty, also provided a <lb/>
way out of it. By a mysterious law of our <lb/>
being, each of us has utter and indisputable <lb/>
command of our body a week at a time, turn <lb/>
and turn about."</p>
<p>"Well, I never! Now ain't that beautiful!"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is beautiful and infinitely wise and <lb/>
just. The week ends every Saturday at <reg orig="mid-|night">midnight</reg> <lb/>
to the minute, to the second, to the <lb/>
last shade of a fraction of a second, infallibly, <lb/>
unerringly, and in that instant the one brother's <lb/>
power over the body vanishes and the other <lb/>
brother takes possession, asleep or awake."</p>
<figure id="f579" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0362"/>
<p>"How marvelous are His ways, and past <lb/>
finding out!"</p>
<p>Luigi said: "So exactly to the instant does <lb/>
the change come, that during our stay in <lb/>
many of the great cities of the world, the <lb/>
public clocks were regulated by it; and as <lb/>
hundreds of thousands of private clocks and <lb/>
watches were set and corrected in accordance <lb/>
with the public clocks, we really furnished the <lb/>
standard time for the entire city."</p>
<p>"Don't tell me that He don't do miracles <lb/>
<pb n="358" entity="DSSR_000002495_0363"/>
any more! Blowing down the walls of <reg orig="Jer-|icho">Jericho</reg> <lb/>
with rams' horns wa' n't as difficult, in <lb/>
my opinion."</p>
<p>"And that is not all," said Angelo. "A <lb/>
thing that is even more marvelous, perhaps, is <lb/>
the fact that the change takes note of <reg orig="long-|itude">longitude</reg> <lb/>
and fits itself to the meridian we are on. <lb/>
Luigi is in command this week. Now, if on <lb/>
Saturday night at a moment before midnight <lb/>
we could fly in an instant to a point fifteen <lb/>
degrees west of here, he would hold possession <lb/>
of the power another hour, for the change <lb/>
observes <hi rend="italic">local</hi> time and no other."</p>
<p>Betsy Hale was deeply impressed, and said <lb/>
with solemnity:"</p>
<p>"Patsy Cooper, for <hi rend="italic">de</hi>tail it lays over the <lb/>
Passage of the Red Sea."</p>
<p>"Now, I should n't go as far as that," said <lb/>
Aunt Patsy, "but if you've a mind to say <lb/>
Sodom and Gomorrah, I am with you, Betsy <lb/>
Hale."</p>
<figure id="f580" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0363"/>
<p>"I am agreeable, then, though I do think I <lb/>
was right, and I believe Parson Maltby would <lb/>
say the same. Well now, there's another <lb/>
thing. Suppose one of you wants to borrow <lb/>
<pb n="359" entity="DSSR_000002495_0364"/>
the legs a minute from the one that's got <lb/>
them, could he let him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but we hardly ever do that. There <lb/>
were disagreeable results, several times, and <lb/>
so we very seldom ask or grant the privilege, <lb/>
nowdays, and we never even think of such a <lb/>
thing unless the case is extremely urgent. <lb/>
Besides, a week's possession at a time seems <lb/>
so little that we can't bear to spare a minute <lb/>
of it. People who have the use of their legs <lb/>
all the time never think of what a blessing it <lb/>
is, of course. It never occurs to them; it's <lb/>
just their natural ordinary condition, and so it <lb/>
does not excite them at all. But when I <lb/>
wake up, on Sunday morning, and it's my <lb/>
week and I feel the power all through me, oh, <lb/>
such a wave of exultation and thanksgiving <lb/>
goes surging over me, and I want to shout <lb/>
'I can walk! I can walk!' Madam, do <lb/>
you ever, at your uprising want to shout 'I <lb/>
can walk! I can walk'?"</p>
<figure id="f581" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0364"/>
<p>"No, you poor unfortunate cretur', but I'll <lb/>
never get out of my bed again without <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> <lb/>
it! Laws, to think I've had this <reg orig="unspeaka-|ble">unspeakable</reg> <lb/>

the grace to thank the good Lord that gave <lb/>
it to me!"</p>
<p>Tears stood in the eyes of both the old <lb/>
ladies and the widow said, softly:</p>
<p>"Betsy Hale, we have learned something, <lb/>
you and me."</p>
<p>The conversation now drifted wide, but by <lb/>
and by floated back once more to that admired <lb/>
detail, the rigid and beautiful impartiality <lb/>
with which the possession of power had been <lb/>
distributed between the twins. Aunt Betsy <lb/>
saw in it a far finer justice than human law <lb/>
exhibits in related cases. She said:</p>
<p>"In my opinion it ain't right now, and <lb/>
never has been right, the way a twin born a <lb/>
quarter of a minute sooner than the other one <lb/>
gets all the land an-grandeurs and nobilities <lb/>
in the old countries and his brother has to go <lb/>
bare and be a nobody. Which of you was <lb/>
born first?"</p>
<p>Angelo's head was resting against Luigi's; <lb/>
weariness had overcome him, and for the past <lb/>
five minutes he had been peacefully sleeping. <lb/>
The old ladies had dropped their voices to a <lb/>
fulling drone, to help him steal the rest his <lb/>
<figure id="f583" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0365"/>
<pb n="361" entity="DSSR_000002495_0366"/>
brother would n't take him up-stairs to get. <lb/>
Luigi listened a moment to Angelo's regular <lb/>
breathing, then said in a voice barely audible:</p>
<p>"We were both born at the same time, but <lb/>
I am six months older than he is."</p>
<p>"For the land's sake!"</p>
<p>"'Sh! don't wake him up; he would n't <lb/>
like my telling this. It has always been kept <lb/>
secret till now."</p>
<p>"But how in the world can it be? If you <lb/>
were both born at the same time, how can <lb/>
one of you be older than the other?"</p>
<figure id="f584" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0366"/>
<p>"It is very simple, and I assure you it is <lb/>
true. I was born with a full crop of hair, he <lb/>
was as bald as an egg for six months. I <lb/>
could walk six months before he could make <lb/>
a step. I finished teething six months ahead <lb/>
of him. I began to take solids six months <lb/>
before he left the breast. I began to talk six <lb/>
months before he could say a word. Last, <lb/>
and absolutely unassailable proof, <hi rend="italic">the sutures <lb/>
in my skull closed six months ahead of his.</hi> <lb/>
Always just that six months difference to a <lb/>
day. Was that accident? Nobody is going <lb/>
to claim that, I'm sure. It was ordained&mdash;it <lb/>
<figure id="f585" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0366"/>
<pb n="362" entity="DSSR_000002495_0367"/>
was law&mdash;it had its meaning, and we know <lb/>
what that meaning was. Now what does this <lb/>
overwhelming body of evidence establish? It <lb/>
establishes just one thing, and that thing it <lb/>
establishes beyond any peradventure <reg orig="what-|ever">whatever</reg>. <lb/>
Friends, we would not have it known <lb/>
for the world, and I must beg you to keep it <lb/>
strictly to yourselves, but the truth is, <hi rend="italic">we are <lb/>
no more twins than you are."</hi></p>
<p>The two old ladies were stunned, paralyzed <lb/>
&mdash;petrified, one may almost say&mdash;and could <lb/>
only sit and gaze vacantly at each other for <lb/>
some moments; then Aunt Betsy Hale said <lb/>
impressively:</p>
<p>"There's no getting around proof like that. <lb/>
I do believe it's the most amazing thing I <lb/>
ever heard of." She sat silent a moment or <lb/>
two and breathing hard with excitement, then <lb/>
she looked up and surveyed the strangers <lb/>
steadfastly a little while, and added: "Well, <lb/>
it does beat me, but I would have took you <lb/>
for twins anywhere."</p>
<p>"So would I, so would I," said Aunt Patsy <lb/>
with the emphasis of a certainty that is not <lb/>
impaired by any shade of doubt.</p>
<figure id="f586" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0367"/>
<pb n="363" entity="DSSR_000002495_0368"/>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Any</hi>body would&mdash;anybody in the world, <lb/>
 I don't care who he is," said Aunt Betsy with <lb/>
 decision.</p>
<p>"You won't tell," said Luigi, appealingly.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear no!" answered both ladies <lb/>
 promptly, "you can trust us, don't you be <lb/>
 afraid."</p>
<p>"That is good of you, and kind. Never <lb/>
 let on; treat us always as if we were twins."</p>
<p>"You can depend on us," said Aunt Betsy, <lb/>
 "but it won't be easy, because now that I <lb/>
 know you ain't, you don't <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> so."</p>
<p>Luigi muttered to himself with satisfaction:</p>
<p>"That swindle has gone through without <lb/>
 change of cars."</p>
<p>It was not very kind of him to load the <lb/>
 poor things up with a secret like that, which <lb/>
 would be always flying to their tongues' ends <lb/>
 every time they heard any one speak of the <lb/>
 strangers as twins, and would become harder <lb/>
 and harder to hang on to with every <reg orig="recur-|rence">recurrence</reg> <lb/>
of the temptation to tell it, while the <lb/>
 torture of retaining it would increase with <lb/>
 every new strain that was applied; but he <lb/>
 never thought of that, and probably would <lb/>
 not have worried much about it if he had.</p>
<figure id="f587" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0368"/>
<pb n="364" entity="DSSR_000002495_0369"/>
<p>A visitor was announced&mdash;some one to see <lb/>
the twins. They withdrew to the parlor, and <lb/>
the two old ladies began to discuss with <reg orig="inter-|est">interest</reg> <lb/>
the strange things which they had been <lb/>
listening to. When they had finished the <lb/>
matter to their satisfaction, and Aunt <lb/>
Betsy rose to go, she stopped to ask a <reg orig="ques-|tion">question</reg>:</p>
<p>"How does things come on between <reg orig="Row-|eny">Roweny</reg> <lb/>
and Tom Driscoll?"</p>
<p>"Well, about the same. He writes <reg orig="tolera-|ble">tolerable</reg> <lb/>
often, and she answers tolerable seldom."</p>
<p>"Where is he?"</p>
<figure id="f588" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0369"/>
<p>"In St. Louis, I believe, though he's such <lb/>
a gad-about that a body can't be very certain <lb/>
of him, I reckon."</p>
<p>"Don't Roweny know?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, like enough. I have n't asked her <lb/>
lately."</p>
<p>"Do you know how him and the Judge are <lb/>
getting along now?"</p>
<p>"First-rate, I believe. Mrs. Pratt says so; <lb/>
and being right in the house, and sister to the <lb/>
one and aunt to t' other, of course she ought <lb/>
to know. She says the Judge is real fond of <lb/>
<figure id="f589" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0369"/>
<pb n="365" entity="DSSR_000002495_0370"/>
him when he's away, but frets when he's <lb/>
around and is vexed with his ways, and not <lb/>
sorry to have him go again. He has been <lb/>
gone three weeks this time&mdash;a pleasant thing <lb/>
for both of them, I reckon."</p>
<p>"Tom's ruther harum-scarum, but there <lb/>
ain't anything bad in him, I guess."</p>
<p>"Oh no, he's just young, that's all. Still, <lb/>
twenty-three is old, in one way. A young <lb/>
man ought to be earning his living by that <lb/>
time. If Tom were doing that, or was even <lb/>
trying to do it, the Judge would be a heap <lb/>
better satisfied with him. Tom's always <reg orig="go-|ing">going</reg> <lb/>
to begin, but somehow he can't seem to <lb/>
find just the opening he likes."</p>
<figure id="f590" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0370"/>
<p>"Well now, it's partly the Judge's own <lb/>
fault. Promising the boy his property was n't <lb/>
the way to set him to earning a fortune of his <lb/>
own. But what do you think&mdash;is Roweny <lb/>
beginning to lean any towards him, or ain't <lb/>
she?"</p>
<p>Aunt Patsy had a secret in her bosom; she <lb/>
wanted to keep it there, but nature was too <lb/>
strong for her. She drew Aunt Betsy aside, <lb/>
and said in her most confidential and <reg orig="mysteri-|ous">mysterious</reg> <lb/>
manner:</p>
<pb n="366" entity="DSSR_000002495_0371"/>
<p>"Don't you breathe a syllable to a soul&mdash; <lb/>
I'm going to tell you something. In my <lb/>
opinion Tom Driscoll's chances were <reg orig="con-|siderable">considerable</reg> <lb/>
better yesterday than they are <reg orig="to-|day">today</reg>."</p>
<p>"Patsy Cooper, what <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you mean?"</p>
<p>"It's so, as sure as you're born. I wish <lb/>
you could 'a' been at breakfast and seen for <lb/>
yourself."</p>
<p>"You don't mean it!"</p>
<p>"Well, if I'm any judge, there's a leaning <lb/>
&mdash;there's a leaning, sure."</p>
<p>"My land! Which one of 'em is it?"</p>
<p>"I can't say for certain, but I think it's the <lb/>
youngest one&mdash;Anjy."</p>
<p>Then there were handshakings, and <reg orig="con-|gratulations">congratulations</reg>, <lb/>
and hopes, and so on, and the <lb/>
old ladies parted, perfectly happy&mdash;the one <lb/>
in knowing something which the rest of the <lb/>
town didn't, and the other in having been the <lb/>
sole person able to furnish that knowledge.</p>
<figure id="f591" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0371"/>
<p>The visitor who had called to see the twins <lb/>
was the Rev. Mr. Hotchkiss, pastor of the <lb/>
Baptist church. At the reception Angelo had <lb/>
told him he had lately experienced a change <lb/>
<figure id="f592" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0371"/>
<pb n="367" entity="DSSR_000002495_0372"/>
in his religious views, and was now desirous <lb/>
of becoming a Baptist, and would immediately <lb/>
join Mr. Hotchkiss's church. There was <lb/>
no time to say more, and the brief talk ended <lb/>
at that point. The minister was much <reg orig="grat-|ified">gratified</reg>, <lb/>
and had dropped in for a moment, now, <lb/>
to invite the twins to attend his Bible-class at <lb/>
eight that evening. Angelo accepted, and <lb/>
was expecting Luigi to decline, but he did <lb/>
not, because he knew that the Bible-class and <lb/>
the Freethinkers met in the same room, and <lb/>
he wanted to treat his brother to the <reg orig="em-|barrassment">embarrassment</reg> <lb/>
of being caught in freethinking <lb/>
company.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<p>[A long and vigorous quarrel follows, between the <lb/>
twins. And there is plenty to quarrel about, for Angelo <lb/>
was always seeking truth, and this obliged him to change <lb/>
and improve his religion with frequency, which wearied <lb/>
Luigi, and annoyed him too; for he had to be present at <lb/>
each new enlistment&mdash;which placed him in the false <lb/>
position of seeming to indorse and approve his brother's <lb/>
fickleness; moreover, he had to go to Angelo's <reg orig="prohi-|bition">prohibition</reg> <lb/>
meetings, and he hated them. On the other hand, <lb/>
when it was <hi rend="italic">his</hi> week to command the legs he gave <lb/>
Angelo just cause of complaint, for he took him to <reg orig="cir-|cuses">circuses</reg> <lb/>
and horse-races and fandangoes, exposing him to <lb/>
all sorts of censure and criticism; and he drank, too; <lb/>
and whatever he drank went to Angelo's head instead of <lb/>
his own and made him act disgracefully. When the <lb/>
evening was come, the two attended the Freethinkers' <lb/>
meeting, where Angelo was sad and silent; then came the <lb/>
Bible-class and looked upon him coldly, finding him in <lb/>
such company. Then they went to Wilson's house, and <lb/>
Chapter XI. of "Pudd'nhead Wilson" follows, which <lb/>
tells of the girl seen in Tom Driscoll's room; and closes <lb/>
with the kicking of Tom by Luigi at the anti-temperance <lb/>
mass meeting of the Sons of Liberty; with the addition of <lb/>
some account of Roxy's adventures as a chambermaid on <lb/>
a Mississippi boat. Her exchange of the children had <lb/>
been flippantly and farcically described in an earlier <lb/>
chapter.]</p>
<figure id="f594" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0373"/>
<pb n="369" entity="DSSR_000002495_0374"/>
<p>Next morning all the town was a-buzz with <lb/>
great news; Pudd'nhead Wilson had a <reg orig="law-|case">law-case</reg>! <lb/>
The public astonishment was so great <lb/>
and the public curiosity so intense, that when <lb/>
the justice of the peace opened his court, the <lb/>
place was packed with people, and even the <lb/>
windows were full. Everybody was flushed <lb/>
and perspiring, the summer heat was almost <lb/>
unendurable.</p>
<p>Tom Driscoll had brought a charge of <reg orig="as-|sault">assault</reg> <lb/>
and battery against the twins. Robert <lb/>
Allen was retained by Driscoll, David Wilson <lb/>
by the defense. Tom, his native cheerfulness <lb/>
unannihilated by his back-breaking and <reg orig="bone-|bruising">bone-bruising</reg> <lb/>
passage across the massed heads of <lb/>
the Sons of Liberty the previous night, <lb/>
laughed his little customary laugh, and said to <lb/>
Wilson:</p>
<p>"I've kept my promise, you see: I'm <lb/>
throwing my business your way. Sooner than <lb/>
I was expecting, too."</p>
<p>"It's very good of you&mdash;particularly if you <lb/>
mean to keep it up."</p>
<p>"Well, I can't tell about that, yet. But <lb/>
we'll see. If I find you deserve it I'll take you <lb/>
<figure id="f595" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0374"/>
<pb n="370" entity="DSSR_000002495_0375"/>
under my protection and make your fame <lb/>
and fortune for you."</p>
<p>"I'll try to deserve it, Tom."</p>
<p>A jury was sworn in; then Mr. Allen said:</p>
<p>"We will detain your honor but a moment <lb/>
with this case. It is not one where any doubt <lb/>
of the fact of the assault can enter in. These <lb/>
gentlemen&mdash;the accused&mdash;kicked my client at <lb/>
the Market Hall last night; they kicked him <lb/>
with violence; with extraodinary violence; <lb/>
with even unprecedented violence, I may say; <lb/>
insomuch that he was lifted entirely off his <lb/>
feet and discharged into the midst of the <reg orig="au-|dience">audience</reg>. <lb/>
We can prove this by four hundred <lb/>
witnesses&mdash;we shall call but three. Mr. <lb/>
Harkness will take the stand."</p>
<p>Mr. Harkness being sworn, testified that <lb/>
he was chairman upon the occasion mentioned; <lb/>
that he was close at hand and saw the <reg orig="defend-|ants">defendants</reg> <lb/>
in this action kick the plaintiff into the <lb/>
air and saw him descend among the audience.</p>
<figure id="f596" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0375"/>
<p>"Take the witness," said Allen.</p>
<p>"Mr. Harkness," said Wilson, "you say <lb/>
you saw these gentlemen, my clients, kick the <lb/>
plaintiff. Are you sure&mdash;and please <reg orig="remem-|ber">remember</reg> <lb/>
<figure id="f597" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0375"/>
<pb n="371" entity="DSSR_000002495_0376"/>
that you are on oath&mdash;are you perfectly <lb/>
sure that you saw <hi rend="italic">both</hi> of them kick him, or <lb/>
only one? Now be careful."</p>
<p>A bewildered look began to spread itself <lb/>
over the witness's face. He hesitated, <reg orig="stam-|mered">stammered</reg>, <lb/>
but got out nothing. His eyes <reg orig="wan-|dered">wandered</reg> <lb/>
to the twins and fixed themselves there <lb/>
with a vacant gaze.</p>
<p>"Please answer, Mr. Harkness, you are <lb/>
keeping the court waiting. It is a very <reg orig="sim-|ple">simple</reg> <lb/>
question."</p>
<p>Counsel for the prosecution broke in with <lb/>
impatience:</p>
<p>"Your honor, the question is an irrelevant <lb/>
triviality. Necessarily they both kicked him, <lb/>
for they have but the one pair of legs, and <lb/>
both are responsible for them."</p>
<figure id="f598" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0376"/>
<p>Wilson said, sarcastically:</p>
<p>"Will your honor permit this new witness <lb/>
to be sworn? He seems to possess knowledge <lb/>
which can be of the utmost value just at this <lb/>
moment&mdash;knowledge which would at once <reg orig="dis-|pose">dispose</reg> <lb/>
of what every one must see is a very <lb/>
difficult question in this case. Brother Allen, <lb/>
will you take the stand?"</p>
<figure id="f599" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0376"/>
<pb n="372" entity="DSSR_000002495_0377"/>
<p>"Go on with your case!" said Allen, <reg orig="petu-|lantly">petulantly</reg>. <lb/>
The audience laughed, and got a <lb/>
warning from the court.</p>
<p>"Now, Mr. Harkness," said Wilson, <reg orig="insinu-|atingly">insinuatingly</reg>, <lb/>
"we shall have to insist upon an <reg orig="ans-|wer">answer</reg> <lb/>
to that question."</p>
<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;well, of course I do not absolutely <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">know,</hi> but in my opinion&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Never mind your opinion, sir&mdash;answer the <lb/>
question."</p>
<p>"I&mdash;why, I <hi rend="italic">can't</hi> answer it."</p>
<p>"That will do, Mr. Harkness. Stand down."</p>
<p>The audience tittered, and the discomfited <lb/>
witness retired in a state of great <reg orig="embarrass-|ment">embarrassment</reg>.</p>
<p>Mr. Wakeman took the stand and swore <lb/>
that he saw the twins kick the plaintiff off the <lb/>
platform. The defence took the witness.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wakeman, you have sworn that you <lb/>
saw these gentlemen kick the plaintiff. Do I <lb/>
understand you to swear that you saw them <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">both</hi> do it?"</p>
<figure id="f600" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0377"/>
<p>"Yes, sir,"&mdash;with decision.</p>
<p>"How do you know that both did it?"</p>
<p>"Because I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> them do it."</p>
<figure id="f601" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0377"/>
<pb n="373" entity="DSSR_000002495_0378"/>
<p>The audience laughed, and got another <lb/>
warning from the court.</p>
<p>"But by what means do you know that <lb/>
both, and not one, did it?"</p>
<p>"Well, in the first place, the insult was <lb/>
given to both of them equally, for they were <lb/>
called a pair of scissors. Of course they <lb/>
would both want to resent it, and so&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Wait! You are theorizing now. Stick to <lb/>
facts&mdash;counsel will attend to the arguments. <lb/>
Go on."</p>
<p>"Well, they both went over there&mdash;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> I <lb/>
saw."</p>
<p>"Very good. Go on."</p>
<figure id="f602" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0378"/>
<p>"And they both kicked him&mdash;I swear to <lb/>
it."</p>
<p>"Mr. Wakeman, was Count Luigi, here, <lb/>
willing to join the Sons of Liberty last <lb/>
night?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, he was. He did join, too, and <lb/>
drank a glass or two of whisky, like a man.'</p>
<figure id="f603" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0378"/>
<p>"Was his brother willing to join?"</p>
<p>"No, sir, he was n't. He is a teetotaler, <lb/>
and was elected through a mistake."</p>
<p>"Was he given a glass of whisky?"</p>
<figure id="f604" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0378"/>
<pb n="374" entity="DSSR_000002495_0379"/>
<p>"Yes, sir, but of course that was another <lb/>
mistake, and not intentional. He would n't <lb/>
drink it. He set it down." A slight pause, <lb/>
then he added, casually and quite simply: <lb/>
"The plaintiff reached for it and hogged it."</p>
<p>There was a fine outburst of laughter, but <lb/>
as the justice was caught out himself, his <reg orig="rep-|rimand">reprimand</reg> <lb/>
was not very vigorous.</p>
<p>Mr. Allen jumped up and exclaimed: "I <lb/>
protest against these foolish irrelevancies. <lb/>
What have they to do with the case?"</p>
<p>Wilson said: "Calm yourself, brother, it <lb/>
was only an experiment. Now, Mr. Wakeman, <lb/>
if one of these gentlemen chooses to join an <lb/>
association and the other does n't; and if one <lb/>
of them enjoys whisky and the other does n't, <lb/>
but sets it aside and leaves it unprotected" <lb/>
(titter from the audience), "it seems to show <lb/>
that they have independent minds and tastes <lb/>
and preferences, and that one of them is able <lb/>
to approve of a thing at the very moment <lb/>
that the other is heartily disapproving of it. <lb/>
Does n't it seem so to you?"</p>
<figure id="f605" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0379"/>
<p>"Certainly it does. It's perfectly plain."</p>
<p>"Now then, it might be&mdash;I only say it <lb/>
<figure id="f606" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0379"/>
<pb n="375" entity="DSSR_000002495_0380"/>
might be&mdash;that one of these brothers wanted <lb/>
to kick the plaintiff last night, and that the <lb/>
other did n't want that humilating <reg orig="punish-|ment">punishment</reg> <lb/>
inflicted upon him in that public way <lb/>
and before all those people. Is n't that <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg>?</p>
<p>"Of course it is. It's more than possible. <lb/>
I don't believe the blonde one would kick <lb/>
anybody. It was the other one that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Silence!" shouted the plaintiff's counsel, <lb/>
and went on with an angry sentence which <lb/>
was lost in the wave of laughter that swept <lb/>
the house.</p>
<p>"That will do, Mr. Wakeman," said <reg orig="Wil-|son">Wilson</reg>, <lb/>
"you may stand down."</p>
<p>The third witness was called. He had seen <lb/>
the twins kick the plaintiff. Mr. Wilson took <lb/>
the witness.</p>
<p>"Mr. Rogers, you say you saw these <reg orig="ac-|cused">accused</reg> <lb/>
gentlemen kick the plaintiff?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Both of them?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Which of them kicked him first?"</p>
<figure id="f607" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0380"/>
<p>"Why&mdash;they&mdash;they both kicked him at the <lb/>
same time."</p>
<figure id="f608" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0380"/>
<pb n="376" entity="DSSR_000002495_0381"/>
<p>"Are you perfectly sure of that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"What makes you sure of it?"</p>
<p>"Why, I stood right behind them, and <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> <lb/>
them do it."</p>
<p>"How many kicks were delivered?"</p>
<p>"Only one."</p>
<p>"If two men kick, the result should be two <lb/>
kicks, should n't it?"</p>
<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;yes, as a rule."</p>
<p>"Then what do you think went with the <lb/>
other kick?"</p>
<figure id="f609" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0381"/>
<p>"I&mdash;well&mdash;the fact is, I was n't thinking of <lb/>
two being necessary, this time."</p>
<p>"What do you think now?"</p>
<p>"Well, I&mdash;I'm sure I don't quite know <lb/>
what to think, but I reckon that one of them <lb/>
did half of the kick and the other one did the <lb/>
other half."</p>
<figure id="f610" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0381"/>
<p>Somebody in the crowd sung out: "It's <lb/>
the first sane thing that any of them has said."</p>
<p>The audience applauded. The judge said: <lb/>
"Silence! or I will clear the court."</p>
<p>Mr. Allen looked pleased, but Wilson did <lb/>
not seem disturbed. He said:</p>
<figure id="f611" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0381"/>
<pb n="377" entity="DSSR_000002495_0382"/>
<p>"Mr. Rogers, you have favored us with <lb/>
what you think and what you reckon, but as <lb/>
thinking and reckoning are not evidence, I <lb/>
will now give you a chance to come out with <lb/>
something positive, one way or the other, and <lb/>
shall require you to produce it. I will ask the <lb/>
accused to stand up and repeat the <reg orig="pheno-|menal">phenomenal</reg> <lb/>
kick of last night." The twins stood up. <lb/>
"Now, Mr. Rogers, please stand behind them."</p>
<p>A Voice: "No, stand in front!" <reg orig="(Laugh-|ter">(Laughter</reg>. <lb/>
Silenced by the court.) Another Voice: <lb/>
"No, give Tommy another highst!" <reg orig="(Laugh-|ter">(Laughter</reg>. <lb/>
Sharply rebuked by the court.)</p>
<p>"Now then, Mr. Rogers, two kicks shall be <lb/>
delivered, one after the other, and I give you <lb/>
my word that at least one of the two shall be <lb/>
delivered by one of the twins alone, without <lb/>
the slightest assistance from his brother. <lb/>
Watch sharply, for you have got to render a <lb/>
decision without any if's and and's in it." <lb/>
Rogers bent himself behind the twins with his <lb/>
palms just above his knees, in the modern <reg orig="at-|titude">attitude</reg> <lb/>
of the catcher at a base-ball match, and <lb/>
riveted his eyes on the pair of legs in front of <lb/>
him. "Are you ready, Mr. Rogers?"</p>
<figure id="f612" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0382"/>
<pb n="378" entity="DSSR_000002495_0383"/>
<p>"Ready, sir."</p>
<p>"Kick!"</p>
<p>The kick was launched.</p>
<p>"Have you got that one classified, Mr. <lb/>
Rogers?"</p>
<p>"Let me study a minute, sir."</p>
<p>"Take as much time as you please. Let <lb/>
me know when you are ready."</p>
<p>For as much as a minute Rogers pondered, <lb/>
with all eyes and a breathless interest fastened <lb/>
upon him. Then he gave the word: "Ready, <lb/>
sir."</p>
<p>"Kick!"</p>
<p>The kick that followed was an exact <reg orig="dupli-|cate">duplicate</reg> <lb/>
of the first one.</p>
<p>"Now then, Mr. Rogers, one of those kicks <lb/>
was an individual kick, not a mutual one. <lb/>
You will now state positively which was the <lb/>
mutual one."</p>
<p>The witness said, with a crestfallen look:</p>
<p>"I've got to give it up. There ain't any <lb/>
man in the world that could tell t'other from <lb/>
which, sir."</p>
<p>"Do you still assert that last night's kick <lb/>
was a mutual kick?"</p>
<figure id="f613" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0383"/>
<pb n="379" entity="DSSR_000002495_0384"/>
<p>"Indeed I don't, sir."</p>
<p>"That will do, Mr. Rogers. If my brother <lb/>
Allen desires to address the court, your honor, <lb/>
very well; but as far as I am concerned I am <lb/>
ready to let the case be at once delivered <lb/>
into the hands of this intelligent jury without <lb/>
comment."</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Robinson had been in office <lb/>
only two months, and in that short time had <lb/>
not had many cases to try, of course. He had <lb/>
no knowledge of laws and courts except what <lb/>
he had picked up since he came into office. <lb/>
He was a sore trouble to the lawyers, for his <lb/>
rulings were pretty eccentric sometimes, and <lb/>
he stood by them with Roman simplicity and <lb/>
fortitude; but the people were well satisfied <lb/>
with him, for they saw that his intentions were <lb/>
always right, that he was entirely impartial, <lb/>
and that he usually made up in good sense <lb/>
what he lacked in technique, so to speak. He <lb/>
now perceived that there was likely to be a <lb/>
miscarriage of justice here, and he rose to the <lb/>
occasion.</p>
<figure id="f614" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0384"/>
<p>"Wait a moment, gentlemen," he said, "it <lb/>
is plain that an assault has been committed&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="380" entity="DSSR_000002495_0385"/>
it is plain to anybody; but the way things are <lb/>
going, the guilty will certainly escape <reg orig="convic-|tion">conviction</reg>. <lb/>
I cannot allow this. Now&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But, your honor!" said Wilson, <reg orig="inter-|rupting">interrupting</reg> <lb/>
him, earnestly but respectfully, "you <lb/>
are deciding the case yourself, whereas the <lb/>
jury&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Never mind the jury, Mr. Wilson; the jury <lb/>
will have a chance when there is a reasonable <lb/>
doubt for them to take hold of&mdash;which there <lb/>
is n't, so far. There is no doubt whatever that <lb/>
an assault has been committed. The attempt <lb/>
to show that both of the accused committed it <lb/>
has failed. Are they both to escape justice on <lb/>
that account? Not in this court, if I can <reg orig="pre-|vent">prevent</reg> <lb/>
it. It appears to have been a mistake to <lb/>
bring the charge against them as a corporation; <lb/>
each should have been charged in his capacity <lb/>
as an individual, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But your honor!" said Wilson, "in <reg orig="fair-|ness">fairness</reg> <lb/>
to my clients I must insist that inasmuch <lb/>
as the prosecution did not separate the&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No wrong will be done your clients, sir&mdash; <lb/>
they will be protected; also the public and <lb/>
the offended laws. Mr. Allen, you will amend <lb/>
<figure id="f615" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0385"/>
<pb n="381" entity="DSSR_000002495_0386"/>
your pleadings, and put one of the accused <lb/>
on trial at a time."</p>
<p>Wilson broke in: "But your honor! this <lb/>
is wholly unprecedented! To imperil an <lb/>
accused person by arbitrarily altering and <lb/>
widening the charge against him in order to <lb/>
compass his conviction when the charge as <lb/>
originally brought promises to fail to convict, <lb/>
is a thing unheard of before."</p>
<p>"Unheard of <hi rend="italic">where?</hi>"</p>
<p>"In the courts of this or any other State."</p>
<p>The judge said with dignity: "I am not <lb/>
aquainted with the customs of other courts, <lb/>
and am not concerned to know what they <lb/>
are. I am responsible for this court, and I <lb/>
cannot conscientiously allow my judgment <lb/>
to be warped and my judicial liberty <reg orig="ham-|pered">hampered</reg> <lb/>
by trying to conform to the caprices of <lb/>
other courts, be they&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But, your honor, the oldest and highest <lb/>
courts in Europe&mdash;"</p>
<p>"This court is not run on the European plan, <lb/>
Mr. Wilson; it is not run on any plan but its <lb/>
own. It has a plan of its own; and that plan <lb/>
is, to find justice for both State and accused, <lb/>
<figure id="f616" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0386"/>
<pb n="382" entity="DSSR_000002495_0387"/>
no matter what happens to be practice and <reg orig="cus-|tom">custom</reg> <lb/>
in Europe or anywhere else." (Great <lb/>
applause.) "Silence! It has not been the <lb/>
custom of this court to imitate other courts; <lb/>
it has not been the custom of this court to <lb/>
take shelter behind the decisions of other <lb/>
courts, and we will not begin now. We will <lb/>
do the best we can by the light that God has <lb/>
given us, and while this court continues to <lb/>
have His approval, it will remain in different <lb/>
to what other organizations may think of it." <lb/>
(Applause.) "Gentlemen, I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have order! <lb/>
&mdash;quiet yourselves! Mr. Allen, you will now <lb/>
proceed against the prisoners one at a time. <lb/>
Go on with the case."</p>
<figure id="f617" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0387"/>
<p>Allen was not at his ease. However, after <lb/>
whispering a moment with his client and <lb/>
with one or two other people, he rose and <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Your honor, I find it to be reported and <lb/>
believed that the accused are able to act <reg orig="in-|dependently">independently</reg> <lb/>
in many ways, but that this <lb/>
independence does not extend to their legs, <lb/>
authority over their legs being vested <reg orig="exclu-|sively">exclusively</reg> <lb/>
in the one brother during a specific <lb/>
<figure id="f618" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002495_0387"/>
<pb n="383" entity="DSSR_000002495_0388"/>
term of days, and then passing to the other <lb/>
brother for a like term, and so on, by regular <lb/>
alternation. I could call witnesses who would <lb/>
prove that the accused had revealed to them <lb/>
the existence of this extraordinary fact, and <lb/>
had also made known which of them was in <lb/>
possession of the legs yesterday&mdash;and this <lb/>
would of course indicate where the guilt of <lb/>
the assault belongs&mdash;but as this would be <lb/>
mere hearsay evidence, these revelations not <lb/>
having been made under oath&mdash;"</p>
<figure id="f619" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0388"/>
<p>"Never mind about that, Mr. Allen. It <lb/>
may not all be hearsay. We shall see. It <lb/>
may at least help to put us on the right track. <lb/>
Call the witnesses."</p>
<p>"Then I will call Mr. John Buckstone, who <lb/>
is now present, and I beg that Mrs. Patsy <lb/>
Cooper may be sent for. Take the stand, <lb/>
Mr. Buckstone."</p>
<p>Buckstone took the oath, and then testified <lb/>
that on the previous evening the Count <reg orig="An-|gelo">Angelo</reg> <lb/>
Cappello had protested against going <lb/>
to the hall, and had called all present to <reg orig="wit-|ness">witness</reg> <lb/>
that he was going by compulsion and <lb/>
would not go if he could help himself. Also, <lb/>
<figure id="f620" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0388"/>
<pb n="384" entity="DSSR_000002495_0389"/>
that the Count Luigi had replied sharply <lb/>
that he would <hi rend="italic">go,</hi> just the same, and that he, <lb/>
Count Luigi, would see to that, himself. <reg orig="Al-|so">Also</reg>, <lb/>
that upon Count Angelo's complaining <lb/>
about being kept on his legs so long, Count <lb/>
Luigi retorted with apparant surprise, '<hi rend="italic">Your</hi> <lb/>
legs!&mdash;I like your impudence!'"</p>
<figure id="f621" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0389"/>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Now</hi> we are getting at the kernel of the <lb/>
thing," observed the judge, with grave and <lb/>
earnest satisfaction. "It looks as if the <lb/>
Count Luigi was in possession of the battery <lb/>
at the time of the assault."</p>
<p>Nothing further was elicited from Mr. <lb/>
Buckstone on direct examination. Mr. <reg orig="Wil-|son">Wilson</reg> <lb/>
took the witness.</p>
<p>"Mr. Buckstone, about what time was it <lb/>
that that conversation took place?"</p>
<p>"Toward nine yesterday evening, sir."</p>
<p>"Did you then proceed directly to the <lb/>
hall?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"How long did it take you to go there?"</p>
<p>"Well, we walked; and as it was from the <lb/>
extreme edge of the town, and there was no <lb/>
<pb n="385" entity="DSSR_000002495_0390"/>
hurry, I judge it took us about twenty <reg orig="min-|utes">minutes</reg>, <lb/>
maybe a trifle more."</p>
<p>"About what hour was the kick <reg orig="deliv-|ered">delivered</reg>?"</p>
<p>"At thirteen minutes and a half to ten."</p>
<p>"Admirable! You are a pattern witness, <lb/>
Mr. Buckstone. How did you happen to <lb/>
look at your watch at that particular <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg>?"</p>
<figure id="f622" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0390"/>
<p>"I always do it when I see an assault. <lb/>
It's likely I shall be called as a witness, and <lb/>
it's a good point to have."</p>
<p>"It would be well if others were as <lb/>
thoughtful. Was anything said, between the <lb/>
conversation at my house and the assault, <lb/>
upon the detail which we are now examining <lb/>
into?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"If power over the mutual legs was in the <lb/>
possession of one brother at nine, and passed <lb/>
into the possession of the other one during <lb/>
the next thirty or forty minutes, do you think <lb/>
you could have detected the change?"</p>
<p>"By no means!"</p>
<p>"That is all, Mr. Buckstone."</p>
<figure id="f623" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0390"/>
<pb n="386" entity="DSSR_000002495_0391"/>
<p>Mrs. Patsy Cooper was called. The crowd <lb/>
made way for her, and she came smiling and <lb/>
bowing through the narrow human lane, with <lb/>
Betsy Hale, as escort and support, smiling <lb/>
and bowing in her wake, the audience <reg orig="break-|ing">breaking</reg> <lb/>
into welcoming cheers as the old favorites <lb/>
filed along. The judge did not check this <lb/>
kindly demonstration of homage and <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg>, <lb/>
but let it run its course unrebuked.</p>
<figure id="f624" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0391"/>
<p>The old ladies stopped and shook hands <lb/>
with the twins with effusion, then gave the <lb/>
judge a friendly nod, and bustled into the <lb/>
seats provided for them. They immediately <lb/>
began to deliver a volley of eager questions <lb/>
at the friends around them: "What is this <lb/>
thing for?" "What is that thing for?" <lb/>
"Who is that young man that's writing at <lb/>
the desk? Why, I declare, it's Jack Bunce! <lb/>
I thought he was sick." "Which is the <lb/>
jury? Why, is <hi rend="italic">that</hi> the jury? Billy Price <lb/>
and Job Turner, and Jack Lounsbury, and&mdash; <lb/>
well, I never!" "Now who would ever a' <lb/>
thought&mdash;"</p>
<figure id="f625" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0391"/>
<p>But they were gently called to order at <lb/>
this point, and asked not to talk in court. <lb/>
<figure id="f626" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0391"/>
<pb n="387" entity="DSSR_000002495_0392"/>
Their tongues fell silent, but the radiant <reg orig="in-|terest">interest</reg> <lb/>
in their faces remained, and their <reg orig="grati-|tude">gratitude</reg> <lb/>
for the blessing of a new sensation and a <lb/>
novel experience still beamed undimmed from <lb/>
their eyes. Aunt Patsy stood up and took <lb/>
the oath, and Mr. Allen explained the point <lb/>
in issue, and asked her to go on, now, in her <lb/>
own way, and throw as much light upon it as <lb/>
she could. She toyed with her reticule a <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
or two, as if considering where to begin, <lb/>
then she said:</p>
<p>"Well, the way of it is this. They are <lb/>
Luigi's legs a week at a time, and then they <lb/>
are Angelo's, and he can do whatever he <lb/>
wants to with them."</p>
<figure id="f627" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0392"/>
<p>"You are making a mistake, Aunt Patsy <lb/>
Cooper," said the judge. "You should n't <lb/>
state that as a <hi rend="italic">fact,</hi> because you don't know <lb/>
it to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a fact."</p>
<p>"What's the reason I don't?" said Aunt <lb/>
Patsy, bridling a little.</p>
<p>"What is the reason that you do know it?"</p>
<p>"The best in the world&mdash;because they told <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>"That is n't a reason."</p>
<figure id="f628" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0392"/>
<pb n="388" entity="DSSR_000002495_0393"/>
<p>"Well, for the land's sake! Betsy Hale, <lb/>
do you hear that?"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Hear</hi> it? I should think so," said Aunt <lb/>
Betsy, rising and facing the court. "Why, <lb/>
Judge, I was there and heard it myself. <lb/>
Luigi says to Angelo&mdash;no, it was Angelo said <lb/>
it to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Come, come, Mrs. Hale, pray sit down, <lb/>
and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Certainly, it's all right, I'm going to sit <lb/>
down presently, but not until I've&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> sit down!"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Must!</hi> Well, upon my word if things <lb/>
ain't getting to a pretty pass when&mdash;"</p>
<p>The house broke into laughter, but was <lb/>
promptly brought to order, and meantime Mr. <lb/>
Allen persuaded the old lady to take her seat. <lb/>
Aunt Patsy continued:</p>
<figure id="f629" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0393"/>
<p>"Yes, they told me that, and I know it's <lb/>
true. They're Luigi's legs this week, but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ah, <hi rend="italic">they</hi> told you that, did they?" said <lb/>
the justice, with interest.</p>
<p>"Well no, I don't know that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> told me, <lb/>
but that's neither here nor there. I know, <lb/>
without that, that at dinner yesterday, Angelo <lb/>
<figure id="f630" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0393"/>
<pb n="389" entity="DSSR_000002495_0394"/>
was as tired as a dog, and yet Luigi would n't <lb/>
lend him the legs to go up-stairs and take a <lb/>
nap with."</p>
<p>"Did he ask for them?"</p>
<p>"Let me see&mdash;it seems to me somehow, <lb/>
that&mdash;that&mdash;Aunt Betsy, do you remember <lb/>
whether he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Never mind about what Aunt Betsy <reg orig="re-|members&mdash;she">remembers&mdash;she</reg> <lb/>
is not a witness; we only want <lb/>
to know what you remember, yourself," said <lb/>
the judge.</p>
<p>"Well, it does seem to me that you are <lb/>
most cantankerously particular about a little <lb/>
thing, Sim Robinson. Why, when I can't <lb/>
remember a thing myself, I always&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ah, <hi rend="italic">please</hi> go on!"</p>
<p>"Now how <hi rend="italic">can</hi> she when you keep fussing <lb/>
at her all the time?" said Aunt Betsy. "Why, <lb/>
with a person pecking at <hi rend="italic">me</hi> that way, I should <lb/>
get that fuzzled and fuddled that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>She was on her feet again, but Allen coaxed <lb/>
her into her seat once more, while the court <lb/>
squelched the mirth of the house. Then the <lb/>
judge said:</p>
<p>"Madam, do you know&mdash;do you <reg orig="abso-|lutely">absolutely</reg> <lb/>
<figure id="f631" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0394"/>
<pb n="390" entity="DSSR_000002495_0395"/>
<hi rend="italic">know,</hi> independently of anything these <lb/>
gentlemen have told you&mdash;that the power <lb/>
over their legs passes from the one to the <lb/>
other regularly every week?"</p>
<p>"Regularly? Bless your heart, regularly <lb/>
ain't any name for the exactness of it! All <lb/>
the big cities in Europe used to set the clocks <lb/>
by it." (Laughter, <hi rend="italic">suppressed by the court.</hi>)</p>
<p>"How do you <hi rend="italic">know?</hi> That is the <reg orig="ques-|tion">question</reg>. <lb/>
Please answer it plainly and squarely."</p>
<p>"Don't you talk to me like that, Sim <lb/>
Robinson&mdash;I won't have it. How do I <lb/>
know, indeed! How do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know what you <lb/>
know? Because somebody told you. You <lb/>
did n't invent it out of your own head, <lb/>
did you? Why, these twins are the <reg orig="truthful-|est">truthfulest</reg> <lb/>
people in the world; and I don't think it <lb/>
becomes you to sit up there and throw slurs <lb/>
at them when they have n't been doing <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
to you. And they are orphans besides <lb/>
&mdash;both of them. All&mdash;"</p>
<p>But Aunt Betsy was up again, now, and <lb/>
both old ladies were talking at once and with <lb/>
all their might; but as the house was <reg orig="welter-|ing">weltering</reg> <lb/>
in a storm of laughter, and the judge was <lb/>
<figure id="f632" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0395"/>
<pb n="391" entity="DSSR_000002495_0396"/>
hammering his desk with an iron paper-weight, <lb/>
one could only see them talk, not hear them. <lb/>
At last, when quiet was restored, the court <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Let the ladies retire."</p>
<p>"But, your honor, I have the right, in the <lb/>
interest of my clients, to cross-exam&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You'll not need to exercise it, Mr. Wilson <lb/>
&mdash;the evidence is thrown out."</p>
<p>"Thrown out!" said Aunt Patsy, ruffled; <lb/>
"and what's it thrown out for, I'd like to <lb/>
know."</p>
<figure id="f633" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0396"/>
<p>"And so would I, Patsy Cooper. It seems <lb/>
to me that if we can save these poor persecuted <lb/>
strangers, it is our bounden duty to stand up <lb/>
here and talk for them till&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There, there, there, <hi rend="italic">do</hi> sit down!"</p>
<p>It cost some trouble and a good deal of <reg orig="coax-|ing">coaxing</reg>, <lb/>
but they were got into their seats at last. <lb/>
The trial was soon ended, now. The twins <lb/>
themselves became witnesses in their own <reg orig="de-|fense">defense</reg>. <lb/>
They established the fact, upon oath, <lb/>
that the leg-power passed from one to the <lb/>
other every Saturday night at twelve o'clock, <lb/>
sharp. But on cross-examination their <reg orig="coun-|sel">counsel</reg> <lb/>
<figure id="f634" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0396"/>
<pb n="392" entity="DSSR_000002495_0397"/>
would not allow them to tell whose week <lb/>
of power the current week was. The judge <lb/>
insisted upon their answering, and proposed <lb/>
to compel them, but even the prosecution <lb/>
took fright and came to the rescue then, and <lb/>
helped stay the sturdy jurist's revolutionary <lb/>
hand. So the case had to go to the jury with <lb/>
that important point hanging in the air. They <lb/>
were out an hour, and brought in this <reg orig="ver-|dict">verdict</reg>:</p>
<figure id="f635" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0397"/>
<p>"We the jury do find: 1, that an assault <lb/>
was committed, as charged; 2, that it was <reg orig="com-|mitted">committed</reg> <lb/>
by one of the persons accused, he <lb/>
having been seen to do it by several credible <lb/>
witnesses: 3, but that his identity is so <lb/>
merged in his brother's that we have not been <lb/>
able to tell which was him. We cannot <reg orig="con-|vict">convict</reg> <lb/>
both, for only one is guilty. We cannot <lb/>
acquit both, for only one is innocent. Our <lb/>
verdict is that justice has been defeated by <lb/>
the dispensation of God, and ask to be <reg orig="dis-|charged">discharged</reg> <lb/>
from further duty."</p>
<p>This was read aloud in court and brought <lb/>
out a burst of hearty applause. The old <lb/>
ladies made a spring at the twins, to shake and <lb/>
<figure id="f636" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0397"/>
<pb n="393" entity="DSSR_000002495_0398"/>
congratulate, but were gently disengaged by <lb/>
Mr. Wilson and softly crowded back into their <lb/>
places.</p>
<p>The Judge rose in his little tribune, laid <lb/>
aside his silver-bowed spectacles, roached his <lb/>
gray hair up with his fingers, and said, with <lb/>
dignity and solemnity, and even with a <reg orig="cer-|tain">certain</reg> <lb/>
pathos:</p>
<p>"In all my experience on the bench, I have <lb/>
not seen Justice bow her head in shame in <lb/>
this court until this day. You little realize <lb/>
what far-reaching harm has just been wrought <lb/>
here under the fickle forms of law. Imitation <lb/>
is the bane of courts&mdash;I thank God that this <lb/>
one is free from the contamination of that vice <lb/>
&mdash;and in no long time you will see the fatal <lb/>
work of this hour seized upon by profligate <lb/>
so-called guardians of justice in all the wide <lb/>
circumstance of this planet and perpetuated in <lb/>
their pernicious decisions. I wash my hands <lb/>
of this iniquity. I would have compelled <lb/>
these culprits to expose their guilt, but <reg orig="sup-|port">support</reg> <lb/>
failed me where I had most right to <reg orig="ex-|pect">expect</reg> <lb/>
aid and encouragement. And I was <lb/>
confronted by a law made in the interest of <lb/>
<figure id="f637" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0398"/>
<pb n="394" entity="DSSR_000002495_0399"/>
crime, which protects the criminal from <reg orig="testify-|ing">testifying</reg> <lb/>
against himself. Yet I had precedents of <lb/>
my own whereby I had set aside that law on <lb/>
two different occasions and thus succeeded in <lb/>
convicting criminals to whose crimes there <lb/>
were no witnesses but themselves. What <lb/>
have you accomplished this day? Do you <lb/>
realize it? You have set adrift, unadmonished, <lb/>
in this community, two men endowed with an <lb/>
awful and mysterious gift, a hidden and grisly <lb/>
power for evil&mdash;a power by which each in his <lb/>
turn may commit crime after crime of the <lb/>
most heinous character, and no man be able <lb/>
to tell which is the guilty or which the <reg orig="inno-|cent">innocent</reg> <lb/>
party in any case of them all. Look to <lb/>
your homes&mdash;look to your property&mdash;look to <lb/>
your lives&mdash;for you have need!</p>

<p>"Prisoners at the bar, stand up. Through <lb/>
suppression of evidence, a jury of your&mdash;our <lb/>

the twins and their counsel with <reg orig="con-|gratulations">congratulations</reg>; <lb/>

Wilson off tavern-wards to feast him <lb/>

was as a fragrance blown from the <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">A Deputation</hi> came in the evening and conferred upon <lb/>
Wilson the welcome honor of a nomination for mayor; <lb/>
for the village has just been converted into a city by <lb/>
charter. Tom skulks out of challenging the twins. <lb/>
Judge Driscoll thereupon challenges Angelo, (accused by <lb/>
Tom of doing the kicking;) he declines, but Luigi accepts <lb/>
in his place against Angelo's timid protest.</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was late Saturday night&mdash;nearing eleven.</p>
<p>The Judge and his second found the rest <lb/>
of the war party at the further end of the <lb/>
vacant ground, near the haunted house. <lb/>
Pudd'nhead Wilson advanced to meet them, <lb/>
and said anxiously&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f641" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0401"/>
<p>"I must say a word in behalf of my prin- <lb/>cipal's proxy, Count Luigi, to whom you have <lb/>
kindly granted the privilege of fighting my <lb/>
principal's battle for him. It is growing <lb/>
late, and Count Luigi is in great trouble lest <lb/>
midnight shall strike before the finish."</p>
<p>"It is another testimony," said Howard, <lb/>
<figure id="f642" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0401"/>
<pb n="397" entity="DSSR_000002495_0402"/>
approvingly. "That young man is fine all <lb/>
through. He wishes to save his brother the <lb/>
sorrow of fighting on the Sabbath, and he is <lb/>
right; it is the right and manly feeling and <lb/>
does him credit. We will make all possible <lb/>
haste."</p>
<p>Wilson said&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f643" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0402"/>
<p>"There is also another reason&mdash;a <reg orig="consid-|eration">consideration</reg>, <lb/>
in fact, which deeply concerns Count <lb/>
Luigi himself. These twins have command <lb/>
of their mutual legs turn about. Count <lb/>
Luigi is in command, now; but at midnight, <lb/>
possession will pass to my principal, Count <reg orig="An-|gelo">Angelo</reg>, <lb/>
and&mdash;well, you can foresee what will <lb/>
happen. He will march straight off the field, <lb/>
and carry Luigi with him."</p>
<p>"Why! sure enough!" cried the Judge, <lb/>
"we have heard something about that <reg orig="ex-|traodinary">extraodinary</reg> <lb/>
law of their being, <reg orig="already&mdash;noth-|ing">already&mdash;nothing</reg> <lb/>
very definite, it is true, as regards dates <lb/>
and durations of the power, but I see it is <lb/>
definite enough as regards to-night. Of course <lb/>
we must give Luigi every chance. Omit all <lb/>
the ceremonial possible, gentlemen, and <lb/>
place us in position."</p>
<figure id="f644" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0402"/>

<p>The seconds at once tossed up a coin; <lb/>
Howard won the choice. He placed the <lb/>
Judge sixty feet from the haunted house and <lb/>
facing it; Wilson placed the twins within <lb/>
fifteen feet of the house and facing the Judge <lb/>
&mdash;necessarily. The pistol-case was opened <lb/>
and the long slim tubes taken out; when the <lb/>
moonlight glinted from them a shiver went <lb/>
through Angelo. The doctor was a fool, <lb/>
but a thoroughly well-meaning one, with a <lb/>
kind heart and a sincere disposition to oblige, <lb/>
but along with it an absence of tact which <lb/>
often hurt its effectiveness. He brought his <lb/>
box of lint and bandages, and asked Angelo <lb/>
to feel and see how soft and comfortable <lb/>
they were. Angelo's head fell over against <lb/>
Luigi's in a faint, and precious time was lost <lb/>
in bringing him to; which provoked Luigi <lb/>
into expressing his mind to the doctor with a <lb/>
good deal of vigor and frankness. After <lb/>
Angelo came to he was still so weak that <lb/>
Luigi was obliged to drink a stiff horn of <lb/>
brandy to brace him up.</p>
<figure id="f646" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0403"/>
<p>The seconds now stepped at once to their <lb/>
posts, half way between the combatants, one <lb/>
<figure id="f647" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0403"/>
<pb n="399" entity="DSSR_000002495_0404"/>
of them on each side of the line of fire. <reg orig="Wil-|son">Wilson</reg> <lb/>
was to count, very deliberately, "One&mdash; <lb/>
two&mdash;three&mdash;fire!&mdash;stop!" and the duelists <lb/>
could bang away at any time they chose during <lb/>
that recitation, but not after the last word. <lb/>
Angelo grew very nervous when he saw <lb/>
Wilson's hand rising slowly into the air as a <lb/>
sign to make ready, and he leaned his head <lb/>
against Luigi's and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"O, please take me away from here, I can't <lb/>
stay, I know I can't!"</p>
<p>"What in the world are you doing? <lb/>
Straighten up! What's the matter with you? <lb/>
&mdash;<hi rend="italic">you're</hi> in no danger&mdash;nobody's going to <lb/>
shoot at you. Straighten up, I tell you!"</p>
<p>Angelo obeyed, just in time to hear&mdash; <lb/>
"One&mdash;!"</p>
<p>"Bang!" Just one report, and a little <lb/>
tuft of white hair floated slowly to the Judge's <lb/>
feet in the moonlight. The Judge did not <lb/>
swerve; he still stood erect and motionless, <lb/>
like a statue, with his pistol-arm hanging <lb/>
straight down at his side. He was reserving <lb/>
his fire.</p>
<p>"Two&mdash;!"</p>
<figure id="f648" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0404"/>
<pb n="400" entity="DSSR_000002495_0405"/>
<p>"Three&mdash;!"</p>
<p>"Fire&mdash;!"</p>
<p>Up came the pistol-arm instantly&mdash;Angelo <lb/>
dodged with the report. He said "Ouch!" <lb/>
and fainted again.</p>
<p>The doctor examined and bandaged the <lb/>
wound. It was of no consequence, he said&mdash; <lb/>bullet through fleshy part of arm&mdash;no bones <lb/>
broken&mdash;the gentleman was still able to fight <lb/>&mdash;let the duel proceed.</p>
<p>Next time Angelo jumped just as Luigi <lb/>
fired, which disordered his aim and caused <lb/>
him to cut a chip out of Howard's ear. The <lb/>
Judge took his time again, and when he fired <lb/>
Angelo jumped and got a knuckle skinned. <lb/>
The doctor inspected and dressed the wounds. <lb/>
Angelo now spoke out and said he was con- <lb/>tent with the satisfaction he had got, and if <lb/>
the Judge&mdash;but Luigi shut him roughly up, <lb/>
and asked him not to make an ass of himself; <lb/>
adding&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f649" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0405"/>
<p>"And I want you to stop dodging. You <lb/>
take a great deal too prominent a part in this <lb/>
thing for a person who has got nothing to do <lb/>
with it. You should remember that you are <lb/>
<figure id="f650" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0405"/>
<pb n="401" entity="DSSR_000002495_0406"/>
here only by courtesy, and are without <reg orig="offi-|cial">official</reg> <lb/>
recognition; officially you are not here at <lb/>
all; officially you do not even exist. To all <lb/>
intents and purposes you are absent from this <lb/>
place, and you ought for your own modesty's <lb/>
sake to reflect that it cannot become a person <lb/>
who is not present here to be taking this sort <lb/>
of public and indecent prominence in a matter <lb/>
in which he is not in the slightest degree <reg orig="con-|cerned">concerned</reg>. <lb/>
Now, don't dodge again; the bullets <lb/>
are not for you, they are for me; if I want <lb/>
them dodged I will attend to it myself. I <lb/>
never saw a person act so."</p>
<p>Angelo saw the reasonableness of what his <lb/>
brother had said, and he did try to reform, <lb/>
but it was of no use; both pistols went off at <lb/>
the same instant, and he jumped once more; <lb/>
he got a sharp scrape along his cheek from <lb/>
the Judge's bullet, and so deflected Luigi's <lb/>
aim that his ball went wide and chipped a <lb/>
flake of skin from Pudd'nhead Wilson's chin. <lb/>
The doctor attended to the wounded.</p>
<p>By the terms, the duel was over. But <lb/>
Luigi was entirely out of patience, and begged <lb/>
for one more exchange of shots, insisting that <lb/>
<figure id="f651" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0406"/>
<pb n="402" entity="DSSR_000002495_0407"/>
he had had no fair chance, on account of his <lb/>
brother's indelicate behavior. Howard was <lb/>
opposed to granting so unusual a privilege, <lb/>
but the Judge took Luigi's part, and added <lb/>
that indeed he himself might fairly be <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
entitled to another trial, because <reg orig="al-|though">although</reg> <lb/>
the proxy on the other side was in no <lb/>
way to blame for his (the Judge's) <reg orig="humiliat-|ingly">humiliatingly</reg> <lb/>
resultless work, the gentleman with <lb/>
whom he was fighting this duel was to blame <lb/>
for it, since if he had played no advantages <lb/>
and had held his head still, his proxy would <lb/>
have been disposed of early. He added&mdash;</p>
<p>"Count Luigi's request for another <reg orig="ex-|change">exchange</reg> <lb/>
is another proof that he is a brave and <lb/>
chivalrous gentleman, and I beg that the <lb/>
courtesy he asks may be accorded him."</p>
<p>"I thank you most sincerely for this <reg orig="gener-|osity">generosity</reg>, <lb/>
Judge Driscoll," said Luigi, with a <lb/>
polite bow, and moving to his place. Then <lb/>
he added&mdash;to Angelo, "Now hold your grip, <lb/>
hold your <hi rend="italic">grip,</hi> I tell you, and I'll land him, <lb/>
sure!"</p>
<p>The men stood erect, their pistol-arms at <lb/>
their sides, the two seconds stood at their <lb/>
<figure id="f652" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0407"/>

official posts, the doctor stood five paces in <lb/>
Wilson's rear with his instruments and <reg orig="band-|ages">bandages</reg> <lb/>
in his hands. The deep stillness, the <lb/>
peaceful moonlight, the motionless figures, <lb/>
made an impressive picture and the <reg orig="impend-|ing">impending</reg> <lb/>
fatal possibilities augmented this <reg orig="impres-|siveness">impressiveness</reg> <lb/>
to solemnity. Wilson's hand began <lb/>
to rise&mdash;slowly&mdash;slowly&mdash;higher&mdash;still higher <lb/>
&mdash;in another moment&mdash;</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Boom!</hi>"&mdash;the first stroke of midnight <lb/>
swung up out of the distance: Angelo was <lb/>
off like a deer!</p>
<p>"Oh, you unspeakable traitor!" wailed his <lb/>
brother, as they went soaring over the fence.</p>
<p>The others stood astonished and gazing; <lb/>
and so stood, watching that strange spectacle <lb/>
until distance dissolved it and swept it from <lb/>
their view. Then they rubbed their eyes <lb/>
like people waking out of a dream.</p>
<p>"Well, I've never seen anything like that <lb/>
before!" said the Judge. "Wilson, I am <reg orig="go-|ing">going</reg> <lb/>
to confess, now, that I was n't quite able <lb/>
to believe in that leg-business, and had a <lb/>
suspicion that it was a put-up convenience <lb/>
between those twins; and when Count <reg orig="An-|gelo">Angelo</reg> <lb/>
<figure id="f653" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0408"/>
<pb n="404" entity="DSSR_000002495_0409"/>
fainted I thought I saw the whole scheme <lb/>
&mdash;thought it was pretext No. I, and would be <lb/>
followed by others till twelve o'clock should <lb/>
arrive and Luigi would get off with all the <lb/>
credit of seeming to want to fight and yet <lb/>
not have to fight, after all. But I was <reg orig="mis-|taken">mistaken</reg>. <lb/>
His pluck proved it. He's a brave <lb/>
fellow and did want to fight."</p>
<p>"There is n't any doubt about that," said <lb/>
Howard, and added in a grieved tone, "but <lb/>
what an unworthy sort of Christian that <lb/>
Angelo is&mdash;I hope and believe there are not <lb/>
many like him. It is not right to engage in <lb/>
a duel on the Sabbath&mdash;I could not approve <lb/>
of that myself; but to finish one that has <lb/>
been begun&mdash;that is a duty, let the day be <lb/>
what it may."</p>
<p>They strolled along, still wondering, still <lb/>
talking.</p>
<p>"It is a curious circumstance," remarked <lb/>
the surgeon, halting Wilson a moment to <lb/>
paste some more court plaster on his chin, <lb/>
which had gone to leaking blood again, "that <lb/>
in this duel neither of the parties who handled <lb/>
the pistols lost blood, while nearly all the <lb/>
<figure id="f654" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0409"/>
<pb n="405" entity="DSSR_000002495_0410"/>
persons present in the mere capacity of guests <lb/>
got hit. I have not heard of such a thing <lb/>
before. Don't you think it unusual?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the Judge, "it has struck me <lb/>
as peculiar. Peculiar and unfortunate. I <lb/>
was annoyed at it, all the time. In the case <lb/>
of Angelo it made no great difference, because <lb/>
he was in a measure concerned, though not <lb/>
officially; but it troubled me to see the <lb/>
seconds compromised, and yet I knew no way <lb/>
to mend the matter."</p>
<p>"There was no way to mend it," said <lb/>
Howard, whose ear was being readjusted <lb/>
now by the doctor; "the code fixes our <lb/>
place, and it would not have been lawful to <lb/>
change it. If we could have stood at your <lb/>
side, or behind you, or in front of you, it&mdash; <lb/>
but it would not have been legitimate and the <lb/>
other parties would have had a just right to <lb/>
complain of our trying to protect ourselves <lb/>
from danger; infractions of the code are <lb/>
certainly not permissible in any case <reg orig="what-|ever">whatever</reg>."</p>
<p>Wilson offered no remarks. It seemed to <lb/>
him that there was very little place here for <lb/>
<figure id="f655" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0410"/>
<pb n="406" entity="DSSR_000002495_0411"/>
so much solemnity, but he judged that if a <lb/>
duel where nobody was in danger or got <lb/>
crippled but the seconds and the outsiders had <lb/>
nothing ridiculous about for these gentlemen, <lb/>
his pointing out that feature would probably <lb/>
not help them to see it.</p>
<p>He invited them in to take a nightcap, and <lb/>
Howard and the Judge accepted, but the <lb/>
doctor said he would have to go and see how <lb/>
Angelo's principal wound was getting on.</p>
<p>[It was now Sunday, and in the afternoon Angelo was <lb/>
to be received into the Baptist communion by immersion <lb/>
&mdash;a doubtful prospect, the doctor feared.]</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> the doctor arrived at Aunt Patsy <lb/>
Cooper's house, he found the lights going and <lb/>
everybody up and dressed and in a great state <lb/>
of solicitude and excitement. The twins <lb/>
were stretched on a sofa in the sitting-room, <lb/>
Aunt Patsy was fussing at Angelo's arm, <lb/>
Nancy was flying around under her commands, <lb/>
the two young boys were trying to keep out <lb/>
of the way and always getting in it, in order <lb/>
to see and wonder, Rowena stood apart, <reg orig="help-|less">helpless</reg> <lb/>
with apprehension and emotion, and <lb/>
Luigi was growling in unappeasable fury over <lb/>
Angelo's shameful flight.</p>
<p>As has been reported before, the doctor <lb/>
was a fool&mdash;a kindhearted and well-meaning <lb/>
one, but with no tact; and as he was by long <lb/>
odds the most learned physician in the town, <lb/>
<figure id="f657" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0412"/>
<pb n="408" entity="DSSR_000002495_0413"/>
and was quite well aware of it, and could talk <lb/>
his learning with ease and precision, and liked <lb/>
to show off when he had an audience, he was <lb/>
sometimes tempted into revealing more of a <lb/>
case than was good for the patient.</p>
<p>He examined Angelo's wound, and was <lb/>
really minded to say nothing for once; but <lb/>
Aunt Patsy was so anxious and so pressing <lb/>
that he allowed his caution to be overcome, <lb/>
and proceeded to empty himself as follows, <lb/>
with scientific relish&mdash;</p>
<figure id="f658" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0413"/>
<p>"Without going too much into detail, <lb/>
madam&mdash;for you would probably not <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg> <lb/>
it anyway&mdash;I concede that great care is <lb/>
going to be necessary here; otherwise <reg orig="exu-|dation">exudation</reg> <lb/>
of the aesophagus is nearly sure to <reg orig="en-|sue">ensue</reg>, <lb/>
and this will be followed by ossification <lb/>
and extradition of the maxillaris superioris, <lb/>
which must decompose the granular surfaces <lb/>
of the great infusorial ganglionic system, thus <lb/>
obstructing the action of the posterior <reg orig="vario-|loid">varioloid</reg> <lb/>
arteries, and precipitating compound <lb/>
strangulated sorosis of the valvular tissues, <lb/>
and ending unavoidably in the dispersion and <lb/>
combustion of the marsupial fluxes and the <lb/>
<figure id="f659" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0413"/>
<pb n="409" entity="DSSR_000002495_0414"/>
consequent embrocation of the bicuspid <lb/>
populo redax referendum rotulorum."</p>
<p>A miserable silence followed. Aunt Patsy's <lb/>
heart sank, the pallor of despair invaded her <lb/>
face, she was not able to speak; poor Rowena <lb/>
wrung her hands in privacy and silence, and <lb/>
said to herself in the bitterness of her young <lb/>
grief, "There is no hope&mdash;it is plain there is <lb/>
no hope;" the good-hearted negro wench, <lb/>
Nancy, paled to chocolate, then to orange, <lb/>
then to amber, and thought to herself with <lb/>
yearning sympathy and sorrow, "Po' thing, <lb/>
he ain' gwyne to las' throo de half o' dat;" small <lb/>
Henry choked up, and turned his head away <lb/>
to hide his rising tears, and his brother Joe <lb/>
said to himself, with a sense of loss, "The <lb/>
baptizing's busted, that's sure." Luigi was <lb/>
the only person who had any heart to speak. <lb/>
He said, a little bit sharply, to the doctor&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, well, there's nothing to be gained <lb/>
by wasting precious time: give him a barrel <lb/>
of pills&mdash;I'll take them for him."</p>
<p>"You?" asked the doctor.</p>
<p>"Yes. Did you suppose he was going to <lb/>
take them himself?"</p>
<figure id="f660" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0414"/>
<pb n="410" entity="DSSR_000002495_0415"/>
<p>"Why, of course."</p>
<p>"Well, it's a mistake. He never took a <lb/>
dose of medicine in his life. He can't."</p>
<p>"Well, upon my word, it's the most <reg orig="extraor-|dinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
thing I ever heard of!"</p>
<p>"Oh," said Aunt Patsy, as pleased as a <lb/>
mother whose child is being admired and <lb/>
wondered at, "you'll find that there's more <lb/>
about them that's wonderful than their just <lb/>
being made in the image of God like the rest <lb/>
of His creatures, now you can depend on that, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> tell you," and she wagged her complacent <lb/>
head like one who could reveal marvelous <lb/>
things if she chose.</p>
<p>The boy Joe began&mdash;</p>
<p>"Why, ma, they <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> made in the im&mdash;"</p>
<figure id="f661" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0415"/>
<p>"You shut up, and wait till you're asked, <lb/>
Joe. I'll let you know when I want help. <lb/>
Are you looking for something, Doctor?"</p>
<p>The doctor asked for a few sheets of paper <lb/>
and a pen, and said he would write a <reg orig="prescrip-|tion">prescription</reg>; <lb/>
which he did. It was one of Galen's; <lb/>
in fact, it was Galen's favorite, and had been <lb/>
slaying people for sixteen thousand years. <lb/>
Galen used it for everything, applied it to <lb/>
<figure id="f662" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0415"/>
<pb n="411" entity="DSSR_000002495_0416"/>
everything, said it would remove everything, <lb/>
from warts all the way through to lungs&mdash;and <lb/>
it generally did. Galen was still the only <lb/>
medical authority recognized in Missouri; <lb/>
his practice was the only practice known to <lb/>
the Missouri doctors, and his prescriptions <lb/>
were the only ammunition they carried when <lb/>
they went out for game. By and by Dr. <lb/>
Claypool laid down his pen and read the <reg orig="re-|sult">result</reg> <lb/>
of his labors aloud, carefully and <reg orig="deliber-|ately">deliberately</reg>, <lb/>
for this battery must be constructed on <lb/>
the premises by the family, and mistakes <lb/>
could occur; for he wrote a doctor's hand&mdash; <lb/>
the hand which from the beginning of time <lb/>
has been so disastrous to the apothecary and <lb/>
so profitable to the undertaker:</p>

closed tight. Keep Count Angelo nicely <lb/>
covered up with six or seven blankets, and <lb/>
when he is thirsty&mdash;which will be frequently <lb/>
&mdash;moisten a rag in the vapor of the tea-kettle <lb/>

hungry&mdash;which will also be frequently&mdash;he <lb/>
must not be humored oftener than every <lb/>
seven or eight hours; then toast part of a <lb/>
cracker until it begins to brown, and give it <lb/>
to his brother."</p>
<p>"That is all very well, as far as Angelo is <lb/>
concerned," said Luigi, "but what am I to <lb/>
eat?"</p>
<figure id="f666" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0418"/>
<p>"I do not see that there is anything the <lb/>
matter with you," the doctor answered, "you <lb/>
may of course eat what you please."</p>
<p>"And also drink what I please, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly&mdash;at present. When the <lb/>
violent and continuous perspiring has reduced <lb/>
your strength, I shall have to reduce your <lb/>
diet, of course, and also bleed you, but there <lb/>
is no occasion for that yet awhile." He <lb/>
turned to Aunt Patsy and said: "He must <lb/>
be put to bed, and sat up with, and tended <lb/>

with the greatest care, and not allowed to stir <lb/>
for several days and nights."</p>
<p>"For one, I'm sacredly thankful for that," <lb/>
said Luigi, "it postpones the funeral&mdash;I'm <lb/>
not to be drowned to-day, anyhow."</p>
<p>Angelo said quietly to the doctor:</p>
<p>"I will cheerfully submit to all your <reg orig="re-|quirements">requirements</reg>, <lb/>
sir, up to two o'clock this <reg orig="after-|noon">afternoon</reg>, <lb/>
and will resume them after three, but <lb/>
cannot be confined to the house during that <lb/>
intermediate hour."</p>
<p>"Why, may I ask?"</p>
<p>"Because I have entered the Baptist <reg orig="com-|munion">communion</reg>, <lb/>
and by appointment am to be <reg orig="bap-|tized">baptized</reg> <lb/>
in the river at that hour."</p>
<p>"Oh, insanity!&mdash;it cannot be allowed!"</p>
<p>Angelo answered with placid firmness&mdash;</p>
<p>"Nothing shall prevent it, if I am alive."</p>
<p>"Why, consider, my dear sir, in your <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
it might prove fatal."</p>
<p>A tender and ecstatic smile beamed from <lb/>
Angelo's eyes, and he broke forth in a tone of <lb/>
joyous fervency&mdash;</p>
<p>"Ah, how blessed it would be to die for <lb/>
such a cause&mdash;it would be martydom!"</p>
<figure id="f668" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0419"/>
<pb n="415" entity="DSSR_000002495_0420"/>
<p>"But your brother&mdash;consider your brother; <lb/>
you would be risking his life, too."</p>
<p>"He risked mine an hour ago," responded <lb/>
Angelo, gloomily; "did he consider me?" <lb/>
A thought swept through his mind that made <lb/>
him shudder. "If I had not run, I might <lb/>
have been killed in a duel on the Sabbath day, <lb/>
and my soul would have been lost&mdash;lost."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't fret, it was n't in any danger," said <lb/>
Luigi, irritably; "they wouldn't waste it for a <lb/>
little thing like that; there's a glass case all <lb/>
ready for it in the heavenly museum, and a <lb/>
pin to stick it up with."</p>
<p>Aunt Patsy was shocked, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Looy, Looy!&mdash;don't talk so, dear!"</p>
<p>Rowena's soft heart was pierced by Luigi's <lb/>
unfeeling words, and she murmured to herself, <lb/>
"Oh, if I but had the dear privilege of <reg orig="protect-|ing">protecting</reg> <lb/>
and defending him with my weak voice! <lb/>
&mdash;but alas, this sweet boon is denied me by <lb/>
the cruel conventions of social intercourse."</p>
<p>"Get their bed ready," said Aunt Patsy to <lb/>
Nancy, "and shut up the windows and doors, <lb/>
and light their candles, and see that you drive <lb/>
all the mosquitoes out of their bar, and make <lb/>

some bags of hot ashes to lay to his feet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>&mdash;"and a shovel of fire for his head, and a <lb/>
mustard plaster for his neck, and some gum <lb/>
shoes for his ears," Luigi interrupted, with <lb/>
temper; and added, to himself, "Damnation, <lb/>
I'm going to be roasted alive, I just know it!"</p>
<p>"Why, Looy! Do be quiet; I never saw <lb/>
such a fractious thing. A body would think <lb/>
you did n't care for your brother."</p>
<p>"I don't&mdash;to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> extent, Aunt Patsy. I was <lb/>
glad the drowning was postponed a minute <lb/>
ago, but I'm not, now. No, that is all gone <lb/>
by: I want to be drowned."</p>
<figure id="f670" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0421"/>
<p>"You'll bring a judgment on yourself just <lb/>
as sure as you live, if you go on like that. <lb/>
Why, I never heard the beat of it. Now, <lb/>
there,&mdash;there! you've said enough. Not <lb/>

<p>"But, Aunt Patsy&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Luigi! Did n't you hear what I told <lb/>
you?"</p>
<p>"But, Aunt Patsy, I&mdash;why, I'm not going <lb/>
to set my heart and lungs afloat in that pail of <lb/>

sewage which this criminal here has been <lb/>
prescri&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, you are, too. You are going to be <lb/>
good, and do everything I tell you, like a <lb/>
dear," and she tapped his cheek affectionately <lb/>
with her finger. "Rowena, take the <reg orig="prescrip-|tion">prescription</reg> <lb/>
and go in the kitchen and hunt up the <lb/>
things and lay them out for me. I'll sit up <lb/>
with my patient the rest of the night. Doctor; <lb/>
I can't trust Nancy, she couldn't make Luigi <lb/>
take the medicine. Of course you'll drop in <lb/>
again during the day. Have you got any <lb/>
more directions?"</p>
<p>"No, I believe not, Aunt Patsy. If I don't <lb/>
get in earlier, I'll be along by early candlelight, <lb/>
anyway. Meantime, don't allow him to get <lb/>
out of his bed."</p>
<figure id="f672" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0422"/>
<p>Angelo said, with calm determination&mdash;</p>
<p>"I shall be baptized at two o'clock. <reg orig="Noth-|ing">Nothing</reg> <lb/>
but death shall prevent me."</p>
<p>The doctor said nothing aloud, but to <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
he said:</p>
<p>"Why, this chap's got a manly side, after <lb/>
all! Physically he's a coward, but morally <lb/>
he's a lion. I'll go and tell the others about <lb/>

this; it will raise him a good deal in their <lb/>
estimation&mdash;and the public will follow their <lb/>
lead, of course."</p>
<p>Privately, Aunt Patsy applauded too, and <lb/>
was proud of Angelo's courage in the moral <lb/>
field as she was of Luigi's in the field of <lb/>
honor.</p>
<p>The boy Henry was troubled, but the boy <lb/>
Joe said, inaudibly, and gratefully, "We're <lb/>
all hunky, after all; and no postponement on <lb/>
account of the weather."</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">By</hi> nine o'clock the town was humming <lb/>
with the news of the midnight duel, and <lb/>
there were but two opinions about it: one, <lb/>
that Luigi's pluck in the field was most <lb/>
praiseworthy and Angelo's flight most <reg orig="scan-|dalous">scandalous</reg>; <lb/>
the other, that Angelo's courage in <lb/>
flying the field for conscience' sake was as <lb/>
fine and creditable as was Luigi's in holding <lb/>
the field in the face of the bullets. The one <lb/>
opinion was held by half of the town, the <lb/>
other one was maintained by the other half. <lb/>
The division was clean and exact, and it <lb/>
made two parties, an Angelo party and a <lb/>
Luigi party. The twins had suddenly become <lb/>
popular idols along with Pudd'nhead Wilson, <lb/>
and haloed with a glory as intense as his. <lb/>
The children talked the duel all the way to <lb/>
Sunday-school, their elders talked it all the <lb/>
<figure id="f675" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0424"/>
<pb n="420" entity="DSSR_000002495_0425"/>
way to church, the choir discussed it behind <lb/>
their red curtain, it usurped the place of pious <lb/>
thought in the "nigger gallery."</p>
<p>By noon the doctor had added the news, <lb/>
and spread it, that Count Angelo, in spite of <lb/>
his wound and all warnings and supplications, <lb/>
was resolute in his determination to be <reg orig="bap-|tised">baptised</reg> <lb/>
at the hour appointed. This swept the <lb/>
town like wildfire, and mightily reinforced the <lb/>
enthusism of the Angelo faction, who said, <lb/>
"If any doubted that it was moral courage <lb/>
that took him from the field, what have they <lb/>
to say now!"</p>
<p>Still the excitement grew. All the <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
it was traveling countrywards, toward all <lb/>
points of the compass; so, whereas before only <lb/>
the farmers and their wives were intending to <lb/>
come and witness the remarkable baptism, a <lb/>
general holiday was now proclaimed and the <lb/>
children and negroes admitted to the privileges <lb/>
of the occasion. All the farms for ten miles <lb/>
around were vacated, all the converging roads <lb/>
emptied long processions of wagons, horses and <lb/>
yeomanry into the town. The pack and cram <lb/>
of people vastly exceeded any that had ever <lb/>
<figure id="f676" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0425"/>
<pb n="421" entity="DSSR_000002495_0426"/>
been seen in that sleepy region before. The <lb/>
only thing that had ever even approached it, <lb/>
was the time long gone by, but never <reg orig="forgot-|ten">forgotten</reg>, <lb/>
nor even referred to without wonder and <lb/>
pride, when two circuses and a Fourth of July <lb/>
fell together. But the glory of that occasion <lb/>
was extinguished, now, for good. It was but <lb/>
a freshet to this deluge.</p>
<p>The great invasion massed itself on the <lb/>
river bank and waited hungrily for the <reg orig="im-|mense">immense</reg> <lb/>
event. Waited, and wondered if it <lb/>
would really happen, or if the twin who was not <lb/>
a "professor" would stand out and prevent it.</p>
<p>But they were not to be disappointed. <lb/>
Angelo was as good as his word. He came <lb/>
attended by an escort of honor composed of <lb/>
several hundred of the best citizens, all of the <lb/>
Angelo party; and when the immersion was <lb/>
finished they escorted him back home; and <lb/>
would even have carried him on their <reg orig="shoul-|ders">shoulders</reg>, <lb/>
but that people might think they were <lb/>
carrying Luigi.</p>
<p>Far into the night the citizens continued <lb/>
to discuss and wonder over the <reg orig="strangely-|mated">strangely-mated</reg> <lb/>
pair of incidents that had distinguished <lb/>
<figure id="f677" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0426"/>
<pb n="422" entity="DSSR_000002495_0427"/>
and exalted the past twenty-four hours above <lb/>
any other twenty-four in the history of their <lb/>
town for picturesqueness and splendid <reg orig="inter-|est">interest</reg>; <lb/>
and long before the lights were out and <lb/>
burghers asleep it had been decided on all <lb/>
hands that in capturing these twins Dawson's <lb/>
Landing had drawn a prize in the great <reg orig="lot-|tery">lottery</reg> <lb/>
of municipal fortune.</p>
<p>At midnight Angelo was sleeping peacefully. <lb/>
His immersion had not harmed him, it had <lb/>
merely made him wholesomely drowsy, and he <lb/>
had been dead asleep many hours now. It <lb/>
had made Luigi drowsy, too, but he had got <lb/>
only brief naps, on account of his having to <lb/>
take the medicine every three-quarters of an <lb/>
hour&mdash;and Annt Betsy Hale was there to see <lb/>
that he did it. When he complained and <lb/>
resisted, she was quietly firm with him, and <lb/>
said in a low voice:</p>
<figure id="f678" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0427"/>
<p>"No&mdash;no, that won't do; you must n't talk, <lb/>

either&mdash;you'll wake up your poor brother."</p>

and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Sick, is he? Well, I wish I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Sh-h-h! Will you be quiet, Luigi! Here, <lb/>
now, take the rest of it&mdash;don't keep me <reg orig="hold-|ing">holding</reg> <lb/>
the dipper all night. I declare if you <lb/>
have n't left a good fourth of it in the bottom! <lb/>
Come&mdash;that's a good boy."</p>
<p>"Aunt Betsy, don't make me! I feel like <lb/>
I've swallowed a cemetery; I do, indeed. Do <lb/>
let me rest a little&mdash;just a little; I can't take <lb/>
any more of the devilish stuff, now."</p>
<p>"Luigi! Using such language here, and <lb/>
him just baptised! Do you want the roof to <lb/>
fall on you?"</p>
<p>"I wish to goodness it would!"</p>
<figure id="f680" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0428"/>
<p>"Why, you dreadful thing! I've a good <lb/>
notion to&mdash;let that blanket alone; do you <lb/>
want your brother to catch his death?"</p>
<p>"Aunt Betsy, I've <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to have it off, I'm <lb/>
being roasted alive; nobody could stand it&mdash; <lb/>
you could n't, yourself."</p>
<p>"Now, then, you're sneezing again&mdash;I just <lb/>
expected it."</p>
<p>"Because I've caught a cold in my head. <lb/>

I always do, when I go in the water with my <lb/>
clothes on. And it takes me weeks to get <lb/>
over it, too. I think it was a shame to serve <lb/>
me so."</p>
<p>"Luigi, you are unreasonable; you know <lb/>
very well they couldn't baptise him dry. I <lb/>
should think you would be willing to <reg orig="under-|go">undergo</reg> <lb/>
a little inconvenience for your brother's <lb/>
sake."</p>
<p>"Inconvenience! Now how you talk, <lb/>
Aunt Betsy. I came as near as anything to <lb/>

do you call this inconvenience?&mdash;the room <lb/>
shut up as tight as a drum, and so hot the <lb/>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">During</hi> Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday <lb/>
the twins grew steadily worse; but then the <lb/>
doctor was summoned south to attend his <lb/>
mother's funeral and they got well in <reg orig="forty-|eight">forty-eight</reg> <lb/>
hours. They appeared on the street on <lb/>
Friday, and were welcomed with enthusiasm <lb/>
by the new-born parties, the Luigi and Angelo <lb/>
factions. The Luigi faction carried its <lb/>
strength into the Democratic party, the <reg orig="An-|gelo">Angelo</reg> <lb/>
faction entered into a combination with <lb/>
the Whigs. The Democrats nominated Luigi <lb/>
for alderman under the new city government, <lb/>
and the Whigs put up Angelo against him. <lb/>
The Democrats nominated Pudd'nhead <reg orig="Wil-|son">Wilson</reg> <lb/>
for mayor, and he was left alone in this <lb/>
glory, for the Whigs had no man who was <lb/>
willing to enter the lists against such a <reg orig="formi-|dable">formidable</reg> <lb/>

<pb n="426" entity="DSSR_000002495_0431"/>
such a compliment as this before in the history <lb/>
of the Mississippi Valley.</p>
<p>The political campaign in Dawson's <reg orig="Land-|ing">Landing</reg> <lb/>
opened in a pretty warm fashion, and <lb/>
waxed hotter every week. Luigi's whole heart <lb/>
was in it, and even Angelo developed a <reg orig="sur-|prising">surprising</reg> <lb/>
amount of interest&mdash;which was natural, <lb/>
because he was not merely representing <reg orig="Whig-|ism">Whigism</reg>, <lb/>
a matter of no consequence to him, but he <lb/>
was representing something immensely finer <lb/>
and greater&mdash;to wit, Reform. In him was <reg orig="cen-|tred">centred</reg> <lb/>
the hopes of the whole reform element of <lb/>
the town; he was the chosen and admired <lb/>
champion of every clique that had a pet <reg orig="re-|form">reform</reg> <lb/>
of any sort or kind at heart. He was <lb/>
president of the great Teetotaller's Union, its <lb/>
chiefest prophet and mouthpiece.</p>
<p>But as the canvass went on, troubles began <lb/>
to spring up all around&mdash;troubles for the <lb/>
twins, and through them for all the parties <lb/>
and segments and fractions of parties. <reg orig="When-|ever">Whenever</reg> <lb/>
Luigi had possession of the legs, he <reg orig="car-|ried">carried</reg> <lb/>
Angelo to balls, rum shops, Sons of <lb/>
Liberty parades, horse races, campaign riots, <lb/>
and everywhere else that could damage him <lb/>
with his party and the church; and when it <lb/>
<figure id="f684" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0431"/>
<pb n="427" entity="DSSR_000002495_0432"/>
was Angelo's week he carried Luigi diligently <lb/>
to all manner of moral and religious <reg orig="gather-|ings">gatherings</reg>, <lb/>
doing his best to regain the ground he <lb/>
had lost before. As a result of these double <lb/>
performances, there was a storm blowing all <lb/>
the time, an ever rising storm, too&mdash;a storm <lb/>
of frantic criticism of the twins, and rage over <lb/>
their extravagant, incomprehensible conduct.</p>
<p>Luigi had the final chance. The legs were <lb/>
his for the closing week of the canvas. He <lb/>
led his brother a fearful dance.</p>
<p>But he saved his best card for the very eve <lb/>
of the election. There was to be a grand <lb/>
turn-out of the Teetotaller's Union that day, <lb/>
and Angelo was to march at the head of the <lb/>
procession and deliver a great oration <reg orig="after-|ward">afterward</reg>. <lb/>
Luigi drank a couple of glasses of <lb/>
whiskey&mdash;which steadied his nerves and <reg orig="clari-|fied">clarified</reg> <lb/>
his mind, but made Angelo drunk. <lb/>
Everybody who saw the march, saw that the <lb/>
Champion of the Teetotallers was half seas <lb/>
over, and noted also that his brother, who <lb/>
made no hypocritical protensions to extra <lb/>
temperance virtues, was dignified and sober. <lb/>
This eloquent fact could not be unfruitful at <lb/>
the end of a hot political canvass. At the <lb/>
<figure id="f685" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0432"/>
<pb n="428" entity="DSSR_000002495_0433"/>
mass meeting Angelo tried to make his great <lb/>
temperance oration but was so discommoded <lb/>
by hiccoughs and thickness of tongue that he <lb/>
had to give it up; then drowsiness overtook <lb/>
him and his head drooped against Luigi's <lb/>
and he went to sleep. Luigi apologized for <lb/>
him, and was going on to improve his <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
with an appeal for a moderation of what <lb/>
he called "the prevailing teetotal madness," <lb/>
but persons in the audience began to howl and <lb/>
throw things at him, and then the meeting <lb/>
rose in wrath and chased him home.</p>
<p>This episode was a crusher for Angelo in <lb/>
another way. It destroyed his chances with <lb/>
Rowena. Those chances had been growing, <lb/>
right along, for two months. Rowena had <lb/>
partly confessed that she loved him, but wanted <lb/>
time to consider. Now the tender dream <lb/>
was ended, and she told him so, the moment <lb/>
he was sober enough to understand. She said <lb/>
she would never marry a man who drank.</p>
<p>"But I don't drink," he pleaded.</p>
<p>"That is nothing to the point," she said, <lb/>
coldly, "you get drunk, and that is worse."</p>
<p>[There was a long and sufficiently idiotic discussion <lb/>
here, which ended as reported in a previous note.]</p>

Angelo had the legs, and was in too subdued <lb/>
a condition to want to go out and mingle <lb/>
with an irritated community that had come to <lb/>
distrust and detest him because there was <lb/>
such a lack of harmony between his morals, <lb/>
which were confessedly excellent, and his <lb/>
methods of illustrating them, which were <reg orig="dis-|tinctly">distinctly</reg> <lb/>
damnable.</p>
<p>The new city officers were sworn in on the <lb/>
following Monday&mdash;at least all but Luigi. <lb/>
There was a complication in his case. His <lb/>
election was conceded, but he could not sit <lb/>
<figure id="f687" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0434"/>
<pb n="430" entity="DSSR_000002495_0435"/>
in the board of aldermen without his brother, <lb/>
and his brother could not sit there because <lb/>
he was not a member. There seemed to be <lb/>
no way out of the difficulty but to carry the <lb/>
matter into the courts, so this was resolved <lb/>
upon. The case was set for the Monday <lb/>
fortnight. In due course the time arrived. <lb/>
In the meantime the city government had <lb/>
been at a stand-still, because without Luigi <lb/>
there was a tie in the board of aldermen, <lb/>
whereas with him the liquor interest&mdash;the <lb/>
richest in the political field&mdash;would have one <lb/>
majority. But the court decided that Angelo <lb/>
could not sit in the board with him, either in <lb/>
public or executive sessions, and at the same <lb/>
time forbade the board to deny admission <lb/>
to Luigi, a fairly and legally chosen alderman. <lb/>
The case was carried up and up from court <lb/>
to court, yet still the same old original <reg orig="decis-|ion">decision</reg> <lb/>
was confirmed every time. As a result, <lb/>
the city government not only stood still, <lb/>
with its hands tied, but everything it was <lb/>
created to protect and care for went a steady <lb/>
gait toward rack and ruin. There was no <lb/>
way to levy a tax, so the minor officals had <lb/>
<figure id="f688" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002495_0435"/>
<pb n="431" entity="DSSR_000002495_0436"/>
to resign or starve; therefore they resigned. <lb/>
There being no city money, the enormous <lb/>
legal expenses on both sides had to be <reg orig="de-|frayed">defrayed</reg> <lb/>
by private subscription. But at last <lb/>
the people came to their senses, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Pudd'nhead was right, at the start&mdash;we <lb/>
ought to have hired the official half of that <lb/>
human phillipene to resign; but it's too late, <lb/>
now; some of us have n't got anything left to <lb/>
hire him with."</p>
<p>"Yes, we have," said another citizen, <lb/>
"we've got this"&mdash;and he produced a halter.</p>
<p>Many shouted, "That's the ticket." But <lb/>
others said, "No&mdash;Count Angelo is innocent; <lb/>
we must n't hang him."</p>
<p>"Who said anything about hanging him? <lb/>
We are only going to hang the other one."</p>
<p>"Then that is all right&mdash;there is no <reg orig="objec-|tion">objection</reg> <lb/>
to that."</p>
<p>So they hanged Luigi. And so ends the <lb/>
history of "Those Extraordinary Twins."</p>

<head>FINAL REMARKS.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">As</hi> you see, it was an extravagant sort of a tale, <lb/>
and had no purpose but to exhibit that monstrous <lb/>
"freak" in all sorts of grotesque lights. But when <lb/>
Roxy wandered into the tale she had to be <reg orig="fur-|nished">furnished</reg> <lb/>
with something to do; so she changed the <lb/>
children in the cradle: this necessitated the invention <lb/>
of a reason for it; this in turn resulted in making <lb/>
the children prominent personages&mdash;nothing could <lb/>
prevent it, of course. Their career began to take a <lb/>
tragic aspect, and some one had to be brought in <lb/>
to help work the machinery; so Pudd'n head Wilson <lb/>
was introduced and taken on trial. By this time <lb/>
the whole show was being run by the new people <lb/>
and in their interest, and the original show was <reg orig="be-|come">become</reg> <lb/>
side-tracked and forgotten; the twin-monster <lb/>
and the heroine and the lads and the old ladies had <lb/>
dwindled to inconsequentialities and were merely <lb/>
in the way. Their story was one story, the new <lb/>
people's story was another story, and there was no <lb/>
connection between them, no interdependence, no <lb/>
kinship. It is not practicable or rational to try to <lb/>
tell two stories at the same time; so I dug out the <lb/>
farce and left the tragedy.</p>
<p>The reader already knew how the expert works; <lb/>
he knows now how the other kind do it.</p>
