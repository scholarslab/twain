     <p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> starting point of this lecturing-trip around the <lb/> world
      was Paris, where we had been living a year <lb/> or two.</p>
     <p>We sailed for America, and there made certain <reg orig="prepara-|tions">preparations</reg>.
      <lb/> This took but little time. Two members of my <lb/> family elected to go with me. Also a
      carbuncle. The <reg orig="dic-|tionary">dictionary</reg>
      <lb/> says a carbuncle is a kind of jewel. Humor is out <lb/> of place in a dictionary.</p>
     <p>We started westward from New York in midsummer, <lb/> with Major Pond to manage the
      platform-business as far as <lb/> the Pacific. It was warm work, all the way, and the last
      <lb/> fortnight of it was suffocatingly smoky, for in Oregon and <lb/> British Columbia the
      forest fires were raging. We had an <lb/> added week of smoke at the seaboard, where we were
      obliged <lb/> to wait awhile for our ship. She had been getting herself <lb/> ashore in the
      smoke, and she had to be docked and repaired. <lb/> We sailed at last; and so ended a
      snail-paced march across the <lb/> continent, which had lasted forty days.</p>
     <p>We moved westward about mid-afternoon over a rippled and <lb/> sparkling summer sea; an
      enticing sea, a clean and cool sea, and <lb/> apparently a welcome sea to all on board; it
      certainly was to <lb/> me, after the distressful dustings and smokings and swelterings
       <lb/><pb n="26" entity="DSSR_000002496_0041"/> of the past weeks. The voyage would furnish a
      three-weeks <lb/> holiday, with hardly a break in it. We had the whole Pacific <lb/> Ocean in
      front of us, with nothing to do but do nothing and <lb/> be comfortable. The <lb/> city of
      Victoria was <lb/> twinkling dim in the <lb/> deep heart <lb/> of her <lb/>
      <reg orig="smoke-|cloud">smoke-cloud</reg>, <lb/> and <lb/> getting ready to <lb/> vanish; and
      now <lb/> we closed the <reg orig="field-|glasses">field-glasses</reg>
      <lb/> and sat <lb/> down on our <lb/> steamer chairs contented and at peace. But they went to
      <lb/> wreck and ruin under us and brought us to shame before all <lb/> the passengers. They
      had been furnished by the largest <reg orig="fur-|niture-dealing">furniture-dealing</reg>
      <lb/> house in Victoria, and were worth a couple of <lb/> farthings a dozen, though they had
      cost us the price of honest <lb/> chairs. In the Pacific and Indian Oceans one must still
      bring <lb/> his own deck-chair on board or go without, just as in the old <lb/> forgotten
      Atlantic times&mdash;those Dark Ages of sea travel.</p>

      <p>EVEN THE GULLS SMILED.</p>

     <p>Ours was a reasonably comfortable ship, with the <reg orig="custom-|ary">customary</reg>
      <lb/> sea-going fare&mdash;plenty of good food furnished by the <lb/> Deity and cooked by
      the devil. The discipline observable on <lb/> board was perhaps as good as it is anywhere in
      the Pacific and <lb/> Indian Oceans. The ship was not very well arranged for tropi- <lb/>
      <pb n="27" entity="DSSR_000002496_0042"/> cal service; but that is nothing, for this is the rule
      for ships <lb/> which ply in the tropics. She had an over-supply of <reg orig="cock-|roaches"
       >cockroaches</reg>, <lb/> but this is also the rule with ships doing business <lb/> in the
      summer seas&mdash;at least such as have been long in service. </p>
     <p>Our young captain was a very handsome man, tall and <reg orig="per-|fectly">perfectly</reg>
      <lb/> formed, the very figure to show up a smart uniform's <lb/> finest effects. He was a man
      of the best intentions, and was <lb/> polite and courteous even to courtliness. There was a
      soft <lb/> grace and finish about his manners which made whatever place <lb/> he happened to
      be in seem for the moment a drawing-room. <lb/> He avoided the smoking-room. He had no vices.
      He did not <lb/> smoke or chew tobacco or take snuff; he did not swear, or use <lb/> slang, or
      rude, or coarse, or indelicate language, or make puns, <lb/> or tell anecdotes, or laugh
      intemperately, or raise his voice <lb/> above the moderate pitch enjoined by the canons of
      good form. <lb/> When he gave an order, his manner modified it into a request. <lb/> After
      dinner he and his officers joined the ladies and <reg orig="gentle-|men">gentlemen</reg>
      <lb/> in the ladies' saloon, and shared in the singing and piano <lb/> playing, and helped
      turn the music. He had a sweet and <lb/> sympathetic tenor voice, and used it with taste and
      effect. <lb/> After the music he played whist there, always with the same <lb/> partner and
      opponents, until the ladies' bedtime. The electric <lb/> lights burned there as late as the
      ladies and their friends might <lb/> desire, but they were not allowed to burn in the
      smoking-room <lb/> after eleven. There were many laws on the ship's statute <lb/> book, of
      course; but so far as I could see, this and one other <lb/> were the only ones that were
      rigidly enforced. The captain <lb/> explained that he enforced this one because his own cabin
      <lb/> adjoined the smoking-room, and the smell of tobacco smoke <lb/> made him sick. I did not
      see how our smoke could reach him, <lb/> for the smoking-room and his cabin were on the upper
      deck, <lb/> targets for all the winds that blew; and besides there was no <lb/> crack of
      communication between them, no opening of any sort <lb/>
      <pb n="28" entity="DSSR_000002496_0043"/> in the solid intervening bulkhead. Still, to a delicate
      stomach <lb/> even imaginary smoke can convey damage.</p>
     <p>The captain, with his gentle nature, his polish, his <reg orig="sweet-|ness"
      >sweetness</reg>, <lb/> his moral and verbal purity, seemed pathetically out of <lb/> place in
      his rude and autocratic vocation. It seemed another <lb/> instance of the irony of fate.</p>
     <p>He was going home under a cloud. The passengers knew <lb/> about his trouble, and were sorry
      for him. Approaching <lb/> Vancouver through a narrow and difficult passage densely <lb/>
      befogged with smoke from the forest fires, he had had the <reg orig="ill-|luck">ill-luck</reg>
      <lb/> to lose his bearings and get his ship on the rocks. A <lb/> matter like this would rank
      merely as an error with you and <lb/> me; it ranks as a crime with the directors of steamship
       <reg orig="com-|panies">companies</reg>. <lb/> The captain had been tried by the Admiralty
      Court <lb/> at Vancouver, and its verdict had acquitted him of blame. <lb/> But that was
      insufficient comfort. A sterner court would <reg orig="ex-|amine">examine</reg>
      <lb/> the case in Sydney&mdash;the Court of Directors, the lords <lb/> of a company in
      whose ships the captain had served as mate <lb/> a number of years. This was his first voyage
      as captain.</p>
     <p>The officers of our ship were hearty and companionable <lb/> young men, and they entered
      into the general amusements and <lb/> helped the passengers pass the time. Voyages in the
      Pacific <lb/> and Indian Oceans are but pleasure excursions for all hands. <lb/> Our purser
      was a young Scotchman who was equipped with a <lb/> grit that was remarkable. He was an
      invalid, and looked it, <lb/> as far as his body was concerned, but illness could not subdue
      <lb/> his spirit. He was full of life, and had a gay and capable <lb/> tongue. To all
      appearances he was a sick man without being <lb/> aware of it, for he did not talk about his
      ailments, and his <lb/> bearing and conduct were those of a person in robust health; <lb/> yet
      he was the prey, at intervals, of ghastly sieges of pain in <lb/> his heart. These lasted many
      hours, and while the attack <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg>
      <lb/> he could neither sit nor lie. In one instance he stood <lb/>
      <pb n="29" entity="DSSR_000002496_0044"/> on his feet twenty-four hours fighting for his life with these
      <lb/> sharp agonies, and yet was as full of life and cheer and activity <lb/> the next day as
      if nothing had happened.</p>
     <p>The brightest passenger in the ship, and the most <reg orig="interest-|ing">interesting</reg>
      <lb/> and felicitous talker, was a young Canadian who was not <lb/> able to let the whisky
      bottle alone. He was of a rich and <lb/> powerful family, and could have had a distinguished
      career <lb/> and abundance of effective help toward it if he could have <lb/> conquered his
      appetite for drink; but he could not do it, so his <lb/> great equipment of talent was of no
      use to him. He had often <lb/> taken the pledge to drink no more, and was a good sample of
      <lb/> what that sort of unwisdom can do for a man&mdash;for a man <lb/> with anything
      short of an iron will. The system is wrong in <lb/> two ways: it does not strike at the root
      of the trouble, for one <lb/> thing, and to make a <hi rend="italic">pledge</hi> of any kind
      is to declare war <lb/> against nature; for a pledge is a chain that is always clanking <lb/>
      and reminding the wearer of it that he is not a free man.</p>
     <p>I have said that the system does not strike at the root of <lb/> the trouble, and I venture
      to repeat that. The root is not the <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">drinking</hi>, but the <hi rend="italic">desire</hi> to drink. These are
      very different <lb/> things. The one merely requires will&mdash;and a great deal of it,
      <lb/> both as to bulk and staying capacity&mdash;the other merely <reg orig="re-|quires"
       >requires</reg>
      <lb/> watchfulness&mdash;and for no long time. The desire of <lb/> course precedes the
      act, and should have one's first attention; <lb/> it can do but little good to refuse the act
      over and over again, <lb/> always leaving the desire unmolested, unconquered; the desire <lb/>
      will continue to assert itself, and will be almost sure to win in <lb/> the long run. When the
      desire intrudes, it should be at once <lb/> banished out of the mind. One should be on the
      watch for it <lb/> all the time&mdash;otherwise it will get <hi rend="italic">in</hi>. It
      must be taken in <lb/> time and not allowed to get a lodgment. A desire constantly <lb/>
      repulsed for a fortnight should die, then. That should cure <lb/> the drinking habit. The
      system of refusing the mere <hi rend="italic">act</hi> of <lb/>
      <pb n="30" entity="DSSR_000002496_0045"/> drinking, and leaving the <hi rend="italic">desire</hi> in
      full force, is unintelligent <lb/> war tactics, it seems to me.</p>
     <p>I used to take pledges&mdash;and soon violate them. My will <lb/> was not strong, and I
      could not help it. And then, to be tied <lb/> in any way naturally irks an otherwise free
      person and makes <lb/> him chafe in his bonds and want to get his liberty. But when <lb/> I
      finally ceased from taking definite pledges, and merely <reg orig="re-|solved">resolved</reg>
      <lb/> that I would kill an injurious desire, but leave myself <lb/> free to resume the desire
      and the habit whenever I should <lb/> choose to do so, I had no more trouble. In five days I
      drove <lb/> out the desire to smoke and was not obliged to keep watch <lb/> after that; and I
      never experienced any strong desire to smoke <lb/> again. At the end of a year and a quarter
      of idleness I began <lb/> to write a book, and presently found that the pen was strangely
      <lb/> reluctant to go. I tried a smoke to see if that would help me <lb/> out of the
      difficulty. It did. I smoked eight or ten cigars <lb/> and as many pipes a day for five
      months; finished the book, <lb/> and did not smoke again until a year had gone by and another
      <lb/> book had to be begun.</p>
     <p>I can quit any of my nineteen injurious habits at any time, <lb/> and without discomfort or
      inconvenience. I think that the <lb/> Dr. Tanners and those others who go forty days without
      <lb/> eating do it by resolutely keeping out the desire to eat, in the <lb/> beginning; and
      that after a few hours the desire is <reg orig="dis-|couraged">discouraged</reg>
      <lb/> and comes no more.</p>
     <p>Once I tried my scheme in a large medical way. I had <lb/> been confined to my bed several
      days with lumbago. My case <lb/> refused to improve. Finally the doctor said,&mdash;</p>
     <p>"My remedies have no fair chance. Consider what they <lb/> have to fight, besides the
      lumbago. You smoke extravagantly, <lb/> don't you?"</p>
     <p>"Yes."</p>
     <p>"You take coffee immoderately?"</p>
     <pb n="31" entity="DSSR_000002496_0046"/>
     <p>"Yes."</p>
     <p>"And some tea?"</p>
     <p>"Yes."</p>
     <p>"You eat all kinds of things that are dissatisfied with <lb/> each other's company?"</p>
     <p>"Yes."</p>
     <p>"You drink two hot Scotches every night?"</p>
     <p>"Yes."</p>
     <p>"Very well, there you see what I have to contend <lb/> against. We can't make progress the
      way the matter <lb/> stands. You must make a reduction in these things; you <lb/> must cut
      down your consumption of them considerably for <lb/> some days."</p>
     <p>"I can't, doctor."</p>
     <p>"Why can't you."</p>
     <p>"I lack the will-power. I can cut them off entirely, but I <lb/> can't merely moderate
      them."</p>
     <p>He said that that would answer, and said he would come <lb/> around in twenty-four hours and
      begin work again. He was <lb/> taken ill himself and could not come; but I did not need <lb/>
      him. I cut off all those things for two days and nights; in <lb/> fact, I cut off all kinds of
      food, too, and all drinks except <lb/> water, and at the end of the forty-eight hours the
      lumbago <lb/> was discouraged and left me. I was a well man; so I gave <lb/> thanks and took
      to those delicacies again.</p>
     <p>It seemed a valuable medical course, and I recommended <lb/> it to a lady. She had run down
      and down and down, and <lb/> had at last reached a point where medicines no longer had <lb/>
      any helpful effect upon her. I said I knew I could put her <lb/> upon her feet in a week. It
      brightened her up, it filled her <lb/> with hope, and she said she would do everything I told
      her <lb/> to do. So I said she must stop swearing and drinking, and <lb/> smoking and eating
      for four days, and then she would be all <lb/><pb n="32" entity="DSSR_000002496_0047"/> right
      again. And it would have happened just so, I know <lb/> it; but she said she could not stop
      swearing, and <reg orig="smok-|ing">smoking</reg>, <lb/> and drinking, because she had never
      done those <lb/> things. So there it was. She had neglected her habits, and <lb/> hadn't any.
      Now that they would have come good, there <lb/> were none in stock. She had nothing to fall
      back on. She <lb/> was a sinking vessel, with no freight in her to throw <reg
       orig="over-|board">overboard</reg>
      <lb/> and <lb/> lighten ship <lb/> withal. Why, <lb/> even one or <lb/> two little bad <lb/>
      habits could <lb/> have saved <lb/> her, but she <lb/> was just a <lb/> moral pauper. <lb/>
      When she <lb/> could have <reg orig="ac-|quired">acquired</reg>
      <lb/> them <lb/> she was <reg orig="dis-|suaded">dissuaded</reg>
      <lb/> by her parents, who were ignorant people though <lb/> reared in the best society, and it
      was too late to begin now. <lb/> It seemed such a pity; but there was no help for it. These
      <lb/> things ought to be attended to while a person is young; <lb/> otherwise, when age and
      disease come, there is nothing <reg orig="effect-|ual">effectual</reg>
      <lb/> to fight them with.</p>

      <p>"WHEN I WAS A YOUTH."</p>
     </figure>
     <pb n="33" entity="DSSR_000002496_0048"/>
     <p>When I was a youth I used to take all kinds of pledges, <lb/> and do my best to keep them,
      but I never could, because <lb/> I didn't strike at the root of the habit&mdash;the <hi
       rend="italic">desire;</hi> I generally <lb/> broke down within the month. Once I tried
      limiting a habit. <lb/> That worked tolerably well for a while. I pledged myself to <lb/>
      smoke but one cigar a day. I kept the cigar waiting until <lb/> bedtime, then I had a
      luxurious time with it. But desire <reg orig="per-|secuted">persecuted</reg>
      <lb/> me every day and all day long; so, within the week I <lb/> found myself hunting for
      larger cigars than I had been used <lb/> to smoke; then larger ones still, and still larger
      ones. Within <lb/> the fortnight I was getting cigars <hi rend="italic">made</hi> for
      me&mdash;on a yet <lb/> larger pattern. They still grew and grew in size. Within <lb/>
      the month my cigar had grown to such proportions that I <lb/> could have used it as a crutch.
      It now seemed to me that a <lb/> one-cigar limit was no real protection to a person, so I
      knocked <lb/> my pledge on the head and resumed my liberty.</p>
     <p>To go back to that young Canadian. He was a "<reg orig="remit-|tance">remittance</reg>
      <lb/> man," the first one I had ever seen or heard of. <reg orig="Passen-|gers">Passengers</reg>
      <lb/> explained the term to me. They said that dissipated <reg orig="ne'er-|do-weels"
       >ne'er-do-weels</reg>
      <lb/> belonging to important families in England and Canada <lb/> were not cast off by their
      people while there was any hope of <lb/> reforming them, but when that last hope perished at
      last, the <lb/> ne'er-do-weel was sent abroad to get him out of the way. He <lb/> was shipped
      off with just enough money in his pocket&mdash;no, in <lb/> the purser's
      pocket&mdash;for the needs of the voyage&mdash;and when <lb/> he reached his
      destined port he would find a remittance <reg orig="await-|ing">awaiting</reg>
      <lb/> him there. Not a large one, but just enough to keep him <lb/> a month. A similar
      remittance would come monthly <reg orig="there-|after">thereafter</reg>. <lb/> It was the
      remittance-man's custom to pay his month's <lb/> board and lodging straightway&mdash;a
      duty which his landlord <lb/> did not allow him to forget&mdash;then spree away the rest
      of his <lb/> money in a single night, then brood and mope and grieve in <lb/> idleness till
      the next remittance came. It is a pathetic life.</p>
     <pb n="34" entity="DSSR_000002496_0049"/>
     <p>We had other remittance-men on board, it was said. At <lb/> least <hi rend="italic"
      >they</hi> said they were R. M. 's. There were two. But they <lb/> did not resemble the
      Canadian; they lacked his tidiness, and <lb/> his brains, and his gentlemanly ways, and his
      resolute spirit, <lb/> and his humanities and generosities. One of them was a lad <lb/> of
      nineteen or twenty, and he was a good deal of a ruin, as to <lb/> clothes, and morals, and
      general aspect. He said he was a <lb/> scion of a ducal house in England, and had been shipped
      to <lb/> Canada for the house's relief, that he had fallen into trouble <lb/> there, and was
      now being shipped to Australia. He said he <lb/> had no title. Beyond this remark he was
      economical of the <lb/> truth. The first thing he did in Australia was to get into the <lb/>
      lockup, and the next thing he did was to proclaim himself an <lb/> earl in the police court in
      the morning and fail to prove it.</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">About</hi> four days out from Victoria we plunged into hot <lb/>
      weather, and all the male passengers put on white <lb/> linen clothes. One or two days later
      we crossed the <lb/> 25th parallel of north latitude, and then, by order, the officers <lb/>
      of the ship laid away their blue uniforms and came out in <lb/> white linen ones. All the
      ladies were in white by this time. <lb/> This prevalence of snowy costumes gave the promenade
      deck <lb/> an invitingly cool and cheerful and picnicky aspect.</p>
     <p>From my diary:</p>
     <p>There are several sorts of ills in the world from which a <lb/> person can never escape
      altogether, let him journey as far as <lb/> he will. One escapes from one breed of an ill only
      to <reg orig="en-|counter">encounter</reg>
      <lb/> another breed of it. We have come far from the <lb/> snake liar and the fish liar, and
      there was rest and peace in the <lb/> thought; but now we have reached the realm of the <reg
       orig="boome-|rang">boomerang</reg>
      <lb/> liar, and sorrow is with us once more. The first officer <lb/> has seen a man try to
      escape from his enemy by getting behind <lb/> a tree; but the enemy sent his boomerang sailing
      into the sky <lb/> far above and beyond the tree; then it turned, descended, and <lb/> killed
      the man. The Australian passenger has seen this thing <lb/> done to two men, behind two
      trees&mdash;and by the one arrow. <lb/> This being received with a large silence that
      suggested doubt, <lb/> he buttressed it with the statement that his brother once saw <lb/> the
      boomerang kill a bird away off a hundred yards <hi rend="italic">and bring <lb/> it to the
       thrower</hi>. But these are ills which must be borne. <lb/> There is no other way.</p>
     <pb n="36" entity="DSSR_000002496_0051"/>
     <p>The talk passed from the boomerang to dreams&mdash;usually <lb/> a fruitful subject,
      afloat or ashore&mdash;but this time the output <lb/> was poor. Then it passed to
      instances of extraordinary <lb/> memory&mdash;with better results. Blind Tom, the negro
      pianist, <lb/> was spoken of, and it was said that he could accurately play <lb/> any piece of
      music, howsoever long and difficult, after hearing <lb/> it once; and that six months later he
      could accurately play it <lb/> again, without having touched it in the interval. One of the
      <lb/> most striking of the stories told was furnished by a gentleman <lb/> who had served on
      the staff of the Viceroy of India. He <lb/> read the details from his note-book, and explained
      that he had <lb/> written them down, right after the consummation of the <reg
       orig="inci-|dent">incident</reg>
      <lb/> which they described, because he thought that if he did <lb/> not put them down in black
      and white he might presently <lb/> come to think he had dreamed them or invented them.</p>
     <p>The Viceroy was making a progress, and among the shows <lb/> offered by the Maharajah of
      Mysore for his entertainment was <lb/> a memory-exhibition. The Viceroy and thirty gentlemen
      of <lb/> his suite sat in a row, and the memory-expert, a high-caste <lb/> Brahmin, was
      brought in and seated on the floor in front of <lb/> them. He said he knew but two languages,
      the English and <lb/> his own, but would not exclude any foreign tongue from the <lb/> tests
      to be applied to his memory. Then he laid before the <lb/> assemblage his program&mdash;a
      sufficiently extraordinary one. <lb/> He proposed that one gentleman should give him one word
      of <lb/> a foreign sentence, and tell him its place in the sentence. He <lb/> was furnished
      with the French word <hi rend="italic">est,</hi> and was told it was <lb/> second in a
      sentence of three words. The next gentleman <lb/> gave him the German word <hi rend="italic"
       >verloren</hi> and said it was the third <lb/> in a sentence of four words. He asked the next
      gentleman <lb/> for one detail in a sum in addition; another for one detail in a <lb/> sum of
      subtraction; others for single details in mathematical <lb/> problems of various kinds; he got
      them. Intermediates gave <lb/>
      <pb n="37" entity="DSSR_000002496_0052"/> him single words from sentences in Greek, Latin,
      Spanish, <lb/> Portuguese, Italian, and other languages, and told him their <lb/> places in
      the sentences. When at last every body had furnished <lb/> him a single rag from a foreign
      sentence or a figure <lb/> from a problem, he went over the ground again, and got a <lb/>
      second word and a second figure and was told their places in <lb/> the sentences and the sums;
      and so on and so on. He went <lb/> over the ground again and again until he had collected all
      the <lb/> parts of the sums and all the parts of the sentences&mdash;and all <lb/> in
      disorder, of course, not in their proper rotation. This had <lb/> occupied two hours.</p>
     <p>The Brahmin now sat silent and thinking, a while, then <lb/> began and repeated all the
      sentences, placing the words in <lb/> their proper order, and untangled the disordered
      arithmetical <lb/> problems and gave accurate answers to them all.</p>
     <p>In the beginning he had asked the company to throw <lb/> almonds at him during the two
      hours, he to remember how <lb/> many each gentleman had thrown; but none were thrown, for
      <lb/> the Viceroy said that the test would be a sufficiently severe <lb/> strain without
      adding that burden to it.</p>
     <p>General Grant had a fine memory for all kinds of things, <lb/> including even names and
      faces, and I could have furnished <lb/> an instance of it if I had thought of it. The first
      time I <lb/> ever saw him was early in his first term as President. I had <lb/> just arrived
      in Washington from the Pacific coast, a stranger <lb/> and wholly unknown to the public, and
      was passing the White <lb/> House one morning when I met a friend, a Senator from <lb/>
      Nevada. He asked me if I would like to see the President. <lb/> I said I should be very glad;
      so we entered. I supposed that the <lb/> President would be in the midst of a crowd, and that
      I could <lb/> look at him in peace and security from a distance, as another <lb/> stray cat
      might look at another king. But it was in the <lb/> morning, and the Senator was using a
      privilege of his office <lb/>
      <pb n="38" entity="DSSR_000002496_0053"/> Which I had not heard of&mdash;the privilege of
      intruding upon <lb/> the Chief Magistrate's working hours. Before I knew it, the <lb/> Senator
      and I were in the presence, and there was none there <lb/> but we three. General Grant got
      slowly up from his table, <lb/> put his pen down, and stood before me with the iron expression
      <lb/> of a man who had not smiled for seven years, and was not <lb/> intending to smile for
      another seven. He looked me steadily <lb/> in the eyes&mdash;mine lost confidence and
      fell. I had never <reg orig="con-|fronted">confronted</reg>
      <lb/> a great man before, and was in a miserable state of <lb/> funk and inefficiency. The
      Senator said:&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Mr. President, may I have the privilege of introducing <lb/> Mr. Clemens?"</p>
     <p>The President gave my hand an unsympathetic wag and <lb/> dropped it. He did not say a word
      but just stood. In my <lb/> trouble I could not think of anything to say, I merely wanted
      <lb/> to resign. There was an awkward pause, a dreary pause, a <lb/> horrible pause. Then I
      thought of something, and looked up <lb/> into that unyielding face, and said
      timidly:&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Mr. President, I&mdash;I am embarrassed. Are you?"</p>
     <p>His face broke&mdash;just a little&mdash;a wee glimmer, the <lb/> momentary
      flicker of a summer-lightning smile, seven years <lb/> ahead of time&mdash;and I was out
      and gone as soon as <hi rend="italic">it</hi> was.</p>
     <p>Ten years passed away before I saw him the second time. <lb/> Meantime I was become better
      known; and was one of the <lb/> people appointed to respond to toasts at the banquet given
      <lb/> to General Grant in Chicago by the Army of the Tennessee <lb/> when he came back from
      his tour around the world. I arrived <lb/> late at night and got up late in the morning. All
      the <reg orig="corri-|dors">corridors</reg>
      <lb/> of the hotel were crowded with people waiting to get <lb/> a glimpse of General Grant
      when he should pass to the place <lb/> whence he was to review the great procession. I worked
      my <lb/> way by the suite of packed drawing-rooms, and at the corner <lb/> of the house I
      found a window open where there was a roomy <lb/>
      <pb entity="DSSR_000002496_0054"/>
      <figure id="f10" rend="page" entity="DSSR_000002496_0054">
       <p>AN AWKWARD PAUSE.</p>
      </figure>
      <pb entity="DSSR_000002496_0055"/>
      <pb n="41" entity="DSSR_000002496_0056"/> platform decorated with flags, and carpeted. I
      stepped out on <lb/> it, and saw below me millions of people blocking all the streets, <lb/>
      and other millions caked together in all the windows and on <lb/> all the house-tops around.
      These masses took me for General <lb/> Grant, and broke into volcanic explosions and cheers;
      but <lb/> it was a good place to see the procession, and I stayed. <lb/> Presently I heard the
      distant blare of military music, and far <lb/> up the street I saw the procession come in
      sight, cleaving its <lb/> way through the huzzaing multitudes, with Sheridan, the most <lb/>
      martial figure of the War, riding at its head in the dress <lb/> uniform of a
      Lieutenant-General.</p>
     <p>And now General Grant, arm-in-arm with Major Carter <lb/> Harrison, stepped out on the
      platform, followed two and two <lb/> by the badged and uniformed reception committee. General
      <lb/> Grant was looking exactly as he had looked upon that trying <lb/> occasion of ten years
      before&mdash;all iron and bronze self-<reg orig="posses-|sion">possession</reg>. <lb/>
      Mr. Harrison came over and led me to the General and <lb/> formally introduced me. Before I
      could put together the <lb/> proper remark, General Grant said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Mr. Clemens, I am not embarrassed. Are you?"&mdash;and <lb/> that little seven-year
      smile twinkled across his face again.</p>
     <p>Seventeen years have gone by since then, and to-day, in <lb/> New York, the streets are a
      crush of people who are there to <lb/> honor the remains of the great soldier as they pass to
      their <lb/> final resting-place under the monument; and the air is heavy <lb/> with dirges and
      the boom of artillery, and all the millions of <lb/> America are thinking of the man who
      restored the Union and <lb/> the flag, and gave to democratic government a new lease of <lb/>
      life, and, as we may hope and do believe, a permanent place <lb/> among the beneficent
      institutions of men.</p>
     <p>We had one game in the ship which was a good <reg orig="time-|passer&mdash;at"
       >timepasser&mdash;at</reg>
      <lb/> least it was at night in the smoking-room when <lb/> the men were getting freshened up
      from the day's monotonies <lb/>
      <pb n="42" entity="DSSR_000002496_0057"/> and dullnesses. It was the completing of
      non-complete stories. <lb/> That is to say, a man would tell all of a story except the <lb/>
      finish, then the others would try to supply the ending out <lb/> of their own invention. When
      every one who wanted a <lb/> chance had had it, the man who had introduced the story <lb/>
      would give it its original ending&mdash;then you could take your <lb/> choice. Sometimes
      the new endings turned out to be better <lb/> than the old one. But the story which called out
      the most <lb/> persistent and determined and ambitious effort was one which <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">had</hi> no ending, and so there was nothing to compare the <reg
       orig="new-|made">new-made</reg>
      <lb/> endings with. The man who told it said he could <lb/> furnish the particulars up to a
      certain point only, because that <lb/> was as much of the tale as he knew. He had read it in a
      <lb/> volume of sketches twenty-five years ago, and was interrupted <lb/> before the end was
      reached. He would give any one fifty <lb/> dollars who would finish the story to the
      satisfaction of a jury <lb/> to be appointed by ourselves. We appointed a jury and <lb/>
      wrestled with the tale. We invented plenty of endings, but <lb/> the jury voted them all down.
      The jury was right. It was a <lb/> tale which the author of it may possibly have completed
       <reg orig="satis-|factorily">satisfactorily</reg>, <lb/> and if he really had that good
      fortune I would like <lb/> to know what the ending was. Any ordinary man will find <lb/> that
      the story's strength is in its middle, and that there is <lb/> apparently no way to transfer
      it to the close, where of course <lb/> it ought to be. In substance the storiette was as
      follows: </p>
     <p>John Brown, aged thirty-one, good, gentle, bashful, timid, lived in a quiet <lb/> village in
      Missouri. He was superintendent of the Presbyterian <reg orig="Sunday-|school"
      >Sunday-school</reg>. <lb/> It was but a humble distinction; still, it was his only official
      one, <lb/> and he was modestly proud of it and was devoted to its work and its interests.
      <lb/> The extreme kindliness of his nature was recognized by all; in fact, people <lb/> said
      that he was made entirely out of good impulses and bashfulness; that he <lb/> could always be
      counted upon for help when it was needed, and for <reg orig="bashful-|ness">bashfulness</reg>
      <lb/> both when it was needed and when it wasn't.</p>
     <p>Mary Taylor, twenty-three, modest, sweet, winning, and in character and <lb/> person
      beautiful, was all in all to him. And he was very nearly all in all to <lb/> her. She was
      wavering, his hopes were high. Her mother had been in <lb/>
      <pb n="43" entity="DSSR_000002496_0058"/> opposition from the first. But she was wavering,
      too; he could see it. She <lb/> was being touched by his warm interest in her two
      charity-proteges and by <lb/> his contributions toward their support. These were two forlorn
      and aged <lb/> sisters who lived in a log hut in a lonely place up a cross road four miles
      from <lb/> Mrs Taylor's farm. One of the sisters was crazy, and sometimes a little <lb/>
      violent, but not often.</p>
     <p>At last the time seemed ripe for a final advance, and Brown gathered his <lb/> courage
      together and resolved to make it. He would take along a <reg orig="contribu-|tion"
       >contribution</reg>
      <lb/> of double the usual size, and win the mother over; with her opposition <lb/> annulled,
      the rest of the conquest would be sure and prompt.</p>
     <p>He took to the road in the middle of a placid Sunday afternoon in the soft <lb/> Missourian
      summer, and he was equipped properly for his mission. He was <lb/> clothed all in white linen,
      with a blue ribbon for a necktie, and he had on <lb/> dressy tight boots. His horse and buggy
      were the finest that the livery stable <lb/> could furnish. The lap robe was of white linen,
      it was new, and it had a <lb/> hand-worked border that could not be rivaled in that region for
      beauty and <lb/> elaboration.</p>
     <p>When he was four miles out on the lonely road and was walking his horse <lb/> over a wooden
      bridge, his straw hat blew off and fell in the creek, and floated <lb/> down and lodged
      against a bar. He did not quite know what to do. He <lb/> must have the hat, that was
      manifest; but how was he to get it?</p>
     <p>Then he had an idea. The roads were empty, nobody was stirring. Yes, <lb/> he would risk it.
      He led the horse to the roadside and set it to cropping the <lb/> grass; then he undressed and
      put his clothes in the buggy, petted the horse <lb/> a moment to secure its compassion and
      <lb/> its loyalty, then hurried to the stream. <lb/> He swam out and soon had the hat. <lb/>
      When he got to the top of the bank the <lb/> horse was gone!</p>
     <figure id="f11" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002496_0058">
      <p>THE CLIMAX.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>His legs almost gave way under him. <lb/> The horse was walking leisurely along <lb/> the
      road. Brown trotted after it, <reg orig="say-|ing">saying</reg>, <lb/> 'Whoa, whoa, there's a
      good <reg orig="fel-|low">fellow</reg>;" <lb/> but whenever he got near enough <lb/> to chance
      a jump for the buggy, the horse <lb/> quickened its pace a little and defeated <lb/> him. And
      so this went on, the naked <lb/> man perishing with anxiety, and <reg orig="expect-|ing"
       >expecting</reg>
      <lb/> every moment to see people come in <lb/> sight. He tagged on and on, imploring <lb/> the
      horse, beseeching the horse, till he <lb/> had left a mile behind him, and was <reg
       orig="clos-|ing">closing</reg>
      <lb/> up on the Taylor premises; then at <lb/> last he was successful, and got into the <lb/>
      buggy. He flung on his shirt, his <reg orig="neck-|tie">necktie</reg>, <lb/> and his coat;
      then reached for&mdash;but he was too late; he sat suddenly <lb/> down and pulled up the
      lap-robe, for he saw some one coming out of the <lb/>
      <pb n="44" entity="DSSR_000002496_0059"/> gate&mdash;a woman, he thought. He wheeled the
      horse to the left, and struck <lb/> briskly up the cross-road. It was perfectly straight, and
      exposed on both <lb/> sides; but there were woods and a sharp turn three miles ahead, and he
      was <lb/> very grateful when he got there. As he passed around the turn he slowed <lb/> down
      to a walk, and reached for his tr&mdash;too late again.</p>
     <p>He had come upon Mrs. Enderby, Mrs. Glossop, Mrs. Taylor, and Mary. <lb/> They were on foot,
      and seemed tired and excited. They came at once to the <lb/> buggy and shook hands, and all
      spoke at once, and said eagerly and earnestly, <lb/> how glad they were that he was come, and
      how fortunate it was. And Mrs. <lb/> Enderby said, impressively:</p>
     <p>"It <hi rend="italic">looks</hi> like an accident, his coming at such a time; but let no one
       <reg orig="pro-|fane">profane</reg>
      <lb/> it with such a name; he was sent&mdash;sent from on high."</p>
     <p>They were all moved, and Mrs. Glossop said in an awed voice:</p>
     <p>"Sarah Enderby, you never said a truer word in your life. This is no <reg orig="ac-|cident"
       >accident</reg>, <lb/> it is a special Providence. He <hi rend="italic">was</hi> sent. He is
      an angel&mdash;an angel <lb/> as truly as ever angel was&mdash;an angel of
      deliverance. I say <hi rend="italic">angel</hi>, Sarah <reg orig="En-|derby">Enderby</reg>,
      <lb/> and will have no other word. Don't let any one ever say to me again, <lb/> that there's
      no such thing as special Providences; for if this isn't one, let <lb/> them account for it
      that can."</p>
     <p>"I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> it's so," said Mrs. Taylor, fervently. "John Brown, I could
      <lb/> worship you; I could go down on my knees to you. Didn't something tell <lb/>
      you?&mdash;didn't you <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> that you were sent? I could kiss the
      hem of your <reg orig="lap-|robe">lap-robe</reg>."</p>
     <p>He was not able to speak; he was helpless with shame and fright. Mrs. <lb/> Taylor went on:</p>
     <p>"Why, just look at it all around, Julia Glossop. <hi rend="italic">Any</hi> person can see
      <lb/> the hand of Providence in it. Here at noon what do we see? We see the <lb/> smoke
      rising. I speak up and say, 'That's the Old People's cabin afire.' <lb/> Didn't I, Julia
      Glossop?"</p>
     <p>"The very words you said, Nancy Taylor. I was as close to you as I am <lb/> now, and I heard
      them. You may have said hut instead of cabin, but in <lb/> substance it's the same. And you
      were looking pale, too."</p>
     <p>"Pale? I was that pale that if&mdash;why, you just compare it with this <reg
       orig="lap-|robe">lap-robe</reg>. <lb/> Then the next thing I said was, 'Mary Taylor, tell the
      hired man to rig up <lb/> the team&mdash;we'll go to the rescue.' And she said, 'Mother,
      don't you know <lb/> you told him he could drive to see his people, and stay over Sunday?' And
      <lb/> it was just so. I declare for it, I had forgotten it. 'Then,' said I, 'we'll go <lb/>
      afoot.' And go we did. And found Sarah Enderby on the road."</p>
     <p>"And we all went together," said Mrs. Enderby. "And found the cabin <lb/> set fire to and
      burnt down by the crazy one, and the poor old things so old and <lb/> feeble that they
      couldn't go afoot. And we got them to a shady place and <lb/> made them as comfortable as we
      could, and began to wonder which way <lb/> to turn to find some way to get them conveyed to
      Nancy Taylor's house. <lb/> And I spoke up and said&mdash;now what did I say? Didn't I
      say, 'Providence <lb/> will provide'?"</p>
     <p>"Why sure as you live, so you did! I had forgotten it."</p>
     <p>"So had I," said Mrs. Glossop and Mrs. Taylor; "but you certainly <hi rend="italic">said</hi>
      <lb/> it. Now wasn't that remarkable?"</p>
     <pb n="45" entity="DSSR_000002496_0060"/>
     <p>"Yes, I said it. And then we went to Mr. Moseley's, two miles, and all <lb/> of them were
      gone to the camp meeting over on Stony Fork; and then we <lb/> came all the way back, two
      miles, and then here, another mile&mdash;and <reg orig="Provi-|dence">Providence</reg>
      <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">has</hi> provided. You see it yourselves."</p>
     <p>They gazed at each other awe-struck, and lifted their hands and said in <lb/> unison:</p>
     <p>"It's per-fectly wonderful."</p>
     <p>"And then," said Mrs. Glossop, "What do you think we had better do&mdash; <lb/> let Mr.
      Brown drive the Old People to Nancy Taylor's one at a time, or put <lb/> both of them in the
      buggy, and him lead the horse?"</p>
     <p>Brown gasped.</p>
     <p>"Now, then, that's a question," said Mrs. Enderby. "You see, we are <lb/> all tired out, and
      any way we fix it it's going to be difficult. For if Mr. <lb/> Brown takes both of them, at
      least one of us must go back to help him, for <lb/> he can't load them into the buggy by
      himself, and they so helpless."</p>
     <p>"That is so," said Mrs. Taylor. "It doesn't look&mdash;oh, how would this <lb/>
      do?&mdash;one of us drive there <hi rend="italic">with</hi> Mr. Brown, and the rest of
      you go along to <lb/> my house and get things ready. I'll go with him. He and I together can
      <lb/> lift one of the Old People into the buggy; then drive her to my house and&mdash;</p>
     <p>"But who will take care of the other one?" said Mrs. Enderby. "We <lb/> musn't leave her
      there in the woods alone, you know&mdash;especially the crazy <lb/> one. There and back
      is eight miles, you see."</p>
     <p>They had all been sitting on the grass beside the buggy for a while, now, <lb/> trying to
      rest their weary bodies. They fell silent a moment or two, and <lb/> struggled in thought over
      the baffling situation; then Mrs. Enderby <reg orig="bright-|ened">brightened</reg>
      <lb/> and said:</p>
     <p>"I think I've got the idea, now. You see, we can't <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> any more.
      <lb/> Think what we've done: four miles there, two to Moseley's, is six, then back <lb/> to
      here&mdash;nine miles since noon, and not a bite to eat; I declare I don't see <lb/> how
      we've done it; and as for me, I am just famishing. Now, somebody's <lb/> got to go back, to
      help Mr. Brown&mdash;there's no getting around that; but <lb/> whoever goes has got to
      ride, not walk. So my idea is this: one of us to ride <lb/> back with Mr. Brown, then ride to
      Nancy Taylor's house with one of the Old <lb/> People, leaving Mr. Brown to keep the other old
      one company, you all to go <lb/> now to Nancy's and rest and wait; then one of you drive back
      and get the <lb/> other one and drive <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to Nancy's, and Mr. Brown
      walk."</p>
     <p>"Splendid!" they all cried. "Oh, that will do&mdash;that will answer <reg
       orig="per-|fectly">perfectly</reg>." <lb/> And they all said that Mrs. Enderby had the best
      head for planning, <lb/> in the company; and they said that they wondered that they hadn't
      thought <lb/> of this simple plan themselves. They hadn't meant to take back the <reg
       orig="compli-|ment">compliment</reg>, <lb/> good simple souls, and didn't know they had done
      it. After a <reg orig="consulta-|tion">consultation</reg>
      <lb/> it was decided that Mrs. Enderby should drive back with Brown, she <lb/> being entitled
      to the distinction because she had invented the plan. <reg orig="Every-|thing">Everything</reg>
      <lb/> now being satisfactorily arranged and settled, the ladies rose, relieved <lb/> and
      happy, and brushed down their gowns, and three of them started <reg orig="home-|ward"
      >homeward</reg>; <lb/> Mrs. Enderby set her foot on the buggy-step and was about to climb
      <lb/> in, when Brown found a remnant of his voice and gasped out&mdash;</p>
     <pb n="46" entity="DSSR_000002496_0061"/>
     <p>"Please Mrs. Enderby, call them back&mdash;I am very weak; I can't walk, <lb/> I can't,
      indeed."</p>
     <p>"Why, dear Mr. Brown! You <hi rend="italic">do</hi> look pale; I am ashamed of myself <lb/>
      that I didn't notice it sooner. Come back&mdash;all of you! Mr. Brown is not <lb/> well.
      Is there anything I can do for you, Mr. Brown?&mdash;I'm real sorry. <lb/> Are you in
      pain?"</p>
     <p>"No, madam, only weak; I am not sick, but only just weak&mdash;lately; <lb/> not long,
      but just lately."</p>
     <p>The others came back, and poured out their sympathies and <reg orig="commisera-|tions"
       >commiserations</reg>, <lb/> and were full of self-reproaches for not having noticed how pale
      he was. <lb/> And they at once struck out a new plan, and soon agreed that it was by far <lb/>
      the best of all. They would all go to Nancy Taylor's house and see to <lb/> Brown's needs
      first. He could lie on the sofa in the parlor, and while Mrs. <lb/> Taylor and Mary took care
      of him the other two ladies would take the buggy <lb/> and go and get one of the Old People,
      and leave one of themselves with the <lb/> other one, and&mdash;</p>
     <p>By this time, without any solicitation, they were at the horse's head and <lb/> were
      beginning to turn him around. The danger was imminent, but Brown <lb/> found his voice again
      and saved himself. He said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"But ladies, you are overlooking something which makes the plan <reg orig="im-|practicable"
       >impracticable</reg>. <lb/> You see, if you bring <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of them home,
      and one remains <lb/> behind with the other, there will be three persons there when one of you
      <lb/> comes back for that other, for some one must drive the buggy back, and <hi rend="italic"
       >three </hi>
      <lb/> can't come home in it."</p>
     <p>They all exclaimed, "Why, sure-ly, that is so!" and they were all <reg orig="per-|plexed"
       >perplexed</reg>
      <lb/> again.</p>
     <p>"Dear, dear, what <hi rend="italic">can</hi> we do?" said Mrs. Glossop; "it is the most
      <lb/> mixed-up thing that ever was. The fox and the goose and the corn and <lb/>
      things&mdash;oh, dear, they are nothing to it."</p>
     <p>They sat wearily down once more, to further torture their tormented heads <lb/> for a plan
      that would work. Presently Mary offered a plan; it was her first <lb/> effort. She said:</p>
     <p>"I am young and strong, and am refreshed, now. Take Mr. Brown to <lb/> our house, and give
      him help&mdash;you see how plainly he needs it. I will go <lb/> back and take care of the
      Old People; I can be there in twenty minutes. <lb/> You can go on and do what you first
      started to do&mdash;wait on the main road at <lb/> our house until somebody comes along
      with a wagon; then send and bring <lb/> away the three of us. Yo&uring; won't have to
      wait long; the farmers will soon <lb/> be coming back from town, now. I will keep old Polly
      patient and cheered <lb/> up&mdash;the crazy one doesn't need it."</p>
     <p>This plan was discussed and accepted; it seemed the best that could be <lb/> done, in the
      circumstances, and the Old People must be getting discouraged <lb/> by this time.</p>
     <p>Brown felt relieved, and was deeply thankful. Let him once get to the <lb/> main road and he
      would find a way to escape.</p>
     <p>Then Mrs. Taylor said:</p>
     <p>"The evening chill will be coming on, pretty soon, and those poor old <lb/>
      <pb n="47" entity="DSSR_000002496_0062"/> burnt-out things will need some kind of covering.
      Take the lap-robe with you, <lb/> dear."</p>
     <p>"Very well, Mother, I will".</p>
     <p>She stepped to the buggy and put out her hand to take it&mdash;</p>
     <p>That was the end of the tale. The passenger who told it said that when <lb/> he read the
      story twenty-five years ago in a train he was interrupted at that <lb/> point&mdash;the
      train jumped off a bridge.</p>
     <p>At first we thought we could finish the story quite easily, and we set to <lb/> work with
      confidence; but it soon began to appear that it was not a simple <lb/> thing, but difficult
      and baffling. This was on <reg orig="ac-|count">account</reg>
      <lb/> of Brown's character&mdash;great generosity and <lb/> kindliness, but complicated
      with unusual shyness <lb/> and diffidence, particularly in the presence of ladies. <lb/> There
      was his love for Mary, in a hopeful state but <lb/> not yet secure&mdash;just in a
      condition, indeed, <lb/> where its affair must be handled with great <lb/> tact, and no
      mistakes made, no offense <lb/> given. And there was the mother&mdash; <lb/> wavering,
      half willing&mdash;by adroit and <lb/> flawless diplomacy to be won over, <lb/> now, or
      perhaps never at all. Also, <lb/> there were the helpless Old People <lb/> yonder in the woods
      waiting&mdash;their <lb/> fate and Brown's happiness to be <reg orig="de-|termined"
       >determined</reg>
      <lb/> by what Brown should do <lb/> within the next two seconds. Mary <lb/> was reaching for
      the lap-robe; Brown <lb/> must decide&mdash;there was no time to <lb/> be lost.</p>
     <figure id="f12" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002496_0062">
      <p>"WE WORKED UNTIL THREE."</p>
     </figure>
     <p>Of course none but a happy <reg orig="end-|ing">ending</reg>
      <lb/> of the story would be accepted by <lb/> the jury; the finish must find Brown in high
      credit with the ladies, his <lb/> behavior without blemish, his modesty unwounded, his
      character for <reg orig="self-|sacrifice">self-sacrifice</reg>
      <lb/> maintained, the Old People rescued through him, their benefactor, <lb/> all the party
      proud of him, happy in him, his praises on all their tongues.</p>
     <p>We tried to arrange this, but it was beset with persistent and irreconcilable <lb/>
      difficulties. We saw that Brown's shyness would not allow him to give up <lb/> the lap-robe.
      This would offend Mary and her mother; and it would surprise <lb/> the other ladies, partly
      because this stinginess toward the suffering Old People <lb/> would be out of character with
      Brown, and partly because he was a special <lb/> Providence and could not properly act so. If
      asked to explain his conduct, <lb/> his shyness would not allow him to tell the truth, and
      lack of invention and <lb/> practice would find him incapable of contriving a lie that would
      wash. We <lb/> worked at the troublesome problem until three in the morning.</p>
     <p>Meantime Mary was still reaching for the lap-robe. We gave it up, and <lb/> decided to let
      her continue to reach. It is the reader's privilege to determine <lb/> for himself how the
      thing came out.</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">On</hi> the seventh day out we saw a dim vast bulk standing <lb/> up
      out of the wastes of the Pacific and knew that <lb/> that spectral promontory was Diamond
      Head, a piece <lb/> of this world which I had not seen before for twenty-nine <lb/> years. So
      we were nearing Honolulu, the capital city of the <lb/> Sandwich Islands&mdash;those
      islands which to me were Paradise; <lb/> a Paradise which I had been longing all those years
      to see <lb/> again. Not any other thing in the world could have stirred <lb/> me as the sight
      of that great rock did.</p>
     <p>In the night we anchored a mile from shore. Through <lb/> my port I could see the twinkling
      lights of Honolulu and the <lb/> dark bulk of the mountain-range that stretched away right
      <lb/> and left. I could not make out the beautiful Nuuana valley, <lb/> but I knew where it
      lay, and remembered how it used to look <lb/> in the old times. We used to ride up it on
      horseback in those <lb/> days&mdash;we young people&mdash;and branch off and gather
      bones in <lb/> a sandy region where one of the first Kamehameha's battles <lb/> was fought. He
      was a remarkable man, for a king; and he <lb/> was also a remarkable man for a savage. He was
      a mere <lb/> kinglet and of little or no consequence at the time of Captain <lb/> Cook's

      <p>course of ten years he whipped out all the other kings and <lb/> made himself master of
       every one of the nine or ten islands <lb/> that form the group. But he did more than that. He
       bought <lb/> ships, freighted them with sandal wood and other native <reg orig="pro-|ducts"
        >products</reg>, <lb/> and sent them as far as South America and China; he <lb/> sold to his
       savages the foreign stuffs and tools and utensils <lb/> which came back in these ships, and
       started the march of <lb/> civilization. It is doubtful if the match to this extraordinary
       <lb/> thing is to be found in the history of any other savage. <lb/> Savages are eager to
       learn from the white man any new way <lb/> to kill each other, but it is not their habit to
       seize with avidity <lb/> and apply with energy the larger and nobler ideas which he <lb/>
       offers them. The details of Kamehameha's history show that <lb/> he was always hospitably
       ready to examine the white man's <lb/> ideas, and that he exercised a tidy discrimination in
       making <lb/> his selections from the samples placed on view.</p>
      <p>A shrewder discrimination than was exhibited by his son <lb/> and successor, Liholiho, I
       think. Liholiho could have qualified <lb/> as a reformer, perhaps, but as a king he was a
       mistake. A <lb/> mistake because he tried to be both king <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
       reformer. This <lb/> is mixing fire and gunpowder together. A king has no proper <lb/>
       business with reforming. His best policy is to keep things as <lb/> they are; and if he can't
       do that, he ought to try to make <lb/> them worse than they are. This is not guesswork; I
       have <lb/> thought over this matter a good deal, so that if I should ever <lb/> have a chance
       to become a king I would know how to conduct <lb/> the business in the best way.</p>
      <p>When Liholiho succeeded his father he found himself <reg orig="pos-|sessed">possessed</reg>
       <lb/> of an equipment of royal tools and safeguards which a <lb/> wiser king would have known
       how to husband, and judiciously <lb/> employ, and make profitable. The entire country was
       under <lb/> the one scepter, and his was that scepter. There was an <lb/> Established Church,
       and he was the head of it. There was a <lb/>
       <pb n="52" entity="DSSR_000002496_0067"/> Standing Army, and he was the head of that; an Army
       of <lb/> 114 privates under command of 27 Generals and a Field <reg orig="Mar-|shal"
       >Marshal</reg>. <lb/> There was a proud and ancient Hereditary Nobility. <lb/> There was
       still one other asset. This was the <hi rend="italic">tabu</hi>&mdash;an agent <lb/>
       endowed with a mysterious and stupendous power, an agent <lb/> not found among the properties
       of any European monarch, a <lb/> tool of inestimable value in the business. Liholiho was <reg
        orig="head-|master">headmaster</reg>
       <lb/> of the tabu. The tabu was the most ingenious and <lb/> effective of all the inventions
       that has ever been devised for <lb/> keeping a people's privileges satisfactorily restricted.</p>
      <p>It required the sexes to live in separate houses. It did not <lb/> allow people to eat in
       either house; they must eat in another <lb/> place. It did not allow a man's woman-folk to
       enter his <lb/> house. It did not allow the sexes to eat together; the men <lb/> must eat
       first, and the women must wait on them. Then the <lb/> women could eat what was
       left&mdash;if anything was left&mdash;and <lb/> wait on themselves. I mean, if
       anything of a coarse or <reg orig="un-|palatable">unpalatable</reg>
       <lb/> sort was left, the women could have it. But not the <lb/> good things, the fine things,
       the choice things, such as pork, <lb/> poultry, bananas, cocoanuts, the choicer varieties of
       fish, and <lb/> so on. By the tabu, all these were sacred to the men; the <lb/> women spent
       their lives longing for them and wondering what <lb/> they might taste like; and they died
       without finding out.</p>
      <p>These rules, as you see, were quite simple and clear. It <lb/> was easy to remember them;
       and useful. For the penalty for <lb/> infringing any rule in the whole list was <hi
        rend="italic">death</hi>. Those women <lb/> easily learned to put up with shark and taro and
       dog for a diet <lb/> when the other things were so expensive.</p>
      <p>It was death for any one to walk upon tabu'd ground; or <lb/> defile a tabu'd thing with
       his touch; or fail in due servility to <lb/> a chief; or step upon the king's shadow. The
       nobles and the <lb/> King and the priests were always suspending little rags here <lb/> and
       there and yonder, to give notice to the people that the <lb/>
       <pb n="53" entity="DSSR_000002496_0068"/> decorated spot or thing was tabu, and death lurking
       near. <lb/> The struggle for life was difficult and chancy in the islands in <lb/> those
       days.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Thus advantageously <lb/> was the new king situated. <lb/> Will it be believed that the
       <lb/> first thing he did was to <lb/> destroy his Established <lb/> Church, root and branch?
       <lb/> He did indeed do that. To <lb/> state the case figuratively, <lb/> he was a prosperous
       sailor <lb/> who burnt his ship and took <lb/> to a raft. This Church was <lb/> a horrid
       thing. It heavily <lb/> oppressed the people; it <lb/> kept them always trembling <lb/> in
       the gloom of mysterious threatenings; it slaughtered them <lb/> in sacrifice before its
       grotesque idols of wood and stone; it <lb/> cowed them, it terrorized them, it made them
       slaves to its <lb/> priests, and through the priests to the king. It was the best <lb/>
       friend a king could have, and the most dependable. To a <lb/> professional reformer who
       should annihilate so frightful and <lb/> so devastating a power as this Church, reverence and
       praise <lb/> would be due; but to a king who should do it, could properly <lb/> be due
       nothing but reproach; reproach softened by sorrow; <lb/> sorrow for his unfitness for his
       position.</p>
      <p>He destroyed his Established Church, and his kingdom is a <lb/> republic to-day, in
       consequence of that act.</p>
      <p>When he destroyed the Church and burned the idols he did <lb/> a mighty thing for
       civilization and for his people's weal&mdash;but <lb/> it was not "business." It was
       unkingly, it was inartistic. It <lb/> made trouble for his line. The American missionaries
       arrived <lb/>
       <pb n="54" entity="DSSR_000002496_0069"/> while the burned idols were still smoking. They
       found the <lb/> nation without a religion, and they repaired the defect. They <lb/> offered
       their own religion and it was gladly received. But it <lb/> was no support to arbitrary
       kingship, and so the kingly power <lb/> began to weaken from that day. Forty-seven years
       later, <lb/> when I was in the islands, Kamehameha V. was trying to <lb/> repair Liholiho's
       blunder, and not succeeding. He had set up <lb/> an Established Church and made himself the
       head of it. But <lb/> it was only a pinchbeck thing, an imitation, a bauble, an empty <lb/>
       show. It had no power, no value for a king. It could not <lb/> harry or burn or slay, it in
       no way resembled the admirable <lb/> machine which Liholiho destroyed. It was an Established
       <lb/> Church without an Establishment; all the people were <reg orig="Dis-|senters"
        >Dissenters</reg>.</p>
      <p>Long before that, the kingship had itself become but a <lb/> name, a show. At an early day
       the missionaries had turned it <lb/> into something very much like a republic; and here
       lately the <lb/> business whites have turned it into something exactly like it.</p>
      <p>In Captain Cook's time (1778), the native population of the <lb/> islands
       was estimated at 400,000; in 1836 at something short of <lb/> 200,000, in 1866 at 50,000; it
       is to-day, per census, 25,000. All <lb/> intelligent people praise Kamehameha I. and Liholiho
       for <reg orig="con-|ferring">conferring</reg>
       <lb/> upon their people the great boon of civilization. I <lb/> would do it myself, but my
       intelligence is out of repair, now, <lb/> from over-work.</p>
      <p>When I was in the islands nearly a generation ago, I was <lb/> acquainted with a young
       American couple who had among <lb/> their belongings an attractive little son of the age of
       seven&mdash; <lb/> attractive but not practicably companionable with me, because <lb/>
       he knew no English. He had played from his birth with the <lb/> little Kanakas on his
       father's plantation, and had preferred <lb/> their language and would learn no other. The

       <pb n="57" entity="DSSR_000002496_0072"/> way the boy began to lose his Kanaka and pick up
       English. <lb/> By the time he was twelve he hadn't a word of Kanaka left; <lb/> the language
       had wholly departed from his tongue and from his <lb/> comprehension. Nine years later, when
       he was twenty-one, I <lb/> came upon the family in one of the lake towns of New York, <lb/>
       and the mother told me about an adventure which her son had <lb/> been having. By trade he
       was now a professional diver. A <lb/> passenger boat had been caught in a storm on the lake,
       and had <lb/> gone down, carrying her people with her. A few days later <lb/> the young diver
       descended, with his armor on, and entered the <lb/> berth-saloon of the boat, and stood at
       the foot of the <reg orig="com-|panionway">companionway</reg>, <lb/> with his hand on the
       rail, peering through the dim <lb/> water. Presently something touched him on the shoulder,
       and <lb/> he turned and found a dead man swaying and bobbing about <lb/> him and seemingly
       inspecting him inquiringly. He was <reg orig="par-|alyzed">paralyzed</reg>
       <lb/> with fright. His entry had disturbed the water, and <lb/> now he discerned a number of
       dim corpses making for him and <lb/> wagging their heads and swaying their bodies like sleepy
        <reg orig="peo-|ple">people</reg>
       <lb/> trying to dance. His senses forsook him, and in that <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg>
       <lb/> he was drawn to the surface. He was put to bed at <lb/> home, and was soon very ill.
       During some days he had <reg orig="sea-|sons">seasons</reg>
       <lb/> of delirium which lasted several hours at a time; and <lb/> while they lasted he talked
        <hi rend="italic">Kanaka</hi> incessantly and glibly; and <lb/> Kanaka only. He was still
       very ill, and he talked to me in <lb/> that tongue; but I did not understand it, of course.
       The <lb/> doctor-books tell us that cases like this are not uncommon. <lb/> Then the doctors
       ought to study the cases and find out how <lb/> to multiply them. Many languages and things
       get mislaid in <lb/> a person's head, and stay mislaid for lack of this remedy.</p>
      <p>Many memories of my former visit to the islands came up <lb/> in my mind while we lay at
       anchor in front of Honolulu that <lb/> night. And
       pictures&mdash;pictures&mdash;pictures&mdash;an enchanting <lb/> procession of
       them! I was impatient for the morning to come</p>
      <pb n="58" entity="DSSR_000002496_0073"/>
      <p>When it came it brought disappointment, of course. <lb/> Cholera had broken out in the
       town, and we were not allowed <lb/> to have any communication with the shore. Thus suddenly
       <lb/> did my dream of twenty-nine years go to ruin. Messages came <lb/> from friends, but the
       friends themselves I was not to have any <lb/> sight of. My lecture-hall was ready, but I was
       not to see that, <lb/> either.</p>
      <p>Several of our passengers belonged in Honolulu, and these <lb/> were sent ashore; but
       nobody could go ashore and return. <lb/> There were people on shore who were booked to go
       with us to <lb/> Australia, but we could not receive them; to do it would cost <lb/> us a
       quarantine-term in Sydney. They could have escaped the <lb/> day before, by ship to San
       Francisco; but the bars had been <lb/> put up, now, and they might have to wait weeks before
       any <lb/> ship could venture to give them a passage any whither. And <lb/> there were
       hardships for others. An elderly lady and her son, <lb/> recreation-seekers from
       Massachusetts, had wandered westward, <lb/> further and further from home, always intending
       to take the <lb/> return track, but always concluding to go still a little further; <lb/> and
       now here they were at anchor before Honolulu&mdash;positively <lb/> their last
       westward-bound indulgence&mdash;they had made up <lb/> their minds to
       that&mdash;but where is the use in making up your <lb/> mind in this world? It is
       usually a waste of time to do it. <lb/> These two would have to stay with us as far as
       Australia. <lb/> Then they could go on around the world, or go back the way <lb/> they had
       come; the distance and the accommodations and <reg orig="out-|lay">outlay</reg>
       <lb/> of time would be just the same, whichever of the two <lb/> routes they might elect to
       take. Think of it: a projected <reg orig="ex-|cursion">excursion</reg>
       <lb/> of five hundred miles gradually enlarged, without any <lb/> elaborate degree of
       intention, to a possible twenty-four <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg>. <lb/> However,
       they were used to extentions by this time, and <lb/> did not mind this new one much.</p>
      <p>And we had with us a lawyer from Victoria, who had been <lb/>
       <pb n="59" entity="DSSR_000002496_0074"/> sent out by the Government on an international
       matter, and he <lb/> had brought his wife with him and left the children at home <lb/> with
       the servants&mdash;and now what was to be done? Go ashore <lb/> amongst the cholera and
       take the risks? Most certainly not. <lb/> They decided to go on, to the Fiji islands, wait
       there a <reg orig="fort-|night">fortnight</reg>
       <lb/> for the next ship, and then sail for home. They couldn't <lb/> foresee that they
       wouldn't see a homeward-bound ship again <lb/> for six weeks, and that no word could come to
       them from the <lb/> children, and no word go from them to the children in all that <lb/>
       time. It is easy to make plans in this world; even a cat can <lb/> do it; and when one is out
       in those remote oceans it is <reg orig="notice-|able">noticeable</reg>
       <lb/> that a cat's plans and a man's are worth about the same. <lb/> There is much the same
       shrinkage in both, in the matter of <lb/> values.</p>
      <p>There was nothing for us to do but sit about the decks in <lb/> the shade of the awnings
       and look at the distant shore. We <lb/> lay in luminous blue water; shoreward the water was
       green&mdash; <lb/> green and brilliant; at the shore itself it broke in a long white
       <lb/> ruffle, and with no crash, no sound that we could hear. The <lb/> town was buried under
       a mat of foliage that looked like a <lb/> cushion of moss. The silky mountains were clothed
       in soft, <lb/> rich splendors of melting color, and some of the cliffs were <lb/> veiled in
       slanting mists. I recognized it all. It was just as I <lb/> had seen it long before, with
       nothing of its beauty lost, <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg>
       <lb/> of its charm wanting.</p>
      <p>A change had come, but that was political, and not visible <lb/> from the ship. The
       monarchy of my day was gone, and a <lb/> republic was sitting in its seat. It was not a
       material change. <lb/> The old imitation pomps, the fuss and feathers, have departed, <lb/>
       and the royal trademark&mdash;that is about all that one could <lb/> miss, I suppose.
       That imitation monarchy was grotesque <lb/> enough, in my time; if it had held on another
       thirty years it <lb/> would have been a monarchy without subjects of the king's race.</p>
      <pb n="60" entity="DSSR_000002496_0075"/>
      <p>We had a sunset of a very fine sort. The vast plain of the <lb/> sea was marked off in
       bands of sharply-contrasted colors: <lb/> great stretches of dark blue, others of purple,
       others of polished <lb/> bronze; the billowy mountains showed all sorts of dainty <lb/>
       browns and greens, blues and purples and blacks, and the <lb/> rounded velvety backs of
       certain of them made one want to <lb/> stroke them, as one would the sleek back of a cat. The
       long, <lb/> sloping promontory projecting into the sea at the west turned <lb/> dim and
       leaden and spectral, then became suffused with pink <lb/> &mdash;dissolved itself in a
       pink dream, so to speak, it seemed so <lb/> airy and unreal. Presently the cloud-rack was
       flooded with <lb/> fiery splendors, and these were copied on the surface of the <lb/> sea,
       and it made one drunk with delight to look upon it.</p>
      <p>From talks with certain of our passengers whose home was <lb/> Honolulu, and from a sketch
       by Mrs. Mary H. Krout, I was <lb/> able to perceive what the Honolulu of to-day is, as
       compared <lb/> with the Honolulu of my time. In my time it was a beautiful <lb/> little town,
       made up of snow-white wooden cottages deliciously <lb/> smothered in tropical vines and
       flowers and trees and shrubs; <lb/> and its coral roads and streets were hard and smooth, and
       as <lb/> white as the houses. The outside aspects of the place <reg orig="sug-|gested"
        >suggested</reg>
       <lb/> the presence of a modest and comfortable prosperity&mdash; <lb/> a general
       prosperity&mdash;perhaps one might strengthen the term <lb/> and say universal. There
       were no fine houses, no fine <reg orig="furni-|ture">furniture</reg>. <lb/> There were no
       decorations. Tallow candles furnished <lb/> the light for the bedrooms, a whale-oil lamp
       furnished it for <lb/> the parlor. Native matting served as carpeting. In the parlor <lb/>
       one would find two or three lithographs on the walls&mdash;portraits <lb/> as a rule:
       Kamehameha IV., Louis Kossuth, Jenny Lind; and <lb/> may be an engraving or two: Rebecca at
       the Well, Moses <lb/> smiting the rock, Joseph's servants finding the cup in <reg
        orig="Ben-|jamin's">Benjamin's</reg>
       <lb/> sack. There would be a center table, with books of a <lb/> tranquil sort on it: The
       whole Duty of Man, Baxter's Saints' <lb/>
       <pb n="61" entity="DSSR_000002496_0076"/> Rest, Fox's Martyrs, Tupper's Proverbial
       Philosophy, bound <lb/> copies of The Missionary Herald and of Father Damon's <lb/> Seaman's
       Friend. A melodeon; a music stand, with Willie, <lb/> We have Missed You, Star of the
       Evening, Roll on Silver <lb/> Moon, Are We Most There, I Would not Live Alway, and <lb/>
       other songs of love and sentiment, together with an <reg orig="assort-|ment">assortment</reg>
       <lb/> of hymns. A what-not with semi-globular glass <reg orig="paper-|weights"
       >paperweights</reg>, <lb/> enclosing miniature pictures of ships, New England <lb/> rural
       snowstorms, and the like; sea-shells with Bible texts <lb/> carved on them in cameo style;
       native curios; whale's tooth <lb/> with full-rigged ship carved on it. There was nothing <reg
        orig="remin-|iscent">reminiscent</reg>
       <lb/> of foreign parts, for nobody had been abroad. Trips <lb/> were made to San Francisco,
       but that could not be called going <lb/> abroad. Comprehensively speaking, nobody traveled.</p>
      <p>But Honolulu has grown wealthy since then, and of course <lb/> wealth has introduced
       changes; some of the old simplicities <lb/> have disappeared. Here is a modern house, as
       pictured by <lb/> Mrs. Krout: <lb/>
       <q>"Almost every house is surrounded by extensive lawns and gardens <reg orig="en-|closed"
         >enclosed</reg>
        <lb/> by walls of volcanic stone or by thick hedges of the brilliant hibiscus.</q>
       <q>"The houses are most tastefully and comfortably furnished; the floors <lb/> are either of
        hard wood covered with rugs or with fine Indian matting, while <lb/> there is a preference,
        as in most warm countries, for rattan or bamboo <reg orig="furni-|ture">furniture</reg>;
        <lb/> there are the usual accessories of bric-a-brac, pictures, books, and <lb/> curios from
        all parts of the world, for these island dwellers are indefatigable <lb/> travelers.</q>
       <q>"Nearly every house has what is called a <hi rend="italic">lanai</hi>. It is a large
        apartment, <lb/> roofed, floored, open on three sides, with a door or a draped archway
        opening <lb/> into the drawing-room. Frequently the roof is formed by the thick <reg
         orig="inter-|lacing">interlacing</reg>
        <lb/> boughs of the <hi rend="italic">hou</hi> tree, impervious to the sun and even to the
        rain, <reg orig="ex-|cept">except</reg>
        <lb/> in violent storms. Vines are trained about the sides&mdash;the stephanotis or
        <lb/> some one of the countless fragrant and blossoming trailers which abound in <lb/> the
        islands. There are also curtains of matting that may be drawn to <reg orig="ex-|clude"
         >exclude</reg>
        <lb/> the sun or rain. The floor is bare for coolness, or partially covered <lb/> with rugs,
        and the <hi rend="italic">lanai</hi> is prettily furnished with comfortable chairs, sofas,
        <lb/> and tables loaded with flowers, or wonderful ferns in pots.</q>
       <q>"The <hi rend="italic">lanai</hi> is the favorite reception room, and here at any social
        function <lb/> the musical program is given and cakes and ices are served; here morning
        <lb/> callers are received, or gay riding parties, the ladies in pretty divided skirts, <lb/>
        <pb n="62" entity="DSSR_000002496_0077"/> worn for convenience in riding
        astride,&mdash;the universal mode adopted by <lb/> Europeans and Americans, as well as
        by the natives.</q>
       <q>"The comfort and luxury of such an apartment, especially at a seashore <lb/> villa, can
        hardly be imagined. The soft breezes sweep across it, heavy with <lb/> the fragrance of
        jasmine and gardenia, and through the swaying boughs of <lb/> palm and mimosa there are
        glimpses of rugged mountains, their summits <lb/> veiled in clouds, of purple sea with the
        white surf beating eternally against <lb/> the reefs,&mdash;whiter still in the yellow
        sunlight or the magical moonlight of <lb/> the tropics."</q></p>
      <p>There: rugs, ices, pictures, lanais, worldly books, sinful <lb/> bric-a-brac fetched from
       everywhere. And the ladies riding <lb/> astride. These are changes, indeed. In my time the
       native <lb/> women rode astride, but the white ones lacked the courage to <lb/> adopt their
       wise custom. In my time ice was seldom seen in <lb/> Honolulu. It sometimes came in sailing
       vessels from New <lb/> England as ballast; and then, if there happened to be a <reg
        orig="man-|of-war">man-of-war</reg>
       <lb/> in port and balls and suppers raging by consequence, <lb/> the ballast was worth six
       hundred dollars a ton, as is evidenced <lb/> by reputable tradition. But the ice-machine has
       traveled all <lb/> over the world, now, and brought ice within everybody's <lb/> reach. In
       Lapland and Spitzbergen no one uses native ice in <lb/> our day, except the bears and the
       walruses.</p>
      <p>The bicycle is not mentioned. It was not necessary. We <lb/> know that it is there, without
       inquiring. It is everywhere. <lb/> But for it, people could never have had summer homes on
       the <lb/> summit of Mont Blanc; before its day, property up there had <lb/> but a nominal
       value. The ladies of the Hawaiian capital <lb/> learned too late the right way to occupy a
       horse&mdash;too late to <lb/> get much benefit from it. The riding-horse is retiring
       from <lb/> business everywhere in the world. In Honolulu a few years <lb/> from now he will
       be only a tradition.</p>
      <p>We all know about Father Damien, the French priest <lb/> who voluntarily forsook the world
       and went to the leper <lb/> island of Molokai to labor among its population of sorrowful
       <lb/> exiles who wait there, in slow-consuming misery, for death <lb/>
       <pb n="63" entity="DSSR_000002496_0078"/> to come and release them from their troubles; and
       we know <lb/> that the thing which he knew beforehand would happen, did <lb/> happen: that he
       became a leper himself, and died of that <lb/> horrible disease. There was still another case
       of self-sacrifice, <lb/> it appears. I asked after "Billy" Ragsdale, interpreter to the <lb/>
       Parliament in my time&mdash;a half-white. He was a brilliant <lb/> young fellow, and
       very popular. As an interpreter he would <lb/> have been hard to match anywhere. He used to
       stand up in <lb/> the Parliament and turn the English speeches into Hawaiian <lb/> and the
       Hawaiian speeches into English with a readiness <lb/> and a volubility that were astonishing.
       I asked after him, <lb/> and was told that his prosperous career was cut short in a <lb/>
       sudden and unexpected way, just as he was about to marry <lb/> a beautiful half-caste girl.
       He discovered, by some nearly <lb/> invisible sign about his skin, that the poison of leprosy
       was in <lb/> him. The secret was his own, and might be kept concealed <lb/> for years; but he
       would not be treacherous to the girl that <lb/> loved him; he would not marry her to a doom
       like his. And <lb/> so he put his affairs in order, and went around to all his friends <lb/>
       and bade them good-bye, and sailed in the leper ship to <lb/> Molokai. There he died the
       loathsome and lingering death <lb/> that all lepers die.</p>
      <p>In this place let me insert a paragraph or two from "The <lb/> Paradise of the Pacific"
       (Rev. H. H. Gowen): <lb/>
       <q>"Poor lepers! It is easy for those who have no relatives or friends <lb/> among them to
        enforce the decree of segregation to the letter, but who can <lb/> write of the terrible,
        the heart-breaking scenes which that enforcement has <lb/> brought about?</q>
       <q>"A man upon Hawaii was suddenly taken away after a summary arrest, <lb/> leaving behind
        him a helpless wife about to give birth to a babe. The <lb/> devoted wife with great pain
        and risk came the whole journey to Honolulu, <lb/> and pleaded until the authorities were
        unable to resist her entreaty that she <lb/> might go and live like a leper with her leper
        husband</q>. <q>"A woman in the prime of life and activity is condemned as an incipient
        <lb/> leper, suddenly removed from her home, and her husband returns to find his <lb/> two
        helpless babes moaning for their lost mother.</q>
       <pb n="64" entity="DSSR_000002496_0079"/>
       <q>"Imagine it! The case of the babies is hard, but its bitterness is a trifle <lb/>
        &mdash;less than a trifle&mdash;less than nothing&mdash;compared to what the
        mother must <lb/> suffer; and suffer minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day, month by
        <lb/> month, year by year, without respite, relief, or any abatement of her pain till <lb/>
        she dies.</q>
       <q>"One woman, Luka Kaaukau, has been living with her leper husband in <lb/> the settlement
        for twelve years. The man has scarcely a joint left, his limbs <lb/> are only distorted
        ulcerated stumps, for four years his wife has put every <lb/> particle of food into his
        mouth. He wanted his wife to abandon his wretched <lb/> carcass long ago, as she herself was
        sound and well, but Luka said that she <lb/> was content to remain and wait on the man she
        loved till the spirit should be <lb/> freed from its burden.</q>
       <q>"I myself have known hard cases enough:&mdash;of a girl, apparently in full <lb/>
        health, decorating the church with me at Easter, who before Christmas is <lb/> taken away as
        a confirmed leper; of a mother hiding her child in the <lb/> mountains for years so that not
        even her dearest friends knew that she had a <lb/> child alive, that he might not be taken
        away; of a respectable white man <lb/> taken away from his wife and family, and compelled to
        become a dweller in <lb/> the Leper Settlement, where he is counted dead, <hi rend="italic"
         >even by the insurance <lb/> companies.</hi>"</q></p>
      <p>And one great pity of it all is, that these poor sufferers <lb/> are innocent. The leprosy
       does not come of sins which they <lb/> committed, but of sins committed by their ancestors,
       who <lb/>
       <hi rend="italic">escaped</hi> the curse of leprosy!</p>
      <p>Mr. Gowan has made record of a certain very striking <lb/> circumstance. Would you expect
       to find in that awful Leper <lb/> Settlement a custom worthy to be transplanted to your own
       <lb/> country? They have one such, and it is inexpressibly touching <lb/> and beautiful. When
       death sets open the prison-door of life <lb/> there, the band salutes the freed soul with a
       burst of glad <lb/> music!</p>

       >horseplay</reg>. <lb/> All that sort of thing <lb/> has gone out. In old times a <lb/>
      sailor, dressed as Neptune, used <lb/> to come in over the bows, with <lb/> his suite, and
      lather up and <lb/> shave everybody who was <reg orig="cross-|ing">crossing</reg>
      <lb/> the equator for the first <lb/> time, and then cleanse these <lb/> unfortunates by
      swinging them <lb/> from the yard-arm and ducking them three times in the sea. <lb/> This was
      considered funny. Nobody knows why. No, that <lb/> is not true. We do know why. Such a thing
      could never be <lb/> funny on land; no part of the old-time grotesque performances <lb/>
      gotten up on shipboard to celebrate the passage of the line <lb/> could ever be funny on
      shore&mdash;they would seem dreary and <lb/> witless to shore people. But the shore
      people would change <lb/> their minds about it at sea, on a long voyage. On such a <lb/>
      voyage, with its eternal monotonies, people's intellects <reg orig="dete-|riorate"

      at sea, and the interest they take in <lb/> them, and the consuming enjoyment they get out of
      them. <lb/> This is on long voyages only. The mind gradually becomes <lb/> inert, dull,

     <p>The short-voyage passenger gets his chief physical exercise <lb/> out of
      "horse-billiards"&mdash;shovel-board. It is a good game. <lb/> We play it in this ship. A
      quartermaster chalks off a diagram <lb/> like this&mdash;on the deck.</p>
     <p>The player uses a cue that is like a broom-handle with a <lb/> quarter-moon of wood fastened
      to the end of it. With this he <lb/> shoves wooden disks the size of a saucer&mdash;he
      gives the disk a <lb/> vigorous shove and sends it fifteen or twenty feet along the <lb/> deck
      and lands it in one of the squares if he can. If it stays <lb/> there till the inning is
      played out, it will count as many points <lb/> in the game as the figure in the square it has
      stopped in <reg orig="rep-|resents">represents</reg>. <lb/> The adversary plays to knock that
      disk out and leave <lb/> his own in its place&mdash;particularly if it rests upon the 9
      or 10 <lb/> or some other of the high numbers; but if it rests in the "<reg orig="10-|off"
       >10off</reg>" <lb/> he backs it up&mdash;lands his disk behind it a foot or two, to
      <lb/> make it difficult for its owner to knock it out of that <reg orig="damag-|ing">damaging</reg>
      <lb/> place and improve his record. When the inning is played <lb/> out it may be found that
      each adversary has placed his four <lb/> disks where they count; it may be found that some of
      them <lb/> are touching chalk lines and not counting; and very often it <lb/> will be found
      that there has been a general wreckage, and <lb/> that not a disk has been left within the
      diagram. Anyway, <lb/> the result is recorded, whatever it is, and the game goes on. <lb/> The
      game is 100 points, and it takes from twenty minutes to <lb/> forty to play it, according to
      luck and the condition of the sea. <lb/> It is an exciting game, and the crowd of spectators
      furnish <lb/> abundance of applause for fortunate shots and plenty of <reg orig="laugh-|ter"
       >laughter</reg>
      <lb/> for the other kind. It is a game of skill, but at the same <lb/> time the uneasy motion
      of the ship is constantly interfering <lb/>
      <pb n="70" entity="DSSR_000002496_0085"/> with skill; this makes it a chancy game, and the
      element of <lb/> luck comes largely in.</p>
     <p>We had a couple of grand tournaments, to determine who <lb/> should be "Champion of the
      Pacific"; they included among <lb/> the participants nearly all the passengers, of both sexes,
      and <lb/> the officers of the ship, and they afforded many days of <reg orig="stu-|pendous"

      <lb/> interest and excitement, and murderous exercise&mdash;for <lb/> horse-billiards is
      a physically violent game.</p>
     <p>The figures in the following record of some of the closing <lb/> games in the first
      tournament will show, better than any <lb/> description, how very chancy the game is. The
      losers here <lb/> represented had all been winners in the previous games of the <lb/> series,

     <p>And so on; until but three couples of winners were left. <lb/> Then I beat my man, young
      Smith beat his man, and Thomas <lb/> beat his. This reduced the combatants to three. Smith and
      I <lb/> took the deck, and I led off. At the close of the first inning I <lb/> was 10 worse
      than nothing and Smith had scored 7. The luck <lb/> continued against me. When I was 57, Smith
      was 97&mdash; <lb/> within 3 of out. The luck changed then. He picked up a <lb/> 10-off
      or so, and couldn't recover. I beat him.</p>
     <p>The next game would end tournament No. 1.</p>
     <p>Mr. Thomas and I were the contestants. He won the lead <lb/> and went to the
      bat&mdash;so to speak. And there he stood, with <lb/> the crotch of his cue resting
      against his disk while the ship <lb/> rose slowly up, sank slowly down, rose again, sank
      again. She <lb/> never seemed to rise to suit him exactly. She started up once <lb/> more; and
      when she was nearly ready for the turn, he let <lb/> drive and landed his disk just within the
      left-hand end of the <lb/>
      <pb n="71" entity="DSSR_000002496_0086"/> 10. (Applause). The umpire
      proclaimed "a good 10," and <lb/> the game-keeper set it down. I played: my disk grazed the
      <lb/> edge of Mr. Thomas's disk, and went out of the diagram. (No <lb/>
      applause.)</p>
     <p>Mr. Thomas played again&mdash;and landed his second disk <lb/> alongside of the first,
      and almost touching its right-hand side. <lb/> "Good 10." (Great applause.)</p>
     <p>I played, and missed both of them. (No applause.)</p>
     <p>Mr. Thomas delivered his third shot and landed his disk <lb/> just at the right of the other
      two. "Good 10." (Immense <lb/> applause.)</p>
     <p>There they lay, side by side, the three in a row. It did <lb/> not seem possible that
      anybody could miss them. Still I did <lb/> it. (Immense silence.)</p>
     <p>Mr. Thomas played his last disk. It seems incredible, but <lb/> he actually landed that disk
      alongside of the others, and just <lb/> to the right of them&mdash;a straight solid row
      of 4 disks. <reg orig="(Tu-|multuous">(Tumultuous</reg>
      <lb/> and long-continued applause.)</p>
     <p>Then I played my last disk. Again it did not seem possible <lb/> that anybody could miss
      that row&mdash;a row which would have <lb/> been 14 inches long if the disks had been
      clamped together; <lb/> whereas, with the spaces separating them they made a longer <lb/> row
      than that. But I did it. It may be that I was getting <lb/> nervous.</p>
     <p>I think it unlikely that that innings has ever had its <lb/> parallel in the history of
      horse-billiards. To place the four <lb/> disks side by side in the 10 was an extraordinary
      feat; indeed, <lb/> it was a kind of miracle. To miss them was another miracle. <lb/> It will
      take a century to produce another man who can place <lb/> the four disks in the 10; and longer
      than that to find a man <lb/> who can't knock them out. I was ashamed of my performance <lb/>
      at the time, but now that I reflect upon it I see that it was <lb/> rather fine and difficult.</p>
     <pb n="72" entity="DSSR_000002496_0087"/>
     <p>Mr. Thomas kept his luck, and won the game, and later the <lb/> championship.</p>
     <p>In a minor tournament I won the prize, which was a <lb/> Waterbury watch. I put it in my
      trunk. In Pretoria, South <lb/> Africa, nine months afterward, my proper watch broke down
      <lb/> and I took the Waterbury out, wound it, set it by the great <lb/> clock on the
      Parliament House (8.05), then went back to my <lb/> room and went to bed,
      tired from a long railway journey. <lb/> The parliamentary clock had a peculiarity which I was
      not <lb/> aware of at the time&mdash;a peculiarity which exists in no other <lb/> clock,
      and would not exist in that one if it had been made <lb/> by a sane person; on the half-hour
      it strikes the succeeding <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">hour</hi>, then strikes the hour <hi rend="italic">again</hi> at the proper
      time. I <lb/> lay reading and smoking awhile; then, when I could hold my <lb/> eyes open no
      longer and was about to put out the light, the <lb/> great clock began to <lb/> boom, and I
      counted&mdash; <lb/> ten. I reached for the Waterbury to see how it was getting <lb/>
      along. It was marking 9.30. It seemed rather poor speed for <lb/> a three-dollar watch, but I
      supposed that the climate was <lb/>
      <figure id="f18" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002496_0087">
       <p>I BEAT HER BRAINS OUT.</p>
      </figure>
      <pb n="73" entity="DSSR_000002496_0088"/> affecting it. I shoved it half an hour ahead, and
      took to my <lb/> book and waited to see what would happen. At 10 the great <lb/> clock struck
      ten <hi rend="italic">again</hi>. I looked&mdash;the Waterbury was <reg orig="mark-|ing"
       >marking</reg>
      <lb/> half-past 10. This was too much speed for the money, and <lb/> it troubled me. I pushed
      the hands back a half hour, and <lb/> waited once more; I had to, for I was vexed and restless
      <lb/> now, and my sleepiness was gone. By and by the great clock <lb/> struck 11. The
      Waterbury was marking 10.30. I pushed it <lb/> ahead half an hour, with some show of temper.
      By and by <lb/> the great clock struck 11 again. The Waterbury showed <lb/> up 11.30, now, and
      I beat her brains out against the bedstead. <lb/> I was sorry next day, when I found out.</p>
     <p>To return to the ship.</p>
     <p>The average human being is a perverse creature; and when <lb/> he isn't that, he is a
      practical joker. The result to the other <lb/> person concerned is about the same: that is, he
      is made to <reg orig="suf-|fer">suffer</reg>. <lb/> The washing down of the decks begins at a
      very early <lb/> hour in all ships; in but few ships are any measures taken to <lb/> protect
      the passengers, either by waking or warning them, or <lb/> by sending a steward to close their
      ports. And so the <reg orig="deck-|washers">deck-washers</reg>
      <lb/> have their opportunity, and they use it. They send a <lb/> bucket of water slashing
      along the side of the ship and into <lb/> the ports, drenching the passenger's clothes, and
      often the <reg orig="pas-|senger">passenger</reg>
      <lb/> himself. This good old custom prevailed in this ship, <lb/> and under unusually
      favorable circumstances, for in the blazing <lb/> tropical regions a removable zinc thing like
      a sugar-shovel <reg orig="pro-|jects">projects</reg>
      <lb/> from the port to catch the wind and bring it in; this <lb/> thing catches the wash-water
      and brings it in, too&mdash;and in <lb/> flooding abundance. Mrs. I., an invalid, had to
      sleep on the <lb/> locker-sofa under her port, and every time she over-slept and <lb/> thus
      failed to take care of herself, the deck-washers drowned <lb/> her out.</p>
     <p>And the painters, what a good time they had! This ship <lb/>
      <pb n="74" entity="DSSR_000002496_0089"/> would be going into dock for a month in Sydney for
      repairs; <lb/> but no matter, painting was going on all the time somewhere <lb/> or other. The
      ladies' dresses were constantly getting ruined, <lb/> nevertheless protests and supplications
      went for nothing. <lb/> Sometimes a lady, taking an afternoon nap on deck near a <lb/>
      ventilator or some other thing that didn't need painting, <lb/> would wake up by and by and
      find that the humorous painter <lb/> had been noiselessly daubing that thing and had
      splattered her <lb/> white gown all over with little greasy yellow spots.</p>
     <p>The blame for this untimely painting did not lie with the <lb/> ship's officers, but with
      custom. As far back as Noah's time <lb/> it became law that ships must be constantly painted
      and fussed <lb/> at when at sea; custom grew out of the law, and at sea custom <lb/> knows no
      death; this custom will continue until the sea goes <lb/> dry.</p>

      <lb/> There is something uncanny about it. And uncomfortable. <lb/> In fact, nearly
      unthinkable, and wholly unrealizable, when <lb/> one comes to consider it. While we were
      crossing the 180th <lb/> meridian it was <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi> in the stern of the
      ship where my <lb/> family were, and <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi> in the bow where I was.
      They <lb/> were there eating the half of a fresh apple on the 8th, and <lb/> I was at the same
      time eating the other half of it on the <lb/> 10th&mdash;and I could notice how stale it
      was, already. The <lb/> family were the same age that they were when I had left <lb/> them
      five minutes before, but I was a day older now than <lb/> I was then. The day they were living
      in stretched behind <lb/> them half way round the globe, across the Pacific Ocean <lb/> and
      America and Europe; the day I was living in stretched <lb/> in front of me around the other
      half to meet it. They were <lb/> stupendous days for bulk and stretch; apparently much larger
      <lb/> days than we had ever been in before. All previous days had <lb/> been but shrunk-up
      little things by comparison. The <reg orig="differ-|ence">difference</reg>
      <lb/> in temperature between the two days was very marked, <lb/> their day being hotter than
      mine because it was closer to the <lb/> equator.</p>
     <pb n="76" entity="DSSR_000002496_0091"/>
     <p>Along about the moment that we were crossing the Great <lb/> Meridian a child was born in
      the steerage, and now there is <lb/> no way to tell which day it was born on. The nurse thinks
      <lb/> it was Sunday, the surgeon thinks it was Tuesday. The child <lb/> will never know its
      own birthday. It will always be choosing <lb/> first one and then the other, and will never be
      able to make <lb/> up its mind permanently. This will breed vacillation and <reg
       orig="un-|certainty">uncertainty</reg>
      <lb/> in its opinions about religion, and politics, and <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg>,
      <lb/> and sweethearts, and everything, and will undermine its <lb/> principles, and rot them
      away, and make the poor thing <lb/> characterless, and its success in life impossible. Every
      one <lb/> in the ship says so. And this is not all&mdash;in fact, not the <lb/> worst.
      For there is an enormously rich brewer in the ship <lb/> who said as much as ten days ago,
      that if the child was born <lb/> on his birthday he would give it ten thousand dollars to
      <lb/> start its little life with. His birthday was Monday, the 9th <lb/> of September.</p>
     <p>If the ships all moved in the one direction&mdash;westward, <lb/> I mean&mdash;the
      world would suffer a prodigious loss in the <lb/> matter of valuable time, through the dumping
      overboard on <lb/> the Great Meridian of such multitudes of days by ships' crews <lb/> and
      passengers. But fortunately the ships do not all sail <lb/> west, half of them sail east. So
      there is no real loss. These <lb/> latter pick up all the discarded days and add them to the
      <lb/> world's stock again; and about as good as new, too; for of <lb/> course the salt water
      preserves them.</p>

      necessarily quite impartial, and was <lb/> equally as well and as ill equipped to fight on the
      one side as on <lb/> the other. So I spoke up and said the peasantry pronounced <lb/> the word
       <hi rend="italic">three</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">thraw</hi>. It was an error of judgment.
      <lb/> There was a moment of astonished and ominous silence, then <lb/> weather ensued. The
      storm rose and spread in a surprising <lb/> way, and I was snowed under in a very few minutes.
      It was <lb/> a bad defeat for me&mdash;a kind of Waterloo. It promised to <lb/> remain
      so, and I wished I had had better sense than to enter <lb/> upon such a forlorn enterprise.
      But just then I had a saving <lb/>
      <pb n="78" entity="DSSR_000002496_0093"/> thought&mdash;at least a thought that offered a
      chance. While the <lb/> storm was still raging, I made up a Scotch couplet, and then <lb/>
      spoke up and said:&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Very well, don't say any more. I confess defeat. I <lb/> thought I knew, but I see my
      mistake. I was deceived by one <lb/> of your Scotch poets."</p>
     <p>"A <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi> poet! O come! Name him."</p>
     <p>
      <hi rend="italic">"Robert Burns."</hi>
     </p>
     <p>It is wonderful the power of that name. These men looked <lb/> doubtful&mdash;but
      paralyzed, all the same. They were quite <lb/> silent for a moment; then one of them
      said&mdash;with the <reg orig="rever-|ence">reverence</reg>
      <lb/> in his voice which is always present in a Scotchman's tone <lb/> when he utters the
      name:</p>
     <p>"Does Robbie Burns say&mdash;<hi rend="italic">what</hi> does he say?"</p>
     <p>"This is what he says: <lb/>
      <q>
       <lg type="group">
        <l>'"There were nae bairns but only three&mdash;</l>
        <l>Ane at the breast, twa at the knee."'</l>
       </lg>
      </q></p>
     <p>It ended the discussion. There was no man there profane <lb/> enough, disloyal enough, to
      say any word against a thing <lb/> which Robert Burns had settled. I shall always honor that
      <lb/> great name for the salvation it brought me in this time of my <lb/> sore need.</p>
     <p>It is my belief that nearly any invented quotation, played <lb/> with confidence, stands a
      good chance to deceive. There are <lb/> people who think that honesty is always the best
      policy. This <lb/> is a superstition; there are times when the appearance of it is <lb/> worth
      six of it.</p>
     <p>We are moving steadily southward&mdash;getting further and <lb/> further down under the
      projecting paunch of the globe. <reg orig="Yes-|terday">Yesterday</reg>
      <lb/> evening we saw the Big Dipper and the north star sink <lb/> below the horizon and
      disappear from our world. No, not <lb/> "we," but they. They saw it&mdash;somebody saw
      it&mdash;and told <lb/> me about it. But it is no matter, I was not caring for those <lb/>
      <pb n="79" entity="DSSR_000002496_0094"/> things, I am tired of them, any way. I think they
      are well <lb/> enough, but one doesn't want them always hanging around. <lb/> My interest was
      all in the Southern Cross. I had never seen <lb/> that. I had heard about it all my life, and
      it was but natural <lb/> that I should be burning to see it. No other constellation <lb/>
      makes so much talk. I had nothing against the Big Dipper&mdash; <lb/> and naturally
      couldn't have anything against it, since it is a <lb/> citizen of our own sky, and the
      property of the United States&mdash; <lb/> but I did want it to move out of the way and
      give this <lb/> foreigner a chance. Judging by the size of the talk which the <lb/> Southern
      Cross had made, I supposed it would need a sky all <lb/> to itself.</p>
     <p>But that was a mistake. We saw the Cross to-night, and it <lb/> is not large. Not large, and
      not strikingly bright. But it was <lb/> low down toward the horizon, and it may improve when
      it gets <lb/> up higher in the sky. It is ingeniously named, for it looks just <lb/> as a
      cross would look if it looked like something else. But <lb/> that description does not
      describe; it is too vague, too general, <lb/> too indefinite. It does after a fashion suggest
      a cross&mdash;a cross <lb/> that is out of repair&mdash;or out of drawing; not
      correctly shaped. <lb/> It is long, with a short cross-bar, and the cross-bar is canted <lb/>
      out of the straight line.</p>
     <figure id="f20" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002496_0094">
      <p>OUT OF REPAIR.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>It consists of four large stars and <lb/> one little one. The little one is out <lb/> of
      line and further damages the shape. <lb/> It should have been placed at the <reg
       orig="inter-|section">intersection</reg>
      <lb/> of the stem and the cross-bar. <lb/> If you do not draw an imaginary line from star to
      star it does <lb/> not suggest a cross&mdash;nor anything in particular.</p>
     <p>One must ignore the little star, and leave it out of the <reg
       orig="com-|bination&mdash;it">combination&mdash;it</reg>
      <lb/> confuses everything. If you leave it out, then you <lb/> can make out of the four stars
      a sort of cross&mdash;out of true; or <lb/> a sort of kite&mdash;out of true; or a
      sort of coffin&mdash;out of true.</p>
     <pb n="80" entity="DSSR_000002496_0095"/>
     <p>Constellations have always been troublesome things to <lb/> name. If you give one of them a
      fanciful name, it will always <lb/> refuse to live up to it; it will always persist in not
      resembling <lb/> the thing it has been named <lb/> for. Ultimately, to satisfy <lb/> the
      public, the fanciful name <lb/> has to be discarded for a <reg orig="com-|mon-sense"
       >common-sense</reg>
      <lb/> one, a manifestly <lb/> descriptive one. The Great <lb/> Bear remained the Great Bear
      <lb/> &mdash;and unrecognizable as such <lb/> &mdash;for thousands of years; and
      <lb/> people complained about it all <lb/> the time, and quite properly; <lb/> but as soon as
      it became the <lb/> property of the United States, <lb/> Congress changed it to the <lb/> Big
      Dipper, and now <reg orig="every-|body">everybody</reg>
      <lb/> is satisfied, and there is no more talk about riots. I <lb/> would not change the
      Southern Cross to the Southern Coffin, <lb/> I would change it to the Southern Kite; for up
      there in the <lb/> general emptiness is the proper home of a kite, but not for <lb/> coffins
      and crosses and dippers. In a little while, now&mdash;I <lb/> cannot tell exactly how
      long it will be&mdash;the globe will belong <lb/> to the English-speaking race; and of
      course the skies also. <lb/> Then the constellations will be re-organized, and polished up,
      <lb/> and re-named&mdash;the most of them "Victoria," I reckon, but <lb/> this one will
      sail thereafter as the Southern Kite, or go out of <lb/> business. Several towns and things,
      here and there, have been <lb/> named for Her Majesty already.</p>

      <p>SOUTHERN CROSS.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>In these past few days we are plowing through a mighty <lb/> Milky Way of islands. They are
      so thick on the map that one <lb/> would hardly expect to find room between them for a canoe; <lb/>
      <pb n="81" entity="DSSR_000002496_0096"/> yet we seldom glimpse one. Once we saw the dim bulk
      of a <lb/> couple of them, far away, spectral and dreamy things; <reg orig="mem-|bers">members</reg>
      <lb/> of the Horne&mdash;Alofa and Fortuna. On the larger one <lb/> are two rival native
      kings&mdash;and they have a time together. <lb/> They are Catholics; so are their people.
      The missionaries <lb/> there are French priests.</p>
     <p>From the multitudinous islands in these regions the "<reg orig="re-|cruits">recruits</reg>"
      <lb/> for the Queensland plantations were formerly drawn; <lb/> are still drawn from them, I
      believe. Vessels fitted up like <lb/> old-time slavers came here and carried off the natives
      to serve <lb/> as laborers in the great Australian province. In the beginning <lb/> it was
      plain, simple manstealing, as per testimony of the <reg orig="mis-|sionaries"
      >missionaries</reg>. <lb/> This has been denied, but not disproven. <reg orig="After-|ward"
       >Afterward</reg>
      <lb/> it was forbidden by law to "recruit" a native without <lb/> his consent, and
      governmental agents were sent in all recruiting <lb/> vessels to see that the law was
      obeyed&mdash;which they did, <lb/> according to the recruiting people; and which they
      sometimes <lb/> didn't, according to the missionaries. A man could be lawfully <lb/> recruited
      for a three-years term of service; he could volunteer <lb/> for another term if he so chose;
      when his time was up he <lb/> could return to his island. And would also have the means to
      <lb/> do it; for the government required the employer to put money <lb/> in its hands for this
      purpose before the recruit was delivered to <lb/> him.</p>
     <p>Captain Wawn was a recruiting shipmaster during many <lb/> years. From his pleasant book one
      gets the idea that the <lb/> recruiting business was quite popular with the islanders, as a
      <lb/> rule. And yet that did not make the business wholly dull and <lb/> uninteresting; for
      one finds rather frequent little breaks in the <lb/> monotony of it&mdash;like this, for
      instance: <lb/>
      <q>"The afternoon of our arrival at Leper Island the schooner was lying <lb/> almost becalmed
       under the lee of the lofty central portion of the island, about <lb/> three-quarters of a
       mile from the shore. The boats were in sight at some <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg>. <lb/>
       <pb n="82" entity="DSSR_000002496_0097"/> The recruiter-boat had run into a small nook on the
       rocky coast, under <lb/> a high bank, above which stood a solitary hut backed by dense
       forest. The <lb/> government agent and mate in the second boat lay about 400 yards to the
       <lb/> westward.</q>
      <q>"Suddenly we heard the sound of firing, followed by yells from the <lb/> natives on shore,
       and then we saw the recruiter-boat push out with a <reg orig="seem-|ingly">seemingly</reg>
       <lb/> diminished crew. The mate's boat pulled quickly up, took her in tow, <lb/> and
       presently brought her alongside, all her own crew being more or less hurt. <lb/> It seems the
       natives had called them into the place on pretence of friendship. <lb/> A crowd gathered
       about the stern of the boat, and several fellows even got <lb/> into her. All of a sudden our
       men were attacked with clubs and tomahawks. <lb/> The recruiter escaped the first blows aimed
       at him, making play with his fists <lb/> until he had an opportunity to draw his revolver.
       'Tom Sayers,' a Mar&eacute; <lb/> man, received a tomahawk blow on the head which laid
       the scalp open but <lb/> did not penetrate his skull, fortunately. 'Bobby Towns,' another
       Mar&eacute; <reg orig="boat-|man">boatman</reg>, <lb/> had both his thumbs cut in warding
       off blows, one of them being so <lb/> nearly severed from the hand that the doctors had to
       finish the operation. <lb/> Lihu, a Lifu boy, the recruiter's special attendant, was cut and
       pricked in <lb/> various places, but nowhere seriously. Jack, an unlucky Tanna recruit, who
       <lb/> had been engaged to act as boatman, received an arrow through his forearm, <lb/> the
       head of which&mdash;a piece of bone seven or eight inches long&mdash;was still
       <lb/> in the limb, protruding from both sides, when the boats returned. The <reg
        orig="re-|cruiter">recruiter</reg>
       <lb/> himself would have got off scot-free had not an arrow pinned one of <lb/> his fingers
       to the loom of the steering-oar just as they were getting off. The <lb/> fight had been short
       but sharp. The enemy lost two men, both shot dead."</q></p>
     <p>The truth is, Captain Wawn furnishes such a crowd of <lb/> instances of fatal encounters
      between natives and French and <lb/> English recruiting-crews (for the French are in
      the business for <lb/> the plantations of New Caledonia), that one is almost <reg
       orig="per-|suaded">persuaded</reg>
      <lb/> that recruiting is not thoroughly popular among the <lb/> islanders; else why this
      bristling string of attacks and <reg orig="blood-|curdling">bloodcurdling</reg>
      <lb/> slaughter? The captain lays it all to "Exeter Hall <lb/> influence." But for the
      meddling philanthropists, the native <lb/> fathers and mothers would be fond of seeing their
      children <lb/> carted into exile and now and then the grave, instead of <reg orig="weep-|ing"
       >weeping</reg>
      <lb/> about it and trying to kill the kind recruiters.</p>

        <author>&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Puddn'head Wilson's New Calendar.</hi></author>
       </bibl></p>
     </argument>
     <p><hi rend="small-caps">Captain</hi> Wawn is crystal-clear on one point: He <lb/> does not
      approve of missionaries. They obstruct his <lb/> business. They make "Recruiting," as he calls
      it <lb/> ("Slave-Catching," as <hi rend="italic">they</hi> call it in their frank
      way) a trouble <lb/> when it ought to be just a picnic and a pleasure excursion.
      <lb/> The missionaries have their opinion about the manner in which <lb/> the Labor Traffic is
      conducted, and about the recruiter's <lb/> evasions of the law of the Traffic, and about the
      traffic itself: <lb/> and it is distinctly uncomplimentary to the Traffic and to <lb/>
      everything connected with it, including the law for its <reg orig="regula-|tion"
      >regulation</reg>. <lb/> Captain Wawn's book is of very recent date; I have by <lb/> me a
      pamphlet of still later date&mdash;hot from the press, in fact <lb/> &mdash;by Rev.
      Wm. Gray, a missionary; and the book and the <lb/> pamphlet taken together make exceedingly
      interesting reading, <lb/> to my mind.</p>
     <p>Interesting, and easy to understand&mdash;except in one detail, <lb/> which I will
      mention presently. It is easy to understand why <lb/> the Queensland sugar planter should want
      the Kanaka recruit: <lb/> he is cheap. Very cheap, in fact. These are the figures paid <lb/>
      by the planter: &pound;20 to the recruiter for getting the Kanaka&mdash; <lb/> or
      "catching" him, as the missionary phrase goes; &pound;3 to the <lb/> Queensland
      government for "superintending" the importation; <lb/> &pound;5 deposited with the
      Government for the Kanaka's passage <lb/> home when his three years are up, in case he shall
      live that <lb/> long; about &pound;25 to the Kanaka himself for three years' wages <lb/>
      <pb n="84" entity="DSSR_000002496_0099"/> and clothing; total payment for the use of a man
      three years, <lb/> &pound;53; or, including diet, &pound;60. Altogether, a hundred
      dollars a <lb/> year. One can understand why the recruiter is fond of the <lb/> business; the
      recruit costs him a few <lb/> cheap presents (given to the <reg orig="re-|cruit's"
       >recruit's</reg>
      <lb/> relatives, not to the recruit <reg orig="him-|self)">himself)</reg>,
      <lb/> and the re-cruit is worth &pound;20 <lb/> to the recruiter <lb/> when delivered in
      <lb/> Queensland. All <lb/> this is clear enough; <lb/> but the thing that <lb/> is not clear
      is, what <lb/> there is about it all <lb/> to persuade the <reg orig="re-|cruit"
      >recruit</reg>. <lb/> He is young <lb/> and brisk; life at <lb/> home in his <reg
       orig="beauti-|ful">beautiful</reg>
      <lb/> island is one <lb/> lazy, long holiday <lb/> to him; or if he <lb/> wants to work he
      <lb/> can turn out a couple of bags of copra per week and sell it for <lb/> four or five
      shillings a bag. In Queensland he must get up <lb/> at dawn and work from eight to twelve
      hours a day in the <lb/> canefields&mdash;in a much hotter climate than he is used
      to&mdash;and <lb/> get less than four shillings a week for it.</p>

      <p>THE KANAKA'S DEPARTURE.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>I cannot understand his willingness to go to Queensland. <lb/> It is a deep puzzle to me.
      Here is the explanation, from the <lb/> planter's point of view; at least I gather from the
      missionary's <lb/> pamphlet that it is the planter's: <lb/>
      <q>"When he comes from his home he is a savage, pure and simple. He <lb/> feels no shame at
       his nakedness and want of adornment. When he returns <lb/> home he does so well dressed,
       sporting a Waterbury watch, collars, cuffs, <lb/>
       <pb n="85" entity="DSSR_000002496_0100"/> boots, and jewelry. He takes with him one or more
        boxes<ref target="n85.1" n="1">*</ref>
       <note id="n85.1" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg>

        <p>"Box" is English for trunk.</p>
       </note> well filled with <lb/> clothing, a musical instrument or two, and perfumery and other
       articles of <lb/> luxury he has learned to appreciate."</q></p>
     <figure id="f23" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002496_0100">
      <p>THE KANAKA'S RETURN.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>For just one moment we have a seeming flash of <reg orig="com-|prehension">comprehension</reg>
      <lb/> of the <lb/> Kanaka's reason for <lb/> exiling himself: he <lb/> goes away to acquire <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">civilization</hi>. Yes, he <lb/> was naked and not <lb/> ashamed, now he is
      <lb/> clothed and knows <lb/> how to be ashamed; <lb/> he was unenlightened, <lb/> now he has
      a <reg orig="water-|bury">waterbury</reg>
      <lb/> watch; he was <lb/> unrefined, now he has <lb/> jewelry, and <reg orig="some-|thing"
       >something</reg>
      <lb/> to make him <lb/> smell good; he was a <lb/> nobody, a provincial, now he has been to
      far countries and <lb/> can show off.</p>
     <p>It all looks plausible&mdash;for a moment. Then the <reg orig="mission-|ary">missionary</reg>
      <lb/> takes hold of this explanation and pulls it to pieces, and <lb/> dances on it, and
      damages it beyond recognition.</p>
     <q>"Admitting that the foregoing description is the average one, the <lb/> average sequel is
      this: The cuffs and collars, if used at all, are carried <lb/> off by youngsters, who fasten
      them round the leg, just below the <lb/> knee, as ornaments. The Waterbury, broken and dirty,
      finds its way to the <lb/> trader, who gives a trifle for it; or the inside is taken out, the
      wheels strung <lb/> on a thread and hung round the neck. Knives, axes, calico, and <reg
       orig="handker-|chiefs">handkerchiefs</reg>
      <lb/> are divided among friends, and there is hardly one of these apiece. <lb/> The boxes, the
      keys often lost on the road home, can be bought for 2s. 6d. <lb/> They are to be seen rotting
      outside in almost any shore village on Tanna. (I <lb/> speak of what I have
      seen.) A returned Kanaka has been furiously angry <lb/>
      <pb n="86" entity="DSSR_000002496_0101"/> with me because I would not buy his trousers, which
      he declared were just <lb/> my fit. He sold them afterwards to one of my Aniwan teachers for
      9d. worth <lb/> of tobacco&mdash;a pair of trousers that probably cost him 8s. or 10s. in
       <reg orig="Queens-|land">Queensland</reg>. <lb/> A coat or shirt is handy for cold weather.
      The white handkerchiefs, <lb/> the 'senet' (perfumery), the umbrella, and
      perhaps the hat, are kept. The <lb/> boots have to take their chance, if they do not happen to
      fit the copra trader. <lb/> 'Senet' on the hair, streaks of paint on the face, a dirty white
      handkerchief <lb/> round the neck, strips of turtle shell in the ears, a belt, a sheath and
      knife, <lb/> and an umbrella constitute the rig of returned Kanaka at home the day after <lb/>
      landing."</q>
     <p>A hat, an umbrella, a belt, a neckerchief. Otherwise <lb/> stark naked. All in a day the
      hard-earned "civilization" <lb/> has melted away to this. And even these perishable things
      <lb/> must presently go. Indeed, there is but a single detail of his <lb/> civilization that
      can be depended on to stay by him: according <lb/> to the missionary, he has learned to swear.
      This is art, and <lb/> art is long, as the poet says.</p>
     <p>In all countries the laws throw light upon the past. The <lb/> Queensland law for the
      regulation of the Labor Traffic is a <lb/> confession. It is a confession that the evils
      charged by the <lb/> missionaries upon the traffic had existed in the past, and that <lb/>
      they still existed when the law was made. The missionaries <lb/> make a further charge: that
      the law is evaded by the <reg orig="re-|cruiters">recruiters</reg>, <lb/> and that the
      Government Agent sometimes helps them <lb/> to do it. Regulation 31 reveals two things: that
      sometimes a <lb/> young fool of a recruit gets his senses back, after being <reg
       orig="per-|suaded">persuaded</reg>
      <lb/> to sign away his liberty for three years, and dearly <lb/> wants to get out of the
      engagement and stay at home with his <lb/> own people; and that threats, intimidation, and
      force are used <lb/> to keep him on board the recruiting-ship, and to hold him to <lb/> his
      contract. Regulation 31 forbids these coercions. The law <lb/> requires that he shall be
      allowed to go free; and another <lb/> clause of it requires the recruiter to set him
      ashore&mdash;per boat, <lb/> because of the prevalence of sharks. Testimony from Rev.
      <lb/> Mr. Gray: <lb/>
      <q>"There are 'wrinkles' for taking the penitent Kanaka. My first <reg orig="ex-|perience"
        >experience</reg>
       <lb/>
       <pb n="87" entity="DSSR_000002496_0102"/> of the Traffic was a case of this kind in 1884. A
       vessel anchored <lb/> just out of sight of our station, word was brought to me that some boys
       were <lb/> stolen, and the relatives wished me to go and get them back. The facts were, <lb/>
       as I found, that six boys had recruited, had <hi rend="italic">rushed</hi> into the boat, the
        <reg orig="Govern-|ment">Government</reg>
       <lb/> Agent informed me. They had all 'signed'; and, said the Government <lb/> Agent, 'on
       board they shall remain.' I was assured that the six boys were <lb/> of age and willing to
       go. Yet on getting ready to leave the ship I found four <lb/> of the lads ready to come
       ashore in the boat! This I forbade. One of them <lb/> jumped into the water and persisted in
       coming ashore in my boat. When <lb/> appealed to, the Government Agent suggested that we go
       and leave him to <lb/> be picked up by the ship's boat, a quarter mile distant at the
      time!"</q></p>
     <p>The law and the missionaries feel for the repentant recruit <lb/> &mdash;and properly,
      one may be permitted to think, for he is only <lb/> a youth and ignorant and persuadable to
      his hurt&mdash;but <reg orig="sym-|pathy">sympathy</reg>
      <lb/> for him is not kept in stock by the recruiter. Rev. Mr. <lb/> Gray says: <lb/>
      <q>"A captain many years in the traffic explained to me how a penitent could <lb/> be taken.
       'When a boy jumps overboard we just take a boat and pull ahead <lb/> of him, then lie between
       him and the shore. If he has not tired himself <lb/> swimming, and passes the boat, keep on
       heading him in this way. The dodge <lb/> rarely fails. The boy generally tires of swimming,
       gets into the boat of his <lb/> own accord, and goes quietly on board."</q></p>
     <p>Yes, exhaustion is likely to make a boy quiet. If the <reg orig="dis-|tressed">distressed</reg>
      <lb/> boy had been the speaker's son, and the captors savages, <lb/> the speaker would have
      been surprised to see how differently <lb/> the thing looked from the new point of view;
      however, it is <lb/> not our custom to put ourselves in the other person's place. <lb/>
      Somehow there is something pathetic about that disappointed <lb/> young savage's resignation.
      I must explain, here, that in the <lb/> traffic dialect, "boy" does not always mean boy; it
      means a <lb/> youth above sixteen years of age. That is by Queensland law <lb/> the age of
      consent, though it is held that recruiters allow <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>
      <lb/> some latitude in guessing at ages.</p>
     <p>Captain Wawn of the free spirit chafes under the <reg orig="annoy-|ance">annoyance</reg>
      <lb/> of "cast-iron regulations." They and the missionaries <lb/> have poisoned his life. He
      grieves for the good old days, <reg orig="van-|ished">vanished</reg>
      <lb/> to come no more. See him weep; hear him cuss between <lb/> the lines!</p>
     <pb n="88" entity="DSSR_000002496_0103"/>
     <q>"For a long time we were allowed to apprehend and detain all deserters <lb/> who had signed
      the agreement on board ship, but the 'cast-iron' regulations <lb/> of the Act of 1884 put a
      stop to that, allowing the Kanaka to sign the <reg orig="agree-|ment">agreement</reg>
      <lb/> for three years' service, travel about in the ship in receipt of the regular <lb/>
      rations, cadge all he could, and leave when he thought fit, so long as he did <lb/> not extend
      his pleasure trip to Queensland."</q>
     <p>Rev. Mr. Gray calls this same restrictive cast-iron law a <lb/> "farce." "There is as much
      cruelty and injustice done to <lb/> natives by acts that are legal as by deeds unlawful. The
       <reg orig="regu-|lations">regulations</reg>
      <lb/> that exist are unjust and inadequate&mdash;unjust and <reg orig="in-|adequate"
       >inadequate</reg>
      <lb/> they must ever be." He furnishes his reasons for his <lb/> position, but they are too
      long for reproduction here.</p>
     <p>However, if the most a Kanaka advantages himself by a <lb/> three-years course in
      civilization in Queensland, is a necklace <lb/> and an umbrella and a showy imperfection in
      the art of <reg orig="swear-|ing">swearing</reg>, <lb/> it must be that <hi rend="italic"
      >all</hi> the profit of the traffic goes to the white <lb/> man. This could be twisted into a
      plausible argument that the <lb/> traffic ought to be squarely abolished.</p>
     <p>However, there is reason for hope that that can be left alone <lb/> to achieve itself. It is
      claimed that the traffic will depopulate <lb/> its sources of supply within the next twenty or
      thirty years. <lb/> Queensland is a very healthy place for white <reg
       orig="people&mdash;death-|rate">people&mdash;deathrate</reg>
      <lb/> 12 in 1,000 of the population&mdash;but the Kanaka death-rate <lb/> is away above
      that. The vital statistics for 1893 place it at 52; <lb/> for 1894 (Mackay
      district), 68. The first six months of the <lb/> Kanaka's exile are peculiarly
      perilous for him because of the <lb/> rigors of the new climate. The death-rate among the new
      men <lb/> has reached as high as 180 in the 1,000. In the Kanaka's <lb/> native home his
      death-rate is 12 in time of peace, and 15 in time <lb/> of war. Thus exile to
      Queensland&mdash;with the opportunity to <lb/> acquire civilization, an umbrella, and a
      pretty poor quality of <lb/> profanity&mdash;is twelve times as deadly for him as war.
       <reg orig="Com-|mon">Common</reg>
      <lb/> Christian charity, common humanity, does seem to require, <lb/> not only that these
      people be returned to their homes, but that <lb/>
      <pb n="89" entity="DSSR_000002496_0104"/> war, pestilence, and famine be introduced among them
      for their <lb/> preservation.</p>
     <p>Concerning these Pacific isles and their peoples an eloquent <lb/> prophet spoke long years
      ago&mdash;five and fifty years ago. In <lb/> fact, he spoke a little too early. Prophecy
      is a good line of <lb/> business, but it is full of risks. This prophet was the Right <lb/>
      Rev. M. Russell, LL.D., D.C.L., of Edinburgh: <lb/>
      <q>"Is the tide of civilization to roll only to the foot of the Rocky Mountains, <lb/> and is
       the sun of knowledge to set at last in the waves of the Pacific? No; <lb/> the mighty day of
       four thousand years is drawing to its close; the sun of <lb/> humanity has performed its
       destined course; but long ere its setting rays are <lb/> extinguished in the west, its
       ascending beams have glittered on the isles of <lb/> the eastern seas. . . . And now we see
       the race of Japhet setting forth <lb/> to people the isles, and the seeds of another Europe
       and a second England <lb/> sown in the regions of the sun. But mark the words of the
       prophecy: 'He <lb/> shall dwell in the tents of Shem, and Canaan shall be his servant.' It is
       not <lb/> said Canaan shall be his <hi rend="italic">slave</hi>. To the Anglo-Saxon race is
       given the scepter of <lb/> the globe, but there is not given either the lash of the
       slave-driver or the rack <lb/> of the executioner. The East will not be stained with the same
       atrocities <lb/> as the West; the frightful gangrene of an enthralled race is not to mar the
       <lb/> destinies of the family of Japhet in the Oriental world; humanizing, not <lb/>
       destroying, as they advance; uniting with, not enslaving, the inhabitants <lb/> with whom
       they dwell, the British race may," etc., etc.</q></p>
     <p>And he closes his vision with an invocation from Thomson: <lb/>
      <q>
       <lg type="group">
        <l>"Come,bright Improvement! on the car of Time,</l>
        <l>And rule the spacious world from clime to clime."</l>
       </lg>
      </q></p>
     <p>Very well, Bright Improvement has arrived, you see, with <lb/> her civilization, and her
      Waterbury, and her umbrella, and her <lb/> third-quality profanity, and her
      humanizing-not-destroying <reg orig="ma-|chinery">machinery</reg>, <lb/> and her
      hundred-and-eighty-death-rate, and everything <lb/> is going along just as handsome!</p>
     <p>But the prophet that speaks last has an advantage over the <lb/> pioneer in the business.
      Rev. Mr. Gray says: <lb/>
      <q>"What I am concerned about is that we as a Christian nation should wipe <lb/> out these
       races to enrich ourselves."</q></p>
     <p>And he closes his pamphlet with a grim Indictment which <lb/> is as eloquent in its
      flowerless straightforward English as is the <lb/> hand-painted rhapsody of the early prophet:</p>
     <q>"My indictment of the Queensland-Kanaka Labor Traffic is this: <lb/>
      <pb n="90" entity="DSSR_000002496_0105"/>
      <list>
       <item>"1. It generally demoralizes and always impoverishes the Kanaka, <reg orig="de-|prives"
         >deprives</reg>
        <lb/> him of his citizenship, and depopulates the islands fitted to his home.</item>
       <item>"2. It is felt to lower the dignity of the white agricultural laborer in <lb/>
        Queensland, and beyond a doubt it lowers his wages there.</item>
       <item>"3. The whole system is fraught with danger to Australia and the islands <lb/> on the
        score of health.</item>
       <item>"4. On social and political grounds the continuance of the Queensland <lb/> Kanaka
        Labor Traffic must be a barrier to the true federation of the <reg orig="Aus-|tralian"
         >Australian</reg>
        <lb/> colonies.</item>
       <item>"5. The Regulations under which the Traffic exists in Queensland are <lb/> inadequate
        to prevent abuses, and in the nature of things they must <reg orig="re-|main">remain</reg>
        <lb/> so.</item>
       <item>"6. The whole system is contrary to the spirit and doctrine of the Gospel <lb/> of
        Jesus Christ. The Gospel requires us to help the weak, but the Kanaka is <lb/> fleeced and
        trodden down.</item>
       <item>"7. The bed-rock of this Traffic is that the life and liberty of a black <lb/> man are
        of less value than those of a white man. And a Traffic that has <lb/> grown out of
        'slave-hunting' will certainly remain to the end not unlike its <lb/> origin."</item>

      <lb/> among an invisible vast wilderness of islands, <lb/> catching now and then a shadowy
      glimpse of a <reg orig="mem-|ber">member</reg>
      <lb/> of it. There does seem to be a prodigious lot of islands <lb/> this year; the map of
      this region is freckled and fly-specked <lb/> all over with them. Their number would seem to
      be <reg orig="un-|countable">uncountable</reg>. <lb/> We are moving among the Fijis

      <lb/> stretches toward Australia, then curves upward to New <lb/> Guinea, and still up and up
      to Japan; behind us, to the east, <lb/> the wilderness stretches sixty degrees across the
      wastes of the <lb/> Pacific; south of us is New Zealand. Somewhere or other <lb/> among these
      myriads Samoa is concealed, and not discoverable <lb/> on the map. Still, if you wish to go
      there, you will have no <lb/> trouble about finding it if you follow the directions given by
      <lb/> Robert Louis Stevenson to Dr. Conan Doyle and to Mr. J. M. <lb/> Barrie. "You go to
      America, cross the continent to San <lb/> Francisco, and then it's the second turning to the
      left." To <lb/> get the full flavor of the joke one must take a glance at <lb/> the map.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">Wednesday, September 11</hi>.&mdash;Yesterday we passed close to
      <lb/> an island or so, and recognized the published Fiji <reg orig="character-|istics"

      back of it a graceful fringe of leaning palms, with <lb/> native huts nestling cosily among
      the shrubbery at their <lb/>
      <pb n="92" entity="DSSR_000002496_0107"/> bases; back of these a stretch of level land clothed
      in tropic <lb/> vegetation; back of that, rugged and picturesque mountains. <lb/> A detail of

     <p>In the afternoon we sighted Suva, the capital of the group, <lb/> and threaded our way into
      the secluded little harbor&mdash;a placid <lb/> basin of brilliant blue and green water
      tucked snugly in <lb/> among the sheltering hills. A few ships rode at anchor in <lb/>
      it&mdash;one of them a sailing vessel flying the American flag; <lb/>

       <p>SUVA.</p>
      </figure> and they said she came from Duluth! There's a journey! <lb/> Duluth is several
      thousand miles from the sea, and yet she <lb/> is entitled to the proud name of Mistress of
      the Commercial <lb/> Marine of the United States of America. There is only one <lb/> free,
      independent, unsubsidized American ship sailing the <reg orig="for-|eign">foreign</reg>
      <lb/> seas, and Duluth owns it. All by itself that ship is <lb/> the American fleet. All by
      itself it causes the American name <lb/> and power to be respected in the far regions of the
      globe. All <lb/> by itself it certifies to the world that the most populous <reg
       orig="civil-|ized">civilized</reg>
      <lb/> nation in the earth has a just pride in her stupendous <lb/>
      <pb n="93" entity="DSSR_000002496_0108"/> stretch of sea-front, and is determined to assert
      and maintain <lb/> her rightful place as one of the Great Maritime Powers of the <lb/> Planet.
      All by itself it is making foreign eyes familiar with a <lb/> Flag which they have not seen
      before for forty years, outside <lb/> of the museum. For what Duluth has done, in building,
      <lb/> equipping, and maintaining at her sole expense the American <lb/> Foreign Commercial
      Fleet, and in thus rescuing the American <lb/> name from shame and lifting it high for the
      homage of the <lb/> nations, we owe her a debt of gratitude which our hearts shall <lb/>
      confess with quickened beats whenever her name is named <lb/> henceforth. Many national toasts
      will die in the lapse of time, <lb/> but while the flag flies and the Republic survives, they
      who <lb/> live under their shelter will still drink this one, standing and <lb/> uncovered:

      <p>THE RIGORS OF WINTER.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>I had been suffering from colds for several months, and a <lb/> sudden change of season,
      like this, could hardly fail to do <lb/> me hurt. It brought on <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg>
      <lb/> cold. It is odd, these <lb/> sudden jumps from season to <lb/> season. A fortnight ago
      we <lb/> left America in mid-summer, <lb/> now it is mid-winter; about a <lb/> week hence we
      shall arrive <lb/> in Australia in the spring.</p>
     <p>After dinner I found in <lb/> the billiard-room a resident <lb/> whom I had known <reg
       orig="some-|where">somewhere</reg>
      <lb/> else in the world, and <lb/> presently made some new <lb/> friends and drove with them
      <lb/> out into the country to visit <lb/> his Excellency the head of the State, who was
      occupying his <lb/> country residence, to escape the rigors of the winter weather, <lb/> I
      suppose, for it was on breezy high ground and much more <lb/> comfortable than the lower
      regions, where the town is, and <lb/> where the winter has full swing, and often sets a
      person's <lb/> hair afire when he takes off his hat to bow. There is a <lb/> noble and
      beautiful view of ocean and islands and castellated <lb/> peaks from the governor's
      high-placed house, and its immediate <lb/>
      <pb n="96" entity="DSSR_000002496_0111"/> surroundings lie drowsing in that dreamy repose and
      serenity <lb/> which are the charm of life in the Pacific Islands.</p>
     <p>One of the new friends who went out there with me was <lb/> a large man, and I had been
      admiring his size all the way. I <lb/> was still admiring it as he stood by the governor on
      the <lb/> veranda, talking; then the Fijian butler stepped out there to <lb/> announce tea,
      and dwarfed him. Maybe he did not quite <lb/> dwarf him, but at any rate the contrast was
      quite striking. <lb/> Perhaps that dark giant was a king in a condition of political <lb/>
      suspension. I think that in the talk there on the veranda it <lb/> was said that in Fiji, as
      in the Sandwich Islands, native kings <lb/> and chiefs are of much grander size and build than
      the <reg orig="com-|moners">commoners</reg>. <lb/> This man was clothed in flowing white
      vestments, <lb/> and they were just the thing for him; they comported well <lb/> with his
      great stature and his kingly port and dignity. <lb/> European clothes would have degraded him
      and made him <lb/> commonplace. I know that, because they do that with <reg orig="every-|body"
       >everybody</reg>
      <lb/> that wears them.</p>
     <p>It was said that the old-time devotion to chiefs and <reg orig="rever-|ence">reverence</reg>
      <lb/> for their persons still survive in the native commoner, and <lb/> in great force. The
      educated young gentleman who is chief of <lb/> the tribe that live in the region about the
      capital dresses in the <lb/> fashion of high-class European gentlemen, but even his clothes
      <lb/> cannot damn him in the reverence of his people. Their pride <lb/> in his lofty rank and
      ancient lineage lives on, in spite of his lost <lb/> authority and the evil magic of his
      tailor. He has no need to <lb/> defile himself with work, or trouble his heart with the sordid
      <lb/> cares of life; the tribe will see to it that he shall not want, <lb/> and that he shall
      hold up his head and live like a gentleman. <lb/> I had a glimpse of him down in the town.
      Perhaps he is a <lb/> descendant of the last king&mdash;the king with the difficult name
      <lb/> whose memory is preserved by a notable monument of <reg orig="cut-|stone">cut-stone</reg>
      <lb/> which one sees in the enclosure in the middle of the town. <lb/>
      <pb n="97" entity="DSSR_000002496_0112"/> Thakombau&mdash;I remember, now; that is the
      name. It is <lb/> easier to preserve it on a granite block than in your head.</p>
     <p>Fiji was ceded to England by this king in 1858. One of the <lb/> gentlemen present at the
      governor's quoted a remark made by <lb/> the king at the time of the session&mdash;a neat
      retort, and with <lb/> a touch of pathos in it, too. The English Commissioner had <lb/>
      offered a crumb of comfort to Thakombau by saying that the <lb/> transfer of the kingdom to
      Great Britain was merely "a sort <lb/> of hermit-crab formality, you know." "Yes," said poor
      <lb/> Thakombau, "but with this difference&mdash;the crab moves into <lb/> an unoccupied
      shell, but mine isn't."</p>
     <p>However, as far as I can make out from the books, the <lb/> King was between the devil and
      the deep sea at the time, and <lb/> hadn't much choice. He owed the United States a large debt
      <lb/> &mdash;a debt which he could pay if allowed time, but time was <reg orig="de-|nied"
       >denied</reg>
      <lb/> him. He must pay up right away or the warships would <lb/> be upon him. To protect his
      people from this disaster he <lb/> ceded his country to Britain, with a clause in the contract
      <lb/> providing for the ultimate payment of the American debt.</p>
     <p>In old times the Fijians were fierce fighters; they were <lb/> very religious, and worshiped
      idols; the big chiefs were proud <lb/> and haughty, and they were men of great style in many
      ways; <lb/> all chiefs had several wives, the biggest chiefs sometimes had <lb/> as many as
      fifty; when a chief was dead and ready for burial, <lb/> four or five of his wives were
      strangled and put into the grave <lb/> with him. In 1804 twenty-seven British convicts escaped
      <lb/> from Australia to Fiji, and brought guns and ammunition with <lb/> them. Consider what a
      power they were, armed like that, and <lb/> what an opportunity they had. If they had been
      energetic <lb/> men and sober, and had had brains and known how to use them, <lb/> they could
      have achieved the sovereignty of the archipelago&mdash; <lb/> twenty-seven kings and each
      with eight or nine islands under <lb/>
      <pb n="98" entity="DSSR_000002496_0113"/> his scepter. But nothing came of this chance. They
      lived <lb/> worthless lives of sin and luxury, and died without honor&mdash;in <lb/> most
      cases by violence. Only one of them had any ambition; he <lb/> was an Irishman named Connor.
      He tried to raise a family of <lb/> fifty children, and scored forty-eight. He died lamenting
      his <lb/> failure. It was a foolish sort of avarice. Many a father would <lb/> have been rich
      enough with forty.</p>
     <p>It is a fine race, the Fijians, with brains in their heads, <lb/> and an inquiring turn of
      mind. It appears that their savage <lb/> ancestors had a doctrine of immortality in their
      scheme of <lb/> religion&mdash;with limitations. That is to say, their dead friend <lb/>
      would go to a happy hereafter if he could be accumulated, <lb/> but not otherwise. They drew
      the line; they thought that <lb/> the missionary's doctrine was too sweeping, too
      comprehensive. <lb/> They called his attention to certain facts. For instance, <lb/> many of
      their friends had been devoured by sharks; the <lb/> sharks, in their turn, were caught and
      eaten by other men; <lb/> later, these men were captured in war, and eaten by the enemy. <lb/>
      The original persons had entered into the composition of the <lb/> sharks; next, they and the
      sharks had become part of the <lb/> flesh and blood and bone of the cannibals. How, then,
      could <lb/> the particles of the original men be searched out from the <lb/> final
      conglomerate and put together again? The inquirers <lb/> were full of doubts, and considered
      that the missionary had <lb/> not examined the matter with the gravity and attention which
      <lb/> so serious a thing deserved.</p>
     <p>The missionary taught these exacting savages many <reg orig="valu-|able">valuable</reg>
      <lb/> things, and got from them one&mdash;a very dainty and poetical <lb/> idea: Those
      wild and ignorant poor children of Nature believed <lb/> that the flowers, after they perish,
      rise on the winds and float <lb/> away to the fair fields of heaven, and flourish there
      forever in <lb/> immortal beauty!</p>

     <p>WHEN one glances at the map the members of the <reg orig="stu-|pendous">stupendous</reg>
      <lb/> island wilderness of the Pacific seem to <lb/> crowd upon each other; but no, there is
      no <reg orig="crowd-|ing">crowding</reg>, <lb/> even in the center of a group; and between
      groups there <lb/> are lonely wide deserts of sea. Not everything is known <lb/> about the
      islands, their peoples and their languages. A <reg orig="start-|ling">startling</reg>
      <lb/> reminder of this is furnished by the fact that in Fiji, <lb/> twenty years ago, were
      living two strange and solitary beings <lb/> who came from an unknown country and spoke an
      unknown <lb/> language. "They were picked up by a passing vessel <hi rend="italic">many <lb/>
       hundreds of miles from any known land</hi>, floating in the same <lb/> tiny canoe in which
      they had been blown out to sea. When <lb/> found they were but skin and bone. No one could
      understand <lb/> what they said, and they have never named their country; or, <lb/> if they
      have, the name does not correspond with that of any <lb/> island on any chart. They are now
      fat and sleek, and as <lb/> happy as the day is long. In the ship's log there is an entry
      <lb/> of the latitude and longitude in which they were found, and <lb/> this is probably all
      the clue they will ever have to their lost <lb/> homes."<ref target="n99.1" n="2">*</ref>

     <p>What a strange and romantic episode it is; and how one is <lb/> tortured with curiosity to
      know whence those mysterious <lb/> creatures came, those Men Without a Country, errant waifs <lb/>
      <pb n="100" entity="DSSR_000002496_0115"/> who cannot name their lost home, wandering Children
      of <lb/> Nowhere.</p>
     <p>Indeed, the Island Wilderness is the very home of romance <lb/> and dreams and mystery. The
      loneliness, the solemnity, the <lb/> beauty, and the deep repose of this wilderness have a
      charm <lb/> which is all their own for the bruised spirit of men who have <lb/> fought and
      failed in the struggle for life in the great world; <lb/> and for men who have been hunted out
      of the great world for <lb/> crime; and for other men who love an easy and indolent <reg
       orig="ex-|istence">existence</reg>; <lb/> and for others who love a roving free life, and
      stir <lb/> and change and adventure; and for yet others who love an <lb/> easy and comfortable
      career of trading and money-getting, <lb/> mixed with plenty of loose matrimony by purchase,
      divorce <lb/> without trial or expense, and limitless spreeing thrown in to <lb/> make life
      ideally perfect.</p>
     <p>We sailed again, refreshed.</p>
     <p>The most cultivated person in the ship was a young English, <lb/> man whose home was in New
      Zealand. He was a naturalist. <lb/> His learning in his specialty was deep and thorough, his
       <reg orig="inter-|est">interest</reg>
      <lb/> in his subject amounted to a passion, he had an easy gift of <lb/> speech; and so, when
      he talked about animals it was a pleasure <lb/> to listen to him. And profitable, too, though
      he was <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg>
      <lb/> difficult to understand because now and then he used <lb/> scientific technicalities
      which were above the reach of some of <lb/> us. They were pretty sure to be above my reach,
      but as he <lb/> was quite willing to explain them I always made it a point to <lb/> get him to
      do it. I had a fair knowledge of his <reg orig="subject&mdash;lay-|man's"
       >subject&mdash;layman's</reg>
      <lb/> knowledge&mdash;to begin with, but it was his teachings <lb/> which crystalized it
      into scientific form and clarity&mdash;in a word, <lb/> gave it value.</p>
     <p>His special interest was the fauna of Australasia, and his <lb/> knowledge of the matter was
      as exhaustive as it was accurate. <lb/> I already knew a good deal about the rabbits in
      Australasia <lb/>
      <pb n="101" entity="DSSR_000002496_0116"/> and their marvelous fecundity, but in my talks with
      him I <lb/> found that my estimate of the great hindrance and obstruction <lb/> inflicted by
      the rabbit pest upon traffic and travel was far <lb/> short of the facts. He told me that the
      first pair of rabbits <lb/> imported into Australasia bred so wonderfully that within six
      <lb/> months rabbits were so thick in the land that people had to <lb/> dig trenches through
      them to get from town to town.</p>
     <p>He told me a great deal about worms, and the kangaroo, <lb/> and other coleoptera, and said
      he knew the history and ways <lb/> of all such pachydermata. He said the kangaroo had pockets,
      <lb/> and carried its young in them when it couldn't get apples. <lb/> And he said that the
      emu was as big as an ostrich, and looked <lb/> like one, and had an amorphous appetite and
      would eat bricks. <lb/> Also, that the dingo was not a dingo at all, but just a wild <lb/>
      dog; and that the only difference between a dingo and a dodo <lb/> was that neither of them
      barked; otherwise they were just <lb/> the same.</p>
     <p>He said that the only game-bird in Australia was the <reg orig="wom-|bat">wombat</reg>,
      <lb/> and the only song-bird the larrikin, and that both were <lb/> protected by government.
      The most beautiful of the native <lb/> birds was the bird of Paradise. Next came the two kinds
      of <lb/> lyres; not spelt the same. He said the one kind was dying <lb/> out, the other
      thickening up. He explained that the "<reg orig="Sun-|downer">Sundowner</reg>" <lb/> was not a
      bird, it was a man; sundowner was <lb/> merely the Australian equivalent of our word, tramp.
      He is <lb/> a loafer, a hard drinker, and a sponge. He tramps across the <lb/> country in the
      sheep-shearing season, pretending to look for <lb/> work; but he always times himself to
      arrive at a sheep-run <lb/> just at sundown, when the day's labor ends; all he wants is <lb/>
      whisky and supper and bed and breakfast; he gets them and <lb/> then disappears. The
      naturalist spoke of the bell bird, the <lb/> creature that at short intervals all day rings
      out its mellow and <lb/> exquisite peal from the deeps of the forest. It is the favorite <lb/>
      <pb n="102" entity="DSSR_000002496_0117"/> and best friend of the weary and thirsty sundowner;
      for he <lb/> knows that wherever the bell bird is, there is water; and he <lb/> goes somewhere
      else. The naturalist said that the oddest bird <lb/> in Australasia was the Laughing Jackass,
      and the biggest the <lb/> now extinct Great Moa.</p>
     <p>The Moa stood thirteen feet high, and could step over an <lb/> ordinary man's head or kick
      his hat off; and his head, too, for <lb/> that matter. He said it was wingless, but a swift
      runner. <lb/> The natives used to ride it. It could make forty miles an <lb/> hour, and keep
      it up for four hundred miles and come out <lb/> reasonably fresh. It was still in existence
      when the railway <lb/> was introduced into New Zealand; still in existence, and <lb/> carrying
      the mails. The railroad began with the same schedule <lb/> it has now: two expresses a
      week&mdash;time, twenty miles an <lb/> hour. The company exterminated the moa to get the
      mails.</p>
     <p>Speaking of the indigenous coneys and bactrian camels, the <lb/> naturalist said that the
      coniferous and bacteriological output of <lb/> Australasia was remarkable for its many and
      curious <reg orig="depart-|ures">departures</reg>
      <lb/> from the accepted laws governing these species of <reg orig="tuber-|cles"
      >tubercles</reg>, <lb/> but that in his opinion Nature's fondness for dabbling in <lb/> the
      erratic was most notably exhibited in that curious <reg orig="combina-|tion">combination</reg>
      <lb/> of bird, fish, amphibian, burrower, crawler, quadruped, and <lb/> Christian called the
      Ornithorhyncus&mdash;grotesquest of animals, <lb/> king of the animalcul&aelig; of
      the world for versatility of character <lb/> and make-up. Said he&mdash;</p>
     <p>"You can call it anything you want to, and be right. It is a fish, for it <lb/> lives in the
      river half the time; it is a land animal, for it resides on the land <lb/> half the time; it
      is an amphibian, since it likes both and does not know which <lb/> it prefers; it is a
      hybernian, for when times are dull and nothing much going <lb/> on it buries itself under the
      mud at the bottom of a puddle and hybernates <lb/> there a couple of weeks at a time; it is a
      kind of duck, for it has a duck-bill <lb/> and four webbed paddles; it is a fish and quadruped
      together, for in the <lb/> water it swims with the paddles and on shore it paws itself across
      country with <lb/> them; it is a kind of seal, for it has a seal's fur; it is carnivorous,
      herbivorous, <lb/> insectivorous, and vermifuginous, for it eats fish and grass and
      butterflies, <lb/> and in the season digs worms out of the mud and devours them; it is clearly <lb/>

      <p>WAS NEVER IN THE ARK.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>"It is a survival&mdash;a <lb/> survival of the fittest. <lb/> Mr. Darwin invented the
      <lb/> theory that goes by that <lb/> name, but the <reg orig="Ornitho-|rhyncus">Ornithorhyncus</reg>
      <lb/> was the first to <lb/> put it to actual <reg orig="experi-|ment">experiment</reg>
      <lb/> and prove that it <lb/> could be done. Hence it <lb/> should have as much of <lb/> the
      credit as Mr. Darwin <lb/> It was never in the Ark; <lb/> you will find no mention <lb/> of it
      there; it nobly <lb/> stayed out and worked the <lb/> theory. Of all creatures <lb/> in the
      world it was the <lb/> only one properly <reg orig="equip-|ped">equipped</reg>
      <lb/> for the test. The <lb/> Ark was thirteen months <lb/> afloat, and all the globe <lb/>
      submerged; no land <reg orig="visi-|ble">visible</reg>
      <lb/> above the flood, no <lb/> vegetation, no food for a <lb/> mammal to eat, nor water <lb/>
      for a mammal to drink; <lb/> for all mammal food was <lb/> destroyed, and when the <lb/> pure
      floods from heaven <lb/> and the salt oceans of the <lb/> earth mingled their waters <lb/> and
      rose above the <reg orig="moun-|tain">mountain</reg>
      <lb/> tops, the result was <lb/> a drink which no bird or <lb/>
      <pb n="106" entity="DSSR_000002496_0121"/> beast of ordinary construction could use and live.
      But this combination was <lb/> nuts for the Ornithorhyncus, if I may use a term like that
      without offense. Its <lb/> river home had always been salted by the flood-tides of the sea. On
      the face of <lb/> the Noachian deluge innumerable forest trees were floating. Upon these the
      <lb/> Ornithorhyncus voyaged in peace; voyaged from clime to clime, from <reg
       orig="hemis-|phere">hemisphere</reg>
      <lb/> to hemisphere, in contentment and comfort, in virile interest in the <reg
       orig="con-|stant">constant</reg>
      <lb/> change of scene, in humble thankfulness for its privileges, in <reg
       orig="ever-in-|creasing">ever-increasing</reg>
      <lb/> enthusiam in the development of the great theory upon whose <lb/> validity it had staked
      its life, its fortunes, and its sacred honor, if I may use <lb/> such expressions without
      impropriety in connection with an episode of this <lb/> nature.</p>
     <p>"It lived the tranquil and luxurious life of a creature of independent <lb/> means. Of
      things actually necessary to its existence and its happiness not a <lb/> detail was wanting.
      When it wished to walk, it scrambled along the <reg orig="tree-|trunk">tree-trunk</reg>; <lb/>
      it mused in the shade of the leaves by day, it slept in their shelter by <lb/> night; when it
      wanted the refreshment of a swim, it had it; it ate leaves <lb/> when it wanted a vegetable
      diet, it dug under the bark for worms and grubs; <lb/> when it wanted fish it caught them,
      when it wanted eggs it laid them. If the <lb/> grubs gave out in one tree it swam to another;
      and as for fish, the very opu <lb/> lence of the supply was an embarrassment. And finally,
      when it was thirsty it <lb/> smacked its chops in gratitude over a blend that would have slain
      a crocodile.</p>
     <p>"When at last, after thirteen months of travel and research in all the <lb/> Zones it went
      aground on a mountain-summit, it strode ashore, saying in its <lb/> heart, 'Let them that come
      after me invent theories and dream dreams about <lb/> the Survival of the Fittest if they
      like, but I am the first that has <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it! </p>
     <p>"This wonderful creature dates back like the kangaroo and many other <lb/> Australian
      hydrocephalous invertebrates, to an age long anterior to the advent <lb/> of man upon the
      earth; they date back, indeed, to a time when a causeway <lb/> hundreds of miles wide, and
      thousands of miles long, joined Australia to <lb/> Africa, and the animals of the two
      countries were alike, and all belonged to <lb/> that remote geological epoch known to science
      as the Old Red Grindstone <lb/> Post-Pleosaurian. Later the causeway sank under the sea;
      subterranean <reg orig="con-|vulsions">convulsions</reg>
      <lb/> lifted the African continent a thousand feet higher than it was before, <lb/> but
      Australia kept her old level. In Africa's new climate the animals <reg orig="neces-|sarily"
       >necessarily</reg>
      <lb/> began to develop and shade off into new forms and families and species, <lb/> but the
      animals of Australia as necessarily remained stationary, and have so <lb/> remained until this
      day. In the course of some millions of years the African <lb/> Ornithorhyncus developed and
      developed and developed, and sluffed off <lb/> detail after detail of its make-up until at
      last the creature became wholly <reg orig="dis-|integrated">disintegrated</reg>
      <lb/> and scattered. Whenever you see a bird or a beast or a seal or an <lb/> otter in Africa
      you know that he is merely a sorry surviving fragment of that <lb/> sublime original of whom I
      have been speaking&mdash;that creature which was <lb/> everything in general and nothing

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">Sept.</hi> 15&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Night.</hi> Close to
      Australia now. Sydney 50 <lb/> miles distant.</p>
     <p>That note recalls an experience. The passengers <lb/> were sent for, to come up in the bow
      and see a fine sight. It <lb/> was very dark. One could not follow with the eye the surface
      <lb/> of the sea more than fifty yards in any direction&mdash;it dimmed <lb/> away and
      became lost to sight at about that distance from us. <lb/> But if you patiently gazed into the
      darkness a little while, <lb/> there was a sure reward for you. Presently, a quarter of a
      <lb/> mile away you would see a blinding splash or explosion of <lb/> light on the
      water&mdash;a flash so sudden and so astonishingly <reg orig="bril-|liant">brilliant</reg>
      <lb/> that it would make you catch your breath; then that <lb/> blotch of light would
      instantly extend itself and take the <reg orig="cork-|screw">corkscrew</reg>
      <lb/> shape and imposing length of the fabled sea-serpent, <lb/> with every curve of its body
      and the "break" spreading away <lb/> from its head, and the wake following behind its tail
      clothed <lb/> in a fierce splendor of living fire. And my, but it was coming <lb/> at a
      lightning gait! Almost before you could think, this <reg orig="mon-|ster">monster</reg>
      <lb/> of light, fifty feet long, would go flaming and storming <lb/> by, and suddenly
      disappear. And out in the distance whence <lb/> he came you would see another flash; and
      another and <lb/> another and another, and see them turn into sea-serpents on <lb/> the
      instant; and once sixteen flashed up at the same time and <lb/> came tearing towards us, a
      swarm of wiggling curves, a <reg orig="mov-|ing">moving</reg>
      <lb/> conflagration, a vision of bewildering beauty, a spectacle <lb/>
      <pb n="110" entity="DSSR_000002496_0125"/> of fire and energy whose equal the most of those
      people will <lb/> not see again until after they are dead.</p>
     <p>It was porpoises&mdash;porpoises aglow with phosphorescent <lb/> light. They presently
      collected in a wild and magnificent <lb/> jumble under the bows, and there they played for an
      hour, <lb/> leaping and frollicking and carrying on, turning summersaults <lb/> in front of
      the stem or across it and never getting hit, never <lb/> making a miscalculation, though the
      stem missed them only <lb/> about an inch, as a rule. They were porpoises of the ordinary
      <lb/> length&mdash;eight or ten feet&mdash;but every twist of their bodies <lb/>
      sent a long procession of united and glowing curves astern. <lb/> That fiery jumble was an
      enchanting thing to look at, and we <lb/> stayed out the performance; one cannot have such a
      show as <lb/> that twice in a lifetime. The porpoise is the kitten of the <lb/> sea; he never
      has a serious thought, he cares for nothing but <lb/> fun and play. But I think I never saw
      him at his winsomest <lb/> until that night. It was near a center of civilization, and he
      <lb/> could have been drinking.</p>
     <p>By and by, when we had approached to somewhere within <lb/> thirty miles of Sydney Heads the
      great electric light that is <lb/> posted on one of those lofty ramparts began to show, and in
      <lb/> time the little spark grew to a great sun and pierced the <reg orig="firm-|ament"
       >firmament</reg>
      <lb/> of darkness with a far-reaching sword of light.</p>
     <p>Sydney Harbor is shut in behind a precipice that extends <lb/> some miles like a wall, and
      exhibits no break to the ignorant <lb/> stranger. It has a break in the middle, but it makes
      so little <lb/> show that even Captain Cook sailed by it without seeing it. <lb/> Near by that
      break is a false break which resembles it, and <lb/> which used to make trouble for the
      mariner at night, in the <lb/> early days before the place was lighted. It caused the <reg
       orig="memo-|rable">memorable</reg>
      <lb/> disaster to the <hi rend="italic">Duncan Dunbar</hi>, one of the most pathetic <lb/>
      tragedies in the history of that pitiless ruffian, the sea. The <lb/> ship was a sailing
      vessel; a fine and favorite passenger packet, <lb/>
      <pb n="111" entity="DSSR_000002496_0126"/> commanded by a popular captain of high reputation.
      She was <lb/> due from England, and Sydney was waiting, and counting the <lb/> hours; counting
      the hours, and making ready to give her a <lb/> heart-stirring welcome; for she was bringing
      back a great <lb/> company of mothers and daughters, the long-missed light and <lb/> bloom of
      life of Sydney homes; daughters that had been <lb/> years absent at school, and mothers that
      had been with them <lb/> all that time watching over them. Of all the world only India <lb/>
      and Australasia have by custom freighted ships and fleets with <lb/> their hearts, and know
      the tremendous meaning of that <lb/> phrase; only they know what the waiting is like when this
      <lb/> freightage is entrusted to the fickle winds, not steam, and <lb/> what the joy is like
      when the ship that is returning this <reg orig="treas-|ure">treasure</reg>
      <lb/> comes safe to port and the long dread is over.</p>
     <p>On board the <hi rend="italic">Duncan Dunbar</hi>, flying toward Sydney Heads <lb/> in the
      waning afternoon, the happy home-comers made busy <lb/> preparation, for it was not doubted
      that they would be in the <lb/> arms of their friends before the day was done; they put away
      <lb/> their sea-going clothes and put on clothes meeter for the <reg orig="meet-|ing"
      >meeting</reg>, <lb/> their richest and their loveliest, these poor brides of the <lb/> grave.
      But the wind lost force, or there was a miscalculation, <lb/> and before the Heads were
      sighted the darkness came on. It <lb/> was said that ordinarily the captain would have made a
      safe <lb/> offing and waited for the morning; but this was no ordinary <lb/> occasion; all
      about him were appealing faces, faces pathetic <lb/> with disappointment. So his sympathy
      moved him to try the <lb/> dangerous passage in the dark. He had entered the Heads <lb/>
      seventeen times, and believed he knew the ground. So he <lb/> steered straight for the false
      opening, mistaking it for the true <lb/> one. He did not find out that he was wrong until it
      was too <lb/> late. There was no saving the ship. The great seas swept <lb/> her in and
      crushed her to splinters and rubbish upon the rock <lb/> tushes at the base of the precipice.
      Not one of all that fair <lb/>
      <pb n="112" entity="DSSR_000002496_0127"/> and gracious company was ever seen again alive. The
      tale <lb/> is told to every stranger that passes the spot, and it will <reg orig="con-|tinue"
       >continue</reg>
      <lb/> to be told to all that come, for generations; but it will <lb/> never grow old, custom
      cannot stale it, the heart-break that <lb/> is in it can never perish out of it.</p>
     <p>There were two hundred persons in the ship, and but one <lb/> survived the disaster. He was
      a sailor. A huge sea flung him <lb/> up the face of the precipice and stretched him on a
      narrow <lb/> shelf of rock midway between the top and the bottom, and <lb/> there he lay all
      night. At any other time he would have lain <lb/> there for the rest of his life, without
      chance of discovery; but <lb/> the next morning the ghastly news swept through Sydney that
      <lb/> the <hi rend="italic">Duncan Dunbar</hi> had gone down in sight of home, and <lb/>
      straightway the walls of the Heads were black with mourners; <lb/> and one of these,
      stretching himself out over the precipice to <lb/> spy out what might be seen below,
      discovered this miraculously <lb/> preserved relic of the wreck. Ropes were brought and the
      <lb/> nearly impossible feat of rescuing the man was accomplished. <lb/> He was a person with
      a practical turn of mind, and he hired a <lb/> hall in Sydney and exhibited himself at
      sixpence a head till he <lb/> exhausted the output of the gold fields for that year.</p>
     <p>We entered and cast anchor, and in the morning went <lb/> oh-ing and ah-ing in admiration up
      through the crooks and <lb/> turns of the spacious and beautiful harbor&mdash;a harbor
      which <lb/> is the darling of Sydney and the wonder of the world. <lb/> It is not surprising
      that the people are proud of it, nor that <lb/> they put their enthusiasm into eloquent words.
      A returning <lb/> citizen asked me what I thought of it, and I testified with <lb/> a
      cordiality which I judged would be up to the market rate. <lb/> I said it was
      beautiful&mdash;superbly beautiful. Then by a <lb/> natural impulse I gave God the
      praise. The citizen did not <lb/> seem altogether satisfied. He said:</p>
     <p>"It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> beautiful, of course it's beautiful&mdash;the Harbor; <lb/>
      <pb n="113" entity="DSSR_000002496_0128"/> but that isn't all of it, it's only half of it;
      Sydney's the <lb/> other half, and it takes both of them together to ring the <lb/>
      supremacy-bell. God made the Harbor, and that's all right; <lb/> but Satan made Sydney."</p>
     <p>Of course I made an apology; and asked him to convey <lb/> it to his friend. He was right
      about Sydney being half <lb/> of it. It would be beautiful without Sydney, but not above <lb/>
      half as beautiful as it is now, with Sydney added. It is shaped <lb/> somewhat like an
      oak-leaf&mdash;a roomy sheet of lovely blue <lb/> water, with narrow off-shoots of water
      running up into the <lb/> country on both sides between long fingers of land, high <lb/>
      wooden ridges with sides sloped like graves. Handsome <lb/> villas are perched here and there
      on these ridges, snuggling <lb/> amongst the foliage, and one catches alluring glimpses of
      them <lb/> as the ship swims by toward the city. The city clothes a cluster <lb/> of hills and
      a ruffle of neighboring ridges with its undulating <lb/> masses of masonry, and out of these
      masses spring towers <lb/> and spires and <lb/> other <reg orig="archi-|tectural"
       >architectural</reg>
      <lb/>
      <reg orig="digni-|ties">dignities</reg>

      <reg orig="picturesque-|ness">picturesqueness</reg>
      <lb/> to the <lb/> general effect.</p>

     <p>The narrow <lb/> inlets which I <lb/> have <reg orig="men-|tioned">mentioned</reg>
      <lb/> go wandering out into the land everywhere and hiding <lb/> themselves in it, and
      pleasure-launches are always exploring <lb/>
      <pb n="114" entity="DSSR_000002496_0129"/> them with picnic parties on board. It is said by
      trustworthy <lb/> people that if you explore them all you will find that you <lb/> have
      covered 700 miles of water passage. But there are liars <lb/> everywhere this year, and they
      will double that when their <lb/> works are in good going order.</p>
     <p>October was close at hand, spring was come. It was really <lb/> spring&mdash;everybody
      said so; but you could have sold it for <lb/> summer in Canada, and nobody would have
      suspected. It was <lb/> the very weather that makes our home summers the perfection <lb/> of
      climatic luxury; I mean, when you are out in the wood or <lb/> by the sea. But these people
      said it was cool, now&mdash;a person <lb/> ought to see Sydney in the summer time if he
      wanted to know <lb/> what warm weather is; and he ought to go north ten or fifteen <lb/>
      hundred miles if he wanted to know what hot weather is. <lb/> They said that away up there
      toward the equator the hens <lb/> laid fried eggs. Sydney is the place to go to get
      information <lb/> about other people's climates. It seems to me that the <reg
       orig="occupa-|tion">occupation</reg>
      <lb/> of Unbiased Traveler Seeking Information is the <reg orig="pleas-|antest">pleasantest</reg>
      <lb/> and most irresponsible trade there is. The traveler can <lb/> always find out anything
      he wants to, merely by asking. He <lb/> can get at all the facts, and more. Everybody helps
      him, <reg orig="no-|body">nobody</reg>
      <lb/> hinders him. Anybody who has an old fact in stock that <lb/> is no longer negotiable in
      the domestic market will let him <lb/> have it at his own price. An accumulation of such goods
      is <lb/> easily and quickly made. They cost almost nothing and they <lb/> bring par in the
      foreign market. Travelers who come to <lb/> America always freight up with the same old
      nursery tales <lb/> that their predecessors selected, and they carry them back and <lb/>
      always work them off without any trouble in the home market.</p>
     <p>If the climates of the world were determined by parallels <lb/> of latitude, then we could
      know a place's climate by its <reg orig="posi-|tion">position</reg>
      <lb/> on the map; and so we should know that the climate of <lb/> Sydney was the counterpart
      of the climate of Columbia, S. C., <lb/>
      <pb n="115" entity="DSSR_000002496_0130"/> and of Little Rock, Arkansas, since Sydney is about
      the same <lb/> distance south of the equator that those other towns are north <lb/> of
      it&mdash;thirty-four degrees. But no, climate disregards the <lb/> parallels of latitude.
      In Arkansas they have a winter; in <lb/> Sydney they have the name of it, but not the thing
      itself. I <lb/> have seen the ice in the Mississippi floating past the mouth of <lb/> the
      Arkansas river; and at Memphis, but a little way above, <lb/> the Mississippi has been frozen
      over, from bank to bank. But <lb/> they have never had a cold spell in Sydney which brought
      the <lb/> mercury down to freezing point. Once in a mid-winter day <lb/> there, in the month
      of July, the mercury went down to 36&deg;, <lb/> and that remains the memorable "cold
      day" in the history of <lb/> the town. No doubt Little Rock has seen it below zero. Once,
      <lb/> in Sydney, in mid-summer, about New Year's Day, the <reg orig="mer-|cury">mercury</reg>
      <lb/> went up to 106&deg;in the shade, and that is Sydney's <reg orig="memo-|rable"
       >memorable</reg>
      <lb/> hot day. That would about tally with Little Rock's <lb/> hottest day also, I imagine. My
      Sydney figures are taken <lb/> from a government report, and are trustworthy. In the <reg
       orig="mat-|ter">matter</reg>
      <lb/> of summer weather Arkansas has no advantage over <reg orig="Syd-|ney">Sydney</reg>,
      <lb/> perhaps, but when it comes to winter weather, that is <lb/> another affair. You could
      cut up an Arkansas winter into a <lb/> hundred Sydney winters and have enough left for
      Arkansas <lb/> and the poor.</p>
     <p>The whole narrow, hilly belt of the Pacific side of New <lb/> South Wales has the climate of
      its capital&mdash;a mean winter <reg orig="tem-|perature">temperature</reg>
      <lb/> of 54&deg;and a mean summer one of 71&deg;. It is a climate <lb/> which
      cannot be improved upon for healthfulness. But the <lb/> experts say that 90&deg;in New
      South Wales is harder to bear <lb/> than 112&deg;in the neighboring colony of Victoria,
      because the <lb/> atmosphere of the former is humid, and of the latter dry.</p>
     <p>The mean temperature of the southernmost point of New <lb/> South Wales is the same as that
      of Nice&mdash;60&deg;&mdash;yet Nice is <lb/> further from the equator by 460
      miles than is the former.</p>
     <pb n="116" entity="DSSR_000002496_0131"/>
     <p>But Nature is always stingy of perfect climates; stingier <lb/> in the case of Australia
      than usual. Apparently this vast <lb/> continent has a really good climate nowhere but around
      the <lb/> edges.</p>
     <p>If we look at a map of the world we are surprised to see <lb/> how big Australia is. It is
      about two-thirds as large as the <lb/> United States was before we added Alaska.</p>
     <p>But where as one finds a sufficiently good climate and <reg orig="fer-|tile">fertile</reg>
      <lb/> land almost everywhere in the United States, it seems <reg orig="set-|tled">settled</reg>
      <lb/> that inside of the Australian border-belt one finds many <lb/> deserts and in spots a
      climate which nothing can stand except a <lb/> few of the hardier kinds of rocks. In effect,
      Australia is as <lb/> yet unoccupied. If you take a map of the United States and <lb/> leave
      the Atlantic sea-board States in their places; also the <lb/> fringe of Southern States from
      Florida west to the Mouth of <lb/> the Mississippi; also a narrow, inhabited streak up the
       <reg orig="Mis-|sissippi">Mississippi</reg>
      <lb/> half-way to its head waters; also a narrow, inhabited <lb/> border along the Pacific
      coast: then take a brushful of paint <lb/> and obliterate the whole remaining mighty stretch
      of country <lb/> that lies between the Atlantic States and the Pacific-coast <lb/> strip, your
      map will look like the latest map of Australia.</p>
     <figure id="f35" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002496_0131"/>
     <p>This stupendous blank is hot, not to say torrid; a part of it <lb/> is fertile, the rest is
      desert; it is not liberally watered; it has <lb/> no towns. One has only to cross the
      mountains of New South <lb/> Wales and descend into the westward-lying regions to find <lb/>
      that he has left the choice climate behind him, and found a <lb/>
      <pb n="117" entity="DSSR_000002496_0132"/> new one of a quite different character. In fact, he
      would not <lb/> know by the thermometer that he was not in the blistering <lb/> Plains of
      India. Captain Sturt, the great explorer, gives us a <lb/> sample of the heat.</p>
     <p>"The wind, which had been blowing all the morning from the N.E., <reg orig="in-|creased"
       >increased</reg>
      <lb/> to a heavy gale, and I shall never forget its withering effect. I <lb/> sought shelter
      behind a large gum-tree, but the blasts of heat were so terrific <lb/> that I wondered <hi
       rend="italic">the very grass did not take fire</hi>. This really was nothing ideal: <lb/>
      everything both animate and inanimate gave way before it; the horses stood <lb/> with their
      backs to the wind and their noses to the ground, without the <reg orig="mus-|cular">muscular</reg>
      <lb/> strength to raise their heads; the birds were mute, and the leaves of the <lb/> trees
      under which we were sitting <hi rend="italic">fell like a snow shower around us</hi>. At noon
      <lb/> I took a thermometer graded to 127&deg;, out of my box, and observed that the
      <lb/> mercury was up to 125&deg;. Thinking that it had been unduly influenced, I put
      <lb/> it in the fork of a tree close to me, sheltered alike from the wind and the sun. <lb/> I
      went to examine it about an hour afterwards, when I found the mercury <lb/> had risen to the
      top of the instrument and had <hi rend="italic">burst the bulb</hi>, a circumstance <lb/> that
      I believe no traveler has ever before had to record. I cannot find <reg orig="lan-|guage"
       >language</reg>
      <lb/> to convey to the reader's mind an idea of the intense and oppressive <lb/> nature of the
      heat that prevailed."</p>
     <p>That hot wind sweeps over Sydney sometimes, and brings <lb/> with it what is called a
      "dust-storm." It is said that most <lb/> Australian towns are acquainted with the dust-storm.
      I think I <lb/> know what it is like, for the following description by Mr. Gane <lb/> tallies
      very well with the alkali dust-storm of Nevada, if you <lb/> leave out the "shovel" part.
      Still the shovel part is a pretty <lb/> important part, and seems to indicate that my Nevada
      storm <lb/> is but a poor thing, after all.</p>
     <p>"As we proceeded the altitude became less, and the heat proportionately <lb/> greater until
      we reached Dubbo, which is only 600 feet above sea-level. It is <lb/> a pretty town, built on
      an extensive plain. &hellip; After the effects of a <lb/> shower of rain have passed away
      the surface of the ground crumbles into a <lb/> thick layer of dust, and occasionally, when
      the wind is in a particular quarter, <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">it is lifted bodily from the ground in one long opaque cloud</hi>. In the
      midst of such <lb/> a storm nothing can be seen a few yards ahead, and the unlucky person who
      <lb/> happens to be out at the time is compelled to seek the nearest retreat at hand <lb/>
      When the thrifty housewife sees in the distance the dark column advancing in <lb/> a steady
      whirl towards her house, she closes the doors and windows with all <lb/> expedition. A
      drawing-room, the window of which has been carelessly left <lb/> open during a dust-storm, is
      indeed an extraordinary sight. A lady who has <lb/> resided in Dubbo for some years says that
      the dust lies so thick on the carpet <lb/> that it is necessary to use a shovel to remove it."</p>
     <pb n="118" entity="DSSR_000002496_0133"/>
     <p>And probably a wagon. I was mistaken; I have not seen <lb/> a proper dust-storm. To my mind
      the exterior aspects and <lb/> character of Australia are fascinating things to look at and
      <lb/> think about, they are so strange, so weird, so new, so <reg orig="uncom-|monplace"
       >uncommonplace</reg>, <lb/> such a startling and interesting contrast to the other <lb/>
      sections of the planet, the sections that are known to us all, <lb/> familiar to us all. In
      the matter of particulars&mdash;a detail here, <lb/> a detail there&mdash;we have
      had the choice climate of New South <lb/> Wales' sea-coast; we have had the Australian heat as
      furnished <lb/> by Captain Sturt; we have had the wonderful dust-storm; and <lb/> we have
      considered the phenomenon of an almost empty hot <lb/> wilderness half as big as the United
      States, with a narrow belt <lb/> of civilization, population, and good climate around it.</p>

     </p>
     <p>English law was hard-hearted in those days. For trifling <lb/> offenses which in our day
      would be punished by a small fine or <lb/> a few days' confinement, men, women, and boys were
      sent to <lb/> this other end of the earth to serve terms of seven and fourteen <lb/> years;
      and for serious crimes they were transported for life. <lb/> Children were sent to the penal
      colonies for seven years for <lb/> stealing a rabbit!</p>
     <p>When I was in London twenty-three years ago there was <lb/> a new penalty in force for
      diminishing garroting and <reg orig="wife-|beating&mdash;25">wifebeating&mdash;25</reg>
      <lb/> lashes on the bare back with the cat-o'-nine-tails. <lb/> It was said that this terrible
      punishment was able to bring the <lb/> stubbornest ruffians to terms; and that no man had been
      found <lb/> with grit enough to keep his emotions to himself beyond the <lb/> ninth blow; as a
      rule the man shrieked earlier. That penalty <lb/> had a great and wholesome effect upon the
      garroters and <reg orig="wife-|beaters">wife-beaters</reg>; <lb/> but humane modern London
      could not endure it; it <lb/>
      <pb n="120" entity="DSSR_000002496_0135"/> got its law rescinded. Many a bruised and battered
      English <lb/> wife has since had occasion to deplore that cruel achievement <lb/> of
      sentimental "humanity."</p>
     <p>Twenty-five lashes! In Australia and Tasmania they gave <lb/> a convict fifty for almost any
      little offense; and sometimes <lb/> a brutal officer would add fifty, and then another fifty,
      and so <lb/> on, as long as the sufferer could endure the torture and live. <lb/> In Tasmania
      I read the entry, in an old manuscript official <lb/> record, of a case where a convict was
      given <hi rend="italic">three hundred</hi>
      <lb/> lashes&mdash;for stealing some silver spoons. And men got more <lb/> than that,
      sometimes. Who handled the cat? Often it was <lb/> another convict; sometimes it was the
      culprit's dearest <reg orig="com-|rade">comrade</reg>; <lb/> and he had to lay on with all his
      might; otherwise he <lb/> would get a flogging himself for his mercy&mdash;for he was
      under <lb/> watch&mdash;and yet not do his friend any good: the friend would <lb/> be
      attended to by another hand and suffer no lack in the <lb/> matter of full punishment.</p>
     <p>The convict life in Tasmania was so unendurable, and <reg orig="sui-|cide">suicide</reg>
      <lb/> so difficult to accomplish that once or twice despairing <lb/> men got together and drew
      straws to determine which of them <lb/> should kill another of the group&mdash;this
      murder to secure death <lb/> to the perpetrator and to the witnesses of it by the hand of the
      <lb/> hangman!</p>
     <p>The incidents quoted above are mere hints, mere <reg orig="sugges-|tions">suggestions</reg>
      <lb/> of what convict life was like&mdash;they are but a couple of <lb/> details tossed
      into view out of a shoreless sea of such; or, to <lb/> change the figure, they are but a pair
      of flaming steeples <lb/> photographed from a point which hides from sight the burning <lb/>
      city which stretches away from their bases on every hand. <lb/> Some of the
      convicts&mdash;indeed, a good many of them&mdash; <lb/> were very bad people, even
      for that day; but the most of them <lb/> were probably not noticeably worse than the average
      of the <lb/> people they left behind them at home. We must believe this; <lb/>
      <pb n="121" entity="DSSR_000002496_0136"/> we cannot avoid it. We are obliged to believe that
      a nation <lb/> that could look on, unmoved, and see starving or freezing <lb/> women hanged
      for stealing twenty-six cents' worth of bacon or <lb/> rags, and boys snatched from their
      mothers, and men from <lb/> their families, and sent to the other side of the world for long
      <lb/> terms of years for similar trifling offenses, was a nation to <lb/> whom the term
      "civilized" could not in any large way be <reg orig="ap-|plied">applied</reg>. <lb/> And we
      must also believe that a nation that knew, <reg orig="dur-|ing">during</reg>
      <lb/> more than forty years, what was happening to those exiles <lb/> and was still content
      with it, was not advancing in any showy <lb/> way toward a higher grade of civilization.</p>
     <p>If we look into the characters and conduct of the officers <lb/> and gentlemen who had
      charge of the convicts and attended <lb/> to their backs and stomachs, we must grant again
      that as <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg>
      <lb/> the convict and his masters, and between both and <lb/> the nation at home, there was a
      quite noticeable monotony of <lb/> sameness.</p>
     <p>Four years had gone by, and many convicts had come. <lb/> Respectable settlers were
      beginning to arrive. These two <lb/> classes of colonists had to be protected, in case of
      trouble <lb/> among themselves or with the natives. It is proper to mention <lb/> the natives,
      though they could hardly count they were so <lb/> scarce. At a time when they had not as yet
      begun to be much <lb/> disturbed&mdash;not as yet being in the way&mdash;it was
      estimated <lb/> that in New South Wales there was but one native to 45,000 <lb/> acres of
      territory.</p>
     <p>People had to be protected. Officers of the regular army <lb/> did not want this
      service&mdash;away off there where neither honor <lb/> nor distinction was to be gained.
      So England recruited and <lb/> officered a kind of militia force of 1,000 uniformed civilians
      <lb/> called the "New South Wales Corps" and shipped it.</p>
     <p>This was the worst blow of all. The colony fairly staggered <lb/> under it. The Corps was an
      object-lesson of the moral <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg>
      <lb/>
      <pb n="122" entity="DSSR_000002496_0137"/> of England outside of the jails. The colonists
      trembled. <lb/> It was feared that next there would be an importation of the <lb/> nobility.</p>
     <p>In those early days the colony was non-supporting. All <lb/> the necessaries of
      life&mdash;food, clothing, and all&mdash;were sent out <lb/> from England, and kept
      in great government store-houses, and <lb/> given to the convicts and sold to the
      settlers&mdash;sold at a trifling <lb/> advance upon cost. The Corps saw its opportunity.
      Its <lb/> officers went into commerce, and in a most lawless way. They <lb/> went to importing
      rum, and also to manufacturing it in private <lb/> stills, in defiance of the government's
      commands and protests. <lb/> They leagued themselves together and ruled the market; they <lb/>
      boycotted the government and the other dealers; they <reg orig="estab-|lished">established</reg>
      <lb/> a close monopoly and kept it strictly in their own hands. <lb/> When a vessel arrived
      with spirits, they allowed nobody to buy <lb/> but themselves, and they forced the owner to
      sell to them at a <lb/> price named by themselves&mdash;and it was always low enough.
      <lb/> They bought rum at an average of two dollars a gallon and <lb/> sold it at an average of
      ten. They <hi rend="italic">made rum the currency of <lb/> the country</hi>&mdash;for
      there was little or no money&mdash;and they <lb/> maintained their devastating hold and
      kept the colony under <lb/> their heel for eighteen or twenty years before they were finally
      <lb/> conquered and routed by the government.</p>
     <p>Meantime, they had spread intemperance everywhere. And <lb/> they had squeezed farm after
      farm out of the settlers' hands <lb/> for rum, and thus had bountifully enriched themselves.
      When <lb/> a farmer was caught in the last agonies of thirst they took <lb/> advantage of him
      and sweated him for a drink.</p>
     <p>In one instance they sold a man a gallon of rum worth two <lb/> dollars for a piece of
      property which was sold some years later <lb/> for $100,000.</p>
     <p>When the colony was about eighteen or twenty years old it <lb/> was discovered that the land
      was specially fitted for the wool <lb/>
      <pb n="123" entity="DSSR_000002496_0138"/> culture. Prosperity followed, commerce with the
      world began, <lb/> by and by rich mines of the noble metals were opened, <reg
       orig="immi-|grants">immigrants</reg>
      <lb/> flowed in, capital likewise. The result is the great and <lb/> wealthy and enlightened
      commonwealth of New South Wales.</p>
     <p>It is a country that is rich in mines, wool ranches, trams, <lb/> railways, steamship lines,
      schools, newspapers, botanical <reg orig="gar-|dens">gardens</reg>, <lb/> art galleries,
      libraries, museums, hospitals, learned <reg orig="socie-|ties">societies</reg>; <lb/> it is
      the hospitable home of every species of culture and of <lb/> every species of material
      enterprise, and there is a church at <lb/> every man's door, and a race-track over the way.</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">All</hi> English-speaking colonies are made up of lavishly <lb/>
      hospitable people, and New South Wales and its <reg orig="capi-|tal">capital</reg>
      <lb/> are like the rest in this. The English-speaking <lb/> colony of the United States of
      America is always called <reg orig="lav-|ishly">lavishly</reg>
      <lb/> hospitable by the English traveler. As to the other <lb/> English-speaking colonies
      throughout the world from Canada <lb/> all around, I know by experience that the description
      fits them. <lb/> I will not go more particularly into this matter, for I find that <lb/> when
      writers try to distribute their gratitude here and there <lb/> and yonder by detail they run
      across difficulties and do some <lb/> ungraceful stumbling.</p>
     <p>Mr. Gane ("New South Wales and Victoria in 1885"), <lb/> tried to
      distribute his gratitude, and was not lucky: <lb/>
      <q>"The inhabitants of Sydney are renowned for their hospitality. The <lb/> treatment which we
       experienced at the hands of this generous-hearted people <lb/> will help more than anything
       else to make us recollect with pleasure our stay <lb/> amongst them. In the character of
       hosts and hostesses they excel. The <lb/> 'new chum' needs only the acquaintanceship of one
       of their number, and he <lb/> becomes at once the happy recipient of numerous complimentary
       invitations <lb/> and thoughtful kindnesses. Of the towns it has been our good fortune to
       <lb/> visit, none have portrayed home so faithfully as Sydney."</q></p>
     <p>Nobody could say it finer than that. If he had put in his <lb/> cork then, and stayed away
      from Dubbo&mdash;but no; heedless <lb/> man, he pulled it again. Pulled it when he was
      away along <lb/> in his book, and his memory of what he had said about Sydney <lb/> had grown
      dim: <lb/>
      <pb n="125" entity="DSSR_000002496_0140"/>
      <q>"We cannot quit the promising town of Dubbo without testifying, in <lb/> warm praise, to
       the kind-hearted and hospitable usages of its inhabitants. <lb/> Sydney, though well
       deserving the character it bears of its kindly treatment <lb/> of strangers, possesses a
       little formality and reserve. In Dubbo, on the <reg orig="con-|trary">contrary</reg>, <lb/>
       though the same congenial manners prevail, there is a pleasing degree <lb/> of respectful
       familiarity which gives the town a homely comfort not often met <lb/> with elsewhere. In
       laying on one side our pen we feel contented in having <lb/> been able, though so late in
       this work, to bestow a panegyric, however <reg orig="un-|pretentious">unpretentious</reg>,
       <lb/> on a town which, though possessing no picturesque natural <reg orig="sur-|roundings"
        >surroundings</reg>, <lb/> nor interesting architectural productions, has yet a body of <reg
        orig="citi-|zens">citizens</reg>
       <lb/> whose hearts cannot but obtain for their town a reputation for <reg

      <p>HEEDLESS MAN.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>I wonder what soured him on Sydney. It seems strange <lb/> that a pleasing degree of three
      or four <lb/> fingers of respectful familiarity should fill <lb/> a man up and give him the
      panegyrics so <lb/> bad. For he <hi rend="italic">has</hi> them, the worst way&mdash;
      <lb/> any one can see that. A man who is <lb/> perfectly at himself does not throw cold <lb/>
      detraction at people's architectural <reg orig="pro-|ductions">productions</reg>
      <lb/> and picturesque surroundings, <lb/> and let on that what he prefers is a <reg
       orig="Dub-|bonese">Dubbonese</reg>
      <lb/> dust-storm and a pleasing degree <lb/> of respectful familiarity No, these are <lb/>
      old, old symptoms; and when they <reg orig="ap-|pear">appear</reg>
      <lb/> we know that the man has got the panegyrics.</p>
     <p>Sydney has a population of 400,000. When a stranger <lb/> from America steps ashore there,
      the first thing that strikes <lb/> him is that the place is eight or nine times as large as he
      was <lb/> expecting it to be; and the next thing that strikes him is that <lb/> it is an
      English city with American trimmings. Later on, in <lb/> Melbourne, he will find the American
      trimmings still more in <lb/> evidence; there, even the architecture will often suggest <lb/>
      America; a photograph of its stateliest business street might <lb/> be passed upon him for a
      picture of the finest street in a large <lb/> American city. I was told that the most of the
      fine residences <lb/>
      <pb n="126" entity="DSSR_000002496_0141"/> were the city residences of squatters. The name
      seemed out <lb/> of focus somehow. When the explanation came, it offered a <lb/> new instance
      of the curious changes which words, as well as <reg orig="ani-|mals">animals</reg>, <lb/>
      undergo through change of habitat and climate. With <lb/> us, when you speak of a squatter you
      are always supposed to <lb/> be speaking of a poor man, but in Australia when you speak <lb/>
      of a squatter you are supposed to be speaking of a millionaire; <lb/> in America the word
      indicates the possessor of a few acres and <lb/> a doubtful title, in Australia it indicates a
      man whose <reg orig="land-|front">land-front</reg>
      <lb/> is as long as a railroad, and whose title has been <reg orig="per-|fected">perfected</reg>
      <lb/> in one way or another; in America the word indicates <lb/> a man who owns a dozen head
      of live stock, in Australia a <lb/> man who owns anywhere from fifty thousand up to half a
      <lb/> million head; in America the word indicates a man who is <lb/> obscure and not
      important, in Australia a man who is <reg orig="promi-|nent">prominent</reg>
      <lb/> and of the first importance; in America you take off <lb/> your hat to no squatter, in
      Australia you do; in America if <lb/> your uncle is a squatter you keep it dark, in Australia
      you <reg orig="ad-|vertise">advertise</reg>
      <lb/> it; in America if your friend is a squatter nothing <lb/> comes of it, but with a
      squatter for your friend in Australia <lb/> you may sup with kings if there are any around.</p>
     <p>In Australia it takes about two acres and a half of <reg orig="pasture-|land">pasture-land</reg>
      <lb/> (some people say twice as many), to support a sheep; and <lb/> when
      the squatter has half a million sheep his private domain <lb/> is about as large as Rhode
      Island, to speak in general terms. <lb/> His annual wool crop may be worth a quarter or a half
      million <lb/> dollars.</p>
     <p>He will live in a palace in Melbourne or Sydney or some <lb/> other of the large cities, and
      make occasional trips to his <lb/> sheep-kingdom several hundred miles away in the great
      plains <lb/> to look after his battalions of riders and shepherds and other <lb/> hands. He
      has a commodious dwelling out there, and if he <lb/> approve of you he will invite you to
      spend a week in it, and <lb/>

     <p>On at least one of these vast estates there is a considerable <lb/> town, with all the
      various businesses and occupations that go <lb/> to make an important town; and the town and
      the land it <lb/> stands upon are the property of the squatters. I have seen <lb/> that town,
      and it is not unlikely that there are other <reg orig="squatter-|owned">squatter-owned</reg>
      <lb/> towns in Australia.</p>
     <p>Australia supplies the world not only with fine wool, but <lb/> with mutton also. The modern
      invention of cold storage and <lb/> its application in ships has created this great trade. In
       <reg orig="Syd-|ney">Sydney</reg>
      <lb/> I visited a huge establishment where they kill and clean <lb/> and solidly freeze a
      thousand sheep a day, for shipment to <lb/> England.</p>
     <p>The Australians did not seem to me to differ noticeably <lb/> from Americans, either in
      dress, carriage, ways, pronunciation, <lb/> inflections, or general appearance. There were
      fleeting and <lb/> subtle suggestions of their English origin, but these were not <lb/>
      pronounced enough, as a rule, to catch one's attention. The <lb/> people have easy and cordial
      manners from the beginning&mdash; <lb/> from the moment that the introduction is
      completed. This is <lb/> American. To put it in another way, it is English friendliness <lb/>
      with the English shyness and self-consciousness left out.</p>
     <p>Now and then&mdash;but this is rare&mdash;one hears such words as <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">piper</hi> for paper, <hi rend="italic">lydy</hi> for lady, and <hi
       rend="italic">tyble</hi> for table fall from <lb/> lips whence one would not expect such
      pronunciations to come. <lb/> There is a superstition prevalent in Sydney that this <reg
       orig="pronunci-|ation">pronunciation</reg>
      <lb/> is an Australianism, but people who have been "home" <lb/> &mdash;as the native
      reverently and lovingly calls England&mdash;know <lb/> better. It is "costermonger." All
      over Australasia this <reg orig="pro-|nunciation">pronunciation</reg>
      <lb/> is nearly as common among servants as it is in <reg orig="Lon-|don">London</reg>
      <lb/> among the uneducated and the partially educated of all <lb/>
      <pb n="130" entity="DSSR_000002496_0145"/> sorts and conditions of people. That mislaid <hi
       rend="italic">y</hi> is rather <reg orig="strik-|ing">striking</reg>
      <lb/> when a person gets enough of it into a short sentence to <lb/> enable it to show up. In
      the hotel in Sydney the <reg orig="chamber-|maid">chambermaid</reg>
      <lb/> said, one morning&mdash;</p>
     <p>"The tyble is set, and here is the piper; and if the lydy is <lb/> ready I'll tell the wyter
      to bring up the breakfast."</p>
     <p>I have made passing mention, a moment ago, of the native <lb/> Australasian's custom of
      speaking of England as "home." It <lb/> was always pretty to hear it, and often it was said in
      an <reg orig="un-|consciously">unconsciously</reg>
      <lb/> caressing way that made it touching; in a way <lb/> which transmuted a sentiment into an
      embodiment, and made <lb/> one seem to see Australasia as a young girl stroking mother <lb/>
      England's old gray head.</p>
     <p>In the Australasian home the table-talk is vivacious and <lb/> unembarrassed; it is without
      stiffness or restraint. This does <lb/> not remind one of England so much as it does of
      America. <lb/> But Australasia is strictly democratic, and reserves and <reg
       orig="re-|straints">restraints</reg>
      <lb/> are things that are bred by differences of rank.</p>
     <p>English and colonial audiences are phenomenally alert and <lb/> responsive. Where masses of
      people are gathered together in <lb/> England, caste is submerged, and with it the English
      reserve; <lb/> equality exists for the moment, and every individual is free; <lb/> so free
      from any consciousness of fetters, indeed, that the <reg orig="Eng-|lishman's">Englishman's</reg>
      <lb/> habit of watching himself and guarding himself <lb/> against any injudicious exposure of
      his feelings is forgotten, <lb/> and falls into abeyance&mdash;and to such a degree
      indeed, that he <lb/> will bravely applaud all by himself if he wants to&mdash;an <reg
       orig="exhi-|bition">exhibition</reg>
      <lb/> of daring which is unusual elsewhere in the world.</p>
     <p>But it is hard to move a new English acquaintance when he <lb/> is by himself, or when the
      company present is small, and new <lb/> to him. He is on his guard then, and his natural
      reserve is to <lb/> the fore. This has given him the false reputation of being <lb/> without
      humor and without the appreciation of humor. <lb/>
      <pb n="131" entity="DSSR_000002496_0146"/> Americans are not Englishmen, and American humor is
      not <lb/> English humor; but both the American and his humor had <lb/> their origin in

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> Sydney I had a large dream, and in the course of talk I <lb/>
      told it to a missionary from India who was on his way to <lb/> visit some relatives in New
      Zealand. I dreamed that the <lb/> visible universe is the physical person of God; that the
      vast <lb/> worlds that we see twinkling millions of miles apart in the fields <lb/> of space
      are the blood corpuscles in His veins; and that we <lb/> and the other creatures are the
      microbes that charge with <lb/> multitudinous life the corpuscles.</p>
     <p>Mr. X., the missionary, considered the dream awhile, then <lb/> said: <lb/>
      <q>"It is not surpassable for magnitude, since its metes and bounds are the <lb/> metes and
       bounds of the universe itself; and it seems to me that it almost <reg orig="ac-|counts"
        >accounts</reg>
       <lb/> for a thing which is otherwise nearly unaccountable&mdash;the origin of <lb/> the
       sacred legends of the Hindoos. Perhaps they dream them, and then <reg orig="hon-|estly"
        >honestly</reg>
       <lb/> believe them to be divine revelations of fact. It looks like that, for the <lb/>
       legends are built on so vast a scale that it does not seem reasonable that <lb/> plodding
       priests would happen upon such colossal fancies when awake."</q></p>
     <p>He told some of the legends, and said that they were <reg orig="im-|plicitly">implicitly</reg>
      <lb/> believed by all classes of Hindoos, including those of <lb/> high social position and
      intelligence; and he said that this <lb/> universal credulity was a great hindrance to the
      missionary in <lb/> his work. Then he said something like this:</p>
     <p>"At home, people wonder why Christianity does not make faster progress <lb/> in India. They
      hear that the Indians believe easily, and that they have a <lb/> natural trust in miracles and
      give them a hospitable reception. Then they <lb/> argue like this: since the Indian believes
      easily, place Christianity before them <lb/> and they must believe; confirm its truths by the
      biblical miracles, and they <lb/> will no longer doubt. The natural deduction is, that as
      Christianity makes <lb/>
      <pb n="133" entity="DSSR_000002496_0148"/> but indifferent progress in India, the fault is
      with us: we are not fortunate in <lb/> presenting the doctrines and the miracles.</p>
     <p>"But the truth is, we are not by any means so well equipped as they think. <lb/> We have <hi
       rend="italic">not</hi> the easy task that they imagine. To use a military figure, we <lb/>
      are sent against the enemy with good powder in our guns, but only wads for <lb/> bullets; that
      is to say, our miracles are not effective; the Hindoos do not care <lb/> for them; they have
      more extraordinary ones of their own. All the details of <lb/> their own religion are proven
      and established by miracles; the details of ours <lb/> must be proven in the same way. When I
      first began my work in India I <lb/> greatly underestimated the difficulties thus put upon my
      task. A correction <lb/> was not long in coming. I thought as our friends think at
      home&mdash;that to <lb/> prepare my childlike wonder-lovers to listen with favor to my
      grave message <lb/> I only needed to charm the way to it with wonders, marvels, miracles. With
      <lb/> full confidence I told the wonders performed by Samson, the strongest man <lb/> that had
      ever lived&mdash;for so I called him.</p>
     <p>"At first I saw lively anticipation and strong interest in the faces of my <lb/> people, but
      as I moved along from incident to incident of the great story, I <lb/> was distressed to see
      that I was steadily losing the sympathy of my audience. <lb/> I could not understand it. It
      was a surprise to me, and a disappointment. <lb/> Before I was through, the fading sympathy
      had paled to indifference. <lb/> Thence to the end the indifference remained; I was not able
      to make any <reg orig="im-|pression">impression</reg>
      <lb/> upon it.</p>
     <p>"A good old Hindoo gentleman told me where my trouble lay. He <lb/> said 'We Hindoos
      recognize a god by the work of his hands&mdash;we accept no <lb/> other testimony.
      Apparently, this is also the rule with you Christians. And <lb/> we know when a man has his
      power from a god by the fact that he does <lb/> things which he could not do, as a man, with
      the mere powers of a man. <lb/> Plainly, this is the Christian's way also, of knowing when a
      man is working <lb/> by a god's power and not by his own. You saw that there was a
      supernatural <lb/> property in the hair of Samson; for you perceived that when his hair was
      <lb/> gone he was as other men. It is our way, as I have said. There are many <lb/> nations in
      the world, and each group of nations has its own gods, and will pay <lb/> no worship to the
      gods of the others. Each group believes its own gods to <lb/> be strongest, and it will not
      exchange them except for gods that shall be proven <lb/> to be their superiors in power. Man
      is but a weak creature, and needs the <lb/> help of gods&mdash;he cannot do without it.
      Shall he place his fate in the hands <lb/> of weak gods when there may be stronger ones to be
      found? That would be <lb/> foolish. No, if he hear of gods that are stronger than his own, he
      should not <lb/> turn a deaf ear, for it is not a light matter that is at stake. How then
      shall <lb/> he determine which gods are the stronger, his own or those that preside over <lb/>
      the concerns of other nations? By comparing the known works of his own <lb/> gods with the
      works of those others; there is no other way. Now, when we <lb/> make this comparison, we are
      not drawn towards the gods of any other nation. <lb/> Our gods are shown by their works to be
      the strongest, the most powerful. <lb/> The Christians have but few gods, and they are
      new&mdash;new, and not strong, <lb/> as it seems to us. They will increase in number, it
      is true, for this has <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg>
      <lb/> with all gods, but that time is far away, many ages and decades of <lb/>
      <pb n="134" entity="DSSR_000002496_0149"/> ages away, for gods multiply slowly, as is meet for
      beings to whom a <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg>
      <lb/> years is but a single moment. Our own gods have been born millions <lb/> of years apart.
      The process is slow, the gathering of strength and power is <lb/> similarly slow. In the slow
      lapse of the ages the steadily accumulating power <lb/> of our gods has at last become
      prodigious. We have a thousand proofs of <lb/> this in the colossal character of their
      personal acts and the acts of ordinary men <lb/> to whom they have given supernatural
      qualities. To your Samson was given <lb/> supernatural power, and when he broke the withes,
      and slew the thousands <lb/> with the jawbone of an ass, and carried away the gates of the
      city upon his <lb/> shoulders, you were amazed&mdash;and also awed, for you recognized
      the divine <lb/> source of his strength. But it could not profit to place these things before
      <lb/> your Hindoo congregation and invite their wonder; for they would compare <lb/> them with
      the deed done by Hanuman, when our gods infused their divine <lb/> strength into his muscles;
      and they would be indifferent to them&mdash;as you <lb/> saw. In the old, old times, ages
      and ages gone by, when our god Rama was <lb/> warring with the demon god of Ceylon, Rama
      bethought him to bridge the <lb/> sea and connect Ceylon with India, so that his armies might
      pass easily <lb/> over; and he sent his general, Hanuman, inspired like your own Samson with
      <lb/> divine strength, to bring the materials for the bridge. In two days Hanuman <lb/> strode
      fifteen hundred miles, to the Himalayas, and took upon his shoulder a <lb/> range of those
      lofty mountains two hundred miles long, and started with it <lb/> toward Ceylon. It was in the
      night; and, as he passed along the plain, the <lb/> people of Govardhun heard the thunder of
      his tread and felt the earth rocking <lb/> under it, and they ran out, and there, with their
      snowy summits piled to <lb/> heaven, they saw the Himalayas passing by. And as this huge
      continent swept <lb/> along overshadowing the earth, upon its slopes they discerned the
      twinkling <lb/> lights of a thousand sleeping villages, and it was as if the constellations
      were <lb/> filing in procession through the sky. While they were looking, Hanuman <lb/>
      stumbled, and a small ridge of red sandstone twenty miles long was jolted <lb/> loose and
      fell. Half of its length has wasted away in the course of the ages, <lb/> but the other ten
      miles of it remain in the plain by Govardhun to this day as <lb/> proof of the might of the
      inspiration of our gods. You must know, <reg orig="your-|self">yourself</reg>, <lb/> that
      Hanuman could not have carried those mountains to Ceylon except <lb/> by the strength of the
      gods. You know that it was not done by his own <lb/> strength, therefore, you know that it <hi
       rend="italic">was</hi> done by the strength of the gods, <lb/> just as you know that Samson
      carried the gates by the divine strength and not by <lb/> his own. I think you must concede
      two things: First, That in carrying the <lb/> gates of the city upon his shoulders, Samson did
      not establish the <reg orig="supe-|riority">superiority</reg>
      <lb/> of his gods over ours; secondly, That his feat is not supported by any <lb/> but verbal
      evidence, while Hanuman's is not only supported by verbal <reg orig="evi-|dence"
      >evidence</reg>, <lb/> but this evidence is confirmed, established, proven, by visible, <reg
       orig="tangi-|ble">tangible</reg>
      <lb/> evidence, which is the strongest of all testimony. We have the sandstone <lb/> ridge,
      and while it remains we cannot doubt, and shall not. Have you the <lb/> gates?'"</p>

     </argument>
     <p><hi rend="small-caps">One</hi> is sure to be struck by the liberal way in which <lb/>
      Australasia spends money upon public works&mdash;such <lb/> as legislative buildings,
      town halls, hospitals, asylums, <lb/> parks, and botanical gardens. I should say that where
      minor <lb/> towns in America spend a hundred dollars on the town hall <lb/> and on public
      parks and gardens, the like towns in Australasia <lb/> spend a thousand. And I think that this
      ratio will hold good <lb/> in the matter of hospitals, also. I have seen a costly and <reg
       orig="well-|equipped">well-equipped</reg>, <lb/> and architecturally handsome hospital in an
       <reg orig="Aus-|tralian">Australian</reg>
      <lb/> village of fifteen hundred inhabitants. It was built by <lb/> private funds furnished by
      the villagers and the neighboring <lb/> planters, and its running expenses were drawn from the
      same <lb/> sources. I suppose it would be hard to match this in any <lb/> country. This
      village was about to close a contract for <reg orig="light-|ing">lighting</reg>
      <lb/> its streets with the electric light, when I was there. That <lb/> is ahead of London.
      London is still obscured by gas&mdash;gas <lb/> pretty widely scattered, too, in some of
      the districts; so widely <lb/> indeed, that except on moonlight nights it is difficult to find
      <lb/> the gas lamps.</p>
     <p>The botanical garden of Sydney covers thirty-eight acres, <lb/> beautifully laid out and
      rich with the spoil of all the lands and <lb/> all the climes of the world. The garden is on
      high ground in <lb/> the middle of the town, overlooking the great harbor, and it <lb/>
      adjoins the spacious grounds of Government House&mdash;fifty-six <lb/> acres; and at hand
      also, is a recreation ground containing <lb/>
      <pb n="138" entity="DSSR_000002496_0153"/> eighty-two acres. In addition, there are the
      zo&ouml;logical gardens, <lb/> the race-course, and the great cricket-grounds where the
       <reg orig="inter-|national">international</reg>
      <lb/> matches are played. Therefore there is plenty of <lb/> room for reposeful lazying and
      lounging, and for exercise too, <lb/> for such as like that kind of work.</p>
     <p>There are four specialties attainable in the way of social <lb/> pleasure. If you enter your
      name on the Visitor's Book at <lb/> Government House you will receive an invitation to the
      next <lb/> ball that takes place there, if nothing can be proven against <lb/> you. And it
      will be very pleasant; for you will see everybody <lb/> except the Governor, and add a number
      of acquaintances and <lb/> several friends to your list. The Governor will be in England.
      <lb/> He always is. The continent has four or five governors, and I <lb/> do not know how many
      it takes to govern the outlying <lb/> archipelago; but anyway you will not see them. When they
      <lb/> are appointed they come out from England and get inaugurated, <lb/> and give a ball, and
      help pray for rain, and get aboard ship <lb/> and go back home. And so the Lieutenant-Governor
      has to <lb/> do all the work. I was in Australasia three months and a half, <lb/> and saw only
      one Governor. The others were at home.</p>
     <p>The Australasian Governor would not be so restless, <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg>,
      <lb/> if he had a war, or a veto, or something like that to call <lb/> for his
      reserve-energies, but he hasn't. There isn't any war, <lb/> and there isn't any veto in his
      hands. And so there is really <lb/> little or nothing doing in his line. The country governs
      itself, <lb/> and prefers to do it; and is so strenuous about it and so jealous <lb/> of its
      independence that it grows restive if even the Imperial <lb/> Government at home proposes to
      help; and so the Imperial <lb/> veto, while a fact, is yet mainly a name.</p>
     <p>Thus the Governor's functions are much more limited than <lb/> are a Governor's functions
      with us. And therefore more <lb/> fatiguing. He is the apparent head of the State, he is the
      real <lb/> head of Society. He represents culture, refinement, elevated <lb/>

       <p>SYDNEY'S FOUR ENTERTAINMENTS.</p>
      </figure>
      <pb n="141" entity="DSSR_000002496_0156"/> sentiment, polite life, religion; and by his
      example he <reg orig="propa-|gates">propagates</reg>
      <lb/> these, and they spread and flourish and bear good fruit. <lb/> He creates the fashion,
      and leads it. His ball is the ball of <lb/> balls, and his countenance makes the horse-race
      thrive.</p>
     <p>He is usually a lord, and this is well; for his position <reg orig="com-|pels">compels</reg>
      <lb/> him to lead an expensive life, and an English lord is <lb/> generally well equipped for
      that.</p>
     <p>Another of Sydney's social pleasures is the visit to the <lb/> Admiralty House; which is
      nobly situated on high ground <lb/> overlooking the water. The trim boats of the service
      convey <lb/> the guests thither; and there, or on board the flag-ship, they <lb/> have the
      duplicate of the hospitalities of Government House. <lb/> The Admiral commanding a station in
      British waters is a <lb/> magnate of the first degree, and he is sumptuously housed, as <lb/>
      becomes the dignity of his office.</p>
     <p>Third in the list of special pleasures is the tour of the <lb/> harbor in a fine steam
      pleasure-launch. Your richer friends <lb/> own boats of this kind, and they will invite you,
      and the joys <lb/> of the trip will make a long day seem short.</p>
     <p>And finally comes the shark-fishing. Sydney Harbor is <lb/> populous with the finest breeds
      of man-eating sharks in the <lb/> world. Some people make their living catching them; for the
      <lb/> Government pays a cash bounty on them. The larger the <lb/> shark the larger the bounty,
      and some of the sharks are twenty <lb/> feet long. You not only get the bounty, but everything
      that <lb/> is in the shark belongs to you. Sometimes the contents are <lb/> quite valuable.</p>
     <p>The shark is the swiftest fish that swims. The speed of <lb/> the fastest steamer afloat is
      poor compared to his. And he is <lb/> a great gad-about, and roams far and wide in the oceans,
      and <lb/> visits the shores of all of them, ultimately, in the course of his <lb/> restless
      excursions. I have a tale to tell now, which has not <lb/> as yet been in print. In 1870 a
      young stranger arrived in <lb/>
      <pb n="142" entity="DSSR_000002496_0157"/> Sydney, and set about finding something to do; but
      he knew <lb/> no one, and brought no recommendations, and the result was <lb/> that he got no
      employment. He had aimed high, at first, but <lb/> as time and his money wasted away he grew
      less and less <lb/> exacting, until at last he was willing to serve in the humblest <lb/>
      capacities if so he might get bread and shelter. But luck was <lb/> still against him; he
      could find no opening of any sort. <lb/> Finally his money was all gone. He walked the streets
      all day, <lb/> thinking; he walked them all night, thinking, thinking, and <lb/> growing
      hungrier and hungrier. At dawn he found himself <lb/> well away from the town and drifting
      aimlessly along the <lb/> harbor shore. As he was passing by a nodding shark-fisher <lb/> the
      man looked up and said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Say, young fellow, take my line a spell, and change my <lb/> luck for me."</p>
     <p>"How do you know I won't make it worse?"</p>
     <p>"Because you can't. It has been at its worst all night. <lb/> If you can't change it, no
      harm's done; if you do change it, <lb/> it's for the better, of course. Come."</p>
     <p>"All right, what will you give?"</p>
     <p>"I'll give you the shark, if you catch one."</p>
     <p>"And I will eat it, bones and all. Give me the line."</p>
     <p>"Here you are. I will get away, now, for awhile, so that <lb/> my luck won't spoil yours;
      for many and many a time I've <lb/> noticed that if&mdash;there, pull in, pull in, man,
      you've got a bite! <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">I</hi>knew how it would be. Why, I knew you for a born son of <lb/> luck the
      minute I saw you. All right&mdash;he's landed."</p>
     <p>It was an unusually large shark&mdash;"a full nineteen-footer," <lb/> the fisherman
      said, as he laid the creature open with his knife.</p>
     <p>"Now you rob him, young man, while I step to my hamper <lb/> for a fresh bait. There's
      generally something in them worth <lb/> going for. You've changed my luck, you see. But my
       <reg orig="good-|ness">goodness</reg>, <lb/> I hope you haven't changed your own."</p>
     <pb n="143" entity="DSSR_000002496_0158"/>
     <p>"Oh, it wouldn't matter; don't worry about that. Get <lb/> your bait. I'll rob him."</p>
     <p>When the fisherman got back the young man had just <lb/> finished washing his hands in the
      bay, and was starting away.</p>
     <p>"What, you are not going?"</p>
     <p>"Yes. Good-bye."</p>
     <p>"But what about your shark?"</p>
     <p>"The shark? Why, what use is he to me?"</p>
     <p>"What <hi rend="italic">use</hi> is he? I like that. Don't you know that we <lb/> can go and
      report him to Government, and you'll get a clean <lb/> solid eighty shillings bounty? Hard
      cash, you know. What <lb/> do you think about it <hi rend="italic">now?</hi>"</p>
     <p>"Oh, well, you can collect it."</p>
     <p>"And <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> it? Is that what you mean?"</p>
     <p>"Yes."</p>
     <p>"Well, this is odd. You're one of those sort they call <lb/> eccentrics, I judge. The saying
      is, you mustn't judge a man <lb/> by his clothes, and I'm believing it now. Why yours are <reg
       orig="look-|ing">looking</reg>
      <lb/> just ratty, don't you know; and yet you must be rich."</p>
     <p>"I am."</p>
     <p>The young man walked slowly back to the town, deeply <lb/> musing as he went. He halted a
      moment in front of the best <lb/> restaurant, then glanced at his clothes and passed on, and
      got <lb/> his breakfast at a "stand-up." There was a good deal of it, <lb/> and it cost five
      shillings. He tendered a sovereign, got his <lb/> change, glanced at his silver, muttered to
      himself, "There isn't <lb/> enough to buy clothes with," and went his way.</p>
     <p>At half-past nine the richest wool-broker in Sydney was <reg orig="sit-|ting">sitting</reg>
      <lb/> in his morning-room at home, settling his breakfast with <lb/> the morning paper. A
      servant put his head in and said:</p>
     <p>"There's a sundowner at the door wants to see you, sir."</p>
     <p>"What do you bring that kind of a message here for? <lb/> Send him about his business."?</p>
     <pb n="144" entity="DSSR_000002496_0159"/>
     <p>"He won't go, sir. I've tried."</p>
     <p>"He won't go? That's&mdash;why, that's unusual. He's one <lb/> of two things, then:
      he's a remarkable person, or he's crazy. <lb/> Is he crazy?"</p>
     <p>"No, sir. He don't look it."</p>
     <p>"Then he's remarkable. What does he say he wants?"</p>
     <p>"He won't tell, sir; only says it's very important."</p>
     <p>"And won't go. Does he <hi rend="italic">say</hi> he won't go?"</p>
     <p>"Says he'll stand there till he sees you, sir, if it's all day."</p>
     <p>"And yet isn't crazy. Show him up."</p>
     <p>The sundowner was shown in. The broker said to himself, <lb/> "No, he's not crazy; that is
      easy to see; so he must be the <lb/> other thing."</p>
     <p>Then aloud, "Well, my good fellow, be quick about it; <lb/> don't waste any words; what is

     <p>"I want to borrow a hundred thousand pounds."</p>

     <p>"What is your name?"</p>
     <p>"Cecil Rhodes."</p>
     <p>"No, I don't remember hearing the name before. Now <lb/> then&mdash;just for
      curiosity's sake&mdash;what has sent you to me on <lb/> this extraordinary errand?"</p>
     <p>"The intention to make a hundred thousand pounds for <lb/> you and as much for myself within
      the next sixty days."</p>
     <p>"Well, well, well. It is the most extraordinary idea that I <lb/> &mdash;sit <hi

     <p>"Pardon, so you did. I thought it was an unheedful use of <lb/> the word&mdash;an
      unheedful valuing of its strength, you know."</p>
     <p>"I knew its strength."</p>
     <p>"Well, I must say&mdash;but look here, let me walk the floor a <lb/> little, my mind is

      <lb/> don't seem disturbed any. (Plainly this young fellow isn't <lb/> crazy; but as

      over.) Now then, I believe I am <reg orig="be-|yond">beyond</reg>
      <lb/> the reach of further astonishment. Strike, and spare <lb/> not. What is your scheme?"</p>
     <p>"To buy the wool crop&mdash;deliverable in sixty days."</p>
     <p>"What, the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> of it?"</p>
     <p>"The whole of it."</p>
     <p>"No, I was not quite out of the reach of surprises, after <lb/> all. Why, how you talk! Do
      you know what our crop is <lb/> going to foot up?"</p>
     <p>"Two and a half million sterling&mdash;maybe a little more."</p>
     <p>"Well, you've got your statistics right, any way. Now, <lb/> then, do you know what the
      margins would foot up, to buy it <lb/> at sixty days?"</p>

     <p>"Right, once more. Well, dear me, just to see what would <lb/> happen, I wish you had the

     <p>"I shall make two hundred thousand pounds out of it in <lb/> sixty days."</p>
     <p>"You mean, of course, that you <hi rend="italic">might</hi> make it if&mdash;"</p>
     <p>"I said 'shall'."</p>

     <p>"I don't think&mdash;I know."</p>
     <p>"Definite again. <hi rend="italic">How</hi> do you know?"</p>
     <p>"Because France has declared war against Germany, and <lb/> wool has gone up fourteen per

     <p>"And a pity, too. But there are times for mourning, and <lb/> we will attend to this case

      when they are <lb/> called to deliver the goods, they will think they've been struck <lb/> by

      <lb/> Men, Remarkable Men, and Lunatics. I'll <lb/> classify you with the Remarkables, and
      take the chances."</p>
     <p>The deal went through, and secured to the young stranger <lb/> the first fortune he ever
      pocketed.</p>
     <p>The people of Sydney ought to be afraid of the sharks, but <lb/> for some reason they do not
      seem to be. On Saturdays the <lb/> young men go out in their boats, and sometimes the water is
      <lb/> fairly covered with the little sails. A boat upsets now and <lb/> then, by accident, a
      result of tumultuous skylarking; <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg>
      <lb/> the boys upset their boat for fun&mdash;such as it is&mdash;with <lb/> sharks
      visibly waiting around for just such an occurrence. <lb/> The young fellows scramble aboard
      whole&mdash;sometimes&mdash;not <lb/> always. Tragedies have happened more than
      once. While I <lb/> was in Sydney it was reported that a boy fell out of a boat in <lb/> the
      mouth of the Paramatta river and screamed for help and <lb/> a boy jumped overboard from
      another boat to save him from <lb/> the assembling sharks; but the sharks made swift work with
      <lb/> the lives of both.</p>
     <p>The government pays a bounty for the shark; to get the <lb/> bounty the fishermen bait the
      hook or the seine with agreeable <lb/> mutton; the news spreads and the sharks come from all
      over <lb/> the Pacific Ocean to get the free board. In time the shark <lb/> culture will be
      one of the most successful things in the colony.</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">My</hi> health had broken down in New York in May; it <lb/> had
      remained in a doubtful but fairish condition <reg orig="dur-|ing">during</reg>
      <lb/> a succeeding period of 82 days; it broke again <lb/> on the Pacific. It broke again in
      Sydney, but not until after <lb/> I had had a good outing, and had also filled my lecture <reg
       orig="en-|gagements">engagements</reg>. <lb/> This latest break lost me the chance of seeing
      <lb/> Queensland. In the circumstances, to go north toward hotter <lb/> weather was not
      advisable.</p>
     <p>So we moved south with a westward slant, 17 hours by rail <lb/> to the capital of the colony
      of Victoria, Melbourne&mdash;that <lb/> juvenile city of sixty years, and half a million
      inhabitants. <lb/> On the map the distance looked small; but that is a trouble <lb/> with all
      divisions of distance in such a vast country as <reg orig="Aus-|tralia">Australia</reg>. <lb/>
      The colony of Victoria itself looks small on the map&mdash; <lb/> looks like a county, in
      fact&mdash;yet it is about as large as <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg>, <lb/>
      Scotland, and Wales combined. Or, to get another focus <lb/> upon it, it is just 80 times as
      large as the state of Rhode Island, <lb/> and one-third as large as the State of Texas.</p>
     <p>Outside of Melbourne, Victoria seems to be owned by a <lb/> handful of squatters, each with
      a Rhode Island for a sheep farm. <lb/> That is the impression which one gathers from common
      talk, <lb/> yet the wool industry of Victoria is by no means so great as <lb/> that of New
      South Wales. The climate of Victoria is <reg orig="favor-|able">favorable</reg>
      <lb/> to other great industries&mdash;among others, wheat-growing <lb/> and the making of
      wine.</p>
     <pb n="152" entity="DSSR_000002496_0167"/>
     <p>We took the train at Sydney at about four in the afternoon. <lb/> It was American in one
      way, for we had a most rational <reg orig="sleep-|ing">sleeping</reg>
      <lb/> car; also the car was clean and fine and new&mdash;nothing <lb/> about it to
      suggest the rolling stock of the continent of Europe. <lb/> But our baggage was weighed, and
      extra weight charged for. <lb/> That was continental. Continental and troublesome. Any <lb/>
      detail of railroading that is not troublesome cannot honorably <lb/> be described as
      continental.</p>
     <p>The tickets were round-trip ones&mdash;to Melbourne, and clear <lb/> to Adelaide in
      South Australia, and then all the way back <lb/> to Sydney. Twelve hundred more miles than we
      really <reg orig="ex-|pected">expected</reg>
      <lb/> to make; but then as the round trip wouldn't cost much <lb/> more than the single trip,
      it seemed well enough to buy as <lb/> many miles as one could afford, even if one was not
      likely to <lb/> need them. A human being has a natural desire to have more <lb/> of a good
      thing than he needs.</p>
     <figure id="f44" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002496_0167">
      <p>THE ODDEST THING IN AUSTRALASIA.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>Now comes a singular thing: the oddest thing, the strangest <lb/> thing, the most baffling
      and unaccountable marvel that <reg orig="Aus-|tralasia">Australasia</reg>
      <lb/> can show. At the frontier between New South Wales <lb/> and Victoria our multitude of
      passengers were routed out of <lb/> their snug beds by lantern-light in the morning in the
      biting <lb/>
      <pb n="153" entity="DSSR_000002496_0168"/> cold of a high altitude to change cars on a road
      that has no <lb/> break in it from Sydney to Melbourne! Think of the <reg orig="paraly-|sis"
       >paralysis</reg>
      <lb/> of intellect that gave that idea birth; imagine the boulder <lb/> it emerged from on
      some petrified legislator's shoulders. </p>
     <p>It is a narrow-gauge road to the frontier, and a broader <lb/> gauge thence to Melbourne.
      The two governments were the <lb/> builders of the road and are the owners of it. One or two
      <lb/> reasons are given for this curious state of things. One is, that <lb/> it represents the
      jealousy existing between the colonies&mdash; <lb/> the two most important colonies of
      Australasia. What the <lb/> other one is, I have forgotten. But it is of no consequence. <lb/>
      It could be but another effort to explain the inexplicable.</p>
     <p>All passengers fret at the double-gauge; all shippers of <lb/> freight must of course fret
      at it; unnecessary expense, delay, <lb/> and annoyance are imposed upon everybody concerned,
      and no <lb/> one is benefited.</p>
     <p>Each Australian colony fences itself off from its neighbor <lb/> with a custom-house.
      Personally, I have no objection, but it <lb/> must be a good deal of inconvenience to the
      people. We have <lb/> something resembling it here and there in America, but it goes <lb/> by
      another name. The large empire of the Pacific coast requires <lb/> a world of iron machinery,
      and could manufacture it <reg orig="economic-|ally">economically</reg>
      <lb/> on the spot if the imposts on foreign iron were removed. <lb/> But they are not.
      Protection to Pennsylvania and Alabama <lb/> forbids it. The result to the Pacific coast is
      the same as if <lb/> there were several rows of custom-fences between the coast <lb/> and the
      East. Iron carted across the American continent at <lb/> luxurious railway rates would be
      valuable enough to be coined <lb/> when it arrived.</p>
     <p>We changed cars. This was at Albury. And it was there, <lb/> I think, that the growing day
      and the early sun exposed the <lb/> distant range called the Blue Mountains. Accurately named.
      <lb/> "My word!" as the Australians say, but it was a stunning <lb/>
      <pb n="154" entity="DSSR_000002496_0169"/> color, that blue. Deep, strong, rich, exquisite;
      towering and <lb/> majestic masses of blue&mdash;a softly luminous blue, a smouldering
      <lb/> blue, as if vaguely lit by fires within. It extinguished the blue <lb/> of the
      sky&mdash;made it pallid and unwholesome, whitey and <lb/> washed-out. A wonderful
      color&mdash;just divine.</p>
     <p>A resident told me that those were not mountains; he said <lb/> they were rabbit-piles. And
      explained that long exposure and <lb/> the over-ripe condition of the rabbits was what made
      them <lb/> look so blue. This man may have been right, but much <reg orig="read-|ing">reading</reg>
      <lb/> of books of travel has made me distrustful of gratis <reg orig="infor-|mation"
       >information</reg>
      <lb/> furnished by unofficial residents of a country. The <lb/> facts which such people give
      to travelers are usually erroneous, <lb/> and often intemperately so. The rabbit-plague has
      indeed <lb/> been very bad in Australia, and it could account for one <reg orig="moun-|tain"
       >mountain</reg>, <lb/> but not for a mountain range, it seems to me. It is too <lb/> large an
      order.</p>
     <p>We breakfasted at the station. A good breakfast, except <lb/> the coffee; and cheap. The
      Government establishes the prices <lb/> and placards them. The waiters were men, I think; but
      that <lb/> is not usual in Australasia. The usual thing is to have girls. <lb/> No, not girls,
      young ladies&mdash;generally duchesses. Dress? <lb/> They would attract attention at any
      royal lev&eacute;e in Europe. <lb/> Even empresses and queens do not dress as they do. Not
      that <lb/> they could not afford it, perhaps, but they would not know how.</p>
     <p>All the pleasant morning we slid smoothly along over the <lb/> plains, through
      thin&mdash;not thick&mdash;forests of great melancholy <lb/> gum trees, with trunks
      rugged with curled sheets of flaking bark <lb/> &mdash;erysipelas convalescents, so to
      speak, shedding their dead <lb/> skins. And all along were tiny cabins, built sometimes of
      <lb/> wood, sometimes of gray-blue corrugated iron; and the <reg orig="door-|steps">doorsteps</reg>
      <lb/> and fences were clogged with children&mdash;rugged little <lb/> simply-clad chaps
      that looked as if they had been imported <lb/> from the banks of the Mississippi without
      breaking bulk.</p>
     <pb n="155" entity="DSSR_000002496_0170"/>
     <p>And there were little villages, with neat stations well <reg orig="pla-|carded">placarded</reg>
      <lb/> with showy advertisements&mdash;mainly of almost <hi rend="italic">too </hi>
      <lb/> self-righteous brands of "sheep-dip." If that is the name&mdash; <lb/> and I think
      it is. It is a stuff like tar, and is dabbed on to <lb/> places where the shearer clips a
      piece out of the sheep. It <lb/> bars out the flies, and has healing properties, and a nip to
      it <lb/> which makes the sheep skip like the cattle on a thousand hills. <lb/> It is not good
      to eat. That is, it is not good to eat except <lb/> when mixed with railroad coffee. It
      improves railroad coffee. <lb/> Without it railroad coffee is too vague. But with it, it is
      quite <lb/> assertive and enthusiastic. By itself, railroad coffee is too <reg
       orig="pas-|sive">passive</reg>; <lb/> but sheep-dip makes it wake up and get down to
      business. <lb/> I wonder where they get railroad coffee?</p>
     <figure id="f45" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002496_0170">
      <p>THINGS NOT SEEN.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>We saw birds, but not a kangaroo, not an emu, not an <lb/> ornithorhyncus, not a lecturer,
      not a native. Indeed, the land <lb/> seemed quite destitute of game. But I have misused the
      word <lb/> native. In Australia it is applied to Australian-born whites <lb/> only. I should
      have said that we saw no Aboriginals&mdash;no <lb/> "blackfellows." And to this day I
      have never seen one. In <lb/> the great museums you will find all the other curiosities, but
      in <lb/> the curio of chiefest interest to the stranger all of them are <lb/> lacking. We have
      at home an abundance of museums, and <lb/> not an American Indian in them. It is clearly an

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> air was balmy and delicious, the sunshine radiant; <lb/> it
      was a charming excursion. In the course of it we <lb/> came to a town whose odd name was
      famous all over <lb/> the world a quarter of a century ago&mdash;Wagga-Wagga. This <lb/>
      was because the Tichborne Claimant had kept a butcher-shop <lb/> there. It was out of the
      midst of his humble collection of <lb/> sausages and tripe that he soared up into the zenith
      of notoriety <lb/> and hung there in the wastes of space a time, with the <reg
       orig="tele-|scopes">telescopes</reg>
      <lb/> of all nations leveled at him in unappeasable curiosity&mdash; <lb/> curiosity as
      to which of the two long-missing persons he was: <lb/> Arthur Orton, the mislaid roustabout of
      Wapping, or Sir Roger <lb/> Tichborne, the lost heir of a name and estates as old as English
      <lb/> history. We all know now, but not a dozen people knew then; <lb/> and the dozen kept the
      mystery to themselves and allowed the <lb/> most intricate and fascinating and marvelous
      real-life romance <lb/> that has ever been played upon the world's stage to unfold <reg
       orig="it-|self">itself</reg>
      <lb/> serenely, act by act, in a British court by the long and <lb/> laborious processes of
      judicial development.</p>
     <p>When we recall the details of that great romance we <reg orig="mar-|vel">marvel</reg>
      <lb/> to see what daring chances truth may freely take in <reg orig="con-|structing"
       >constructing</reg>
      <lb/> a tale, as compared with the poor little conservative <lb/> risks permitted to fiction.
      The fiction-artist could achieve no <lb/> success with the materials of this splendid
      Tichborne romance. <lb/>
      <pb n="157" entity="DSSR_000002496_0172"/> He would have to drop out the chief characters; the
      public <lb/> would say such people are impossible. He would have to drop <lb/> out a number of
      the most picturesque incidents; the public <lb/> would say such things could never happen. And
      yet the chief <lb/> characters did exist, and the incidents did happen.</p>
     <p>It cost the Tichborne estates $400,000 to unmask the <reg orig="Claim-|ant">Claimant</reg>
      <lb/> and drive him out; and even after the exposure multitudes <lb/> of Englishmen still
      believed in him. It cost the British <reg orig="Gov-|ernment">Government</reg>
      <lb/> another $400,000 to convict him of perjury; and after <lb/> the conviction the same old
      multitudes still believed in him; and <lb/> among these believers were many educated and
      intelligent men; <lb/> and some of them had personally known the real Sir Roger. <lb/> The
      Claimant was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment. When <lb/> he got out of prison he went to
      New York and kept a whisky <lb/> saloon in the Bowery for a time, then disappeared from view.</p>
     <p>He always claimed to be Sir Roger Tichborne until death <lb/> called for him. This was but a
      few months ago&mdash;not very <lb/> much short of a generation since he left Wagga-Wagga
      to go <lb/> and possess himself of his estates. On his death-bed he yielded <lb/> up his
      secret, and confessed in writing that he was only Arthur <lb/> Orton of Wapping, able seaman
      and butcher&mdash;that and <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg>
      <lb/> more. But it is scarcely to be doubted that there are <lb/> people whom even his dying
      confession will not convince. The <lb/> old habit of assimilating incredibilities must have
      made strong <lb/> food a necessity in their case; a weaker article would probably <lb/>
      disagree with them.</p>
     <p>I was in London when the Claimant stood his trial for <reg orig="per-|jury">perjury</reg>.
      <lb/> I attended one of his showy evenings in the sumptuous <lb/> quarters provided for him
      from the purses of his adherents and <lb/> well-wishers. He was in evening dress, and I
      thought him a <lb/> rather fine and stately creature. There were about <reg
       orig="twenty-|five">twenty-five</reg>
      <lb/> gentlemen present; educated men, men moving in good <lb/> society, none of them
      commonplace; some of them were men <lb/>
      <pb n="158" entity="DSSR_000002496_0173"/> of distinction, none of them were obscurities. They
      were his <lb/> cordial friends and admirers. It was "S'r Roger," always <lb/> "S'r Roger," on
      all hands; no one withheld the title, all turned <lb/> it from the tongue with unction, and as
      if it tasted good.</p>
     <p>For many years I had had a mystery in stock. Melbourne, <lb/> and only Melbourne, could
      unriddle it for me. In 1873 I <lb/> arrived in London with my wife and young child, and
      presently <lb/> received a note from Naples signed by a name not familiar to <lb/> me. It was
      not Bascom, and it was not Henry; but I will <lb/> call it Henry Bascom for convenience's
      sake. This note, of <lb/> about six lines, was written on a strip of white paper whose <lb/>
      end-edges were ragged. I came to be familiar with those <lb/> strips in later years. Their
      size and pattern were always the <lb/> same. Their contents were usually to the same effect:
      would <lb/> I and mine come to the writer's country-place in England on <lb/> such and such a
      date, by such and such a train, and stay twelve <lb/> days and depart by such and such a train
      at the end of the <lb/> specified time? A carriage would meet us at the station.</p>
     <p>These invitations were always for a long time ahead; if we <lb/> were in Europe, three
      months ahead; if we were in America, <lb/> six to twelve months ahead. They always named the
      exact <lb/> date and train for the beginning and also for the end of the <lb/> visit.</p>
     <p>This first note invited us for a date three months in the <lb/> future. It asked us to
      arrive by the 4.10 p. m. train from <reg orig="Lon-|don">London</reg>, <lb/> August 6th. The
      carriage would be waiting. The <reg orig="car-|riage">carriage</reg>
      <lb/> would take us away seven days later&mdash;train specified. <lb/> And there were
      these words: "Speak to Tom Hughes."</p>
     <p>I showed the note to the author of "Tom Brown at <lb/> Rugby," and he said:&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Accept, and be thankful."</p>
     <p>He described Mr. Bascom as being a man of genius, a man <lb/> of fine attainments, a choice
      man in every way, a rare and <lb/>
      <pb n="159" entity="DSSR_000002496_0174"/> beautiful character. He said that Bascom Hall was a
       <reg orig="particu-|larly">particularly</reg>
      <lb/> fine example of the stately manorial mansion of <reg orig="Eliza-|beth's">Elizabeth's</reg>
      <lb/> days, and that it was a house worth going a long way <lb/> to see&mdash;like
      Knowle; that Mr. B. was of a social disposition, <lb/> liked the company of agreeable people,
      and always had samples <lb/> of the sort coming and going.</p>
     <p>We paid the visit. We paid others, in later years&mdash;the last <lb/> one in 1879.
      Soon after that Mr. Bascom started on a voyage <lb/> around the world in a steam
      yacht&mdash;a long and leisurely trip, <lb/> for he was making collections, in all lands,
      of birds, <reg orig="butter-|flies">butterflies</reg>, <lb/> and such things.</p>
     <p>The day that President Garfield was shot by the assassin <lb/> Guiteau, we were at a little
      watering place on Long Island <lb/> Sound; and in the mail matter of that day came a letter
      with <lb/> the Melbourne post-mark on it. It was for my wife, but I <lb/> recognized Mr.
      Bascom's handwriting on the envelope, and <lb/> opened it. It was the usual note&mdash;as
      to paucity of lines <lb/> &mdash;and was written on the customary strip of paper; but
      there <lb/> was nothing usual about the contents. The note informed my <lb/> wife that if it
      would be any assuagement of her grief to know <lb/> that her husband's lecture-tour in
      Australia was a satisfactory <lb/> venture from the beginning to the end, he, the writer,
      could <lb/> testify that such was the case; also, that her husband's <reg orig="un-|timely"
       >untimely</reg>
      <lb/> death had been mourned by all classes, as she would <lb/> already know by the press
      telegrams, long before the reception <lb/> of this note; that the funeral was attended by the
      officials of <lb/> the colonial and city governments; and that while he, the <lb/> writer, her
      friend and mine, had not reached Melbourne in time <lb/> to see the body, he had at least had
      the sad privilege of acting <lb/> as one of the pall-bearers. Signed, "Henry Bascom."</p>
     <p>My first thought was, why didn't he have the coffin opened? <lb/> He would have seen that
      the corpse was an imposter, and he <lb/> could have gone right ahead and dried up the most of
      those <lb/>
      <pb n="160" entity="DSSR_000002496_0175"/> tears, and comforted those sorrowing governments,
      and sold the <lb/> remains and sent me the money.</p>
     <p>I did nothing about the matter. I had set the law after <lb/> living lecture-doubles of mine
      a couple of times in America, <lb/> and the law had not been able to catch them; others in my
      <lb/> trade had tried to catch <hi rend="italic">their</hi> impostor-doubles and had failed.
      <lb/> Then where was the use in harrying a ghost? None&mdash;and so <lb/> I did not
      disturb it. I had a curiosity to know about that <lb/> man's lecture-tour and last moments,
      but that could wait. <lb/> When I should see Mr. Bascom he would tell me all about it. <lb/>
      But he passed from life, and I never saw him again. My <lb/> curiosity faded away.</p>
     <p>However, when I found that I was going to Australia it <reg orig="re-|vived">revived</reg>.
      <lb/> And naturally: for if the people should say that I was <lb/> a dull, poor thing compared
      to what I was before I died, it <lb/> would have a bad effect on business. Well, to my
      surprise the <lb/> Sydney journalists had <hi rend="italic">never heard of that impostor!</hi>
      I <lb/> pressed them, but they were firm&mdash;they had never heard of <lb/> him, and
      didn't believe in him.</p>
     <p>I could not understand it; still, I thought it would all <lb/> come right in Melbourne. The
      government would remember; <lb/> and the other mourners. At the supper of the Institute of
      <lb/> Journalists I should find out all about the matter. But no&mdash; <lb/> it turned
      out that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> had never heard of it.</p>
     <p>So my mystery was a mystery still. It was a great <reg orig="disap-|pointment"
       >disappointment</reg>. <lb/> I believed it would never be cleared up&mdash;in this <lb/>
      life&mdash;so I dropped it out of my mind.</p>
     <p>But at last! just when I was least expecting it&mdash;</p>
     <p>However, this is not the place for the rest of it; I shall <lb/> come to the matter again,
      in a far-distant chapter.</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">Melbourne</hi> spreads around over an immense area of <lb/> ground. It
      is a stately city architecturally as well <lb/> as in magnitude. It has an elaborate system of
      <lb/> cable-car service; it has museums, and colleges, and schools, <lb/> and public gardens,
      and electricity, and gas, and libraries, and <lb/> theaters, and mining centers, and wool
      centers, and centers of <lb/> the arts and sciences, and boards of trade, and ships, and <reg
       orig="rail-|roads">railroads</reg>, <lb/> and a harbor, and social clubs, and journalistic
      clubs, <lb/> and racing clubs, and a squatter club sumptuously housed and <lb/> appointed, and
      as many churches and banks as can make a <lb/> living. In a word, it is equipped with
      everything that goes to <lb/> make the modern great city. It is the largest city of <reg
       orig="Austra-|lasia">Australasia</reg>, <lb/> and fills the post with honor and credit. It
      has one <reg orig="spe-|cialty">specialty</reg>; <lb/> this must not be jumbled in with those
      other things. <lb/> It is the mitred Metropolitan of the Horse-Racing Cult. Its <lb/>
      raceground is the Mecca of Australasia. On the great annual <lb/> day of
      sacrifice&mdash;the 5th of November, Guy Fawkes's Day&mdash; <lb/> business is
      suspended over a stretch of land and sea as wide as <lb/> from New York to San Francisco, and
      deeper than from the <lb/> northern lakes to the Gulf of Mexico; and every man and <lb/>
      woman, of high degree or low, who can afford the expense, <lb/> put away their other duties
      and come. They begin to swarm <lb/> in by ship and rail a fortnight before the day, and they
      swarm <lb/> thicker and thicker day, after day, until all the vehicles of <lb/>
      <pb n="162" entity="DSSR_000002496_0177"/> transportation are taxed to their uttermost to meet
      the <reg orig="de-|mands">demands</reg>
      <lb/> of the occasion, and all hotels and lodgings are bulging <lb/> outward because of the
      pressure from within. They come a <lb/> hundred thousand strong, as all the best authorities
      say, and <lb/> they pack the spacious grounds and grand-stands and make a <lb/> spectacle such
      as is never to be seen in Australasia elsewhere.</p>
     <p>It is the "Melbourne Cup" that brings this multitude <lb/> together. Their clothes have been
      ordered long ago, at <reg orig="unlim-|ited">unlimited</reg>
      <lb/> cost, and without bounds as to beauty and magnificence, <lb/> and have been kept in
      concealment until now, for unto this <lb/> day are they consecrate. I am speaking of the <hi
       rend="italic">ladies'</hi> clothes; <lb/> but one might know that.</p>
     <p>And so the grand-stands make a brilliant and wonderful <lb/> spectacle, a delirium of color,
      a vision of beauty. The <reg orig="cham-|pagne">champagne</reg>
      <lb/> flows, everybody is vivacious, excited, happy; <reg orig="every-|body">everybody</reg>
      <lb/> bets, and gloves and fortunes change hands right along, <lb/> all the time. Day after
      day the races go on, and the fun and <lb/> the excitement are kept at white heat; and when
      each day is <lb/> done, the people dance all night so as to be fresh for the race <lb/> in the
      morning. And at the end of the great week the swarms <lb/> secure lodgings and transportation
      for next year, then flock <lb/> away to their remote homes and count their gains and losses,
      <lb/> and order next year's Cup-clothes, and then lie down and sleep <lb/> two weeks, and get
      up sorry to reflect that a whole year must <lb/> be put in somehow or other before they can be
      wholly happy <lb/> again.</p>
     <p>The Melbourne Cup is the Australasian National Day. It <lb/> would be difficult to overstate
      its importance. It overshadows <lb/> all other holidays and specialized days of whatever sort
      in that <lb/> congeries of colonies. Overshadows them? I might almost <lb/> say it blots them
      out. Each of them gets attention, but not <lb/> everybody's; each of them evokes interest, but
      not <reg orig="every-|body's">everybody's</reg>; <lb/> each of them rouses enthusiasm, but not
      everybody's; <lb/>
      <pb n="163" entity="DSSR_000002496_0178"/> in each case a part of the attention, interest, and
      enthusiasm is <lb/> a matter of habit and custom, and another part of it is official <lb/> and
      perfunctory. Cup Day, and Cup Day only, commands an <lb/> attention, an interest, and an
      enthusiasm which are universal <lb/> &mdash;and spontaneous, not perfunctory. Cup Day is
      supreme&mdash; <lb/> it has no rival. I can call to mind no specialized annual day, <lb/>
      in any country, which can be named by that large name&mdash; <lb/> Supreme. I can call to
      mind no specialized annual day, in any <lb/> country, whose approach fires the whole land with
      a <reg orig="confla-|gration">conflagration</reg>
      <lb/> of conversation and preparation and anticipation and <lb/> jubilation. No day save this
      one; but this one does it.</p>
     <p>In America we have no annual supreme day; no day whose <lb/> approach makes the whole nation
      glad. We have the Fourth <lb/> of July, and Christmas, and Thanksgiving. Neither of them <lb/>
      can claim the primacy; neither of them can arouse an <reg orig="enthu-|siasm">enthusiasm</reg>
      <lb/> which comes near to being universal. Eight grown <lb/> Americans out of ten dread the
      coming of the Fourth, with its <lb/> pandemonium and its perils, and they rejoice when it is
      gone <lb/> &mdash;if still alive. The approach of Christmas brings <reg
       orig="harrass-|ment">harrassment</reg>
      <lb/> and dread to many excellent people. They have to buy <lb/> a cart-load of presents, and
      they never know what to buy to <lb/> hit the various tastes; they put in three weeks of hard
      and <lb/> anxious work, and when Christmas morning comes they are so <lb/> dissatisfied with
      the result, and so disappointed that they want <lb/> to sit down and cry. Then they give
      thanks that Christmas <lb/> comes but once a year. The observance of Thanksgiving Day <lb/>
      &mdash;as a function&mdash;has become general of late years. The <lb/> Thankfulness
      is not so general. This is natural. Two-thirds <lb/> of the nation have always had hard luck
      and a hard time <lb/> during the year, and this has a calming effect upon their <reg
       orig="en-|thusiasm">enthusiasm</reg>.</p>
     <p>We <hi rend="italic">have</hi> a supreme day&mdash;a sweeping and tremendous and <lb/>
      tumultuous day, a day which commands an absolute <reg orig="univer-|sality">universality</reg>
      <lb/>
      <pb n="164" entity="DSSR_000002496_0179"/> of interest and excitement; but it is not annual.
      It <lb/> comes but once in four years; therefore it cannot count as a <lb/> rival of the
      Melbourne Cup.</p>
     <p>In Great Britain and Ireland they have two great days&mdash; <lb/> Christmas and the
      Queen's birthday. But they are equally <lb/> popular; there is no supremacy.</p>
     <p>I think it must be conceded that the position of the <reg orig="Aus-|tralasian">Australasian</reg>
      <lb/> Day is unique, solitary, unfellowed; and likely to <lb/> hold that high place a long
      time.</p>
     <p>The next things which interest us when we travel are, first, <lb/> the people; next, the
      novelties; and finally the history of the <lb/> places and countries visited. Novelties are
      rare in cities which <lb/> represent the most advanced civilization of the modern day. <lb/>
      When one is familiar with such cities in the other parts of the <lb/> world he is in effect
      familiar with the cities of Australasia. The <lb/> outside aspects will furnish little that is
      new. There will be <lb/> new names, but the things which they represent will <reg
       orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg>
      <lb/> be found to be less new than their names. There may <lb/> be shades of difference, but
      these can easily be too fine for <lb/> detection by the incompetent eye of the passing
      stranger. In <lb/> the larrikin he will not be able to discover a new species, but <lb/> only
      an old one met elsewhere, and variously called loafer, <lb/> rough, tough, bummer, or
      blatherskite, according to his <reg orig="geo-|graphical">geographical</reg>
      <lb/> distribution. The larrikin differs by a shade from <lb/> those others, in that he is
      more sociable toward the stranger <lb/> than they, more kindly disposed, more hospitable, more
      hearty, <lb/> more friendly. At least it seemed so to me, and I had <reg orig="op-|portunity"
       >opportunity</reg>
      <lb/> to observe. In Sydney, at least. In Melbourne I <lb/> had to drive to and from the
      lecture-theater, but in Sydney I <lb/> was able to walk both ways, and did it. Every night, on
      my <lb/> way home at ten, or a quarter past, I found the larrikin grouped <lb/> in
      considerable force at several of the street corners, and he <lb/> always gave me this pleasant
      salutation:</p>

     <p>"Hello, Mark!"</p>
     <p>"Here's to you, old chap!"</p>
     <p>"Say&mdash;Mark!&mdash;is he dead?&mdash;a reference to a passage in <lb/>
      some book of mine, though I did not detect, at that time, that <lb/> that was its source. And
      I didn't detect it afterward in <reg orig="Mel-|bourne">Melbourne</reg>, <lb/> when I came on
      the stage for the first time, and the <lb/> same question was dropped down upon me from the
      dizzy <lb/> height of the gallery. It is always difficult to answer a <reg orig="sud-|den"
       >sudden</reg>
      <lb/> inquiry like that, when you have come unprepared and <lb/> don't know what it means. I
      will remark here&mdash;if it is not <lb/> an indecorum&mdash;that the welcome which
      an American lecturer <lb/> gets from a British colonial audience is a thing which will <lb/>
      move him to his deepest deeps, and veil his sight and break his <lb/> voice. And from Winnipeg
      to Africa, experience will teach <lb/> him nothing; he will never learn to expect it, it will
      catch him <lb/> as a surprise each time. The war-cloud hanging black over <lb/> England and
      America made no trouble for me. I was a <lb/> prospective prisoner of war, but at dinners,
      suppers, on the <lb/> platform, and elsewhere, there was never anything to remind <lb/> me of
      it. This was hospitality of the right metal, and would <lb/> have been prominently lacking in
      some countries, in the <reg orig="cir-|cumstances">circumstances</reg>.</p>
     <p>And speaking of the war-flurry, it seemed to me to bring <lb/> to light the unexpected, in a
      detail or two. It seemed to <reg orig="rele-|gate">relegate</reg>
      <lb/> the war-talk to the politicians on both sides of the water; <lb/> whereas whenever a
      prospective war between two nations had <lb/> been in the air theretofore, the public had done
      most of the <lb/> talking and the bitterest. The attitude of the newspapers was <lb/> new
      also. I speak of those of Australasia and India, for I <lb/> had access to those only. They
      treated the subject <reg orig="argumenta-|tively">argumentatively</reg>
      <lb/> and with dignity, not with spite and anger. That was <lb/> a new spirit, too, and not
      learned of the French and German <lb/> press, either before Sedan or since. I heard many
      public <lb/>
      <pb n="168" entity="DSSR_000002496_0183"/> speeches, and they reflected the moderation of the
      journals. <lb/> The outlook is that the English-speaking race will dominate <lb/> the earth a
      hundred years from now, if its sections do not get <lb/> to fighting each other. It would be a

      <lb/> by baffling and retarding wars when arbitration would <lb/> settle their differences so
      much better and also so much more <lb/> definitely.</p>
     <p>No, as I have suggested, novelties are rare in the great <reg orig="cap-|itals">capitals</reg>
      <lb/> of modern times. Even the wool exchange in Melbourne <lb/> could not be told from the
      familiar stock exchange of other <lb/> countries. Wool brokers are just like stockbrokers;
      they all <lb/> bounce from their seats and put up their hands and yell in <lb/>
      unison&mdash;no stranger can tell what&mdash;and the president calmly <lb/>
      says&mdash;"Sold to Smith &amp; Co., threppence
      farthing&mdash;next!"&mdash; <lb/> when probably nothing of the kind happened; for
      how should <lb/> he know?</p>
     <p>In the museums you will find acres of the most strange and <lb/> fascinating things; but all
      museums are fascinating, and they <lb/> do so tire your eyes, and break your back, and burn
      out your <lb/> vitalities with their consuming interest. You always say you <lb/> will never
      go again, but you do go. The palaces of the rich, <lb/> in Melbourne, are much like the
      palaces of the rich in America, <lb/> and the life in them is the same; but there the
      resemblance <lb/> ends. The grounds surrounding the American palace are not <lb/> often large,
      and not often beautiful, but in the Melbourne case <lb/> the grounds are often ducally
      spacious, and the climate and <lb/> the gardeners together make them as beautiful as a dream.
      It <lb/> is said that some of the country seats have grounds&mdash;domains <lb/>
      &mdash;about them which rival in charm and magnitude those which <lb/> surround the
      country mansion of an English lord; but I was <lb/> not out in the country; I had my hands
      full in town.</p>
     <p>And what was the origin of this majestic city and its <lb/> efflorescence of palatial town
      houses and country seats? Its <lb/>
      <pb n="169" entity="DSSR_000002496_0184"/> first brick was laid and its first house built by a
      passing convict. <lb/> Australian history is almost always picturesque; indeed, it <lb/> is so
      curious and strange, that it is itself the chiefest novelty the <lb/> country has to offer,
      and so it pushes the other novelties into <lb/> second and third place. It does not read like
      history, but like <lb/> the most beautiful lies. And all of a fresh new sort, no mouldy <lb/>
      old stale ones. It is full of surprises, and adventures, and <lb/> incongruities, and
      contradictions, and incredibilities; but they <lb/> are all true, they all happened.</p>

      territory, population, and trade, it requires a stern <lb/> exercise of faith to believe in
      the figures which <lb/> represent Australasia's contribution to the Empire's commercial <lb/>
      grandeur. As compared with the landed estate of the British <lb/> Empire, the landed estate
      dominated by any other Power <lb/> except one&mdash;Russia&mdash;is not very
      impressive for size. My <lb/> authorities make the British Empire not much short of a <lb/>
      fourth larger than the Russian Empire. Roughly <reg orig="pro-|portioned">proportioned</reg>,
      <lb/> if you will allow your entire hand to represent <lb/> the British Empire, you may then
      cut off the fingers a trifle <lb/> above the middle joint of the middle finger, and what is
      left <lb/> of the hand will represent Russia. The populations ruled by <lb/> Great Britain and
      China are about the same&mdash;400,000,000 <lb/> each. No other Power approaches these
      figures. Even <lb/> Russia is left far behind.</p>
     <p>The population of Australasia&mdash;4,000,000&mdash;sinks into <lb/> nothingness,
      and is lost from sight in that British ocean of <lb/> 400,000,000. Yet the statistics indicate
      that it rises again and <lb/> shows up very conspicuously when its share of the Empire's <lb/>
      commerce is the matter under consideration. The value of <lb/> England's annual exports and

      </note> Now, here are some faith-straining figures:</p>
     <p>Indian production (300,000,000 population), $500,000,000.</p>
     <p>Australasian production (4,000,000 population), $300,000,000.</p>
     <p>That is to say, the product of the individual Indian, <lb/> annually (for export
      some whither), is worth $1.75: that of the <lb/> individual Australasian
      (for export some whither), $75! Or, <lb/> to put it in another way, the
      Indian family of man and wife <lb/> and three children sends away an annual result worth
      $8.75, <lb/> while the Australasian family sends away $375 worth.</p>
     <p>There are trustworthy statistics furnished by Sir Richard <lb/> Temple and others, which
      show that the individual Indian's <lb/> whole annual product, both for export and home use, is
      worth <lb/> in gold only $7.50; or, $37.50 for the family-aggregate. <lb/> Ciphered out on a
      like ratio of multiplication, the Australasian <lb/> family's aggregate production would be
      nearly $1,600. Truly, <lb/> nothing is so astonishing as figures, if they once get started.</p>
     <p>We left Melbourne by rail for Adelaide, the capital of the <lb/> vast Province of South
      Australia a seventeen-hour <reg orig="ex-|cursion">excursion</reg>. <lb/> On the train we
      found several Sydney friends; among <lb/> them a Judge who was going out on circuit, and was
      going to <lb/> hold court at Broken Hill, where the celebrated silver mine is. <lb/> It seemed
      a curious road to take to get to that region. Broken <lb/> Hill is close to the western border
      of New South Wales, and <lb/> Sydney is on the eastern border. A fairly straight line, 700 <lb/>
      <pb n="173" entity="DSSR_000002496_0188"/> miles long, drawn westward from Sydney, would
      strike Broken <lb/> Hill, just as a somewhat shorter one drawn west from Boston <lb/> would
      strike Buffalo. The way the Judge was traveling would <lb/> carry him over 2,000 miles by
      rail, he said; southwest from <lb/> Sydney down to Melbourne, then northward up to Adelaide,
      <lb/> then a cant back northeastward and over the border into New <lb/> South Wales once
      more&mdash;to Broken Hill. It was like going <lb/> from Boston southwest to Richmond,
      Virginia, then northwest <lb/> up to Erie, Pennsylvania, then a cant back northeast and over
      <lb/> the border&mdash;to Buffalo, New York.</p>
     <p>But the explanation was simple. Years ago the fabulously <lb/> rich silver discovery at
      Broken Hill burst suddenly upon an <lb/> unexpectant world. Its stocks started at shillings,
      and went <lb/> by leaps and bounds to the most fanciful figures. It was one of <lb/> those
      cases where the cook puts a month's wages into shares, <lb/> and comes next month and buys
      your house at your own <lb/> price, and moves into it herself; where the coachman takes a
      <lb/> few shares, and next month sets up a bank; and where the <lb/> common sailor invests the
      price of a spree, and next month <lb/> buys out the steamship company and goes into business
      on <lb/> his own hook. In a word, it was one of those excitements <lb/> which bring multitudes
      of people to a common center with a <lb/> rush, and whose needs must be supplied, and at once.
      Adelaide <lb/> was close by, Sydney was far away. Adelaide threw a short <lb/> railway across
      the border before Sydney had time to arrange <lb/> for a long one; it was not worth while for
      Sydney to arrange <lb/> at all. The whole vast trade-profit of Broken Hill fell into <lb/>
      Adelaide's hands, irrevocably. New South Wales furnishes <lb/> law for Broken Hill and sends
      her Judges 2,000 miles&mdash;mainly <lb/> through alien countries&mdash;to
      administer it, but Adelaide takes <lb/> the dividends and makes no moan.</p>
     <p>We started at 4.20 in the afternoon, and moved across level <lb/> plains until night. In the
      morning we had a stretch of <lb/>
      <pb n="174" entity="DSSR_000002496_0189"/> "scrub" country&mdash;the kind of thing which
      is so useful to the <lb/> Australian novelist. In the scrub the hostile aboriginal lurks,
      <lb/> and flits mysteriously about, slipping out from time to time <lb/> to surprise and
      slaughter the settler; then slipping back again, <lb/> and leaving no track that the white man
      can follow. In the <lb/> scrub the novelist's heroine gets lost, search fails of result; <lb/>
      she wanders here and there, and finally sinks down exhausted <lb/> and unconscious, and the
      searchers pass within a yard or two <lb/> of her, not suspecting that she is near, and by and
      by some <lb/> rambler finds her bones and the pathetic diary which she had <lb/> scribbled
      with her failing hand and left behind. Nobody can <lb/> find a lost heroine in the scrub but
      the aboriginal "tracker," <lb/> and he will not lend himself to the scheme if it will
      interfere <lb/> with the novelist's plot. The scrub stretches miles and miles <lb/> in all
      directions, and looks like a level roof of bush-tops <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg>
      <lb/> a break or a crack in it&mdash;as seamless as a blanket, to all <lb/> appearance.
      One might as well walk under water and hope <lb/> to guess out a route and stick to it, I
      should think. Yet it is <lb/> claimed that the aboriginal "tracker" was able to hunt out <lb/>
      people lost in the scrub. Also in the "bush"; also in the <lb/> desert; and even follow them
      over patches of bare rocks and <lb/> over alluvial ground which had to all appearance been
      washed <lb/> clear of footprints.</p>
     <p>From reading Australian books and talking with the <reg orig="peo-|ple">people</reg>, <lb/>
      I became convinced that the aboriginal tracker's <reg orig="perform-|ances">performances</reg>
      <lb/> evince a craft, a penetration, a luminous sagacity, and a <lb/> minuteness and accuracy
      of observation in the matter of <reg orig="de-|tective-work">detective-work</reg>
      <lb/> not found in nearly so remarkable a degree in <lb/> any other people, white or colored.
      In an official account of <lb/> the blacks of Australia published by the government of <reg
       orig="Vic-|toria">Victoria</reg>, <lb/> one reads that the aboriginal not only notices the
      faint <lb/> marks left on the bark of a tree by the claws of a climbing <lb/>
      <pb n="175" entity="DSSR_000002496_0190"/> opossum, but knows in some way or other whether the
      marks <lb/> were made to-day or yesterday.</p>

      <p>A TEST CASE.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>And there is the case, on record, where A., a settler, makes <lb/> a bet with B., that B.
      may lose a cow as effectually as he can, <lb/> and A. will produce an aboriginal who will find
      her. B. <lb/> selects a cow and lets the tracker see the <lb/> cow's footprint, then be put
      under guard. B. <lb/> then drives the cow a few miles over a course <lb/> which drifts in all
      directions, and frequently <lb/> doubles back upon itself; and he selects <reg
       orig="diffi-|cult">difficult</reg>
      <lb/> ground all the time, and once or twice <lb/> even drives the cow through herds of other
      <lb/> cows, and mingles her tracks in the wide <lb/> confusion of theirs. He finally brings
      his <lb/> cow home; the aboriginal is set at liberty, <lb/> and at once moves around in a
      great circle, <lb/> examining all cow-tracks until he finds the <lb/> one he is after; then
      sets off and follows it <lb/> throughout its erratic <lb/> course, and ultimately <lb/> tracks
      it to the stable <lb/> where B. has hidden the <lb/> cow. Now wherein <lb/> does one cow-track
       <reg orig="dif-|fer">differ</reg>
      <lb/> from another? There <lb/> must be a difference, or <lb/> the tracker could not have
      performed the feat; a <reg orig="differ-|ence">difference</reg>
      <lb/> minute, shadowy, and not detectible by you or me, or <lb/> by the late Sherlock Holmes,
      and yet discernible by a <reg orig="mem-|ber">member</reg>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> train was now exploring a beautiful hill country, <lb/> and
      went twisting in and out through lovely little <lb/> green valleys. There were several
      varieties of <reg orig="gum-|trees">gumtrees</reg>; <lb/> among them many giants. Some of them
      were bodied <lb/> and barked like the sycamore; some were of fantastic aspect, <lb/> and
      reminded one of the quaint apple trees in Japanese <reg orig="pict-|ures">pictures</reg>.
      <lb/> And there was one peculiarly beautiful tree whose name <lb/> and breed I did not know.
      The foliage seemed to consist of <lb/> big bunches of pine-spines, the lower half of each
      bunch a rich <lb/> brown or old-gold color, the upper half a most vivid and <lb/> strenuous
      and shouting green. The effect was altogether <reg orig="be-|witching">bewitching</reg>. <lb/>
      The tree was apparently rare. I should say that <lb/> the first and last samples of it seen by
      us were not more than <lb/> half an hour apart. There was another tree of striking aspect,
      <lb/> a kind of pine, we were told. Its foliage was as fine as hair, <lb/> apparently, and its
      mass sphered itself above the naked <lb/> straight stem like an explosion of misty smoke. It
      was not a <lb/> sociable sort; it did not gather in groups or couples, but each <lb/>
      individual stood far away from its nearest neighbor. It <reg orig="scat-|tered">scattered</reg>
      <lb/> itself in this spacious and exclusive fashion about the <lb/> slopes of swelling grassy
      great knolls, and stood in the full <lb/> flood of the wonderful sunshine; and as far as you
      could see <lb/> the tree itself you could also see the ink-black blot of its <lb/> shadow on
      the shining green carpet at its feet.</p>
     <p>On some part of this railway journey we saw gorse and <lb/>
      <pb n="177" entity="DSSR_000002496_0192"/> broom&mdash;importations from
      England&mdash;and a gentleman who <lb/> came into our compartment on a visit tried to
      tell me which <lb/> was which; but as he didn't know, he had difficulty. He said <lb/> he was
      ashamed of his ignorance, but that he had never been <lb/> confronted with the question before
      during the fifty years and <lb/> more that he had spent in Australia, and so he had never <reg
       orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg>
      <lb/> to get interested in the matter. But there was no need <lb/> to be ashamed. The most of
      us have his defect. We take a <lb/> natural interest in novelties, but it is against nature to
      take an <lb/> interest in familiar things. The gorse and the broom were a <lb/> fine accent in
      the landscape. Here and there they burst out in <lb/> sudden conflagrations of vivid yellow
      against a background of <lb/> sober or sombre color, with a so startling effect as to make a
      <lb/> body catch his breath with the happy surprise of it. And <lb/> then there was the
      wattle, a native bush or tree, an inspiring <lb/> cloud of sumptuous yellow bloom. It is a
      favorite with the <lb/> Australians, and has a fine fragrance, a quality usually wanting <lb/>
      in Australian blossoms.</p>
     <p>The gentleman who enriched me with the poverty of his <lb/> information about the gorse and
      the broom told me that he <lb/> came out from England a youth of twenty and entered the <lb/>
      Province of South Australia with thirty-six shillings in his <lb/> pocket&mdash;an
      adventurer without trade, profession, or friends, <lb/> but with a clearly-defined purpose in
      his head: he would stay <lb/> until he was worth &pound;200, then go back home. He would
      allow <lb/> himself five years for the accumulation of this fortune.</p>
     <p>"That was more than fifty years ago," said he. "And here <lb/> I am, yet."</p>
     <p>As he went out at the door he met a friend, and turned and <lb/> introduced him to me, and
      the friend and I had a talk and a <lb/> smoke. I spoke of the previous conversation and said
      there <lb/> was something very pathetic about this half century of exile, <lb/> and that I
      wished the &pound;200 scheme had succeeded.</p>
     <pb n="178" entity="DSSR_000002496_0193"/>
     <p>"With <hi rend="italic">him?</hi> Oh, it did. It's not so sad a case. He is <reg
       orig="mod-|est">modest</reg>, <lb/> and he left out some of the particulars. The lad reached
      <lb/> South Australia just in time to help discover the Burra-Burra <lb/> copper mines. They
      turned out &pound;700,000 in the first three <lb/> years. Up to now they have yielded
      &pound;20,000,000. He has had <lb/> his share. Before that boy had been in the country
      two years <lb/> he could have gone home and bought a village; he could go <lb/> now and buy a
      city, I think. No, <lb/> there is nothing very pathetic about <lb/> his case. He and his
      copper arrived <lb/> at just a handy time to save South <lb/> Australia. It had got mashed
      pretty <lb/> flat under the collapse of a <lb/> land boom a while before."</p>

     </figure>
     <p>There it is again; <reg orig="pictur-|esque">picturesque</reg>
      <lb/> history&mdash;Australia's <lb/> specialty. In 1829 South Australia <lb/> hadn't a
      white man in it. In 1836 <lb/> the British Parliament erected it&mdash;still <lb/> a
      solitude&mdash;into a Province, and gave <lb/> it a governor and other governmental <lb/>
      machinery. Speculators took hold, now, <lb/> and inaugurated a vast land scheme, <lb/> and
      invited immigration, encouraging <lb/> it with lurid promises of sudden wealth. It was well
      worked <lb/> in London; and bishops, statesmen, and all sorts of people made <lb/> a rush for
      the land company's shares. Immigrants soon began <lb/> to pour into the region of Adelaide and
      select town lots and <lb/> farms in the sand and the mangrove swamps by the sea. The <lb/>
      crowds continued to come, prices of land rose high, then higher <lb/> and still higher,
      everybody was prosperous and happy, the <lb/> boom swelled into gigantic proportions. A
      village of <reg orig="sheet-|iron">sheet-iron</reg>
      <lb/> huts and clapboard sheds sprang up in the sand, and in <lb/>
      <pb n="179" entity="DSSR_000002496_0194"/> these wigwams fashion made display; richly-dressed
      ladies <lb/> played on costly pianos, London swells in evening dress and <lb/> patent-leather
      boots were abundant, and this fine society drank <lb/> champagne, and in other ways conducted
      itself in this capital <lb/> of humble sheds as it had been accustomed to do in the <reg
       orig="aristo-|cratic">aristocratic</reg>
      <lb/> quarters of the metropolis of the world. The provincial <lb/> government put up
      expensive buildings for its own use, and a <lb/> palace with gardens for the use of its
      governor. The governor <lb/> had a guard, and maintained a court. Roads, wharves, and <lb/>
      hospitals were built. All this on credit, on paper, on wind, on <lb/> inflated and fictitious
      values&mdash;on the boom's moonshine, in fact.</p>
     <p>This went on handsomely during four or five years. Then <lb/> all of a sudden came a smash.
      Bills for a huge amount drawn <lb/> by the governor upon the Treasury were dishonored, the
      land <lb/> company's credit went up in smoke, a panic followed, values <lb/> fell with a rush,
      the frightened immigrants seized their <reg orig="grip-|sacks">grip-sacks</reg>
      <lb/> and fled to other lands, leaving behind them a good <reg orig="im-|itation">imitation</reg>
      <lb/> of a solitude, where lately had been a buzzing and <lb/> populous hive of men.</p>
     <p>Adelaide was indeed almost empty; its population had <lb/> fallen to 3,000. During two years
      or more the death-trance <lb/> continued. Prospect of revival there was none; hope of it <lb/>
      ceased. Then, as suddenly as the paralysis had come, came the <lb/> resurrection from it.
      Those astonishingly rich copper mines <lb/> were discovered, and the corpse got up and danced.</p>
     <p>The wool production began to grow; grain-raising followed <lb/> &mdash;followed so
      vigorously, too, that four or five years after the <lb/> copper discovery, this little colony,
      which had had to import <lb/> its breadstuffs formerly, and pay hard prices for
      them&mdash;once <lb/> $50 a barrel for flour&mdash;had become an exporter of grain.
      <lb/> The prosperities continued. After many years Providence, <reg orig="de-|siring">desiring</reg>
      <lb/> to show especial regard for New South Wales and <reg orig="ex-|hibit">exhibit</reg>
      <lb/> a loving interest in its welfare which should certify to all <lb/>
      <pb n="180" entity="DSSR_000002496_0195"/> nations the recognition of that colony's
      conspicuous <reg orig="righteous-|ness">righteousness</reg>
      <lb/> and distinguished well-deserving, conferred upon it that <lb/> treasury of inconceivable
      riches, Broken Hill; and South <lb/> Australia went over the border and took it, giving
      thanks.</p>
     <p>Among our passengers was an American with a unique <lb/> vocation. Unique is a strong word,
      but I use it justifiably if I <lb/> did not misconceive what the American told me; for I <reg
       orig="under-|stood">understood</reg>
      <lb/> him to say that in the world there was not another man <lb/> engaged in the business
      which he was following. He was <reg orig="buy-|ing">buying</reg>
      <lb/> the kangaroo-skin crop; buying all of it, both the <reg orig="Austra-|lian">Australian</reg>
      <lb/> crop and the Tasmanian; and buying it for an American <lb/> house in New York. The
      prices were not high, as there was <lb/> no competition, but the year's aggregate of skins
      would cost <lb/> him &pound;30,000. I had had the idea that the kangaroo was about <lb/>
      extinct in Tasmania and well thinned out on the continent. <lb/> In America the skins are
      tanned and made into shoes. After <lb/> the tanning, the leather takes a new
      name&mdash;which I have <reg orig="for-|gotten&mdash;I">forgotten&mdash;I</reg>
      <lb/> only remember that the new name does not indicate <lb/> that the kangaroo furnishes the
      leather. There was a German <lb/> competition for a while, some years ago, but that has
      ceased. <lb/> The Germans failed to arrive at the secret of tanning the skins <lb/>
      successfully, and they withdrew from the business. Now then, <lb/> I suppose that I have seen
      a man whose occupation is really <reg orig="en-|titled">entitled</reg>
      <lb/> to bear that high epithet&mdash;unique. And I suppose that <lb/> there is not
      another occupation in the world that is restricted <lb/> to the hands of a sole person. I can
      think of no instance of it. <lb/> There is more than one Pope, there is more than one Emperor,
      <lb/> there is even more than one living god, walking upon the earth <lb/> and worshiped in
      all sincerity by large populations of men. <lb/> I have seen and talked with two of these
      Beings myself in <lb/> India, and I have the autograph of one of them. It can come <lb/> good,
      by and by, I reckon, if I attach it to a "permit."</p>
     <p>Approaching Adelaide we dismounted from the train, as <lb/>
      <pb n="181" entity="DSSR_000002496_0196"/> the French say, and were driven in an open carriage
      over the <lb/> hills and along their slopes to the city. It was an excursion of <lb/> an hour
      or two, and the charm of it could not be overstated, I <lb/> think. The road wound around gaps
      and gorges, and offered <lb/> all varieties of scenery and prospect&mdash;mountains,
      crags, <lb/> country homes, gardens, forests&mdash;color, color, color <reg
       orig="every-|where">everywhere</reg>, <lb/> and the air fine and fresh, the skies blue, and
      not a <lb/> shred of cloud to mar the downpour of the brilliant sunshine. <lb/> And finally
      the mountain gateway opened, and the immense <lb/> plain lay spread out below and stretching
      away into dim <reg orig="dis-|tances">distances</reg>
      <lb/> on every hand, soft and delicate and dainty and <reg orig="beauti-|ful">beautiful</reg>.
      <lb/> On its near edge reposed the city.</p>
     <p>We descended and entered. There was nothing to remind <lb/> one of the humble capital of
      huts and sheds of the long-<reg orig="van-|ished">vanished</reg>
      <lb/> day of the land-boom. No, this was a modern city, with <lb/> wide streets, compactly
      built; with fine homes everywhere, <lb/> embowered in foliage and flowers, and with imposing
      masses of <lb/> public buildings nobly grouped and architecturally beautiful.</p>
     <p>There was prosperity in the air; for another boom was on. <lb/> Providence, desiring to show
      especial regard for the <reg orig="neighbor-|ing">neighboring</reg>
      <lb/> colony on the west&mdash;called Western Australia&mdash;and <reg
       orig="ex-|hibit">exhibit</reg>
      <lb/> a loving interest in its welfare which should certify to all <lb/> nations the
      recognition of that colony's conspicuous <reg orig="righteous-|ness">righteousness</reg>
      <lb/> and distinguished well-deserving, had recently conferred <lb/> upon it that majestic
      treasury of golden riches, Coolgardie; <lb/> and now South Australia had gone around the
      corner and <lb/> taken it, giving thanks. Everything comes to him who is <lb/> patient and
      good, and waits.</p>
     <p>But South Australia deserves much, for apparently she is a <lb/> hospitable home for every
      alien who chooses to come; and for <lb/> his religion, too. She has a population, as per the
      latest census, <lb/> of only 320,000-odd, and yet her varieties of religion indicate <lb/> the
      presence within her borders of samples of people from <lb/>
      <pb n="182" entity="DSSR_000002496_0197"/> pretty nearly every part of the globe you can think
      of. <reg orig="Tabu-|lated">Tabulated</reg>, <lb/> these varieties of religion make a
      remarkable show. One <lb/> would have to go far to find its match. I copy here this <reg

     <p>About 64 roads to the other world. You see how healthy the <lb/> religious atmosphere is.
      Anything can live in it. Agnostics, <lb/> Atheists, Freethinkers, Infidels, Mormons, Pagans,
      Indefinites: <lb/> they are all there. And all the big sects of the world can do <lb/> more
      than merely live in it: they can spread, flourish, prosper. <lb/> All except the Spiritualists

       <p>The greatest heat in Victoria, that there is an authoritative record of, was at <lb/>
        Sandhurst, in January, 1862. The thermometer then registered 117 degrees in the <lb/> shade.

      <lb/> When the white man came the continent was nearly as poor, in <lb/> variety of
      vegetation, as the desert of Sahara; now it has <lb/> everything that grows on the earth. In
      fact, not Australia <lb/> only, but all Australasia has levied tribute upon the flora of <lb/>
      the rest of the world; and wherever one goes the results <reg orig="ap-|pear">appear</reg>,
      <lb/> in gardens private and public, in the woodsy walls of the <lb/> highways, and in even
      the forests. If you see a curious or <lb/> beautiful tree or bush or flower, and ask about it,
      the people, <lb/> answering, usually name a foreign country as the place of its <lb/>
      origin&mdash;India, Africa, Japan, China, England, America, Java, <lb/> Sumatra, New
      Guinea, Polynesia, and so on.</p>
     <p>In the Zo&ouml;logical Gardens of Adelaide I saw the only <reg orig="laugh-|ing"

      <lb/> jackass that ever showed any disposition to be courteous <lb/>
      <pb n="185" entity="DSSR_000002496_0200"/> to me. This one opened his head wide and laughed
      like a <lb/> demon; or like a maniac who was consumed with humorous <lb/> scorn over a cheap
      and degraded pun. It was a very human <lb/> laugh. If he had been out of sight I could have
      believed <lb/> that the laughter came from a man. It is an odd-looking bird, <lb/> with a head
      and beak that are much too large for its body. <lb/> In time man <lb/> will <reg

      <lb/> survive, <lb/> for man is his <lb/> friend and lets <lb/> him alone. <lb/> Man always

      <lb/> wild <lb/> things, human <lb/> or animal&mdash; <lb/> when he has <lb/> any. In
      this <lb/> case the bird is <lb/> spared because he kills snakes. If L. J. will take my advice
      <lb/> he will not kill all of them.</p>

      <p>LAUGHING JACKASS.</p>

     <p>In that garden I also saw the wild Australian dog&mdash;the <lb/> dingo. He was a
      beautiful creature&mdash;shapely, graceful, a <lb/> little wolfish in some of his
      aspects, but with a most friendly <lb/> eye and sociable disposition. The dingo is not an
      importation; <lb/> he was present in great force when the whites first came to the <lb/>
      <pb n="186" entity="DSSR_000002496_0201"/> continent. It may be that he is the oldest dog in
      the universe; <lb/> his origin, his descent, the place where his ancestors first <reg
       orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg>, <lb/> are as unknown and as untraceable as are the camel's.
      <lb/> He is the most precious dog in the world, for he does not bark. <lb/> But in an evil
      hour he got to raiding the sheep-runs to appease <lb/> his hunger, and that sealed his doom.
      He is hunted, now, just <lb/> as if he were a wolf. He has been sentenced to extermination,

      The world was made for man&mdash;the white man.</p>
     <p>South Australia is confusingly named. All of the colonies <lb/> have a southern exposure
      except one&mdash;Queensland. Properly <lb/> speaking, South Australia is <hi
       rend="italic">middle</hi> Australia. It extends <lb/> straight up through the center of the
      continent like the middle <lb/> board in a center-table. It is 2,000 miles high, from south to
      <lb/> north, and about a third as wide. A wee little spot down in <lb/> its southeastern
      corner contains eight or nine-tenths of its <lb/> population; the other one or two-tenths are
      elsewhere&mdash;as <lb/> elsewhere as they could be in the United States with all the
      <lb/> country between Denver and Chicago, and Canada and the <lb/> Gulf of Mexico to scatter
      over. There is plenty of room.</p>
     <p>A telegraph line stretches straight up north through that <lb/> 2,000 miles of wilderness
      and desert from Adelaide to Port <lb/> Darwin on the edge of the upper ocean. South Australia
      <lb/> built the line; and did it in 1871-2 when her population <reg orig="num-|bered">numbered</reg>
      <lb/> only 185,000. It was a great work; for there were no <lb/> roads, no paths; 1,300 miles
      of the route had been traversed <lb/> but once before by white men; provisions, wire, and
      poles had <lb/> to be carried over immense stretches of desert; wells had to be <lb/> dug
      along the route to supply the men and cattle with water.</p>
     <p>A cable had been previously laid from Port Darwin to <lb/> Java and thence to India, and
      there was telegraphic <reg orig="communi-|cation">communication</reg>
      <lb/> with England from India. And so, if Adelaide could <lb/> make connection with Port
      Darwin it meant connection with <lb/> the whole world. The enterprise succeeded. One could

     <p>I was in Adelaide again, some months later, and saw the <lb/> multitudes gather in the
      neighboring city of Glenelg to <reg orig="com-|memorate">commemorate</reg>
      <lb/> the Reading of the Proclamation&mdash;in 1836&mdash;which <lb/> founded the
      Province. If I have at any time called it a <lb/> Colony, I withdraw the discourtesy. It is
      not a Colony, it is a <lb/> Province; and officially so. Moreover, it is the only one so <lb/>
      named in Australasia. There was great enthusiasm; it was <lb/> the Province's national
      holiday, its Fourth of July, so to <lb/> speak. It is the pre-eminent holiday; and that is
      saying <lb/> much, in a country where they seem to have a most un-English <lb/> mania for
      holidays. Mainly they are workingmen's holidays; <lb/> for in South Australia the workingman
      is sovereign; his vote <lb/> is the desire of the politician&mdash;indeed, it is the very
      breath of <lb/> the politician's being; the parliament exists to deliver the will <lb/> of the
      workingman, and the government exists to execute it. <lb/> The workingman is a great power
      everywhere in Australia, <lb/> but South Australia is his paradise. He has had a hard time
      <lb/> in this world, and has earned a paradise. I am glad he has <lb/> found it. The holidays
      there are frequent enough to be bewil-</p>
     <pb n="190" entity="DSSR_000002496_0205"/>
     <p>dering to the stranger. I tried to get the hang of the system, <lb/> but was not able to do
      it.</p>
     <p>You have seen that the Province is tolerant, religious-wise. <lb/> It is so politically,
      also. One of the speakers at the <reg orig="Commem-|oration">Commemoration</reg>
      <lb/> banquet&mdash;the Minister of Public Works&mdash;was an <lb/> American, born
      and reared in New England. There is nothing <lb/> narrow about the Province, politically, or
      in any other way <lb/> that I know of. Sixty-four religions and a Yankee cabinet <lb/>
      minister. No amount of horse-racing can damn this community.</p>
     <p>The mean temperature of the Province is 62&deg;. The <reg orig="death-|rate"
       >death-rate</reg>
      <lb/> is 13 in the 1,000&mdash;about half what it is in the city of <lb/> New York, I
      should think, and New York is a healthy city. <lb/> Thirteen is the death-rate for the average
      citizen of the <reg orig="Prov-|ince">Province</reg>, <lb/> but there seems to be no
      death-rate for the old people. <lb/> There were people at the Commemoration banquet who could
      <lb/> remember Cromwell. There were six of them. These Old <lb/> Settlers had all been present
      at the original Reading of the <lb/> Proclamation, in 1836. They showed signs of the
      blightings <lb/> and blastings of time, in their outward aspect, but they were <lb/> young
      within; young and cheerful, and ready to talk; ready <lb/> to talk, and talk all you wanted;
      in their turn, and out of it. <lb/> They were down for six speeches, and they made 42. The
      <lb/> governor and the cabinet and the mayor were down for 42 <lb/> speeches, and they made 6.
      They have splendid grit, the Old <lb/> Settlers, splendid staying power. But they do not hear
      well, <lb/> and when they see the mayor going through motions which <lb/> they recognize as
      the introducing of a speaker, they think they <lb/> are the one, and they all get up together,
      and begin to respond, <lb/> in the most animated way; and the more the mayor <reg
       orig="gesticu-|lates">gesticulates</reg>, <lb/> and shouts "Sit down! Sit down!" the more
      they take <lb/> it for applause, and the more excited and reminiscent and <reg
       orig="en-|thusiastic">enthusiastic</reg>
      <lb/> they get; and next, when they see the whole house <lb/> laughing and crying, three of
      them think it is about the bitter <lb/> old-time hardships they are describing, and the other
      three</p>

      <lb/> of the vintage of 1836&mdash;and then the way <lb/> they <hi rend="italic">do</hi>

      them down into their <lb/> seats, they say, "Oh, I'm not tired&mdash;I could bang along a
      <lb/> week!" and they sit there looking simple and childlike, and <lb/> gentle, and proud of
      their oratory, and wholly unconscious of <lb/> what is going on at the other end of the room.
      And so one <lb/> of the great dignitaries gets a chance, and begins his <reg
       orig="carefully-|prepared">carefully-prepared</reg>
      <lb/> speech, impressively and with solemnity&mdash;</p>
     <p>"When we, now great and prosperous and powerful, bow our heads in <lb/> reverent wonder in

      of forethought, of&mdash;"</p>
     <p>Up come the immortal six again, in a body, with a joyous <lb/> "Hey, I've thought of another
      one!" and at it they go, with <lb/> might and main, hearing not a whisper of the pandemonium
      <lb/> that salutes them, but taking all the visible violences for <lb/> applause, as before,
      and hammering joyously away till the <reg orig="im-|ploring">imploring</reg>
      <lb/> ushers pray them into their seats again. And a pity, <lb/> too; for those lovely old
      boys did so enjoy living their heroic <lb/> youth over, in these days of their honored
      antiquity; and <reg orig="cer-|tainly">certainly</reg>
      <lb/> the things they had to tell were usually worth the <reg orig="tell-|ing">telling</reg>
      <lb/> and the hearing.</p>
     <p>It was a stirring spectacle; stirring in more ways than one, <lb/> for it was amazingly
      funny, and at the same time deeply <lb/> pathetic; for they had seen so much, these time-worn
      veterans, <lb/> and had suffered so much; and had built so strongly and well, <lb/> and laid
      the foundations of their commonwealth so deep, in <lb/> liberty and tolerance; and had lived
      to see the structure rise <lb/> to such state and dignity and hear themselves so praised for
      <lb/> their honorable work.</p>
     <p>One of these old gentlemen told me some things of interest <lb/> afterward: things about the
      aboriginals, mainly. He thought <lb/> them intelligent&mdash;remarkably so in some
      directions&mdash;and he</p>
     <pb n="194" entity="DSSR_000002496_0209"/>
     <p>said that along with their unpleasant qualities they had some <lb/> exceedingly good ones;
      and he considered it a great pity that <lb/> the race had died out. He instanced their
      invention of the <lb/> boomerang and the "weet-weet" as evidences of their <reg
       orig="bright-|ness">brightness</reg>; <lb/> and as another evidence of it he said he had
      never seen <lb/> a white man who had cleverness enough to learn to do the <lb/> miracles with
      those two toys that the aboriginals achieved. <lb/> He said that even the smartest whites had
      been obliged to <reg orig="con-|fess">confess</reg>
      <lb/> that they could not learn the trick of the boomerang in <lb/> perfection; that it had
      possibilities which they could not <lb/> master. The white man could not control its motions,
      could <lb/> not make it obey him; but the aboriginal could. He told me <lb/> some wonderful
      things&mdash;some almost incredible things&mdash; <lb/> which he had seen the blacks
      do with the boomerang and the <lb/> weet-weet. They have been confirmed to me since by other
      <lb/> early settlers and by trustworthy books.</p>
     <p>It is contended&mdash;and may be said to be conceded&mdash;that <lb/> the
      boomerang was known to certain savage tribes in Europe <lb/> in Roman times. In support of
      this, Virgil and two other <lb/> Roman poets are quoted. It is also contended that it was
      <lb/> known to the ancient Egyptians.</p>
     <p>One of two things is then apparent: <lb/> either some one with <lb/>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">From</hi> diary:</p>
     <p>Mr. G. called. I had not seen him since Nauheim, <lb/> Germany&mdash;several years ago;
      the time that the cholera <lb/> broke out at Hamburg. We talked of the people we had <lb/>
      known there, or had casually met; and G. said:</p>
     <p>"Do you remember my introducing you to an earl&mdash;the <lb/> Earl of C.?"</p>
     <p>"Yes. That was the last time I saw you. You and he <lb/> were in a carriage, just
      starting&mdash;belated&mdash;for the train. I <lb/> remember it."</p>
     <p>"I remember it too, because of a thing which happened <lb/> then which I was not looking
      for. He had told me a while <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg>, <lb/> about a remarkable and
      interesting Californian whom he <lb/> had met and who was a friend of yours, and said that if
      he <lb/> should ever meet you he would ask you for some particulars <lb/> about that
      Californian. The subject was not mentioned that <lb/> day at Nauheim, for we were hurrying
      away, and there was <lb/> no time; but the thing that surprised me was this: when I <reg
       orig="in-|troduced">introduced</reg>
      <lb/> you, you said, 'I am glad to meet your lordship&mdash; <lb/> again.' The 'again'
      was the surprise. He is a little hard of <lb/> hearing, and didn't catch that word, and I
      thought you hadn't <lb/> intended that he should. As we drove off I had only time to <lb/>
      say, 'Why, what do you know about him?' and I understood <lb/> you to say, 'Oh, nothing,
      except that he is the quickest judge</p>
     <pb n="196" entity="DSSR_000002496_0211"/>
     <p>of&mdash;' Then we were gone, and I didn't get the rest. I <reg orig="won-|dered"
       >wondered</reg>
      <lb/> what it was that he was such a quick judge of. I have <lb/> thought of it many times
      since, and still wondered what it <lb/> could be. He and I talked it over, but could not guess
      it out. <lb/> He thought it must be fox-hounds or horses, for he is a <lb/> good judge of
      those&mdash;no one is a better. But <hi rend="italic">you</hi> couldn't <lb/> know that,
      because you didn't know <hi rend="italic">him</hi>; you had mistaken him <lb/> for some one
      else; it must be that, he said, because he knew <lb/> you had never met him before. And of
      course you hadn't&mdash; <lb/> had you?"</p>
     <p>"Yes, I had."</p>
     <p>"Is that so? Where?"</p>
     <p>"At a fox-hunt, in England."</p>
     <p>"How curious that is. Why, he hadn't the least <reg orig="recollec-|tion">recollection</reg>
      <lb/> of it. Had you any conversation with him?"</p>
     <p>"Some&mdash;yes."</p>
     <p>"Well, it left not the least impression upon him. What <lb/> did you talk about?"</p>
     <p>"About the fox. I think that was all."</p>
     <p>"Why, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> would interest him; that ought to have left an <lb/>
      impression. What did <hi rend="italic">he</hi> talk about?"</p>
     <p>"The fox."</p>
     <p>"It's very curious. I don't understand it. Did what he <lb/> said leave an impression upon
      you?"</p>
     <p>"Yes. It showed me that he was a quick judge <reg orig="of&mdash;how-|ever"
       >of&mdash;however</reg>, <lb/> I will tell you all about it, then you will understand.
      It <lb/> was a quarter of a century ago&mdash;1873 or '74. I had an <reg
       orig="Amer-|ican">American</reg>
      <lb/> friend in London named F., who was fond of hunting, and <lb/> his friends the Blanks
      invited him and me to come out to a <lb/> hunt and be their guests at their country place. In
      the <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>
      <lb/> the mounts were provided, but when I saw the horses I <lb/> changed my mind and asked
      permission to walk. I had never <lb/> seen an English hunter before, and it seemed to me that
      I</p>
     <pb entity="DSSR_000002496_0212"/>

     </figure>
     <pb n="199" entity="DSSR_000002496_0214"/>
     <p>could hunt a fox safer on the ground. I had always been <reg orig="diffi-|dent">diffident</reg>
      <lb/> about horses, anyway, even those of the common <reg orig="alti-|tudes">altitudes</reg>,
      <lb/> and I did not feel competent to hunt on a horse that <lb/> went on stilts. So then Mrs.
      Blank came to my help and said <lb/> I could go with her in the dog-cart and we would drive to
      a <lb/> place she knew of, and there we should have a good glimpse of <lb/> the hunt as it
      went by.</p>
     <p>"When we got to that place I got out and went and leaned <lb/> my elbows on a low stone wall
      which enclosed a turfy and <lb/> beautiful great field with heavy wood on all its sides except
      <lb/> ours. Mrs. Blank sat in the dog-cart fifty yards away, which <lb/> was as near as she
      could get with the vehicle. I was full of <lb/> interest, for I had never seen a fox-hunt. I
      waited, dreaming <lb/> and imagining, in the deep stillness and impressive tranquility <lb/>
      which reigned in that retired spot. Presently, from away off <lb/> in the forest on the left,
      a mellow bugle-note came floating; <lb/> then all of a sudden a multitude of dogs burst out of
      that forest <lb/> and went tearing by and disappeared in the forest on the right; <lb/> there
      was a pause, and then a cloud of horsemen in black caps <lb/> and crimson coats plunged out of
      the left-hand forest and went <lb/> flaming across the field like a prairie-fire, a stirring
      sight to <lb/> see. There was one man ahead of the rest, and he came <reg orig="spur-|ring"
       >spurring</reg>
      <lb/> straight at me. He was fiercely excited. It was fine to <lb/> see him ride; he was a
      master horseman. He came like a <lb/> storm till he was within seven feet of me, where I was
      leaning <lb/> on the wall, then he stood his horse straight up in the air on <lb/> his hind
      toe-nails, and shouted like a demon:</p>
     <p>"'Which way'd the fox go?'</p>
     <p>"I didn't much like the tone, but I did not let on; for he <lb/> was excited, you know. But
      I was calm; so I said softly, and <lb/> without acrimony:</p>
     <p>"'<hi rend="italic">Which</hi> fox?'</p>
     <pb n="200" entity="DSSR_000002496_0215"/>
     <p>"It seemed to anger him. I don't know why; and he <lb/> thundered out:</p>
     <p>"'<hi rend="italic">Which</hi> fox? Why, <hi rend="italic">the</hi> fox? Which way did the
       <hi rend="italic">fox</hi> go?'</p>
     <p>"I said, with great gentleness&mdash;even argumentatively:</p>
     <p>"'If you could be a little more definite&mdash;a little less vague <lb/>
      &mdash;because I am a stranger, and there are many foxes, as you <lb/> will know even
      better than I, and unless I know which one it <lb/> is that you desire to identify,
      and&mdash;'</p>
     <p>"'You're certainly the damdest idiot that has escaped in a <lb/> thousand years!' and he
      snatched his great horse around as <lb/> easily as I would snatch a cat, and was away like a
      hurricane. <lb/> A very excitable man.</p>
     <p>"I went back to Mrs. Blank, and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> was excited, too&mdash;oh,
      <lb/> all alive. She said:</p>
     <p>"'He <hi rend="italic">spoke</hi> to you!&mdash;<hi rend="italic">didn't</hi> he?'</p>
     <p>"'Yes, it is what happened.'</p>
     <p>"'I <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> it! I couldn't hear what he said, but I <hi rend="italic"
       >knew</hi> he <lb/> spoke to you! Do you know who it was? It was Lord C.,&mdash; <lb/>
      and he is Master of the Buckhounds! Tell me&mdash;what do you <lb/> think of him?'</p>
     <p>"'Him? Well, for sizing-up a stranger, he's got the most <lb/> sudden and accurate judgment
      of any man I ever saw.'</p>
     <p>"It pleased her. I thought it would."</p>
     <p>G. got away from Nauheim just in time to escape being <lb/> shut in by the quarantine-bars
      on the frontiers; and so did we, <lb/> for we left the next day. But G. had a great deal of
      trouble <lb/> in getting by the Italian custom-house, and we should have <lb/> fared likewise
      but for the thoughtfulness of our consul-general <lb/> in Frankfort. He introduced me to the
      Italian consul-general, <lb/> and I brought away from that consulate a letter which made <lb/>
      our way smooth. It was a dozen lines merely commending me <lb/> in a general way to the
      courtesies of servants in his Italian <lb/> Majesty's service, but it was more powerful than
      it looked. In</p>
     <pb n="201" entity="DSSR_000002496_0216"/>
     <p>addition to a raft of ordinary baggage, we had six or eight <lb/> trunks which were filled
      exclusively with dutiable <reg orig="stuff&mdash;house-|hold">stuff&mdash;household</reg>
      <lb/> goods purchased in Frankfort for use in Florence, where <lb/> we had taken a house. I
      was going to ship these through by <lb/> express; but at the last moment an order went
      throughout <reg orig="Ger-|many">Germany</reg>
      <lb/> forbidding the moving of any parcels by train unless the <lb/> owner went with them.
      This was a bad outlook. We must <lb/> take these things along, and the delay sure to be caused
      by the <lb/> examination of them in the custom-house might lose us our <lb/> train. I imagined
      all sorts of terrors, and enlarged them <lb/> steadily as we approached the Italian frontier.
      We were six <lb/> in number, clogged with all that baggage, and I was courier <lb/> for the
      party&mdash;the most incapable one they ever employed.</p>
     <p>We arrived, and pressed with the crowd into the immense <lb/> custom-house, and the usual
      worries began; everybody <reg orig="crowd-|ing">crowding</reg>
      <lb/> to the counter and begging to have his baggage examined <lb/> first, and all hands
      clattering and chattering at once. It seemed <lb/> to me that I could do nothing; it would be
      better to give it all <lb/> up and go away and leave the baggage. I couldn't speak the <lb/>
      language; I should never accomplish anything. Just then a <lb/> tall handsome man in a fine
      uniform was passing by and I <lb/> knew he must be the station-master&mdash;and that
      reminded me of <lb/> my letter. I ran to him and put it into his hands. He took it <lb/> out
      of the envelope, and the moment his eye caught the royal <lb/> coat of arms printed at its
      top, he took off his cap and made a <lb/> beautiful bow to me, and said in English&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Which is your baggage? Please show it to me."</p>
     <p>I showed him the mountain. Nobody was disturbing it; <lb/> nobody was interested in it; all
      the family's attempts to get <lb/> attention to it had failed&mdash;except in the case of
      one of the trunks <lb/> containing the dutiable goods. It was just being opened. My <lb/>
      officer said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"There, let that alone! Lock it. Now chalk it. Chalk </p>
     <pb n="202" entity="DSSR_000002496_0217"/>
     <p>all of the lot. Now please come and show me the hand-<reg orig="bag-|gage">baggage</reg>."</p>
     <p>He plowed through the waiting crowd, I following, to the <lb/> counter, and he gave orders
      again, in his emphatic military <lb/> way&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Chalk these. Chalk <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of them."</p>
     <p>Then he took off his cap and made that beautiful bow again, <lb/> and went his way. By this
      time these attentions had attracted <lb/> the wonder of that acre of passengers, and the
      whisper had <lb/> gone around that the royal family were present getting their <lb/> baggage
      chalked; and as we passed down in review on our way <lb/> to the door, I was conscious of a
      pervading atmosphere of envy <lb/> which gave me deep satisfaction.</p>
     <p>But soon there was an accident. My overcoat pockets were <lb/> stuffed with German cigars
      and linen packages of American <lb/> smoking tobacco, and a porter was following us around
      with <lb/> this overcoat on his arm, and gradually getting it upside down. <lb/> Just as I, in
      the rear of my family, moved by the sentinels at <lb/> the door, about three hatfuls of the
      tobacco tumbled out on the <lb/> floor. One of the soldiers pounced upon it, gathered it up in
      <lb/> his arms, pointed back whence I had come, and marched me <lb/> ahead of him past that
      long wall of passengers again&mdash;he <lb/> chattering and exulting like a devil, they
      smiling in peaceful <lb/> joy, and I trying to look as if my pride was not hurt, and as if
      <lb/> I did not mind being brought to shame before these pleased <lb/> people who had so
      lately envied me. But at heart I was <lb/> cruelly humbled.</p>
     <p>When I had been marched two-thirds of the long distance <lb/> and the misery of it was at
      the worst, the stately station-<reg orig="mas-|ter">master</reg>
      <lb/> stepped out from somewhere, and the soldier left me and <lb/> darted after him and
      overtook him; and I could see by the <lb/> soldier's excited gestures that he was betraying to
      him the <lb/> whole shabby business. The station-master was plainly very</p>

     <p>angry. He came striding down toward me, and when he was <lb/> come near he began to pour out
      a stream of indignant Italian; <lb/> then suddenly took off his hat and made that beautiful
      bow <lb/> and said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Oh, it is <hi rend="italic">you!</hi> I beg a thousands pardons! This idiot <lb/>
      here&mdash;" He turned to the exulting soldier and burst out with <lb/> a flood of
      white-hot Italian lava, and the next moment he was <lb/> bowing, and the soldier and I were
      moving in procession again <lb/> &mdash;<hi rend="italic">he</hi> in the lead and
      ashamed, this time, I with my chin up. <lb/> And so we marched by the crowd of fascinated
      passengers, and <lb/> I went forth to the train with the honors of war. Tobacco and <lb/> all.</p>

     </argument>
     <p><hi rend="small-caps">Before</hi> I saw Australia I had never heard of the <lb/> "weet-weet"
      at all. I met but few men who had seen <lb/> it thrown&mdash;at least I met but few who
      mentioned <lb/> having seen it thrown. Roughly described, it is a fat wooden <lb/> cigar with
      its butt-end fastened to a flexible twig. The whole <lb/> thing is only a couple of feet long,
      and weighs less than two <lb/> ounces. This feather&mdash;so to call it&mdash;is not
      thrown through <lb/> the air, but is flung with an underhanded throw and made to <lb/> strike
      the ground a little way in front of the thrower; then it <lb/> glances and makes a long skip;
      glances again, skips again, and <lb/> again and again, like the flat stone which a boy sends
      skating <lb/> over the water. The water is smooth, and the stone has a <lb/> good chance; so a
      strong man may make it travel fifty or <lb/> seventy-five yards; but the weet-weet has no such
      good chance, <lb/> for it strikes sand, grass, and earth in its course. Yet an <lb/> expert
      aboriginal has sent it a measured distance of <hi rend="italic">two <lb/> hundred and twenty
       yards</hi>. It would have gone even further <lb/> but it encountered rank ferns and underwood
      on its passage <lb/> and they damaged its speed. Two hundred and twenty yards; <lb/> and so
      weightless a toy&mdash;a mouse on the end of a bit of wire, <lb/> in effect; and not
      sailing through the accomodating air, but <lb/> encountering grass and sand and stuff at every
      jump. It looks <lb/> wholly impossible; but Mr. Brough Smyth saw the feat and <lb/> did the
      measuring, and set down the facts in his book about <lb/> aboriginal life, which he wrote by
      command of the Victorian <lb/> Government.</p>
     <pb n="207" entity="DSSR_000002496_0222"/>
     <p>What is the secret of the feat? No one explains. It <lb/> cannot be physical strength, for
      that could not drive such a <lb/> feather-weight any distance. It must be art. But no one <reg
       orig="ex-|plains">explains</reg>
      <lb/> what the art of it is; nor how it gets around that law <lb/> of nature which says you
      shall not throw any two-ounce thing <lb/> 220 yards, either through the air or bumping along
      the ground. <lb/> Rev. J. G. Woods says:</p>
     <p>"The distance to which the weet-weet or kangaroo-rat can be thrown is <lb/> truly
      astonishing. I have seen an Australian stand at one side of Kennington <lb/> Oval and throw
      the kangaroo-rat completely across it." (Width of <reg orig="Kenning-|ton">Kennington</reg>
      <lb/> Oval not stated.) "It darts through the air with the sharp and <reg
       orig="menac-|ing">menacing</reg>
      <lb/> hiss of a rifle-ball, its greatest height from the ground being some seven <lb/> or
      eight feet.&hellip;. . When properly thrown it looks just like a living <lb/> animal
      leaping along.&hellip;. . Its movements have a wonderful <lb/> resemblance to the long
      leaps of a kangaroo-rat fleeing in alarm, with its long <lb/> tail trailing behind it."</p>
     <p>The Old Settler said that he had seen distances made by the <lb/> weet-weet, in the early
      days, which almost convinced him that <lb/> it was as extraordinary an instrument as the
      boomerang.</p>
     <p>There must have been a large distribution of acuteness <lb/> among those naked skinny
      aboriginals, or they couldn't have <lb/> been such unapproachable trackers and boomerangers
      and <lb/> weet-weeters. It must have been race-aversion that put upon <lb/> them a good deal
      of the low-rate intellectual reputation which <lb/> they bear and have borne this long time in
      the world's estimate <lb/> of them.</p>
     <p>They were lazy&mdash;always lazy. Perhaps that was their <lb/> trouble. It is a killing
      defect. Surely they could have <reg orig="in-|vented">invented</reg>
      <lb/> and built a competent house, but they didn't. And <lb/> they could have invented and
      developed the agricultural arts, <lb/> but they didn't. They went naked and houseless, and
      lived <lb/> on fish and grubs and worms and wild fruits, and were just <lb/> plain savages,
      for all their smartness.</p>
     <p>With a country as big as the United States to live and <lb/> multiply in, and with no
      epidemic diseases among them till the</p>
     <pb n="208" entity="DSSR_000002496_0223"/>
     <p>white man came with those and his other appliances of <lb/> civilization, it is quite
      probable that there was never a day in <lb/> his history when he could muster 100,000 of his
      race in all <lb/>

       <p>THE WHITE MAN'S APPLIANCES.</p>
      </figure> Australia. He diligently and deliberately kept <reg orig="popu-|lation">population</reg>
      <lb/> down by infanticide&mdash;largely; but mainly by <lb/> certain other methods. He
      <lb/> did not need to practise <lb/> these artificialities any more <lb/> after the white man
      came. <lb/> The white man knew ways <lb/> of keeping down population <lb/> which were worth
      <lb/> several of his. The <lb/> white man knew ways <lb/> of reducing a native <lb/>
      population 80 per <lb/> cent. in 20 years. The <lb/> native had never seen anything as fine as
      that before.</p>
     <p>For example, there is the case of the country now called <lb/> Victoria&mdash;a country
      eighty times as large as Rhode Island, as <lb/> I have already said. By the best official
      guess there were <lb/> 4,500 aboriginals in it when the whites came along in the <lb/> middle
      of the'Thirties. Of these, 1,000 lived in Gippsland, <lb/> a patch of territory the size of
      fifteen or sixteen Rhode Islands: <lb/> they did not diminish as fast as some of the other
      communities; <lb/> indeed, at the end of forty years there were still 200 of them <lb/> left.
      The Geelong tribe diminished more satisfactorily: from <lb/> 173 persons it faded to 34 in
      twenty years; at the end of <lb/> another twenty the tribe numbered one person altogether.
      <lb/> The two Melbourne tribes could muster almost 300 when the <lb/> white man came; they
      could muster but twenty, thirty-seven <lb/> years later, in 1875. In that year there were
      still odds and <lb/> ends of tribes scattered about the colony of Victoria, but I</p>
     <pb n="209" entity="DSSR_000002496_0224"/>
     <p>was told that natives of full blood are very scarce now. It is <lb/> said that the
      aboriginals continue in some force in the huge <lb/> territory called Queensland.</p>
     <p>The early whites were not used to savages. They could <lb/> not understand the primary law
      of savage life: that if a man <lb/> do you a wrong, his whole tribe is
      responsible&mdash;each individual <lb/> of it&mdash;and you may take your change out
      of any individual <lb/> of it, without bothering to seek out the guilty one. When a <lb/>
      white killed an aboriginal, the tribe applied the ancient law, <lb/> and killed the first
      white they came across. To the whites <lb/> this was a monstrous thing. Extermination seemed
      to be the <lb/> proper medicine for such creatures as this. They did not kill <lb/> all the
      blacks, but they promptly killed enough of them to <lb/> make their own persons safe. From the
      dawn of civilization <lb/> down to this day the white man has always used that very <lb/>
      precaution. Mrs. Campbell Praed lived in Queensland, as a <lb/> child, in the early days, and
      in her "Sketches of Australian <lb/> life," we get informing pictures of the early struggles
      of the <lb/> white and the black to reform each other.</p>
     <p>Speaking of pioneer days in the mighty wilderness of <lb/> Queensland, Mrs. Praed says:</p>
     <p>"At first the natives retreated before the whites; and, except that they <lb/> every now and
      then speared a beast in one of the herds, gave little cause for <lb/> uneasiness. But, as the
      number of squatters increased, each one taking up <lb/> miles of country and bringing two or
      three men in his train, so that shepherds' <lb/> huts and stockmen's camps lay far apart, and
      defenseless in the midst of <lb/> hostile tribes, the Blacks' depredations became more
      frequent and murder <lb/> was no unusual event.</p>
     <p>"The loneliness of the Australian bush can hardly be painted in words. <lb/> Here extends
      mile after mile of primeval forest where perhaps foot of white <lb/> man has never
      trod&mdash;interminable vistas where the eucalyptus trees rear their <lb/> lofty trunks
      and spread forth their lanky limbs, from which the red gum <lb/> oozes and hangs in fantastic
      pendants like crimson stalactites; ravines along <lb/> the sides of which the long-bladed
      grass grows rankly; level untimbered <lb/> plains alternating with undulating tracts of
      pasture, here and there broken <lb/> by a stony ridge, steep gully, or dried-up creek. All
      wild, vast and desolate; <lb/> all the same monotonous gray coloring, except where the wattle,
      when in</p>
     <pb n="210" entity="DSSR_000002496_0225"/>
     <p>blossom, shows patches of feathery gold, or a belt of scrub lies green, glossy, <lb/> and
      impenetrable as Indian jungle.</p>
     <p>"The solitude seems intensified by the strange sounds of reptiles, birds, <lb/> and insects,
      and by the absence of larger creatures; of which in the <reg orig="day-|time">daytime</reg>,
      <lb/> the only audible signs are the stampede of a herd of kangaroo, or the <lb/> rustle of a
      wallabi, or a dingo stirring the grass as it creeps to its lair. But <lb/> there are the
      whirring of locusts, the demoniac chuckle of the laughing <reg orig="jack-|ass">jackass</reg>,
      <lb/> the screeching of cockatoos and parrots, the hissing of the frilled lizard, <lb/> and
      the buzzing of innumerable insects hidden under the dense undergrowth. <lb/> And then at
      night, the melancholy wailing of the curlews, the dismal howling <lb/> of dingoes, the
      discordant croaking of tree-frogs, might well shake the <lb/> nerves of the solitary watcher."</p>
     <p>That is the theater for the drama. When you comprehend <lb/> one or two other details, you
      will perceive how well suited for <lb/> trouble it was, and how loudly it invited it. The
      cattlemen's <lb/> stations were scattered over that profound wilderness miles <lb/> and miles
      apart&mdash;at each station half a dozen persons. There <lb/> was a plenty of cattle, the
      black natives were always <reg orig="ill-|nourished">ill-nourished</reg>
      <lb/> and hungry. The land belonged to <hi rend="italic">them</hi>. The <lb/> whites had not
      bought it, and couldn't buy it; for the tribes <lb/> had no chiefs, nobody in authority,
      nobody competent to sell <lb/> and convey; and the tribes themselves had no comprehension
      <lb/> of the idea of transferable ownership of land. The ousted <lb/> owners were despised by
      the white interlopers, and this opinion <lb/> was not hidden under a bushel. More promising
      materials for <lb/> a tragedy could not have been collated. Let Mrs. Praed speak:</p>
     <p>"At Nie Nie station, one dark night, the unsuspecting hut-keeper, having, <lb/> as he
      believed, secured himself against assault, was lying wrapped in his <lb/> blankets sleeping
      profoundly. The Blacks crept stealthily down the chimney <lb/> and battered in his skull while
      he slept."</p>
     <p>One could guess the whole drama from that little text. <lb/> The curtain was up. It would
      not fall until the mastership of <lb/> one party or the other was determined&mdash;and
      permanently:</p>
     <p>"There was treachery on both sides. The Blacks killed the Whites when <lb/> they found them
      defenseless, and the Whites slew the Blacks in a wholesale <lb/> and promiscuous fashion which
      offended against my childish sense of justice. </p>
     <p>&hellip;They were regarded as little above the level of brutes, and in some <lb/> cases
       <hi rend="italic">were destroyed like vermin.</hi></p>
     <pb n="211" entity="DSSR_000002496_0226"/>
     <p>"Here is an instance. A squatter, whose station was surrounded by Blacks, <lb/> whom he
      suspected to be hostile and from whom he feared an attack, parleyed <lb/> with them from his
      house-door. He told them it was Christmas-time&mdash;a time <lb/> at which all men, black
      or white, feasted; that there were flour, sugar-plums, <lb/> good things in plenty in the
      store, and that he would make for them such a <lb/> pudding as they had never dreamed
      of&mdash;a great pudding of which all might <lb/> eat and be filled. The Blacks listened
      and were lost. The pudding was <lb/> made and distributed. Next morning there was howling in
      the camp, for it <lb/> had been sweetened with sugar and arsenic!"</p>
     <p>The white man's spirit was right, but his method was <lb/> wrong. His spirit was the spirit
      which the civilized white has <lb/> always exhibited toward the savage, but the use of poison
      was <lb/> a departure from custom. True, it was merely a technical <lb/> departure, not a real
      one; still, it was a departure, and <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg>
      <lb/> a mistake, in my opinion. It was better, kinder, swifter, <lb/>

       <p>THE USUAL SPIRIT.</p>
      </figure> and much more humane than a number of the methods which <lb/> have been sanctified
      by custom, but that does not justify its <lb/> employment. That is, it does not wholly justify
      it. Its <reg orig="un-|usual">unusual</reg>
      <lb/> nature makes it stand out and attract an amount of <lb/> attention which it is not
      entitled to. It takes hold upon <lb/> morbid imaginations and they work it up into a sort of
       <reg orig="exhibi-|tion">exhibition</reg>
      <lb/> of cruelty, and this smirches the good name of our <reg orig="civiliz-|ation"
       >civilization</reg>, <lb/> whereas one of the old harsher methods would have had</p>
     <pb n="212" entity="DSSR_000002496_0227"/>
     <p>no such effect because usage has made those methods familiar <lb/> to us and innocent. In
      many countries we have chained the <lb/> savage and starved him to death; and this we do not
      care for, <lb/> because custom has inured us to it; yet a quick death by <lb/> poison is
      lovingkindness to it. In many countries we have <lb/> burned the savage at the stake; and this
      we do not care <lb/> for, because custom has inured us to it; yet a quick death <lb/> is
      lovingkindness to it. In more than one country we have <lb/> hunted the savage and his little
      children and their mother <lb/> with dogs and guns through the woods and swamps for an <lb/>
      afternoon's sport, and filled the region with happy laughter <lb/> over their sprawling and
      stumbling flight, and their wild <reg orig="sup-|plications">supplications</reg>
      <lb/> for mercy; but this method we do not mind, because <lb/> custom has inured us to it; yet
      a quick death by poison is <lb/> lovingkindness to it. In many countries we have taken the
      <lb/> savage's land from him, and made him our slave, and lashed <lb/> him every day, and
      broken his pride, and made death his only <lb/> friend, and overworked him till he dropped in
      his tracks; and <lb/> this we do not care for, because custom has inured us to it; <lb/> yet a
      quick death by poison is lovingkindness to it. In the <lb/> Matabeleland
      to-day&mdash;why, there we are confining ourselves <lb/> to sanctified custom, we
      Rhodes-Beit millionaires in South <lb/> Africa and Dukes in London; and nobody cares, because
      we <lb/> are used to the old holy customs, and all we ask is that no <lb/> notice-inviting new
      ones shall be intruded upon the attention of <lb/> our comfortable consciences. Mrs. Praed
      says of the poisoner, <lb/> "That squatter deserves to have his name handed down to the <lb/>
      contempt of posterity."</p>
     <p>I am sorry to hear her say that. I myself blame him for <lb/> one thing, and severely, but I
      stop there. I blame him for <lb/> the indiscretion of introducing a novelty which was
      calculated <lb/> to attract attention to our civilization. There was no occasion <lb/> to do
      that. It was his duty, and it is every loyal man's duty</p>
     <pb n="213" entity="DSSR_000002496_0228"/>
     <p>to protect that heritage in every way he can; and the best <lb/> way to do that is to
      attract attention elsewhere. The <reg orig="squat-|ter's">squatter's</reg>
      <lb/> judgment was bad&mdash;that is plain; but his heart was <lb/> right. He is almost
      the only pioneering representative of <lb/> civilization in history who has risen above the
      prejudices of his <lb/> caste and his heredity and tried to introduce the element of <lb/>
      mercy into the superior race's dealings with the savage. His <lb/> name is lost, and it is a
      pity; for it deserves to be handed <lb/> down to posterity with homage and reverence.</p>
     <p>This paragraph is from a London journal:</p>
     <p>"To learn what France is doing to spread the blessings of civilization in <lb/> her distant
      dependencies we may turn with advantage to New Caledonia. <lb/> With a view to attracting free
      settlers to that penal colony, M. Feillet, the <lb/> Governor, forcibly expropriated the
      Kanaka cultivators from the best of their <lb/> plantations, with a derisory compensation, in
      spite of the protests of the <lb/> Council General of the island. Such immigrants as could be
      induced to cross <lb/> the seas thus found themselves in possession of thousands of coffee,
      cocoa, <lb/> banana, and bread-fruit trees, the raising of which had cost the wretched <lb/>
      natives years of toil, whilst the latter had a few five-franc pieces to spend in <lb/> the
      liquor stores of Noumea."</p>
     <p>You observe the combination? It is robbery, humiliation, <lb/> and slow, slow murder,
      through poverty and the white man's <lb/> whisky. The savage's gentle friend, the savage's
      noble friend, <lb/> the only magnanimous and unselfish friend the savage has ever <lb/> had,
      was not there with the merciful swift release of his <reg orig="poi-|soned">poisoned</reg>
      <lb/> pudding.</p>
     <p>There are many humorous things in the world; among <lb/> them the white man's notion that he
      is less savage than the <lb/> other savages.<ref target="n213.1" n="11">*</ref>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">You</hi> notice that Mrs. Praed knows her art. She can <lb/> place a
      thing before you so that you can see it. She <lb/> is not alone in that. Australia is fertile
      in writers <lb/> whose books are faithful mirrors of the life of the country and <lb/> of its
      history. The materials were surprisingly rich, both in <lb/> quality and in mass, and Marcus
      Clarke, Ralph Boldrewood, <reg orig="Gor-|don">Gordon</reg>, <lb/> Kendall, and the others,
      have built out of them a brilliant <lb/> and vigorous literature, and one which must endure.
       <reg orig="Mate-|rials&mdash;there">Materials&mdash;there</reg>
      <lb/> is no end to them! Why, a literature might be <lb/> made out of the aboriginal all by
      himself, his character and <lb/> ways are so freckled with varieties&mdash;varieties not
      staled by <lb/> familiarity, but new to us. You do not need to invent any <lb/>
      picturesquenesses; whatever you want in that line he can <reg orig="fur-|nish">furnish</reg>
      <lb/> you; and they will not be fancies and doubtful, but <reg orig="real-|ities">realities</reg>
      <lb/> and authentic. In his history, as preserved by the white <lb/> man's official records,
      he is everything&mdash;everything that a <reg orig="hu-|man">human</reg>
      <lb/> creature can be. He covers the entire ground. He is a <lb/> coward&mdash;there are
      a thousand fact to prove it. He is brave <lb/> &mdash;there are a thousand facts to prove
      it. He is treacherous&mdash; <lb/> oh, beyond imagination! he is faithful, loyal,
      true&mdash;the white <lb/> man's records supply you with a harvest of instances of it
      that <lb/> are noble, worshipful, and pathetically beautiful. He kills the <lb/> starving
      stranger who comes begging for food and shelter&mdash; <lb/> there is proof of it. He
      succors, and feeds, and guides to <lb/> safety, to-day, the lost stranger who fired on him
      only yester-</p>
     <pb n="215" entity="DSSR_000002496_0230"/>
     <p>day&mdash;there is proof of it. He takes his reluctant bride by <lb/> force, he courts
      her with a club, then loves her faithfully <lb/> through a long life&mdash;it is of
      record. He gathers to himself <lb/> another wife by the same processes, beats and bangs her
      <lb/> as a daily diversion, and by and by lays down his life in <lb/> defending her from some
      outside harm&mdash;it is of record. <lb/> He will face a hundred hostiles to rescue one
      of his children, <lb/> and will kill another of his children because the family is large <lb/>
      enough without it. His delicate stomach turns, at certain <reg orig="de-|tails">details</reg>
      <lb/> of the white man's food; but he likes over-ripe fish, and <lb/> brazed dog, and cat, and
      rat, and will eat his own uncle with <lb/> relish. He is a sociable animal, yet he turns aside
      and hides <lb/> behind his shield when his mother-in-law goes by. He is <lb/> childishly
      afraid of ghosts and other trivialities that menace <lb/> his soul, but dread of physical pain
      is a weakness which he is <lb/> not acquainted with. He knows all the great and many of the
      <lb/> little constellations, and has names for them; he has a <reg orig="symbol-|writing"
       >symbol-writing</reg>
      <lb/> by means of which he can convey messages far and <lb/> wide among the tribes; he has a
      correct eye for form and <reg orig="ex-|pression">expression</reg>, <lb/> and draws a good
      picture; he can track a fugitive by <lb/> delicate traces which the white man's eye cannot
      discern, and <lb/> by methods which the finest white intelligence cannot <reg orig="mas-|ter"
       >master</reg>; <lb/> he makes a missile which science itself cannot duplicate <lb/> without
      the model&mdash;if with it; a missile whose secret baffled <lb/> and defeated the
      searchings and theorizings of the white <lb/> mathematicians for seventy years; and by an art
      all his own <lb/> he performs miracles with it which the white man cannot <reg
       orig="ap-|proach">approach</reg>
      <lb/> untaught, nor parallel after teaching. Within certain <lb/> limits this savage's
      intellect is the alertest and the brightest <lb/> known to history or tradition; and yet the
      poor creature was <lb/> never able to invent a counting system that would reach above <lb/>
      five, nor a vessel that he could boil water in. He is the <reg orig="prize-|curiosity"
       >prize-curiosity</reg>
      <lb/> of all the races. To all intents and purposes he is</p>
     <pb n="216" entity="DSSR_000002496_0231"/>
     <p>dead&mdash;in the body; but he has features that will live in <lb/> literature.</p>
     <p>Mr. Philip Chauncy, an officer of the Victorian <reg orig="Govern-|ment">Government</reg>,
      <lb/> contributed to its archives a report of his personal <reg orig="ob-|servations"
       >observations</reg>
      <lb/> of the aboriginals which has in it some things which <lb/> I wish to condense slightly
      and insert here. He speaks of the <lb/> quickness of their eyes and the accuracy of their
      judgment of <lb/> the direction of approaching missiles as being quite <reg
       orig="extraor-|dinary">extraordinary</reg>, <lb/> and of the answering suppleness and
      accuracy of limb <lb/> and muscle in avoiding the missile as being extraordinary also. <lb/>
      He has seen an aboriginal stand as a target for cricket-balls <lb/> thrown with great force
      ten or fifteen yards, by professional <lb/> bowlers, and successfully dodge them or parry them
      with his <lb/> shield during about half an hour. One of those balls, properly <lb/> placed,
      could have killed him; "Yet he depended, with the <lb/> utmost self-possession, on the
      quickness of his eye and his <lb/> agility."</p>
     <p>The shield was the customary war-shield of his race, and <lb/> would not be a protection to
      you or to me. It is no broader <lb/> than a stovepipe, and is about as long as a man's arm.
      The <lb/> opposing surface is not flat, but slopes away from the <reg orig="center-|line"
       >centerline</reg>
      <lb/> like a boat's bow. The difficulty about a cricket-ball that <lb/> has been thrown with a
      scientific "twist" is, that it suddenly <lb/> changes it course when it is close to its target
      and comes <lb/> straight for the mark when apparently it was going overhead <lb/> or to one
      side. I should not be able to protect myself from <lb/> such balls for half-an-hour, or less.</p>
     <p>Mr. Chauncy once saw "a little native man" throw a <reg orig="cricket-|ball">cricket-ball</reg>
      <lb/> 119 yards. This is said to beat the English professional <lb/> record by thirteen yards.</p>
     <p>We have all seen the circus-man bound into the air from a <lb/> spring-board and make a
      somersault over eight horses standing <lb/> side by side. Mr. Chauncy saw an aboriginal do it
      over eleven;</p>
     <pb n="217" entity="DSSR_000002496_0232"/>
     <p>and was assured that he had sometimes done it over fourteen. <lb/> But what is that to this:</p>
     <p>"I saw the same man leap from the <hi rend="italic">ground</hi>, and in going over he dipped
      <lb/> his head, unaided by his hands, into a hat placed in an inverted position on the <lb/>
      top of the head of another man sitting upright on horseback&mdash;both man and <lb/>
      horse being of the average size. The native landed on the other side of the <lb/> horse with
      the hat fairly on his head. The prodigious height of the leap, and <lb/> the precision with
      which it was taken so as to enable him to dip his head into <lb/> the hat, exceeded any feat
      of the kind I have ever beheld."</p>
     <p>I should think so! On board a ship lately I saw a young <lb/> Oxford athlete <hi
       rend="italic">run four steps</hi> and spring into the air and <lb/> squirm his hips by a
      side-twist over a bar that was five and <lb/> one-half feet high; but he could not have stood
      still and <lb/> cleared a bar that was <hi rend="italic">four</hi> feet high. I know this,
      because I <lb/> tried it myself.</p>
     <p>One can see now where the kangaroo learned its art.</p>
     <p>Sir George Grey and Mr. Eyre testify that the natives dug <lb/> wells fourteen or fifteen
      feet deep and two feet in diameter at <lb/> the bore&mdash;dug them in the <hi
       rend="italic">sand</hi>&mdash;wells that were "quite <reg orig="cir-|cular"
      >circular</reg>, <lb/> carried straight down, and the work beautifully <reg orig="exe-|cuted"
       >executed</reg>."</p>
     <p>Their tools were their hands and feet. How did they <lb/> throw sand out from such a depth?
      How could they stoop <lb/> down and get it, with only two feet of space to stoop in? <lb/> How
      did they keep that sand-pipe from caving in on them? <lb/> I do not know. Still, they did
      manage those seeming <reg orig="impossi-|bilities">impossibilities</reg>. <lb/> Swallowed the
      sand, may be.</p>
     <p>Mr. Chauncy speaks highly of the patience and skill and <lb/> alert intelligence of the
      native huntsman when he is stalking <lb/> the emu, the kangaroo, and other game:</p>
     <p>"As he walks through the bush his step is light, elastic, and noiseless; <lb/> every track
      on the earth catches his keen eye; a leaf, or fragment of a stick <lb/> turned, or a blade of
      grass recently bent by the tread of one of the lower <reg orig="ani-|mals">animals</reg>,
      <lb/> instantly arrests his attention; in fact, nothing escapes his quick and <lb/> powerful
      sight on the ground, in the trees, or in the distance, which may <lb/> supply him with a meal
      or warn him of danger. A little examination of the</p>
     <pb n="218" entity="DSSR_000002496_0233"/>
     <p>trunk of a tree which may be nearly covered with the scratches of opossums <lb/> ascending
      and descending is sufficient to inform him whether one <hi rend="italic">went up the <lb/>
       night before without coming down again</hi> or not."</p>
     <p>Fennimore Cooper lost his chance. He would have known <lb/> how to value these people. He
      wouldn't have traded the <reg orig="dull-|est">dullest</reg>
      <lb/> of them for the brightest Mohawk he ever invented.</p>
     <p>All savages draw outline pictures upon bark; but the <reg orig="re-|semblances">resemblances</reg>
      <lb/> are not close, and expression is usually lacking. <lb/> But the Australian aboriginal's
      pictures of animals were nicely <lb/> accurate in form, attitude, carriage; and he put spirit
      into <lb/>
      <figure id="f61" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002496_0233">
       <p>HIS PLACE IN ART.</p>
      </figure> them, and <reg orig="expres-|sion">expression</reg>. <lb/> And his <reg
       orig="pic-|tures">pictures</reg>
      <lb/> of white <reg orig="peo-|ple">people</reg>
      <lb/> and natives <lb/> were pretty nearly <lb/> as good as his <reg orig="pic-|tures"
       >pictures</reg>
      <lb/> of the other <lb/> animals. He <lb/> dressed his whites <lb/> in the fashion of <lb/>
      their day, both the <lb/> ladies and the <reg orig="gen-|tlemen">gentlemen</reg>. <lb/> As an
      untaught wielder of the pencil it is not likely <lb/> that he has had his equal among savage
      people.</p>
     <p>His place in art&mdash;as to drawing, not color-work&mdash;is well <lb/> up, all
      things considered. His art is not to be classified with <lb/> savage art at all, but on a
      plane two degrees above it and one <lb/> degree above the lowest plane of civilized art. To be
      exact, <lb/> his place in art is between Botticelli and De Maurier. That is <lb/> to say, he
      could not draw as well as De Maurier but better <lb/> than Boticelli. In feeling, he resembles
      both; also in <reg orig="group-|ing">grouping</reg>
      <lb/> and in his preferences in the matter of subjects. His <lb/> "corrobboree" of the
      Australian wilds reappears in De Mau-</p>
     <pb n="219" entity="DSSR_000002496_0234"/>
     <p>rier's Belgravian ballrooms, with clothes and the smirk of <lb/> civilization added;
      Botticelli's "Spring" is the corrobboree <lb/> further idealized, but with fewer clothes and
      more smirk. <lb/> And well enough as to intention, <hi rend="italic">but</hi>&mdash;my
      word!</p>
     <p>The aboriginal can make a fire by friction. I have tried <lb/> that.</p>
     <p>All savages are able to stand a good deal of physical pain. <lb/> The Australian aboriginal
      has this quality in a well-developed <lb/> degree. Do not read the following instances if
      horrors are not <lb/> pleasant to you. They were recorded by the Rev. Henry N. <lb/>
      Wolloston, of Melbourne, who had been a surgeon before he <lb/> became a clergyman:</p>
     <p>1. "In the summer of 1852 I started on horseback from Albany, King <lb/> George's Sound, to
      visit at Cape Riche, accompanied by a native on foot. <lb/> We traveled about forty miles the
      first day, then camped by a water-hole for <lb/> the night. After cooking and eating our
      supper, I observed the native, who <lb/> had said nothing to me on the subject, collect the
      hot embers of the fire <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg>, <lb/> and deliberately place his
      right foot in the glowing mass for a moment, <lb/> then suddenly withdraw it, stamping on the
      ground and uttering a <reg orig="long-|drawn">long-drawn</reg>
      <lb/> guttural sound of mingled pain and satisfaction. This operation he <lb/> repeated
      several times. On my inquiring the meaning of his strange conduct, <lb/> he only said, 'Me
      carpenter-make' em' ('I am mending my foot'), and then <lb/> showed me his
      charred great toe, the nail of which had been torn off by a <reg orig="tea-|tree">tea-tree</reg>
      <lb/> stump, in which it had been caught during the journey, and the pain of <lb/> which he
      had borne with stoical composure until the evening, when he had an <lb/> opportunity of
      cauterizing the wound in the primitive manner above <reg orig="de-|scribed">described</reg>."</p>
     <p>And he proceeded on the journey the next day, "as if <lb/> nothing had happened"
      &mdash;and walked thirty miles. It was a <lb/> strange idea, to keep a surgeon and then
      do his own surgery.</p>
     <p>2. "A native about twenty-five years of age once applied to me, as a <lb/> doctor, to
      extract the wooden barb of a spear, which, during a fight in the <lb/> bush some four months
      previously, had entered his chest, just missing the <lb/> heart, and penetrated the viscera to
      a considerable depth. The spear had <lb/> been cut off, leaving the barb behind, which
      continued to force its way by <lb/> muscular action gradually toward the back; and when I
      examined him I <lb/> could feel a hard substance between the ribs below the left blade-bone. I
      <lb/> made a deep incision, and with a pair of forceps extracted the barb, which <lb/> was
      made, as usual, of hard wood about four inches long and from half an inch <lb/> to an inch
      thick. It was very smooth, and partly digested, so to speak, by</p>
     <pb n="220" entity="DSSR_000002496_0235"/>
     <p>the maceration to which it had been exposed during its four months' journey <lb/> through
      the body. The wound made by the spear had long since healed, <lb/> leaving only a small
      cicatrix; and after the operation, which the native bore <lb/> without flinching, he appeared
      to suffer no pain. Indeed, judging from his <lb/> good state of health, the presence of the
      foreign matter did not materially <reg orig="an-|noy">annoy</reg>
      <lb/> him. He was perfectly well in a few days."</p>
     <p>But No. 3 is my favorite. Whenever I read it I seem to <lb/> enjoy all that the patient
      enjoyed&mdash;whatever it was:</p>
     <p>3. "Once at King George's Sound a native presented himself to me with <lb/> one leg only,
      and requested me to supply him with a wooden leg. He had <lb/> traveled in this maimed state
      about ninety-six miles, for this purpose. I <reg orig="ex-|amined">examined</reg>
      <lb/> the limb, which had been severed just below the knee, and found that <lb/> it had been
      charred by fire, while about two inches of the partially calcined <lb/>
      <figure id="f62" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002496_0235">
       <p>"NO FEELING IN IT."</p>
      </figure> bone protruded through the flesh. I at once removed this with the saw; <lb/> and
      having made as presentable a stump of it as I could, covered the <reg orig="ampu-|tated"
       >amputated</reg>
      <lb/> end of the bone with a surrounding of muscle, and kept the patient a <lb/> few days
      under my care to allow the wound to heal. On inquiring, the <reg orig="na-|tive">native</reg>
      <lb/> told me that in a fight with other blackfellows a spear had struck his leg <lb/> and
      penetrated the bone below the knee. Finding it was serious, he had <reg orig="re-|course"
       >recourse</reg>
      <lb/> to the following crude and barbarous operation, which it appears is not <lb/> uncommon
      among these people in their native state. He made a fire, and dug <lb/> a hole in the earth
      only sufficiently large to admit his leg, and deep enough to <lb/> allow the wounded part to
      be on a level with the surface of the ground. He <lb/> then <hi rend="italic">surrounded the
       limb with the live coals</hi> or charcoal, which was replenished <lb/> until the leg was
      literally burnt off. The cauterization thus applied <reg orig="com-|pletely">completely</reg>
      <lb/> checked the hemorrhage, and he was able in a day or two to hobble <lb/> down to the
      Sound, with the aid of a long stout stick, although he was more <lb/> than a week on the
      road."</p>
     <pb n="221" entity="DSSR_000002496_0236"/>
     <p>But he was a fastidious native. He soon discarded the <lb/> wooden leg made for him by the
      doctor, because "it had no <lb/> feeling in it." It must have had as much as the one he burnt
      <lb/> off, I should think.</p>
     <p>So much for the Aboriginals. It is difficult for me to let <lb/> them alone. They are
      marvelously interesting creatures. For <lb/> a quarter of a century, now, the several colonial
      governments <lb/> have housed their remnants in comfortable stations, and fed <lb/> them well
      and taken good care of them in every way. If I <lb/> had found this out while I was in
      Australia I could have seen <lb/> some of those people&mdash;but I didn't. I would walk
      thirty miles <lb/> to see a stuffed one.</p>
     <p>Australia has a slang of its own. This is a matter of <lb/> course. The vast cattle and
      sheep industries, the strange <lb/> aspects of the country, and the strange native animals,
      brute <lb/> and human, are matters which would naturally breed a local <lb/> slang. I have
      notes of this slang somewhere, but at the <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg>
      <lb/> I can call to mind only a few of the words and phrases. <lb/> They are expressive ones.
      The wide, sterile, unpeopled deserts <lb/> have created eloquent phrases like "No Man's Land"
      and the <lb/> "Never-never Country." Also this felicitous form: "She lives <lb/> in the
      Never-never Country"&mdash;that is, she is an old maid. And <lb/> this one is not without
      merit: "heifer-paddock"&mdash;young <lb/> ladies' seminary. "Bail up" and "stick
      up"&mdash;equivalent of <lb/> our highwayman-term to "hold up" a stage-coach or a train.
      <lb/> "New-chum" is the equivalent of our "tenderfoot"&mdash;new <lb/> arrival.</p>
     <p>And then there is the immortal "My word!" We must <lb/> import it. "M-y <hi rend="italic"

      unction and fervency, it is worth six of it for grace and charm <lb/> and expressiveness. Our

      how to say it. I saw it in print several times on the <lb/> Pacific Ocean, but it struck me
      coldly, it aroused no sympathy. <lb/> That was because it was the dead corpse of the thing,
      the soul <lb/> was not there&mdash;the tones were lacking&mdash;the informing spirit
      <lb/> &mdash;the deep feeling&mdash;the cloquence. But the first time I heard <lb/>
      an Australian say it, it was positively thrilling.</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> left Adelaide in due course, and went to Horsham, <lb/> in the
      colony of Victoria; a good deal of a journey, <lb/> if I remember rightly, but pleasant.
      Horsham sits <lb/> in a plain which is as level as a floor&mdash;one of those famous
      <lb/> dead levels which Australian books describe so often; gray, <lb/> bare, sombre,
      melancholy, baked, cracked, in the tedious long <lb/> drouths, but a horizonless occan of
      vivid green grass the day <lb/> after a rain. A country town, peaceful, reposeful, inviting,
      <lb/> full of snug homes, with garden plots, and plenty of shrubbery <lb/> and flowers.</p>
     <p>"<hi rend="italic">Horsham, October 17</hi>. At the hotel. The weather divine. <lb/> Across
      the way, in front of the London Bank of Australia, is a <lb/> very handsome cottonwood. It is
      in opulent leaf, and every <lb/> leaf perfect. The full power of the on-rushing spring is upon
      <lb/> it, and I imagine I can see it grow. Alongside the bank and a <lb/> little way back in
      the garden there is a row of soaring <reg orig="fountain-|sprays">fountain-sprays</reg>
      <lb/> of delicate feathery foliage quivering in the breeze, and <lb/> mottled with flashes of
      light that shift and play through the <lb/> mass like flash-lights through an
      opal&mdash;a most beautiful tree, <lb/> and a striking contrast to the cottonwood. Every
      leaf of the <lb/> cottonwood is distinctly defined&mdash;it is a kodak for faithful,
      <lb/> hard, unsentimental detail; the other an impressionist picture, <lb/> delicious to look
      upon, full of a subtle and exquisite charm, but <lb/> all details fused in a swoon of vague
      and soft loveliness."</p>
     <p>It turned out, upon inquiry, to be a pepper tree&mdash;an im-</p>
     <pb n="224" entity="DSSR_000002496_0239"/>
     <p>portation from China. It has a silky sheen, soft and rich. <lb/> I saw some that had long
      red bunches of currant-like berries <lb/> ambushed among the foliage. At a distance, in
      certain lights, <lb/> they give the tree a pinkish tint and a new charm.</p>
     <p>There is an agricultural college eight miles from Horsham. <lb/> We were driven out to it by
      its chief. The conveyance was <lb/> an open wagon; the time, noonday; no wind; the sky <reg
       orig="with-|out">without</reg>
      <lb/> a cloud, the sunshine brilliant&mdash;and the mercury at 92&deg; in <lb/>
      the shade. In some countries an indolent unsheltered drive of <lb/> an hour and a half under
      such conditions would have been a <lb/> sweltering and prostrating <reg orig="experi-|ence"
       >experience</reg>; <lb/> but there was nothing of that <lb/> in this case. It is a climate
      that <lb/> is perfect. There was no sense of <lb/> heat; indeed, there was no heat; <lb/> the
      air was fine and pure and <reg orig="exhil-|arating">exhilarating</reg>; <lb/> if the drive
      had lasted half <lb/> a day I think we should not have <lb/> felt any discomfort, or grown
      silent <lb/> or droopy or tired. Of course, the <lb/> secret of it was the exceeding <reg
       orig="dry-|ness">dryness</reg>
      <lb/> of the atmosphere. In that <lb/> plain 112&deg; in the shade is without <lb/>
      doubt no harder upon a man than is <lb/> 88&deg; or 90&deg; in New York.</p>
     <figure id="f64" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002496_0239">
      <p>A WIDE SPACE.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>The road lay through the middle <lb/> of an empty space which seemed to me to be a hundred
      yards <lb/> wide between the fences. I was not given the width in yards, <lb/> but only in
      chains and perches&mdash;and furlongs, I think. I <lb/> would have given a good deal to
      know what the width was, <lb/> but I did not pursue the matter. I think it is best to put
      <lb/> up with information the way you get it; and seem satisfied <lb/> with it, and surprised
      at it, and grateful for it, and say, "My</p>
     <pb n="225" entity="DSSR_000002496_0240"/>
     <p>word!" and never let on. It was a wide space; I could tell <lb/> you how wide, in chains and
      perches and furlongs and things, <lb/> but that would not help you any. Those things sound
      well, <lb/> but they are shadowy and indefinite, like troy weight and <lb/> avoirdupois;
      nobody knows what they mean. When you <lb/> buy a pound of a drug and the man asks you which
      you <lb/> want, troy or avoirdupois, it is best to say "Yes," and shift <lb/> the subject.</p>
     <p>They said that the wide space dates from the earliest sheep <lb/> and cattle-raising days.
      People had to drive their stock long <lb/> distances&mdash;immense
      journeys&mdash;from worn-out places to new <lb/> ones where were water and fresh
      pasturage; and this wide <lb/> space had to be left in grass and unfenced, or the stock would
      <lb/> have starved to death in the transit.</p>
     <p>On the way we saw the usual birds&mdash;the beautiful little <lb/> green parrots, the
      magpie, and some others; and also the <lb/> slender native bird of modest plumage and the
       eternally-<reg orig="for-|getable">forgetable</reg>
      <lb/> name&mdash;the bird that is the smartest among birds, and <lb/> can give a parrot
      30 to 1 in the game and then talk him to <lb/> death. I cannot recall that bird's name. I
      think it begins <lb/> with M. I wish it began with G. or something that a person <lb/> can
      remember.</p>
     <p>The magpie was out in great force, in the fields and on the <lb/> fences. He is a handsome
      large creature, with snowy white <lb/> decorations, and is a singer; he has a murmurous rich
      note that <lb/> is lovely. He was once modest, even diffident; but he lost all <lb/> that when
      he found out that he was Australia's sole musical <lb/> bird. He has talent, and cuteness, and
      impudence; and in his <lb/> tame state he is a most satisfactory pet&mdash;never coming
      when <lb/> he is called, always coming when he isn't, and studying <reg orig="dis-|obedience"
       >disobedience</reg>
      <lb/> as an accomplishment. He is not confined, but loafs <lb/> all over the house and
      grounds, like the laughing jackass. I</p>
     <pb n="226" entity="DSSR_000002496_0241"/>
     <p>think he learns to talk, I know he learns to sing tunes, and his <lb/> friends say that he
      knows how to steal without learning. I <lb/> was acquainted with a tame magpie in Melbourne.
      He had <lb/> lived in a lady's house several years, and believed he owned it. <lb/> The lady
      had tamed him, and in return he had tamed the lady. <lb/> He was always on deck when not
      wanted, always having his <lb/> own way, always tyrannizing over the dog, and always making
      <lb/> the cat's life a slow sorrow and a martyrdom. He knew a <lb/> number of tunes and could
      sing them in perfect time and <lb/> tune; and would do it, too, at any time that silence was
      wanted; <lb/> and then encore himself and do it again; but if he was asked <lb/> to sing he
      would go out and take a walk.</p>
     <p>It was long believed that fruit trees would not grow in that <lb/> baked and waterless plain
      around Horsham, but the <reg orig="agricul-|tural">agricultural</reg>
      <lb/> college has dissipated that idea. Its ample nurseries were <lb/> producing oranges,
      apricots, lemons, almonds, peaches, cherries, <lb/> 48 varieties of apples&mdash;in fact,
      all manner of fruits, and in <lb/> abundance. The trees did not seem to miss the water; they
      <lb/> were in vigorous and flourishing condition.</p>
     <p>Experiments are made with different soils, to see what <lb/> things thrive best in them and
      what climates are best for <lb/> them. A man who is ignorantly trying to produce upon his
      <lb/> farm things not suited to its soil and its other conditions can <lb/> make a journey to
      the college from anywhere in Australia, <lb/> and go back with a change of scheme which will
      make his farm <lb/> productive and profitable.</p>
     <p>There were forty pupils there&mdash;a few of them farmers, <reg orig="re-|learning"
       >relearning</reg>
      <lb/> their trade, the rest young men mainly from the <lb/> cities&mdash;novices. It
      seemed a strange thing that an <reg orig="agricul-|tural">agricultural</reg>
      <lb/> college should have an attraction for city-bred youths, <lb/> but such is the fact. They
      are good stuff, too; they are above <lb/> the agricultural average of intelligence, and they
      come without</p>
     <pb n="227" entity="DSSR_000002496_0242"/>
     <p>any inherited prejudices in favor of hoary ignorances made <lb/> sacred by long descent.</p>
     <p>The students work all day in the fields, the nurseries, and <lb/> the shearing-sheds,
      learning and doing all the practical work of <lb/> the business&mdash;three days in a
      week. On the other three they <lb/> study and hear lectures. They are taught the beginnings of
      <lb/> such sciences as bear upon agriculture&mdash;like chemistry, for <lb/> instance. We
      saw the sophomore class in sheep-shearing shear <lb/> a dozen sheep. They did it by hand, not
      with the machine. <lb/> The sheep was seized and flung down on his side and held <lb/> there;
      and the students took off his coat with great celerity <lb/> and adroitness. Sometimes they
      clipped off a sample of the <lb/> sheep, but that is customary with shearers, and they don't
      mind <lb/> it; they don't even mind it as much as the sheep. They dab a <lb/> splotch of
      sheep-dip on the place and go right ahead.</p>
     <p>The coat of wool was unbelievably thick. Before the <reg orig="shear-|ing">shearing</reg>
      <lb/> the sheep looked like the fat woman in the circus; after it <lb/> he looked like a
      bench. He was clipped to the skin; and <lb/> smoothly and uniformly. The fleece comes from him
      all in <lb/> one piece and has the spread of a blanket.</p>
     <p>The college was flying the Australian flag&mdash;the gridiron of <lb/> England smuggled
      up in the northwest corner of a big red <lb/> field that had the random stars of the Southern
      Cross <reg orig="wander-|ing">wandering</reg>
      <lb/> around over it.</p>
     <p>From Horsham we went to Stawell. By rail. Still in the <lb/> colony of Victoria. Stawell is
      in the gold-mining country. <lb/> In the bank-safe was half a peck of
      surface-gold&mdash;gold dust, <lb/> grain gold; rich; pure in fact, and pleasant to sift
      through <lb/> one's fingers; and would be pleasanter if it would stick. And <lb/> there were a
      couple of gold bricks, very heavy to handle, <lb/> and worth $7,500 a piece. They were from a
      very valuable <lb/> quartz mine; a lady owns two-thirds of it; she has an income <lb/> of
      $75,000 a month from it, and is able to keep house.</p>
     <pb n="228" entity="DSSR_000002496_0243"/>
     <p>The Stawell region is not productive of gold only; it has <lb/> great vineyards, and
      produces exceptionally fine wines. One <lb/> of these vineyards&mdash;the Great Western,
      owned by Mr. Irving <lb/> &mdash;is regarded as a model. Its product has reputation
      abroad. <lb/> It yields a choice champagne and a fine claret, and its hock <lb/> took a prize
      in France two or three years ago. The champagne <lb/> is kept in a maze of passages under
      ground, cut in the rock, to <lb/> secure it an even temperature during the three-year term
       <reg orig="re-|quired">required</reg>
      <lb/> to perfect it. In those vaults I saw 120,000 bottles of <lb/> champagne. The colony of
      Victoria has a population of <reg orig="1,000,-|000">1,000,000</reg>, <lb/> and those people
      are said to drink 25,000,000 bottles of <lb/>

       <p>THE THREE SISTERS.</p>
      </figure> champagne per year. The dryest community on the earth. <lb/> The government has
      lately reduced the duty upon foreign <lb/> wines. That is one of the unkindnesses of
      Protection. A man <lb/> invests years of work and a vast sum of money in a worthy <lb/>
      enterprise, upon the faith of existing laws; then the law is <lb/> changed, and the man is
      robbed by his own government.</p>
     <p>On the way back to Stawell we had a chance to see a group <lb/> of boulders called the Three
      Sisters&mdash;a curiosity oddly located; <lb/> for it was upon high ground, with the land
      sloping away from</p>
     <pb n="229" entity="DSSR_000002496_0244"/>
     <p>it, and no height above it from whence the boulders could have <lb/> rolled down. Relics of
      an early ice-drift, perhaps. They are <lb/> noble boulders. One of them has the size and
      smoothness and <lb/> plump sphericity of a balloon of the biggest pattern.</p>
     <p>The road led through a forest of great gum-trees, lean and <lb/> scraggy and sorrowful. The
      road was cream-white&mdash;a clayey <lb/> kind of earth, apparently. Along it toiled
      occasional freight <lb/> wagons, drawn by long double files of oxen. Those wagons <lb/> were
      going a journey of two hundred miles, I was told, and <lb/> were running a successful
      opposition to the railway! The <reg orig="rail-|ways">railways</reg>
      <lb/> are owned and run by the government.</p>
     <p>Those sad gums stood up out of the dry white clay, pictures <lb/> of patience and
      resignation. It is a tree that can get along <lb/> without water; still it is fond of
      it&mdash;ravenously so. It is a <lb/> very intelligent tree and will detect the presence
      of hidden <lb/> water at a distance of fifty feet, and send out slender long <reg
       orig="root-|fibres">root-fibres</reg>
      <lb/> to prospect it. They will find it; and will also get at it <lb/> &mdash;even
      through a cement wall six inches thick. Once a <lb/> cement water-pipe under ground at Stawell
      began to gradually <lb/> reduce its output, and finally ceased altogether to deliver <lb/>
      water. Upon examining into the matter it was found stopped <lb/> up, wadded compactly with a
      mass of root-fibres, delicate and <lb/> hair-like. How this stuff had gotten into the pipe was
      a <reg orig="puz-|zle">puzzle</reg>
      <lb/> for some little time; finally it was found that it had crept <lb/> in through a crack
      that was almost invisible to the eye. A <lb/> gum tree forty feet away had tapped the pipe and
      was <reg orig="drink-|ing">drinking</reg>
      <lb/> the water.</p>

      Consequently we saw <lb/> more sky than country on that journey. At one time a great <lb/>
      stretch of the vault was densely flecked with wee ragged-edged <lb/> flakes of painfully white
      cloud-stuff, all of one shape and size, <lb/> and equidistant apart, with narrow cracks of
      adorable blue <lb/> showing between. The whole was suggestive of a hurricane of <lb/>
      snow-flakes drifting across the skies. By and by these flakes <lb/> fused themselves together

       orig="per-|spective">perspective</reg>, <lb/> in the similitude of a stupendous
      colonnade&mdash;a mirage <lb/> without a doubt flung from the far Gates of the Hereafter.</p>
     <p>The approaches to Ballarat were beautiful. The features, <lb/> great green expanses of

     <p>Australia as are the dry places. Ninety-two in the shade again, <lb/> but balmy and
      comfortable, fresh and bracing. A perfect <lb/> climate.</p>
     <p>Forty-five years ago the site now occupied by the City of <lb/> Ballarat was a sylvan
      solitude as quiet as Eden and as lovely. <lb/> Nobody had ever heard of it. On the 25th of
      August, 1851, <lb/> the first <hi rend="italic">great</hi> gold-strike made in Australia was
      made here. <lb/> The wandering prospectors who made it scraped up two pounds <lb/> and a half
      of gold the first day&mdash;worth $600. A few days <lb/> later the place was a
      hive&mdash;a town. The news of the strike <lb/> spread everywhere in a sort of
      instantaneous way&mdash;spread <lb/> like a flash to the very ends of the earth. A
      celebrity so <lb/> prompt and so universal has hardly been paralleled in history, <lb/>
      perhaps. It was as if the name BALLARAT had suddenly <lb/> been written on the sky, where all
      the world could read it at <lb/> once.</p>
     <p>The smaller discoveries made in the colony of New South <lb/> Wales three months before had
      already started emigrants <lb/> toward Australia; they had been coming as a stream, but they
      <lb/> came as a flood, now. A hundred thousand people poured into <lb/> Melbourne from England
      and other countries in a single <lb/> month, and flocked away to the mines. The crews of the
      ships <lb/> that brought them flocked with them; the clerks in the <reg orig="gov-|ernment"
       >government</reg>
      <lb/> offices followed; so did the cooks, the maids, the <lb/> coachmen, the butlers, and the
      other domestic servants; so did <lb/> the carpenters, the smiths, the plumbers, the painters,
      the <reg orig="re-|porters">reporters</reg>, <lb/> the editors, the lawyers, the clients, the
      barkeepers, <lb/> the bummers, the blacklegs, the thieves, the loose women, the <lb/> grocers,
      the butchers, the bakers, the doctors, the druggists, <lb/> the nurses; so did the police;
      even officials of high and <lb/> hitherto envied place threw up their positions and joined the
      <lb/> procession. This roaring avalanche swept out of Melbourne <lb/> and left it desolate,
      Sunday-like, paralyzed, everything at a</p>
     <pb n="232" entity="DSSR_000002496_0247"/>
     <p>stand-still, the ships lying idle at anchor, all signs of life <reg orig="de-|parted"
       >departed</reg>, <lb/> all sounds stilled save the rasping of the cloud-shadows <lb/> as they
      scraped across the vacant streets.</p>
     <p>That grassy and leafy paradise at Ballarat was soon ripped <lb/> open, and lacerated and
      scarified and gutted, in the feverish <lb/> search for its hidden riches. There is nothing
      like <reg orig="surface-|mining">surface-mining</reg>
      <lb/> to snatch the graces and beauties and benignities out of <lb/> a paradise, and make an
      odious and repulsive spectacle of it.</p>
     <p>What fortunes were made! Immigrants got rich while the <lb/> ship unloaded and
      reloaded&mdash;and went back home for good in <lb/> the same cabin they had come out in!
      Not all of them. Only <lb/> some. I saw the others in Ballarat myself, forty-five years <lb/>
      later&mdash;what were left of them by time and death and the <reg orig="dis-|position"
       >disposition</reg>
      <lb/> to rove. They were young and gay, then; they are <lb/> patriarchal and grave, now; and
      they do not get excited any <lb/> more. They talk of the Past. They live in it. Their life is
      a <lb/> dream, a retrospection.</p>
     <p>Ballarat was a great region for "nuggets." No such <reg orig="nug-|gets">nuggets</reg>
      <lb/> were found in California as Ballarat produced. In fact, <lb/> the Ballarat region has
      yielded the largest ones known to <lb/> history. Two of them weighed about 180 pounds each,
      and <lb/> together were worth $90,000. They were offered to any poor <lb/> person who would
      shoulder them and carry them away. Gold <lb/> was so plentiful that it made people liberal
      like that.</p>
     <p>Ballarat was a swarming city of tents in the early days. <lb/> Everybody was happy, for a
      time, and apparently prosperous. <lb/> Then came trouble. The government swooped down with a
      <lb/> mining tax. And in its worst form, too; for it was not a tax <lb/> upon what the miner
      had taken out, but upon what he was <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">going</hi> to take out&mdash;if he could find it. It was a
      license-tax&mdash; <lb/> license to work his claim&mdash;and it had to be paid
      before he <lb/> could begin digging.</p>
     <p>Consider the situation. No business is so uncertain as</p>
     <pb n="233" entity="DSSR_000002496_0248"/>
     <p>surface-mining. Your claim may be good, and it may be <lb/> worthless. It may make you well
      off in a month; and then <lb/> again you may have to dig and slave for half a year, at heavy
      <lb/> expense, only to find out at last that the gold is not there in <lb/> cost-paying
      quantity, and that your time and your hard work <lb/> have been thrown away. It might be wise
      policy to advance <lb/> the miner a monthly sum to encourage him to develop the <lb/>
      country's riches; but to tax him monthly in advance instead&mdash; <lb/> why, such a
      thing was never dreamed of in America. There, <lb/> neither the claim itself nor its products,
      howsoever rich or <lb/> poor, were taxed.</p>
     <p>The Ballarat miners protested, petitioned, complained&mdash;it <lb/> was of no use; the
      government held its ground, and went on <lb/> collecting the tax. And not by pleasant methods,
      but by ways <lb/> which must have been very galling to free people. The <lb/> rumblings of a
      coming storm began to be audible.</p>
     <p>By and by there was a result; and I think it may be called <lb/> the finest thing in
      Australasian history. It was a revolution&mdash; <lb/> small in size, but great
      politically; it was a strike for liberty, a <lb/> struggle for a principle, a stand against
      injustice and <reg orig="oppres-|sion">oppression</reg>. <lb/> It was the Barons and John,
      over again; it was <reg orig="Hamp-|den">Hampden</reg>
      <lb/> and Ship-Money; it was Concord and Lexington; small <lb/> beginnings, all of them, but
      all of them great in political <lb/> results, all of them epoch-making. It is another instance
      of a <lb/> victory won by a lost battle. It adds an honorable page to <lb/> history; the
      people know it and are proud of it. They keep <lb/> green the memory of the men who fell at
      the Eureka Stockade, <lb/> and Peter Lalor has his monument.</p>
     <p>The surface-soil of Ballarat was full of gold. This soil the <lb/> miners ripped and tore
      and trenched and harried and <reg orig="disem-|bowled">disembowled</reg>, <lb/> and made it
      yield up its immense treasure. Then they <lb/> went down into the earth with deep shafts,
      seeking the gravelly <lb/> beds of ancient rivers and brooks&mdash;and found them. They</p>
     <pb n="234" entity="DSSR_000002496_0249"/>
     <p>followed the courses of these streams, and gutted them, <reg orig="send-|ing">sending</reg>
      <lb/> the gravel up in buckets to the upper world, and washing <lb/> out of it its enormous
      deposits of gold. The next biggest of <lb/> the two monster nuggets mentioned above came from
      an old <lb/> river-channel 180 feet under ground.</p>
     <p>Finally the quartz lodes were attacked. That is not <reg orig="poor-|man's">poorman's</reg>
      <lb/> mining. Quartz-mining and milling require capital, and <lb/> staying-power, and
      patience. Big companies were formed, <lb/> and for several decades, now, the lodes have been
      successfully <lb/> worked, and have yielded great wealth. Since the gold <reg
       orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg>
      <lb/> in 1853 the Ballarat mines&mdash;taking the three kinds of <lb/> mining
      together&mdash;have contributed to the world's pocket <lb/> something over <hi
       rend="italic">three hundred millions of dollars</hi>, which is to <lb/> say that this nearly
      invisible little spot on the earth's surface <lb/> has yielded about one-fourth as much gold
      in forty-four years <lb/> as all California has yielded in forty-seven. The Californian <lb/>
      aggregate, from 1848 to 1895, inclusive, as reported by the <lb/> Statistician of the United
      States Mint, is $1,265,217,217.</p>
     <p>A citizen told me a curious thing about those mines. With <lb/> all my experience of mining
      I had never heard of anything of <lb/> the sort before. The main gold reef runs about north
      and <lb/> south&mdash;of course&mdash;for that is the custom of a rich gold reef.
      <lb/> At Ballarat its course is between walls of slate. Now the <lb/> citizen told me that
      throughout a stretch of twelve miles along <lb/> the reef, the reef is crossed at intervals by
      a straight black <lb/> streak of a carbonaceous nature&mdash;a streak in the slate; a
      <lb/> streak no thicker than a pencil&mdash;and that wherever it crosses <lb/> the reef
      you will certainly find gold at the junction. It is <lb/> called the Indicator. Thirty feet on
      each side of the Indicator <lb/> (and down in the slate, of course) is a
      still finer streak&mdash;a <lb/> streak as fine as a pencil mark; and indeed, that is its
      name&mdash; <lb/> Pencil Mark. Whenever you find the Pencil Mark you know <lb/> that
      thirty feet from it is the Indicator; you measure the <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg>, <lb/>

      <pb n="237" entity="DSSR_000002496_0252"/> excavate, find the Indicator, trace it straight to
      the <lb/> reef, and sink your shaft; your fortune is made, for certain. <lb/> If that is true,
      it is curious. And it is curious any way.</p>
     <p>Ballarat is a town of only 40,000 population; and yet, since <lb/> it is in Australia, it
      has every essential of an advanced and <lb/> enlightened big city. This is pure matter of
      course. I must <lb/> stop dwelling upon these things. It is hard to keep from <lb/> dwelling
      upon them, though; for it is difficult to get away from <lb/> the surprise of it. I will let
      the other details go, this time, but <lb/> I must allow myself to mention that this little
      town has a park <lb/> of 326 acres; a flower garden of 83 acres, with an elaborate <lb/> and
      expensive fernery in it and some costly and unusually fine <lb/> statuary; and an artificial
      lake covering 600 acres, equipped <lb/> with a fleet of 200 shells, small sail boats, and
      little steam <lb/> yachts.</p>
     <p>At this point I strike out some other praiseful things which <lb/> I was tempted to add. I
      do not strike them out because they <lb/> were not true or not well said, but because I find
      them better <lb/> said by another man&mdash;and a man more competent to testify, <lb/>
      too, because he belongs on the ground, and knows. I clip them <lb/> from a chatty speech
      delivered some years ago by Mr. William <lb/> Little, who was at that time mayor of Ballarat:</p>
     <p>"The language of our citizens, in this as in other parts of Australasia, is <lb/> mostly
      healthy Anglo-Saxon, free from Americanisms, vulgarisms, and the <lb/> conflicting dialects of
      our Fatherland, and is pure enough to suit a Trench or <lb/> a Latham. Our youth, aided by
      climatic influence, are in point of physique <lb/> and comeliness unsurpassed in the Sunny
      South. Our young men are well <lb/> ordered; and our maidens, 'not stepping over the bounds of
      modesty,' are as <lb/> fair as Psyches, dispensing smiles as charming as November flowers."</p>
     <p>The closing clause has the seeming of a rather frosty <reg orig="com-|pliment"
      >compliment</reg>, <lb/> but that is apparent only, not real. November is <lb/> summer-time
      there.</p>
     <p>His compliment to the local purity of the language is <reg orig="war-|ranted"
      >warranted</reg>. <lb/> It is quite free from impurities; this is acknowledged</p>
     <pb n="238" entity="DSSR_000002496_0253"/>
     <p>far and wide. As in the German Empire all cultivated people <lb/> claim to speak Hanovarian
      German, so in Australasia all <reg orig="culti-|vated">cultivated</reg>
      <lb/> people claim to speak Ballarat English. Even in <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg>
      <lb/> this cult has made considerable progress, and now that it <lb/> is favored by the two
      great Universities, the time is not far <lb/> away when Ballarat English will come into
      general use among <lb/> the educated classes of Great Britain at large. Its great merit <lb/>
      is, that it is shorter than ordinary Englishmdash;that is, it is more <lb/> compressed. At
      first you have some difficulty in <reg orig="understand-|ing">understanding</reg>
      <lb/> it when it is spoken as rapidly as the orator whom I have <lb/> quoted speaks it. An
      illustration will show what I mean.</p>
     <p>When he called and I handed him a chair, he bowed and said:</p>
     <p>"Q."</p>
     <p>Presently, when we were lighting our cigars, he held a <lb/> match to mine and I said:</p>
     <p>"Thank you," and he said:</p>
     <p>"Km."</p>
     <p>Then I saw. Q is the end of the phrase "I thank you" <lb/> Km is the end of the phrase "You
      are welcome." Mr. Little <lb/> puts no emphasis upon either of them, but delivers them so
      <lb/> reduced that they hardly have a sound. All Ballarat English <lb/> is like that, and the
      effect is very soft and pleasant; it takes <lb/> all the hardness and harshness out of our
      tongue and gives to <lb/> it a delicate whispery and vanishing cadence which charms the <lb/>
      ear like the faint rustling of the forest leaves.</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">On</hi> the rail again&mdash;bound for Bendigo. From diary: <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">October 23</hi>. Got up at 6, left at 7.30; soon reached <lb/> Castlemaine,
      one of the rich gold-fields of the early <lb/> days; waited several hours for a train; left at
      3.40 and reached <lb/> Bendigo in an hour. For comrade, a Catholic priest who was <lb/> better
      than I was, but didn't seem to know it&mdash;a man full of <lb/> graces of the heart, the
      mind, and the spirit; a lovable man. <lb/> He will rise. He will be a bishop some day. Later
      an <reg orig="Arch-|bishop">Archbishop</reg>. <lb/> Later a Cardinal. Finally an Archangel, I
      hope. <lb/> And then he will recall me when I say, "Do you remember <lb/> that trip we made
      from Ballarat to Bendigo, when you were <lb/> nothing but Father C., and I was nothing to what
      I am now?" <lb/> It has actually taken nine hours to come from Ballarat to <lb/> Bendigo. We
      could have saved seven by walking. However, <lb/> there was no hurry.</p>
     <p>Bendigo was another of the rich strikes of the early days. <lb/> It does a great
      quartz-mining business, now&mdash;that business <lb/> which, more than any other that I
      know of, teaches patience, <lb/> and requires grit and a steady nerve. The town is full of
      <lb/> towering chimney-stacks, and hoisting-works, and looks like a <lb/> petroleum-city.
      Speaking of patience; for example, one of <lb/> the local companies went steadily on with its
      deep borings and <lb/> searchings without show of gold or a penny of reward for <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">eleven years</hi>&mdash;then struck it, and became suddenly rich. The
      <lb/> eleven years' work had cost $55,000, and the first gold found</p>
     <pb n="242" entity="DSSR_000002496_0257"/>
     <p>was a grain the size of a pin's head. It is kept under locks <lb/> and bars, as a precious
      thing, and is reverently shown to the <lb/> visitor, "hats off." When I saw it I had not heard
      its history.</p>
     <p>"It is gold. Examine it&mdash;take the glass. Now how much <lb/> should you say it is
      worth?"</p>
     <p>I said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"I should say about two cents; or in your English dialect, <lb/> four farthings."</p>
     <p>"Well, it cost &pound;11,000."</p>
     <p>"Oh, come!"</p>
     <p>"Yes, it did. Ballarat and Bendigo have produced the <lb/> three monumental nuggets of the
      world, and this one is the <lb/> monumentalest one of the three. The other two represent <lb/>
      &pound;9,000 a piece; this one a couple of thousand more. It is <lb/> small, and not much
      to look at, but it is entitled to it name&mdash; <lb/> Adam. It is the Adam-nugget of
      this mine, and its children <lb/> run up into the millions."</p>
     <p>Speaking of patience again, another of the mines was <lb/> worked, under heavy expenses,
      during 17 years before pay <lb/> was struck, and still another one compelled a wait of 21
      years <lb/> before pay was struck; then, in both instances, the outlay was <lb/> all back in a
      year or two, with compound interest.</p>
     <p>Bendigo has turned out even more gold than Ballarat.</p>
     <p>The two together have produced $650,000,000 worth&mdash;which <lb/> is half as much as
      California has produced.</p>
     <p>It was through Mr. Blank&mdash;not to go into particulars <lb/> about his
      name&mdash;it was mainly through Mr. Blank that my <lb/> stay in Bendigo was made
      memorably pleasant and interesting. <lb/> He explained this to me himself. He told me that it
      was <lb/> through his influence that the city government invited me to <lb/> the town-hall to
      hear complimentary speeches and respond to <lb/> them; that it was through his influence that
      I had been taken <lb/> on a long pleasure-drive through the city and shown its nota-</p>
     <pb n="243" entity="DSSR_000002496_0258"/>
     <p>ble features; that it was through his influence that I was <lb/> invited to visit the great
      mines; that it was through his <reg orig="in-|fluence">influence</reg>
      <lb/> that I was taken to the hospital and allowed to see the <lb/> convalescent Chinaman who
      had been <lb/> attacked at midnight in his lonely hut <lb/> eight weeks before by robbers, and
      <lb/> stabbed forty-six times and scalped <reg orig="be-|sides">besides</reg>; <lb/> that it
      was through his <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg>
      <lb/> that when I arrived this awful <lb/> spectacle of piecings and patchings and <lb/>
      bandagings was sitting up in his cot <lb/> letting on to read one of my books; <lb/> that it
      was through his influence that <lb/> efforts had been made to get the <lb/> Catholic
      Archbishop of Bendigo to <lb/> invite me to dinner; that it was through his influence that
      <lb/> efforts had been made to get the Anglican Bishop of Bendigo <lb/>

      </figure>
      <pb n="244" entity="DSSR_000002496_0259"/> to ask me to supper; that it was through his
      influence that <lb/> the dean of the editorial fraternity had driven me through the <lb/>
      woodsy outlying country and shown me, from the summit of <lb/> Lone Tree Hill, the mightiest
      and loveliest expanse of <reg orig="forest-|clad">forest-clad</reg>
      <lb/> mountain and valley that I had seen in all Australia. <lb/> And when he asked me what
      had most impressed me in <lb/> Bendigo and I answered and said it was the taste and the <lb/>
      public spirit which had adorned the streets with 105 miles <lb/> of shade trees, he said that
      it was through his influence that it <lb/> had been done.</p>
     <p>But I am not representing him quite correctly. He did not <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">say</hi> it was through his influence that all these things had <lb/>
      happened&mdash;for that would have been coarse; he merely <hi rend="italic">
       <reg orig="con-|veyed">conveyed</reg>
      </hi>
      <lb/> that idea; conveyed it so subtly that I only caught it <lb/> fleetingly, as one catches
      vagrant faint breaths of perfume <lb/> when one traverses the meadows in summer; conveyed it
      <lb/> without offense and without any suggestion of egoism or <lb/> ostentation&mdash;but
       <hi rend="italic">conveyed</hi> it, nevertheless.</p>
     <p>He was an Irishman; an educated gentleman; grave, and <lb/> kindly, and courteous; a
      bachelor, and about forty-five or <lb/> possibly fifty years old, apparently. He called upon
      me at the <lb/> hotel, and it was there that we had this talk. He made me like <lb/> him, and
      did it without trouble. This was partly through his <lb/> winning and gentle ways, but mainly
      through the amazing <lb/> familiarity with my books which his conversation showed. <lb/> He
      was down to date with them, too; and if he had made <lb/> them the study of his life he could
      hardly have been better <lb/> posted as to their contents than he was. He made me better <lb/>
      satisfied with myself than I had ever been before. It was <lb/> plain that he had a deep
      fondness for humor, yet he never <lb/> laughed; he never even chuckled; in fact, humor could
      not <lb/> win to outward expression on his face at all. No, he <lb/> was always
      grave&mdash;tenderly, pensively grave; but he made <hi rend="italic">me</hi>
      <lb/>
      <pb n="245" entity="DSSR_000002496_0260"/> laugh, all along; and this was very
      trying&mdash;and very pleasant <lb/> at the same time&mdash;for it was at quotations
      from my own books.</p>
     <p>When he was going, he turned and said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"You don't remember me?"</p>
     <p>"I? Why, no. Have we met before?"</p>
     <p>"No, it was a matter of correspondence."</p>
     <p>"Correspondence?"</p>
     <p>"Yes, many years ago. Twelve or fifteen. Oh, longer <lb/> than that. But of course
      you&mdash;" A musing pause. Then <lb/> he said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Do you remember Corrigan Castle?"</p>
     <p>"N-no, I believe I don't. I don't seem to recall the name."</p>
     <p>He waited a moment, pondering, with the door-knob in his <lb/> hand, then started out; but
      turned back and said that I had <lb/> once been interested in Corrigan Castle, and asked me if
      I <lb/> would go with him to his quarters in the evening and take a <lb/> hot Scotch and talk
      it over. I was a teetotaler and liked <lb/> relaxation, so I said I would.</p>
     <p>We drove from the lecture-hall together about half-past <lb/> ten. He had a most comfortably
      and tastefully furnished <lb/> parlor, with good pictures on the walls, Indian and Japanese
      <lb/> ornaments on the mantel, and here and there, and books <reg
       orig="every-|where&mdash;largely">everywhere&mdash;largely</reg>
      <lb/> mine; which made me proud. The light was <lb/> brilliant, the easy chairs were
      deep-cushioned, the arrangements <lb/> for brewing and smoking were all there. We brewed and
      <lb/> lit up; then he passed a sheet of note-paper to me and said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Do you remember that?"</p>
     <p>"Oh, yes, indeed!"</p>
     <p>The paper was of a sumptuous quality. At the top was a <lb/> twisted and interlaced monogram
      printed from steel dies in <lb/> gold and blue and red, in the ornate English fashion of long
      <lb/> years ago; and under it, in neat gothic capitals was this&mdash; <lb/> printed in
      blue:</p>

     <p>"My!" said I, "how did you come by this?" </p>
     <p>"I was President of it." </p>
     <p>"No!&mdash;you don't mean it." </p>
     <p>"It is true. I was its first President. I was re-elected <lb/> annually as long as its
      meetings were held in my castle&mdash; <lb/> Corrigan&mdash;which was five years."</p>
     <p>Then he showed me an album with twenty-three <reg orig="photo-|graphs">photographs</reg>
      <lb/> of me in it. Five of them were of old dates, the <lb/> others of various later crops;
      the list closed with a picture <lb/> taken by Falk in Sydney a month before.</p>
     <p>"You sent us the first five; the rest were bought."</p>
     <p>This was paradise! We ran late, and talked, talked, talked&mdash; <lb/> subject, the
      Mark Twain Club of Corrigan Castle, Ireland.</p>
     <p>My first knowledge of that Club dates away back; all of <lb/> twenty years, I should say. It
      came to me in the form of a <lb/> courteous letter, written on the note-paper which I have
      <lb/> described, and signed "By order of the President; C. <hi rend="small-caps"
      >PEMBROKE</hi>, <lb/> Secretary." It conveyed the fact that the Club had been <reg
       orig="cre-|ated">created</reg>
      <lb/> in my honor, and added the hope that this token of <lb/> appreciation of my work would
      meet with my approval.</p>
     <p>I answered, with thanks; and did what I could to keep my <lb/> gratification from
      over-exposure.</p>
     <p>It was then that the long correspondence began. A letter <lb/> came back, by order of the
      President, furnishing me the names <lb/> of the members&mdash;thirty-two in number. With
      it came a copy <lb/> of the Constitution and By-Laws, in pamphlet form, and <reg
       orig="artis-|tically">artistically</reg>
      <lb/> printed. The initiation fee and dues were in their <lb/> proper place; also, schedule of
      meetings&mdash;monthly&mdash;for essays <lb/> upon works of mine, followed by
      discussions; quarterly for <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg>
      <lb/> and a supper, without essays, but with after-supper speeches</p>
     <pb n="247" entity="DSSR_000002496_0262"/>
     <p>also, there was a list of the officers: President, Vice-President, <lb/> Secretary,
      Treasurer, etc. The letter was brief, but it was <lb/> pleasant reading, for it told me about
      the strong interest which <lb/> the membership took in their new venture, etc., etc. It also
      <lb/> asked me for a photograph&mdash;a special one. I went down and <lb/> sat for it and
      sent it&mdash;with a letter, of course.</p>
     <p>Presently came the badge of the Club, and very dainty and <lb/> and pretty it was; and very
      artistic. It was a frog <reg orig="peep-|ing">peeping</reg>
      <lb/> out from a graceful tangle of grass-sprays and rushes, <lb/> and was done in enamels on
      a gold basis, and had a gold <lb/> pin back of it. After I had petted it, and <lb/> played
      with it, and caressed it, and enjoyed <lb/> it a couple of hours, the light happened to <lb/>
      fall upon it at a new angle, and revealed to <lb/> me a cunning new detail; with the light
      just <lb/> right, certain delicate shadings of the <reg orig="grass-|blades">grass-blades</reg>
      <lb/> and rush-stems wove themselves into <lb/> a monogram&mdash;mine! You can see that
      that <lb/> jewel was a work of art. And when you come to consider <lb/> the intrinsic value of
      it, you must concede that it is not every <lb/> literary club that could afford a badge like
      that. It was <lb/> easily worth $75, in the opinion of Messrs. Marcus and Ward <lb/> of New
      York. They said they could not duplicate it for that <lb/> and make a profit.</p>

      <p>THE CLUB BADGE.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>By this time the Club was well under way; and from that <lb/> time forth its secretary kept
      my off-hours well supplied with <lb/> business. He reported the Club's discussions of my books
      with <lb/> laborious fullness, and did his work with great spirit and ability. <lb/> As a
      rule, he synopsized; but when a speech was especially <lb/> brilliant, he short-handed it and
      gave me the best passages <lb/> from it, written out. There were five speakers whom he <reg
       orig="par-|ticularly">particularly</reg>
      <lb/> favored in that way: Palmer, Forbes, Naylor, Norris, <lb/> and Calder. Palmer and Forbes
      could never get through a <lb/>
      <pb n="248" entity="DSSR_000002496_0263"/> speech without attacking each other, and each in
      his own way <lb/> was formidably effective&mdash;Palmer in virile and eloquent abuse,
      <lb/> Forbes in courtly and elegant but scalding satire. I could <lb/> always tell which of
      them was talking without looking for his <lb/> name. Naylor had a polished style and a happy
      knack at <lb/> felicitous metaphor; Norris's style was wholly without <reg orig="orna-|ment"
       >ornament</reg>, <lb/> but enviably compact, lucid, and strong. But after all, <lb/> Calder
      was the gem. He never spoke when sober, he spoke <lb/> continuously when he wasn't. And
      certainly they were the <lb/> drunkest speeches that a man ever uttered. They were full of
      <lb/> good things, but so incredibly mixed up and wandering that it <lb/> made one's head swim
      to follow him. They were not intended <lb/> to be funny, but they were,&mdash;funny for
      the very gravity <lb/> which the speaker put into his flowing miracles of incongruity. <lb/>
      In the course of five years I came to know the styles of the <lb/> five orators as well as I
      knew the style of any speaker in my <lb/> own club at home.</p>
     <p>These reports came every month. They were written on <lb/> foolscap, 600 words to the page,
      and usually about twenty-five <lb/> pages in a report&mdash;a good 15,000 words, I should
      say,&mdash;a solid <lb/> week's work. The reports were absorbingly entertaining, long
      <lb/> as they were; but, unfortunately for me, they did not come <lb/> alone. They were always
      accompanied by a lot of questions <lb/> about passages and purposes in my books, which the
      Club <lb/> wanted answered; and additionally accompanied every quarter <lb/> by the
      Treasurer's report, and the Auditor's report, and the <lb/> Committee's report, and the
      President's review, and my opinion <lb/> of these was always desired; also suggestions for the
      good of <lb/> the Club, if any occurred to me.</p>
     <p>By and by I came to dread those things; and this dread <lb/> grew and grew and grew; grew
      until I got to anticipating <lb/> them with a cold horror. For I was an indolent man, and not
      <lb/> fond of letter-writing, and whenever these things came I had </p>
     <pb n="249" entity="DSSR_000002496_0264"/>
     <p>to put everything by and sit down&mdash;for my own peace of <lb/> mind&mdash;and
      dig and dig until I got something out of my head <lb/> which would answer for a reply. I got
      along fairly well the <lb/> first year; but for the succeeding four years the Mark Twain <lb/>
      Club of Corrigan Castle was my curse, my nightmare, the <lb/> grief and misery of my life. And
      I got so, <hi rend="italic">so</hi> sick of sitting <lb/> for photographs. I sat every year
      for five years, trying to <lb/> satisfy that insatiable organization. Then at last I rose in
      <lb/> revolt. I could endure my oppressions no longer. I pulled <lb/> my fortitude together
      and tore off my chains, and was a free <lb/> man again, and happy. From that day I burned the
       <reg orig="secreta-|ry's">secretary's</reg>
      <lb/> fat envelopes the moment they arrived, and by and by they <lb/> ceased to come.</p>
     <p>Well, in the sociable frankness of that night in Bendigo <lb/> I brought this all out in
      full confession. Then Mr. Blank <lb/> came out in the same frank way, and with a preliminary
      word <lb/> of gentle apology said that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was the Mark Twain Club, and
      <lb/> the only member it had ever had!</p>
     <p>Why, it was matter for anger, but I didn't feel any. He <lb/> said he never had to work for
      a living, and that by the time <lb/> he was thirty life had become a bore and a weariness to
      him. <lb/> He had no interests left; they had paled and perished, one by <lb/> one, and left
      him desolate. He had begun to think of suicide. <lb/> Then all of a sudden he thought of that
      happy idea of starting <lb/> an imaginary club, and went straightway to work at it, with <lb/>
      enthusiasm and love. He was charmed with it; it gave him <lb/> something to do. It elaborated
      itself on his hands; it became <lb/> twenty times more complex and formidable than was his
      first <lb/> rude draft of it. Every new addition to his original plan <lb/> which cropped up
      in his mind gave him a fresh interest and a <lb/> new pleasure. He designed the Club badge
      himself, and <lb/> worked over it, altering and improving it, a number of days <lb/> and
      nights; then sent to London and had it made. It was the</p>
     <pb n="250" entity="DSSR_000002496_0265"/>
     <p>only one that was made. It was made for me; the "rest of <lb/> the Club" went without.</p>
     <p>He invented the thirty-two members and their names. He <lb/> invented the five favorite
      speakers and their five separate styles. <lb/> He invented their speeches, and reported them
      himself. He <lb/> would have kept that Club going until now, if I hadn't <reg
       orig="desert-|ed">deserted</reg>, <lb/> he said. He said he worked like a slave over those
      reports; <lb/> each of them cost him from a week to a fortnight's work, and <lb/> the work
      gave him pleasure and kept him alive and willing to <lb/> be alive. It was a bitter blow to
      him when the Club died.</p>
     <p>Finally, there wasn't any Corrigan Castle. He had <reg orig="invent-|ed">invented</reg>
      <lb/> that, too.</p>
     <p>It was wonderful&mdash;the whole thing; and altogether the <lb/> most ingenious and
      laborious and cheerful and painstaking <lb/> practical joke I have ever heard of. And I liked
      it; liked to <lb/> hear him tell about it; yet I have been a hater of practical <lb/> jokes
      from as long back as I can remember. Finally he said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Do you remember a note from Melbourne fourteen or <reg orig="fif-|teen">fifteen</reg>
      <lb/> years ago, telling about your lecture tour in Australia, <lb/> and your death and burial
      in Melbourne?&mdash;a note from Henry <lb/> Bascomb, of Bascomb Hall, Upper Holywell
      Hants."</p>
     <p>"Yes."</p>
     <p>"I wrote it."</p>
     <p>"M-y&mdash;word!"</p>
     <p>"Yes, I did it. I don't know why. I just took the notion, <lb/> and carried it out without
      stopping to think. It was wrong. <lb/> It could have done harm. I was always sorry about it
       <reg orig="after-|ward">afterward</reg>. <lb/> You must forgive me. I was Mr. Bascom's guest
      <lb/> on his yacht, on his voyage around the world. He often spoke <lb/> of you, and of the
      pleasant times you had had together in his <lb/> home; and the notion took me, there in
      Melbourne, and I <lb/> imitated his hand, and wrote the letter."</p>
     <p>So the mystery was cleared up, after so many, many years.</p>

      <lb/> But in truth, he knows none of these things. There are but four <lb/> or five people in

      Since all people think they know <lb/> them, they are an easy prey to these adventurers. Or
      rather <lb/> they were an easy prey until the law interfered three months <lb/> ago, and a New

     <p>All people think that New Zealand is close to Australia or <lb/>
      <pb n="252" entity="DSSR_000002496_0267"/> Asia, or somewhere, and that you cross to it on a
      bridge. But <lb/> that is not so. It is not close to anything, but lies by itself, <lb/> out
      in the water. It is nearest to Australia, but still not near. <lb/> The gap between is very
      wide. It will be a surprise to the <lb/> reader, as it was to me, to learn that the distance
      from <reg orig="Aus-|tralia">Australia</reg>
      <lb/> to New Zealand is really twelve or thirteen hundred <lb/> miles, and that there is no
      bridge. I learned this from <reg orig="Profes-|sor">Professor</reg>
      <lb/> X., of Yale University, whom I met in the steamer on the <lb/> great lakes when I was
      crossing the continent to sail across the <lb/> Pacific. I asked him about New Zealand, in
      order to make <lb/> conversation. I supposed he would generalize a little without <lb/>
      compromising himself, and then turn the subject to something <lb/> he was acquainted with, and
      my object would then be attained; <lb/> the ice would be broken, and we could go smoothly on,
      and get <lb/> acquainted, and have a pleasant time. But, to my surprise, he <lb/> was not only
      not embarrassed by my question, but seemed to <lb/> welcome it, and to take a distinct
      interest in it. He began to <lb/> talk&mdash;fluently, confidently, comfortably; and as
      he talked, my <lb/> admiration grew and grew; for as the subject developed under <lb/> his
      hands, I saw that he not only knew where New Zealand <lb/> was, but that he was minutely
      familiar with every detail of its <lb/> history, politics, religions, and commerce, its fauna,
      flora, <reg orig="geol-|ogy">geology</reg>, <lb/> products, and climatic peculiarities. When
      he was done, <lb/> I was lost in wonder and admiration, and said to myself, he <lb/> know
      severything; in the domain of human knowledge he is king. </p>
     <p>I wanted to see him do more miracles; and so, just for the <lb/> pleasure of hearing him
      answer, I asked him about <reg orig="Hertze-|govina">Hertzegovina</reg>, <lb/> and pariah, and
      unique. But he began to generalize <lb/> then, and show distress. I saw that with New Zealand
      gone, <lb/> he was a Samson shorn of his locks; he was as other men. <lb/> This was a curious
      and interesting mystery, and I was frank <lb/> with him, and asked him to explain it.</p>
     <p>He tried to avoid it at first; but then laughed and said <lb/>
      <pb n="253" entity="DSSR_000002496_0268"/> that after all, the matter was not worth
      concealment, so he <lb/> would let me into the secret. In substance, this is his story:</p>
     <p>"Last autumn I was at work one morning at home, when a card came <lb/> up&mdash;the
      card of a stranger. Under the name was printed a line which <lb/> showed that this visitor was
      Professor of Theological Engineering in <reg orig="Welling-|ton">Wellington</reg>
      <lb/> University, New Zealand. I was troubled&mdash;troubled, I mean, by the <lb/>
      shortness of the notice. College etiquette required that he be at once invited <lb/> to dinner
      by some member of the Faculty&mdash;invited to dine on <hi rend="italic">that</hi>
      day&mdash;not <lb/> put off till a subsequent day. I did not quite know what to do.
      College <lb/> etiquette requires, in the case of a foreign guest, that the dinner-talk shall
      <lb/> begin with complimentary <lb/> references to his country, <lb/> its great men, its
      services <lb/> to civilization, its seats of <lb/> learning, and things like <lb/> that; and
      of course the <lb/> host is responsible, and <lb/> must either begin this talk <lb/> himself
      or see that it is <lb/> done by some one else. I <lb/> was in great difficulty; and <lb/> the
      more I searched my <lb/> memory, the more my <lb/> trouble grew. I found <lb/> that I knew
      nothing about <lb/> New Zealand. I thought <lb/> I knew where it was, and <lb/> that was all.
      I had an <lb/> impression that it was <lb/> close to Australia, or Asia, <lb/> or somewhere,
      and that <lb/> one went over to it on a <lb/> bridge. This might turn <lb/> out to be
      incorrect; and <lb/> even if correct, it would <lb/> not furnish matter enough <lb/> for the
      purpose at the dinner, and I should expose my College to shame <lb/> before my guest; he would
      see that I, a member of the Faculty of the first <lb/> University in America, was wholly
      ignorant of his country, and he would go <lb/> away and tell this, and laugh at it. The
      thought of it made my face burn.</p>
     <figure id="f71" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002496_0268">
      <p>THE SCHEME WORKED.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>"I sent for my wife and told her how I was situated, and asked for her <lb/> help, and she
      thought of a thing which I might have thought of myself, if I <lb/> had not been excited and
      worried. She said she would go and tell the visitor <lb/> that I was out but would be in in a
      few minutes; and she would talk, and <lb/> keep him busy while I got out the back way and
      hurried over and make <lb/> Professor Lawson give the dinner. For Lawson knew everything, and
      <lb/> could meet the guest in a creditable way and save the reputation of the <lb/>
      <pb n="254" entity="DSSR_000002496_0269"/> University. I ran to Lawson, but was disappointed.
      He did not know <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg>
      <lb/> about New Zealand. He said that, as far as his recollection went <lb/> it was close to
      Australia, or Asia, or somewhere, and you <lb/> go over to it on a bridge; but that was all he
      knew. It <lb/> was too bad. Lawson was a perfect encyclopedia of <lb/> abstruse learning; but
      now in this hour of our need, <lb/> it turned out that he did not know any useful thing.</p>
     <figure id="f72" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002496_0269">
      <p>"WHAT DO YOU?"</p>
     </figure>
     <p>"We consulted. He saw that the reputation of the <lb/> University was in very real peril,
      and he walked the floor <lb/> in anxiety, talking, and trying to think out some way <lb/> to
      meet the difficulty. Presently he decided that we <lb/> must try the rest of the
      Faculty&mdash;some of them might <lb/> know about New Zealand. So we went to the
      telephone <lb/> and called up the professor of astronomy and asked him, <lb/> and he said that
      all he knew was, that it was close to <lb/> Australia, or Asia, or somewhere, and you went
      over to <lb/> it on&mdash;</p>
     <p>"We shut him off and called up the professor of <lb/> biology, and he said that all he knew
      was that it was <lb/> close to Aus.&mdash;</p>
     <p>"We shut him off, and sat down, worried and <reg orig="dis-|heartened">disheartened</reg>,
      <lb/> to see if we could think up some other scheme. We shortly hit <lb/> upon one which
      promised well, and this one we adopted, and set its <reg orig="ma-|chinery">machinery</reg>
      <lb/> going at once. It was this. Lawson must give the dinner. The <lb/> Faculty must be
      notified by telephone to prepare. We must all get to work <lb/> diligently, and at the end of
      eight hours and a half we must come to dinner <lb/> acquainted with New Zealand; at least well
      enough <reg orig="in-|formed">informed</reg>
      <lb/> to appear without discredit before this native. To <lb/> seem properly intelligent we
      should have to know about <lb/> New Zealand's population, and politics, and form of <reg
       orig="govern-|ment">government</reg>, <lb/> and commerce, and taxes, and products, and
      ancient <lb/> history, and modern history, and varieties of religion, and <lb/> nature of the
      laws, and their codification, and amount of <lb/> revenue, and whence drawn, and methods of
      collection, and <lb/> percentage of loss, and character of climate, and&mdash;well, a
      <lb/> lot of things like that; we must suck the maps and <reg orig="cyclo-|pedias">cyclopedias</reg>
      <lb/> dry. And while we posted up in this way, the <lb/> Faculty's wives must flock over, one
      after the other, in a <lb/> studiedly casual way, and help my wife keep the New <lb/>
      Zealander quiet, and not let him get out and come <reg orig="interfer-|ing">interfering</reg>
      <lb/> with our studies. The scheme worked admirably; but <lb/> it stopped business, stopped it
      entirely.</p>

     <p>"It is in the official log-book of Yale, to be read and <lb/> wondered at by future

      was not worthy to <lb/> sit in the company of men like <lb/> these; that he had been silent

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">November</hi> 1&mdash;<hi rend="italic">noon</hi>. A fine day, a
      brilliant sun. <lb/> Warm in the sun, cold in the shade&mdash;an icy breeze <lb/> blowing
      out of the south. A solemn long swell <lb/> rolling up northward. It comes from the South
      Pole, with <lb/> nothing in the way to obstruct its march and tone its energy <lb/> down. I
      have read somewhere that an acute observer among <lb/> the early explorers&mdash;Cook? or
      Tasman?&mdash;accepted this <lb/> majestic swell as trustworthy circumstantial evidence
      that no <lb/> important land lay to the southward, and so did not waste <lb/> time on a
      useless quest in that direction, but changed his <lb/> course and went searching elsewhere.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">Afternoon</hi>. Passing between Tasmania (formerly Van <lb/>
      Diemen's Land) and neighboring islands&mdash;islands whence the <lb/> poor
      exiled Tasmanian savages used to gaze at their lost <reg orig="home-|land">homeland</reg>
      <lb/> and cry; and die of broken hearts. How glad I am that <lb/> all these native races are
      dead and gone, or nearly so. The <lb/> work was mercifully swift and horrible in some portions
      of <lb/> Australia. As far as Tasmania is concerned, the extermination <lb/> was complete: not
      a native is left. It was a strife of years, and <lb/> decades of years. The Whites and the
      Blacks hunted each <lb/> other, ambushed each other, butchered each other. The Blacks <lb/>
      were not numerous. But they were wary, alert, cunning, and</p>

     <p>they knew their country well. They lasted a long time, few <lb/> as they were, and inflicted
      much slaughter upon the Whites.</p>
     <p>The Government wanted to save the Blacks from ultimate <lb/> extermination, if possible. One
      of its schemes was to capture <lb/> them and coop them up, on a neighboring island, under
      guard. <lb/> Bodies of Whites volunteered for the hunt, for the pay was <lb/>
      good&mdash;&pound;5 for each Black captured and delivered, but the <lb/> success
      achieved was not very satisfactory. The Black was <lb/> naked, and his body was greased. It
      was hard to get a grip <lb/> on him that would hold. The Whites moved about in armed <lb/>
      bodies, and surprised little families of natives, and did make <lb/> captures; but it was
      suspected that in these surprises half a <lb/> dozen natives were killed to one
      caught&mdash;and that was not <lb/> what the Government desired.</p>
     <p>Another scheme was to drive the natives into a corner of <lb/> the island and fence them in
      by a cordon of men placed in line <lb/> across the country; but the natives managed to slip
      through, <lb/> constantly, and continue their murders and arsons.</p>
     <p>The governor warned these unlettered savages <hi rend="italic">by printed <lb/>
      proclamation</hi> that they must stay in the desolate region <lb/> officially appointed for
      them! The proclamation was a dead <lb/> letter; the savages could not read it. Afterward a <hi
       rend="italic">picture- </hi>
      <lb/> proclamation was issued. It was painted up on boards, and these <lb/> were nailed to
      trees in the forest. Herewith is a photographic <lb/> reproduction of this fashion-plate.
      Substantially it means:</p>
     <list>
      <item>1. The Governor wishes the Whites and the Blacks to love each other;</item>
      <item>2. He loves his black subjects;</item>
      <item>3. Blacks who kill Whites will be hanged;</item>
      <item>4. Whites who kill Blacks will be hanged.</item>
     </list>
     <p>Upon its several schemes the Government spent &pound;30,000 <lb/> and employed the
      labors and ingenuities of several thousand <lb/> Whites for a long time&mdash;with
      failure as a result. Then, at <lb/> last, a quarter of a century after the beginning of the
      troubles <lb/> between the two races, the right man was found. No, he</p>
     <pb n="260" entity="DSSR_000002496_0275"/>
     <p>found himself. This was George Augustus Robinson, called <lb/> in history "The Conciliator."
      He was not educated, and not <lb/> conspicuous in any way. He was a working bricklayer, in
      <lb/> Hobart Town. But he must have been an amazing personality; <lb/> a man worth traveling
      far to see. It may be his counterpart <lb/> appears in history, but I do not know where to
      look for it.</p>
     <p>He set himself this incredible task: to go out into the <lb/> wilderness, the jungle, and
      the mountain-retreats where the <lb/> hunted and implacable savages were hidden, and appear
      among <lb/> them unarmed, speak the language of love and of kindness to <lb/> them, and
      persuade them to forsake their homes and the wild <lb/> free life that was so dear to them,
      and go with him and <lb/> surrender to the hated Whites and live under their watch and <lb/>
      ward, and upon their charity the rest of their lives! On its <lb/> face it was the dream of a
      madman.</p>
     <p>In the beginning, his moral-suasion project was <reg orig="sarcasti-|cally">sarcastically</reg>
      <lb/> dubbed the <hi rend="italic">sugar-plum speculation</hi>. If the scheme was <lb/>
      striking, and new to the world's experience, the situation was <lb/> not less so. It was this.
      The White population numbered <lb/> 40,000 in 1831; the Black population numbered <hi
       rend="italic">three hundred. </hi>
      <lb/> Not 300 warriors, but 300 men, women, and children. The <lb/> Whites were armed with
      guns, the Blacks with clubs and <lb/> spears. The Whites had fought the Blacks for a quarter
      of a <lb/> century, and had tried every thinkable way to capture, kill, or <lb/> subdue them;
      and could not do it. If white men of any <lb/> race <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have done it,
      these would have accomplished it. <lb/> But every scheme had failed, the splendid 300, the
      matchless <lb/> 300 were unconquered, and manifestly unconquerable. They <lb/> would not
      yield, they would listen to no terms, they would <lb/> fight to the bitter end. Yet they had
      no poet to keep up their <lb/> heart, and sing the marvel of their magnificent patriotism.</p>
     <p>At the end of five-and-twenty years of hard fighting, the <lb/> surviving 300 naked patriots
      were still defiant, still persistent,</p>
     <pb n="261" entity="DSSR_000002496_0276"/>
     <p>still efficacious with their rude weapons, and the Governor and <lb/> the 40,000 knew not
      which way to turn, nor what to do.</p>
     <p>Then the Bricklayer&mdash;that wonderful man&mdash;proposed to <lb/> go out into
      the wilderness, with no weapon but his tongue, <lb/> and no protection but his honest eye and
      his humane heart; <lb/> and track those embittered savages to their lairs in the gloomy <lb/>
      forests and among the mountain snows. Naturally, he was <lb/> considered a crank. But he was
      not quite that. In fact, he <lb/> was a good way short of that. He was building upon his long
      <lb/> and intimate knowledge of the native character. The deriders <lb/> of his project were
      right&mdash;from their standpoint&mdash;for they <lb/> believed the natives to be
      mere wild beasts; and Robinson was <lb/> right, from his standpoint&mdash;for he believed
      the natives to be <lb/> human beings. The truth did really lie between the two. <lb/> The
      event proved that Robinson's judgment was soundest; <lb/> but about once a month for four
      years the event came near <lb/> to giving the verdict to the deriders, for about that
      frequently <lb/> Robinson barely escaped falling under the native spears.</p>
     <p>But history shows that he had a thinking head, and was <lb/> not a mere wild sentimentalist.
      For instance, he wanted the <lb/> war parties call in before he started unarmed upon his
      mission <lb/> of peace. He wanted the best chance of success&mdash;not a <reg
       orig="half-|chance">half-chance</reg>. <lb/> And he was very willing to have help; and so,
      high <lb/> rewards were advertised, for any who would go unarmed with <lb/> him. This
      opportunity was declined. Robinson persuaded <lb/> some tamed natives of both sexes to go with
      him&mdash;a strong <lb/> evidence of his persuasive powers, for those natives well knew
      <lb/> that their destruction would be almost certain. As it turned <lb/> out, they had to face
      death over and over again.</p>
     <p>Robinson and his little party had a difficult undertaking upon <lb/> their hands. They could
      not ride off, horseback, comfortably <lb/> into the woods and call Leonidas and his 300
      together for a <lb/> talk and a treaty the following day; for the wild men were</p>
     <pb n="262" entity="DSSR_000002496_0277"/>
     <p>not in a body; they were scattered, immense distances apart, <lb/> over regions so desolate
      that even the birds could not make a <lb/> living with the chances
      offered&mdash;scattered in groups of twenty, <lb/> a dozen, half a dozen, even in groups
      of three. And the <reg orig="mis-|sion">mission</reg>
      <lb/> must go on foot. Mr. Bonwick furnishes a description of <lb/> those horrible regions,
      whereby it will be seen that even <lb/> fugitive gangs of the hardiest and choicest human
      devils the <lb/> world has seen&mdash;the convicts set apart to people the "Hell of <lb/>
      Macquarrie Harbor Station"&mdash;were never able, but once, to <reg orig="sur-|vive"
       >survive</reg>
      <lb/> the horrors of a march through them, but starving and <lb/> struggling, and fainting and
      failing, ate each other, and died:</p>
     <p>"Onward, still onward, was the order of the indomitable Robinson. No <lb/> one ignorant of
      the western country of Tasmania can form a correct idea of the <lb/> traveling difficulties.
      While I was resident in Hobart Town, the Governor, <lb/> Sir John Franklin, and his lady,
      undertook the western journey to Macquarrie <lb/> Harbor, and suffered terribly. One man who
      assisted to carry her ladyship <lb/> through the swamps, gave me his bitter experience of its
      miseries. Several <lb/> were disabled for life. No wonder that but one party, escaping from
       <reg orig="Mac-|quarrie">Macquarrie</reg>
      <lb/> Harbor convict settlement, arrived at the civilized region in safety. <lb/> Men perished
      in the scrub, were lost in snow, or were devoured by their <reg orig="com-|panions"
      >companions</reg>. <lb/> This was the territory traversed by Mr. Robinson and his Black <lb/>
      guides. All honor to his intrepidity, and their wonderful fidelity! When <lb/> they had, in
      the depth of winter, to cross deep and rapid rivers, pass among <lb/> mountains six thousand
      feet high, pierce dangerous thickets, and find food in <lb/> a country forsaken even by birds,
      we can realize their hardships.</p>
     <p>"After a frightful journey by Cradle Mountain, and over the lofty plateau <lb/> of Middlesex
      Plains, the travelers experienced unwonted misery, and the <lb/> circumstances called forth
      the best qualities of the nob'e little band. Mr. <lb/> Robinson wrote afterwards to Mr.
      Secretary Burnett some details of this <reg orig="pas-|sage">passage</reg>
      <lb/> of horrors. In that letter, of Oct 2, 1834, he states that his Natives <lb/> were very
      reluctant to go over the dreadful mountain passes; that 'for seven <lb/> successive days we
      continued traveling over one solid body of snow;' that <lb/> 'the snows were of incredible
      depth;' that 'the Natives were frequently up <lb/> to their middle in snow.' But still the
      ill-clad, ill-fed, diseased, and wayworn <lb/> men and women were sustained by the cheerful
      voice of their unconquerable <lb/> friend, and responded most nobly to his call."</p>
     <p>Mr. Bonwick says that Robinson's friendly capture of the <lb/> Big River
      tribe&mdash;remember, it was a whole tribe&mdash;"was by <lb/> far the grandest
      feature of the war, and the crowning glory <lb/> of his efforts." The word "war" was not well
      chosen, and is</p>
     <pb n="263" entity="DSSR_000002496_0278"/>
     <p>misleading. There <hi rend="italic">was</hi> war still, but only the Blacks were <lb/>
      conducting it&mdash;the Whites were holding off until Robinson <lb/> could give his
      scheme a fair trial. I think that we are to <lb/> understand that the friendly capture of that
      tribe was by far <lb/> the most important thing, the highest in value, that happened <lb/>
      during the whole thirty years of truceless hostilities; that it <lb/> was a decisive thing, a
      peaceful Waterloo, the surrender of the <lb/> native Napoleon and his dreaded forces, the
      happy ending of <lb/> the long strife. For "that tribe was the terror of the colony," <lb/>
      its chief "the Black Douglas of Bush households."</p>
     <p>Robinson knew that these formidable people were lurking <lb/> somewhere, in some remote
      corner of the hideous regions just <lb/> described, and he and his unarmed little party
      started on a <lb/> tedious and perilous hunt for them. At last, "there, under <lb/> the
      shadows of the Frenchman's Cap, whose grim cone rose <lb/> five thousand feet in the
      uninhabited westward interior," they <lb/> were found. It was a serious moment. Robinson
      himself <lb/> believed, for once, that his mission, successful until now, was <lb/> to end
      here in failure, and that his own death-hour had struck.</p>
     <p>The redoubtable chief stood in menacing attitude, with <lb/> his eighteen-foot spear poised;
      his warriors stood massed at <lb/> his back, armed for battle, their faces eloquent with their
       <reg orig="long-|cherished">long-cherished</reg>
      <lb/> loathing for white men. "They rattled their spears <lb/> and shouted their war-cry."
      Their women were back of them, <lb/> laden with supplies of weapons, and keeping their 150
      eager <lb/> dogs quiet until the chief should give the signal to fall on.</p>
     <p>"I think we shall soon be in the resurrection," whispered a <lb/> member of Robinson's
      little party.</p>
     <p>"I think we shall," answered Robinson; then plucked up <lb/> heart and began his
      persuasions&mdash;in the tribe's own dialect, <lb/> which surprised and pleased the
      chief. Presently there was <lb/> an interruption by the chief:</p>
     <p>"Who are you?"</p>
     <pb n="264" entity="DSSR_000002496_0279"/>
     <p>"We are gentlemen."</p>
     <p>"Where are your guns?"</p>
     <p>"We have none."</p>
     <p>The warrior was astonished.</p>
     <p>"Where your little guns?" (pistols).</p>
     <p>"We have none."</p>
     <p>A few minutes passed&mdash;in by-play&mdash;suspense&mdash;discussion <lb/>
      among the tribesmen&mdash;Robinson's tamed squaws ventured to <lb/> cross the line and
      begin persuasions upon the wild squaws. <lb/> Then the chief stepped back "to confer with the
      old women&mdash; <lb/> the real arbiters of savage war." Mr. Bonwick continues:</p>
     <p>"As the fallen gladiator in the arena looks for the signal of life or death <lb/> from the
      president of the amphitheatre, so waited our friends in anxious <reg orig="sus-|pense"
       >suspense</reg>
      <lb/> while the conference continued. In a few minutes, before a word was <lb/> uttered, the
      women of the tribe threw up their arms three times. This was <lb/> the inviolable sign of
      peace! Down fell the spears. Forward, with a heavy <lb/> sigh of relief, and upward glance of
      gratitude, came the friends of peace. <lb/> The impulsive natives rushed forth with tears and
      cries, as each saw in the <lb/> other's rank a loved one of the past.&hellip;</p>
     <p>"It was a jubilee of joy. A festival followed. And, while tears flowed <lb/> at the recital
      of woe, a corrobory of pleasant laughter closed the eventful day."</p>
     <p>In four years, without the spilling of a drop of blood, <lb/> Robinson brought them all in,
      willing captives, and delivered <lb/> them to the white governor, and ended the war which
      powder <lb/> and bullets, and thousands of men to use them, had prosecuted <lb/> without
      result since 1804.</p>
     <p>Marsyas charming the wild beasts with his music&mdash;that is <lb/> fable; but the
      miracle wrought by Robinson is fact. It is <lb/> history&mdash;and authentic; and surely,
      there is nothing greater, <lb/> nothing more reverence-compelling in the history of any <lb/>
      country, ancient or modern.</p>
     <p>And in memory of the greatest man Australasia ever <lb/> developed or ever will develop,
      there is a stately monument <lb/> to George Augustus Robinson, the Conciliator
      in&mdash;no, it is to <lb/> another man, I forget his name.</p>
     <p>However, Robertson's own generation honored him, and in <lb/> manifesting it honored
      themselves. The Government gave <lb/>
      <pb n="265" entity="DSSR_000002496_0280"/> him a money-reward and a thousand acres of land;
      and the <lb/> people held mass-meetings and praised him and emphasized <lb/> their praise with
      a large subscription of money.</p>
     <p>A good dramatic situation; but the curtain fell on another:</p>
     <p>"When this desperate tribe was thus captured, there was much surprise <lb/> to find that the
      &pound;30,000 of a little earlier day had been spent, and the whole <lb/> population of
      the colony placed under arms, in contention with an opposing <lb/> force of <hi rend="italic"
       >sixteen men with wooden spears!</hi> Yet such was the fact. The <reg orig="cele-|brated"
       >celebrated</reg>
      <lb/> Big River tribe, that had been raised by European fears to a host, <reg
       orig="con-|sisted">consisted</reg>
      <lb/> of <hi rend="italic">sixteen men, nine women, and one child.</hi> With a knowledge of
      the <lb/> mischief done by these few, their wonderful marches and their widespread <lb/>
      aggressions, their enemies cannot deny to them the attributes of courage and <lb/> military
      tact. A Wallace might harass a large army with a small and <lb/> determined band; but the
      contending parties were at least equal in arms and <lb/> civilization The Zulus who fought us
      in Africa, the Maories in New <lb/> Zealand, the Arabs in the Soudan, were far better provided
      with weapons, <lb/> more advanced in the science of war, and considerably more numerous, than
      <lb/> the naked Tasmanians. Governor Arthur rightly termed them a <hi rend="italic">noble
       race."</hi></p>
     <p>These were indeed wonderful people, the natives. They <lb/> ought not to have been wasted.
      They should have been <lb/> crossed with the Whites. It would have improved the Whites <lb/>
      and done the Natives no harm.</p>
     <p>But the Natives <hi rend="italic">were</hi> wasted, poor heroic wild creatures. <lb/> They
      were gathered together in little settlements on <reg orig="neigh-|boring">neighboring</reg>
      <lb/> islands, and paternally cared for by the Government, <lb/> and instructed in religion,
      and deprived of tobacco, because the <lb/> superintendent of the Sunday-school was not a
      smoker, and so <lb/> considered smoking immoral.</p>
     <p>The Natives were not used to clothes, and houses, and regular <lb/> hours, and church, and
      school, and Sunday-school, and work, and <lb/> the other misplaced persecutions of
      civilization, and they pined <lb/> for their lost home and their wild free life. Too late they
      <lb/> repented that they had traded that heaven for this hell. They <lb/> sat homesick on
      their alien crags, and day by day gazed out <lb/> through their tears over the sea with
      unappeasable longing <lb/> toward the hazy bulk which was the specter of what had been <lb/>
      their paradise; one by one their hearts broke and they died.</p>
     <p>In a very few years nothing but a scant remnant remained <lb/>

      the last <lb/> man died, in 1876 the last woman died, and the Spartans of <lb/> Australasia
      were extinct.</p>
     <p>The Whites always mean well when they take human fish <lb/> out of the ocean and try to make
      them dry and warm and <lb/> happy and comfortable in a chicken coop; but the <reg

      savages. He cannot turn the <lb/> situation around and imagine how he would like it to have a
      <lb/> well-meaning savage transfer him from his house and his church <lb/> and his clothes and
      his books and his choice food to a hideous <lb/> wilderness of sand and rocks and snow, and
      ice and sleet and <lb/> storm and blistering sun, with no shelter, no bed, no covering <lb/>
      for his and his family's naked bodies, and nothing to eat but <lb/> snakes and grubs and
      offal. This would be a hell to him; and <lb/> if he had any wisdom he would know that his own
      civilization <lb/> is a hell to the savage&mdash;but he hasn't any, and has never had
      <lb/> any; and for lack of it he shut up those poor natives in the <lb/> unimaginable
      perdition of his civilization, committing his crime <lb/> with the very best intentions, and
      saw those poor creatures <lb/> waste away under his tortures; and gazed at it, vaguely <lb/>
      troubled and sorrowful, and wondered what could be the <reg orig="mat-|ter">matter</reg>
      <lb/> with them. One is almost betrayed into respecting those <lb/> criminals, they were so
      sincerely kind, and tender, and humane, <lb/> and well-meaning.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">They</hi> didn't know why those exiled savages faded away, <lb/> and they

      it back to mind.</p>
     <p>A few years before the outbreak of the Civil War it began <lb/> to appear that Memphis,
      Tennessee, was going to be a great <lb/> tobacco <hi rend="italic"
      >entrepot</hi>&mdash;the wise could see the signs of it. At that <lb/> time Memphis had a
      wharfboat, of course. There was a paved <lb/> sloping wharf, for the accommodation of freight,
      but the <lb/> steamers landed on the outside of the wharfboat, and all <reg orig="load-|ing"
       >loading</reg>
      <lb/> and unloading was done across it, between steamer and <lb/> shore. A number of wharfboat
      clerks were needed, and part <lb/> of the time, every day, they were very busy, and part of
      the <lb/> time tediously idle. They were boiling over with youth and <lb/> spirits, and they
      had to make the intervals of idleness endurable <lb/>
      <pb n="269" entity="DSSR_000002496_0284"/> in some way; and as a rule, they did it by
      contriving practical <lb/> jokes and playing them upon each other.</p>
     <p>The favorite butt for the jokes was Ed Jackson, because <lb/> he played none himself, and
      was easy game for other people's <lb/> &mdash;for he always believed whatever was told
      him.</p>
     <p>One day he told the others his scheme for his holiday. He <lb/> was not going fishing or
      hunting this time&mdash;no, he had <lb/> thought out a better plan. Out of his $40 a
      month he had <lb/> saved enough for his purpose, in an economical way, and he <lb/> was going
      to have a look at New York.</p>
     <p>It was a great and surprising idea. It meant travel&mdash; <lb/> immense
      travel&mdash;in those days it meant seeing the world; it <lb/> was the equivalent of a
      voyage around it in ours. At first the <lb/> other youths thought his mind was affected, but
      when they <lb/> found that he was in earnest, the next thing to be thought of <lb/> was, what
      sort of opportunity this venture might afford for a <lb/> practical joke.</p>
     <p>The young men studied over the matter, then held a secret <lb/> consultation and made a
      plan. The idea was, that one of the <lb/> conspirations should offer Ed a letter of
      introduction to <reg orig="Com-|modore">Commodore</reg>
      <lb/> Vanderbilt, and trick him into delivering it. It would <lb/> be easy to do this. But
      what would Ed do when he got back <lb/> to Memphis? That was a serious matter. He was <reg
       orig="good-|hearted">goodhearted</reg>, <lb/> and had always taken the jokes patiently; but
      they <lb/> had been jokes which did not humiliate him, did not bring him <lb/> to shame;
      whereas, this would be a cruel one in that way, and <lb/> to play it was to meddle with fire;
      for with all his good nature, <lb/> Ed was a Southerner&mdash;and the English of that
      was, that <lb/> when he came back he would kill as many of the conspirators <lb/> as he could
      before falling himself. However, the chances must <lb/> be taken&mdash;it wouldn't do to
      waste such a joke as that.</p>
     <p>So the letter was prepared with great care and elaboration. <lb/> It was signed Alfred
      Fairchild, and was written in an easy</p>
     <pb n="270" entity="DSSR_000002496_0285"/>
     <p>and friendly spirit. It stated that the bearer was the bosom <lb/> friend of the writer's
      son, and was of good parts and sterling <lb/> character, and it begged the Commodore to be
      kind to the <lb/> young stranger for the writer's sake. It went on to say, "You <lb/> may have
      forgotten me, in this long stretch of time, but you <lb/> will easily call me back out of your
      boyhood memories when I <lb/> remind you of how we robbed old Stevenson's orchard that <lb/>
      night; and how, while he was chasing down the road after us, <lb/> we cut across the field and
      doubled back and sold his own <lb/> apples to his own cook for a hatfull of doughnuts; and the
      <lb/> time that we&mdash;" and so forth and so on, bringing in names of <lb/> imaginary
      comrades, and detailing all sorts of wild and absurd <lb/> and, of course, wholly imaginary
      schoolboy pranks and <reg orig="ad-|ventures">adventures</reg>, <lb/> but putting them into
      lively and telling shape.</p>
     <p>With all gravity Ed was asked if he would like to have <lb/> a letter to Commodore
      Vanderbilt, the great millionaire. It <lb/> was expected that the question would astonish Ed,
      and it did.</p>
     <p>"What? Do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know that extraordinary man?"</p>
     <p>"No; but my father does. They were schoolboys together. <lb/> And if you like, I'll write
      and ask father. I know he'll be <lb/> glad to give it to you for my sake."</p>
     <p>Ed could not find words capable of expressing his <reg orig="grati-|tude">gratitude</reg>
      <lb/> and delight. The three days passed, and the letter was <lb/> put into his hands. He
      started on his trip, still pouring out his <lb/> thanks while he shook good-bye all around.
      And when he <lb/> was out of sight his comrades let fly their laughter in a storm <lb/> of
      happy satisfaction&mdash;and then quieted down, and were less <lb/> happy, less
      satisfied. For the old doubts as to the wisdom of <lb/> this deception began to intrude again.</p>
     <p>Arrived in New York, Ed found his way to Commodore <lb/> Vanderbilt's business quarters, and
      was ushered into a large <lb/> anteroom, where a score of people were patiently awaiting <lb/>
      their turn for a two-minute interview with the millionaire in <lb/>
      <pb n="271" entity="DSSR_000002496_0286"/> his private office. A servant asked for Ed's card,
      and got the <lb/> letter instead. Ed was sent for a moment later, and found <lb/> Mr.
      Vanderbilt alone, with the letter&mdash;open&mdash;in his hand.</p>
     <p>"Pray sit down, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>
     <p>"Jackson."</p>
     <p>"Ah&mdash;sit down, Mr. Jackson. By the opening sentences <lb/> it seems to be a letter
      from an old friend. Allow me&mdash;I will <lb/> run my eye through it. He
      says&mdash;he says&mdash;why, who <hi rend="italic">is </hi>
      <lb/> it?" He turned the sheet and found the signature. "Alfred <lb/>
      Fairchild&mdash;hm&mdash;Fairchild&mdash;I don't recall the name. But <lb/>
      that is nothing&mdash;a thousand names have gone from me. He says <lb/> &mdash;he
      says&mdash;hm&mdash;hm&mdash;oh, dear, but it's good! Oh, it's rare! <lb/> I
      don't <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> remember it, but I <hi rend="italic">seem</hi>
      to&mdash;it'll all come back to <lb/> me presently. He says&mdash;he
      says&mdash;hm&mdash;hm&mdash;oh, but that was <lb/> a game! Oh, spl-endid! How
      it carries me back! It's all <lb/> dim, of course&mdash;it's a long time
      ago&mdash;and the names&mdash;<hi rend="italic">some </hi>
      <lb/> of the names are wavery and indistinct&mdash;but sho', I know it <lb/>
      happened&mdash;I can <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> it! and lord, how it warms my heart,
      <lb/> and brings back my lost youth! Well, well, well, I've got to <lb/> come back into this
      work-a-day world now&mdash;business presses <lb/> and people are waiting&mdash;I'll
      keep the rest for bed to-night, <lb/> and live my youth over again. And you'll thank Fairchild
      for <lb/> me when you see him&mdash;I used to call him Alf, I think&mdash;and <lb/>
      you'll give him my gratitude for what this letter has done for <lb/> the tired spirit of a
      hard-worked man; and tell him there <lb/> isn't anything that I can do for him or any friend
      of his that <lb/> I won't do. And as for you, my lad, you are my guest; you <lb/> can't stop
      at any hotel in New York. Sit where you are a <lb/> little while, till I get through with
      these people, then we'll go <lb/> home. I'll take care of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, my
      boy&mdash;make yourself easy as <lb/> to that."</p>
     <p>Ed stayed a week, and had an immense time&mdash;and never <lb/> suspected that the
      Commodore's shrewd eye was on him, and</p>
     <pb n="272" entity="DSSR_000002496_0287"/>
     <p>that he was daily being weighed and measured and analyzed <lb/> and tried and tested.</p>
     <p>Yes, he had an immense time; and never wrote home, but <lb/> saved it all up to tell when he
      should get back. Twice, with <lb/> proper modesty and decency, he proposed to end his visit,
      but <lb/> the Commodore said, "No&mdash;wait; leave it to me; I'll tell <lb/> you when to
      go."</p>
     <p>In those days the Commodore was making some of those <lb/> vast combinations of
      his&mdash;consolidations of warring odds and <lb/> ends of railroads into harmonious
      systems, and concentrations <lb/> of floating and rudderless commerce in effective
      centers&mdash;and <lb/> among other things his far-seeing eye had detected the <reg
       orig="con-|vergence">convergence</reg>
      <lb/> of that huge tobacco-commerce, already spoken of, <lb/> toward Memphis, and he had
      resolved to set his grasp upon it <lb/> and make it his own.</p>
     <p>The week came to an end. Then the Commodore said:</p>
     <p>"Now you can start home. But first we will have some <lb/> more talk about that tobacco
      matter. I know you now. I <lb/> know your abilities as well as you know them <reg
       orig="yourself&mdash;per-|haps">yourself&mdash;perhaps</reg>
      <lb/> better. You understand that tobacco matter; you <reg orig="un-|derstand">understand</reg>
      <lb/> that I am going to take possession of it, and you also <lb/> understand the plans which
      I have matured for doing it. <lb/> What I want is a man who knows my mind, and is qualified
      <lb/> to represent me in Memphis, and be in supreme command of <lb/> that important
      business&mdash;and I appoint you."</p>
     <p>"Me!"</p>
     <p>"Yes. Your salary will be high&mdash;of course&mdash;for you are <lb/>
      representing me. Later you will earn increases of it, and <lb/> will get them. You will need a
      small army of assistants; <lb/> choose them yourself&mdash;and carefully. Take no man for
      <lb/> friendship's sake; but, all things being equal, take the man <lb/> you know, take your
      friend, in preference to the stranger." <lb/> After some further talk under this head, the
      Commodore said:</p>
     <pb n="273" entity="DSSR_000002496_0288"/>
     <p>"Good-bye, my boy, and thank Alf for me, for sending you <lb/> to me."</p>
     <p>When Ed reached Memphis he rushed down to the wharf <lb/> in a fever to tell his great news
      and thank the boys over and <lb/> over again for thinking to give him the letter to Mr. <reg
       orig="Vander-|bilt">Vanderbilt</reg>. <lb/> It happened to be one of those idle times.
      Blazing hot <lb/> noonday, and no sign of life on the wharf. But as Ed <lb/> threaded his way
      among the freight piles, he saw a white linen <lb/> figure stretched in slumber upon a pile of
      grain-sacks under an <lb/> awning, and said to himself, "That's one of them," and <reg
       orig="has-|tened">hastened</reg>
      <lb/> his step; next, he said, "It's Charley&mdash;it's Fairchild&mdash; <lb/>
      good"; and the next moment laid an affectionate hand on the <lb/> sleeper's shoulder. The eyes
      opened lazily, took one glance, <lb/> the face blanched, the form whirled itself from the
      sack-pile, <lb/> and in an instant Ed was alone and Fairchild was flying for <lb/> the
      wharfboat like the wind!</p>
     <p>Ed was dazed, stupefied. Was Fairchild crazy? What <lb/> could be the meaning of this? He
      started slow and dreamily <lb/> down toward the wharfboat; turned the corner of a <reg
       orig="freight-|pile">freight-pile</reg>
      <lb/> and came suddenly upon two of the boys. They were <lb/> lightly laughing over some
      pleasant matter; they heard his <lb/> step, and glanced up just as he discovered them; the
      laugh <lb/> died abruptly; and before Ed could speak they were off, and <lb/> sailing over
      barrels and bales like hunted deer. Again Ed was <lb/> paralyzed. Had the boys all gone mad?
      What <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be the <lb/> explanation of this extraordinary conduct? And
      so, <reg orig="dream-|ing">dreaming</reg>
      <lb/> along, he reached the wharfboat, and stepped aboard&mdash; <lb/> nothing but
      silence there, and vacancy. He crossed the deck, <lb/> turned the corner to go down the outer
      guard, heard a fervent&mdash;</p>
     <p>"O lord!" and saw a white linen form plunge overboard.</p>
     <p>The youth came up coughing and strangling, and cried out&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Go' way from here! You let me alone. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> didn't do it, I <lb/> swear I
      didn't!"</p>
     <pb n="274" entity="DSSR_000002496_0289"/>
     <p>"Didn't do <hi rend="italic">what?</hi>"</p>
     <p>"Give you the&mdash;"</p>
     <p>"Never mind what you didn't do&mdash;come out of that! <lb/> What makes you all act
      <lb/> so? What have <hi rend="italic">I</hi> done?"</p>
     <figure id="f77" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002496_0289">
      <p>"GO 'WAY FROM HERE!"</p>
     </figure>
     <p>"You? Why <hi rend="italic">you </hi>
      <lb/> haven't done anything. <lb/> But&mdash;"</p>
     <p>"Well, then, what have <lb/> you got against me? <lb/> What do you all treat me <lb/> so
      for?"</p>
     <p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;but haven't <lb/> you got anything against <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">us?"</hi></p>
     <p>"Ofcourse not. What <lb/> put such a thing into your head?"</p>
     <p>"Honor bright&mdash;you haven't?"</p>
     <p>"Honor bright."</p>
     <pb n="275" entity="DSSR_000002496_0290"/>
     <p>"Swear it!"</p>
     <p>"I don't know what in the <hi rend="italic">world</hi> you mean, but I swear it, <lb/>
      anyway."</p>
     <p>"And you'll shake hands with me?"</p>
     <p>"Goodness knows I'll be <hi rend="italic">glad</hi> to! Why, I'm just starving <lb/> to
      shake hands with <hi rend="italic">somebody!"</hi></p>
     <p>The swimmer muttered, "Hang him, he smelt a rat and <lb/> never delivered the
      letter!&mdash;but it's all right, I'm not going <lb/> to fetch up the subject." And he
      crawled out and came <reg orig="drip-|ping">dripping</reg>
      <lb/> and draining to shake hands. First one and then another <lb/> of the conspirators showed
      up cautiously&mdash;armed to the teeth <lb/> &mdash;took in the amicable situation,
      then ventured warily <reg orig="for-|ward">forward</reg>
      <lb/> and joined the love-feast.</p>
     <p>And to Ed's eager inquiry as to what made them act as <lb/> they had been acting, they
      answered evasively, and pretended <lb/> that they had put it up as a joke, to see what he
      would do. It <lb/> was the best explanation they could invent at such short notice. <lb/> And
      each said to himself, "He never delivered that letter, and <lb/> the joke is on <hi
       rend="italic">us</hi>, if he only knew it or we were dull enough to <lb/> come out and tell."</p>
     <p>Then, of course, they wanted to know all about the trip; <lb/> and he said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Come right up on the boiler deck and order the drinks&mdash; <lb/> it's my treat. I'm
      going to tell you all about it. And to-night <lb/> it's my treat again&mdash;and we'll
      have oysters and a time!"</p>
     <p>When the drinks were brought and cigars lighted, Ed said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Well, when I delivered the letter to Mr. Vanderbilt&mdash;"</p>
     <p>"Great Scott!"</p>
     <p>"Gracious, how you scared me. What's the matter?"</p>
     <p>"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;nothing. Nothing&mdash;it was a tack in the <lb/>
      chair-seat," said one.</p>
     <p>"But you <hi rend="italic">all</hi> said it. However, no matter. When I <reg
       orig="deliv-|ered">delivered</reg>
      <lb/> the letter&mdash;"</p>
     <pb n="276" entity="DSSR_000002496_0291"/>
     <p>"<hi rend="italic">Did</hi> you deliver it?" And they looked at each other as <lb/> people
      might who thought that maybe they were dreaming.</p>
     <p>Then they settled to listening; and as the story deepened <lb/> and its marvels grew, the
      amazement of it made them dumb, <lb/> and the interest of it took their breath. They hardly
      uttered <lb/> a whisper during two hours, but sat like petrifactions and <lb/> drank in the
      immortal romance. At last the tale was ended, <lb/> and Ed said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"And it's all owing to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, boys, and you'll never find <hi
       rend="italic">me </hi>
      <lb/> ungrateful&mdash;bless your hearts, the best friends a fellow ever <lb/> had!
      You'll all have places; I want every one of you. I <lb/>

      please Mr. Vanderbilt, who <hi rend="italic">said</hi> it <lb/> would! And here's to that
      great man&mdash;drink hearty!"</p>
     <p>Yes, when the Moment comes, the Man appears&mdash;even if <lb/> he is a thousand miles
      away, and has to be discovered by a <lb/> practical joke.</p>

     <argument>
      <p>When people do not respect us we are sharply offended; yet deep down in his <lb/> private
       heart no man much respects himself.<bibl>
        <author>&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.</hi></author>
       </bibl></p>
     </argument>
     <p><hi rend="small-caps">Necessarily</hi>, the human interest is the first interest <lb/> in
      the log-book of any country. The annals of <reg orig="Tas-|mania">Tasmania</reg>, <lb/> in
      whose shadow we were sailing, are lurid <lb/> with that feature. Tasmania was a convict-dump,
      in old <lb/> times; this has been indicated in the account of the <reg orig="Concil-|iator"
       >Conciliator</reg>, <lb/> where reference is made to vain attempts of desperate <lb/>
      convicts to win to permanent freedom, after escaping from <lb/> Macquarrie Harbor and the
      "Gates of Hell." In the early <lb/> days Tasmania had a great population of convicts, of both
      <lb/> sexes and all ages, and a bitter hard life they had. In one spot <lb/> there was a
      settlement of juvenile convicts&mdash;children&mdash;who <lb/> had been sent thither
      from their home and their friends on <lb/> the other side of the globe to expiate their
      "crimes."</p>
     <p>In due course our ship entered the estuary called the <reg orig="Der-|went">Derwent</reg>,
      <lb/> at whose head stands Hobart, the capital of Tasmania. <lb/> The Derwent's shores furnish
      scenery of an interesting sort. <lb/> The historian Laurie, whose book," The Story of
      Australasia," <lb/> is just out, invoices its features with considerable truth and <reg
       orig="in-|temperance">intemperance</reg>: <lb/> "The marvelous picturesqueness of every point
      <lb/> of view, combined with the clear balmy atmosphere and the <lb/> transparency of the
      ocean depths, must have delighted and <lb/> deeply impressed" the early explorers. "If the
      rock-bound <lb/> coasts, sullen, defiant, and lowering, seemed uninviting, <lb/> these were
      occasionally broken into charmingly alluring coves <lb/> floored with golden sand, clad with
      evergreen shrubbery, and</p>
     <pb n="280" entity="DSSR_000002496_0295"/>
     <p>adorned with every variety of indigenous wattle, she-oak, wild <lb/> flower, and fern, from
      the delicately graceful 'maiden-hair' to <lb/> the palm-like 'old man'; while the majestic
      gum-tree, clean <lb/> and smooth as the mast of 'some tall ammiral' pierces the <lb/> clear
      air to the height of 230 feet or more."</p>
     <p>It looked so to me. "Coasting along Tasman's Peninsula, <lb/> what a shock of pleasant
      wonder must have struck the early <lb/> mariner on suddenly sighting Cape Pillar, with its
      cluster of <lb/> black-ribbed basaltic columns rising to a height of 900 feet, the <lb/> hydra
      head wreathed in a turban of fleecy cloud, the base <lb/> lashed by jealous waves spouting
      angry fountains of foam."</p>
     <p>That is well enough, but I did not suppose those snags <lb/> were 900 feet high. Still they
      were a very fine show. They <lb/> stood boldly out by themselves, and made a fascinatingly odd
      <lb/> spectacle. But there was nothing about their appearance to <lb/> suggest the heads of a
      hydra. They looked like a row of lofty <lb/> slabs with their upper ends tapered to the shape
      of a <reg orig="carving-|knife">carving-knife</reg>
      <lb/> point; in fact, the early voyager, ignorant of their great <lb/> height, might have
      mistaken them for a rusty old rank of piles <lb/> that had sagged this way and that out of the
      perpendicular.</p>
     <p>The Peninsula is lofty, rocky, and densely clothed with <lb/> scrub, or brush, or both. It
      is joined to the main by a low <lb/> neck. At this junction was formerly a convict station
      called <lb/> Port Arthur&mdash;a place hard to escape from. Behind it was <lb/> the
      wilderness of scrub, in which a fugitive would soon starve; <lb/> in front was the narrow
      neck, with a cordon of chained dogs <lb/> across it, and a line of lanterns, and a fence of
      living guards, <lb/> armed. We saw the place as we swept by&mdash;that is, we had a <lb/>
      glimpse of what we were told was the entrance to Port <lb/> Arthur. The glimpse was worth
      something, as a <reg orig="remem-|brancer">remembrancer</reg>, <lb/> but that was all.</p>
     <p>"The voyage thence up the Derwent Frith displays a <lb/> grand succession of fairy visions,
      in its entire length elsewhere <lb/>
      <pb n="281" entity="DSSR_000002496_0296"/> unequaled. In gliding over the deep blue sea
      studded with <lb/> lovely islets luxuriant to the water's edge, one is at a loss <lb/> which
      scene to choose for contemplation and to admire most. <lb/> When the Huon and Bruni have been
      passed, there seems no <lb/> possible chance of a rival; but suddenly Mount Wellington, <lb/>
      massive and noble like his brother Etna, literally heaves in sight, <lb/> sternly guarded on
      either hand by Mounts Nelson and Rumney; <lb/> presently we arrive at Sullivan's
      Cove&mdash;Hobart!"</p>
     <p>It is an attractive town. It sits on low hills that slope to <lb/> the harbor&mdash;a
      harbor that looks like a river, and is as smooth <lb/> as one. Its still surface is pictured
      with dainty reflections of <lb/> boats and grassy banks and luxuriant foliage. Back of the
      <lb/> town rise highlands that are clothed in woodland loveliness, <lb/> and over the way is
      that noble mountain, Wellington, a <lb/> stately bulk, a most majestic pile. How beautiful is
      the whole <lb/> region, for form, and grouping, and opulence, and freshness of <lb/> foliage,
      and variety of color, and grace and shapeliness of the <lb/> hills, the capes, the
      promontories; and then, the splendor of <lb/> the sunlight, the dim rich distances, the charm
      of the <reg orig="water-|glimpses">water-glimpses</reg>! <lb/> And it was in this paradise
      that the yellow-liveried <lb/> convicts were landed, and the Corps-bandits quartered, and the
      <lb/> wanton slaughter of the kangaroo-chasing black innocents <reg orig="con-|summated"
       >consummated</reg>
      <lb/> on that autumn day in May, in the brutish old <lb/> time. It was all out of keeping with
      the place, a sort of <reg orig="bring-|ing">bringing</reg>
      <lb/> of heaven and hell together.</p>
     <p>The remembrance of this paradise reminds me that it was <lb/> at Hobart that we struck the
      head of the procession of Junior <lb/> Englands. We were to encounter other sections of it in
      New <lb/> Zealand, presently, and others later in Natal. Wherever the <lb/> exiled Englishman
      can find in his new home resemblances to his <lb/> old one, he is touched to the marrow of his
      being; the love that <lb/> is in his heart inspires his imagination, and these allied forces
      <lb/> transfigure those resemblances into authentic duplicates of the</p>
     <pb n="282" entity="DSSR_000002496_0297"/>
     <p>revered originals. It is beautiful, the feeling which works <lb/> this enchantment, and it
      compels one's homage; compels it, <lb/> and also compels one's assent&mdash;compels it
      always&mdash;even <lb/> when, as happens sometimes, one does not see the resemblances
      <lb/> as clearly as does the exile who is pointing them out.</p>
     <p>The resemblances do exist, it is quite true; and often they <lb/> cunningly approximate the
      originals&mdash;but after all, in the <lb/> matter of certain physical patent rights
      there is only one <lb/> England. Now that I have sampled the globe, I am not in <lb/> doubt.
      There is a beauty of Switzerland, and it is repeated <lb/> in the glaciers and snowy ranges of
      many parts of the earth; <lb/> there is a beauty of the fiord, and it is repeated in New
      Zealand <lb/> and Alaska; there is a beauty of Hawaii, and it is repeated in <lb/> ten
      thousand islands of the Southern seas; there is a beauty of <lb/> the prairie and the plain,
      and it is repeated here and there in <lb/> the earth; each of these is worshipful, each is
      perfect in its <lb/> way, yet holds no monopoly of its beauty; but that beauty <lb/> which is
      England is alone&mdash;it has no duplicate.</p>
     <p>It is made up of very simple details&mdash;just grass, and trees, <lb/> and shrubs, and
      roads, and hedges, and gardens, and houses, <lb/> and vines, and churches, and castles, and
      here and there a ruin <lb/> &mdash;and over it all a mellow dream-haze of history. But
      its <lb/> beauty is incomparable, and all its own.</p>
     <p>Hobart has a peculiarity&mdash;it is the neatest town that the <lb/> sun shines on; and
      I incline to believe that it is also the <lb/> cleanest. However that may be, its supremacy in
      neatness is <lb/> not to be questioned. There cannot be another town in the <lb/> world that
      has no shabby exteriors; no rickety gates and <lb/> fences, no neglected houses crumbling to
      ruin, no crazy and <lb/> unsightly sheds, no weed-grown front-yards of the poor, no <lb/>
      back-yards littered with tin cans and old boots and empty <lb/> bottles, no rubbish in the
      gutters, no clutter on the sidewalks, <lb/> no outer-borders fraying out into dirty lanes and
      tin-patched</p>
     <pb n="283" entity="DSSR_000002496_0298"/>
     <p>huts. No, in Hobart all the aspects are tidy, and all a comfort <lb/> to the eye; the
      modestest cottage looks combed and brushed, <lb/> and has its vines, its flowers, its neat
      fence, its neat gate, its <lb/> comely cat asleep on the window ledge.</p>
     <p>We had a glimpse of the museum, by courtesy of the <lb/> American gentleman who is curator
      of it. It has samples of <lb/> half-a-dozen different kinds of marsupials<ref target="n283.1"
       n="12">*</ref>
      <note id="n283.1" place="foot" n="12"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg>

       <p>A marsupial is a plantigrade vertebrate whose specialty is its pocket. In some <lb/>
        countries it is extinct, in the others it is rare. The first American marsupials were <lb/>
        Stephen girard, Mr. Astor, and the opossum; the principal marsupials of the <lb/> Southern
        Hemisphere are Mr. Rhodes, and the kangaroo. I, myself, am the latest <lb/> marsuipal. Also,
        I might boast that I have the largest pocket of them all. But <lb/> there is nothing in
        that.</p>
      </note> &mdash;one, the "<reg orig="Tas-|manian">Tasmanian</reg>
      <lb/> devil;" that is, I <hi rend="italic">think</hi> he was one of them. And <lb/> there was
      a fish with lungs. When the water dries up it can <lb/> live in the mud. Most curious of all
      was a parrot that kills <lb/> sheep. On one great sheep-run this bird killed a thousand <lb/>
      sheep in a whole year. He doesn't want the whole sheep, but <lb/> only the kidney-fat. This
      restricted taste makes him an <reg orig="ex-|pensive">expensive</reg>
      <lb/> bird to support. To get the fat he drives his beak in <lb/> and rips it out; the wound
      is mortal. This parrot furnishes a <lb/> notable example of evolution brought about by changed
      con <lb/> ditions. When the sheep culture was introduced, it presently <lb/> brought famine to
      the parrot by exterminating a kind of grub <lb/> which had always thitherto been the parrot's
      diet. The miseries <lb/> of hunger made the bird willing to eat raw flesh, since it could
      <lb/> get no other food, and it began to pick remnants of meat from <lb/> sheep skins hung out
      on the fences to dry. It soon came to prefer <lb/> sheep meat to any other food, and by and by
      it came to prefer <lb/> the kidney-fat to any other detail of the sheep. The parrot's bill
      <lb/> was not well shaped for digging out the fat, but Nature fixed <lb/> that matter; she
      altered the bill's shape, and now the parrot can <lb/> dig out kidney-fat better than the
      Chief Justice of the Supreme <lb/> Court, or anybody else, for that matter&mdash;even an
      Admiral.</p>
     <p>And there was another curiosity&mdash;quite a stunning one, I</p>
     <pb n="284" entity="DSSR_000002496_0299"/>
     <p>thought: Arrow-heads and knives just like those which <lb/> Primeval Man made out of flint,
      and thought he had done such <lb/> a wonderful thing&mdash;yes, and has been humored and
      coddled <lb/> in that superstition by this age of admiring scientists until <lb/> there is
      probably no living with him in the other world by <lb/> now. Yet here is his finest and nicest
      work exactly duplicated <lb/> in our day; and by people who have never heard of him or <lb/>
      his works: by aborigines who lived in the islands of these seas, <lb/> within our time. And
      they not only duplicated those works of <lb/> art but did it in the brittlest and most
      treacherous of substances <lb/> &mdash;<hi rend="italic">glass:</hi> made them out of old
      brandy bottles flung out of <lb/> the British camps; millions of tons of them. It is time for
      <lb/> Primeval Man to make a little less noise, now. He has had <lb/> his day. He is not what
      he used to be.</p>
     <p>We had a drive through a bloomy and odorous fairy-land, <lb/> to the Refuge for the
      Indigent&mdash;a spacious and comfortable <lb/> home, with hospitals, etc., for both
      sexes. There was a crowd <lb/> there, of the oldest people I have ever seen. It was like being
      <lb/> suddenly set down in a new world&mdash;a weird world where <lb/> Youth has never
      been, a world sacred to Age, and bowed <lb/> forms, and wrinkles. Out of the 359 persons
      present, 223 <lb/> were ex-convicts, and could have told stirring tales, no doubt, <lb/> if
      they had been minded to talk; 42 of the 359 were past 80, <lb/> and several were close upon
      90; the average age at death <lb/> there is 76 years. As for me, I have no use for that place;
      <lb/> it is too healthy. Seventy is old enough&mdash;after that, there is <lb/> too much
      risk. Youth and gaiety might vanish, any day&mdash;and <lb/> then, what is left? Death in
      life; death without its privileges, <lb/> death without its benefits. There were 185 women in
      that <lb/> Refuge, and 81 of them were ex-convicts.</p>
     <p>The steamer disappointed us. Instead of making a long <lb/> visit at Hobart, as usual, she
      made a short one. So we got but <lb/> a glimpse of Tasmania, and then moved on.</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> spent part of an afternoon and a night at sea, and <lb/>
      reached Bluff, in New Zealand, early in the morning. <lb/> Bluff is at the bottom of the
      middle island, and is <lb/> away down south, nearly forty-seven degrees below the <reg
       orig="equa-|tor">equator</reg>. <lb/> It lies as far south of the line as Quebec lies north
      of it, <lb/> and the climates of the two should be alike; but for some <lb/> reason or other
      it has not been so arranged. Quebec is hot in <lb/> the summer and cold in the winter, but
      Bluff's climate is less <lb/> intense; the cold weather is not very cold, the hot weather is
      <lb/> not very hot; and the difference between the hottest month <lb/> and the coldest is but
      17 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
     <p>In New Zealand the rabbit plague began at Bluff. The <lb/> man who introduced the rabbit
      there was banqueted and <lb/> lauded; but they would hang him, now, if they could get him.
      <lb/> In England the natural enemy of the rabbit is detested and <lb/> persecuted; in the
      Bluff region the natural enemy of the <lb/> rabbit is honored, and his person is sacred. The
      rabbit's <lb/> natural enemy in England is the poacher, in Bluff its natural <lb/> enemy is
      the stoat, the weasel, the ferret, the cat, and the <lb/> mongoose. In England any person
      below the Heir who is <lb/> caught with a rabbit in his possession must satisfactorily <reg
       orig="ex-|plain">explain</reg>
      <lb/> how it got there, or he will suffer fine and imprisonment, <lb/> together with
      extinction of his peerage; in Bluff, the cat <lb/> found with a rabbit in its possession does
      not have to explain <lb/> &mdash;everybody looks the other way; the person caught
      noticing <lb/>
      <pb n="286" entity="DSSR_000002496_0301"/> would suffer fine and imprisonment, with extinction
      of <reg orig="peer-|age">peerage</reg>. <lb/> This is a sure way to undermine the moral fabric
      of a <lb/> cat. Thirty years from now there will not be a moral cat in <lb/> New Zealand. Some
      think there is none there now. In <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg>
      <lb/> the poacher is watched, tracked, hunted&mdash;he dare not <lb/> show his face; in
      Bluff the cat, the weasel, the stoat, and the <lb/> mongoose go up and down, whither they
      will, unmolested. <lb/> By a law of the legislature, posted where all may read, it is <lb/>
      decreed that any person found in possession of one of these <lb/> creatures
      (dead) must satisfactorily explain the circumstances <lb/> or pay a fine of
      not less than &pound;5, nor more than
      &pound;20. The <lb/> revenue from this source is not large. Persons
      who want to <lb/> pay a hundred dollars for a dead cat are getting rarer and <lb/> rarer every
      day. This is bad, for the revenue was to go to the <lb/> endowment of a University. All
      governments are more or <lb/> less short-sighted: in England they fine the poacher, whereas
      <lb/> he ought to be banished to New Zealand. New Zealand <lb/> would pay his way, and give
      him wages.</p>

      The <reg orig="aborigi-|nals">aboriginals</reg>
      <lb/> of Australia and Tasmania <lb/> looked the savage, but these chiefs <lb/> looked like
      Roman patricians. The tattooing in these portraits <lb/> ought to suggest the savage, of
      course, but it does not. The <lb/> designs are so flowing and graceful and beautiful that they
      are <lb/> a most satisfactory decoration. It takes but fifteen minutes <lb/> to get reconciled
      to the tattooing, and but fifteen more to <lb/>
      <pb n="288" entity="DSSR_000002496_0303"/> perceive that it is just the thing. After that, the
      undecorated <lb/> European face is unpleasant and ignoble.</p>
     <p>Dr. Hockin gave us a ghastly curiosity&mdash;a lignified <reg orig="cater-|pillar"
       >caterpillar</reg>
      <lb/> with a plant growing out of the back of its neck&mdash;a <lb/> plant with a slender
      stem 4 inches high. It happened not by <lb/> accident, but by design&mdash;Nature's
      design. This caterpillar <lb/> was in the act of loyally carrying out a law inflicted upon
      <lb/> him by Nature&mdash;a law purposely inflicted upon him to get <lb/> him into
      trouble&mdash;a law which was a trap; in pursuance of <lb/> this law he made the proper
      preparations for turning himself <lb/> into a night-moth; that is to say, he dug a little
      trench, a little <lb/> grave, and then stretched himself out in it on his stomach and <lb/>
      partially buried himself&mdash;then Nature was ready for him. <lb/> She blew the spores
      of a peculiar fungus through the air&mdash; <lb/> with a purpose. Some of them fell into
      a crease in the back <lb/> of the caterpillar's neck, and began to sprout and
      grow&mdash;for <lb/> there was soil there&mdash;he had not washed his neck. The
      <lb/> roots forced themselves down into the worm's person, and <lb/> rearward along through
      its body, sucking up the creature's <lb/> juices for sap; the worm slowly died, and turned to
      wood. <lb/> And here he was now, a wooden caterpillar, with every detail <lb/> of his former
      physique delicately and exactly preserved and <lb/> perpetuated, and with that stem standing
      up out of him for <lb/> his monument&mdash;monument commemorative of his own loyalty
      <lb/> and of Nature's unfair return for it.</p>
     <p>Nature is always acting like that. Mrs. X. said (of <lb/> course) that the
      caterpillar was not conscious and didn't <lb/> suffer. She should have known better. No
      caterpillar can <lb/> deceive Nature. If this one couldn't suffer, Nature would <lb/> have
      known it and would have hunted up another caterpillar. <lb/> Not that she would have let this
      one go, merely because it <lb/> was defective. No. She would have waited and let him turn
      <lb/> into a night-moth; and then fried him in the candle.</p>
     <p>Nature cakes a fish's eyes over with parasites, so that it <lb/>
      <pb n="289" entity="DSSR_000002496_0304"/> shan't be able to avoid its enemies or find its
      food. She sends <lb/> parasites into a star-fish's system, which clog up its prongs <lb/> and
      swell them and make them so uncomfortable that the <lb/> poor creature delivers itself from
      the prong to ease its misery; <lb/> and presently it has to part with another prong for the
      sake <lb/> of comfort, and finally with a third. If it re-grows the <lb/> prongs, the parasite
      returns and the same thing is repeated. <lb/> And finally, when the ability to reproduce
      prongs is lost <lb/> through age, that poor old star-fish can't get around any more, <lb/> and
      so it dies of starvation.</p>
     <p>In Australia is prevalent a horrible disease due to an <lb/> "unperfected tape-worm."
      Unperfected&mdash;that is what they <lb/> call it, I do not know why, for it transacts
      business just as <lb/> well as if it were finished and frescoed and gilded, and all that.</p>

      compartment. <lb/> They were acquaintances of each other. I sat down facing the <lb/> one that
      sat at the starboard window. He had a good face, <lb/> and a friendly look, and I judged from
      his dress that he was a <lb/> dissenting minister. He was along toward fifty. Of his own <lb/>
      motion he struck a match, and shaded it with his hand for me <lb/> to light my cigar. I take
      the rest from my diary:</p>
     <pb n="291" entity="DSSR_000002496_0306"/>
     <p>In order to start conversation I asked him something about <lb/> Maryborough. He said, in a
      most pleasant&mdash;even musical&mdash; <lb/> voice, but with quiet and cultured
      decision:</p>
     <p>"It's a charming town, with a hell of a hotel."</p>
     <p>I was astonished. It seemed so odd to hear a minister <lb/> swear out loud. He went placidly
      on:</p>
     <p>"It's the worst hotel in Australia. Well, one may go <lb/> further, and say in Australasia."</p>
     <p>"Bad beds?"</p>
     <p>"No&mdash;none at all. Just sand-bags."</p>
     <p>"The pillows, too?"</p>
     <p>"Yes, the pillows, too. Just sand. And not a good quality <lb/> of sand. It packs too hard,
      and has never been screened. <lb/> There is too much gravel in it. It is like sleeping on
      nuts."</p>
     <p>"Isn't there any good sand?"</p>
     <p>"Plenty of it. There is as good bed-sand in this region as <lb/> the world can furnish.
      Aerated sand&mdash;and loose; but they <lb/> won't buy it. They want something that will
      pack solid, <lb/> and petrify."</p>
     <p>"How are the rooms?"</p>
     <p>"Eight feet square; and a sheet of iced oil-cloth to step <lb/> on in the morning when you
      get out of the sand-quarry."</p>
     <p>"As to lights?"</p>
     <p>"Coal-oil lamp."</p>
     <p>"A good one?"</p>
     <p>"No. It's the kind that sheds a gloom."</p>
     <p>"I like a lamp that burns all night."</p>
     <p>"This one won't. You must blow it out early."</p>
     <p>"That is bad. One might want it again in the night. <lb/> Can't find it in the dark."</p>
     <p>"There's no trouble; you can find it by the stench."</p>
     <p>"Wardrobe?"</p>
     <pb n="292" entity="DSSR_000002496_0307"/>
     <p>"Two nails on the door to hang seven suits of clothes on&mdash; <lb/> if you've got
      them."</p>
     <p>"Bells?"</p>
     <p>"There aren't any."</p>
     <p>"What do you do when you want service?"</p>
     <p>"Shout. But it won't fetch anybody."</p>
     <p>"Suppose you want the chambermaid to empty the <reg orig="slop-|jar">slop-jar</reg>?"</p>
     <p>"There isn't any slop-jar. The hotels don't keep them. <lb/> That is, outside of Sydney and
      Melbourne."</p>
     <p>"Yes, I knew that. I was only talking. It's the oddest <lb/> thing in Australia. Another
      thing: I've got to get up in the <lb/> dark, in the morning, to take <lb/> the 5 o'clock
      train. Now <lb/> if the boots&mdash;"</p>

      <lb/> the lookout for you; you won't have any trouble. Sleep in <lb/> peace; he will rout you
      out, and you will make your train. <lb/> Where is your manager?"</p>
     <p>"I left him at Ballarat, studying the language. And <lb/> besides, he had to go to Melbourne
      and get us ready for New <lb/> Zealand. I've not tried to pilot myself before, and it doesn't
      <lb/> look easy."</p>
     <p>"Easy! You've selected the very most difficult piece of <lb/> railroad in Australia for your
      experiment. There are twelve <lb/> miles of this road which no man without good executive
      ability <lb/> can ever hope&mdash;tell me, have you good executive ability?&mdash;
      <lb/> first-rate executive ability?"</p>
     <p>"I&mdash;well, I think so, but&mdash;"</p>
     <p>"That settles it. The tone of&mdash;oh, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> wouldn't ever <lb/>

      got tickets?"</p>
     <p>"Yes&mdash;round trip; all the way to Sydney."</p>
     <p>"Ah, there it is, you see! You are going in the 5 o'clock <lb/> by

      <lb/> order to save two hours of fooling along the road. <lb/> Now then, don't

      of hauling, but that's <lb/> nothing; your ticket is by Ballarat, and it isn't good over that
      <lb/> twelve miles, and so&mdash;"</p>
     <p>"But why should the government care which way I go?"</p>
     <p>"Goodness knows! Ask of the winds that far away with <lb/> fragments strewed the sea, as the
      boy that stood on the <reg orig="burn-|ing">burning</reg>
      <lb/> deck used to say. The government chooses to do its <reg orig="rail-|way">railway</reg>
      <lb/> business in its own way, and it doesn't know as much <lb/> about it as the French. In
      the beginning they tried idiots; <lb/> then they imported the French&mdash;which was
      going backwards, <lb/>
      <pb n="294" entity="DSSR_000002496_0309"/> you see; now it runs the roads
      itself&mdash;which is going <reg orig="back-|wards">backwards</reg>
      <lb/> again, you see. Why, do you know, in order to curry <lb/> favor with the voters, the
      government puts down a road <lb/> wherever anybody wants it&mdash;anybody that owns two
      sheep <lb/> and a dog; and by consequence we've got, in the colony of <lb/> Victoria, 800
      railway stations, and the business done at eighty <lb/> of them doesn't foot up twenty
      shillings a week."</p>
     <p>"Five dollars? Oh, come!"</p>
     <p>"It's true. It's the absolute truth."</p>
     <p>"Why, there are three or four men on wages at every <reg orig="sta-|tion">station</reg>."</p>
     <p>"I know it. And the station-business doesn't pay for the <lb/> sheep-dip to sanctify their
      coffee with. It's just as I say. And <lb/> accommodating? Why, if you shake a rag the train
      will stop <lb/> in the midst of the wilderness to pick you up. All that kind <lb/> of politics
      costs, you see. And then, besides, any town that <lb/> has a good many votes and wants a fine
      station, gets it. Don't <lb/> you overlook that Maryborough station, if you take an <reg
       orig="inter-|est">interest</reg>
      <lb/> in governmental curiosities. Why, you can put the whole <lb/> population of Maryborough
      into it, and give them a sofa apiece, <lb/> and have room for more. You haven't fifteen
      stations in <lb/> America that are as big, and you probably haven't five that <lb/> are half
      as fine. Why, it's per-fectly elegant. And the clock! <lb/> Everybody will show you the clock.
      There isn't a station in <lb/> Europe that's got such a clock. It doesn't
      strike&mdash;and that's <lb/> one mercy. It hasn't any bell; and as you'll have cause to
      <lb/> remember, if you keep your reason, all Australia is simply <reg orig="be-|damned"

      he's waiting, <lb/> then his journey in a nice train would be a grateful change. <lb/> But no,
      that would be common sense&mdash;and out of place in a <lb/> government. And then,

      twelve miles, and&mdash;"</p>
     <p>"Well, in any case&mdash;"</p>
     <p>"Wait&mdash;there's more. Leave that American out of the <lb/> account and see what

     <p>"But can't I pay the conductor?"</p>
     <p>"No, he is not authorized to receive the money, and he <lb/> won't. You must climb out.
      There's no other way. I tell <lb/> you, the railway management is about the only thoroughly

      <lb/> Oh, yes, even to the peanut-commerce of weighing baggage."</p>
     <p>The train slowed up at his place. As he stepped out he said:</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was Junior England all the way to Christchurch&mdash;in
      <lb/> fact, just a garden. And Christchurch is an English <lb/> town, with an English-park
      annex, and a winding English <lb/> brook just like the Avon&mdash;and named the Avon; but
      from a <lb/> man, not from Shakespeare's river. Its grassy banks are <lb/> bordered by the
      stateliest and most impressive weeping <reg orig="wil-|lows">willows</reg>
      <lb/> to be found in the world, I suppose. They continue the <lb/> line of a great ancestor;
      they were grown from sprouts of the <lb/> willow that sheltered Napoleon's grave in St.
      Helena. It is a <lb/> settled old community, with all the serenities, the graces, the <lb/>
      conveniences, and the comforts of the ideal home-life. If it <lb/> had an established Church
      and social inequality it would be <lb/> England over again with hardly a lack.</p>
     <p>In the museum we saw many curious and interesting <lb/> things; among others a fine native
      house of the olden time, <lb/> with all the details true to the facts, and the showy colors
      <lb/> right and in their proper places. All the details: the fine <lb/> mats and rugs and
      things; the elaborate and wonderful wood <lb/> carvings&mdash;wonderful, surely,
      considering who did them&mdash; <lb/> wonderful in design and particularly in execution,
      for they <lb/> were done with admirable sharpness and exactness, and yet <lb/> with no better
      tools than flint and jade and shell could furnish; <lb/> and the totem-posts were there,
      ancestor above ancestor, with <lb/> tongues protruded and hands clasped comfortably over
      bellies <lb/> containing other people's ancestors&mdash;grotesque and ugly devils, <lb/>
      <pb n="298" entity="DSSR_000002496_0313"/> every one, but lovingly carved, and ably; and the
      stuffed <lb/> natives were present, in their proper places, and looking as <lb/> natural as
      life; and the housekeeping utensils were there, too, <lb/> and close at hand the carved and
      finely ornamented war canoe.</p>
     <p>And we saw little jade gods, to hand around the neck&mdash; <lb/> not everybody's, but
      sacred to the necks of natives of rank. <lb/> Also jade weapons, and many kinds of jade
      trinkets&mdash;all <lb/> made out of that excessively hard stone without the help of
      <lb/> any tool of iron. And some of these things <lb/> had small round holes bored through
      them&mdash; <lb/> nobody knows how it was done; a mystery, <lb/> a lost art. I think it
      was said that if you want <lb/> such a hole bored in a piece of jade now, you <lb/> must send
      it to London or Amsterdam where <lb/> the lapidaries are.</p>

     <p>Also we saw a complete skeleton <lb/> of the giant Moa. It stood ten feet <lb/> high, and
      must have been a sight <lb/> to look at when it was a living <lb/> bird. It was a kicker, like
      the <lb/> ostrich; in fight it did not use its <lb/> beak, but its foot. It must have <lb/>
      been a convincing kind of kick. <lb/> If a person had his back to the bird and did not see who
      it <lb/> was that did it, he would think he had been kicked by a <lb/> wind-mill.</p>
     <p>There must have been a sufficiency of moas in the old <lb/> forgotten days when his breed
      walked the earth. His bones <lb/> are found in vast masses, all crammed together in huge
      graves. <lb/> They are not in caves, but in the ground. Nobody knows how <lb/> they happened
      to get concentrated there. Mind, they are <lb/> bones, not fossils. This means that the moa
      has not been <lb/> extinct very long. Still, this is the only New Zealand creature <lb/>
      <pb n="299" entity="DSSR_000002496_0314"/> which has no mention in that otherwise
      comprehensive <reg orig="litera-|ture">literature</reg>, <lb/> the native legends. This is a
      significant detail, and is <lb/> good circumstantial evidence that the moa has been extinct
      <lb/> 500 years, since the Maori has himself&mdash;by tradition&mdash;been <lb/> in
      New Zealand since the end of the fifteenth century. He <lb/> came from an unknown
      land&mdash;the first Maori did&mdash;then <lb/> sailed back in his canoe and brought
      his tribe, and they <reg orig="re-|moved">removed</reg>
      <lb/> the aboriginal peoples into the sea and into the ground <lb/> and took the land. That is
      the tradition. That that first <lb/> Maori could come, is understandable, for anybody can come
      to <lb/> a place when he isn't trying to; but how that discoverer found <lb/> his way back
      home again without a compass is his secret, and <lb/> he died with it in him. His language
      indicates that he came <lb/> from Polynesia. He <hi rend="italic">told</hi> where he came
      from, but he couldn't <lb/> spell well, so one can't find the place on the map, because <lb/>
      people who could spell better than he could, spelt the <reg orig="resem-|blance">resemblance</reg>
      <lb/> all out of it when they made the map. However, it is <lb/> better to have a map that is
      spelt right than one that has <lb/> information in it.</p>
     <p>In New Zealand women have the right to vote for <reg orig="mem-|bers">members</reg>
      <lb/> of the legislature, but they cannot be members <reg orig="them-|selves"
      >themselves</reg>. <lb/> The law extending the suffrage to them went into <lb/> effect in
      1893. The population of Christchurch (census of <lb/> 1891) was 31,454. The
      first election under the law was held <lb/> in November of that year. Number of men who voted,
      6,313; <lb/> number of women who voted, 5,989. These figures ought to <lb/> convince us that
      women are not as indifferent about politics as <lb/> some people would have us believe. In New
      Zealand as a <lb/> whole, the estimated adult female population was 139,915; of <lb/> these
      109,461 qualified and registered their names on the rolls <lb/> &mdash;78.23 per cent. of
      the whole. Of these, 90,290 went to the <lb/> polls and voted&mdash;85.18 per cent. Do
      men ever turn out <lb/> better than that&mdash;in America or elsewhere? Here is a <reg
       orig="re-|mark">remark</reg>
      <lb/>
      <pb n="300" entity="DSSR_000002496_0315"/> to the other sex's credit, too&mdash;I take it
      from the official <lb/> report:</p>
     <p>"A feature of the election was the orderliness and sobriety <lb/> of the people. Women were
      in no way molested."</p>
     <p>At home, a standing argument against woman suffrage has <lb/> always been that women could
      not go to the polls without being <lb/> insulted. The arguments against woman suffrage have
      always <lb/> taken the easy form of prophecy. The prophets have been <lb/> prophesying ever
      since the woman's rights movement began in <lb/> 1848&mdash;and in forty-seven years they
      have never scored a hit.</p>
     <p>Men ought to begin to feel a sort of respect for their <lb/> mothers and wives and sisters
      by this time. The women <lb/> deserve a change of attitude like that, for they have wrought
      <lb/> well. In forty-seven years they have swept an imposingly <lb/> large number of unfair
      laws from the statute books of America. <lb/> In that brief time these serfs have set
      themselves free&mdash; <lb/> essentially. Men could not have done so much for themselves
      <lb/> in that time without bloodshed--at least they never have; <lb/> and that is argument
      that they didn't know how. The women <lb/> have accomplished a peaceful revolution, and a very
      beneficent <lb/> one; and yet that has not convinced the average man that <lb/> they are
      intelligent, and have courage and energy and <reg orig="perse-|verance">perseverance</reg>
      <lb/> and fortitude. It takes much to convince the average <lb/> man of anything; and perhaps
      nothing can ever make him <lb/> realize that he is the average woman's inferior&mdash;yet
      in several <lb/> important details the evidences seems to show that that is <lb/> what he is.
      Man has ruled the human race from the <reg orig="begin-|ning&mdash;but"
       >beginning&mdash;but</reg>
      <lb/> he should remember that up to the middle of the <lb/> present century it was a dull
      world, and ignorant and stupid; <lb/> but it is not such a dull world now, and is growing less
      and <lb/> less dull all the time. This is woman's opportunity&mdash;she has <lb/> had
      none before. I wonder where man will be in another <lb/> forty-seven years?</p>

     <p>In the New Zealand law occurs this: "The word <hi rend="italic">person</hi>

      her <lb/> callow kid of twenty-one. The white population of the colony <lb/> is 626,000, the

      to leave at midnight to-night. Mr. Kinsey gave me an <lb/> ornithorhyncus, and I am taming it.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">Sunday, 17th</hi>. Sailed last night in the <hi rend="italic">Flora</hi>,
      from <reg orig="Lyt-|telton">Lyttelton</reg>.</p>
     <p>So we did. I remember it yet. The people who sailed in <lb/> the <hi rend="italic"
      >Flora</hi> that night may forget some other things if they live <lb/> a good while, but they
      will not live long enough to forget <lb/> that. The <hi rend="italic">Flora</hi> is about the
      equivalent of a cattle-scow; <lb/> but when the Union Company find it inconvenient to keep a
      <lb/> contract and lucrative to break it, they smuggle her into <lb/> passenger service, and
      "keep the change."</p>
     <p>They give no notice of their projected depredation; you <lb/> innocently buy tickets for the
      advertised passenger boat, and <lb/> when you get down to Lyttelton at midnight, you find that
      <lb/> they have substituted the scow. They have plenty of good <lb/> boats, but no
      competition&mdash;and that is the trouble. It is too <lb/> late now to make other
      arrangements if you have engagements <lb/> ahead.</p>
     <p>It is a powerful company, it has a monopoly, and <reg orig="every-|body">everybody</reg>
      <lb/> is afraid of it&mdash;including the government's <reg orig="representa-|tive"
       >representative</reg>, <lb/> who stands at the end of the stage-plank to tally the <lb/>
      passengers and see that no boat receives a greater number <lb/> than the law allows her to
      carry. This conveniently-blind <lb/>
      <pb n="302" entity="DSSR_000002496_0317"/> representative saw the scow receive a number which
      was far <lb/> in excess of its privilege, and winked a politic wink and said <lb/> nothing.
      The passengers bore with meekness the cheat which <lb/> had been put upon them, and made no
      complaint.</p>
     <p>It was like being at home in America, where abused <lb/> passengers act in just the same
      way. A few days before, the <lb/> Union Company had discharged a captain for getting a boat
      <lb/> into danger, and had advertised this act as evidence of its <lb/> vigilance in looking
      after the safety of the passengers&mdash;for <lb/> thugging a captain costs the company
      nothing, but when <lb/> opportunity offered to send this dangerously overcrowded tub <lb/> to
      sea and save a little trouble and a tidy penny by it, it forgot <lb/> to worry about the
      passenger's safety.</p>
     <p>The first officer told me that the <hi rend="italic">Flora</hi> was privileged to <lb/>
      carry 125 passengers. She must have had all of 200 on board. <lb/> All the cabins were full,
      all the cattle-stalls in the main stable <lb/> were full, the spaces at the heads of
      companionways were full, <lb/> every inch of floor and table in the swill-room was packed
      <lb/> with sleeping men and remained so until the place was <lb/> required for breakfast, all
      the chairs and benches on the <reg orig="hurri-|cane">hurricane</reg>
      <lb/> deck were occupied, and <hi rend="italic">still</hi> there were people who had <lb/> to
      walk about all night!</p>
     <p>If the <hi rend="italic">Flora</hi> had gone down that night, half of the people <lb/> on
      board would have been wholly without means of escape.</p>
     <p>The owners of that boat were not technically guilty of <lb/> conspiracy to commit murder,
      but they were morally guilty <lb/> of it.</p>
     <p>I had a cattle-stall in the main stable&mdash;a cavern fitted up <lb/> with a long
      double file of two-storied bunks, the files separated <lb/> by a calico
      partition&mdash;twenty men and boys on one side of it, <lb/> twenty women and girls on
      the other. The place was as dark <lb/> as the soul of the Union Company, and smelt like a
      kennel. <lb/> When the vessel got out into the heavy seas and began to <lb/>
      <pb n="303" entity="DSSR_000002496_0318"/> pitch and wallow, the cavern prisoners became
      immediately <lb/> sea-sick, and then the peculiar results that ensued laid all my <lb/>
      previous experiences of the kind well away in the shade. <lb/> And the wails, the groans, the
      cries, <lb/> the shrieks, the strange <reg orig="ejacula-|tions&mdash;it"
       >ejaculations&mdash;it</reg>
      <lb/> was wonderful.</p>

     <p>The women and children <lb/> and some of the men <lb/> and boys spent the <lb/> night in
      that place, for <lb/> they were too ill to <lb/> leave it; but the rest <lb/> of us got up, by
      and <lb/> by, and finished the <lb/> night on the <reg orig="hurricane-|deck"
      >hurricane-deck</reg>.</p>
     <p>That boat was the <lb/> foulest I was ever in; <lb/> and the smell of the <lb/> breakfast
      saloon when <lb/> we threaded our way <lb/> among the layers of <lb/> steaming passengers
      <lb/> stretched upon its floor and its tables was incomparable for <lb/> efficiency.</p>
     <p>A good many of us got ashore at the first way-port to seek <lb/> another ship. After a wait
      of three hours we got good rooms <lb/> in the <hi rend="italic">Mahinapua</hi>, a wee little
      bridal-parlor of a boat&mdash;only <lb/> 205 tons burthen; clean and comfortable; good
      service; good <lb/> beds; good table, and no crowding. The seas danced her <lb/> about like a
      duck, but she was safe and capable.</p>
     <p>Next morning early she went through the French Pass&mdash;a <lb/> narrow gateway of
      rock, between bold headlands&mdash;so narrow, <lb/>
      <pb n="304" entity="DSSR_000002496_0319"/> in fact, that it seemed no wider than a street. The
      current <lb/> tore through there like a mill-race, and the boat darted <lb/> through like a
      telegram. The passage was made in half a <lb/> minute; then we were in a wide place where
      noble vast eddies <lb/> swept grandly round and round in shoal water, and I <reg
       orig="won-|dered">wondered</reg>
      <lb/> what they would do with the little boat. They did as <lb/> they pleased with her. They
      picked her up and flung her <lb/> around like nothing and landed her gently on the solid,
      smooth <lb/> bottom of sand&mdash;so gently, indeed, that we barely felt her <lb/> touch
      it, barely felt her quiver when she came to a standstill. <lb/> The water was as clear as
      glass, the sand on the bottom was <lb/> vividly distinct, and the fishes seemed to be swimming
      about <lb/> in nothing. Fishing lines were brought out, but before we <lb/> could bait the
      hooks the boat was off and away again.</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> soon reached the town of Nelson, and spent the <lb/> most of
      the day there, visiting acquaintances and <lb/> driving with them about the
      garden&mdash;the whole <lb/> region is a garden, excepting the scene of the "Maungatapu
      <lb/> Murders," of thirty years ago. That is a wild place&mdash;wild and <lb/> lonely; an
      ideal place for a murder. It is at the base of a <lb/> vast, rugged, densely timbered
      mountain. In the deep twilight <lb/> of that forest solitude four desperate
      rascals&mdash;Burgess, <lb/> Sullivan, Levy, and Kelley&mdash;ambushed themselves
      beside the <lb/> mountain trail to murder and rob four travelers&mdash;Kempthorne, <lb/>
      Mathieu, Dudley, and De Pontius, the latter a New Yorker. <lb/> A harmless old laboring man
      came wandering along, and as his <lb/> presence was an embarrassment, they choked him, hid
      him, and <lb/> then resumed their watch for the four. They had to wait a <lb/> while, but
      eventually everything turned out as they desired.</p>
     <p>That dark episode is the one large event in the history of <lb/> Nelson. The fame of it
      traveled far. Burgess made a <reg orig="con-|fession">confession</reg>. <lb/> It is a
      remarkable paper. For brevity, succinctness, <lb/> and concentration, it is perhaps without
      its peer in the <reg orig="litera-|ture">literature</reg>
      <lb/> of murder. There are no waste words in it; there is no <lb/> obtrusion of matter not
      pertinent to the occasion, nor any <reg orig="de-|parture">departure</reg>
      <lb/> from the dispassionate tone proper to a formal business <lb/> statement&mdash;for
      that is what it is: a business statement of a <lb/> murder, by the chief engineer of it, or
      superintendent, or <reg orig="fore-|man">foreman</reg>, <lb/> or whatever one may prefer to
      call him.</p>
     <pb n="306" entity="DSSR_000002496_0321"/>
     <p>"We were getting impatient, when we saw four men and a pack-horse <lb/> coming. I left my
      cover and had a look at the men, for Levy had told me <lb/> that Mathieu was a small man and
      wore a large beard, and that it was a <reg orig="chest-|nut">chestnut</reg>
      <lb/> horse. I said, 'Here they come.' They were then a good distance <lb/> away; I took the
      caps off my gun, and put fresh ones on. I said, 'You <lb/> keep where you are, I'll put them
      up, and you give me your gun while you <lb/> tie them.' It was arranged as I have described.
      The men came; they <lb/> arrived within about fifteen yards when I stepped up and said,
      'Stand! bail <lb/> up!' That means all of them to get together. I made them fall back on the
      <lb/> upper side of the road with their faces up the range, and Sullivan brought <lb/> me his
      gun, and then tied their hands behind them. The horse was very <lb/> quiet all the time, he
      did not move. When they were all tied, Sullivan took <lb/> the horse up the hill, and put him
      in the bush; he cut the rope and let the <lb/> swags<ref target="n306.1" n="13">*</ref>
      <note id="n306.1" place="foot" n="13"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg>

       <p>A "swag" is a kit, a pack, small baggage.</p>
      </note> fall on the ground, and then came to me. We then marched the men <lb/> down the
      incline to the creek; the water at this time barely running. Up <lb/> this creek we took the
      men; we went, I daresay, five or six hundred yards <lb/> up it, which took us nearly
      half-an-hour to accomplish. Then we turned to <lb/> the right up the range; we went, I
      daresay, one hundred and fifty yards <lb/> from the creek, and there we sat down with the men.
      I said to Sullivan, 'Put <lb/> down your gun and search these men,' which he did. I asked them
      their <lb/> several names; they told me. I asked them if they were expected at Nelson. <lb/>
      They said, 'No.' If such their lives would have been spared. In money <lb/> we took
      &pound;60 odd. I said, 'Is this all you have? You had better tell me.' <lb/> Sullivan
      said, 'Here is a bag of gold.' I said, 'What's on that pack-horse? <lb/> Is there any gold?'
      when Kempthorne said, 'Yes, my gold is in the <reg orig="port-|manteau">portmanteau</reg>,
      <lb/> and I trust you will not take it all.' 'Well,' I said, 'we must take <lb/> you away one
      at a time, because the range is steep just here, and then we will <lb/> let you go.' They
      said, 'All right,' most cheerfully. We tied their feet, and <lb/> took Dudley with us; we went
      about sixty yards with him. This was <lb/> through a scrub. It was arranged the night
      previously that it would be best <lb/> to choke them, in case the report of the arms might be
      heard from the road, <lb/> and if they were missed they never would be found. So we tied a
       <reg orig="handker-|chief">handkerchief</reg>
      <lb/> over his eyes, when Sullivan took the sash off his waist, put it round <lb/> his neck,
      and so strangled him. Sullivan, after I had killed the old laboring <lb/> man, found fault
      with the way he was choked. He said, 'The <hi rend="italic">next</hi> we do <lb/> I'll show
      you <hi rend="italic">my</hi> way.' I said, 'I have never done such a thing before. I <lb/>
      have shot a man, but never choked one.' We returned to the others, when <lb/> Kempthorne said,
      'What noise was that?' I said it was caused by breaking <lb/> through the scrub. This was
      taking too much time, so it was agreed to shoot <lb/> them. With that I said, 'We'll take you
      no further, but separate you, and <lb/> then loose one of you, and he can relieve the others.'
      So with that, Sullivan <lb/> took De Pontius to the left of where Kempthorne was sitting. I
      took <lb/> Mathieu to the right. I tied a strap round his legs, and shot him with a <reg
       orig="re-|volver">revolver</reg>. <lb/> He yelled, I ran from him with my gun in my hand, I
      sighted <lb/> Kempthorne, who had risen to his feet. I presented the gun, and shot him <lb/>
      <pb n="307" entity="DSSR_000002496_0322"/> behind the right ear; his life's blood welled from
      him, and he died <reg orig="instan-|taneously">instantaneously</reg>. <lb/> Sullivan had shot
      De Pontius in the meantime, and then came to <lb/> me. I said, 'Look to Mathieu,' indicating
      the spot where he lay. He shortly <lb/> returned and said, 'I had to "chiv" that fellow, he
      was not dead,' a cant word, <lb/> meaning that he had to stab him. Returning to the road we
      passed where <lb/> De Pontius lay and was dead Sullivan said, 'This is the digger, the others
      <lb/> were all storekeepers; this is the digger, let's cover him up, for should the <lb/>
      others be found, they'll think he done it and sloped,' meaning he had gone. <lb/> So with that
      we threw all the stones on him, and then left him. This bloody <lb/> work took nearly an hour
      and a half from the time we stopped the men."</p>
     <p>Anyone who reads that confession will think that the man <lb/> who wrote it was destitute of
      emotions, destitute of feeling. <lb/> That is partly true. As regarded others he was plainly
       <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg>
      <lb/> feeling&mdash;utterly cold and pitiless; but as regarded <reg orig="him-|self"
       >himself</reg>
      <lb/> the case was different. While he cared nothing for the <lb/> future of the murdered men,
      he cared a great deal for his <lb/> own. It makes one's flesh creep to read the introduction
      to <lb/> his confession. The judge on the bench characterized it as <lb/> "scandalously
      blasphemous," and it certainly reads so, but <lb/> Burgess meant no blasphemy. He was merely a
      brute, and <lb/> whatever he said or wrote was sure to expose the fact. His <lb/> redemption
      was a very real thing to him, and he was as <reg orig="jubi-|lantly">jubilantly</reg>
      <lb/> happy on the gallows as ever was Christian martyr at <lb/> the stake. We dwellers in
      this world are strangely made, and <lb/> mysteriously circumstanced. We have to suppose that
      the <lb/> murdered men are lost, and that Burgess is saved; but we <lb/> cannot suppress our
      natural regrets: <lb/>
      <q>"Written in my dungeon drear this 7th of August, in the year of Grace, 1866. <lb/> To God
       be ascribed all power and glory in subduing the rebellious spirit of a <lb/> most guilty
       wretch, who has been brought, through the instrumentality of a <lb/> faithful follower of
       Christ, to see his wretched and guilty state, inasmuch as <lb/> hitherto he has led an awful
       and wretched life, and through the assurance of <lb/> this faithful soldier of Christ, he has
       been led and also believes that Christ will <lb/> yet receive and cleanse him from all his
       deep-dyed and bloody sins. I lie <lb/> under the imputation which says, 'Come now and let us
       reason together, <lb/> saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white
       as <lb/> snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.' On this <lb/> promise
       I rely."</q></p>
     <p>We sailed in the afternoon late, spent a few hours at New <lb/>
      <pb n="308" entity="DSSR_000002496_0323"/> Plymouth, then sailed again and reached Auckland
      the next <lb/> day, November 20th, and remained in that fine city several <lb/> days. Its
      situation is commanding, and the sea-view is superb. <lb/> There are charming drives all
      about, and by courtesy of friends <lb/> we had opportunity to enjoy them. From the grassy <reg
       orig="crater-|summit">crater-summit</reg>
      <lb/> of Mount Eden one's eye ranges over a grand sweep <lb/> and variety of
      scenery&mdash;forests clothed in luxuriant foliage, <lb/> rolling green fields,
      conflagrations of flowers, receding and <lb/> dimming stretches of green plain, broken by
      lofty and <reg orig="sym-|metrical">symmetrical</reg>
      <lb/> old craters&mdash;then the blue bays twinkling and <reg orig="spark-|ling"
       >sparkling</reg>
      <lb/> away into the dreamy distances where the mountains loom <lb/> spiritual in their veils
      of haze.</p>
     <p>It is from Auckland that one goes to Rotorua, the region of <lb/> the renowned hot lakes and
      geysers&mdash;one of the chief <reg orig="won-|ders">wonders</reg>
      <lb/> of New Zealand; but I was not well enough to make the <lb/> trip. The government has a
      sanitorium there, and everything <lb/> is comfortable for the tourist and the invalid. The
       <reg orig="govern-|ment's">government's</reg>

      paralysis, and such things; but when he is talking <lb/> about the effectiveness of the waters
      in eradicating the <reg orig="whisky-|habit">whisky-habit</reg>, <lb/> he seems to have no
      reserves. The baths will cure the <lb/> drinking-habit no matter how chronic it
      is&mdash;and cure it so <lb/> effectually that even the <hi rend="italic">desire</hi> to
      drink intoxicants will come <lb/> no more. There should be a rush from Europe and America
      <lb/> to that place; and when the victims of alcoholism find out <lb/> what they can get by
      going there, the rush will begin.</p>
     <p>The Thermal-springs District of New Zealand comprises an <lb/> area of upwards of 600,000
      acres, or close on 1,000 square <lb/> miles. Rotorua is the favorite place. It is the center
      of a <lb/> rich field of lake and mountain scenery; from Rotorua as a base <lb/> the
      pleasure-seeker makes excursions. The crowd of sick people <lb/> is great, and growing.

     <p>It is from Auckland that the Kauri gum is shipped. For a <lb/> long time now about 8,000
      tons of it have been brought into <lb/> the town per year. It is worth about $300 per ton,
      unassorted; <lb/> assorted, the finest grades are worth about $1,000. It goes to <lb/>
      America, chiefly. It is in lumps, and is hard and smooth, and <lb/> looks like
      amber&mdash;the light-colored like new amber, and the <lb/> dark brown like rich old

     <p>The gum is dug up out of the ground; it has been there <lb/> for ages. It is the sap of the

      waterproof canvas <lb/> suits, and boots to the thigh. The deck was never quiet for <lb/> a
      moment, and seldom nearer level than a ladder, and noble <lb/> were the seas which leapt
      aboard and went flooding aft. We <lb/> rove a long line to the yard-arm, hung a most primitive

      aimed, and was grabbed by the <lb/> two men on the forecastle. A young fellow belonging to our
      <lb/> crew was in the chair, to be a protection to the lady-comers. <lb/> At once a couple of
      ladies appeared from below, took seats in <lb/> his lap, we hoisted them into the sky, waited

      Hastings, <lb/> twelve miles; time, fifty-five minutes&mdash;not so far short of <lb/>
      thirteen miles an hour. . . . A perfect summer day; cool <lb/> breeze, brilliant sky, rich
      vegetation. Two or three times <reg orig="dur-|ing">during</reg>
      <lb/> the afternoon we saw wonderfully dense and beautiful <lb/> forests, tumultuously piled
      skyward on the broken highlands <lb/> &mdash;not the customary roof-like slant of a
      hillside, where the <lb/> trees are all the same height. The noblest of these trees were of

      <lb/> the wood-paving for Europe, and is the best of all wood for <lb/> that purpose.
      Sometimes these towering upheavals of forestry <lb/> were festooned and garlanded with
      vine-cables, and sometimes <lb/> the masses of undergrowth were cocooned in another sort of
      <lb/> vine of a delicate cobwebby texture&mdash;they call it the "<reg

      <lb/> from its upper end. I do not know its name, but if there <lb/> is such a thing as a

      but from the <reg orig="group-|ings">groupings</reg>
      <lb/> of the figures I fancied that they represented the killing <lb/> of Napoleon Ill's son
      by the Zulus in South Africa. I broke <lb/> into the conversation, which was about poetry and
      cabbage <lb/> and art, and said to my wife&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Do you remember when the news came to Paris&mdash;"</p>
     <pb n="317" entity="DSSR_000002496_0332"/>

      came to Paris, for we were but seven <lb/> months from there and had been living there a

      hours. I do not know the <lb/> distance, but it must have been well along toward <lb/> fifty
      miles. The Fly could have spun it out to eight hours and <lb/> not discommoded me; for where
      there is comfort, and no need <lb/> for hurry, speed is of no value&mdash;at least to me;
      and nothing <lb/> that goes on wheels can be more comfortable, more <reg orig="satisfac-|tory"

      then, he ought to <lb/> get out and walk. That would change his spirit, perhaps? I <lb/> think
      so. At the end of an hour you would find him waiting <lb/> humbly beside the track, and glad
      to be taken aboard again.</p>
     <p>Much horseback riding, in and around this town; many <lb/> comely girls in cool and pretty

      <pb n="319" entity="DSSR_000002496_0334"/> such good houses, or such strong and ingenious and
      scientific <lb/> fortresses, or gave so much attention to agriculture, or had <lb/> military
      arts and devices which so nearly approached the white <lb/> man's. These, taken together with
      their high abilities in <reg orig="boat-|building">boat-building</reg>, <lb/> and their tastes
      and capacities in the ornamental arts, <lb/> modify their savagery to a

      <lb/> them, as they did the Australians and the Tasmanians, <lb/> but were content with
      subduing them, and showed no desire to <lb/> go further. And it is <lb/> another compliment
      <lb/> to them that the <lb/> British did not take <lb/> the whole of their <lb/> choicest
      lands, but <lb/> left them a <reg orig="considera-|ble">considerable</reg>

      <lb/> protection <lb/> which the New Zealand Government still extends to them. <lb/> And it is
      still another compliment to the Maoris that the <lb/> Government allows native representation
      in both the <reg orig="legisla-|ture">legislature</reg>

     <p>The highest class white men who lived among the Maoris <lb/> in the earliest time had a high

      <pb n="320" entity="DSSR_000002496_0335"/> was another. Dr. Campbell was a close friend of

      magnanimity, and their generosity. Also of their quaint <lb/> notions about the white man's
      queer civilization, and their <lb/> equally quaint comments upon it. One of them thought the

     <p><hi rend="italic">December 8.</hi> A couple of curious war-monuments here at <lb/> Wanganui.
      One is in honor of white men "who fell in <reg orig="de-|fence">defence</reg>
      <lb/> of law and order against fanaticism and barbarism." <lb/> Fanaticism. We Americans are
      English in blood, English in <lb/> speech, English in religion, English in the essentials of
      our <lb/> governmental system, English in the essentials of our <reg orig="civiliza-|tion"
       >civilization</reg>; <lb/> and so, let us hope, for the honor of the blend, for the <lb/>
      honor of the blood, for the honor of the race, that that word <lb/> got there through lack of
      heedfulness, and will not be suffered <lb/> to remain. If you carve it at Thermopylae, or
      where <reg orig="Winkel-|ried">Winkelried</reg>
      <lb/> died, or upon Bunker Hill monument, and read it again&mdash; <lb/> "who fell in
      defence of law and order against fanaticism"&mdash; <lb/> you will perceive what the word
      means, and how mischosen it <lb/> is. Patriotism is Patriotism. Calling it Fanaticism cannot
      <lb/> degrade it; nothing can degrade it. Even though it be a <lb/> political mistake, and a
      thousand times a political mistake, <lb/> that does not affect it; it is
      honorable&mdash;always honorable, <lb/> always noble&mdash;and privileged to hold
      its head up and look <lb/> the nations in the face. It is right to praise these brave white
      <lb/> men who fell in the Maori war&mdash;they deserve it; but the <lb/> presence of that
      word detracts from the dignity of their <lb/> cause and their deeds, and makes them appear to
      have spilt <lb/> their blood in a conflict with ignoble men, men not worthy <lb/>
      <pb n="322" entity="DSSR_000002496_0337"/> of that costly sacrifice. But the men <hi
       rend="italic">were</hi> worthy. It was <lb/> no shame to fight them. They fought for their
      homes, they <lb/> fought for their country; they bravely fought and bravely <lb/> fell; and it
      would take nothing from the honor of the brave <lb/> Englishmen who lie under the monument,
      but <hi rend="italic">add</hi> to it, to say <lb/> that they died in defense of English laws
      and English homes <lb/> against men worthy of the sacrifice&mdash;the Maori patriots.</p>
     <p>The other monument cannot be rectified. Except with <reg orig="dy-|namite">dynamite</reg>.
      <lb/> It is a mistake all through, and a strangely <reg orig="thought-|less">thoughtless</reg>
      <lb/> one. It is a monument erected by white men to Maoris <lb/> who fell fighting with the
      whites and <hi rend="italic">against their own people</hi>, <lb/> in the Maori war. "Sacred to
      the memory of the brave men <lb/> who fell on the 14th of May, 1864," etc. On one side are the
      <lb/> names of about twenty Maoris. It is not a fancy of mine; the <lb/> monument exists. I
      saw it. It is an object-lesson to the rising <lb/> generation. It invites to treachery,
      disloyalty, unpatriotism. <lb/> Its lesson, in frank terms is, "Desert your flag, slay your
      <lb/> people, burn their homes, shame your nationality&mdash;we honor <lb/> such."</p>

      partly in enjoying social <reg orig="privi-|leges">privileges</reg>, <lb/> and largely in
      idling around the magnificent garden at <lb/> Hutt, a little distance away, around the shore.
      I suppose we <lb/> shall not see such another one soon. </p>
     <p>We are packing to-night for the return-voyage to Australia. <lb/> Our stay in New Zealand
      has been too brief; still, we are not <lb/> unthankful for the glimpse which we have had of
      it.</p>
     <p>The sturdy Maoris made the settlement of the country by <lb/> the whites rather difficult.
      Not at first&mdash;but later. At first <lb/> they welcomed the whites, and were eager to
      trade with them <lb/>
      <pb n="323" entity="DSSR_000002496_0338"/> &mdash;particularly for muskets; for their
      pastime was internecine <lb/> war, and they greatly preferred the white man's weapons to their
      <lb/> own. War <hi rend="italic">was</hi> their pastime&mdash;I use the word advisedly.
      They <lb/> often met and slaughtered each other just for a lark, and when <lb/> there was no
      quarrel. The author of "Old New Zealand" <lb/> mentions a case where a victorious army could
      have followed <lb/> up its advantage and exterminated the opposing army, but <lb/> declined to
      do it; explaining na&iuml;vely that "if we did that, <lb/> there couldn't be any more
      fighting." In another battle one <lb/> army sent word that it was out of ammunition, and would
      be <lb/> obliged to stop unless the opposing army would send some. <lb/> It was sent, and the
      fight went on.</p>
     <p>In the early days things went well enough. The natives <lb/> sold land without clearly
      understanding the terms of exchange, <lb/> and the whites bought it without being much
      disturbed about <lb/> the native's confusion of mind. But by and by the Maori <lb/> began to
      comprehend that he was being wronged; then there <lb/> was trouble, for he was not the man to
      swallow a wrong and <lb/> go aside and cry about it. He had the Tasmanian's spirit and <lb/>
      endurance, and a notable share of military science besides; <lb/> and so he rose against the
      oppressor, did this gallant "fanatic," <lb/> and started a war that was not brought to a
      definite end until <lb/> more than a generation had sped.</p>

       <l>Now, William Upson was his name&mdash;</l>
       <l>If it's not that, it's all the same&mdash;</l>
       <l>He did enlist in a cruel strife,</l>

       <l>He was Perry Upson's eldest son,</l>

      <p><hi rend="italic">December 17.</hi> Reached Sydney.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">December 19.</hi> In the train. Fellow of 30 with four valises; <lb/> a
       slim creature, with teeth which made his mouth look like a <lb/> neglected churchyard. He had
       solidified hair&mdash;solidified with <lb/> pomatum; it was all one shell. He smoked the
       most <reg orig="extraor-|dinary">extraordinary</reg>
       <lb/> cigarettes&mdash;made of some kind of manure, apparently. <lb/> These and his hair
       made him smell like the very nation. He <lb/> had a low-cut vest on, which exposed a deal of
       frayed and <lb/> broken and unclean shirt-front. Showy studs, of imitation <lb/>
       gold&mdash;they had made black disks on the linen. Oversized <lb/> sleeve buttons of
       imitation gold, the copper base showing <lb/> through. Ponderous watch-chain of imitation
       gold. I judge <lb/> that he couldn't tell the time by it, for he asked Smythe what <lb/> time
       it was, once. He wore a coat which had been gay when <lb/> it was young;
       5-o'clock-tea-trousers of a light tint, and <reg orig="mar-|velously">marvelously</reg>
       <lb/> soiled; yellow mustache with a dashing upward whirl <lb/> at the ends; foxy shoes,
       imitation patent leather. He was a <lb/> novelty&mdash;an imitation dude. He would have
       been a real one <lb/> if he could have afforded it. But he was satisfied with <reg
        orig="him-|self">himself</reg>. <lb/> You could see it in his expression, and in all his
        <reg orig="atti-|tudes">attitudes</reg>
       <lb/> and movements. He was living in a dude dreamland <lb/> where all his squalid shams were
       genuine, and himself a <reg orig="sin-|cerity">sincerity</reg>. <lb/> It disarmed criticism,
       it mollified spite, to see him so <lb/> enjoy his imitation languors, and arts, and airs, and
       his studied <lb/> daintinesses of gesture and misbegotten refinements. It was <lb/> plain to
       me that he was imagining himself the Prince of Wales, <lb/> and was doing everything the way
       he thought the Prince <lb/> would do it. For bringing his four valises aboard and <reg
        orig="stow-|ing">stowing</reg>
       <lb/> them in the nettings, he gave his porter four cents, and <lb/> lightly apologized for
       the smallness of the gratuity&mdash;just with <lb/> the condescendingest little royal
       air in the world. He <lb/> stretched himself out on the front seat and rested his <reg
        orig="poma-|tum-cake">pomatum-cake</reg>
       <lb/> on the middle arm, and stuck his feet out of the <reg orig="win-|dow">window</reg>, <lb/>
       <pb n="327" entity="DSSR_000002496_0342"/> and began to pose as the Prince and work his
       dreams and <lb/> languors for exhibition; and he would indolently watch the <lb/> blue films
       curling up from his cigarette, and inhale the stench, <lb/> and look so grateful; and would
       flip the ash away with the <lb/> daintiest gesture, unintentionally displaying his brass ring
       in <lb/> the most intentional way; why, it was as good as being in <lb/> Marlborough House
       itself to see him do it so like.</p>
      <figure id="f90" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002496_0342">
       <p>SO LIKE THE PRINCE.</p>

      <p>There was other <lb/> scenery in the trip. <lb/> That of the <reg orig="Hawks-|bury"
        >Hawksbury</reg>
       <lb/> river, in the <reg orig="Na-|tional">National</reg>
       <lb/> Park region, <lb/> fine&mdash;extraordinarily <lb/> fine, with spacious <lb/>
       views of stream and <lb/> lake imposingly <lb/> framed in woody hills; <lb/> and every now
       and <lb/> then the noblest <reg orig="group-|ings">groupings</reg>
       <lb/> of mountains, and <lb/> the most enchanting <lb/> re-arrangements of the <lb/> water
       effects. Further along, green flats, thinly covered with <lb/> gum forests, with here and
       there the huts and cabins of small <lb/> farmers engaged in raising children. Still further
       along, arid <lb/> stretches, lifeless and melancholy. Then Newcastle, a rushing <lb/> town,
       capital of the rich coal regions. Approaching Scone, <lb/> wide farming and grazing levels,
       with pretty frequent glimpses <lb/> of a troublesome plant&mdash;a particularly devilish
       little prickly <lb/> pear, daily damned in the orisons of the agriculturist; imported <lb/>
       by a lady of sentiment, and contributed gratis to the colony. <lb/> . . . Blazing hot, all

      <p>Those are good words for poetry. Among the best I have <lb/> ever seen. There are 81 in the
       list. I did not need them all, <lb/>
       <pb n="330" entity="DSSR_000002496_0345"/> but I have knocked down 66 of them; which is a
       good bag, it <lb/> seems to me, for a person not in the business. Perhaps a poet <lb/>
       laureate could do better, but a poet laureate gets wages, and <lb/> that is different. When I
       write poetry I do not get any wages; <lb/> often I lose money by it. The best word in that
       list, and the <lb/> most musical and gurgly, is Woolloomoolloo. It is a place <lb/> near
       Sydney, and is a favorite pleasure-resort. It has eight <lb/> O's in it.</p>

      <lb/> crew mans this ship&mdash;the first I have seen. White <lb/> cotton petticoat and

      kittens. One of <lb/> these cats goes ashore, in port, in England, Australia, and <lb/> India,
      to see how his various families are getting along, and is <lb/> seen no more till the ship is
      ready to sail. No one knows how <lb/> he finds out the sailing date, but no doubt he comes
      down to <lb/>
      <pb n="332" entity="DSSR_000002496_0347"/> the dock every day and takes a look, and when he
      sees <reg orig="bag-|gage">baggage</reg>
      <lb/> and passengers flocking in, recognizes that it is time to <lb/> get aboard. This is what
      the sailors believe. . . . The <lb/> Chief Engineer has been in the China and India trade <reg
       orig="thirty-|three">thirty-three</reg>
      <lb/> years, and has had but three Christmases at home in that <lb/> time.&hellip;
      Conversational items at dinner, "Mocha! sold <lb/> all over the world! It is not true. In
      fact, very few foreigners <lb/> except the Emperor of Russia have ever seen a grain of it, or
      <lb/> ever will, while they live." Another man said: "There is no <lb/> sale in Australia for
      Australian wine. But it goes to France <lb/> and comes back with a French label on it, and
      then they buy <lb/> it." I have heard that the most of the French-labeled claret <lb/> in New
      York is made in California. And I remember what <lb/> Professor S. told me once about Veuve
      Cliquot&mdash;if that was <lb/> the wine, and I think it was. He was the guest of a great
      wine <lb/> merchant whose town was quite near that vineyard, and this <lb/> merchant asked him
      if very much V. C. was drunk in <lb/> America.</p>

     <p>"Is it easy to be had?"</p>
     <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;easy as water. All first and second-class hotels <lb/> have it."</p>

     <p><hi rend="italic">January 4, 1896</hi>. Christmas in Melbourne, New Year's <lb/> Day in
      Adelaide, and saw most of the friends again in both <lb/> places.&hellip; Lying here at
      anchor all day&mdash;Albany (King <lb/> George's Sound), Western
      Australia. It is a perfectly <reg orig="land-|locked">landlocked</reg>
      <lb/> harbor, or roadstead&mdash;spacious to look at, but not deep <lb/> water.
      Desolate-looking rocks and scarred hills. Plenty of <lb/> ships arriving now, rushing to the
      new gold-fields. The papers <lb/> are full of wonderful tales of the sort always to be heard
      in <lb/> connection with new gold diggings. A sample: a youth staked <lb/> out a claim and
      tried to sell half for &pound;5; no takers; he stuck <lb/> to it fourteen days, starving,
      then struck it rich and sold out <lb/> for &pound;10,000. . . . About sunset, strong
      breeze blowing, <lb/> got up the anchor. We were in a small deep puddle, with a <lb/> narrow
      channel leading out of it, minutely buoyed, to the sea. <lb/>
      <pb n="334" entity="DSSR_000002496_0349"/> I stayed on deck to see how we were going to manage
      it with <lb/> such a big ship and such a strong wind. On the bridge our <lb/> giant captain,
      in uniform; at his side a little pilot in elaborately <lb/> gold-laced uniform; on the
      forecastle a white mate and <reg orig="quar-|termaster">quartermaster</reg>
      <lb/> or two, and a brilliant crowd of lascars standing by <lb/> for business. Our stern was
      pointing straight at the head of <lb/> the channel; so we must turn entirely around in the
      puddle&mdash; <lb/> and the wind blowing as described. It was done, and <reg
       orig="beauti-|fully">beautifully</reg>. <lb/> It was done by help of a jib. We stirred up
      much <lb/> mud, but did not touch the bottom. We turned right around <lb/> in our
      tracks&mdash;a seeming impossibility. We had several casts <lb/> of quarter-less 5, and
      one cast of half 4&mdash;27 feet; we were <lb/> drawing 26 astern. By the time we were
      entirely around and <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">pointed</hi>, the first buoy was not more than a hundred yards in <lb/>
      front of us. It was a fine piece of work, and I was the only <lb/> passenger that saw it.
      However, the others got their dinner; <lb/> the P. &amp; O. Company got mine. . . . More
      cats developed. <lb/> Smythe says it is a British law that they must be carried; and <lb/> he
      instanced a case of a ship not allowed to sail till she sent <lb/> for a couple. The bill
      came, too: "Debtor, to 2 cats, 20 <reg orig="shil-|lings">shillings</reg>." <lb/> . . . News
      comes that within this week Siam has <lb/> acknowledged herself to be, in effect, a French
      province. It <lb/> seems plain that all savage and semi-civilized countries are <lb/> going to
      be grabbed. . . . A vulture on board; bald, red, <lb/> queer-shaped head, featherless red
      places here and there on <lb/> his body, intense great black eyes set in featherless rims of
       <reg orig="in-|flamed">inflamed</reg>
      <lb/> flesh; dissipated look; a business-like style, a selfish, <lb/> conscienceless,
      murderous aspect&mdash;the very look of a <reg orig="profes-|sional">professional</reg>
      <lb/> assassin, and yet a bird which does no murder. What <lb/> was the use of getting him up
      in that tragic style for so <reg orig="inno-|cent">innocent</reg>
      <lb/> a trade as his? For this one isn't the sort that wars upon <lb/> the living, his diet is
      offal&mdash;and the more out of date it is the <lb/> better he likes it. Nature should
      give him a suit of rusty black; <lb/>
      <pb n="335" entity="DSSR_000002496_0350"/> then he would be all right, for he would look like
      an <reg orig="under-|taker">undertaker</reg>
      <lb/> and would harmonize with his business; whereas the way <lb/> he is now he is horribly
      out of true.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">January 5</hi>. At 9 this morning we passed Cape Leeuwin <lb/>
      (lioness) and ceased from our long due-west course along the <lb/> southern
      shore of Australia. Turning this extreme <reg orig="south-|western">southwestern</reg>
      <lb/> corner, we now take a long straight slant nearly <lb/> N. W., without a break, for
      Ceylon. As we speed northward <lb/> it will grow hotter very fast&mdash;but it isn't
      chilly, now. . . . <lb/> The vulture is from the public menagerie at Adelaide&mdash;a
      great <lb/> and interesting collection. It was there that we saw the baby <lb/> tiger solemnly
      spreading its mouth and trying to roar like its <lb/> majestic mother. It swaggered, scowling,
      back and forth on <lb/> its short legs just as it had seen her do on her long ones, and <lb/>
      now and then snarling viciously, exposing its teeth, with a <lb/> threatening lift of its
      upper lip and bristling moustache; and <lb/> when it thought it was impressing the visitors,
      it would spread <lb/> its mouth wide and do that screechy cry which it meant for a <lb/> roar,
      but which did not deceive. It took itself quite seriously, <lb/> and was lovably comical. And
      there was a hyena&mdash;an ugly <lb/> creature; as ugly as the tiger-kitty was pretty. It
      repeatedly <lb/> arched its back and delivered itself of <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a human
      cry; a <lb/> startling resemblance; a cry which was just that of a grown <lb/> person badly
      hurt. In the dark one would assuredly go to its <lb/> assistance&mdash;and be
      disappointed. . . . Many friends of <lb/> Australasian Federation on board. They feel sure
      that the good <lb/> day is not far off, now. But there seems to be a party that <lb/> would go
      further&mdash;have Australasia cut loose from the British <lb/> Empire and set up
      housekeeping on her own hook. It seems <lb/> an unwise idea. They point to the United States,
      but it seems <lb/> to me that the cases lack a good deal of being alike. <reg
       orig="Austra-|lasia">Australasia</reg>
      <lb/> governs herself wholly&mdash;there is no interference; and <lb/> her commerce and
      manufactures are not oppressed in any way. <lb/>

      gone out <lb/> when we did.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">January 13</hi>. Unspeakable hot. The equator is arriving <lb/> again. We
      are within eight degrees of it. Ceylon present. <lb/> Dear me, it is beautiful! And most
      sumptuously tropical, as <lb/> to character of foliage and opulence of it. "What though the
      <lb/> spicy breezes blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle"&mdash;an eloquent line, an <lb/>
      incomparable line; it says little, but conveys whole libraries of <lb/> sentiment, and
      Oriental charm and mystery, and tropic <lb/> deliciousness&mdash;a line that quivers and
      tingles with a thousand <lb/> unexpressed and inexpressible things, things that haunt one
      <lb/> and find no articulate voice. . . . Colombo, the capital. <lb/> An Oriental town, most
      manifestly; and fascinating. . . . <lb/> In this palatial ship the passengers dress for
      dinner. The <lb/> ladies' toilettes make a fine display of color, and this is in <lb/> keeping
      with the elegance of the vessel's furnishings and the <lb/> flooding brilliancies of the
      electric light. On the stormy <lb/> Atlantic one never sees a man in evening dress, except at
      the <lb/> rarest intervals; and then there is only one, not two; and he <lb/> shows up but
      once on the voyage&mdash;the night before the ship <lb/> makes port&mdash;the night
      when they have the "concert" and do <lb/> the amateur wailings and recitations. He is the
      tenor, as a <lb/> rule. . . . There has been a deal of cricket-playing on <lb/> board; it
      seems a queer game for a ship, but they enclose the <lb/> promenade deck with nettings and
      keep the ball from flying <lb/> overboard, and the sport goes very well, and is properly
      violent <lb/> and exciting. . . . We must part from this vessel here.</p>

     <p>We drove to the market, using the Japanese jinriksha&mdash; <lb/> our first
      acquaintanceship with it. It is a light cart, with a <lb/> native to draw it. He makes good
      speed for half-an-hour, but <lb/> it is hard work for him; he is too slight for it. After the
      <lb/> half-hour there is no more pleasure for you; your attention is <lb/> all on the man,
      just as it would be on a tired horse, and <lb/> necessarily your sympathy is there too.
      There's a plenty of <lb/> these 'rickshas, and the tariff is incredibly cheap.</p>
     <p>I was in Cairo years ago. That was Oriental, but there <lb/> was a lack. When you are in
      Florida or New Orleans you are <lb/> in the South&mdash;that is granted; but you are not
      in <hi rend="italic">the</hi> South; <lb/> you are in a modified South, a tempered South.
      Cairo was <lb/> a tempered Orient&mdash;an Orient with an indefinite something <lb/>
      wanting. That feeling was not present in Ceylon. Ceylon <lb/> was Oriental in the last measure
      of completeness&mdash;utterly <lb/> Oriental; also utterly tropical; and indeed to one's
       <reg orig="unreason-|ing">unreasoning</reg>
      <lb/> spiritual sense the two things belong together. All the <lb/> requisites were present.
      The costumes were right; the black <lb/> and brown exposures, unconscious of immodesty, were
      right; <lb/> the juggler was there, with his basket, his snakes, his <reg orig="mon-|goose"
       >mongoose</reg>, <lb/> and his arrangements for growing a tree from seed to <lb/> foliage and
      ripe fruitage before one's eyes; in sight were plants <lb/> and flowers familiar to one on
      books but in no other way&mdash; <lb/> celebrated, desirable, strange, but in production
      restricted to <lb/> the hot belt of the equator; and out a little way in the country <lb/>
      were the proper deadly snakes, and fierce beasts of prey, and <lb/> the wild elephant and the
      monkey. And there was that swoon <lb/> in the air which one associates with the tropics, and
      that <lb/> smother of heat, heavy with odors of unknown flowers, and <lb/> that sudden
      invasion of purple gloom fissured with lightnings, <lb/> &mdash;then the tumult of
      crashing thunder and the downpour&mdash; <lb/>
      <pb n="340" entity="DSSR_000002496_0355"/> and presently all sunny and smiling again; all
      these things <lb/> were there; the conditions were complete, nothing was <reg orig="lack-|ing"
       >lacking</reg>. <lb/> And away off in the deeps of the jungle and in the <reg
       orig="re-|motenesses">remotenesses</reg>
      <lb/> of the mountains were the ruined cities and <lb/> mouldering temples, mysterious relics
      of the pomps of a <reg orig="for-|gotten">forgotten</reg>
      <lb/> time and a vanished race&mdash;and this was as it should be, <lb/> also, for
      nothing is quite satisfyingly Oriental that lacks the <lb/> somber and impressive qualities of
      mystery and antiquity.</p>
     <p>The drive through the town and out to the Gall&egrave; Face by <lb/> the seashore, what
      a dream it was of tropical splendors of <lb/> bloom and blossom, and Oriental conflagrations
      of costume! <lb/> The walking groups of men, women, boys, girls, babies&mdash;each <lb/>
      individual was a flame, each group a house afire for color. <lb/> And such stunning colors,
      such intensely vivid colors, such rich <lb/> and exquisite minglings and fusings of rainbows
      and <reg orig="light-|nings">lightnings</reg>! <lb/> And all harmonious, all in perfect taste;
      never a <reg orig="dis-|cordant">discordant</reg>
      <lb/> note; never a color on any person swearing at another <lb/> color on him or failing to
      harmonize faultlessly with the colors <lb/> of any group the wearer might join. The stuffs
      were silk&mdash; <lb/> thin, soft, delicate, clinging; and, as a rule, each piece a solid
      <lb/> color: a splendid green, a splendid blue, a splendid yellow, a <lb/> splendid purple, a
      splendid ruby, deep, and rich with <reg orig="smoulder-|ing">smouldering</reg>
      <lb/> fires&mdash;they swept continuously by in crowds and legions <lb/> and multitudes,
      glowing, flashing, burning, radiant; and every <lb/> five seconds came a burst of blinding red
      that made a body <lb/> catch his breath, and filled his heart with joy. And then, the <lb/>
      unimaginable grace of those costumes! Sometimes a woman's <lb/> whole dress was but a scarf
      wound about her person and her <lb/> head, sometimes a man's was but a turban and a careless
      rag <lb/> or two&mdash;in both cases generous areas of polished dark skin <lb/>
      showing&mdash;but always the arrangement compelled the homage <lb/> of the eye and made
      the heart sing for gladness.</p>
     <p>I can see it to this day, that radiant panorama, that <reg orig="wilder-|ness">wilderness</reg>

      <lb/> harmonious tints, and lithe half-covered forms, and beautiful <lb/> brown faces, and
      gracious and graceful gestures and attitudes <lb/> and movements, free, unstudied, barren of
      stiffness and <lb/> restraint, and&mdash;</p>
     <p>Just then, into this dream of fairyland and paradise a <reg orig="grat-|ing">grating</reg>
      <lb/> dissonance was injected. Out of a missionary school came <lb/> marching, two and two,
      sixteen prim and pious little Christian <lb/> black girls, Europeanly
      clothed&mdash;dressed, to the last detail, as <lb/> they would have been dressed on a
      summer Sunday in an <lb/> English or American village. Those clothes&mdash;oh, they were
      <lb/> unspeakably ugly! Ugly, barbarous, destitute of taste, <reg orig="desti-|tute">destitute</reg>
      <lb/> of grace, repulsive as a shroud. I looked at my <reg orig="women-|folk's">womenfolk's</reg>
      <lb/> clothes&mdash;just full-grown duplicates of the outrages <lb/> disguising those
      poor little abused creatures&mdash;and was <lb/> ashamed to be seen in the street with
      them. Then I looked at <lb/> my own clothes, and was ashamed to be seen in the street <lb/>
      with myself.</p>
     <p>However, we must put up with our clothes as they are&mdash; <lb/> they have their
      reason for existing. They are on us to expose <lb/> us&mdash;to advertise what we wear
      them to conceal. They are a <lb/> sign; a sign of insincerity; a sign of suppressed vanity; a
      <lb/> pretense that we despise gorgeous colors and the graces of <lb/> harmony and form; and
      we put them on to propagate that lie <lb/> and back it up. But we do not deceive our neighbor;
      and <lb/> when we step into Ceylon we realize that we have not even <lb/> deceived ourselves.
      We do love brilliant colors and graceful <lb/> costumes; and at home we will turn out in a
      storm to see <lb/> them when the procession goes by&mdash;and envy the wearers. <lb/> We
      go to the theater to look at them and grieve that we can't <lb/> be clothed like that. We go
      to the King's ball, when we get a <lb/> chance, and are glad of a sight of the splendid
      uniforms and <lb/> the glittering orders. When we are granted permission to <lb/>
      <pb n="344" entity="DSSR_000002496_0359"/> attend an imperial drawing-room we shut ourselves
      up in <lb/> private and parade around in the theatrical court-dress by the <lb/> hour, and
      admire ourselves in the glass, and are utterly happy; <lb/> and every member of every
      governor's staff in democratic <lb/> America does the same with his grand new
      uniform&mdash;and if <lb/> he is not watched he will get himself photographed in it, too.
      <lb/> When I see the Lord Mayor's footman I am dissatisfied with <lb/> my lot. Yes, our
      clothes are a lie, and have been nothing <lb/> short of that these hundred years. They are
      insincere, they <lb/> are the ugly and appropriate outward exposure of an inward <lb/> sham
      and a moral decay.</p>
     <p>The last little brown boy I chanced to notice in the crowds <lb/> and swarms of Colombo had
      nothing on but a twine string <lb/> around his waist, but in my memory the frank honesty of
      his <lb/> costume still stands out in pleasant contrast with the odious <lb/> flummery in
      which the little Sunday-school dowdies were <lb/> masquerading.</p>

      <lb/> Presidency, lives. Parsee palaces all along the first part <lb/> of the drive; and past
      them all the world is driving; the <lb/> private carriages of wealthy Englishmen and natives
      of rank <lb/> are manned by a driver and three footmen in stunning oriental <lb/>
      liveries&mdash;two of these turbaned statues standing up behind, as <lb/> fine as
      monuments. Sometimes even the public carriages <lb/> have this superabundant crew, slightly
      modified&mdash;one to <lb/> drive, one to sit by and see it done, and one to stand up
      <lb/> behind and yell&mdash;yell when there is anybody in the way, and <lb/> for practice
      when there isn't. It all helps to keep up the <reg orig="live-|liness">liveliness</reg>
      <lb/> and augment the general sense of swiftness and energy <lb/> and confusion and pow-wow.</p>
     <p>In the region of Scandal Point&mdash;felicitous name&mdash;where <lb/> there are
      handy rocks to sit on and a noble view of the sea on <lb/> the one hand, and on the other the
      passing and repassing <lb/> whirl and tumult of gay carriages, are great groups of <reg
       orig="comfort-|ably-off">comfortably-off</reg>
      <lb/> Parsee women&mdash;perfect flower-beds of brilliant color, <lb/> a fascinating
      spectacle. Tramp, tramp, tramping along the <lb/> road, in singles, couples, groups, and
      gangs, you have the <lb/> working-man and the working-woman&mdash;but not clothed like
      <lb/> ours. Usually the man is a nobly-built great athlete, with not <lb/> a rag on but his
      loin-handkerchief; his color a deep dark <lb/> brown, his skin satin, his rounded muscles
      knobbing it as if it <lb/> had eggs under it. Usually the woman is a slender and <lb/> shapely
      creature, as erect as a lightning-rod, and she has but <lb/> one thing on&mdash;a
      bright-colored piece of stuff which is wound <lb/> about her head and her body down nearly
      half-way to her <lb/> knees, and which clings like her own skin. Her legs and feet <lb/>
      <pb n="347" entity="DSSR_000002496_0362"/> are bare, and so are her arms, except for her
      fanciful bunches <lb/> of loose silver rings on her ankles and on her arms. She has <lb/>
      jewelry bunched on the side of her nose also, and showy <lb/> cluster-rings on her toes. When
      she undresses for bed she <lb/> takes off her jewelry, I suppose. If she took off anything
      <lb/> more she would catch cold. As a rule she has a large shiney <lb/> brass water-jar of
      graceful <lb/> shape on her head, and <lb/> one of her naked arms <lb/> curves up and the hand
      <lb/> holds it there. She is so <lb/> straight, so erect, and she <lb/> steps with such style,
      and <lb/> such easy grace and <reg orig="dig-|nity">dignity</reg>; <lb/> and her curved arm
      <lb/> and her brazen jar are <lb/> such a help to the picture <lb/> &mdash;indeed, our
       <reg orig="working-|women">workingwomen</reg>
      <lb/> cannot begin with <lb/> her as a road-decoration.</p>

      poverty, of splendor and rags, <lb/> of palaces and hovels, of famine and pestilence, of genii
      and <lb/>
      <pb n="348" entity="DSSR_000002496_0363"/> giants and Aladdin lamps, of tigers and elephants,

      of a thousand religions and two million gods, <lb/> cradle of the human race, birthplace of
      human speech, mother <lb/> of history, grandmother of legend, great-grandmother of <lb/>
      tradition, whose yesterdays bear date with the mouldering <lb/> antiquities of the rest of the
      nations&mdash;the one sole country <lb/> under the sun that is endowed with an
      imperishable interest <lb/> for alien prince and alien peasant, for lettered and ignorant,
      <lb/> wise and fool, rich and poor, bond and free, the one land that <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">all</hi> men desire to see, and having seen once, by even a glimpse, <lb/>
      would not give that glimpse for the shows of all the rest of <lb/> the globe combined.</p>
     <p>Even now, after the lapse of a year, the delirium of those <lb/> days in Bombay has not left
      me, and I hope never will. It <lb/> was all new, no detail of it hackneyed. And India did not
      <lb/> wait for morning, it began at the hotel&mdash;straight away. The <lb/> lobbies and
      halls were full of turbaned, and fez'd and <reg orig="em-|broidered">embroidered</reg>, <lb/>
      cap'd, and barefooted, and cotton-clad dark natives, <lb/> some of them rushing about, others
      at rest squatting, or <lb/> sitting on the ground; some of them chattering with energy, <lb/>
      others still and dreamy; in the dining-room every man's own <lb/> private native servant
      standing behind his chair, and dressed <lb/> for a part in the Arabian Nights.</p>
     <p>Our rooms were high up, on the front. A white man&mdash; <lb/> he was a burly
      German&mdash;went up with us, and brought three <lb/> natives along to see to arranging
      things. About fourteen others <lb/> followed in procession, with the hand-baggage; each
      carried <lb/> an article&mdash;and only one; a bag, in some cases, in other cases <lb/>
      less. One strong native carried my overcoat, another a parasol, <lb/> another a box of cigars,
      another a novel, and the last man in <lb/> the procession had no load but a fan. It was all
      done with <lb/> earnestness and sincerity, there was not a smile in the <reg
       orig="pro-|cession">procession</reg>
      <lb/>
      <pb entity="DSSR_000002496_0364"/>

      <pb n="351" entity="DSSR_000002496_0366"/> from the head of it to the tail of it. Each man
      waited <lb/> patiently, tranquilly, in no sort of hurry, till one of us found <lb/> time to
      give him a copper, then he bent his head reverently, <lb/> touched his forehead with his
      fingers, and went his way. They <lb/> seemed a soft and gentle race, and there was something
      both <lb/> winning and touching about their demeanor.</p>
     <p>There was a vast glazed door which opened upon the <lb/> balcony. It needed closing, or
      cleaning, or something, and a <lb/> native got down on his knees and went to work at it. He
      <lb/> seemed to be doing it well enough, but perhaps he wasn't, for <lb/> the burly German put
      on a look that betrayed dissatisfaction, <lb/> then without <hi rend="italic">explaining</hi>
      what was wrong, gave the native a <lb/> brisk cuff on the jaw and <hi rend="italic">then</hi>
      told him where the defect was. <lb/> It seemed such a shame to do that before us all. The
      native <lb/> took it with meekness, saying nothing, and not showing in his <lb/> face or
      manner any resentment. I had not seen the like of <lb/> this for fifty years. It carried me
      back to my boyhood, and <lb/> flashed upon me the forgotten fact that this was the <hi
       rend="italic">usual</hi>
      <lb/> way of explaining one's desires to a slave. I was able to <reg orig="re-|member"
       >remember</reg>
      <lb/> that the method seemed right and natural to me in <lb/> those days, I being born to it
      and unaware that elsewhere <unclear id="u2">e </unclear>
      <lb/> were other methods; but I was also able to remember that <lb/> those unresented cuffings
      made me sorry for the victim and <lb/> ashamed for the punisher. My father was a refined and
      kindly <lb/> gentleman, very grave, rather austere, of rigid probity, a <lb/> sternly just and
      upright man, albeit he attended no church and <lb/> never spoke of religious matters, and had
      no part nor lot in <lb/> the pious joys of his Presbyterian family, nor ever seemed to <lb/>
      suffer from this deprivation. He laid his hand upon me in <lb/> punishment only twice in his
      life, and then not heavily; once <lb/> for telling him a lie&mdash;which surprised me,
      and showed me <lb/> how unsuspicious he was, for that was not my maiden effort. <lb/> He
      punished me those two times only, and never any other <lb/>
      <pb n="352" entity="DSSR_000002496_0367"/> member of the family at all; yet every now and then
      he cuffed <lb/> our harmless slave boy, Lewis, for trifling little blunders and <lb/>
      awkardnesses. My father had passed his life among the slaves <lb/> from his cradle up, and his
      cuffings proceeded from the custom <lb/> of the time, not from his nature. When I was ten
      years old <lb/> I saw a man fling a lump of iron-ore at a slave-man in anger, <lb/> for merely
      doing something awkwardly&mdash;as if that were a <lb/> crime. It bounded from the man's
      skull, and the man fell and <lb/> never spoke again. He was dead in an hour. I knew the man
      <lb/> had a right to kill his slave if he wanted to, and yet it seemed <lb/> a pitiful thing
      and somehow wrong, though why wrong I was <lb/> not deep enough to explain if I had been asked
      to do it. <lb/> Nobody in the village approved of that murder, but of course <lb/> no one said
      much about it.</p>
     <p>It is curious&mdash;the space-annihilating power of thought. <lb/> For just one second,
      all that goes to make the <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in me was <lb/> in a Missourian village,
      on the other side of the globe, vividly <lb/> seeing again these forgotten pictures of fifty
      years ago, and <lb/> wholly unconscious of all things but just those; and in the next <lb/>
      second I was back in Bombay, and that kneeling native's <lb/> smitten cheek was not done
      tingling yet! Back to boyhood <lb/> &mdash;fifty years; back to age again, another fifty;
      and a flight <lb/> equal to the circumference of the globe&mdash;all in two seconds <lb/>
      by the watch!</p>
     <p>Some natives&mdash;I don't remember how many&mdash;went into <lb/> my bedroom,
      now, and put things to rights and arranged the <lb/> mosquito-bar, and I went to bed to nurse
      my cough. It was <lb/> about nine in the evening. What a state of things! For three <lb/>
      hours the yelling and shouting of natives in the hall continued, <lb/> along with the velvety
      patter of their swift bare feet&mdash;what a <lb/> racket it was! They were yelling
      orders and messages down <lb/> three flights. Why, in the matter of noise it amounted to a
      <lb/> riot, an insurrection, a revolution. And then there were other <lb/>
      <pb n="353" entity="DSSR_000002496_0368"/> noises mixed up with these and at intervals
      tremendously <lb/> accenting them&mdash;roofs falling in, I judged, windows <reg
       orig="smash-|ing">smashing</reg>, <lb/> persons being murdered, crows squawking, and
      deriding, <lb/> and cursing, canaries screeching, monkeys jabbering, macaws <lb/> blaspheming,
      and every now and then fiendish bursts of <reg orig="laugh-|ter">laughter</reg>
      <lb/> and explosions of dynamite. By midnight I had suffered <lb/> all the different kinds of
      shocks there are, and knew that I <lb/> could never more be disturbed by them, either isolated
      or in <lb/> combination. Then came peace&mdash;stillness deep and solemn&mdash;
      <lb/> and lasted till five.</p>
     <p>Then it all broke loose again. And who re-started it? <lb/> The Bird of Birds&mdash;the
      Indian crow. I came to know him <lb/> well, by and by, and be infatuated with him. I suppose
      he is <lb/> the hardest lot that wears feathers. Yes, and the cheerfulest, <lb/> and the best
      satisfied with himself. He never arrived at what <lb/> he is by any careless process, or any
      sudden one; he is a work <lb/> of art, and "art is long"; he is the product of immemorial
      <lb/> ages, and of deep calculation; one can't make a bird like that <lb/> in a day. He has
      been re-incarnated more times than Shiva; <lb/> and he has kept a sample of each incarnation,
      and fused it into <lb/> his constitution. In the course of his evolutionary promotions, <lb/>
      his sublime march toward ultimate perfection, he has been a <lb/> gambler, a low comedian, a
      dissolute priest, a fussy woman, a <lb/> blackguard, a scoffer, a liar, a thief, a spy, an
      informer, a <reg orig="trad-|ing">trading</reg>
      <lb/> politician, a swindler, a professional hypocrite, a patriot <lb/> for cash, a reformer,
      a lecturer, a lawyer, a conspirator, a rebel, <lb/> a royalist, a democrat, a practicer and
      propagator of <reg orig="irrever-|ence">irreverence</reg>, <lb/> a meddler, an intruder, a
      busybody, an infidel, and a <lb/> wallower in sin for the mere love of it. The strange result,
      <lb/> the incredible result, of this patient accumulation of all <reg orig="dam-|nable"
       >damnable</reg>
      <lb/> traits is, that he does not know what care is, he does not <lb/> know what sorrow is, he
      does not know what remorse is, his life <lb/> is one long thundering ecstasy of happiness, and
      he will go to his <lb/>
      <pb n="354" entity="DSSR_000002496_0369"/> death untroubled, knowing that he will soon turn up
      again as <lb/> an author or something, and be even more intolerably capable <lb/> and
      comfortable than ever he was before.</p>
     <p>In his straddling wide forward-step, and his springy <reg orig="side-|wise">sidewise</reg>
      <lb/> series of hops, and his impudent air, and his cunning way <lb/> of canting his head to
      one side upon occasion, he reminds one <lb/> of the American blackbird. But the sharp
      resemblances stop <lb/> there. He is much bigger than the blackbird; and he lacks <lb/> the
      blackbird's trim and slender and beautiful build and <lb/> shapely beak; and of course his
      sober garb of gray and rusty <lb/> black is a poor and humble thing compared with the splendid
      <lb/> lustre of the blackbird's metallic sables and shifting and <reg orig="flash-|ing"
       >flashing</reg>
      <lb/> bronze glories. The blackbird is a perfect gentleman, in <lb/> deportment and attire,
      and is not noisy, I believe, except when <lb/> holding religious services and political
      conventions in a tree; <lb/> but this Indian sham Quaker is just a rowdy, and is always <lb/>
      noisy when awake&mdash;always chaffing, scolding, scoffing, <reg orig="laugh-|ing"
       >laughing</reg>, <lb/> ripping, and cursing, and carrying on about something <lb/> or other.
      I never saw such a bird for delivering opinions. <lb/> Nothing escapes him; he notices
      everything that happens, and <lb/> brings out his opinion about it, particularly if it is a
      matter <lb/> that is none of his business. And it is never a mild opinion, <lb/> but always
      violent&mdash;violent and profane&mdash;the presence of <lb/> ladies does not affect
      him. His opinions are not the outcome <lb/> of reflection, for he never thinks about anything,
      but heaves <lb/> out the opinion that is on top in his mind, and which is often <lb/> an
      opinion about some quite different thing and does not fit <lb/> the case. But that is his way;
      his main idea is to get out an <lb/> opinion, and if he stopped to think he would lose
      chances.</p>
     <p>I suppose he has no enemies among men. The whites and <lb/> Mohammedans never seemed to
      molest him; and the Hindoos, <lb/> because of their religion, never take the life of any
      creature, <lb/> but spare even the snakes and tigers and fleas and rats. If I <lb/>
      <pb n="355" entity="DSSR_000002496_0370"/> sat on one end of the balcony, the crows would
      gather on the <lb/> railing at the other end and talk about me; and edge closer, <lb/> little
      by little, till I could almost reach them; and they would <lb/> sit there, in the most
      unabashed way, and talk about my <lb/> clothes, and my hair, and my complexion, <lb/> and
      probable character and vocation and <lb/> politics, and how I came to be in India, <lb/> and
      what I had been doing, and <lb/> how many <lb/> days I had got for it, and how I had happened
      to go unhanged <lb/> so long, and when would it probably come off, and might <lb/>

      when would <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">they</hi> be hanged,&mdash;and so on, and so on, until I could not
      <lb/> longer endure the embarrassment of it; then I would shoo <lb/> them away, and they would
      circle around in the air a little <lb/> while, laughing and deriding and mocking, and
      presently <lb/> settle on the rail and do it all over again.</p>
     <p>They were very sociable when there was anything to eat&mdash; <lb/> oppressively so.
      With a little encouragement they would come <lb/> in and light on the table and help me eat my
      breakfast; and <lb/> once when I was in the other room and they found themselves <lb/> alone,
      they carried off everything they could lift; and they <lb/> were particular to choose things
      which they could make no use <lb/> of after they got them. In India their number is beyond
       <reg orig="esti-|mate">estimate</reg>, <lb/> and their noise is in proportion. I suppose they
      cost the <lb/> country more than the government does; yet that is not a <lb/> light matter.
      Still, they pay; their company pays; it would <lb/> sadden the land to take their cheerful
      voice out of it.</p>

       >Indeed</reg>, <lb/> it is a country that runs richly to name. The great god <lb/> Vishnu has
      108&mdash;108 special ones&mdash;108 peculiarly holy ones <lb/> &mdash;names
      just for Sunday use only. I learned the whole of <lb/> Vishnu's 108 by heart once, but they
      wouldn't stay; I don't <lb/> remember any of them now but John W.</p>
     <p>And the romances connected with those princely native <lb/> houses&mdash;to this day
      they are always turning up, just as in the <lb/> old, old times. They were sweating out a
      romance in an <reg orig="En-|glish">English</reg>
      <lb/> court in Bombay a while before we were there. In <reg orig="this-|case">this-case</reg>
      <lb/> a native prince, 16&frac12; years old, who has been enjoying his <lb/> titles and
      dignities and estates unmolested for fourteen years, <lb/> is suddenly haled into court on the
      charge that he is rightfully <lb/> no prince at all, but a pauper peasant; that the real
      prince <lb/>
      <pb n="358" entity="DSSR_000002496_0373"/> died when two and one-half years old; that the
      death was <reg orig="con-|cealed">concealed</reg>, <lb/> and a peasant child smuggled into the
      royal cradle, and <lb/> that this present incumbent was that smuggled substitute. This <lb/>
      is the very material that so many oriental tales have been made of.</p>
     <p>The case of that great prince, the Gaikwar of Baroda, is a <lb/> reversal of the theme. When
      that throne fell vacant, no heir <lb/> could be found for some time, but at last one was found
      in the <lb/> person of a peasant child who was making mud pies in a village <lb/> street, and
      having an innocent good time. But his pedigree <lb/> was straight; he was the true prince, and
      he has reigned ever <lb/> since, with none to dispute his right.</p>
     <p>Lately there was another hunt for an heir to another <lb/> princely house, and one was found
      who was circumstanced <lb/> about as the Gaikwar had been. His fathers were traced back, <lb/>
      in humble life, along a branch of the ancestral tree to the point <lb/> where it joined the
      stem fourteen generations ago, and his <lb/> heirship was thereby squarely established. The
      tracing was <lb/> done by means of the records of one of the great Hindoo <lb/> shrines, where
      princes on pilgrimage record their names and <lb/> the date of their visit. This is to keep
      the prince's religious <lb/> account straight, and his spiritual person safe; but the record
      <lb/> has the added value of keeping the pedigree authentic, too.</p>
     <p>When I think of Bombay now, at this distance of time, I <lb/> seem to have a kaleidoscope at
      my eye; and I hear the clash of <lb/> the glass bits as the splendid figures change, and fall
      apart, <lb/> and flash into new forms, figure after figure, and with the <lb/> birth of each
      new form I feel my skin crinkle and my <reg orig="nerve-|web">nerve-web</reg>
      <lb/> tingle with a new thrill of wonder and delight. These <lb/> remembered pictures float
      past me in a sequence of contracts; <lb/> following the same order always, and always whirling
      by and <lb/> disappearing with the swiftness of a dream, leaving me with <lb/> the sense that
      the actuality was the experience of an hour, at <lb/> most, whereas it really covered days, I
      think.</p>

      as he is in your employ he will be about as <lb/> near to you as your clothes.</p>
     <p>In India your day may be said to begin with the "bearer's" <lb/> knock on the bedroom door,
      accompanied by a formula of <lb/> words&mdash;a formula which is intended to mean that
      the bath is <lb/> ready. It doesn't really seem to mean anything at all. But <lb/> that is
      because you are not used to "bearer" English. You <lb/> will presently understand.</p>
     <p>Where he gets his English is his own secret. There is <lb/> nothing like it elsewhere in the
      earth; or even in paradise, <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg>, <lb/> but the other place is
      probably full of it. You hire him <lb/> as soon as you touch Indian soil; for no matter what
      your sex <lb/> is, you cannot do without him. He is messenger, valet, <reg
       orig="cham-|bermaid">chambermaid</reg>, <lb/> table-waiter, lady's maid,
      courier&mdash;he is everything. <lb/> He carries a coarse linen clothes-bag and a quilt;
      he sleeps on <lb/> the stone floor outside your chamber door, and gets his meals <lb/> you do
      not know where nor when; you only know that he is <lb/> not fed on the premises, either when
      you are in a hotel or <lb/> when you are a guest in a private house. His wages are large <lb/>
      &mdash;from an Indian point of view&mdash;and he feeds and clothes <lb/> himself out
      of them. We had three of him in two and a half <lb/> months. The first one's rate was thirty
      rupees a month&mdash; <lb/> that is to say, twenty-seven cents a day; the rate of the
      others, <lb/> Rs. 40 (40 rupees) a month. A princely sum; for the native
      <lb/> switchman on a railway and the native servant in a private <lb/> family get only Rs. 7
      per month, and the farm-hand only 4. <lb/> The two former feed and clothe themselves and their
      families <lb/> on their $1.90 per month; but I cannot believe that the <reg orig="farm-|hand"
       >farmhand</reg>
      <lb/> has to feed himself on his $1.08. I think the farm <reg orig="prob-|ably">probably</reg>
      <lb/> feeds him, and that the whole of his wages, except a trifle <lb/> for the priest, go to
      the support of his family. That is, to the <lb/>
      <pb n="360" entity="DSSR_000002496_0375"/> feeding of his family; for they live in a mud hut,
      hand-made, <lb/> and, doubtless, rent-free, and they wear no clothes; at least, <lb/> nothing
      more than a rag. And not much of a rag at that, in <lb/> the case of the males. However, these
      are handsome times for <lb/> the farm-hand; he was not always the child of luxury that he
      <lb/> is now. The Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces, in <lb/> a recent official
      utterance wherein he was rebuking a native <lb/> deputation for complaining of hard times,
      reminded them that <lb/> they could easily remember when a farm-hand's wages were <lb/> only
      half a rupee (former value) a month&mdash;that is to say, less <lb/>
      than a cent a day; nearly $2.90 a year. If such a wage-earner <lb/> had a good deal of a
      family&mdash;and they all have that, for God <lb/> is very good to these poor natives in
      some ways&mdash;he would <lb/> save a profit of fifteen cents, clean and clear, out of
      his year's <lb/> toil; I mean a frugal, thrifty person would, not one given to <lb/> display
      and ostentation. And if he owed $13.50 and took good <lb/> care of his health, he could pay it
      off in ninety years. Then <lb/> he could hold up his head, and look his creditors in the face
      <lb/> again.</p>
     <p>Think of these facts and what they mean. India does not <lb/> consist of cities. There are
      no cities in India&mdash;to speak of. <lb/> Its stupendous population consists of
      farm-laborers. India is <lb/> one vast farm&mdash;one almost interminable stretch of
      fields with <lb/> mud fences between. Think of the above facts; and consider <lb/> what an
      incredible aggregate of poverty they place before you.</p>
     <p>The first Bearer that applied, waited below and sent up his <lb/> recommendations. That was
      the first morning in Bombay. <lb/> We read them over; carefully, cautiously, thoughtfully.
      There <lb/> was not a fault to find with them&mdash;except one; they were all <lb/> from
      Americans. Is that a slur? If it is, it is a deserved one. <lb/> In my experience, an
      American's recommendation of a servant <lb/> is not usually valuable. We are too good-natured
      a race; we <lb/> hate to say the unpleasant thing; we shrink from speaking the <lb/>
      <pb n="361" entity="DSSR_000002496_0376"/> unkind truth about a poor fellow whose bread
      depends upon <lb/> our verdict; so we speak of his good points only, thus not <lb/> scrupling
      to tell a lie&mdash;a <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> lie&mdash;for in not mentioning
      <lb/> his bad ones we as good as say he hasn't any. The only <reg orig="dif-|ference"
       >difference</reg>
      <lb/> that I know of between a silent lie and a spoken one <lb/> is, that the silent lie is a
      less respectable one than the other. <lb/> And it can deceive, whereas the other
      can't&mdash;as a rule. We <lb/> not only tell the silent lie as to a servant's faults,
      but we sin in <lb/> another way: we overpraise his merits; for when it comes to <lb/> writing
      recommendations of servants we are a nation of <reg orig="gush-|ers">gushers</reg>. <lb/> And
      we have not the Frenchman's excuse. In France <lb/> you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> give the
      departing servant a good recommendation; <lb/> and you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> conceal his
      faults; you have no choice. If you <lb/> mention his faults for the protection of the next
      candidate for <lb/> his services, he can sue you for damages; and the court will <lb/> award
      them, too; and, moreover, the judge will give you a <lb/> sharp dressing-down from the bench
      for trying to destroy a <lb/> poor man's character, and rob him of his bread. I do not <lb/>
      state this on my own authority, I got it from a French <reg orig="physi-|cian">physician</reg>
      <lb/> of fame and repute&mdash;a man who was born in Paris, and <lb/> had practiced there
      all his life. And he said that he spoke not <lb/> merely from common knowledge, but from
      exasperating <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg>
      <lb/> experience.</p>
     <p>As I was saying, the Bearer's recommendations were all <lb/> from American tourists; and St.
      Peter would have admitted <lb/> him to the fields of the blest on them&mdash;I mean if he
      is as <lb/> unfamiliar with our people and our ways as I suppose he is. <lb/> According to
      these recommendations, Manuel X. was supreme <lb/> in all the arts connected with his complex
      trade; and these <lb/> manifold arts were mentioned&mdash;and praised&mdash;in
      detail. His <lb/> English was spoken of in terms of warm <reg
       orig="admiration&mdash;admira-|tion">admiration&mdash;admiration</reg>
      <lb/> verging upon rapture. I took pleased note of that, and <lb/> hoped that some of it might
      be true.</p>
     <pb n="362" entity="DSSR_000002496_0377"/>
     <p>We had to have some one right away; so the family went <lb/> down stairs and took him a week
      on trial; then sent him up <lb/> to me and departed on their affairs. I was shut up in my
      <lb/> quarters with a bronchial cough, and glad to have something <lb/> fresh to look at,
      something new to play with. Manuel filled <lb/> the bill; Manuel was very welcome. He was
      toward fifty <lb/> years old, tall, slender, with a slight stoop&mdash;an artificial
      stoop, <lb/> a deferential stoop, a stoop <reg orig="rigidi-|fied">rigidified</reg>
      <lb/> by long habit&mdash;with face of <lb/> European mould; short hair <reg
       orig="in-|tensely">intensely</reg>
      <lb/> black; gentle black eyes, <lb/> timid black eyes, indeed; <reg orig="com-|plexion"
       >complexion</reg>
      <lb/> very dark, nearly black <lb/> in fact; face smooth-shaven. He <lb/> was bareheaded and
      barefooted, <lb/> and was never otherwise while his <lb/> week with us lasted; his clothing
      <lb/> was European, cheap, flimsy, and <lb/> showed much wear.</p>
     <figure id="f100" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002496_0377">
      <p>MANUEL.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>He stood before me and inclined <lb/> his head (and body) in the pathetic
      <lb/> Indian way, touching his forehead <lb/> with the finger-ends of his right <lb/> hand, in
      salute. I said:&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Manuel, you are evidently Indian, but you seem to have a <lb/> Spanish name when you put it
      all together. How is that?" </p>
     <p>A perplexed look gathered in his face; it was plain that he <lb/> had not
      understood&mdash;but he didn't let on. He spoke back <lb/> placidly.</p>
     <p>"Name, Manuel. Yes, master."</p>
     <p>"I know; but how did you <hi rend="italic">get</hi> the name?"</p>
     <p>"Oh, yes, I suppose. Think happen so. Father same <lb/> name, not mother."</p>
     <pb n="363" entity="DSSR_000002496_0378"/>
     <p>I saw that I must simplify my language and spread my <lb/> words apart, if I would be
      understood by this English scholar.</p>
     <p>"Well&mdash;then&mdash;how&mdash;did&mdash;your&mdash;father&mdash;get&mdash;his&mdash;
      <lb/> name?"</p>
     <p>"Oh, he,"&mdash;brightening a little&mdash;"he <reg
       orig="Christian&mdash;Porty-|gee">Christian&mdash;Portygee</reg>; <lb/> live in
      Goa; I born Goa; mother not Portygee, mother <lb/> native&mdash;high-caste

      Brahmin, too. Christian, <lb/> too, same like father; high-caste Christian Brahmin,
      master&mdash; <lb/> Salvation Army."</p>
     <p>All this haltingly, and with difficulty. Then he had an <lb/> inspiration, and began to pour
      out a flood of words that I could <lb/> make nothing of; so I said:&mdash;</p>
     <p>"There&mdash;don't do that. I can't understand Hindostani."</p>
     <p>"Not Hindostani, master&mdash;English. Always I speaking <lb/> English sometimes when I
      talking every day all the time at you."</p>
     <p>"Very well, stick to that; that is intelligible. It is not <lb/> up to my hopes, it is not
      up to the promise of the <reg orig="recommenda-|tions">recommendations</reg>, <lb/> still it
      is English, and I understand it. Don't elaborate <lb/> it; I don't like elaborations when they
      are crippled by <reg orig="uncer-|tainty">uncertainty</reg>
      <lb/> of touch."</p>
     <p>"Master?"</p>
     <p>"Oh, never mind; it was only a random thought; I didn't <lb/> expect you to understand it.
      How did you get your English; <lb/> is it an acquirement, or just a gift of God?"</p>
     <p>After some hesitation&mdash;piously:</p>
     <p>"Yes, he very good. Christian god very good, Hindoo <lb/> god very good, too. Two million
      Hindoo god, one Christian <lb/> god&mdash;make two million and one. All mine; two million
      and <lb/> one god. I got a plenty. Sometime I pray all time at those, <lb/> keep it up, go all
      time every day; give something at shrine, all <lb/> good for me, make me better man; good for
      me, good for my <lb/> family, dam good."</p>
     <pb n="364" entity="DSSR_000002496_0379"/>
     <p>Then he had another inspiration, and went rambling off <lb/> into fervent confusions and
      incoherencies, and I had to stop <lb/> him again. I thought we had talked enough, so I told
      him to <lb/> go to the bathroom and clean it up and remove the slops&mdash;this <lb/> to
      get rid of him. He went away, seeming to understand, and <lb/> got out some of my clothes and
      began to brush them. I <reg orig="re-|peated">repeated</reg>
      <lb/> my desire several times, simplifying and re-simplifying <lb/> it, and at last he got the
      idea. Then he went away and put a <lb/> coolie at the work, and explained that he would lose
      caste if <lb/> he did it himself; it would be pollution, by the law of his caste, <lb/> and it
      would cost him a deal of fuss and trouble to purify <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>
      <lb/> and accomplish his rehabilitation. He said that that kind <lb/> of work was strictly
      forbidden to persons of caste, and as <lb/> strictly restricted to the very bottom layer of
      Hindoo society <lb/> &mdash;the despised <hi rend="italic">Sudra</hi> (the
      toiler, the laborer). He was right; <lb/> and apparently the poor Sudra has been
      content with his <lb/> strange lot, his insulting distinction, for ages and
      ages&mdash;clear <lb/> back to the beginning of things, so to speak. Buckle says that
      <lb/> his name&mdash;laborer&mdash;is a term of contempt; that it is ordained <lb/>
      by the Institutes of Menu (900 B.C.) that <hi rend="italic">if a Sudra sit

      <note id="n364.1" place="foot" n="14"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg>

       <p>Without going into particulars I will remark that as a rule they wear no <reg

        <lb/> that would conceal the brand.&mdash;M.T.</p>

     <p>Manuel was a failure, poor old fellow. His age was against <lb/>
      <pb n="365" entity="DSSR_000002496_0380"/> him. He was desperately slow and phenomenally
      forgetful. <lb/> When he went three blocks on an errand he would be gone <lb/> two hours, and
      then forget what it was he went for. When <lb/> he packed a trunk it took him forever, and the
      trunk's contents <lb/> were an unimaginable chaos when he got done. He couldn't <lb/> wait
      satisfactorily at table&mdash;a prime defect, for if you haven't <lb/> your own servant
      in an Indian hotel you are likely to have a <lb/> slow time of it and go away hungry. We
      couldn't understand <lb/> his English; he couldn't understand ours; and when we found <lb/>
      that he couldn't understand his own, it seemed time for us to <lb/> part. I had to discharge
      him; there was no help for it. <lb/> But I did it as kindly as I could, and as gently. We must
      <lb/> part, said I, but I hoped we should meet again in a better <lb/> world. It was not true,
      but it was only a little thing to say, <lb/> and saved his feelings and cost me nothing.</p>
     <p>But now that he was gone, and was off my mind and heart, <lb/> my spirits began to rise at
      once, and I was soon feeling brisk <lb/> and ready to go out and have adventures. Then his
       <reg orig="newly-|hired">newly-hired</reg>
      <lb/> successor flitted in, touched his forehead, and began to <lb/> fly around here, there,
      and everywhere, on his velvet feet, and <lb/> in five minutes he had everything in the room
      "ship-shape and <lb/> Bristol fashion," as the sailors say, and was standing at the <lb/>
      salute, waiting for orders. Dear me, what a rustler he was <lb/> after the slumbrous way of
      Manuel, poor old slug! All my <lb/> heart, all my affection, all my admiration, went out <reg
       orig="spontane-|ously">spontaneously</reg>
      <lb/> to this frisky little forked black thing, this compact and <lb/> compressed incarnation
      of energy and force and promptness <lb/> and celerity and confidence, this smart, smily,
      engaging, <lb/> shiney-eyed little devil, feruled on his upper end by a <reg orig="gleam-|ing"
       >gleaming</reg>
      <lb/> fire-coal of a fez with a red-hot tassel dangling from it.</p>
     <p>I said, with deep satisfaction&mdash;</p>
     <p>"You'll suit. What is your name?"</p>
     <p>He reeled it mellowly off.</p>
     <pb n="366" entity="DSSR_000002496_0381"/>
     <p>"Let me see if I can make a selection out of it&mdash;for <lb/> business uses, I mean;
      we will keep the rest for Sundays. <lb/> Give it to me in installments."</p>
     <p>He did it. But there did not seem to be any short ones, <lb/> except Mousa&mdash;which
      suggested mouse. It was out of <lb/> character; it was too soft, too quiet, too conservative;
      it didn't <lb/> fit his splendid style. I considered, and said:</p>
     <p>"Mousa is short enough, but I don't quite like it. It seems <lb/>
      colorless&mdash;inharmonious&mdash;inadequate; and I am sensitive to <lb/> such
      things. How do you think Satan would do?"</p>
     <p>"Yes, master. Satan do wair good."</p>
     <p>It was his way of saying "very good."</p>
     <p>There was a rap at the door. Satan covered the ground <lb/> with a single skip; there was a
      word or two of Hindostani, <lb/> then he disappeared. Three minutes later he was before me
      <lb/> again, militarily erect, and waiting for me to speak first.</p>
     <p>"What is it, Satan?"</p>
     <p>"God want to see you."</p>
     <p>
      <hi rend="italic">"Who?"</hi>
     </p>
     <p>"God. I show him up, master?"</p>
     <p>"Why, this is so unusual, that&mdash;that&mdash;well, you see&mdash; <lb/>
      indeed I am so unprepared&mdash;I don't quite know what I <hi rend="italic">do </hi>
      <lb/> mean. Dear me, can't you explain? Don't you see that this <lb/> is a most
      ex&mdash;"</p>
     <p>"Here his card, master."</p>
     <p>Wasn't it curious&mdash;and amazing, and tremendous, and all <lb/> that? Such a
      personage going around calling on such as I, <lb/> and sending up his card, like a
      mortal&mdash;sending it up by Satan. <lb/> It was a bewildering collision of the
      impossibles. But this <lb/> was the land of the Arabian Nights, this was India! and what <lb/>
      is it that cannot happen in India?</p>
     <p>We had the interview. Satan was right&mdash;the Visitor was <lb/> indeed a God in the
      conviction of his multitudinous followers, <lb/>
      <pb n="367" entity="DSSR_000002496_0382"/> and was worshiped by them in sincerity and humble
       <reg orig="adora-|tion">adoration</reg>. <lb/> They are troubled by no doubts as to his
      divine origin <lb/> and office. They believe in him, they pray to him, they make <lb/>
      offerings to him, they beg of him remission of sins; to them <lb/> his person, together with
      everything connected with it, is <lb/> sacred; from his barber they buy the parings of his
      nails and <lb/> set them in gold, and wear them as precious amulets.</p>
     <p>I tried to seem tranquilly conversational and at rest, but I <lb/> was not. Would you have
      been? I was in a suppressed <lb/> frenzy of excitement and curiosity and glad wonder. I could
      <lb/> not keep my eyes off him. I was looking upon a <hi rend="italic">god</hi>, an <lb/>
      actual god, a recognized and accepted god; and every detail of <lb/> his person and his dress
      had a consuming interest for me. And <lb/> the thought went floating through my head, "He is
      worshiped <lb/> &mdash;think of it&mdash;he is not a recipient of the pale homage
      <lb/> called compliment, wherewith the highest human clay must <lb/> make shift to be
      satisfied, but of an infinitely richer spiritual <lb/> food: adoration,
      worship!&mdash;men and women lay their cares <lb/> and their griefs and their broken
      hearts at his feet; and he <lb/> gives them his peace, and they go away healed."</p>
     <p>And just then the Awful Visitor said, in the simplest <lb/> way&mdash;</p>
     <p>"There is a feature of the philosophy of Huck Finn <lb/> which"&mdash;and went
      luminously on with the construction of a <lb/> compact and nicely-discriminated literary
      verdict.</p>
     <p>It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a land of surprises&mdash;India! I had had my ambitions
      <lb/> &mdash;I had hoped, and almost expected, to be read by kings and <lb/> presidents
      and emperors&mdash;but I had never looked so high as <lb/> That. It would be false
      modesty to pretend that I was not <lb/> inordinately pleased. I was. I was much more pleased
      than <lb/> I should have been with a compliment from a man.</p>
     <p>He remained half an hour, and I found him a most <reg orig="courte-|ous">courteous</reg>
      <lb/> and charming gentleman. The godship has been in his <lb/>
      <pb n="368" entity="DSSR_000002496_0383"/> family a good while, but I do not know how long. He
      is a <lb/> Mohammedan deity; by earthly rank he is a prince; not an <lb/> Indian but a Persian
      prince. He is a direct descendant of the <lb/> Prophet's line. He is comely; also
      young&mdash;for a god; not <lb/> forty, perhaps not above thirty-five years old. He wears
      his <lb/> immense honors with tranquil grace, and with a dignity proper <lb/> to his awful
      calling. He speaks English with the ease and <lb/> purity of a person born to it. I think I am
      not overstating <lb/> this. He was the only god I had ever seen, and I was very <lb/>
      favorably impressed. When he rose to say good-bye, the door <lb/> swung open and I caught the
      flash of a red fez, and heard <lb/> these words, reverently said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Satan see God out?"</p>
     <p>"Yes." And these mis-mated Beings passed from view&mdash; <lb/> Satan in the lead and
      The Other following after.</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> next picture in my mind is Government House, on <lb/> Malabar
      Point, with the wide sea-view from the <reg orig="win-|dows">windows</reg>
      <lb/> and broad balconies; abode of His Excellency <lb/> the Governor of the Bombay
      Presidency&mdash;a residence which <lb/> is European in everything but the native guards
      and servants, <lb/> and is a home and a palace of state harmoniously combined.</p>
     <p>That was England, the English power, the English <reg orig="civil-|ization"
      >civilization</reg>, <lb/> the modern civilization&mdash;with the quiet elegancies and
      <lb/> quiet colors and quiet tastes and quiet dignity that are the <lb/> outcome of the modern
      cultivation. And following it came a <lb/> picture of the ancient civilization of
      India&mdash;an hour in the <lb/> mansion of a native prince: Kumar Schri Samatsinhji
      Bahadur <lb/> of the Palitana State.</p>
     <p>The young lad, his heir, was with the prince; also, the lad's <lb/> sister, a wee brown
      sprite, very pretty, very serious, very <reg orig="win-|ning">winning</reg>, <lb/> delicately
      moulded, costumed like the daintiest butterfly, <lb/> a dear little fairyland princess,
      gravely willing to be friendly <lb/> with the strangers, but in the beginning preferring to
      hold her <lb/> father's hand until she could take stock of them and determine <lb/> how far
      they were to be trusted. She must have been eight <lb/> years old; so in the natural
      (Indian) order of things she would <lb/> be a bride in three or four years
      from now, and then this free <lb/> contact with the sun and the air and the other belongings
      of <lb/> out-door nature and comradeship with visiting male folk would <lb/> end, and she
      would shut herself up in the zenana for life, like <lb/>
      <pb n="370" entity="DSSR_000002496_0385"/> her mother, and by inherited habit of mind would be
      happy in <lb/> that seclusion and not look upon it as an irksome restraint and <lb/> a weary
      captivity.</p>

     <p>The game which the prince amuses his leisure <reg orig="with&mdash;how-|ever"
       >with&mdash;however</reg>, <lb/> never mind it, I should never be able to describe it
       <reg orig="intel-|ligibly">intelligibly</reg>. <lb/> I tried to get an idea of it while my
      wife and daughter <lb/> visited the princess in the zenana, <lb/> a lady of charming graces
      and <lb/> a fluent speaker of English, but I <lb/> did not make it out. It is a <lb/>
      complicated game, and I believe <lb/> it is said that nobody can learn <lb/> to play it well
      but an Indian. <lb/> And I was not able to learn how <lb/> to wind a turban. It seemed a <lb/>
      simple art and easy; but that <lb/> was a deception. It is a piece of <lb/> thin, delicate
      stuff a foot wide or <lb/> more, and forty or fifty feet <lb/> long; and the exhibitor of the
      <lb/> art takes one end of it in his <lb/> two hands, and winds it in and <lb/> out
      intricately about his head, <lb/> twisting it as he goes, and in a minute or two the thing is
      <lb/> finished, and is neat and symmetrical and fits as snugly as a <lb/> mould.</p>
     <p>We were interested in the wardrobe and the jewels, and in <lb/> the silverware, and its
      grace of shape and beauty and <reg orig="deli-|cacy">delicacy</reg>
      <lb/> of ornamentation. The silverware is kept locked up, except <lb/> at meal-times, and none
      but the chief butler and the prince <lb/> have keys to the safe. I did not clearly understand
      why, but <lb/> it was not for the protection of the silver. It was either to <lb/> protect the
      prince from the contamination which his caste <lb/>
      <pb n="371" entity="DSSR_000002496_0386"/> would suffer if the vessels were touched by
      low-caste hands, or <lb/> it was to protect his highness from poison. Possibly it was <lb/>
      both. I believe a salaried taster has to taste everything before <lb/> the prince ventures
      it&mdash;an ancient and judicious custom in the <lb/> East, and has thinned out the
      tasters a good deal, for of course <lb/> it is the cook that puts the poison in. If I were an
      Indian <lb/> prince I would not go to the expense of a taster, I would eat <lb/> with the
      cook.</p>
     <p>Ceremonials are always interesting; and I noted that the <lb/> Indian good-morning is a
      ceremonial, whereas ours doesn't <lb/> amount to that. In salutation the son reverently
      touches the <lb/> father's forehead with a small silver implement tipped with <lb/> vermillion
      paste which leaves a red spot there, and in return <lb/> the son receives the father's
      blessing. Our good morning is <lb/> well enough for the rowdy West, perhaps, but would be too
      <lb/> brusque for the soft and ceremonious East.</p>
     <p>After being properly necklaced, according to custom, with <lb/> great garlands made of
      yellow flowers, and provided with <lb/> betel-nut to chew, this pleasant visit closed, and we
      passed <lb/> thence to a scene of a different sort: from this glow of color <lb/> and this
      sunny life to those grim receptacles of the Parsee dead, <lb/> the Towers of Silence. There is
      something stately about that <lb/> name, and an impressiveness which sinks deep; the hush of
      <lb/> death is in it. We have the Grave, the Tomb, the Mausoleum, <lb/> God's Acre, the
      Cemetery; and association has made them <reg orig="elo-|quent">eloquent</reg>
      <lb/> with solemn meaning; but we have no name that is so <lb/> majestic as that one, or
      lingers upon the ear with such deep and <lb/> haunting pathos.</p>
     <p>On lofty ground, in the midst of a paradise of tropical foliage <lb/> and flowers, remote
      from the world and its turmoil and noise, <lb/> they stood&mdash;the Towers of Silence;
      and away below was <lb/> spread the wide groves of cocoa palms, then the city, mile on <lb/>
      mile, then the ocean with its fleets of creeping ships&mdash;all <lb/>
      <pb n="372" entity="DSSR_000002496_0387"/> steeped in a stillness as deep as the hush that
      hallowed this <lb/> high place of the dead. The vultures were there. They stood <lb/> close
      together in a great circle all around the rim of a massive <lb/> low tower&mdash;waiting;
      stood as motionless as sculptured <reg orig="orna-|ments">ornaments</reg>, <lb/> and indeed
      almost deceived one into the belief that that <lb/> was what they were. Presently there was a
      slight stir among <lb/> the score of persons present, and all moved reverently out of <lb/>
      the path and ceased from talking. A funeral procession <reg orig="en-|tered">entered</reg>
      <lb/> the great gate, marching two and two, and moved <lb/> silently by, toward the Tower. The
      corpse lay in a shallow <lb/> shell, and was under cover of a white cloth, but was otherwise
      <lb/> naked. The bearers of the body were separated by an interval <lb/> of thirty feet from
      the mourners. They, and also the <reg orig="mourn-|ers">mourners</reg>, <lb/> were draped all
      in pure white, and each couple of mourners <lb/> was figuratively bound together by a piece of
      white rope or a <lb/> handkerchief&mdash;though they merely held the ends of it in <lb/>
      their hands. Behind the procession followed a dog, which was <lb/> led in a leash. When the
      mourners had reached the <reg orig="neighbor-|hood">neighborhood</reg>
      <lb/> of the Tower&mdash;neither they nor any other human being <lb/> but the bearers of
      the dead must approach within thirty feet <lb/> of it&mdash;they turned and went back to
      one of the prayerhouses <lb/> within the gates, to pray for the spirit of their dead. The
      <lb/> bearers unlocked the Tower's sole door and disappeared from <lb/> view within. In a
      little while they came out bringing the bier <lb/> and the white covering-cloth, and locked
      the door again. Then <lb/> the ring of vultures rose, flapping their wings, and swooped <lb/>
      down into the Tower to devour the body. Nothing was left <lb/> of it but a clean-picked
      skeleton when they flocked out again <lb/> a few minutes afterward.</p>
     <p>The principle which underlies and orders everything <reg orig="con-|nected">connected</reg>
      <lb/> with a Parsee funeral is Purity. By the tenets of the <lb/> Zoroastrian religion, the
      elements, Earth, Fire, and Water, are <lb/> sacred, and must not be contaminated by contact
      with a dead <lb/>
      <pb entity="DSSR_000002496_0388"/>
      <figure id="f103" rend="page" entity="DSSR_000002496_0388">
       <p>ONE OF THE TOWERS OF SILENCE.</p>
      </figure>
      <pb entity="DSSR_000002496_0389"/>
      <pb n="375" entity="DSSR_000002496_0390"/> body. Hence corpses must not be burned, neither
      must they <lb/> be buried. None may touch the dead or enter the Towers <lb/> where they repose
      except certain men who are officially <lb/> appointed for that purpose. They receive high pay,
      but theirs <lb/> is a dismal life, for they must live apart from their species, <lb/> because
      their commerce with the dead defiles them, and any <lb/> who should associate with them would
      share their defilement. <lb/> When they come out of the Tower the clothes they are <reg
       orig="wear-|ing">wearing</reg>
      <lb/> are exchanged for others, in a building within the grounds, <lb/> and the ones which
      they have taken off are left behind, for <lb/> they are contaminated, and must never be used
      again or suffered <lb/> to go outside the grounds. These bearers come to every <lb/> funeral
      in new garments. So far as is known, no human being, <lb/> other than an official
      corpse-bearer&mdash;save one&mdash;has ever <lb/> entered a Tower of Silence after
      its consecration. Just a <lb/> hundred years ago a European rushed in behind the bearers <lb/>
      and fed his brutal curiosity with a glimpse of the forbidden <lb/> mysteries of the place.
      This shabby savage's name is not <lb/> given; his quality is also concealed. These two
      details, taken <lb/> in connection with the fact that for his extraordinary offense <lb/> the
      only punishment he got from the East India Company's <lb/> Government was a solemn official
      "reprimand"&mdash;suggest the <lb/> suspicion that he was a European of consequence. The
      same <lb/> public document which contained the reprimand gave warning <lb/> that future
      offenders of his sort, if in the Company's service, <lb/> would be dismissed; and if
      merchants, suffer revocation of <lb/> license and exile to England.</p>
     <p>The Towers are not tall, but are low in proportion to their <lb/> circumference, like a
      gasometer. If you should fill a gasometer <lb/> half way up with solid granite masonry, then
      drive a wide <lb/> and deep well down through the center of this mass of masonry, <lb/> you
      would have the idea of a Tower of Silence. On the <lb/> masonry surrounding the well the
      bodies lie, in shallow trenches <lb/>
      <pb n="376" entity="DSSR_000002496_0391"/> which radiate like wheel-spokes from the well. The
      trenches <lb/> slant toward the well and carry into it the rainfall. <reg orig="Under-|ground"
       >Underground</reg>
      <lb/> drains, with charcoal filters in them, carry off this <lb/> water from the bottom of the
      well.</p>
     <p>When a skeleton has lain in the Tower exposed to the rain <lb/> and the flaming sun a month
      it is perfectly dry and clean. <lb/> Then the same bearers that brought it there come gloved
      and <lb/> take it up with tongs and throw it into the well. There it <lb/> turns to dust. It
      is never seen again, never touched again, in <lb/> the world. Other peoples separate their
      dead, and preserve <lb/> and continue social distinctions in the grave&mdash;the
      skeletons of <lb/> kings and statesmen and generals in temples and pantheons <lb/> proper to
      skeletons of their degree, and the skeletons of the <lb/> commonplace and the poor in places
      suited to their meaner <lb/> estate; but the Parsees hold that all men rank alike in death
      <lb/> &mdash;all are humble, all poor, all destitute. In sign of their <lb/> poverty they
      are sent to their grave naked, in sign of their <lb/> equality the bones of the rich, the
      poor, the illustrious and the <lb/> obscure are flung into the common well together. At a
      Parsee <lb/> funeral there are no vehicles; all concerned must walk, both <lb/> rich and poor,
      howsoever great the distance to be traversed <lb/> may be. In the wells of the Five Towers of
      Silence is mingled <lb/> the dust of all the Parsee men and women and children who <lb/> have
      died in Bombay and its vicinity during the two centuries <lb/> which have elapsed since the
      Mohammedan conquerors drove <lb/> the Parsees out of Persia, and into that region of India.
      The <lb/> earliest of the five towers was built by the Modi family <reg orig="some-|thing"
       >something</reg>
      <lb/> more than 200 years ago, and it is now reserved to the <lb/> heirs of that house; none
      but the dead of that blood are <lb/> carried thither.</p>
     <p>The origin of at least one of the details of a Parsee funeral <lb/> is not now
      known&mdash;the presence of the dog. Before a corpse <lb/> is borne from the house of
      mourning it must be uncovered and <lb/>
      <pb n="377" entity="DSSR_000002496_0392"/> exposed to the gaze of a dog; a dog must also be
      led in the <lb/> rear of the funeral. Mr. Nusserwanjee Byramjee, Secretary to <lb/> the Parsee
      Punchayet, said that these formalities had once had <lb/> a meaning and a reason for their
      institution, but that they <lb/> were survivals whose origin none could now account for. <lb/>
      Custom and tradition continue them in force, antiquity hallows <lb/> them. It is thought that
      in ancient times in Persia the dog <lb/> was a sacred animal and could guide souls to heaven;
      also that <lb/> his eye had the power of purifying objects which had been <lb/> contaminated
      by the touch of the dead; and that hence his <lb/> presence with the funeral cortege provides
      an ever-applicable <lb/> remedy in case of need.</p>
     <p>The Parsees claim that their method of disposing of the <lb/> dead is an effective
      protection of the living; that it <reg orig="dissemin-|ates">disseminates</reg>
      <lb/> no corruption, no impurities of any sort, no disease-germs; <lb/> that no wrap, no
      garment which has touched the dead is <lb/> allowed to touch the living afterward; that from
      the Towers <lb/> of Silence nothing proceeds which can carry harm to the <reg orig="out-|side"
       >outside</reg>
      <lb/> world. These are just claims, I think. As a sanitary <lb/> measure, their system seems
      to be about the equivalent of <lb/> cremation, and as sure. We are drifting
      slowly&mdash;but <reg orig="hope-|fully&mdash;toward">hopefully&mdash;toward</reg>
      <lb/> cremation in these days. It could not be <reg orig="ex-|pected">expected</reg>
      <lb/> that this progress should be swift, but if it be steady <lb/> and continuous, even if
      slow, that will suffice. When <reg orig="cre-|mation">cremation</reg>
      <lb/> becomes the rule we shall cease to shudder at it; we <lb/> should shudder at burial if
      we allowed ourselves to think what <lb/> goes on in the grave.</p>
     <p>The dog was an impressive figure to me, representing as he <lb/> did a mystery whose key is
      lost. He was humble, and <reg orig="appar-|ently">apparently</reg>
      <lb/> depressed; and he let his head droop pensively, and <lb/> looked as if he might be
      trying to call back to his mind what <lb/> it was that he had used to symbolize ages ago when
      he began <lb/> his function. There was another impressive thing close at <lb/>
      <pb n="378" entity="DSSR_000002496_0393"/> hand, but I was not privileged to see it. That was
      the sacred <lb/> fire&mdash;a fire which is supposed to have been burning without <lb/>
      interruption for more than two centuries; and so, living by <lb/> the same heat that was
      imparted to it so long ago.</p>
     <p>The Parsees are a remarkable community. There are only <lb/> about 60,000 in Bombay, and
      only about half as many as that <lb/> in the rest of India; but they make up in importance
      what <lb/> they lack in numbers. They are highly educated, energetic, <lb/> enterprising,
      progressive, rich, and <lb/> the Jew himself is not more lavish <lb/> or catholic in his
      charities and <lb/> benevolences. The Parsees build <lb/> and endow hospitals, for both men
      <lb/> and animals; and they and their <lb/> womenkind keep an open purse for <lb/> all great
      and good objects. They <lb/> are a political force, and a valued <lb/> support to the
      government. They <lb/> have a pure and lofty religion, and <lb/> they preserve it in its
      integrity and <lb/> order their lives by it.</p>

     </argument>
     <p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> next picture that drifts across the field of my <lb/> memory
      is one which is connected with religious <lb/> things. We were taken by friends to see a Jain
      <lb/> temple. It was small, and had many flags or streamers flying <lb/> from poles standing
      above its roof; and its little battlements <lb/> supported a great many small idols or images.
      Up stairs, <lb/> inside, a solitary Jain was praying or reciting aloud in the <lb/> middle of
      the room. Our presence did not interrupt him, nor <lb/> even incommode him or modify his
      fervor. Ten or twelve <lb/> feet in front of him was the idol, a small figure in a sitting
      <lb/> posture. It had the pinkish look of a wax doll, but lacked the <lb/> doll's roundness of
      limb and approximation to correctness of <lb/> form and justness of proportion. Mr. Gandhi
      explained <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg>
      <lb/> to us. He was delegate to the Chicago Fair Congress of <lb/> Religions. It was lucidly
      done, in masterly English, but in <lb/> time it faded from me, and now I have nothing left of
      that <lb/> episode but an impression: a dim idea of a religious belief <lb/> clothed in subtle
      intellectual forms, lofty and clean, barren of <lb/> fleshly grossnesses; and with this
      another dim impression <lb/> which connects that intellectual system somehow with that <lb/>
      crude image, that inadequate idol&mdash;how, I do not know. <lb/> Properly they do not
      seem to belong together. Apparently <lb/> the idol symbolized a person who had become a saint
      or a god <lb/> through accessions of steadily augmenting holiness acquired <lb/> through a
      series of reincarnations and promotions extending <lb/>
      <pb n="380" entity="DSSR_000002496_0395"/> over many ages; and was now at last a saint and
      qualified to <lb/> vicariously receive worship and transmit it to heaven's <reg
       orig="chan-|cellery">chancellery</reg>. <lb/> Was that it?</p>
     <p>And thence we went to Mr. Premchand Roychand's <reg orig="bun-|galow">bungalow</reg>, <lb/>
      in Lovelane, Byculla, where an Indian prince was to <lb/> receive a deputation of the Jain
      community who desired to <lb/> congratulate him upon a high honor lately conferred upon <lb/>
      him by his sovereign, Victoria, Empress of India. She had <lb/> made him a knight of the order
      of the Star of India. It would <lb/> seem that even the grandest Indian prince is glad to add
      the <lb/> modest title "Sir" to his ancient native grandeurs, and is <lb/> willing to do
      valuable service to win it. He will remit taxes <lb/> liberally, and will spend money freely
      upon the betterment of <lb/> the condition of his subjects, if there is a knighthood to be
      <lb/> gotten by it. And he will also do good work and a deal of it <lb/> to get a gun added to
      the salute allowed him by the British <lb/> Government. Every year the Empress distributes
       <reg orig="knight-|hoods">knighthoods</reg>
      <lb/> and adds guns for public services done by native princes. <lb/> The salute of a small
      prince is three or four guns; princes of <lb/> greater consequence have salutes that run
      higher and higher, <lb/> gun by gun,&mdash;oh, clear away up to eleven; possibly more,
      but <lb/> I did not hear of any above eleven-gun princes. I was told <lb/> that when a
      four-gun prince gets a gun added, he is pretty <lb/> troublesome for a while, till the novelty
      wears off, for he likes <lb/> the music, and keeps hunting up pretexts to get himself <lb/>
      saluted. It may be that supremely grand folk, like the Nyzam <lb/> of Hyderabad and the
      Gaikwar of Baroda, have more than <lb/> eleven guns, but I don't know.</p>
     <p>When we arrived at the bungalow, the large hall on the <lb/> ground floor was already about
      full, and carriages were still <lb/> flowing into the grounds. The company present made a fine
      <lb/> show, an exhibition of human fireworks, so to speak, in the <lb/> matters of costume and
      comminglings of brilliant color. The <lb/>
      <pb n="381" entity="DSSR_000002496_0396"/> variety of form noticeable in the display of
      turbans was <lb/> remarkable. We were told that the explanation of this was, <lb/> that this
      Jain delegation was drawn from many parts of India, <lb/> and that each man wore the turban
      that was in vogue in his <lb/> own region. This diversity of turbans made a beautiful effect. </p>
     <p>I could have wished to start a rival exhibition there, of <lb/> Christian hats and clothes.
      I would have cleared one side of <lb/> the room of its Indian splendors and repacked the space
      with <lb/> Christians drawn from America, England, and the Colonies, <lb/> dressed in the hats
      and habits of now, and of twenty and <lb/> forty and fifty years ago. It would have been a
      hideous <lb/> exhibition, a thoroughly devilish spectacle. Then there would <lb/> have been
      the added disadvantage of the white complexion. <lb/> It is not an unbearably unpleasant
      complexion when it keeps <lb/> to itself, but when it comes into competition with masses of
      <lb/> brown and black the fact is betrayed that it is endurable only <lb/> because we are used
      to it. Nearly all black and brown skins <lb/> are beautiful, but a beautiful white skin is
      rare. How rare, <lb/> one may learn by walking down a street in Paris, New York, <lb/> or
      London on a week-day&mdash;particularly an unfashionable <lb/> street&mdash;and
      keeping count of the satisfactory complexions <lb/> encountered in the course of a mile. Where

      <lb/> are massed, they make the whites look <reg orig="bleached-|out">bleached-out</reg>,
      <lb/> unwholesome, and sometimes frankly ghastly. I could <lb/> notice this as a boy, down
      South in the slavery days before the <lb/> war. The splendid black satin skin of the South
      African <lb/> Zulus of Durban seemed to me to come very close to <reg orig="perfec-|tion"
       >perfection</reg>. <lb/> I can see those Zulus yet&mdash;'ricksha athletes waiting in
      <lb/> front of the hotel for custom; handsome and intensely black <lb/> creatures, moderately
      clothed in loose summer stuffs whose <lb/> snowy whiteness made the black all the blacker by
      contrast. <lb/> Keeping that group in my mind, I can compare those <reg orig="com-|plexions"
       >complexions</reg>
      <lb/> with the white ones which are streaming past this <lb/> London window now:</p>

     <p>No end of people whose skins are dull and characterless <lb/> modifications of the tint
      which we miscall white. Some of these <lb/> faces are pimply; some exhibit other signs of
      diseased blood; <lb/> some show scars of a tint out of a harmony with the <reg
       orig="surround-|ing">surrounding</reg>
      <lb/> shades of color. The white man's complexion makes no <lb/> concealments. It can't. It
      seemed to have been designed as <lb/> a catch-all for everything that can damage it. Ladies
      have to <lb/> paint it, and powder it, and cosmetic it, and diet it with arsenic, <lb/> and
      enamel it, and be always enticing it, and persuading it, <lb/> and pestering it, and fussing
      at it, to make it beautiful; and <lb/> they do not succeed. But these efforts show what they
      think <lb/> of the natural complexion, as distributed. As distributed it <lb/> needs these
      helps. The complexion which they try to <reg orig="counter-|feit">counterfeit</reg>
      <lb/> is one which nature restricts to the few&mdash;to the very few. <lb/> To
      ninety-nine persons she gives a bad complexion, to the <lb/> hundredth a good one. The
      hundredth can keep it&mdash;how <lb/> long? Ten years, perhaps.</p>
     <p>The advantage is with the Zulu, I think. He starts with a <lb/> beautiful complexion, and it
      will last him through. And as <lb/> for the Indian brown&mdash;firm, smooth, blemishless,
      pleasant and <lb/> restful to the eye, afraid of no color, harmonizing with all <lb/> colors
      and adding a grace to them all&mdash;I think there is no <lb/> sort of chance for the
      average white complexion against that <lb/> rich and perfect tint.</p>
     <p>To return to the bungalow. The most gorgeous costumes <lb/> present were worn by some
      children. They seemed to blaze, <lb/> so bright were the colors, and so brilliant the jewels
      strung <lb/> over the rich materials. These children were professional <lb/> nautch-dancers,
      and looked like girls, but they were boys. <lb/> They got up by ones and twos and fours, and
      danced and sang <lb/> to an accompaniment of weird music. Their posturings and <lb/>
      gesturings were elaborate and graceful, but their voices were <lb/> stringently raspy and
      unpleasant, and there was a good deal <lb/> of monotony about the tune.</p>
     <pb n="384" entity="DSSR_000002496_0399"/>
     <p>By and by there was a burst of shouts and cheers outside <lb/> and the prince with his train
      entered in fine dramatic style. <lb/> He was a stately man, he was ideally costumed, and
      fairly <lb/> festooned with ropes of gems; some of the ropes were of pearls, <lb/> some were
      of uncut great emeralds&mdash;emeralds renowned in <lb/> Bombay for their quality and
      value. Their size was marvelous, <lb/> and enticing to the eye, those rocks. A
      boy&mdash;a princeling <lb/> &mdash;was with the prince, and he also was a radiant
      exhibition.</p>
     <p>The ceremonies were not tedious. The prince strode to his <lb/> throne with the port and
      majesty&mdash;and the sternness&mdash;of a <lb/> Julius
      C&aelig;sar coming to receive and receipt for a back-country <lb/>
      kingdom and have it over and get out, and no fooling. There <lb/> was a throne for the young
      prince, too, and the two sat there, <lb/> side by side, with their officers grouped at either
      hand and <lb/> most accurately and creditably reproducing the pictures which <lb/> one sees in
      the books&mdash;pictures which people in the prince's <lb/> line of business have been
      furnishing ever since Solomon <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg>
      <lb/> the Queen of Sheba and showed her his things. The <lb/> chief of the Jain delegation
      read his paper of congratulations, <lb/> then pushed it into a beautifully engraved silver
      cylinder, which <lb/> was delivered with ceremony into the prince's hands and at <lb/> once
      delivered by him without ceremony into the hands of an <lb/> officer. I will copy the address
      here. It is interesting, as <lb/> showing what an Indian prince's subject may have opportunity
      <lb/> to thank him for in these days of modern English rule, as <lb/> contrasted with what his
      ancestor would have given them <lb/> opportunity to thank him for a century and a half
      ago&mdash;the <lb/> days of freedom unhampered by English interference. A <reg
       orig="cen-|tury">century</reg>
      <lb/> and a half ago an address of thanks could have been put <lb/> into small space. It would
      have thanked the prince&mdash;</p>
     <list>
      <item>1. For not slaughtering too many of his people upon mere caprice;</item>
      <item>2. For not stripping them bare by sudden and arbitrary tax levies, and <lb/> bringing
       famine upon them;</item>
      <item>3. For not upon empty pretext destroying the rich and seizing their <lb/>
      property;</item>
     </list>
     <pb n="385" entity="DSSR_000002496_0400"/>
     <list>
      <item>4. For not killing, blinding, imprisoning, or banishing the relatives of the <lb/> royal
       house to protect the throne from possible plots;</item>
      <item>5. For not betraying the subject secretly, for a bribe, into the hands of <lb/> bands of
       professional Thugs, to be murdered and robbed in the prince's back lot.</item>
     </list>
     <p>Those were rather common princely industries in the old <lb/> times, but they and some
      others of a harsh sort ceased long <lb/> ago under English rule. Better industries have taken
      their <lb/> place, as this Address from the Jain community will show: <lb/>
      <q>"Your Highness,&mdash;We the undersigned members of the Jain community <lb/> of Bombay
       have the pleasure to approach your Highness with the expression <lb/> of our heartfelt
       congratulations on the recent conference on your Highness <lb/> of the Knighthood of the Most
       Exalted Order of the Star of India. Ten <lb/> years ago we had the pleasure and privilege of
       welcoming your Highness to <lb/> this city under circumstances which have made a memorable
       epoch in the <lb/> history of your State, for had it not been for a generous and reasonable
       spirit <lb/> that your Highness displayed in the negotiations between the Palitana Durbar
       <lb/> and the Jain community, the conciliatory spirit that animated our people <lb/> could
       not have borne fruit. That was the first step in your Highness's <reg orig="ad-|ministration"
        >administration</reg>, <lb/> and it fitly elicited the praise of the Jain community, and of
       the <lb/> Bombay Government. A decade of your Highness's administration, combined <lb/> with
       the abilities, training, and acquirements that your Highness brought to <lb/> bear upon it,
       has justly earned for your Highness the unique and honourable <lb/>
       distinction&mdash;the Knighthood of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India, <lb/>
       which we understand your Highness is the first to enjoy among Chiefs of <lb/> your Highness's
       rank and standing. And we assure your Highness that for <lb/> this mark of honour that has
       been conferred on you by Her Most Gracious <lb/> Majesty, the Queen-Empress, we feel no less
       proud than your Highness. <lb/> Establishment of commercial factories, schools, hospitals,
       etc., by your <reg orig="High-|ness">Highness</reg>
       <lb/> in your State has marked your Highness's career during these ten years, <lb/> and we
       trust that your Highness will be spared to rule over your people with <lb/> wisdom and
       foresight, and foster the many reforms that your Highness has <lb/> been pleased to introduce
       in your State. We again offer your Highness our <lb/> warmest felicitations for the honour
       that has been conferred on you. We <lb/> beg to remain your Highness's obedient
      servants."</q></p>
     <p>Factories, schools, hospitals, reforms. The prince <reg orig="propa-|gates">propagates</reg>
      <lb/> that kind of things in the modern times, and gets <reg orig="knight-|hood">knighthood</reg>
      <lb/> and guns for it.</p>
     <p>After the address the prince responded with snap and <lb/> brevity; spoke a moment with half
      a dozen guests in English, <lb/> and with an official or two in a native tongue; then the
      <lb/> garlands were distributed as usual, and the function ended.</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">Toward</hi> midnight, that night, there was another <reg
       orig="func-|tion">function</reg>. <lb/> This was a Hindoo wedding&mdash;no, I think it
      <lb/> was a betrothal ceremony. Always before, we had <lb/> driven through streets that were
      multitudinous and tumultuous <lb/> with picturesque native life, but now there was nothing of
      that. <lb/> We seemed to move through a city of the dead. There was <lb/> hardly a suggestion
      of life in those still and vacant streets. <lb/> Even the crows were silent. But everywhere on
      the ground <lb/> lay sleeping natives&mdash;hundreds and hundreds. They lay <lb/>
      stretched at full length and tightly wrapped in blankets, heads <lb/> and all. Their attitude
      and their rigidity counterfeited death. <lb/> The plague was not in Bombay then, but it is
      devasting the <lb/> city now. The shops are deserted, now, half of the people <lb/> have fled,
      and of the remainder the smitten perish by shoals <lb/> every day. No doubt the city looks now
      in the daytime as it <lb/> looked then at night. When we had pierced deep into the <reg
       orig="na-|tive">native</reg>
      <lb/> quarter and were threading its narrow dim lanes, we had <lb/> to go carefully, for men
      were stretched asleep all about and <lb/> there was hardly room to drive between them. And
      every <lb/> now and then a swarm of rats would scamper across past the <lb/> horses' feet in
      the vague light&mdash;the forbears of the rats that <lb/> are carrying the plague from
      house to house in Bombay now. <lb/> The shops were but sheds, little booths open to the
      street; and <lb/> the goods had been removed, and on the counters families were <lb/>
      sleeping, usually with an oil lamp present. Recurrent <reg orig="dead-|watches"

      <p>MIDNIGHT IN A BOMBAY STREET.</p>

     <p>But at last we turned a corner and saw a great glare of light <lb/> ahead. It was the home
      of the bride, wrapped in a perfect <lb/> conflagration of illuminations,&mdash;mainly
      gas-work designs, <lb/> gotten up specially for the occasion. Within was abundance of <lb/>
      brilliancy&mdash;flames, costumes, colors, decorations, mirrors&mdash;it <lb/> was
      another Aladdin show.</p>
     <p>The bride was a trim and comely little thing of twelve <lb/> years, dressed as we would
      dress a boy, though more <reg orig="expen-|sively">expensively</reg>
      <lb/> than we should do it, of course. She moved about very <lb/> much at her ease, and
      stopped and talked with the guests and <lb/> allowed her wedding jewelry to be examined. It
      was very fine. <lb/> Particularly a rope of great diamonds, a lovely thing to look <lb/> at
      and handle. It had a great emerald hanging to it.</p>
     <pb n="388" entity="DSSR_000002496_0403"/>
     <p>The bridegroom was not present. He was having betrothal <lb/> festivities of his own at his
      father's house. As I understood it, <lb/> he and the bride were to entertain company every
      night and <lb/> nearly all night for a week or more, then get married, if alive. <lb/> Both of
      the children were a little elderly, as brides and grooms <lb/> go, in India&mdash;twelve;
      they ought to have been married a year <lb/>

       <p>A HIGH PRICED NAUTCH GIRL.</p>
      </figure> or two sooner; still to a stranger twelve <lb/> seems quite young enough.</p>
     <p>A while after midnight a couple of <lb/> celebrated and high-priced nautch-girls <reg
       orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg>
      <lb/> in the gorgeous place, and danced <lb/> and sang. With them were <lb/> men who played
      upon strange <lb/> instruments which made <reg orig="un-|canny">uncanny</reg>
      <lb/> noises of a sort to make <lb/> one's flesh creep. One of these <lb/> instruments was a
      pipe, and to <lb/> its music the girls went through <lb/> a performance which <reg
       orig="represen-|ted">represented</reg>
      <lb/> snake-charming. It seemed <lb/> a doubtful sort of music to <lb/> charm anything with,
      but a <lb/> native gentleman assured me <lb/> that snakes like it and will come out of their
      holes and listen <lb/> to it with every evidence of refreshment and gratitude. He <lb/> said
      that at an entertainment in his grounds once, the pipe <lb/> brought out half a dozen snakes,
      and the music had to be stopped <lb/> before they would be persuaded to go. Nobody wanted
      their <lb/> company, for they were bold, familiar, and dangerous; but <lb/> no one would kill
      them, of course, for it is sinful for a Hindoo <lb/> to kill any kind of a creature.</p>
     <p>We withdrew from the festivities at two in the morning. <lb/> Another picture,
      then&mdash;but it has lodged itself in my memory</p>
     <pb n="389" entity="DSSR_000002496_0404"/>
     <p>rather as a stage-scene than as a reality. It is of a porch and <lb/> short flight of steps
      crowded with dark faces and ghostly-white <lb/> draperies flooded with the strong glare from
      the dazzling <reg orig="con-|centration">concentration</reg>
      <lb/> of illuminations; and midway of the steps one <reg orig="con-|spicuous">conspicuous</reg>
      <lb/> figure for accent&mdash;a turbaned giant, with a name <lb/> according to his size:
      Rao Bahadur Baskirao Balinkanje Pitale, <lb/> Vakeel to his Highness the Gaikwar of Baroda.
      Without him <lb/> the picture would not have been complete; and if his name had <lb/> been
      merely Smith, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> wouldn't have answered. Close at hand <lb/> on
      house-fronts on both sides of the narrow street were <reg orig="illum-|inations">illuminations</reg>
      <lb/> of a kind commonly employed by the natives&mdash;scores <lb/> of glass tumblers
      <lb/> (containing tapers) <lb/> fastened a few <reg orig="in-|ches">inches</reg>
      <lb/> apart all over <lb/> great latticed <lb/> frames, forming <lb/> starry <reg
       orig="constella-|tions">constellations</reg>
      <lb/> which showed <lb/> out vividly against <lb/> their black <reg orig="back-|grounds"

       orig="illum-|inations">illuminations</reg>
      <lb/> gathered together into a single mass, and glowed out of <lb/> the enveloping darkness
      like a sun.</p>

      <p>NAUTCH DANCING.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>Then again the deep silence, the skurrying rats, the dim <lb/> forms stretched everywhere on
      the ground; and on either <lb/> hand those open booths counterfeiting sepulchres, with <reg
       orig="coun-|terfeit">counterfeit</reg>
      <lb/> corpses sleeping motionless in the flicker of the <reg orig="counter-|feit">counterfeit</reg>
      <lb/> death lamps. And now, a year later, when I read the <lb/> cablegrams I seem to be
      reading of what I myself partly saw <lb/> &mdash;saw before it happened&mdash;in a
      prophetic dream, as it were. <lb/> One cablegram says, "Business in the native town is about</p>
     <pb n="390" entity="DSSR_000002496_0405"/>
     <p>suspended. Except the wailing and the tramp of the funerals. <lb/> There is but little life
      or movement. The closed shops exceed <lb/> in number those that remain open." Another says
      that <reg orig="325,-|000">325,000</reg>
      <lb/> of the people have fled the city and are carrying the plague <lb/> to the country. Three
      days later comes the news, "The <reg orig="popu-|lation">population</reg>
      <lb/> is reduced by <hi rend="italic">half</hi>." The refugees have carried the <lb/> disease
      to Karachi; "220 cases, 214 deaths." A day or two <lb/> later, "52 fresh cases, <hi
       rend="italic">all</hi> of which proved fatal."</p>
     <p>The plague carries with it a terror which no other disease <lb/> can excite; for of all
      diseases known to men it is the deadliest <lb/> &mdash;by far the deadliest. "Fifty-two
      fresh cases&mdash;<hi rend="italic">all</hi> fatal." <lb/> It is the Black Death alone
      that slays like that. We can all <lb/> imagine, after a fashion, the desolation of a
      plague-stricken <lb/> city, and the stupor of stillness broken at intervals by distant <lb/>
      bursts of wailing, marking the passing of funerals, here and there <lb/> and yonder, but I
      suppose it is not possible for us to realize <lb/> to ourselves the nightmare of dread and
      fear that possesses <lb/> the living who are present in such a place and cannot get away.
      <lb/> That half million fled from Bombay in a wild panic suggests <lb/> to us something of
      what they were feeling, but perhaps not <lb/> even they could realize what the half million
      were feeling <lb/> whom they left stranded behind to face the stalking horror <lb/> without
      chance of escape. Kinglake was in Cairo many years <lb/> ago during an epidemic of the Black
      Death, and he has <lb/> imagined the terrors that creep into a man's heart at such a <lb/>
      time and follow him until they themselves breed the fatal sign <lb/> in the armpit, and then
      the delirium with confused images, and <lb/> home-dreams, and reeling billiard-tables, and
      then the sudden <lb/> blank of death:</p>
     <p>"To the contagionist, filled as he is with the dread of final causes, having <lb/> no faith
      in destiny, nor in the fixed will of God, and with none of the <reg orig="devil-|may-care"
       >devil-may-care</reg>
      <lb/> indifference which might stand him instead of creeds&mdash;to such one, <lb/> every
      rag that shivers in the breeze of a plague-stricken city has this sort of <lb/> sublimity. If
      by any terrible ordinance he be forced to venture forth, he sees <lb/> death dangling from
      every sleeve; and, as he creeps forward, he poises his <lb/>
      <pb n="391" entity="DSSR_000002496_0406"/> shuddering limbs between the imminent jacket that
      is stabbing at his right <lb/> elbow and the murderous pelisse that threatens to mow him clean
      down as it <lb/> sweeps along on his left. But most of all he dreads that which most of all he
      <lb/> should love&mdash;the touch of a woman's dress; for mothers and wives, hurrying
      <lb/> forth on kindly errands from the bedsides of the dying, go slouching along <lb/> through
      the streets more willfully and less courteously than the men. For a <lb/> while it may be that
      the caution of the poor Levantine may enable him to <lb/> avoid contact, but sooner or later,
      perhaps, the dreaded chance arrives; that <lb/> bundle of linen, with the dark tearful eyes at
      the top of it, that labors along <lb/> with the voluptuous clumsiness of Grisi&mdash;she
      has touched the poor Levantine <lb/> with the hem of her sleeve! From that dread moment his
      peace is gone; his <lb/> mind for ever hanging upon the fatal touch invites the blow which he
      fears; <lb/> he watches for the symptoms of plague so carefully, that sooner or later they
      <lb/> come in truth. The parched mouth is a sign&mdash;his mouth <hi rend="italic"
      >is</hi> parched; the <lb/> throbbing brain&mdash;his brain <hi rend="italic">does</hi>
      throb; the rapid pulse&mdash;he touches his own <lb/> wrist (for he dares not
      ask counsel of any man lest he be deserted), he touches <lb/> his wrist, and feels
      how his frighted blood goes galloping out of his heart. <lb/> There is nothing but the fatal
      swelling that is wanting to make his sad <reg orig="con-|viction">conviction</reg>
      <lb/> complete; immediately, he has an odd feel under the arm&mdash;no pain, <lb/> but a
      little straining of the skin; he would to God it were his fancy that were <lb/> strong enough
      to give him that sensation; this is the worst of all. It now <lb/> seems to him that he could
      be happy and contented with his parched mouth, <lb/> and his throbbing brain, and his rapid
      pulse, if only he could know that there <lb/> were no swelling under the left arm; but dares
      he try?&mdash;in a moment of <lb/> calmness and deliberation he dares not; but when for a
      while he has writhed <lb/> under the torture of suspense, a sudden strength of will drives him
      to seek <lb/> and know his fate; he touches the gland, and finds the skin sane and sound <lb/>
      but under the cuticle there lies a small lump like a pistol-bullet, that moves as <lb/> he
      pushes it. Oh! but is this for all certainty, is this the sentence of death? <lb/> Feel the
      gland of the other arm. There is not the same lump exactly, yet <lb/> something a little like
      it. Have not some people glands naturally enlarged? <lb/> &mdash;would to heaven he were
      one! So he does for himself the work of the <lb/> plague, and when the Angel of Death thus
      courted does indeed and in truth <lb/> come, he has only to finish that which has been so well
      begun; he passes his <lb/> fiery hand over the brain of the victim, and lets him rave for a
      season, but all <lb/> chance-wise, of people and things once dear, or of people and things

      sister&mdash;(he sees her, he says, <lb/> on a Sunday morning, for all the
      church bells are ringing); he looks up and <lb/> down through the universe, and owns
      it well piled with bales upon bales of <lb/> cotton, and cotton eternal&mdash;so much
      so&mdash;that he feels&mdash;he knows&mdash;he <lb/> swears he could make that
      winning hazard, if the billiard-table would not <lb/> slant upwards, and if the cue were a cue
      worth playing with; but it is not&mdash; <lb/> it's a cue that won't move&mdash;his
      own arm won't move&mdash;in short, there's the <lb/> devil to pay in the brain of the
      poor Levantine; and perhaps, the next night <lb/> but one he becomes the "life and the soul"

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">One</hi> day during our stay in Bombay there was a criminal <lb/>
      trial of a most interesting sort, a terribly realistic <lb/> chapter out of the "Arabian
      Nights," a strange <reg orig="mix-|ture">mixture</reg>
      <lb/> of simplicities and pieties and murderous practicalities, <lb/> which brought back the
      forgotten days of Thuggee and made <lb/> them live again; in fact, even made them believable.
      It was <lb/> a case where a young girl had been assassinated for the sake <lb/> of her
      trifling ornaments, things not worth a laborer's day's <lb/> wages in America. This thing
      could have been done in many <lb/> other countries, but hardly with the cold business-like
       <reg orig="deprav-|ity">depravity</reg>, <lb/> absence of fear, absence of caution,
      destitution of the <lb/> sense of horror, repentance, remorse, exhibited in this case. <lb/>
      Elsewhere the murderer would have done his crime secretly, <lb/> by night, and without
      witnesses; his fears would have allowed <lb/> him no peace while the dead body was in his
      neighborhood; <lb/> he would not have rested until he had gotten it safe out of the <lb/> way
      and hidden as effectually as he could hide it. But this <lb/> Indian murderer does his deed in
      the full light of day, cares <lb/> nothing for the society of witnesses, is in no way <reg
       orig="incom-|moded">incommoded</reg>
      <lb/> by the presence of the corpse, takes his own time about <lb/> disposing of it, and the
      whole party are so indifferent, so <lb/> phlegmatic, that they take their regular sleep as if
      nothing <lb/> was happening and no halters hanging over them; and these <lb/> five bland
      people close the episode with a religious service. <lb/> The thing reads like a Meadows-Taylor
      Thug-tale of half a <lb/> century ago, as may be seen by the official report of the trial:</p>

     <p>"At the Mazagon Police Court yesterday, Superintendent Nolan again <lb/> charged Tookaram
      Suntoo Savat Baya, woman, her daughter Krishni, and <lb/> Gopal Vithoo Bhanayker, before Mr.
      Phiroze Hoshang Dastur, Fourth <reg orig="Presi-|dency">Presidency</reg>
      <lb/> Magistrate, under sections 302 and 109 of the Code, with having on the <lb/> night of
      the 30th of December last murdered a Hindoo girl named Cassi, aged <lb/> 12, by strangulation,
      in the room of a chawl at Jakaria Bunder, on the <reg orig="Sewri-|road">Sewriroad</reg>,
      <lb/> and also with aiding and abetting each other in the commission of the <lb/> offense.</p>
     <p>"Mr. F. A. Little, Public Prosecutor, conducted the case on behalf of the <lb/> Crown, the
      accused being undefended.</p>
     <p>"Mr. Little applied under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code <lb/> to tender
      pardon to one of the accused, Krishni, woman, aged 22, on her <lb/> undertaking to make a true
      and full statement of facts under which the <lb/> deceased girl Cassi was murdered.</p>
     <p>"The Magistrate having granted the Public Prosecutor's application, the <lb/> accused
      Krishni went into the witness-box, and, on being examined by Mr. <lb/> Little, made the
      following confession:&mdash;I am a mill-hand employed at the <lb/> Jubilee Mill. I
      recollect the day (Tuesday on which the body of the deceased <lb/> Cassi was found.
      Previous to that I attended the mill for half a day, and <lb/> then returned home at 3 in the
      afternoon, when I saw five persons in the <lb/> house, viz.: the first accused Tookaram, who
      is my paramour, my mother, <lb/> the second accused Baya, the accused Gopal, and two guests
      named Ramji <lb/> Daji and Annaji Gungaram. Tookaram rented the room of the chawl <reg
       orig="situ-|ated">situated</reg>
      <lb/> at Jakaria Bunder-road from its owner, Girdharilal Radhakishan, and in <lb/> that room
      I, my paramour, Tookaram, and his younger brother, Yesso <lb/> Mahadhoo, live. Since his
      arrival in Bombay from his native country Yesso <lb/> came and lived with us. When I returned
      from the mill on the afternoon of <lb/> that day, I saw the two guests seated on a cot in the
      veranda, and a few <lb/> minutes after the accused Gopal came and took his seat by their side,
      while I <lb/> and my mother were seated inside the room. Tookaram, who had gone out <lb/> to
      fetch some <hi rend="italic">pan</hi> and betelnuts, on his return home had brought the two
      <lb/> guests with him. After returning home he gave them <hi rend="italic">pan supari</hi>.
      While <lb/> they were eating it my mother came out of the room and inquired of one <lb/> of
      the guests, Ramji, what had happened to his foot, when he replied that he <lb/> had tried many
      remedies, but they had done him no good. My mother then <lb/> took some rice in her hand and
      prophesied that the disease which Ramji was <lb/> suffering from would not be cured until he
      returned to his native country. <lb/> In the meantime the deceased Cassi came from the
      direction of an out-house, <lb/> and stood in front on the threshhold of our room with a <hi
       rend="italic">lota</hi> in her hand. <lb/> Tookaram then told his two guests to leave the
      room, and they then went up <lb/> the steps towards the quarry. After the guests had gone
      away, Tookaram <lb/> seized the deceased, who had come into the room, and he afterwards put a
      <lb/> waistband around her, and tied her to a post which supports a loft. After <lb/> doing
      this, he pressed the girl's throat, and, having tied her mouth with the <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">dhotur</hi> (now shown in Court), fastened it to the post.
      Having killed the girl, <lb/> Tookaram removed her gold head ornament and a gold <hi
       rend="italic">putlee</hi>, and also took <lb/> charge of her <hi rend="italic">lota</hi>.
      Besides these two ornaments Cassi had on her person ear-</p>
     <pb n="394" entity="DSSR_000002496_0409"/>
     <p>studs, a nose-ring, some silver toe-rings, two necklaces, a pair of silver anklets <lb/> and
      bracelets. Tookaram afterwards tried to remove the silver amulets, the <lb/> ear-studs, and
      the nose-ring; but he failed in his attempt. While he was <lb/> doing so, I, my mother, and
      Gopal were present. After removing the two <lb/> gold ornaments, he handed them over to Gopal,
      who was at the time standing <lb/> near me. When he killed Cassi, Tookaram threatened to
      strangle me also if <lb/> I informed any one of this. Gopal and myself were then standing at
      the <lb/> door of our room, and we both were threatened by Tookaram. My mother, <lb/> Baya,
      had seized the legs of the deceased at the time she was killed, and <lb/> whilst she was being
      tied to the post. Cassi then made a noise. Tookaram <lb/> and my mother took part in killing
      the girl. After the murder her body was <lb/> wrapped up in a mattress and kept on the loft
      over the door of our room. <lb/> When Cassi was strangled, the door of the room was fastened
      from the inside <lb/> by Tookaram. This deed was committed shortly after my return home from
      <lb/> work in the mill. Tookaram put the body of the deceased in the mattress, <lb/> and,
      after it was left on the loft, he went to have his head shaved by a barber <lb/> named Sambhoo
      Raghoo, who lives only one door away from me. My mother <lb/> and myself then remained in the
      possession of the information. I was slapped <lb/> and threatened by my paramour, Tookaram,
      and that was the only reason <lb/> why I did not inform any one at that time. When I told
      Tookaram that I <lb/> would give information of the occurrence, he slapped me. The accused
      Gopal <lb/> was asked by Tookaram to go back to his room, and he did so, taking away <lb/>
      with him the two gold ornaments and the <hi rend="italic">lota</hi>. Yesso Mahadhoo, a <reg
       orig="brother-|in-law">brother-in-law</reg>
      <lb/> of Tookaram, came to the house and asked Tookaram why he was <lb/> washing, the
      water-pipe being just opposite. Tookaram replied that he was <lb/> washing his <hi
       rend="italic">dhotur</hi>, as a fowl had polluted it. About 6 o'clock of the evening <lb/> of
      that day my mother gave me three pice and asked me to buy a cocoanut, <lb/> and I gave the
      money to Yessoo, who went and fetched a cocoanut and some <lb/> betel leaves. When Yessoo and
      others were in the room I was bathing, and, <lb/> after I finished my bath, my mother took the
      cocoanut and the betel leaves <lb/> from Yessoo, and we five went to the sea. The party
      consisted of Tookaram, <lb/> my mother, Yessoo, Tookaram's younger brother, and myself. On
      reaching <lb/> the seashore, my mother made the offering to the sea, and prayed to be <reg
       orig="par-|doned">pardoned</reg>
      <lb/> for what we had done. Before we went to the sea, some one came to <lb/> inquire after
      the girl Cassi. The police and other people came to make these <lb/> inquiries both before and
      after we left the house for the seashore. The police <lb/> questioned my mother about the
      girl, and she replied that Cassi had come to <lb/> her door, but had left. The next day the
      police questioned Tookaram, and <lb/> he, too, gave a similar reply. This was said the same
      night when the search <lb/> was made for the girl. After the offering was made to the sea, we
      partook of <lb/> the cocoanut and returned home, when my mother gave me some food; but <lb/>
      Tookaram did not partake of any food that night. After dinner I and my <lb/> mother slept
      inside the room, and Tookaram slept on a cot near his <reg orig="brother-|in-law"
       >brother-in-law</reg>, <lb/> Yessoo Mahadhoo, just outside the door. That was not the usual
      <lb/> place where Tookaram slept. He usually slept inside the room. The body <lb/> of the
      deceased remained on the loft when I went to sleep. The room in <lb/> which we slept was
      locked, and I heard that my paramour, Tookaram, was</p>
     <pb n="395" entity="DSSR_000002496_0410"/>
     <p>restless outside. About 3 o'clock the following morning Tookaram knocked <lb/> at the door,
      when both myself and my mother opened it. He then told me to <lb/> go to the steps leading to
      the quarry, and see if any one was about. Those <lb/> steps lead to a stable, through which we
      go to the quarry at the back of the <reg orig="com-|pound">compound</reg>. <lb/> When I got to
      the steps I saw no one there. Tookaram asked me if <lb/> any one was there, and I replied that
      I could see no one about. He then took <lb/> the body of the deceased from the loft, and
      having wrapped it up in his <hi rend="italic">saree, </hi>
      <lb/> asked me to accompany him to the steps of the quarry, and I did so. The <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">saree</hi> now produced here was the same. Besides the <hi rend="italic"
       >saree</hi>, there was also a <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">cholee</hi> on the body. He then carried the body in his arms, and went up
      the <lb/> steps, through the stable, and then to the right hand towards a <hi rend="italic"
       >sahib's</hi>
      <reg orig="bunga-|low">bungalow</reg>, <lb/> where Tookaram placed the body near a wall. All
      the time I and my <lb/> mother were with him. When the body was taken down, Yessoo was lying
      <lb/> on the cot. After depositing the body under the wall, we all returned home, <lb/> and
      soon after 5 a. m. the police again came and took Tookaram away. <lb/> About an hour after
      they returned and took me and my mother away. We <lb/> were questioned about it, when I made a
      statement. Two hours later I <lb/> was taken to the room, and I pointed out this waistband,
      the <hi rend="italic">dhotur</hi>, the <reg orig="mat-|tress">mattress</reg>, <lb/> and the
      wooden post to Superintendent Nolan and Inspectors Roberts <lb/> and Rashanali, in the
      presence of my mother and Tookaram. Tookaram <lb/> killed the girl Cassi for her ornaments,
      which he wanted for the girl to whom <lb/> he was shortly going to be married. The body was
      found in the same place <lb/> where it was deposited by Tookaram."</p>
     <p>The criminal side of the native has always been picturesque, <lb/> always readable. The
      Thuggee and one or two other <reg orig="particu-|larly">particularly</reg>
      <lb/> outrageous features of it have been suppressed by the <lb/> English, but there is enough
      of it left to keep it darkly <reg orig="inter-|esting">interesting</reg>. <lb/> One finds
      evidence of these survivals in the <reg orig="news-|papers">newspapers</reg>. <lb/> Macaulay
      has a light-throwing passage upon this <lb/> matter in his great historical sketch of Warren
      Hastings, <lb/> where he is describing some effects which followed the <reg orig="tem-|porary"
       >temporary</reg>
      <lb/> paralysis of Hastings' powerful government brought <lb/> about by Sir Philip Francis and
      his party:</p>
     <p>"The natives considered Hastings as a fallen man; and they acted after <lb/> their kind.
      Some of our readers may have seen, in India, a cloud of crows <lb/> pecking a sick vulture to
      death&mdash;no bad type of what happens in that country <lb/> as often as fortune deserts
      one who has been great and dreaded. In an instant <lb/> all the sycophants, who had lately
      been ready to lie for him, to forge for him, <lb/> to pander for him, to poison for him,
      hasten to purchase the favor of his <lb/> victorious enemies by accusing him. An Indian
      government has only to let <lb/> it be understood that it wishes a particular man to be
      ruined, and in <reg orig="twenty-|four">twenty-four</reg>
      <lb/> hours it will be furnished with grave charges, supported by depositions <lb/> so full
      and circumstantial that any person unaccustomed to Asiatic mendacity</p>
     <pb n="396" entity="DSSR_000002496_0411"/>
     <p>would regard them as decisive. It is well if the signature of the destined <lb/> victim is
      not counterfeited at the foot of some illegal compact, and if some <lb/> treasonable paper is
      not slipped into a hiding-place in his house."</p>
     <p>That was nearly a century and a quarter ago. An article <lb/> in one of the chief journals
      of India (the <hi rend="italic">Pioneer</hi>) shows that <lb/> in some
      respects the native of to-day is just what his ancestor <lb/> was then. Here are niceties of
      so subtle and delicate a sort <lb/> that they lift their breed of rascality to a place among
      the fine <lb/> arts, and almost entitle it to respect:</p>
     <p>"The records of the Indian courts might certainly be relied upon to prove <lb/> that
      swindlers as a class in the East come very close to, if they do not surpass, <lb/> in
      brilliancy of execution and originality of design the most expert of their <lb/> fraternity in
      Europe and America. India in especial is the home of forgery. <lb/> There are some particular
      districts which are noted as marts for the finest <lb/> specimens of the forger's handiwork.
      The business is carried on by firms <lb/> who possess <hi rend="italic">stores of stamped
       papers to suit every emergency.</hi> They habitually <lb/> lay in a store of fresh stamped
      papers every year, and some of the older and <lb/> more thriving houses can supply documents
       <hi rend="italic">for the past forty years, bearing <lb/> the proper water-mark and
       possessing the genuine appearance of age.</hi> Other <reg orig="dis-|tricts">districts</reg>
      <lb/> have earned notoriety for skilled perjury, a pre-eminence that excites a <lb/>
      respectful admiration when one thinks of <hi rend="italic">the universal prevalence of the
       art, </hi>
      <lb/> and persons desirous of succeeding in false suits are ready to pay handsomely <lb/> to
      avail themselves of the services of these local experts as witnesses."</p>
     <p>Various instances illustrative of the methods of these <lb/> swindlers are given. They
      exhibit deep cunning and total <lb/> depravity on the part of the swindler and his pals, and
      more <lb/> obtuseness on the part of the victim than one would expect to <lb/> find in a
      country where suspicion of your neighbor must surely <lb/> be one of the earliest things
      learned. The favorite subject is the , <lb/> young fool who has just come into a fortune and
      is trying to <lb/> see how poor a use he can put it to. I will quote one example:</p>
     <p>"Sometimes another form of confidence trick is adopted, which is <reg orig="invari-|ably"
       >invariably</reg>
      <lb/> successful. The particular pigeon is spotted, and, his acquaintance <lb/> having been
      made, he is encouraged in every form of vice. When the <reg orig="friend-|ship">friendship</reg>
      <lb/> is thoroughly established, the swindler remarks to the young man that <lb/> he has a
      brother who has asked him to lend him Rs.10,000. The swindler <lb/> says he has the money and
      would lend it; but, as the borrower is his brother, <lb/> he cannot charge interest. So he
      proposes that he should hand the dupe the <lb/> money, and the latter should lend it to the
      swindler's brother, exacting a <lb/> heavy pre-payment of interest which, it is pointed out,
      they may equally</p>
     <pb n="397" entity="DSSR_000002496_0412"/>
     <p>enjoy in dissipation. The dupe sees no objection, and on the appointed day <lb/> receives
      Rs.7,000 from the swindler, which he hands over to the confederate. <lb/> The latter is
      profuse in his thanks, and executes a promissory note for <lb/> Rs.10,000, payable to bearer.
      The swindler allows the scheme to remain <lb/> quiescent for a time, and then suggests that,
      as the money has not been <lb/> repaid and as it would be unpleasant to sue his brother, it
      would be better to <lb/> sell the note in the bazaar. The dupe hands the note over, for the
      money he <lb/> advanced was not his, and, on being informed that it would be necessary to
      <lb/> have his signature on the back so as to render the security negotiable, he <lb/> signs
      without any hesitation. The swindler passes it on to confederates, and <lb/> the latter employ
      a respectable firm of solicitors to ask the dupe if his <reg orig="signa-|ture">signature</reg>
      <lb/> is genuine. He admits it at once, and his fate is sealed. A suit is filed <lb/> by a
      confederate against the dupe, two accomplices being made co-<reg orig="defend-|ants"
       >defendants</reg>. <lb/> They admit their signatures as indorsers, and the one swears he
      bought <lb/> the note for value from the dupe The latter has no defense, for no court <lb/>
      would believe the apparently idle explanation of the manner in which he <lb/> came to endorse
      the note."</p>
     <p>There is only one India! It is the only country that has <lb/> a monopoly of grand and
      imposing specialties. When another <lb/> country has a remarkable thing, it cannot have it all
      to itself <lb/> &mdash;some other country has a duplicate. But India&mdash;that is
      <lb/> different. Its marvels are its own; the patents cannot be <reg orig="in-|fringed"
       >infringed</reg>; <lb/> imitations are not possible. And think of the size of <lb/> them, the
      majesty of them, the weird and outlandish character <lb/> of the most of them!</p>
     <p>There is the Plague, the Black Death: India invented it; <lb/> India is the cradle of that
      mighty birth.</p>
     <p>The Car of Juggernaut was India's invention.</p>
     <p>So was the Suttee; and within the time of men still living <lb/> eight hundred widows
      willingly, and, in fact, rejoicingly, <lb/> burned themselves to death on the bodies of their
      dead <reg orig="hus-|bands">husbands</reg>
      <lb/> in a single year. Eight hundred would do it this year <lb/> if the British government
      would let them.</p>
     <p>Famine is India's specialty. Elsewhere famines are <reg orig="incon-|sequential"
       >inconsequential</reg>
      <lb/> incidents&mdash;in India they are devastating cataclysms; <lb/> in one case they
      annihilate hundreds; in the other, millions.</p>
     <p>India has 2,000,000 gods, and worships them all. In religion <lb/> all other countries are
      paupers; India is the only millionaire.</p>
     <pb n="398" entity="DSSR_000002496_0413"/>
     <p>With her everything is on a giant scale&mdash;even her poverty; <lb/> no other country
      can show anything to compare with it. And <lb/> she has been used to wealth on so vast a scale
      that she has to <lb/> shorten to single words the expressions describing great sums. <lb/> She
      describes 100,000 with one word&mdash;<hi rend="italic">a lakh;</hi> she describes <lb/>
      ten millions with one word&mdash;<hi rend="italic">a crore.</hi></p>
     <p>In the bowels of the granite mountains she has patiently <lb/> carved out dozens of vast
      temples, and made them glorious <lb/> with sculptured colonnades and stately groups of
      statuary, and <lb/> has adorned the eternal walls with noble paintings. She has <lb/> built
      fortresses of such magnitude that the show-strongholds <lb/> of the rest of the world are but
      modest little things by <reg orig="com-|parison">comparison</reg>; <lb/> palaces that are

      <lb/> and beauty of workmanship, and for cost; and one tomb <lb/> which men go around the
      globe to see. It takes eighty nations, <lb/> speaking eighty languages, to people her, and
      they number <lb/> three hundred millions.</p>
     <p>On top of all this she is the mother and home of that <reg orig="won-|der">wonder</reg>
      <lb/> of wonders&mdash;<hi rend="italic">caste</hi>&mdash;and of that mystery of
      mysteries, <lb/> the satanic brotherhood of the Thugs.</p>
     <p>India had the start of the whole world in the beginning of <lb/> things. She had the first
      civilization; she had the first <reg orig="accu-|mulation">accumulation</reg>
      <lb/> of material wealth; she was populous with deep <lb/> thinkers and subtle intellects; she
      had mines, and woods, and <lb/> a fruitful soil. It would seem as if she should have kept the
      <lb/> lead, and should be to-day not the meek dependent of an alien <lb/> master, but mistress
      of the world, and delivering law and <reg orig="com-|mand">command</reg>
      <lb/> to every tribe and nation in it. But, in truth, there was <lb/> never any possibility of
      such supremacy for her. If there had <lb/> been but one India and one language&mdash;but
      there were eighty <lb/> of them! Where there are eighty nations and several <reg
       orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg>
      <lb/> governments, fighting and quarreling must be the common <lb/> business of life; unity of
      purpose and policy are impossible; <lb/>
      <pb n="399" entity="DSSR_000002496_0414"/> out of such elements supremacy in the world cannot
      come. <lb/> Even caste itself could have had the defeating effect of a <lb/> multiplicity of
      tongues, no doubt; for it separates a people <lb/> into layers, and layers, and still other
      layers, that have no <lb/> community of feeling with each other; and in such a <reg
       orig="con-|dition">condition</reg>
      <lb/> of things as that, patriotism can have no healthy <lb/> growth.</p>
     <p>It was the division of the country into so many States and <lb/> nations that made Thuggee
      possible and prosperous. It is <lb/> difficult to realize the situation. But perhaps one may
       <reg orig="approxi-|mate">approximate</reg>
      <lb/> it by imagining the States of our Union peopled by <reg orig="sep-|arate">separate</reg>
      <lb/> nations, speaking separate languages, with guards and <lb/> custom-houses strung along
      all frontiers, plenty of <reg orig="interrup-|tions">interruptions</reg>
      <lb/> for travelers and traders, interpreters able to handle all <lb/> the languages very rare
      or non-existent, and a few wars always <lb/> going on here and there and yonder as a further
       <reg orig="embarrass-|ment">embarrassment</reg>
      <lb/> to commerce and excursioning. It would make <reg orig="inter-|communication"
       >intercommunication</reg>
      <lb/> in a measure ungeneral. India had eighty <lb/> languages, and more custom-houses than
      cats. No clever man <lb/> with the instinct of a highway robber could fail to notice what
      <lb/> a chance for business was here offered. India was full of clever <lb/> men with the
      highwayman instinct, and so, quite naturally, <lb/> the brotherhood of the Thugs came into
      being to meet the <lb/> long-felt want.</p>
     <p>How long ago that was nobody knows&mdash;centuries, it is <lb/> supposed. One of the
      chiefest wonders connected with it was <lb/> the success with which it kept its secret. The
      English trader <lb/> did business in India two hundred years and more before he <lb/> ever
      heard of it; and yet it was assassinating its thousands all <lb/> around him every year, the
      whole time.</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">January</hi> 28. I learned of an <hi rend="italic">official</hi>
      Thug-book the <lb/> other day. I was not aware before that there was such <lb/> a thing. I am
      allowed the temporary use of it. We <lb/> are making preparations for travel. Mainly the
      preparations <lb/> are purchases of bedding. This is to be used in sleeping berths <lb/> in
      the trains; in private houses sometimes; and in nine-tenths <lb/> of the hotels. It is not
      realizable; and yet it is true. It is a <lb/> survival; an apparently unnecessary thing which
      in some <lb/> strange way has outlived the conditions which once made it <lb/> necessary. It
      comes down from a time when the railway and <lb/> the hotel did not exist; when the occasional
      white traveler <lb/> went horseback or by bullock-cart, and stopped over night in the <lb/>
      small dak-bungalow provided at easy distances by the <reg orig="govern-|ment&mdash;a"
       >government&mdash;a</reg>
      <lb/> shelter, merely, and nothing more. He had to carry <lb/> bedding along, or do without.
      The dwellings of the English <lb/> residents are spacious and comfortable and commodiously
       <reg orig="fur-|nished">furnished</reg>, <lb/> and surely it must be an odd sight to see half
      a dozen <lb/> guests come filing into such a place and dumping blankets and <lb/> pillows here

     <p>One buys the bedding, with waterproof hold-all for it at <reg orig="al-|most">almost</reg>

     <p>it seemed as if the whole world was present&mdash;half of it inside, <lb/> the other
      half outside, and both halves, bearing mountainous <lb/> head-loads of bedding and other
      freight, trying simultaneously <lb/> to pass each other, in opposing floods, in one narrow
      door. <lb/> These opposing floods were patient, gentle, long-suffering <reg orig="na-|tives"
       >natives</reg>, <lb/> with whites scattered among them at rare intervals; and <lb/> wherever
      a white man's native servant appeared, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> native <lb/> seemed to have
      put aside his natural gentleness for the time <lb/> and invested himself with the white man's
      privilege of making <lb/> a way for himself by promptly shoving all intervening black <lb/>
      things out of it. In these exhibitions of authority Satan was <lb/> scandalous. He was
      probably a Thug in one of his former <reg orig="in-|carnations">incarnations</reg>.</p>
     <p>Inside the great station, tides upon tides of rainbow-<reg orig="cos-|tumed">costumed</reg>
      <lb/> natives swept along, this way and that, in massed and <lb/> bewildering confusion,
      eager, anxious, belated, distressed; and <lb/> washed up to the long trains and flowed into
      them with their <lb/> packs and bundles, and disappeared, followed at once by the <lb/> next
      wash, the next wave. And here and there, in the midst <lb/> of this hurly-burly, and seemingly
      undisturbed by it, sat great <lb/> groups of natives on the bare stone
      floor,&mdash;young, slender <lb/> brown women, old, gray wrinkled women, little soft
      brown <lb/> babies, old men, young men, boys; all poor people, but all the <lb/> females among
      them, both big and little, bejeweled with cheap <lb/> and showy nose-rings, toe-rings,
      leglets, and armlets, these <lb/> things constituting all their wealth, no doubt. These silent
      <lb/> crowds sat there with their humble bundles and baskets and <lb/> small household gear
      about them, and patiently waited&mdash;for <lb/> what? A train that was to start at some
      time or other during <lb/> the day or night! They hadn't timed themselves well, but <lb/> that
      was no matter&mdash;the thing had been so ordered from on <lb/> high, therefore why
      worry? there was plenty of time, hours</p>
     <pb n="404" entity="DSSR_000002496_0419"/>
     <p>and hours of it, and the thing that was to happen would <reg
       orig="hap-|pen&mdash;there">happen&mdash;there</reg>
      <lb/> was no hurrying it.</p>
     <p>The natives traveled third class, and at marvelously cheap <lb/> rates. They were packed and
      crammed into cars that held <lb/> each about fifty; and it was said that often a Brahmin of
      the <lb/> highest caste was thus brought into personal touch, and <reg orig="conse-|quent"
       >consequent</reg>
      <lb/> defilement, with persons of the lowest castes&mdash;no doubt <lb/> a very shocking
      thing if a body could understand it and prop <lb/> erly appreciate it. Yes, a Brahmin who
      didn't own a rupee <lb/> and couldn't borrow one, might have to touch elbows with a <lb/> rich
      hereditary lord of inferior caste, inheritor of an ancient <lb/> title a couple of yards long,
      and he would just have to stand <lb/> it; for if either of the two was allowed to go in the
      cars <lb/> where the sacred white people were, it probably wouldn't be <lb/> the august poor
      Brahmin. There was an immense string of <lb/> those third-class cars, for the natives travel
      by hordes; and a <lb/> weary hard night of it the occupants would have, no doubt.</p>
     <p>When we reached our car, Satan and Barney had already <lb/> arrived there with their train
      of porters carrying bedding and <lb/> parasols and cigar boxes, and were at work. We named him
      <lb/> Barney for short; we couldn't use his real name, there wasn't <lb/> time.</p>
     <p>It was a car that promised comfort; indeed, luxury. Yet <lb/> the cost of
      it&mdash;well, economy could no further go; even in <lb/> France; not even in Italy. It
      was built of the plainest and <lb/> cheapest partially-smoothed boards, with a coating of dull
      <lb/> paint on them, and there was nowhere a thought of decoration. <lb/> The floor was bare,
      but would not long remain so when the <lb/> dust should begin to fly. Across one end of the
      compartment <lb/> ran a netting for the accommodation of hand-baggage; at the <lb/> other end
      was a door which would shut, upon compulsion, but <lb/> wouldn't stay shut; it opened into a
      narrow little closet which <lb/> had a wash-bowl in one end of it, and a place to put a towel,</p>
     <pb n="405" entity="DSSR_000002496_0420"/>
     <p>in case you had one with you&mdash;and you would be sure to <lb/> have towels, because
      you buy them with the bedding, knowing <lb/> that the railway doesn't furnish them. On each
      side of the <lb/> car, and running fore and aft, was a broad leather-covered sofa <lb/>
      &mdash;to sit on in the day and sleep on at night. Over each sofa <lb/> hung, by straps,
      a wide, flat, leather-covered shelf&mdash;to sleep <lb/> on. In the daytime you can hitch
      it up against the wall, out <lb/> of the way&mdash;and then you have a big unencumbered
      and most <lb/> comfortable room to spread out in. No car in any country is <lb/> quite its
      equal for comfort (and privacy) I think. For usually <lb/> there are but two
      persons in it; and even when there are four <lb/> there is but little sense of impaired
      privacy. Our own cars at <lb/> home can surpass the railway world in all details but that one:
      <lb/> they have no cosiness; there are too many people together.</p>
     <p>At the foot of each sofa was a side-door, for entrance and <lb/> exit.</p>
     <p>Along the whole length of the sofa on each side of the car <lb/> ran a row of large
      single-plate windows, of a blue tint&mdash;blue <lb/> to soften the bitter glare of the
      sun and protect one's eyes <lb/> from torture. These could be let down out of the way when
      <lb/> one wanted the breeze. In the roof were two oil lamps which <lb/> gave a light strong
      enough to read by; each had a green-cloth <lb/> attachment by which it could be covered when
      the light <lb/> should be no longer needed.</p>
     <p>While we talked outside with friends, Barney and Satan <lb/> placed the hand-baggage, books,
      fruits, and soda-bottles in the <lb/> racks, and the hold-alls and heavy baggage in the
      closet, hung <lb/> the overcoats and sun-helmets and towels on the hooks, hoisted <lb/> the
      two bed-shelves up out of the way, then shouldered their <lb/> bedding and retired to the
      third class.</p>
     <p>Now then, you see what a handsome, spacious, light, airy, <lb/> homelike place it was,
      wherein to walk up and down, or sit <lb/> and write, or stretch out and read and smoke. A
      central</p>
     <pb n="406" entity="DSSR_000002496_0421"/>
     <p>door in the forward end of the compartment opened into a <lb/> similar compartment. It was
      occupied by my wife and <lb/> daughter. About nine in the evening, while we halted a <lb/>
      while at a station, Barney and Satan came and undid the <lb/> clumsy big hold-alls, and spread
      the bedding on the sofas in <lb/> both compartments&mdash;mattresses, sheets, gay
      coverlets, pillows, <lb/> all complete; there are no chambermaids in <reg
       orig="India&mdash;appar-|ently">India&mdash;apparently</reg>
      <lb/> it was an office that was never heard of. Then they <lb/> closed the communicating door,
      nimbly tidied up our place, <lb/> put the night-clothing on the beds and the slippers under
      <lb/> them, then returned to their own quarters.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">January 31</hi>. It was novel and pleasant, and I stayed <lb/> awake as
      long as I could, to enjoy it, and to read about those <lb/> strange people the Thugs. In my

     <p><hi rend="italic">Baroda.</hi> Arrived at 7 this morning. The dawn was just <lb/> beginning
      to show. It was forlorn to have to turn out in a <lb/> strange place at such a time, and the
      blinking lights in the <lb/> station made it seem night still. But the gentlemen who had <lb/>
      come to receive us were there with their servants, and they <lb/> make quick work; there was
      no lost time. We were soon <reg orig="out-|side">outside</reg>
      <lb/> and moving swiftly through the soft gray light, and <lb/> presently were comfortably
      housed&mdash;with more servants to <lb/> help than we were used to, and with rather
      embarassingly <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg>
      <lb/> officials to direct them. But it was custom; they <lb/> spoke Ballarat English, their
      bearing was charming and <reg orig="hospit-|able">hospitable</reg>, <lb/> and so all went
      well.</p>
     <p>Breakfast was a satisfaction. Across the lawns was visible <lb/> in the distance through the
      open window an Indian well, with <lb/> two oxen tramping leisurely up and down long inclines,
       <reg orig="draw-|ing">drawing</reg>
      <lb/> water; and out of the stillness came the suffering screech <lb/> of the
      machinery&mdash;not quite musical, and yet soothingly <lb/> melancholy and dreamy and
      reposeful&mdash;a wail of lost spirits, <lb/> one might imagine. And commemorative and
      reminiscent, <lb/> perhaps; for of course the Thugs used to throw people down <lb/> that well
      when they were done with them.</p>
     <p>After breakfast the day began, a sufficiently busy one. <lb/> We were driven by winding
      roads through a vast park, with <lb/> noble forests of great trees, and with tangles and
      jungles of <lb/> lovely growths of a humbler sort; and at one place three large <lb/> gray
      apes came out and pranced across the road&mdash;a good deal <lb/> of a surprise and an
      unpleasant one, for such creatures belong <lb/> in the menagerie, and they look artificial and
      out of place in <lb/> a wilderness.</p>
     <p>We came to the city, by and by, and drove all through it. <lb/> Intensely Indian, it was,
      and crumbly, and mouldering, and <lb/> immemorially old, to all appearance. And the
      houses&mdash;oh, <lb/> indescribably quaint and curious they were, with their fronts <lb/>
      <pb n="408" entity="DSSR_000002496_0423"/> an elaborate lace-work of intricate and beautiful
      wood-carving, <lb/> and now and then further adorned with rude pictures of <lb/> elephants and
      princes and gods done in shouting colors; and <lb/> all the ground floors along these cramped
      and narrow lanes <lb/> occupied as shops&mdash;shops unbelievably small and impossibly
      <lb/> packed with merchantable rubbish, and with nine-tenths-naked <lb/> natives squatting at
      their work of hammering, pounding, <reg orig="braz-|ing">brazing</reg>, <lb/> soldering,
      sewing, designing, cooking, measuring out <lb/> grain, grinding it, repairing
      idols&mdash;and then the swarm of <lb/> ragged and noisy humanity under the horses' feet
      and <reg orig="every-|where">everywhere</reg>, <lb/> and the pervading reek and fume and
      smell! It was <lb/> all wonderful and delightful.</p>
     <p>Imagine a file of elephants marching through such a crevice <lb/> of a street and scraping
      the paint off both sides of it with their <lb/> hides. How big they must look, and how little
      they must <lb/> make the houses look; and when the elephants are in their <lb/> glittering
      court costume, what a contrast they must make with <lb/> the humble and sordid surroundings.
      And when a mad <lb/> elephant goes raging through, belting right and left with his <lb/>
      trunk, how do these swarms of people get out of the way? <lb/> I suppose it is a thing which
      happens now and then in the mad <lb/> season (for elephants have a mad
      season).</p>
     <p>I wonder how old the town is. There are patches of <reg orig="build-|ing&mdash;massive"
       >building&mdash;massive</reg>
      <lb/> structures, monuments, apparently&mdash;that are so <lb/> battered and worn, and

      with <reg orig="try-|ing">trying</reg>
      <lb/> to remember things they forgot before history began, that <lb/> they give one the
      feeling that they must have been a part of <lb/> original Creation. This is indeed one of the
      oldest of the <lb/> princedoms of India, and has always been celebrated for its <lb/> barbaric
      pomps and splendors, and for the wealth of its <lb/> princes.</p>

      others in the distance <lb/> dissolving away and <lb/> vanishing like the <lb/> creatures of

      always interesting things to look <lb/> at&mdash;and they were velvet-shod by <lb/>
      nature, and made no noise. Indeed, <lb/> there were no noises of any sort in <lb/> this
      paradise. Yes, once there was one, for a moment: a file of <lb/> native convicts passed along
      in charge of an officer, and we <lb/>
      <pb n="411" entity="DSSR_000002496_0426"/> caught the soft clink of their chains. In a retired
      spot, resting <lb/> himself under a tree, was a holy person&mdash;a naked black <lb/>
      fakeer, thin and skinny, and whitey-gray all over with ashes.</p>
     <p>By and by to the elephant stables, and I took a ride; but <lb/> i was by
      request&mdash;I did not ask for it, and didn't want it; <lb/> but I took it, because
      otherwise they would have thought I <lb/> was afraid, which I was. The elephant kneels down,
      by <reg orig="com-|mand&mdash;">command&mdash;"</reg>
      <lb/> one end of him at a time &mdash; and you climb the ladder <lb/> and get into the
      howdah, and then he gets up, one end at a <lb/> time, just as a ship gets up over a wave; and
      after that, as he <lb/> strides monstrously about, his motion is much like a ship's <lb/>
      motion. The mahout bores into the back of his head with a <lb/> great irn prod and you wonder
      at his temerity and at the <lb/> elephant's patience, and you think that perhaps the patience
      <lb/> will not last; but it does, and nothing happens. The mahout <lb/> talks to the elephant
      in a low voice all the time, and the <reg orig="ele-|phant">elephant</reg>
      <lb/> seems to understand it all and to be pleased with it; and <lb/> he obeys every order in
      the most conrented and docile way. <lb/> Among these twenty-five elephants were two which were
      <lb/> larger than any I had ever seen before, and if I had thought I <lb/> could learn to not
      be afraid, I would have taken one of them <lb/> while the police were not looking.</p>
     <p>In the howdah-house there were many howdahs that were <lb/> made of silver, one of gold, and
      of old ivory, and equipped <lb/> with cushions and canoies of rich and costly stuffs. The
      <lb/> wardrobe of the elephants was there, too; vast velvet covers <lb/> stiff and heavy with
      gold embroidery; and bells of silver and <lb/> gold; and ropes of these metals for fastening
      the things on&mdash; <lb/> harness, so to speak; and monster hoops of massive gold for
      <lb/> the elephant to wear on his ankles when he is out in procession <lb/> on business of
      state.</p>
     <p>But we did not see the treasury of crown jewels, and that <lb/> was a disappointment, for in
      mass and richness it ranks only <lb/>
      <pb n="412" entity="DSSR_000002496_0427"/> second in India. By mistake we we taken to see the
      new <reg orig="pal-|ace">palace</reg>
      <lb/> instead, and we used up the last remnant of our spare time <lb/> there. It was a pity,
      too; for the new palace is mixed modern <lb/> American-European, and has not a merit except
      costliness. It <lb/> is wholly foreign to India, and impudent and out of place. <lb/> The
      architect has escaped. This comes of overdoing the <reg orig="sup-|pression">suppression</reg>
      <lb/> of the Thugs; they had their merits. The old palace <lb/> is oriental and charming, and
      in consonance with the country. <lb/> The old palace would still be great if there were
      nothing of it <lb/> but the spacious and lofty hall where the durbars are held. It <lb/> is
      not a good place to lecture in, on account of the echoes, but <lb/> it is a good place to hold
      durbars in and regulate the affairs of <lb/> a kingdom, and that is what it is for. If I had
      it I would have <lb/> a durbar every day, instead of once or twice a year.</p>
     <p>The prince is an educated gentleman. His culture is <reg orig="Euro-|pean">European</reg>.
      <lb/> He has been in Europe five times. People say that <lb/> this is costly amusement for
      him, since in crossing the sea he <lb/> must sometimes be obliged to drink water from vessels
      that <lb/> are more or less public, and thus damage his caste. To get it <lb/> purified again
      he must make pilgrimage to some renowned <lb/> Hindoo temples and contribute a fortune or two
      to them. His <lb/> people are like the other Hindoos, profoundly religious; and <lb/> they
      could not be content with a master who was impure.</p>
     <p>We failed to see the jewels, but we saw the gold cannon and <lb/> the silver
      one&mdash;they seemed to be six-pounders. They were <lb/> not designed for business, but
      for salutes upon rare and <reg orig="partic-|ularly">particularly</reg>
      <lb/> important state occasions. An ancestor of the present <lb/> Gaikwar had the silver one
      made, and a subsequent ancestor <lb/> had the gold one made, in order to outdo him.</p>
     <p>This sort of artillery is in keeping with the traditions of <lb/> Baroda, which was of old
      famous for style and show. It used <lb/> to entertain visiting rajahs and viceroys with
      tiger-fights, ele-</p>
     <pb n="413" entity="DSSR_000002496_0428"/>
     <p>phant-fights, illuminations, and elephant-processions of the <lb/> most glittering and
      gorgeous character.</p>
     <p>It makes the circus a pale, poor thing.</p>

      <p>A PRIZE WINNER.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>In the train, during a part of the return journey from <lb/> Baroda, we had the company of a
      gentleman who had with <lb/> him a remarkable looking dog. I had not seen one of its kind
      <lb/> before, as far as I could remember; though of course I might <lb/> have seen one and not
      noticed it, for I am not acquainted with <lb/> dogs, but only with cats. This dog's coat was
      smooth and <lb/> shiny and black, and I think it had tan trimmings around the <lb/> edges of
      the dog, and perhaps underneath. It <lb/> was a long, low dog, with very short, strange <lb/>
      legs&mdash;legs that <lb/> curved inboard, <lb/> something like <lb/> parentheses <lb/>
      turned the <lb/> wrong way (. <lb/> Indeed, it was <lb/> made on the plan of a bench
      for length and lowness. It <lb/> seemed to be satisfied, but I thought the plan poor, and <reg
       orig="struct-|urally">structurally</reg>
      <lb/> weak, on account of the distance between the forward <lb/> supports and those abaft.
      With age the dog's back was likely <lb/> to sag; and it seemed to me that it would have been a
      stronger <lb/> and more practicable dog if it had had some more legs. It <lb/> had not begun
      to sag yet, but the shape of the legs showed <lb/> that the undue weight imposed upon them was
      beginning to <lb/> tell. It had a long nose, and floppy ears that hung down, and <lb/> a
      resigned expression of countenance. I did not like to ask <lb/> what kind of a dog it was, or
      how it came to be deformed, for <lb/> it was plain that the gentleman was very fond of it, and
       <reg orig="natu-|rally">naturally</reg>
      <lb/> he could be sensitive about it. From delicacy I thought <lb/> it best not to seem to
      notice it too much. No doubt a man</p>
     <pb n="414" entity="DSSR_000002496_0429"/>
     <p>with a dog like that feels just as a person does who has a child <lb/> that is out of true.
      The gentleman was not merely fond of <lb/> the dog, he was also proud of it&mdash;just
      the same again, as a <lb/> mother feels about her child when it is an idiot. I could see that
      <lb/> he was proud of it, notwithstanding it was such a long dog and <lb/> looked so resigned
      and pious. It had been all over the world <lb/> with him, and had been pilgriming like that
      for years and <lb/> years. It had traveled 50,000 miles by sea and rail, and had <lb/> ridden
      in front of him on his horse 8,000. It had a silver <lb/> medal from the Geographical Society
      of Great Britain for its <lb/> travels, and I saw it. It had won prizes in dog shows, both in
      <lb/> India and in England&mdash;I saw them. He said its pedigree was <lb/> on record in
      the Kennel Club, and that it was a well-known <lb/> dog. He said a great many people in London
      could recognize <lb/> it the moment they saw it. I did not say anything, but I did <lb/> not
      think it anything strange; I should know that dog again, <lb/> myself, yet I am not careful
      about noticing dogs. He said <lb/> that when he walked along in London, people often stopped
      <lb/> and looked at the dog. Of course I did not say anything, for <lb/> I did not want to
      hurt his feelings, but I could have explained <lb/> to him that if you take a great long low
      dog like that and <lb/> waddle it along the street anywhere in the world and not <lb/> charge
      anything, people will stop and look. He was gratified <lb/> because the dog took prizes. But
      that was nothing; if I were <lb/> built like that I could take prizes myself. I wished I knew
      <lb/> what kind of a dog it was, and what it was for, but I could not <lb/> very well ask, for
      that would show that I did not know. Not <lb/> that I want a dog like that, but only to know
      the secret of its <lb/> birth.</p>
     <p>I think he was going to hunt elephants with it, because I <lb/> know, from remarks dropped
      by him, that he has hunted large <lb/> game in India and Africa, and likes it. But I think
      that if he <lb/> tries to hunt elephants with it, he is going to be disappointed.</p>
     <pb n="415" entity="DSSR_000002496_0430"/>
     <p>I do not believe that it is suited for elephants. It lacks energy, <lb/> it lacks force of
      character, it lacks bitterness. These things all <lb/> show in the meekness and resignation of
      its expression. It <lb/> would not attack an elephant, I am sure of it. It might not <lb/> run
      if it saw one coming, but it looked to me like a dog that <lb/> would sit down and pray.</p>
     <p>I wish he had told me what breed it was, if there are <lb/> others; but I shall know the dog
      next time, and then if I can <lb/> bring myself to it I will put delicacy aside and ask. If I
      seem <lb/> strangely interested in dogs, I have a reason for it; for a dog <lb/> saved me from
      an embarrassing position once, and that has <lb/> made me grateful to these animals; and if by
      study I could <lb/> learn to tell some of the kinds from the others, I should be <lb/> greatly
      pleased. I only know one kind apart, yet, and that is <lb/> the kind that saved me that time.
      I always know that kind <lb/> when I meet it, and if it is hungry or lost I take care of it.
      <lb/> The matter happened in this way:</p>
     <p>It was years and years ago. I had received a note from <lb/> Mr. Augustin Daly of the Fifth
      Avenue Theatre, asking me to <lb/> call the next time I should be in New York. I was writing
      <lb/> plays, in those days, and he was admiring them and trying to <lb/> get me a chance to
      get them played in Siberia. I took the first <lb/> train&mdash;the early
      one&mdash;the one that leaves Hartford at 8.29 in <lb/> the morning. At New Haven I
      bought a paper, and found it <lb/> filled with glaring display-lines about a "bench-show"
      there. <lb/> I had often heard of bench-shows, but had never felt any <reg orig="inter-|est"
       >interest</reg>
      <lb/> in them, because I supposed they were lectures that were <lb/> not well attended. It
      turned out, now, that it was not that, <lb/> but a dog-show. There was a double-leaded column
      about the <lb/> king-feature of this one, which was called a Saint Bernard, and <lb/> was
      worth $10,000, and was known to be the largest and finest <lb/> of his species in the world. I
      read all this with interest, <lb/> because out of my school-boy readings I dimly remembered</p>
     <pb n="416" entity="DSSR_000002496_0431"/>
     <p>how the priests and pilgrims of St. Bernard used to go out in <lb/> the storms and dig these
      dogs out of the snowdrifts when lost <lb/> and exhausted, and give them brandy and save their
      lives, and <lb/> drag them to the monastery and restore them with gruel.</p>
     <p>Also, there was a picture of this prize-dog in the paper, a <lb/> noble great creature with
      a benignant countenance, standing by <lb/> a table. He was placed in that way so that one
      could get <lb/> a right idea of his great dimensions. You could see that he <lb/> was just a
      shade higher than the table&mdash;indeed, a huge fellow <lb/> for a dog. Then there was a
      description which went into the <lb/> details. It gave his enormous
      weight&mdash;150&frac12; pounds, and his <lb/> length&mdash;4 feet 2 inches,
      from stem to stern-post; and his <lb/> height&mdash;3 feet 1 inch, to the top of his
      back. The pictures <lb/> and the figures so impressed me, that I could see the beautiful <lb/>
      colossus before me, and I kept on thinking about him for the <lb/> next two hours; then I
      reached New York, and he dropped <lb/> out of my mind.</p>
     <p>In the swirl and tumult of the hotel lobby I ran across Mr. <lb/> Daly's comedian, the late
      James Lewis, of beloved memory, <lb/> and I casually mentioned that I was going to call upon
      Mr. <lb/> Daly in the evening at 8. He looked surprised, and said he <lb/> reckoned not. For
      answer I handed him Mr. Daly's note. <lb/> Its substance was: "Come to my private den, over
      the theater, <lb/> where we cannot be interrupted. And come by the back way, <lb/> not the
      front. No. 642 Sixth Avenue is a cigar shop; pass <lb/> through it and you are in a paved
      court, with high buildings <lb/> all around; enter the second door on the left, and come up
      <lb/> stairs."</p>
     <p>"Is this all?"</p>
     <p>"Yes," I said.</p>
     <p>"Well, you'll never get in."</p>
     <p>"Why?"</p>
     <p>"Because you won't. Or if you do you can draw on me</p>
     <pb entity="DSSR_000002496_0432"/>
     <pb entity="DSSR_000002496_0433"/>
     <figure id="f113" rend="page" entity="DSSR_000002496_0433">
      <p>(Owen Gormlay.)</p>
      <p>"WELL, SOR, WHAT WILL <hi rend="italic">YOU</hi> HAVE?"</p>
     </figure>
     <pb n="419" entity="DSSR_000002496_0434"/>
     <p>for a hundred dollars; for you will be the first man that has <lb/> accomplished it in
      twenty-five years. I can't think what Mr. <lb/> Daly can have been absorbed in. He has
      forgotten a most <lb/> important detail, and he will feel humiliated in the morning <lb/> when
      he finds that you tried to get in and couldn't."</p>
     <p>"Why, what is the trouble?"</p>
     <p>"I'll tell you. You see&mdash;"</p>
     <p>At that point we were swept apart by the crowd, somebody <lb/> detained me with a moment's
      talk, and we did not get together <lb/> again. But it did not matter; I believed he was
      joking, <reg orig="any-|way">anyway</reg>.</p>
     <p>At eight in the evening I passed through the cigar shop and <lb/> into the court and knocked
      at the second door.</p>
     <p>"Come in!"</p>
     <p>I entered. It was a small room, carpetless, dusty, with a <lb/> naked deal table, and two
      cheap wooden chairs for furniture. <lb/> A giant Irishman was standing there, with shirt
      collar and vest <lb/> unbuttoned, and no coat on. I put my hat on the table, and <lb/> was
      about to say something, when the Irishman took the <lb/> innings himself. And not with marked
      courtesy of tone:</p>
     <p>"Well, sor, what will <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have?"</p>
     <p>I was a little disconcerted, and my easy confidence suffered <lb/> a shrinkage. The man
      stood as motionless as Gibraltar, and <lb/> kept his unblinking eye upon me. It was very
      embarrassing, <lb/> very humiliating. I stammered at a false start or two; then&mdash;</p>
     <p>"I have just run down from&mdash;"</p>
     <p>"Av ye plaze, ye'll not smoke here, ye understand."</p>
     <p>I laid my cigar on the window-ledge; chased my flighty <lb/> thoughts a moment, then said in
      a placating manner:&mdash;</p>
     <p>"I&mdash;I have come to see Mr. Daly."</p>
     <p>"Oh, ye <hi rend="italic">have,</hi> have ye?"</p>
     <p>"Yes."</p>
     <pb n="420" entity="DSSR_000002496_0435"/>
     <p>"Well, ye'll not see him."</p>
     <p>"But he <hi rend="italic">asked</hi> me to come."</p>
     <p>"Oh, he <hi rend="italic">did</hi>, did he?"</p>
     <p>"Yes, he sent me this note, and&mdash;"</p>
     <p>"Lemme see it."</p>
     <figure id="f114" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002496_0435">
      <p>"HE HAD IT UPSIDE DOWN."</p>
     </figure>
     <p>For a moment I fancied there would be a change in the <lb/> atmosphere, now; but this idea
      was premature. The big man <lb/> was examining the note <lb/> searchingly under the <reg
       orig="gas-|jet">gas-jet</reg>. <lb/> A glance showed me <lb/> that he had it upside down
      <lb/> &mdash;disheartening evidence <lb/> that he could not read.</p>
     <p>"Is ut his own <reg orig="hand-|write">handwrite</reg>?"</p>
     <p>"Yes&mdash;he wrote it <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>."</p>
     <p>"He did, did he?"</p>
     <p>"Yes."</p>
     <p>"H'm. Well, then, why <lb/> ud he write it like that?"</p>
     <p>"How do you mean?"</p>
     <p>"I mane, why wudn't he put his name to ut?"</p>
     <p>"His name <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to it. <hi rend="italic">That's</hi> not
      it&mdash;you are looking at <hi rend="italic">my </hi>
      <lb/> name."</p>
     <p>I thought that that was a home shot, but he did not betray <lb/> that he had been hit. He
      said:</p>
     <p>"It's not an aisy one to spell; how do you pronounce ut?"</p>
     <p>"Mark Twain."</p>
     <p>"H'm. H'm. Mike Train. H'm. I don't remember ut. <lb/> What is it ye want to see him about?"</p>
     <p>"It isn't I that want to see <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, he wants to see <hi rend="italic"

     <p>"Oh, he does, does he?"</p>
     <pb n="421" entity="DSSR_000002496_0436"/>
     <p>"Yes."</p>
     <p>"What does he want to see ye about?"</p>
     <p>"I don't know."</p>
     <p>"Ye don't <hi rend="italic">know</hi>! And ye confess it, becod! Well, I can <lb/> tell ye
      wan thing&mdash;ye'll not see him. Are ye in the business?"</p>
     <p>"What business?"</p>
     <p>"The show business."</p>
     <p>A fatal question. I recognized that I was defeated. If I <lb/> answered no, he would cut the
      matter short and wave me to <lb/> the door without the grace of a word&mdash;I saw it in
      his <reg orig="uncom-|promising">uncompromising</reg>
      <lb/> eye; if I said I was a lecturer, he would despise me, <lb/> and dismiss me with
      opprobrious words; if I said I was a <lb/> dramatist, he would throw me out of the window. I
      saw that <lb/> my case was hopeless, so I chose the course which seemed <lb/> least
      humiliating: I would pocket my shame and glide out <lb/> without answering. The silence was
      growing lengthy.</p>
     <p>"I'll ask ye again. Are ye in the show business yerself?"</p>
     <p>"Yes!"</p>
     <p>I said it with splendid confidence; for in that moment the <lb/> very twin of that grand New
      Haven dog loafed into the room, <lb/> and I saw that Irishman's eye light eloquently with
      pride and <lb/> affection.</p>
     <p>"Ye are? And what is it?"</p>
     <p>"I've got a bench-show in New Haven."</p>
     <p>The weather <hi rend="italic">did</hi> change then.</p>
     <p>"You don't <hi rend="italic">say</hi>, sir! And that's <hi rend="italic">your</hi> show,
      sir! Oh, it's <lb/> a grand show, it's a wonderful show, sir, and a proud man I <lb/> am to
      see your honor this day. And ye'll be an expert, sir, <lb/> and ye'll know all about
      dogs&mdash;more than ever they know <lb/> theirselves, I'll take me oath to ut."</p>
     <p>I said, with modesty&mdash;</p>
     <p>"I believe I have some reputation that way. In fact, my <lb/> business requires it."</p>
     <pb n="422" entity="DSSR_000002496_0437"/>
     <p>"Ye have <hi rend="italic">some</hi> reputation, your honor! Bedad I believe <lb/> you!
      There's not a jintleman in the worrld that can lay over <lb/> ye in the judgmint of a dog,
      sir. Now I'll vinture that your <lb/> honor'll know that dog's dimensions there better than he
      knows <lb/> them his own self, and just by the casting of your educated eye <lb/> upon him.
      Would you mind giving a guess, if ye'll be so good?"</p>
     <p>I knew that upon my answer would depend my fate. If I <lb/> made this dog bigger than the
      prize-dog, it would be bad <lb/> diplomacy, and suspicious; if I fell too far short of the
       <reg orig="prize-|dog">prize-dog</reg>, <lb/> that would be equally damaging. The dog was
      standing <lb/> by the table, and I believed I knew the difference between him <lb/> and the
      one whose picture I had seen in the newspaper to a <lb/> shade. I spoke promptly up and
      said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"It's no trouble to guess this noble creature's figures: <lb/> height, three feet; length,
      four feet and three-quarters of an <lb/> inch; weight, a hundred and forty-eight and a
      quarter." </p>
     <p>The man snatched his hat from its peg and danced on it <lb/> with joy, shouting:&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Ye've hardly missed it the hair's breadth, hardly the shade <lb/> of a shade, your honor!
      Oh, it's the miraculous eye ye've got, <lb/> for the judgmint of a dog!"</p>
     <p>And still pouring out his admiration of my capacities, he <lb/> snatched off his vest and
      scoured off one of the wooden chairs <lb/> with it, and scrubbed it and polished it, and
      said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"There, sit down, your honor, I'm ashamed of meself that I <lb/> forgot ye were standing all
      this time; and do put on your hat, <lb/> ye mustn't take cold, it's a drafty place; and here
      is your <lb/> cigar, sir, a getting cold, I'll give ye a light. There. The <lb/> place is all
      yours, sir, and if ye'll just put your feet on the <lb/> table and make yourself at home, I'll
      stir around and get a <lb/> candle and light ye up the ould crazy stairs and see that ye <lb/>
      don't come to anny harm, for be this time Mr. Daly'll be that <lb/> impatient to see your

      <hi rend="italic">the Train</hi>. Fifty years ago, when I was a boy in the <lb/> then remote
      and sparsely peopled Mississippi valley, <lb/> vague tales and rumors of a mysterious body of
       <reg orig="pro-|fessional">professional</reg>
      <lb/> murderers came wandering in from a country which <lb/> was constructively as far from us
      as the constellations blinking <lb/> in space&mdash;India; vague tales and rumors of a
      sect called <lb/> Thugs, who way laid travelers in lonely places and killed them <lb/> for the
      contentment of a god whom they worshiped; tales <lb/> which everybody liked to listen to and
      nobody believed&mdash; <lb/> except with reservations. It was considered that the stories
      <lb/> had gathered bulk on their travels. The matter died down <lb/> and a lull followed. Then
      Eugene Sue's "Wandering Jew" <lb/> appeared, and made great talk for a while. One character in
      <lb/> it was a chief of Thugs&mdash;"Feringhea"&mdash;a mysterious and <lb/>
      terrible Indian who was as slippery and sly as a serpent, and <lb/> as deadly; and he stirred
      up the Thug interest once more. But <lb/> it did not last. It presently died
      again&mdash;this time to stay dead.</p>
     <p>At first glance it seems strange that this should have <lb/> happened; but really it was not
      strange&mdash;on the contrary, it <lb/> was natural; I mean on our side of the water. For
      the source <lb/> whence the Thug tales mainly came was a Government Report, <lb/> and without
      doubt was not republished in America; it was <lb/> probably never even seen there. Government
      Reports have <lb/> no general circulation. They are distributed to the few, and <lb/> are not
      always read by those few. I heard of this Report for</p>
     <pb n="427" entity="DSSR_000002496_0442"/>
     <p>the first time a day or two ago, and borrowed it. It is full of <lb/> fascinations; and it
      turns those dim, dark fairy tales of my <lb/> boyhood days into realities.</p>
     <p>The Report was made in 1839 by Major Sleeman, of the <lb/> Indian Service, and was printed
      in Calcutta in 1840. It is a <lb/> clumsy, great, fat, poor sample of the printer's art, but
      good <lb/> enough for a government printing-office in that old day and in <lb/> that remote
      region, perhaps. To Major Sleeman was given <lb/> the general superintendence of the giant
      task of ridding India <lb/> of Thuggee, and he and his seventeen assistants accomplished <lb/>
      it. It was the Augean Stables over again. Captain Vallancey, <lb/> writing in a Madras journal
      in those old times, makes this <lb/> remark:</p>
     <p>"The day that sees this far-spread evil eradicated from India and known only in name, will
      greatly tend to immortalize British rule in the East."</p>
     <p>He did not overestimate the magnitude and difficulty of <lb/> the work, nor the immensity of
      the credit which would justly <lb/> be due to British rule in case it was accomplished.</p>
     <p>Thuggee became known to the British authorities in India <lb/> about 1810, but its wide
      prevalence was not suspected; it was <lb/> not regarded as a serious matter, and no systematic
      measures <lb/> were taken for its suppression until about 1830. About that <lb/> time Major
      Sleeman captured Eugene Sue's Thug-chief, <lb/> "Feringhea," and got him to turn King's
      evidence. The <lb/> revelations were so stupefying that Sleeman was not able to <lb/> believe
      them. Sleeman thought he knew every criminal within <lb/> his jurisdiction, and that the worst
      of them were merely <lb/> thieves; but Feringhea told him that he was in reality living <lb/>
      in the midst of a swarm of professional murderers; that they <lb/> had been all about him for
      many years, and that they buried <lb/> their dead close by. These seemed insane tales; but
      Feringhea <lb/> said come and see&mdash;and he took him to a grave and dug up a <lb/>
      hundred bodies, and told him all the circumstances of the</p>
     <pb n="428" entity="DSSR_000002496_0443"/>
     <p>killings, and named the Thugs who had done the work. It <lb/> was a staggering business.
      Sleeman captured some of these <lb/> Thugs and proceeded to examine them separately, and with
      <lb/> proper precautions against collusion; for he would not believe <lb/> any Indian's
      unsupported word. The evidence gathered proved <lb/> the truth of what Feringhea had said, and
      also revealed the <lb/> fact that gangs of Thugs were plying their trade all over <lb/> India.
      The astonished government now took hold of Thuggee, <lb/> and for ten years made systematic
      and relentless war upon it, <lb/> and finally destroyed it. Gang after gang was captured,
      tried, <lb/> and punished. The Thugs were harried and hunted from one <lb/> end of India to
      the other. The government got all their <lb/> secrets out of them; and also got the names of
      the members <lb/> of the bands, and recorded them in a book, together with <lb/> their
      birthplaces and places of residence.</p>
     <p>The Thugs were worshipers of Bhowanee; and to this god <lb/> they sacrificed anybody that
      came handy; but they kept the <lb/> dead man's things themselves, for the god cared for
      nothing <lb/> but the corpse. Men were initiated into the sect with solemn <lb/> ceremonies.
      Then they were taught how to strangle a person <lb/> with the sacred choke-cloth, but were not
      allowed to perform <lb/> officially with it until after long practice. No half-educated <lb/>
      strangler could choke a man to death quickly enough to keep <lb/> him from uttering a
      sound&mdash;a muffled scream, gurgle, gasp, <lb/> moan, or something of the sort; but the
      expert's work was <lb/> instantaneous: the cloth was whipped around the victim's neck, <lb/>
      there was a sudden twist, and the head fell silently forward, <lb/> the eyes starting from the
      sockets; and all was over. The <lb/> Thug carefully guarded against resistance. It was usual
      to <lb/> to get the victims to sit down, for that was the handiest <lb/> position for
      business.</p>
     <p>If the Thug had planned India itself it could not have been <lb/> more conveniently arranged
      for the needs of his occupation.</p>
     <pb n="429" entity="DSSR_000002496_0444"/>
     <p>There were no public conveyances. There were no conveyances <lb/> for hire. The traveler
      went on foot or in a bullock cart or on a <lb/> horse which he bought for the purpose. As soon
      as he was out <lb/> of his own little State or principality he was among strangers; <lb/>
      nobody knew him, nobody took note of him, and from that time <lb/> his movements could no
      longer be traced. He did not stop in <lb/> towns or villages, but camped outside of them and
      sent his <reg orig="ser-|vants">servants</reg>
      <lb/> in to buy provisions. There were no habitations between <lb/> villages. Whenever he was
      between villages he was an easy prey, <lb/> particularly as he usually traveled by night, to
      avoid the heat. <lb/> He was always being overtaken by strangers who offered him <lb/> the
      protection of their company, or asked for the protection of <lb/> his&mdash;and these
      strangers were often Thugs, as he presently <lb/> found out to his cost. The landholders, the
      native police, the <lb/> petty princes, the village officials, the customs officers were in
      <lb/> many cases protectors and harborers of the Thugs, and <lb/> betrayed travelers to them
      for a share of the spoil. At first <lb/> this condition of things made it next to impossible
      for the <lb/> government to catch the marauders; they were spirited away <lb/> by these
      watchful friends. All through a vast continent, thus <lb/> infested, helpless people of every
      caste and kind moved along <lb/> the paths and trails in couples and groups silently by night,
      <lb/> carrying the commerce of the country&mdash;treasure, jewels, <lb/> money, and petty
      batches of silks, spices, and all manner of <lb/> wares. It was a paradise for the Thug.</p>
     <p>When the autumn opened, the Thugs began to gather <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg>
      <lb/> by pre-concert. Other people had to have interpreters <lb/> at every turn, but not the
      Thugs; <hi rend="italic">they</hi> could talk together, <lb/> no matter how far apart they
      were born, for they had a <lb/> language of their own, and they had secret signs by which
      <lb/> they knew each other for Thugs; and they were always friends. <lb/> Even their
      diversities of religion and caste were sunk in <lb/> devotion to their calling, and the Moslem
      and the high-caste <lb/>
      <pb n="430" entity="DSSR_000002496_0445"/> and low-caste Hindoo were staunch and affectionate
      brothers <lb/> in Thuggery.</p>
     <p>When a gang had been assembled, they had religious <lb/> workship, and waited for an omen.
      They had definite notions <lb/> about the omens. The cries of certain animals were good <lb/>
      omens, the cries of certain other creatures were bad omens. A <lb/> bad omen would stop
      proceedings and send the men home.</p>
     <p>The sword and the strangling-cloth were sacred emblems. <lb/> The Thugs worshiped the sword
      at home before going out to <lb/> the assembling-place; the strangling-cloth was worshiped at
      <lb/> the place of assembly. The chiefs of most of the bands <reg orig="per-|formed">performed</reg>
      <lb/> the religious ceremonies themselves; but the <hi rend="italic">Kaets </hi>
      <lb/> delegated them to certain official stranglers (Chaurs). The <lb/>
      rites of the Kaets were so holy that no one but the Chaur was <lb/> allowed to touch the
      vessels and other things used in them.</p>
     <p>Thug methods exhibit a curious mixture of caution and the <lb/> absence of it; cold business
      calculation and sudden, <reg orig="unreflect-|ing">unreflecting</reg>
      <lb/> impulse; but there were two details which were constant, <lb/> and not subject to
      caprice: patient persistence in following up <lb/> the prey, and pitilessness when the time
      came to act.</p>
     <p>Caution was exhibited in the strength of the bands. They <lb/> never felt comfortable and
      confident unless their strength <reg orig="ex-|ceeded">exceeded</reg>
      <lb/> that of any party of travelers they were likely to <lb/> meet by four or fivefold. Yet
      it was never their purpose to <lb/> attack openly, but only when the victims were off their
      guard. <lb/> When they got hold of a party of travelers they often moved <lb/> along in their
      company several days, using all manner of arts <lb/> to win their friendship and get their
      confidence. At last, <lb/> when this was accomplished to their satisfaction, the real <reg
       orig="busi-|ness">business</reg>
      <lb/> began. A few Thugs were privately detached and sent <reg orig="for-|ward">forward</reg>
      <lb/> in the dark to select a good killing-place and <hi rend="italic">dig the graves. </hi>
      <lb/> When the rest reached the spot a halt was called, for a rest or <lb/> a smoke. The
      travelers were invited to sit. By signs, the chief <lb/>
      <pb n="431" entity="DSSR_000002496_0446"/> appointed certain Thugs to sit down in front of the
      travelers as <lb/> if to wait upon them, others to sit down beside them and <lb/> engage them
      in conversation, and certain expert stranglers to <lb/> stand behind the travelers and be
      ready when the signal was <lb/> given. The signal was usually some commonplace remark, <lb/>
      like "Bring the tobacco." Sometimes a considerable wait <lb/> ensued after all the actors were
      in their places&mdash;the chief was <lb/> biding his time, in order to make everything
      sure. Meantime, <lb/> the talk droned on, dim figures moved about in the dull light, <lb/>
      peace and tranquility reigned, the travelers resigned themselves <lb/> to the pleasant
      reposefulness and comfort of the situation, <reg orig="un-|conscious">unconscious</reg>
      <lb/> of the death-angels standing motionless at their <lb/> backs. The time was ripe, now,
      and the signal came: "Bring <lb/> the tobacco." There was a mute swift movement, all in the
      <lb/> same instant the men at each victim's sides seized his hands, <lb/> the man in front
      seized his feet, and pulled, the man at his <lb/> back whipped the cloth around his neck and
      gave it a twist&mdash; <lb/> the head sunk forward, the tragedy was over. The bodies
      <lb/> were stripped and covered up in the graves, the spoil packed <lb/> for transportation,
      then the Thugs gave pious thanks to <lb/> Bhowance, and departed on further holy service.</p>
     <p>The Report shows that the travelers moved in exceedingly <lb/> small groups&mdash;twos,
      threes, fours, as a rule; a party with a <lb/> dozen in it was rare. The Thugs themselves seem
      to have been <lb/> the only people who moved in force. They went about in <lb/> gangs of 10,
      15, 25, 40, 60, 100, 150, 200, 250, and one gang of <lb/> 310 is mentioned. Considering their
      numbers, their catch was <lb/> not extraordinary&mdash;particularly when you consider
      that they <lb/> were not in the least fastidious, but took anybody they could <lb/> get,
      whether rich or poor, and sometimes even killed children. <lb/> Now and then they killed
      women, but it was considered <lb/> sinful to do it, and unlucky. The "season" was six or eight
      <lb/> months long. One season the half dozen Bundelkand and <lb/>
      <pb n="432" entity="DSSR_000002496_0447"/> Gwalior gangs aggregated 712 men, and they murdered
      210 <lb/> people. One season the Malwa and Kandeish gangs <reg orig="aggre-|gated">aggregated</reg>
      <lb/> 702 men, and they murdered 232. One season the <reg orig="Kan-|deish">Kandeish</reg>
      <lb/> and Berar gangs aggregated 963 men, and they murdered <lb/> 385 people.</p>
     <p>Here is the tally-sheet of a gang of <hi rend="italic">sixty</hi> Thugs for a whole <lb/>
      season&mdash;gang under two noted chiefs, "Chotee and Sheik <reg orig="Nun-|goo">Nungoo</reg>
      <lb/> from Gwalior":</p>
     <p>"Left Poora, in Jhansee, and on arrival at Sarora murdered a traveler.</p>
     <p>"On nearly reaching Bhopal, met 3 Brahmins, and murdered them.</p>
     <p>"Cross the Nerbudda; at a village called Hutteea, murdered a Hindoo.</p>
     <p>"Went through Aurungabad to Walagow; there met a Havildar of the <lb/> barber caste and 5
      sepoys (native soldiers); in the evening came to Jokur, and <lb/> in the
      morning killed them near the place where the treasure-bearers were <lb/> killed the year
      before.</p>
     <p>"Between Jokur and Dholeea met a sepoy of the shepherd caste; killed <lb/> him in the
      jungle.</p>
     <p>"Passed through Dholeea and lodged in a village; two miles beyond, on <lb/> the road to
      Indore, met a Byragee (beggar&mdash;holy mendicant); murdered him <lb/>
      at the Thapa.</p>
     <p>"In the morning, beyond the Thapa, fell in with 3 Marwarie travelers; <lb/> murdered them.</p>
     <p>"Near a village on the banks of the Taptee met 4 travelers and killed <lb/> them.</p>
     <p>"Between Choupra and Dhoreea met a Marwarie; murdered him.</p>
     <p>"At Dhoreea met 3 Marwaries; took them two miles and murdered <lb/> them.</p>
     <p>Two miles further on, overtaken by three treasure-bearers; took them <lb/> two miles and
      murdered them in the jungle.</p>
     <p>"Came on to Khurgore Bateesa in Indore, divided spoil, and dispersed.</p>
     <p>"A total of 27 men murdered on one expedition."</p>
     <p>Chotee (to save his neck) was informer, and furnished these <lb/> facts.
      Several things are noticeable about his resume. 1. <lb/> Business brevity; 2, absence of
      emotion; 3, smallness of the <lb/> parties encountered by the 60; 4, variety in character and
      <lb/> quality of the game captured; 5, Hindoo and Mohammedan <lb/> chiefs in business together
      for Bhowanee; 6, the sacred caste <lb/> of the Brahmins not respected by either; 7, nor yet
      the <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg>
      <lb/> of that mendicant, that Byragee.</p>
     <pb n="433" entity="DSSR_000002496_0448"/>
     <p>A beggar is a holy creature, and some of the gangs spared <lb/> him on that account, no
      matter how slack business might be; <lb/> but other gangs slaughtered not only him, but even
      that <lb/> sacredest of sacred creatures, the <hi rend="italic">fakeer</hi>&mdash;that
      repulsive <reg orig="skin-|and-bone">skin-and-bone</reg>
      <lb/> thing that goes around naked and mats his bushy <lb/> hair with dust and dirt, and so
      beflours his lean body with <lb/> ashes that he looks like a specter. Sometimes a fakeer
      trusted <lb/> a shade too far in the protection of his sacredness. In the <lb/> middle of a
      tally-sheet of Feringhea's, who had been out with <lb/> forty Thugs, I find a case of the
      kind. After the killing of <lb/> thirty-nine men and one woman, the fakeer appears on the
      scene:</p>
     <p>"Approaching Doregow, met 3 pundits; also a fakeer, mounted on a <lb/> pony; he was
      plastered over with sugar to collect flies, and was covered with <lb/> them. Drove off the
      fakeer, and killed the other three.</p>
     <p>"Leaving Doregow, the fakeer joined again, and went on in company to <lb/> Raojana; met 6
      Khutries on their way from Bombay to Nagpore. Drove off <lb/> the fakeer with stones, and
      killed the 6 men in camp, and buried them in the <lb/> grove.</p>
     <p>"Next day the fakeer joined again; made him leave at Mana. Beyond <lb/> there, fell in with
      two Kahars and a sepoy, and came on towards the place <lb/> selected for the murder. When near
      it, the fakeer came again. Losing all <lb/> patience with him, gave Mithoo, one of the gang, 5
      rupees ($2.50) to murder <lb/> him, and take the sin upon himself. All four
      were strangled, including the <lb/> fakeer. Surprised to find among the fakeer's effects 30
      pounds of coral, 350 <lb/> strings of small pearls, 15 strings of large pearls, and a gilt
      necklace."</p>
     <p>It it curious, the little effect that time has upon a really <lb/> interesting circumstance.
      This one, so old, so long ago gone <lb/> down into oblivion, reads with the same freshness and
      charm <lb/> that attach to the news in the morning paper; one's spirits go <lb/> up, then
      down, then up again, following the chances which <lb/> the fakeer is running; now you hope,
      now you despair, now <lb/> you hope again; and at last everything comes out right, and <lb/>
      you feel a great wave of personal satisfaction go weltering <lb/> through you, and without
      thinking, you put out your hand to <lb/> pat Mithoo on the back, when&mdash;puff! the
      whole thing has <lb/> vanished away, there is nothing there; Mithoo and all the</p>
     <pb n="434" entity="DSSR_000002496_0449"/>
     <p>crowd have been dust and ashes and forgotten, oh, so many, <lb/> many, <hi rend="italic"
       >many</hi> lagging years! And then comes a sense of <lb/> injury: you don't know whether
      Mithoo got the swag, along <lb/> with the sin, or had to divide up the swag and keep all the
      sin <lb/> himself. There is no literary art about a government report. <lb/> It stops a story
      right in the most interesting place.</p>
     <p>These reports of Thug expeditions run along interminably <lb/> in one monotonous tune: "Met
      a sepoy&mdash;killed him; met 5 <lb/> pundits&mdash;killed them; met 4 Rajpoots and
      a woman&mdash;killed <lb/> them"&mdash;and so on, till the statistics get to be
      pretty dry. <lb/> But this small trip of Feringhea's Forty had some little variety <lb/> about
      it. Once they came across a man hiding in a <hi rend="italic">grave</hi>&mdash; <lb/> a
      thief; he had stolen 1,100 rupees from Dhunroj Seith of <lb/> Parowtee. They strangled him and
      took the money. They <lb/> had no patience with thieves. They killed two <reg
       orig="treasure-|bearers">treasure-bearers</reg>, <lb/> and got 4,000 rupees. They came across
      two bullocks <lb/> "laden with copper pice," and killed the four drivers and took <lb/> the
      money. There must have been half a ton of it. I think <lb/> it takes a double handful of pice
      to make an anna, and 16 <lb/> annas to make a rupee; and even in those days the rupee was
      <lb/> worth only half a dollar. Coming back over their tracks <lb/> from Baroda, they had
      another picturesque stroke of luck: <lb/> "The Lohars of Oodeypore" put a traveler in their
      charge <lb/> "for safety." Dear, dear, across this abyssmal gulf of time we <lb/> still see
      Feringhea's lips uncover his teeth, and through the <lb/> dim haze we catch the incandescent
      glimmer of his smile. He <lb/> accepted that trust, good man; and so we know what went <lb/>
      with the traveler.</p>
     <p>Even Rajahs had no terrors for Feringhea; he came across <lb/> an elephant-driver belonging
      to the Rajah of Oodeypore and <lb/> promptly strangled him.</p>
     <p>"A total of 100 men and 5 women murdered on this <reg orig="ex-|pedition">expedition</reg>."</p>

     <p>Also a prince's cook; and even the water-carrier of that <lb/> sublime lord of lords and
      king of kings, the Governor-General <lb/> of India! How broad they were in their tastes! They
      also <lb/> murdered actors&mdash;poor wandering barn-stormers. There are <lb/> two
      instances recorded; the first one by a gang of Thugs <lb/> under a chief who soils a great
      name borne by a better man&mdash; <lb/> Kipling's deathless "Gungadin":</p>
     <p>"After murdering 4 sepoys, going on toward Indore, met 4 strolling <lb/> players, and
      persuaded them to come with us, on the pretense that we would <lb/> see their performance at
      the next stage. Murdered them at a temple near <lb/> Bhopal."</p>
     <p>Second instance:</p>
     <p>"At Deohuttee, joined by comedians. Murdered them eastward of that <lb/> place."</p>
     <p>But this gang was a particularly bad crew. On that <reg orig="ex-|pedition">expedition</reg>
      <lb/> they murdered a fakeer and twelve beggars. And <lb/> yet Bhowanee protected them; for
      once when they were <lb/> strangling a man in a wood when a crowd was going by close <lb/> at
      hand and the noose slipped and the man screamed, <reg orig="Bho-|wanee">Bhowanee</reg>
      <lb/> made a camel burst out at the same moment with a <lb/> roar that drowned the scream; and
      before the man could <lb/> repeat it the breath was choked out of his body.</p>
     <p>The cow is so sacred in India that to kill her keeper is an <lb/> awful sacrilege, and even
      the Thugs recognized this; yet now</p>
     <pb n="436" entity="DSSR_000002496_0451"/>
     <p>and then the lust for blood was too strong, and so they did <lb/> kill a few cow-keepers. In
      one of these instances the witness <lb/> who killed the cowherd said, "In Thuggee this is
      strictly <reg orig="for-|bidden">forbidden</reg>, <lb/> and is an act from which no good can
      come. I was <lb/> ill of a fever for ten days afterward. I do believe that evil <lb/> will
      follow the murder of a man with a cow. If there be no <lb/> cow it does not signify." Another
      Thug said he held the <lb/> cowherd's feet while this witness did the strangling. He felt
      <lb/> no concern, "because the bad fortune of such a deed is upon <lb/> the strangler and not
      upon the assistants; even if there should <lb/> be a hundred of them."</p>
     <p>There were thousands of Thugs roving over India <reg orig="con-|stantly">constantly</reg>,
      <lb/> during many generations. They made Thuggee a <lb/> hereditary vocation and taught it to
      their sons and to their <lb/> son's sons. Boys were in full membership as early as 16 years
      <lb/> of age; veterans were still at work at 70. What was the <lb/> fascination, what was the
      impulse? Apparently, it was partly <lb/> piety, largely gain, and there is reason to suspect
      that the <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">sport</hi> afforded was the chiefest fascination of all. Meadows <lb/>
      Taylor makes a Thug in one of his books claim that the <reg orig="pleas-|ure">pleasure</reg>
      <lb/> of killing men was the white man's beast-hunting instinct <lb/> enlarged, refined,
      ennobled. I will quote the passage:</p>
    </div2>
    <div2 type="chapter" n="XLVII" id="d64">
     <pb n="437" entity="DSSR_000002496_0452"/>
     <head>CHAPTER XLVII.</head>
     <argument>
      <p>Simple rules for saving money: To save half, when you are fired by an eager <lb/> impulse
       to contribute to a charity, wait, and count forty. To save three-quarters, <lb/> count sixty.
       To save it all, count sixty-five.<bibl>
        <author>&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.</hi></author>
       </bibl></p>
     </argument>
     <p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> Thug said:</p>
     <p>"How many of you English are passionately devoted to <reg orig="sport-|ing">sporting</reg>!
      <lb/> Your days and months are passed in its excitement. A <lb/> tiger, a panther, a buffalo
      or a hog rouses your utmost energies for <lb/> its destruction&mdash;you even risk your
      lives in its pursuit. How much higher <lb/> game is a Thug's!"</p>
     <p>That must really be the secret of the rise and development <lb/> of Thuggee. The joy of
      killing! the joy of seeing killing <lb/> done&mdash;these are traits of the human race at
      large. We white <lb/> people are merely modified Thugs; Thugs fretting under the <lb/>
      restraints of a not very thick skin of civilization; Thugs <lb/> who long ago enjoyed the
      slaughter of the Roman arena, and <lb/> later the burning of doubtful Christians by authentic
      Christians <lb/> in the public squares, and who now, with the Thugs of Spain <lb/> and Nimes,
      flock to enjoy the blood and misery of the <reg orig="bull-|ring">bullring</reg>. <lb/> We
      have no tourists of either sex or any religion who <lb/> are able to resist the delights of
      the bull-ring when opportunity <lb/> offers; and we are gentle Thugs in the hunting-season,
      and <lb/> love to chase a tame rabbit and kill it. Still, we have made <lb/> some
      progress&mdash;microscopic, and in truth scarcely worth <lb/> mentioning, and certainly
      nothing to be proud of&mdash;still, it is <lb/> progress: we no longer take pleasure in
      slaughtering or <reg orig="burn-|ing">burning</reg>
      <lb/> helpless men. We have reached a little altitude where we <lb/> may look down upon the
      Indian Thugs with a complacent <lb/> shudder; and we may even hope for a day, many centuries
      hence, <lb/> when our posterity will look down upon us in the same way.</p>
     <pb n="438" entity="DSSR_000002496_0453"/>
     <p>There are many indications that the Thug often hunted <lb/> men for the mere sport of it;
      that the fright and pain of the <lb/> quarry were no more to him than are the fright and pain
      of <lb/> the rabbit or the stag to us; and that he was no more ashamed <lb/> of beguiling his
      game with deceits and abusing its trust than <lb/> are we when we have imitated a wild
      animal's call and shot it <lb/> when it honored us with its confidence and came to see what
      <lb/> we wanted:</p>
     <p>"Madara, son of Nihal, and I, Ramzam, set out from Kotdee in the cold <lb/> weather and
      followed the high road for about twenty days in search of <lb/> travelers, until we came to
      Selempore, where we met a very old man going to <lb/> the east. We won his confidence in this
      manner: he carried a load which <lb/> was too heavy for his old age; I said to him, 'You are
      an old man, I will aid <lb/> you in carrying your load, as you are from my part of the
      country.' He <lb/> said, 'Very well, take me with you.' So we took him with us to Selempore,
      <lb/> where we slept that night. We woke him next morning before dawn and set <lb/> out, and
      at the distance of three miles we seated him to rest while it was still <lb/> very dark.
      Madara was ready behind him, and strangled him. He never <lb/> spoke a word. He was about 60
      or 70 years of age."</p>
     <p>Another gang fell in with a couple of barbers and persuaded <lb/> them to come along in
      their company by promising them the <lb/> job of shaving the whole crew&mdash;30 Thugs.
      At the place <reg orig="ap-|pointed">appointed</reg>
      <lb/> for the murder 15 got shaved, and actually paid the <lb/> barbers for their work. Then
      killed them and took back the <lb/> money.</p>
     <p>A gang of forty-two Thugs came across two Brahmins and <lb/> a shopkeeper on the road,
      beguiled them into a grove and got <lb/> up a <hi rend="italic">concert</hi> for their
      entertainment. While these poor fellows <lb/> were listening to the music the stranglers were
      standing behind <lb/> them; and at the proper moment for dramatic effect they <lb/> applied
      the noose.</p>
     <p>The most devoted fisherman must have a bite at least as <lb/> often as once a week or his
      passion will cool and he will put <lb/> up his tackle. The tiger-sportsman must find a tiger
      at least <lb/> once a fortnight or he will get tired and quit. The <reg
       orig="elephant-|hunter's">elephant-hunter's</reg>
      <lb/> enthusiasm will waste away little by little, and his</p>
     <pb n="439" entity="DSSR_000002496_0454"/>
     <p>zeal will perish at last if he plod around a month without <reg orig="find-|ing">finding</reg>
      <lb/> a member of that noble family to assassinate.</p>
     <p>But when the lust in the hunter's heart is for the noblest of <lb/> all quarries, man, how
      different is the case! and how watery <lb/> and poor is the zeal and how childish the
      endurance of those <lb/> other hunters by comparison. Then, neither hunger, nor <lb/> thirst,
      nor fatigue, nor deferred hope, nor monotonous <reg orig="disap-|pointment"
      >disappointment</reg>, <lb/> nor leaden-footed lapse of time can conquer the <lb/> hunter's
      patience or weaken the joy of his quest or cool the <lb/> splendid rage of his desire. Of all
      the hunting-passions that <lb/> burn in the breast of man, there is none that can lift him
      <lb/> superior to discouragements like these but the one&mdash;the royal <lb/> sport, the
      supreme sport, whose quarry is his brother. By <lb/> comparison, tiger-hunting is a colorless
      poor thing, for all it <lb/> has been so bragged about.</p>
     <p>Why, the Thug was content to tramp patiently along, <lb/> afoot, in the wasting heat of
      India, week after week, at an <lb/> average of nine or ten miles a day, if he might but hope
      to <lb/> find game some time or other and refresh his longing soul with <lb/> blood. Here is
      an instance:</p>
     <p>"I (Ramzam) and Hyder set out, for the purpose of strangling <lb/>
      travelers, from Guddapore, and proceeded via the Fort of Julalabad, <lb/> Newulgunge,
      Bangermow, on the banks of the Ganges (upwards of 100 <lb/> miles), from
      whence we returned by another route. Still no travelers! till <lb/> we reached Bowaneegunge,
      where we fell in with a traveler, a boatman; we <lb/> inveigled him and about two miles east
      of there Hyder strangled him as he <lb/> stood&mdash;for he was troubled and afraid, and
      would not sit. We then made a <lb/> long journey (about 130 miles) and
      reached Hussunpore Bundwa, where at <lb/> the tank we fell in with a traveler&mdash;he
      slept there that night; next morning <lb/> we followed him and tried to win his confidence; at
      the distance of two miles <lb/> we endeavored to induce him to sit down&mdash;but he
      would not having become <lb/> aware of us. I attempted to strangle him as he walked along, but
      did not <lb/> succeed; both of us then fell upon him, he made a great outery, 'They are <lb/>
      murdering me:' at length we strangled him and flung his body into a well. <lb/> After this we
      returned to our homes, having been out a month and traveled <lb/> about 260 miles. A total of
      two men murdered on the expedition."</p>
     <p>And here is another case&mdash;related by the terrible Futty Khan, <lb/> a man with a
      tremendous record, to be re-mentioned by and by;</p>
     <pb n="440" entity="DSSR_000002496_0455"/>
     <p>"I, with three others, traveled for about 45 days a distance of about 200 <lb/> miles in
      search of victims along the highway to Bundwa and returned by <reg orig="Da-|vodpore"
       >Davodpore</reg>
      <lb/> (another 200 miles) during which journey we had only one murder, <lb/>
      which happened in this manner. Four miles to the cast of Noubustaghat we <lb/> fell in with a
      traveler, an old man. I, with Koshal and Hyder, inveigled him <lb/> and accompanied him that
      day within 3 miles of Rampoor, where, after dark, <lb/> in a lonely place, we got him to sit
      down and rest; and while I kept him in <lb/> talk, seated before him, Hyder behind strangled
      him: he made no resistance. <lb/> Koshal stabbed him under the arms and in the throat, and we
      flung the body <lb/> into a running stream. We got about 4 or 5 rupees each ($2 or
      $2.50). We <lb/> then proceeded homewards. A total of one man murdered on this <reg
       orig="expedi-|tion">expedition</reg>."</p>
     <p>There. They tramped 400 miles, were gone about three <lb/> months, and harvested two dollars
      and a half apiece. But the <lb/> mere pleasure of the hunt was sufficient. That was pay
      enongh. <lb/> They did no grumbling.</p>
     <p>Every now and then in this big book one comes across that <lb/> pathetic remark: "We tried
      to get him to sit down but he <lb/> would not." It tells the whole story. Some accident had
      <lb/> awakened the suspicion in him that these smooth friends who <lb/> had been petting and
      coddling him and making him feel so <lb/> safe and so fortunate after his forlorn and lonely
      wanderings <lb/> were the dreaded Thugs; and now their ghastly invitation to <lb/> "sit and
      rest" had confirmed its truth. He knew there was <lb/> no help for him, and that he was
      looking his last upon earthly <lb/> things, but "he would not sit." No, not that&mdash;it
      was too <lb/> awful to think of!</p>
     <p>There are a number of instances which indicate that when <lb/> a man had once tasted the
      regal joys of man-hunting he could <lb/> not be content with the dull montony of a crimeless
      life after <lb/> ward. Example, from a Thug's testimony:</p>
     <p>"We passed through to Kurnaul, where we found a former Thug named <lb/> Junooa, an old
      comrade of ours, who had turned religious mendicant and <lb/> become a disciple and holy. He
      came to us in the serai and weeping with <lb/> joy returned to his old trade."</p>
     <p>Neither wealth nor honors nor dignities could satisfy a <reg orig="re-|formed">reformed</reg>
      <lb/> Thug for long. He would throw them all away, some <lb/>
      <pb n="441" entity="DSSR_000002496_0456"/> day, and go back to the lurid pleasures of hunting
      men, and <lb/> being hunted himself by the British.</p>
     <p>Ramzam was taken into a great native grandee's service and <lb/> given authority over five
      villages. "My authority extended <lb/> over these people to summons them to my presence, to
      make <lb/> them stand or sit. I dressed well, rode my pony, and had two <lb/> sepoys, a scribe
      and a village guard to attend me. During <lb/> three years I used to pay each village a
      monthly visit, and no <lb/> one suspected that I was a Thug! The chief man used to wait <lb/>
      on me to transact business, and as I passed along, old and <lb/> young made their salaam to
      me."</p>
     <p>And yet during that very three years he got leave of <lb/> absence "to attend a wedding."
      and instead went off on a <lb/> Thugging lark with six other Thugs and hunted the highway
      <lb/> for fifteen days!&mdash;with satisfactory results.</p>
     <p>Afterwards he held a great office under a Rajah. There he <lb/> had ten miles of country
      under his command and a military <lb/> guard of fifteen men, with authority to call out 2,000
      more <lb/> upon occasion. But the British got on his track, and they <lb/> crowded him so that
      he had to give himself up. See what a <lb/> figure he was when he was gotten up for style and
      had all his <lb/> things on: "I was fully armed&mdash;a sword, shield, pistols, a <lb/>
      matchlock musket and a flint gun, for I was fond of being thus <lb/> arrayed, and when so
      armed feared not though forty men <lb/> stood before me."</p>
     <p>He gave himself up and proudly proclaimed himself a Thug. <lb/> Then by request he agreed to
      betray his friend and pal, <lb/> Buhram, a Thug with the most tremendous record in India.
      <lb/> "I went to the house where Buhram slept (often has he led <lb/> our
      gangs!) I woke him, he knew me well, and came outside <lb/> to me. It was a cold
      night, so under pretence of warming <lb/> myself, but in reality to have light for his seizure
      by the guards, <lb/> I lighted some straw and made a blaze. We were warming <lb/>
      <pb n="442" entity="DSSR_000002496_0457"/> our hands. The guards drew around us. I said to
      them, <lb/> "This is Buhram," and he was seized just as a cat seizes a <lb/> mouse. Then
      Buhram said, "I am a Thug! my father was a <lb/> Thug, my grandfather was a Thug, and I have
      thugged with <lb/> many!"</p>
     <p>So spoke the mighty hunter, the mightiest of the mighty, <lb/> the Gordon Cumming of his
      day. Not much regret noticeable <lb/> in it.<ref target="n442.1" n="17">*</ref>
      <note id="n442.1" place="foot" n="17"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg>

       <p>"Having planted a bullet in the shoulder-bone of an elephant, and caused the <lb/>
        agonized creature to lean for support against a tree, I proceeded to brew some coffee. <lb/>
        Having refreshed myself, taking observations of the elephant's spasms and <reg
         orig="writh-|ings">writhings</reg>
        <lb/> between the sips, I resolved to make experiments on vulnerable points, and, <lb/>
        approaching very near, I fired several bullets at different parts of his enormous skull.
        <lb/> He only acknowledged the shots by a salaam-like movement of his trunk, with the <lb/>
        point of which he gently touched the wounds with a striking and peculiar action. <lb/>
        Surprised and shocked to find that I was only prolonging the suffering of the noble <lb/>
        beast, which bore its trials with such dignified composure, I resolved to finish the <lb/>
        proceeding with all possible despatch, and accordingly opened fire upon him from <lb/> the
        left side. Aiming at the shoulder, I fired six shots with the two-grooved rifle, <lb/> which
        must have eventually proved mortal, after which I fired six shots at the same <lb/> part
        with the Dutch six-pounder. Large tears now trickled down from his eyes, <lb/> which he
        slowly shut and opened, his colossal frame shivered convulsively, and <reg orig="fall-|ing"
         >falling</reg>
        <lb/> on his side he expired."&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Gordon Cumming.</hi></p>
      </note>
     </p>
     <p>So many many times this Official Report leaves one's <lb/> curiosity unsatisfied. For
      instance, here is a little paragraph <lb/> out of the record of a certain band of 193 Thugs,
      which has <lb/> that defect:</p>
     <p>"Fell in with Lall Sing Subahdar and his family, consisting of nine <reg orig="per-|sons"
       >persons</reg>. <lb/> Traveled with them two days, and the third put them all to death <lb/>
      except the two children, little boys of one and a half years old."</p>
     <p>There it stops. What did they do with those poor little <lb/> fellows? What was their
      subsequent history? Did they <lb/> purpose training them up as Thugs? How could they take
      <lb/> care of such little creatures on a march which stretched over <lb/> several months? No
      one seems to have cared to ask any <lb/> questions about the babies. But I do wish I knew.</p>
     <p>One would be apt to imagine that the Thugs were utterly <lb/> callous, utterly destitute of
      human feelings, heartless toward</p>
     <pb n="443" entity="DSSR_000002496_0458"/>
     <p>their own families as well as toward other people's; but this <lb/> was not so. Like all
      other Indians, they had a passionate love <lb/> for their kin. A shrewd British officer who
      knew the Indian <lb/> character, took that characteristic into account in laying his <lb/>
      plans for the capture of Eugene Sue's famous Feringhea. He <lb/> found out Feringhea's
      hiding-place, and sent a guard by night <lb/> to seize him, but the squad was awkward and he
      got away. <lb/> However, they got the rest of the family&mdash;the mother, wife, <lb/>
      child, and brother&mdash;and brought them to the officer, at <reg orig="Jubbul-|pore"
       >Jubbulpore</reg>; <lb/> the officer did not fret, but bided his time: "I knew <lb/>
      Feringhea would not go far while links so dear to him were in <lb/> my hands." He was right.
      Feringhea knew all the danger <lb/> he was running by staying in the neighborhood, still he
      could <lb/> not tear himself away. The officer found that he divided his time <lb/> between
      five villages where he had relatives and friends who <lb/> could get news for him from his
      family in Jubbulpore jail; <lb/> and that he never slept two consecutive nights in the same
      <lb/> village. The officer traced out his several haunts, then pounced <lb/> upon all the five
      villages on the one night and at the same <lb/> hour, and got his man.</p>
     <p>Another example of family affection. A little while <lb/> previously to the capture of
      Feringhea's family, the British <lb/> officer had captured Feringhea's foster-brother, leader
      of a <lb/> gang of ten, and had tried the eleven and condemned them to <lb/> be hanged.
      Feringhea's captured family arrived at the jail <lb/> the day before the execution was to take
      place. The <reg orig="foster-|brother">foster-brother</reg>, <lb/> Jhurhoo, entreated to be
      allowed to see the aged <lb/> mother and the others. The prayer was granted, and this is <lb/>
      what took place&mdash;it is the British officer who speaks:</p>
     <p>"In the morning, just before going to the scaffold, the interview took <lb/> place before
      me. He fell at the old woman's feet and begged that she would <lb/> relieve him from the
      obligations of the milk with which she had nourished <lb/> him from infancy, as he was about
      to die before he could fulfill any of them. <lb/> She placed her hands on his head, and he
      knelt, and she said she forgave him <lb/> all, and bid him die like a man."</p>
     <pb n="444" entity="DSSR_000002496_0459"/>
     <p>If a capable artist should make a picture of it, it would be <lb/> full of dignity and
      solemnity and pathos; and it could touch <lb/> you. You would imagine it to be anything but
      what it was. <lb/> There is reverence there, and tenderness, and gratefulness, and <lb/>
      compasion, and resignation, and fortitude, and self-respect&mdash; <lb/> and no sense of
      disgrace, no thought of dishonor. Everything <lb/> is there that goes to make a noble parting,
      and give it a <lb/> moving grace and beauty and dignity. And yet one of these <lb/> people is
      a Thug and the other a mother of Thugs! The <reg orig="in-|congruities">incongruities</reg>
      <lb/> of our human nature seem to reach their limit here.</p>
     <p>I wish to make note of one curious thing while I think of <lb/> it. One of the very
      commonest remarks to be found in this <lb/> bewildering array of Thug confessions is this:</p>
     <p>"Strangled him and <hi rend="italic">threw him in a well!</hi>" In one case <lb/> they threw
      sixteen into a well&mdash;and they had thrown others <lb/> in the same well before. It
      makes a body thirsty to read <lb/> about it.</p>
     <p>And there is another very curious thing. The bands of <lb/> Thugs had <hi rend="italic"
       >private graceyards.</hi> They did not like to kill and <lb/> bury at random, here and there
      and everywhere. They <reg orig="pre-|ferred">preferred</reg>
      <lb/> to wait, and toll the victims along, and get to one of <lb/> their regular
      burying-places (bheels) if they could. In the <lb/> little kingdom of Oude,
      which was about half as big as Ireland <lb/> and about as big as the State of Maine, they had
       <hi rend="italic">two hundred <lb/> and seventy-four bheels.</hi> They were scattered along
       <hi rend="italic">fourteen <lb/> hundred miles of road,</hi> at an average of only <hi
       rend="italic">five miles apart, </hi>
      <lb/> and the British government traced out and located each and <lb/> every one of them and
      set them down on the map.</p>
     <p>The Oude bands seldom went out of their own country, but <lb/> they did a thriving business
      within its borders. So did outside <lb/> bands who came in and helped. Some of the Thug
      leaders of <lb/> Oude were noted for their successful careers. Each of four of <lb/> them
      confessed to above 300 murders; another to nearly 400; <lb/>
      <pb n="445" entity="DSSR_000002496_0460"/> our friend Ramzam to 604&mdash;he is the one
      who got leave of <lb/> absence to attend a wedding and went thugging instead; and <lb/> he is
      also the one who betrayed Buhram to the British.</p>
     <p>But the biggest records of all were the murder-lists of Futty <lb/> Khan and Buhram. Futty
      Khan's number is smaller than <lb/> Ramzam's, but he is placed at the head because his <hi
       rend="italic">average</hi> is <lb/> the best in Oude-Thug history per year of service. His
      <lb/> slaughter was 508 men in twenty years, and he was still a <lb/> young man when the
      British stopped his industry. Buhram's <lb/> list was 931 murders, but it took him forty
      years. His <reg orig="aver-|age">average</reg>
      <lb/> was one man and nearly all of another man per month for <lb/> forty years, but Futty
      Khan's average was <hi rend="italic">two</hi> men and a little <lb/> of another man per month
      during his twenty years of <reg orig="useful-|ness">usefulness</reg>.</p>
     <p>There is one very striking thing which I wish to call <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg>
      <lb/> to. You have surmised from the listed callings followed <lb/> by the victims of the
      Thugs that nobody could travel the <lb/> Indian roads unprotected and live to get through;
      that the <lb/> Thugs respected no quality, no vocation, no religion, nobody; <lb/> that they
      killed every unarmed man that came in their way. <lb/> That is wholly true&mdash;with one
      reservation. In all the long <lb/> file of Thug confessions <hi rend="italic">an English
       traveler is mentioned but <lb/> once</hi>&mdash;and this is what the Thug says of the
      circumstance:</p>
     <p>"He was on his way from Mhow to Bombay. <hi rend="italic">We studiously avoided him. </hi>
      <lb/> He proceeded next morning with a number of travelers <hi rend="italic">who had sought
       his <lb/> protection,</hi> and they took the road to Baroda."</p>
     <p>We do not know who he was; he flits aross the page of <lb/> this rusty old book and
      disappears in the obscurity beyond; <lb/> but he is an impressive figure, moving through that
      valley <lb/> of death serene and unafraid, clothed in the might of the <reg orig="Eng-|lish"
       >English</reg>
      <lb/> name.</p>
     <p>We have now followed the big official book through, and <lb/> we understand what Thuggee
      was, what a bloody terror it <lb/> was, what a desolating scourge it was. In 1830 the English <lb/>
      <pb n="446" entity="DSSR_000002496_0461"/> found this cancerous organization imbedded in the
      vitals of the <lb/> empire, doing its devastating work in secrecy, and assisted, <lb/>
      protected, sheltered, and hidden by innumerable confederates&mdash; <lb/> big and little
      native chiefs, customs officers, village officials, and <lb/> native police, all ready to lie
      for it, and the mass of the people, <lb/> through fear, persistently pretending to know
      nothing about <lb/> its doings; and this condition of things had existed for <reg
       orig="genera-|tions">generations</reg>, <lb/> and was formidable with the sanctions of age
      and old <lb/> custom. If ever there was an unpromising task, if ever there <lb/> was a
      hopeless task in the world, surely it was offered here&mdash; <lb/> the task of
      conquering Thuggee. But that little handful of <lb/> English officials in India set their
      sturdy and confident grip <lb/> upon it, and ripped it out, root and branch! How modest do
      <lb/> Captain Vallancey's words sound now, when we read them <lb/> again, knowing what we
      know:</p>
     <p>"The day that sees this far-spread evil completely eradicated from India, <lb/> and known
      only in name, will greatly tend to immortalize British rule in the <lb/> East."</p>
     <p>It would be hard to word a claim more modestly than that <lb/> for this most noble work.</p>

     <argument>
      <p>Grief can take care of itself; but to get the full value of a joy you must have <lb/>
       somebody to divide it with.<bibl>
        <author>&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.</hi></author>
       </bibl></p>
     </argument>
     <p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> left Bombay for Allahabad by a night train. It is <lb/> the
      custom of the country to avoid day travel when it <lb/> can conveniently be done. But there is
      one trouble: <lb/> while you can seemingly "secure" the two lower berths by <lb/> making early
      application, there is no ticket as witness of it, <lb/> and no other producible evidence in
      case your proprietorship <lb/> shall chance to be challenged. The word "engaged" appears <lb/>
      on the window, but it doesn't state who the compartment is <lb/> engaged <hi rend="italic"
      >for</hi>. If your Satan and your Barney arrive before <lb/> somebody else's servants, and
      spread the bedding on the two <lb/> sofas and then stand guard till you come, all will be
      well; but <lb/> if they step aside on an errand, they may find the beds <reg orig="pro-|moted"
       >promoted</reg>
      <lb/> to the two shelves, and somebody else's demons standing <lb/> guard over their master's
      beds, which in the meantime have <lb/> been spread upon your sofas.</p>
     <p>You do not pay anything extra for your sleeping place; that <lb/> is where the trouble lies.
      If you buy a fare-ticket and fail <lb/> to use it, there is room thus made available for
      someone else; <lb/> but if the place were secured to you it would remain vacant, <lb/> and yet
      your ticket would secure you <hi rend="italic">another</hi> place when you <lb/> were
      presently ready to travel.</p>
     <p>However, no explanation of such a system can make it <lb/> seem quite rational to a person
      who has been used to a more <lb/> rational system. If our people had the arranging of it, we
      <lb/> should charge extra for securing the place, and then the road <lb/> would suffer no loss
      if the purchaser did not occupy it.</p>
     <pb n="448" entity="DSSR_000002496_0463"/>
     <p>The present system encourages good manners&mdash;and also <lb/> discourages them. If a
      young girl has a lower berth and an <lb/> elderly lady comes in, it is usual for the girl to
      offer her place <lb/> to this late comer; and it is usual for the late comer to thank <lb/>
      her courteously and take it. But the thing happens differently <lb/> sometimes. When we were
      ready to leave Bombay my <reg orig="daugh-|ter's">daughter's</reg>
      <lb/> satchels were holding possession of her berth&mdash;a lower <lb/> one. At the last
      moment, a middle-aged American lady <lb/> swarmed into the compartment, followed by native
      porters <lb/> laden with her baggage. She was growling and snarling and <lb/> scolding, and
      trying to make herself phenomenally <reg orig="disagreea-|ble">disagreeable</reg>; <lb/> and
      succeeding. Without a word, she hoisted the <lb/> satchels into the hanging shelf, and took
      possession of that <lb/> lower berth.</p>
     <p>On one of our trips Mr. Smythe and I got out at a station <lb/> to walk up and down, and
      when we came back Smythe's bed <lb/> was in the hanging shelf and an English cavalry officer
      was in <lb/> bed on the sofa which he had lately been occupying. It was <lb/> mean to be glad
      about it, but it is the way we are made; <lb/> I could not have been gladder if it had been my
      enemy that <lb/> had suffered this misfortune. We all like to see people in <lb/> trouble, if
      it doesn't cost us anything. I was so happy over <lb/> Mr. Smythe's chagrin that I couldn't go
      to sleep for thinking <lb/> of it and enjoying it. I knew he supposed the officer had <lb/>
      committed the robbery himself, whereas without a doubt the <lb/> officer's servant had done it
      without his knowledge. Mr. <lb/> Smythe kept this incident warm in his heart, and longed for
      <lb/> a chance to get even with somebody for it. Sometime <reg orig="after-|ward">afterward</reg>
      <lb/> the opportunity came, in Calcutta. We were leaving <lb/> on a 24-hour journey to
      Darjeeling. Mr. Barclay, the general <lb/> superintendent, has made special provision for our
       <reg orig="accommo-|dation">accommodation</reg>, <lb/> Mr. Smythe said; so there was no need
      to hurry about <lb/> getting to the train; consequently, we were a little late. <lb/>
      <pb n="449" entity="DSSR_000002496_0464"/> When we arrived, the usual immense turmoil and
      confusion of <lb/> a great Indian station were in full blast. It was an <reg
       orig="immoder-|ately">immoderately</reg>
      <lb/> long train, for all the natives of India were going by it <lb/> somewhither, and the
      native officials were being pestered to <lb/> frenzy by belated and anxious people. They
      didn't know <lb/> where our car was, and couldn't remember having received <lb/> any orders
      about it. It was a deep disappointment; <reg orig="more-|over">moreover</reg>, <lb/> it looked
      as if our half of our party would be left behind <lb/> altogether. Then Satan came running and
      said he had found <lb/> a compartment with one shelf and one sofa unoccupied, and <lb/> had
      made our beds and had stowed our baggage. We rushed <lb/> to the place, and just as the train
      was ready to pull out and <lb/> the porters were slamming the doors to, all down the line, an
      <lb/> officer of the Indian Civil Service, a good friend of ours, put <lb/> his head in and
      said:&mdash;</p>
     <p>"I have been hunting for you everywhere. What are you <lb/> doing here? Don't you
      know&mdash;"</p>
     <p>The train started before he could finish. Mr. Smythe's <lb/> opportunity was come. His
      bedding, on the shelf, at once <lb/> changed places with the bedding&mdash;a
      stranger's&mdash;that was <lb/> occupying the sofa that was opposite to mine. About ten
      <lb/> o'clock we stopped somewhere, and a large Englishman of <lb/> official military bearing
      stepped in. We pretended to be asleep. <lb/> The lamps were covered, but there was light
      enough for us to <lb/> note his look of surprise. He stood there, grand and fine, <lb/>
      peering down at Smythe, and wondering in silence at the <lb/> situation. After a bit he
      said:&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Well!" And that was all.</p>
     <p>But that was enough. It was easy to understand. It <lb/> meant: "This is extraordinary. This
      is high-handed. I <lb/> haven't had an experience like this before."</p>
     <p>He sat down on his baggage, and for twenty minutes we <lb/> watched him through our
      eyelashes, rocking and swaying there <lb/>
      <pb n="450" entity="DSSR_000002496_0465"/> to the motion of the train. Then we came to a
      station, and he <lb/> got up and went out, muttering: "I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> find a
      lower berth, <lb/> or wait over." His servant came presently and carried away <lb/> his
      things.</p>
     <p>Mr. Smythe's sore place was healed, his hunger for revenge <lb/> was satisfied. But he
      couldn't sleep, and neither could I; for <lb/> this was a vencrable old car, and nothing about
      it was taut. <lb/> The closet door slammed all night, and defied every fastening <lb/> we
      could invent. We got up very much jaded, at dawn, and <lb/> stepped out at a way station; and,
      while we were taking a cup <lb/> of coffee, that Englishman ranged up alongside, and somebody
      <lb/> said to him:</p>
     <figure id="f117" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002496_0465">
      <p>SMYTHE'S REVENGE.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>"So you didn't stop off, after all?"</p>
     <p>"No. The guard found a place for me that had been <lb/> engaged and not occupied. I had a
      whole saloon car all to <lb/> myself&mdash;oh, quite palatial! I never had such luck in
      my <lb/> life."</p>
     <pb n="451" entity="DSSR_000002496_0466"/>
     <p>That was our car, you see. We moved into it, straight off, <lb/> the family and all. But I
      asked the English gentleman to <reg orig="re-|main">remain</reg>, <lb/> and he did. A pleasant
      man, an infantry colonel; and <lb/> doesn't know, yet, that Smythe robbed him of his berth,
      but <lb/> thinks it was done by Smythe's servant without Smythe's <lb/> knowledge. He was
      assisted in gathering this impression.</p>
     <p>The Indian trains are manned by natives exclusively. The <lb/> Indian
      stations&mdash;except very large and important ones&mdash;are <lb/> manned entirely
      by natives, and so are the posts and <reg orig="tele-|graphs">telegraphs</reg>. <lb/> The rank
      and file of the police are natives. All <lb/> these people are pleasant and accommodating. One
      day I left <lb/> an express train to lounge about in that perennially ravishing <lb/> show,
      the ebb and flow and whirl of gaudy natives, that is <lb/> always surging up and down the
      spacious platform of a great <lb/> Indian station; and I lost myself in the ecstasy of it, and
      <lb/> when I turned, the train was moving swiftly away. I was <lb/> going to sit down and wait
      for another train, as I would have <lb/> done at home; I had no thought of any other course.
      But a <lb/> native official, who had a green flag in his hand, saw me, and <lb/> said
      politely:</p>
     <p>"Don't you belong in the train, sir?"</p>
     <p>"Yes," I said.</p>
     <p>He waved his flag, and the train came back! And he put <lb/> me aboard with as much ceremony
      as if I had been the <reg orig="Gen-|eral">General</reg>
      <lb/> Superintendent. They are kindly people, the natives. <lb/> The face and the bearing that
      indicate a surly spirit and a bad <lb/> heart seemed to me to be so rare among
      Indians&mdash;so nearly <lb/> non-existent, in fact&mdash;that I sometimes wondered
      if Thuggee <lb/> wasn't a dream, and not a reality. The bad hearts <hi rend="italic">are</hi>
      there, <lb/> but I believe that they are in a small, poor minority. One <lb/> thing is sure:
      They are much the most <hi rend="italic">interesting</hi> people in <lb/> the
      world&mdash;and the nearest to being incomprehensible. At <lb/> any rate, the hardest to
      account for. Their character and <lb/>
      <pb n="452" entity="DSSR_000002496_0467"/> their history, their customs and their religion,
      confront you <lb/> with riddles at every turn&mdash;riddles which are a trifle more <lb/>
      perplexing after they are explained than they were before. <lb/> You can get the <hi
       rend="italic">facts</hi> of a custom&mdash;like caste, and Suttee, <lb/> and Thuggee,
      and so on&mdash;and with the facts a theory which <lb/> tries to explain, but never quite
      does it to your satisfaction. <lb/> You can never quite understand <hi rend="italic">how</hi>
      so strange a thing could <lb/> have been born, nor <hi rend="italic">why.</hi></p>
     <p>For instance&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">Suttee</hi>. This is the explanation of it:
      <lb/> A woman who throws away her life when her husband dies is <lb/> instantly joined to him
      again, and is forever afterward happy <lb/> with him in heaven; her family will build a little
      monument <lb/> to her, or a temple, and will hold her in honor, and, indeed. <lb/> worship her
      memory always; they will themselves be held <lb/> in honor by the public; the woman's
      self-sacrifice has <lb/> conferred a noble and lasting distinction upon her posterity. <lb/>
      And, besides, see what she has escaped: If she had elected <lb/> to live, she would be a
      disgraced person; she could not <reg orig="re-|marry">remarry</reg>; <lb/> her family would
      despise her and disown her; she <lb/> would be a friendless outcast, and miserable all her
      days.</p>
     <p>Very well, you say, but the explanation is not complete <lb/> yet. <hi rend="italic"
      >How</hi> did people come to drift into such a strange <reg orig="cus-|tom">custom</reg>?
      <lb/> What was the origin of the idea? "Well, nobody <lb/> knows; it was probably a revelation
      sent down by the <lb/> gods." One more thing: Why was such a cruel death chosen <lb/>
      &mdash;why wouldn't a gentle one have answered? "Nobody <lb/> knows; maybe that was a
      revelation, too."</p>
     <p>No&mdash;you can never understand it. It all seems <reg orig="impossi-|ble"
      >impossible</reg>. <lb/> You resolve to believe that a widow never burnt herself <lb/>
      willingly, but went to her death because she was afraid to defy <lb/> public opinion. But you
      are not able to keep that position. <lb/> History drives you from it. Major Sleeman has a
      convincing <lb/> case in one of his books. In his government on the Nerbudda <lb/>
      <pb n="453" entity="DSSR_000002496_0468"/> he made a brave attempt on the 28th of March, 1828,
      to put <lb/> down Suttee on his own hook and without warrant from the <lb/> Supreme Government
      of India. He could not foresee that the <lb/> Government would put it down itself eight months
      later. The <lb/> only backing he had was a bold nature and a compassionate <lb/> heart. He
      issued his proclamation abolishing the Suttee in his <lb/> district. On the morning of
      Tuesday&mdash;note the day of the <lb/> week&mdash;the 24th of the following
      November, Ummed Singh <lb/> Upadhya, head of the most respectable and most extensive <lb/>
      Brahmin family in the district, died, and presently came a <reg orig="dep-|utation">deputation</reg>
      <lb/> of his sons and grandsons to beg that his old widow <lb/> might be allowed to burn
      herself upon his pyre. Sleeman <lb/> threatened to enforce his order, and punish severely any
      man <lb/> who assisted; and he placed a police guard to see that no one <lb/> did so. From the
      early morning the old widow of sixty-five <lb/> had been sitting on the bank of the sacred
      river by her dead, <lb/> waiting through the long hours for the permission; and at <lb/> last
      the refusal came instead. In one little sentence Sleeman <lb/> gives you a pathetic picture of
      this lonely old gray figure: all <lb/> day and all night "she remained sitting by the edge of
      the <lb/> water without eating or drinking." The next morning the <lb/> body of the husband
      was burned to ashes in a pit eight feet <lb/> square and three or four feet deep, in the view
      of several <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg>
      <lb/> spectators. Then the widow waded out to a bare rock in <lb/> the river, and everybody
      went away but her sons and other <lb/> relations. All day she sat there on her rock in the
      blazing <lb/> sun without food or drink, and with no clothing but a sheet <lb/> over her
      shoulders.</p>
     <p>The relatives remained with her and all tried to persuade <lb/> her to desist from her
      purpose, for they deeply loved her. She <lb/> steadily refused. Then a part of the family went
      to Sleeman's <lb/> house, ten miles away, and tried again to get him to let her <lb/> burn
      herself. He refused, hoping to save her yet.</p>
     <pb n="454" entity="DSSR_000002496_0469"/>
     <p>All that day she scorched in her sheet on the rock, and all <lb/> that night she kept her
      vigil there in the bitter cold. <reg orig="Thurs-|day">Thursday</reg>
      <lb/> morning, in the sight of her relatives, she went through a <lb/> ceremonial which said
      more to them than any words could <lb/> have done; she put on the <hi rend="italic">dhaja</hi>
      (a course red turban) and <lb/> broke her bracelets in pieces. By these acts
      she became a dead <lb/> person in the eye of the law, and excluded from her caste <reg
       orig="for-|ever">forever</reg>. <lb/> By the iron rule of ancient custom, if she should now
      <lb/> choose to live she could never return to her family. Sleeman <lb/> was in deep trouble.
      If she starved herself to death her family <lb/> would be disgraced; and, moreover, starving
      would be a more <lb/> lingering misery than the death by fire. He went back in the <lb/>
      evening thoroughly worried. The old woman remained on her <lb/> rock, and there in the morning
      he found her with her <hi rend="italic">dhaja </hi>
      <lb/> still on her head. "She talked very collectedly, telling me <lb/> that she had
      determined to mix her ashes with those of her <lb/> departed husband, and should patiently
      wait my permission to <lb/> do so, assured that God would enable her to sustain life till
      <lb/> that was given, though she dared not eat or drink. Looking <lb/> at the sun, then rising
      before her over a long and beautiful <lb/> reach of the river, she said calmly, 'My soul has
      been for five <lb/> days with my husband's near that sun; nothing but my earthly <lb/> frame
      is left; and this, I know, you will in time suffer to be <lb/> mixed with his ashes in yonder
      pit, because it is not in your <lb/> nature or usage wantonly to prolong the miseries of a
      poor old <lb/> woman.'"</p>
     <p>He assured her that it was his desire and duty to save her, <lb/> and to urge her to live,
      and to keep her family from the <reg orig="dis-|grace">disgrace</reg>
      <lb/> of being thought her murderers. But she said she was <lb/> not afraid of their being
      thought so; that they had all, like <lb/> good children, done everything in their power to
      induce her to <lb/> live, and to abide with them; "and if I should consent I know <lb/> they
      would love and honor me, but my duties to them have <lb/>
      <pb n="455" entity="DSSR_000002496_0470"/> now ended. I commit them all to your care, and I go
      to <lb/> attend my husband, Ummed Singh Upadhya, with whose ashes <lb/> on the funeral pile
      mine have been already three times mixed."</p>
     <p>She believed that she and he had been upon the earth three <lb/> several times as wife and
      husband, and that she had burned <lb/> herself to death three times upon his pyre. That is why
      she <lb/> said that strange thing. Since she had broken her bracelets <lb/> and put on the red
      turban she regarded herself as a corpse; <lb/> otherwise she would not have allowed herself to
      do her <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg>
      <lb/> the irreverence of pronouncing his name. "This was the <lb/> first time in her long life
      that she had ever uttered her <reg orig="hus-|band's">husband's</reg>
      <lb/> name, for in India no woman, high or low, ever <reg orig="pro-|nounces">pronounces</reg>
      <lb/> the name of her husband."</p>
     <p>Major Sleeman still tried to shake her purpose. He <reg orig="prom-|ised">promised</reg>
      <lb/> to build her a fine house among the temples of her <reg orig="ances-|tors">ancestors</reg>
      <lb/> upon the bank of the river and make handsome provision <lb/> for her out of rent-free
      lands if she would consent to live; and <lb/> if she wouldn't he would allow no stone or brick
      to ever mark <lb/> the place where she died. But she only smiled and said, "My <lb/> pulse has
      long ceased to beat, my spirit has departed; I shall <lb/> suffer nothing in the burning; and
      if you wish proof, order <lb/> some fire and you shall see this arm consumed without giving
      <lb/> me any pain."</p>
     <p>Sleeman was now satisfied that he could not alter her <lb/> purpose. He sent for all the
      chief members of the family and <lb/> said he would suffer her to burn herself if they would
      enter <lb/> into a written engagement to abandon the suttee in their <lb/> family thenceforth.
      They agreed; the papers were drawn out <lb/> and signed, and at noon, Saturday, word was sent
      to the poor <lb/> old woman. She seemed greatly pleased. The ceremonies of <lb/> bathing were
      gone through with, and by three o'clock she was <lb/> ready and the fire was briskly burning
      in the pit. She had <lb/> now gone without food or drink during more than four days</p>
     <pb n="456" entity="DSSR_000002496_0471"/>
     <p>and a half. She came ashore from her rock, first wetting her <lb/> sheet in the waters of
      the sacred river, for without that <reg orig="safe-|guard">safeguard</reg>
      <lb/> any shadow which might fall upon her would convey <lb/> impurity to her: then she walked
      to the pit, leaning upon <lb/> one of her sons and a nephew&mdash;the distance was a
      hundred <lb/> and fifty yards.</p>
     <p>"I had sentries placed all around, and no other person was allowed to <lb/> approach within
      five paces. She came on with a calm and cheerful <reg orig="counte-|nance">countenance</reg>,
      <lb/> stopped once, and casting her eyes upwards, said, 'Why have they <lb/> kept me five days
      from thee, my husband?' On coming to the sentries her <lb/> supporters stopped and remained
      standing; she moved on, and walked once <lb/> around the pit, paused a moment, and while
      muttering a prayer, threw some <lb/> flowers into the fire. She then walked up deliberately
      and steadily to the <lb/> brink, stepped into the centre of the flame, sat down, and leaning
      back in the <lb/> midst as if reposing upon a couch, was consumed without uttering a shriek or
      <lb/> betraying one sign of agony."</p>
     <p>It is fine and beautiful. It compels one's reverence and <lb/> respect&mdash;no, has it
      freely, and without compulsion. We see <lb/> how the custom, once started, could continue, for
      the soul of it <lb/> is that stupendous power, Faith; faith brought to the pitch of <lb/>
      effectiveness by the cumulative force of example and long use <lb/> and custom; but we cannot
      understand how the first widows <lb/> came to take to it. That is a perplexing detail.</p>
     <p>Sleeman says that it was usual to play music at the suttee, <lb/> but that the white man's
      notion that this was to drown the <lb/> screams of the martyr is not correct; that it had a
      quite <reg orig="dif-|ferent">different</reg>
      <lb/> purpose. It was believed that the martyr died <reg orig="prophe-|cying"
      >prophecying</reg>; <lb/> that the prophecies sometimes foretold disaster, and it <lb/> was
      considered a kindness to those upon whom it was to fall to <lb/> drown the voice and keep them
      in ignorance of the misfortune <lb/> that was to come.</p>

     </argument>
     <p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was a long journey&mdash;two nights, one day, and part of
      <lb/> another day, from Bombay eastward to Allahabad; but it <lb/> was always interesting, and
      it was not fatiguing. At first <lb/> the night travel promised to be fatiguing, but that was
      on <lb/> account of <hi rend="italic">pyjamas</hi>. This foolish night-dress consists of
      jacket <lb/> and drawers. Sometimes they are made of silk, sometimes of <lb/> a raspy,
      scratchy, slazy woolen material with a sandpaper <reg orig="sur-|face">surface</reg>. <lb/>
      The drawers are loose elephant-legged and <reg orig="elephant-|waisted">elephant-waisted</reg>
      <lb/> things, and instead of buttoning around the body <lb/> there is a draw-string to produce
      the required shrinkage. The <lb/> jacket is roomy, and one buttons it in front. Pyjamas are
      hot <lb/> on a hot night and cold on a cold night&mdash;defects which a <lb/> nightshirt
      is free from. I tried the pyjamas in order to be in <lb/> the fashion; but I was obliged to
      give them up, I couldn't <lb/> stand them. There was no sufficient change from day-gear to
      <lb/> night-gear. I missed the refreshing and luxurious sense, <reg orig="in-|duced">induced</reg>
      <lb/> by the night-gown, of being undressed, emancipated, set <lb/> free from restraints and
      trammels. In place of that, I had the <lb/> worried, confined, oppressed, suffocated sense of
      being abed <lb/> with my clothes on. All through the warm half of the night <lb/> the coarse
      surfaces irritated my skin and made it feel baked <lb/> and feverish, and the dreams which
      came in the fitful flurries <lb/> of slumber were such as distress the sleep of the damned, or
      <lb/> ought to; and all through the cold other half of the night I <lb/> could get no time for
      sleep because I had to employ it all in <lb/>
      <pb n="460" entity="DSSR_000002496_0475"/> stealing blankets. But blankets are of no value at
      such a <lb/> time; the higher they are piled the more effectively they <lb/> cork the cold in
      and keep it from getting out. The result is <lb/> that your legs are ice, and you know how you
      will feel by and <lb/> by when you are buried. In a sane interval I discarded the <lb/>
      pyjamas, and led a rational and comfortable life thenceforth.</p>
     <p>Out in the country in India, the day begins early. One <lb/> sees a plain, perfectly flat,
      dust-colored and brick-yardy, <reg orig="stretch-|ing">stretching</reg>
      <lb/> limitlessly away on every side in the dim gray light, striped <lb/> everywhere with
      hard-beaten narrow paths, the vast flatness <lb/> broken at wide intervals by bunches of
      spectral trees that <lb/> mark where villages are; and along all the paths are slender <lb/>
      women and the black forms of lanky naked men moving to <lb/> their work, the women with brass
      water-jars on their heads, <lb/> the men carrying hoes. The man is not entirely naked; <lb/>
      always there is a bit of white rag, a loin-cloth; it amounts to <lb/> a bandage, and is a
      white accent on his black person, like the <lb/> silver band around the middle of a pipe-stem.
      Sometimes he <lb/> also wears a fluffy and voluminous white turban, and this adds <lb/> a
      second accent. He then answers properly to Miss Gordon <lb/> Cumming's flash-light picture of
      him&mdash;as a person who is <lb/> dressed in "a turban and a pocket handkerchief."</p>
     <p>All day long one has this monotony of dust-colored dead <lb/> levels and scattering bunches
      of trees and mud villages. You <lb/> soon realize that India is not beautiful; still there is
      an <reg orig="en-|chantment">enchantment</reg>
      <lb/> about it that is beguiling, and which does not pall. <lb/> You cannot tell just what it
      is that makes the spell, perhaps, <lb/> but you feel it and confess it, nevertheless. Of
      course, at <reg orig="bot-|tom">bottom</reg>, <lb/> you know in a vague way that it is <hi
       rend="italic">history</hi>; it is that <lb/> that affects you, a haunting sense of the
      myriads of human <lb/> lives that have blossomed, and withered, and perished here, <lb/>
      repeating and repeating and repeating, century after century, <lb/> and age after age, the
      barren and meaningless process; it is <lb/>
      <pb n="461" entity="DSSR_000002496_0476"/> this sense that gives to this forlorn, uncomely
      land power to <lb/> speak to the spirit and make friends with it; to speak to it <lb/> with a
      voice bitter with satire, but eloquent with melancholy. <lb/> The deserts of Australia and the
      ice-barrens of Greenland have <lb/> no speech, for they have no venerable history; with
      nothing <lb/> to tell of man and his vanities, his fleeting glories and his <lb/> miseries,
      they have nothing wherewith to spiritualize their <lb/> ugliness and veil it with a charm.</p>
     <p>There is nothing pretty about an Indian village&mdash;a mud <lb/> one&mdash;and I
      do not remember that we saw any but mud ones <lb/> on that long flight to Allahabad. It is a
      little bunch of <reg orig="dirt-|colored">dirt-colored</reg>
      <lb/> mud hovels jammed together within a mud wall. As <lb/> a rule, the rains had beaten down
      parts of some of the houses, <lb/> and this gave the village the aspect of a mouldering and
      hoary <lb/> ruin. I believe the cattle and the vermin live inside the wall; <lb/> for I saw
      cattle coming out and cattle going in; and whenever <lb/> I saw a villager, he was scratching.
      This last is only <reg orig="circum-|stantial">circumstantial</reg>
      <lb/> evidence, but I think it has value. The village has a <lb/> battered little temple or
      two, big enough to hold an idol, and <lb/> with custom enough to fat-up a priest and keep him
       <reg orig="comfort-|able">comfortable</reg>. <lb/> Where there are Mohammedans there are
      generally a <lb/> few sorry tombs outside the village that have a decayed and <lb/> neglected
      look. The villages interested me because of things <lb/> which Major Sleeman says about them
      in his <reg orig="books&mdash;particu-|larly">books&mdash;particularly</reg>
      <lb/> what he says about the division of labor in them. He <lb/> says that the whole face of
      India is parceled out into estates of <lb/> villages; that nine-tenths of the vast population
      of the land <lb/> consist of cultivators of the soil; that it is these cultivators <lb/> who
      inhabit the villages; that there are certain "established" <lb/> village
      servants&mdash;mechanics and others who are apparently <lb/> paid a wage by the village
      at large, and whose callings remain <lb/> in certain families and are handed down from father
      to son, <lb/> like an estate. He gives a list of these established servants:</p>
     <pb n="462" entity="DSSR_000002496_0477"/>
     <p>Priest, blacksmith, carpenter, accountant, washerman, <reg orig="basket-|maker"
      >basket-maker</reg>, <lb/> potter, watchman, barber, shoemaker, brazier, <reg
       orig="confec-|tioner">confectioner</reg>, <lb/> weaver, dyer, etc. In his day witches
      abounded, and it <lb/> was not thought good business wisdom for a man to marry <lb/> his
      daughter into a family that hadn't a witch in it, for she <lb/> would need a witch on the
      premises to protect her children <lb/> from the evil spells which would certainly be cast upon
      them <lb/> by the witches connected with the neighboring families.</p>
     <p>The office of midwife was hereditary in the family of the <lb/> basket-maker. It belonged to
      his wife. She might not be <lb/> competent, but the office was hers, anyway. Her pay was not
      <lb/> high&mdash;25 cents for a boy, and half as much for a girl. The <lb/> girl was not
      desired, because she would be a disastrous expense <lb/> by and by. As soon as she should be
      old enough to begin to <lb/> wear clothes for propriety's sake, it would be a disgrace to the
      <lb/> family if she were not married; and to marry her meant <reg orig="finan-|cial">financial</reg>
      <lb/> ruin; for by custom the father must spend upon feasting <lb/> and wedding-display
      everything he had and all he could borrow <lb/> &mdash;in fact, reduce himself to a
      condition of poverty which he <lb/> might never more recover from.</p>
     <p>It was the dread of this prospective ruin which made the <lb/> killing of girl-babies so
      prevalent in India in the old days <lb/> before England laid the iron hand of her prohibitions
      upon the <lb/> piteous slaughter. One may judge of how prevalent the <reg orig="cus-|tom"
       >custom</reg>
      <lb/> was, by one of Sleeman's casual electrical remarks, when <lb/> he speaks of children at
      play in villages&mdash;<hi rend="italic">where girl-voices <lb/> were never heard!</hi></p>
     <p>The wedding-display folly is still in full force in India, and <lb/> by consequence the
      destruction of girl-babies is still furtively <lb/> practiced; but not largely, because of the
      vigilance of the <lb/> government and the sternness of the penalties it levies.</p>
     <p>In some parts of India the village keeps in its pay three <lb/> other servants: an
      astrologer to tell the villager when he may <lb/>
      <pb n="463" entity="DSSR_000002496_0478"/> plant his crop, or make a journey, or marry a wife,
      or strangle <lb/> a child, or borrow a dog, or climb a tree, or catch a rat, or <lb/> swindle
      a neighbor, without offending the alert and solicitous <lb/> heavens; and what his dream
      means, if he has had one and <lb/> was not bright enough to interpret it himself by the
      details of <lb/> his dinner; the two other established servants were the <reg
       orig="tiger-|persuader">tiger-persuader</reg>
      <lb/> and the hailstorm discourager. The one kept away <lb/> the tigers if he could, and
      collected the wages anyway, and <lb/> the other kept off the hailstorms, or explained why he
      failed. <lb/> He charged the same for explaining a failure that he did for <lb/> scoring a
      success. A man is an idiot who can't earn a living in <lb/> India.</p>

      <p>A STREET SPRINKLER.</p>

     <p>Major Sleeman reveals the fact that the trade union and <lb/> the boycott are antiquities in
      India. India seems to have <lb/> originated everything. The <lb/> "sweeper" belongs to the
       <reg orig="bot-|tom">bottom</reg>
      <lb/> caste; he is the lowest of <lb/> the low&mdash;all other castes <lb/> despise him
      and scorn his office. <lb/> But that does not trouble him. <lb/> His caste is a caste, and
      that <lb/> is sufficient for him, and so he <lb/> is proud of it, not ashamed. <lb/> Sleeman
      says:</p>
     <p>"It is perhaps not known to many <lb/> of my countrymen, even in India, that <lb/> in every
      town and city in the country <lb/> the right of sweeping the houses and <lb/> streets is a
      monopoly, and is supported <lb/> entirely by the pride of castes among <lb/> the scavengers,
      who are all of the <reg orig="low-|est">lowest</reg>
      <lb/> class. The right of sweeping within a certain range is recognized by the <lb/> caste to
      belong to a certain member; and if any other member presumes to <lb/> sweep within that range,
      he is excommunicated&mdash;no other member will <lb/> smoke out of his pipe or drink out
      of his jug; and he can get restored to <lb/> caste only by a feast to the whole body of
      sweepers. If any housekeeper <lb/> within a particular circle happens to offend the sweeper of
      that range, none of <lb/>
      <pb n="464" entity="DSSR_000002496_0479"/> his filth will be removed till he pacities him,
      because no other sweeper will <lb/> dare to touch it; and the people of a town are often more
      tyrannized over by <lb/> these people than by any other."</p>
     <p>A footnote by Major Sleeman's editor, Mr. Vincent Arthur <lb/> Smith, says that in our day
      this tyranny of the sweepers' guild <lb/> is one of the many difficulties which bar the
      progress of Indian <lb/> sanitary reform. Think of this:</p>
     <p>"The sweepers cannot be readily cocreed, because no Hindoo or <reg orig="Mussul-|man"
       >Mussulman</reg>
      <lb/> would do their work to save his life, nor will he pollute himself by <lb/> beating the
      refractory seavenger."</p>
     <p>They certainly do seem to have the whip-hand; it would <lb/> be difficult to imagine a more
      impregnable position. "The <lb/> vested rights described in the text are so fully recognized
      in <lb/> practice that <hi rend="italic">they are frequently the subject of sale or mortgage."</hi>
      <lb/> Just like a milk-route; or like a London crossing-sweepership. <lb/> It is said that the
      London crossing-sweeper's right to his <reg orig="cross-|ing">crossing</reg>
      <lb/> is recognized by the rest of the guild; that they protect <lb/> him in its possession;
      that certain choice <reg orig="cross-|ings">crossings</reg>
      <lb/> are valuable property, and are saleable at <lb/> high figures. I have noticed that the
      man who <lb/> sweeps in front of the Army and Navy Stores <lb/> has a wealthy South African
      aristocratic style <lb/> about him; and when he is off his guard, he has <lb/> exactly that
      look on his face which you always <lb/> see in the face of a man who has is saving <lb/> up
      his daughter to marry her to a duke.</p>

     <p>It appears from Sleeman that in India the occupation of <lb/> elephant-driver is confined to
      Mohammedans. I wonder why <lb/> that is. The water-carrier (<hi rend="italic"
       >bheestie</hi>) is a Mohammedan, but <lb/> it is said that the reason of that is,
      that the Hindoo's religion <lb/> does not allow him to touch the skin of dead kine, and that
      <lb/> is what the water-sack is made of; it would defile him. <lb/> And it doesn't allow him
      to eat meat; the animal that <reg orig="fur-|nished">furnished</reg>
      <lb/> the meat was murdered, and to take any creature's life <lb/> is a sin. It is a good and
      gentle religion, but inconvenient.</p>

     <p>A great Indian river, at low water, suggests the familiar <lb/> anatomical picture of a
      skinned human body, the intricate <lb/> mesh of interwoven muscles and tendons to stand for
       <reg orig="water-|channels">water-channels</reg>, <lb/> and the archipelagoes of fat and
      flesh inclosed by <lb/> them to stand for the sandbars. Somewhere on this journey <lb/> we
      passed such a river, and on a later journey we saw in the <lb/> Sutlej the duplicate of that
      river. Curious rivers they are; <lb/> low shores a dizzy distance apart, with nothing between
      but an <lb/> enormous acreage of sand-flats with sluggish little veins of <lb/> water
      dribbling around amongst them; Saharas of sand, <reg orig="small-|pox-pitted">smallpox-pitted</reg>
      <lb/> with footprints punctured in belts as straight as the <lb/> equator clear from the one
      shore to the other (barring the <lb/> channel-interruptions)&mdash;a
      dry-shod ferry, you see. Long <reg orig="rail-|way">railway</reg>
      <lb/> bridges are required for this sort of rivers, and India has <lb/> them. You approach
      Allahabad by a very long one. It was <lb/> now carrying us across the bed of the Jumna, a bed
      which did <lb/> not seem to have been slept in for one while or more. It <lb/> wasn't all
      river-bed&mdash;most of it was overflow ground.</p>
     <p>Allahabad means "City of God." I get this from the <lb/> books. From a printed
      curiosity&mdash;a letter written by one of <lb/> those brave and confident Hindoo
      strugglers with the English <lb/> tongue, called a "babu"&mdash;I got a more compressed
       <reg orig="transla-|tion">translation</reg>: <lb/> "Godville." It is perfectly correct, but
      that is the most <lb/> that can be said for it.</p>
     <p>We arrived in the forenoon, and short-handed; for Satan <lb/> got left behind somewhere that
      morning, and did not overtake <lb/> us until after nightfall. It seemed very peaceful without
      him. <lb/> The world seemed asleep and dreaming.</p>
     <p>I did not see the native town, I think. I do not remember <lb/> why; for an incident
      connects it with the Great Mutiny, and <lb/> that is enough to make any place interesting. But
      I saw the <lb/> English part of the city. It is a town of wide avenues and</p>
     <pb n="466" entity="DSSR_000002496_0481"/>
     <p>noble distances, and is comely and alluring, and full of <reg orig="sug-|gestions"
       >suggestions</reg>
      <lb/> of comfort and leisure, and of the serenity which a <lb/> good conscience buttressed by
      a sufficient bank account gives. <lb/> The bungalows (dwellings) stand well
      back in the seclusion <lb/> and privacy of large enclosed compounds (private grounds,
      as <lb/> we should say) and in the shade and shelter of trees. Even <lb/> the
      photographer and the prosperous merchant ply their <reg orig="indus-|tries">industries</reg>
      <lb/> in the elegant reserve of big compounds, and the citizens <lb/> drive in there upon
      their business occasions. And not in cabs&mdash; <lb/> no; in the Indian cities cabs are
      for the drifting stranger; all the <lb/> white citizens have private carriages; and each
      carriage has a <lb/> flock of white-turbaned black footmen and drivers all over it. <lb/> The
      vicinity of a lecture-hall looks like a snowstorm, and <lb/> makes the lecturer feel like an
      opera. India has many names, <lb/> and they are correctly descriptive. It is the Land of <reg
       orig="Contra-|dictions">Contradictions</reg>, <lb/> the Land of Subtlety and Superstition,
      the Land of <lb/> Wealth and Poverty, the Land of Splendor and Desolation, the <lb/> Land of
      Plague and Famine, the Land of the Thug and the <lb/> Poisoner, and of the Meek and the
      Patient, the Land of the <lb/> Suttee, the Land of the Unreinstatable Widow, the Land where
      <lb/> All Life is Holy, the Land of Cremation, the Land where the <lb/> Vulture is a Grave and
      a Monument, the Land of the <reg orig="Mul-|titudinous">Multitudinous</reg>
      <lb/> Gods; and if signs go for anything, it is the Land <lb/> of the Private Carriage.</p>
     <p>In Bombay the forewoman of a millinery shop came to the <lb/> hotel in her private carriage
      to take the measure for a gown&mdash; <lb/> not for me, but for another. She had come out
      to India to <lb/> make a temporary stay, but was extending it indefinitely; <reg
       orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg>, <lb/> she was purposing to end her days there. In London, she
      <lb/> said, her work had been hard, her hours long; for economy's <lb/> sake she had had to
      live in shabby rooms and far away from <lb/> the shop, watch the pennies, deny herself many of
      the common <lb/> comforts of life, restrict herself in effect to its bare necessities, <lb/>
      <pb n="467" entity="DSSR_000002496_0482"/> eschew cabs, travel third-class by underground
      train to and <lb/> from her work, swallowing coal-smoke and cinders all the way, <lb/> and
      sometimes troubled with the society of men and women <lb/> who were less desirable than the
      smoke and the cinders. But <lb/> in Bombay, on almost any kind of wages, she could live in
      <lb/> comfort, and keep her carriage, and have six servants in place <lb/> of the
      woman-of-all-work she had had in her English home. <lb/> Later, in Calcutta, I found that the
      Standard Oil clerks had <lb/> small one-horse vehicles, and did no walking; and I was told
      <lb/> that the clerks of the other large concerns there had the like <lb/> equipment. But to
      return to Allahabad.</p>
     <p>I was up at dawn, the next morning. In India the tourist's <lb/> servant does not sleep in a
      room in the hotel, but rolls himself <lb/> up head and ears in his blanket and stretches
      himself on the <lb/> veranda, across the front of his master's door, and spends the <lb/>
      night there. I don't believe anybody's servant occupies a <lb/> room. Apparently, the bungalow
      servants sleep on the <lb/> veranda; it is roomy, and goes all around the house. I speak <lb/>
      of men-servants; I saw none of the other sex. I think there <lb/> are none, except
      child-nurses. I was up at dawn, and walked <lb/> around the veranda, past the rows of
      sleepers. In front of one <lb/> door a Hindoo servant was squatting, waiting for his master to
      <lb/> call him. He had polished the yellow shoes and placed them <lb/> by the door, and now he
      had nothing to do but wait. It was <lb/> freezing cold, but there he was, as motionless as a
      sculptured <lb/> image, and as patient. It troubled me. I wanted to say to <lb/> him, Don't
      crouch there like that and freeze; nobody requires <lb/> it of you; stir around and get warm."
      But I hadn't the <lb/> words. I thought of saying <hi rend="italic">jeldy jow</hi>, but I
      couldn't <reg orig="remem-|ber">remember</reg>
      <lb/> what it meant, so I didn't say it. I knew another phrase, <lb/> but it wouldn't come to
      my mind. I moved on, purposing to <lb/> dismiss him from my thoughts, but his bare legs and
      bare feet <lb/> kept him there. They kept drawing me back from the sunny <lb/>
      <pb n="468" entity="DSSR_000002496_0483"/> side to a point whence I could see him. At the end
      of an <lb/> hour he had not changed his attitude in the least degree. It <lb/> was a curious
      and impressive exhibition of meekness and <lb/> patience, or fortitude or indifference, I did
      not know which. <lb/> But it worried me, and it was spoiling my morning. In fact, <lb/> it
      spoiled two hours of it quite thoroughly. I quitted this <lb/> vicinity, then, and left him to
      punish himself as much as he <lb/> might want to. But up to that time the man had not changed
      <lb/> his attitude a hair. He will always remain with me, I suppose; <lb/> his figure never
      grows vague in my memory. Whenever I <lb/> read of Indian resignation, Indian patience under
      wrongs, <lb/> hardships, and misfortunes, he comes before me. He becomes <lb/> a
      personification, and stands for India in trouble. And for <lb/> untold ages India in trouble
      has been pursued with the very <lb/> remark which I was going to utter but didn't, because its
      <lb/> meaning had slipped me: <hi rend="italic">Jeldy jow!</hi> ("Come, shove
      along!") <lb/> Why, it was the very thing.</p>
     <figure id="f121" rend="block" entity="DSSR_000002496_0483">
      <p>"IT WORRIED ME"</p>
     </figure>
     <p>In the early brightness we made a long drive out to the <lb/>
      <pb n="469" entity="DSSR_000002496_0484"/> Fort. Part of the way was beautiful. It led under
      stately <lb/> trees and through groups of native houses and by the usual <lb/> village well,
      where the picturesque gangs are always flocking <lb/> to and fro and laughing and chattering;
      and this time brawny <lb/> men were deluging their bronze bodies with the limpid water, <lb/>
      and making a refreshing and enticing show of it; enticing, for <lb/> the sun was already
      transacting business, firing India up for <lb/> the day. There was plenty of this early
      bathing going on, for <lb/> it was getting toward breakfast time, and with an unpurified <lb/>
      body the Hindoo must not eat.</p>
     <p>Then we struck into the hot plain, and found the roads <lb/> crowded with pilgrims of both
      sexes, for one of the great <lb/> religious fairs of India was being held, just beyond the
      Fort, <lb/> at the junction of the sacred rivers, the Ganges and the Jumna. <lb/> Three sacred
      rivers, I should have said, for there is a <reg orig="subter-|ranean">subterranean</reg>
      <lb/> one. Nobody has seen it, but that doesn't signify. <lb/> The fact that it is there is
      enough. These pilgrims had come <lb/> from all over India; some of them had been months on the
      <lb/> way, plodding patiently along in the heat and dust, worn, <lb/> poor, hungry, but
      supported and sustained by an unwavering <lb/> faith and belief; they were supremely happy and
      content, <lb/> now; their full and sufficient reward was at hand; they were <lb/> going to be
      cleansed from every vestige of sin and corruption <lb/> by these holy waters which make
      utterly pure whatsoever thing <lb/> they touch, even the dead and rotten. It is wonderful, the
      <lb/> power of a faith like that, that can make multitudes upon <lb/> multitudes of the old
      and weak and the young and frail enter <lb/> without hesitation or complaint upon such
      incredible journeys <lb/> and endure the resultant miseries without repining. It is done <lb/>
      in love, or it is done in fear; I do not know which it is. No <lb/> matter what the impulse
      is, the act born of it is beyond <reg orig="imag-|ination">imagination</reg>
      <lb/> marvelous to our kind of people, the cold whites. <lb/> There are choice great natures
      among us that could exhibit <lb/>
      <pb n="470" entity="DSSR_000002496_0485"/> the equivalent of this prodigious self-sacrifice,
      but the rest of <lb/> us know that we should not be equal to anything approaching <lb/> it.
      Still, we all talk self-sacrifice, and this makes me hope <lb/> that we are large enough to
      honor it in the Hindoo.</p>
     <p>Two millions of natives arrive at this fair every year. <lb/> How many start, and die on the
      road, from age and fatigue <lb/> and disease and scanty nourishment, and how many die on the
      <lb/> return, from the same causes, no one knows; but the tale is <lb/> great, one may say
      enormous. Every twelfth year is held to <lb/> be a year of peculiar grace; a greatly augmented
      volume of <lb/> pilgrims results then. The twelfth year has held this <reg
       orig="distinc-|tion">distinction</reg>
      <lb/> since the remotest times, it is said. It is said also that <lb/> there is to be but one
      more twelfth year&mdash;for the Ganges. <lb/> After that, that holiest of all sacred
      rivers will cease to be <lb/> holy, and will be abandoned by the pilgrim for many centuries;
      <lb/> how many, the wise men have not stated. At the end of that <lb/> interval it will become
      holy again. Meantime, the data will <lb/> be arranged by those people who have charge of all
      such <reg orig="mat-|ters">matters</reg>, <lb/> the great chief Brahmins. It will be like
      shutting down <lb/> a mint. At a first glance it looks most unbrahminically <reg
       orig="un-|commercial">uncommercial</reg>, <lb/> but I am not disturbed, being soothed and
       <reg orig="tran-|quilized">tranquilized</reg>
      <lb/> by their reputation. "Brer fox he lay low," as Uncle <lb/> Remus says; and at the
      judicious time he will spring <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg>
      <lb/> on the Indian public which will show that he was not <lb/> financially asleep when he
      took the Ganges out of the market.</p>
     <p>Great numbers of the natives along the roads were bringing <lb/> away holy water from the
      rivers. They would carry it far <lb/> and wide in India and sell it. Tavernier, the French
      traveler <lb/> (17th century), notes that Ganges water is often given at
       <reg orig="wed-|dings">weddings</reg>, <lb/> "each guest receiving a cup or two, according to
      the <lb/> liberality of the host; sometimes 2,000 or 3,000 rupees' worth <lb/> of it is
      consumed at a wedding."</p>

      a monolith <lb/> which was placed there more than 2,000 years ago to preach <lb/> Budhism by
      its pious inscription; the Fort was built three <lb/> centuries ago by a Mohammedan
      Emperor&mdash;a resanctification <lb/> of the place in the interest of <hi rend="italic"
       >that</hi> religion. There is a Hindoo <lb/> temple, too, with subterranean ramifications
      stocked with <lb/> shrines and idols; and now the Fort belongs to the English, it <lb/>
      contains a Christian Church. Insured in all the companies.</p>
     <p>From the lofty ramparts one has a fine view of the sacred <lb/> rivers. They join at that
      point&mdash;the pale blue Jumna, <reg orig="ap-|parently">apparently</reg>
      <lb/> clean and clear, and the muddy Ganges, dull yellow <lb/> and not clean. On a long curved
      spit between the rivers, towns <lb/> of tents were visible, with a multitude of fluttering
      pennons, and <lb/> a mighty swarm of pilgrims. It was a troublesome place to <lb/> get down
      to, and not a quiet place when you arrived; but it <lb/> was interesting. There was a world of
      activity and turmoil and <lb/> noise, partly religious, partly commercial; for the <reg
       orig="Mohamme-|dans">Mohammedans</reg>
      <lb/> were there to curse and sell, and the Hindoos to buy and <lb/> pray. It is a fair as
      well as a religious festival. Crowds were <lb/> bathing, praying, and drinking the purifying
      waters, and many <lb/> sick pilgrims had come long journeys in palanquins to be <lb/> healed
      of their maladies by a bath; or if that might not be, <lb/> then to die on the blessed banks
      and so make sure of heaven. <lb/> There were fakeers in plenty, with their bodies dusted over
      <lb/> with ashes and their long hair caked together with cow-dung; <lb/> for the cow is holy
      and so is the rest of it; so holy that <lb/> the good Hindoo peasant frescoes the walls of his
      hut with this <lb/> refuse, and also constructs ornamental figures out of it for the <lb/>
      gracing of his dirt floor. There were seated families, fearfully <lb/> and wonderfully
      painted, who by attitude and grouping <reg orig="repre-|sented">represented</reg>
      <lb/> the families of certain great gods. There was a holy <lb/> man who sat naked by the day
      and by the week on a cluster of <lb/> iron spikes, and did not seem to mind it; and another
      holy <lb/>
      <pb n="474" entity="DSSR_000002496_0489"/> man, who stood all day holding his withered arms
      motionless <lb/> aloft, and was said to have been doing it for years. All of <lb/> these
      performers have a cloth on the ground beside them for <lb/> the reception of contributions,
      and even the poorest of the <lb/> people give a trifle and hope that the sacrifice will be
      blessed <lb/> to him. At last came a procession of naked holy people <lb/> marching by and
      chanting, and I wrenched myself away.</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> journey to Benares was all in daylight, and <reg
       orig="occu-|pied">occupied</reg>
      <lb/> but a few hours. It was admirably dusty. The <lb/> dust settled upon you in a thick ashy
      layer and turned <lb/> you into a fakeer, with nothing lacking to the role but the <lb/> cow
      manure and the sense of holiness. There was a change of <lb/> cars about mid-afternoon at
      Moghul-serai&mdash;if that was the <lb/> name&mdash;and a wait of two hours there
      for the Benares train. <lb/> We could have found a carriage and driven to the sacred city,
      <lb/> but we should have lost the wait. In other countries a long <lb/> wait at a station is a
      dull thing and tedious, but one has no <lb/> right to have that feeling in India. You have the
      monster <lb/> crowd of bejeweled natives, the stir, the bustle, the confusion, <lb/> the
      shifting splendors of the costumes&mdash;dear me, the delight <lb/> of it, the charm of
      it are beyond speech. The two-hour wait <lb/> was over too soon. Among other satisfying things
      to look at <lb/> was a minor native prince from the backwoods somewhere, <lb/> with his guard
      of honor, a ragged but wonderfully gaudy <lb/> gang of fifty dark barbarians armed with rusty
      flint-lock <lb/> muskets. The general show came so near to exhausting <lb/> variety that one
      would have said that no addition to it could <lb/> be conspicuous, but when this Falstaff and
      his motleys marched <lb/> through it one saw that that seeming impossibility had <reg
       orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg>.</p>
     <p>We got away by and by, and soon reached the outer edge <lb/> of Benares; then there was
      another wait; but, as usual, with <lb/>
      <pb n="476" entity="DSSR_000002496_0491"/> something to look at. This was a cluster of little
       <reg orig="canvas-|boxes&mdash;palanquins">canvasboxes&mdash;palanquins</reg>.
      <lb/> A canvas-box is not much of a sight&mdash; <lb/> when empty; but when there is a
      lady in it, it is an object of <lb/> interest. These boxes were grouped apart, in the full
      blaze of <lb/> the terrible sun during the three-quarters of an hour that we <lb/> tarried
      there. They contained zenana ladies. The had to sit <lb/> up; there was not room enough to
      stretch out. They <reg orig="prob-|ably">probably</reg>
      <lb/> did not mind it. They are used to the close captivity of <lb/> their dwellings all their
      lives; when they go a journey they <lb/> are carried to the train in these boxes; in the train
      they have <lb/> to be secluded from inspection. Many people pity them, and <lb/> I always did
      it myself and never charged anything; but it is <lb/> doubtful if this compassion is valued.
      While we were in India <lb/> some good-hearted Europeans in one of the cities proposed to
      <lb/> restrict a large park to the use of zenana ladies, so that they <lb/> could go there and
      in assured privacy go about unveiled and <lb/> enjoy the sunshine and air as they had never
      enjoyed them <lb/> before. The good intentions back of the proposition were <lb/> recognized,
      and sincere thanks returned for it, but the <reg orig="propo-|sition">proposition</reg>
      <lb/> itself met with a prompt declination at the hands of <lb/> those who were authorized to
      speak for the zenana ladies. <lb/> Apparently, the idea was shocking to the
      ladies&mdash;indeed, it <lb/> was quite manifestly shocking. Was that proposition the
      <lb/> equivalent of inviting European ladies to assemble scantily <lb/> and scandalously
      clothed in the seclusion of a private park? <lb/> It seemed to be about that.</p>
     <p>Without doubt modesty is nothing less than a holy feeling; <lb/> and without doubt the
      person whose rule of modesty has been <lb/> trangressed feels the same sort of wound that he
      would feel if <lb/> something made holy to him by his religion had suffered a <lb/>
      desecration. I say "rule of modesty" because there are about <lb/> a million rules in the
      world, and this makes a million standards <lb/> to be looked out for. Major Sleeman mentions
      the case of some <lb/>
      <pb n="477" entity="DSSR_000002496_0492"/> high-caste veiled ladies who were profoundly
      scandalized when <lb/> some English young ladies passed by with faces bare to the <lb/> world;
      so scandalized that they spoke out with strong <reg orig="indigna-|tion">indignation</reg>
      <lb/> and wondered that people could be so shameless as to <lb/> expose their persons like
      that. And yet "the legs of the <lb/> objectors were naked to mid-thigh." Both parties were
       <reg orig="clean-|minded">clean-minded</reg>
      <lb/> and irreproachably modest, while abiding by their <lb/> separate rules, but they
      couldn't have traded rules for a change <lb/> without suffering considerable discomfort. All
      human rules <lb/> are more or less idiotic, I suppose. It is best so, no doubt. <lb/> The way
      it is now, the asylums can hold the sane people, but <lb/> if we tried to shut up the insane
      we should run out of building <lb/> materials.</p>
     <p>You have a long drive through the outskirts of Benares <lb/> before you get to the hotel.
      And all the aspects are <reg orig="melan-|choly">melancholy</reg>. <lb/> It is a vision of
      dusty sterility, decaying temples, <lb/> crumbling tombs, broken mud walls, shabby huts. The
      whole <lb/> region seems to ache with age and penury. It must take ten <lb/> thousand years of
      want to produce such an aspect. We were <lb/> still outside of the great native city when we
      reached the hotel. <lb/> It was a quiet and homelike house, inviting, and manifestly <lb/>
      comfortable. But we liked its annex better, and went thither. <lb/> It was a mile away,
      perhaps, and stood in the midst of a large <lb/> compound, and was built bungalow fashion,
      everything on the <lb/> ground floor, and a veranda all around. They have doors in <lb/>
      India, but I don't know why. They don't fasten, and they <lb/> stand open, as a rule, with a
      curtain hanging in the doorspace <lb/> to keep out the glare of the sun. Still, there is
      plenty of <reg orig="pri-|vacy">privacy</reg>, <lb/> for no white person will come in without
      notice, of course. <lb/> The native men servants will, but they don't seem to count. <lb/>
      They glide in, barefoot and noiseless, and are in the midst <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg>
      <lb/> one knows it. At first this is a shock, and sometimes it <lb/> is an embarrassment; but
      one has to get used to it, and does.</p>
     <pb n="478" entity="DSSR_000002496_0493"/>
     <p>There was one tree in the compound, and a monkey lived <lb/> in it. At first I was strongly
      interested in the tree, for I was <lb/> told that it was the renowned <hi rend="italic"
      >peepul</hi>&mdash;the tree in whose <lb/> shadow you cannot tell a lie. This one failed
      to stand the test, <lb/> and I went away from it disappointed. There was a softly <lb/>
      creaking well close by, and a couple of oxen drew water from <lb/> it by the hour,
      superintended by two natives dressed in the <lb/> usual "turban and pocket-handkerchief." The
      tree and the <lb/> well were the only scenery, and so the compound was a <reg
       orig="sooth-|ing">soothing</reg>
      <lb/> and lonesome and satisfying place; and very restful after <lb/> so many activities.
      There was nobody in our bungalow but <lb/> ourselves; the other guests were in the next one,
      where the <lb/> table d'hote was furnished. A body could not be more <reg orig="pleas-|antly"
       >pleasantly</reg>
      <lb/> situated. Each room had the customary bath attached&mdash; <lb/> a room ten or
      twelve feet square, with a roomy stone-paved <lb/> pit in it and abundance of water. One could
      not easily <lb/> improve upon this arrangement, except by furnishing it with <lb/> cold water
      and excluding the hot, in deference to the fervency <lb/> of the climate; but that is
      forbidden. It would damage the <lb/> bather's health. The stranger is warned against taking
      cold <lb/> baths in India, but even the most intelligent strangers are <lb/> fools, and they
      do not obey, and so they presently get laid up. <lb/> I was the most intelligent fool that
      passed through, that year. <lb/> But I am still more intelligent now. Now that it is too late.</p>
     <p>I wonder if the <hi rend="italic">dorian,</hi> if that is the name of it, is another <lb/>
      superstition, like the peepul tree. There was a great <reg orig="abun-|dance">abundance</reg>
      <lb/> and variety of tropical fruits, but the dorian was never <lb/> in evidence. It was never
      the season for the dorian. It was <lb/> always going to arrive from Burma sometime or other,
      but it <lb/> never did. By all accounts it was a most strange fruit, and <lb/> incomparably
      delicious to the taste, but not to the smell. Its <lb/> rind was said to exude a stench of so
      atrocious a nature that <lb/> when a dorian was in the room even the presence of a polecat <lb/>
      <pb n="479" entity="DSSR_000002496_0494"/> was a refreshment. We found many who had eaten the
      <lb/> dorian, and they all spoke of it with a sort of rapture. They <lb/> said that if you
      could hold your nose until the fruit was in <lb/> your mouth a sacred joy would suffuse you
      from head to foot <lb/> that would make you oblivious to <lb/> the smell of the rind, but that
      if <lb/> your grip slipped and you caught <lb/> the smell of the rind before the <lb/> fruit
      was in your mouth, you <lb/> would faint. There is a <reg orig="for-|tune">fortune</reg>
      <lb/> in that rind. Some day <lb/> somebody will import it into <lb/> Europe and sell it for
      cheese.</p>

      <lb/> reputation as a curiosity. It <lb/> is on high ground, and <reg orig="over-|hangs"
       >overhangs</reg>
      <lb/> a grand curve of the <lb/> Ganges. It is a vast mass of <lb/> building, compactly
      crusting <lb/> a hill, and is cloven in all <lb/> directions by an intricate <lb/> confusion
      of cracks which <lb/> stand for streets. Tall, slim <lb/> minarets and beflagged <reg
       orig="tem-|ple-spires">temple-spires</reg>
      <lb/> rise out of it and <lb/> give it picturesqueness, <lb/> viewed from the river. The city
      is as busy as an ant-hill, and <lb/> the hurly-burly of human life swarming along the web of
      <lb/> narrow streets reminds one of the ants. The sacred cow <lb/> swarms along, too, and goes
      whither she pleases, and takes <lb/> toll of the grain-shops, and is very much in the way, and
      is a <lb/> good deal of a nuisance, since she must not be molested.</p>
     <pb n="480" entity="DSSR_000002496_0495"/>
     <p>Benares is older than history, older than tradition, older <lb/> even than legend, and looks
      twice as old as all of them put <lb/> together. From a Hindoo statement quoted in Rev. Mr.
      <lb/> Parker's compact and lucid Guide to Benares, I find that the <lb/> site of the town was
      the beginning-place of the Creation. It <lb/> was merely an upright "lingam," at first, no
      larger than a <lb/> stove-pipe, and stood in the midst of a shoreless ocean. This <lb/> was
      the work of the God Vishnu. Later he spread the lingam <lb/> out till its surface was ten
      miles across. Still it was not large <lb/> enough for the business; therefore he presently
      built the <lb/> globe around it. Benares is thus the center of the earth. <lb/> This is
      considered an advantage.</p>
     <p>It has had a tumultuous history, both materially and <reg orig="spirit-|ually"
      >spiritually</reg>. <lb/> It started Brahminically, many ages ago; then by and <lb/> by Buddha
      came in recent times 2,500 years ago, and after <lb/> that it was Buddhist during many
      centuries&mdash;twelve, <reg orig="per-|haps&mdash;but">perhaps&mdash;but</reg>
      <lb/> the Brahmins got the upper hand again, then, and <lb/> have held it ever since. It is
      unspeakably sacred in Hindoo <lb/> eyes, and is as unsanitary as it is sacred, and smells like
      the <lb/> rind of the dorian. It is the headquarters of the Brahmin <lb/> faith, and
      one-eighth of the population are priests of that <lb/> church. But it is not an overstock, for
      they have all India as <lb/> a prey. All India flocks thither on pilgrimage, and pours its
      <lb/> savings into the pockets of the priests in a generous stream, <lb/> which never fails. A
      priest with a good stand on the shore of <lb/> the Ganges is much better off than the sweeper
      of the best <reg orig="cross-|ing">crossing</reg>
      <lb/> in London. A good stand is worth a world of money. <lb/> The holy proprietor of it sits
      under his grand spectacular <lb/> umbrella and blesses people all his life, and collects his
       <reg orig="com-|mission">commission</reg>, <lb/> and grows fat and rich; and the stand passes
      from <lb/> father to son, down and down and down through the ages, <lb/> and remains a
      permanent and lucrative estate in the family. <lb/> As Mr. Parker suggests, it can become a
      subject of dispute, at <lb/>
      <pb n="481" entity="DSSR_000002496_0496"/> one time or another, and then the matter will be
      settled, not <lb/> by prayer and fasting and consultations with Vishnu, but by <lb/> the
      intervention of a much more puissant power&mdash;an English <lb/> court. In Bombay I was
      told by an American missionary <lb/> that in India there are 640 Protestant missionaries at
      work. <lb/> At first it seemed an immense force, but of course that was a <lb/> thoughtless
      idea. One missionary to 500,000 natives&mdash;no, <lb/> that is not a force; it is the
      reverse of it; 640 marching <lb/> against an intrenched camp of 300,000,000&mdash;the
      odds are too <lb/> great. A force of 640 in Benares alone would have its hands <lb/> over-full
      with 8,000 Brahmin priests for adversary. <reg orig="Mission-|aries">Missionaries</reg>
      <lb/> need to be well equipped with hope and confidence, and <lb/> this equipment they seem to
      have always had in all parts of <lb/> the world. Mr. Parker has it. It enables him to get a
       <reg orig="favor-|able">favorable</reg>
      <lb/> outlook out of statistics which might add up differently <lb/> with other
      mathematicians. For instance:</p>
     <p>"During the past few years competent observers declare <lb/> that the number of pilgrims to
      Benares has increased."</p>
     <p>And then he adds up this fact and gets this conclusion:</p>
     <p>"But the revival, if so it may be called, has in it the marks <lb/> of death. It is a
      spasmodic struggle before dissolution."</p>
     <p>In this world we have seen the Roman Catholic power <lb/> dying, upon these same terms, for
      many centuries. Many a <lb/> time we have gotten all ready for the funeral and found it <lb/>
      postponed again, on account of the weather or something. <lb/> Taught by experience, we ought
      not to put on our things for <lb/> this Brahminical one till we see the procession move. <reg
       orig="Appar-|ently">Apparently</reg>
      <lb/> one of the most uncertain things in the world is the <lb/> funeral of a religion.</p>
     <p>I should have been glad to acquire some sort of idea of <lb/> Hindoo theology, but the
      difficulties were too great, the matter <lb/> was too intricate. Even the mere A, B, C of it
      is baffling. <lb/>
      <pb n="482" entity="DSSR_000002496_0497"/> There is a trinity&mdash;Brahma, Shiva, and
      Vishnu&mdash;independent <lb/> powers, apparently, though one cannot feel quite sure of
      that, <lb/> because in one of the temples there is an image where an <lb/> attempt has been
      made to concentrate the three in one person. <lb/> The three have other names and plenty of
      them, and this <lb/> makes confusion in one's mind. The three have wives and the <lb/> wives
      have several names, and this increases the confusion. <lb/> There are children, the children
      have many names, and thus <lb/> the confusion goes on and on. It is not worth while to try to
      <lb/> get any grip upon the cloud of minor gods, there are too many <lb/> of them.</p>
     <p>It is even a justifiable economy to leave Brahma, the <lb/> chiefest god of all, out of your
      studies, for he seems to cut no <lb/> great figure in India. The vast bulk of the national
      worship <lb/> is lavished upon Shiva and Vishnu and their families. Shiva's <lb/>
      symbol&mdash;the "lingam" with which Vishnu began the <reg
       orig="Crea-|tion&mdash;is">Creation&mdash;is</reg>
      <lb/> worshiped by everybody, apparently. It is the <reg orig="com-|monest">commonest</reg>
      <lb/> object in Benares. It is on view everywhere, it is <lb/> garlanded with flowers,
      offerings are made to it, it suffers no <lb/> neglect. Commonly it is an upright stone, shaped
      like a <lb/> thimble&mdash;sometimes like an elongated thimble. This <reg
       orig="priapus-|worship">priapus-worship</reg>, <lb/> then, is older than history. Mr. Parker
      says that the <lb/> lingams in Benares "<hi rend="italic">outnumber the inhabitants."</hi></p>
     <p>In Benares there are many Mohammedan mosques. There <lb/> are Hindoo temples without
      number&mdash;these quaintly shaped <lb/> and elaborately sculptured little stone jugs
      crowd all the lanes. <lb/> The Ganges itself and every individual drop of water in it are
      <lb/> temples. Religion, then, is the <hi rend="italic">business</hi> of Benares, just as
      <lb/> gold-production is the business of Johannesburg. Other <reg orig="indus-|tries"
       >industries</reg>
      <lb/> count for nothing as compared with the vast and <reg orig="all-ab-|sorbing"
       >all-absorbing</reg>
      <lb/> rush and drive and boom of the town's specialty. <reg orig="Be-|nares">Benares</reg>
      <lb/> is the sacredest of sacred cities. The moment you step <lb/> across the sharply-defined
      line which separates it from the rest <lb/>
      <pb n="483" entity="DSSR_000002496_0498"/> of the globe, you stand upon ineffably and
      unspeakably holy <lb/> ground. Mr. Parker says: "It is impossible to convey any <lb/> adequate
      idea of the intense feelings of veneration and <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg>
      <lb/> with which the pious Hindoo regards 'Holy Kashi' <lb/> (Benares)." And
      then he gives you this vivid and moving <reg orig="pic-|ture">picture</reg>:</p>
     <p>"Let a Hindoo regiment be marched through the district, and as soon as <lb/> they cross the
      line and enter the limits of the holy place they rend the air with <lb/> cries of 'Kashi ji ki
      jai&mdash;jai&mdash;jai! (Holy Kashi! Hail to thee! Hail! <lb/> Hail!
      Hail)'. The weary pilgrim scarcely able to stand, with age and <reg orig="weak-|ness"
       >weakness</reg>, <lb/> blinded by the dust and heat, and almost dead with fatigue, crawls out
      <lb/> of the oven-like railway carriage and as soon as his feet touch the ground he <lb/>
      lifts up his withered hands and utters the same pious exclamation. Let a <lb/> European in
      some distant city in casual talk in the bazar mention the fact that <lb/> he has lived at
      Benares, and at once voices will be raised to call down <reg orig="bless-|ings">blessings</reg>
      <lb/> on his head, for a dweller in Benares is of all men most blessed."</p>
     <p>It makes our own religious enthusiasm seem pale and cold. <lb/> Inasmuch as the life of
      religion is in the heart, not the head, <lb/> Mr. Parker's touching picture seems to promise a
      sort of <reg orig="indefi-|nite">indefinite</reg>
      <lb/> postponement of that funeral.</p>

     <p>I will make out a little itinerary for the pilgrim; then you <lb/> will see how handy the

      go to Benares with a serious desire to <reg orig="spir-|itually">spiritually</reg>
      <lb/> benefit yourself, you will find it valuable. I got some <lb/> of the facts from
      conversations with the Rev. Mr. Parker and <lb/> the others from his Guide to Benares; they
      are therefore <reg orig="trust-|worthy">trustworthy</reg>.</p>
     <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Purification</hi>. At sunrise you must go down to the <lb/> Ganges and
      bathe, pray, and drink some of the water. This is <lb/> for your general purification.</p>
     <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Protection against Hunger</hi>. Next, you must fortify <lb/> yourself
      against the sorrowful earthly ill just named. This <lb/> you will do by worshiping for a
      moment in the Cow Temple. <lb/> By the door of it you will find an image of Ganesh, son of
      <lb/> Shiva; it has the head of an elephant on a human body; its <lb/> face and hands are of
      silver. You will worship it a little, and <lb/> pass on, into a covered veranda, where you
      will find devotees <lb/> reciting from the sacred books, with the help of instructors. <lb/>
      In this place are groups of rude and dismal idols. You may <lb/> contribute something for
      their support; then pass into the <reg orig="tem-|ple">temple</reg>, <lb/>
      <pb n="485" entity="DSSR_000002496_0500"/> a grim and stenchy place, for it is populous with
      sacred <lb/> cows and with beggars. You will give something to the <reg orig="beg-|gars"
       >beggars</reg>, <lb/> and "reverently kiss the tails" of such cows as pass along, <lb/> for
      these cows are peculiarly holy, and this act of worship will <lb/> secure you from hunger for
      the day.</p>

      <p>DO IT REVERENTLY.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>3. "<hi rend="italic">The Poor Man's Friend</hi>." You will next worship <lb/> this god. He
      is at the bottom of a stone cistern in the temple <lb/> of Dalbhyeswar, under the shade of a
      noble peepul tree on the <lb/> bluff overlooking the Ganges, so you must go back to the <lb/>
      river. The Poor Man's Friend is the god of <hi rend="italic">material <reg orig="pros-|perity"
        >prosperity</reg></hi>
      <lb/> in general, and the god of the <hi rend="italic">rain</hi> in particular. You <lb/> will
      secure material prosperiy, tor both, by worshiping him. <lb/> He is Shiva, under a new alias,
      and he abides in the bottom <lb/> of that cistern, in the form of a stone lingam. You pour
      <lb/> Ganges water over him, and in return for this homage you <lb/> get the promised
      benefits. If there is any delay about the <lb/> rain, you must pour water in until the cistern
      is full; the rain <lb/> will then be sure to come.</p>
     <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Fever</hi>. At the Kedar Ghat you will find a long flight <lb/> of
      stone steps leading down to the river. Half way down is a <lb/> tank filled with sewage. Drink
      as much of it as you want. It <lb/> is for fever.</p>
     <pb n="486" entity="DSSR_000002496_0501"/>
     <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Smallpox.</hi> Go straight from there to the central Ghat. <lb/> At its
      upstream end you will find a small whitewashed <reg orig="build-|ing">building</reg>, <lb/>
      which is a temple sacred to Sitala, goddess of smallpox. <lb/> Her under-study is
      there&mdash;a rude human figure behind a brass <lb/> screen. You will worship this for
      reasons to be furnished <lb/> presently.</p>
     <p>6. <hi rend="italic">The Well of Fate.</hi> For certain reasons you will next <lb/> go and
      do homage at this well. You will find it in the <reg orig="Dand-|pan">Dandpan</reg>
      <lb/> Temple, in the city. The sunlight falls into it from a <lb/> square hole in the masonry
      above. You will approach it with <lb/> awe, for your life is now at stake. You will bend over
      and <lb/> look. If the fates are propitious, you will see your face <reg orig="pic-|tured"
       >pictured</reg>
      <lb/> in the water far down in the well. If matters have been <lb/> otherwise ordered, a
      sudden cloud will mask the sun and you <lb/> will see nothing. This means that you have not
      six months to <lb/> live. If you are already at the point of death, your <reg
       orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg>
      <lb/> are now serious. There is no time to lose. Let this <lb/> world go, arrange for the next
      one. Handily situated, at <lb/> your very elbow, is opportunity for this. You turn and <reg
       orig="wor-|ship">worship</reg>
      <lb/> the image of Maha Kal, the Great Fate, and happiness in <lb/> the life to come is
      secured. If there is breath in your body <lb/> yet, you should now make an effort to get a
      further lease of <lb/> the present life. You have a chance. There is a chance for <lb/>
      everything in this admirably stocked and wonderfully <reg orig="system-|ized">systemized</reg>

     <p>7.<hi rend="italic"> Well of Long Life.</hi> This is within the precincts of the <lb/>
      mouldering and venerable Briddhkal Temple, which is one of <lb/> the oldest in Benares. You
      pass in by a stone image of the <lb/> monkey god, Hanuman, and there, among the ruined <reg
       orig="court-|yards">courtyards</reg>, <lb/> you will find a shallow pool of stagnant sewage.
      It <lb/> smells like the best limburger cheese, and is filthy with the <lb/> washings of

      <lb/> for the new race of life. Now will come flooding upon <lb/> you the manifold desires

     <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Fulfillment of Desire.</hi> To wit, to the Kameshwar <lb/> Temple,
      sacred to Shiva as the Lord of Desires. Arrange for <lb/> yours there. And if you like to look
      at idols among the pack <lb/> and jam of temples, there you will find enough to stock a <lb/>
      museum. You will begin to commit sins now with a fresh, <lb/> new vivacity; therefore, it will
      be well to go frequently to a <lb/> place where you can get</p>
     <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Temporary Cleansing from Sin.</hi> To wit, to the Well <lb/> of the
      Earring. You must approach this with the profoundest <lb/> reverence, for it is unutterably
      sacred. It is, indeed, the most <lb/> sacred place in Benares, the very Holy of Holies, in the
       <reg orig="esti-|mation">estimation</reg>
      <lb/> of the people. It is a railed tank, with stone stairways <lb/> leading down to the
      water. The water is not clean. Of <lb/> course it could not be, for people are always bathing
      in it. <lb/> As long as you choose to stand and look, you will see the files <lb/> of sinners
      descending and ascending&mdash;descending soiled with <lb/> sin, ascending purged from
      it. "The liar, the thief, the <reg orig="mur-|derer">murderer</reg>, <lb/> and the adulterer
      may here wash and be clean," says <lb/> the Rev. Mr. Parker, in his book. Very well. I know
      Mr. <lb/> Parker, and I believe it; but if anybody else had said it, I <lb/> should consider
      him a person who had better go down in the <lb/> tank and take another wash. The god Vishnu
      dug this tank. <lb/> He had nothing to dig with but his "discus." I do not know <lb/> what a
      discus is, but I know it is a poor thing to dig tanks <lb/> with, because, by the time this
      one was finished, it was full of <lb/>
      <pb n="490" entity="DSSR_000002496_0505"/> sweat&mdash;Vishnu's sweat. He constructed the
      site that <lb/> Benares stands on, and afterward built the globe around it, <lb/> and thought
      nothing of it, yet sweated like that over a little <lb/> thing like this tank. One of these
      statements is doubtful. I <lb/> do not know which one it is, but I think it difficult not to
      <lb/> believe that a god who could build a world around Benares <lb/> would not be intelligent
      enough to build it around the tank <lb/> too, and not have to dig it. Youth, long life,
      temporary <reg orig="puri-|fication">purification</reg>
      <lb/> from sin, salvation through propitiation of the Great <lb/> Fate&mdash;these are
      all good. But you must do something more. <lb/> You must</p>
     <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Make Salvation Sure.</hi> There are several ways. To <lb/> get drowned
      in the Ganges is one, but that is not pleasant. <lb/> To die within the limits of Benares is
      another; but that is a <lb/> risky one, because you might be out of town when your time <lb/>
      came. The best one of all is the Pilgrimage Around the City. <lb/> You must walk; also, you
      must go barefoot. The tramp is <lb/> forty-four miles, for the road winds out into the country
      a <lb/> piece, and you will be marching five or six days. But you <lb/> will have plenty of
      company. You will move with throngs <lb/> and hosts of happy pilgrims whose radiant costumes
      will <lb/> make the spectacle beautiful and whose glad songs and holy <lb/> p&aelig;ans
      of triumph will banish your fatigues and cheer your <lb/> spirit; and at intervals there will
      be temples where you may <lb/> sleep and be refreshed with food. The pilgrimage completed,
      <lb/> you have purchased salvation, and paid for it. But you may <lb/> not get it unless you</p>
     <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Get Your Redemption Recorded.</hi> You can get this <lb/> done at the
      Sakhi Binayak Temple, and it is best to do it, for <lb/> otherwise you might not be able to
      prove that you had made <lb/> the pilgrimage in case the matter should some day come to be
      <lb/> disputed. That temple is in a lane back of the Cow Temple. <lb/> Over the door is a red
      image of Ganesh of the elephant head, <lb/>
      <pb n="491" entity="DSSR_000002496_0506"/> son and heir of Shiva, and Prince of Wales to the
      Theological <lb/> Monarchy, so to speak. Within is a god whose office it is to <lb/> record
      your pilgrimage and be responsible for you. You will <lb/> not see him, but you will see a
      Brahmin who will attend to the <lb/> matter and take the money. If he should forget to collect
      the <lb/> money, you can remind him. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> knows that your salvation <lb/>
      is now secure, but of course you would like to know it <reg orig="your-|self">yourself</reg>.
      <lb/> You have nothing to do but go and pray, and pay at the</p>
     <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Well of the Knowledge of Salvation.</hi> It is close to <lb/> the
      Golden Temple. There you will see, sculptured out of a <lb/> single piece of black marble, a
      bull which is much larger than <lb/> any living bull you have ever seen, and yet is not a good
       <reg orig="like-|ness">likeness</reg>
      <lb/> after all. And there also you will see a very uncommon <lb/> thing&mdash;an image
      of Shiva. You have seen his lingam fifty <lb/> thousand times already, but this is Shiva
      himself, and said to <lb/> be a good likeness. It has three eyes. He is the only god in <lb/>
      the firm that has three. "The well is covered by a fine <lb/> canopy of stone supported by
      forty pillars," and around it you <lb/> will find what you have already seen at almost every
      shrine <lb/> you have visited in Benares, a mob of devout and eager <reg orig="pil-|grims"
       >pilgrims</reg>. <lb/> The sacred water is being ladled out to them; with it <lb/> comes to
      them the knowledge, clear, thrilling, absolute, that <lb/> they are saved; and you can see by
      their faces that there is <lb/> one happiness in this world which is supreme, and to which no
      <lb/> other joy is comparable. You receive your water, you make <lb/> your deposit, and now
      what more would you have? Gold, <lb/> diamonds, power, fame? All in a single moment these
      things <lb/> have withered to dirt, dust, ashes. The world has nothing to <lb/> give you now.
      For you it is bankrupt.</p>
     <p>I do not claim that the pilgrims do their acts of worship in <lb/> the order and sequence
      above charted out in this Itinerary of <lb/> mine, but I think logic suggests that they ought
      to do so. <lb/> Instead of a helter-skelter worship, we then have a definite <lb/>
      <pb n="492" entity="DSSR_000002496_0507"/> starting-place, and a march which carries the
      pilgrim steadily <lb/> forward by reasoned and logical progression to a definite goal. <lb/>
      Thus, his Ganges bath in the early morning gives him an <lb/> appetite; he kisses the
      cow-tails, and that removes it. It is <lb/> now business hours, and longings for material
      prosperity rise <lb/> in his mind, and he goes and pours water over Shiva's symbol; <lb/> this
      insures the prosperity, but also brings on a rain, which <lb/> gives him a fever. Then he
      drinks the sewage at the Kedar <lb/> Ghat to cure the fever; it cures the fever but gives him
      the <lb/> smallpox. He wishes to know how it is going to turn out; he <lb/> goes to the
      Dandpan Temple and looks down the well. A <lb/> clouded sun shows him that death is near.
      Logically his best <lb/> course for the present, since he cannot tell at what moment he <lb/>
      may die, is to secure a happy hereafter; this he does, through <lb/> the agency of the Great
      Fate. He is safe, now, for heaven; <lb/> his next move will naturally be to keep out of it as
      long as he <lb/> can. Therefore he goes to the Briddhkal Temple and secures <lb/> Youth and
      long life by bathing in a puddle of leper-pus which <lb/> would kill a microbe. Logically,
      Youth has re-equipped him <lb/> for sin and with the disposition to commit it; he will
      naturally <lb/> go to the fane which is consecrated to the Fulfillment of <lb/> Desires, and
      make arrangements. Logically, he will now go <lb/> to the Well of the Earring from time to
      time to unload and <lb/> freshen up for further banned enjoyments. But first and last <lb/>
      and all the time he is human, and therefore in his reflective <lb/> intervals he will always
      be speculating in "futures." He will <lb/> make the Great Pilgrimage around the city and so
      make his <lb/> salvation absolutely sure; he will also have record made of it, <lb/> so that
      it may remain absolutely sure and not be forgotten or <lb/> repudiated in the confusion of the
      Final Settlement. <reg orig="Logic-|ally">Logically</reg>, <lb/> also, he will wish to have
      satisfying and tranquilizing <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">personal</hi> knowledge that that salvation is secure; therefore he <lb/>
      goes to the Well of the Knowledge of Salvation, adds that <lb/>
      <pb n="493" entity="DSSR_000002496_0508"/> completing detail, and then goes about his affairs
      serene and <lb/> content; serene and content, for he is now royally endowed <lb/> with an
      advantage which no religion in this world could give <lb/> him but his own; for henceforth he
      may commit as many <reg orig="mil-|lion">million</reg>
      <lb/> sins as he wants to and nothing can come of it.</p>
     <p>Thus the system, properly and logically ordered, is neat, <lb/> compact, clearly defined,
      and covers the whole ground. I <lb/> desire to recommend it to such as find the other systems
      too <lb/> difficult, exacting, and irksome for the uses of this fretful brief <lb/> life of
      ours.</p>
     <p>However, let me not deceive any one. My Itinerary lacks <lb/> a detail. I must put it in.
      The truth is, that after the <reg orig="pil-|grim">pilgrim</reg>
      <lb/> has faithfully followed the requirements of the Itinerary <lb/> through to the end and
      has secured his salvation and also the <lb/> personal knowledge of that fact, there is still
      an accident <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg>
      <lb/> to him which can annul the whole thing. If he should <lb/> ever cross to the other side
      of the Ganges and get caught out <lb/> and die there he would at once come to life again in
      the form <lb/>

       <p>CONSIDERING THE MATTER.</p>
      </figure> of an ass. Think of that, after all this trouble and expense. <lb/> You see how
      capricious and uncertain salvation is there. The <lb/> Hindoo has a childish and unreasoning
      aversion to being <lb/>
      <pb n="494" entity="DSSR_000002496_0509"/> turned into an ass. It is hard to tell why. One
      could <reg orig="prop-|erly">properly</reg>
      <lb/> expect an ass to have an aversion to being turned into a <lb/> Hindoo. One could
      understand that he could lose dignity by <lb/> it; also self-respect, and nine-tenths of his
      intelligence. But <lb/> the Hindoo changed into an ass wouldn't lose anything, unless <lb/>
      you count his religion. And he would gain much&mdash;release <lb/> from his slavery to
      two million gods and twenty million <lb/> priests, fakeers, holy mendicants, and other sacred
      bacilli; he <lb/> would escape the Hindoo hell; he would also escape the <lb/> Hindoo heaven.
      These are advantages which the Hindoo <lb/> ought to consider; then he would go over and die
      on the other <lb/> side.</p>
     <p>Benares is a religious Vesuvius. In its bowels the <reg orig="theolog-|ical">theological</reg>
      <lb/> forces have been heaving and tossing, rumbling, <reg orig="thunder-|ing">thundering</reg>
      <lb/> and quaking, boiling, and weltering and flaming and <lb/> smoking for ages. But a little
      group of missionaries have <lb/> taken post at its base, and they have hopes. There are the
      <lb/> Baptist Missionary Society, the Church Missionary Society, the <lb/> London Missionary
      Society, the Wesleyan Missionary Society, <lb/> and the Zenana Bible and Medical Mission. They
      have <lb/> schools, and the principal work seems to be among the <lb/> children. And no doubt
      that part of the work prospers best, <lb/> for grown people everywhere are always likely to
      cling to the <lb/> religion they were brought up in.</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> one of those Benares temples we saw a devotee working <lb/>
      for salvation in a curious way. He had a huge wad of <lb/> clay beside him and was making it
      up into little wee gods <lb/> no bigger than carpet tacks. He stuck a grain of rice into <lb/>
      eachmdash;to represent the lingam, I think. He turned them out <lb/> nimbly, for he had had
      long practice and had acquired great <lb/> facility. Every day he made 2,000 gods, then threw
      them into <lb/> the holy Ganges. This act of homage brought him the <reg orig="pro-|found"
       >profound</reg>
      <lb/> homage of the piousmdash;also their coppers. He had a sure <lb/> living here, and was
      earning a high place in the hereafter.</p>
     <p>The Ganges front is the supreme show-place of Benares. <lb/> Its tall bluffs are solidly
      caked from water to summit, along a <lb/> stretch of three miles, with a splendid jumble of
      massive and <lb/> picturesque masonry, a bewildering and beautiful confusion of <lb/> stone
      platforms, temples, stair-flights, rich and stately palaces <lb/> mdash;nowhere a break,
      nowhere a glimpse of the bluff itself; all <lb/> the long face of it is compactly walled from
      sight by this <lb/> crammed perspective of platforms, soaring stairways, <reg
       orig="sculp-|tured">sculptured</reg>
      <lb/> temples, majestic palaces, softening away into the <reg orig="dis-|tances"
      >distances</reg>; <lb/> and there is movement, motion, human life everywhere, <lb/> and
      brilliantly costumedmdash;streaming in rainbows up and <lb/> down the lofty stairways, and
      massed in metaphorical <reg orig="flower-|gardens">flower-gardens</reg>
      <lb/> on the miles of great platforms at the river's edge.</p>
     <p>All this masonry, all this architecture represents piety. <lb/> The palaces were built by
      native princes whose homes, as a <lb/>
      <pb n="497" entity="DSSR_000002496_0512"/> rule, are far from Benares, but who go there from
      time to time <lb/> to refresh their souls with the sight and touch of the Ganges, the <lb/>
      river of their idolatry. The stairways are records of acts of <lb/> piety; the crowd of costly
      little temples are tokens of money <lb/> spent by rich men for present credit and hope of
      future <reg orig="re-|ward">reward</reg>. <lb/> Apparently, the rich Christian who spends
      large sums <lb/> upon his religion is conspicuous with us, by his rarity, but the <lb/> rich
      Hindoo who doesn't spend large sums upon his religion is <lb/> seemingly non-existent. With us
      the poor spend money on <lb/> their religion, but they keep back some to live on. <reg
       orig="Appar-|ently">Apparently</reg>, <lb/> in India, the poor bankrupt themselves daily for
      their <lb/> religion. The rich Hindoo can afford his pious outlays; he <lb/> gets much glory
      for his spendings, yet keeps back a sufficiency <lb/> of his income for temporal purposes; but
      the poor Hindoo is <lb/> entitled to compassion, for his spendings keep him poor, yet <lb/>
      get him no glory.</p>
     <p>We made the usual trip up and down the river, seated in <lb/> chairs under an awning on the
      deck of the usual commodious <lb/> hand-propelled ark; made it two or three times, and could
      <lb/> have made it with increasing interest and enjoyment many <lb/> times more; for, of
      course, the palaces and temples would <lb/> grow more and more beautiful every time one saw
      them, for <lb/> that happens with all such things; also, I think one would not <lb/> get tired
      of the bathers, nor their costumes, nor of their <reg orig="inge-|nuities">ingenuities</reg>
      <lb/> in getting out of them and into them again without <lb/> exposing too much bronze, nor
      of their devotional <reg orig="gesticula-|tions">gesticulations</reg>
      <lb/> and absorbed bead-tellings.</p>
     <p>But I should get tired of seeing them wash their mouths <lb/> with that dreadful water and
      drink it. In fact, I did get tired <lb/> of it, and very early, too. At one place where we
      halted for a <lb/> while, the foul gush from a sewer was making the water turbid <lb/> and
      murky all around, and there was a random corpse slopping <lb/> around in it that had floated
      down from up country. Ten steps <lb/>

       <p>THE PURIFYING WATERS OF THE GANGES.</p>
      </figure>
      <pb n="499" entity="DSSR_000002496_0514"/> below that place stood a crowd of men, women, and
      comely <lb/> young maidens waist deep in the water&mdash;and they were <lb/> scooping it
      up in their hands and drinking it. Faith can <reg orig="cer-|tainly">certainly</reg>
      <lb/> do wonders, and this is an instance of it. Those people <lb/> were not drinking that
      fearful stuff to assuage thirst, but in <lb/> order to purify their souls and the interior of
      their bodies. <lb/> According to their creed, the Ganges water makes everything <lb/> pure
      that it touches&mdash;instantly and utterly pure. The sewer <lb/> water was not an
      offence to them, the corpse did not revolt <lb/> them; the sacred water had touched both, and
      both were now <lb/> snow-pure, and could defile no one. The memory of that sight <lb/> will
      always stay by me; but not by request.</p>
     <p>A word further concerning the nasty but all-purifying <lb/> Ganges water. When we went to
      Agra, by and by, we <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg>
      <lb/> there just in time to be in at the birth of a marvel&mdash;a <lb/> memorable
      scientific discovery&mdash;the discovery that in certain <lb/> ways the foul and derided
      Ganges water <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the most puissant <lb/> purifier in the world! This
      curious fact, as I have said, had <lb/> just been added to the treasury of modern science. It
      had <lb/> long been noted as a strange thing that while Benares is often <lb/> afflicted with
      the cholera she does not spread it beyond her <lb/> borders. This could not be accounted for.
      Mr. Henkin, the <lb/> scientist in the employ of the government of Agra, concluded <lb/> to
      examine the water. He went to Benares and made his <lb/> tests. He got water at the mouths of
      the sewers where they <lb/> empty into the river at the bathing ghats; a cubic centimetre
      <lb/> of it contained millions of germs; at the end of six hours <lb/> they were <hi
       rend="italic">all dead</hi>. He caught a floating corpse, towed it to <lb/> the shore, and
      from beside it he dipped up water that was <lb/> swarming with cholera germs; at the end of
      six hours they were <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">all dead</hi>. He added swarm after swarm of cholera germs to this <lb/>
      water; within the six hours <hi rend="italic">they always died</hi>, to the last <reg
       orig="sam-|ple">sample</reg>. <lb/> Repeatedly, he took pure well water which was barren <lb/>
      <pb n="500" entity="DSSR_000002496_0515"/> of animal life, and put into it a few cholera
      germs; they always <lb/> began to propagate at once, and always within six hours they <lb/>
      swarmed&mdash;and were <hi rend="italic">numberable by millions upon millions.</hi></p>
     <p>For ages and ages the Hindoos have had absolute faith that <lb/> the water of the Ganges was
      absolutely pure, could not be <lb/> defiled by any contact whatsoever, and infallibly made
      pure <lb/> and clean whatsoever thing touched it. They still believe it, <lb/> and that is why
      they bathe in it and drink it, caring nothing <lb/> for its <hi rend="italic">seeming</hi>
      filthiness and the floating corpses. The Hindoos <lb/> have been laughed at, these many
      generations, but the <reg orig="laugh-|ter">laughter</reg>
      <lb/> will need to modify itself a little from now on. How did <lb/> they find out the water's
      secret in those ancient ages? Had <lb/> they germ-scientists then? We do not know. We only
      know <lb/> that they had a civilization long before we emerged from <lb/> savagery. But to
      return to where I was before; I was about <lb/> to speak of the burning-ghat.</p>
     <p>They do not burn fakeers&mdash;those revered mendicants. <lb/> They are so holy that
      they can get to their place without that <lb/> sacrament, provided they be consigned to the
      consecrating <lb/> river. We saw one carried to mid-stream and thrown <reg orig="over-|board"
       >overboard</reg>. <lb/> He was sandwiched between two great slabs of stone.</p>
     <p>We lay off the cremation-ghat half an hour and saw nine <lb/> corpses burned. I should not
      wish to see any more of it, <lb/> unless I might select the parties. The mourners follow the
      <lb/> bier through the town and down to the ghat; then the <reg orig="bier-|bearers"
       >bier-bearers</reg>
      <lb/> deliver the body to some low-caste natives&mdash;Doms&mdash; <lb/> and the
      mourners turn about and go back home. I heard no <lb/> crying and saw no tears, there was no
      ceremony of parting. <lb/> Apparently, these expressions of grief and affection are reserved
      <lb/> for the privacy of the home. The dead women came draped <lb/> in red, the men in white.
      They are laid in the water at the <lb/> river's edge while the pyre is being prepared.</p>
     <p>The first subject was a man. When the Doms unswathed <lb/>
      <pb n="501" entity="DSSR_000002496_0516"/> him to wash him, he proved to be a sturdily built,
       well-<reg orig="nour-|ished">nourished</reg>
      <lb/> and handsome old gentleman, with not a sign about him <lb/> to suggest that he had ever
      been ill. Dry wood was brought <lb/> and built up into a loose pile; the corpse was laid upon
      it and <lb/> covered over with fuel. <lb/> Then a naked holy man <lb/> who was sitting on high
      <lb/> ground a little distance <lb/> away began to talk and <lb/> shout with great energy,
      <lb/> and he kept up this noise <lb/> right along. It may have <lb/> been the funeral sermon,
      <lb/> and probably was. I <reg orig="for-|got">forgot</reg>
      <lb/> to say that one of the <lb/> mourners remained behind <lb/> when the others went away.
      <lb/> This was the dead man's <lb/> son, a boy of ten or twelve, <lb/> brown and handsome,
      grave <lb/> and self-possessed, and <lb/> clothed in flowing white. <lb/> He was there to burn
      his father. He was given a torch, and <lb/> while he slowly walked seven times around the pyre
      the <lb/> naked black man on the high ground poured out his sermon <lb/> more clamorously than
      ever. The seventh circuit completed, <lb/> the boy applied the torch at his father's head,
      then at his feet; <lb/> the flames sprang briskly up with a sharp crackling noise, and <lb/>
      the lad went away. Hindoos do not want daughters, because <lb/> their weddings make such a
      ruinous expense; but they want <lb/> sons, so that at death they may have honorable exit from
      the <lb/> world; and there is no honor equal to the honor of having <lb/> one's pyre lighted
      by one's son. The father who dies sonless <lb/>
      <figure id="f130" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002496_0516">
       <p>EXTRA EXPENSE.</p>
      </figure>
      <pb n="502" entity="DSSR_000002496_0517"/> is in a grievous situation indeed, and is pitied.
      Life being <lb/> uncertain, the Hindoo marries while he is still a boy, in the <lb/> hope that
      he will have a son ready when the day of his need <lb/> shall come. But if he have no son, he
      will adopt one. This <lb/> answers every purpose.</p>
     <p>Meantime the corpse is burning, also several others. It is a <lb/> dismal business. The
      stokers did not sit down in idleness, but <lb/> moved briskly about, punching up the fires
      with long poles, <lb/> and now and then adding fuel. Sometimes they hoisted the <lb/> half of
      a skeleton into the air, then slammed it down and beat <lb/> it with the pole, breaking it up
      so that it would burn better. <lb/> They hoisted skulls up in the same way and banged and
      <lb/> battered them. The sight was hard to bear; it would have <lb/> been harder if the
      mourners had stayed to witness it. I had <lb/> but a moderate desire to see a cremation, so it
      was soon satisfied. <lb/> For sanitary reasons it would be well if cremation were <reg
       orig="univer-|sal">universal</reg>; <lb/> but this form is revolting, and not to be
      recommended.</p>
     <p>The fire used is sacred, of course&mdash;for there is money in it. <lb/> Ordinary fire
      is forbidden; there is no money in it. I was <lb/> told that this sacred fire is all furnished
      by one person, and <lb/> that he has a monopoly of it and charges a good price for it. <lb/>
      Sometimes a rich mourner pays a thousand rupees for it. To <lb/> get to paradise from India is
      an expensive thing. Every <reg orig="de-|tail">detail</reg>
      <lb/> connected with the matter costs something, and helps to <lb/> fatten a priest. I suppose
      it is quite safe to conclude that that <lb/> fire-bug is in holy orders.</p>
     <p>Close to the cremation-ground stand a few time-worn stones <lb/> which are remembrances of
      the suttee. Each has a rough <lb/> carving upon it, representing a man and a woman standing or
      <lb/> walking hand in hand, and marks the spot where a widow <lb/> went to her death by fire
      in the days when the suttee flourished. <lb/> Mr. Parker said that widows would burn
      themselves now <lb/> if the government would allow it. The family that can point <lb/>
      <pb n="503" entity="DSSR_000002496_0518"/> to one of these little memorials and say: <lb/>
      "She who burned herself there was an <lb/> ancestress of ours," is envied.</p>

      <p>MONKEY ANTICS.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>It is a curious people. With them, all <lb/> life seems to be sacred except human life.
      <lb/> Even the life of vermin is sacred, and must <lb/> not be taken. The good Jain wipes off
      a <lb/> seat before using it, lest he cause the death <lb/> of some valueless insect by
      sitting down on <lb/> it. It grieves him to have to drink water, <lb/> because the provisions
      in his stomach may <lb/> not agree with the microbes. Yet <lb/> India invented Thuggery and
      the <lb/> Suttee. India is a hard country to <lb/> understand.</p>
     <p>We went to the temple of the <lb/> Thug goddess, Bhowance, or Kali, or <lb/> Durga. She has
      these names and <lb/> others. She is the only god to whom <lb/> living sacrifices are made.
      Goats are <lb/> sacrificed to her. Monkeys would <lb/> be cheaper. There are plenty of them
      <lb/> about the place. Being sacred, they <lb/> make themselves very free, and <reg
       orig="scram-|ble">scramble</reg>
      <lb/> around wherever they please. The <lb/> temple and its porch are beautifully <lb/>
      carved, but this is not the case with <lb/> the idol. <reg orig="Bho-|wanee">Bhowanee</reg>
      <lb/> is not <lb/> pleasant to look <lb/> at. She has a <lb/> silver face, and a projecting
      swollen <lb/> tongue painted a deep red. She wears a necklace of skulls.</p>
     <pb n="504" entity="DSSR_000002496_0519"/>
     <p>In fact, none of the idols in Benares are handsome or <lb/> attractive. And what a swarm of
      them there is! The town <lb/> is a vast museum of idols&mdash;and all of them crude,
      misshapen, <lb/> and ugly. They flock through one's dreams at night, a wild <lb/> mob of
      nightmares. When you get tired of them in the <lb/> temples and take a trip on the river, you
      find idol giants, <lb/> flashily painted, stretched out side by side on the shore. And <lb/>
      apparently wherever there is room for one more lingam, a <lb/> lingam is there. If Vishnu had
      foreseen what his town was <lb/> going to be, he would have called it Idolville or Lingamburg.</p>
     <p>The most conspicuous feature of Benares is the pair of <lb/> slender white minarets which
      tower like masts from the great <lb/> Mosque of Aurangzeb. They seem to be always in sight,
      from <lb/> everywhere, those airy, graceful, inspiring things. But masts <lb/> is not the
      right word, for masts have a perceptible taper, while <lb/> these minarets have not. They are
      142 feet high, and only 8 &frac12; <lb/> feet in diameter at the base, and 7 &frac12;
      at the summit&mdash;scarcely <lb/> any taper at all. These are the proportions of a
      candle; and <lb/> fair and fairy-like candles these are. Will be, anyway, some <lb/> day, when
      the Christians inherit them and top them with the <lb/> electric light. There is a great view
      from up there&mdash;a <reg orig="wonder-|ful">wonderful</reg>
      <lb/> view. A large gray monkey was part of it, and damaged <lb/> it. A monkey has no
      judgment. This one was skipping about <lb/> the upper great heights of the
      mosque&mdash;skipping across empty <lb/> yawning intervals which were almost too wide for
      him, and <lb/> which he only just barely cleared, each time, by the skin of his <lb/> teeth.
      He got me so nervous that I couldn't look at the view. <lb/> I couldn't look at anything but
      him. Every time he went <lb/> sailing over one of those abysses my breath stood still, and
      <lb/> when he grabbed for the perch he was going for, I grabbed <lb/> too, in sympathy. And he
      was perfectly indifferent, perfectly <lb/> unconcerned, and I did all the panting myself. He
      came <lb/> within an ace of losing his life a dozen times, and I was so <lb/> troubled about
      him that I would have shot him if I had had <lb/>
      <pb n="505" entity="DSSR_000002496_0520"/> anything to do it with. But I strongly recommend
      the view. <lb/> There is more monkey than view, and there is always going to <lb/> be more
      monkey while that idiot survives, but what view you <lb/> get is superb. All Benares, the
      river, and the region round <lb/> about are spread before you. Take a gun, and look at the
      view.</p>
     <p>The next thing I saw was more reposeful. It was a new <lb/> kind of art. It was a picture
      painted on water. It was done <lb/> by a native. He sprinkled fine dust of various colors on
      the <lb/> still surface of a basin of water, and out of these sprinklings a <lb/> dainty and
      pretty picture gradually grew, a picture which <lb/> a breath could destroy. Somehow it was
      impressive, after so <lb/> much browsing among massive and battered and decaying <lb/> fanes
      that rest upon ruins, and those ruins upon still other <lb/> ruins, and those upon still
      others again. It was a sermon, <lb/> an allegory, a symbol of Instability. Those creations in
      <lb/> stone were only a kind of water pictures, after all.</p>
     <p>A prominent episode in the Indian career of Warren <reg orig="Hast-|ings">Hastings</reg>
      <lb/> had Benares for its theater. Wherever that <reg orig="extraordi-|nary">extraordinary</reg>
      <lb/> man set his foot, he left his mark. He came to Benares <lb/> in 1781 to collect a fine
      of &pound;500,000 which he had levied upon <lb/> its Rajah, Cheit Singh, on behalf of the
      East India Company. <lb/> Hastings was a long way from home and help. There were, <lb/>
      probably, not a dozen Englishmen within reach; the Rajah <lb/> was in his fort with his
      myriads around him. But no matter. <lb/> From his little camp in a neighboring garden,
      Hastings sent a <lb/> party to arrest the sovereign. He sent on this daring mission <lb/> a
      couple of hundred native soldiers&mdash;sepoys&mdash;under <reg orig="com-|mand"
       >command</reg>
      <lb/> of three young English lieutenants. The Rajah <reg orig="sub-|mitted">submitted</reg>
      <lb/> without a word. The incident lights up the Indian <lb/> situation electrically, and
      gives one a vivid sense of the strides <lb/> which the English had made and the mastership
      they had <lb/> acquired in the land since the date of Clive's great victory. <lb/> In a
      quarter of a century, from being nobodies, and feared by <lb/> none, they were become
      confessed lords and masters, feared by <lb/>
      <pb n="506" entity="DSSR_000002496_0521"/> all, sovereigns included, and served by all,
      sovereigns included. <lb/> It makes the fairy tales sound true. The English had not <lb/> been
      afraid to enlist native soldiers to fight against their own <lb/> people and keep them
      obedient. And now Hastings was not <lb/> afraid to come away out to this remote place with a
      handful <lb/> of such soldiers and send them to arrest a native sovereign.</p>
     <p>The lieutenants imprisoned the Rajah in his own fort. It <lb/> was beautiful, the pluckiness
      of it, the impudence of it. The <lb/> arrest enraged the Rajah's people, and all Benares came
      <lb/> storming about the place and threatening vengeance. And <lb/> yet, but for an accident,
      nothing important would have <lb/> resulted, perhaps. The mob found out a most strange thing,
      <lb/> an almost incredible thing&mdash;that this handful of soldiers had <lb/> come on
      this hardy errand with empty guns and no <reg orig="ammuni-|tion">ammunition</reg>. <lb/> This
      has been attributed to thoughtlessness, but it could <lb/> hardly have been that, for in such
      large emergencies as this, <lb/> intelligent people <hi rend="italic">do</hi> think. It must
      have been indifference, <lb/> an over-confidence born of the proved submissiveness of the
      <lb/> native character, when confronted by even one or two stern <lb/> Britons in their war
      paint. But, however that may be, it was <lb/> a fatal discovery that the mob had made. They
      were full of <lb/> courage, now, and they broke into the fort and massacred the <lb/> helpless
      soldiers and their officers. Hastings escaped from <lb/> Benares by night and got safely away,
      leaving the principality <lb/> in a state of wild insurrection; but he was back again within
      <lb/> the month, and quieted it down in his prompt and virile way, <lb/> and took the Rajah's
      throne away from him and gave it to <lb/> another man. He was a capable kind of person was
      Warren <lb/> Hastings. This was the only time he was ever out of <reg orig="ammu-|nition"
       >ammunition</reg>. <lb/> Some of his acts have left stains upon his name which <lb/> can
      never be washed away, but he saved to England the <lb/> Indian Empire, and that was the best
      service that was ever <lb/> done to the Indians themselves, those wretched heirs of a <reg
       orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg>
      <lb/> centuries of pitiless oppression and abuse.</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was in Benares that I saw another living god. That <lb/> makes
      two. I believe I have seen most of the greater and <lb/> lesser wonders of the world, but I do
      not remember that <lb/> any of them interested me so overwhelmingly as did that pair <lb/> of
      gods.</p>
     <p>When I try to account for this effect I find no difficulty <lb/> about it. I find that, as a
      rule, when a thing is a wonder to <lb/> us it is not because of what <hi rend="italic">we</hi>
      see in it, but because of what <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">others</hi> have seen in it. We get almost all our wonders at <reg
       orig="sec-|ond">second</reg>
      <lb/> hand. We are eager to see any celebrated thing&mdash;and we <lb/> never fail of our
      reward; just the deep privilege of gazing <lb/> upon an object which has stirred the
      enthusiasm or evoked the <lb/> reverence or affection or admiration of multitudes of our race
      <lb/> is a thing which we value; we are profoundly glad that we <lb/> have seen it, we are
      permanently enriched from having seen <lb/> it, we would not part with the memory of that
      experience for <lb/> a great price. And yet that very spectacle may be the <hi rend="italic"
       >Taj. </hi>
      <lb/> You cannot keep your enthusiasms down, you cannot keep <lb/> your emotions within bounds
      when that soaring bubble of <lb/> marble breaks upon your view. But these are not <hi
       rend="italic">your</hi>
      <reg orig="enthu-|siasms">enthusiasms</reg>
      <lb/> and emotions&mdash;they are the accumulated emotions and <lb/> enthusiasms of a
      thousand fervid writers, who have been slowly <lb/> and steadily storing them up in your heart
      day by day and <lb/> year by year all your life; and now they burst out in a flood <lb/> and
      overwhelm you; and you could not be a whit happier if <lb/>
      <pb n="508" entity="DSSR_000002496_0523"/> they were your very own. By and by you sober down,
      and then <lb/> you perceive that you have been drunk on the smell of <reg orig="some-|body"
       >somebody</reg>
      <lb/> else's cork. For ever and ever the memory of my <reg orig="dis-|tant">distant</reg>
      <lb/> first glimpse of the Taj will compensate me for creeping <lb/> around the globe to have
      that great privilege.</p>
     <p>But the Taj&mdash;with all your inflation of delusive emotions, <lb/> acquired at
      second-hand from people to whom in the majority <lb/> of cases they were also delusions
      acquired at second-hand&mdash;a <lb/> thing which you fortunately did not think of or it
      might have <lb/> made you doubtful of what you imagined were your own&mdash; <lb/> what
      is the Taj as a marvel, a spectacle and an uplifting and <lb/> overpowering wonder, compared
      with a living, breathing, <lb/> speaking personage whom several millions of human beings <lb/>
      devoutly and sincerely and unquestioningly believe to be a <lb/> God, and humbly and
      gratefully worship as a God?</p>
     <p>He was sixty years old when I saw him. He is called Sri <lb/> 108 Swami Bhaskarananda
      Saraswati. That is one form of it. <lb/> I think that that is what you would call him in
      speaking to <lb/> him&mdash;because it is short. But you would use more of his name <lb/>
      in addressing a letter to him; courtesy would require this. Even <lb/> then you would not have
      to use all of it, but only this much:</p>
     <p>
      <hi rend="italic">Sri 108 Matparamahansapariv <reg
        orig="ajakacharyaswamibhaskar-|anandasaraswati"
       >ajakacharyaswamibhaskaranandasaraswati</reg>.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>You do not put "Esq." after it, for that is not necessary.</p>
     <p>The word which opens the volley is itself a title of honor&mdash; <lb/> "Sri." The
      "108" stands for the rest of his names, I believe. <lb/> Vishnu has 108 names which he does
      not use in business, and <lb/> no doubt it is a custom of gods and a privilege sacred to their
      <lb/> order to keep 108 extra ones in stock. Just the restricted <lb/> name set down above is
      a handsome property, without the 108. <lb/> By my count it has 58 letters in it. This removes
      the long <lb/> German words from competition; they are permanently out of <lb/> the race.</p>
     <pb n="509" entity="DSSR_000002496_0524"/>
     <p>Sri 108 S. B. Saraswati has attained to what among the <lb/> Hindoos is called the "state of
      perfection." It is a state which <lb/> other Hindoos reach by being born again and again, and
      over <lb/> and over again into this world, through one re-incarnation <lb/> after
      another&mdash;a tiresome long job covering centuries and <lb/> decades of centuries, and
      one that is full of risks, too, like <lb/> the accident of dying on the wrong side of the
      Ganges some <lb/> time or other and waking up in the form of an ass, with a fresh <lb/> start
      necessary and the numerous trips to be made all over <lb/> again. But in reaching perfection,
      Sri 108 S. B. S. has escaped <lb/> all that. He is no longer a part or a feature of this
      world; his substance has changed, all earthiness has departed out of it; <lb/> he is utterly
      holy, utterly pure; nothing can desecrate this <lb/> holiness or stain this purity; he is no
      longer of the earth, its <lb/> concerns are matters foreign to him, its pains and griefs and
      <lb/> troubles cannot reach him. When he dies, Nirvana is his; he <lb/> will be absorbed into
      the substance of the Supreme Deity and <lb/> be at peace forever.</p>
     <p>The Hindoo Scriptures point out how this state is to be <lb/> reached, but it is only once
      in a thousand years, perhaps, that <lb/> candidate accomplishes it. This one has traversed the
      course <lb/> required, stage by stage, from the beginning to the end, and <lb/> now has
      nothing left to do but wait for the call which shall <lb/> release him from a world in which
      he has now no part nor lot. <lb/> First, he passed through the student stage, and became
      learned <lb/> in the holy books. Next he became citizen, householder, <reg orig="hus-|band"
       >husband</reg>, <lb/> and father. That was the required second stage. Then <lb/>
      &mdash;like John Bunyan's Christian&mdash;he bade perpetual good-bye <lb/> to his
      family, as required, and went wandering away. He <lb/> went far into the desert and served a
      term as hermit. Next, <lb/> he became a beggar, "in accordance with the rites laid down <lb/>
      in the Scriptures," and wandered about India eating the bread <lb/> of mendicancy. A quarter
      of a century ago he reached the <lb/>
      <pb n="510" entity="DSSR_000002496_0525"/> stage of purity. This needs no garment; its symbol
      is nudity; <lb/> he discarded the waist-cloth which he had previously worn. <lb/> He could
      resume it now if he chose, for neither that nor any <lb/> other contact can defile him; but he
      does not choose.</p>
     <p>There are several other stages, I believe, but I do not <reg orig="re-|member">remember</reg>
      <lb/> what they are. But he has been through them. <lb/> Throughout the long course he was
      perfecting himself in holy <lb/> learning, and writing commentaries upon the sacred books.
      <lb/> He was also meditating upon Brahma, and he does that now.</p>
     <p>White marble relief-portraits of him are sold all about <lb/> India. He lives in a good
      house in a noble great garden in <lb/> Benares, all meet and proper to his stupendous rank.
       <reg orig="Neces-|sarily">Necessarily</reg>
      <lb/> he does not go abroad in the streets. Deities would <lb/> never be able to move about
      handily in any country. If one <lb/> whom we recognized and adored as a god should go abroad
      in <lb/> our streets, and the day it was to happen were known, all <lb/> traffic would be
      blocked and business would come to a <reg orig="stand-|still">standstill</reg>.</p>
     <p>This god is comfortably housed, and yet modestly, all <lb/> things considered, for if he
      wanted to live in a palace he would <lb/> only need to speak and his worshipers would gladly
      build it. <lb/> Sometimes he sees devotees for a moment, and comforts them <lb/> and blesses
      them, and they kiss his feet and go away happy. <lb/> Rank is nothing to him, he being a god.
      To him all men are <lb/> alike. He sees whom he pleases and denies himself to whom <lb/> he
      pleases. Sometimes he sees a prince and denies himself to <lb/> a pauper; at other times he
      receives the pauper and turns the <lb/> prince away. However, he does not receive many of
      either <lb/> class. He has to husband his time for his meditations. I <lb/> think he would
      receive Rev. Mr. Parker at any time. I think <lb/> he is sorry for Mr. Parker, and I think Mr.
      Parker is sorry for <lb/> him; and no doubt this compassion is good for both of them.</p>
     <p>When we arrived we had to stand around in the garden a <lb/>
      <pb n="511" entity="DSSR_000002496_0526"/> little while and wait, and the outlook was not
      good, for he had <lb/> been turning away Maharajas that day and receiving only the <lb/>
      riff-raff, and we belonged in between, somewhere. But <reg orig="pres-|ently">presently</reg>,
      <lb/> a servant came out saying it was all right, he was coming.</p>
     <p>And sure enough, he came, and I saw him&mdash;that object of <lb/> the worship of
      millions. It was a strange sensation, and <lb/> thrilling. I wish I could feel it stream
      through my veins <lb/> again. And yet, to me he was not a god, he was only a Taj. <lb/> The
      thrill was not my thrill, but had come to me secondhand <lb/> from those invisible millions of
      believers. By a hand-shake <lb/> with their god I had ground-circuited their wire and got
      their <lb/> monster battery's whole charge.</p>
     <p>He was tall and slender, indeed emaciated. He had a clean <lb/> cut and conspicuously
      intellectual face, and a deep and kindly <lb/> eye. He looked many years older than he really
      was, but <lb/> much study and meditation and fasting and prayer, with the <lb/> arid life he
      had led as hermit and beggar, could account for <lb/> that. He is wholly nude when he receives
      natives, of whatever <lb/> rank they may be, but he had white cloth around his loins now,
      <lb/> a concession to Mr. Parker's Europe prejudices, no doubt.</p>
     <p>As soon as I had sobered down a little we got along very <lb/> well together, and I found
      him a most pleasant and friendly <lb/> deity. He had heard a deal about Chicago, and showed a
      <lb/> quite remarkable interest in it, for a god. It all came of the <lb/> World's Fair and
      the Congress of Religions. If India knows <lb/> about nothing else American, she knows about
      those, and will <lb/> keep them in mind one while.</p>
     <p>He proposed an exchange of autographs, a delicate <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg>
      <lb/> which made me believe in him, but I had been having my <lb/> doubts before. He wrote his
      in his book, and I have a <reg orig="rever-|ent">reverent</reg>
      <lb/> regard for that book, though the words run from right to <lb/> left, and so I can't read
      it. It was a mistake to print in that <lb/> way. It contains his voluminous comments on the
      Hindoo <lb/>
      <pb n="512" entity="DSSR_000002496_0527"/> holy writings, and if I could make them out I would
      try for <lb/> perfection myself. I gave him a copy of Huckleberry Finn. <lb/> I thought it
      might rest him up a little to mix it in along with <lb/> his meditations on Brahma, for he
      looked tired, and I knew <lb/> that if it didn't do him any good it wouldn't do him any harm.</p>

     <p>Dear me! It is a strange <lb/> world. Particularly the Indian <lb/> division of it. This
      pupil, Mina <lb/> Bahadur Rana, is not a <reg orig="com-|monplace">commonplace</reg>
      <lb/> person, but a man <lb/> of distinguished capacities and <lb/> attainments, and,
      apparently, <lb/> he had a fine worldly career in <lb/> front of him. He was serving <lb/> the
      Nepal Government in a <lb/> high capacity at the Court of <lb/> the Viceroy of India, twenty
      <lb/> years ago. He was an able <lb/> man, educated, a thinker, a man <lb/> of property. But
      the longing <lb/> to devote himself to a religious life came upon him, and he <lb/> resigned
      his place, turned his back upon the vanities and <reg orig="com-|forts">comforts</reg>
      <lb/> of the world, and went away into the solitudes to live in <lb/> a hut and study the
      sacred writings and meditate upon virtue <lb/> and holiness and seek to attain them. This sort
      of religion <lb/> resembles ours. Christ recommended the rich to give away <lb/> all their
      property and follow Him in poverty, not in worldly <lb/> comfort. American and English
      millionaires do it every <lb/> day, and thus verify and confirm to the world the <reg
       orig="tremend-|ous">tremendous</reg>
      <lb/> forces that lie in religion. Yet many people scoff at <lb/> them for this loyalty to
      duty, and many will scoff at Mina <lb/> Bahadur Rana and call him a crank. Like many
      Christians <lb/> of great character and intellect, he has made the study <lb/> of his
      Scriptures and the writing of books of commentaries <lb/>
      <pb n="514" entity="DSSR_000002496_0529"/> upon them the loving labor of his life. Like them,
      he has <lb/> believed that his was not an idle and foolish waste of his life, <lb/> but a most
      worthy and honorable employment of it. Yet, <lb/> there are many people who will see in those
      others, men <lb/> worthy of homage and deep reverence, but in him merely a <lb/> crank. But I
      shall not. He has my reverence. And I don't <lb/> offer it as a common thing and poor, but as
      an unusual thing <lb/> and of value. The ordinary reverence, the reverence defined <lb/> and
      explained by the dictionary costs nothing. Reverence <lb/> for one's own sacred
      things&mdash;parents, religion, flag, laws, and <lb/> respect for one's own
      beliefs&mdash;these are feelings which we <lb/> cannot even help. They come natural to
      us; they are <reg orig="invol-|untary">involuntary</reg>, <lb/> like breathing. There is no
      personal merit in <reg orig="breath-|ing">breathing</reg>. <lb/> But the reverence which is
      difficult, and which has <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg>
      <lb/> merit in it, is the respect which you pay, without <reg orig="com-|pulsion"
      >compulsion</reg>, <lb/> to the political or religious attitude of a man whose <lb/> beliefs
      are not yours. You can't revere his gods or his politics, <lb/> and no one expects you to do
      that, but you could respect his <lb/> belief in them if you tried hard enough; and you could
      <lb/> respect <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, too, if you tried hard enough. But it is very, <lb/>
      very difficult; it is next to impossible, and so we hardly ever <lb/> try. If the man doesn't
      believe as we do, we say he is a <lb/> crank, and that settles it. I mean it does nowadays,
      because <lb/> now we can't burn him.</p>
     <p>We are always canting about people's "irreverence," always <lb/> charging this offense upon
      somebody or other, and thereby <lb/> intimating that we are better than that person and do not
      <lb/> commit that offense ourselves. Whenever we do this we are <lb/> in a lying attitude, and
      our speech is cant; for none of us are <lb/> reverent&mdash;in a meritorious way; deep
      down in our hearts we <lb/> are all irreverent. There is probably not a single exception to
      <lb/> this rule in the earth. There is probably not one person whose <lb/> reverence rises

     <p>"Yesterday a visiting party of the British nobility had a <lb/> picnic at Mount Vernon, and
      in the tomb of Washington they <lb/> ate their luncheon, sang popular songs, played games, and

     <p>Should we be shocked? Should we feel outraged? Should <lb/> we be amazed? Should we call the

     <p>And suppose we found this paragraph in the newspapers:</p>
     <p>"Yesterday a visiting party of American pork-millionaires <lb/> had a picnic in Westminster
      Abbey, and in that sacred place <lb/> they ate their luncheon, sang popular songs, played
      games, and <lb/> danced waltzes and polkas."</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">A comfortable</hi> railway journey of seventeen and a <lb/> half hours
      brought us to the capital of India, which is <lb/> likewise the capital of
      Bengal&mdash;Calcutta. Like <reg orig="Bom-|bay">Bombay</reg>, <lb/> it has a population
      of nearly a million natives and a small <lb/> gathering of white people. It is a huge city and
      fine, and is <lb/> called the City of Palaces. It is rich in historical memories; <lb/> rich
      in British achievement&mdash;military, political, commercial; <lb/> rich in the results
      of the miracles done by that brace of <lb/> mighty magicians, Clive and Hastings. And has a
       <reg orig="cloud-|kissing">cloud-kissing</reg>
      <lb/> monument to one Ochterlony.</p>
     <p>It is a fluted candlestick 250 feet high. This lingam is the <lb/> only large monument in
      Calcutta, I believe. It is a fine <lb/> ornament, and will keep Ochterlony in mind.</p>
     <p>Wherever you are, in Calcutta, and for miles around, you <lb/> can see it; and always when
      you see it you think of <reg orig="Ochter-|lony">Ochterlony</reg>. <lb/> And so there is not
      an hour in the day that you do not <lb/> think of Ochterlony and wonder who he was. It is good
      that <lb/> Clive cannot come back, for he would think it was for Plassey; <lb/> and then that
      great spirit would be wounded when the revelation <lb/> came that it was not. Clive would find
      out that it was for <lb/> Ochterlony; and he would think Ochterlony was a battle. <lb/> And he
      would think it was a great one, too, and he would say, <lb/> "With three thousand I whipped
      sixty thousand and founded <lb/> the Empire&mdash;and there is no monument; this other
      soldier must <lb/> have whipped a billion with a dozen and saved the world."</p>
     <pb n="518" entity="DSSR_000002496_0533"/>
     <p>But he would be mistaken. Ochterlony was a man, not a <lb/> battle. And he did good and
      honorable service, too; as good <lb/> and honorable service as has been done in India by <reg
       orig="seventy-|five">seventy-five</reg>
      <lb/> or a hundred other Englishmen of courage, rectitude, and <lb/> distinguished capacity.
      For India has been a fertile <reg orig="breeding-|ground">breeding-ground</reg>
      <lb/> of such men, and remains so; great men, both in war <lb/> and in the civil service, and
      as modest as great. But they <lb/> have no monuments, and were not expecting any. <reg
       orig="Ochter-|lony">Ochterlony</reg>
      <lb/> could not have been expecting one, and it is not at all <lb/> likely that he desired
      one&mdash;certainly not until Clive and <lb/> Hastings should be supplied. Every day
      Clive and Hastings <lb/> lean on the battlements of heaven and look down and wonder <lb/>
      which of the two the monument is for; and they fret and <lb/> worry because they cannot find
      out, and so the peace of <lb/> heaven is spoiled for them and lost. But not for Ochterlony.
      <lb/> Ochterlony is not troubled. He doesn't suspect that it is his <lb/> monument. Heaven is
      sweet and peaceful to him. There is a <lb/> sort of unfairness about it all.</p>
     <p>Indeed, if monuments were always given in India for high <lb/> achievements, duty straitly
      performed, and smirchless records, <lb/> the landscape would be monotonous with them. The
      handful <lb/> of English in India govern the Indian myriads with apparent <lb/> ease, and
      without noticeable friction, through tact, training, <lb/> and distinguished administrative
      ability, reinforced by just and <lb/> liberal laws&mdash;and by keeping their word to the
      native <reg orig="when-|ever">whenever</reg>
      <lb/> they give it.</p>
     <p>England is far from India and knows little about the <lb/> eminent services performed by her
      servants there, for it is the <lb/> newspaper correspondent who makes fame, and he is not sent
      <lb/> to India but to the continent, to report the doings of the <lb/> princelets and the
      dukelets, and where they are visiting and <lb/> whom they are marrying. Often a British
      official spends <lb/> thirty or forty years in India, climbing from grade to grade <lb/>
      <pb n="519" entity="DSSR_000002496_0534"/> by services which would make him celebrated
      anywhere else, <lb/> and finishes as a vice-sovereign, governing a great realm and <lb/>
      millions of subjects; then he goes home to England <reg orig="substanti-|ally">substantially</reg>
      <lb/> unknown and unheard of, and settles down in some <lb/> modest corner, and is as one
      extinguished. Ten years later <lb/> there is a twenty-line obituary in the London papers, and
      the <lb/> reader is paralyzed by the splendors of a career which he is <lb/> not sure that he
      had ever heard of before. But meanwhile he <lb/> has learned all about the continental
      princelets and dukelets.</p>
     <p>The average man is profoundly ignorant of countries that <lb/> lie remote from his own. When
      they are mentioned in his <lb/> presence one or two facts and maybe a couple of names rise
      <lb/> like torches in his mind, lighting up an inch or two of it and <lb/> leaving the rest
      all dark. The mention of Egypt suggests <lb/> some Biblical facts and the
      Pyramids&mdash;nothing more. The <lb/> mention of South Africa suggests Kimberly and the
      diamonds <lb/> and there an end. Formerly the mention, to a Hindoo, of <lb/> America suggested
      a name&mdash;George Washington&mdash;with that <lb/> his familiarity with our
      country was exhausted. Latterly his <lb/> familiarity with it has doubled in bulk; so that
      when America <lb/> is mentioned now, two torches flare up in the dark caverns of <lb/> his
      mind and he says, "Ah, the country of the great man&mdash; <lb/> Washington; and of the
      Holy City&mdash;Chicago." For he <lb/> knows about the Congress of Religion, and this has
      enabled <lb/> him to get an erroneous impression of Chicago.</p>
     <p>When India is mentioned to the citizen of a far country it <lb/> suggests Clive, Hastings,
      the Mutiny, Kipling, and a number <lb/> of other great events; and the mention of Calcutta
      infallibly <lb/> brings up the Black Hole. And so, when that citizen finds <lb/> himself in
      the capital of India he goes first of all to see the <lb/> Black Hole of
      Calcutta&mdash;and is disappointed.</p>
     <p>The Black Hole was not preserved; it is gone, long, long <lb/> ago. It is strange. Just as
      it stood, it was itself a monu-</p>
     <pb n="520" entity="DSSR_000002496_0535"/>
     <p>ment; a ready-made one. It was finished, it was complete, its <lb/> materials were strong
      and lasting, it needed no furbishing up, <lb/> no repairs; it merely needed to be let alone.
      It was the first <lb/> brick, the Foundation Stone, upon which was reared a mighty <lb/>
      Empire&mdash;the Indian Empire of Great Britain. It was the <lb/> ghastly episode of the
      Black Hole that maddened the British <lb/> and brought Clive, that young military marvel,
      raging up from <lb/> Madras; it was the seed from which sprung Plassey; and it <lb/> was that
      extraordinary battle, whose like had not been seen in <lb/> the earth since Agincourt, that
      laid deep and strong the <lb/> foundations of England's colossal Indian sovereignty.</p>
     <p>And yet within the time of men who still live, the Black <lb/> Hole was torn down and thrown
      away as carelessly as if its <lb/> bricks were common clay, not ingots of historic gold. There
      <lb/> is no accounting for human beings.</p>
     <p>The supposed site of the Black Hole is marked by an <reg orig="en-|graved">engraved</reg>
      <lb/> plate. I saw that; and better that than nothing. <lb/> The Black Hole was a
       prison&mdash;<hi rend="italic">a cell</hi> is nearer the right word <lb/>
      &mdash;eighteen feet square, the dimensions of an ordinary <reg orig="bed-|chamber"
       >bed-chamber</reg>; <lb/> and into this place the victorious Nabob of Bengal <lb/> packed 146
      of his English prisoners. There was hardly standing <lb/> room for them; scarcely a breath of
      air was to be got; the <lb/> time was night, the weather sweltering hot. Before the dawn <lb/>
      came, the captives were all dead but twenty-three. Mr. <lb/> Holwell's long account of the
      awful episode was familiar to <lb/> the world a hundred years ago, but one seldom sees in
      print <lb/> even an extract from it in our day. Among the striking <lb/> things in it is this.
      Mr. Holwell, perishing with thirst, kept <lb/> himself alive by sucking the perspiration from
      his sleeves. It <lb/> gives one a vivid idea of the situation. He presently found <lb/> that
      while he was busy drawing life from one of his sleeves a <lb/> young English gentleman was
      stealing supplies from the other <lb/> one. Holwell was an unselfish man, a man of the most
       <reg orig="gen-|erous">generous</reg>
      <lb/>
      <pb n="521" entity="DSSR_000002496_0536"/> impulses; he lived and died famous for these fine
      and <lb/> rare qualities; yet when he found out what was happening to <lb/> that unwatched
      sleeve, he took the precaution to suck that <lb/> one dry first. The miseries of the Black
      Hole were able to <lb/> change even a nature like his. But that young gentleman <lb/> was one
      of the twenty-three survivors, and he said it was the <lb/> stolen perspiration that saved his
      life. From the middle of <lb/> Mr. Holwell's narrative I will make a brief excerpt:</p>
     <p>"Then a general prayer to Heaven, to hasten the approach of the flames <lb/> to the right
      and left of us, and put a period to our misery. But these failing, <lb/> they whose strength
      and spirits were quite exhausted laid themselves down <lb/> and expired quietly upon their
      fellows: others who had yet some strength <lb/> and vigor left made a last effort at the
      windows, and several succeeded by <lb/> leaping and scrambling over the backs and heads of
      those in the first rank, <lb/> and got hold of the bars, from which there was no removing
      them. Many to <lb/> the right and left sunk with the violent pressure, and were soon
      suffocated; <lb/> for now a steam arose from the living and the dead, which affected us in all
      <lb/> its circumstances as if we were forcibly held with our heads over a bowl full <lb/> of
      strong volatile spirit of hartshorn, until suffocated; nor could the effluvia <lb/> of the one
      be distinguished from the other, and frequently, when I was forced <lb/> by the load upon my
      head and shoulders to hold my face down, I was obliged, <lb/> near as I was to the window,
      instantly to raise it again to avoid suffocation. I <lb/> need not, my dear friend, ask your
      commiseration, when I tell you, that in this <lb/> plight, from half an hour past eleven till
      near two in the morning, I sustained <lb/> the weight of a heavy man, with his knees in my
      back, and the pressure of <lb/> his whole body on my head. A Dutch surgeon who had taken his
      seat upon <lb/> my left shoulder, and a Topaz (a black Christian soldier)
      bearing on my <lb/> right; all which nothing could have enabled me to support but the props
      and <lb/> pressure equally sustaining me all around. The two latter I frequently <reg
       orig="dis-|lodged">dislodged</reg>
      <lb/> by shifting my hold on the bars and driving my knuckles into their <lb/> ribs; but my
      friend above stuck fast, held immovable by two bars.</p>
     <p>"I exerted anew my strength and fortitude; but the repeated trials and <lb/> efforts I made
      to dislodge the insufferable incumbrances upon me at last <lb/> quite exhausted me; and
      towards two o'clock, finding I must quit the window <lb/> or sink where I was, I resolved on
      the former, having bore, truly for the sake <lb/> of others, infinitely more for life than the
      best of it is worth. In the rank <lb/> close behind me was an officer of one of the ships,
      whose name was Cary, and <lb/> who had behaved with much bravery during the siege
      (his wife, a fine <lb/> woman, though country born, would not quit him, but
      accompanied him into <lb/> the prison, and was one who survived). This poor wretch
      had been long <reg orig="rav-|ing">raving</reg>
      <lb/> for water and air; I told him I was determined to give up life, and <lb/> recommended
      his gaining my station. On my quitting it he made a fruitless <lb/> attempt to get my place;
      but the Dutch surgeon, who sat on my shoulder, <lb/> supplanted him. Poor Cary expressed his
      thankfulness, and said he would <lb/>
      <pb n="522" entity="DSSR_000002496_0537"/> give up life too; but it was with the utmost labor
      we forced our way from <lb/> the window (several in the inner ranks appearing to me
      dead standing, unable <lb/> to fall by the throng and equal pressure around). He laid
      himself down to <lb/> die; and his death, I believe, was very sudden; for he was a short,
      full, <reg orig="san-|guine">sanguine</reg>
      <lb/> man. His strength was great; and, I imagine, had he not retired with <lb/> me, I should
      never have been able to force my way. I was at this time <reg orig="sen-|sible">sensible</reg>
      <lb/> of no pain, and little uneasiness; I can give you no better idea of my <lb/> situation
      than by repeating my simile of the bowl of spirit of hartshorn. I <lb/> found a stupor coming
      on apace, and laid myself down by that gallant old <lb/> man, the Rev. Mr. Jervas Bellamy, who
      laid dead with his son, the lieutenant, <lb/> hand in hand, near the southernmost wall of the
      prison. When I had lain <lb/> there some little time, I still had reflection enough to suffer
      some uneasiness <lb/> in the thought that I should be trampled upon, when dead, as I myself
      had <lb/> done to others. With some difficulty I raised myself, and gained the <reg
       orig="plat-|form">platform</reg>
      <lb/> a second time, where I presently lost all sensation; the last trace of <reg
       orig="sen-|sibility">sensibility</reg>
      <lb/> that I have been able to recollect after my laying down, was my sash <lb/> being uneasy
      about my waist, which I untied, and threw from me. Of what <lb/> passed in this interval, to
      the time of my resurrection from this hole of <reg orig="hor-|rows">horrows</reg>, <lb/> I can
      give you no account."</p>
     <p>There was plenty to see in Calcutta, but there was not <lb/> plenty of time for it. I saw
      the fort that Clive built; and the <lb/> place where Warren Hastings and the author of the
      Junius <lb/> Letters fought their duel; and the great botanical gardens; <lb/> and the
      fashionable afternoon turnout in the Maidan; and a <lb/> grand review of the garrison in a
      great plain at sunrise; and a <lb/> military tournament in which great bodies of native
      soldiery <lb/> exhibited the perfection of their drill at all arms, a spectacular <lb/> and
      beautiful show occupying several nights and closing with the <lb/> mimic storming of a native
      fort which was as good as the reality <lb/> for thrilling and accurate detail, and better than
      the reality for <lb/> security and comfort; we had a pleasure excursion on the <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">Hoogly</hi> by courtesy of friends, and devoted the rest of the time <lb/>
      to social life and the Indian museum. One should spend a <lb/> month in the museum, an
      enchanted palace of Indian antiquities. <lb/> Indeed, a person might spend half a year among
      the beautiful <lb/> and wonderful things without exhausting their interest.</p>
     <p>It was winter. We were of Kipling's "hosts of tourists <lb/> who travel up and down India in
      the cold weather showing <lb/>
      <pb n="523" entity="DSSR_000002496_0538"/> how things ought to be managed." It is a common
      expression <lb/> there, "the cold weather," and the people think there is such <lb/> a thing.
      It is because they have lived there half a lifetime, <lb/> and their perceptions have become
      blunted. When a person is <lb/> accustomed to 138 in the shade, his ideas about cold weather
      <lb/> are not valuable. I had read, in the histories, that the June <lb/> marches made between
      Lucknow and Cawnpore by the British <lb/> forces in the time of the Mutiny were made in that
      kind of <lb/> weather&mdash;138 in the shade&mdash;and had taken it for historical
      <lb/> embroidery. I had read it again in <reg orig="Serjeant-|Major">Serjeant-Major</reg>
      <lb/> Forbes-Mitchell's account of his <reg orig="mili-|tary">military</reg>
      <lb/> experiences in the Mutiny&mdash;at least I <lb/> thought I had&mdash;and in
      Calcutta I asked him <lb/> if it was true, and he said it was. An officer <lb/> of high rank
      who had been in the thick of the <lb/> Mutiny said the same. As long as those men <lb/> were
      talking about what they knew, they <lb/> were trustworthy, and I believed them; but <lb/> when
      they said it was now "cold weather," I <lb/> saw that they had traveled outside of their <lb/>
      sphere of knowledge and were floundering. <lb/> I believe that in India "cold weather" is
      <lb/> merely a conventional phrase and has come <lb/> into use through the necessity of having
      some <lb/> way to distinguish between weather which <lb/> will melt a brass door-knob and
      weather <lb/> which will only make it mushy. It was <lb/> observable that brass ones were in
      use while I was in Calcutta, <lb/> showing that it was not yet time to change to porcelain; I
      was <lb/> told the change to porcelain was not usually made until May. <lb/> But this cold
      weather was too warm for us; so we started to <lb/> Darjeeling, in the Himalayas&mdash;a
      twenty-four hour journey.</p>

      few years ago I spent several weeks at T&ouml;lz, in Bavaria. It <lb/> is a Roman
      Catholic region, and not even Benares is more <lb/> deeply or pervasively or intelligently
      devout. In my diary of <lb/> those days I find this:</p>
     <p>"We took a long drive yesterday around about the lovely country roads. <lb/> But it was a
      drive whose pleasure was damaged in a couple of ways: by the <lb/> dreadful shrines and by the
      shameful spectacle of gray and vencrable old <lb/> grandmothers toiling in the fields. The
      shrines were frequent along the <lb/> roads&mdash;figures of the Saviour nailed to the
      cross and streaming with blood <lb/> from the wounds of the nails and the thorns.</p>
     <p>"When missionaries go from here do they find fault with the pagan <lb/> idols? I saw many
      women seventy and even eighty years old mowing and <lb/> binding in the fields, and
      pitchforking the loads into the wagons."</p>
     <p>I was in Austria later, and in Munich. In Munich I saw <lb/> gray old women pushing trucks
      up hill and down, long <reg orig="dis-|tances">distances</reg>, <lb/> trucks laden with
      barrels of beer, incredible loads. In <lb/> my Austrian diary I find this:</p>
     <p>"In the fields I often see a <lb/> woman and a cow harnessed to the <lb/> plow, and a man

     <p>Five or six years ago I <lb/> bought an open boat, made <lb/> a kind of a canvas wagon-roof
      <lb/> over the stern of it to shelter me from sun and rain; hired a <lb/> courier and a
      boatman, and made a twelve-day floating <reg orig="voy-|age">voyage</reg>
      <lb/> down the Rhone from Lake Bourget to Marseilles. In <lb/> my diary of that trip I find

     <p>" &hellip; .We reached a not very promising-looking village about 4 <lb/> o'clock, and I
      concluded to tie up for the day; munching fruit and fogging <lb/> the hood with pipe-smoke had
      grown monotonous; I could not have the hood <lb/> furled, because the floods of rain fell
      unceasingly. The tavern was on the <lb/> river bank, as is the custom. It was dull there, and
      melancholy&mdash;nothing to <lb/> do but look out of the window into the drenching rain,
      and shiver; one could <lb/> do that, for it was bleak and cold and windy, and country France
      furnishes <lb/> no fire. Winter overcoats did not help me much; they had to be <reg

      were gunny-sacks&mdash;simply conductors for rivers of <lb/> water; some of the volume
      reached the ground; the rest soaked in on the <lb/> way.</p>
     <p>"At last a vigorous fellow of thirty-five arrived, dry and comfortable, <lb/> smoking his
      pipe under his big umbrella in an open donkey-cart&mdash;husband, <lb/> son, and grandson
      of those women! He stood up in the cart, sheltering <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>, <lb/>
      and began to superintend, issuing his orders in a masterly tone of <reg orig="com-|mand"

      <pb n="528" entity="DSSR_000002496_0543"/> Without complaint or murmur the drowned women
      patiently carried out the <lb/> orders, lifting the immense baskets of soggy, wrung-out
      clothing into the <lb/> cart and stowing them to the man's satisfaction. There were six of the
      great <lb/> baskets, and a man of mere ordinary strength could not have lifted any one <lb/>
      of them. The cart being full now, the Frenchman descended, still sheltered <lb/> by his
      umbrella, entered the tavern, and the women went drooping <reg orig="home-|ward"
      >homeward</reg>, <lb/> trudging in the wake of the cart, and soon were blended with the <lb/>
      deluge and lost to sight.</p>
     <p>"When I went down into the public room, the Frenchman had his bottle <lb/> of wine and plate
      of food on a bare table black with grease, and was <lb/> "chomping" like a horse. He had the
      little religious paper which is in <lb/> everybody's hands on the Rhone borders, and was
      enlightening himself with <lb/> the histories of French saints who used to flee to the desert
      in the Middle <lb/> Ages to escape the contamination of woman. For two hundred years France
      <lb/> has been sending missionaries to other savage lands. To spare to the needy <lb/> from

      They will rescue him; they will refine the vileness out of <lb/> him.</p>
     <p>Some time during the forenoon, approaching the mountains, <lb/> we changed from the regular
      train to one composed of little <lb/> canvas-sheltered cars that skimmed along within a foot
      of the <lb/> ground and seemed to be going fifty miles an hour when they <lb/> were really
      making about twenty. Each car had seating <lb/> capacity for half-a-dozen persons; and when
      the curtains were <lb/> up one was substantially out of doors, and could see <reg
       orig="every-|where">everywhere</reg>, <lb/> and get all the breeze, and be luxuriously
      comfortable. <lb/> It was not a pleasure excursion in name only, but in fact.</p>
     <p>After a while we stopped at a little wooden coop of a <reg orig="sta-|tion">station</reg>
      <lb/> just within the curtain of the sombre jungle, a place with <lb/> a deep and dense forest
      of great trees and scrub and vines all <lb/> about it. The royal Bengal tiger is in great
      force there, and</p>
     <pb n="529" entity="DSSR_000002496_0544"/>
     <p>is very bold and unconventional. From this lonely little <reg orig="sta-|tion">station</reg>
      <lb/> a message once went to the railway manager in Calcutta: <lb/> "Tiger eating station
      master on front porch; telegraph <reg orig="instruc-|tions">instructions</reg>."</p>
     <p>It was there that I had my first tiger hunt. I killed <reg orig="thir-|teen">thirteen</reg>.
      <lb/> We were presently away again, and the train began to <lb/> climb the mountains. In one
      place seven wild elephants <lb/> crossed the track, but two of them got away before I could
      <lb/> overtake them. The railway journey up the mountain is forty <lb/> miles, and it takes
      eight hours to make it. It is so wild and <lb/> interesting and exciting and enchanting that
      it ought to take a <lb/> week. As for the vegetation, it is a museum. The jungle <lb/> seemed
      to contain samples of every rare and curious tree and <lb/> bush that we had ever seen or
      heard of. It is from that <lb/> museum, I think, that the globe must have been supplied with
      <lb/> the trees and vines and shrubs that it holds precious.</p>
     <p>The road is infinitely and charmingly crooked. It goes <lb/> winding in and out under lofty
      cliffs that are smothered in <lb/> vines and foliage, and around the edges of bottomless
      chasms; <lb/> and all the way one glides by files of picturesque natives, some <lb/> carrying
      burdens up, others going down from their work in <lb/> the tea-gardens; and once there was a
      gaudy wedding <reg orig="proces-|sion">procession</reg>, <lb/> all bright tinsel and color,
      and a bride, comely and girlish, <lb/> who peeped out from the curtains of her palanquin,
      exposing <lb/> her face with that pure delight which the young and happy <lb/> take in sin for
      sin's own sake.</p>
     <p>By and by we were well up in the region of the clouds, and <lb/> from that breezy height we
      looked down and afar over a <reg orig="won-|derful">wonderful</reg>
      <lb/> picture&mdash;the Plains of India, stretching to the horizon, <lb/> soft and fair,
      level as a floor, shimmering with heat, mottled <lb/> with cloud-shadows, and cloven with
      shining rivers. <reg orig="Immedi-|ately">Immediately</reg>
      <lb/> below us, and receding down, down, down, toward the <lb/> valley, was a shaven confusion
      of hilltops, with ribbony roads <lb/>
      <pb n="530" entity="DSSR_000002496_0545"/> and paths squirming and snaking cream-yellow all
      over them <lb/> and about them, every curve and twist sharply distinct.</p>
     <p>At an elevation of 6,000 feet we entered a thick cloud, and <lb/> it shut out the world and
      kept it shut out. We climbed 1,000 <lb/> feet higher, then began to descend, and presently got
      down to <lb/> Darjeeling, which is 6,000 feet above the level of the Plains.</p>
     <p>We had passed many a mountain village on the way up, <lb/> and seen some new kinds of
      natives, among them many <reg orig="sam-|ples">samples</reg>
      <lb/> of the fighting Ghurkas. They are not large men, but <lb/> they are strong and resolute.
      There are no better soldiers <lb/> among Britain's native troops. And we had passed shoals of
      <lb/> their women climbing the forty miles of steep road from the <lb/> valley to their
      mountain homes, with tall baskets on their backs <lb/> hitched to their foreheads by a band,
      and containing a <reg orig="freight-|age">freightage</reg>
      <lb/> weighing&mdash;I will not say how many hundreds of pounds, <lb/> for the sum is
      unbelievable. These were young women, and <lb/> they strode smartly along under these
      astonishing burdens <lb/> with the air of people out for a holiday. I was told that a <lb/>
      woman will carry a piano on her back all the way up the <lb/> mountain; and that more than
      once a woman had done it. If <lb/> these were old women I should regard the Ghurkas as no
      <lb/> more civilized than the Europeans.</p>
     <p>At the railway station at Darjeeling you find plenty of <reg
       orig="cab-|substitutes&mdash;open">cabsubstitutes&mdash;open</reg>
      <lb/> coffins, in which you sit, and are then borne <lb/> on men's shoulders up the steep
      roads into the town.</p>
     <p>Up there we found a fairly comfortable hotel, the property <lb/> of an indiscriminate and
      incoherent landlord, who looks after <lb/> nothing, but leaves everything to his army of
      Indian servants. <lb/> No, he does look after the bill&mdash;to be just to
      him&mdash;and the <lb/> tourist cannot do better than follow his example. I was told
      <lb/> by a resident that the summit of Kinchinjunga is often hidden <lb/> in the clouds, and
      that sometimes a tourist has waited <reg orig="twenty-|two">twenty-two</reg>
      <lb/> days and then been obliged to go away without a sight of <lb/>

      his hotel <lb/> bill he recognized that he was now seeing the highest thing in <lb/> the
      Himalayas. But this is probably a lie.</p>
     <p>After lecturing I went to the Club that night, and that was <lb/> a comfortable place. It is
      loftily situated, and looks out over <lb/> a vast spread of scenery; from it you can see where
      the <reg orig="boun-|daries">boundaries</reg>
      <lb/> of three countries come together, some thirty miles away; <lb/> Thibet is one of them,
      Nepaul another, and I think <reg orig="Herze-|govina">Herzegovina</reg>
      <lb/> was the other. Apparently, in every town and city in <lb/> India the gentlemen of the
      British civil and military service <lb/> have a club; sometimes it is a palatial one, always
      it is <reg orig="pleas-|ant">pleasant</reg>
      <lb/> and homelike. The hotels are not always as good as they <lb/> might be, and the stranger
      who has access to the Club is <reg orig="grate-|ful">grateful</reg>
      <lb/> for his privilege and knows how to value it.</p>
     <p>Next day was Sunday. Friends came in the gray dawn <lb/> with horses, and my party rode away
      to a distant point where <lb/> Kinchinjunga and Mount Everest show up best, but I stayed at
      <lb/> home for a private view; for it was very old, and I was not <lb/> acquainted with the
      horses, any way. I got a pipe and a few <lb/> blankets and sat for two hours at the window,
      and saw the sun <lb/> drive away the veiling gray and touch up the snow-peaks one <lb/> after
      another with pale pink splashes and delicate washes of <lb/> gold, and finally flood the whole
      mighty convulsion of <reg orig="snow-|mountains">snow-mountains</reg>
      <lb/> with a deluge of rich splendors.</p>
     <p>Kinchinjunga's peak was but fitfully visible, but in the <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg>
      <lb/> times it was vividly clear against the sky&mdash;away up <lb/> there in the blue
      dome more than 28,000 feet above sea level <lb/> &mdash;the loftiest land I had ever
      seen, by 12,000 feet or more. It <lb/> was 45 miles away. Mount Everest is a thousand feet
      higher, <lb/> but it was not a part of that sea of mountains piled up there <lb/> before me,
      so I did not see it; but I did not care, because I <lb/> think that mountains that are as high
      as that are disagreeable.</p>

      swarthy <lb/> strange tribes flock by from their far homes in the Himalayas. <lb/> All ages
      and both sexes were represented, and the breeds were <lb/> quite new to me, though the <lb/>
      costumes of the Thibetans made <lb/> them look a good deal like <lb/> Chinamen. The
      prayer-wheel <lb/> was a frequent feature. It <lb/> brought me near to these people, <lb/> and
      made them seem kinfolk of <lb/> mine. Through our preacher we <lb/> do much of our praying by
      <lb/> proxy. We do not whirl him <lb/> around a stick, as they do, but <lb/> that is merely a
      detail. The <lb/> swarm swung briskly by, hour <lb/> after hour, a strange and striking <lb/>
      pageant. It was wasted there, <lb/> and it seemed a pity. It should <lb/> have been sent
      streaming through <lb/> the cities of Europe or America, to refresh eyes weary of the <lb/>
      pale monotonies of the circus-pageant. These people were <lb/> bound for the bazar, with
      things to sell. We went down there, <lb/> later, and saw that novel congress of the wild
      peoples, and <lb/> plowed here and there through it, and concluded that it would <lb/> be
      worth coming from Calcutta to see, even if there were no <lb/> Kinchinjunga and Everest.</p>

      were ready to <lb/> chance the weather of the lower world once more.</p>
     <p>We traveled up hill by the regular train five miles to the <lb/> summit, then changed to a
      little canvas-canopied hand-car for <lb/> the 35-mile descent. It was the size of a sleigh, it

      inclines. It only needed a strong <lb/> brake, to modify its flight, and it had that. There

      the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, when the car <lb/> jumped the track and threw its
      passengers over a precipice. <lb/> It was not true, but the story had value for me, for it
      made <lb/> me nervous, and nervousness wakes a person up and makes <lb/> him alive and alert,

      could derail the car and fling it down <lb/> into India; and the fact that the
      lieutenant-governor had <lb/> escaped was no proof that I would have the same luck. And <lb/>
      standing there, looking down upon the Indian Empire from <lb/> the airy altitude of 7,000
      feet, it seemed unpleasantly far, <lb/> dangerously far, to be flung from a hand-car.</p>
     <pb n="536" entity="DSSR_000002496_0551"/>
     <p>But after all, there was but small danger&mdash;for me. What <lb/> there was, was for
      Mr. Pugh, inspector of a division of the <lb/> Indian police, in whose company and protection
      we had come <lb/> from Calcutta. He had seen long service as an artillery officer, <lb/> was
      less nervous than I was, and so he was to go ahead of us <lb/> in a pilot hand-car, with a
      Ghurka and another native; and <lb/> the plan was that when we should see his car jump over a
      <lb/> precipice we must put on our break and send for another pilot. <lb/> It was a good
      arrangement. Also Mr. Barnard, chief engineer <lb/> of the mountain-division of the road, was
      to take personal <lb/> charge of our car, and he had been down the mountain in it <lb/> many a
      time.</p>
     <p>Everything looked safe. Indeed, there was but one <reg orig="ques-|tionable">questionable</reg>
      <lb/> detail left: the regular train was to follow us as soon <lb/> as we should start, and it
      might run over us. Privately, I <lb/> thought it would.</p>
     <p>The road fell sharply down in front of us and went <reg orig="cork-|screwing">corkscrewing</reg>
      <lb/> in and out around the crags and precipices, down, <lb/> down, forever down, suggesting
      nothing so exactly or so <reg orig="un-|comfortably">uncomfortably</reg>
      <lb/> as a crooked toboggan slide with no end to it. <lb/> Mr. Pugh waved his flag and
      started, like an arrow from a <lb/> bow, and before I could get out of the car we were gone
      too. <lb/> I had previously had but one sensation like the shock of that <lb/> departure, and
      that was the gaspy shock that took my breath <lb/> away the first time that I was discharged
      from the summit of <lb/> a toboggan slide. But in both instances the sensation was <lb/>
      pleasurable&mdash;intensely so; it was a sudden and immense <reg orig="ex-|altation"
       >exaltation</reg>, <lb/> a mixed ecstasy of deadly fright and unimaginable <lb/> joy. I
      believe that this combination makes the perfection of <lb/> human delight.</p>
     <p>The pilot car's flight down the mountain suggested the <lb/> swoop of a swallow that is
      skimming the ground, so swiftly <lb/> and smoothly and gracefully it swept down the long
      straight <lb/>

       <p>WE PLAYED WITH THE TRAIN.</p>
      </figure>
      <pb n="538" entity="DSSR_000002496_0553"/> reaches and soared in and out of the bends and
      around the <lb/> corners. We raced after it, and seemed to flash by the capes <lb/> and crags
      with the speed of light; and now and then we <lb/> almost overtook it&mdash;and had
      hopes; but it was only playing <lb/> with us; when we got near, it released its brake, make a
      spring <lb/> around a corner, and the next time it spun into view, a few <lb/> seconds later,
      it looked as small as a wheelbarrow, it was so far <lb/> away. We played with the train in the
      same way. We often <lb/> got out to gather flowers or sit on a precipice and look at the <lb/>
      scenery, then presently we would hear a dull and growing <lb/> roar, and the long coils of the
      train would come into sight <reg orig="be-|hind">behind</reg>
      <lb/> and above us; but we did not need to start till the <reg orig="loco-|motive">locomotive</reg>
      <lb/> was close down upon us&mdash;then we soon left it far <lb/> behind. It had to stop
      at every station, therefore it was not <lb/> an embarrassment to us. Our brake was a good
      piece of <lb/> machinery; it could bring the car to a standstill on a slope as <lb/> steep as
      a house-roof.</p>
     <p>The scenery was grand and varied and beautiful, and there <lb/> was no hurry; we could
      always stop and examine it. There <lb/> was abundance of time. We did not need to hamper the
      <lb/> train; if it wanted the road, we could switch off and let it go <lb/> by, then overtake
      it and pass it later. We stopped at one <lb/> place to see the Gladstone Cliff, a great crag
      which the ages <lb/> and the weather have sculptured into a recognizable portrait of <lb/> the
      venerable statesman. Mr. Gladstone is a stockholder in <lb/> the road, and Nature began this
      portrait ten thousand years <lb/> ago, with the idea of having the compliment ready in time
      for <lb/> the event.</p>
     <p>We saw a banyan tree which sent down supporting stems <lb/> from branches which were sixty
      feet above the ground. That <lb/> is, I suppose it was a banyan; its bark resembled that of
      the <lb/> great banyan in the botanical gardens at Calcutta, that <reg orig="spider-|legged"
       >spider-legged</reg>
      <lb/> thing with its wilderness of vegetable columns. And <lb/>
      <pb n="539" entity="DSSR_000002496_0554"/> there were frequent glimpses of a totally leafless
      tree upon <lb/> whose innumerable twigs and branches a cloud of crimson <lb/> butterflies had
      lighted&mdash;apparently. In fact these brilliant <lb/> red butterflies were flowers, but
      the illusion was good. <reg orig="After-|ward">Afterward</reg>
      <lb/> in South Africa, I saw another splendid effect made by <lb/> red flowers. This flower
      was probably called the torchplant <lb/> &mdash;should have been so named, anyway. It had
      a slender stem <lb/> several feet high, and from its top stood up a single tongue of <lb/>
      flame, an intensely red flower of the size and shape of a small <lb/> corn-cob. The stems
      stood three or four feet apart all over a <lb/> great hill-slope that was a mile long, and
      make one think of <lb/> what the Place de la Concorde would be if its myriad lights <lb/> were
      red instead of white and yellow.</p>
     <p>A few miles down the mountain we stopped half an hour <lb/> to see a Thibetan dramatic
      performance. It was in the open <lb/> air on the hillside. The audience was composed of
      Thibetans, <lb/> Ghurkas, and other unusual people. The costumes of the <lb/> actors were in
      the last degree outlandish, and the performance <lb/> was in keeping with the clothes. To an
      accompaniment of <lb/> barbarous noises the actors stepped out one after another and <lb/>
      began to spin around with immense swiftness and vigor and <lb/> violence, chanting the while,
      and soon the whole troupe would <lb/> be spinning and chanting and raising the dust. They were
      <lb/> performing an ancient and celebrated historical play, and a <lb/> Chinaman explained it
      to me in pidjin English as it went <lb/> along. The play was obscure enough without the <reg
       orig="explana-|tion">explanation</reg>; <lb/> with the explanation added, it was opake. As a
      drama <lb/> this ancient historical work of art was defective, I thought, <lb/> but as a wild
      and barbarous spectacle the representation was <lb/> beyond criticism.</p>
     <p>Far down the mountain we got out to look at a piece of <lb/> remarkable
      loop-engineering&mdash;a spiral where the road curves <lb/> upon itself with such
      abruptness that when the regular train <lb/>
      <pb n="540" entity="DSSR_000002496_0555"/> came down and entered the loop, we stood over it
      and saw the <lb/> locomotive disappear under our bridge, then in a few moments <lb/> appear
      again, chasing its own tail; and we saw it gain on it, <lb/> overtake it, draw ahead past the
      rear cars, and run a race with <lb/> that end of the train. It was like a snake swallowing
      itself.</p>
     <p>Half-way down the mountain we stopped about an hour at <lb/> Mr. Barnard's house for
      refreshments, and while we were <lb/> sitting on the veranda looking at the distant panorama
      of <lb/> hills through a gap in the forest, we came very near seeing a <lb/> leopard kill a
       calf.<ref target="n540.1" n="18">*</ref>
      <note id="n540.1" place="foot" n="18"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg>

       <p>It killed it the day before</p>
      </note> It is a wild place and lovely. From the <lb/> woods all about came the songs of
      birds,&mdash;among them the <lb/> contributions of a couple of birds which I was not then
      <lb/> acquainted with: the brain-fever bird and the coppersmith. <lb/> The song of the
      brain-fever demon starts on a low but steadily <lb/> rising key, and is a spiral twist which
      augments in intensity <lb/> and severity with each added spiral, growing sharper and <lb/>
      sharper, and more and more painful, more and more agonizing, <lb/> more and more maddening,
      intolerable, unendurable, as it <lb/> bores deeper and deeper and deeper into the listener's
      brain, <lb/> until at last the brain fever comes as a relief and the man dies. <lb/> I am
      bringing some of these birds home to America. They <lb/> will be a great curiosity there, and
      it is believed that in our <lb/> climate they will multiply like rabbits.</p>
     <p>The coppersmith bird's note at a certain distance away <lb/> has the ring of a sledge on
      granite; at a certain other distance <lb/> the hammering has a more metallic ring, and you
      might think <lb/> that the bird was mending a copper kettle; at another distance <lb/> it has
      a more woodeny thump, but it is a thump that is full of <lb/> energy, and sounds just like
      starting a bung. So he is a hard <lb/> bird to name with a single name; he is a stone-breaker,
       <reg orig="cop-|persmith">coppersmith</reg>, <lb/> and bung-starter, and even then he is not
      completely <lb/> named, for when he is close by you find that there is a soft, <lb/>

      no <reg orig="satisfy-|ing">satisfying</reg>
      <lb/> name occurs to you. You will not mind his other notes, <lb/> but when he camps near
      enough for you to hear that one, you <lb/> presently find that his measured and monotonous
      repetition of <lb/> it is beginning to disturb you; next it will weary you, soon it <lb/> will
      distress you, and before long each thump will hurt your <lb/> head; if this goes on, you will
      lose your mind with the pain <lb/> and misery of it, and go crazy. I am bringing some of these
      <lb/> birds home to America. There is nothing like them there. <lb/> They will be a great
      surprise, and it is said that in a climate <lb/> like ours they will surpass expectation for
      fecundity.</p>
     <p>I am bringing some nightingales, too, and some cue-owls. <lb/> I got them in Italy. The song
      of the nightingale is the dead <lb/> liest known to ornithology. That demoniacal shriek can
      kill <lb/> at thirty yards. The note of the cue-owl is infinitely soft and <lb/>
      sweet&mdash;soft and sweet as the whisper of a flute. But <reg
       orig="pene-|trating&mdash;oh">penetrating&mdash;oh</reg>, <lb/> beyond belief; it
      can bore through boiler-iron. <lb/> It is a lingering note, and comes in triplets, on the one
       <reg orig="un-|changing">unchanging</reg>
      <lb/> key: <hi rend="italic">hoo-o-o, hoo-o-o, hoo-o-o</hi>; then a silence of fifteen <lb/>
      seconds, then the triplet again; and so on, all night. At first <lb/> it is divine; then less
      so; then trying; then distressing; then <lb/> excruciating; then agonizing, and at the end of
      two hours the <lb/> listener is a maniac.</p>
     <p>And so, presently we took to the hand-car and went flying <lb/> down the mountain again;
      flying and stopping, flying and <lb/> stopping, till at last we were in the plain once more
      and stowed <lb/> for Calcutta in the regular train. That was the most <reg orig="enjoy-|able"
       >enjoyable</reg>
      <lb/> day I have spent in the earth. For rousing, tingling, <lb/> rapturous pleasure there is
      no holiday trip that approaches the <lb/> bird-flight down the Himalayas in a hand-car. It has

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">So</hi> far as I am able to judge, nothing has been left <lb/> undone,
      either by man or Nature, to make India the <lb/> most extraordinary country that the sun
      visits on his <lb/> round. Nothing seems to have been forgotten, nothing <reg
       orig="over-|looked">overlooked</reg>. <lb/> Always, when you think you have come to the end
      <lb/> of her tremendous specialties and have finished hanging tags <lb/> upon her as the Land
      of the Thug, the Land of the Plague, <lb/> the Land of Famine, the Land of Giant Illusions,
      the Land of <lb/> Studendous Mountains, and so forth, another specialty crops <lb/> up and
      another tag is required. I have been overlooking the <lb/> fact that India is by an
      unapproachable supremacy&mdash;the Land <lb/> of Murderous Wild Creatures. Perhaps it
      will be simplest to <lb/> throw away the tags and generalize her with one all-<reg
       orig="compre-|hensive">comprehensive</reg>
      <lb/> name, as the Land of Wonders.</p>
     <p>For many years the British Indian Government has been <lb/> trying to destroy the murderous
      wild creatures, and has spent <lb/> a great deal of money in the effort. The annual official
      <lb/> returns show that the undertaking is a difficult one.</p>
     <p>These returns exhibit a curious annual uniformity in results; <lb/> the sort of uniformity
      which you find in the annual output of <lb/> suicides in the world's capitals, and the
      proportions of deaths <lb/> by this, that, and the other disease. You can always come <lb/>
      close to foretelling how many suicides will occur in Paris, <lb/> London, and New York, next
      year, and also how many deaths <lb/> will result from cancer, consumption, dog-bite, falling
      out of <lb/>
      <pb n="545" entity="DSSR_000002496_0560"/> the window, getting run over by cabs, etc., if you
      know the <lb/> statistics of those matters for the present year. In the same <lb/> way, with
      one year's Indian statistics before you, you can <lb/> guess closely at how many people were
      killed in that Empire <lb/> by tigers during the previous year, and the year before that,
      <lb/> and the year before that, and at how many were killed in each <lb/> of those years by
      bears, how many by wolves, and how many <lb/> by snakes; and you can also guess closely at how
      many people <lb/> are going to be killed each year for the coming five years by <lb/> each of
      those agencies. You can also guess closely at how <lb/> many of each agency the government is
      going to kill each <lb/> year for the next five years.</p>
     <p>I have before me statistics covering a period of six <reg orig="consec-|utive">consecutive</reg>
      <lb/> years. By these, I know that in India the tiger kills <lb/> something over 800 persons
      every year, and that the <reg orig="govern-|ment">government</reg>
      <lb/> responds by killing about double as many tigers every <lb/> year. In four of the six
      years referred to, the tiger got 800 <lb/> odd; in one of the remaining two years he got only
      700, but in <lb/> the other remaining year he made his average good by scoring <lb/> 917. He
      is always sure of his average. Anyone who bets <lb/> that the tiger will kill 2,400 people in
      India in any three <lb/> consecutive years has invested his money in a certainty; <reg
       orig="any-|one">anyone</reg>
      <lb/> who bets that he will kill 2,600 in any three consecutive <lb/> years, is absolutely
      sure to lose.</p>
     <p>As strikingly uniform as are the statistics of suicide, they <lb/> are not any more so than
      are those of the tiger's annual <reg orig="out-|put">output</reg>
      <lb/> of slaughtered human beings in India. The government's <lb/> work is quite uniform, too;
      it about doubles the tiger's <reg orig="aver-|age">average</reg>. <lb/> In six years the tiger
      killed 5,000 persons, minus 50; in <lb/> the same six years 10,000 tigers were killed, minus
      400. <lb/> The wolf kills nearly as many people as the tiger&mdash;700 a <lb/> year to
      the tiger's 800 odd&mdash;but while he is doing it, more <lb/> than 5,000 of his tribe
      fall.</p>
     <pb n="546" entity="DSSR_000002496_0561"/>
     <p>The leopard kills an average of 230 people per year, but <lb/> loses 3,300 of his own mess
      while he is doing it.</p>
     <p>The bear kills 100 people per year at a cost of 1,250 of his <lb/> own tribe.</p>
     <p>The tiger, as the figures show, makes a very handsome <lb/> fight against man. But it is
      nothing to the elephant's fight. <lb/> The king of beasts, the lord of the jungle, loses four
      of his <lb/> mess per year, but he kills <hi rend="italic">forty-five</hi> persons to make up
      for it.</p>
     <p>But when it comes to killing cattle, the lord of the jungle <lb/> is not interested. He
      kills but 100 in six years&mdash;horses of <lb/> hunters, no doubt&mdash;but in the
      same six the tiger kills more <lb/> than 84,000, the leopard 100,000, the bear 4,000, the wolf
      <lb/> 70,000, the hyena more than 13,000, other wild beasts 27,000, <lb/> and the snakes
      19,000, a grand total of more than 300,000; an <lb/> average of 50,000 head per year.</p>
     <p>In response, the government kills, in the six years, a total <lb/> of 3,201,232 wild beasts
      and snakes. Ten for one.</p>
     <p>It will be perceived that the snakes are not much interested <lb/> in cattle; they kill only
      3,000 odd per year. The snakes are <lb/> much more interested in man. India swarms with deadly
      <lb/> snakes. At the head of the list is the cobra, the deadliest <lb/> known to the world, a
      snake whose bite kills where the <reg orig="rattle-|snake's">rattlesnake's</reg>
      <lb/> bite merely entertains.</p>
     <p>In India, the annual man-killings by snakes are as uniform, <lb/> as regular, and as
      forecastable as are the tiger-average and the <lb/> suicide-average. Anyone who bets that in
      India, in any three <lb/> consecutive years the snakes will kill 49,500 persons, will win
      <lb/> his bet; and anyone who bets that in India in any three <reg orig="con-|secutive"
       >consecutive</reg>
      <lb/> years, the snakes will kill 53,500 persons, will lose his <lb/> bet. In India the snakes
      kill 17,000 people a year; they <lb/> hardly ever fall short of it; they as seldom exceed it.
      An <lb/> insurance actuary could take the Indian census tables and the <lb/> government's
      snake tables and tell you within sixpence how <lb/> much it would be worth to insure a man
      against death by <lb/>
      <pb n="547" entity="DSSR_000002496_0562"/> snake-bite there. If I had a dollar for every
      person killed per <lb/> year in India, I would rather have it than any other property, <lb/>
      as it is the only property in the world not subject to shrinkage.</p>
     <p>I should like to have a royalty on the government-end of <lb/> the snake business, too, and
      am in London now trying to get <lb/> it; but when I get it it is not going to be as regular an
      income <lb/> as the other will be if I get that; I have applied for it. The <lb/> snakes
      transact their end of the business in a more orderly and <lb/> systematic way than the
      government transacts its end of it, <lb/> because the snakes have had a long experience and
      know all <lb/> about the traffic. You can make sure that the government <lb/> will never kill
      fewer than 110,000 snakes in a year, and that it <lb/> will never quite reach
      300,000&mdash;too much room for oscillation; <lb/> good speculative stock, to bear or
      bull, and buy and sell long <lb/> and short, and all that kind of thing, but not eligible for
       <reg orig="invest-|ment">investment</reg>
      <lb/> like the other. The man that speculates in the <reg orig="govern-|ment's">government's</reg>
      <lb/> snake crop wants to go carefully. I would not advise <lb/> a man to buy a single crop at
      all&mdash;I mean a crop of futures&mdash; <lb/> for the possible wobble is something
      quite extraordinary. If <lb/> he can buy <hi rend="italic">six</hi> future crops in a bunch,
      seller to deliver <lb/> 1,500,000 altogether, that is another matter. I do not know <lb/> what
      snakes are worth now, but I know what they would be <lb/> worth then, for the statistics show
      that the seller could not <lb/> come within 427,000 of carrying out his contract. However, I
      <lb/> think that a person who speculates in snakes is a fool, anyway. <lb/> He always regrets
      it afterwards.</p>
     <p>To finish the statistics. In six years the wild beasts kill <lb/> 20,000 persons, and the
      snakes kill 103,000. In the same six <lb/> the government kills 1,073,546 snakes. Plenty left.</p>
     <p>There are narrow escapes in India. In the very jungle <lb/> where I killed sixteen tigers
      and all those elephants, a cobra <lb/> bit me but it got well; everyone was surprised. This
      could <lb/> not happen twice in ten years, perhaps. Usually death would <lb/> result in
      fifteen minutes.</p>
     <pb n="548" entity="DSSR_000002496_0563"/>
     <p>We struck out westward or northwestward from Calcutta <lb/> on an itinerary of a zig-zag
      sort, which would in the course of <lb/> time carry us across India to its northwestern corner
      and the <lb/> border of Afghanistan. The first part of the trip carried us <lb/> through a
      great region which was an endless garden&mdash;miles <lb/> and miles of the beautiful
      flower from whose juices comes the <lb/> opium, and at Muzaffurpore we were in the midst of
      the indigo <lb/> culture; thence by a branch road to the Ganges at a point <lb/> near
      Dinapore, and by a train which would have missed the <lb/> connection by a week but for the
      thoughtfulness of some <lb/> British officers who were along, and who knew the ways of <lb/>
      trains that are run by natives without white supervision. <lb/> This train stopped at every
      village; for no purpose connected <lb/> with business, apparently. We put out nothing, we took
      <lb/> nothing aboard. The train hands stepped ashore and gossiped <lb/> with friends a quarter
      of an hour, then pulled out and repeated <lb/> this at the succeeding villages. We had
      thirty-five miles to go <lb/> and six hours to do it in, but it was plain that we were not
      <lb/> going to make it. It was then that the English officers said it <lb/> was now necessary
      to turn this gravel train into an express. <lb/> So they gave the engine-driver a rupee and
      told him to fly. <lb/> It was a simple remedy. After that we made ninety miles an <lb/> hour.
      We crossed the Ganges just at dawn, made our <reg orig="connec-|tion">connection</reg>, <lb/>
      and went to Benares, where we stayed twenty-four hours <lb/> and inspected that strange and
      fascinating piety-hive again; <lb/> then left for Lucknow, a city which is perhaps the most
       <reg orig="con-|spicuous">conspicuous</reg>
      <lb/> of the many monuments of British fortitude and valor <lb/> that are scattered about the
      earth.</p>
     <p>The heat was pitiless, the flat plains were destitute of grass, <lb/> and baked dry by the
      sun they were the color of pale dust, <lb/> which was flying in clouds. But it was much hotter
      than <lb/> this when the relieving forces marched to Lucknow in the time <lb/> of the Mutiny.
      Those were the days of 138&deg; in the shade.</p>

      <p>Make it a point to do something every day that you don't want to do. This is <lb/> the

       </bibl></p>
     </argument>
     <p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> seems to be settled, now, that among the many causes <lb/>
      from which the Great Mutiny sprang, the main one was <lb/> the annexation of the kingdom of
      Oudh by the East India <lb/> Company&mdash;characterized by Sir Henry Lawrence as "the
      <lb/> most unrighteous act that was ever committed." In the <lb/> spring of 1857, a mutinous
      spirit was observable in many of <lb/> the native garrisons, and it grew day by day and spread
      wider <lb/> and wider. The younger military men saw something very <lb/> serious in it, and
      would have liked to take hold of it vigorously <lb/> and stamp it out promptly; but they were
      not in authority. <lb/> Old men were in the high places of the army&mdash;men who <lb/>
      should have been retired long before, because of their great <lb/> age&mdash;and they
      regarded the matter as a thing of no <reg orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg>. <lb/> They
      loved their native soldiers, and would not <lb/> believe that anything could move them to
      revolt. <reg orig="Every-|where">Everywhere</reg>
      <lb/> these obstinate veterans listened serenely to the <reg orig="rum-|bling">rumbling</reg>
      <lb/> of the volcanoes under them, and said it was nothing.</p>
     <p>And so the propagators of mutiny had everything their <lb/> own way. They moved from camp to
      camp undisturbed, and <lb/> painted to the native soldier the wrongs his people were <reg
       orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg>
      <lb/> at the hands of the English, and made his heart burn for <lb/> revenge. They were able
      to point to two facts of formidable <lb/> value as backers of their persuasions: In Clive's
      day, native <lb/> armies were incoherent mobs, and without effective arms; <lb/>
      <pb n="550" entity="DSSR_000002496_0565"/> therefore, they were weak against Clive's organized
      handful of <lb/> well-armed men, but the thing was the other way, now. The <lb/> British
      forces were native; they had been trained by the <lb/> British, organized by the British,
      armed by the British, all the <lb/> power was in their hands&mdash;they were a club made
      by British <lb/> hands to beat out British brains with. There was nothing to <lb/> oppose
      their mass, nothing but a few weak battalions of <reg orig="Brit-|ish">British</reg>
      <lb/> soldiers scattered about India, a force not worth speaking <lb/> of. This argument,
      taken alone, might not have succeeded, <lb/> for the bravest and best Indian troops had a
      wholesome dread <lb/> of the white soldier, whether he was weak or strong; but the <lb/>
      agitators backed it with their second and best point&mdash;<hi rend="italic">
       <reg orig="proph-|ecy">prophecy</reg>
      </hi>&mdash;a <lb/> prophecy a hundred years old. The Indian is open to <lb/> prophecy at
      all times; argument may fail to convince him, but <lb/> not prophecy. There was a prophecy
      that a hundred years <lb/> from the year of that battle of Clive's which founded the <lb/>
      British Indian Empire, the British power would be overthrown <lb/> and swept away by the
      natives.</p>
     <p>The Mutiny broke out at Meerut on the 10th of May, 1857, <lb/> and fired a train of
      tremendous historical explosions. Nana <lb/> Sahib's massacre of the surrendered garrison of
      Cawnpore <lb/> occurred in June, and the long siege of Lucknow began. The <lb/> military
      history of England is old and great, but I think it <lb/> must be granted that the crushing of
      the Mutiny is the <reg orig="great-|est">greatest</reg>
      <lb/> chapter in it. The British were caught asleep and <reg orig="unpre-|pared"
      >unprepared</reg>. <lb/> They were a few thousands, swallowed up in an ocean <lb/> of hostile
      populations. It would take months to inform <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg>
      <lb/> and get help, but they did not falter or stop to count the <lb/> odds, but with English
      resolution and English devotion they <lb/> took up their task, and went stubbornly on with it,
      through <lb/> good fortune and bad, and fought the most unpromising <lb/> fight that one may
      read of in fiction or out of it, and won it <lb/> thoroughly.</p>
     <pb n="551" entity="DSSR_000002496_0566"/>
     <p>The Mutiny broke out so suddenly, and spread with such <lb/> rapidity that there was but
      little time for occupants of weak <lb/> outlying stations to escape to places of safety.
      Attempts were <lb/> made, of course, but they were attended by hardships as bitter <lb/> as
      death in the few cases which were successful; for the heat <lb/> ranged between 120 and 138 in
      the shade; the way led through <lb/> hostile peoples, and food and water were hardly to be
      had. <lb/> For ladies and children accustomed to ease and comfort and <lb/> plenty, such a
      journey must have been a cruel experience. <lb/> Sir G. O. Trevelyan quotes an example:</p>
     <p>"This is what befell Mrs. M&mdash;&mdash;, the wife of the surgeon at a certain
      <lb/> station on the southern confines of the insurrection. 'I heard,' she says, 'a <lb/>
      number of shots fired, and, looking out, I saw my husband driving furiously <lb/> from the
      mess-house, waving his whip. I ran to him, and, seeing a bearer <lb/> with my child in his
      arms, I caught her up, and got into the buggy. At the <lb/> mess-house we found all the
      officers assembled, together with sixty sepoys, <lb/> who had remained faithful. We went off
      in one large party, amidst a general <lb/> conflagration of our late homes. We reached the
      caravanserai at Chattapore <lb/> the next morning, and thence started for Callinger. At this
      point our sepoy <lb/> escort deserted us. We were fired upon by matchlockmen, and one officer
      was <lb/> shot dead. We heard, likewise, that the people had risen at Callinger, so we <lb/>
      returned and walked back ten miles that day. M&mdash;&mdash; and I carried the child
      <lb/> alternately. Presently Mrs. Smalley died of sunstroke. We had no food <lb/> amongst us.
      An officer kindly lent us a horse. We were very faint. The <lb/> Major died, and was buried;
      also the Sergeant-major and some women. The <lb/> bandsmen left us on the nineteenth of June.
      We were fired at again by <reg orig="match-|lockmen">matchlockmen</reg>, <lb/> and changed
      direction for Allahabad. Our party consisted of nine <lb/> gentlemen, two children, the
      sergeant and his wife. On the morning of the <lb/> twentieth, Captain Scott took Lottie on to
      his horse. I was riding behind my <lb/> husband, and she was so crushed between us. She was
      two years old on the <lb/> first of the month. We were both weak through want of food and the
      effect <lb/> of the sun. Lottie and I had no head covering. M&mdash;&mdash;had a
      sepoy's cap I <lb/> found on the ground. Soon after sunrise we were followed by villagers
      <lb/> armed with clubs and spears. One of them struck Captain Scott's horse on <lb/> the leg.
      He galloped off with Lottie, and my poor husband never saw his <lb/> child again. We rode on
      several miles, keeping away from villages, and then <lb/> crossed the river. Our thirst was
      extreme. M&mdash;&mdash;had dreadful cramps, so <lb/> that I had to hold him on the
      horse. I was very uneasy about him. The day <lb/> before I saw the drummer's wife eating
      chupatties, and asked her to give a <lb/> piece to the child, which she did. I now saw water
      in a ravine. The <lb/> descent was steep, and our only drinking-vessel was
      M&mdash;&mdash;'s cap. Our horse <lb/> got water, and I bathed my neck. I had no
      stockings, and my feet were torn <lb/> and blistered. Two peasants came in sight, and we were
      frightened and rode <lb/>
      <pb n="552" entity="DSSR_000002496_0567"/> off. The sergeant held our horse, and
      M&mdash;&mdash;put me up and mounted. I think <lb/> he must have got suddenly faint,
      for I fell and he over me, on the road, when <lb/> the horse started off. Some time before he
      said, and Barber, too, that he <lb/> could not live many hours I felt he was dying before we
      came to the ravine. <lb/> He told me his wishes about his children and myself, and took leave.
      My <lb/> brain seemed burnt up. No tears came. As soon as we fell, the sergeant let <lb/> go
      the horse, and it went off; so that escape was cut off. We sat down on <lb/> the ground
      waiting for death. Poor fellow! he was very weak; his thirst <lb/> was frightful, and I went
      to get him water. Some villagers came, and took <lb/> my rupees and watch. I took off my
      wedding-ring, and twisted it in my <lb/> hair, and replaced the guard. I tore off the skirt of
      my dress to bring water <lb/> in, but was no use, for when I returned my beloved's eyes were
      fixed, and, <lb/> though I called and tried to restore him, and poured water into his mouth,
      it <lb/> only rattled in his throat. He never spoke to me again. I held him in my <lb/> arms
      till he sank gradually down. I felt frantic, but could not cry. I was <lb/> alone. I bound his
      head and face in my dress, for there was no earth to bury <lb/> him. The pain in my hands and
      feet was dreadful. I went down to the <lb/> ravine, and sat in the water on a stone, hoping to
      get off at night and look for <lb/> Lottie. When I came back from the water, I saw that they
      had not taken <lb/> her little watch, chain, and seals, so I tied them under my petticoat. In
      an <lb/> hour, about thirty villagers came, they dragged me out of the ravine, and <lb/> took
      off my jacket, and found the little chain. They then dragged me to a <lb/> village, mocking me
      all the way, and disputing as to whom I was to belong <lb/> to. The whole population came to
      look at me I asked for a bedstead, and <lb/> lay down outside the door of a hut. They had a
      dozen of cows, and yet <lb/> refused me milk. When night came, and the village was quiet, some
      old <lb/> woman brought me a leafful of rice. I was too parched to eat, and they <lb/> gave me
      water. The morning after a neighboring Rajah sent a palanquin <lb/> and a horseman to fetch
      me, who told me that a little child and three Sahibs <lb/> had come to his master's house. And
      so the poor mother found her lost one, <lb/> 'greatly blistered,' poor little creature. It is
      not for Europeans in India to <lb/> pray that their flight be not in the winter."</p>
     <p>In the first days of June the aged general, Sir Hugh <lb/> Wheeler commanding the forces at
      Cawnpore, was deserted by <lb/> his native troops; then he moved out of the fort and into an
      <lb/> exposed patch of open flat ground and built a four-foot mud <lb/> wall around it. He had
      with him a few hundred white <lb/> soldiers and officers, and apparently more women and
      children <lb/> than soldiers. He was short of provisions, short of arms, short <lb/> of
      ammunition, short of military wisdom, short of everything <lb/> but courage and devotion to
      duty. The defense of that open <lb/> lot through twenty-one days and nights of hunger, thirst,
      <lb/> Indian heat, and a never-ceasing storm of bullets, bombs, and <lb/>
      <pb n="553" entity="DSSR_000002496_0568"/> cannon-balls&mdash;a defense conducted, not by
      the aged and infirm <lb/> general, but by a young officer named Moore&mdash;is one of the
      <lb/> most heroic episodes in history. When at last the Nana found <lb/> it impossible to
      conquer these starving men and women with <lb/> powder and ball, he resorted to treachery, and
      that succeeded. <lb/> He agreed to supply them with food and send them to <lb/> Allahabad in
      boats. Their mud wall and their barracks were <lb/> in ruins, their provisions were at the
      point of exhaustion, they <lb/> had done all that the brave could do, they had conquered an
      <lb/> honorable compromise, their forces had been fearfully reduced <lb/> by casualties and by
      disease, they were not able to continue <lb/> the contest longer. They came forth helpless but
      suspecting <lb/> no treachery, the Nana's host closed around them, and at a <lb/> signal from
      a trumpet the massacre began. About two <lb/> hundred women and children were
      spared&mdash;for the present&mdash; <lb/> but all the men except three or four were
      killed. Among the <lb/> incidents of the massacre quoted by Sir G. O. Trevelyan, is <lb/>
      this:</p>
     <p>"When, after the lapse of some twenty minutes, the dead began to <reg orig="out-|number"
       >outnumber</reg>
      <lb/> the living;&mdash;when the fire slackened, as the marks grew few and far <lb/>
      between; then the troopers who had been drawn up to the right of the temple <lb/> plunged into
      the river, sabre between teeth, and pistol in hand. Thereupon <lb/> two half-caste Christian
      women, the wives of musicians in the band of the <lb/> Fifty-sixth, witnessed a scene which
      should not be related at second-hand. <lb/> 'In the boat where I was to have gone,' says Mrs.
      Bradshaw, confirmed <lb/> throughout by Mrs. Setts, 'was the school-mistress and twenty-two
      misses. <lb/> General Wheeler came last in a palkee. They carried him into the water <lb/>
      near the boat. I stood close by. He said, 'Carry me a little further towards <lb/> the boat.'
      But a trooper said, 'No, get out here.' As the General got out of <lb/> the palkee,
      headforemost, the trooper gave him a cut with his sword into the <lb/> neck, and he fell into
      the water. My son was killed near him. I saw it; <lb/> alas! alas! Some were stabbed with
      bayonets; others cut down. Little <reg orig="in-|fants">infants</reg>
      <lb/> were torn in pieces. We saw it; we did; and tell you only what we <lb/> saw. Other
      children were stabbed and thrown into the river. The <reg orig="school-|girls">schoolgirls</reg>
      <lb/> were burnt to death. I saw their clothes and hair catch fire. In the <lb/> water, a few
      paces off, by the next boat, we saw the youngest daughter of <lb/> Colonel Williams. A sepoy
      was going to kill her with his bayonet. She <lb/> said, 'My father was always kind to sepoys.'
      He turned away, and just <lb/> then a villager struck her on the head with a club, and she
      fell into the water <lb/> These people likewise saw good Mr. Moncrieff, the clergyman, take a
      book <lb/>
      <pb n="554" entity="DSSR_000002496_0569"/> from his pocket that he never had leisure to open,
      and heard him commence <lb/> a prayer for mercy which he was not permitted to conclude.
      Another <reg orig="de-|ponent">deponent</reg>
      <lb/> observed an European making for a drain like a scared water-rat, <lb/> when some
      boatmen, armed with cudgels, cut off his retreat, and beat him <lb/> down dead into the mud."</p>
     <p>The women and children who had been reserved from the <lb/> massacre were imprisoned during
      a fortnight in a small <reg orig="build-|ing">building</reg>, <lb/> one story
      high&mdash;a cramped place, a slightly modified <lb/> Black Hole of Calcutta. They were
      waiting in suspense; <lb/> there was none who could forecaste their fate. Meantime the <lb/>
      news of the massacre had traveled far and an army of rescuers <lb/> with Havelock at its head
      was on its way&mdash;at least an army <lb/> which hoped to be rescuers. It was crossing
      the country by <lb/> forced marches, and strewing its way with its own dead&mdash; <lb/>
      men struck down by cholera, and by a heat which reached <lb/> 135&deg;. It was in a
      vengeful fury, and it stopped for nothing&mdash; <lb/> neither heat, nor fatigue, nor
      disease, nor human opposition. <lb/> It tore its impetuous way through hostile forces, winning
       <reg orig="vic-|tory">victory</reg>
      <lb/> after victory, but still striding on and on, not halting to <lb/> count results. And at
      last, after this extraordinary march, it <lb/> arrived before the walls of Cawnpore, met the
      Nana's massed <lb/> strength, delivered a crushing defeat, and entered.</p>
     <p>But too late&mdash;only a few hours too late. For at the last <lb/> moment the Nana had
      decided upon the massacre of the <lb/> captive women and children, and had commissioned three
      <lb/> Mohammedans and two Hindoos to do the work. Sir G. O. <lb/> Trevelyan says:</p>
     <p>"Thereupon the five men entered. It was the short gloaming of <reg
       orig="Hindo-|stan&mdash;the">Hindostan&mdash;the</reg>
      <lb/> hour when ladies take their evening drive. She who had accosted <lb/> the officer was
      standing in the doorway. With her were the native doctor <lb/> and two Hindoo menials. That
      much of the business might be seen from the <lb/> veranda, but all else was concealed amidst
      the interior gloom. Shrieks and <lb/> scuffling acquainted those without that the journeymen
      were earning their <lb/> hire. Survur Khan soon emerged with his sword broken off at the hilt.
      He <lb/> procured another from the Nana's house, and a few minutes after appeared <lb/> again
      on the same errand. The third blade was of better temper; or perhaps <lb/> the thick of the
      work was already over. By the time darkness had closed in, <lb/>
      <pb n="555" entity="DSSR_000002496_0570"/> the men came forth and locked up the house for the
      night. Then the screams <lb/> ceased, but the groans lasted till morning.</p>
     <p>"The sun rose as usual. When he had been up nearly three hours the <lb/> five repaired to
      the scene of their labors over night. They were attended by <lb/> a few sweepers, who
      proceeded to transfer the contents of the house to a dry <lb/> well situated behind some trees
      which grew hard by. 'The bodies,' says one <lb/> who was present throughout, 'were dragged
      out, most of them by the hair of <lb/> the head. Those who had clothing worth taking were
      stripped. Some of the <lb/> women were alive. I cannot say how many; but <hi rend="italic"
       >three could speak.</hi> They <lb/> prayed for the sake of God that an end might be put to
      their sufferings. I <lb/> remarked one very stout woman, a half-caste, who was severely
      wounded in <lb/> both arms, who entreated to be killed. She and two or three others were <lb/>
      placed against the bank of the cut by which bullocks go down in drawing <lb/> water. The dead
      were first thrown in. Yes: there was a great crowd <reg orig="look-|ing">looking</reg>
      <lb/> on; they were standing along the walls of the compound. They were <lb/> principally city
      people and villagers. Yes: there were also sepoys. <hi rend="italic">Three <lb/> boys were
       alive</hi>. They were fair children. The eldest, I think, must have been <lb/> six or seven,
      and the youngest five years. They were running around the <lb/> well (where else
      could they go to?), and there was none to save them. No: <lb/> none said a word or
      tried to save them.'</p>
     <p>"At length the smallest of them made an infantile attempt to get away. <lb/> The little
      thing had been frightened past bearing by the murder of one of the <lb/> surviving ladies. He
      thus attracted the observation of a native who flung <lb/> him and his companions down the
      well."</p>
     <p>The soldiers had made a march of eighteen days, almost <lb/> without rest, to save the women
      and the children, and now <lb/> they were too late&mdash;all were dead and the assassin
      had flown. <lb/> What happened then, Trevelyan hesitated to put into words. <lb/> "Of what
      took place, the less said is the better."</p>
     <p>Then he continues:</p>
     <p>"But there was a spectacle to witness which might excuse much. Those <lb/> who, straight
      from the contested field, wandered sobbing through the rooms <lb/> of the ladies' house, saw
      what it were well could the outraged earth have <lb/> straightway hidden. The inner apartment
      was ankle-deep in blood. The <lb/> plaster was scored with sword-cuts; not high up as where
      men have fought, <lb/> but low down, and about the corners, as if a creature had crouched to
      avoid <lb/> the blow. Strips of dresses, vainly tied around the handles of the doors, <reg
       orig="sig-|nified">signified</reg>
      <lb/> the contrivance to which feminine despair had resorted as a means of <lb/> keeping out
      the murderers. Broken combs were there, and the frills of <reg orig="chil-|dren's">children's</reg>
      <lb/> trousers, and torn cuffs and pinafores, and little round hats, and one or <lb/> two
      shoes with burst latchets, and one or two daguerreotype cases with <lb/> cracked glasses. An
      officer picked up a few curls, preserved in a bit of <reg orig="card-|board">cardboard</reg>,
      <lb/> and marked 'Ned's hair, with love'; but around were strewn locks, <lb/> some near a yard
      in length, dissevered, not as a keepsake, by quite other <lb/> scissors."</p>
     <pb n="556" entity="DSSR_000002496_0571"/>
     <p>The battle of Waterloo was fought on the 18th of June, <lb/> 1815. I do not state this fact
      as a reminder to the reader, but <lb/> as news to him. For a forgotten fact <hi rend="italic"
       >is</hi> news when it comes <lb/> again. Writers of books have the fashion of whizzing by
      vast <lb/> and renowned historical events with the remark, "The details <lb/> of this
      tremendous episode are too familiar to the reader to <lb/> need repeating here." They know
      that that is not true. It is <lb/> a low kind of flattery. They know that the reader has <reg
       orig="for-|gotten">forgotten</reg>
      <lb/> every detail of it, and that nothing of the tremendous <lb/> event is left in his mind
      but a vague and formless luminous <lb/> smudge. Aside from the desire to flatter the reader,
      they <lb/> have another reason for making the remark&mdash;two reasons, <lb/> indeed.
      They do not remember the details themselves, and do <lb/> not want the trouble of hunting them
      up and copying them <lb/> out; also, they are afraid that if they search them out and <lb/>
      print them they will be scoffed at by the book-reviewers for <lb/> retelling those worn old

      mind the reviewer's jeer; <hi rend="italic">he</hi> doesn't <lb/> remember any of the worn old
      things until the book which he <lb/> is reviewing has retold them to him.</p>
     <p>I have made the quoted remark myself, at one time and <lb/> another, but I was not doing it
      to flatter the reader; I was <lb/> merely doing it to save work. If I had known the details

      <lb/> brushing up, I would have put them in; but I didn't, and <lb/> I did not want the labor
      of posting myself; so I said, "The <lb/> details of this tremendous episode are too familiar
      to the reader <lb/> to need repeating here." I do not like that kind of a lie; still, <lb/> it
      does save work.</p>
     <p>I am not trying to get out of repeating the details of the <lb/> Siege of Lucknow in fear of
      the reviewer; I am not leaving <lb/> them out in fear that they would not interest the reader;
      I am <lb/> leaving them out partly to save work; mainly for lack of room. <lb/> It is a pity,
      too; for there is not a dull place anywhere in the <lb/> great story.</p>
     <pb n="557" entity="DSSR_000002496_0572"/>
     <p>Ten days before the outbreak (May 10th) of the Mutiny, <lb/> all was
      serene at Lucknow, the huge capital of Oudh, the <reg orig="King-|dom">Kingdom</reg>
      <lb/> which had recently been seized by the India Company. <lb/> There was a great garrison,
      composed of about 7,000 native <lb/> troops and between 700 and 800 whites. These white
      soldiers <lb/> and their families were probably the only people of their race <lb/> there; at
      their elbow was that swarming population of warlike <lb/> natives, a race of born soldiers,
      brave, daring, and fond of <lb/> fighting. On high ground just outside the city stood the
      <lb/> palace of that great personage, the Resident, the representative <lb/> of British power
      and authority. It stood in the midst of <lb/> spacious grounds, with its due complement of
      outbuildings, <lb/> and the grounds were enclosed by a wall&mdash;a wall not for <lb/>
      defense, but for privacy. The mutinous spirit was in the air, <lb/> but the whites were not
      afraid, and did not feel much <lb/> troubled.</p>
     <p>Then came the outbreak at Meerut, then the capture of <lb/> Delhi by the mutineers; in June
      came the three-weeks <lb/> leaguer of Sir Hugh Wheeler in his open lot at Cawnpore&mdash;
      <lb/> 40 miles distant from Lucknow&mdash;then the treacherous <reg orig="massa-|cre"
       >massacre</reg>
      <lb/> of that gallant little garrison; and now the great revolt <lb/> was in full flower, and
      the comfortable condition of things at <lb/> Lucknow was instantly changed.</p>
     <p>There was an outbreak there, and Sir Henry Lawrence <lb/> marched out of the Residency on
      the 30th of June to put it <lb/> down, but was defeated with heavy loss, and had difficulty in
      <lb/> getting back again. That night the memorable siege of the <lb/>
      Residency&mdash;called the siege of Lucknow&mdash;began. Sir Henry <lb/> was killed
      three days later, and Brigadier Inglis succeeded him <lb/> in command.</p>
     <p>Outside of the Residency fence was an immense host of <lb/> hostile and confident native
      besiegers; inside it were 480 loyal <lb/> native soldiers, 730 white ones, and 500 women and
      children. <lb/>
      <pb n="558" entity="DSSR_000002496_0573"/> In those days the English garrisons always managed
      to <reg orig="ham-|per">hamper</reg>
      <lb/> themselves sufficiently with women and children.</p>
     <p>The natives established themselves in houses close at hand <lb/> and began to rain bullets
      and cannon-balls into the Residency; <lb/> and this they kept up, night and day, during four
      months and <lb/> a half, the little garrison industriously replying all the time. <lb/> The
      women and children soon became so used to the roar of <lb/> the guns that it ceased to disturb
      their sleep. The children <lb/> imitated siege and defense in their play. The
      women&mdash;with <lb/> any pretext, or with none&mdash;would sally out into the <reg
       orig="storm-|swept">storm-swept</reg>
      <lb/> grounds.</p>
     <p>The defense was kept up week after week, with stubborn <lb/> fortitude, in the midst of
      death, which came in many forms&mdash; <lb/> by bullet, small-pox, cholera, and by
      various diseases induced <lb/> by unpalatable and insufficient food, by the long hours of
      <lb/> wearying and exhausting overwork in the daily and nightly <lb/> battle in the oppressive
      Indian heat, and by the broken rest <lb/> caused by the intolerable pest of mosquitoes, flies,
      mice, rats, <lb/> and fleas.</p>
     <p>Six weeks after the beginning of the siege more than <reg orig="one-|half">one-half</reg>
      <lb/> of the original force of white soldiers was dead, and close <lb/> upon three-fifths of
      the original native force.</p>
     <p>But the fighting went on just the same. The enemy <lb/> mined, the English counter-mined,
      and, turn about, they blew <lb/> up each other's posts. The Residency grounds were <reg
       orig="honey-|combed">honeycombed</reg>
      <lb/> with the enemy's tunnels. Deadly courtesies were <lb/> constantly
      exchanged&mdash;sorties by the English in the night; <lb/> rushes by the enemy in the
      night&mdash;rushes whose purpose was <lb/> to breach the walls or scale them; rushes
      which cost heavily, <lb/> and always failed.</p>
     <p>The ladies got used to all the horrors of war&mdash;the shrieks <lb/> of mutilated men,
      the sight of blood and death. Lady Inglis <lb/> makes this mention in her diary:</p>
     <pb entity="DSSR_000002496_0574"/>
     <figure id="f144" rend="page" entity="DSSR_000002496_0574">

     <p>"Mrs. Bruere's nurse was carried past our door to-day, wounded in the <lb/> eye To extract
      the bullet it was found necessary to take out the eye&mdash;a <lb/> fearful operation.
      Her mistress held her while it was performed."</p>
     <p>The first relieving force failed to relieve. It was under <lb/> Havelock and Outram, and
      arrived when the siege had been <lb/> going on for three months. It fought its desperate way
      to <lb/> Lucknow, then fought its way through the city against odds of <lb/> a hundred to one,
      and entered the Residency; but there was <lb/> not enough left of it, then, to do any good. It
      lost more men <lb/> in its last fight than it found in the Residency when it got in. <lb/> It
      became captive itself.</p>
     <p>The fighting and starving and dying by bullets and disease <lb/> went steadily on. Both
      sides fought with energy and industry. <lb/> Captain Birch puts this striking incident in
      evidence. He is <lb/> speaking of the third month of the siege:</p>
     <p>"As an instance of the heavy firing brought to bear on our position this <lb/> month may be
      mentioned the cutting down of the upper story of a brick <lb/> building simply by <hi
       rend="italic">musketry firing.</hi> This building was in a most exposed <lb/> position. All
      the shots which just missed the top of the rampart cut into the <lb/> dead wall pretty much in
      a straight line, and at length cut right through and <lb/> brought the upper story tumbling
      down. The upper structure on the top of <lb/> the brigade-mess also fell in. The Residency
      house was a wreck. Captain <lb/> Anderson's post had long ago been knocked down, and Innes'
      post also fell <lb/> in. These two were riddled with round shot. As many as 200 were picked
      <lb/> up by Colonel Masters."</p>
     <p>The exhausted garrison fought doggedly on all through the <lb/> next
      month&mdash;October. Then, November 2d, news came&mdash; <lb/> Sir Colin Campbell's
      relieving force would soon be on its way <lb/> from Cawnpore.</p>
     <p>On the 12th the boom of his guns was heard.</p>
     <p>On the 13th the sounds came nearer&mdash;he was slowly, but <lb/> steadily, cutting his
      way through, storming one stronghold <lb/> after another.</p>
     <p>On the 14th he captured the Martiniere College, and ran up <lb/> the British flag there. It
      was seen from the Residency.</p>
     <p>Next he took the Dilkoosha.</p>
     <pb n="562" entity="DSSR_000002496_0577"/>
     <p>On the 17th he took the former mess-house of the 32d <lb/> regiment&mdash;a fortified
      building, and very strong. "A most <lb/> exciting, anxious day," writes Lady Inglis in her
      diary. <lb/> "About 4 P.M., two strange officers walked through our yard, <lb/> leading their
      horses"&mdash;and by that sign she knew that <reg orig="com-|munication">communication</reg>
      <lb/> was established between the forces, that the relief <lb/> was real, this time, and that
      the long siege of Lucknow was <lb/> ended.</p>
     <p>The last eight or ten miles of Sir Colin Campbell's march <lb/> was through seas of blood.
      The weapon mainly used was the <lb/> bayonet, the fighting was desperate. The way was <reg
       orig="mile-|stoned">milestoned</reg>
      <lb/> with detached strong buildings of stone, fortified, and <lb/> heavily garrisoned, and
      these had to be taken by assault. <lb/> Neither side asked for quarter, and neither gave it.
      At the <lb/> Secundrabagh, where nearly two thousand of the enemy <reg orig="oc-|cupied"
       >occupied</reg>
      <lb/> a great stone house in a garden, the work of slaughter <lb/> was continued until every
      man was killed. That is a sample <lb/> of the character of that devastating march.</p>
     <p>There were but few trees in the plain at that time, and <lb/> from the Residency the
      progress of the march, step by step, <lb/> victory by victory, could be noted; the ascending
      clouds of <lb/> battle-smoke marked the way to the eye, and the thunder of <lb/> the guns
      marked it to the ear.</p>
     <p>Sir Colin Campbell had not come to Lucknow to hold it, <lb/> but to save the occupants of
      the Residency, and bring them <lb/> away. Four or five days after his arrival the secret <reg
       orig="evacua-|tion">evacuation</reg>
      <lb/> by the troops took place, in the middle of a dark night, <lb/> by the principal gate
      (the Bailie Guard). The two hundred <lb/> women and two hundred and fifty
      children had been previously <lb/> removed. Captain Birch says:</p>
     <p>"And now commenced a movement of the most perfect arrangement and <lb/> successful
      generalship&mdash;the withdrawal of the whole of the various forces, a <lb/> combined
      movement requiring the greatest care and skill. First, the <reg orig="garri-|son">garrison</reg>

      garrison in turn fell in <lb/> behind it, and so passed out through the Bailie Guard gate,
      till the whole of <lb/> our position was evacuated. Then Havelock's force was similarly <reg
       orig="with-|drawn">withdrawn</reg>, <lb/> post by post, marching in rear of our garrison.
      After them in turn <lb/> came the forces of the Commander-in-Chief, which joined on in the
      rear of <lb/> Havelock's force. Regiment by regiment was withdrawn with the utmost <lb/> order
      and regularity. The whole operation resembled the movement of a <lb/> telescope. Stern silence
      was kept, and the enemy took no alarm."</p>
     <p>Lady Inglis, referring to her husband and to General Sir <lb/> James Outram, sets down the
      closing detail of this impressive <lb/> midnight retreat, in darkness and by stealth, of this
      shadowy <lb/> host through the gate which it had defended so long and so <lb/> well:</p>
     <p>"At twelve precisely they marched out, John and Sir James Outram <reg orig="re-|maining"
       >remaining</reg>
      <lb/> till all had passed, and then they took off their hats to the Bailie <lb/> Guard, the
      scene of as noble a defense as I think history will ever have to <lb/> relate."</p>

     <p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> were driven over Sir Colin Campbell's route by a <lb/> British
      officer, and when I arrived at the Residency <lb/> I was so familiar with the road that I
      could have led a <lb/> retreat over it myself; but the compass in my head has been <lb/> out
      of order from my birth, and so, as soon as I was within the <lb/> battered Bailie Guard and
      turned about to review the march <lb/> and imagine the relieving forces storming their way
      along it, <lb/> everything was upside down and wrong end first in a moment, <lb/> and I was
      never able to get straightened out again. And <lb/> now, when I look at the battle-plan, the
      confusion remains. <lb/> In me the east was born west, the battle-plans which have the <lb/>
      east on the right-hand side are of no use to me.</p>
     <p>The Residency ruins are draped with flowering vines, and <lb/> are impressive and beautiful.
      They and the grounds are <lb/> sacred now, and will suffer no neglect nor be profaned by any
      <lb/> sordid or commercial use while the British remain masters of <lb/> India. Within the
      grounds are buried the dead who gave up <lb/> their lives there in the long siege.</p>
     <p>After a fashion, I was able to imagine the fiery storm that <lb/> raged night and day over
      the place during so many months, <lb/> and after a fashion I could imagine the men moving

      <pb n="569" entity="DSSR_000002496_0584"/> Lady Inglis' diary that the children carried on
      their small <lb/> affairs very much as if blood and carnage and the crash and <lb/> thunder of
      a siege were natural and proper features of nursery <lb/> life, and I tried to realize it; but
      when her little Johnny came <lb/> rushing, all excitement, through the din and smoke,
      shouting, <lb/> "Oh, mamma, the white hen has laid an egg!" I saw that I <lb/> could not do
      it. Johnny's place was under the bed. I could <lb/> imagine him there, because I could imagine
      myself there; and <lb/> I think I should not have been interested in a hen that was <reg
       orig="lay-|ing">laying</reg>
      <lb/> an egg; my interest would have been with the parties that <lb/> were laying the
      bombshells. I sat at dinner with one of those <lb/> children in the Club's Indian palace, and
      I knew that all <lb/> through the siege he was perfecting his teething and learning <lb/> to
      talk; and while to me he was the most impressive object <lb/> in Lucknow after the Residency
      ruins, I was not able to <reg orig="imag-|ine">imagine</reg>
      <lb/> what his life had been during that tempestuous infancy of <lb/> his, nor what sort of a
      curious surprise it must have been to <lb/> him to be marched suddenly out into a strange dumb
      world <lb/> where there wasn't any noise, and nothing going on. He was <lb/> only forty-one
      when I saw him, a strangely youthful link to <lb/> connect the present with so ancient an
      episode as the Great <lb/> Mutiny.</p>
     <p>By and by we saw Cawnpore, and the open lot which was <lb/> the scene of Moore's memorable
      defense, and the spot on the <lb/> shore of the Ganges where the massacre of the betrayed <reg
       orig="garri-|son">garrison</reg>
      <lb/> occurred, and the small Indian temple whence the <reg orig="bugle-|signal">bugle-signal</reg>
      <lb/> notified the assassins to fall on. This latter was a <lb/> lonely spot, and silent. The
      sluggish river drifted by, almost <lb/> currentless. It was dead low water, narrow channels
      with <lb/> vast sandbars between, all the way across the wide bed; and <lb/> the only living
      thing in sight was that grotesque and solemn <lb/> bald-headed bird, the Adjutant, standing on
      his six-foot stilts, <lb/> solitary on a distant bar, with his head sunk between his</p>
     <pb n="570" entity="DSSR_000002496_0585"/>
     <p>shoulders, thinking; thinking of his prize, I suppose&mdash;the <lb/> dead Hindoo that
      lay awash at his feet, and whether to eat <lb/> him alone or invite friends. He and his prey
      were a proper <lb/> accent to that mournful place. They were in keeping with it, <lb/> they
      emphasized its loneliness and its solemnity.</p>
     <p>And we saw the scene of the slaughter of the helpless <lb/> women and children, and also the
      costly memorial that is built <lb/> over the well which contains their remains. The Black Hole
      <lb/> of Calcutta is gone, but a more reverent age is come, and <lb/> whatever remembrancer
      still exists of the moving and heroic <lb/> sufferings and achievements of the garrisons of
      Lucknow and <lb/> Cawnpore will be guarded and preserved.</p>
     <p>In Agra and its neighborhood, and afterwards at Delhi, we <lb/> saw forts, mosques, and
      tombs, which were built in the great <lb/> days of the Mohammedan emperors, and which are
      marvels of <lb/> cost, magnitude, and richness of materials and ornamentation, <lb/> creations
      of surpassing grandeur, wonders which do indeed <lb/> make the like things in the rest of the
      world seem tame and <lb/> inconsequential by comparison. I am not purposing to <lb/> describe
      them. By good fortune I had not read too much <lb/> about them, and therefore was able to get
      a natural and <lb/> rational focus upon them, with the result that they thrilled, <lb/>
      blessed, and exalted me. But if I had previously overheated <lb/> my imagination by drinking
      too much pestilential literary <lb/> hot Scotch, I should have suffered disappointment and
      sorrow.</p>
     <p>I mean to speak of only one of these many world-renowned <lb/> buildings, the Taj Mahal, the
      most celebrated construction in <lb/> the earth. I had read a great deal too much about it. I
      saw <lb/> it in the daytime, I saw it in the moonlight, I saw it near at <lb/> hand, I saw it
      from a distance; and I knew all the time, that <lb/> of its kind it was <hi rend="italic"
      >the</hi> wonder of the world, with no competitor <lb/> now and no possible future competitor;
      and yet, it was not <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Taj. My Taj had been built by excitable literary people; <lb/> it
      was solidly lodged in my head, and I could not blast it out.</p>
     <pb n="571" entity="DSSR_000002496_0586"/>
     <p>I wish to place before the reader some of the usual <reg orig="descrip-|tions">descriptions</reg>
      <lb/> of the Taj, and ask him to take note of the impressions <lb/> left in his mind. These
      descriptions do really state the truth <lb/> &mdash;as nearly as the limitations of
      language will allow. But <lb/> language is a treacherous thing, a most unsure vehicle, and it
      <lb/> can seldom arrange descriptive words in such a way that they <lb/> will not inflate the
      facts&mdash;by help of the reader's imagination, <lb/> which is always ready to take a
      hand, and work for nothing, <lb/> and do the bulk of it at that.</p>
     <p>I will begin with a few sentences from the excellent little <lb/> local guide-book of Mr.
      Satya Chandra Mukerji. I take them <lb/> from here and there in his description:</p>
     <p>"The inlaid work of the Taj and the flowers and petals that are to be <lb/> found on all
      sides on the surface of the marble evince a most delicate touch."</p>
     <p>That is true.</p>
     <p>"The inlaid work, the marble, the flowers, the buds, the leaves, the <lb/> petals, and the
      lotus stems are almost without a rival in the whole of the <reg orig="civ-|ilized">civilized</reg>
      <lb/> world."</p>
     <p>"The work of inlaying with stones and gems is found in the highest <reg orig="per-|fection"
       >perfection</reg>
      <lb/> in the Taj."</p>
     <p>Gems, inlaid flowers, buds, and leaves to be found on all <lb/> sides. What do you see
      before you? Is the fairy structure <lb/> growing? Is it becoming a jewel casket?</p>
     <p>"The whole of the Taj produces a wonderful effect that is equally <reg orig="sub-|lime"
       >sublime</reg>
      <lb/> and beautiful."</p>
     <p>Then Sir William Wilson Hunter:</p>
     <p>"The Taj Mahal with its beautiful domes, 'a dream of marble,' rises on <lb/> the river
      bank."</p>
     <p>"The materials are white marble and red sandstone."</p>
     <p>"The complexity of its design and the delicate intricacy of the <reg orig="workman-|ship"
       >workmanship</reg>
      <lb/> baffle description."</p>
     <p>Sir William continues. I will italicize some of his words:</p>
     <p>"The mausoleum stands on a raised marble platform at each of whose <lb/> corners rises a
      tall and slender minaret of graceful proportions and of <reg orig="ex-|quisite">exquisite</reg>
      <lb/> beauty. Beyond the platform stretch the two wings, one of which is <lb/> itself a mosque
      of great architectural merit. In the center of the whole <reg orig="de-|sign">design</reg>
      <lb/> the mausoleum occupies a square of 186 feet, with the angles deeply <lb/> truncated so
      as to form an unequal octagon. The main feature in this central</p>
     <pb n="572" entity="DSSR_000002496_0587"/>
     <p>pile is the great dome, which swells upward to nearly two-thirds of a sphere <lb/> and
      tapers at its extremity into a pointed spire crowned by a crescent. <lb/> Beneath it an
      enclosure of marble trellis-work surrounds the tomb of the <lb/> princess and of her husband,
      the Emperor. Each corner of the mausoleum is <lb/> covered by a similar though much smaller
      dome erected on a pediment pierced <lb/> with graceful Saracenic arches. Light is admitted
      into the interior through a <lb/> double screen of pierced marble, which tempers the glare of
      an Indian sky <lb/> while its whiteness prevents the mellow effect from degenerating into
      gloom. <lb/> The internal decorations consist of inlaid work in <hi rend="italic">precious
       stones, such as agate, <lb/> jasper, etc., with which every squandril or salient point in the
       architecture is <lb/> richly fretted</hi>. Brown and violet marble is also freely employed in
      wreaths, <lb/> scrolls, and lintels to relieve the monotony of white wall. <hi rend="italic"
       >In regard to color <lb/> and design, the interior of the Taj may rank first in the world for
       purely <reg orig="decora-|tive">decorative</reg>
       <lb/> workmanship</hi>; while the perfect symmetry of its exterior, once seen can <lb/> never
      be forgotten, nor the a&auml;rial grace of its domes, rising like marble <reg
       orig="bub-|bles">bubbles</reg>
      <lb/> into the clear sky. The Taj represents the most highly elaborated stage <lb/> of
      ornamentation reached by the Indo-Mohammedan builders, the stage in <lb/> which the architect
      ends and the <hi rend="italic">jeweler</hi> begins. In its magnificent gateway <lb/> the
      diagonal ornamentation at the corners, which satisfied the designers of the <lb/> gateways of
      Itimad-ud-doulah and Sikandra mausoleums is superseded by <lb/> fine marble cables, in bold
      twists, strong and handsome. The triangular <lb/> insertions of white marble and large flowers
      have in like manner given place <lb/> to <hi rend="italic">fine inlaid work</hi>. Firm
      perpendicular lines in black marble with well <reg orig="pro-|portioned">proportioned</reg>
      <lb/> panels of the same material are effectively used in the interior of the <lb/> gateway.
      On its top the Hindu brackets and monolithic architraves of <lb/> Sikandra are replaced by
      Moorish carped arches, usually single blocks of red <lb/> sandstone, in the Kiosks and
      pavilions which adorn the roof. From the <reg orig="pil-|lared">pillared</reg>
      <lb/> pavilions a magnificent view is obtained of the Taj gardens below, with <lb/> the noble
      Jumna river at their farther end, and the city and fort of Agra in <lb/> the distance. From
      this beautiful and splendid gateway one passes up a <lb/> straight alley shaded by evergreen
      trees cooled by a broad shallow piece of <lb/> water running along the middle of the path to
      the Taj itself. <hi rend="italic">The Taj is <lb/> entirely of marble and gems</hi>. The red
      sandstone of the other Mohammedan <lb/> buildings has entirely disappeared, or rather the red
      sandstone which used to <lb/> form the thickness of the walls, is in the Taj itself overlaid
      completely with <lb/> white marble, and the white marble is itself <hi rend="italic">inlaid
       with precious stones arranged <lb/> in lovely patterns of flowers</hi>. A feeling of purity
      impresses itself on the eye <lb/> and the mind from the absence of the coarser material which
      forms so <reg orig="invari-|able">invariable</reg>
      <lb/> a material in Agra architecture. The lower wall and panels are covered <lb/> with
      tulips, oleanders, and full-blown lilies, in flat carving on the white marble; <lb/> and <hi
       rend="italic">although the inlaid work of flowers done in gems</hi> is very <hi rend="italic"
       >brilliant</hi> when <lb/> looked at closely, there is on the whole but little color, and the
      all-prevailing <lb/> sentiment is one of whiteness, silence, and calm. The whiteness is broken
      <lb/> only by the fine color of the inlaid gems, by lines in black marble, and by <lb/>
      delicately written inscriptions, also in black, from the Koran. Under the dome <lb/> of <hi
       rend="italic">the vast mausoleum</hi> a high and beautiful screen of open tracery in white
      <lb/> marble rises around the two tombs, or rather cenotaphs of the emperor and <lb/>
      <pb n="573" entity="DSSR_000002496_0588"/> his princess; and in this <hi rend="italic">marvel
       of marble</hi> the carving has advanced from the <lb/> old geometrical patterns to a
      trellis-work of flowers and foliage, handled with <lb/> great freedom and spirit. The two
      cenotaphs in the center of the <hi rend="italic">exquisite </hi>
      <lb/> enclosure have no carving except the plain <hi rend="italic">Kalamdan</hi> or oblong
      pen-box on <lb/> the tomb of Emperor Shah Jehan. But both cenotaphs are <hi rend="italic"
       >inlaid with <lb/> flowers made of costly gems,</hi>and with the ever graceful oleander
      scroll."</p>
     <p>Bayard Taylor, after describing the details of the Taj, goes <lb/> on to say:</p>
     <p>"On both sides the palm, the banyan, and the feathery bamboo mingle <lb/> their foliage; the
      song of birds meets your ears, and the odor of roses and <lb/> lemon flowers sweetens the air.
      Down such a vista and over such a <reg orig="fore-|ground">foreground</reg>
      <lb/> rises the Taj. There is no mystery, no sense of partial failure about <lb/> the Taj. A
       <hi rend="italic">thing of perfect beauty and of absolute finish</hi> in every detail, it
      <lb/> might pass for the work of genii who knew naught of the weaknesses and ills <lb/> with
      which mankind are beset."</p>
     <p>All of these details are true. But, taken together, they <lb/> state a
      falsehood&mdash;to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. You cannot add them up correctly. <lb/>
      Those writers know the values of their words and phrases, but <lb/> to you the words and
      phrases convey other and uncertain <lb/> values. To those writers their phrases have values
      which I <lb/> think I am now acquainted with; and for the help of the <lb/> reader I will here
      repeat certain of those words and phrases, <lb/> and follow them with numerals which shall
      represent those <lb/> values&mdash;then we shall see the difference between a writer's
      <lb/> ciphering and a mistaken reader's:</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">Precious stones, such as agate, jasper, etc.</hi>&mdash;5.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">With which every salient point is richly fretted</hi>&mdash;5.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">First in the world for purely decorative workmanship</hi>&mdash;9.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">The Taj represents the stage where the architect ends and the <lb/>
       jeweler begins</hi>&mdash;5.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">The Taj is entirely of marble and gems</hi>&mdash;7.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">Inlaid with precious stones in lovely patterns of
      flowers</hi>&mdash;5.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">The inlaid work of flowers done in gems is very brilliant</hi>&mdash;
      <lb/> (followed by a most important modification which the reader <lb/> is sure to
      read too carelessly)&mdash;2.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">The vast mausoleum</hi>&mdash;5.</p>
     <pb n="574" entity="DSSR_000002496_0589"/>

     </p>
     <p>
      <hi rend="italic">The exquisite enclosure&mdash;5. </hi>
     </p>
     <p>
      <hi rend="italic">Inlaid with flowers made of costly gems&mdash;5. </hi>
     </p>
     <p>
      <hi rend="italic">A thing of perfect beauty and absolute finish&mdash;5. </hi>
     </p>
     <p>Those details are correct; the figures which I have placed <lb/> after them represent quite
      fairly their individual values. <lb/> Then why, as a whole, do they convey a false impression
      to <lb/> the reader? It is because the reader&mdash;beguiled by his heated <lb/>
      imagination&mdash;masses them in the wrong way. The <hi rend="italic">writer </hi>
      <lb/> would mass the first three figures in the following way, and <lb/> they would speak the
      truth:</p>
     <table>
      <row>
       <cell rend="right">5</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell rend="right">5</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell rend="right">9</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell rend="right">&mdash;</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
       <cell rend="right">Total&mdash;19</cell>
      </row>
     </table>
     <p>But the reader masses them thus&mdash;and then they tell a lie <lb/> &mdash;559.</p>
     <p>The writer would add all of his twelve numerals together, <lb/> and then the sum would
      express the whole truth about the Taj, <lb/> and the truth only&mdash;63.</p>
     <p>But the reader&mdash;always helped by his imagination&mdash; <lb/> would put the
      figures in a row one after the other, and get this <lb/> sum, which would tell him a noble big
      lie: <lb/>
      <q rend="center">559575255555.</q></p>
     <p>You must put in the commas yourself; I have to go on <lb/> with my work.</p>
     <p>The reader will always be sure to put the figures together <lb/> in that wrong way, and then
      as surely before him will stand, <lb/> sparkling in the sun, a gem-crusted Taj tall as the
      Matterhorn.</p>
     <p>I had to visit Niagara fifteen times before I succeeded in <lb/> getting my imaginary Falls
      gauged to the actuality and could <lb/> begin to sanely and wholesomely wonder at them for
      what they <lb/> were, not what I hassd expected them to be. When I first <reg

      <pb n="577" entity="DSSR_000002496_0592"/> them it was with my face lifted toward the sky, for
      <lb/> I thought I was going to see an Atlantic ocean pouring down <lb/> thence over
      cloud-vexed Himalayan heights, a sea-green wall <lb/> of water sixty miles front and six miles
      high, and so, when the <lb/> toy reality came suddenly into view&mdash;that beruffled
      little wet <lb/> apron hanging out to dry&mdash;the shock was too much for me, <lb/> and
      I fell with a dull thud.</p>
     <p>Yet slowly, surely, steadily, in the course of my fifteen visits, <lb/> the proportions
      adjusted themselves to the facts, and I came at <lb/> last to realize that a waterfall a
      hundred and sixty-five feet <lb/> high and a quarter of a mile wide was an impressive thing.
      It <lb/> was not a dipperful to my vanished great vision, but it would <lb/> answer.</p>
     <p>I know that I ought to do with the Taj as I was obliged to <lb/> do with
      Niagara&mdash;see it fifteen times, and let my mind <reg orig="grad-|ually">gradually</reg>
      <lb/> get rid of the Taj built in it by its describers, by help of <lb/> my imagination, and
      substitute for it the Taj of fact. It <lb/> would be noble and fine, then, and a marvel; not
      the marvel <lb/> which it replaced, but still a marvel, and fine enough. I am a <lb/> careless
      reader, I suppose&mdash;an <hi rend="italic">impressionist</hi> reader; an <reg
       orig="im-|pressionist">impressionist</reg>
      <lb/> reader of what is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> an impressionist picture; a <lb/> reader
      who overlooks the informing details or masses their <lb/> sum improperly, and gets only a
      large splashy, general effect <lb/> &mdash;an effect which is not correct, and which is
      not warranted <lb/> by the particulars placed before me&mdash;particulars which I did
      <lb/> not examine, and whose meanings I did not cautiously and <lb/> carefully estimate. It is
      an effect which is some thirty-five or <lb/> forty times finer than the reality, and is
      therefore a great deal <lb/> better and more valuable than the reality; and so, I ought <lb/>
      never to hunt up the reality, but stay miles away from it, and <lb/> thus preserve undamaged
      my own private mighty Niagara <lb/> tumbling out of the vault of heaven, and my own ineffable
      Taj, <lb/>
      <pb n="578" entity="DSSR_000002496_0593"/> built of tinted mists upon jeweled arches of
      rainbows supported <lb/> by colonnades of moonlight. It is a mistake for a person with <lb/>
      an unregulated imagination to go and look at an illustrious <lb/> world's wonder.</p>
     <p>I suppose that many, many years ago I gathered the idea <lb/> that the Taj's place in the
      achievements of man was exactly <lb/> the place of the ice-storm in the achievements of
      Nature; that <lb/> the Taj represented man's supremest possibility in the creation <lb/> of
      grace and beauty and exquisiteness and splendor, just as the <lb/> ice-storm represents
      Nature's supremest possibility in the <reg orig="com-|bination">combination</reg>
      <lb/> of those same qualities. I do not know how long ago <lb/> that idea was bred in me, but
      I know that I cannot remember <lb/> back to a time when the thought of either of these symbols
      of <lb/> gracious and unapproachable perfection did not at once suggest <lb/> the other. If I
      thought of the ice-storm, the Taj rose before <lb/> me divinely beautiful; if I thought of the
      Taj, with its <reg orig="en-|crustings">encrustings</reg>
      <lb/> and inlayings of jewels, the vision of the ice-storm <lb/> rose. And so, to me, all
      these years, the Taj has had no rival <lb/> among the temples and palaces of men, none that
      even <reg orig="re-|motely">remotely</reg>
      <lb/> approached it&mdash;it was man's architectural ice-storm. </p>
     <p>Here in London the other night I was talking with some <lb/> Scotch and English friends, and
      I mentioned the ice-storm, <lb/> using it as a figure&mdash;a figure which failed, for
      none of them <lb/> had heard of the ice-storm. One gentleman, who was very <lb/> familiar with
      American literature, said he had never seen it <lb/> mentioned in any book. That is strange.
      And I, myself, was <lb/> not able to say that I had seen it mentioned in a book; and <lb/> yet
      the autumn foliage, with all other American scenery, has <lb/> received full and competent
      attention.</p>
     <p>The oversight is strange, for in America the ice-storm is an <lb/> event. And it is not an
      event which one is careless about. <lb/> When it comes, the news flies from room to room in
      the <lb/> house, there are bangings on the doors, and shoutings, "The <lb/>
      <pb n="579" entity="DSSR_000002496_0594"/> ice-storm! the ice-storm!" and even the laziest
      sleepers throw <lb/> off the covers and join the rush for the windows. The <reg
       orig="ice-|storm">ice-storm</reg>
      <lb/> occurs in mid-winter, and usually its enchantments are <lb/> wrought in the silence and
      the darkness of the night. A <lb/> fine drizzling rain falls hour after hour upon the naked
      twigs <lb/> and branches of the trees, and as it falls it freezes. In time <lb/> the trunk and
      every branch and twig are incased in hard pure <lb/> ice; so that the tree looks like a
      skeleton tree made all of <lb/> glass&mdash;glass that is crystal-clear. All along the
      under side of <lb/> every branch and twig is a comb of little icicles&mdash;the frozen
      <lb/> drip. Sometimes these pendants do not quite amount to <lb/> icicles, but are round
      beads&mdash;frozen tears.</p>
     <p>The weather clears, toward dawn, and leaves a brisk pure <lb/> atmosphere and a sky without
      a shred of cloud in it&mdash;and <lb/> everything is still, there is not a breath of
      wind. The dawn <lb/> breaks and spreads, the news of the storm goes about the <lb/> house, and
      the little and the big, in wraps and blankets, flock <lb/> to the window and press together
      there, and gaze intently out <lb/> upon the great white ghost in the grounds, and nobody says
      a <lb/> word, nobody stirs. All are waiting; they know what is <lb/> coming, and they are
      waiting&mdash;waiting for the miracle. The <lb/> minutes drift on and on and on, with not
      a sound but the <lb/> ticking of the clock; at last the sun fires a sudden sheaf of <lb/> rays
      into the ghostly tree and turns it into a white splendor of <lb/> glittering diamonds.
      Everybody catches his breath, and feels <lb/> a swelling in his throat and a moisture in his
      eyes&mdash;but waits <lb/> again; for he knows what is coming; there is more yet. The
      <lb/> sun climbs higher, and still higher, flooding the tree from its <lb/> loftiest spread of
      branches to its lowest, turning it to a glory of <lb/> white fire; then in a moment, without
      warning, comes the <lb/> great miracle, the supreme miracle, the miracle without its <reg
       orig="fel-|low">fellow</reg>
      <lb/> in the earth; a gust of wind sets every branch and twig <lb/> to swaying, and in an
      instant turns the whole white tree into a <lb/>
      <pb n="580" entity="DSSR_000002496_0595"/> spouting and spraying explosion of flashing gems of
      every <lb/> conceivable color; and there it stands and sways this way and <lb/> that, flash!
      flash! flash! a dancing and glancing world of <lb/> rubies, emeralds, diamonds, sapphires, the
      most radiant <reg orig="specta-|cle">spectacle</reg>, <lb/> the most blinding spectacle, the
      divinest, the most <reg orig="ex-|quisite">exquisite</reg>, <lb/> the most intoxicating vision
      of fire and color and <lb/> intolerable and unimaginable splendor that ever any eye has <lb/>
      rested upon in this world, or will ever rest upon outside of the <lb/> gates of heaven.</p>
     <p>By all my senses, all my faculties, I know that the <reg orig="ice-|storm">ice-storm</reg>
      <lb/> is Nature's supremest achievement in the domain of the <lb/> superb and the beautiful;
      and by my reason, at least, I know <lb/> that the Taj is man's ice-storm.</p>
     <p>In the ice-storm every one of the myriad ice-beads pendant <lb/> from twig and branch is an
      individual gem, and changes color <lb/> with every motion caused by the wind; each tree
      carries a <lb/> million, and a forest-front exhibits the splendors of the single <lb/> tree
      multiplied by a thousand.</p>
     <p>It occurs to me now that I have never seen the ice-storm <lb/> put upon canvas, and have not
      heard that any painter has tried <lb/> to do it. I wonder why that is. Is it that paint cannot
       <reg orig="coun-|terfeit">counterfeit</reg>
      <lb/> the intense blaze of a sun-flooded jewel? There should <lb/> be, and must be, a reason,
      and a good one, why the most <lb/> enchanting sight that Nature has created has been neglected
      <lb/> by the brush.</p>
     <p>Often, the surest way to convey misinformation is to tell <lb/> the strict truth. The
      describers of the Taj have used the word <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">gem</hi> in its strictest sense&mdash;its scientific sense. In that
      sense it <lb/> is a mild word, and promises but little to the eye&mdash;nothing <lb/>
      bright, nothing brilliant, nothing sparkling, nothing splendid in <lb/> the way of color. It
       <hi rend="italic">accurately</hi> describes the sober and <reg orig="unob-|trusive"
       >unobtrusive</reg>
      <lb/> gem-work of the Taj; that is, to the very <reg orig="highly-|educated">highly-educated</reg>
      <lb/> one person in a thousand; but it most falsely describes <lb/>
      <pb n="581" entity="DSSR_000002496_0596"/> it to the 999. But the 999 are the people who ought
      to be <reg orig="es-|pecially">especially</reg>
      <lb/> taken care of, and to them it does not mean <reg orig="quiet-|colored">quiet-colored</reg>
      <lb/> designs wrought in carnelians, or agates, or such <lb/> things; they know the word in
      its wide and ordinary sense <lb/> only, and so to them it means diamonds and rubies and opals
      <lb/> and their kindred, and the moment their eyes fall upon it in <lb/> print they see a
      vision of glorious colors clothed in fire.</p>
     <p>These describers are writing for the "general," and so, in <lb/> order to make sure of being
      understood, they ought to use <lb/> words in their ordinary sense, or else explain. The word <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">fountain</hi> means one thing in <hi rend="italic">Syria</hi>, where there
      is but a <reg orig="hand-|ful">handful</reg>
      <lb/> of people; it means quite another thing in North America, <lb/> where there are
      75,000,000. If I were describing some Syrian <lb/> scenery, and should exclaim, "Within the
      narrow space of a <lb/> quarter of a mile square I saw, in the glory of the flooding <lb/>
      moonlight, two hundred noble fountains&mdash;imagine the <reg orig="specta-|cle"
       >spectacle</reg>!" <lb/> the North American would have a vision of clustering <lb/> columns
      of water soaring aloft, bending over in graceful arches, <lb/> bursting in beaded spray and
      raining white fire in the <reg orig="moon-|light&mdash;and">moonlight&mdash;and</reg>
      <lb/> he would be deceived. But the Syrian would not <lb/> be deceived; he would merely see
      two hundred fresh-water <lb/> springs&mdash;two hundred drowsing puddles, as level and
       <reg orig="unpre-|tentious">unpretentious</reg>
      <lb/> and unexcited as so many door-mats, and even with <lb/> the help of the moonlight he
      would not lose his grip in the <lb/> presence of the exhibition. My word "fountain" would be
      <lb/> correct; it would speak the strict truth; and it would convey <lb/> the strict truth to
      the handful of Syrians, and the strictest <lb/> misinformation to the North American millions.
      With their <lb/> gems&mdash;and gems&mdash;and more gems&mdash;and gems
      again&mdash;and <lb/> still other gems&mdash;the describers of the Taj are within
      their <lb/> legal but not their moral rights; they are dealing in the <reg orig="strict-|est"
       >strictest</reg>
      <lb/> scientific truth; and in doing it they succeed to admiration <lb/> in telling "what
      ain't so."</p>

      elephant, affable, gentlemanly, educated, and I <lb/> was not afraid of it. I even rode it

      of the <lb/> fine view one has from up there, and partly because of the <reg orig="dig-|nity"
       >dignity</reg>
      <lb/> one feels in that high place, and partly because one can <lb/> look in at the windows
      and see what is going on privately <lb/> among the family. The Lahore horses were used to
      elephants, <lb/> but they were rapturously afraid of them just the same. It <lb/> seemed
      curious. Perhaps the better they know the elephant <lb/> the more they respect him in that
      peculiar way. In our own <lb/> case we are not afraid of dynamite till we get acquainted <lb/>
      with it.</p>
     <pb n="583" entity="DSSR_000002496_0598"/>
     <p>We drifted as far as Rawal Pindi, away up on the Afghan <lb/> frontier&mdash;I think it
      was the Afghan frontier, but it may have <lb/> been Hertzegovina&mdash;it was around
      there somewhere&mdash;and <lb/> down again to Delhi, to see the ancient architectural
      wonders <lb/> there and in Old Delhi and not describe them, and also to see <lb/> the scene of
      the illustrious assault, in the Mutiny days, when <lb/> the British carried Delhi by storm,
      one of the marvels of <reg orig="his-|tory">history</reg>
      <lb/> for impudent daring and immortal valor.</p>
     <p>We had a refreshing rest, there in Delhi, in a great old <lb/> mansion which possessed
      historical interest. It was built by <lb/> a rich Englishman who had become
      orientalized&mdash;so much <lb/> so that he had a zenana. But he was a broad-minded man,
      <lb/> and remained so. To please his harem he built a mosque; to <lb/> please himself he built
      an English church. That kind of a <lb/> man will arrive, somewhere. In the Mutiny days the
       <reg orig="man-|sion">mansion</reg>
      <lb/> was the British general's headquarters. It stands in a <lb/> great
      garden&mdash;oriental fashion&mdash;and about it are many noble <lb/> trees. The
      trees harbor monkeys; and they are monkeys of <lb/> a watchful and enterprising sort, and not
      much troubled with <lb/> fear. They invade the house whenever they get a chance, <lb/> and
      carry off everything they don't want. One morning the <lb/> master of the house was in his
      bath, and the window was <lb/> open. Near it stood a pot of yellow paint and a brush. <lb/>
      Some monkeys appeared in the window; to scare them away, <lb/> the gentleman threw his sponge
      at them. They did not scare <lb/> at all; they jumped into the room and threw yellow paint
      <lb/> all over him from the brush, and drove him out; then they <lb/> painted the walls and
      the floor and the tank and the <reg orig="win-|dows">windows</reg>
      <lb/> and the furniture yellow, and were in the dressing-room <lb/> painting that when help
      arrived and routed them.</p>
     <p>Two of these creatures came into my room in the early <lb/> morning, through a window whose
      shutters I had left open, <lb/> and when I woke one of them was before the glass brushing <lb/>
      <pb n="584" entity="DSSR_000002496_0599"/> his hair, and the other one had my note-book, and
      was reading <lb/> a page of humorous notes and crying. I did not mind the <lb/> one with the
      hair-brush, but the conduct of the other one hurt <lb/> me; it hurts me yet. I threw something
      at him, and that was <lb/> wrong, for my host had told me that the monkeys were best <lb/>
      left alone. They threw everything at me that they could lift, <lb/> and then went into the
      bathroom to get some more things, <lb/> and I shut the door on them.</p>
     <p>At Jeypore, in Rajputana, we made a considerable stay. <lb/> We were not in the native city,
      but several miles from it, in <lb/> the small European official suburb. There were but few
       <reg orig="Euro-|peans&mdash;only">Europeans&mdash;only</reg>
      <lb/> fourteen&mdash;but they were all kind and hospitable, <lb/> and it amounted to
      being at home. In Jeypore we found again <lb/> what we had found all about
      India&mdash;that while the Indian <lb/> servant is in his way a very real treasure, he
      will sometimes <lb/> bear watching, and the Englishman watches him. If he sends <lb/> him on
      an errand, he wants more than the man's word for it <lb/> that he did the errand. When fruit
      and vegetables were sent <lb/> to us, a "chit" came with them&mdash;a receipt for us to
      sign; <lb/> otherwise the things might not arrive. If a gentleman sent <lb/> up his carriage,
      the chit stated "from" such-and-such an hour <lb/> "to" such-and-such an hour&mdash;which
      made it unhandy for the <lb/> coachman and his two or three subordinates to put us off with
      <lb/> a part of the allotted time and devote the rest of it to a lark <lb/> of their own.</p>
     <p>We were pleasantly situated in a small two-storied inn, in <lb/> an empty large compound
      which was surrounded by a mud <lb/> wall as high as a man's head. The inn was kept by nine
       <reg orig="Hin-|doo">Hindoo</reg>
      <lb/> brothers, its owners. They lived, with their families, in a <lb/> one-storied building
      within the compound, but off to one side, <lb/> and there was always a long pile of their
      little comely brown <lb/> children loosely stacked in its veranda, and a detachment of <lb/>
      the parents wedged among them, smoking the hookah or the <lb/>
      <pb entity="DSSR_000002496_0600"/>

      <pb n="587" entity="DSSR_000002496_0602"/> howdah, or whatever they call it. By the veranda
      stood a <lb/> palm, and a monkey lived in it, and led a lonesome life, and <lb/> always looked
      sad and weary, and the crows bothered him a <lb/> good deal.</p>
     <p>The inn cow poked about the compound and emphasized <lb/> the secluded and country air of
      the place, and there was a dog <lb/> of no particular breed, who was always present in the
       <reg orig="com-|pound">compound</reg>, <lb/> and always asleep, always stretched out baking
      in the <lb/> sun and adding to the deep tranquility and reposefulness of the <lb/> place, when
      the crows were away on business. White-draperied <lb/> servants were coming and going all the
      time, but they seemed <lb/> only spirits, for their feet were bare and made no sound. <lb/>
      Down the lane a piece lived an elephant in the shade of a noble <lb/> tree, and rocked and
      rocked, and reached about with his trunk, <lb/> begging of his brown mistress or fumbling the
      children <reg orig="play-|ing">playing</reg>
      <lb/> at his feet. And there were camels about, but they go on <lb/> velvet feet, and were
      proper to the silence and serenity of the <lb/> surroundings.</p>
     <p>The Satan mentioned at the head of this chapter was not <lb/> our Satan, but the other one.
      Our Satan was lost to us. In <lb/> these later days he had passed out of our
      life&mdash;lamented by <lb/> me, and sincerely. I was missing him; I am missing him yet,
      <lb/> after all these months. He was an astonishing creature to fly <lb/> around and do
      things. He didn't always do them quite right, <lb/> but he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> them,
      and did them suddenly. There was no time <lb/> wasted. You would say:</p>
     <p>"Pack the trunks and bags, Satan."</p>
     <p>"Wair good" (very good).</p>
     <p>Then there would be a brief sound of thrashing and slashing <lb/> and humming and buzzing,
      and a spectacle as of a whirlwind <lb/> spinning gowns and jackets and coats and boots and
      things <lb/> through the air, and then&mdash;with bow and touch&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Awready, master."</p>
     <pb n="588" entity="DSSR_000002496_0603"/>
     <p>It was wonderful. It made one dizzy. He crumpled <lb/> dresses a good deal, and he had no
      particular plan about the <lb/> work&mdash;at first&mdash;except to put each article
      into the trunk it <lb/> didn't belong in. But he soon reformed, in this matter. Not <lb/>
      entirely; for, to the last, he would cram into the satchel <lb/> sacred to literature any odds
      and ends of rubbish that he <lb/> couldn't find a handy place for elsewhere. When threatened
      <lb/> with death for this, it did not trouble him; he only looked <lb/> pleasant, saluted with
      soldierly grace, said "Wair good," and <lb/> did it again next day.</p>
     <p>He was always busy; kept the rooms tidied up, the boots <lb/> polished, the clothes brushed,
      the wash-basin full of clean <lb/> water, my dress clothes laid out and ready for the
      lecture-hall <lb/> an hour ahead of time; and he dressed me from head to heel <lb/> in spite
      of my determination to do it myself, according to my <lb/> lifelong custom.</p>
     <p>He was a born boss, and loved to command, and to jaw and <lb/> dispute with inferiors and
      harry them and bullyrag them. He <lb/> was fine at the railway station&mdash;yes, he was
      at his finest there. <lb/> He would shoulder and plunge and paw his violent way <lb/> through
      the packed multitude of natives with nineteen coolies <lb/> at his tail, each bearing a trifle
      of luggage&mdash;one a trunk, <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg>
      <lb/> a parasol, another a shawl, another a fan, and so on; one <lb/> article to each, and the
      longer the procession, the better he was <lb/> suited&mdash;and he was sure to make for
      some engaged sleeper <lb/> and begin to hurl the owner's things out of it, swearing that it
      <lb/> was ours and that there had been a mistake. Arrived at our <lb/> own sleeper, he would
      undo the bedding-bundles and make the <lb/> beds and put everything to rights and shipshape in
      two <reg orig="min-|utes">minutes</reg>; <lb/> then put his head out at a window and have a
      restful <lb/> good time abusing his gang of coolies and disputing their bill <lb/> until we
      arrived and made him pay them and stop his noise.</p>
     <p>Speaking of noise, he certainly was the noisest little devil <lb/>
      <pb n="589" entity="DSSR_000002496_0604"/> in India&mdash;and that is saying much, very
      much, indeed. I <lb/> loved him for his noise, but the family detested him for it. <lb/> They
      could not abide it; they could not get reconciled to it. <lb/> It humiliated them. As a rule,
      when we got within six <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg>
      <lb/> yards of one of those big railway stations, a mighty <lb/> racket of screaming and
      shrieking and shouting and storming <lb/> would break upon us, and I would be happy to myself,
      and the <lb/> family would say, with shame:</p>
     <p>"There&mdash;that's Satan. Why <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you keep him?"</p>
     <p>And, sure enough, there in the whirling midst of fifteen <lb/> hundred wondering people we
      would find that little scrap of a <lb/> creature gesticulating like a spider with the colic,
      his black <lb/> eyes snapping, his fez-tassel dancing, his jaws pouring out <lb/> floods of
      billingsgate upon his gang of beseeching and <reg orig="aston-|ished">astonished</reg>
      <lb/> coolies.</p>
     <p>I loved him; I couldn't help it; but the family&mdash;why, they <lb/> could hardly
      speak of him with patience. To this day I regret <lb/> his loss, and wish I had him back; but
      they&mdash;it is different <lb/> with them. He was a native, and came from Surat. Twenty
      <lb/> degrees of latitude lay between his birthplace and Manuel's, <lb/> and fifteen hundred
      between their ways and characters and <lb/> dispositions. I only liked Manuel, but I loved
      Satan. This <lb/> latter's real name was intensely Indian. I could not quite get <lb/> the
      hang of it, but it sounded like Bunder Rao Ram Chunder <lb/> Clam Chowder. It was too long for
      handy use, anyway; so I <lb/> reduced it.</p>
     <p>When he had been with us two or three weeks, he began <lb/> to make mistakes which I had
      difficulty in patching up for <lb/> him. Approaching Benares one day, he got out of the train
      <lb/> to see if be could get up a misunderstanding with somebody, <lb/> for it had been a
      weary, long journey and he wanted to <lb/> freshen up. He found what he was after, but kept up
      his <lb/> pow-wow a shade too long and got left. So there we were in a <lb/>
      <pb n="590" entity="DSSR_000002496_0605"/> strange city and no chambermaid. It was awkward for
      us, <lb/> and we told him he must not do so any more. He saluted and <lb/> said in his dear,
      pleasant way, "Wair good." Then at <reg orig="Luck-|now">Lucknow</reg>
      <lb/> he got drunk. I said it was a fever, and got the family's <lb/> compassion and
      solicitude aroused; so they gave him a <reg orig="tea-|spoonful">teaspoonful</reg>
      <lb/> of liquid quinine and it set his vitals on fire. He <lb/> made several grimaces which
      gave me a better idea of the <lb/> Lisbon earthquake than any I have ever got of it from <reg
       orig="paint-|ings">paintings</reg>
      <lb/> and descriptions. His drunk was still portentously solid <lb/> next morning, but I could
      have pulled him through with the <lb/> family if he would only have taken another spoonful of
      that <lb/> remedy; but no, although he was stupefied, his memory still <lb/> had flickerings
      of life; so he smiled a divinely dull smile and <lb/> said, fumblingly saluting:</p>
     <p>"Scoose me, mem Saheb, scoose me, Missy Saheb; Satan <lb/> not prefer it, please."</p>
     <p>Then some instinct revealed to them that he was drunk. <lb/> They gave him prompt notice
      that next time this happened <lb/> he must go. He got out a maudlin and most gentle "Wair
      <lb/> good," and saluted indefinitely.</p>
     <p>Only one short week later he fell again. And oh, sorrow! <lb/> not in a hotel this time, but
      in an English gentleman's private <lb/> house. And in Agra, of all places. So he had to go.
      When <lb/> I told him, he said patiently, "Wair good," and made his <reg orig="part-|ing"
       >parting</reg>
      <lb/> salute, and went out from us to return no more forever. <lb/> Dear me! I would rather
      have lost a hundred angels than that <lb/> one poor lovely devil. What style he used to put
      on, in a <lb/> swell hotel or in a private house&mdash;snow-white muslin from <lb/> his
      chin to his bare feet, a crimson sash embroidered with gold <lb/> thread around his waist, and
      on his head a great sea-green <lb/> turban like to the turban of the Grand Turk.</p>
     <p>He was not a liar, but he will become one if he keeps on. <lb/> He told me once that he used
      to crack cocoanuts with his <lb/>
      <pb entity="DSSR_000002496_0606"/>

      <pb n="593" entity="DSSR_000002496_0608"/> teeth when he was a boy; and when I asked how he
      got them <lb/> into his mouth, he said he was upward of six feet high at that <lb/> time, and
      had an unusual mouth. And when I followed him <lb/> up and asked him what had become of that
      other foot, he said <lb/> a house fell on him and he was never able to get his stature <lb/>
      back again. Swervings like these from the strict line of fact <lb/> often beguile a truthful
      man on and on until he eventually <lb/> becomes a liar.</p>

     <p>His successor was a Mohammedan, Sahadat <lb/> Mohammed Khan; very dark, very tall, very
      <lb/> grave. He went always in flowing masses of <lb/> white, from the top of his big turban
      down <lb/> to his bare feet. His voice was low. He <lb/> glided about in a noiseless way, and
      looked <lb/> like a ghost. He was competent and <reg orig="satis-|factory">satisfactory</reg>.
      <lb/> But where he was, it seemed <reg orig="al-|ways">always</reg>
      <lb/> Sunday. It was not so in Satan's time.</p>
     <p>Jeypore is intensely Indian, but it has two or three features <lb/> which indicate the
      presence of European science and European <lb/> interest in the weal of the common public,
      such as the liberal <lb/> water-supply furnished by great works built at the State's <lb/>
      expense; good sanitation, resulting in a degree of <reg orig="healthful-|ness">healthfulness</reg>
      <lb/> unusually high for India; a noble pleasure garden, with <lb/> privileged days for women;
      schools for the instruction of <lb/> native youth in advanced art, both ornamental and
      utilitarian; <lb/> and a new and beautiful palace stocked with a museum of <lb/> extraordinary
      interest and value. Without the Maharaja's <lb/> sympathy and purse these beneficences could
      not have been <lb/> created; but he is a man of wide views and large generosities, <lb/> and
      all such matters find hospitality with him.</p>
     <p>We drove often to the city from the hotel Kaiser-i-Hind, a <lb/> journey which was always
      full of interest, both night and day, <lb/>
      <pb n="594" entity="DSSR_000002496_0609"/> for that country road was never quiet, never empty,
      but was <lb/> always India in motion, always a streaming flood of brown <lb/> people clothed
      in smouchings from the rainbow, a tossing and <lb/> moiling flood, happy, noisy, a charming
      and satisfying <reg orig="con-|fusion">confusion</reg>
      <lb/> of strange human and strange animal life and equally <lb/> strange and outlandish
      vehicles.</p>
     <p>And the city itself is a curiosity. Any Indian city is that, <lb/> but this one is not like
      any other that we saw. It is shut up in <lb/> a lofty turreted wall; the main body of it is
      divided into six <lb/> parts by perfectly straight streets that are more than a <reg
       orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg>
      <lb/> feet wide; the blocks of houses exhibit a long frontage of <lb/> the most taking
      architectural quaintnesses, the straight lines <lb/> being broken everywhere by pretty little
      balconies, pillared <lb/> and highly ornamented, and other cunning and cozy and <reg
       orig="in-|viting">inviting</reg>
      <lb/> perches and projections, and many of the fronts are <lb/> curiously pictured by the
      brush, and the whole of them have <lb/> the soft rich tint of strawberry ice-cream. One cannot
      look <lb/> down the far stretch of the chief street and persuade himself <lb/> that these are
      real houses, and that it is all out of doors&mdash;the <lb/> impression that it is an
      unreality, a picture, a scene in a <reg orig="thea-|ter">theater</reg>, <lb/> is the only one
      that will take hold.</p>
     <p>Then there came a great day when this illusion was more <lb/> pronounced than ever. A rich
      Hindoo had been spending a <lb/> fortune upon the manufacture of a crowd of idols and <reg
       orig="accom-|panying">accompanying</reg>
      <lb/> paraphernalia whose purpose was to illustrate scenes <lb/> in the life of his especial
      god or saint, and this fine show was <lb/> to be brought through the town in processional
      state at ten <lb/> in the morning. As we passed through the great public <lb/> pleasure garden
      on our way to the city we found it crowded <lb/> with natives. That was one sight. Then there
      was another. <lb/> In the midst of the spacious lawns stands the palace which <lb/> contains
      the museum&mdash;a beautiful construction of stone which <lb/> shows arched colonnades,
      one above another, and receding, <lb/>
      <pb entity="DSSR_000002496_0610"/>

      terraces, <lb/> all the way to the top one, was packed and jammed with <lb/> natives. One must
      try to imagine those solid masses of <reg orig="splen-|did">splendid</reg>
      <lb/> color, one above another, up and up, against the blue sky, <lb/> and the Indian sun
      turning them all to beds of fire and flame.</p>
     <p>Later, when we reached the city, and glanced down the <lb/> chief avenue, smouldering in its
      crushed-strawberry tint, those <lb/> splendid effects were repeated; for every balcony, and
      every <lb/> fanciful bird-cage of a snuggery countersunk in the <reg orig="house-|fronts"
       >house-fronts</reg>, <lb/> and all the long lines of roofs were crowded with <lb/> people,
      and each crowd was an explosion of brilliant color.</p>
     <p>Then the wide street itself, away down and down and down <lb/> into the distance, was alive
      with gorgeously-clothed people&mdash; <lb/> not still, but moving, swaying, drifting,
      eddying, a delirious <reg orig="dis-|play">display</reg>
      <lb/> of all colors and all shades of color, delicate, lovely, pale, <lb/> soft, strong,

      <lb/> blossoms passing on the wings of a hurricane; and presently, <lb/> through this storm of
      color, came swaying and swinging the <lb/> majestic elephants, clothed in their Sunday best of
      gaudinesses, <lb/> and the long procession of fanciful trucks freighted with their <lb/>
      groups of curious and costly images, and then the long <reg orig="rear-|guard">rearguard</reg>
      <lb/> of stately camels, with their picturesque riders.</p>
     <p>For color, and picturesqueness, and novelty, and <reg orig="outlandish-|ness"

      satisfying show I had ever seen, and I suppose I shall not have <lb/> the privilege of looking

      eclipse; when it can read words of two syllables, they require <lb/> it to explain the
      circulation of the blood; when it reaches the <lb/> head of the infant class they bully it
      with conundrums that <lb/> cover the domain of universal knowledge. This sounds <reg
       orig="ex-|travagant&mdash;and">extravagant&mdash;and</reg>
      <lb/> is; yet it goes no great way beyond the <lb/> facts.</p>
     <p>I received a curious letter one day, from the Punjab (you <lb/> must pronounce it
       Pun<hi rend="italic">jawb</hi>). The handwriting was excellent, <lb/> and the
      wording was English&mdash;English, and yet not exactly <lb/> English. The style was easy
      and smooth and flowing, yet <lb/>
      <pb n="598" entity="DSSR_000002496_0613"/> there was something subtly foreign about
      it&mdash;something <reg orig="tropi-|cally">tropically</reg>
      <lb/> ornate and sentimental and rhetorical. It turned out to <lb/> be the work of a Hindoo
      youth, the holder of a humble clerical <lb/> billet in a railway office. He had been educated
      in one of the <lb/> numerous colleges of India. Upon inquiry I was told that the <lb/> country
      was full of young fellows of his like. They had been <lb/> educated away up to the
      snow-summits of learning&mdash;and the <lb/> market for all this elaborate cultivation
      was minutely out of <lb/> proportion to the vastness of the product. This market <reg
       orig="con-|sisted">consisted</reg>
      <lb/> of some thousands of small clerical posts under the <lb/> government&mdash;the
      supply of material for it was multitudinous. <lb/> If this youth with the flowing style and
      the blossoming <reg orig="Eng-|lish">English</reg>
      <lb/> was occupying a small railway clerkship, it meant that <lb/> there were hundreds and
      hundreds as capable as he, or he <lb/> would be in a high place; and it certainly meant that
      there <lb/> were thousands whose education and capacity had fallen a <lb/> little short, and
      that they would have to go <hi rend="italic">without</hi> places. <lb/> Apparently, then, the
      colleges of India were doing what our <lb/> high schools have long been
      doing&mdash;richly over-supplying the <lb/> market for highly-educated service; and
      thereby doing a <reg orig="dam-|age">damage</reg>
      <lb/> to the scholar, and through him to the country.</p>
     <p>At home I once made a speech deploring the injuries <reg orig="in-|flicted">inflicted</reg>
      <lb/> by the high school in making handicrafts distasteful to <lb/> boys who would have been
      willing to make a living at trades <lb/> and agriculture if they had but had the good luck to
      stop with <lb/> the common school. But I made no converts. Not one, in a <lb/> community
      overrun with educated idlers who were above <reg orig="fol-|lowing">following</reg>
      <lb/> their fathers' mechanical trades, yet could find no <lb/> market for their
      book-knowledge. The same mail that brought <lb/> me the letter from the Punjab, brought also a
      little book <reg orig="pub-|lished">published</reg>
      <lb/> by Messrs. Thacker, Spink &amp; Co., of Calcutta, which <lb/> interested me, for
      both its preface and its contents treated of <lb/> this matter of over-education. In the
      preface occurs this <reg orig="para-|graph">paragraph</reg>
      <lb/>
      <pb n="599" entity="DSSR_000002496_0614"/> from the <hi rend="italic">Calcutta Review</hi>.
      For "Government office" <lb/> read "dry-goods clerkship" and it will fit more than one <lb/>
      region of America: <lb/>
      <q>"The education that we give makes the boys a little less clownish in their <lb/> manners,
       and more intelligent when spoken to by strangers. On the other <lb/> hand, it has made them
       less contented with their lot in life, and less willing to <lb/> work with their hands. The
       form which discontent takes in this country is <lb/> not of a healthy kind; for, the Natives
       of India consider that the only <reg orig="occupa-|tion">occupation</reg>
       <lb/> worthy of an educated man is that of a writership in some office, and <reg
        orig="es-|pecially">especially</reg>
       <lb/> in a Government office. The village schoolboy goes back to the <lb/> plow with the
       greatest reluctance; and the town schoolboy carries the same <lb/> discontent and
       inefficiency into his father's workshop. Sometimes these <lb/> ex-students positively refuse
       at first to work; and more than once parents <lb/> have openly expressed their regret that
       they ever allowed their sons to be <lb/> inveigled to school."</q></p>
     <p>The little book which I am quoting from is called "<reg orig="Indo-|Anglian">Indo-Anglian</reg>
      <lb/> Literature," and is well stocked with "baboo" <reg orig="Eng-|lish&mdash;clerkly"
       >English&mdash;clerkly</reg>
      <lb/> English, booky English, acquired in the schools. <lb/> Some of it is very
      funny,&mdash;almost as funny, perhaps, as what <lb/> you and I produce when we try to
      write in a language not our <lb/> own; but much of it is surprisingly correct and free. If I
      were <lb/> going to quote <hi rend="italic">good</hi> English&mdash;but I am not. India
      is well <lb/> stocked with natives who speak it and write it as well as the <lb/> best of us.
      I merely wish to show some of the quaint <reg orig="imper-|fect">imperfect</reg>
      <lb/> attempts at the use of our tongue. There are many letters <lb/> in the book; poverty
      imploring help&mdash;bread, money, kindness, <lb/> office&mdash;generally an office,
      a clerkship, some way to get food <lb/> and a rag out of the applicant's unmarketable
      education; and <lb/> food not for himself alone, but sometimes for a dozen helpless <lb/>
      relations in addition to his own family; for those people are <lb/> astonishingly unselfish,
      and admirably faithful to their ties of <lb/> kinship. Among us I think there is nothing
      approaching it. <lb/> Strange as some of these wailing and supplicating letters are, <lb/>
      humble and even groveling as some of them are, and quaintly <lb/> funny and confused as a
      goodly number of them are, there is <lb/> still a pathos about them, as a rule, that checks
      the rising laugh <lb/>
      <pb n="600" entity="DSSR_000002496_0615"/> and reproaches it. In the following letter "father"
      is not to <lb/> be read literally. In Ceylon a little native beggar-girl <reg
       orig="embar-|rassed">embarrassed</reg>
      <lb/> me by calling me father, although I knew she was <reg orig="mis-|taken">mistaken</reg>.
      <lb/> I was so new that I did not know that she was merely <lb/> following the custom of the
      dependent and the supplicant.</p>

     <p>It is all school-English, book-English, you see; and good <lb/> enough, too, all things
      considered. If the native boy had but <lb/> that one study he would shine, he would dazzle, no
      doubt. <lb/> But that is not the case. He is situated as are our <reg orig="public-|school"
       >public-school</reg>
      <lb/> children&mdash;loaded down with an over-freightage of <lb/> other studies; and
      frequently they are as far beyond the actual <lb/> point of progress reached by him and suited
      to the stage of <lb/> development attained, as could be imagined by the insanest <lb/> fancy.
      Apparently&mdash;like our public-school boy&mdash;he must <lb/> work, work, work, in
      school and out, and play but little. <lb/> Apparently&mdash;like our public-school
      boy&mdash;his "education" <lb/> consists in learning <hi rend="italic">things</hi>, not
      the meaning of them; he is fed <lb/> upon the husks, not the corn. From several essays written
      by <lb/> native schoolboys in answer to the question of how they spend <lb/> their day, I
      select one&mdash;the one which goes most into detail: <lb/>
      <q>"66. At the break of day I rises from my own bed and finish my daily <lb/> duty, then I
       employ myself till 8 o'clock, after which I employ myself to <lb/> bathe, then take for my
       body some sweet meat, and just at 9&frac12; I came to <lb/> school to attend my class
       duty, then at 2&frac12; P. M. I return from school and <lb/> engage myself to do my
       natural duty, then, I engage for a quarter to take my <lb/> tiffin, then I study till 5 P.
       M., after which I began to play anything which <lb/> comes on my head. After 8&frac12;
       half pass to eight we are began to sleep, before <lb/> sleeping I told a constable just 11 o'
       he came and rose us from half pass <lb/> eleven we began to read still morning."</q></p>
     <p>It is not perfectly clear, now that I come to cipher upon it. <lb/> He gets up at about 5 in
      the morning, or along there <reg orig="some-|where">somewhere</reg>, <lb/> and goes to bed
      about fifteen or sixteen hours <reg orig="after-|ward&mdash;that"
       >afterward&mdash;that</reg>
      <lb/> much of it seems straight; but why he should rise <lb/> again three hours later and
      resume his studies till morning is <lb/> puzzling.</p>
     <p>I think it is because he is studying history. History <lb/> requires a world of time and
      bitter hard work when your <lb/> "education" is no further advanced than the cat's; when you
      <lb/> are merely stuffing yourself with a mixed-up mess of empty <lb/> names and random
      incidents and elusive dates, which no one <lb/>
      <pb n="604" entity="DSSR_000002496_0619"/> teaches you how to interpret, and which,
      uninterpreted, pay <lb/> you not a farthing's value for your waste of time. Yes, I <lb/> think
      he had to get up at half-past 11 p. m. in order to be sure <lb/> to be perfect with his
      history lesson by noon. With results as <lb/> follows&mdash;from a Calcutta school
      examination:</p>
     <q>"Q. <hi rend="italic">Who was Cardinal Wolsey?</hi></q>
     <q>"Cardinal Wolsey was an Editor of a paper named <hi rend="italic">North Briton</hi>. No. 45
      <lb/> of his publication he charged the King of uttering a lie from the throne. He <lb/> was
      arrested and cast into prison; and after releasing went to France.</q>
     <q>"3. As Bishop of York but died in disentry in a church on his way to <lb/> be blockheaded.</q>
     <q>"8. Cardinal Wolsey was the son of Edward IV, after his father's <lb/> death he himself
      ascended the throne at the age of (10) ten only, but when he <lb/> surpassed
      or when he was fallen in his twenty years of age at that time he <lb/> wished to make a
      journey in his countries under him, but he was opposed by <lb/> his mother to do journey, and
      according to his mother's example he remained <lb/> in the home, and then became King. After
      many times obstacles and many <lb/> confusion he become King and afterwards his brother."</q>
     <p>There is probably not a word of truth in that.</p>
     <q>"Q. <hi rend="italic">What is the meaning of Ich Dien?</hi></q>
     <q>"10. An honor conferred on the first or eldest sons of English Sovereigns. <lb/> It is
      nothing more than some feathers.</q>
     <q>"11. Ich Dien was the word which was written on the feathers of the <lb/> blind King who
      came to fight, being interlaced with the bridles of the horse.</q>
     <q>"13. Ich Dien is a title given to Henry VII by the Pope of Rome, when <lb/> he forwarded the
      Reformation of Cardinal Wolsy to Rome, and for this <lb/> reason he was called Commander of
      the faith."</q>
     <p>A dozen or so of this kind of insane answers are quoted in <lb/> the book from that
      examination. Each answer is sweeping <lb/> proof, all by itself, that the person uttering it
      was pushed <lb/> ahead of where he belonged when he was put into history; <lb/> proof that he
      had been put to the task of acquiring history <lb/> before he had a single lesson in the <hi
       rend="italic">art</hi> of acquiring it, <lb/> which is the equivalent of dumping a pupil into
      geometry <lb/> before he has learned the progressive steps which lead up to it <lb/> and make
      its acquirement possible. Those Calcutta novices <lb/> had no business with history. There was
      no excuse for <reg orig="exam-|ing">examing</reg>
      <lb/> them in it, no excuse for exposing them and their teachers. <lb/> They were totally
      empty; there was nothing to "examine."</p>

     <p>The students were examined in the following bulky <reg orig="mat-|ters">matters</reg>: <lb/>
      Geometry, the Solar Spectrum, the Habeas Corpus Act, <lb/> the British Parliament, and in

      It <lb/> is within bounds to say that some of the results were <reg orig="astonish-|ing"
       >astonishing</reg>. <lb/> Without doubt, there were students present who <reg
       orig="justi-|fied">justified</reg>
      <lb/> their teacher's wisdom in introducing them to these <reg orig="stud-|ies">studies</reg>;
      <lb/> but the fact is also evident that others had been pushed <lb/>
      <pb n="606" entity="DSSR_000002496_0621"/> into these studies to waste their time over them
      when they <lb/> could have been profitably employed in hunting smaller game. <lb/> Under the

     <list>
      <item>"49. The whole BD=the whole CA, and so-so-so-so-so-so&mdash;so.</item>
     </list>
     <p>To me this is cloudy, but I was never well up in geometry. <lb/> That was the only effort
      made among the five students who <lb/> appeared for examination in geometry; the other four
      wailed <lb/> and surrendered without a fight. They are piteous wails, too, <lb/> wails of
      despair; and one of them is an eloquent reproach; it <lb/> comes from a poor fellow who has
      been laden beyond his <lb/> strength by a stupid teacher, and is eloquent in spite of the
      <lb/> poverty of its English. The poor chap finds himself required <lb/> to explain riddles
      which even Sir Isaac Newton was not able <lb/> to understand:</p>

     </argument>
     <p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> sailed from Calcutta toward the end of March; <lb/> stopped a
      day at Madras; two or three days in <lb/> Ceylon; then sailed westward on a long flight for
      <lb/> Mauritius. From my diary:</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">April 7</hi>. We are far abroad upon the smooth waters of <lb/> the Indian
      Ocean, now; it is shady and pleasant and peaceful <lb/> under the vast spread of the awnings,
      and life is perfect again <lb/> &mdash;ideal.</p>
     <p>The difference between a river and the sea is, that the river <lb/> looks fluid, the sea
      solid&mdash;usually looks as if you could step <lb/> out and walk on it.</p>
     <p>The captain has this peculiarity&mdash;he cannot tell the truth <lb/> in a plausible
      way. In this he is the very opposite of the <lb/> austere Scot who sits midway of the table;
       <hi rend="italic">he</hi> cannot tell a lie <lb/> in an <hi rend="italic">un</hi>plausible
      way. When the captain finishes a statement <lb/> the passengers glance at each other
      privately, as who should <lb/> say, "Do you believe that?" When the Scot finishes one, the
      <lb/> look says, "How strange and interesting." The whole secret <lb/> is in the manner and
      method of the two men. The captain is <lb/> a little shy and diffident, and he states the
      simplest fact as if he <lb/> were a little afraid of it, while the Scot delivers himself of
      the <lb/> most abandoned lie with such an air of stern veracity that one <lb/> is forced to
      believe it although one knows it isn't so. For <reg orig="in-|stance">instance</reg>, <lb/>
      the Scot told about a pet flying-fish he once owned, that <lb/> lived in a little fountain in
      his conservatory, and supported <lb/>
      <pb n="610" entity="DSSR_000002496_0625"/> itself by catching birds and frogs and rats in the
      neighboring <lb/> fields. It was plain that no one at the table doubted this <lb/> statement.</p>
     <p>By and by, in the course of some talk about custom-house <lb/> annoyances, the captain
      brought out the following simple <reg orig="every-|day">every-day</reg>
      <lb/> incident, but through his infirmity of style managed to <lb/> tell it in such a way that
      it got no credence. He said: <lb/>
      <q>"I went ashore at Naples one voyage when I <lb/> was in that trade, and stood around
       helping my <lb/> passengers, for I could speak a little Italian. Two <lb/> or three times, at
       intervals, the officer asked me if I <lb/> had anything dutiable about me, and seemed more
       <lb/> and more put out and disappointed every time I <lb/> told him no. Finally a passenger
       whom I had <lb/> helped through asked me to come out and take <lb/> something. I thanked him,
       but excused myself, <lb/> saying I had taken a whisky just before I came <lb/> ashore.</q>
      <q>"It was a fatal admission. The officer at once <lb/> made me pay sixpence import-duty on
       the whisky&mdash; <lb/> just from ship to shore, you see; and he fined me <lb/>
       &pound;5 for not declaring the goods, another &pound;5 for falsely <lb/> denying
       that I had anything dutiable about me, <lb/> also &pound;5 for concealing the goods, and
       &pound;50 for <reg orig="smug-|gling">smuggling</reg>, <lb/> which is the maximum
       penalty for unlawfully <lb/> bringing in goods under the value of sevenpence <lb/> ha'penny.
       Altogether, sixty-five pounds sixpence <lb/> for a little thing like that."</q></p>

      <p>A FEMALE UNCLE.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>The Scot is always believed, yet he <lb/> never tells anything but lies; whereas the <lb/>
      captain is never believed, although he never <lb/> tells a lie, so far as I can judge. If he
      should say his uncle <lb/> was a male person, he would probably say it in such a way <lb/>
      that nobody would believe it; at the same time the Scot could <lb/> claim that he had a female
      uncle and not stir a doubt in <reg orig="any-|body's">anybody's</reg>
      <lb/> mind. My own luck has been curious all my literary <lb/> life; I never could tell a lie
      that anybody would doubt, nor a <lb/> truth that anybody would believe.</p>
     <p>Lots of pets on board&mdash;birds and things. In these far <lb/>
      <pb n="611" entity="DSSR_000002496_0626"/> countries the white people do seem to run
      remarkably to <lb/> pets. Our host in Cawnpore had a fine collection of birds&mdash;
      <lb/> the finest we saw in a private house in India. And in Colombo, <lb/> Dr. Murray's great
      compound and commodious bungalow were <lb/> well populated with <reg orig="domesti-|cated"

      <lb/> company from the <lb/> woods: frisky little squirrels; <lb/> a Ceylon mina walking <reg

      and some <lb/> more out in the trees; also a <lb/> number of beautiful macaws <lb/> in the
      trees; and various and <lb/> sundry birds and animals of <lb/> breeds not known to me. But

     <p><hi rend="italic">April 9</hi>. Tea-planting is <lb/> the great business in Ceylon, <lb/>
      now. A passenger says it <lb/> often pays 40 per cent. on <lb/> the investment. Says there is

     <p><hi rend="italic">April 10</hi>. The sea is a Mediterranean blue; and I believe <lb/> that
      that is about the divinest color known to nature.</p>
     <p>It is strange and fine&mdash;Nature's lavish generosities to her <lb/> creatures. At
      least to all of them except man. For those <lb/> that fly she has provided a home that is
      nobly spacious&mdash;a <lb/> home which is forty miles deep and envelops the whole globe, <lb/>
      <pb n="612" entity="DSSR_000002496_0627"/> and has not an obstruction in it. For those that
      swim she has <lb/> provided a more than imperial domain&mdash;a domain which is <lb/>
      miles deep and covers four-fifths of the globe. But as for <lb/> man, she has cut him off with
      the mere odds and ends of the <lb/> creation. She has given him the thin skin, the meagre skin
      <lb/> which is stretched over the remaining one-fifth&mdash;the naked <lb/> bones stick
      up through it in most places. On the one-half of <lb/> this domain he can raise snow, ice,
      sand, rocks, and nothing <lb/> else. So the valuable part of his inheritance really consists
      of <lb/> but a single fifth of the family estate; and out of it he has to <lb/> grub hard to
      get enough to keep him alive and provide kings <lb/> and soldiers and powder to extend the
      blessings of civilization <lb/> with. Yet man, in his simplicity and complacency and <reg
       orig="in-|ability">inability</reg>
      <lb/> to cipher, thinks Nature regards him as the important <lb/> member of the
      family&mdash;in fact, her favorite. Surely, it must <lb/> occur to even his dull head,
      sometimes, that she has a curious <lb/> way of showing it.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">Afternoon</hi>. The captain has been telling how, in one of <lb/> his
      Arctic voyages, it was so cold that the mate's shadow froze <lb/> fast to the deck and had to
      be ripped loose by main strength. <lb/> And even then he got only about two-thirds of it back.
       <reg orig="No-|body">Nobody</reg>
      <lb/> said anything, and the captain went away. I think he is <lb/> becoming disheartened. . .
      . Also, to be fair, there is <lb/> another word of praise due to this ship's library: it
      contains <lb/> no copy of the Vicar of Wakefield, that strange menagerie of <lb/> complacent
      hypocrites and idiots, of theatrical cheap-john <lb/> heroes and heroines, who are always
      showing off, of bad <reg orig="peo-|ple">people</reg>
      <lb/> who are not interesting, and good people who are fatiguing. <lb/> A singular book. Not a
      sincere line in it, and not a character <lb/> that invites respect; a book which is one long
      waste-pipe <reg orig="dis-|charge">discharge</reg>
      <lb/> of goody-goody puerilities and dreary moralities; a <lb/> book which is full of pathos
      which revolts, and humor which <lb/> grieves the heart. There are few things in literature
      that are <lb/>

      "humorous" <lb/> incident of Moses and the spectacles.</p>
     <p>Jane Austen's books, too, are absent from this library. Just <lb/> that one omission alone

      kitten <lb/> now appear and get about their toilets; next the barber comes <lb/> and flays us
      on the breezy deck. Breakfast at 9.30, and the <lb/> day begins. I do not know how a day could
      be more <reg orig="repose-|ful">reposeful</reg>: <lb/> no motion; a level blue sea; nothing in

      you&mdash;the world is <lb/> far, far away; it has ceased to exist for
      you&mdash;seemed a fading <lb/> dream, along in the first days; has dissolved to an
      unreality <lb/> now; it is gone from your mind with all its businesses and <lb/> ambitions,
      its prosperities and disasters, its exultations and <lb/> despairs, its joys and griefs and
      cares and worries. They are <lb/> no concern of your any more; they have gone out of your
      <lb/> life; they are a storm which has passed and left a deep calm <lb/> behind. The people
      group themselves about the decks in their <lb/> snowy white linen, and read, smoke, sew, play
      cards, talk, nap, <lb/> and so on. In other ships the passengers are always ciphering <lb/>
      about when they are going to arrive; out in these seas it is <lb/> rare, very rare, to hear
      that subject broached. In other ships <lb/> there is always an eager rush to the bulletin
      board at noon to <lb/> find out what the "run" has been; in these seas the bulletin <lb/>
      seems to attract no interest; I have seen no one visit it; in <lb/> thirteen days I have
      visited it only once. Then I happened to <lb/> notice the figures of the day's run. On that
      day there <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg>
      <lb/> to be talk, at dinner, about the speed of modern ships. <lb/> I was the only passenger
      present who knew this ship's gait. <lb/> Necessarily, the Atlantic custom of betting on the
      ship's run is <lb/> not a custom here&mdash;nobody ever mentions it.</p>
     <p>I myself am wholly indifferent as to when we are going to <lb/> "get in"; if any one else
      feels interested in the matter he has <lb/> not indicated it in my hearing. If I had my way we

      <lb/>
      <pb n="617" entity="DSSR_000002496_0632"/> charm. There is no weariness, no fatigue, no worry,
      <lb/> no responsibility, no work, no depression of spirits. There is <lb/> nothing like this
      serenity, this comfort, this peace, this deep <lb/> contentment, to be found anywhere on land.
      If I had my way <lb/> I would sail on for ever and never go to live on the solid <lb/> ground

       <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg>
      <lb/> and the English, a very troublesome person and a serious incumbrance <lb/> at

      <lb/> first experiment was not merely a failure, it was more than a failure. He <lb/> proved
      to be more of a disease himself than any he was sent to encounter. <lb/> The next experiment
      was here. The dark scheme failed again. It was an <lb/> off-season and there was nothing but
      measles here at the time. Pope <reg orig="Hen-|nessey's">Hennessey's</reg>
      <lb/> health was not affected. He worked with the French and for the <lb/> French and against

      have the joy of seeing the flag he served <lb/> publicly hissed. His memory is held in

      countries&mdash;Jud&aelig;a, France, and Mauritius; so they <lb/> are very proud of
      belonging to one of the three grand divisions of the globe. <lb/> They think that Russia and
      Germany are in England, and that England does <lb/> not amount to much. They have heard
      vaguely about the United States and <lb/> the equator, but they think both of them are
      monarchies. They think Mount <lb/> Peter Botte is the highest mountain in the world, and if
      you show one of <lb/> them a picture of Milan Cathedral he will swell up with satisfaction and

      the high ground three and six months longer&mdash;and there is always a <lb/> chance that
      the annual cyclone will rip the profit out of the crop. In recent <lb/> times a cyclone took
      the whole crop, as you may say; and the island never <lb/> saw a finer one. Some of the

      French civilization would be an improvement upon the <reg orig="civiliza-|tion">civilization</reg>
      <lb/> of New Guinea and the like, the snatching of Madagascar <lb/> and the laying on of
      French civilization there will be fully <lb/> justified. But why did the English allow the
      French to have <lb/> Madagascar? Did she respect a theft of a couple of centuries <lb/> ago?
      Dear me, robbery by European nations of each other's <lb/> territories has never been a sin,
      is not a sin to-day. To the <reg orig="sev-|eral">several</reg>
      <lb/> cabinets the several political establishments of the world <lb/> are clothes-lines; and
      a large part of the official duty of these <lb/> cabinets is to keep an eye on each other's
      wash and grab what <lb/> they can of it as opportunity offers. All the territorial <reg
       orig="pos-|sessions">possessions</reg>
      <lb/> of all the political establishments in the earth&mdash; <lb/> including America, of
      course&mdash;consist of pilferings from <lb/> other people's wash. No tribe, howsoever
      insignificant, and no <lb/> nation, howsoever mighty, occupies a foot of land that was <lb/>
      not stolen. When the English, the French, and the Spaniards <lb/> reached America, the Indian
      tribes had been raiding each <lb/> other's territorial clothes-lines for ages, and every acre
      of <lb/> ground in the continent had been stolen and re-stolen 500 <lb/> times. The English,
      the French, and the Spaniards went to <lb/> work and stole it all over again; and when that
      was <reg orig="satisfac-|torily">satisfactorily</reg>

      <pb n="624" entity="DSSR_000002496_0639"/> of ground has been stolen several millions of
      times. A crime <lb/> persevered in a thousand centuries ceases to be a crime, and <lb/>
      becomes a virtue. This is the law of custom, and custom <reg orig="super-|sedes">supersedes</reg>
      <lb/> all other forms of law. Christian governments are as <lb/> frank to-day, as open and
      above-board, in discussing projects <lb/> for raiding each other's clothes-lines as ever they
      were before <lb/> the Golden Rule came smiling into this inhospitable world and <lb/> couldn't
      get a night's lodging anywhere. In 150 years England <lb/> has beneficently retired garment
      after garment from the Indian <lb/> lines, until there is hardly a rag of the original wash
      left <lb/> dangling anywhere. In 800 years an obscure tribe of <reg orig="Musco-|vite"

       >Land-Robber-in-Chief</reg>; <lb/> she found a quarter of the world hanging out to dry <lb/>
      on a hundred parallels of latitude, and she scooped in the whole <lb/> wash. She keeps a sharp
      eye on a multitude of little lines that <lb/> stretch along the northern boundaries of India,
      and every now <lb/> and then she snatches a hip-rag or a pair of pyjamas. It is <lb/>
      England's prospective property, and Russia knows it; but <lb/> Russia cares nothing for that.
      In fact, in our day land-<reg orig="rob-|bery">robbery</reg>, <lb/> claim-jumping, is become a
      European governmental <lb/> frenzy. Some have been hard at it in the borders of China, in
      <lb/> Burma, in Siam, and the islands of the sea; and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> have been
      <lb/> at it in Africa. Africa has been as coolly divided up and <reg orig="por-|tioned"

      <lb/> out among the gang as if they had bought it and paid <lb/> for it. And now straightway
      they are beginning the old game <lb/> again&mdash;to steal each other's grabbings.
      Germany found a vast <lb/> slice of Central Africa with the English flag and the English <lb/>
      missionary and the English trader scattered all over it, but <lb/> with certain formalities
      neglected&mdash;no signs up, "Keep off the <lb/> grass," "Trespassers forbidden,"
      etc.&mdash;and she stepped in with <lb/> a cold calm smile and put up the signs herself,
      and swept those <lb/> English pioneers promptly out of the country.</p>
     <p>There is a tremendous point there. It can be put into the <lb/>
      <pb n="625" entity="DSSR_000002496_0640"/> form of a maxim: Get your formalities
      right&mdash;never mind <lb/> about the moralities.</p>
     <p>It was an impudent thing; but England had to put up with <lb/> it. Now, in the case of
      Madagascar, the formalities had <reg orig="origin-|ally">originally</reg>
      <lb/> been observed, but by neglect they had fallen into desuetude <lb/> ages ago. England
      should have snatched Madagascar from <lb/> the French clothes-line. Without an effort she
      could have <lb/> saved those harmless natives from the calamity of French <lb/> civilization,
      and she did not do it. Now it is too late.</p>

      emotions as <lb/> parks and gardens affect them. The surfaces of one's spiritual <lb/> deeps
      are pleasantly played upon, the deeps themselves are not <lb/> reached, not stirred.
      Spaciousness, remote altitudes, the sense <lb/> of mystery which haunts apparently

      the volcano spout its lava-floods out of its summit <lb/> instead of its sides; but aside from
      these non-essentials I have <lb/> no corrections to suggest. I hope these will be attended to;

     <p>Last night, the burly chief engineer, middle-aged, was <lb/> standing telling a spirited
      seafaring tale, and had reached the <lb/> most exciting place, where a man overboard was
      washing <lb/> swiftly astern on the great seas, and uplifting despairing cries, <lb/>
      everybody racing aft in a frenzy of excitement and fading <lb/> hope, when the band, which had
      been silent a moment, began <lb/> impressively its closing piece, the English national anthem.
      <lb/> As simply as if he was unconscious of what he was doing, he <lb/> stopped his story,
      uncovered, laid his laced cap against his <lb/> breast, and slightly bent his grizzled head.
      The few bars <reg orig="fin-|ished">finished</reg>, <lb/> he put on his cap and took up his
      tale again as naturally <lb/> as if that interjection of music had been a part of it. There
      <lb/> was something touching and fine about it, and it was moving <lb/> to reflect that he was
      one of a myriad, scattered over every <lb/> part of the globe, who by turn was doing as he was
      doing <lb/> every hour of the twenty-four&mdash;those awake doing it while <lb/> the
      others slept&mdash;those impressive bars forever floating up <lb/> out of the various
      climes, never silent and never lacking <reg orig="rever-|ent">reverent</reg>

      sat by <lb/> those far hearthstones, and saw faces and heard voices other <lb/> than those
      that were about them. And so this disposition to <lb/> drag in an old indecent anecdote got no
      welcome; nobody <lb/> answered. The poor man hadn't wit enough to see that he <lb/> had
      blundered, but asked his question again. Again there <lb/> was no response. It was
      embarrassing for him. In his <reg orig="con-|fusion">confusion</reg>
      <lb/> he chose the wrong course, did the wrong thing&mdash; <lb/> began the anecdote.
      Began it in a deep and hostile stillness, <lb/> where had been such life and stir and warm
      comradeship <lb/> before. He delivered himself of the brief details of the diary's <lb/> first
      day, and did it with some confidence and a fair degree of <lb/> eagerness. It fell flat. There
      was an awkward pause. The <lb/> two rows of men sat like statues. There was no movement, <lb/>
      no sound. He <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to go on; there was no other way, at least <lb/> none
      that an animal of his calibre could think of. At the <lb/> close of each day's diary the same
      dismal silence followed. <lb/> When at last he finished his tale and sprung the indelicate
      <lb/> surprise which is wont to fetch a crash of laughter, not a <lb/> ripple of sound
      resulted. It was as if the tale had been told <lb/> to dead men. After what seemed a long,
      long time, somebody <lb/> sighed, somebody else stirred in his seat; presently, the men <lb/>
      dropped into a low murmur of confidential talk, each with his <lb/> neighbor, and the incident
      was closed. There were <reg orig="indica-|tions">indications</reg>
      <lb/> that that man was fond of his anecdote; that it was his <lb/> pet, his standby, his shot
      that never missed, his <reg orig="reputation-|maker">reputation-maker</reg>. <lb/> But he will
      never tell it again. No doubt he will <lb/> think of it sometimes, for that cannot well be

      double rank of dead men; the vacant deck stretching away in <lb/> dimming perspective beyond
      them, the wide desert of smooth <lb/> sea all abroad; the rim of the moon spying from behind a
      rag <lb/> of black cloud; the remote top of the mizzenmast shearing a <lb/>
      <pb n="636" entity="DSSR_000002496_0651"/> zigzag path through the fields of stars in the
      deeps of space; <lb/> and this soft picture will remind him of the time that he sat in <lb/>

     <p>The Second Class Passenger came over as usual at "lights <lb/> out" (11)
      and we lounged along the spacious vague solitudes <lb/> of the deck and smoked the peaceful
      pipe and talked. He told <lb/> me an incident in Mr. Barnum's life which was evidently <reg
       orig="char-|acteristic">characteristic</reg>
      <lb/> of that great showman in several ways:</p>
     <p>This was Barnum's purchase of Shakespeare's birthplace, a <lb/> quarter of a century ago.
      The Second Class Passenger was in <lb/> Jamrach's employ at the time and knew Barnum well. He
      <lb/> said the thing began in this way. One morning Barnum and <lb/> Jamrach were in Jamrach's
      little private snuggery back of the <lb/> wilderness of caged monkeys and snakes and other
       <reg orig="common-|places">commonplaces</reg>
      <lb/> of Jamrach's stock in trade, refreshing themselves after <lb/> an arduous stroke of
      business, Jamrach with something <reg orig="ortho-|dox">orthodox</reg>, <lb/> Barnum with
      something heterodox&mdash;for Barnum was a <lb/> teetotaler. The stroke of business was
      in the elephant line. <lb/> Jamrach had contracted to deliver to Barnum in New York 18 <lb/>
      elephants for $360,000 in time for the next season's opening. <lb/> Then it occurred to Mr.
      Barnum that he needed a "card." He <lb/> suggested Jumbo. Jamrach said he would have to think
      of <lb/> something else&mdash;Jumbo couldn't be had; the Zoo wouldn't <lb/> part with
      that elephant. Barnum said he was willing to pay <lb/> a fortune for Jumbo if he could get
      him. Jamrach said it was <lb/> no use to think about it; that Jumbo was as popular as the
      <lb/> Prince of Wales and the Zoo wouldn't dare to sell him; all <lb/> England would be
      outraged at the idea; Jumbo was an English <lb/> institution; he was part of the national
      glory; one might as <lb/> well think of buying the Nelson monument. Barnum spoke <lb/> up with
      vivacity and said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"It's a first-rate idea. <hi rend="italic">I'll buy the Monument."</hi></p>
     <p>Jamrach was speechless for a second. Then he said, like <lb/> one ashamed&mdash;</p>
     <p>"You caught me. I was napping. For a moment I <lb/> thought you were in earnest."</p>
     <pb n="640" entity="DSSR_000002496_0655"/>
     <p>Barnum said pleasantly&mdash;</p>
     <p>"I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> in earnest. I know they won't sell it, but no <reg
       orig="mat-|ter">matter</reg>, <lb/> I will not throw away a good idea for all that. All I
      <lb/> want is a big advertisement. I will keep the thing in mind, <lb/> and if nothing better
      turns up I will offer to buy it. That will <lb/> answer every purpose. It will furnish me a
      couple of columns <lb/> of gratis advertising in every English and American paper for <lb/> a
      couple of months, and give my show the biggest boom a <lb/> show ever had in this world."</p>

      <p>BARNUM'S CHANCE</p>
     </figure>
     <p>Jamrach started to deliver a burst of admiration, but was <lb/> interrupted by Barnum, who
      said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"Here is a state of things! England ought to blush."</p>
     <p>His eye had fallen upon something in the newspaper. He <lb/> read it through to himself,
      then read it aloud. It said that <lb/> the house that Shakespeare was born in at
      Stratford-on-Avon <lb/>
      <pb n="641" entity="DSSR_000002496_0656"/> was falling gradually to ruin through neglect; that
      the room <lb/> where the poet first saw the light was now serving as a <lb/> butcher's shop;
      that all appeals to England to contribute <lb/> money (the requisite sum
      stated) to buy and repair the house <lb/> and place it in the care of salaried and
      trustworthy keepers <lb/> had fallen resultless. Then Barnum said&mdash;</p>
     <p>"There's my chance. Let Jumbo and the Monument alone <lb/> for the
      present&mdash;they'll keep. I'll buy Shakespeare's house. <lb/> I'll set it up in my
      Museum in New York and put a glass case <lb/> around it and make a sacred thing of it; and
      you'll see all <lb/> America flock there to worship; yes, and pilgrims from the <lb/> whole
      earth; and I'll make them take their hats off, too. In <lb/> America we know how to value
      anything that Shakespeare's <lb/> touch has made holy. You'll see."</p>
     <p>In conclusion the S. C. P. said:</p>
     <p>"That is the way the thing came about. Barnum did buy <lb/> Shakespeare's house. He paid the
      price asked, and received <lb/> the properly attested documents of sale. Then there was an
      <lb/> explosion, I can tell you. England rose! What, the <reg orig="birth-|place">birthplace</reg>
      <lb/> of the master-genius of all the ages and all the climes&mdash; <lb/> that priceless
      possession of Britain&mdash;to be carted out of the <lb/> country like so much old lumber
      and set up for sixpenny <reg orig="dese-|cration">desecration</reg>
      <lb/> in a Yankee show-shop&mdash;the idea was not to be <reg orig="toler-|ated"
       >tolerated</reg>
      <lb/> for a moment. England rose in her indignation, and <lb/> Barnum was glad to relinquish
      his prize and offer apologies. <lb/> However, he stood out for a compromise; he claimed a <reg
       orig="con-|cession&mdash;England">concession&mdash;England</reg>
      <lb/> must let him have Jumbo. And England <lb/> consented, but not cheerfully."</p>
     <p>It shows how, by help of time, a story can grow&mdash;even <lb/> after Barnum has had
      the first innings in the telling of it. <lb/> Mr. Barnum told me the story himself, years ago.
      He said <lb/> that the permission to buy Jumbo was not a concession; the <lb/>
      <pb n="642" entity="DSSR_000002496_0657"/> purchase was made and the animal delivered before
      the public <lb/> knew anything about it. Also, that the securing of Jumbo <lb/> was all the
      advertisement he needed. It produced many <lb/> columns of newspaper talk, free of cost, and
      he was satisfied. <lb/> He said that if he had failed to get Jumbo he would have <lb/> caused
      his notion of buying the Nelson Monument to be <reg orig="treach-|erously">treacherously</reg>
      <lb/> smuggled into print by some trusty friend, and after <lb/> he had gotton a few hundred
      pages of gratuitous advertising <lb/> out of it, he would have come out with a blundering,
      obtuse, <lb/> but warm-hearted letter of apology, and in a postscript to it <lb/> would have
      na&iuml;vely proposed to let the Monument go, and <lb/> take Stonehenge in place of it
      at the same price.</p>
     <p>It was his opinion that such a letter, written with <reg orig="well-|simulated"
       >well-simulated</reg>
      <lb/> asinine innocence and gush would have gotten his <lb/> ignorance and stupidity an amount
      of newspaper abuse worth <lb/> six fortunes to him, and not purchasable for twice the money.</p>
     <p>I knew Mr. Barnum well, and I placed every confidence in <lb/> the account which he gave me
      of the Shakespeare birthplace <lb/> episode. He said he found the house neglected and going to
      <lb/> decay, and he inquired into the matter and was told that many <lb/> times earnest
      efforts had been made to raise money for its <lb/> proper repair and preservation, but without
      success. He then <lb/> proposed to buy it. The proposition was entertained, and a <lb/> price
      named&mdash;$50,000, I think; but whatever it was, Barnum <lb/> paid the money down,
      without remark, and the papers were <lb/> drawn up and executed. He said that it had been his
      purpose <lb/> to set up the house in his Museum, keep it in repair, protect it <lb/> from
      name-scribblers and other desecrators, and leave it by <lb/> bequest to the safe and perpetual
      guardianship of the <reg orig="Smith-|sonian">Smithsonian</reg>
      <lb/> Institute at Washington.</p>
     <p>But as soon as it was found that Shakespeare's house had <lb/> passed into foreign hands and
      was going to be carried across <lb/> the ocean, England was stirred as no appeal from the <reg
       orig="custo-|dians">custodians</reg>
      <lb/>
      <pb n="643" entity="DSSR_000002496_0658"/> of the relic had ever stirred England before, and
      protests <lb/> came flowing in&mdash;and money, too, to stop the outrage. Offers <lb/> of
      re-purchase were made&mdash;offers of double the money that <lb/> Mr. Barnum had paid for
      the house. He handed the house <lb/> back, but took only the sum which it had cost
      him&mdash;but on the <lb/> condition that an endowment sufficient for the future <reg
       orig="safe-|guarding">safeguarding</reg>
      <lb/> and maintenance of the sacred relic should be raised. <lb/> This condition was
      fulfilled.</p>

      <lb/> call Natal the garden of South Africa, but that is what it <lb/> probably is.</p>
     <p>It was when Bishop of Natal that Colenso raised such a <lb/> storm in the religious world.
      The concerns of religion are a <lb/> vital matter here yet. A vigilant eye is kept upon
      Sunday. <lb/> Museums and other dangerous resorts are not allowed to be <lb/> open. You may
      sail on the Bay, but it is wicked to play <lb/> cricket. For a while a Sunday concert was
      tolerated, upon <lb/> condition that it must be admission free and the money taken <lb/> by
      collection. But the collection was alarmingly large and <lb/> that stopped the matter. They
      are particular about babies. <lb/> A clergyman would not bury a child according to the sacred
      <lb/> rites because it had not been baptized. The Hindoo is more <lb/> liberal. He burns no
      child under three, holding that it does <lb/> not need purifying.</p>
     <p>The King of the Zulus, a fine fellow of 30, was banished six <lb/> years ago for a term of
      seven years. He is occupying <reg orig="Napo-|leon's">Napoleon's</reg>
      <lb/> old stand&mdash;St. Helena. The people are a little nervous <lb/> about having him
      come back, and they may well be, for Zulu <lb/> kings have been terrible people
      sometimes&mdash;like Tchaka, <lb/> Dingaan, and Cetewayo.</p>
     <p>There is a large Trappist monastery two hours from <reg orig="Dur-|ban">Durban</reg>, <lb/>
      over the country roads, and in company with Mr. Milligan <lb/> and Mr. Hunter, general manager
      of the Natal government <lb/> railways, who knew the heads of it, we went out to see it.</p>
     <p>There it all was, just as one reads about it in books and <lb/>
      <pb n="648" entity="DSSR_000002496_0663"/> cannot believe that it is so&mdash;I mean the
      rough, hard work, <lb/> the impossible hours, the scanty food, the coarse raiment, the <lb/>
      Maryborough beds, the <hi rend="italic">tabu</hi> of human speech, of social <reg

      of the <lb/> presence of woman in the men's establishment. There it all <lb/> was. It was not
      a dream, it was not a lie. And yet with the <lb/> fact before one's face it was still
      incredible. It is such a <lb/> sweeping suppression of human instincts, such an extinction of
      <lb/> the man as an individual.</p>
     <p>La Trappe must have known the human race well. The <lb/> scheme which he invented hunts out
      everything that a man <lb/> wants and values&mdash;and withholds it from him. Apparently
      <lb/> there is no detail that can help make life worth living that <lb/> has not been
      carefully ascertained and placed out of the <reg orig="Trap-|pist's">Trappist's</reg>
      <lb/> reach. La Trappe must have known that there were <lb/> men who would enjoy this kind of
      misery, but how did he <lb/> find it out?</p>
     <p>If he had consulted you or me he would have been told <lb/> that his scheme lacked too many
      attractions; that it was <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg>; <lb/> that it could never
      be floated. But there in the <lb/> monastery was proof that he knew the human race better
      <lb/> than it knew itself. He set his foot upon every desire that <lb/> a man
      has&mdash;yet he floated his project, and it has prospered <lb/> for two hundred years,
      and will go on prospering forever, no <lb/> doubt.</p>
     <p>Man likes personal distinction&mdash;there in the monastery it <lb/> is obliterated. He
      likes delicious food&mdash;there he gets beans <lb/> and bread and tea, and not enough of
      it. He likes to lie <lb/> softly&mdash;there he lies on a sand mattress, and has a pillow
      and <lb/> a blanket, but no sheet. When he is dining, in a great <reg orig="com-|pany">company</reg>
      <lb/> of friends, he likes to laugh and chat&mdash;there a monk <lb/> reads a holy book
      aloud during meals, and nobody speaks or <lb/> laughs. When a man has a hundred friends about

      twice in the night to perform some <lb/> religious office, and gets up finally for the day at
      two in the <lb/> morning. Man likes light work or none at all&mdash;there he <lb/> labors
      all day in the field, or in the blacksmith shop or the <lb/> other shops devoted to the
      mechanical trades, such as <reg orig="shoe-|making">shoemaking</reg>, <lb/> saddlery,
      carpentry, and soon. Man likes the society of <lb/> girls and women&mdash;there he never
      has it. He likes to have <lb/> his children about him, and pet them and play with
      them&mdash; <lb/> there he has none. He likes billiards&mdash;there is no table
      there. <lb/> He likes outdoor sports and indoor dramatic and musical and <lb/> social
      entertainments&mdash;there are none there. He likes to bet <lb/> on things&mdash;I
      was told that betting is forbidden there. When <lb/> a man's temper is up he likes to pour it
      out upon somebody&mdash; <lb/> there this is not allowed. A man likes
      animals&mdash;pets; there <lb/> are none there. He likes to smoke&mdash;there he
      cannot do it. <lb/> He likes to read the news&mdash;no papers or magazines come <lb/>
      there. A man likes to know how his parents and brothers and <lb/> sisters are getting along
      when he is away, and if they miss him <lb/> &mdash;there he cannot know. A man likes a
      pretty house, and <lb/> pretty furniture, and pretty things, and pretty
      colors&mdash;there <lb/> he has nothing but naked aridity and sombre colors. A man <lb/>
      likes&mdash;name it yourself: whatever it is, it is absent from that <lb/> place.</p>
     <p>From what I could learn, all that a man gets for this is <lb/> merely the saving of his
      soul.</p>
     <p>It all seems strange, incredible, impossible. But La Trappe <lb/> knew the race. He knew the
      powerful attraction of <reg orig="unattract-|iveness">unattractiveness</reg>; <lb/> he knew

      <lb/> startled England by its severity; on the top of this came <lb/> Kruger's exposure of the
      cipher correspondence, which showed <lb/> that the invasion of the Transvaal, with the design
      of seizing <lb/> that country and adding it to the British Empire, was planned <lb/> by Cecil
      Rhodes and Beit&mdash;which made a revulsion in <reg orig="Eng-|lish">English</reg>

      comprehension of it, it <lb/> was so tangled. But at last by patient study I have managed
      <lb/> it, I believe. As I understand it, the Uitlanders and other <lb/> Dutchmen were
      dissatisfied because the English would not <lb/> allow them to take any part in the government
      except to pay <lb/> taxes. Next, as I understand it, Dr. Kruger and Dr. Jameson, <lb/> not
      having been able to make the medical business pay, made <lb/> a raid into Matabeleland with
      the intention of capturing the <lb/>

      children to <lb/> ransom until the Uitlanders and the other Boers should grant <lb/> to them
      and the Chartered Company the political rights which <lb/> had been withheld from them. They
      would have succeeded in <lb/> this great scheme, as I understand it, but for the interference
      <lb/> of Cecil Rhodes and Mr. Beit, and other Chiefs of the <reg orig="Mata-|bele"
      >Matabele</reg>, <lb/> who persuaded their countrymen to revolt and throw off <lb/> their
      allegiance to Germany. This, in turn, as I understand <lb/> it, provoked the King of Abyssinia

      citizen to the stranger concerning South African politics, <lb/> and the resulting confusion
      created in the stranger's mind <lb/> thereby.</p>
     <p>But it does not seem so very extravagant now. Nothing <lb/> could in that disturbed and

     <p>I was in South Africa some little time. When I arrived <lb/> there the political pot was

      capital, as prisoners; the Boer <lb/> government had turned Jameson and his officers over to
      the <lb/> British government for trial, and shipped them to England; <lb/> next, it had

     <p>I was disappointed. There were singularities, perplexities, <lb/> unaccountabilities about
      it which I was not able to master. I <lb/> had no personal access to Boers&mdash;their
      side was a secret to me, <lb/> aside from what I was able to gather of it from published <lb/>
      statements. My sympathies were soon with the Reformers in <lb/> the Pretoria jail, with their
      friends, and with their cause. By <lb/> diligent inquiry in Johannesburg I found
      out&mdash;apparently&mdash; <lb/> all the details of their side of the quarrel

     <p>Nobody seemed to know.</p>
     <p>The reason why the Reformers were discontented and <lb/> wanted some changes made, seemed
      quite clear. In <reg orig="Johannes-|burg">Johannesburg</reg>
      <lb/> it was claimed that the Uitlanders (strangers, foreigners) <lb/> paid
      thirteen-fifteenths of the Transvaal taxes, yet got little or <lb/> nothing for it. Their city
      had no charter; it had no municipal <lb/> government; it could levy no taxes for drainage,
      water-supply, <lb/> paving, cleaning, sanitation, policing. There was a police <lb/> force,
      but it was composed of Boers, it was furnished by the <lb/> State Government, and the city had
      no control over it. <reg orig="Min-|ing">Mining</reg>
      <lb/> was very costly; the government enormously increased the <lb/> cost by putting

      <lb/> from over the water held all the public offices. The <lb/> government was rank with
      corruption. The Uitlander had no <lb/> vote, and must live in the State ten or twelve years
      before he <lb/> could get one. He was not represented in the Read <reg
       orig="(legis-|lature)">(legislature)</reg>
      <lb/> that oppressed him and fleeced him. Religion was not <lb/> free. There were no schools
      where the teaching was in <reg orig="Eng-|lish">English</reg>, <lb/> yet the great majority of
      the white population of the <lb/> State knew no tongue but that. The State would not pass a
      <lb/> liquor law; but allowed a great trade in cheap vile brandy <lb/> among the blacks, with
      the result that 25 per cent. of the <lb/> 50,000 blacks employed in the mines were usually
      drunk and <lb/> incapable of working.</p>
     <p>There&mdash;it was plain enough that the <hi rend="italic">reasons</hi> for wanting
      <lb/> some changes made were abundant and reasonable, if this <reg orig="state-|ment"
       >statement</reg>
      <lb/> of the existing grievances was correct.</p>
     <p>What the Uitlanders wanted was reform&mdash;<hi rend="italic">under the <reg
        orig="exist-|ing">existing</reg>
       <lb/> Republic.</hi></p>
     <p>What they proposed to do was to secure these reforms by <lb/>
      <hi rend="italic">prayer, petition, and persuasion.</hi></p>
     <p>They did petition. Also, they issued a Manifesto, whose <lb/> very first note is a
      bugle-blast of loyalty: "We want the <lb/> establishment of this Republic as a true Republic."</p>
     <p>Could anything be clearer than the Uitlander's statement <lb/> of the grievances and
      oppressions under which they were <lb/> suffering? Could anything be more legal and
      citizenlike and <lb/> law-respecting than their attitude as expressed by their <reg
       orig="Mani-|festo">Manifesto</reg>? <lb/> No. Those things were perfectly clear, perfectly
       <reg orig="com-|prehensible">comprehensible</reg>.</p>
     <p>But at this point the puzzles and riddles and confusions <lb/>
      <pb n="659" entity="DSSR_000002496_0674"/> begin to flock in. You have arrived at a place
      which you <reg orig="can-|not">cannot</reg>
      <lb/> quite understand.</p>
     <p>For you find that as a preparation for this loyal, lawful, <lb/> and in every way
      unexceptionable attempt to persuade the <reg orig="gov-|ernment">government</reg>
      <lb/> to right their grievances, the Uitlanders had <reg orig="smug-|gled">smuggled</reg>
      <lb/> a Maxim gun or two and 1,500 muskets into the town, <lb/> concealed in oil tanks and
      coal cars, and had begun to form <lb/> and drill military companies composed of clerks,
      merchants, <lb/> and citizens generally.</p>
     <p>What was their idea? Did they suppose that the Boers <lb/> would attack them for <hi
       rend="italic">petitioning for redress?</hi> That could <lb/> not be.</p>
     <p>Did they suppose that the Boers would attack them even <lb/> for issuing a Manifesto <hi
       rend="italic">demanding</hi> relief under the existing <lb/> government?</p>
     <p>Yes, they apparently believed so, because the air was full of <lb/> talk of <hi
       rend="italic">forcing</hi> the government to grant redress if it were not <lb/> granted
      peacefully.</p>
     <p>The Reformers were men of high intelligence. If they <lb/> were in earnest, they were taking
      extraordinary risks. They <lb/> had enormously valuable properties to defend; their town was
      <lb/> full of women and children; their mines and compounds were <lb/> packed with thousands
      upon thousands of sturdy blacks. If <lb/> the Boers attacked, the mines would close, the
      blacks would <lb/> swarm out and get drunk; riot and conflagration and the Boers <lb/>
      together might lose the Reformers more in a day, in money, <lb/> blood, and suffering, than
      the desired political relief could <reg orig="com-|pensate">compensate</reg>
      <lb/> in ten years if they won the fight and secured the <lb/> reforms.</p>
     <p>It is May, 1897, now; a year has gone by, and the <reg orig="confu-|sions">confusions</reg>
      <lb/> of that day have been to a considerable degree cleared <lb/> away. Mr. Cecil Rhodes, Dr.
      Jameson, and others responsible <lb/> for the Raid, have testified before the Parliamentary
      Committee <lb/>
      <pb n="660" entity="DSSR_000002496_0675"/> of Inquiry in London, and so have Mr. Lionel
      Phillips and <lb/> other Johannesburg Reformers, monthly-nurses of the <reg
       orig="Revolu-|tion">Revolution</reg>
      <lb/> which was born dead. These testimonies have thrown <lb/> light. Three books have been
      added much to this light: <lb/> "South Africa As It Is," by Mr. Statham, an able writer <lb/>
      partial to the Boers; "The Story of an African Crisis," <lb/> by Mr. Garrett, a brilliant
      writer partial to Rhodes; and "A <lb/> Woman's Part in a Revolution," by Mrs. John Hays <reg
       orig="Ham-|mond">Hammond</reg>, <lb/> a vigorous and vivid diarist, partial to the Reformers.
      <lb/> By liquifying the evidence of the prejudiced books and of <lb/> the prejudiced
      parliamentary witnesses and stirring the whole <lb/> together and pouring it into my own
      (prejudiced) moulds, I <lb/> have got at the truth of that puzzling South
      African situation, <lb/> which is this:</p>
     <p>1. The capitalists and other chief men of Johannesburg <lb/> were fretting under various
      political and financial burdens <reg orig="im-|posed">imposed</reg>
      <lb/> by the State (the South African Republic, sometimes <lb/> called "the
      Transvaal") and desired to procure by peaceful <lb/> means a modification of the
      laws.</p>
     <p>2. Mr. Cecil Rhodes, Premier of the British Cape Colony, <lb/> millionaire, creator and
      managing director of the <reg orig="territorially-|immense">territorially-immense</reg>
      <lb/> and financially unproductive South Africa Company; <lb/> projector of vast schemes for
      the unification and consolidation of <lb/> all the South African States into one imposing
      commonwealth <lb/> or empire under the shadow and general protection of the <lb/> British
      flag, thought he saw an opportunity to make profitable <lb/> use of the Uitlander discontent
      above mentioned&mdash;make the <lb/> Johannesburg cat help pull out one of his
      consolidation <reg orig="chest-|nuts">chestnuts</reg>
      <lb/> for him. With this view he set himself the task of <reg orig="warm-|ing">warming</reg>
      <lb/> the lawful and legitimate petitions and supplications of the <lb/> Uitlanders into
      seditious talk, and their frettings into <reg orig="threat-|enings&mdash;the"
       >threatenings&mdash;the</reg>
      <lb/> final outcome to be revolt and armed rebellion. <lb/> If he could bring about a bloody
      collision between those people <lb/>
      <pb n="661" entity="DSSR_000002496_0676"/> and the Boer government, Great Britain would have
      to <reg orig="inter-|fere">interfere</reg>; <lb/> her interference would be resisted by the
      Boers; she <lb/> would chastise them and add the Transvaal to her South <reg orig="Afri-|can"
       >African</reg>
      <lb/> possessions. It was not a foolish idea, but a rational and <lb/> practical one.</p>
     <p>After a couple of years of judicious plotting, Mr. Rhodes <lb/> had his reward; the
      revolutionary kettle was briskly boiling in <lb/> Johannesburg, and the Uitlander leaders were
      backing their <lb/> appeals to the government&mdash;now hardened into demands&mdash;
      <lb/> by threats of force and bloodshed. By the middle of <reg orig="De-|cember"
      >December</reg>, <lb/> 1895, the explosion seemed imminent. Mr. Rhodes was <lb/> diligently
      helping, from his distant post in Cape Town. He <lb/> was helping to procure arms for
      Johannesburg; he was also <lb/> arranging to have Jameson break over the border and come to
      <lb/> Johannesburg with 600 mounted men at his back. Jameson&mdash; <lb/> as per
      instructions from Rhodes, perhaps&mdash;wanted a letter <lb/> from the Reformers
      requesting him to come to their aid. It <lb/> was a good idea. It would throw a considerable
      share of the <lb/> responsibility of his invasion upon the Reformers. He got the <lb/>
      letter&mdash;that famous one urging him to fly to the rescue of the <lb/> women and
      children. He got it <hi rend="italic">two months</hi> before he flew. <lb/> The Reformers seem
      to have thought it over and concluded <lb/> that they had not done wisely; for the next day
      after giving <lb/> Jameson the implicating document they wanted to withdraw <lb/> it and leave
      the women and children in danger; but they were <lb/> told that it was too late. The original
      had gone to Mr. Rhodes <lb/> at the Cape. Jameson had kept a copy, though.</p>
     <p>From that time until the 29th of December, a good deal of <lb/> the Reformers' time was
      taken up with energetic efforts to <lb/> keep Jameson from coming to their assistance.
      Jameson's <reg orig="in-|vasion">invasion</reg>
      <lb/> had been set for the 26th. The Reformers were not <lb/> ready. The town was not united.
      Some wanted a fight, <lb/> some wanted peace; some wanted a new government, some <lb/>
      <pb n="662" entity="DSSR_000002496_0677"/> wanted the existing one reformed; apparently very
      few wanted <lb/> the revolution to take place in the interest and under the <reg
       orig="ulti-|mate">ultimate</reg>
      <lb/> shelter of the Imperial flag&mdash;British; yet a report began <lb/> to spread that
      Mr. Rhodes's embarrassing assistance had for its <lb/> end this latter object.</p>
     <p>Jameson was away up on the frontier tugging at his leash, <lb/> fretting to burst over the
      border. By hard work the <reg orig="Reform-|ers">Reformers</reg>
      <lb/> got his starting-date postponed a little, and wanted to get <lb/> it postponed eleven
      days. Apparently, Rhodes's agents were <lb/> seconding their efforts&mdash;in fact
      wearing out the telegraph <lb/> wires trying to hold him back. Rhodes was himself the only
      <lb/> man who could have effectively postponed Jameson, but that <lb/> would have been a
      disadvantage to his scheme; indeed, it could <lb/> spoil his whole two years' work.</p>
     <p>Jameson endured postponement three days, then resolved <lb/> to wait no longer. Without any
      orders&mdash;excepting Mr. <lb/> Rhodes's significant silence&mdash;he cut the
      telegraph wires on the <lb/> 29th, and made his plunge that night, to go to the rescue of the
      <lb/> women and children, by urgent request of a letter now nine <lb/> days old&mdash;as
      per date,&mdash;a couple of months old, in fact. He <lb/> read the letter to his men, and
      it affected them. It did not <reg orig="af-|fect">affect</reg>
      <lb/> all of them alike. Some saw in it a piece of piracy of <lb/> doubtful wisdom, and were
      sorry to find that they had been <lb/> assembled to violate friendly territory instead of to
      raid native <lb/> kraals, as they had supposed.</p>
     <p>Jameson would have to ride 150 miles. He knew that there <lb/> were suspicions abroad in the
      Transvaal concerning him, but he <lb/> expected to get through to Johannesburg before they
      should <lb/> become general and obstructive. But a telegraph wire had <lb/> been overlooked
      and not cut. It spread the news of his <reg orig="inva-|sion">invasion</reg>
      <lb/> far and wide, and a few hours after his start the Boer <lb/> farmers were riding hard
      from every direction to intercept <lb/> him.</p>

     <pb n="665" entity="DSSR_000002496_0680"/>
     <p>As soon as it was known in Johannesburg that he was on <lb/> his way to rescue the women and
      children, the grateful people <lb/> put the women and children in a train and rushed them for
      <lb/> Australia. In fact, the approach of Johannesburg's saviour <reg orig="cre-|ated">created</reg>
      <lb/> panic and consternation there, and a multitude of males <lb/> of peaceable disposition
      swept to the trains like a sand-storm. <lb/> The carly ones fared best; they secured
      seats&mdash;by sitting in <lb/> them&mdash;eight hours before the first train was
      timed to leave.</p>
     <p>Mr. Rhodes lost no time. He cabled the renowned <reg orig="Johan-|nesburg">Johannesburg</reg>
      <lb/> letter of invitation to the London press&mdash;the <reg orig="gray-|headedest"
       >gray-headedest</reg>
      <lb/> piece of ancient history that ever went over a cable.</p>
     <p>The new poet laureate lost no time. He came out with a <lb/> rousing poem lauding Jameson's
      prompt and splendid heroism <lb/> in flying to the rescue of the women and children; for the
      poet <lb/> could not know that he did not fly until two months after the <lb/> invitation. He
      was deceived by the false date of the letter, <lb/> which was December 20th.</p>
     <p>Jameson was intercepted by the Boers on New Year's Day, <lb/> and on the next day he
      surrendered. He had carried his copy <lb/> of the letter along, and if his instructions
      required him&mdash;in <lb/> case of emergency&mdash;to see that it fell into the
      hands of the <lb/> Boers, he loyally carried them out. Mrs. Hammond gives him <lb/> a sharp
      rap for his supposed carelessness, and emphasizes her <lb/> feeling about it with burning
      italics: "It was picked up on the <lb/> battle-field in a leathern pouch, supposed to be Dr.
      Jameson's <lb/> saddle-bag. <hi rend="italic">Why, in the name of all that is discreet and
        <reg orig="hon-|orable">honorable</reg>, <lb/> didn't he eat it!"</hi></p>
     <p>She requires too much. He was not in the service of the <lb/> Reformers&mdash;excepting
      ostensibly; he was in the service of Mr. <lb/> Rhodes. It was the only plain English document,
      undarkened <lb/> by ciphers and mysteries, and responsibly signed and <reg
       orig="authenti-|cated">authenticated</reg>, <lb/> which squarely implicated the Reformers in
      the raid, and <lb/> it was not to Mr. Rhodes's interest that it should be caten. <reg
       orig="Be-|sides">Besides</reg>, <lb/>
      <pb n="666" entity="DSSR_000002496_0681"/> that letter was not the original, it was only a
      copy. Mr. <lb/> Rhodes had the original&mdash;and didn't eat it. He cabled it to <lb/>
      the London press. It had already been read in England and <lb/> America and all over Europe
      before Jameson dropped it on the <lb/> battlefield. If the subordinate's knuckles deserved a
      rap, the <lb/> principal's deserved as many as a couple of them.</p>
     <p>That letter is a juicily dramatic incident and is entitled to <lb/> all its celebrity,
      because of the odd and variegated effects which <lb/> it produced. All within the space of a
      single week it had made <lb/> Jameson an illustrious hero in England, a pirate in Pretoria,
      <lb/> and an ass without discretion or honor in Johannesburg; also <lb/> it had produced a
      poet-laureatic explosion of colored fireworks <lb/> which filled the world's sky with giddy
      splendors, and the <lb/> knowledge that Jameson was coming with it to rescue the <lb/> women
      and children emptied Johannesburg of that detail of <lb/> the population. For an old letter,
      this was much. For a <reg orig="let-|ter">letter</reg>
      <lb/> two months old, it did marvels; if it had been a year old it <lb/> would have done
      miracles.</p>

      the harassed Reformers.</p>
     <p>From Mrs. Hammond we learn that on the 31st (the <lb/> day after Johannesburg heard
      of the invasion), "the Reform <lb/> Committee repudiates Dr. Jameson's inroad."</p>
     <p>It also publishes its intention to adhere to the Manifesto.</p>
     <p>It also earnestly desires that the inhabitants shall refrain <lb/> from overt acts against
      the Boer government.</p>
     <p>It also "distributes arms" at the Court House, and <reg orig="fur-|nishes">furnishes</reg>
      <lb/> horses "to the newly-enrolled volunteers."</p>
     <p>It also brings a Transvaal flag into the committee-room, <lb/> and the entire body swear
      allegiance to it "with uncovered <lb/> heads and upraised arms."</p>
     <p>Also "one thousand Lee-Metford rifles have been given <lb/> out"&mdash;to rebels.</p>
     <p>Also, in a speech, Reformer Lionel Phillips informs the <lb/> public that the Reform
      Committee Delegation has "been <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg>
      <lb/> with courtesy by the Government Commission," and <lb/> "been assured that their

      Reform Committee regretted <reg orig="Jame-|son's">Jameson's</reg>
      <lb/> precipitate action, they would stand by him."</p>
     <p>Also the populace are in a state of "wild enthusiasm," and <lb/> "can scarcely be
      restrained; they want to go out to meet <lb/> Jameson and bring him in with triumphal outcry."</p>
     <p>Also the British High Commissioner has issued a <reg orig="damnify-|ing">damnifying</reg>

      January 1st.</p>
     <pb n="668" entity="DSSR_000002496_0683"/>
     <p>It is a difficult position for the Reformers, and full of <reg orig="him-|drances"
       >himdrances</reg>
      <lb/> and perplexities. Their duty is hard, but plain:</p>
     <list>
      <item>1. They have to repudiate the inroad, and stand by the <lb/> inroader.</item>
      <item>2. They have to swear allegiance to the Boer government, <lb/> and distribute cavalry
       horses to the rebels.</item>
      <item>3. They have to forbid overt acts against the Boer <reg orig="gov-|ernment"
       >government</reg>, <lb/> and distribute arms to its enemies.</item>
      <item>4. They have to avoid collision with the British <reg orig="govern-|ment"
       >government</reg>, <lb/> but still stand by Jameson and their new oath of <reg
        orig="allegi-|ance">allegiance</reg>
       <lb/> to the Boer government, taken, uncovered, in presence of <lb/> its flag.</item>
     </list>
     <p>They did such of these things as they could; they tried to <lb/> do them all; in fact, did
      do them all, but only in turn, not <lb/> simultaneously. In the nature of things they could
      not be <lb/> made to simultane.</p>
     <p>In preparing for armed revolution and in talking <reg orig="revolu-|tion">revolution</reg>,
      <lb/> were the Reformers "bluffing," or were they in earnest? <lb/> If they were in earnest,
      they were taking great risks&mdash;as has <lb/> been already pointed out. A gentleman of
      high position told <lb/> me in Johannesburg that he had in his possession a printed <lb/>
      document proclaiming a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> government and naming its <reg
       orig="presi-|dent&mdash;one">president&mdash;one</reg>
      <lb/> of the Reform leaders. He said that this <reg orig="proclama-|tion">proclamation</reg>
      <lb/> had been ready for issue, but was suppressed when the <lb/> raid collapsed. Perhaps I
      misunderstood him. Indeed, I must <lb/> have misunderstood him, for I have not seen mention of
      this <lb/> large incident in print anywhere.</p>
     <p>Besides, I hope I am mistaken; for, if I am, then there is <lb/> argument that the Reformers
      were privately not serious, but <lb/> were only trying to scare the Boer government into
      granting <lb/> the desired reforms.</p>
     <p>The Boer government <hi rend="italic">was</hi> scared, and it had a right to be. <lb/> For
      if Mr. Rhodes's plan was to provoke a collision that would <lb/>
      <pb n="669" entity="DSSR_000002496_0684"/> compel the interference of England, that was a
      serious matter. <lb/> If it could be shown that that was also the Reformers' plan <lb/> and
      purpose, it would prove that they had marked out a <lb/> feasible project, at any rate,
      although it was one which could <lb/> hardly fail to cost them ruinously before England should
      <lb/> arrive. But it seems clear that they had no such plan nor <lb/> desire. If, when the
      worst should come to the worst, they <lb/> meant to overthrow the government, they also meant
      to inherit <lb/> the assets themselves, no doubt.</p>
     <p>This scheme could hardly have succeeded. With an army <lb/> of Boers at their gates and
      50,000 riotous blacks in their midst, <lb/> the odds against success would have been too
      heavy&mdash;even if <lb/> the whole town had been armed. With only 2,500 rifles in <lb/>
      the place, they stood really no chance.</p>
     <p>To me, the military problems of the situation are of more <lb/> interest than the political
      ones, because by disposition I have <lb/> always been especially fond of war. No, I mean fond
      of <reg orig="dis-|cussing">discussing</reg>
      <lb/> war; and fond of giving military advice. If I had <lb/> been with Jameson the morning
      after he started, I should have <lb/> advised him to turn back. That was Monday; it was then
      that <lb/> he received his first warning from a Boer source not to violate <lb/> the friendly
      soil of the Transvaal. It showed that his invasion <lb/> was known. If I had been with him on
      Tuesday morning and <lb/> afternoon, when he received further warnings, I should have <lb/>
      repeated my advice. If I had been with him the next <reg orig="morn-|ing&mdash;New"
       >morning&mdash;New</reg>
      <lb/> Year's&mdash;when he received notice that "a few <lb/> hundred" Boers were waiting
      for him a few miles ahead, I <lb/> should not have advised, but commanded him to go back.
      <lb/> And if I had been with him two or three hours later&mdash;a thing <lb/> not
      conceivable to me&mdash;I should have retired him by force; <lb/> for at that time he
      learned that the few hundred had now <lb/> grown to 800; and that meant that the growing would
      go on <lb/> growing.</p>
     <pb n="670" entity="DSSR_000002496_0685"/>
     <p>For, by authority of Mr. Garrett, one knows that <reg orig="Jame-|son's">Jameson's</reg>
      <lb/> 600 were only 530 at most, when you count out his native <lb/> drivers, etc.; and that
      the 530 consisted largely of "green" <lb/> youths, "raw young fellows," not trained and
      war-worn <reg orig="Brit-|ish">British</reg>
      <lb/> soldiers; and I would have told Jameson that those lads <lb/> would not be able to shoot
      effectively from horseback in the <lb/> scamper and racket of battle, and that there would not
      be <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg>
      <lb/> for them to shoot at, anyway, but rocks; for the Boers <lb/> would be behind the rocks,

      unsheltered, before the hidden Boer, and taking the results. <lb/> Jameson's men would follow

      <lb/> history, according to precedent. Americans are not <reg orig="ac-|quainted">acquainted</reg>
      <lb/> with the British-Boer war of 1881; but its history is <lb/> interesting, and could have
      been instructive to Jameson if he <lb/> had been receptive. I will cull some details of it
      from <reg orig="trust-|worthy">trustworthy</reg>
      <lb/> sources&mdash;mainly from "Russell's Natal." Mr. Russell <lb/> is not a Boer, but a
      Briton. He is inspector of schools, and his <lb/> history is a text-book whose purpose is the
      instruction of the <lb/> Natal English youth.</p>
     <p>After the seizure of the Transvaal and the suppression of <lb/> the Boer government by
      England in 1877, the Boers fretted for <lb/> three years, and made several appeals to England
      for a <reg orig="restora-|tion">restoration</reg>
      <lb/> of their liberties, but without result. Then they gathered <lb/> themselves together in
      a great mass-meeting at Krugersdorp, <lb/> talked their troubles over, and resolved to fight
      for their <reg orig="deliv-|erance">deliverance</reg>
      <lb/> from the British yoke. (Krugersdorp&mdash;the place where <lb/> the Boers
      interrupted the Jameson raid.) The little handful of <lb/> farmers rose against the
      strongest empire in the world. They <lb/> proclaimed martial law and the re-establishment of
      their <reg orig="Re-|public">Republic</reg>. <lb/> They organized their forces and sent them
      forward to <lb/> intercept the British battalions. This, although Sir Garnet <lb/> Wolseley
      had but lately made proclamation that "so long as <lb/> the sun shone in the heavens," the
      Transvaal would be and <lb/> remain English territory. And also in spite of the fact that
      <lb/> the commander of the 94th regiment&mdash;already on the march <lb/> to suppress
      this rebellion&mdash;had been heard to say that "the <lb/> Boers would turn tail at the
      first beat of the big drum."<ref target="n671.1" n="19">*</ref>

     <p>Four days after the flag-raising, the Boer force which had <lb/> been sent forward to forbid
      the invasion of the English troops <lb/> met them at Bronkhorst Spruit&mdash;246 men of

      beating, the band <lb/>
      <pb n="672" entity="DSSR_000002496_0687"/> playing&mdash;and the first battle was fought.
      It lasted ten <reg orig="min-|utes">minutes</reg>. <lb/> Result:</p>

     <p>They are fine marksmen, the Boers. From the cradle up, <lb/> they live on horseback and hunt

      <lb/> nothing else.</p>
     <p>"General Sir George Colley, Lieutenant-Governor and <lb/> Commander-in-Chief in Natal, felt
      it his duty to proceed at <lb/> once to the relief of the loyalists and soldiers beleaguered
      in <lb/> the different towns of the Transvaal." He moved out with <lb/> 1,000 men and some
      artillery. He found the Boers encamped <lb/> in a strong and sheltered position on high ground
      at Laing's <lb/> Nek&mdash;every Boer behind a rock. Early in the morning of <lb/> the
      28th January, 1881, he moved to the attack "with the <lb/> 58th regiment, commanded by Colonel
      Deane, a mounted <lb/> squadron of 70 men, the 60th Rifles, the Naval Brigade with <lb/> three
      rocket tubes, and the Artillery with six guns." He <lb/> shelled the Boers for twenty minutes,
      then the assault was <reg orig="de-|livered">delivered</reg>, <lb/> the 58th marching up the
      slope <hi rend="italic">in solid column</hi>. The <lb/> battle was soon finished, with this
      result, according to Russell:</p>
     <p>
      <hi rend="italic">British loss in killed and wounded, 174.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>
      <hi rend="italic">Boer loss, "trifling."</hi>
     </p>
     <p>Colonel Deane was killed, and apparently every officer above <lb/> the grade of lieutenant
      was killed or wounded, for the 58th <lb/> retreated to its camp <hi rend="italic">in command
       of a lieutenant</hi>. ("Africa as <lb/> It Is.")</p>
     <p>That ended the second battle.</p>
     <p>On the 7th of February General Colley discovered that the <lb/> Boers were flanking his
      position. The next morning he left <lb/> his camp at Mount Pleasant and marched out and
      crossed the <lb/>
      <pb n="673" entity="DSSR_000002496_0688"/> Ingogo river with 270 men, started up the Ingogo
      heights, and <lb/> there fought a battle which lasted from noon till nightfall. He <lb/> then
      retreated, leaving his wounded with his military <reg orig="chap-|lain">chaplain</reg>, <lb/>
      and in recrossing the now swollen river lost some of his <lb/> men by drowning. That was the
      third Boer victory. Result, <lb/> according to Mr. Russell:</p>
     <p>
      <hi rend="italic">British loss 150 out of 270 engaged.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>
      <hi rend="italic">Boer loss, 8 killed, 9 wounded&mdash;17.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>There was a season of quiet, now, but at the end of about <lb/> three weeks Sir George
      Colley conceived the idea of climbing, <lb/> with an infantry and artillery force, the steep
      and rugged <lb/> mountain of Amajuba in the night&mdash;a bitter hard task, but he <lb/>
      accomplished it. On the way he left about 200 men to guard <lb/> a strategic point, and took
      about 400 up the mountain with <lb/> him. When the sun rose in the morning, there was an <reg
       orig="un-|pleasant">unpleasant</reg>
      <lb/> surprise for the Boers; yonder were the English <lb/> troops visible on top of the
      mountain two or three miles away, <lb/> and now their own position was at the mercy of the
      English <lb/> artillery. The Boer chief resolved to retreat&mdash;up that <reg
       orig="moun-|tain">mountain</reg>. <lb/> He asked for volunteers, and got them.</p>
     <p>The storming party crossed the swale and began to creep <lb/> up the steeps, "and from
      behind rocks and bushes they shot at <lb/> the soldiers on the sky-line as if they were
      stalking deer," says <lb/> Mr. Russell. There was "continuous musketry fire, steady <lb/> and
      fatal on the one side, wild and ineffectual on the other." <lb/> The Boers reached the top,
      and began to put in their ruinous <lb/> work. Presently the British "broke and fled for their
      lives <lb/> down the rugged steep." The Boers had won the battle. <lb/> Result in killed and
      wounded, including among the killed the <lb/> British General:</p>
     <p>
      <hi rend="italic">British loss, 226, out of 400 engaged.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>
      <hi rend="italic">Boer loss, I killed, 5 wounded.</hi>
     </p>
     <pb n="674" entity="DSSR_000002496_0689"/>
     <p>That ended the war. England listened to reason, and <lb/> recognized the Boer
      Republic&mdash;a government which has <lb/> never been in any really awful danger since,
      until Jameson <lb/> started after it with his 500 "raw young fellows." To <reg
       orig="reca-|pitulate">recapitulate</reg>:</p>
     <p>The Boer farmers and British soldiers fought 4 battles, and <lb/> the Boers won them all.
      Result of the 4, in killed and wounded:</p>
     <p>
      <hi rend="italic">British loss, 700 men.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>
      <hi rend="italic">Boer loss, so far as known, 23 men.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>It is interesting, now, to note how loyally Jameson and his <lb/> several trained British
      military officers tried to make their <reg orig="bat-|tles">battles</reg>
      <lb/> conform to precedent. Mr. Garrett's account of the Raid <lb/> is much the best one I
      have met with, and my impressions of <lb/> the Raid are drawn from that.</p>
     <p>When Jameson learned that near Krugersdorp he would <lb/> find 800 Boers waiting to dispute
      his passage, he was not in the <lb/> least disturbed. He was feeling as he had felt two or
      three <lb/> days before, when he had opened his campaign with a historic <lb/> remark to the
      same purport as the one with which the <reg orig="com-|mander">commander</reg>
      <lb/> of the 94th had opened the Boer-British war of fourteen <lb/> years before. That
      Commander's remark was, that the Boers <lb/> "would turn tail at the first beat of the big
      drum." Jameson's <lb/> was, that with his "raw young fellows" he could kick the <lb/>
      (persons) of the Boers "all round the Transvaal." He was <lb/> keeping close
      to historic precedent.</p>
     <p>Jameson arrived in the presence of the Boers. They&mdash; <lb/> according to
      precedent&mdash;were not visible. It was a country <lb/> of ridges, depressions, rocks,
      ditches, moraines of mining-<reg orig="tail-|ings&mdash;not">tailings&mdash;not</reg>
      <lb/> even as favorable for cavalry work as Laing's Nek <lb/> had been in the former
      disastrous days. Jameson shot at the <lb/> ridges and rocks with his artillery, just as
      General Colley had <lb/> done at the Nek; and did them no damage and persuaded no <lb/> Boer
      to show himself. Then about a hundred of his men <lb/>
      <pb entity="DSSR_000002496_0690"/>
      <figure id="f179" rend="page" entity="DSSR_000002496_0690">
       <p>AFTER THE FIGHTING.</p>

      <pb entity="DSSR_000002496_0691"/>
      <pb n="677" entity="DSSR_000002496_0692"/> formed up to charge the ridge&mdash;according
      to the 58th's <reg orig="pre-|cedent">precedent</reg>
      <lb/> at the Nek; but as they dashed forward they opened <lb/> out in a long line, which was a
      considerable improvement on <lb/> the 58th's tacties; when they had gotten to within 200 yards
      <lb/> of the ridge the concealed Boers opened out on them and <lb/> emptied 20 saddles. The
      unwounded dismounted and fired at <lb/> the rocks over the backs of their horses; but the
      return-fire <lb/> was too hot, and they mounted again, "and galloped back or <lb/> crawled
      away into a clump of reeds for cover, where they were <lb/> shortly afterward taken prisoners
      as they lay among the reeds. <lb/> Some thirty prisoners were so taken, and during the night
      <lb/> which followed the Boers carried away another thirty <lb/> killed and
      wounded&mdash;the wounded to Krugersdorp hospital." <lb/> Sixty per cent. of the
      assaulted force disposed of&mdash;according <lb/> to Mr. Garrett's estimate.</p>
     <p>It was according to Amajuba precedent, where the British <lb/> loss was 226 out of about 400
      engaged.</p>
     <p>Also, in Jameson's camp, that night, "there lay about 30 <lb/> wounded or otherwise
      disabled" men. Also during the night <lb/> "some 30 or 40 young fellows got separated from the
       <reg orig="com-|mand">command</reg>
      <lb/> and straggled through into Johannesburg." Altogether <lb/> a possible 150 men gone, out
      of his 530. His lads had fought <lb/> valorously, but had not been able to get near enough to
      a Boer <lb/> to kick him around the Transvaal.</p>
     <p>At dawn the next morning the column of something short <lb/> of 400 whites resumed its
      march. Jameson's grit was <reg orig="stub-|bornly">stubbornly</reg>
      <lb/> good; indeed, it was always that. He still had hopes. <lb/> There was a long and tedious
      zigzagging march through <lb/> broken ground, with constant harassment from the Boers; <lb/>
      and at last the column "walked into a sort of trap," and the <lb/> Boers "closed in upon it."
      "Men and horses dropped on all <lb/> sides. In the column the feeling grew that unless it
      could <lb/> burst through the Boer lines at this point it was done for. <lb/>
      <pb n="678" entity="DSSR_000002496_0693"/> The Maxims were fired until they grew too hot, and,
      water <lb/> failing for the cool jacket, five of them jammed and went out <lb/> of action. The
      7-pounder was fired until only half an hour's <lb/> ammunition was left to fire with. One last
      rush was made, <lb/> and failed, and then the Staats Artillery came up on the left <lb/>
      flank, and the game was up."</p>
     <p>Jameson hoisted a white flag and surrendered.</p>
     <p>There is a story, which may not be true, about an ignorant <lb/> Boer farmer there who
      thought that this white flag was the <lb/> national flag of England. He had been at
      Bronkhorst, and <lb/> Laing's Nek, and Ingogo and Amajuba, and supposed that the <lb/> English
      did not run up their flag excepting at the end of a fight.</p>

      <p>PRISONERS AT ROLL CALL.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>The following is (as I understand it) Mr. Garrett's estimate <lb/> of
      Jameson's total loss in killed and wounded for the two days:</p>
     <p>"When they gave in they were minus some 20 per cent. of <lb/> combatants. There were 76
      casualties. There were 30 men <lb/> hurt or sick in the wagons. There were 27 killed on the
      spot <lb/> or mortally wounded."</p>
     <pb n="679" entity="DSSR_000002496_0694"/>
     <p>Total, 133, out of the original 530. It is just 25 per cent.<ref target="n679.1" n="20">*</ref>
      <note id="n679.1" place="foot" n="20"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg>

       <p>However, I judge that the total was really 150; for the number of wounded <lb/> carried to
        Krugersdorp hospital was 53; not 30, as Mr. Garrett reports it. The lady <lb/> whose guest I
        was in Krugerdorp gave me the figures. She was head nurse from the <lb/> beginning of
        hostilities (Jan. 1) until the professional nurses arrived, Jan. 8th. Of
        <lb/> the 53, "Three or four were Boers"; I quote her words.</p>
      </note> This is a large improvement upon the precedents established at <lb/> Bronkhorst,
      Laing's Nek, Ingogo, and Amajuba, and seems to <lb/> indicate that Boer marksmanship is not so
      good now as it was <lb/> in those days. But there is one detail in which the <reg
       orig="Raid-|episode">Raid-episode</reg>
      <lb/> exactly repeats history. By surrender at Bronkhorst, <lb/> the whole British force
      disappeared from the theater of war; <lb/> this was the case with Jameson's force.</p>
     <p>In the Boer loss, also, historical precedent is followed with <lb/> sufficient fidelity. In
      the 4 battles named above, the Boer <lb/> loss, so far as known, was an average of 6 men per
      battle, to <lb/> the British average loss of 175. In Jameson's battles, as per <lb/> Boer
      official report, the Boer loss in killed was 4. Two of <lb/> these were killed by the Boers
      themselves, by accident, the <lb/> other by Jameson's army&mdash;one of them
      intentionally, the <lb/> other by a pathetic mischance. "A young Boer named Jacobz <lb/> was
      moving forward to give a drink to one of the wounded <lb/> troopers
      (Jameson's) after the first charge, when another <lb/> wounded man,
      mistaking his intention, shot him." There <lb/> were three or four wounded Boers in the
      Krugersdorp hospital, <lb/> and apparently no others have been reported. Mr. Garrett, <lb/>
      "on a balance of probabilities, fully accepts the official version, <lb/> and thanks Heaven
      the killed was not larger."</p>
     <p>As a military man, I wish to point out what seems to me <lb/> to be military errors in the
      conduct of the campaign which we <lb/> have just been considering. I have seen active service
      in the <lb/> field, and it was in the actualities of war that I acquired my <lb/> training and
      my right to speak. I served two weeks in the <lb/> beginning of our Civil War, and during all
      that time <reg orig="com-|manded">commanded</reg>
      <lb/>
      <pb n="680" entity="DSSR_000002496_0695"/> a battery of infantry composed of twelve men. <lb/>
      General Grant knew the history of my campaign, for I told it <lb/> him. I also told him the
      principle upon which I had <reg orig="con-|ducted">conducted</reg>
      <lb/> it; which was, to tire the enemy. I tired out and <reg orig="dis-|qualified"
       >disqualified</reg>
      <lb/> many battalions, yet never had a casualty myself nor <lb/> lost a man. General Grant was
      not given to paying <reg orig="compli-|ments">compliments</reg>, <lb/> yet he said frankly
      that if I had conducted the whole <lb/> war much bloodshed would have been spared, and that
      what <lb/> the army might have lost through the inspiriting results of <lb/> collision in the
      field would have been amply made up by the <lb/> liberalizing influences of travel. Further
      endorsement does <lb/> not seem to me to be necessary.</p>
     <p>Let us now examine history, and see what it teaches. In <lb/> the 4 battles fought in 1881
      and the two fought by Jameson, <lb/> the British loss in killed, wounded, and prisoners, was
       <reg orig="substan-|tially">substantially</reg>
      <lb/> 1,300 men; the Boer loss, as far as is ascertainable, was <lb/> about 30 men. These
      figures show that there was a defect <lb/> somewhere. It was not in the absence of courage. I
      think it <lb/> lay in the absence of discretion. The Briton should have done <lb/> one thing
      or the other: discarded British methods and fought <lb/> the Boer with Boer methods, or
      augmented his own force until <lb/> &mdash;using British methods&mdash;it should be
      large enough to <reg orig="equal-|ize">equalize</reg>
      <lb/> results with the Boer.</p>
     <p>To retain the British method requires certain things, <reg orig="deter-|minable"
       >determinable</reg>
      <lb/> by arithmetic. If, for argument's sake, we allow that <lb/> the aggregate of 1,716
      British soldiers engaged in the 4 early <lb/> battles was opposed by the same aggregate of
      Boers, we have <lb/> this result: the British loss of 700 and the Boer loss of 23 <lb/> argues
      that in order to equalize results in future battles you <lb/> must make the British force
      thirty times as strong as the Boer <lb/> force. Mr. Garrett shows that the Boer force
      immediately <reg orig="op-|posed">opposed</reg>
      <lb/> to Jameson was 2,000, and that there were 6,000 more <lb/> on hand by the evening of the
      second day. Arithmetic shows <lb/>
      <pb entity="DSSR_000002496_0696"/>

      8,000 Boers, <lb/> Jameson should have had 240,000 men, whereas he merely had <lb/> 530 boys.
      From a military point of view, backed by the facts <lb/> of history, I conceive that Jameson's
      military judgment was at <lb/> fault.</p>
     <p>Another thing. Jameson was encumbered by artillery, <lb/> ammunition, and rifles. The facts
      of the battle show that he <lb/> should have had none of those things along. They were heavy,
      <lb/> they were in his way, they impeded his march. There was <lb/> nothing to shoot at but
      rocks&mdash;he knew quite well that there <lb/> would be nothing to shoot at but
      rocks&mdash;and he knew that <lb/> artillery and rifles have no effect upon rocks. He was
      badly <lb/> overloaded with unessentials. He had 8 Maxims&mdash;a Maxim <lb/> is a kind
      of Gatling, I believe, and shoots about 500 bullets <lb/> per minute; he had one
      12&frac12;-pounder cannon and two 7-<reg orig="pound-|ers">pounders</reg>; <lb/> also,
      145,000 rounds of ammunition. He worked the <lb/> Maxims so hard upon the rocks that five of
      them became <reg orig="dis-|abled&mdash;five">disabled&mdash;five</reg>
      <lb/> of the Maxims, not the rocks. It is believed that <lb/> upwards of 100,000 rounds of
      ammunition of the various kinds <lb/> were fired during the 21 hours that the battles lasted.
       <hi rend="italic">One <lb/> man killed</hi>. He must have been much mutilated. It was a <lb/>
      pity to bring those futile Maxims along. Jameson should have <lb/> furnished himself with a
      battery of pudd'nhead Wilson <reg orig="max-|ims">maxims</reg>
      <lb/> instead. They are much more deadly than those others, <lb/> and they are easily carried,
      because they have no weight.</p>

      <lb/> the presence of the Maxims by saying that they were of <lb/> very substantial use
      because their sputtering disordered the <lb/> aim of the Boers, and in that way saved lives.</p>
     <p>Three cannon, eight Maxims, and five hundred rifles yielded <lb/> a result which emphasized

     <p>If I could get the management of one of those campaigns, <lb/> I would know what to do, for
      I have studied the Boer. He <lb/> values the Bible above every other thing. The most delicious
      <lb/> edible in South Africa is "biltong." You will have seen it <lb/> mentioned in Olive
      Schreiner's books. It is what our <reg orig="plains-|men">plainsmen</reg>
      <lb/>
      <pb n="685" entity="DSSR_000002496_0700"/> call "jerked beef." It is the Boer's main standby.
      He <lb/> has a passion for it, and he is right.</p>
     <p>If I had the command of the campaign I would go with <lb/> rifles only, no cumbersome Maxims
      and cannon to spoil good <lb/> rocks with. I would move surreptitiously by night to a point
      <lb/> about a quarter of a mile from the Boer camp, and there I <lb/> would build up a pyramid
      of biltong and Bibles fifty feet high, <lb/> and then conceal my men all about. In the morning
      the <lb/> Boers would send out spies, and then the rest would come with <lb/> a rush. I would
      surround them, and they would have to fight <lb/> my men on equal terms, in the open. There
      wouldn't be any <lb/> Amajuba results.<ref target="n685.1" n="21">*</ref>

       <p>Just as I am finishing this book an unfortunate dispute has sprung up between <lb/> Dr.
        Jameson and his officers, on the one hand, and Colonel Rhodes on the other, <lb/> concerning
        the wording of a note which Colonel Rhodes sent from Johannesburg by <lb/> a cyclist to
        Jameson just before hostilities began on the memorable New Year's Day. <lb/> Some of the
        fragments of this note were found on the battlefield after the fight, and <lb/> these have
        been pieced together; the dispute is as to what words the lacking <reg orig="frag-|ments"
         >fragments</reg>
        <lb/> contained. Jameson says the note promised him a reinforcement of 300 men <lb/> from
        Johannesburg. Colonel Rhodes denies this, and says he merely promised to <lb/> send out
        "some" men "to meet you." <lb/> It seems a pity that these friends should fall out over so
        little a thing. If the <lb/> 300 had been sent, what good would it have done? In 21 hours of
        industrious <reg orig="fight-|ing">fighting</reg>, <lb/> Jameson's 530 men, with 8 Maxims, 3
        cannon, and 145,000 rounds of ammunition, <lb/> killed an aggregate of 1 Boer. These
        statistics show that a reinforcement of 300 <lb/> Johannesburgers, armed merely with
        muskets, would have killed, at the outside, <lb/> only a little over a half of another Boer.
        This would not have saved the day. It <lb/> would not even have seriously affected the
        general result. The figures show clearly, <lb/> and with mathematical violence, that the
        only way to save Jameson, or even give <lb/> him a fair and equal chance with the enemy, was
        for Johannesburg to send him 240 <lb/> Maxims, 90 cannon, 600 carloads of ammunition, and
        240,000 men. Johannesburg <lb/> was not in a position to do this. Johannesburg has been
        called very hard names for <lb/> not reinforcing Jameson. But in every instance this has
        been done by two classes of <lb/> persons&mdash;people who do not read history, and
        people, like Jameson, who do not <lb/> understand what it means, after they have read
       it.</p>

       </bibl></p>
     </argument>
     <p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> Duke of Fife has borne testimony that Mr. Rhodes <lb/>
      deceived him. That is also what Mr. Rhodes did with <lb/> the Reformers. He got them into
      trouble, and then <lb/> stayed out himself. A judicious man. He has always been <lb/> that. As
      to this there was a moment of doubt, once. It was <lb/> when he was out on his last pirating
      expedition in the <reg orig="Mata-|bele">Matabele</reg>
      <lb/> country. The cable shouted out that he had gone <reg orig="un-|armed">unarmed</reg>,
      <lb/> to visit a party of hostile chiefs. It was true, too; and <lb/> this dare-devil thing
      came near fetching another indiscretion <lb/> out of the poet laureate. It would have been too
      bad, for when <lb/> the facts were all in, it turned out that there was a lady along, <lb/>
      too, and she also was unarmed.</p>
     <p>In the opinion of many people Mr. Rhodes is South Africa; <lb/> others think he is only a
      large part of it. These latter consider <lb/> that South Africa consists of Table Mountain,
      the diamond <lb/> mines, the Johannesburg gold fields, and Cecil Rhodes. The <lb/> gold fields
      are wonderful in every way. In seven or eight <lb/> years they built up, in a desert, a city
      of a hundred thousand <lb/> inhabitants, counting white and black together; and not the <lb/>
      ordinary mining city of wooden shanties, but a city made out <lb/> of lasting material.
      Nowhere in the world is there such a <reg orig="con-|centration">concentration</reg>
      <lb/> of rich mines as at Johannesburg. Mr. Bonamici, <lb/> my manager there, gave me a small
      gold brick with some <reg orig="sta-|tistics">statistics</reg>
      <lb/> engraved upon it which record the output of gold from <lb/> the early days to July,
      1895, and exhibit the strides which have <lb/>
      <pb n="687" entity="DSSR_000002496_0702"/> been made in the development of the industry; in
      1888 the <lb/> output was $4,162,440; the output of the next five and a half <lb/> years was
      (total) $17,585,894; for the single year ending with <lb/> June, 1895, it
      was $45,553,700.</p>
     <p>The capital which has developed the mines came from <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg>,
      <lb/> the mining engineers from America. This is the case <lb/> with the diamond mines also.
      South Africa seems to be the <lb/> heaven of the American scientific mining engineer. He gets
      <lb/> the choicest places, and keeps them. His salary is not based <lb/> upon what he would
      get in America, but apparently upon what <lb/> a whole family of him would get there.</p>
     <p>The successful mines pay great dividends, yet the rock is <lb/> not rich, from a Californian
      point of view. Rock which yields <lb/> ten or twelve dollars a ton is considered plenty rich
      enough. <lb/> It is troubled with base metals to such a degree that twenty <lb/> years ago it
      would have been only about half as valuable as <lb/> it is now; for at that time there was no
      paying way of getting <lb/> anything out of such rock but the coarser-grained "free" gold;
      <lb/> but the new cyanide process has changed all that, and the gold <lb/> fields of the world
      now deliver up fifty million dollars' worth <lb/> of gold per year which would have gone into
      the tailing-pile <lb/> under the former conditions.</p>
     <p>The cyanide process was new to me, and full of interest; <lb/> and among the costly and
      elaborate mining machinery there <lb/> were fine things which were new to me, but I was
      already <reg orig="fa-|miliar">familiar</reg>
      <lb/> with the rest of the details of the gold-mining industry. <lb/> I had been a gold miner
      myself, in my day, and knew <reg orig="substan-|tially">substantially</reg>
      <lb/> everything that those people knew about it, except how <lb/> to make money at it. But I
      learned a good deal about the <lb/> Boers there, and that was a fresh subject. What I heard
      there <lb/> was afterwards repeated to me in other parts of South Africa. <lb/> Summed
      up&mdash;according to the information thus gained&mdash;this <lb/> is the Boer:</p>
     <pb n="688" entity="DSSR_000002496_0703"/>
     <p>He is deeply religious, profoundly ignorant, dull, obstinate, <lb/> bigoted, uncleanly in
      his habits, hospitable, honest in his <reg orig="deal-|ings">dealings</reg>
      <lb/> with the whites, a hard master to his black servant, lazy, <lb/> a good shot, good
      horseman, addicted to the chase, a lover of <lb/> political independence, a good husband and
      father, not fond of <lb/> herding together in towns, but liking the seclusion and <reg
       orig="remote-|ness">remoteness</reg>
      <lb/> and solitude and empty vastness and silence of the veldt; <lb/> a man of a mighty
      appetite, and not delicate about what he <lb/> appeases it with&mdash;well-satisfied with
      pork and Indian corn <lb/> and biltong, requiring only that the quantity shall not be <lb/>
      stinted; willing to ride a long journey to take a hand in a <lb/> rude all-night dance
      interspersed with vigorous feeding and <lb/> boisterous jollity, but ready to ride twice as
      far for a <reg orig="prayer-|meeting">prayer-meeting</reg>; <lb/> proud of his Dutch and
      Huguenot origin and its <lb/> religious and military history; proud of his race's <reg
       orig="achieve-|ments">achievements</reg>
      <lb/> in South Africa, its bold plunges into hostile and <reg orig="un-|charted">uncharted</reg>
      <lb/> deserts in search of free solitudes unvexed by the <lb/> pestering and detested English,
      also its victories over the <lb/> natives and the British; proudest of all, of the direct and
       <reg orig="effu-|sive">effusive</reg>
      <lb/> personal interest which the Deity has always taken in its <lb/> affairs. He cannot read,
      he cannot write; he has one or two <lb/> newspapers, but he is, apparently, not aware of it;
      until <reg orig="lat-|terly">latterly</reg>
      <lb/> he had no schools, and taught his children nothing; news <lb/> is a term which has no
      meaning to him, and the thing itself he <lb/> cares nothing about. He hates to be taxed and
      resents it. <lb/> He has stood stock still in South Africa for two centuries and <lb/> a half,
      and would like to stand still till the end of time, for he <lb/> has no sympathy with
      Uitlander notions of progress. He is <lb/> hungry to be rich, for he is human; but his
      preference has <lb/> been for riches in cattle, not in fine clothes and fine houses <lb/> and
      gold and diamonds. The gold and the diamonds have <lb/> brought the godless stranger within
      his gates, also <reg orig="contamina-|tion">contamination</reg>
      <lb/>
      <pb n="689" entity="DSSR_000002496_0704"/> and broken repose, and he wishes that they had
      never <lb/> been discovered.</p>
     <p>I think that the bulk of those details can be found in <lb/> Olive Schreiner's books, and
      she would not be accused of <lb/> sketching the Boer's portrait with an unfair hand.</p>
     <p>Now what would you expect from that unpromising <reg orig="mate-|rial">material</reg>? <lb/>
      What ought you to expect from it? Laws inimical to <lb/> religious liberty? Yes. Laws denying
      representation and <lb/> suffrage to the intruder? Yes. Laws unfriendly to <reg
       orig="educa-|tional">educational</reg>
      <lb/> institutions? Yes. Laws obstructive of gold production? <lb/> Yes. Discouragement of
      railway expansion? Yes. Laws <lb/> heavily taxing the intruder and overlooking the Boer? Yes.</p>
     <p>The Uitlander seems to have expected something very <lb/> different from all that. I do not
      know why. Nothing <reg orig="differ-|ent">different</reg>
      <lb/> from it was rationally to be expected. A round man <lb/> cannot be expected to fit a
      square hole right away. He must <lb/> have time to modify his shape. The modification had
      begun <lb/> in a detail or two, before the Raid, and was making some <lb/> progress. It has
      made further progress since. There are <lb/> wise men in the Boer government, and that
      accounts for the <lb/> modification; the modification of the Boer mass has probably <lb/> not
      begun yet. If the heads of the Boer government had not <lb/> been wise men they would have
      hanged Jameson, and thus <lb/> turned a very commonplace pirate into a holy martyr. But <lb/>
      even their wisdom has its limits, and they will hang Mr. <lb/> Rhodes if they ever catch him.
      That will round him and <lb/> complete him and make him a saint. He has already been <lb/>
      called by all other titles that symbolize human grandeur, and <lb/> he ought to rise to this
      one, the grandest of all. It will be a <lb/> dizzy jump from where he is now, but that is
      nothing, it will <lb/> land him in good company and be a pleasant change for him.</p>
     <p>Some of the things demanded by the Johannesburgers' <lb/>
      <pb n="690" entity="DSSR_000002496_0705"/> Manifesto have been conceded since the days of the
      Raid, and <lb/> the others will follow in time, no doubt. It was most fortunate <lb/> for the
      miners of Johannesburg that the taxes which distressed <lb/> them so much were levied by the
      Boer government, instead of <lb/> by their friend Rhodes and his Chartered Company of <reg
       orig="high-|waymen">highwaymen</reg>, <lb/> for these latter take <hi rend="italic">half</hi>
      of whatever their mining <lb/> victims find, they do not stop at a mere percentage. If the
      <lb/> Johannesburg miners were under their jurisdiction they would <lb/> be in the poorhouse
      in twelve-months.</p>
     <p>I have been under the impression all along that I had an <lb/> unpleasant paragraph about
      the Boers somewhere in my <reg orig="note-|book">notebook</reg>, <lb/> and also a pleasant
      one. I have found them now. The <lb/> unpleasant one is dated at an interior village, and
      says: <lb/>
      <q>"Mr. Z. called. He is an English Afrikander; is an old resident, and has <lb/> a Boer wife.
       He speaks the language, and his professional business is with <lb/> the Boers exclusively. He
       told me that the ancient Boer families in the great <lb/> region of which this village is the
       commercial center are falling victims to <lb/> their inherited indolence and dullness in the
       materialistic latter-day race and <lb/> struggle, and are dropping one by one into the grip
       of the usurer&mdash;getting <lb/> hopelessly in debt&mdash;and are losing their
       high place and retiring to second and <lb/> lower. The Boer's farm does not go to another
       Boer when he loses it, but to <lb/> a foreigner. Some have fallen so low that they sell their
       daughters to the <lb/> blacks."</q></p>
     <p>Under date of another South African town I find the note <lb/> which is creditable to the
      Boers: <lb/>
      <q>"Dr. X. told me that in the Kafir war 1,500 Kafirs took refuge in a great <lb/> cave in the
       mountains about 90 miles north of Johannesburg, and the Boers <lb/> blocked up the entrance
       and smoked them to death. Dr. X. has been in there <lb/> and seen the great array of bleached
       skeletons&mdash;one a woman with the <reg orig="skele-|ton">skeleton</reg>
       <lb/> of a child hugged to her breast."</q></p>
     <p>The great bulk of the savages must go. The white man <lb/> wants their lands, and all must
      go excepting such percentage <lb/> of them as he will need to do his work for him upon terms
      to <lb/> be determined by himself. Since history has removed the <lb/> element of guesswork
      from this matter and made it certainty, <lb/> the humanest way of diminishing the black
      population should <lb/> be adopted, not the old cruel ways of the past. Mr. Rhodes <lb/>
      <pb n="691" entity="DSSR_000002496_0706"/> and his gang have been following the old ways. They
      are <lb/> chartered to rob and slay, and they lawfully do it, but not in a <lb/> compassionate
      and Christian spirit. They rob the Mashonas <lb/> and the Matabeles of a portion of their
      territories in the <lb/> hallowed old style of "purchase" for a song, and then they <lb/>
      force a quarrel and take the rest by the strong hand. They <lb/> rob the natives of their
      cattle under the pretext that all the <lb/> cattle in the country belonged to the king whom
      they have <lb/> tricked and assassinated. They issue "regulations" requiring <lb/> the
      incensed and harassed natives to work for the white <reg orig="set-|tlers">settlers</reg>,
      <lb/> and neglect their own affairs to do it. This is slavery, <lb/> and is several times
      worse than was the American slavery <lb/> which used to pain England so much; for when this
      Rhodesian <lb/> slave is sick, superannuated, or otherwise disabled, he must <lb/> support
      himself or starve&mdash;his master is under no obligation <lb/> to support him.</p>
     <p>The reduction of the population by Rhodesian methods to <lb/> the desired limit is a return
      to the old-time slow-misery and <lb/> lingering-death system of a discredited time and a crude
       "<reg orig="civ-|ilization">civilization</reg>." <lb/> We humanely reduce an overplus of dogs
      by swift <lb/> chloroform; the Boer humanely reduced an overplus of blacks <lb/> by swift
      suffocation; the nameless but right-hearted Australian <lb/> pioneer humanely reduced his
      overplus of aboriginal neighbors <lb/> by a sweetened swift death concealed in a poisoned
      pudding. <lb/> All these are admirable, and worthy of praise; you and I <lb/> would rather
      suffer either of these deaths thirty times over in <lb/> thirty successive days than linger
      out one of the Rhodesian <lb/> twenty-year deaths, with its daily burden of insult, <reg
       orig="humilia-|tion">humiliation</reg>, <lb/> and forced labor for a man whose entire race
      the victim <lb/> hates. Rhodesia is a happy name for that land of piracy and <lb/> pillage,
      and puts the right stain upon it.</p>
     <p>Several long journeys gave us experience of the Cape <lb/> Colony railways; easy-riding,
      fine cars; all the conveniences; <lb/>
      <pb n="692" entity="DSSR_000002496_0707"/> thorough cleanliness; comfortable beds furnished
      for the night <lb/> trains. It was in the first days of June, and winter; the <reg
       orig="day-|time">daytime</reg>
      <lb/> was pleasant, the nighttime nice and cold. Spinning <lb/> along all day in the cars it
      was ecstasy to breathe the bracing <lb/> air and gaze out over the vast brown solitudes of the
      velvet <lb/> plains, soft and lovely near by, still softer and lovelier further <lb/> away,
      softest and loveliest of all in the remote distances, <lb/> where dim island-hills seemed
      afloat, as in a sea&mdash;a sea made <lb/> of dream-stuff and flushed with colors faint
      and rich; and <lb/> dear me, the depth of the sky, and the beauty of the strange <lb/> new
      cloud-forms, and the glory of the sunshine, the lavishness, <lb/> the wastefulness of it! The
      vigor and freshness and <reg orig="inspira-|tion">inspiration</reg>
      <lb/> of the air and the sun&mdash;well, it was all just as Olive <lb/> Schreiner had
      made it in her books.</p>
     <p>To me the veldt, in its sober winter garb, was surpassingly <lb/> beautiful. There were
      unlevel stretches where it was rolling <lb/> and swelling, and rising and subsiding, and
      sweeping superbly <lb/> on and on, and still on and on like an ocean, toward the <reg
       orig="far-|away">faraway</reg>
      <lb/> horizon, its pale brown deepening by delicately <reg orig="gradu-|ated">graduated</reg>
      <lb/> shades to rich orange, and finally to purple and crimson <lb/> where it washed against
      the wooded hills and naked red crags <lb/> at the base of the sky.</p>
     <p>Everywhere, from Cape Town to Kimberley, and from <lb/> Kimberley to Port Elizabeth and East
      London, the towns were <lb/> well populated with tamed blacks; tamed and Christianized too,
      <lb/> I suppose, for they wore the dowdy clothes of our Christian <lb/> civilization. But for
      that, many of them would have been <reg orig="re-|markably">remarkably</reg>
      <lb/> handsome. These fiendish clothes, together with <lb/> the proper lounging gait,
      good-natured face, happy air, and <lb/> easy laugh, made them precise counterparts of our
      American <lb/> blacks; often where all the other aspects were strikingly and <lb/>
      harmoniously and thrillingly African, a flock of these natives <lb/> would intrude, looking
      wholly out of place, and spoil it all, <lb/>
      <pb n="693" entity="DSSR_000002496_0708"/> making the thing a grating discord, half African
      and half <lb/> American.</p>

      <p>OLD ACQUAINTANCES.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>One Sunday in King William's Town a score of colored <lb/> women came mincing across the
      great barren square dressed <lb/> &mdash;oh, in the last perfection of fashion, and
      newness, and <reg orig="ex-|pensiveness">expensiveness</reg>, <lb/> and showy mixture of
      unrelated colors,&mdash;all just <lb/> as I had seen it so <lb/> often at home; and <lb/>
      in their faces and <lb/> their gait was that <lb/> languishing, <reg orig="aristo-|cratic"
       >aristocratic</reg>, <lb/> divine delight <lb/> in their finery which <lb/> was so familiar
      to me, <lb/> and had always been <lb/> such a satisfaction to <lb/> my eye and my heart. <lb/>
      I seemed among old, <lb/> old friends; friends <lb/> of fifty years, and I <lb/> stopped and
      cordially <lb/> greeted them. They <lb/> broke into a good-<reg orig="fel-|lowship">fellowship</reg>
      <lb/> laugh, <reg orig="flash-|ing">flashing</reg>
      <lb/> their white teeth <lb/> upon me, and all <lb/> answered at once. I <lb/> did not
      understand a word they said. I was astonished; I <lb/> was not dreaming that they would answer
      in anything <lb/> but American.</p>
     <p>The voices, too, of the African women, were familiar to me <lb/> &mdash;sweet and
      musical, just like those of the slave women of my <lb/> early days. I followed a couple of
      them all over the Orange <lb/>
      <pb n="694" entity="DSSR_000002496_0709"/> Free State&mdash;no, over its
      capital&mdash;Bloemfontein, to hear their <lb/> liquid voices and the happy ripple of
      their laughter. Their <lb/> language was a large improvement upon American. Also upon <lb/>
      the Zulu. It had no Zulu clicks in it; and it seemed to have <lb/> no angles or corners, no
      roughness, no vile <hi rend="italic">s's</hi> or other hissing <lb/> sounds, but was very,
      very mellow and rounded and flowing.</p>
     <p>In moving about the country in the trains, I had <reg orig="opportu-|nity">opportunity</reg>
      <lb/> to see a good many Boers of the veldt. One day at a village <lb/> station a hundred of
      them got out of the third-class cars to feed. <lb/> Their clothes were <lb/> very interesting.
      For <lb/> ugliness of shapes, and <lb/> for miracles of ugly <lb/> colors inharmoniously <lb/>
      associated, they were <lb/> a record.</p>

      could to turn public sentiment against me. <lb/> It is what one gets for trying to do good.</p>
     <p>In the train that day a passenger told me some more about <lb/> Boer life out in the lonely
      veldt. He said the Boer gets up <lb/> early and sets his "niggers" at their tasks
      (pasturing the cattle, <lb/> and watching them);eats, smokes, drowses,
      sleeps; toward <lb/> evening superintends the milking, etc.; eats, smokes, drowses; <lb/> goes
      to bed at early candlelight in the fragrant clothes he <lb/> (and she) have
      worn all day and every week-day for years. I <lb/> remember that last detail, in Olive
      Schreiner's "Story of an <lb/> African Farm." And the passenger told me that the Boers <lb/>
      were justly noted for their hospitality. He told me a story <lb/> about it. He said that his
      grace the Bishop of a certain See <lb/> was once making a business-progress through the
      tavernless <lb/> veldt, and one night he stopped with a Boer; after supper was <lb/> shown to
      bed; he undressed, weary and worn out, and was <lb/> soon sound asleep; in the night he woke
      up feeling crowded <lb/> and suffocated, and found the old Boer and his fat wife in bed <lb/>
      with him, one on each side, with all their clothes on, and <reg orig="snor-|ing"
      >snoring</reg>. <lb/> He had to stay there and stand it&mdash;awake and suffering <lb/>
      &mdash;until toward dawn, when sleep again fell upon him for an <lb/> hour. Then he woke
      again. The Boer was gone, but the wife <lb/> was still at his side.</p>
     <p>Those Reformers detested that Boer prison; they were not <lb/> used to cramped quarters and
      tedious hours, and weary <reg orig="idle-|ness">idleness</reg>, <lb/> and early to bed, and
      limited movement, and arbitrary <lb/>
      <pb n="698" entity="DSSR_000002496_0713"/> and irritating rules, and the absence of the
      luxuries which <lb/> wealth comforts the day and the night with. The <reg orig="confine-|ment"

      <lb/> told upon their bodies and their spirits; still, they were <lb/> superior men, and they
      made the best that was to be made <lb/> of the circumstances. Their wives smuggled delicacies
      to them, <lb/> which helped to smooth the way down for the prison fare.</p>
     <p>In the train Mr. B. told me that the Boer jail-guards <lb/> treated the black
      prisoners&mdash;even political ones&mdash;mercilessly. <lb/> An African chief and
      his following had been kept there nine <lb/> months without trial, and during all that time
      they had been <lb/> without shelter from rain and sun. He said that one day the <lb/> guards
      put a big black in the stocks for dashing his soup on <lb/> the ground; they stretched his
      legs painfully wide apart, and <lb/> set him with his back down hill; he could not endure it,
      and <lb/> put back his hands upon the slope for a support. The guard <lb/> ordered him to
      withdraw the support&mdash;and kicked him in the <lb/> back. "Then," said Mr. B., "the
      powerful black wrenched <lb/> the stocks asunder and went for the guard; a Reform prisoner
      <lb/> pulled him off, and thrashed the guard himself."</p>

       orig="convul-|sion">convulsion</reg>
      <lb/> of nature in South Africa was the <reg orig="diamond-|crater">diamond-crater</reg>.
      <lb/> The Rand gold fields are a stupendous <lb/> marvel, and they make all other gold fields
      small, but I was <lb/> not a stranger to gold-mining; the veldt was a noble thing to <lb/>
      see, but it was only another and lovelier variety of our Great <lb/> Plains; the natives were
      very far from being uninteresting, <lb/> but they were not new; and as for the towns, I could
      find my <lb/> way without a guide through the most of them because I had <lb/> learned the
      streets, under other names, in towns just like them <lb/> in other lands; but the diamond mine
      was a wholly fresh <lb/> thing, a splendid and absorbing novelty. Very few people in <lb/> the
      world have seen the diamond in its home. It has but <lb/> three or four homes in the world,
      whereas gold has a million. <lb/> It is worth while to journey around the globe to see
      anything <lb/> which can truthfully be called a novelty, and the diamond <lb/> mine is the
      greatest and most select and restricted novelty <lb/> which the globe has in stock.</p>
     <p>The Kimberley diamond deposits were discovered about <lb/> 1869, I think. When everything is
      taken into consideration, <lb/> the wonder is that they were not discovered five thousand
      <lb/> years ago and made familiar to the African world for the rest <lb/> of time. For this
      reason the first diamonds were found on the <lb/> surface of the ground. They were smooth and
      limpid, and in <lb/>
      <pb n="700" entity="DSSR_000002496_0715"/> the sunlight they vomited fire. They were the very
      things <lb/> which an African savage of any era would value above every <lb/> other thing in
      the world excepting a glass bead. For two or <lb/> three centuries we have been buying his
      lands, his cattle, his <lb/> neighbor, and any other thing he had for sale, for glass beads:
      <lb/> and so it is strange that he was indifferent to the diamonds <lb/> &mdash;for he
      must have picked them up many and many a time. <lb/> It would not occur to him to try to sell
      them to whites, of <lb/> course, since the whites already had plenty of glass beads, and <lb/>
      more fashionably shaped, too, than these; but one would think <lb/> that the poorer sort of
      black, who could not afford real glass, <lb/> would have been humbly content to decorate
      himself with the <lb/> imitation, and that presently the white trader would notice the <lb/>
      things, and dimly suspect, and carry some of them home, and <lb/> find out what they were, and
      at once empty a multitude of <lb/> fortune-hunters into Africa. There are many strange things
      in <lb/> human history; one of the strangest is that the sparkling <reg orig="dia-|monds"
       >diamonds</reg>
      <lb/> laid there so long without exciting any one's interest.</p>
     <p>The revelation came at last by accident. In a Boer's hut <lb/> out in the wide solitude of
      the plains, a traveling stranger <lb/> noticed a child playing with a bright object, and was
      told it <lb/> was a piece of glass which had been found in the veldt. The <lb/> stranger
      bought it for a trifle and carried it away; and being <lb/> without honor, made another
      stranger believe it was a diamond, <lb/> and so got $125 out of him for it, and was as pleased
      with <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>
      <lb/> as if he had done a righteous thing. In Paris the wronged <lb/> stranger sold it to a
      pawnshop for $10,000, who sold it to a <lb/> countess for $90,000, who sold it to a brewer for
      $800,000, who <lb/> traded it to a king for a dukedom and a pedigree, and the king <lb/> "put
      it up the spout."<ref target="n700.1" n="22">&dagger;</ref>

     <p>The news flew around, and the South African <reg orig="diamond-|boom">diamond-boom</reg>
      <lb/> began. The original traveler&mdash;the dishonest one&mdash;now <lb/>
      remembered that he had once seen a Boer teamster chocking <lb/> his wagon-wheel on a steep
      grade with a diamond as large as <lb/> a football, and he laid aside his occupations and
      started out to <lb/> hunt for it, but not with the intention of cheating anybody out <lb/> of
      $125 with it, for he had reformed.</p>
     <p>We now come to matters more didactic. Diamonds are <lb/> not imbedded in rock ledges fifty
      miles long, like the <reg orig="Johannes-|burg">Johannesburg</reg>
      <lb/> gold, but are distributed through the rubbish of a <reg orig="filled-|up">filled-up</reg>
      <lb/> well, so to speak. The well is rich, its walls are sharply <lb/> defined; outside of the
      walls are no diamonds. The well is a <lb/> crater, and a large one. Before it had been meddled
      with, its <lb/> surface was even with the level plain, and there was no sign to <lb/> suggest
      that it was there. The pasturage covering the surface <lb/> of the Kimberley crater was
      sufficient for the support of a cow, <lb/> and the pasturage underneath was sufficient for the
      support of <lb/> a kingdom; but the cow did not know it, and lost her chance.</p>
     <p>The Kimberley crater is roomy enough to admit the Roman <lb/> Coliseum; the bottom of the
      crater has not been reached, and <lb/> no one can tell how far down in the bowels of the earth
      it <lb/> goes. Originally, it was a perpendicular hole packed solidly <lb/> full of blue rock
      or cement, and scattered through that blue <lb/> mass, like raisins in a pudding, were the
      diamonds. As deep <lb/> down in the earth as the blue stuff extends, so deep will the <lb/>
      diamonds be found.</p>
     <p>There are three or four other celebrated craters near by&mdash; <lb/> a circle three
      miles in diameter would enclose them all. They <lb/> are owned by the De Beers Company, a
      consolidation of <reg orig="dia-|mond">diamond</reg>
      <lb/> properties arranged by Mr. Rhodes twelve or fourteen <lb/> years ago. The De Beers owns
      other craters; they are under <lb/> the grass, but the De Beers knows where they are, and will
      <lb/> open them some day, if the market should require it.</p>
     <pb n="702" entity="DSSR_000002496_0717"/>
     <p>Originally, the diamond deposits were the property of the <lb/> Orange Free State; but a
      judicious "rectification" of the <lb/> boundary line shifted them over into the British
      territory of <lb/> Cape Colony. A high official of the Free State told me that <lb/> the sum
      of $400,000 was handed to his commonwealth as a <lb/> compromise, or indemnity, or something
      of the sort, and that <lb/> he thought his commonwealth did wisely to take the money <lb/> and
      keep out of a dispute, since the power was all on the one <lb/> side and the weakness all on
      the other. The De Beers <reg orig="Com-|pany">Company</reg>
      <lb/> dig out $400,000 worth of diamonds per week, now. The <lb/> Cape got the territory, but
      no profit; for Mr. Rhodes and the <lb/> Rothschilds and the other De Beers people own the
      mines, and <lb/> they pay no taxes.</p>

      <p>SEARCHING FOR GEMS.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>In our day the mines are worked upon scientific principles, <reg orig="un-|der">under</reg>
      <lb/> the guidance of the ablest <lb/> mining-engineering talent <lb/> procurable in America.
      There <lb/> are elaborate works for <reg orig="re-|ducing">reducing</reg>
      <lb/> the blue rock and <lb/> passing it through one <reg orig="pro-|cess">process</reg>
      <lb/> after another until every <lb/> diamond it contains has been <lb/> hunted down and
      secured. I <lb/> watched the "concentrators" <lb/> at work&mdash;big tanks <reg
       orig="contain-|ing">containing</reg>
      <lb/> mud and water and <reg orig="in-|visible">invisible</reg>
      <lb/> diamonds&mdash;and was <lb/> told that each could stir and <lb/> churn and properly
      treat 300 <lb/> car-loads of mud per day&mdash; <lb/> 1,600 pounds to the car-load <lb/>
      &mdash;and reduce it to 3 car-loads of slush. I saw the 3 <reg orig="car-|loads">carloads</reg>
      <lb/> of slush taken to the "pulsators" and there reduced to a <lb/>
      <pb n="703" entity="DSSR_000002496_0718"/> quarter of a load of nice clean dark-colored sand.
      Then I <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg>
      <lb/> it to the sorting tables and saw the men deftly and swiftly <lb/> spread it out and
      brush it about and seize the diamonds as they <lb/> showed up. I assisted, and once I found a
      diamond half as large <lb/> as an almond. It is an exciting kind of fishing, and you feel a
      <lb/> fine thrill of pleasure every time you detect the glow of one of <lb/> those limpid
      pebbles through the veil of dark sand. I would <lb/> like to spend my Saturday holidays in
      that charming sport <lb/> every now and then. Of course there are disappointments. <lb/>
      Sometimes you find a diamond which is not a diamond; it is <lb/> only a quartz crystal or some
      such worthless thing. The <reg orig="ex-|pert">expert</reg>
      <lb/> can generally distinguish it from the precious stone which <lb/> it is counterfeiting;
      but if he is in doubt he lays it on a flatiron <lb/> and hits it with a sledge-hammer. If it
      is a diamond it holds <lb/> its own; if it is anything else, it is reduced to powder. I liked
      <lb/> that experiment very much, and did not tire of repetitions of <lb/> it. It was full of
      enjoyable apprehensions, unmarred by any <lb/> personal sense of risk. The De Beers concern
      treats 8,000 <reg orig="car-|loads&mdash;about">carloads&mdash;about</reg>
      <lb/> 6,000 tons&mdash;of blue rock per day, and the result <lb/> is three pounds of
      diamonds. Value, uncut, $50,000 to $70,000. <lb/> After cutting, they will weigh considerably
      less than a pound, <lb/> but will be worth four or five times as much as they were before.</p>
     <p>All the plain around that region is spread over, a foot deep, <lb/> with blue rock, placed
      there by the Company, and looks like <lb/> a plowed field. Exposure for a length of time make
      the rock <lb/> easier to work than it is when it comes out of the mine. If <lb/> mining should
      cease now, the supply of rock spread over those <lb/> fields would furnish the usual 8,000
      car-loads per day to the <lb/> separating works during three years. The fields are fenced
      <lb/> and watched; and at night they are under the constant <reg orig="inspec-|tion"
       >inspection</reg>
      <lb/> of lofty electric searchlight. They contain fifty or sixty <lb/> million dollars' worth
      of diamonds, and there is an abundance <lb/> of enterprising thieves around.</p>
     <pb n="704" entity="DSSR_000002496_0719"/>
     <p>In the dirt of the Kimberley streets there is much hidden <lb/> wealth. Some time ago the
      people were granted the privilege <lb/> of a free wash-up. There was a general rush, the work
      was <lb/> done with thoroughness, and a good harvest of diamonds was <lb/> gathered.</p>

      <p>INSIDE OF COMPOUND WITH NET COVERING TO PREVENT THOWING GEMS <lb/> OUT OF THE CRATER.</p>
     </figure>
     <p>The deep mining is done by natives. There are many <reg orig="hun-|dreds">hundreds</reg>
      <lb/> of them. They live in quarters built around the inside <lb/> of a great compound. They
      are a jolly and good-natured lot, <lb/> and accommodating. They performed a war-dance for us,
      <lb/> which was the wildest exhibition I have ever seen. They are <lb/> not allowed outside of
      the compound during their term of <reg orig="ser-|vice&mdash;three"
       >service&mdash;three</reg>
      <lb/> months, I think it is, as a rule. They go down <lb/> the shaft, stand their watch, come
      up again, are searched, and <lb/> go to bed or to their amusements in the compound; and this
      <lb/> routine they repeat, day in and day out.</p>
     <p>It is thought that they do not now steal many diamonds&mdash; <lb/> successfully. They
      used to swallow them, and find other ways <lb/> of concealing them, but the white man found
      ways of beating <lb/>
      <pb n="705" entity="DSSR_000002496_0720"/> their various games. One man cut his leg and shoved
      a <reg orig="dia-|mond">diamond</reg>
      <lb/> into the wound, but even that project did not succeed. <lb/> When they find a fine large
      diamond they are more likely to <lb/> report it than to steal it, for in the former case they
      get a <reg orig="re-|ward">reward</reg>, <lb/> and in the latter they are quite apt to merely
      get into <lb/> trouble. Some years ago, in a mine not owned by the De <lb/> Beers, a black
      found what has been claimed to be the largest <lb/> diamond known to the world's history; and
      as a reward he <lb/> was released from service and given a blanket, a horse, and <lb/> five
      hundred dollars. <lb/> It made him a <reg orig="Van-|derbilt">Vanderbilt</reg>. <lb/> He could
      <lb/> buy four wives, and <lb/> have money left. <lb/> Four wives are an <lb/> ample support
      for a <lb/> native. With four <lb/> wives he is wholly <lb/> independent, and <lb/> need never
      do a <lb/> stroke of work again.</p>
     <figure id="f188" rend="inline" entity="DSSR_000002496_0720"/>
     <p>That great <reg orig="dia-|mond">diamond</reg>
      <lb/> weighs 97 <lb/> carats. Some say it <lb/> is as big as a piece of <lb/> alum, others say
      it <lb/> is as large as a bite <lb/> of rock candy, but <lb/> the best authorities <lb/> agree
      that it is almost <lb/> exactly the size of a chunk of ice. But those details are not <lb/>
      important; and in my opinion not trustworthy. It has a flaw <lb/>
      <pb n="706" entity="DSSR_000002496_0721"/> in it, otherwise it would be of incredible value.
      As it is, it is <lb/> held to be worth $2,000,000. After cutting it ought to be <lb/> worth
      from $5,000,000 to $8,000,000, therefore persons desiring <lb/> to save money should buy it
      now. It is owned by a syndicate, <lb/> and apparently there is no satisfactory market for it.
      It is <lb/> earning nothing; it is eating its head off. Up to this time it <lb/> has made
      nobody rich but the native who found it.</p>
     <p>He found it in a mine which was being worked by contract. <lb/> That is to say, a company
      had bought the privilege of taking <lb/> from the mine 5,000,000 carloads of blue-rock, for a
      sum down <lb/> and a royalty. Their speculation had not paid; but on the <lb/> very day that
      their privilege ran out that native found the <lb/> $2,000,000-diamond and handed it over to
      them. Even the <lb/> diamond culture is not without its romantic episodes.</p>
     <p>The Koh-i-Noor is a large diamond, and valuable; but it <lb/> cannot compete in these
      matters with three which&mdash;according <lb/> to legend&mdash;are among the crown
      trinkets of Portugal and <lb/> Russia. One of these is held to be worth $20,000,000; another,
      <lb/> $25,000,000, and the third something over $28,000,000.</p>
     <p>Those are truly wonderful diamonds, whether they exist or <lb/> not; and yet they are of but
      little importance by comparison <lb/> with the one wherewith the Boer wagoner chocked his
      wheel <lb/> on that steep grade as heretofore referred to. In Kimberley I <lb/> had some
      conversation with the man who saw the Boer do <lb/> that&mdash;an incident which had
      occurred twenty-seven or <reg orig="twenty-|eight">twenty-eight</reg>
      <lb/> years before I had my talk with him. He assured me <lb/> that that diamond's value could
      have been over a billion <lb/> dollars, but not under it. I believed him, because he had <reg
       orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg>
      <lb/> twenty-seven years to hunting for it, and was in a <lb/> position to know.</p>
     <p>A fitting and interesting finish to an examination of the <lb/> tedious and laborious and
      costly processes whereby the diamonds <lb/> are gotten out of the deeps of the earth and freed
      from the <lb/>
      <pb n="707" entity="DSSR_000002496_0722"/> base stuffs which imprison them is the visit to the

      is brought every day, and weighed, assorted, <lb/> valued, and deposited in safes against
      shipping-day. An <reg orig="un-|known">unknown</reg>
      <lb/> and unaccredited person cannot get into that place; <lb/> and it seemed apparent from
      the generous supply of warning <lb/> and protective and prohibitory signs that were posted all

      without inconvenience.</p>

      reposing upon a sheet of <lb/> white paper. That day's <lb/> catch was about $70,000 <lb/>
      worth. In the course of a <lb/> year half a ton of diamonds <lb/> pass under the scales there
      <lb/> and sleep on that counter; <lb/> the resulting money is $<reg orig="18,-|000,000"
       >18,000,000</reg>
      <lb/> or $20,000,000. Profit, about $12,000,000.</p>
     <p>Young girls were doing the sorting&mdash;a nice, clean, dainty, <lb/> and probably
      distressing employment. Every day ducal <reg orig="in-|comes">incomes</reg>
      <lb/> sift and sparkle through the fingers of those young <lb/> girls; yet they go to bed at
      night as poor as they were when <lb/> they got up in the morning. The same thing next day, and
      all <lb/> the days.</p>
     <p>They are beautiful things, those diamonds, in their native <lb/> state. They are of various
      shapes; they have flat surfaces, <lb/> rounded borders, and never a sharp edge. They are of
      all <lb/> colors and shades of color, from dewdrop white to actual black; <lb/>
      <pb n="708" entity="DSSR_000002496_0723"/> and their smooth and rounded surfaces and contours,
      variety <lb/> of color, and transparent limpidity make them look like piles <lb/> of assorted
      candies. A very light straw color is their <reg orig="com-|monest">commonest</reg>
      <lb/> tint. It seemed to me that these uncut gems must be <lb/> more beautiful than any cut
      ones could be; but when a <reg orig="collec-|tion">collection</reg>
      <lb/> of cut ones was brought out, I saw my mistake. Nothing <lb/> is so beautiful as a rose
      diamond with the light playing <lb/> through it, except that uncostly thing which is just like
      it&mdash; <lb/> wavy sea-water with the sunlight playing through it and <reg
       orig="strik-|ing">striking</reg>
      <lb/> a white-sand bottom.</p>
     <p>Before the middle of July we reached Cape Town, and the <lb/> end of our African
      journeyings. And well satisfied; for, <reg orig="tow-|ering">towering</reg>
      <lb/> above us was Table Mountain&mdash;a reminder that we had <lb/> now seen each and
      all of the great features of South Africa <lb/> except Mr. Cecil Rhodes. I realize that that
      is a large <reg orig="excep-|tion">exception</reg>. <lb/> I know quite well that whether Mr.
      Rhodes is the lofty <lb/> and worshipful patriot and statesman that multitudes believe <lb/>
      him to be, or Satan come again, as the rest of the world account <lb/> him, he is still the
      most imposing figure in the British empire <lb/> outside of England. When he stands on the
      Cape of Good <lb/> Hope, his shadow falls to the Zambesi. He is the only colonial <lb/> in the
      British dominions whose goings and comings are <reg orig="chron-|icled">chronicled</reg>
      <lb/> and discussed under all the globe's meridians, and whose <lb/> speeches, unclipped, are
      cabled from the ends of the earth; <lb/> and he is the only unroyal outsider whose arrival in
      London <lb/> can compete for attention with an eclipse.</p>
     <p>That he is an extraordinary man, and not an accident of <lb/> fortune, not even his dearest
      South African enemies were <lb/> willing to deny, so far as I heard them testify. The whole
      <lb/> South African world seemed to stand in a kind of shuddering <lb/> awe of him, friend and
      enemy alike. It was as if he were <lb/> deputy-God on the one side, deputy-Satan on the other,
       <reg orig="pro-|prietor">proprietor</reg>
      <lb/> of the people, able to make them or ruin them by his <lb/>
      <pb n="709" entity="DSSR_000002496_0724"/> breath, worshiped by many, hated by many, but
      blasphemed <lb/> by none among the judicious, and even by the indiscreet in <lb/> guarded
      whispers only.</p>
     <p>What is the secret of his formidable supremacy? One says <lb/> it is his prodigious wealth
      &mdash;a wealth whose drippings in <reg orig="sala-|ries">salaries</reg>
      <lb/> and in other ways support multitudes and make them <lb/> his interested and loyal
      vassals; another says it is his personal <lb/> magnetism and his persuasive tongue, and that
      these hypnotize <lb/> and make happy slaves of all that drift within the circle of <lb/> their
      influence; another says it is his majestic ideas, his vast <lb/> schemes for the territorial
      aggrandizement of England, his <lb/> patriotic and unselfish ambition to spread her beneficent
       <reg orig="pro-|tection">protection</reg>
      <lb/> and her just rule over the pagan wastes of Africa and <lb/> make luminous the African
      darkness with the glory of her <lb/> name; and another says he wants the earth and wants it
      for <lb/> his own, and that the belief that he will get it and let his <lb/> friends in on the
      ground floor is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> secret that rivets so many <lb/> eyes upon him and
      keeps him in the zenith where the view is <lb/> unobstructed.</p>
     <p>One may take his choice. They are all the same price. <lb/> One fact is sure: he keeps his
      prominence and a vast following, <lb/> no matter what he does. He "deceives" the Duke of
      Fife&mdash; <lb/> it is the Duke's word&mdash;but that does not destroy the Duke's
      <lb/> loyalty to him. He tricks the Reformers into immense trouble <lb/> with his Raid, but
      the most of them believe he meant well. <lb/> He weeps over the harshly-taxed Johannesburgers
      and makes <lb/> them his friends; at the same time he taxes his Charter-settlers <lb/> 50 per
      cent., and so wins their affection and their confidence <lb/> that they are squelched with
      despair at every rumor that the <lb/> Charter is to be annulled. He raids and robs and slays
      and <lb/> enslaves the Matabele and gets worlds of Charter-Christian <lb/> applause for it. He
      has beguiled England into buying Charter <lb/> waste paper for Bank of England notes, ton for
      ton, and the <lb/>
      <pb n="710" entity="DSSR_000002496_0725"/> ravished still burn incense to him as the Eventual
      God of <lb/> Plenty. He has done everything he could think of to pull <lb/> himself down to
      the ground; he has done more than enough <lb/> to pull sixteen common-run great men down; yet
      there he <lb/> stands, to this day, upon his dizzy summit under the dome of <lb/> the sky, an
      apparent permanency, the marvel of the time, the <lb/> mystery of the age, an Archangel with
      wings to half the world, <lb/> Satan with a tail to the other half.</p>
     <p>I admire him, I frankly confess it; and when his time <lb/> comes I shall buy a piece of the
      rope for a keepsake.</p>

    <head>CONCLUSION.</head>

     <p>I have traveled more than anyone else, and I have noticed that even the angels <lb/> speak

    <p><hi rend="small-caps">I saw</hi> Table Rock, anyway&mdash;a majestic pile. It is 3,000
     <lb/> feet high. It is also 17,000 feet high. These figures may <lb/> be relied upon. I got
     them in Cape Town from the two <reg orig="best-|informed">best-informed</reg>
     <lb/> citizens, men who had made Table Rock the study of <lb/> their lives. And I saw Table
     Bay, so named for its levelness. <lb/> I saw the Castle&mdash;built by the Dutch East
     India Company <lb/> three hundred years ago&mdash;where the Commanding General <lb/>
     lives; I saw St. Simon's Bay, where the Admiral lives. I <lb/> saw the Government, also the
     Parliament, where they <reg orig="quar-|reled">quarreled</reg>
     <lb/> in two languages when I was there, and agreed in none. <lb/> I saw the club. I saw and
     explored the beautiful sea-girt <lb/> drives that wind about the mountains and through the <reg
      orig="para-|dise">paradise</reg>
     <lb/>
     <pb n="711" entity="DSSR_000002496_0726"/> where the villas are. Also I saw some of the fine
     old <lb/> Dutch mansions, pleasant homes of the early times, pleasant <lb/> homes to-day, and
     enjoyed the privilege of their hospitalities.</p>
    <p>And just before I sailed I saw in one of them a quaint old <lb/> picture which was a link in
     a curious romance&mdash;a picture of a <lb/> pale, intellectual young man in a pink coat
     with a high black <lb/> collar. It was a portrait of Dr. James Barry, a military <reg
      orig="sur-|geon">surgeon</reg>
     <lb/> who came out to the Cape fifty years ago with his <reg orig="regi-|ment">regiment</reg>.
     <lb/> He was a wild young fellow, and was guilty of various <lb/> kinds of misbehavior. He was
     several times reported to <reg orig="head-|quarters">head-quarters</reg>
     <lb/> in England, and it was in each case expected that <lb/> orders would come out to deal
     with him promptly and severely, <lb/> but for some mysterious reason no orders of any kind ever
     <lb/> came back&mdash;nothing came but just an impressive silence. <lb/> This made him an
     imposing and uncanny wonder to the town.</p>
    <p>Next, he was promoted&mdash;away up. He was made Medical <lb/> Superintendent General,
     and transferred to India. Presently <lb/> he was back at the Cape again and at his escapades
     once more. <lb/> There were plenty of pretty girls, but none of them caught <lb/> him, none of
     them could get hold of his heart; evidently he <lb/> was not a marrying man. And that was
     another marvel, <lb/> another puzzle, and made no end of perplexed talk. Once he <lb/> was
     called in the night, an obstetric service, to do what he <lb/> could for a woman who was
     believed to be dying. He was <lb/> prompt and scientific, and saved both mother and child.
     There <lb/> are other instances of record which testify to his mastership of <lb/> his
     profession; and many which testify to his love of it and <lb/> his devotion to it. Among other
     adventures of his was a duel <lb/> of a desperate sort, fought with swords, at the Castle. He
     <lb/> killed his man.</p>
    <p>The child heretofore mentioned as having been saved by <lb/> Dr. Barry so long ago, was named
     for him, and still lives in <lb/> Cape Town. He had Dr. Barry's portrait painted, and gave it <lb/>
     <pb n="712" entity="DSSR_000002496_0727"/> to the gentleman in whose old Dutch house I saw
     it&mdash;the <lb/> quaint figure in pink coat and high black collar.</p>
    <p>The story seems to be arriving nowhere. But that is <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg>
     <lb/> I have not finished. Dr. Barry died in Cape Town 30 <lb/> years ago. It was then
     discovered that he was <hi rend="italic">a woman.</hi></p>
    <p>The legend goes that enquiries&mdash;soon silenced&mdash;developed <lb/> the fact
     that she was a daughter of a great English house, and <lb/> that that was why her Cape
     wildnesses brought no punishment <lb/> and got no notice when reported to the government at
     home. <lb/> Her name was an <hi rend="italic">alias</hi>. She had disgraced herself with her
     <lb/> people; so she chose to change her name and her sex and take <lb/> a new start in the
     world.</p>
    <p>We sailed on the 15th of July in the <hi rend="italic">Norman</hi>, a beautiful <lb/> ship,
     perfectly appointed. The voyage to England occupied a <lb/> short fortnight, without a stop
     except at Madeira. A good <lb/> and restful voyage for tired people, and there were several of
     <lb/> us. I seemed to have been lecturing a thousand years, though <lb/> it was only a
     twelvemonth, and a considerable number of the <lb/> others were Reformers who were fagged out
     with their five <lb/> months of seclusion in the Pretoria prison.</p>
    <p>Our trip around the earth ended at the Southampton pier, <lb/> where we embarked thirteen
     months before. It seemed a fine <lb/> and large thing to have accomplished&mdash;the
     circumnavigation <lb/> of this great globe in that little time, and I was privately proud <lb/>
     of it. For a moment. Then came one of those vanity-snubbing <lb/> astronomical reports from the
     Observatory-people, whereby it <lb/> appeared that another great body of light had lately
     flamed <lb/> up in the remotenesses of space which was traveling at a gait <lb/> which would
     enable it to do all that I had done in <hi rend="italic">a minute <lb/> and a half</hi>. Human
     pride is not worth while; there is always <lb/> something lying in wait to take the wind out of
     it.</p>
