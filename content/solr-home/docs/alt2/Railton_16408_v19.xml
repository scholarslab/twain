<head><b>MY WATCH</b><ref target="n1">*</ref><note id="n1" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1870.</p></note> <lb/>
<smcap>an instructive little tale</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>My</smcap> beautiful new watch had run eighteen months <lb/>
without losing or gaining, and without break- <lb/>
ing any part of its machinery or stopping. I had <lb/>
come to believe it infallible in its judgments about <lb/>
the time of day, and to consider its constitution and <lb/>
its anatomy imperishable. But at last, one night, I <lb/>
let it run down. I grieved about it as if it were a <lb/>
recognized messenger and forerunner of calamity. <lb/>
But by and by I cheered up, set the watch by guess, <lb/>
and commanded my bodings and superstitions to <lb/>
depart. Next day I stepped into the chief jeweler's <lb/>
to set it by the exact time, and the head of the <lb/>
establishment took it out of my hand and proceeded <lb/>
to set it for me. Then he said, "She is four min- <lb/>
utes slow&#x2014;regulator wants pushing up." I tried <lb/>
to stop him&#x2014;tried to make him understand that <lb/>
the watch kept perfect time. But no; all this <lb/>
human cabbage could see was that the watch was <lb/>
four minutes slow, and the regulator <i>must</i> be pushed <lb/>
up a little; and so, while I danced around him in <lb/>
<pb n="12"/>
anguish, and implored him to let the watch alone, <lb/>
he calmly and cruelly did the shameful deed. My <lb/>
watch began to gain. It gained faster and faster <lb/>
day by day. Within the week it sickened to a <lb/>
raging fever, and its pulse went up to a hundred <lb/>
and fifty in the shade. At the end of two months <lb/>
it had left all the timepieces of the town far in the <lb/>
rear, and was a fraction over thirteen days ahead of <lb/>
the almanac. It was away into November enjoying <lb/>
the snow, while the October leaves were still turn- <lb/>
ing. It hurried up house rent, bills payable, and such <lb/>
things, in such a ruinous way that I could not abide <lb/>
it. I took it to the watchmaker to be regulated. <lb/>
He asked me if I had ever had it repaired. I said <lb/>
no, it had never needed any repairing. He looked <lb/>
a look of vicious happiness and eagerly pried the <lb/>
watch open, and then put a small dice box into his <lb/>
eye and peered into its machinery. He said it <lb/>
wanted cleaning and oiling, besides regulating&#x2014; <lb/>
come in a week. After being cleaned and oiled, <lb/>
and regulated, my watch slowed down to that degree <lb/>
that it ticked like a tolling bell. I began to be left <lb/>
by trains, I failed all appointments, I got to missing <lb/>
my dinner; my watch strung out three days' grace <lb/>
to four and let me go to protest; I gradually drifted <lb/>
back into yesterday, then day before, then into last <lb/>
week, and by and by the comprehension came upon <lb/>
me that all solitary and alone I was lingering along <lb/>
in week before last, and the world was out of sight. <lb/>
I seemed to detect in myself a sort of sneaking <lb/>
<pb n="13"/>
fellow-feeling for the mummy in the museum, and a <lb/>
desire to swap news with him. I went to a watch- <lb/>
maker again. He took the watch all to pieces while <lb/>
I waited, and then said the barrel was "swelled." <lb/>
He said he could reduce it in three days. After this <lb/>
the watch <i>averaged</i> well, but nothing more. For <lb/>
half a day it would go like the very mischief, and <lb/>
keep up such a barking and wheezing and whooping <lb/>
and sneezing and snorting, that I could not hear <lb/>
myself think for the disturbance; and as long as it <lb/>
held out there was not a watch in the land that stood <lb/>
any chance against it. But the rest of the day it <lb/>
would keep on slowing down and fooling along until <lb/>
all the clocks it had left behind caught up again. <lb/>
So at last, at the end of twenty-four hours, it would <lb/>
trot up to the judges' stand all right and just in <lb/>
time. It would show a fair and square average, and <lb/>
no man could say it had done more or less than its <lb/>
duty. But a correct average is only a mild virtue in <lb/>
a watch, and I took this instrument to another <lb/>
watchmaker. He said the kingbolt was broken. I <lb/>
said I was glad it was nothing more serious. To <lb/>
tell the plain truth, I had no idea what the kingboit <lb/>
was, but I did not choose to appear ignorant to a <lb/>
stranger. He repaired the kingbolt, but what the <lb/>
watch gained in one way it lost in another. It would <lb/>
run awhile and then stop awhile, and then run awhile <lb/>
again, and so on, using its own discretion about the <lb/>
intervals. And every time it went off it kicked back <lb/>
like a musket. I padded my breast for a few days, <lb/>
<pb n="14"/>
but finally took the watch to another watchmaker. <lb/>
He picked it all to pieces, and turned the ruin over <lb/>
and over under his glass; and then he said there <lb/>
appeared to be something the matter with the hair- <lb/>
trigger. He fixed it, and gave it a fresh start. It <lb/>
did well now, except that always at ten minutes to <lb/>
ten the hands would shut together like a pair of <lb/>
scissors, and from that time forth they would travel <lb/>
together. The oldest man in the world could not <lb/>
make head or tail of the time of day by such a <lb/>
watch, and so I went again to have the thing re- <lb/>
paired. This person said that the crystal had got <lb/>
bent, and that the mainspring was not straight. He <lb/>
also remarked that part of the works needed half- <lb/>
soling. He made these things all right, and then <lb/>
my timepiece performed unexceptionably, save that <lb/>
now and then, after working along quietly for nearly <lb/>
eight hours, everything inside would let go all of a <lb/>
sudden and begin to buzz like a bee, and the hands <lb/>
would straightway begin to spin round and round so <lb/>
fast that their individuality was lost completely, and <lb/>
they simply seemed a delicate spider's web over the <lb/>
face of the watch. She would reel off the next <lb/>
twenty-four hours in six or seven minutes, and then <lb/>
stop with a bang. I went with a heavy heart to one <lb/>
more watchmaker, and looked on while he took her <lb/>
to pieces. Then I prepared to cross-question him <lb/>
rigidly, for this thing was getting serious. The watch <lb/>
had cost two hundred dollars originally, and I <lb/>
seemed to have paid out two or three thousand for <lb/>
<pb n="15"/>
repairs. While I waited and looked on I presently <lb/>
recognized in this watchmaker an old acquaintance <lb/>
&#x2014;a steamboat engineer of other days, and not a <lb/>
good engineer, either. He examined all the parts <lb/>
carefully, just as the other watchmakers had done, <lb/>
and then delivered his verdict with the same con- <lb/>
fidence of manner.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<p>"She makes too much steam&#x2014;you want to hang <lb/>
the monkey-wrench on the safety-valve!"</p>
<p>I brained him on the spot, and had him buried at <lb/>
my own expense.</p>
<p>My uncle William (now deceased, alas!) used to <lb/>
say that a good horse was a good horse until it had <lb/>
run away once, and that a good watch was a good <lb/>
watch until the repairers got a chance at it. And he <lb/>
used to wonder what became of all the unsuccessful <lb/>
tinkers, and gunsmiths, and shoemakers, and engin- <lb/>
eers, and blacksmiths; but nobody could ever tell <lb/>
him.</p>

<head><b>POLITICAL ECONOMY</b><ref target="n2">*</ref><note id="n2" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1870.</p></note></head>
<q><smcap>Political</smcap> Economy is the basis of all good government. The <lb/>
wisest men of all ages have brought to bear upon this subject <lb/>
the<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/></q>
<p>[Here I was interrupted and informed that a <lb/>
stranger wished to see me down at the door. I <lb/>
went and confronted him, and asked to know his <lb/>
business, struggling all the time to keep a tight rein <lb/>
on my seething political economy ideas, and not let <lb/>
them break away from me or get tangled in their <lb/>
harness. And privately I wished the stranger was <lb/>
in the bottom of the canal with a cargo of wheat on <lb/>
top of him. I was all in a fever, but he was cool. <lb/>
He said he was sorry to disturb me, but as he was <lb/>
passing he noticed that I needed some lightning- <lb/>
rods. I said, "Yes, yes&#x2014;go on&#x2014;what about <lb/>
it?" He said there was nothing about it, in par- <lb/>
ticular&#x2014;nothing except that he would like to put <lb/>
them up for me. I am new to housekeeping; have <lb/>
been used to hotels and boarding-houses all my life. <lb/>
Like anybody else of similar experience, I try to ap- <lb/>
pear (to strangers) to be an old housekeeper; con- <lb/>
<pb n="17"/>
sequently I said in an off-hand way that I had been <lb/>
intending for some time to have six or eight light- <lb/>
ning-rods put up, but&#x2014; The stranger started, and <lb/>
looked inquiringly at me, but I was serene. I thought <lb/>
that if I chanced to make any mistakes, he would not <lb/>
catch me by my countenance. He said he would <lb/>
rather have my custom than any man's in town. I <lb/>
said, "All right," and started off to wrestle with <lb/>
my great subject again, when he called me back and <lb/>
said it would be necessary to know exactly how <lb/>
many "points" I wanted put up, what parts of the <lb/>
house I wanted them on, and what quality of rod I <lb/>
preferred. It was close quarters for a man not used <lb/>
to the exigencies of housekeeping; but I went <lb/>
through creditably, and he probably never suspected <lb/>
that I was a novice. I told him to put up eight <lb/>
"points," and put them all on the roof, and use <lb/>
the best quality of rod. He said he could furnish <lb/>
the "plain" article at 20 cents a foot; "cop- <lb/>
pered," 25 cents; "zinc-plated spiral-twist," at 30 <lb/>
cents, that would stop a streak of lightning any time, <lb/>
no matter where it was bound, and "render its er- <lb/>
rand harmless and its further progress apocryphal." <lb/>
I said apocryphal was no slouch of a word, emanat- <lb/>
ing from the source it did, but, philology aside, I <lb/>
liked the spiral-twist and would take that brand. <lb/>
Then he said he <i>could</i> make two hundred and fifty <lb/>
feet answer; but to do it right, and make the best <lb/>
job in town of it, and attract the admiration of the <lb/>
just and the unjust alike, and compel all parties to <lb/>
<pb n="18"/>
say they never saw a more symmetrical and hypo- <lb/>
thetical display of lightning-rods since they were <lb/>
born, he supposed he really couldn't get along with- <lb/>
out four hundred, though he was not vindictive, and <lb/>
trusted he was willing to try. I said, go ahead and <lb/>
use four hundred, and make any kind of a job he <lb/>
pleased out of it, but let me get back to my work. <lb/>
So I got rid of him at last; and now, after half an <lb/>
hour spent in getting my train of political economy <lb/>
thoughts coupled together again, I am ready to go <lb/>
on once more.]</p>
<q>richest treasures of their genius, their experience of life, and their <lb/>
learning. The great lights of commercial jurisprudence, international <lb/>
confraternity, and biological deviation, of all ages, all civilizations, and <lb/>
all nationalities, from Zoroaster down to Horace Greeley, have<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/></q>
<p>[Here I was interrupted again, and required to go <lb/>
down and confer further with that lightning-rod <lb/>
man. I hurried off, boiling and surging with pro- <lb/>
digious thoughts wombed in words of such majesty <lb/>
that each one of them was in itself a straggling pro- <lb/>
cession of syllables that might be fifteen minutes <lb/>
passing a given point, and once more I confronted <lb/>
him&#x2014;he so calm and sweet, I so hot and frenzied. <lb/>
He was standing in the contemplative attitude of the <lb/>
Colossus of Rhodes, with one foot on my infant <lb/>
tuberose, and the other among my pansies, his hands <lb/>
on his hips, his hat-brim tilted forward, one eye <lb/>
shut and the other gazing critically and admiringly <lb/>
in the direction of my principal chimney. He said <lb/>
now <i>there</i> was a state of things to make a man glad <lb/>
<pb n="19"/>
to be alive; and added, "I leave it to <i>you</i> if you <lb/>
ever saw anything more deliriously picturesque than <lb/>
eight lightning-rods on one chimney?" I said I had <lb/>
no present recollection of anything that transcended <lb/>
it. He said that in his opinion nothing on earth but <lb/>
Niagara Falls was superior to it in the way of natural <lb/>
scenery. All that was needed now, he verily be- <lb/>
lieved, to make my house a perfect balm to the eye, <lb/>
was to kind of touch up the other chimneys a little, <lb/>
and thus "add to the generous <i>coup d'&#x0153;il</i> a sooth- <lb/>
ing uniformity of achievement which would allay the <lb/>
excitement naturally consequent upon the first <i>coup <lb/>
d'&#x00E9;tat</i>." I asked him if he learned to talk out of a <lb/>
book, and if I could borrow it anywhere? He <lb/>
smiled pleasantly, and said that his manner of <lb/>
speaking was not taught in books, and that nothing <lb/>
but familiarity with lightning could enable a man to <lb/>
handle his conversational style with impunity. He <lb/>
then figured up an estimate, and said that about <lb/>
eight more rods scattered about my roof would <lb/>
about fix me right, and he guessed five hundred feet <lb/>
of stuff would do it; and added that the first eight <lb/>
had got a little the start of him, so to speak, and <lb/>
used up a mere trifle of material more than he had <lb/>
calculated on&#x2014;a hundred feet or along there. I <lb/>
said I was in a dreadful hurry, and I wished we <lb/>
could get this business permanently mapped out, so <lb/>
that I could go on with my work. He said, "I <lb/>
<i>could</i> have put up those eight rods, and marched off <lb/>
about my business&#x2014;some men <i>would</i> have done it. <lb/>
<pb n="20"/>
But no; I said to myself, this man is a stranger to <lb/>
me, and I will die before I'll wrong him; there ain't <lb/>
lightning-rods enough on that house, and for one <lb/>
I'll never stir out of my tracks till I've done as I <lb/>
would be done by, and told him so. Stranger, my <lb/>
duty is accomplished; if the recalcitrant and dephlo- <lb/>
gistic messenger of heaven strikes your&#x2014;" "There, <lb/>
now, there," I said, "put on the other eight&#x2014;add <lb/>
five hundred feet of spiral-twist&#x2014;do anything and <lb/>
everything you want to do; but calm your suffer- <lb/>
ings, and try to keep your feelings where you can <lb/>
reach them with the dictionary. Meanwhile, if we <lb/>
understand each other now, I will go to work <lb/>
again."</p>
<p>I think I have been sitting here a full hour this <lb/>
time, trying to get back to where I was when my <lb/>
train of thought was broken up by the last interrup- <lb/>
tion; but I believe I have accomplished it at last, <lb/>
and may venture to proceed again.]</p>
<q>wrestled with this great subject, and the greatest among them have found <lb/>
it a worthy adversary, and one that always comes up fresh and smiling <lb/>
after every throw. The great Confucius said that he would rather be a <lb/>
profound political economist than chief of police. Cicero frequently <lb/>
said that political economy was the grandest consummation that the <lb/>
human mind was capable of consuming; and even our own Greeley has <lb/>
said vaguely but forcibly that "<i>Political</i><gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/></q>
<p>[Here the lightning-rod man sent up another call <lb/>
for me. I went down in a state of mind bordering <lb/>
on impatience. He said he would rather have died <lb/>
than interrupt me, but when he was employed to do <lb/>
<pb n="21"/>
a job, and that job was expected to be done in a <lb/>
clean, workmanlike manner, and when it was finished <lb/>
and fatigue urged him to seek the rest and recreation <lb/>
he stood so much in need of, and he was about to <lb/>
do it, but looked up and saw at a glance that all the <lb/>
calculations had been a little out, and if a thunder <lb/>
storm were to come up, and that house, which he <lb/>
felt a personal interest in, stood there with nothing <lb/>
on earth to protect it but sixteen lightning-rods&#x2014; <lb/>
"Let us have peace!" I shrieked. "Put up a <lb/>
hundred and fifty! Put some on the kitchen! Put <lb/>
a dozen on the barn! Put a couple on the cow!&#x2014; <lb/>
Put one on the cook!&#x2014;scatter them all over the <lb/>
persecuted place till it looks like a zinc-plated, <lb/>
spiral-twisted, silver-mounted cane-brake! Move! <lb/>
Use up all the material you can get your hands on, <lb/>
and when you run out of lightning-rods put up ram- <lb/>
rods, cam-rods, stair-rods, piston-rods&#x2014;<i>anything</i> <lb/>
that will pander to your dismal appetite for artificial <lb/>
scenery, and bring respite to my raging brain and <lb/>
healing to my lacerated soul!" Wholly unmoved&#x2014; <lb/>
further than to smile sweetly&#x2014;this iron being <lb/>
simply turned back his wristbands daintily, and said <lb/>
he would now proceed to hump himself. Well, <lb/>
all that was nearly three hours ago. It is question- <lb/>
able whether I am calm enough yet to write on the <lb/>
noble theme of political economy, but I cannot resist <lb/>
the desire to try, for it is the one subject that is <lb/>
nearest to my heart and dearest to my brain of all <lb/>
this world's philosophy.]</p>

<q>"<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/><i>economy is heaven's best boon to man</i>." When the loose but <lb/>
gifted Byron lay in his Venetian exile he observed that, if it could be <lb/>
granted him to go back and live his misspent life over again, he <lb/>
would give his lucid and unintoxicated intervals to the composition, not <lb/>
of frivolous rhymes, but of essays upon political economy. Washington <lb/>
loved this exquisite science; such names as Baker, Beckwith, Judson, <lb/>
Smith, are imperishably linked with it; and even imperial Homer, in <lb/>
the ninth book of the Iliad, has said:&#x2014;</q>

<q>The grandeur of these conceptions of the old poet, together with the <lb/>

<p><smcap>Three Days Later</smcap>.&#x2014;We are all about worn <lb/>
out. For four-and-twenty hours our bristling prem- <lb/>
ises were the talk and wonder of the town. The <lb/>
<pb n="23"/>
theaters languished, for their happiest scenic inven- <lb/>
tions were tame and commonplace compared with <lb/>
my lightning-rods. Our street was blocked night <lb/>
and day with spectators, and among them were <lb/>
many who came from the country to see. It was a <lb/>
blessed relief on the second day when a thunder <lb/>
storm came up and the lightning began to "go for" <lb/>
my house, as the historian Josephus quaintly phrases <lb/>
it. It cleared the galleries, so to speak. In five <lb/>
minutes there was not a spectator within half a mile <lb/>
of my place; but all the high houses about that dis- <lb/>
tance away were full, windows, roof, and all. And <lb/>
well they might be, for all the falling stars and Fourth <lb/>
of July fireworks of a generation, put together and <lb/>
rained down simultaneously out of heaven in one <lb/>
brilliant shower upon one helpless roof, would not <lb/>
have any advantage of the pyrotechnic display that <lb/>
was making my house so magnificently conspicuous <lb/>
in the general gloom of the storm. By actual count, <lb/>
the lightning struck at my establishment seven hun- <lb/>
dred and sixty-four times in forty minutes, but <lb/>
tripped on one of those faithful rods every time, <lb/>
and slid down the spiral-twist and shot into the <lb/>
earth before it probably had time to be surprised at <lb/>
the way the thing was done. And through all that <lb/>
bombardment only one patch of slates was ripped <lb/>
up, and that was because, for a single instant, the <lb/>
rods in the vicinity were transporting all the light- <lb/>
ning they could possibly accommodate. Well, noth- <lb/>
ing was ever seen like it since the world began. For <lb/>
<pb n="24"/>
one whole day and night not a member of my family <lb/>
stuck his head out of the window but he got the hair <lb/>
snatched off it as smooth as a billiard-ball; and, if <lb/>
the reader will believe me, not one of us ever <lb/>
dreamt of stirring abroad. But at last the awful <lb/>
siege came to an end&#x2014;because there was absolutely <lb/>
no more electricity left in the clouds above us within <lb/>
grappling distance of my insatiable rods. Then I <lb/>
sallied forth, and gathered daring workmen together, <lb/>
and not a bite or a nap did we take till the premises <lb/>
were utterly stripped of all their terrific armament <lb/>
except just three rods on the house, one on the <lb/>
kitchen, and one on the barn&#x2014;and, behold, these <lb/>
remain there even unto this day. And then, and <lb/>
not till then, the people ventured to use our street <lb/>
again. I will remark here, in passing, that during <lb/>
that fearful time I did not continue my essay upon <lb/>
political economy. I am not even yet settled enough <lb/>
in nerve and brain to resume it.</p>

<p><smcap>Even</smcap> a criminal is entitled to fair play; and cer- <lb/>
tainly when a man who has done no harm has <lb/>
been unjustly treated, he is privileged to do his best <lb/>
to right himself. My attention has just been called <lb/>
to an article some three years old in a French <lb/>
Magazine entitled, "<foreign lang="ger">Revue des Deux Mondes"</foreign> <lb/>
(Review of Some Two Worlds), wherein the writer <lb/>
treats of "Les Humoristes Americaines" (These <lb/>
Humorists Americans). I am one of these humor- <lb/>
ists Americans dissected by him, and hence the <lb/>
complaint I am making.</p>
<p>This gentleman's article is an able one (as articles <lb/>
go, in the French, where they always tangle up <lb/>
everything to that degree that when you start into a <lb/>
sentence you never know whether you are going to <lb/>
come out alive or not). It is a very good article, <lb/>
and the writer says all manner of kind and compli- <lb/>
mentary things about me&#x2014;for which I am sure I <lb/>
<pb n="26"/>
thank him with all my heart; but then why should <lb/>
he go and spoil all his praise by one unlucky experi- <lb/>
ment? What I refer to is this: he says my Jumping <lb/>
Frog is a funny story, but still he can't see why it <lb/>
should ever really convulse any one with laughter&#x2014; <lb/>
and straightway proceeds to translate it into French <lb/>
in order to prove to his nation that there is nothing <lb/>
so very extravagantly funny about it. Just there is <lb/>
where my complaint originates. He has not trans- <lb/>
lated it at all; he has simply mixed it all up; it is <lb/>
no more like the Jumping Frog when he gets through <lb/>
with it than I am like a meridian of longitude. But <lb/>
my mere assertion is not proof; wherefore I print <lb/>
the French version, that all may see that I do not <lb/>
speak falsely; furthermore, in order that even the <lb/>
unlettered may know my injury and give me their <lb/>
compassion, I have been at infinite pains and trouble <lb/>
to re-translate this French version back into English; <lb/>
and to tell the truth I have well nigh worn myself <lb/>
out at it, having scarcely rested from my work <lb/>
during five days and nights. I cannot speak the <lb/>
French language, but I can translate very well, <lb/>
though not fast, I being self-educated. I ask the <lb/>
reader to run his eye over the original English <lb/>
version of the Jumping Frog, and then read the <lb/>
French or my re-translation, and kindly take notice <lb/>
how the Frenchman has riddled the grammar. I <lb/>
think it is the worst I ever saw; and yet the French <lb/>
are called a polished nation. If I had a boy that <lb/>
put sentences together as they do, I would polish <lb/>
<pb n="27"/>
him to some purpose. Without further introduc- <lb/>
tion, the Jumping Frog, as I originally wrote it, was <lb/>
as follows [after it will be found the French version, <lb/>
and after the latter my re-translation from the <lb/>
French]: <lb/>
<q>THE NOTORIOUS JUMPING FROG OF CALAVERAS<ref target="n4">*</ref><note id="n4" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Pronounced Cal-e-<i>va</i>-ras.</p></note> <lb/>
COUNTY.</q>
<q>In compliance with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote me <lb/>
from the East, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, <lb/>
and inquired after my friend's friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as requested <lb/>
to do, and I hereunto append the result. I have a lurking suspicion <lb/>
that <i>Leonidas W.</i> Smiley is a myth; that my friend never knew such a <lb/>
personage; and that he only conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler <lb/>
about him, it would remind him of his infamous <i>Jim</i> Smiley, and he <lb/>
would go to work and bore me to death with some exasperating remin- <lb/>
iscence of him as long and as tedious as it should be useless to me. If <lb/>
that was the design, it succeeded.</q>
<q>I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the barroom stove of <lb/>
the dilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp of Angel's, and I <lb/>
noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had an expression of <lb/>
winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He <lb/>
roused up, and gave me good-day. I told him a friend of mine had <lb/>
commissioned me to make some inquiries about a cherished companion <lb/>
of his boyhood named <i>Leonidas W.</i> Smiley&#x2014;<i>Rev. Leonidas W.</i> <lb/>
Smiley, a young minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one <lb/>
time a resident of Angel's Camp. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could <lb/>
tell me anything about this Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel <lb/>
under many obligations to him.</q>
<q>Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there <lb/>
with his chair, and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narra- <lb/>
tive which follows this paragraph. He never smiled, he never frowned, <lb/>
he never changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he <lb/>
tuned his initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of <lb/>
enthusiasm; but all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein <lb/>
<pb n="28"/>
of impressive earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so <lb/>
far from his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or funny <lb/>
about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired <lb/>
its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in <foreign lang="fre"><i>finesse</i>.</foreign> I let him go <lb/>
on in his own way, and never interrupted him once.</q>
<q>"Rev. Leonidas W. H'm, Reverend Le&#x2014;well, there was a feller <lb/>
here once by the name of <i>Jim</i> Smiley, in the winter of '49&#x2014;or may <lb/>
be it was the spring of '50&#x2014;I don't recollect exactly, somehow, though <lb/>
what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the <lb/>
big flume warn't finished when he first come to the camp; but any way, <lb/>
he was the curiosest man about always betting on anything that turned <lb/>
up you ever see, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and <lb/>
if he couldn't he'd change sides. Any way that suited the other man <lb/>
would suit <i>him</i>&#x2014;any way just so's he got a bet, <i>he</i> was satisfied. But <lb/>
still he was lucky, uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner. <lb/>
He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no <lb/>
solit'ry thing mentioned but that feller'd offer to bet on it, and take ary <lb/>
side you please, as I was just telling you. If there was a horse-race, <lb/>
you'd find him flush or you'd find him busted at the end of it; if there <lb/>
was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; <lb/>
if there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds <lb/>
setting on a fence, he would bet you which one would fly first; or if <lb/>
there was a camp-meeting, he would be there reg'lar to bet on Parson <lb/>
Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and so he <lb/>
was too, and a good man. If he even see a straddle-bug start to go <lb/>
anywheres, he would bet you how long it would take him to get to&#x2014; <lb/>
to wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he would foller <lb/>
that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was <lb/>
bound for and how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has <lb/>
seen that Smiley, and can tell you about him. Why, it never made no <lb/>
difference to <i>him</i>&#x2014;he'd bet on <i>any</i> thing&#x2014;the dangdest feller. Parson <lb/>
Walker's wife laid very sick once, for a good while, and it seemed as if <lb/>
they warn't going to save her; but one morning he come in, and Smiley <lb/>
up and asked him how she was, and he said she was considable better&#x2014; <lb/>
thank the Lord for his inf'nite mercy&#x2014;and coming on so smart that with <lb/>
the blessing of Prov'dence she'd get well yet; and Smiley, before he <lb/>
thought, says, "Well, I'll resk two-and-a-half she don't anyway."</q>
<q>Thish-yer Smiley had a mare&#x2014;the boys called her the fifteen-minute <lb/>
nag, but that was only in fun, you know, because of course she was <lb/>
<pb n="29"/>
faster than that&#x2014;and he used to win money on that horse, for all she <lb/>
was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or the con- <lb/>
sumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or <lb/>
three hundred yards start, and then pass her under way; but always <lb/>
at the fag end of the race she'd get excited and desperate like, and <lb/>
come cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around <lb/>
limber, sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side among the <lb/>
fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e dust and raising m-o-r-e racket with her <lb/>
coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose&#x2014;and <i>always</i> fetch up at <lb/>
the stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down.</q>
<q>And he had a little small bull-pup, that to look at him you'd think <lb/>
he warn't worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay for a <lb/>
chance to steal something. But as soon as money was up on him he was <lb/>
a different dog; his under-jaw'd begin to stick out like the fo'castle of a <lb/>
steamboat, and his teeth would uncover and shine like the furnaces. <lb/>
And a dog might tackle him and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw <lb/>
him over his shoulder two or three times, and Andrew Jackson&#x2014;which <lb/>
was the name of the pup&#x2014;Andrew Jackson would never let on but <lb/>
what <i>he</i> was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else&#x2014;and the bets <lb/>
being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money <lb/>
was all up; and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest <lb/>
by the j'int of his hind leg and freeze to it&#x2014;not chaw, you understand, <lb/>
but only just grip and hang on till they throwed up the sponge, if it was <lb/>
a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he harnessed <lb/>
a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off <lb/>
in a circular saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and <lb/>
the money was all up, and he come to make a snatch for his pet holt, <lb/>
he see in a minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other dog <lb/>
had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he <lb/>
looked sorter discouraged-like, and didn't try no more to win the fight, <lb/>
and so he got shucked out bad. He give Smiley a look, as much as to <lb/>
say his heart was broke, and it was <i>his</i> fault, for putting up a dog that <lb/>
hadn't no hind legs for him to take holt of, which was his main de- <lb/>
pendence in a fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and <lb/>
died. It was a good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have <lb/>
made a name for hisself if he'd lived, for the stuff was in him and he <lb/>
had genius&#x2014;I know it, because he hadn't no opportunities to speak of, <lb/>
and it don't stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as he <lb/>
could under them circumstances if he hadn't no talent. It always <lb/>
<pb n="30"/>
makes me feel sorry when I think of that last fight of his'n, and the <lb/>
way it turned out.</q>
<q>Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tom- <lb/>
cats and all them kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't <lb/>
fetch nothing for him to bet on but he'd match you. He ketched a <lb/>
frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'lated to educate him; <lb/>
and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard <lb/>
and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he <i>did</i> learn him, too. <lb/>
He'd give him a little punch behind, and the next minute you'd see <lb/>
that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut&#x2014;see him turn one sum- <lb/>
merset, or may be a couple, if he got a good start, and come down <lb/>
flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of <lb/>
ketching flies, and kep' him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly <lb/>
every time as fur as he could see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted <lb/>
was education, and he could do 'most anything&#x2014;and I believe him. <lb/>
Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down here on this floor&#x2014;Dan'l <lb/>
Webster was the name of the frog&#x2014;and sing out, "Flies, Dan'l, <lb/>
flies!" and quicker'n you could wink he'd spring straight up and snake <lb/>
a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on the floor ag'in as solid as <lb/>
a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his hind <lb/>
foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n <lb/>
any frog might do. You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard <lb/>
as he was, for all he was so gifted. And when it come to fair and square <lb/>
jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one straddle <lb/>
than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level <lb/>
was his strong suit, you understand; and when it come to that, Smiley <lb/>
would ante up money on him as long as he had a red. Smiley was <lb/>
monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had <lb/>
traveled and been everywheres all said he laid over any frog that ever <lb/>
<i>they</i> see.</q>
<q>Well, Smiley kep' the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to <lb/>
fetch him down town sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller&#x2014;a <lb/>
stranger in the camp, he was&#x2014;come acrost him with his box, and says:</q>
<q>"What might it be that you've got in the box?"</q>
<q>And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, "It might be a parrot, or it <lb/>
might be a canary, maybe, but it ain't&#x2014;its only just a frog."</q>
<q>And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round <lb/>
this way and that, and says, "H'm&#x2014;so 'tis. Well, what's <i>he</i> good <lb/>
for?"</q>
<pb/>
<figure>
<head>"FLIES, DAN'L, FLIES!"</head>
</figure>
<pb/>
<pb n="31"/>
<q>"Well," Smiley says, easy and careless, "he's good enough for <lb/>
<i>one</i> thing, I should judge&#x2014;he can outjump any frog in Calaveras <lb/>
county."</q>
<q>The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular <lb/>
look, and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, "Well," he <lb/>
says, "I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any <lb/>
other frog."</q>
<q>"Maybe you don't," Smiley says. "Maybe you understand frogs <lb/>
and maybe you don't understand 'em; maybe you've had experience, <lb/>
and maybe you ain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've got <lb/>
<i>my</i> opinion, and I'll resk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in <lb/>
Calaveras county."</q>
<q>And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad like, <lb/>
"Well, I'm only a stranger here, and I ain't got no frog; but if I had <lb/>
a frog, I'd bet you."</q>
<q>And then Smiley says, "That's all right&#x2014;that's all right&#x2014;if you'll <lb/>
hold my box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog." And so the feller <lb/>
took the box, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley's, and set <lb/>
down to wait.</q>
<q>So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself, and <lb/>
then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon <lb/>
and filled him full of quail shot&#x2014;filled him pretty near up to his chin <lb/>
&#x2014;and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped <lb/>
around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and <lb/>
fetched him in, and give him to this feller, and says:</q>
<q>"Now, if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore- <lb/>
paws just even with Dan'l's, and I'll give the word." Then he says, <lb/>
"One&#x2014;two&#x2014;three&#x2014;<i>git!</i>" and him and the feller touched up the <lb/>
frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off lively, but Dan'l give a <lb/>
heave, and hysted up his shoulders&#x2014;so&#x2014;like a Frenchman, but it <lb/>
warn't no use&#x2014;he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as a church; <lb/>
and he couldn't no more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was <lb/>
a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he didn't have no <lb/>
idea what the matter was, of course.</q>
<q>The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going <lb/>
out at the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder&#x2014;so&#x2014;at <lb/>
Dan'l, and says again, very deliberate, "Well," he says, "<i>I</i> don't see <lb/>
no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog."</q>
<q>Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a <lb/>
<pb n="32"/>
long time, and at last he says, "I do wonder what in the nation that <lb/>
frog throw'd off for&#x2014;I wonder if there ain't something the matter <lb/>
with him&#x2014;he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow." And he <lb/>
ketched Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, "Why <lb/>
blame my cats if he don't weigh five pound!" and turned him upside <lb/>
down and he belched out a double handful of shot. And then he see <lb/>
how it was, and he was the maddest man&#x2014;he set the frog down and <lb/>
took out after that feller, but he never ketched him. And&#x2014;"</q>
<q>[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, <lb/>
and got up to see what was wanted.] And turning to me as he moved <lb/>
away, he said: "Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy&#x2014;I <lb/>
ain't going to be gone a second."</q>
<q>But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history <lb/>
of the enterprising vagabond <i>Jim</i> Smiley would be likely to afford me <lb/>
much information concerning the Rev. <i>Leonidas W</i>. Smiley, and so I <lb/>
started away.</q>
<q>At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he button- <lb/>
holed me and re-commenced:</q>
<q>"Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller one-eyed cow that didn't have <lb/>
no tail, only just a short stump like a bannanner, and&#x2014;"</q>
<q>However, lacking both time and inclination, I did not wait to hear <lb/>
about the afflicted cow, but took my leave.</q></p>

<q><foreign lang="fre">"&#x2014;Il y avait une fois ici un individu connu sous le nom de Jim <lb/>
Smiley: c'&#x00E9;tait dans l'hiver de 49, peut-&#x00EA;tre bien au printemps de 50, je <lb/>
ne me rappelle pas exactement. Ce qui me fait croire que c'&#x00E9;tait l'un ou <lb/>
l'autre, c'est que je me souviens que le grand bief n'&#x00E9;tait pas achev&#x00E9; <lb/>
lorsqu'il arriva au camp pour la premi&#x00E9;re fois, mais de toutes fa&#x00E7;ons il <lb/>
&#x00E9;tait l'homme le plus friand de paris qui se p&#x00FB;t voir, pariant sur tout ce <lb/>
qui se pr&#x00E9;sentait, quand il pouvait trouver un adversaire, et, quand il <lb/>
n'en trouvait pas il passait du c&#x00F4;t&#x00E9; oppos&#x00E9;. Tout ce qui convenait <lb/>
&#x00E0; l'autre lui convenait; pourvu qu'il e&#x00FB;t un pari, Smiley &#x00E9;tait satisfait. <lb/>
Et il avait une chance! une chance inouie: presque toujours il gagnait. <lb/>
<pb n="33"/>
Il faut dire qu'il &#x00E9;tait toujours pr&#x00EA;t &#x00E0; s'exposer, qu'on ne pouvait <lb/>
mentionner la moindre chose sans que ce gaillard offr&#x00EE;t de parier l&#x00E0;- <lb/>
dessus n'importe quoi et de prendre le c&#x00F4;t&#x00E9; que l'on voudrait, comme je <lb/>
vous le disais tout &#x00E0; l'heure. S'il y avait des courses, vous le trouviez <lb/>
riche ou ruin&#x00E9; &#x00E2; la fin; s'il y avait un combat de chiens, il apportait son <lb/>
enjeu; il l'apportait pour un combat de chats, pour un combat de <lb/>
coqs;&#x2014;parbleu! si vous aviez vu deux oiseaux sur une haie, il vous <lb/>
aurait offert de parier lequel s'envolerait le premier, et, s'il y avait <lb/>
<i>meeting</i> au camp, il venait parier r&#x00E9;guli&#x00E8;rement pour le cur&#x00E9; Walker, <lb/>
qu'il jugeait &#x00EA;tre le meilleur pr&#x00E9;dicateur des environs, et qui l'&#x00E9;tait en <lb/>
effet, et un brave homme. Il aurait rencontr&#x00E9; une punaise de bois en <lb/>
chemin, qu'il aurait pari&#x00E9; sur le temps qu'il lui faudrait pour aller o&#x00F9; <lb/>
elle voudrait aller, et, si vous l'aviez pris au mot, il aurait suivi la <lb/>
punaise jusqu'au Mexique, sans se soucier d'aller si loin, ni du temps <lb/>
qu'il y perdrait. Une fois la femme du cur&#x00E9; Walker fut tr&#x00E8;s malade <lb/>
pendant longtemps, il semblait qu'on ne la sauverait pas; mais un matin <lb/>
le cur&#x00E9; arrive, et Smiley lui demande comment ella va, et il dit qu'elle <lb/>
est bien mieux, gr&#x00E2;ce &#x00E0; l'infinie mis&#x00E9;ricorde, tellement mieux qu'avec la <lb/>
b&#x00E9;n&#x00E9;diction de la Providence elle s'en tirerait, et voil&#x00E1; que, sans y <lb/>
penser, Smiley r&#x00E9;pond:&#x2014;Eh bien! ye gage deux et demi qu'elle mourra <lb/>
tout de m&#x00EA;me.</foreign></q>
<q><foreign lang="fre">"Ce Smiley avait une jument que les gars appelaient le bidet du <lb/>
quart d'heure, mais seulement pour plaisanter, vous comprenez, parce <lb/>
que, bien entendu, elle &#x00E9;tait plus <i>vite</i> que &#x00E7;a! Et il avait coutume de <lb/>
gagner de l'argent avec cette b&#x00EA;te, quoiqu'elle f&#x00FB;t poussive, cornarde, <lb/>
toujours prise d'asthme, de coliques ou de consomption, ou de quelque <lb/>
chose d'approchant. On lui donnait 2 ou 300 <i>yards</i> au d&#x00E9;part, puis <lb/>
on la d&#x00E9;passait sans peine; mais jamais &#x00E0; la fin elle ne manquait de <lb/>
s'&#x00E9;chauffer, de s'exasp&#x00E9;rer, et elle arrivait, s'&#x00E9;cartant, se d&#x00E9;fendant, ses <lb/>
jambes gr&#x00EA;les en l'air devant les obstacles, quelquefois les &#x00E9;vitant et <lb/>
faisant avec cela plus de poussi&#x00E8;re qu'aucun cheval, plus de bruit <lb/>
surtout avec ses &#x00E9;ternumens et reniflemens,&#x2014;crac! elle arrivait donc <lb/>
toujours premi&#x00E8;re d'une t&#x00EA;te, aussi juste qu'on peut le mesurer. Et il <lb/>
avait un petit bouledogue qui, &#x00E0; le voir, ne valait pas un sou; on aurait <lb/>
cru que parier contre lui c'&#x00E9;tait voler, tant il &#x00E9;tait ordinaire; mais <lb/>
aussit&#x00F4;t les enjeux faits, il devenait un autre chien. Sa m&#x00E2;choire <lb/>
inf&#x00E9;rieure commen&#x00E7;ait &#x00E0; ressortir comme un gaillard d'avant, ses dents <lb/>
se d&#x00E9;couvraient brillantes commes des fournaises, et un chien pouvait le <lb/>
taquiner, l'exciter, le mordre, le jeter deux ou trois fois par-dessus son <lb/>
<pb n="34"/>
&#x00E9;paule, Andr&#x00E9; Jackson, c'&#x00E9;tait le nom du chien, Andr&#x00E9; Jackson prenait <lb/>
cela tranquillement, comme s'il ne se f&#x00FB;t jamais attendu &#x00E0; autre chose, et <lb/>
quand les paris &#x00E9;taient doubl&#x00E9;s et redoubl&#x00E9;s contre lui, il vous saisissait <lb/>
l'autre chien juste &#x00E0; l'articulation de la jambe de derri&#x00E8;re, et il ne la <lb/>
l&#x00E2;chait plus, non pas qu'il la m&#x00E2;ch&#x00E2;t, vous concevez, mais il s'y serait tenu <lb/>
pendu jusqu'&#x00E0; ce qu'on jet&#x00E2;t l'&#x00E9;ponge en l'air, fall&#x00FB;t-il attendre un an. <lb/>
Smiley gagnait toujours avec cette b&#x00EA;te-l&#x00E0;; malheureusement ils ont fini <lb/>
par dresser un chien qui n'avait pas de pattes de derri&#x00E8;re, parce qu'on les <lb/>
avait sci&#x00E9;es, et quand les choses furent au point qu'il voulait, et qu'il en <lb/>
vint &#x00E0; se jeter sur son morceau favori, le pauvre chien comprit en un in- <lb/>
stant qu'on s'&#x00E9;tait moqu&#x00E9; de lui, et que l'autre le tenait. Vous n'avez <lb/>
jamais vu personne avoir l'air plus penaud et plus d&#x00E9;courag&#x00E9;; il ne fit <lb/>
aucun effort pour gagner le combat et fut rudement secou&#x00E9;, de sorte que, <lb/>
regardant Smiley comme pour lui dire:&#x2014;Mon c&#x0153;ur est bris&#x00E9;, c'est ta <lb/>
faute; pourquoi m'avoir livr&#x00E9; &#x00E0; un chien qui n'a pas de pattes de derri&#x00E9;re, <lb/>
puisque c'est par l&#x00E0; que je les bats?&#x2014;il s'en alla en clopinant, et se <lb/>
coucha pour mourir. Ah! c'&#x00E9;tait un bon chien, cet Andr&#x00E9; Jackson, et <lb/>
il se serait fait un nom, s'il avait v&#x00E9;cu, car il y avait de l'etoffe en lui, il <lb/>
avait du g&#x00E9;nie, je la sais, bien que de grandes occasions lui aient <lb/>
manqu&#x00E9;; mais il est impossible de supposer qu'un chien capable de se <lb/>
battre comme lui, certaines circonstances &#x00E9;tant donn&#x00E9;es, ait manqu&#x00E9; de <lb/>
talent. Je me sens triste toutes les fois que je pense &#x00E0; son dernier <lb/>
combat et au d&#x00E9;no&#x00FB;ment qu'il a eu. Eh bien! ce Smiley nourrissait des <lb/>
terriers &#x00E0; rats, et des coqs de combat, et des chats, et toute sorte de <lb/>
choses, au point qu'il &#x00E9;tait toujours en mesure de vous tenir t&#x00EA;te, et <lb/>
qu'avec sa rage de paris on n'avait plus de repos. Il attrapa un jour une <lb/>
grenouille et l'emporta chez lui, disant qu'il pr&#x00E9;tendait faire son &#x00E9;duca- <lb/>
tion; vous me croirez si vous voulez, mais pendant trois mois il n'a rien <lb/>
fait que lui apprendre &#x00E0; sauter dans une cour retir&#x00E9;e de sa maison. Et je <lb/>
vous r&#x00E9;ponds qu'il avait r&#x00E9;ussi. Il lui donnait un petit coup par <lb/>
derri&#x00E8;re, et l'instant d'apr&#x00E8;s vous voyiez la grenouille tourner en l'air <lb/>
comme un beignet au-dessus de la po&#x00EA;le, faire une culbute, quelquefois <lb/>
deux, lorsqu'elle &#x00E9;tait bien partie, et retomber sur ses pattes comme un <lb/>
chat. Il l'avait dress&#x00E9;e dans l'art de gober des mouches, et l'y exer&#x00E7;ait <lb/>
continuellement, si bien qu'une mouche, du plus loin qu'elle apparaissait, <lb/>
&#x00E9;tait une mouche perdue. Smiley avait coutume de dire que tout ce qui <lb/>
manquait &#x00E0; une grenouille, c'&#x00E9;tait l'&#x00E9;ducation, qu'avec l'&#x00E9;ducation elle <lb/>
pouvait faire presque tout, et je le crois. Tenez, je l'ai vu poser <lb/>
Daniel Webster l&#x00E0; sur se plancher,&#x2014;Daniel Webster &#x00E9;tait le nom de la <lb/>
<pb n="35"/>
grenouille,&#x2014;et lui chanter:&#x2014;Des mouches! Daniel, des mouches!&#x2014; <lb/>
En un clin d'&#x0153;il, Daniel avait bondi et saisi une mouche ici sur le <lb/>
comptoir, puis saut&#x00E9; de nouveau par terre, o&#x00F9; il restait vraiment &#x00E0; se <lb/>
gratter la t&#x00EA;te avec sa patte de derri&#x00E8;re, comme s'il n'avait pas eu la <lb/>
moindre id&#x00E9;e de sa sup&#x00E9;riorit&#x00E9;. Jamais vous n'avez grenouille vu de <lb/>
aussi modeste, aussi naturelle, dou&#x00E9;e comme elle l'&#x00E9;tait! Et quand il <lb/>
s'agissait de sauter purement et simplement sur terrain plat, elle faisait <lb/>
plus de chemin en un saut qu'aucune b&#x00EA;te de son esp&#x00E8;ce que vous <lb/>
puissiez conna&#x00EE;tre. Sauter &#x00E0; plat, c'&#x00E9;tait son fort! Quand il s'agaissait <lb/>
de cela, Smiley entassait les enjeux sur elle tant qu'il lui, restait un <lb/>
rouge liard. Il faut le reconna&#x00EE;tre, Smiley &#x00E9;tait monstrueusement fier <lb/>
de sa grenouille, et il en avait le droit, car des gens qui avaient voyag&#x00E9;, <lb/>
qui avaient tout vu, disaient qu'on lui ferait injure de la comparer &#x00E0; une <lb/>
autre; de fa&#x00E7;on que Smiley gardait Daniel dans une petite bo&#x00EE;te &#x00E0; claire- <lb/>
voie qu'il emporta it parfois &#x00E0; la ville pour quelque pari.</foreign></q>
<q><foreign lang="fre">"Un jour, un individu &#x00E9;tranger au camp l'arr&#x00EA;te avec sa bo&#x00ED;te et lui <lb/>

<q><foreign lang="fre">"&#x2014;Mon Dieu! r&#x00E9;pond Smiley, toujours d'un air d&#x00E9;gag&#x00E9;, elle est <lb/>

tout seul, et figurez-vous qu'il prend Daniel, lui ouvre la bouche de <lb/>
force et avec une cuiller &#x00E0; th&#x00E9; l'emplit de menu plomb de chasse, mais <lb/>
l'emplit jusqu'au menton, puis il le pose par terre. Smiley pendant <lb/>
ce temps &#x00E9;tait &#x00E0; barboter dans une mare. Finalement il attrape une <lb/>

l'argent, s'en va, et en s'en allant est-ce qu'il ne donne pas un coup de <lb/>

THE FROG JUMPING OF THE COUNTY OF <lb/>
CALAVERAS.</head>
<p>It there was one time here an individual known <lb/>
under the name of Jim Smiley; it was in the winter <lb/>
of '49, possibly well at the spring of '50, I no me <lb/>
<pb n="37"/>
recollect not exactly. This which me makes to be- <lb/>
lieve that it was the one or the other, it is that I <lb/>
shall remember that the grand flume is not achieved <lb/>
when he arrives at the camp for the first time, but <lb/>
of all sides he was the man the most fond of to bet <lb/>
which one have seen, betting upon all that which is <lb/>
presented, when he could find an adversary; and <lb/>
when he not of it could not, he passed to the side <lb/>
opposed. All that which convenienced to the other, <lb/>
to him convenienced also; seeing that he had a bet, <lb/>
Smiley was satisfied. And he had a chance! a <lb/>
chance even worthless; nearly always he gained. <lb/>
It must to say that he was always near to himself <lb/>
expose, but one no could mention the least thing <lb/>
without that this gaillard offered to bet the bottom, <lb/>
no matter what, and to take the side that one him <lb/>
would, as I you it said all at the hour (tout &#x00E0; <lb/>
l'heure). If it there was of races, you him find <lb/>
rich or ruined at the end; if it there is a combat of <lb/>
dogs, he bring his bet; he himself laid always for a <lb/>
combat of cats, for a combat of cocks;&#x2014;by-blue! <lb/>
If you have see two birds upon a fence, he you <lb/>
should have offered of to bet which of those birds <lb/>
shall fly the first; and if there is <i>meeting</i> at the <lb/>
camp (<i>meeting</i> au camp) he comes to bet regularly <lb/>
for the cur&#x00E9; Walker, which he judged to be the best <lb/>
predicator of the neighborhood (pr&#x00E9;dicateur des <lb/>
environs) and which he was in effect, and a brave <lb/>
man He would encounter a bug of wood in the <lb/>
road, whom he will bet upon the time which he <lb/>
<pb n="38"/>
shall take to go where she would go&#x2014;and if you <lb/>
him have take at the word, he will follow the bug as <lb/>
far as Mexique, without himself caring to go so far; <lb/>
neither of the time which he there lost. One time <lb/>
the woman of the cur&#x00E9; Walker is very sick during <lb/>
long time, it seemed that one not her saved not; <lb/>
but one morning the cur&#x00E9; arrives, and Smiley him <lb/>
demanded how she goes, and he said that she is well <lb/>
better, grace to the infinite misery (lui demande <lb/>
comment elle va, et il dit qu'elle est bien mieux, <lb/>
gr&#x00E2;ce &#x00E0; l'infinie mis&#x00E8;ricorde) so much better that with <lb/>
the benediction of the Providence she herself of it <lb/>
would pull out (elle s'en tirerait); and behold that <lb/>
without there thinking Smiley responds: "Well, I <lb/>
gage two-and-half that she will die all of same."</p>
<p>This Smiley had an animal which the boys called <lb/>
the nag of the quarter of hour, but solely for pleas- <lb/>
antry, you comprehend, because, well understand, <lb/>
she was more fast as that! [Now why that excla- <lb/>
mation?&#x2014;M. T.] And it was custom of to gain <lb/>
of the silver with this beast, notwithstanding she <lb/>
was poussive, cornarde, always taken of asthma, of <lb/>
colics or of consumption, or something of approach- <lb/>
ing. One him would give two or three hundred <lb/>
yards at the departure, then one him passed without <lb/>
pain; but never at the last she not fail of herself <lb/>
&#x00E9;chauffer, of herself exasperate, and she arrives her- <lb/>
self &#x00E9;cartant, se d&#x00E8;fendant, her legs gr&#x00EA;les in the air <lb/>
before the obstacles, sometimes them elevating and <lb/>
making with this more of dust than any horse, more <lb/>
<pb n="39"/>
of noise above with his &#x00E9;ternumens and reniflemens <lb/>
&#x2014;crac! she arrives then always first by one head, <lb/>
as just as one can it measure. And he had a small <lb/>
bull dog (boule dogue!) who, to him see, no value, <lb/>
not a cent; one would believe that to bet against <lb/>
him it was to steal, so much he was ordinary; but <lb/>
as soon as the game made, she becomes another <lb/>
dog. Her jaw inferior commence to project like a <lb/>
deck of before, his teeth themselves discover brilliant <lb/>
like some furnaces, and a dog could him tackle (le <lb/>
taquiner), him excite, him murder (le mordre), him <lb/>
throw two or three times over his shoulder, Andr&#x00E9; <lb/>
Jackson&#x2014;this was the name of the dog&#x2014;Andr&#x00E9; <lb/>
Jackson takes that tranquilly, as if he not himself <lb/>
was never expecting other thing, and when the bets <lb/>
were doubled and redoubled against him, he you <lb/>
seize the other dog just at the articulation of the <lb/>
leg of behind, and he not it leave more, not that he <lb/>
it masticate, you conceive, but he himself there shall <lb/>
be holding during until that one throws the sponge <lb/>
in the air, must he wait a year. Smiley gained <lb/>
always with this beast-l&#x00E0;; unhappily they have <lb/>
finished by elevating a dog who no had not of feet <lb/>
of behind, because one them had sawed; and when <lb/>
things were at the point that he would, and that he <lb/>
came to himself throw upon his morsel favorite, the <lb/>
poor dog comprehended in an instant that he him- <lb/>
self was deceived in him, and that the other dog him <lb/>
had. You no have never see person having the air <lb/>
more penaud and more discouraged; he not made <lb/>
<pb n="40"/>
no effort to gain the combat, and was rudely <lb/>
shucked.</p>
<p>Eh bien! this Smiley nourished some terriers &#x00E0; <lb/>
rats, and some cocks of combat, and some cats, and <lb/>
all sorts of things; and with his rage of betting one <lb/>
no had more of repose. He trapped one day a frog <lb/>
and him imported with him (et l'emporta chez lui) <lb/>
saying that he pretended to make his education. <lb/>
You me believe if you will, but during three months <lb/>
he not has nothing done but to him apprehend to <lb/>
jump (apprendre &#x0103; sauter) in a court retired of her <lb/>
mansion (de sa maison). And I you respond that <lb/>
he have succeeded. He him gives a small blow by <lb/>
behind, and the instant after you shall see the frog <lb/>
turn in the air like a grease-biscuit, make one sum- <lb/>
mersault, sometimes two, when she was well started, <lb/>
and re-fall upon his feet like a cat. He him had <lb/>
accomplished in the art of to gobble the flies (gober <lb/>
des mouches), and him there exercised continually <lb/>
&#x2014;so well that a fly at the most far that she ap- <lb/>
peared was a fly lost. Smiley had custom to say <lb/>
that all which lacked to a frog it was the education, <lb/>
but with the education she could do nearly all&#x2014;and <lb/>
I him believe. Tenez, I him have seen pose Daniel <lb/>
Webster there upon this plank&#x2014;Daniel Webster <lb/>
was the name of the frog&#x2014;and to him sing, <lb/>
"Some flies, Daniel, some flies!"&#x2014;in a flash of <lb/>
the eye Daniel had bounded and seized a fly here <lb/>
upon the counter, then jumped anew at the earth, <lb/>
where he rested truly to himself scratch the head <lb/>
<pb n="41"/>
with his behind foot, as if he no had not the least <lb/>
idea of his superiority. Never you not have seen <lb/>
frog as modest, as natural, sweet as she was. And <lb/>
when he himself agitated to jump purely and simply <lb/>
upon plain earth, she does more ground in one <lb/>
jump than any beast of his species than you can <lb/>
know. To jump plain&#x2014;this was his strong. When <lb/>
he himself agitated for that, Smiley multiplied the <lb/>
bets upon her as long as there to him remained a <lb/>
red. It must to know, Smiley was monstrously <lb/>
proud of his frog, and he of it was right, for some <lb/>
men who were traveled, who had all seen, said that <lb/>
they to him would be injurious to him compare to <lb/>
another frog. Smiley guarded Daniel in a little box <lb/>
latticed which he carried bytimes to the village for <lb/>
some bet.</p>
<p>One day an individual stranger at the camp him <lb/>
arrested with his box and him said:</p>
<p>"What is this that you have then shut up there <lb/>
within?"</p>
<p>Smiley said, with an air indifferent:</p>
<p>"That could be a paroquet, or a syringe (ou un <lb/>
serin), but this no is nothing of such, it not is but a <lb/>
frog."</p>
<p>The individual it took, it regarded with care, it <lb/>
turned from one side and from the other, then he <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Tiens! in effect!&#x2014;At what is she good?"</p>
<p>"My God!" respond Smiley, always with an air <lb/>
disengaged, "she is good for one thing, to my <lb/>
<pb n="42"/>
notice (&#x00E0; mon avis), she can batter in jumping (elle <lb/>
peut batter en sautant) all frogs of the county of <lb/>
Calaveras."</p>
<p>The individual re-took the box, it examined of <lb/>
new longly, and it rendered to Smiley in saying <lb/>
with an air deliberate:</p>
<p>"Eh bien! I no saw not that that frog had <lb/>
nothing of better than each frog." (Je ne vois pas <lb/>
que cette grenouille ait rien de mieux qu'aucune <lb/>
grenouille.) [If that isn't grammar gone to seed, <lb/>
then I count myself no judge.&#x2014;M. T.]</p>
<p>"Possible that you not it saw not," said Smiley, <lb/>
"possible that you&#x2014;you comprehend frogs; pos- <lb/>
sible that you not you there comprehend nothing; <lb/>
possible that you had of the experience, and possi- <lb/>
ble that you not be but an amateur. Of all manner <lb/>
(De toute mani&#x00E8;re) I bet forty dollars that she <lb/>
batter in jumping no matter which frog of the <lb/>
county of Calaveras."</p>
<p>The individual reflected a second, and said like sad:</p>
<p>"I not am but a stranger here, I no have not a <lb/>
frog; but if I of it had one, I would embrace the <lb/>
bet."</p>
<p>"Strong well!" respond Smiley; "nothing of <lb/>
more facility. If you will hold my box a minute, I <lb/>
go you to search a frog (j' irai vous chercher)."</p>
<p>Behold, then, the individual, who guards the box, <lb/>
who puts his forty dollars upon those of Smiley, <lb/>
and who attends (et qui attend). He attended <lb/>
enough longtimes, reflecting all solely. And figure <lb/>
<pb n="43"/>
you that he takes Daniel, him opens the mouth by <lb/>
force and with a teaspoon him fills with shot of the <lb/>
hunt, even him fills just to the chin, then he him <lb/>
puts by the earth. Smiley during these times was <lb/>
at slopping in a swamp. Finally he trapped (at- <lb/>
trape) a frog, him carried to that individual, and said:</p>
<p>"Now if you be ready, put him all against <lb/>
Daniel, with their before feet upon the same line, <lb/>
and I give the signal"&#x2014;then he added: "One, <lb/>
two, three&#x2014;advance!"</p>
<p>Him and the individual touched their frogs by <lb/>
behind, and the frog new put to jump smartly, but <lb/>
Daniel himself lifted ponderously, exalted the shoul- <lb/>
ders thus, like a Frenchman&#x2014;to what good? he <lb/>
not could budge, he is planted solid like a church, <lb/>
he not advance no more than if one him had put at <lb/>
the anchor.</p>
<p>Smiley was surprised and disgusted, but he not <lb/>
himself doubted not of the turn being intended <lb/>
(mais il ne se doutait pas du tour, bien entendu). <lb/>
The individual empocketed the silver, himself with <lb/>
it went, and of it himself in going is it that he no <lb/>
gives not a jerk of thumb over the shoulder&#x2014;like <lb/>
that&#x2014;at the poor Daniel, in saying with his air <lb/>
deliberate&#x2014;(L'individu empoche l'argent, s'en va <lb/>
et en s'en allant est ce qu'il ne donne pas un coup de <lb/>
pouce par-dessus l'&#x00E9;paule, comme ca, au pauvre <lb/>
Daniel, endisant de son air d&#x00E9;lib&#x00E9;r&#x00E9;):</p>
<p>"Eh bien! <i>I no see not that that frog has nothing <lb/>
of better than another</i>."</p>
<pb n="44"/>
<p>Smiley himself scratched longtimes the head, the <lb/>
eyes fixed upon Daniel, until that which at last he <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"I me demand how the devil it makes itself that <lb/>
this beast has refused. Is it that she had some- <lb/>
thing? One would believe that she is stuffed."</p>
<p>He grasped Daniel by the skin of the neck, him <lb/>
lifted and said:</p>
<p>"The wolf me bite if he no weigh not five <lb/>
pounds."</p>
<p>He him reversed and the unhappy belched two <lb/>
handfuls of shot (et le malhereus, etc.). When <lb/>
Smiley recognized how it was, he was like mad. <lb/>
He deposited his frog by the earth and ran after <lb/>
that individual, but he not him caught never.</p>
<p>Such is the Jumping Frog, to the distorted French <lb/>
eye. I claim that I never put together such an <lb/>
odious mixture of bad grammar and delirium tre- <lb/>
mens in my life. And what has a poor foreigner <lb/>
like me done, to be abused and misrepresented like <lb/>
this? When I say, "Well, I don't see no p'ints <lb/>
about that frog that's any better'n any other frog," <lb/>
is it kind, is it just, for this Frenchman to try to <lb/>
make it appear that I said, "Eh bien! I no saw <lb/>
not that that frog had nothing of better than each <lb/>
frog?" I have no heart to write more. I never <lb/>
felt so about anything before.</p>

<head><b>JOURNALISM IN TENNESSEE</b><ref target="n5">*</ref><note id="n5" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1871.</p></note></head>
<q>The editor of the Memphis <foreign lang="fre"><i>Avalanche</i></foreign> swoops thus mildly down <lb/>
upon a correspondent who posted him as a Radical:&#x2014;"While he was <lb/>
writing the first word, the middle, dotting his i's, crossing his t's, and <lb/>
punching his period, he knew he was concocting a sentence that was <lb/>
saturated with infamy and reeking with falsehood."&#x2014;<i>Exchange</i>.</q>
<p><smcap>I was</smcap> told by the physician that a Southern <lb/>
climate would improve my health, and so I went <lb/>
down to Tennessee, and got a berth on the <i>Morning <lb/>
Glory and Johnson County War-Whoop</i> as associate <lb/>
editor. When I went on duty I found the chief <lb/>
editor sitting tilted back in a three-legged chair with <lb/>
his feet on a pine table. There was another pine <lb/>
table in the room and another afflicted chair, and <lb/>
both were half buried under newspapers and scraps <lb/>
and sheets of manuscript. There was a wooden <lb/>
box of sand, sprinkled with cigar stubs and "old <lb/>
soldiers," and a stove with a door hanging by its <lb/>
upper hinge. The chief editor had a long-tailed <lb/>
black cloth frock coat on, and white linen pants. <lb/>
His boots were small and neatly blacked. He wore <lb/>
a ruffled shirt, a large seal ring, a standing collar of <lb/>
<pb n="46"/>
obsolete pattern, and a checkered neckerchief with <lb/>
the ends hanging down. Date of costume about <lb/>
1848. He was smoking a cigar, and trying to think <lb/>
of a word, and in pawing his hair he had rumpled <lb/>
his locks a good deal. He was scowling fearfully, <lb/>
and I judged that he was concocting a particularly <lb/>
knotty editorial. He told me to take the exchanges <lb/>
and skim through them and write up the "Spirit of <lb/>
the Tennessee Press," condensing into the article all <lb/>
of their contents that seemed of interest.</p>
<p>I wrote as follows: <lb/>
<q>"<smcap>spirit of the tennessee press</smcap>.</q>
<q>"The editors of the <i>Semi-Weekly Earthquake</i> evidently labor under <lb/>
a misapprehension with regard to the Ballyhack railroad. It is not the <lb/>
object of the company to leave Buzzardville off to one side. On the <lb/>
contrary, they consider it one of the most important points along the <lb/>
line, and consequently can have no desire to slight it. The gentlemen <lb/>
of the <i>Earthquake</i> will, of course, take pleasure in making the correction.</q>
<q>"John W. Blossom, Esq., the able editor of the Higginsville <lb/>
<i>Thunderbolt and Battle Cry of Freedom</i>, arrived in the city yesterday. <lb/>
He is stopping at the Van Buren House.</q>
<q>"We observe that our contemporary of the Mud Springs <i>Morning <lb/>
Howl</i> has fallen into the error of supposing that the election of Van <lb/>
Werter is not an established fact, but he will have discovered his <lb/>
mistake before this reminder reaches him, no doubt. He was doubtless <lb/>
misled by incomplete election returns.</q>
<q>"It is pleasant to note that the city of Blathersville is endeavoring <lb/>
to contract with some New York gentlemen to pave its well-nigh im- <lb/>
passable streets with the Nicholson pavement. The <i>Daily Hurrah</i> <lb/>
urges the measure with ability, and seems confident of ultimate success."</q></p>
<p>I passed my manuscript over to the chief editor <lb/>
for acceptance, alteration, or destruction. He <lb/>
glanced at it and his face clouded. He ran his <lb/>
<pb n="47"/>
eye down the pages, and his countenance grew por- <lb/>
tentous. It was easy to see that something was <lb/>
wrong. Presently he sprang up and said:</p>
<p>"Thunder and lightning! Do you suppose I am <lb/>
going to speak of those cattle that way? Do you <lb/>
suppose my subscribers are going to stand such <lb/>
gruel as that? Give me the pen!"</p>
<p>I never saw a pen scrape and scratch its way so <lb/>
viciously, or plow through another man's verbs and <lb/>
adjectives so relentlessly. While he was in the midst <lb/>
of his work, somebody shot at him through the <lb/>
open window, and marred the symmetry of my ear.</p>
<p>"Ah," said he, "that is that scoundrel Smith, <lb/>
of the <i>Moral Volcano</i>&#x2014;he was due yesterday." <lb/>
And he snatched a navy revolver from his belt and <lb/>
fired. Smith dropped, shot in the thigh. The shot <lb/>
spoiled Smith's aim, who was just taking a second <lb/>
chance, and he crippled a stranger. It was me. <lb/>
Merely a finger shot off.</p>
<p>Then the chief editor went on with his erasures <lb/>
and interlineations. Just as he finished them a hand- <lb/>
grenade came down the stove pipe, and the explo- <lb/>
sion shivered the stove into a thousand fragments. <lb/>
However, it did no further damage, except that a <lb/>
vagrant piece knocked a couple of my teeth out.</p>
<p>"That stove is utterly ruined," said the chief <lb/>
editor.</p>
<p>I said I believed it was.</p>
<p>"Well, no matter&#x2014;don't want it this kind of <lb/>
weather. I know the man that did it. I'll get <lb/>
<pb n="48"/>
him. Now, <i>here</i> is the way this stuff ought to be <lb/>
written."</p>
<p>I took the manuscript. It was scarred with era- <lb/>
sures and interlineations till its mother wouldn't have <lb/>
known it if had had one. It now read as follows: <lb/>
<q>"<smcap>spir't of the tennessee press.</smcap></q>
<q>"The inveterate liars of the <i>Semi-Weekly Earthquake</i> are evidently <lb/>
endeavoring to palm off upon a noble and chivalrous people another of <lb/>
their vile and brutal falsehoods with regard to that most glorious concep- <lb/>
tion of the nineteenth century, the Ballyhack railroad. The idea that <lb/>
Buzzardville was to be left off at one side originated in their own ful- <lb/>
some brains&#x2014;or rather in the settlings which <i>they</i> regard as brains. <lb/>
They had better swallow this lie if they want to save their abandoned <lb/>
reptile carcasses the cowhiding they so richly deserve.</q>
<q>"That ass, Blossom, of the Higginsville <i>Thunderbolt and Battle <lb/>
Cry of Freedom</i>, is down here again sponging at the Van Buren.</q>
<q>"We observe that the besotted blackguard of the Mud Spring <lb/>
<i>Morning Howl</i> is giving out, with his usual propensity for lying, that <lb/>
Van Werter is not elected. The heaven-born mission of journalism is <lb/>
to disseminate truth; to eradicate error; to educate, refine, and elevate <lb/>
the tone of public morals and manners, and make all men more gentle, <lb/>
more virtuous, more charitable, and in all ways better, and holier, and <lb/>
happier; and yet this black-hearted scoundrel degrades his great office <lb/>
persistently to the dissemination of falsehood, calumny, vituperation, <lb/>
and vulgarity.</q>
<q>"Blathersville wants a Nicholson pavement&#x2014;it wants a jail and a <lb/>
poorhouse more. The idea of a pavement in a one-horse town com- <lb/>
posed of two gin mills, a blacksmith shop, and that mustard-plaster of <lb/>
a newspaper, the <i>Daily Hurrah!</i> The crawling insect, Buckner, who <lb/>
edits the <i>Hurrah</i>, is braying about this business with his customary <lb/>
imbecility, and imagining that he is talking sense."</q></p>
<p>"Now <i>that</i> is the way to write&#x2014;peppery and to <lb/>
the point. Mush-and-milk journalism gives me the <lb/>
fan-tods."</p>
<pb n="49"/>
<p>About this time a brick came through the window <lb/>
with a splintering crash, and gave me a considerable <lb/>
of a jolt in the back. I moved out of range&#x2014;I <lb/>
began to feel in the way.</p>
<p>The chief said, "That was the Colonel, likely. <lb/>
I've been expecting him for two days. He will be <lb/>
up now right away."</p>
<p>He was correct. The Colonel appeared in the <lb/>
door a moment afterward with a dragoon revolver in <lb/>
his hand.</p>
<p>He said, "Sir, have I the honor of addressing the <lb/>
poltroon who edits this mangy sheet?"</p>
<p>"You have. Be seated, sir. Be careful of the <lb/>
chair, one of its legs is gone. I believe I have the <lb/>
honor of addressing the putrid liar, Colonel Blather- <lb/>
skite Tecumseh?"</p>
<p>"Right, sir. I have a little account to settle with <lb/>
you. If you are at leisure we will begin."</p>
<p>"I have an article on the 'Encouraging Progress <lb/>
of Moral and Intellectual Development in America' <lb/>
to finish, but there is no hurry. Begin."</p>
<p>Both pistols rang out their fierce clamor at the <lb/>
same instant. The chief lost a lock of his hair, and <lb/>
the Colonel's bullet ended its career in the fleshy <lb/>
part of my thigh. The Colonel's left shoulder was <lb/>
clipped a little. They fired again. Both missed <lb/>
their men this time, but I got my share, a shot in <lb/>
the arm. At the third fire both gentlemen were <lb/>
wounded slightly, and I had a knuckle chipped. I <lb/>
then said, I believed I would go out and take a <lb/>
<pb n="50"/>
walk, as this was a private matter, and I had a <lb/>
delicacy about participating in it further. But both <lb/>
gentlemen begged me to keep my seat, and assured <lb/>
me that I was not in the way.</p>
<p>They then talked about the elections and the crops <lb/>
while they reloaded, and I fell to tying up my <lb/>
wounds. But presently they opened fire again with <lb/>
animation, and every shot took effect&#x2014;but it is <lb/>
proper to remark that five out of the six fell to my <lb/>
share. The sixth one mortally wounded the Colonel, <lb/>
who remarked, with fine humor, that he would have <lb/>
to say good morning now, as he had business up <lb/>
town. He then inquired the way to the undertaker's <lb/>
and left.</p>
<p>The chief turned to me and said, "I am expect- <lb/>
ing company to dinner, and shall have to get ready. <lb/>
It will be a favor to me if you will read proof and <lb/>
attend to the customers."</p>
<p>I winced a little at the idea of attending to the <lb/>
customers, but I was too bewildered by the fusillade <lb/>
that was still ringing in my ears to think of anything <lb/>
to say.</p>
<p>He continued, "Jones will be here at 3&#x2014;cow- <lb/>
hide him. Gillespie will call earlier, perhaps&#x2014; <lb/>
throw him out of the window. Ferguson will be <lb/>
along about 4&#x2014;kill him. That is all for to-day, I <lb/>
believe. If you have any odd time, you may write <lb/>
a blistering article on the police&#x2014;give the chief <lb/>
inspector rats. The cowhides are under the table; <lb/>
weapons in the drawer&#x2014;ammunition there in the <lb/>
<pb n="51"/>
corner&#x2014;lint and bandages up there in the pigeon- <lb/>
holes. In case of accident, go to <foreign lang="spa">Lancet,</foreign> the sur- <lb/>
geon, downstairs. He advertises&#x2014;we take it out <lb/>
in trade."</p>
<p>He was gone. I shuddered. At the end of the <lb/>
next three hours I had been through perils so awful <lb/>
that all peace of mind and all cheerfulness were <lb/>
gone from me. Gillespie had called and thrown <i>me</i> <lb/>
out of the window. Jones arrived promptly, and <lb/>
when I got ready to do the cowhiding he took the <lb/>
job off my hands. In an encounter with a stranger, <lb/>
not in the bill of fare, I had lost my scalp. Another <lb/>
stranger, by the name of Thompson, left me a mere <lb/>
wreck and ruin of chaotic rags. And at last, at bay <lb/>
in the corner, and beset by an infuriated mob of <lb/>
editors, blacklegs, politicians, and desperadoes, who <lb/>
raved and swore and flourished their weapons about <lb/>
my head till the air shimmered with glancing flashes <lb/>
of steel, I was in the act of resigning my berth on <lb/>
the paper when the chief arrived, and with him a <lb/>
rabble of charmed and enthusiastic friends. Then <lb/>
ensued a scene of riot and carnage such as no human <lb/>
pen, or steel one either, could describe. People <lb/>
were shot, probed, dismembered, blown up, thrown <lb/>
out of the window. There was a brief tornado of <lb/>
murky blasphemy, with a confused and frantic war- <lb/>
dance glimmering through it, and then all was over. <lb/>
In five minutes there was silence, and the gory chief <lb/>
and I sat alone and surveyed the sanguinary ruin <lb/>
that strewed the floor around us.</p>
<pb n="52"/>
<p>He said, "You'll like this place when you get <lb/>
used to it."</p>
<p>I said, "I'll have to get you to excuse me; I <lb/>
think maybe I might write to suit you after a while; <lb/>
as soon as I had had some practice and learned the <lb/>
language I am confident I could. But, to speak the <lb/>
plain truth, that sort of energy of expression has its <lb/>
inconveniences, and a man is liable to interruption. <lb/>
You see that yourself. Vigorous writing is calcu- <lb/>
lated to elevate the public, no doubt, but then I do <lb/>
not like to attract so much attention as it calls forth. <lb/>
I can't write with comfort when I am interrupted so <lb/>
much as I have been to-day. I like this berth well <lb/>
enough, but I don't like to be left here to wait on <lb/>
the customers. The experiences are novel, I grant <lb/>
you, and entertaining, too, after a fashion, but they <lb/>
are not judiciously distributed. A gentleman shoots <lb/>
at you through the window and cripples <i>me;</i> a <lb/>
bomb-shell comes down the stove-pipe for your <lb/>
gratification and sends the stove door down <i>my</i> <lb/>
throat; a friend drops in to swap compliments with <lb/>
you, and freckles <i>me</i> with bullet-holes till my skin <lb/>
won't hold my principles; you go to dinner, and <lb/>
Jones comes with his cowhide, Gillespie throws me <lb/>
out of the window, Thompson tears all my clothes <lb/>
off, and an entire stranger takes my scalp with the <lb/>
easy freedom of an old acquaintance; and in less <lb/>
than five minutes all the blackguards in the country <lb/>
arrive in their war-paint, and proceed to scare the <lb/>
rest of me to death with their tomahawks. Take it <lb/>
<pb n="53"/>
altogether, I never had such a spirited time in all <lb/>
my life as I have had to-day. No; I like you, and <lb/>
I like your calm unruffled way of explaining things <lb/>
to the customers, but you see I am not used to it. <lb/>
The Southern heart is too impulsive; Southern hos- <lb/>
pitality is too lavish with the stranger. The para- <lb/>
graphs which I have written to-day, and into whose <lb/>
cold sentences your masterly hand has infused the <lb/>
fervent spirit of Tennessean journalism, will wake up <lb/>
another nest of hornets. All that mob of editors <lb/>
will come&#x2014;and they will come hungry, too, and <lb/>
want somebody for breakfast. I shall have to bid <lb/>
you adieu. I decline to be present at these festivi- <lb/>
ties. I came South for my health, I will go back <lb/>
on the same errand, and suddenly. Tennesseean <lb/>
journalism is too stirring for me."</p>
<p>After which we parted with mutual regret, and I <lb/>
took apartments at the hospital.</p>

<head><b>STORY OF THE BAD LITTLE BOY</b><ref target="n6">*</ref><note id="n6" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1865.</p></note></head>
<p><smcap>Once</smcap> there was a bad little boy whose name was <lb/>
Jim&#x2014;though, if you will notice, you will find <lb/>
that bad little boys are nearly always called James in <lb/>
your Sunday-school books. It was strange, but still <lb/>
it was true, that this one was called Jim.</p>
<p>He didn't have any sick mother, either&#x2014;a sick <lb/>
mother who was pious and had the consumption, <lb/>
and would be glad to lie down in the grave and be <lb/>
at rest but for the strong love she bore her boy, and <lb/>
the anxiety she felt that the world might be harsh <lb/>
and cold towards him when she was gone. Most <lb/>
bad boys in the Sunday books are named James, <lb/>
and have sick mothers, who teach them to say, <lb/>
"Now, I lay me down," etc., and sing them to <lb/>
sleep with sweet, plaintive voices, and then kiss them <lb/>
good night, and kneel down by the bedside and <lb/>
weep. But it was different with this fellow. He <lb/>
was named Jim, and there wasn't anything the <lb/>
matter with his mother&#x2014;no consumption, nor any- <lb/>
thing of that kind. She was rather stout than other- <lb/>
wise, and she was not pious; moreover, she was not <lb/>
anxious on Jim's account. She said if he were to <lb/>
<pb n="55"/>
break his neck it wouldn't be much loss. She always <lb/>
spanked Jim to sleep, and she never kissed him good <lb/>
night; on the contrary, she boxed his ears when she <lb/>
was ready to leave him.</p>
<p>Once this little bad boy stole the key of the <lb/>
pantry, and slipped in there and helped himself to <lb/>
some jam, and filled up the vessel with tar, so that <lb/>
his mother would never know the difference; but all <lb/>
at once a terrible feeling didn't come over him, and <lb/>
something didn't seem to whisper to him, "Is it <lb/>
right to disobey my mother? Isn't it sinful to do <lb/>
this? Where do bad little boys go who gobble up <lb/>
their good kind mother's jam?" and then he didn't <lb/>
kneel down all alone and promise never to be wicked <lb/>
any more, and rise up with a light, happy heart, and <lb/>
go and tell his mother all about it, and beg her for- <lb/>
giveness, and be blessed by her with tears of pride <lb/>
and thankfulness in her eyes. No; that is the way <lb/>
with all other bad boys in the books; but it hap- <lb/>
pened otherwise with this Jim, strangely enough. <lb/>
He ate that jam, and said it was bully, in his sinful, <lb/>
vulgar way; and he put in the tar, and said that was <lb/>
bully also, and laughed, and observed "that the old <lb/>
woman would get up and snort" when she found it <lb/>
out; and when she did find it out, he denied know- <lb/>
ing anything about it, and she whipped him severely, <lb/>
and he did the crying himself. Everything about <lb/>
this boy was curious&#x2014;everything turned out differ- <lb/>
ently with him from the way it does to the bad <lb/>
Jameses in the books.</p>
<pb n="56"/>
<p>Once he climbed up in Farmer Acorn's apple <lb/>
tree to steal apples, and the limb didn't break, and <lb/>
he didn't fall and break his arm, and get torn by the <lb/>
farmer's great dog, and then languish on a sick bed <lb/>
for weeks, and repent and become good. Oh, no; <lb/>
he stole as many apples as he wanted and came <lb/>
down all right; and he was all ready for the dog, <lb/>
too, and knocked him endways with a brick when he <lb/>
came to tear him. It was very strange&#x2014;nothing <lb/>
like it ever happened in those mild little books with <lb/>
marbled backs, and with pictures in them of men <lb/>
with swallow-tailed coats and bell-crowned hats, <lb/>
and pantaloons that are short in the legs, and women <lb/>
with the waists of their dresses under their arms, <lb/>
and no hoops on. Nothing like it in any of the <lb/>
Sunday-school books.</p>
<p>Once he stole the teacher's penknife, and, when <lb/>
he was afraid it would be found out and he would <lb/>
get whipped, he slipped it into George Wilson's cap <lb/>
&#x2014;poor Widow Wilson's son, the moral boy, the <lb/>
good little boy of the village, who always obeyed <lb/>
his mother, and never told an untruth, and was fond <lb/>
of his lessons, and infatuated with Sunday-school. <lb/>
And when the knife dropped from the cap, and poor <lb/>
George hung his head and blushed, as if in con- <lb/>
scious guilt, and the grieved teacher charged the <lb/>
theft upon him, and was just in the very act of <lb/>
bringing the switch down upon his trembling shoul- <lb/>
ders, a white-haired, improbable justice of the peace <lb/>
did not suddenly appear in their midst, and strike an <lb/>
<pb n="57"/>
attitude and say, "Spare this noble boy&#x2014;there <lb/>
stands the cowering culprit! I was passing the <lb/>
school door at recess, and, unseen myself, I saw the <lb/>
theft committed!" And then Jim didn't get whaled, <lb/>
and the venerable justice didn't read the tearful <lb/>
school a homily, and take George by the hand and <lb/>
say such a boy deserved to be exalted, and then tell <lb/>
him to come and make his home with him, and <lb/>
sweep out the office, and make fires, and run errands, <lb/>
and chop wood, and study law, and help his wife do <lb/>
household labors, and have all the balance of the <lb/>
time to play, and get forty cents a month, and be <lb/>
happy. No; it would have happened that way in <lb/>
the books, but it didn't happen that way to Jim. <lb/>
No meddling old clam of a justice dropped in to <lb/>
make trouble, and so the model boy George got <lb/>
thrashed, and Jim was glad of it because, you know, <lb/>
Jim hated moral boys. Jim said he was "down on <lb/>
them milksops." Such was the coarse language of <lb/>
this bad, neglected boy.</p>
<p>But the strangest thing that ever happened to Jim <lb/>
was the time he went boating on Sunday, and didn't <lb/>
get drowned, and that other time that he got caught <lb/>
out in the storm when he was fishing on Sunday, <lb/>
and didn't get struck by lightning. Why, you might <lb/>
look, and look, all through the Sunday-school books <lb/>
from now till next Christmas, and you would never <lb/>
come across anything like this. Oh, no; you would <lb/>
find that all the bad boys who go boating on Sunday <lb/>
invariably get drowned; and all the bad boys who <lb/>
<pb n="58"/>
get caught out in storms when they are fishing on <lb/>
Sunday infallibly get struck by lightning. Boats <lb/>
with bad boys in them always upset on Sunday, and <lb/>
it always storms when bad boys go fishing on the <lb/>
Sabbath. How this Jim ever escaped is a mystery <lb/>
to me.</p>
<p>This Jim bore a charmed life&#x2014;that must have <lb/>
been the way of it. Nothing could hurt him. He <lb/>
even gave the elephant in the menagerie a plug of <lb/>
tobacco, and the elephant didn't knock the top of <lb/>
his head off with his trunk. He browsed around the <lb/>
cupboard after essence of peppermint, and didn't <lb/>
make a mistake and drink <i>aqua fortis</i>. He stole his <lb/>
father's gun and went hunting on the Sabbath, and <lb/>
didn't shoot three or four of his fingers off. He <lb/>
struck his little sister on the temple with his fist <lb/>
when he was angry, and she didn't linger in pain <lb/>
through long summer days, and die with sweet words <lb/>
of forgiveness upon her lips that redoubled the <lb/>
anguish of his breaking heart. No; she got over <lb/>
it. He ran off and went to sea at last, and didn't <lb/>
come back and find himself sad and alone in the <lb/>
world, his loved ones sleeping in the quiet church- <lb/>
yard, and the vine-embowered home of his boyhood <lb/>
tumbled down and gone to decay. Ah, no; he <lb/>
came home as drunk as a piper, and got into the <lb/>
station-house the first thing.</p>
<p>And he grew up and married, and raised a large <lb/>
family, and brained them all with an axe one night, <lb/>
and got wealthy by all manner of cheating and ras- <lb/>
<pb n="59"/>
cality; and now he is the infernalest wickedest <lb/>
scoundrel in his native village, and is universally <lb/>
respected, and belongs to the legislature.</p>
<p>So you see there never was a bad James in the <lb/>
Sunday-school books that had such a streak of luck <lb/>
as this sinful Jim with the charmed life.</p>

<head><b>THE STORY OF THE GOOD LITTLE <lb/>
BOY</b><ref target="n7">*</ref><note id="n7" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1865.</p></note></head>
<p><smcap>Once</smcap> there was a good little boy by the name of <lb/>
Jacob Blivens. He always obeyed his parents, <lb/>
no matter how absurd and unreasonable their de- <lb/>
mands were; and he always learned his book, and <lb/>
never was late at Sabbath-school. He would not <lb/>
play hookey, even when his sober judgment told <lb/>
him it was the most profitable thing he could do. <lb/>
None of the other boys could ever make that boy <lb/>
out, he acted so strangely. He wouldn't lie, no <lb/>
matter how convenient it was. He just said it was <lb/>
wrong to lie, and that was sufficient for him. And <lb/>
he was so honest that he was simply ridiculous. The <lb/>
curious ways that that Jacob had, surpassed every- <lb/>
thing. He wouldn't play marbles on Sunday, he <lb/>
wouldn't rob birds' nests, he wouldn't give hot pen- <lb/>
nies to organ-grinders' monkeys; he didn't seem to <lb/>
take any interest in any kind of rational amusement. <lb/>
So the other boys used to try to reason it out and <lb/>
come to an understanding of him, but they couldn't <lb/>
arrive at any satisfactory conclusion. As I said be- <lb/>
<pb n="61"/>
fore, they could only figure out a sort of vague idea <lb/>
that he was "afflicted," and so they took him under <lb/>
their protection, and never allowed any harm to <lb/>
come to him.</p>
<p>This good little boy read all the Sunday-school <lb/>
books; they were his greatest delight. This was the <lb/>
whole secret of it. He believed in the good little <lb/>
boys they put in the Sunday-school books; he had <lb/>
every confidence in them. He longed to come <lb/>
across one of them alive once; but he never did. <lb/>
They all died before his time, maybe. Whenever <lb/>
he read about a particularly good one he turned over <lb/>
quickly to the end to see what became of him, be- <lb/>
cause he wanted to travel thousands of miles and <lb/>
gaze on him; but it wasn't any use; that good little <lb/>
boy always died in the last chapter, and there was a <lb/>
picture of the funeral, with all his relations and the <lb/>
Sunday-school children standing around the grave in <lb/>
pantaloons that were too short, and bonnets that <lb/>
were too large, and everybody crying into handker- <lb/>
chiefs that had as much as a yard and a half of <lb/>
stuff in them. He was always headed off in this <lb/>
way. He never could see one of those good little <lb/>
boys on account of his always dying in the last <lb/>
chapter.</p>
<p>Jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday- <lb/>
school book. He wanted to be put in, with pictures <lb/>
representing him gloriously declining to lie to his <lb/>
mother, and her weeping for joy about it; and pic- <lb/>
tures representing him standing on the doorstep <lb/>
<pb n="62"/>
giving a penny to a poor beggar-woman with six <lb/>
children, and telling her to spend it freely, but not <lb/>
to be extravagant, because extravagance is a sin; <lb/>
and pictures of him magnanimously refusing to tell <lb/>
on the bad boy who always lay in wait for him <lb/>
around the corner as he came from school, and <lb/>
welted him over the head with a lath, and then <lb/>
chased him home, saying, "Hi! hi!" as he pro- <lb/>
ceeded. That was the ambition of young Jacob <lb/>
Blivens. He wished to be put in a Sunday-school <lb/>
book. It made him feel a little uncomfortable some- <lb/>
times when he reflected that the good little boys <lb/>
always died. He loved to live, you know, and this <lb/>
was the most unpleasant feature about being a <lb/>
Sunday-school book boy. He knew it was not <lb/>
healthy to be good. He knew it was more fatal <lb/>
than consumption to be so supernaturally good as <lb/>
the boys in the books were; he knew that none of <lb/>
them had ever been able to stand it long, and it <lb/>
pained him to think that if they put him in a book <lb/>
he wouldn't ever see it, or even if they did get the <lb/>
book out before he died it wouldn't be popular <lb/>
without any picture of his funeral in the back part <lb/>
of it. It couldn't be much of a Sunday-school book <lb/>
that couldn't tell about the advice he gave to the <lb/>
community when he was dying. So at last, of <lb/>
course, he had to make up his mind to do the best <lb/>
he could under the circumstances&#x2014;to live right, <lb/>
and hang on as long as he could, and have his dying <lb/>
speech all ready when his time came.</p>
<pb n="63"/>
<p>But somehow nothing ever went right with this <lb/>
good little boy; nothing ever turned out with him <lb/>
the way it turned out with the good little boys in the <lb/>
books. They always had a good time, and the bad <lb/>
boys had the broken legs; but in his case there was <lb/>
a screw loose somewhere, and it all happened just <lb/>
the other way. When he found Jim Blake stealing <lb/>
apples, and went under the tree to read to him about <lb/>
the bad little boy who fell out of a neighbor's apple <lb/>
tree and broke his arm, Jim fell out of the tree, too, <lb/>
but he fell on <i>him</i> and broke <i>his</i> arm, and Jim <lb/>
wasn't hurt at all. Jacob couldn't understand that. <lb/>
There wasn't anything in the books like it.</p>
<p>And once, when some bad boys pushed a blind <lb/>
man over in the mud, and Jacob ran to help him <lb/>
up and receive his blessing, the blind man did <lb/>
not give him any blessing at all, but whacked him <lb/>
over the head with his stick and said he would like <lb/>
to catch him shoving <i>him</i> again, and then pretend- <lb/>
ing to help him up. This was not in accordance <lb/>
with any of the books. Jacob looked them all over <lb/>
to see.</p>
<p>One thing that Jacob wanted to do was to find a <lb/>
lame dog that hadn't any place to stay, and was <lb/>
hungry and persecuted, and bring him home and <lb/>
pet him and have that dog's imperishable gratitude. <lb/>
And at last he found one and was happy; and he <lb/>
brought him home and fed him, but when he was <lb/>
going to pet him the dog flew at him and tore all the <lb/>
clothes off him except those that were in front, and <lb/>
<pb n="64"/>
made a spectacle of him that was astonishing. He <lb/>
examined authorities, but he could not understand <lb/>
the matter. It was of the same breed of dogs that <lb/>
was in the books, but it acted very differently. <lb/>
Whatever this boy did he got into trouble. The <lb/>
very things the boys in the books got rewarded for <lb/>
turned out to be about the most unprofitable things <lb/>
he could invest in.</p>
<p>Once, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, <lb/>
he saw some bad boys starting off pleasuring in a <lb/>
sailboat. He was filled with consternation, because <lb/>
he knew from his reading that boys who went sailing <lb/>
on Sunday invariably got drowned. So he ran out <lb/>
on a raft to warn them, but a log turned with him <lb/>
and slid him into the river. A man got him out <lb/>
pretty soon, and the doctor pumped the water out <lb/>
of him, and gave him a fresh start with his bellows, <lb/>
but he caught cold and lay sick abed nine weeks. <lb/>
But the most unaccountable thing about it was that <lb/>
the bad boys in the boat had a good time all day, <lb/>
and then reached home alive and well in the most <lb/>
surprising manner. Jacob Blivens said there was <lb/>
nothing like these things in the books. He was <lb/>
perfectly dumbfounded.</p>
<p>When he got well he was a little discouraged, but <lb/>
he resolved to keep on trying anyhow. He knew <lb/>
that so far his experiences wouldn't do to go in a <lb/>
book, but he hadn't yet reached the allotted term of <lb/>
life for good little boys, and he hoped to be able to <lb/>
make a record yet if he could hold on till his time <lb/>
<pb n="65"/>
was fully up. If everything else failed he had his <lb/>
dying speech to fall back on.</p>
<p>He examined his authorities, and found that it <lb/>
was now time for him to go to sea as a cabin-boy. <lb/>
He called on a ship captain and made his application, <lb/>
and when the captain asked for his recommenda- <lb/>
tions he proudly drew out a tract and pointed to the <lb/>
words, "To Jacob Blivens, from his affectionate <lb/>
teacher." But the captain was a coarse, vulgar man, <lb/>
and he said, "Oh, that be blowed! <i>that</i> wasn't any <lb/>
proof that he knew how to wash dishes or handle a <lb/>
slush-bucket, and he guessed he didn't want him." <lb/>
This was altogether the most extraordinary thing <lb/>
that ever happened to Jacob in all his life. A <lb/>
compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had never <lb/>
failed to move the tenderest emotions of ship <lb/>
captains, and open the way to all offices of honor <lb/>
and profit in their gift&#x2014;it never had in any book <lb/>
that ever <i>he</i> had read. He could hardly believe his <lb/>
senses.</p>
<p>This boy always had a hard time of it. Nothing <lb/>
ever came out according to the authorities with him. <lb/>
At last, one day, when he was around hunting up <lb/>
bad little boys to admonish, he found a lot of them <lb/>
in the old iron foundry fixing up a little joke on <lb/>
fourteen or fifteen dogs, which they had tied to- <lb/>
gether in long procession, and were going to orna- <lb/>
ment with empty nitro-glycerine cans made fast to <lb/>
their tails. Jacob's heart was touched. He sat <lb/>
down on one of those cans (for he never minded <lb/>
<pb n="66"/>
grease when duty was before him), and he took <lb/>
hold of the foremost dog by the collar, and turned <lb/>
his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones. But <lb/>
just at that moment Alderman McWelter, full of <lb/>
wrath, stepped in. All the bad boys ran away, but <lb/>
Jacob Blivens rose in conscious innocence and began <lb/>
one of those stately little Sunday-school book <lb/>
speeches which always commence with "Oh, sir!" <lb/>
in dead opposition to the fact that no boy, good or <lb/>
bad, ever starts a remark with "Oh, sir." But the <lb/>
alderman never waited to hear the rest. He took <lb/>
Jacob Blivens by the ear and turned him around, <lb/>
and hit him a whack in the rear with the flat of his <lb/>
hand; and in an instant that good little boy shot out <lb/>
through the roof and soared away toward the sun, <lb/>
with the fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing <lb/>
after him like the tail of a kite. And there wasn't a <lb/>
sign of that alderman or that old iron foundry left <lb/>
on the face of the earth; and, as for young Jacob <lb/>
Blivens, he never got a chance to make his last <lb/>
dying speech after all his trouble fixing it up, unless <lb/>
he made it to the birds; because, although the bulk <lb/>
of him came down all right in a tree-top in an ad- <lb/>
joining county, the rest of him was apportioned <lb/>
around among four townships, and so they had to <lb/>
hold five inquests on him to find out whether he was <lb/>
dead or not, and how it occurred. You never saw <lb/>
a boy scattered so.<ref target="n8">*</ref><note id="n8" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>This glycerine catastrophe is borrowed from a floating newspaper <lb/>
item, whose author's name I would give if I knew it.&#x2014;[M. T.]</p></note></p>
<pb n="67"/>
<p>Thus perished the good little boy who did the <lb/>
best he could, but didn't come out according to the <lb/>
books. Every boy who ever did as he did pros- <lb/>
pered except him. His case is truly remarkable. <lb/>
It will probably never be accounted for.</p>

<head><b>NIAGARA</b><ref target="n10">*</ref><note id="n10" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1871.</p></note></head>
<p><smcap>Niagara falls</smcap> is a most enjoyable place of <lb/>
resort. The hotels are excellent, and the <lb/>
prices not at all exorbitant. The opportunities for <lb/>
fishing are not surpassed in the country; in fact, <lb/>
they are not even equaled elsewhere. Because, in <lb/>
other localities, certain places in the streams are <lb/>
much better than others; but at Niagara one place <lb/>
is just as good as another, for the reason that the <lb/>
fish do not bite anywhere, and so there is no use in <lb/>
your walking five miles to fish, when you can de- <lb/>
pend on being just as unsuccessful nearer home. <lb/>
The advantages of this state of things have never <lb/>
heretofore been properly placed before the public.</p>
<p>The weather is cool in summer, and the walks and <lb/>
drives are all pleasant and none of them fatiguing. <lb/>
When you start out to "do" the Falls you first <lb/>
drive down about a mile, and pay a small sum for <lb/>
the privilege of looking down from a precipice into <lb/>
the narrowest part of the Niagara river. A rail- <lb/>
way "cut" through a hill would be as comely if it <lb/>
had the angry river tumbling and foaming through <lb/>
<pb n="71"/>
its bottom. You can descend a staircase here a <lb/>
hundred and fifty feet down, and stand at the edge <lb/>
of the water. After you have done it, you will <lb/>
wonder why you did it; but you will then be too late.</p>
<p>The guide will explain to you, in his blood- <lb/>
curdling way, how he saw the little steamer, <i>Maid <lb/>
of the Mist</i>, descend the fearful rapids&#x2014;how first <lb/>
one paddle-box was out of sight behind the raging <lb/>
billows and then the other, and at what point it was <lb/>
that her smokestack toppled overboard, and where <lb/>
her planking began to break and part asunder&#x2014; <lb/>
and how she did finally live through the trip, after <lb/>
accomplishing the incredible feat of traveling seven- <lb/>
teen miles in six minutes, or six miles in seventeen <lb/>
minutes, I have really forgotten which. But it was <lb/>
very extraordinary, anyhow. It is worth the price <lb/>
of admission to hear the guide tell the story nine <lb/>
times in succession to different parties, and never <lb/>
miss a word or alter a sentence or a gesture.</p>
<p>Then you drive over to Suspension Bridge, and <lb/>
divide your misery between the chances of smashing <lb/>
down two hundred feet into the river below, and the <lb/>
chances of having the railway train overhead smash- <lb/>
ing down on to you. Either possibility is discom- <lb/>
forting taken by itself, but, mixed together, they <lb/>
amount in the aggregate to positive unhappiness.</p>
<p>On the Canada side you drive along the chasm <lb/>
between long ranks of photographers standing guard <lb/>
behind their cameras, ready to make an ostentatious <lb/>
frontispiece of you and your decaying ambulance, <lb/>
<pb n="72"/>
and your solemn crate with a hide on it, which you <lb/>
are expected to regard in the light of a horse, and a <lb/>
diminished and unimportant background of sublime <lb/>
Niagara; and a great many people <i>have</i> the incredi- <lb/>
ble effrontery or the native depravity to aid and abet <lb/>
this sort of crime.</p>
<p>Any day, in the hands of these photographers, <lb/>
you may see stately pictures of papa and mamma, <lb/>
Johnny and Bub and Sis, or a couple of country <lb/>
cousins, all smiling vacantly, and all disposed in <lb/>
studied and uncomfortable attitudes in their carriage, <lb/>
and all looming up in their awe-inspiring imbecility <lb/>
before the snubbed and diminished presentment of <lb/>
that majestic presence whose ministering spirits are <lb/>
the rainbows, whose voice is the thunder, whose <lb/>
awful front is veiled in clouds, who was monarch <lb/>
here dead and forgotten ages before this hackful of <lb/>
small reptiles was deemed temporarily necessary to <lb/>
fill a crack in the world's unnoted myriads, and will <lb/>
still be monarch here ages and decades of ages after <lb/>
they shall have gathered themselves to their blood <lb/>
relations, the other worms, and been mingled with <lb/>
the unremembering dust.</p>
<p>There is no actual harm in making Niagara a <lb/>
background whereon to display one's marvelous <lb/>
insignificance in a good strong light, but it requires <lb/>
a sort of superhuman self-complacency to enable <lb/>
one to do it.</p>
<p>When you have examined the stupendous Horse- <lb/>
shoe Fall till you are satisfied you cannot improve <lb/>
<pb n="73"/>
on it, you return to America by the new Suspension <lb/>
Bridge, and follow up the bank to where they ex- <lb/>
hibit the Cave of the Winds.</p>
<p>Here I followed instructions, and divested myself <lb/>
of all my clothing, and put on a waterproof jacket <lb/>
and overalls. This costume is picturesque, but not <lb/>
beautiful. A guide, similarly dressed, led the way <lb/>
down a flight of winding stairs, which wound and <lb/>
wound, and still kept on winding long after the <lb/>
thing ceased to be a novelty, and then terminated <lb/>
long before it had begun to be a pleasure. We <lb/>
were then well down under the precipice, but still <lb/>
considerably above the level of the river.</p>
<p>We now began to creep along flimsy bridges of a <lb/>
single plank, our persons shielded from destruction <lb/>
by a crazy wooden railing, to which I clung with <lb/>
both hands&#x2014;not because I was afraid, but because <lb/>
I wanted to. Presently the descent became steeper, <lb/>
and the bridge flimsier, and sprays from the Ameri- <lb/>
can Fall began to rain down on us in fast increasing <lb/>
sheets that soon became blinding, and after that our <lb/>
progress was mostly in the nature of groping. Now <lb/>
a furious wind began to rush out from behind the <lb/>
waterfall, which seemed determined to sweep us <lb/>
from the bridge, and scatter us on the rocks and <lb/>
among the torrents below. I remarked that I wanted <lb/>
to go home; but it was too late. We were almost <lb/>
under the monstrous wall of water thundering down <lb/>
from above, and speech was in vain in the midst of <lb/>
such a pitiless crash of sound.</p>
<pb n="74"/>
<p>In another moment the guide disappeared be- <lb/>
hind the deluge, and, bewildered by the thunder, <lb/>
driven helplessly by the wind, and smitten by the <lb/>
arrowy tempest of rain, I followed. All was dark- <lb/>
ness. Such a mad storming, roaring, and bellowing <lb/>
of warring wind and water never crazed my ears be- <lb/>
fore. I bent my head, and seemed to receive the <lb/>
Atlantic on my back. The world seemed going to de- <lb/>
struction. I could not see anything, the flood poured <lb/>
down so savagely. I raised my head, with open <lb/>
mouth, and the most of the American cataract went <lb/>
down my throat. If I had sprung a leak now I had <lb/>
been lost. And at this moment I discovered that <lb/>
the bridge had ceased, and we must trust for a foot- <lb/>
hold to the slippery and precipitous rocks. I never <lb/>
was so scared before and survived it. But we got <lb/>
through at last, and emerged into the open day, <lb/>
where we could stand in front of the laced and <lb/>
frothy and seething world of descending water, and <lb/>
look at it. When I saw how much of it there was, <lb/>
and how fearfully in earnest it was, I was sorry I <lb/>
had gone behind it.</p>
<p>The noble Red Man has always been a friend and <lb/>
darling of mine. I love to read about him in tales <lb/>
and legends and romances. I love to read of his <lb/>
inspired sagacity, and his love of the wild free life <lb/>
of mountain and forest, and his general nobility of <lb/>
character, and his stately metaphorical manner of <lb/>
speech, and his chivalrous love for the dusky <lb/>
maiden, and the picturesque pomp of his dress and <lb/>
<pb n="75"/>
accoutrements. Especially the picturesque pomp of <lb/>
his dress and accoutrements. When I found the <lb/>
shops at Niagara Falls full of dainty Indian bead- <lb/>
work, and stunning moccasins, and equally stunning <lb/>
toy figures representing human beings who carried <lb/>
their weapons in holes bored through their arms and <lb/>
bodies, and had feet shaped like a pie, I was filled <lb/>
with emotion. I knew that now, at last, I was going <lb/>
to come face to face with the noble Red Man.</p>
<p>A lady clerk in a shop told me, indeed, that all <lb/>
her grand array of curiosities were made by the <lb/>
Indians, and that they were plenty about the Falls, <lb/>
and that they were friendly, and it would not be <lb/>
dangerous to speak to them. And sure enough, as <lb/>
I approached the bridge leading over to Luna Island, <lb/>
I came upon a noble Son of the Forest sitting under <lb/>
a tree, diligently at work on a bead reticule. He <lb/>
wore a slouch hat and brogans, and had a short <lb/>
black pipe in his mouth. Thus does the baneful <lb/>
contact with our effeminate civilization dilute the <lb/>
picturesque pomp which is so natural to the Indian <lb/>
when far removed from us in his native haunts. I <lb/>
addressed the relic as follows:</p>
<p>"Is the Wawhoo-Wang-Wang of the Whack-a- <lb/>
Whack happy? Does the great Speckled Thunder <lb/>
sigh for the warpath, or is his heart contented with <lb/>
dreaming of the dusky maiden, the Pride of the <lb/>
Forest? Does the mighty Sachem yearn to drink <lb/>
the blood of his enemies, or is he satisfied to make <lb/>
bead reticules for the pappooses of the paleface? <lb/>
<pb n="76"/>
Speak, sublime relic of bygone grandeur&#x2014;vener- <lb/>
able ruin, speak!"</p>
<p>The relic said:</p>
<p>"An' is it mesilf, Dennis Hooligan, that ye'd be <lb/>
takin' for a dirty Injin, ye drawlin', lantern-jawed, <lb/>
spider-legged divil! By the piper that played be- <lb/>
fore Moses, I'll ate ye!"</p>
<p>I went away from there.</p>
<p>By and by, in the neighborhood of the Terrapin <lb/>
Tower, I came upon a gentle daughter of the <lb/>
aborigines in fringed and beaded buckskin moccasins <lb/>
and leggins, seated on a bench with her pretty wares <lb/>
about her. She had just carved out a wooden chief <lb/>
that had a strong family resemblance to a clothes- <lb/>
pin, and was now boring a hole through his abdomen <lb/>
to put his bow through. I hesitated a moment, <lb/>
and then addressed her:</p>
<p>"Is the heart of the forest maiden heavy? Is <lb/>
the Laughing Tadpole lonely? Does she mourn <lb/>
over the extinguished council-fires of her race, and <lb/>
the vanished glory of her ancestors? Or does her <lb/>
sad spirit wander afar toward the hunting-grounds <lb/>
whither her brave Gobbler-of-the-Lightnings is gone? <lb/>
Why is my daughter silent? Has she aught against <lb/>
the paleface stranger?"</p>
<p>The maiden said:</p>
<p>"Faix, an' is it Biddy Malone ye dare to be <lb/>
callin' names? Lave this, or I'll shy your lean <lb/>
carcass over the cataract, ye sniveling blaggard!"</p>
<p>I adjourned from there also.</p>
<pb n="77"/>
<p>"Confound these Indians!" I said. "They told <lb/>
me they were tame; but, if appearances go for <lb/>
anything, I should say they were all on the war- <lb/>
path."</p>
<p>I made one more attempt to fraternize with them, <lb/>
and only one. I came upon a camp of them <lb/>
gathered in the shade of a great tree, making wam- <lb/>
pum and moccasins, and addressed them in the <lb/>
language of friendship:</p>
<p>"Noble Red Men, Braves, Grand Sachems, War <lb/>
Chiefs, Squaws, and High Muck-a-Mucks, the pale- <lb/>
face from the land of the setting sun greets you! <lb/>
You, Beneficent Polecat&#x2014;you, Devourer of Moun- <lb/>
tains&#x2014;you, Roaring Thundergust&#x2014;you, Bully <lb/>
Boy with a Glass eye&#x2014;the paleface from beyond <lb/>
the great waters greets you all! War and pestilence <lb/>
have thinned your ranks and destroyed your once <lb/>
proud nation. Poker and seven-up, and a vain <lb/>
modern expense for soap, unknown to your glorious <lb/>
ancestors, have depleted your purses. Appropriat- <lb/>
ing, in your simplicity, the property of others has <lb/>
gotten you into trouble. Misrepresenting facts, in <lb/>
your simple innocence, has damaged your reputa- <lb/>
tion with the soulless usurper. Trading for forty- <lb/>
rod whisky, to enable you to get drunk and happy <lb/>
and tomahawk your families, has played the ever- <lb/>
lasting mischief with the picturesque pomp of your <lb/>
dress, and here you are, in the broad light of the <lb/>
nineteenth century, gotten up like the ragtag and <lb/>
bobtail of the purlieus of New York. For shame! <lb/>
<pb n="78"/>
Remember your ancestors! Recall their mighty <lb/>
deeds! Remember Uncas!&#x2014;and Red Jacket!&#x2014; <lb/>
and Hole in the Day!&#x2014;and Whoopdedoodledo! <lb/>
Emulate their achievements! Unfurl yourselves <lb/>
under my banner, noble savages, illustrious gutter- <lb/>
snipes&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Down wid him!" "Scoop the blaggard!" <lb/>
"Burn him!" "Hang him!" "Dhround him!"</p>
<p>It was the quickest operation that ever was. I <lb/>
simply saw a sudden flash in the air of clubs, brick- <lb/>
bats, fists, bead-baskets, and moccasins&#x2014;a single <lb/>
flash, and they all appeared to hit me at once, and <lb/>
no two of them in the same place. In the next <lb/>
instant the entire tribe was upon me. They tore half <lb/>
the clothes off me; they broke my arms and legs; <lb/>
they gave me a thump that dented the top of my <lb/>
head till it would hold coffee like a saucer; and, to <lb/>
crown their disgraceful proceedings and add insult <lb/>
to injury, they threw me over the Niagara Falls, and <lb/>
I got wet.</p>
<p>About ninety or a hundred feet from the top, the <lb/>
remains of my vest caught on a projecting rock, and <lb/>
I was almost drowned before I could get loose. I <lb/>
finally fell, and brought up in a world of white foam <lb/>
at the foot of the Fall, whose celled and bubbly <lb/>
masses towered up several inches above my head. <lb/>
Of course I got into the eddy. I sailed round and <lb/>
round in it forty-four times&#x2014;chasing a chip and <lb/>
gaining on it&#x2014;each round trip a half mile&#x2014;reach- <lb/>
ing for the same bush on the bank forty-four times, <lb/>
<pb n="79"/>
and just exactly missing it by a hair's-breadth every <lb/>
time.</p>
<p>At last a man walked down and sat down close to <lb/>
that bush, and put a pipe in his mouth, and lit a <lb/>
match, and followed me with one eye and kept the <lb/>
other on the match, while he sheltered it in his <lb/>
hands from the wind. Presently a puff of wind <lb/>
blew it out. The next time I swept around he said:</p>
<p>"Got a match?"</p>
<p>"Yes; in my other vest. Help me out, please."</p>
<p>"Not for Joe."</p>
<p>When I came round again, I said:</p>
<p>"Excuse the seemingly impertinent curiosity of a <lb/>
drowning man, but will you explain this singular <lb/>
conduct of yours?"</p>
<p>"With pleasure. I am the coroner. Don't hurry <lb/>
on my account. I can wait for you. But I wish I <lb/>
had a match."</p>
<p>I said: "Take my place, and I'll go and get you <lb/>
one."</p>
<p>He declined. This lack of confidence on his part <lb/>
created a coldness between us, and from that time <lb/>
forward I avoided him. It was my idea, in case <lb/>
anything happened to me, to so time the occurrence <lb/>
as to throw my custom into the hands of the oppo- <lb/>
sition coroner over on the American side.</p>
<p>At last a policeman came along, and arrested <lb/>
me for disturbing the peace by yelling at people <lb/>
on shore for help. The judge fined me, but I <lb/>
had the advantage of him. My money was with <lb/>
<pb n="80"/>
my pantaloons and my pantaloons were with the <lb/>
Indians.</p>
<p>Thus I escaped. I am now lying in a very critical <lb/>
condition. At least I am lying anyway&#x2014;critical <lb/>
or not critical. I am hurt all over, but I cannot tell <lb/>
the full extent yet, because the doctor is not done <lb/>
taking inventory. He will make out my manifest <lb/>
this evening. However, thus far he thinks only <lb/>
sixteen of my wounds are fatal. I don't mind the <lb/>
others.</p>
<p>Upon regaining my right mind, I said:</p>
<p>"It is an awful savage tribe of Indians that do <lb/>
the bead work and moccasins for Niagara Falls, <lb/>
doctor. Where are they from?"</p>
<p>"Limerick, my son."</p>

<p>"<smcap>Moral statistician</smcap>."&#x2014;I don't want <lb/>
any of your statistics; I took your whole <lb/>
batch and lit my pipe with it. I hate your kind of <lb/>
people. You are always ciphering out how much a <lb/>
man's health is injured, and how much his intellect <lb/>
is impaired, and how many pitiful dollars and cents <lb/>
he wastes in the course of ninety-two years' indul- <lb/>
gence in the fatal practice of smoking; and in the <lb/>
equally fatal practice of drinking coffee; and in <lb/>
playing billiards occasionally; and in taking a glass <lb/>
of wine at dinner, etc., etc., etc. And you are <lb/>
always figuring out how many women have been <lb/>
burned to death because of the dangerous fashion of <lb/>
wearing expansive hoops, etc., etc., etc. You <lb/>
never see more than one side of the question. You <lb/>
are blind to the fact that most old men in America <lb/>
smoke and drink coffee, although, according to your <lb/>
theory, they ought to have died young; and that <lb/>
hearty old Englishmen drink wine and survive it, <lb/>
and portly old Dutchmen both drink and smoke <lb/>
freely, and yet grow older and fatter all the time. <lb/>
<pb n="82"/>
And you never try to find out how much solid com- <lb/>
fort, relaxation, and enjoyment a man derives from <lb/>
smoking in the course of a lifetime (which is worth <lb/>
ten times the money he would save by letting it <lb/>
alone), nor the appalling aggregate of happiness lost <lb/>
in a lifetime by your kind of people from <i>not</i> <lb/>
smoking. Of course you can save money by deny- <lb/>
ing yourself all those little vicious enjoyments for <lb/>
fifty years; but then what can you do with it? <lb/>
What use can you put it to? Money can't save <lb/>
your infinitesimal soul. All the use that money can <lb/>
be put to is to purchase comfort and enjoyment in <lb/>
this life; therefore, as you are an enemy to comfort <lb/>
and enjoyment, where is the use of accumulating <lb/>
cash? It won't do for you to say that you can use <lb/>
it to better purpose in furnishing a good table, and <lb/>
in charities, and in supporting tract societies, be- <lb/>
cause you know yourself that you people who have <lb/>
no petty vices are never known to give away a cent, <lb/>
and that you stint yourselves so in the matter of <lb/>
food that you are always feeble and hungry. And <lb/>
you never dare to laugh in the daytime for fear some <lb/>
poor wretch, seeing you in a good humor, will try <lb/>
to borrow a dollar of you; and in church you are <lb/>
always down on your knees, with your eyes buried <lb/>
in the cushion, when the contribution box comes <lb/>
around; and you never give the revenue officers a <lb/>
full statement of your income. Now you know all <lb/>
these things yourself, don't you? Very well, then, <lb/>
what is the use of your stringing out your miserable <lb/>
<pb n="83"/>
lives to a lean and withered old age? What is the <lb/>
use of your saving money that is so utterly worthless <lb/>
to you? In a word, why don't you go off some- <lb/>
where and die, and not be always trying to seduce <lb/>
people into becoming as "ornery" and unloveable <lb/>
as you are yourselves, by your villainous "moral <lb/>
statistics"? Now I don't approve of dissipation, <lb/>
and I don't indulge in it, either; but I haven't a <lb/>
particle of confidence in a man who has no redeem- <lb/>
ing petty vices, and so I don't want to hear from <lb/>
you any more. I think you are the very same man <lb/>
who read me a long lecture last week about the <lb/>
degrading vice of smoking cigars, and then came <lb/>
back, in my absence, with your reprehensible fire- <lb/>
proof gloves on, and carried off my beautiful parlor <lb/>
stove.</p>
<p>"<smcap>Young Author</smcap>."&#x2014;Yes, Agassiz <i>does</i> recom- <lb/>
mend authors to eat fish, because the phosphorus <lb/>
in it makes brain. So far you are correct. But I <lb/>
cannot help you to a decision about the amount you <lb/>
need to eat&#x2014;at least, not with certainty. If the <lb/>
specimen composition you send is about your fair <lb/>
usual average, I should judge that perhaps a couple <lb/>
of whales would be all you would want for the <lb/>
present. Not the largest kind, but simply good <lb/>
middling-sized whales.</p>

<q><i>To Mr. Mark Twain:</i> The within parson, which I have set to <lb/>
poetry under the name and style of "He Done His Level Best," was <lb/>
one among the whitest men I ever see, and it ain't every man that <lb/>
knowed him that can find it in his heart to say he's glad the poor cuss <lb/>
is busted and gone home to the States. He was here in an early day, <lb/>
and he was the handyest man about takin' holt of anything that come <lb/>
along you most ever see, I judge. He was a cheerful, stirrin' cretur, <lb/>
always doin' somethin', and no man can say he ever see him do anything <lb/>
by halvers. Preachin' was his nateral gait, but he warn't a man to lay <lb/>
back and twidle his thumbs because there didn't happen to be nothin' <lb/>
doin' in his own especial line&#x2014;no, sir, he was a man who would <lb/>
meander forth and stir up something for hisself. His last acts was to go <lb/>
his pile on "Kings-<i>and</i>" (calklatin' to fill, but which he didn't fill), <lb/>
when there was a "flush" out agin him, and naterally, you see, he <lb/>
went under. And so he was cleaned out, as you may say, and he struck <lb/>
the home-trail, cheerful but flat broke. I knowed this talonted man in <lb/>
Arkansaw, and if you would print this humbly tribute to his gorgis <lb/>
abilities, you would greatly obleege his onhappy friend.</q>

<pb n="86"/>
respondent sends a lot of doggerel, and says it has <lb/>

a specimen verse: <lb/>

<l>"The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold,</l>
<l>And his cohorts were gleaming with purple and gold;</l>

</lg></q></p>
<p>There, that will do. That may be very good <lb/>
Dutch Flat poetry, but it won't do in the metropolis. <lb/>
It is too smooth and blubbery; it reads like butter- <lb/>
milk gurgling from a jug. What the people ought <lb/>
to have is something spirited&#x2014;something like <lb/>
"Johnny Comes Marching Home." However, <lb/>
keep on practicing, and you may succeed yet. <lb/>
There is genius in you, but too much blubber.</p>

to do?"</q>
<p>You should set your affections on another also&#x2014; <lb/>
or on several, if there are enough to go round. <lb/>
Also, do everything you can to make your former <lb/>
flame unhappy. There is an absurd idea dissemi- <lb/>
nated in novels, that the happier a girl is with <lb/>
another man, the happier it makes the old lover she <lb/>
has blighted. Don't allow yourself to believe any <lb/>
such nonsense as that. The more cause that girl <lb/>
finds to regret that she did not marry you, the more <lb/>
comfortable you will feel over it. It isn't poetical, <lb/>
but it is mighty sound doctrine.</p>

<q>"<smcap>Discarded Lover</smcap>."&#x2014;I loved, and still love, the beautiful <lb/>
Edwitha Howard, and intended to marry her. Yet, during my temporary <lb/>
absence at Benicia, last week, alas! she married Jones. Is my hap- <lb/>
piness to be thus blasted for life? Have I no redress?"</q>
<p>Of course you have. All the law, written and <lb/>
unwritten, is on your side. The <i>intention</i> and not <lb/>
the <i>act</i> constitutes crime&#x2014;in other words, consti- <lb/>
tutes the <i>deed</i>. If you call your bosom friend a <lb/>
fool, and <i>intend</i> it for an insult, it <i>is</i> an insult; but <lb/>
if you do it playfully, and meaning no insult, it is <lb/>
<i>not</i> an insult. If you discharge a pistol <i>accidentally</i>, <lb/>
and kill a man, you can go free, for you have done <lb/>
no murder; but if you try to kill a man, and mani- <lb/>
festly <i>intend</i> to kill him, but fail utterly to do it, the <lb/>
law still holds that the <i>intention</i> constituted the <lb/>
crime, and you are guilty of murder. Ergo, if you <lb/>
had married Edwitha <i>accidentally</i>, and without really <lb/>
<i>intending</i> to do it, you would not actually be mar- <lb/>
ried to her at all, because the <i>act</i> of marriage could <lb/>
not be complete without the <i>intention</i>. And ergo, <lb/>
in the strict spirit of the law, since you deliberately <lb/>
<pb n="88"/>
<i>intended</i> to marry Edwitha, and didn't do it, you <lb/>
are married to her all the same&#x2014;because, as I said <lb/>
before, the <i>intention</i> constitutes the crime. It is as <lb/>
clear as day that Edwitha is your wife, and your <lb/>
redress lies in taking a club and mutilating Jones <lb/>
with it as much as you can. Any man has a right <lb/>
to protect his own wife from the advances of other <lb/>
men. But you have another alternative&#x2014;you were <lb/>
married to Edwitha <i>first</i>, because of your deliberate <lb/>
intention, and now you can prosecute her for <lb/>
bigamy, in subsequently marrying Jones. But there <lb/>
is another phase in this complicated case: You <i>in- <lb/>
tended</i> to marry Edwitha, and consequently, accord- <lb/>
ing to law, she is your wife&#x2014;there is no getting <lb/>
around that; but she didn't marry you, and if she <lb/>
<i>never intended</i> to marry you, <i>you are not her hus- <lb/>
band</i>, of course. Ergo, in marrying Jones, she was <lb/>
guilty of bigamy, because she was the wife of an- <lb/>
other man at the time; which is all very well as <lb/>
far as it goes&#x2014;but then, don't you see, she had <lb/>
no other <i>husband</i> when she married Jones, and con- <lb/>
sequently she was <i>not</i> guilty of bigamy. Now, <lb/>
according to this view of the case, Jones married a <lb/>
<i>spinster</i>, who was a <i>widow</i> at the same time and <lb/>
another man's <i>wife</i> at the same time, and yet who <lb/>
had no <i>husband</i> and <i>never had one</i>, and never had <lb/>
any <i>intention</i> of getting married, and therefore, of <lb/>
course, <i>never had</i> been married; and by the same <lb/>
reasoning you are a <i>bachelor</i>, because you have <lb/>
never been any one's <i>husband;</i> and a <i>married man</i>, <lb/>
<pb n="89"/>
because you have a wife living; and to all intents <lb/>
and purposes a <i>widower</i>, because you have been <lb/>
deprived of that wife; and a consummate <i>ass</i> for <lb/>
going off to Benicia in the first place, while things <lb/>
were so mixed. And by this time I have got myself <lb/>
so tangled up in the intricacies of this extraordinary <lb/>
case that I shall have to give up any further attempt <lb/>
to advise you&#x2014;I might get confused and fail to <lb/>
make myself understood. I think I could take up <lb/>
the argument where I left off, and by following it <lb/>
closely a while, perhaps I could prove to your satis- <lb/>
faction, either that you never existed at all, or that <lb/>
you are dead now, and consequently don't need the <lb/>
faithless Edwitha&#x2014;I think I could do that, if it <lb/>
would afford you any comfort.</p>
<p>"<smcap>Arthur Augustus</smcap>."&#x2014;No; you are wrong; <lb/>
that is the proper way to throw a brickbat or a <lb/>
tomahawk; but it doesn't answer so well for a bou- <lb/>
quet; you will hurt somebody if you keep it up. <lb/>
Turn your nosegay upside down, take it by the <lb/>
stems, and toss it with an upward sweep. Did you <lb/>
ever pitch quoits? that is the idea. The practice of <lb/>
recklessly heaving immense solid bouquets, of the <lb/>
general size and weight of prize cabbages, from the <lb/>
dizzy altitude of the galleries, is dangerous and very <lb/>
reprehensible. Now, night before last, at the Acad- <lb/>
emy of Music, just after Signorina <gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> had fin- <lb/>
ished that exquisite melody, "The Last Rose of <lb/>
Summer," one of these floral pile-drivers came <lb/>
<pb n="90"/>
cleaving down through the atmosphere of applause, <lb/>
and if she hadn't deployed suddenly to the right, it <lb/>
would have driven her into the floor like a shingle- <lb/>
nail. Of course that bouquet was well meant; but <lb/>
how would you like to have been the target? A <lb/>
sincere compliment is always grateful to a lady, so <lb/>
long as you don't try to knock her down with it.</p>
<p>"<smcap>Young Mother</smcap>."&#x2014;And so you think a baby <lb/>
is a thing of beauty and a joy forever? Well, the <lb/>
idea is pleasing, but not original; every cow thinks <lb/>
the same of its own calf. Perhaps the cow may not <lb/>
think it so elegantly, but still she thinks it neverthe- <lb/>
less. I honor the cow for it. We all honor this <lb/>
touching maternal instinct wherever we find it, be it <lb/>
in the home of luxury or in the humble cow-shed. <lb/>
But really, madam, when I come to examine the <lb/>
matter in all its bearings, I find that the correctness <lb/>
of your assertion does not assert itself in all cases. <lb/>
A soiled baby, with a neglected nose, cannot be <lb/>
conscientiously regarded as a thing of beauty; and <lb/>
inasmuch as babyhood spans but three short years, <lb/>
no baby is competent to be a joy "forever." It <lb/>
pains me thus to demolish two-thirds of your pretty <lb/>
sentiment in a single sentence; but the position I <lb/>
hold in this chair requires that I shall not permit <lb/>
you to deceive and mislead the public with your <lb/>
plausible figures of speech. I know a female baby, <lb/>
aged eighteen months, in this city, which cannot <lb/>
hold out as a "joy" twenty-four hours on a stretch, <lb/>
<pb n="91"/>
let alone "forever." And it possesses some of the <lb/>
most remarkable eccentricities of character and ap- <lb/>
petite that have ever fallen under my notice. I will <lb/>
set down here a statement of this infant's operations <lb/>
(conceived, planned, and carried out by itself, and <lb/>
without suggestion or assistance from its mother or <lb/>
any one else), during a single day; and what I shall <lb/>
say can be substantiated by the sworn testimony of <lb/>
witnesses.</p>
<p>It commenced by eating one dozen large blue-mass <lb/>
pills, box and all; then it fell down a flight of stairs, <lb/>
and arose with a blue and purple knot on its fore- <lb/>
head, after which it proceeded in quest of further <lb/>
refreshment and amusement. It found a glass <lb/>
trinket ornamented with brass-work&#x2014;smashed up <lb/>
and ate the glass, and then swallowed the brass. <lb/>
Then it drank about twenty drops of laudanum, and <lb/>
more than a dozen tablespoonfuls of strong spirits <lb/>
of camphor. The reason why it took no more <lb/>
laudanum was because there was no more to take. <lb/>
After this it lay down on its back, and shoved five <lb/>
or six inches of a silver-headed whalebone cane <lb/>
down its throat; got it fast there, and it was all its <lb/>
mother could do to pull the cane out again, without <lb/>
pulling out some of the child with it. Then, being <lb/>
hungry for glass again, it broke up several wine- <lb/>
glasses, and fell to eating and swallowing the frag- <lb/>
ments, not minding a cut or two. Then it ate a <lb/>
quantity of butter, pepper, salt, and California <lb/>
matches, actually taking a spoonful of butter, a <lb/>
<pb n="92"/>
spoonful of salt, a spoonful of pepper, and three or <lb/>
four lucifer matches at each mouthful. (I will re- <lb/>
mark here that this thing of beauty likes painted <lb/>
German lucifers, and eats all she can get of them; <lb/>
but she prefers California matches, which I regard <lb/>
as a compliment to our home manufactures of more <lb/>
than ordinary value, coming, as it does, from one <lb/>
who is too young to flatter.) Then she washed her <lb/>
head with soap and water, and afterward ate what <lb/>
soap was left, and drank as much of the suds as she <lb/>
had room for; after which she sallied forth and took <lb/>
the cow familiarly by the tail, and got kicked heels <lb/>
over head. At odd times during the day, when this <lb/>
joy for ever happened to have nothing particular on <lb/>
hand, she put in the time by climbing up on places, <lb/>
and falling down off them, uniformly damaging her- <lb/>
self in the operation. As young as she is, she <lb/>
speaks many words tolerably distinctly; and being <lb/>
plain-spoken in other respects, blunt and to the <lb/>
point, she opens conversation with all strangers, <lb/>
male or female, with the same formula, "How do, <lb/>
Jim?" Not being familiar with the ways of chil- <lb/>
dren, it is possible that I have been magnifying into <lb/>
matter of surprise things which may not strike any <lb/>
one who is familiar with infancy as being at all <lb/>
astonishing. However, I cannot believe that such is <lb/>
the case, and so I repeat that my report of this <lb/>
baby's performances is strictly true; and if any one <lb/>
doubts it, I can produce the child. I will further <lb/>
engage that she will devour anything that is given <lb/>
<pb n="93"/>
her (reserving to myself only the right to exclude <lb/>
anvils), and fall down from any place to which she <lb/>
may be elevated (merely stipulating that her prefer- <lb/>
ence for alighting on her head shall be respected, <lb/>
and, therefore, that the elevation chosen shall be <lb/>
high enough to enable her to accomplish this to her <lb/>
satisfaction). But I find I have wandered from my <lb/>
subject; so, without further argument, I will reiter- <lb/>
ate my conviction that not <i>all</i> babies are things of <lb/>
beauty and joys forever.</p>
<q>"<smcap>Arithmeticus</smcap>." <i>Virginia, Nevada</i>.&#x2014;"I am an enthusiastic <lb/>
student of mathematics, and it is so vexatious to me to find my progress <lb/>
constantly impeded by these mysterious arithmetical technicalities. Now <lb/>
do tell me what the difference is between geometry and conchology?"</q>
<p>Here <i>you</i> come again with your arithmetical con- <lb/>
undrums, when I am suffering death with a cold in <lb/>
the head. If you could have seen the expression of <lb/>
scorn that darkened my countenance a moment ago, <lb/>
and was instantly split from the center in every <lb/>
direction like a fractured looking-glass by my last <lb/>
sneeze, you never would have written that disgrace- <lb/>
ful question. Conchology is a science which has <lb/>
nothing to do with mathematics; it relates only to <lb/>
shells. At the same time, however, a man who <lb/>
opens oysters for a hotel, or shells a fortified town, <lb/>
or sucks eggs, is not, strictly speaking, a concholo- <lb/>
gist&#x2014;a fine stroke of sarcasm that, but it will be <lb/>
lost on such an unintellectual clam as you. Now <lb/>
compare conchology and geometry together, and <lb/>
you will see what the difference is, and your ques- <lb/>
<pb n="94"/>
tion will be answered. But don't torture me with <lb/>
any more arithmetical horrors until you know I am <lb/>
rid of my cold. I feel the bitterest animosity toward <lb/>
you at this moment&#x2014;bothering me in this way, <lb/>
when I can do nothing but sneeze and rage and <lb/>
snort pocket handkerchiefs to atoms. If I had you <lb/>
in range of my nose now I would blow your brains <lb/>
out.</p>

<head><b>TO RAISE POULTRY</b><ref target="n14">*</ref><note id="n14" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Being a letter written to a Poultry Society that had conferred a <lb/>
complimentary membership upon the author. Written about 1870.</p></note></head>
<p><smcap>Seriously</smcap>, from early youth I have taken an <lb/>
especial interest in the subject of poultry-raising, <lb/>
and so this membership touches a ready sympathy <lb/>
in my breast. Even as a schoolboy, poultry-raising <lb/>
was a study with me, and I may say without egotism <lb/>
that as early as the age of seventeen I was ac- <lb/>
quainted with all the best and speediest methods of <lb/>
raising chickens, from raising them off a roost by <lb/>
burning lucifer matches under their noses, down to <lb/>
lifting them off a fence on a frosty night by insinu- <lb/>
ating the end of a warm board under their heels. <lb/>
By the time I was twenty years old, I really suppose <lb/>
I had raised more poultry than any one individual <lb/>
in all the section round about there. The very <lb/>
chickens came to know my talent by and by. The <lb/>
youth of both sexes ceased to paw the earth for <lb/>
worms, and old roosters that came to crow, "re- <lb/>
mained to pray," when I passed by.</p>
<p>I have had so much experience in the raising of <lb/>
fowls that I cannot but think that a few hints from <lb/>
<pb n="96"/>
me might be useful to the society. The two methods <lb/>
I have already touched upon are very simple, and <lb/>
are only used in the raising of the commonest class <lb/>
of fowls; one is for summer, the other for winter. <lb/>
In the one case you start out with a friend along <lb/>
about eleven o'clock on a summer's night (not <lb/>
later, because in some States&#x2014;especially in Cali- <lb/>
fornia and Oregon&#x2014;chickens always rouse up just <lb/>
at midnight and crow from ten to thirty minutes, <lb/>
according to the ease or difficulty they experience <lb/>
in getting the public waked up), and your friend <lb/>
carries with him a sack. Arrived at the henroost <lb/>
(your neighbor's, not your own), you light a match <lb/>
and hold it under first one and then another pullet's <lb/>
nose until they are willing to go into that bag with- <lb/>
out making any trouble about it. You then return <lb/>
home, either taking the bag with you or leaving it <lb/>
behind, according as circumstances shall dictate. <lb/>
<i>N. B.</i>&#x2014;I <i>have</i> seen the time when it was eligible <lb/>
and appropriate to leave the sack behind and walk <lb/>
off with considerable velocity, without ever leaving <lb/>
any word where to send it.</p>
<p>In the case of the other method mentioned for <lb/>
raising poultry, your friend takes along a covered <lb/>
vessel with a charcoal fire in it, and you carry a <lb/>
long slender plank. This is a frosty night, under- <lb/>
stand. Arrived at the tree, or fence, or other hen- <lb/>
roost (your own if you are an idiot), you warm the <lb/>
end of your plank in your friend's fire vessel, and <lb/>
then raise it aloft and ease it up gently against a <lb/>
<pb n="97"/>
slumbering chicken's foot. If the subject of your <lb/>
attentions is a true bird, he will infallibly return <lb/>
thanks with a sleepy cluck or two, and step out and <lb/>
take up quarters on the plank, thus becoming so <lb/>
conspicuously accessory before the fact to his own <lb/>
murder as to make it a grave question in our minds, <lb/>
as it once was in the mind of Blackstone, whether <lb/>
he is not really and deliberately committing suicide <lb/>
in the second degree. [But you enter into a con- <lb/>
templation of these legal refinements subsequently&#x2014; <lb/>
not then.]</p>
<p>When you wish to raise a fine, large, donkey- <lb/>
voiced Shanghai rooster, you do it with a lasso, just <lb/>
as you would a bull. It is because he must be <lb/>
choked, and choked effectually, too. It is the only <lb/>
good, certain way, for whenever he mentions a <lb/>
matter which he is cordially interested in, the <lb/>
chances are ninety-nine in a hundred that he <lb/>
secures somebody else's immediate attention to it <lb/>
too, whether it be day or night.</p>
<p>The Black Spanish is an exceedingly fine bird and <lb/>
a costly one. Thirty-five dollars is the usual figure, <lb/>
and fifty a not uncommon price for a specimen. <lb/>
Even its eggs are worth from a dollar to a dollar <lb/>
and a half apiece, and yet are so unwholesome that <lb/>
the city physician seldom or never orders them for <lb/>
the workhouse. Still I have once or twice procured <lb/>
as high as a dozen at a time for nothing, in the dark <lb/>
of the moon. The best way to raise the Black <lb/>
Spanish fowl is to go late in the evening and raise <lb/>
<pb n="98"/>
coop and all. The reason I recommend this method <lb/>
is that, the birds being so valuable, the owners do <lb/>
not permit them to roost around promiscuously, but <lb/>
put them in a coop as strong as a fireproof safe, <lb/>
and keep it in the kitchen at night. The method I <lb/>
speak of is not always a bright and satisfying suc- <lb/>
cess, and yet there are so many little articles of <lb/>
<i>vertu</i> about a kitchen, that if you fail on the coop <lb/>
you can generally bring away something else. I <lb/>
brought away a nice steel trap one night, worth <lb/>
ninety cents.</p>
<p>But what is the use in my pouring out my whole <lb/>
intellect on this subject? I have shown the Western <lb/>
New York Poultry Society that they have taken to <lb/>
their bosom a party who is not a spring chicken by <lb/>
any means, but a man who knows all about poultry, <lb/>
and is just as high up in the most efficient methods <lb/>
of raising it as the president of the institution him- <lb/>
self. I thank these gentlemen for the honorary <lb/>
membership they have conferred upon me, and shall <lb/>
stand at all times ready and willing to testify my <lb/>
good feeling and my official zeal by deeds as well as <lb/>
by this hastily penned advice and information. <lb/>
Whenever they are ready to go to raising poultry, <lb/>
let them call for me any evening after eleven <lb/>
o'clock, and I shall be on hand promptly.</p>

<head><b><smcap>EXPERIENCE OF THE McWILLIAMSES <lb/>
WITH MEMBRANOUS CROUP</smcap></b><ref target="n15">*</ref><note id="n15" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1878.</p></note></head>
<q>[<i>As related to the author of this book by Mr. McWil- <lb/>
liams, a pleasant New York gentleman whom the <lb/>
said author met by chance on a journey</i>.]</q>
<p><smcap>Well</smcap>, to go back to where I was before I <lb/>
digressed to explain to you how that fright- <lb/>
ful and incurable disease, membranous croup, was <lb/>
ravaging the town and driving all mothers mad with <lb/>
terror, I called Mrs. McWilliams's attention to little <lb/>
Penelope and said:</p>
<p>"Darling, I wouldn't let that child be chewing <lb/>
that pine stick if I were you."</p>
<p>"Precious, where is the harm in it?" said she, <lb/>
but at the same time preparing to take away the <lb/>
stick&#x2014;for women cannot receive even the most <lb/>
palpably judicious suggestion without arguing it; <lb/>
that is, married women.</p>
<p>I replied:</p>
<p>"Love, it is notorious that pine is the least nutri- <lb/>
tious wood that a child can eat."</p>
<p>My wife's hand paused, in the act of taking the <lb/>
<pb n="100"/>
stick, and returned itself to her lap. She bridled <lb/>
perceptibly, and said:</p>
<p>"Hubby, you know better than that. You know <lb/>
you do. Doctors <i>all</i> say that the turpentine in pine <lb/>
wood is good for weak back and the kidneys."</p>
<p>"Ah&#x2014;I was under a misapprehension. I did <lb/>
not know that the child's kidneys and spine were <lb/>
affected, and that the family physician had recom- <lb/>
mended&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Who said the child's spine and kidneys were <lb/>
affected?"</p>
<p>"My love, you intimated it."</p>
<p>"The idea! I never intimated anything of the <lb/>
kind."</p>
<p>"Why, my dear, it hasn't been two minutes since <lb/>
you said&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Bother what I said! I don't care what I did <lb/>
say. There isn't any harm in the child's chewing a <lb/>
bit of pine stick if she wants to, and you know it <lb/>
perfectly well. And she <i>shall</i> chew it, too. So <lb/>
there, now!"</p>
<p>"Say no more, my dear. I now see the force of <lb/>
your reasoning, and I will go and order two or three <lb/>
cords of the best pine wood to-day. No child of <lb/>
mine shall want while I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>please</i> go along to your office and let me <lb/>
have some peace. A body can never make the <lb/>
simplest remark but you must take it up and go to <lb/>
arguing and arguing and arguing till you don't know <lb/>
what you are talking about, and you <i>never</i> do."</p>
<pb n="101"/>
<p>"Very well, it shall be as you say. But there is <lb/>
a want of logic in your last remark which&#x2014;"</p>
<p>However, she was gone with a flourish before I <lb/>
could finish, and had taken the child with her. That <lb/>
night at dinner she confronted me with a face as <lb/>
white as a sheet:</p>
<p>"Oh, Mortimer, there's another! Little Georgie <lb/>
Gordon is taken."</p>
<p>"Membranous croup?"</p>
<p>"Membranous croup."</p>
<p>"Is there any hope for him?"</p>
<p>"None in the wide world. Oh, what is to be- <lb/>
come of us!"</p>
<p>By and by a nurse brought in our Penelope to <lb/>
say good night and offer the customary prayer at <lb/>
the mother's knee. In the midst of "Now I lay <lb/>
me down to sleep," she gave a slight cough! My <lb/>
wife fell back like one stricken with death. But the <lb/>
next moment she was up and brimming with the <lb/>
activities which terror inspires.</p>
<p>She commanded that the child's crib be removed <lb/>
from the nursery to our bedroom; and she went <lb/>
along to see the order executed. She took me with <lb/>
her, of course. We got matters arranged with <lb/>
speed. A cot bed was put up in my wife's dressing <lb/>
room for the nurse. But now Mrs. McWilliams <lb/>
said we were too far away from the other baby, and <lb/>
what if <i>he</i> were to have the symptoms in the night <lb/>
&#x2014;and she blanched again, poor thing.</p>
<p>We then restored the crib and the nurse to the <lb/>
<pb n="102"/>
nursery and put up a bed for ourselves in a room <lb/>
adjoining.</p>
<p>Presently, however, Mrs. McWilliams said sup- <lb/>
pose the baby should catch it from Penelope? This <lb/>
thought struck a new panic to her heart, and the <lb/>
tribe of us could not get the crib out of the nursery <lb/>
again fast enough to satisfy my wife, though she <lb/>
assisted in her own person and well nigh pulled the <lb/>
crib to pieces in her frantic hurry.</p>
<p>We moved downstairs; but there was no place <lb/>
there to stow the nurse, and Mrs. McWilliams said <lb/>
the nurse's experience would be an inestimable help. <lb/>
So we returned, bag and baggage, to our own bed- <lb/>
room once more, and felt a great gladness, like <lb/>
storm-buffeted birds that have found their nest <lb/>
again.</p>
<p>Mrs. McWilliams sped to the nursery to see how <lb/>
things were going on there. She was back in a <lb/>
moment with a new dread. She said:</p>
<p>"What <i>can</i> make Baby sleep so?"</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>"Why, my darling, Baby <i>always</i> sleeps like a <lb/>
graven image."</p>
<p>"I know. I know; but there's something pecu- <lb/>
liar about his sleep now. He seems to&#x2014;to&#x2014;he <lb/>
seems to breathe so <i>regularly</i>. Oh, this is dread- <lb/>
ful."</p>
<p>"But, my dear, he always breathes regularly."</p>
<p>"Oh, I know it, but there's something frightful <lb/>
about it now. His nurse is too young and inexperi- <lb/>
<pb n="103"/>
enced. Maria shall stay there with her, and be on <lb/>
hand if anything happens."</p>
<p>"That is a good idea, but who will help <i>you?</i>"</p>
<p>"You can help me all I want. I wouldn't allow <lb/>
anybody to do anything but myself, anyhow, at <lb/>
such a time as this."</p>
<p>I said I would feel mean to lie abed and sleep, <lb/>
and leave her to watch and toil over our little patient <lb/>
all the weary night. But she reconciled me to it. <lb/>
So old Maria departed and took up her ancient <lb/>
quarters in the nursery.</p>
<p>Penelope coughed twice in her sleep.</p>
<p>"Oh, why <i>don't</i> that doctor come! Mortimer, <lb/>
this room is too warm. This room is certainly too <lb/>
warm. Turn off the register&#x2014;quick!"</p>
<p>I shut it off, glancing at the thermometer at the <lb/>
same time, and wondering to myself if 70 <i>was</i> too <lb/>
warm for a sick child.</p>
<p>The coachman arrived from down town now with <lb/>
the news that our physician was ill and confined to <lb/>
his bed. Mrs. McWilliams turned a dead eye upon <lb/>
me, and said in a dead voice:</p>
<p>"There is a Providence in it. It is foreordained. <lb/>
He never was sick before. Never. We have not <lb/>
been living as we ought to live, Mortimer. Time <lb/>
and time again I have told you so. Now you see <lb/>
the result. Our child will never get well. Be <lb/>
thankful if you can forgive yourself; I never can <lb/>
forgive <i>my</i>self."</p>
<p>I said, without intent to hurt, but with heedless <lb/>
<pb n="104"/>
choice of words, that I could not see that we had <lb/>
been living such an abandoned life.</p>
<p>"<i>Mortimer!</i> Do you want to bring the judg- <lb/>
ment upon Baby, too!"</p>
<p>Then she began to cry, but suddenly exclaimed:</p>
<p>"The doctor must have sent medicines!"</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>"Certainly. They are here. I was only waiting <lb/>
for you to give me a chance."</p>
<p>"Well do give them to me! Don't you know <lb/>
that every moment is precious now? But what was <lb/>
the use in sending medicines, when he <i>knows</i> that <lb/>
the disease is incurable?"</p>
<p>I said that while there was life there was hope.</p>
<p>"Hope! Mortimer, you know no more what <lb/>
you are talking about than the child unborn. If <lb/>
you would&#x2014; As I live, the directions say give one <lb/>
teaspoonful once an hour! Once an hour!&#x2014;as if <lb/>
we had a whole year before us to save the child in! <lb/>
Mortimer, please hurry. Give the poor perishing <lb/>
thing a tablespoonful, and <i>try</i> to be quick!"</p>
<p>"Why, my dear, a tablespoonful might&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"<i>Don't</i> drive me frantic!&#x2026; &#x2026;There, there, <lb/>
there, my precious, my own; it's nasty bitter stuff, <lb/>
but it's good for Nelly&#x2014;good for mother's precious <lb/>
darling; and it will make her well. There, there, <lb/>
there, put the little head on mamma's breast and go <lb/>
to sleep, and pretty soon&#x2014;oh, I know she can't <lb/>
live till morning! Mortimer, a tablespoonful every <lb/>
half hour will&#x2014; Oh, the child needs belladonna, <lb/>
<pb n="105"/>
too; I know she does&#x2014;and aconite. Get them, <lb/>
Mortimer. Now do let me have my way. You <lb/>
know nothing about these things."</p>
<p>We now went to bed, placing the crib close to my <lb/>
wife's pillow. All this turmoil had worn upon me, <lb/>
and within two minutes I was something more than <lb/>
half asleep. Mrs. McWilliams roused me:</p>
<p>"Darling, is that register turned on?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"I thought as much. Please turn it on at once. <lb/>
This room is cold."</p>
<p>I turned it on, and presently fell asleep again. I <lb/>
was aroused once more:</p>
<p>"Dearie, would you mind moving the crib to <lb/>
your side of the bed? It is nearer the register."</p>
<p>I moved it, but had a collision with the rug and <lb/>
woke up the child. I dozed off once more, while <lb/>
my wife quieted the sufferer. But in a little while <lb/>
these words came murmuring remotely through the <lb/>
fog of my drowsiness:</p>
<p>"Mortimer, if we only had some goose grease&#x2014; <lb/>
will you ring?"</p>
<p>I climbed dreamily out, and stepped on a cat, <lb/>
which responded with a protest and would have got <lb/>
a convincing kick for it if a chair had not got it <lb/>
instead.</p>
<p>"Now, Mortimer, why do you want to turn up <lb/>
the gas and wake up the child again?"</p>
<p>"Because I want to see how much I am hurt, <lb/>
Caroline."</p>
<pb n="106"/>
<p>'Well, look at the chair, too&#x2014;I have no doubt <lb/>
it is ruined. Poor cat, suppose you had&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Now I am not going to suppose anything <lb/>
about the cat. It never would have occurred if <lb/>
Maria had been allowed to remain here and attend <lb/>
to these duties, which are in her line and are not in <lb/>
mine."</p>
<p>"Now, Mortimer, I should think you would be <lb/>
ashamed to make a remark like that. It is a pity if <lb/>
you cannot do the few little things I ask of you at <lb/>
such an awful time as this when our child&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"There, there, I will do anything you want. But <lb/>
I can't raise anybody with this bell. They're all <lb/>
gone to bed. Where is the goose grease?"</p>
<p>"On the mantel-piece in the nursery. If you'll <lb/>
step there and speak to Maria&#x2014;"</p>
<p>I fetched the goose grease and went to sleep <lb/>
again. Once more I was called:</p>
<p>"Mortimer, I so hate to disturb you, but the <lb/>
room is still too cold for me to try to apply this <lb/>
stuff. Would you mind lighting the fire? It is all <lb/>
ready to touch a match to."</p>
<p>I dragged myself out and lit the fire, and then sat <lb/>
down disconsolate.</p>
<p>"Mortimer, don't sit there and catch your death <lb/>
of cold. Come to bed."</p>
<p>As I was stepping in she said:</p>
<p>"But wait a moment. Please give the child some <lb/>
more of the medicine."</p>
<p>Which I did. It was a medicine which made a <lb/>
<pb n="107"/>
child more or less lively; so my wife made use of <lb/>
its waking interval to strip it and grease it all over <lb/>
with the goose oil. I was soon asleep once more, <lb/>
but once more I had to get up.</p>
<p>"Mortimer, I feel a draft. I feel it distinctly. <lb/>
There is nothing so bad for this disease as a draft. <lb/>
Please move the crib in front of the fire."</p>
<p>I did it; and collided with the rug again, which I <lb/>
threw in the fire. Mrs. McWilliams sprang out of <lb/>
bed and rescued it and we had some words. I had <lb/>
another trifling interval of sleep, and then got up, <lb/>
by request, and constructed a flax-seed poultice. <lb/>
This was placed upon the child's breast and left <lb/>
there to do its healing work.</p>
<p>A wood fire is not a permanent thing. I got up <lb/>
every twenty minutes and renewed ours, and this <lb/>
gave Mrs. McWilliams the opportunity to shorten <lb/>
the times of giving the medicines by ten minutes, <lb/>
which was a great satisfaction to her. Now and <lb/>
then, between times, I reorganized the flax-seed <lb/>
poultices, and applied sinapisms and other sorts of <lb/>
blisters where unoccupied places could be found <lb/>
upon the child. Well, toward morning the wood <lb/>
gave out and my wife wanted me to go down cellar <lb/>
and get some more. I said:</p>
<p>"My dear, it is a laborious job, and the child <lb/>
must be nearly warm enough, with her extra <lb/>
clothing. Now mightn't we put on another layer <lb/>
of poultices and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>I did not finish, because I was interrupted. I <lb/>
<pb n="108"/>
lugged wood up from below for some little time, <lb/>
and then turned in and fell to snoring as only a man <lb/>
can whose strength is all gone and whose soul is <lb/>
worn out. Just at broad daylight I felt a grip on <lb/>
my shoulder that brought me to my senses sud- <lb/>
denly. My wife was glaring down upon me and <lb/>
gasping. As soon as she could command her <lb/>
tongue she said:</p>
<p>"It is all over! All over! The child's perspir- <lb/>
ing! What <i>shall</i> we do?"</p>
<p>"Mercy, how you terrify me! <i>I</i> don't know <lb/>
what we ought to do. Maybe if we scraped her <lb/>
and put her in the draft again&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, idiot! There is not a moment to lose! <lb/>
Go for the doctor. Go yourself. Tell him he <i>must</i> <lb/>
come, dead or alive."</p>
<p>I dragged that poor sick man from his bed and <lb/>
brought him. He looked at the child and said she <lb/>
was not dying. This was joy unspeakable to me, <lb/>
but it made my wife as mad as if he had offered her <lb/>
a personal affront. Then he said the child's cough <lb/>
was only caused by some trifling irritation or other <lb/>
in the throat. At this I thought my wife had a <lb/>
mind to show him the door. Now the doctor said <lb/>
he would make the child cough harder and dislodge <lb/>
the trouble. So he gave her something that sent <lb/>
her into a spasm of coughing, and presently up <lb/>
came a little wood splinter or so.</p>
<p>"This child has no membranous croup," said <lb/>
he. "She has been chewing a bit of pine shingle <lb/>
<pb n="109"/>
or something of the kind, and got some little slivers <lb/>
in her throat. They won't do her any hurt."</p>
<p>"No," said I, "I can well believe that. Indeed, <lb/>
the turpentine that is in them is very good for cer- <lb/>
tain sorts of diseases that are peculiar to children. <lb/>
My wife will tell you so."</p>
<p>But she did not. She turned away in disdain and <lb/>
left the room; and since that time there is one epi- <lb/>
sode in our life which we never refer to. Hence <lb/>
the tide of our days flows by in deep and untroubled <lb/>
serenity.</p>

would give it a passing interest to the reader.]</q>

<head><b>MY FIRST LITERARY VENTURE</b></head>
<p><smcap>I was</smcap> a very smart child at the age of thirteen&#x2014; <lb/>
an unusually smart child, I thought at the time. <lb/>
It was then that I did my first newspaper scribbling, <lb/>
and most unexpectedly to me it stirred up a fine <lb/>
sensation in the community. It did, indeed, and <lb/>
I was very proud of it, too. I was a printer's <lb/>
"devil," and a progressive and aspiring one. My <lb/>
uncle had me on his paper (the <i>Weekly Hannibal <lb/>
Journal</i>, two dollars a year in advance&#x2014;five hun- <lb/>
dred subscribers, and they paid in cordwood, cab- <lb/>
bages, and unmarketable turnips), and on a lucky <lb/>
summer's day he left town to be gone a week, and <lb/>
asked me if I thought I could edit one issue of the <lb/>
paper judiciously. Ah! didn't I want to try! Hig- <lb/>
gins was the editor on the rival paper. He had <lb/>
lately been jilted, and one night a friend found an <lb/>
open note on the poor fellow's bed, in which he <lb/>
stated that he could no longer endure life and had <lb/>
drowned himself in Bear Creek. The friend ran <lb/>
down there and discovered Higgins wading back to <lb/>
shore. He had concluded he wouldn't. The village <lb/>
was full of it for several days, but Higgins did not <lb/>
<pb n="111"/>
suspect it. I thought this was a fine opportunity. <lb/>
I wrote an elaborately wretched account of the whole <lb/>
matter, and then illustrated it with villainous cuts <lb/>
engraved on the bottoms of wooden type with a <lb/>
jackknife&#x2014;one of them a picture of Higgins <lb/>
wading out into the creek in his shirt, with a lan- <lb/>
tern, sounding the depth of the water with a walking <lb/>
stick. I thought it was desperately funny, and was <lb/>
densely unconscious that there was any moral obli- <lb/>
quity about such a publication. Being satisfied with <lb/>
this effort I looked around for other worlds to con- <lb/>
quer, and it struck me that it would make good, <lb/>
interesting matter to charge the editor of a neighbor- <lb/>
ing country paper with a piece of gratuitous rascality <lb/>
and "see him squirm."</p>
<p>I did it, putting the article into the form of a <lb/>
parody on the "Burial of Sir John Moore"&#x2014;and <lb/>
a pretty crude parody it was, too.</p>
<p>Then I lampooned two prominent citizens out- <lb/>
rageously&#x2014;not because they had done anything to <lb/>
deserve it, but merely because I thought it was my <lb/>
duty to make the paper lively.</p>
<p>Next I gently touched up the newest stranger&#x2014; <lb/>
the lion of the day, the gorgeous journeyman tailor <lb/>
from Quincy. He was a simpering coxcomb of the <lb/>
first water, and the "loudest" dressed man in the <lb/>
State. He was an inveterate woman-killer. Every <lb/>
week he wrote lushy "poetry" for the "Journal," <lb/>
about his newest conquest. His rhymes for my <lb/>
week were headed, "<smcap>To Mary in</smcap> H<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/><smcap>l</smcap>," mean- <lb/>
<pb n="112"/>
ing to Mary in Hannibal, of course. But while set- <lb/>
ting up the piece I was suddenly riven from head to <lb/>
heel by what I regarded as a perfect thunderbolt of <lb/>
humor, and I compressed it into a snappy footnote <lb/>
at the bottom&#x2014;thus: "We will let this thing pass, <lb/>
just this once; but we wish Mr. J. Gordon Runnels <lb/>
to understand distinctly that we have a character to <lb/>
sustain, and from this time forth when he wants to <lb/>
commune with his friends in h&#x2014;l, he must select <lb/>
some other medium than the columns of this <lb/>
journal!"</p>
<p>The paper came out, and I never knew any little <lb/>
thing attract so much attention as those playful <lb/>
trifles of mine.</p>
<p>For once the <i>Hannibal Journal</i> was in demand&#x2014; <lb/>
a novelty it had not experienced before. The whole <lb/>
town was stirred. Higgins dropped in with a double- <lb/>
barreled shotgun early in the forenoon. When he <lb/>
found that it was an infant (as he called me) that <lb/>
had done him the damage, he simply pulled my ears <lb/>
and went away; but he threw up his situation that <lb/>
night and left town for good. The tailor came with <lb/>
his goose and a pair of shears; but he despised me, <lb/>
too, and departed for the South that night. The <lb/>
two lampooned citizens came with threats of libel, <lb/>
and went away incensed at my insignificance. The <lb/>
country editor pranced in with a warwhoop next <lb/>
day, suffering for blood to drink; but he ended by <lb/>
forgiving me cordially and inviting me down to the <lb/>
drug store to wash away all animosity in a friendly <lb/>
<pb n="113"/>
bumper of "Fahnestock's Vermifuge." It was his <lb/>
little joke. My uncle was very angry when he got <lb/>
back&#x2014;unreasonably so, I thought, considering what <lb/>
an impetus I had given the paper, and considering <lb/>
also that gratitude for his preservation ought to have <lb/>
been uppermost in his mind, inasmuch as by his <lb/>
delay he had so wonderfully escaped dissection, <lb/>
tomahawking, libel, and getting his head shot off. <lb/>
But he softened when he looked at the accounts and <lb/>
saw that I had actually booked the unparalleled <lb/>
number of thirty-three new subscribers, and had the <lb/>
vegetables to show for it, cordwood, cabbage, beans, <lb/>
and unsalable turnips enough to run the family for <lb/>
two years!</p>

<p><smcap>It</smcap> is seldom pleasant to tell on one's self, but <lb/>
sometimes it is a sort of relief to a man to make <lb/>
a confession. I wish to unburden my mind now, <lb/>
and yet I almost believe that I am moved to do it <lb/>
more because I long to bring censure upon another <lb/>
man than because I desire to pour balm upon my <lb/>
wounded heart. (I don't know what balm is, but I <lb/>
believe it is the correct expression to use in this <lb/>
connection&#x2014;never having seen any balm.) You <lb/>
may remember that I lectured in Newark lately for <lb/>
the young gentlemen of the <gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> Society? I did <lb/>
at any rate. During the afternoon of that day I <lb/>
was talking with one of the young gentlemen just <lb/>
referred to, and he said he had an uncle who, from <lb/>
some cause or other, seemed to have grown per- <lb/>
manently bereft of all emotion. And with tears in <lb/>
his eyes, this young man said, "Oh, if I could only <lb/>
see him laugh once more! Oh, if I could only see <lb/>
him weep!" I was touched. I could never with- <lb/>
stand distress.</p>
<pb n="115"/>
<p>I said: "Bring him to my lecture. I'll start him <lb/>
for you."</p>
<p>"Oh, if you could but do it! If you could but <lb/>
do it, all our family would bless you for evermore&#x2014; <lb/>
for he is so very dear to us. Oh, my benefactor, <lb/>
can you make him laugh? can you bring soothing <lb/>
tears to those parched orbs?"</p>
<p>I was profoundly moved. I said: "My son, <lb/>
bring the old party round. I have got some jokes <lb/>
in that lecture that will make him laugh if there is <lb/>
any laugh in him; and if they miss fire, I have got <lb/>
some others that will make him cry or kill him, one <lb/>
or the other." Then the young man blessed me, <lb/>
and wept on my neck, and went after his uncle. <lb/>
He placed him in full view, in the second row of <lb/>
benches that night, and I began on him. I tried <lb/>
him with mild jokes, then with severe ones; I dosed <lb/>
him with bad jokes and riddled him with good ones; <lb/>
I fired old stale jokes into him, and peppered him <lb/>
fore and aft with red-hot new ones; I warmed up to <lb/>
my work, and assaulted him on the right and left, in <lb/>
front and behind; I fumed and sweated and charged <lb/>
and ranted till I was hoarse and sick and frantic and <lb/>
furious; but I never moved him once&#x2014;I never <lb/>
started a smile or a tear! Never a ghost of a smile, <lb/>
and never a suspicion of moisture! I was astounded. <lb/>
I closed the lecture at last with one despairing shriek <lb/>
&#x2014;with one wild burst of humor, and hurled a joke <lb/>
of supernatural atrocity full at him!</p>
<p>Then I sat down bewildered and exhausted.</p>
<pb n="116"/>
<p>The president of the society came up and bathed <lb/>
my head with cold water, and said: "What made <lb/>
you carry on so toward the last?"</p>
<p>I said: "I was trying to make that confounded <lb/>
old fool laugh, in the second row."</p>
<p>And he said: "Well, you were wasting your <lb/>
time, because he is deaf and dumb, and as blind as <lb/>
a badger!"</p>
<p>Now, was that any way for that old man's nephew <lb/>
to impose on a stranger and orphan like me? I ask <lb/>
you as a man and brother, if that was any way for <lb/>
him to do?</p>

<p><smcap>He</smcap> arrives just as regularly as the clock strikes <lb/>
nine in the morning. And so he even beats <lb/>
the editor sometimes, and the porter must leave his <lb/>
work and climb two or three pair of stairs to unlock <lb/>
the "Sanctum" door and let him in. He lights <lb/>
one of the office pipes&#x2014;not reflecting, perhaps, <lb/>
that the editor may be one of those "stuck-up" <lb/>
people who would as soon have a stranger defile his <lb/>
toothbrush as his pipestem. Then he begins to <lb/>
loll&#x2014;for a person who can consent to loaf his use- <lb/>
less life away in ignominious indolence has not the <lb/>
energy to sit up straight. He stretches full length <lb/>
on the sofa a while; then draws up to half length; <lb/>
then gets into a chair, hangs his head back and his <lb/>
arms abroad, and stretches his legs till the rims of <lb/>
his boot-heels rest upon the floor; by and by sits <lb/>
up and leans forward, with one leg or both over the <lb/>
arm of the chair. But it is still observable that with <lb/>
all his changes of position, he never assumes the <lb/>
upright or a fraudful affectation of dignity. From <lb/>
time to time he yawns, and stretches, and scratches <lb/>
<pb n="118"/>
himself with a tranquil, mangy enjoyment, and now <lb/>
and then he grunts a kind of stuffy, overfed grunt, <lb/>
which is full of animal contentment. At rare and <lb/>
long intervals, however, he sighs a sigh that is the <lb/>
eloquent expression of a secret confession, to wit: <lb/>
"I am useless and a nuisance, a cumberer of the <lb/>
earth." The bore and his comrades&#x2014;for there <lb/>
are usually from two to four on hand, day and <lb/>
night&#x2014;mix into the conversation when men come <lb/>
in to see the editors for a moment on business; <lb/>
they hold noisy talks among themselves about poli- <lb/>
tics in particular, and all other subjects in general&#x2014; <lb/>
even warming up, after a fashion, sometimes, and <lb/>
seeming to take almost a real interest in what they <lb/>
are discussing. They ruthlessly call an editor from <lb/>
his work with such a remark as: "Did you see this, <lb/>
Smith, in the <i>Gazette?</i>" and proceed to read the <lb/>
paragraph while the sufferer reins in his impatient <lb/>
pen and listens; they often loll and sprawl round <lb/>
the office hour after hour, swapping anecdotes and <lb/>
relating personal experiences to each other&#x2014;hair- <lb/>
breadth escapes, social encounters with distinguished <lb/>
men, election reminiscences, sketches of odd char- <lb/>
acters, etc. And through all those hours they never <lb/>
seem to comprehend that they are robbing the <lb/>
editors of their time, and the public of journalistic <lb/>
excellence in next day's paper. At other times <lb/>
they drowse, or dreamily pore over exchanges, or <lb/>
droop limp and pensive over the chair-arms for an <lb/>
hour. Even this solemn silence is small respite to <lb/>
<pb n="119"/>
the editor, for the next uncomfortable thing to <lb/>
having people look over his shoulders, perhaps, is <lb/>
to have them sit by in silence and listen to the <lb/>
scratching of his pen. If a body desires to talk <lb/>
private business with one of the editors, he must <lb/>
call him outside, for no hint milder than blasting <lb/>
powder or nitro-glycerine would be likely to move <lb/>
the bores out of listening distance. To have to sit <lb/>
and endure the presence of a bore day after day; to <lb/>
feel your cheerful spirits begin to sink as his foot- <lb/>
step sounds on the stair, and utterly vanish away <lb/>
as his tiresome form enters the door; to suffer <lb/>
through his anecdotes and die slowly to his reminis- <lb/>
cences; to feel always the fetters of his clogging <lb/>
presence; to long hopelessly for one single day's <lb/>
privacy; to note with a shudder, by and by, that to <lb/>
contemplate his funeral in fancy has ceased to <lb/>
soothe, to imagine him undergoing in strict and <lb/>
fearful detail the tortures of the ancient Inquisition <lb/>
has lost its power to satisfy the heart, and that even <lb/>
to wish him millions and millions and millions of <lb/>
miles in Tophet is able to bring only a fitful gleam <lb/>
of joy; to have to endure all this, day after day, <lb/>
and week after week, and month after month, is an <lb/>
affliction that transcends any other that men suffer. <lb/>
Physical pain is pastime to it, and hanging a pleasure <lb/>

GREAT BEEF CONTRACT</b><ref target="n18">*</ref><note id="n18" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1867.</p></note></head>
<p><smcap>In</smcap> as few words as possible I wish to lay before <lb/>
the nation what share, howsoever small, I have <lb/>
had in this matter&#x2014;this matter which has so exer- <lb/>
cised the public mind, engendered so much ill- <lb/>
feeling, and so filled the newspapers of both con- <lb/>
tinents with distorted statements and extravagant <lb/>
comments.</p>
<p>The origin of this distressful thing was this&#x2014;and <lb/>
I assert here that every fact in the following <i>r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E8;</i> <lb/>
can be amply proved by the official records of the <lb/>
General Government:</p>
<p>John Wilson Mackenzie, of Rotterdam, Chemung <lb/>
county, New Jersey, deceased, contracted with the <lb/>
General Government, on or about the 10th day of <lb/>
October, 1861, to furnish to General Sherman the <lb/>
sum total of thirty barrels of beef.</p>
<p>Very well.</p>
<p>He started after Sherman with the beef, but when <lb/>
he got to Washington Sherman had gone to Manas- <lb/>
sas; so he took the beef and followed him there, <lb/>
<pb n="122"/>
but arrived too late; he followed him to Nashville, <lb/>
and from Nashville to Chattanooga, and from Chat- <lb/>
tanooga to Atlanta&#x2014;but he never could overtake <lb/>
him. At Atlanta he took a fresh start and followed <lb/>
him clear through his march to the sea. He arrived <lb/>
too late again by a few days; but hearing that Sher- <lb/>
man was going out in the <i>Quaker City</i> excursion to <lb/>
the Holy Land, he took shipping for Beirut, calcu- <lb/>
lating to head off the other vessel. When he arrived <lb/>
in Jerusalem with his beef, he learned that Sherman <lb/>
had not sailed in the <i>Quaker City</i>, but had gone to <lb/>
the Plains to fight the Indians. He returned to <lb/>
America and started for the Rocky Mountains. <lb/>
After sixty-eight days of arduous travel on the <lb/>
Plains, and when he had got within four miles of <lb/>
Sherman's headquarters, he was tomahawked and <lb/>
scalped, and the Indians got the beef. They got <lb/>
all of it but one barrel. Sherman's army captured <lb/>
that, and so, even in death, the bold navigator partly <lb/>
fulfilled his contract. In his will, which he had kept <lb/>
like a journal, he bequeathed the contract to his son <lb/>
Bartholomew W. Bartholomew W. made out the <lb/>
following bill, and then died:</p>

<p>He died then; but he left the contract to Wm. J. <lb/>
Martin, who tried to collect it, but died before he <lb/>
got through. <i>He</i> left it to Barker J. Allen, and he <lb/>
tried to collect it also. He did not survive. Barker <lb/>
J. Allen left it to Anson G. Rogers, who attempted <lb/>
to collect it, and got along as far as the Ninth <lb/>
Auditor's Office, when Death, the great Leveler, <lb/>
came all unsummoned, and foreclosed on <i>him</i> also. <lb/>
He left the bill to a relative of his in Connecticut, <lb/>
Vengeance Hopkins by name, who lasted four weeks <lb/>
and two days, and made the best time on record, <lb/>
coming within one of reaching the Twelfth Auditor. <lb/>
In his will he gave the contract bill to his uncle, by <lb/>
the name of O-be-joyful Johnson. It was too under- <lb/>
mining for Joyful. His last words were: "Weep <lb/>
not for me&#x2014;<i>I</i> am willing to go." And so he was, <lb/>
poor soul. Seven people inherited the contract <lb/>
after that; but they all died. So it came into my <lb/>
hands at last. It fell to me through a relative by <lb/>
the name of Hubbard&#x2014;Bethlehem Hubbard, of <lb/>
Indiana. He had had a grudge against me for a <lb/>
long time; but in his last moments he sent for me, <lb/>
and forgave me everything, and weeping gave me <lb/>
the beef contract.</p>
<p>This ends the history of it up to the time that I <lb/>
succeeded to the property. I will now endeavor to <lb/>
set myself straight before the nation in everything <lb/>
that concerns my share in the matter. I took this <lb/>
beef contract, and the bill for mileage and trans- <lb/>
portation, to the President of the United States.</p>
<pb n="124"/>
<p>He said, "Well, sir, what can I do for you?"</p>
<p>I said, "Sire, on or about the 10th day of Oc- <lb/>
tober, 1861, John Wilson Mackenzie, of Rotterdam, <lb/>
Chemung county, New Jersey, deceased, contracted <lb/>
with the General Government to furnish to General <lb/>
Sherman the sum total of thirty barrels of beef&#x2014;"</p>
<p>He stopped me there, and dismissed me from his <lb/>
presence&#x2014;kindly, but firmly. The next day I <lb/>
called on the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>He said, "Well, sir?"</p>
<p>I said, "Your Royal Highness: on or about the <lb/>
10th day of October, 1861, John Wilson Mackenzie, <lb/>
of Rotterdam, Chemung county, New Jersey, de- <lb/>
ceased, contracted with the General Government to <lb/>
furnish to General Sherman the sum total of thirty <lb/>
barrels of beef&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"That will do, sir&#x2014;that will do; this office has <lb/>
nothing to do with contracts for beef."</p>
<p>I was bowed out. I thought the matter all over, <lb/>
and finally, the following day, I visited the Secretary <lb/>
of the Navy, who said, "Speak quickly, sir; do not <lb/>
keep me waiting."</p>
<p>I said, "Your Royal Highness, on or about the <lb/>
10th day of October, 1861, John Wilson Mackenzie, <lb/>
of Rotterdam, Chemung county, New Jersey, de- <lb/>
ceased, contracted with the General Government to <lb/>
furnish to General Sherman the sum total of thirty <lb/>
barrels of beef&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Well, it was as far as I could get. <i>He</i> had noth- <lb/>
ing to do with beef contracts for General Sherman, <lb/>
<pb n="125"/>
either. I began to think it was a curious kind of a <lb/>
government. It looked somewhat as if they wanted <lb/>
to get out of paying for that beef. The following <lb/>
day I went to the Secretary of the Interior.</p>
<p>I said, "Your Imperial Highness, on or about <lb/>
the 10th day of October&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"That is sufficient, sir. I have heard of you be- <lb/>
fore. Go, take your infamous beef contract out of <lb/>
this establishment. The Interior Department has <lb/>
nothing whatever to do with subsistence for the <lb/>
army."</p>
<p>I went away. But I was exasperated now. I <lb/>
said I would haunt them; I would infest every de- <lb/>
partment of this iniquitous Government till that con- <lb/>
tract business was settled. I would collect that bill, <lb/>
or fall, as fell my predecessors, trying. I assailed <lb/>
the Postmaster-General; I besieged the Agricultural <lb/>
Department; I waylaid the Speaker of the House of <lb/>
Representatives. <i>They</i> had nothing to do with army <lb/>
contracts for beef. I moved upon the Commissioner <lb/>
of the Patent Office.</p>
<p>I said, "Your August Excellency, on or about&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Perdition! have you got <i>here</i> with your incen- <lb/>
diary beef contract, at last? We have <i>nothing</i> to do <lb/>
with beef contracts for the army, my dear sir."</p>
<p>"Oh, that is all very well&#x2014;but <i>somebody</i> has <lb/>
got to pay for that beef. It has got to be paid <i>now</i>, <lb/>
too, or I'll confiscate this old Patent Office and <lb/>
everything in it."</p>
<p>"But, my dear sir&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="126"/>
<p>"It don't make any difference, sir. The Patent <lb/>
Office is liable for that beef, I reckon; and, liable or <lb/>
not liable, the Patent Office has got to pay for it."</p>
<p>Never mind the details. It ended in a fight. The <lb/>
Patent Office won. But I found out something to <lb/>
my advantage. I was told that the Treasury Depart- <lb/>
ment was the proper place for me to go to. I went <lb/>
there. I waited two hours and a half, and then I <lb/>
was admitted to the First Lord of the Treasury.</p>
<p>I said, "Most noble, grave, and reverend Signor, <lb/>
on or about the 10th day of October, 1861, John <lb/>
Wilson Macken&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"That is sufficient, sir. I have heard of you. <lb/>
Go to the First Auditor of the Treasury."</p>
<p>I did so. He sent me to the Second Auditor. <lb/>
The Second Auditor sent me to the Third, and the <lb/>
Third sent me to the First Comptroller of the Corn- <lb/>
Beef Division. This began to look like business. <lb/>
He examined his books and all his loose papers, but <lb/>
found no minute of the beef contract. I went to <lb/>
the Second Comptroller of the Corn-Beef Division. <lb/>
He examined his books and his loose papers, but <lb/>
with no success. I was encouraged. During that <lb/>
week I got as far as the Sixth Comptroller in that <lb/>
division; the next week I got through the Claims <lb/>
Department; the third week I began and completed <lb/>
the Mislaid Contracts Department, and got a foot- <lb/>
hold in the Dead Reckoning Department. I finished <lb/>
that in three days. There was only one place left <lb/>
for it now. I laid siege to the Commissioner of <lb/>
<pb n="127"/>
Odds and Ends. To his clerk, rather&#x2014;he was not <lb/>
there himself. There were sixteen beautiful young <lb/>
ladies in the room, writing in books, and there were <lb/>
seven well-favored young clerks showing them how. <lb/>
The young women smiled up over their shoulders, <lb/>
and the clerks smiled back at them, and all went <lb/>
merry as a marriage bell. Two or three clerks that <lb/>
were reading the newspapers looked at me rather <lb/>
hard, but went on reading, and nobody said anything. <lb/>
However, I had been used to this kind of alacrity from <lb/>
Fourth Assistant Junior Clerks all through my event- <lb/>
ful career, from the very day I entered the first office <lb/>
of the Corn-Beef Bureau clear till I passed out of <lb/>
the last one in the Dead Reckoning Division. I had <lb/>
got so accomplished by this time that I could stand <lb/>
on one foot from the moment I entered an office till <lb/>
a clerk spoke to me, without changing more than <lb/>
two, or maybe three, times.</p>
<p>So I stood there till I had changed four different <lb/>
times. Then I said to one of the clerks who was <lb/>
reading:</p>
<p>"Illustrious Vagrant, where is the Grand Turk?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean, sir? whom do you mean? <lb/>
If you mean the Chief of the Bureau, he is out."</p>
<p>"Will he visit the harem to-day?"</p>
<p>The young man glared upon me a while, and then <lb/>
went on reading his paper. But I knew the ways of <lb/>
those clerks. I knew I was safe if he got through <lb/>
before another New York mail arrived. He only <lb/>
had two more papers left. After a while he finished <lb/>
<pb n="128"/>
them, and then he yawned and asked me what I <lb/>
wanted.</p>
<p>"Renowned and honored Imbecile: on or <lb/>
about&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"You are the beef contract man. Give me your <lb/>
papers."</p>
<p>He took them, and for a long time he ransacked <lb/>
his odds and ends. Finally he found the North- <lb/>
west Passage, as <i>I</i> regarded it&#x2014;he found the long <lb/>
lost record of that beef contract&#x2014;he found the <lb/>
rock upon which so many of my ancestors had split <lb/>
before they ever got to it. I was deeply moved. <lb/>
And yet I rejoiced&#x2014;for I had survived. I said <lb/>
with emotion, "Give it me. The Government will <lb/>
settle now." He waved me back, and said there <lb/>
was something yet to be done first.</p>
<p>"Where is this John Wilson Mackenzie?" said <lb/>
he.</p>
<p>"Dead."</p>
<p>"When did he die?"</p>
<p>"He didn't die at all&#x2014;he was killed."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"Tomahawked."</p>
<p>"Who tomahawked him?"</p>
<p>"Why, an Indian, of course. You didn't sup- <lb/>
pose it was the superintendent of a Sunday-school, <lb/>
did you?"</p>
<p>"No. An Indian, was it?"</p>
<p>"The same."</p>
<p>"Name of the Indian?"</p>
<pb n="129"/>
<p>"His name? <i>I</i> don't know his name."</p>
<p>"<i>Must</i> have his name. Who saw the tomahawk- <lb/>
ing done?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"You were not present yourself, then?"</p>
<p>"Which you can see by my hair. I was absent."</p>
<p>"Then how do you know that Mackenzie is <lb/>
dead?"</p>
<p>"Because he certainly died at that time, and I <lb/>
have every reason to believe that he has been dead <lb/>
ever since. I <i>know</i> he has, in fact."</p>
<p>"We must have proofs. Have you got the <lb/>
Indian?"</p>
<p>"Of course not."</p>
<p>"Well, you must get him. Have you got the <lb/>
tomahawk?"</p>
<p>"I never thought of such a thing."</p>
<p>"You must get the tomahawk. You must pro- <lb/>
duce the Indian and the tomahawk. If Mackenzie's <lb/>
death can be proven by these, you can then go before <lb/>
the commission appointed to audit claims with some <lb/>
show of getting your bill under such headway that <lb/>
your children may possibly live to receive the money <lb/>
and enjoy it. But that man's death <i>must</i> be proven. <lb/>
However, I may as well tell you that the Government <lb/>
will never pay that transportation and those travel- <lb/>
ing expenses of the lamented Mackenzie. It <i>may</i> <lb/>
possibly pay for the barrel of beef that Sherman's <lb/>
soldiers captured, if you can get a relief bill through <lb/>
Congress making an appropriation for that purpose; <lb/>
<pb n="130"/>
but it will not pay for the twenty-nine barrels the <lb/>
Indians ate."</p>
<p>"Then there is only a hundred dollars due me, <lb/>
and <i>that</i> isn't certain! After all Mackenzie's travels <lb/>
in Europe, Asia, and America with that beef; after <lb/>
all his trials and tribulations and transportation; <lb/>
after the slaughter of all those innocents that tried <lb/>
to collect that bill! Young man, why didn't the <lb/>
First Comptroller of the Corn-Beef Division tell me <lb/>
this?"</p>
<p>"He didn't know anything about the genuineness <lb/>
of your claim."</p>
<p>"Why didn't the Second tell me? why didn't the <lb/>
Third? why didn't all those divisions and depart- <lb/>
ments tell me?"</p>
<p>"None of them knew. We do things by routine <lb/>
here. You have followed the routine and found out <lb/>
what you wanted to know. It is the best way. It <lb/>
is the only way. It is very regular, and very slow, <lb/>
but it is very certain."</p>
<p>"Yes, certain death. It has been, to the most <lb/>
of our tribe. I begin to feel that I, too, am called. <lb/>
Young man, you love the bright creature yonder <lb/>
with the gentle blue eyes and the steel pens behind <lb/>
her ears&#x2014;I see it in your soft glances; you wish to <lb/>
marry her&#x2014;but you are poor. Here, hold out <lb/>
your hand&#x2014;here is the beef contract; go, take her <lb/>
and be happy! Heaven bless you, my children!"</p>
<p>This is all I know about the great beef contract <lb/>
that has created so much talk in the community. <lb/>
<pb n="131"/>
The clerk to whom I bequeathed it died. I know <lb/>
nothing further about the contract, or any one con- <lb/>
nected with it. I only know that if a man lives long <lb/>
enough he can trace a thing through the Circumlo- <lb/>
cution Office of Washington and find out, after <lb/>
much labor and trouble and delay, that which he <lb/>
could have found out on the first day if the business <lb/>
of the Circumlocution Office were as ingeniously <lb/>
systematized as it would be if it were a great private <lb/>
mercantile institution.</p>

<head><b>THE CASE OF GEORGE FISHER</b><ref target="n19">*</ref><note id="n19" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Some years ago, about 1867, when this was first published, few peo- <lb/>

it seems hard to realize that there was ever a time when the robbing of <lb/>
our government was a novelty. The very man who showed me where to <lb/>
find the documents for this case was at that very time spending hundreds <lb/>
of thousands of dollars in Washington for a mail steamship concern, in <lb/>
the effort to procure a subsidy for the company&#x2014;a fact which was a <lb/>
long time in coming to the surface, but leaked out at last and underwent <lb/>
Congressional investigation.</p></note></head>
<p><smcap>This</smcap> is history. It is not a wild extravaganza, <lb/>
like "John Williamson Mackenzie's Great Beef <lb/>
Contract," but is a plain statement of facts and cir- <lb/>
cumstances with which the Congress of the United <lb/>
States has interested itself from time to time during <lb/>
the long period of half a century.</p>
<p>I will not call this matter of George Fisher's a <lb/>
great deathless and unrelenting swindle upon the <lb/>
Government and people of the United States&#x2014;for <lb/>
it has never been so decided, and I hold that it is a <lb/>
grave and solemn wrong for a writer to cast slurs or <lb/>
call names when such is the case&#x2014;but will simply <lb/>
present the evidence and let the reader deduce his <lb/>
own verdict. Then we shall do nobody injustice, <lb/>
and our consciences shall be clear.</p>
<pb n="133"/>
<p>On or about the 1st day of September, 1813, the <lb/>
Creek war being then in progress in Florida, the <lb/>
crops, herds, and houses of Mr. George Fisher, a <lb/>
citizen, were destroyed, either by the Indians or by <lb/>
the United States troops in pursuit of them. By <lb/>
the terms of the law, if the <i>Indians</i> destroyed the <lb/>
property, there was no relief for Fisher; but if the <lb/>
<i>troops</i> destroyed it, the Government of the United <lb/>
States was debtor to Fisher for the amount in- <lb/>
volved.</p>
<p>George Fisher must have considered that the <i>In- <lb/>
dians</i> destroyed the property, because, although he <lb/>
lived several years afterward, he does not appear to <lb/>
have ever made any claim upon the Government.</p>
<p>In the course of time Fisher died, and his widow <lb/>
married again. And by and by, nearly twenty years <lb/>
after that dimly-remembered raid upon Fisher's <lb/>
cornfields, <i>the widow Fisher's new husband</i> peti- <lb/>
tioned Congress for pay for the property, and backed <lb/>
up the petition with many depositions and affidavits <lb/>
which purported to prove that the troops, and not <lb/>
the Indians, destroyed the property; that the troops, <lb/>
for some inscrutable reason, deliberately burned <lb/>
down "houses" (or cabins) valued at &#x0024;600, the <lb/>
same belonging to a peaceable private citizen, and <lb/>
also destroyed various other property belonging to <lb/>
the same citizen. But Congress declined to believe <lb/>
that the troops were such idiots (after overtaking <lb/>
and scattering a band of Indians proved to have <lb/>
been found destroying Fisher's property) as to <lb/>
<pb n="134"/>
calmly continue the work of destruction themselves, <lb/>
and make a complete job of what the Indians had <lb/>
only commenced. So Congress denied the petition <lb/>
of the heirs of George Fisher in 1832, and did not <lb/>
pay them a cent.</p>
<p>We hear no more from them officially until 1848, <lb/>
sixteen years after their first attempt on the Treas- <lb/>
ury, and a full generation after the death of the man <lb/>
whose fields were destroyed. The new generation <lb/>
of Fisher heirs then came forward and put in a bill <lb/>
for damages. The Second Auditor awarded them <lb/>
&#x0024;8,873, being half the damage sustained by Fisher. <lb/>
The Auditor said the testimony showed that at least <lb/>
half the destruction was done by the Indians "<i>before <lb/>
the troops started in pursuit</i>," and of course the Gov- <lb/>
ernment was not responsible for that half.</p>
<p>2. That was in April, 1848. In December, 1848, <lb/>
the heirs of George Fisher, deceased, came forward <lb/>
and pleaded for a "revision" of their bill of dam- <lb/>
ages. The revision was made, but nothing new <lb/>
could be found in their favor except an error of <lb/>
&#x0024;100 in the former calculation. However, in order <lb/>
to keep up the spirits of the Fisher family, the <lb/>
Auditor concluded to go back and allow <i>interest</i> <lb/>
from the date of the first petition (1832) to the date <lb/>
when the bill of damages was awarded. This sent <lb/>
the Fishers home happy with sixteen years' interest <lb/>
on &#x0024;8,873&#x2014;the same amounting to &#x0024;8,997.94. <lb/>
Total, &#x0024;17,870.94.</p>
<p>3. For an entire year the suffering Fisher family <lb/>
<pb n="135"/>
remained quiet&#x2014;even satisfied, after a fashion. Then <lb/>
they swooped down upon Government with their <lb/>
wrongs once more. That old patriot, Attorney-Gen- <lb/>
eral Toucey, burrowed through the musty papers of <lb/>
the Fishers and discovered one more chance for the <lb/>
desolate orphans&#x2014;interest on that original award <lb/>
of &#x0024;8,873 from date of destruction of the property <lb/>
(1813) up to 1832! Result, &#x0024;10,004.89 for the <lb/>
indigent Fishers. So now we have: First, &#x0024;8,873 <lb/>
damages; second, interest on it from 1832 to 1848, <lb/>
&#x0024;8,997.94: third, interest on it dated back to 1813, <lb/>
&#x0024;10,004.89. Total, &#x0024;27,875.83! What better in- <lb/>
vestment for a great-grandchild than to get the <lb/>
Indians to burn a cornfield for him sixty or seventy <lb/>
years before his birth, and plausibly lay it on lunatic <lb/>
United States troops?</p>
<p>4. Strange as it may seem, the Fishers let Con- <lb/>
gress alone for five years&#x2014;or, what is perhaps <lb/>
more likely, failed to make themselves heard by <lb/>
Congress for that length of time. But at last, in <lb/>
1854, they got a hearing. They persuaded Congress <lb/>
to pass an act requiring the Auditor to re-examine <lb/>
their case. But this time they stumbled upon the <lb/>
misfortune of an honest Secretary of the Treasury <lb/>
(Mr. James Guthrie), and he spoiled everything. <lb/>
He said in very plain language that the Fishers were <lb/>
not only not entitled to another cent, but that those <lb/>
children of many sorrows and acquainted with grief <lb/>
<i>had been paid too much already</i>.</p>
<p>5. Therefore another interval of rest and silence <lb/>
<pb n="136"/>
ensued&#x2014;an interval which lasted four years&#x2014;viz., <lb/>
till 1858. The "right man in the right place" was <lb/>
then Secretary of War&#x2014;John B. Floyd, of peculiar <lb/>
renown! Here was a master intellect; here was the <lb/>
very man to succor the suffering heirs of dead and <lb/>
forgotten Fisher. They came up from Florida with <lb/>
a rush&#x2014;a great tidal wave of Fishers freighted with <lb/>
the same old musty documents about the same im- <lb/>
mortal cornfields of their ancestor. They straight- <lb/>
way got an act passed transferring the Fisher matter <lb/>
from the dull Auditor to the ingenious Floyd. <lb/>
What did Floyd do? He said, "<smcap>it was proved</smcap> <lb/>
<i>that the Indians destroyed everything they could before <lb/>
the troops entered in pursuit</i>." He considered, there- <lb/>
fore, that what they destroyed must have consisted <lb/>
of "<i>the houses with all their contents, and the <lb/>
liquor</i>" (the most trifling part of the destruction, <lb/>
and set down at only &#x0024;3,200 all told), and that the <lb/>
Government troops then drove them off and calmly <lb/>
proceeded to destroy&#x2014;</p>
<p><i>Two hundred and twenty acres of corn in the field, <lb/>
thirty-five acres of wheat, and nine hundred and <lb/>
eighty-six head of live stock!</i> [What a singularly <lb/>
intelligent army we had in those days, according to <lb/>
Mr. Floyd&#x2014;though not according to the Congress <lb/>
of 1832.]</p>
<p>So Mr. Floyd decided that the Government was <lb/>
not responsible for that &#x0024;3,200 worth of rubbish <lb/>
which the Indians destroyed, but was responsible for <lb/>
the property destroyed by the troops&#x2014;which prop- <lb/>
<pb n="137"/>
erty consisted of (I quote from the printed United <lb/>
States Senate document):</p>

</row>
</table>
<p>That sum, in his report, Mr. Floyd calls the <lb/>
"<i>full value</i> of the property destroyed by the <lb/>
troops." He allows that sum to the starving Fish- <lb/>
ers, <smcap>together with interest from</smcap> 1813. From <lb/>
this new sum total the amounts already paid to the <lb/>
Fishers were deducted, and then the cheerful re- <lb/>
mainder (a fraction under <i>forty thousand dollars</i>,) <lb/>
was handed to them, and again they retired to <lb/>
Florida in a condition of temporary tranquillity. <lb/>
Their ancestor's farm had now yielded them alto- <lb/>
gether nearly <i>sixty-seven thousand dollars</i> in cash.</p>
<p>6. Does the reader suppose that that was the end <lb/>
of it? Does he suppose those diffident Fishers were <lb/>
satisfied? Let the evidence show. The Fishers <lb/>
were quiet just two years. Then they came swarm- <lb/>
ing up out of the fertile swamps of Florida with <lb/>
their same old documents, and besieged Congress <lb/>
once more. Congress capitulated on the 1st of <lb/>
June, 1860, and instructed Mr. Floyd to overhaul <lb/>
<pb n="138"/>
those papers again and pay that bill. A Treasury <lb/>
clerk was ordered to go through those papers and <lb/>
report to Mr. Floyd what amount was still due the <lb/>
emaciated Fishers. This clerk (I can produce him <lb/>
whenever he is wanted) discovered what was ap- <lb/>
parently a glaring and recent forgery in the papers, <lb/>
whereby a witness's testimony as to the price of <lb/>
corn in Florida in 1813 was made to name double <lb/>
the amount which that witness had originally speci- <lb/>
fied as the price! The clerk not only called his <lb/>
superior's attention to this thing, but in making up <lb/>
his brief of the case called particular attention to it <lb/>
in writing. That part of the brief <i>never got before <lb/>
Congress</i>, nor has Congress ever yet had a hint of a <lb/>
forgery existing among the Fisher papers. Never- <lb/>
theless, on the basis of the double prices (and <lb/>
totally ignoring the clerk's assertion that the figures <lb/>
were manifestly and unquestionably a recent for- <lb/>
gery), Mr. Floyd remarks in his new report that <lb/>
"the testimony, <i>particularly in regard to the corn <lb/>
crops</i>, <smcap>demands a much higher allowance</smcap> than <lb/>
any <i>heretofore</i> made by the Auditor or myself." So <lb/>
he estimates the crop at <i>sixty bushels</i> to the acre <lb/>
(double what Florida acres produce), and then vir- <lb/>
tuously allows pay for only half the crop, <i>but</i> allows <lb/>
<i>two dollars and a half</i> a bushel for that half, when <lb/>
there are rusty old books and documents in the <lb/>
Congressional library to show just what the Fisher <lb/>
testimony showed before the forgery&#x2014;viz., that in <lb/>
the fall of 1813 corn was only worth from &#x0024;1.25 to <lb/>
<pb n="139"/>
&#x0024;1.50 a bushel. Having accomplished this, what <lb/>
does Mr. Floyd do next? Mr. Floyd ("with an <lb/>
earnest desire to execute truly the legislative will," <lb/>
as he piously remarks) goes to work and makes out <lb/>
an entirely new bill of Fisher damages, and in this <lb/>
new bill he placidly <i>ignores the Indians</i> altogether&#x2014; <lb/>
puts no particle of the destruction of the Fisher <lb/>
property upon them, but, even repenting him of <lb/>
charging them with burning the cabins and drinking <lb/>
the whisky and breaking the crockery, lays the <i>entire</i> <lb/>
damage at the door of the imbecile United States <lb/>
troops, down to the very last item! And not only <lb/>
that, but uses the forgery to double the loss of corn <lb/>
at "Bassett's Creek," and uses it again to abso- <lb/>
lutely <i>treble</i> the loss of corn on the "Alabama <lb/>
River." This new and ably conceived and executed <lb/>
bill of Mr. Floyd's figures up as follows (I copy <lb/>
again from the printed United States Senate docu- <lb/>

in his own or any other generation. Subtracting <lb/>
from the above total the &#x0024;67,000 already paid to <lb/>
George Fisher's implacable heirs, Mr. Floyd an- <lb/>
nounced that the government was still indebted to <lb/>
them in the sum of <i>sixty-six thousand five hundred <lb/>
and nineteen dollars and eighty-five cents</i>, "which," <lb/>
Mr. Floyd complacently remarks, "will be paid, <lb/>
accordingly, to the administrator of the estate of <lb/>
George Fisher, deceased, or to his attorney in fact."</p>
<p>But, sadly enough for the destitute orphans, a <lb/>
new President came in just at this time, Buchanan <lb/>
and Floyd went out, and they never got their <lb/>
money. The first thing Congress did in 1861 was <lb/>
<pb n="141"/>
to rescind the resolution of June 1, 1860, under <lb/>
which Mr. Floyd had been ciphering. Then Floyd <lb/>
(and doubtless the heirs of George Fisher likewise) <lb/>
had to give up financial business for a while, and go <lb/>
into the Confederate army and serve their country.</p>
<p>Were the heirs of George Fisher killed? No. <lb/>
They are back now at this very time (July, 1870), <lb/>
beseeching Congress through that blushing and diffi- <lb/>
dent creature, Garrett Davis, to commence making <lb/>
payments again on their interminable and insatiable <lb/>
bill of damages for corn and whisky destroyed by a <lb/>
gang of irresponsible Indians, so long ago that even <lb/>
government red-tape has failed to keep consistent <lb/>
and intelligent track of it.</p>
<p>Now the above are facts. They are history. Any <lb/>
one who doubts it can send to the Senate Document <lb/>
Department of the Capitol for H. R. Ex. Doc. No. <lb/>
21, 36th Congress, 2d Session, and for S. Ex. Doc. <lb/>
No. 106, 41st Congress, 2d Session, and satisfy him- <lb/>
self. The whole case is set forth in the first volume <lb/>
of the Court of Claims Reports.</p>
<p>It is my belief that as long as the continent of <lb/>
America holds together, the heirs of George Fisher, <lb/>
deceased, will still make pilgrimages to Washington <lb/>
from the swamps of Florida, to plead for just a little <lb/>
more cash on their bill of damages (even when they <lb/>
received the last of that sixty-seven thousand dol- <lb/>
lars, they said it was only <i>one-fourth</i> what the Govern- <lb/>
ment owed them on that fruitful cornfield), and as <lb/>
long as they choose to come they will find Garrett <lb/>
<pb n="142"/>
Davises to drag their vampire schemes before Con- <lb/>
gress. This is not the only hereditary fraud (if <lb/>
fraud it is&#x2014;which I have before repeatedly re- <lb/>
marked is not proven) that is being quietly handed <lb/>
down from generation to generation of fathers and <lb/>
sons, through the persecuted Treasury of the United <lb/>
States.</p>

<head><b>DISGRACEFUL PERSECUTION OF A BOY</b></head>
<p><smcap>In</smcap> San Francisco, the other day, "A well-dressed <lb/>
boy, on his way to Sunday-school, was arrested <lb/>
and thrown into the city prison for stoning China- <lb/>
men."</p>
<p>What a commentary is this upon human justice! <lb/>
What sad prominence it gives to our human disposi- <lb/>
tion to tyrannize over the weak! San Francisco has <lb/>
little right to take credit to herself for her treatment <lb/>
of this poor boy. What had the child's education <lb/>
been? How should he suppose it was wrong to <lb/>
stone a Chinaman? Before we side against him, <lb/>
along with outraged San Francisco, let us give him <lb/>
a chance&#x2014;let us hear the testimony for the de- <lb/>
fense.</p>
<p>He was a "well-dressed" boy, and a Sunday- <lb/>
school scholar, and therefore the chances are that <lb/>
his parents were intelligent, well-to-do people, with <lb/>
just enough natural villainy in their composition to <lb/>
make them yearn after the daily papers, and enjoy <lb/>
them; and so this boy had opportunities to learn all <lb/>
through the week how to do right, as well as on <lb/>
Sunday.</p>
<pb n="144"/>
<p>It was in this way that he found out that the great <lb/>
commonwealth of California imposes an unlawful <lb/>
mining-tax upon John the foreigner, and allows <lb/>
Patrick the foreigner to dig gold for nothing&#x2014; <lb/>
probably because the degraded Mongol is at no ex- <lb/>
pense for whisky, and the refined Celt cannot exist <lb/>
without it.</p>
<p>It was in this way that he found out that a re- <lb/>
spectable number of the taxgatherers&#x2014;it would be <lb/>
unkind to say all of them&#x2014;collect the tax twice, <lb/>
instead of once; and that, inasmuch as they do it <lb/>
solely to discourage Chinese immigration into the <lb/>
mines, it is a thing that is much applauded, and <lb/>
likewise regarded as being singularly facetious.</p>
<p>It was in this way that he found out that when a <lb/>
white man robs a sluice-box (by the term white <lb/>
man is meant Spaniards, Mexicans, Portuguese, <lb/>
Irish, Hondurans, Peruvians, Chileans, etc., etc.), <lb/>
they make him leave the camp; and when a China- <lb/>
man does that thing, they hang him.</p>
<p>It was in this way that he found out that in many <lb/>
districts of the vast Pacific coast, so strong is the <lb/>
wild, free love of justice in the hearts of the people, <lb/>
that whenever any secret and mysterious crime is <lb/>
committed, they say, "Let justice be done, though <lb/>
the heavens fall," and go straightway and swing a <lb/>
Chinaman.</p>
<p>It was in this way that he found out that by <lb/>
studying one half of each day's "local items," it <lb/>
would appear that the police of San Francisco were <lb/>
<pb n="145"/>
either asleep or dead, and by studying the other <lb/>
half it would seem that the reporters were gone <lb/>
mad with admiration of the energy, the virtue, the <lb/>
high effectiveness, and the dare-devil intrepidity of <lb/>
that very police&#x2014;making exultant mention of how <lb/>
"the Argus-eyed officer So-and-so," captured a <lb/>
wretched knave of a Chinaman who was stealing <lb/>
chickens, and brought him gloriously to the city <lb/>
prison; and how "the gallant officer Such-and-such- <lb/>
a-one," quietly kept an eye on the movements of <lb/>
an "unsuspecting, almond-eyed son of Confucius" <lb/>
(your reporter is nothing if not facetious), following <lb/>
him around with that far-off look of vacancy and <lb/>
unconsciousness always so finely affected by that in- <lb/>
scrutable being, the forty-dollar policeman, during <lb/>
a waking interval, and captured him at last in the <lb/>
very act of placing his hands in a suspicious manner <lb/>
upon a paper of tacks, left by the owner in an ex- <lb/>
posed situation; and how one officer performed this <lb/>
prodigious thing, and another officer that, and an- <lb/>
other the other&#x2014;and pretty much every one of <lb/>
these performances having for a dazzling central <lb/>
incident a Chinaman guilty of a shilling's worth of <lb/>
crime, an unfortunate, whose misdemeanor must be <lb/>
hurrahed into something enormous in order to keep <lb/>
the public from noticing how many really important <lb/>
rascals went uncaptured in the meantime, and how <lb/>
overrated those glorified policemen actually are.</p>
<p>It was in this way that the boy found out that the <lb/>
legislature, being aware that the Constitution has <lb/>
<pb n="146"/>
made America an asylum for the poor and the op- <lb/>
pressed of all nations, and that, therefore, the poor <lb/>
and oppressed who fly to our shelter must not be <lb/>
charged a disabling admission fee, made a law that <lb/>
every Chinaman, upon landing, must be <i>vaccinated</i> <lb/>
upon the wharf, and pay to the State's appointed <lb/>
officer <i>ten dollars</i> for the service, when there are <lb/>
plenty of doctors in San Francisco who would be <lb/>
glad enough to do it for him for fifty cents.</p>
<p>It was in this way that the boy found out that a <lb/>
Chinaman had no rights that any man was bound to <lb/>
respect; that he had no sorrows that any man was <lb/>
bound to pity; that neither his life nor his liberty <lb/>
was worth the purchase of a penny when a white <lb/>
man needed a scapegoat; that nobody loved China- <lb/>
men, nobody befriended them, nobody spared them <lb/>
suffering when it was convenient to inflict it; every- <lb/>
body, individuals, communities, the majesty of the <lb/>
State itself, joined in hating, abusing, and perse- <lb/>
cuting these humble strangers.</p>
<p>And, therefore, what <i>could</i> have been more natural <lb/>
than for this sunny-hearted boy, tripping along to <lb/>
Sunday-school, with his mind teeming with freshly- <lb/>
learned incentives to high and virtuous action, to <lb/>
say to himself:</p>
<p>"Ah, there goes a Chinaman! God will not love <lb/>
me if I do not stone him."</p>
<p>And for this he was arrested and put in the city <lb/>
jail.</p>
<p>Everything conspired to teach him that it was a <lb/>
<pb n="147"/>
high and holy thing to stone a Chinaman, and yet <lb/>
he no sooner attempts to do his duty that he is <lb/>
punished for it&#x2014;he, poor chap, who has been <lb/>
aware all his life that one of the principal recreations <lb/>
of the police, out toward the Gold Refinery, is to <lb/>
look on with tranquil enjoyment while the butchers <lb/>
of Brannan street set their dogs on unoffending <lb/>
Chinamen, and make them flee for their lives.<ref target="n20">*</ref><note id="n20" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>I have many such memories in my mind, but am thinking just at <lb/>
present of one particular one, where the Brannan Street butchers set <lb/>
their dogs on a Chinaman who was quietly passing with a basket of <lb/>
clothes on his head; and while the dogs mutilated his flesh, a butcher <lb/>
increased the hilarity of the occasion by knocking some of the China- <lb/>
man's teeth down his throat with half a brick. This incident sticks in <lb/>
my memory with a more malevolent tenacity, perhaps, on account of the <lb/>
fact that I was in the employ of a San Francisco journal at the time, and <lb/>
was not allowed to publish it because it might offend some of the peculiar <lb/>
element that subscribed for the paper.</p></note></p>
<p>Keeping in mind the tuition in the humanities <lb/>
which the entire "Pacific coast" gives its youth, <lb/>
there is a very sublimity of incongruity in the virtu- <lb/>
ous flourish with which the good city fathers of San <lb/>
Francisco proclaim (as they have lately done) that <lb/>
"The police are positively ordered to arrest all <lb/>
boys, of every description and wherever found, who <lb/>
engage in assaulting Chinamen."</p>
<p>Still, let us be truly glad they have made the <lb/>
order, notwithstanding its inconsistency; and let us <lb/>
rest perfectly confident the police are glad, too. <lb/>
Because there is no personal peril in arresting boys, <lb/>
provided they be of the small kind, and the reporters <lb/>
<pb n="148"/>
will have to laud their performances just as loyally <lb/>
as ever, or go without items.</p>
<p>The new form for local items in San Francisco <lb/>
will now be: "The ever vigilant and efficient officer <lb/>
So-and-so succeeded, yesterday afternoon, in arrest- <lb/>
ing Master Tommy Jones, after a determined re- <lb/>
sistance," etc., etc., followed by the customary <lb/>
statistics and final hurrah, with its unconscious sar- <lb/>
casm: "We are happy in being able to state that <lb/>
this is the forty-seventh boy arrested by this gallant <lb/>
officer since the new ordinance went into effect. <lb/>
The most extraordinary activity prevails in the <lb/>
police department. Nothing like it has been seen <lb/>
since we can remember."</p>

<head><b>THE JUDGE'S "SPIRITED WOMAN"</b></head>
<p>"<smcap>I was</smcap> sitting here," said the judge, "in this <lb/>
old pulpit, holding court, and we were trying <lb/>
a big, wicked-looking Spanish desperado for killing <lb/>
the husband of a bright, pretty Mexican woman. <lb/>
It was a lazy summer day, and an awfully long one, <lb/>
and the witnesses were tedious. None of us took <lb/>
any interest in the trial except that nervous, uneasy <lb/>
devil of a Mexican woman&#x2014;because you know <lb/>
how they love and how they hate, and this one had <lb/>
loved her husband with all her might, and now she <lb/>
had boiled it all down into hate, and stood here <lb/>
spitting it at that Spaniard with her eyes; and I tell <lb/>
you she would stir <i>me</i> up, too, with a little of her <lb/>
summer lightning, occasionally. Well, I had my <lb/>
coat off and my heels up, lolling and sweating, and <lb/>
smoking one of those cabbage cigars the San Fran- <lb/>
cisco people used to think were good enough for us <lb/>
in those times; and the lawyers they all had their <lb/>
coats off, and were smoking and whittling, and the <lb/>
witnesses the same, and so was the prisoner. Well, <lb/>
the fact is, there warn't any interest in a murder <lb/>
trial then, because the fellow was always brought in <lb/>
'not guilty,' the jury expecting him to do as much <lb/>
<pb n="150"/>
for them some time; and, although the evidence <lb/>
was straight and square against this Spaniard, we <lb/>
knew we could not convict him without seeming to <lb/>
be rather high-handed and sort of reflecting on every <lb/>
gentleman in the community; for there warn't any <lb/>
carriages and liveries then, and so the only 'style' <lb/>
there was, was to keep your private graveyard. <lb/>
But that woman seemed to have her heart set on <lb/>
hanging that Spaniard; and you'd ought to have <lb/>
seen how she would glare on him a minute, and <lb/>
then look up at me in her pleading way, and then <lb/>
turn and for the next five minutes search the jury's <lb/>
faces, and by and by drop her face in her hands for <lb/>
just a little while as if she was most ready to give <lb/>
up; but out she'd come again directly, and be as <lb/>
live and anxious as ever. But when the jury an- <lb/>
nounced the verdict&#x2014;Not Guilty, and I told the <lb/>
prisoner he was acquitted and free to go, that <lb/>
woman rose up till she appeared to be as tall and <lb/>
grand as a seventy-four-gun-ship, and says she:</p>
<p>"'Judge, do I understand you to say that this <lb/>
man is not guilty that murdered my husband without <lb/>
any cause before my own eyes and my little chil- <lb/>
dren's, and that all has been done to him that ever <lb/>
justice and the law can do?'</p>
<p>"'The same,' says I.</p>
<p>"And then what do you reckon she did? Why, <lb/>
she turned on that smirking Spanish fool like a wild <lb/>
cat, and out with a 'navy' and shot him dead in <lb/>
open court!"</p>
<pb n="151"/>
<p>"That <i>was</i> spirited, I am willing to admit."</p>
<p>"Wasn't it, though?" said the judge admiringly.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't have missed it for anything. I ad- <lb/>
journed court right on the spot, and we put on our <lb/>
coats and went out and took up a collection for her <lb/>
and her cubs, and sent them over the mountains to <lb/>
their friends. Ah, she was a spirited wench!"</p>

</opener>
<p>"<smcap>Could</smcap> you give me any information respecting <lb/>
such islands, if any, as the Government <lb/>
is going to purchase?"</p>
<p>It is an uncle of mine that wants to know. He is <lb/>
an industrious man and well-disposed, and wants to <lb/>
make a living in an honest, humble way, but more <lb/>
especially he wants to be quiet. He wishes to settle <lb/>
down, and be quiet and unostentatious. He has <lb/>
been to the new island St. Thomas, but he says he <lb/>
thinks things are unsettled there. He went there <lb/>
early with an <foreign lang="fre"><i>attach&#x00E9;</i></foreign> of the State department, who <lb/>
was sent down with money to pay for the island. <lb/>
My uncle had his money in the same box, and so <lb/>
when they went ashore, getting a receipt, the sailors <lb/>
broke open the box and took all the money, not <lb/>
making any distinction between Government money, <lb/>
which was legitimate money to be stolen, and my <lb/>
uncle's, which was his own private property, and <lb/>
should have been respected. But he came home <lb/>
and got some more and went back. And then he <lb/>
took the fever. There are seven kinds of fever <lb/>
<pb n="153"/>
down there, you know; and, as his blood was out <lb/>
of order by reason of loss of sleep and general wear <lb/>
and tear of mind, he failed to cure the first fever, <lb/>
and then somehow he got the other six. He is not <lb/>
a kind of man that enjoys fevers, though he is well <lb/>
meaning and always does what he thinks is right, <lb/>
and so he was a good deal annoyed when it ap- <lb/>
peared he was going to die.</p>
<p>But he worried through, and got well and started <lb/>
a farm. He fenced it in, and the next day that <lb/>
great storm came on and washed the most of it over <lb/>
to Gibraltar, or around there somewhere. He only <lb/>
said, in his patient way, that it was gone, and he <lb/>
wouldn't bother about trying to find out where it <lb/>
went to, though it was his opinion it went to <lb/>
Gibraltar.</p>
<p>Then he invested in a mountain, and started a <lb/>
farm up there, so as to be out of the way when the <lb/>
sea came ashore again. It was a good mountain, <lb/>
and a good farm, but it wasn't any use; an earth- <lb/>
quake came the next night and shook it all down. <lb/>
It was all fragments, you know, and so mixed up <lb/>
with another man's property that he could not tell <lb/>
which were his fragments without going to law; and <lb/>
he would not do that, because his main object in <lb/>
going to St. Thomas was to be quiet. All that he <lb/>
wanted was to settle down and be quiet.</p>
<p>He thought it all over, and finally he concluded <lb/>
to try the low ground again, especially as he wanted <lb/>
to start a brickyard this time. He bought a flat, <lb/>
<pb n="154"/>
and put out a hundred thousand bricks to dry <lb/>
preparatory to baking them. But luck appeared <lb/>
to be against him. A volcano shoved itself through <lb/>
there that night, and elevated his brickyard about <lb/>
two thousand feet in the air. It irritated him a <lb/>
good deal. He has been up there, and he says the <lb/>
bricks are all baked right enough, but he can't get <lb/>
them down. At first, he thought maybe the Gov- <lb/>
ernment would get the bricks down for him, because <lb/>
since Government bought the island, it ought to <lb/>
protect the property where a man has invested in <lb/>
good faith; but all he wants is quiet, and so he is <lb/>
not going to apply for the subsidy he was thinking <lb/>
about.</p>
<p>He went back there last week in a couple of ships <lb/>
of war, to prospect around the coast for a safe place <lb/>
for a farm where he could be quiet; but a great <lb/>
"tidal wave" came, and hoisted both of the ships <lb/>
out into one of the interior counties, and he came <lb/>
near losing his life. So he has given up prospecting <lb/>
in a ship, and is discouraged.</p>
<p>Well, now he don't know what to do. He has <lb/>
tried Alaska; but the bears kept after him so much, <lb/>
and kept him so much on the jump, as it were, that <lb/>
he had to leave the country. He could not be quiet <lb/>
there with those bears prancing after him all the <lb/>
time. That is how he came to go to the new island <lb/>
we have bought&#x2014;St. Thomas. But he is getting <lb/>
to think St. Thomas is not quiet enough for a man <lb/>
of his turn of mind, and that is why he wishes me to<lb/>
<pb n="155"/>
find out if Government is likely to buy some more <lb/>
islands shortly. He has heard that Government is <lb/>
thinking about buying Porto Rico. If that is true, <lb/>
he wishes to try Porto Rico, if it is a quiet place. <lb/>
How is Porto Rico for his style of man? Do you <lb/>
think the Government will but it?</p>

<head><smcap>how the animals of the wood sent out a scientific <lb/>
expedition</smcap>.</head>
<p><smcap>Once</smcap> the creatures of the forest held a great con- <lb/>
vention and appointed a commission consisting <lb/>
of the most illustrious scientists among them to go <lb/>
forth, clear beyond the forest and out into the un- <lb/>
known and unexplored world, to verify the truth of <lb/>
the matters already taught in their schools and col- <lb/>
leges and also to make discoveries. It was the most <lb/>
imposing enterprise of the kind the nation had ever <lb/>
embarked in. True, the government had once sent <lb/>
Dr. Bull Frog, with a picked crew, to hunt for a <lb/>
northwesterly passage through the swamp to the <lb/>
right-hand corner of the wood, and had since sent <lb/>
out many expeditions to hunt for Dr. Bull Frog; <lb/>
but they never could find him, and so government <lb/>
finally gave him up and ennobled his mother to <lb/>
<pb n="157"/>
show its gratitude for the services her son had <lb/>
rendered to science. And once government sent <lb/>
Sir Grass Hopper to hunt for the sources of the rill <lb/>
that emptied into the swamp; and afterwards sent <lb/>
out many expeditions to hunt for Sir Grass, and at <lb/>
last they were successful&#x2014;they found his body, but <lb/>
if he had discovered the sources meantime, he did <lb/>
not let on. So government acted handsomely by <lb/>
deceased, and many envied his funeral.</p>
<p>But these expeditions were trifles compared with <lb/>
the present one; for this one comprised among its <lb/>
servants the very greatest among the learned; and <lb/>
besides it was to go to the utterly unvisited regions <lb/>
believed to lie beyond the mighty forest&#x2014;as we <lb/>
have remarked before. How the members were <lb/>
banqueted, and glorified, and talked about! Every- <lb/>
where that one of them showed himself, straightway <lb/>
there was a crowd to gape and stare at him.</p>
<p>Finally they set off, and it was a sight to see the <lb/>
long procession of dry-land Tortoises heavily laden <lb/>
with savans, scientific instruments, Glow-Worms and <lb/>
Fire-Flies for signal service, provisions, Ants, and <lb/>
Tumble-Bugs to fetch and carry and delve, Spiders <lb/>
to carry the surveying chain and do other engineer- <lb/>
ing duty, and so forth and so on; and after the <lb/>
Tortoises came another long train of ironclads&#x2014; <lb/>
stately and spacious Mud Turtles for marine trans- <lb/>
portation service; and from every Tortoise and <lb/>
every Turtle flaunted a flaming gladiolus or other <lb/>
splendid banner; at the head of the column a great <lb/>
<pb n="158"/>
band of Bumble-Bees, Mosquitoes, Katy-Dids, and <lb/>
Crickets discoursed martial music; and the entire <lb/>
train was under the escort and protection of twelve <lb/>
picked regiments of the Army Worm.</p>
<p>At the end of three weeks the expedition emerged <lb/>
from the forest and looked upon the great Unknown <lb/>
World. Their eyes were greeted with an impressive <lb/>
spectacle. A vast level plain stretched before them, <lb/>
watered by a sinuous stream; and beyond there <lb/>
towered up against the sky a long and lofty barrier <lb/>
of some kind, they did not know what. The <lb/>
Tumble-Bug said he believed it was simply land <lb/>
tilted up on its edge, because he knew he could see <lb/>
trees on it. But Professor Snail and the others <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"You are hired to dig, sir&#x2014;that is all. We <lb/>
need your muscle, not your brains. When we want <lb/>
your opinion on scientific matters, we will hasten to <lb/>
let you know. Your coolness is intolerable, too&#x2014; <lb/>
loafing about here meddling with august matters of <lb/>
learning, when the other laborers are pitching camp. <lb/>
Go along and help handle the baggage."</p>
<p>The Tumble-Bug turned on his heel uncrushed, <lb/>
unabashed, observing to himself, "If it isn't land <lb/>
tilted up, let me die the death of the unrighteous."</p>
<p>Professor Bull Frog (nephew of the late explorer) <lb/>
said he believed the ridge was the wall that enclosed <lb/>
the earth. He continued:</p>
<p>"Our fathers have left us much learning, but they <lb/>
had not traveled far, and so we may count this a <lb/>
<pb n="159"/>
noble new discovery. We are safe for renown now, <lb/>
even though our labors began and ended with this <lb/>
single achievement. I wonder what this wall is built <lb/>
of? Can it be fungus? Fungus is an honorable <lb/>
good thing to build a wall of."</p>
<p>Professor Snail adjusted his field-glass and ex- <lb/>
amined the rampart critically. Finally he said:</p>
<p>"The fact that it is not diaphanous convinces <lb/>
me that it is a dense vapor formed by the calorifica- <lb/>
tion of ascending moisture dephlogisticated by re- <lb/>
fraction. A few endiometrical experiments would <lb/>
confirm this, but it is not necessary. The thing is <lb/>
obvious."</p>
<p>So he shut up his glass and went into his shell to <lb/>
make a note of the discovery of the world's end, <lb/>
and the nature of it.</p>
<p>"Profound mind!" said Professor Angle-Worm <lb/>
to Professor Field-Mouse; "profound mind! noth- <lb/>
ing can long remain a mystery to that august <lb/>
brain."</p>
<p>Night drew on apace, the sentinel crickets were <lb/>
posted, the Glow Worm and Fire-Fly lamps were <lb/>
lighted, and the camp sank to silence and sleep. <lb/>
After breakfast in the morning, the expedition <lb/>
moved on. About noon a great avenue was reached, <lb/>
which had in it two endless parallel bars of some <lb/>
kind of hard black substance, raised the height of <lb/>
the tallest Bull Frog above the general level. The <lb/>
scientists climbed up on these and examined and <lb/>
tested them in various ways. They walked along <lb/>
<pb n="160"/>
them for a great distance, but found no end and no <lb/>
break in them. They could arrive at no decision. <lb/>
There was nothing in the records of science that <lb/>
mentioned anything of this kind. But at last the <lb/>
bald and venerable geographer, Professor Mud <lb/>
Turtle, a person who, born poor, and of a drudg- <lb/>
ing low family, had, by his own native force raised <lb/>
himself to the headship of the geographers of his <lb/>
generation, said:</p>
<p>"My friends, we have indeed made a discovery <lb/>
here. We have found in a palpable, compact, and <lb/>
imperishable state what the wisest of our fathers <lb/>
always regarded as a mere thing of the imagination. <lb/>
Humble yourselves, my friends, for we stand in a <lb/>
majestic presence. These are parallels of latitude!"</p>
<p>Every heart and every head was bowed, so awful, <lb/>
so sublime was the magnitude of the discovery. <lb/>
Many shed tears.</p>
<p>The camp was pitched and the rest of the day <lb/>
given up to writing voluminous accounts of the <lb/>
marvel, and correcting astronomical tables to fit it. <lb/>
Toward midnight a demoniacal shriek was heard, <lb/>
then a clattering and rumbling noise, and the next <lb/>
instant a vast terrific eye shot by, with a long tail <lb/>
attached, and disappeared in the gloom, still uttering <lb/>
triumphant shrieks.</p>
<p>The poor camp laborers were stricken to the heart <lb/>
with fright, and stampeded for the high grass in a <lb/>
body. But not the scientists. They had no super- <lb/>
stitions. They calmly proceeded to exchange theo- <lb/>
<pb n="161"/>
ries. The ancient geographer's opinion was asked. <lb/>
He went into his shell and deliberated long and <lb/>
profoundly. When he came out at last, they all <lb/>
knew by his worshiping countenance that he brought <lb/>
light. Said he:</p>
<p>"Give thanks for this stupendous thing which we <lb/>
have been permitted to witness. It is the Vernal <lb/>
Equinox!"</p>
<p>There were shoutings and great rejoicings.</p>
<p>"But," said the Angle-Worm, uncoiling after <lb/>
reflection, "this is dead summer time."</p>
<p>"Very well," said the Turtle, "we are far from <lb/>
our region; the season differs with the difference of <lb/>
time between the two points."</p>
<p>"Ah, true. True enough. But it is night. How <lb/>
should the sun pass in the night?"</p>
<p>"In these distant regions he doubtless passes <lb/>
always in the night at this hour."</p>
<p>"Yes, doubtless that is true. But it being night, <lb/>
how is it that we could see him?"</p>
<p>"It is a great mystery. I grant that. But I am <lb/>
persuaded that the humidity of the atmosphere in <lb/>
these remote regions is such that particles of day- <lb/>
light adhere to the disk and it was by aid of these <lb/>
that we were enabled to see the sun in the dark."</p>
<p>This was deemed satisfactory, and due entry was <lb/>
made of the decision.</p>
<p>But about this moment those dreadful shriekings <lb/>
were heard again; again the rumbling and thunder- <lb/>
ing came speeding up out of the night; and once <lb/>
<pb n="162"/>
more a flaming great eye flashed by and lost itself in <lb/>
gloom and distance.</p>
<p>The camp laborers gave themselves up for lost. <lb/>
The savants were sorely perplexed. Here was a <lb/>
marvel hard to account for. They thought and they <lb/>
talked, they talked and they thought. Finally the <lb/>
learned and aged Lord Grand-Daddy-Longlegs, who <lb/>
had been sitting in deep study, with his slender <lb/>
limbs crossed and his stemmy arms folded, said:</p>
<p>"Deliver your opinions, brethren, and then I will <lb/>
tell my thought&#x2014;for I think I have solved this <lb/>
problem."</p>
<p>"So be it, good your lordship," piped the weak <lb/>
treble of the wrinkled and withered Professor Wood- <lb/>
louse, "for we shall hear from your lordship's lips <lb/>
naught but wisdom." [Here the speaker threw in <lb/>
a mess of trite, threadbare, exasperating quotations <lb/>
from the ancient poets and philosophers, delivering <lb/>
them with unction in the sounding grandeurs of the <lb/>
original tongues, they being from the Mastodon, the <lb/>
Dodo, and other dead languages.] "Perhaps I <lb/>
ought not to presume to meddle with matters per- <lb/>
taining to astronomy at all, in such a presence as <lb/>
this, I who have made it the business of my life to <lb/>
delve only among the riches of the extinct languages <lb/>
and unearth the opulence of their ancient lore; but <lb/>
still, as unacquainted as I am with the noble science <lb/>
of astronomy, I beg with deference and humility to <lb/>
suggest that inasmuch as the last of these wonderful <lb/>
apparitions proceeded in exactly the opposite direc- <lb/>
<pb n="163"/>
tion from that pursued by the first, which you decide <lb/>
to be the Vernal Equinox, and greatly resembled it <lb/>
in all particulars, is it not possible, nay certain, that <lb/>
this last is the <i>Autumnal</i> Equi&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"O-o-o!" "O-o-o! go to bed! go to bed!" <lb/>
with annoyed derision from everybody. So the <lb/>
poor old Woodlouse retreated out of sight, con- <lb/>
sumed with shame.</p>
<p>Further discussion followed, and then the united <lb/>
voice of the commission begged Lord Longlegs to <lb/>
speak. He said:</p>
<p>"Fellow-scientists, it is my belief that we have <lb/>
witnessed a thing which has occurred in perfection <lb/>
but once before in the knowledge of created beings. <lb/>
It is a phenomenon of inconceivable importance and <lb/>
interest, view it as one may, but its interest to us is <lb/>
vastly heightened by an added knowledge of its nature <lb/>
which no scholar has heretofore possessed or even <lb/>
suspected. This great marvel which we have just <lb/>
witnessed, fellow-savants (it almost takes my breath <lb/>
away), is nothing less than the transit of Venus!"</p>
<p>Every scholar sprang to his feet pale with astonish- <lb/>
ment. Then ensued tears, handshakings, frenzied <lb/>
embraces, and the most extravagant jubilations of <lb/>
every sort. But by and by, as emotion began to <lb/>
retire within bounds, and reflection to return to the <lb/>
front, the accomplished Chief Inspector Lizard <lb/>
observed:</p>
<p>"But how is this? Venus should traverse the <lb/>
sun's surface, not the earth's."</p>
<pb n="164"/>
<p>The arrow went home. It carried sorrow to the <lb/>
breast of every apostle of learning there, for none <lb/>
could deny that this was a formidable criticism. But <lb/>
tranquilly the venerable Duke crossed his limbs be- <lb/>
hind his ears and said:</p>
<p>"My friend has touched the marrow of our <lb/>
mighty discovery. Yes&#x2014;all that have lived before <lb/>
us thought a transit of Venus consisted of a flight <lb/>
across the sun's face; they thought it, they main- <lb/>
tained it, they honestly believed it, simple hearts, <lb/>
and were justified in it by the limitations of their <lb/>
knowledge; but to us has been granted the inestima- <lb/>
ble boon of proving that the transit occurs across the <lb/>
earth's face, <i>for we have</i> <smcap>seen</smcap> <i>it!</i>"</p>
<p>The assembled wisdom sat in speechless adoration <lb/>
of this imperial intellect. All doubts had instantly <lb/>
departed, like night before the lightning.</p>
<p>The Tumble-Bug had just intruded, unnoticed. <lb/>
He now came reeling forward among the scholars, <lb/>
familiarly slapping first one and then another on the <lb/>
shoulder, saying "Nice ('ic!) nice old boy!" and <lb/>
smiling a smile of elaborate content. Arrived at a <lb/>
good position for speaking, he put his left arm <lb/>
akimbo with his knuckles planted in his hip just <lb/>
under the edge of his cut-away coat, bent his right <lb/>
leg, placing his toe on the ground and resting his <lb/>
heel with easy grace against his left shin, puffed out <lb/>
his aldermanic stomach, opened his lips, leaned his <lb/>
right elbow on Inspector Lizard's shoulder, and&#x2014;</p>
<p>But the shoulder was indignantly withdrawn and <lb/>
<pb n="165"/>
the hard-handed son of toil went to earth. He <lb/>
floundered a bit but came up smiling, arranged his <lb/>
attitude with the same careful detail as before, only <lb/>
choosing Professor Dogtick's shoulder for a support, <lb/>
opened his lips and&#x2014;</p>
<p>Went to earth again. He presently scrambled up <lb/>
once more, still smiling, made a loose effort to brush <lb/>
the dust off his coat and legs, but a smart pass of <lb/>
his hand missed entirely, and the force of the un- <lb/>
checked impulse slewed him suddenly around, <lb/>
twisted his legs together, and projected him, limber <lb/>
and sprawling, into the lap of the Lord Longlegs. <lb/>
Two or three scholars sprang forward, flung the low <lb/>
creature head over heels into a corner and reinstated <lb/>
the patrician, smoothing his ruffled dignity with <lb/>
many soothing and regretful speeches. Professor <lb/>
Bull Frog roared out:</p>
<p>"No more of this, sirrah Tumble-Bug! Say your <lb/>
say and then get you about your business with <lb/>
speed! Quick&#x2014;what is your errand? Come&#x2014; <lb/>
move off a trifle; you smell like a stable; what have <lb/>
you been at?"</p>
<p>"Please ('ic!) please your worship I chanced to <lb/>
light upon a find. But no m (<i>e-uck!</i>) matter 'bout <lb/>
that. There's b ('ic!) been another find which&#x2014; <lb/>
&#x2014;beg pardon, your honors, what was that th ('ic!) <lb/>
thing that ripped by here first?"</p>
<p>"It was the Vernal Equinox."</p>
<p>"Inf ('ic!) fernal equinox. 'At's all right. D <lb/>
('ic!) Dunno <i>him</i>. What's other one?"</p>
<pb n="166"/>
<p>"The transit of Venus."</p>
<p>"G ('ic!) Got me again. No matter. Las' one <lb/>
dropped something."</p>
<p>"Ah, indeed! Good luck! Good news! Quick <lb/>
&#x2014;what is it?"</p>
<p>"M ('ic!) Mosey out 'n' see. It'll pay."</p>
<p>No more votes were taken for four and twenty <lb/>
hours. Then the following entry was made:</p>
<p>"The commission went in a body to view the <lb/>
find. It was found to consist of a hard, smooth, <lb/>
huge object with a rounded summit surmounted by <lb/>
a short upright projection resembling a section of a <lb/>
cabbage stalk divided transversely. This projection <lb/>
was not solid, but was a hollow cylinder plugged <lb/>
with a soft woody substance unknown to our region <lb/>
&#x2014;that is, it had been so plugged, but unfortunately <lb/>
this obstruction had been heedlessly removed by <lb/>
Norway Rat, Chief of the Sappers and Miners, be- <lb/>
fore our arrival. The vast object before us, so <lb/>
mysteriously conveyed from the glittering domains <lb/>
of space, was found to be hollow and nearly filled <lb/>
with a pungent liquid of a brownish hue, like rain- <lb/>
water that has stood for some time. And such a <lb/>
spectacle as met our view! Norway Rat was <lb/>
perched upon the summit engaged in thrusting his <lb/>
tail into the cylindrical projection, drawing it out <lb/>
dripping, permitting the struggling multitude of <lb/>
laborers to suck the end of it, then straightway rein- <lb/>
serting it and delivering the fluid to the mob as <lb/>
before. Evidently this liquor had strangely potent <lb/>
<pb n="167"/>
qualities; for all that partook of it were immediately <lb/>
exalted with great and pleasurable emotions, and <lb/>
went staggering about singing ribald songs, em- <lb/>
bracing, fighting, dancing, discharging irruptions of <lb/>
profanity, and defying all authority. Around us <lb/>
struggled a massed and uncontrolled mob&#x2014;uncon- <lb/>
trolled and likewise uncontrollable, for the whole <lb/>
army, down to the very sentinels, were mad like <lb/>
the rest, by reason of the drink. We were seized <lb/>
upon by these reckless creatures, and within the <lb/>
hour we, even we, were undistinguishable from the <lb/>
rest&#x2014;the demoralization was complete and uni- <lb/>
versal. In time the camp wore itself out with its <lb/>
orgies and sank into a stolid and pitiable stupor, in <lb/>
whose mysterious bonds rank was forgotten and <lb/>
strange bedfellows made, our eyes, at the resurrec- <lb/>
tion, being blasted and our souls petrified with the <lb/>
incredible spectacle of that intolerable stinking <lb/>
scavenger, the Tumble-Bug, and the illustrious <lb/>
patrician my Lord Grand Daddy, Duke of Long- <lb/>
legs, lying soundly steeped in sleep, and clasped <lb/>
lovingly in each other's arms, the like whereof hath <lb/>
not been seen in all the ages that tradition com- <lb/>
passeth, and doubtless none shall ever in this world <lb/>
find faith to master the belief of it save only we that <lb/>
have beheld the damnable and unholy vision. Thus <lb/>
inscrutable be the ways of God, whose will be done!</p>
<p>"This day, by order, did the engineer-in-chief, <lb/>
Herr Spider, rig the necessary tackle for the over- <lb/>
turning of the vast reservoir, and so its calamitous <lb/>
<pb n="168"/>
contents were discharged in a torrent upon the <lb/>
thirsty earth, which drank it up, and now there is no <lb/>
more danger, we reserving but a few drops for ex- <lb/>
periment and scrutiny, and to exhibit to the king <lb/>
and subsequently preserve among the wonders of <lb/>
the museum. What this liquid is has been deter- <lb/>
mined. It is without question that fierce and most <lb/>
destructive fluid called lightning. It was wrested, in <lb/>
its container, from its storehouse in the clouds, by <lb/>
the resistless might of the flying planet, and hurled <lb/>
at our feet as she sped by. An interesting discovery <lb/>
here results. Which is, that lightning, kept to itself, <lb/>
is quiescent; it is the assaulting contact of the <lb/>
thunderbolt that releases it from captivity, ignites its <lb/>
awful fires and so produces an instantaneous com- <lb/>
bustion and explosion which spread disaster and <lb/>
desolation far and wide in the earth."</p>
<p>After another day devoted to rest and recovery, <lb/>
the expedition proceeded upon its way. Some days <lb/>
later it went into camp in a pleasant part of the <lb/>
plain, and the savants sallied forth to see what they <lb/>
might find. Their reward was at hand. Professor <lb/>
Bull Frog discovered a strange tree, and called his <lb/>
comrades. They inspected it with profound interest. <lb/>
It was very tall and straight, and wholly devoid of <lb/>
bark, limbs, or foliage. By triangulation Lord Long- <lb/>
legs determined its altitude; Herr Spider measured <lb/>
its circumference at the base and computed the <lb/>
circumference at its top by a mathematical demon- <lb/>
stration based upon the warrant furnished by the <lb/>
<pb n="169"/>
uniform degree of its taper upward. It was con- <lb/>
sidered a very extraordinary find; and since it was <lb/>
a tree of a hitherto unknown species, Professor <lb/>
Woodlouse gave it a name of a learned sound, <lb/>
being none other than that of Professor Bull Frog <lb/>
translated into the ancient Mastodon language, for <lb/>
it had always been the custom with discoverers <lb/>
to perpetuate their names and honor themselves by <lb/>
this sort of connection with their discoveries.</p>
<p>Now Professor Field-Mouse having placed his <lb/>
sensitive ear to the tree, detected a rich, harmonious <lb/>
sound issuing from it. This surprising thing was <lb/>
tested and enjoyed by each scholar in turn and <lb/>
great was the gladness and astonishment of all. <lb/>
Professor Woodlouse was requested to add to and <lb/>
extend the tree's name so as to make it suggest the <lb/>
musical quality it possessed&#x2014;which he did, furnish- <lb/>
ing the addition <i>Anthem Singer</i>, done into the Mas- <lb/>
todon tongue.</p>
<p>By this time Professor Snail was making some <lb/>
telescopic inspections. He discovered a great num- <lb/>
ber of these trees, extending in a single rank, with <lb/>
wide intervals between, as far as his instrument <lb/>
would carry, both southward and northward. He <lb/>
also presently discovered that all these trees were <lb/>
bound together, near their tops, by fourteen great <lb/>
ropes, one above another, which ropes were con- <lb/>
tinuous, from tree to tree, as far as his vision could <lb/>
reach. This was surprising. Chief Engineer Spider <lb/>
ran aloft and soon reported that these ropes were <lb/>
<pb n="170"/>
simply a web hung there by some colossal member <lb/>
of his own species, for he could see its prey dangling <lb/>
here and there from the strands, in the shape of <lb/>
mighty shreds and rags that had a woven look about <lb/>
their texture and were no doubt the discarded skins <lb/>
of prodigious insects which had been caught and <lb/>
eaten. And then he ran along one of the ropes to <lb/>
make a closer inspection, but felt a smart sudden <lb/>
burn on the soles of his feet, accompanied by a <lb/>
paralyzing shock, wherefore he let go and swung <lb/>
himself to the earth by a thread of his own spinning, <lb/>
and advised all to hurry at once to camp, lest the <lb/>
monster should appear and get as much interested <lb/>
in the savants as they were in him and his works. <lb/>
So they departed with speed, making notes about <lb/>
the gigantic web as they went. And that evening <lb/>
the naturalist of the expedition built a beautiful <lb/>
model of the colossal spider, having no need to see <lb/>
it in order to do this, because he had picked up a <lb/>
fragment of its vertebr&#x00E6; by the tree, and so knew <lb/>
exactly what the creature looked like and what its <lb/>
habits and its preferences were by this simple evi- <lb/>
dence alone. He built it with a tail, teeth, fourteen <lb/>
legs and a snout, and said it ate grass, cattle, pebbles, <lb/>
and dirt with equal enthusiasm. This animal was <lb/>
regarded as a very precious addition to science. It <lb/>
was hoped a dead one might be found to stuff. <lb/>
Professor Woodlouse thought that he and his <lb/>
brother scholars, by lying hid and being quiet, <lb/>
might maybe catch a live one. He was advised to <lb/>
<pb n="171"/>
try it. Which was all the attention that was paid to <lb/>
his suggestion. The conference ended with the <lb/>
naming the monster after the naturalist, since he, <lb/>
after God, had created it.</p>
<p>"And improved it, mayhap," muttered the <lb/>
Tumble-Bug, who was intruding again, according <lb/>
to his idle custom and his unappeasable curiosity.</p>

<p><smcap>A week</smcap> later the expedition camped in the <lb/>
midst of a collection of wonderful curiosities. <lb/>
These were a sort of vast caverns of stone that rose <lb/>
singly and in bunches out of the plain by the side <lb/>
of the river which they had first seen when they <lb/>
emerged from the forest. These caverns stood in <lb/>
long straight rows on opposite sides of broad aisles <lb/>
that were bordered with single ranks of trees. The <lb/>
summit of each cavern sloped sharply both ways. <lb/>
Several horizontal rows of great square holes, ob- <lb/>
structed by a thin, shiny, transparent substance, <lb/>
pierced the frontage of each cavern. Inside were <lb/>
caverns within caverns; and one might ascend and <lb/>
visit these minor compartments by means of curious <lb/>
winding ways consisting of continuous regular ter- <lb/>
races raised one above another. There were many <lb/>
huge shapeless objects in each compartment which <lb/>
<pb n="173"/>
were considered to have been living creatures at one <lb/>
time, though now the thin brown skin was shrunken <lb/>
and loose, and rattled when disturbed. Spiders <lb/>
were here in great number, and their cobwebs, <lb/>
stretched in all directions and wreathing the great <lb/>
skinny dead together, were a pleasant spectacle, <lb/>
since they inspired with life and wholesome cheer a <lb/>
scene which would otherwise have brought to the <lb/>
mind only a sense of forsakenness and desolation. <lb/>
Information was sought of these spiders, but in <lb/>
vain. They were of a different nationality from <lb/>
those with the expedition, and their language seemed <lb/>
but a musical, meaningless jargon. They were a <lb/>
timid, gentle race, but ignorant, and heathenish <lb/>
worshipers of unknown gods. The expedition de- <lb/>
tailed a great detachment of missionaries to teach <lb/>
them the true religion, and in a week's time a <lb/>
precious work had been wrought among those dark- <lb/>
ened creatures, not three families being by that time <lb/>
at peace with each other or having a settled belief in <lb/>
any system of religion whatever. This encouraged <lb/>
the expedition to establish a colony of missionaries <lb/>
there permanently, that the work of grace might <lb/>
go on.</p>
<p>But let us not outrun our narrative. After close <lb/>
examination of the fronts of the caverns, and much <lb/>
thinking and exchanging of theories, the scientists <lb/>
determined the nature of these singular formations. <lb/>
They said that each belonged mainly to the Old Red <lb/>
Sandstone period; that the cavern fronts rose in <lb/>
<pb n="174"/>
innumerable and wonderfully regular strata high in <lb/>
the air, each stratum about five frog-spans thick, <lb/>
and that in the present discovery lay an overpower- <lb/>
ing refutation of all received geology; for between <lb/>
every two layers of Old Red Sandstone reposed a <lb/>
thin layer of decomposed limestone; so instead of <lb/>
there having been but one Old Red Sandstone <lb/>
period there had certainly been not less than a <lb/>
hundred and seventy-five! And by the same token <lb/>
it was plain that there had also been a hundred and <lb/>
seventy-five floodings of the earth and depositings <lb/>
of limestone strata! The unavoidable deduction <lb/>
from which pair of facts was the overwhelming truth <lb/>
that the world, instead of being only two hundred <lb/>
thousand years old, was older by millions upon <lb/>
millions of years! And there was another curious <lb/>
thing: every stratum of Old Red Sandstone was <lb/>
pierced and divided at mathematically regular inter- <lb/>
vals by vertical strata of limestone. Up-shootings <lb/>
of igneous rock through fractures in water forma- <lb/>
tions were common; but here was the first instance <lb/>
where water-formed rock had been so projected. It <lb/>
was a great and noble discovery and its value to <lb/>
science was considered to be inestimable.</p>
<p>A critical examination of some of the lower strata <lb/>
demonstrated the presence of fossil ants and tumble- <lb/>
bugs (the latter accompanied by their peculiar <lb/>
goods), and with high gratification the fact was <lb/>
enrolled upon the scientific record; for this was <lb/>
proof that these vulgar laborers belonged to the <lb/>
<pb n="175"/>
first and lowest orders of created beings, though at <lb/>
the same time there was something repulsive in the <lb/>
reflection that the perfect and exquisite creature of <lb/>
the modern uppermost order owed its origin to such <lb/>
ignominious beings through the mysterious law of <lb/>
Development of Species.</p>
<p>The Tumble-Bug, overhearing this discussion, <lb/>
said he was willing that the parvenus of these new <lb/>
times should find what comfort they might in their <lb/>
wise-drawn theories, since as far as he was con- <lb/>
cerned he was content to be of the old first families <lb/>
and proud to point back to his place among the old <lb/>
original aristocracy of the land.</p>
<p>"Enjoy your mushroom dignity, stinking of the <lb/>
varnish of yesterday's veneering, since you like it," <lb/>
said he; "suffice it for the Tumble-Bugs that they <lb/>
come of a race that rolled their fragrant spheres <lb/>
down the solemn aisles of antiquity, and left their <lb/>
imperishable works embalmed in the Old Red Sand- <lb/>
stone to proclaim it to the wasting centuries as they <lb/>
file along the highway of Time!"</p>
<p>"Oh, take a walk!" said the chief of the expedi- <lb/>
tion, with derision.</p>
<p>The summer passed, and winter approached. In <lb/>
and about many of the caverns were what seemed to <lb/>
be inscriptions. Most of the scientists said they <lb/>
were inscriptions, a few said they were not. The <lb/>
chief philologist, Professor Woodlouse, maintained <lb/>
that they were writings, done in a character utterly <lb/>
unknown to scholars, and in a language equally un- <lb/>
<pb n="176"/>
known. He had early ordered his artists and <lb/>
draughtsmen to make facsimiles of all that were <lb/>
discovered; and had set himself about finding the <lb/>
key to the hidden tongue. In this work he had <lb/>
followed the method which had always been used by <lb/>
decipherers previously. That is to say, he placed a <lb/>
number of copies of inscriptions before him and <lb/>
studied them both collectively and in detail. To <lb/>
begin with, he placed the following copies together:</p>

<p>At first it seemed to the professor that this was a <lb/>
sign-language, and that each word was represented <lb/>
by a distinct sign; further examination convinced <lb/>
him that it was a written language, and that every <lb/>
letter of its alphabet was represented by a character <lb/>
of its own; and finally he decided that it was a <lb/>
language which conveyed itself partly by letters, <lb/>
and partly by signs or hieroglyphics. This conclu- <lb/>
sion was forced upon him by the discovery of several <lb/>
specimens of the following nature:</p>
<pb n="177"/>
<p>He observed that cer- <lb/>
tain inscriptions were <lb/>
met with in greater <lb/>
frequency than others. <lb/>
Such as "<smcap>For Sale <lb/>

"S. T.&#x2014;1860&#x2014;X;" <lb/>
"<smcap>Keno</smcap>;" "<smcap>Ale on <lb/>
Draught</smcap>." Naturally, <lb/>
then, these must be re- <lb/>
ligious maxims. But this <lb/>
idea was cast aside by <lb/>
and by, as the mystery <lb/>
of the strange alphabet <lb/>
began to clear itself. <lb/>
In time, the professor <lb/>
was enabled to translate <lb/>
several of the inscrip- <lb/>
tions with considerable <lb/>
plausibility, though not to <lb/>
the perfect satisfaction of <lb/>
all the scholars. Still, he <lb/>
made constant and en- <lb/>
couraging progress.</p>

<p>Professor Woodlouse affirmed that the word <lb/>
"Museum" was equivalent to the phrase "<i>lumgath <lb/>
molo</i>." or "Burial Place." Upon entering, the <lb/>
scientists were well astonished. But what they saw <lb/>
may be best conveyed in the language of their own <lb/>
official report:</p>
<p>"Erect, in a row, were a sort of rigid great figures <lb/>
which struck us instantly as belonging to the long <lb/>
extinct species of reptile called <smcap>Man</smcap>, described in <lb/>
our ancient records. This was a peculiarly gratify- <lb/>
ing discovery, because of late times it has become <lb/>
fashionable to regard this creature as a myth and a <lb/>
superstition, a work of the inventive imaginations of <lb/>
our remote ancestors. But here, indeed, was Man, <lb/>
perfectly preserved, in a fossil state. And this was <lb/>
his burial place, as already ascertained by the in- <lb/>
scription. And now it began to be suspected that <lb/>
the caverns we had been inspecting had been his <lb/>
ancient haunts in that old time that he roamed the <lb/>
earth&#x2014;for upon the breast of each of these tall <lb/>
fossils was an inscription in the character heretofore <lb/>
noticed. One read, '<smcap>Captain Kidd the Pirate</smcap>;' <lb/>
another, '<smcap>Queen Victoria</smcap>;' another, '<smcap>Abe Lin- <lb/>
coln</smcap>;' another, '<smcap>George Washington</smcap>,' etc.</p>
<p>"With feverish interest we called for our ancient <lb/>
scientific records to discover if perchance the de- <lb/>
scription of Man there set down would tally with the <lb/>
fossils before us. Professor Woodlouse read it <lb/>
aloud in its quaint and musty phraseology, to wit:</p>
<p>"'In y<sup>e</sup> time of our fathers Man still walked y<sup>e</sup> <lb/>
<pb n="179"/>
earth, as by tradition we know. It was a creature <lb/>
of exceeding great size, being compassed about with <lb/>
a loose skin, sometimes of one color, sometimes of <lb/>
many, the which it was able to cast at will; which <lb/>
being done, the hind legs were discovered to be <lb/>
armed with short claws like to a mole's but broader, <lb/>
and y<sup>e</sup> forelegs with fingers of a curious slimness <lb/>
and a length much more prodigious than a frog's, <lb/>
armed also with broad talons for scratching in y<sup>e</sup> <lb/>
earth for its food. It had a sort of feathers upon <lb/>
its head such as hath a rat, but longer, and a beak <lb/>
suitable for seeking its food by y<sup>e</sup> smell thereof. <lb/>
When it was stirred with happiness, it leaked water <lb/>
from its eyes; and when it suffered or was sad, it <lb/>
manifested it with a horrible hellish cackling clamor <lb/>
that was exceeding dreadful to hear and made one <lb/>
long that it might rend itself and perish, and so end <lb/>
its troubles. Two Mans being together, they uttered <lb/>
noises at each other like this: "Haw-haw-haw&#x2014; <lb/>
dam good, dam good," together with other sounds <lb/>
of more or less likeness to these, wherefore y<sup>e</sup> poets <lb/>
conceived that they talked, but poets be always <lb/>
ready to catch at any frantic folly, God he knows. <lb/>
Sometimes this creature goeth about with a long <lb/>
stick y<sup>e</sup> which it putteth to its face and bloweth fire <lb/>
and smoke through y<sup>e</sup> same with a sudden and most <lb/>
damnable bruit and noise that doth fright its prey to <lb/>
death, and so seizeth it in its talons and walketh <lb/>
away to its habitat, consumed with a most fierce and <lb/>
devilish joy.'</p>
<pb n="180"/>
<p>"Now was the description set forth by our ances- <lb/>
tors wonderfully endorsed and confirmed by the <lb/>
fossils before us, as shall be seen. The specimen <lb/>
marked 'Captain Kidd' was examined in detail. <lb/>
Upon its head and part of its face was a sort of fur <lb/>
like that upon the tail of a horse. With great labor <lb/>
its loose skin was removed, whereupon its body was <lb/>
discovered to be of a polished white texture, thor- <lb/>
oughly petrified. The straw it had eaten, so many <lb/>
ages gone by, was still in its body, undigested&#x2014; <lb/>
and even in its legs.</p>
<p>"Surrounding these fossils were objects that <lb/>
would mean nothing to the ignorant, but to the eye <lb/>
of science they were a revelation. They laid bare <lb/>
the secrets of dead ages. These musty Memorials <lb/>
told us when Man lived, and what were his habits. <lb/>
For here, side by side with Man, were the evidences <lb/>
that he had lived in the earliest ages of creation, the <lb/>
companion of the other low orders of life that be- <lb/>
longed to that forgotten time. Here was the fossil <lb/>
nautilus that sailed the primeval seas; here was the <lb/>
skeleton of the mastodon, the ichthyosaurus, the <lb/>
cave bear, the prodigious elk. Here, also, were the <lb/>
charred bones of some of these extinct animals and <lb/>
of the young of Man's own species, split length- <lb/>
wise, showing that to his taste the marrow was a <lb/>
toothsome luxury. It was plain that Man had <lb/>
robbed those bones of their contents, since no tooth- <lb/>
mark of any beast was upon them&#x2014;albeit the <lb/>
Tumble-Bug intruded the remark that 'no beast <lb/>
<pb n="181"/>
could mark a bone with its teeth, anyway.' Here <lb/>
were proofs that Man had vague, groveling notions <lb/>
of art; for this fact was conveyed by certain things <lb/>
marked with the untranslatable words, '<smcap>Flint <lb/>
Hatchets, Knives, Arrow-Heads, and Bone- <lb/>
Ornaments of Primeval Man</smcap>.' Some of these <lb/>
seemed to be rude weapons chipped out of flint, and <lb/>
in a secret place was found some more in process of <lb/>
construction, with this untranslatable legend, on a <lb/>
thin, flimsy material, lying by:</p>
<p>"<i>Jones, if you aon't want to be aischarged from <lb/>
the Musseum, make the next primeaveal weppons more <lb/>
careful&#x2014;you couldn't even fool one of these sleapy old <lb/>
syentiffic grannys from the Coledge with the last ones. <lb/>
And mind you the animles you carved on some of the <lb/>
Bone Ornaments is a blame sight too good for any <lb/>
primeaveal man that was ever fooled.&#x2014;Varnum, <lb/>
Manager</i>."</p>
<p>"Back of the burial place was a mass of ashes, <lb/>
showing that Man always had a feast at a funeral&#x2014; <lb/>
else why the ashes in such a place; and showing, <lb/>
also, that he believed in God and the immortality of <lb/>
the soul&#x2014;else why these solemn ceremonies?</p>
<p>"To sum up. We believe that Man had a written <lb/>
language. We <i>know</i> that he indeed existed at one <lb/>
time, and is not a myth; also, that he was the com- <lb/>
panion of the cave bear, the mastodon, and other <lb/>
extinct species; that he cooked and ate them and <lb/>
likewise the young of his own kind; also, that he <lb/>
bore rude weapons, and knew something of art; <lb/>
<pb n="182"/>
that he imagined he had a soul, and pleased himself <lb/>
with the fancy that it was immortal. But let us not <lb/>
laugh; there may be creatures in existence to whom <lb/>
we and our vanities and profundities may seem as <lb/>
ludicrous."</p>

<p><smcap>Near</smcap> the margin of the great river the scientists <lb/>
presently found a huge, shapely stone, with <lb/>
this inscription:</p>
<p>"<i>In 1847, in the spring, the river overflowed its <lb/>
banks and covered the whole township. The depth was <lb/>
from two to six feet. More than 900 head of cattle <lb/>
were lost, and many homes destroyed. The Mayor <lb/>
ordered this memorial to be erected to perpetuate the <lb/>
event. God spare us the repetition of it!</i>"</p>
<p>With infinite trouble, Professor Woodlouse suc- <lb/>
ceeded in making a translation of this inscription, <lb/>
which was sent home, and straightway an enormous <lb/>
excitement was created about it. It confirmed, in a <lb/>
remarkable way, certain treasured traditions of the <lb/>
ancients. The translation was slightly marred by <lb/>
one or two untranslatable words, but these did not <lb/>
impair the general clearness of the meaning. It is <lb/>
here presented:</p>
<p>"<i>One thousand eight hundred and forty-seven years</i> <lb/>
<pb n="184"/>
<i>ago, the</i> (<i>fires?</i>) <i>descended and consumed the whole <lb/>
city. Only some nine hundred souls were saved, all <lb/>
others destroyed. The</i> (<i>king?</i>) <i>commanded this stone <lb/>
to be set up to</i> &#x2026;.. (<i>untranslatable</i>) &#x2026;.. <i>pre- <lb/>
vent the repetition of it</i>."</p>
<p>This was the first successful and satisfactory trans- <lb/>
lation that had been made of the mysterious char- <lb/>
acter left behind him by extinct man, and it gave <lb/>
Professor Woodlouse such reputation that at once <lb/>
every seat of learning in his native land conferred a <lb/>
degree of the most illustrious grade upon him, and <lb/>
it was believed that if he had been a soldier and had <lb/>
turned his splendid talents to the extermination of a <lb/>
remote tribe of reptiles, the king would have en- <lb/>
nobled him and made him rich. And this, too, was <lb/>
the origin of that school of scientists called Manolo- <lb/>
gists, whose specialty is the deciphering of the <lb/>
ancient records of the extinct bird termed Man. <lb/>
[For it is now decided that Man was a bird and not <lb/>
a reptile.] But Professor Woodlouse began and re- <lb/>
mained chief of these, for it was granted that no <lb/>
translations were ever so free from error as his. <lb/>
Others made mistakes&#x2014;he seemed incapable of it. <lb/>
Many a memorial of the lost race was afterward <lb/>
found, but none ever attained to the renown and <lb/>
veneration achieved by the "Mayoritish Stone"&#x2014; <lb/>
it being so called from the word "Mayor" in <lb/>
it, which, being translated "King," "Mayoritish <lb/>
Stone" was but another way of saying "King <lb/>
Stone."</p>
<pb n="185"/>
<p>Another time the expedition made a great "find." <lb/>
It was a vast round flattish mass, ten frog-spans in <lb/>
diameter and five or six high. Professor Snail put <lb/>
on his spectacles and examined it all around, and <lb/>
then climbed up and inspected the top. He said:</p>
<p>"The result of my perlustration and perscontation <lb/>
of this isoperimetrical protuberance is a belief that it <lb/>
is one of those rare and wonderful creations left by <lb/>
the Mound Builders. The fact that this one is <lb/>
lamellibranchiate in its formation, simply adds to its <lb/>
interest as being possibly of a different kind from <lb/>
any we read of in the records of science, but yet in <lb/>
no manner marring its authenticity. Let the megalo- <lb/>
phonous grasshopper sound a blast and summon <lb/>
hither the perfunctory and circumforaneous Tumble- <lb/>
Bug, to the end that excavations may be made and <lb/>
learning gather new treasures."</p>
<p>Not a Tumble-Bug could be found on duty, so <lb/>
the Mound was excavated by a working party of <lb/>
Ants. Nothing was discovered. This would have <lb/>
been a great disappointment, had not the venerable <lb/>
Longlegs explained the matter. He said:</p>
<p>"It is now plain to me that the mysterious and <lb/>
forgotten race of Mound Builders did not always <lb/>
erect these edifices as mausoleums, else in this case, <lb/>
as in all previous cases, their skeletons would be <lb/>
found here, along with the rude implements which <lb/>
the creatures used in life. Is not this manifest?"</p>
<p>"True! true!" from everybody.</p>
<p>"Then we have made a discovery of peculiar <lb/>
<pb n="186"/>
value here; a discovery which greatly extends our <lb/>
knowledge of this creature in place of diminishing <lb/>
it; a discovery which will add luster to the achieve- <lb/>
ments of this expedition and win for us the com- <lb/>
mendations of scholars everywhere. For the absence <lb/>
of the customary relics here means nothing less than <lb/>
this: The Mound Builder, instead of being the igno- <lb/>
rant, savage reptile we have been taught to consider <lb/>
him, was a creature of cultivation and high intelli- <lb/>
gence, capable of not only appreciating worthy <lb/>
achievements of the great and noble of his species, <lb/>
but of commemorating them! Fellow-scholars, this <lb/>
stately Mound is not a sepulchre, it is a monument!"</p>
<p>A profound impression was produced by this.</p>
<p>But it was interrupted by rude and derisive <lb/>
laughter&#x2014;and the Tumble-Bug appeared.</p>
<p>"A monument!" quoth he. "A monument set <lb/>
up by a Mound Builder! Aye, so it is! So it is, <lb/>
indeed, to the shrewd keen eye of science; but to <lb/>
an ignorant poor devil who has never seen a college, <lb/>
it is not a Monument, strictly speaking, but is yet a <lb/>
most rich and noble property; and with your wor- <lb/>
ships' good permission I will proceed to manufacture <lb/>
it into spheres of exceeding grace and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>The Tumble-Bug was driven away with stripes, <lb/>
and the draughtsmen of the expedition were set to <lb/>
making views of the Monument from different stand- <lb/>
points, while Professor Woodlouse, in a frenzy of <lb/>
scientific zeal, traveled all over it and all around it <lb/>
hoping to find an inscription. But if there had ever <lb/>
<pb n="187"/>
been one it had decayed or been removed by some <lb/>
vandal as a relic.</p>
<p>The views having been completed, it was now <lb/>
considered safe to load the precious Monument itself <lb/>
upon the backs of four of the largest Tortoises and <lb/>
send it home to the king's museum, which was <lb/>
done; and when it arrived it was received with <lb/>
enormous <i>&#x00E9;clat</i> and escorted to its future abiding <lb/>
place by thousands of enthusiastic citizens, King <lb/>
Bullfrog XVI. himself attending and condescending <lb/>
to sit enthroned upon it throughout the progress.</p>
<p>The growing rigor of the weather was now ad- <lb/>
monishing the scientists to close their labors for the <lb/>
present, so they made preparations to journey home- <lb/>
ward. But even their last day among the Caverns <lb/>
bore fruit; for one of the scholars found in an <lb/>
out-of-the-way corner of the Museum or "Burial <lb/>
Place" a most strange and extraordinary thing. It <lb/>
was nothing less than a double Man-Bird lashed <lb/>
together breast to breast by a natural ligament, and <lb/>
labeled with the untranslatable words, "<i>Siamese <lb/>
Twins</i>." The official report concerning this thing <lb/>
closed thus:</p>
<p>"Wherefore it appears that there were in old <lb/>
times two distinct species of this majestic fowl, the <lb/>
one being single and the other double. Nature has <lb/>
a reason for all things. It is plain to the eye of <lb/>
science that the Double-Man originally inhabited a <lb/>
region where dangers abounded; hence he was <lb/>
paired together to the end that while one part slept <lb/>
<pb n="188"/>
the other might watch; and likewise that, danger <lb/>
being discovered, there might always be a double <lb/>
instead of a single power to oppose it. All honor <lb/>
to the mystery-dispelling eye of godlike Science!"</p>
<p>And near the Double Man-Bird was found what <lb/>
was plainly an ancient record of his, marked upon <lb/>
numberless sheets of a thin white substance and <lb/>
bound together. Almost the first glance that Pro- <lb/>
fessor Woodlouse threw into it revealed this follow- <lb/>
ing sentence, which he instantly translated and laid <lb/>
before the scientists, in a tremble, and it uplifted <lb/>
every soul there with exultation and astonishment:</p>
<p>"<i>In truth it is believed by many that the lower <lb/>
animals reason and talk together</i>."</p>
<p>When the great official report of the expedition <lb/>
appeared, the above sentence bore this comment:</p>
<p>"Then there are lower animals than Man! This <lb/>
remarkable passage can mean nothing else. Man <lb/>
himself is extinct, but <i>they</i> may still exist. What <lb/>
can they be? Where do they inhabit? One's en- <lb/>
thusiasm bursts all bounds in the contemplation of <lb/>
the brilliant field of discovery and investigation here <lb/>
thrown open to science. We close our labors with <lb/>
the humble prayer that your Majesty will immedi- <lb/>
ately appoint a commission and command it to rest <lb/>
not nor spare expense until the search for this <lb/>
hitherto unsuspected race of the creatures of God <lb/>
shall be crowned with success."</p>
<p>The expedition then journeyed homeward after its <lb/>
long absence and its faithful endeavors, and was re- <lb/>
<pb n="189"/>
ceived with a mighty ovation by the whole grateful <lb/>
country. There were vulgar, ignorant carpers, of <lb/>
course, as there always are and always will be; and <lb/>
naturally one of these was the obscene Tumble-Bug. <lb/>
He said that all he had learned by his travels was <lb/>
that science only needed a spoonful of supposition <lb/>
to build a mountain of demonstrated fact out of; <lb/>
and that for the future he meant to be content with <lb/>
the knowledge that nature had made free to all <lb/>
creatures and not go prying into the august secrets <lb/>
of the Deity.</p>

chiefs, Dilapidated-Vengeance and Biter-of-the-Clouds, were scalped <lb/>
last winter, this being the favorite direction to some, but others pre- <lb/>
ferring something else in consequence of things, the Mormon trail leav- <lb/>
ing Mosby's at three in the morning, and passing through Jawbone Flat <lb/>
to Blucher, and then down by Jug-Handle, the road passing to the right <lb/>
of it, and naturally leaving it on the right, too, and Dawson's on the left <lb/>
of the trail where it passes to the left of said Dawson's and onward <lb/>
thence to Tomahawk, thus making the route cheaper, easier of access to <lb/>
all who can get at it, and compassing all the desirable objects so consid- <lb/>
ered by others, and, therefore, conferring the most good upon the great- <lb/>
est number, and, consequently, I am encouraged to hope we shall. <lb/>
However, I shall be ready, and happy, to afford you still further <lb/>

<p><smcap>At</smcap> General G<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>'s reception the other night, the <lb/>
most fashionably dressed lady was Mrs. G. C. <lb/>
She wore a pink satin dress, plain in front but with <lb/>
a good deal of rake to it&#x2014;to the train, I mean; it <lb/>
was said to be two or three yards long. One could <lb/>
see it creeping along the floor some little time after <lb/>
the woman was gone. Mrs. C. wore also a white <lb/>
bodice, cut bias, with Pompadour sleeves, flounced <lb/>
with ruches; low neck, with the inside handkerchief <lb/>
not visible, with white kid gloves. She had on <lb/>
a pearl necklace, which glinted lonely, high up the <lb/>
midst of that barren waste of neck and shoulders. <lb/>
Her hair was frizzled into a tangled chaparral, for- <lb/>
ward of her ears, aft it was drawn together, and <lb/>
compactly bound and plaited into a stump like a <lb/>
pony's tail, and furthermore was canted upward at a <lb/>
sharp angle, and ingeniously supported by a red <lb/>
velvet crupper, whose forward extremity was made <lb/>
fast with a half-hitch around a hairpin on the top of <lb/>
her head. Her whole top hamper was neat and <lb/>
becoming. She had a beautiful complexion when <lb/>
<pb n="198"/>
she first came, but it faded out by degrees in an <lb/>
unaccountable way. However, it is not lost for <lb/>
good. I found the most of it on my shoulder after- <lb/>
wards. (I stood near the door when she squeezed <lb/>
out with the throng.) There were other ladies <lb/>
present, but I only took notes of one as a specimen. <lb/>
I would gladly enlarge upon the subject were I able <lb/>

<head><b>RILEY&#x2014;NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT</b></head>
<p><smcap>One</smcap> of the best men in Washington&#x2014;or else- <lb/>
where&#x2014;is <smcap>Riley</smcap>, correspondent of one of <lb/>
the great San Francisco dailies.</p>
<p>Riley is full of humor, and has an unfailing vein <lb/>
of irony, which makes his conversation to the last <lb/>
degree entertaining (as long as the remarks are <lb/>
about somebody else). But notwithstanding the <lb/>
possession of these qualities, which should enable a <lb/>
man to write a happy and an appetizing letter, <lb/>
Riley's newspaper letters often display a more than <lb/>
earthly solemnity, and likewise an unimaginative <lb/>
devotion to petrified facts, which surprise and dis- <lb/>
tress all men who know him in his unofficial char- <lb/>
acter. He explains this curious thing by saying <lb/>
that his employers sent him to Washington to write <lb/>
facts, not fancy, and that several times he has come <lb/>
near losing his situation by inserting humorous re- <lb/>
marks which, not being looked for at headquarters, <lb/>
and consequently not understood, were thought to <lb/>
be dark and bloody speeches intended to convey <lb/>
signals and warnings to murderous secret societies, <lb/>
or something of that kind, and so were scratched <lb/>
<pb n="200"/>
out with a shiver and a prayer and cast into the <lb/>
stove. Riley says that sometimes he is so afflicted <lb/>
with a yearning to write a sparkling and absorbingly <lb/>
readable letter that he simply cannot resist it, and <lb/>
so he goes to his den and revels in the delight of <lb/>
untrammeled scribbling; and then, with suffering such <lb/>
as only a mother can know, he destroys the pretty <lb/>
children of his fancy and reduces his letter to the <lb/>
required dismal accuracy. Having seen Riley do <lb/>
this very thing more than once, I know whereof I <lb/>
speak. Often I have laughed with him over a happy <lb/>
passage, and grieved to see him plow his pen <lb/>
through it. He would say, "I had to write that or <lb/>
die; and I've got to scratch it out or starve. <i>They</i> <lb/>
wouldn't stand it, you know."</p>
<p>I think Riley is about the most entertaining com- <lb/>
pany I ever saw. We lodged together in many <lb/>
places in Washington during the winter of '67&#x2013;8, <lb/>
moving comfortably from place to place, and attract- <lb/>
ing attention by paying our board&#x2014;a course which <lb/>
cannot fail to make a person conspicuous in Wash- <lb/>
ington. Riley would tell all about his trip to Cali- <lb/>
fornia in the early days, by way of the Isthmus and <lb/>
the San Juan river; and about his baking bread in <lb/>
San Francisco to gain a living, and setting up ten- <lb/>
pins, and practicing law, and opening oysters, and <lb/>
delivering lectures, and teaching French, and tend- <lb/>
ing bar, and reporting for the newspapers, and keep- <lb/>
ing dancing schools, and interpreting Chinese in the <lb/>
courts&#x2014;which latter was lucrative, and Riley was <lb/>
<pb n="201"/>
doing handsomely and laying up a little money <lb/>
when people began to find fault because his transla- <lb/>
tions were too "free," a thing for which Riley con- <lb/>
sidered he ought not to be held responsible, since <lb/>
he did not know a word of the Chinese tongue, and <lb/>
only adopted interpreting as a means of gaining an <lb/>
honest livelihood. Through the machinations of <lb/>
enemies he was removed from the position of official <lb/>
interpreter, and a man put in his place who was <lb/>
familiar with the Chinese language, but did not <lb/>
know any English. And Riley used to tell about <lb/>
publishing a newspaper up in what is Alaska now, <lb/>
but was only an iceberg then, with a population <lb/>
composed of bears, walruses, Indians, and other <lb/>
animals; and how the iceberg got adrift at last, and <lb/>
left all his paying subscribers behind, and as soon <lb/>
as the commonwealth floated out of the jurisdiction <lb/>
of Russia the people rose and threw off their alle- <lb/>
giance and ran up the English flag, calculating to <lb/>
hook on and become an English colony as they <lb/>
drifted along down the British Possessions; but a <lb/>
land breeze and a crooked current carried them by, <lb/>
and they ran up the Stars and Stripes and steered <lb/>
for California, missed the connection again and <lb/>
swore allegiance to Mexico, but it wasn't any use; <lb/>
the anchors came home every time, and away they <lb/>
went with the northeast trades drifting off sideways <lb/>
toward the Sandwich Islands, whereupon they ran <lb/>
up the Cannibal flag and had a grand human bar- <lb/>
becue in honor of it, in which it was noticed that <lb/>
<pb n="202"/>
the better a man liked a friend the better he enjoyed <lb/>
him; and as soon as they got fairly within the <lb/>
tropics the weather got so fearfully hot that the <lb/>
iceberg began to melt, and it got so sloppy under <lb/>
foot that it was almost impossible for ladies to get <lb/>
about at all; and at last, just as they came in sight <lb/>
of the islands, the melancholy remnant of the once <lb/>
majestic iceberg canted first to one side and then to <lb/>
the other, and then plunged under forever, carrying <lb/>
the national archives along with it&#x2014;and not only <lb/>
the archives and the populace, but some eligible <lb/>
town lots which had increased in value as fast as <lb/>
they diminished in size in the tropics, and which <lb/>
Riley could have sold at thirty cents a pound and <lb/>
made himself rich if he could have kept the province <lb/>
afloat ten hours longer and got her into port.</p>
<p>Riley is very methodical, untiringly accommo- <lb/>
dating, never forgets anything that is to be attended <lb/>
to, is a good son, a staunch friend, and a permanent <lb/>
reliable enemy. He will put himself to any amount <lb/>
of trouble to oblige a body, and therefore always <lb/>
has his hands full of things to be done for the help- <lb/>
less and the shiftless. And he knows how to do <lb/>
nearly everything, too. He is a man whose native <lb/>
benevolence is a wellspring that never goes dry. <lb/>
He stands always ready to help whoever needs help, <lb/>
as far as he is able&#x2014;and not simply with his <lb/>
money, for that is a cheap and common charity, <lb/>
but with hand and brain, and fatigue of limb and <lb/>
sacrifice of time. This sort of men is rare.</p>
<pb n="203"/>
<p>Riley has a ready wit, a quickness and aptness at <lb/>
selecting and applying quotations, and a countenance <lb/>
that is as solemn and as blank as the back side of a <lb/>
tombstone when he is delivering a particularly exas- <lb/>
perating joke. One night a negro woman was <lb/>
burned to death in a house next door to us, and <lb/>
Riley said that our landlady would be oppressively <lb/>
emotional at breakfast, because she generally made <lb/>
use of such opportunities as offered, being of a mor- <lb/>
bidly sentimental turn, and so we should find it best <lb/>
to let her talk along and say nothing back&#x2014;it was <lb/>
the only way to keep her tears out of the gravy. <lb/>
Riley said there never was a funeral in the neigh- <lb/>
borhood but that the gravy was watery for a week.</p>
<p>And, sure enough, at breakfast the landlady was <lb/>
down in the very sloughs of woe&#x2014;entirely broken- <lb/>
hearted. Everything she looked at reminded her <lb/>
of that poor old negro woman, and so the buck- <lb/>
wheat cakes made her sob, the coffee forced a groan, <lb/>
and when the beefsteak came on she fetched a wail <lb/>
that made our hair rise. Then she got to talking <lb/>
about deceased, and kept up a steady drizzle till <lb/>
both of us were soaked through and through. <lb/>
Presently she took a fresh breath and said, with a <lb/>
world of sobs:</p>
<p>"Ah, to think of it, only to think of it!&#x2014;the <lb/>
poor old faithful creature. For she was <i>so</i> faithful. <lb/>
Would you believe it, she had been a servant in that <lb/>
self-same house and that self-same family for twenty- <lb/>
seven years come Christmas, and never a cross word <lb/>
<pb n="204"/>
and never a lick! And, oh, to think she should <lb/>
meet such a death at last!&#x2014;a-sitting over the red- <lb/>
hot stove at three o'clock in the morning and went <lb/>
to sleep and fell on it and was actually <i>roasted!</i> <lb/>
Not just frizzled up a bit, but literally roasted to a <lb/>
crisp! Poor faithful creature, how she <i>was</i> cooked! <lb/>
I am but a poor woman, but even if I have to <lb/>
scrimp to do it, I will put up a tombstone over that <lb/>
lone sufferer's grave&#x2014;and Mr. Riley if you would <lb/>
have the goodness to think up a little epitaph to put <lb/>
on it which would sort of describe the awful way in <lb/>
which she met her&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Put it, '<i>Well done</i>, good and faithful servant,'" <lb/>
said Riley, and never smiled.</p>

<head><b>SCIENCE VS. LUCK</b><ref target="n23">*</ref><note id="n23" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1867.</p></note></head>
<p><smcap>At</smcap> that time, in Kentucky (said the Hon. Mr. <lb/>
K<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>), the law was very strict against what is <lb/>
termed "games of chance." About a dozen of the <lb/>
boys were detected playing "seven up" or "old <lb/>
sledge" for money, and the grand jury found a <lb/>
true bill against them. Jim Sturgis was retained to <lb/>
defend them when the case came up, of course. <lb/>
The more he studied over the matter, and looked <lb/>
into the evidence, the plainer it was that he must <lb/>
lose a case at last&#x2014;there was no getting around <lb/>
that painful fact. Those boys had certainly been <lb/>
betting money on a game of chance. Even public <lb/>
sympathy was roused in behalf of Sturgis. People <lb/>
said it was a pity to see him mar his successful <lb/>
career with a big prominent case like this, which <lb/>
must go against him.</p>
<p>But after several restless nights an inspired idea <lb/>
flashed upon Sturgis, and he sprang out of bed de- <lb/>
lighted. He thought he saw his way through. The <lb/>
next day he whispered around a little among his <lb/>
clients and a few friends, and then when the case <lb/>
<pb n="207"/>
came up in court he acknowledged the seven-up and <lb/>
the betting, and, as his sole defense, had the <lb/>
astounding effrontery to put in the plea that old <lb/>
sledge was not a game of chance! There was the <lb/>
broadest sort of a smile all over the faces of that <lb/>
sophisticated audience. The judge smiled with the <lb/>
rest. But Sturgis maintained a countenance whose <lb/>
earnestness was even severe. The opposite counsel <lb/>
tried to ridicule him out of his position, and did not <lb/>
succeed. The judge jested in a ponderous judicial <lb/>
way about the thing, but did not move him. The <lb/>
matter was becoming grave. The judge lost a little <lb/>
of his patience, and said the joke had gone far <lb/>
enough. Jim Sturgis said he knew of no joke in <lb/>
the matter&#x2014;his clients could not be punished for <lb/>
indulging in what some people chose to consider a <lb/>
game of chance until it was <i>proven</i> that it was a <lb/>
game of chance. Judge and counsel said that would <lb/>
be an easy matter, and forthwith called Deacons <lb/>
Job, Peters, Burke, and Johnson, and Dominies <lb/>
Wirt and Miggles, to testify; and they unanimously <lb/>
and with strong feeling put down the legal quibble <lb/>
of Sturgis by pronouncing that old sledge <i>was</i> a <lb/>
game of chance.</p>
<p>"What do you call it <i>now?</i>" said the judge.</p>
<p>"I call it a game of science!" retorted Sturgis; <lb/>
"and I'll prove it, too!"</p>
<p>They saw his little game.</p>
<p>He brought in a cloud of witnesses, and produced <lb/>
an overwhelming mass of testimony, to show that <lb/>
<pb n="208"/>
old sledge was not a game of chance but a game of <lb/>
science.</p>
<p>Instead of being the simplest case in the world, it <lb/>
had somehow turned out to be an excessively knotty <lb/>
one. The judge scratched his head over it a while, <lb/>
and said there was no way of coming to a determina- <lb/>
tion, because just as many men could be brought <lb/>
into court who would testify on one side as could be <lb/>
found to testify on the other. But he said he was <lb/>
willing to do the fair thing by all parties, and would <lb/>
act upon any suggestion Mr. Sturgis would make <lb/>
for the solution of the difficulty.</p>
<p>Mr. Sturgis was on his feet in a second.</p>
<p>"Impanel a jury of six of each, Luck <i>versus</i> <lb/>
Science. Give them candles and a couple of decks <lb/>
of cards. Send them into the jury room, and just <lb/>
abide by the result!"</p>
<p>There was no disputing the fairness of the propo- <lb/>
sition. The four deacons and the two dominies <lb/>
were sworn in as the "chance" jurymen, and six <lb/>
inveterate old seven-up professors were chosen to <lb/>
represent the "science" side of the issue. They <lb/>
retired to the jury room.</p>
<p>In about two hours Deacon Peters sent into court <lb/>
to borrow three dollars from a friend. [Sensation.] <lb/>
In about two hours more Dominie Miggles sent into <lb/>
court to borrow a "stake" from a friend. [Sensa- <lb/>
tion.] During the next three or four hours the other <lb/>
dominie and the other deacons sent into court for <lb/>
small loans. And still the packed audience waited, <lb/>
<pb n="209"/>
for it was a prodigious occasion in Bull's Corners, <lb/>
and one in which every father of a family was neces- <lb/>
sarily interested.</p>
<p>The rest of the story can be told briefly. About <lb/>
daylight the jury came in, and Deacon Job, the <lb/>
foreman, read the following</p>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>verdict</smcap>.</head>
<p>We, the jury in the case of the Commonwealth of <lb/>
Kentucky vs. John Wheeler <i>et al</i>., have carefully <lb/>
considered the points of the case, and tested the <lb/>
merits of the several theories advanced, and do <lb/>
hereby unanimously decide that the game commonly <lb/>
known as old sledge or seven-up is eminently a game <lb/>
of science and not of chance. In demonstration <lb/>
whereof it is hereby and herein stated, iterated, <lb/>
reiterated, set forth, and made manifest that, during <lb/>
the entire night, the "chance" men never won a <lb/>
game or turned a jack, although both feats were <lb/>
common and frequent to the opposition; and further- <lb/>
more, in support of this our verdict, we call atten- <lb/>
tion to the significant fact that the "chance" men <lb/>
are all busted, and the "science" men have got the <lb/>
money. It is the deliberate opinion of this jury, <lb/>
that the "chance" theory concerning seven-up is a <lb/>
pernicious doctrine, and calculated to inflict untold <lb/>
suffering and pecuniary loss upon any community <lb/>
that takes stock in it.</p>
<p>"That is the way that seven-up came to be set <lb/>
<pb n="210"/>
apart and particularized in the statute books of Ken- <lb/>
tucky as being a game not of chance but of science, <lb/>
and therefore not punishable under the law," said <lb/>
Mr. K<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>. "That verdict is of record, and holds <lb/>
good to this day."</p>

<q>["Never put off till to-morrow what you can do day after to-morrow <lb/>
just as well."&#x2014;B. F.]</q>
<p><smcap>This</smcap> party was one of those persons whom they <lb/>
call Philosophers. He was twins, being born <lb/>
simultaneously in two different houses in the city of <lb/>
Boston. These houses remain unto this day, and <lb/>
have signs upon them worded in accordance with <lb/>
the facts. The signs are considered well enough to <lb/>
have, though not necessary, because the inhabitants <lb/>
point out the two birthplaces to the stranger any- <lb/>
how, and sometimes as often as several times in the <lb/>
same day. The subject of this memoir was of a <lb/>
vicious disposition, and early prostituted his talents <lb/>
to the invention of maxims and aphorisms calculated <lb/>
to inflict suffering upon the rising generation of all <lb/>
subsequent ages. His simplest acts, also, were con- <lb/>
trived with a view to their being held up for the <lb/>
emulation of boys forever&#x2014;boys who might other- <lb/>
wise have been happy. It was in this spirit that he <lb/>
became the son of a soap-boiler, and probably for <lb/>
no other reason than that the efforts of all future <lb/>
<pb n="212"/>
boys who tried to be anything might be looked upon <lb/>
with suspicion unless they were the sons of soap- <lb/>
boilers. With a malevolence which is without paral- <lb/>
lel in history, he would work all day, and then sit <lb/>
up nights, and let on to be studying algebra by the <lb/>
light of a smouldering fire, so that all other boys <lb/>
might have to do that also, or else have Benjamin <lb/>
Franklin thrown up to them. Not satisfied with <lb/>
these proceedings, he had a fashion of living wholly <lb/>
on bread and water, and studying astronomy at meal- <lb/>
time&#x2014;a thing which has brought affliction to <lb/>
millions of boys since, whose fathers had read <lb/>
Franklin's pernicious biography.</p>
<p>His maxims were full of animosity toward boys <lb/>
Nowadays a boy cannot follow out a single natural <lb/>
instinct without tumbling over some of those ever- <lb/>
lasting aphorisms and hearing from Franklin on the <lb/>
spot. If he buys two cents' worth of peanuts, his <lb/>
father says, "Remember what Franklin has said, <lb/>
my son&#x2014;'A groat a day's a penny a year;'" and <lb/>
the comfort is all gone out of those peanuts. If he <lb/>
wants to spin his top when he has done work, his <lb/>
father quotes, "Procrastination is the thief of time." <lb/>
If he does a virtuous action, he never gets anything <lb/>
for it, because "Virtue is its own reward." And <lb/>
that boy is hounded to death and robbed of his <lb/>
natural rest, because Franklin said once, in one of <lb/>
his inspired flights of malignity: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Early to bed and early to rise</l>
<l>Makes a man healthy and wealthy and wise."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<pb n="213"/>
<p>As if it were any object to a boy to be healthy <lb/>
and wealthy and wise on such terms. The sorrow <lb/>
that that maxim has cost me through my parents' <lb/>
experimenting on me with it, tongue cannot tell. <lb/>
The legitimate result is my present state of general <lb/>
debility, indigence, and mental aberration. My <lb/>
parents used to have me up before nine o'clock in <lb/>
the morning sometimes when I was a boy. If they <lb/>
had let me take my natural rest where would I have <lb/>
been now? Keeping store, no doubt, and respected <lb/>
by all.</p>
<p>And what an adroit old adventurer the subject of <lb/>
this memoir was! In order to get a chance to fly <lb/>
his kite on Sunday he used to hang a key on the <lb/>
string and let on to be fishing for lightning. And a <lb/>
guileless public would go home chirping about <lb/>
the "wisdom" and the "genius" of the hoary <lb/>
Sabbath-breaker. If anybody caught him playing <lb/>
"mumble-peg" by himself, after the age of sixty, <lb/>
he would immediately appear to be ciphering out <lb/>
how the grass grew&#x2014;as if it was any of his busi- <lb/>
ness. My grandfather knew him well, and he says <lb/>
Franklin was always fixed&#x2014;always ready. If a <lb/>
body, during his old age, happened on him unex- <lb/>
pectedly when he was catching flies, or making mud <lb/>
pies, or sliding on a cellar door, he would imme- <lb/>
diately look wise, and rip out a maxim, and walk off <lb/>
with his nose in the air and his cap turned wrong <lb/>
side before, trying to appear absent-minded and <lb/>
eccentric. He was a hard lot.</p>
<pb n="214"/>
<p>He invented a stove that would smoke your head <lb/>
off in four hours by the clock. One can see the <lb/>
almost devilish satisfaction he took in it by his giving <lb/>
it his name.</p>
<p>He was always proud of telling how he entered <lb/>
Philadelphia for the first time, with nothing in the <lb/>
world but two shillings in his pocket and four rolls <lb/>
of bread under his arm. But really, when you come <lb/>
to examine it critically, it was nothing. Anybody <lb/>
could have done it.</p>
<p>To the subject of this memoir belongs the honor <lb/>
of recommending the army to go back to bows and <lb/>
arrows in place of bayonets and muskets. He ob- <lb/>
served, with his customary force, that the bayonet <lb/>
was very well under some circumstances, but that he <lb/>
doubted whether it could be used with accuracy at a <lb/>
long range.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin did a great many notable things <lb/>
for his country, and made her young name to be <lb/>
honored in many lands as the mother of such a son. <lb/>
It is not the idea of this memoir to ignore that or <lb/>
cover it up. No; the simple idea of it is to snub <lb/>
those pretentious maxims of his, which he worked <lb/>
up with a great show of originality out of truisms <lb/>
that had become wearisome platitudes as early as <lb/>
the dispersion from Babel; and also to snub his <lb/>
stove, and his military inspirations, his unseemly <lb/>
endeavor to make himself conspicuous when he <lb/>
entered Philadelphia, and his flying his kite and fool- <lb/>
ing away his time in all sorts of such ways when he <lb/>
<pb n="215"/>
ought to have been foraging for soap-fat, or con- <lb/>
structing candles. I merely desired to do away with <lb/>
somewhat of the prevalent calamitous idea among <lb/>
heads of families that Franklin <i>acquired</i> his great <lb/>
genius by working for nothing, studying by moon- <lb/>
light, and getting up in the night instead of waiting <lb/>
till morning like a Christian; and that this pro- <lb/>
gramme, rigidly inflicted, will make a Franklin of <lb/>
every father's fool. It is time these gentlemen were <lb/>
finding out that these execrable eccentricities of in- <lb/>
stinct and conduct are only the <i>evidences</i> of genius, <lb/>
not the <i>creators</i> of it. I wish I had been the father <lb/>
of my parents long enough to make them compre- <lb/>
hend this truth, and thus prepare them to let their <lb/>
son have an easier time of it. When I was a child <lb/>
I had to boil soap, notwithstanding my father was <lb/>
wealthy, and I had to get up early and study <lb/>
geometry at breakfast, and peddle my own poetry, <lb/>
and do everything just as Franklin did, in the solemn <lb/>
hope that I would be a Franklin some day. And <lb/>
here I am.</p>

<head><b>MR. BLOKE'S ITEM</b><ref target="n25">*</ref><note id="n25" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1865.</p></note></head>
<p><smcap>Our</smcap> esteemed friend, Mr. John William Bloke, <lb/>
of Virginia City, walked into the office where <lb/>
we are sub-editor at a late hour last night, with an <lb/>
expression of profound and heartfelt suffering upon <lb/>
his countenance, and, sighing heavily, laid the fol- <lb/>
lowing item reverently upon the desk, and walked <lb/>
slowly out again. He paused a moment at the <lb/>
door, and seemed struggling to command his feel- <lb/>
ings sufficiently to enable him to speak, and then, <lb/>
nodding his head towards his manuscript, ejaculated <lb/>
in a broken voice, "Friend of mine&#x2014;oh! how <lb/>
sad!" and burst into tears. We were so moved at <lb/>
his distress that we did not think to call him back <lb/>
and endeavor to comfort him until he was gone, and <lb/>
it was too late. The paper had already gone to <lb/>
press, but knowing that our friend would consider <lb/>
the publication of this item important, and cherish- <lb/>
ing the hope that to print it would afford a melan- <lb/>
choly satisfaction to his sorrowing heart, we stopped <lb/>
the press at once and inserted it in our columns: <lb/>
<q><smcap>Distressing Accident</smcap>.&#x2014;Last evening, about six o'clock, as Mr. <lb/>
William Schuyler, an old and respectable citizen of South Park, was <lb/>
<pb n="217"/>
leaving his residence to go down town, as has been his usual custom for <lb/>
many years with the exception only of a short interval in the spring of <lb/>
1850, during which he was confined to his bed by injuries received in <lb/>
attempting to stop a runaway horse by thoughtlessly placing himself <lb/>
directly in its wake and throwing up his hands and shouting, which if <lb/>
he had done so even a single moment sooner, must inevitably have <lb/>
frightened the animal still more instead of checking its speed, although <lb/>
disastrous enough to himself as it was, and rendered more melancholy <lb/>
and distressing by reason of the presence of his wife's mother, who was <lb/>
there and saw the sad occurrence, notwithstanding it is at least likely, <lb/>
though not necessarily so, that she should be reconnoitering in another <lb/>
direction when incidents occur, not being vivacious and on the lookout, <lb/>
as a general thing, but even the reverse, as her own mother is said to <lb/>
have stated, who is no more, but died in the full hope of a glorious <lb/>
resurrection, upwards of three years ago, aged eighty-six, being a Chris- <lb/>
tian woman and without guile, as it were, or property, in consequence of <lb/>
the fire of 1849, which destroyed every single thing she had in the world. <lb/>
But such is life. Let us all take warning by this solemn occurrence, and <lb/>
let us endeavor so to conduct ourselves that when we come to die we can <lb/>
do it. Let us place our hands upon our heart, and say with earnestness <lb/>
and sincerity that from this day forth we will beware of the intoxicating <lb/>
bowl.&#x2014;<i>First Edition of the Californian</i>.</q></p>
<p>The head editor has been in here raising the mis- <lb/>
chief, and tearing his hair and kicking the furniture <lb/>
about, and abusing me like a pickpocket. He says <lb/>
that every time he leaves me in charge of the paper <lb/>
for half an hour, I get imposed upon by the first <lb/>
infant or the first idiot that comes along. And he <lb/>
says that that distressing item of Mr. Bloke's is <lb/>
nothing but a lot of distressing bosh, and has no <lb/>
point to it, and no sense in it, and no information in <lb/>
it, and that there was no sort of necessity for stop- <lb/>
ping the press to publish it.</p>
<p>Now all this comes of being good-hearted. If I <lb/>
<pb n="218"/>
had been as unaccommodating and unsympathetic as <lb/>
some people, I would have told Mr. Bloke that I <lb/>
wouldn't receive his communication at such a late <lb/>
hour; but no, his snuffling distress touched my <lb/>
heart, and I jumped at the chance of doing some- <lb/>
thing to modify his misery. I never read his item <lb/>
to see whether there was anything wrong about it, <lb/>
but hastily wrote the few lines which preceded it, <lb/>
and sent it to the printers. And what has my kind- <lb/>
ness done for me? It has done nothing but bring <lb/>
down upon me a storm of abuse and ornamental <lb/>
blasphemy.</p>
<p>Now I will read that item myself, and see if there is <lb/>
any foundation for all this fuss. And if there is, <lb/>
the author of it shall hear from me.</p>
<p>I have read it, and I am bound to admit that it <lb/>
seems a little mixed at a first glance. However, I <lb/>
will peruse it once more.</p>
<p>I have read it again, and it does really seem a <lb/>
good deal more mixed than ever.</p>
<p>I have read it over five times, but if I can get at <lb/>
the meaning of it, I wish I may get my just deserts. <lb/>
It won't bear analysis. There are things about it <lb/>
which I cannot understand at all. It don't say <lb/>
whatever became of William Schuyler. It just says <lb/>
enough about him to get one interested in his career, <lb/>
and then drops him. Who is William Schuyler, <lb/>
<pb n="219"/>
anyhow, and what part of South Park did he live in, <lb/>
and if he started down town at six o'clock, did he <lb/>
ever get there, and if he did, did anything happen <lb/>
to him? Is <i>he</i> the individual that met with the <lb/>
"distressing accident"? Considering the elaborate <lb/>
circumstantiality of detail observable in the item, it <lb/>
seems to me that it ought to contain more informa- <lb/>
tion than it does. On the contrary, it is obscure&#x2014; <lb/>
and not only obscure, but utterly incomprehensible. <lb/>
Was the breaking of Mr. Schuyler's leg, fifteen <lb/>
years ago, the "distressing accident" that plunged <lb/>
Mr. Bloke into unspeakable grief, and caused him <lb/>
to come up here at dead of night and stop our press <lb/>
to acquaint the world with the circumstance? Or <lb/>
did the "distressing accident" consist in the de- <lb/>
struction of Schuyler's mother-in-law's property in <lb/>
early times? Or did it consist in the death of that <lb/>
person herself three years ago (albeit it does not <lb/>
appear that she died by accident)? In a word, what <lb/>
<i>did</i> that "distressing accident" consist in? What <lb/>
did that driveling ass of a Schuyler stand <i>in the <lb/>
wake</i> of a runaway horse for, with his shouting and <lb/>
gesticulating, if he wanted to stop him? And how <lb/>
the mischief could he get run over by a horse that <lb/>
had already passed beyond him? And what are we <lb/>
to take "warning" by? And how is this extraordi- <lb/>
nary chapter of incomprehensibilities going to be a <lb/>
"lesson" to us? And, above all, what has the <lb/>
intoxicating "bowl" got to do with it, anyhow? It is <lb/>
not stated that Schuyler drank, or that his wife <lb/>
<pb n="220"/>
drank, or that his mother-in-law drank, or that the <lb/>
horse drank&#x2014;wherefore, then, the reference to the <lb/>
intoxicating bowl? It does seem to me that if Mr. <lb/>
Bloke had let the intoxicating bowl alone himself, <lb/>
he never would have got into so much trouble about <lb/>
this exasperating imaginary accident. I have read <lb/>
this absurd item over and over again, with all its <lb/>
insinuating plausibility, until my head swims; but I <lb/>
can make neither head nor tail of it. There certainly <lb/>
seems to have been an accident of some kind or <lb/>
other, but it is impossible to determine what the <lb/>
nature of it was, or who was the sufferer by it. I <lb/>
do not like to do it, but I feel compelled to request <lb/>
that the next time anything happens to one of Mr. <lb/>
Bloke's friends, he will append such explanatory <lb/>
notes to his account of it as will enable me to find <lb/>
out what sort of an accident it was and whom it <lb/>
happened to. I had rather all his friends should die <lb/>
than that I should be driven to the verge of lunacy <lb/>
again in trying to cipher out the meaning of another <lb/>
such production as the above.</p>

<div3 type="section" n="I">
<head>CHAPTER I. <lb/>
<smcap>the secret revealed</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> was night. Stillness reigned in the grand old <lb/>
feudal castle of Klugenstein. The year 1222 <lb/>
was drawing to a close. Far away up in the tallest <lb/>
of the castle's towers a single light glimmered. A <lb/>
secret council was being held there. The stern old <lb/>
lord of Klugenstein sat in a chair of state meditat- <lb/>
ing. Presently he said, with a tender accent: "My <lb/>
daughter!"</p>
<p>A young man of noble presence, clad from <lb/>
head to heel in knightly mail, answered: "Speak, <lb/>
father!"</p>
<p>"My daughter, the time is come for the reveal- <lb/>
ing of the mystery that hath puzzled all your young <lb/>
life. Know, then, that it had its birth in the matters <lb/>
which I shall now unfold. My brother Ulrich is the <lb/>
great Duke of Brandenburgh. Our father, on his <lb/>
deathbed, decreed that if no son were born to Ulrich <lb/>
the succession should pass to my house, provided a <lb/>
<i>son</i> were born to me. And further, in case no son <lb/>
<pb n="222"/>
were born to either, but only daughters, then the <lb/>
succession should pass to Ulrich's daughter if she <lb/>
proved stainless; if she did not, my daughter should <lb/>
succeed if she retained a blameless name. And so I <lb/>
and my old wife here prayed fervently for the good <lb/>
boon of a son, but the prayer was vain. You were <lb/>
born to us. I was in despair. I saw the mighty <lb/>
prize slipping from my grasp&#x2014;the splendid dream <lb/>
vanishing away! And I had been so hopeful! Five <lb/>
years had Ulrich lived in wedlock, and yet his wife <lb/>
had borne no heir of either sex.</p>
<p>"'But hold,' I said, 'all is not lost.' A saving <lb/>
scheme had shot athwart my brain. You were born <lb/>
at midnight. Only the leech, the nurse, and six <lb/>
waiting-women knew your sex. I hanged them <lb/>
every one before an hour sped. Next morning all <lb/>
the barony went mad with rejoicing over the procla- <lb/>
mation that a <i>son</i> was born to Klugenstein&#x2014;an heir <lb/>
to mighty Brandenburgh! And well the secret has <lb/>
been kept. You mother's own sister nursed your <lb/>
infancy, and from that time forward we feared <lb/>
nothing.</p>
<p>"When you were ten years old a daughter was <lb/>
born to Ulrich. We grieved, but hoped for good <lb/>
results from measles, or physicians, or other natural <lb/>
enemies of infancy, but were always disappointed. <lb/>
She lived, she throve&#x2014;Heaven's malison upon her! <lb/>
But it is nothing. We are safe. For, ha! ha! have <lb/>
we not a son? And is not our son the future duke? <lb/>
Our well-beloved Conrad, is it not so?&#x2014;for woman <lb/>
<pb n="223"/>
of eight-and-twenty years as you are, my child, none <lb/>
other name than that hath ever fallen to <i>you!</i></p>
<p>"Now it hath come to pass that age hath laid its <lb/>
hand upon my brother, and he waxes feeble. The <lb/>
cares of state do tax him sore, therefore he wills <lb/>
that you shall come to him and be already duke in <lb/>
act, though not yet in name. Your servitors are <lb/>
ready&#x2014;you journey forth to-night.</p>
<p>"Now listen well. Remember every word I say. <lb/>
There is a law as old as Germany, that if any woman <lb/>
sit for a single instant in the great ducal chair before <lb/>
she hath been absolutely crowned in presence of the <lb/>
people&#x2014;<smcap>she shall die!</smcap> So heed my words. <lb/>
Pretend humility. Pronounce your judgments from <lb/>
the Premier's chair, which stands at the <i>foot</i> of the <lb/>
throne. Do this until you are crowned and safe. <lb/>
It is not likely that your sex will ever be discovered, <lb/>
but still it is the part of wisdom to make all things <lb/>
as safe as may be in this treacherous earthly life.</p>
<p>"Oh, my father! is it for this my life hath been <lb/>
a lie? Was it that I might cheat my unoffending <lb/>
cousin of her rights? Spare me, father, spare your <lb/>
child!"</p>
<p>"What, hussy! Is this my reward for the august <lb/>
fortune my brain has wrought for thee? By the <lb/>
bones of my father, this puling sentiment of thine <lb/>
but ill accords with my humor. Betake thee to the <lb/>
duke instantly, and beware how thou meddlest with <lb/>
my purpose!"</p>
<p>Let this suffice of the conversation. It is enough <lb/>
<pb n="224"/>
for us to know that the prayers, the entreaties, and <lb/>
the tears of the gentle-natured girl availed nothing. <lb/>
Neither they nor anything could move the stout old <lb/>
lord of Klugenstein. And so, at last, with a heavy <lb/>
heart, the daughter saw the castle gates close behind <lb/>
her, and found herself riding away in the darkness <lb/>
surrounded by a knightly array of armed vassals and <lb/>
a brave following of servants.</p>
<p>The old baron sat silent for many minutes after <lb/>
his daughter's departure, and then he turned to his <lb/>
sad wife, and said:</p>
<p>"Dame, our matters seem speeding fairly. It is <lb/>
full three months since I sent the shrewd and hand- <lb/>
some Count Detzin on his devilish mission to my <lb/>
brother's daughter Constance. If he fail we are not <lb/>
wholly safe, but if he do succeed no power can bar <lb/>
our girl from being duchess, e'en though ill fortune <lb/>
should decree she never should be duke!"</p>
<p>"My heart is full of bodings; yet all may still be <lb/>
well."</p>
<p>"Tush, woman! Leave the owls to croak. To <lb/>
bed with ye, and dream of Brandenburgh and <lb/>
grandeur!"</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="II">
<head>CHAPTER II. <lb/>
<smcap>festivity and tears</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>Six</smcap> days after the occurrences related in the <lb/>
above chapter, the brilliant capital of the Duchy of <lb/>
<pb n="225"/>
Brandenburgh was resplendent with military pagean- <lb/>
try, and noisy with the rejoicings of loyal multitudes, <lb/>
for Conrad, the young heir to the crown, was come. <lb/>
The old duke's heart was full of happiness, for <lb/>
Conrad's handsome person and graceful bearing had <lb/>
won his love at once. The great halls of the palace <lb/>
were thronged with nobles, who welcomed Conrad <lb/>
bravely; and so bright and happy did all things seem, <lb/>
that he felt his fears and sorrows passing away, and <lb/>
giving place to a comforting contentment.</p>
<p>But in a remote apartment of the palace a scene <lb/>
of a different nature was transpiring. By a window <lb/>
stood the duke's only child, the Lady Constance. <lb/>
Her eyes were red and swollen, and full of tears. <lb/>
She was alone. Presently she fell to weeping anew, <lb/>
and said aloud:</p>
<p>"The villain Detzin is gone&#x2014;has fled the duke- <lb/>
dom! I could not believe it at first, but, alas! it is <lb/>
too true. And I loved him so. I dared to love him <lb/>
though I knew the duke, my father, would never let <lb/>
me wed him. I loved him&#x2014;but now I hate him! <lb/>
With all my soul I hate him! Oh, what is to be- <lb/>
come of me? I am lost, lost, lost! I shall go <lb/>
mad!"</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="III">
<head>CHAPTER III. <lb/>
<smcap>the plot thickens</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>A few</smcap> months drifted by. All men published <lb/>
the praises of the young Conrad's government, <lb/>
<pb n="226"/>
and extolled the wisdom of his judgments, the merci- <lb/>
fulness of his sentences, and the modesty with which <lb/>
he bore himself in his great office. The old duke <lb/>
soon gave everything into his hands, and sat apart <lb/>
and listened with proud satisfaction while his heir <lb/>
delivered the decrees of the crown from the seat of <lb/>
the Premier. It seemed plain that one so loved and <lb/>
praised and honored of all men as Conrad was could <lb/>
not be otherwise than happy. But, strangely enough, <lb/>
he was not. For he saw with dismay that the <lb/>
Princess Constance had begun to love him! The <lb/>
love of the rest of the world was happy fortune for <lb/>
him, but this was freighted with danger! And he <lb/>
saw, moreover, that the delighted duke had discov- <lb/>
ered his daughter's passion likewise, and was already <lb/>
dreaming of a marriage. Every day somewhat of <lb/>
the deep sadness that had been in the princess's <lb/>
face faded away; every day hope and animation <lb/>
beamed brighter from her eye; and by and by even <lb/>
vagrant smiles visited the face that had been so <lb/>
troubled.</p>
<p>Conrad was appalled. He bitterly cursed himself <lb/>
for having yielded to the instinct that had made him <lb/>
seek the companionship of one of his own sex when <lb/>
he was new and a stranger in the palace&#x2014;when he <lb/>
was sorrowful and yearned for a sympathy such as <lb/>
only women can give or feel. He now began to <lb/>
avoid his cousin. But this only made matters worse, <lb/>
for, naturally enough, the more he avoided her the <lb/>
more she cast herself in his way. He marveled at <lb/>
<pb n="227"/>
this at first, and next it startled him. The girl <lb/>
haunted him; she hunted him; she happened upon <lb/>
him at all times and in all places, in the night as <lb/>
well as in the day. She seemed singularly anxious. <lb/>
There was surely a mystery somewhere.</p>
<p>This could not go on forever. All the world <lb/>
was talking about it. The duke was beginning to <lb/>
look perplexed. Poor Conrad was becoming a very <lb/>
ghost through dread and dire distress. One day as <lb/>
he was emerging from a private anteroom attached <lb/>
to the picture gallery Constance confronted him, and <lb/>
seizing both his hands in hers, exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Oh, why do you avoid me? What have I done <lb/>
&#x2014;what have I said, to lose your kind opinion of <lb/>
me&#x2014;for surely I had it once? Conrad, do not <lb/>
despise me, but pity a tortured heart? I cannot, <lb/>
cannot hold the words unspoken longer, lest they <lb/>
kill me&#x2014;I <smcap>love you, Conrad</smcap>! There, despise <lb/>
me if you must, but they <i>would</i> be uttered!"</p>
<p>Conrad was speechless. Constance hesitated a <lb/>
moment, and then, misinterpreting his silence, a <lb/>
wild gladness flamed in her eyes, and she flung her <lb/>
arms about his neck and said:</p>
<p>"You relent! you relent! You <i>can</i> love me&#x2014; <lb/>
you <i>will</i> love me! Oh, say you will, my own, my <lb/>
worshiped Conrad!"</p>
<p>Conrad groaned aloud. A sickly pallor over- <lb/>
spread his countenance, and he trembled like an <lb/>
aspen. Presently, in desperation, he thrust the poor <lb/>
girl from him, and cried:</p>
<pb n="228"/>
<p>"You know not what you ask! It is forever and <lb/>
ever impossible!" And then he fled like a criminal, <lb/>
and left the princess stupefied with amazement. A <lb/>
minute afterward she was crying and sobbing there, <lb/>
and Conrad was crying and sobbing in his chamber. <lb/>
Both were in despair. Both saw ruin staring them <lb/>
in the face.</p>
<p>By and by Constance rose slowly to her feet and <lb/>
moved away, saying:</p>
<p>"To think that he was despising my love at the <lb/>
very moment that I thought it was melting his cruel <lb/>
heart! I hate him! He spurned me&#x2014;did this <lb/>
man&#x2014;he spurned me from him like a dog!"</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="IV">
<head>CHAPTER IV. <lb/>
<smcap>the awful revelation</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>Time</smcap> passed on. A settled sadness rested once <lb/>
more upon the countenance of the good duke's <lb/>
daughter. She and Conrad were seen together no <lb/>
more now. The duke grieved at this. But as the <lb/>
weeks wore away Conrad's color came back to his <lb/>
cheeks, and his old-time vivacity to his eye, and <lb/>
he administered the government with a clear and <lb/>
steadily ripening wisdom.</p>
<p>Presently a strange whisper began to be heard <lb/>
about the palace. It grew louder; it spread farther. <lb/>
The gossips of the city got hold of it. It swept the <lb/>
dukedom. And this is what the whisper said:</p>
<pb n="229"/>
<p>"The Lady Constance hath given birth to a <lb/>
child!"</p>
<p>When the lord of Klugenstein heard it he swung <lb/>
his plumed helmet thrice around his head and <lb/>
shouted:</p>
<p>"Long live Duke Conrad!&#x2014;for lo, his crown is <lb/>
sure from this day forward! Detzin has done his <lb/>
errand well, and the good scoundrel shall be re- <lb/>
warded!"</p>
<p>And he spread the tidings far and wide, and for <lb/>
eight-and-forty hours no soul in all the barony but <lb/>
did dance and sing, carouse and illuminate, to cele- <lb/>
brate the great event, and all proud and happy at <lb/>
old Klugenstein's expense.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="V">
<head>CHAPTER V. <lb/>
<smcap>the frightful catastrophe</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> trial was at hand. All the great lords and <lb/>
barons of Brandenburgh were assembled in the <lb/>
Hall of Justice in the ducal palace. No space was <lb/>
left unoccupied where there was room for a spec- <lb/>
tator to stand or sit. Conrad, clad in purple and <lb/>
ermine, sat in the Premier's chair, and on either side <lb/>
sat the great judges of the realm. The old duke <lb/>
had sternly commanded that the trial of his daughter <lb/>
should proceed without favor, and then had taken to <lb/>
his bed broken-hearted. His days were numbered. <lb/>
Poor Conrad had begged, as for his very life, that <lb/>
<pb n="230"/>
he might be spared the misery of sitting in judgment <lb/>
upon his cousin's crime, but it did not avail.</p>
<p>The saddest heart in all that great assemblage was <lb/>
in Conrad's breast.</p>
<p>The gladdest was in his father's, for, unknown to <lb/>
his daughter "Conrad," the old Baron Klugenstein <lb/>
was come, and was among the crowd of nobles <lb/>
triumphant in the swelling fortunes of his house.</p>
<p>After the heralds had made due proclamation <lb/>
and the other preliminaries had followed, the vener- <lb/>
able Lord Chief Justice said: "Prisoner, stand <lb/>
forth!"</p>
<p>The unhappy princess rose, and stood unveiled <lb/>
before the vast multitude. The Lord Chief Justice <lb/>
continued:</p>
<p>"Most noble lady, before the great judges of this <lb/>
realm it hath been charged and proven that out of <lb/>
holy wedlock your Grace hath given birth unto a <lb/>
child, and by our ancient law the penalty is death <lb/>
excepting in one sole contingency, whereof his Grace <lb/>
the acting duke, our good Lord Conrad, will adver- <lb/>
tise you in his solemn sentence now; wherefore give <lb/>
heed."</p>
<p>Conrad stretched forth his reluctant scepter, and <lb/>
in the salf-same moment the womanly heart beneath <lb/>
his robe yearned pityingly toward the doomed pris- <lb/>
oner, and the tears came into his eyes. He opened <lb/>
his lips to speak, but the Lord Chief Justice said <lb/>
quickly:</p>
<p>"Not there, your Grace, not there! It is not <lb/>
<pb n="231"/>
lawful to pronounce judgment upon any of the ducal <lb/>
line <smcap>save from the ducal throne</smcap>!"</p>
<p>A shudder went to the heart of poor Conrad, and <lb/>
a tremor shook the iron frame of his old father like- <lb/>
wise. <smcap>Conrad had not been crowned</smcap>&#x2014;dared <lb/>
he profane the throne? He hesitated and turned <lb/>
pale with fear. But it must be done. Wondering <lb/>
eyes were already upon him. They would be sus- <lb/>
picious eyes if he hesitated longer. He ascended <lb/>
the throne. Presently he stretched forth the scepter <lb/>
again, and said:</p>
<p>"Prisoner, in the name of our sovereign Lord <lb/>
Ulrich, Duke of Brandenburgh, I proceed to the <lb/>
solemn duty that hath devolved upon me. Give <lb/>
heed to my words. By the ancient law of the land, <lb/>
except you produce the partner of your guilt and <lb/>
deliver him up to the executioner you must surely <lb/>
die. Embrace this opportunity&#x2014;save yourself while <lb/>
yet you may. Name the father of your child!"</p>
<p>A solemn hush fell upon the great court&#x2014;a silence <lb/>
so profound that men could hear their own hearts <lb/>
beat. Then the princess slowly turned, with eyes <lb/>
gleaming with hate, and pointing her finger straight <lb/>
at Conrad, said:</p>
<p>"Thou art the man!"</p>
<p>An appalling conviction of his helpless, hopeless <lb/>
peril struck a chill to Conrad's heart like the chill of <lb/>
death itself. What power on earth could save him! <lb/>
To disprove the charge he must reveal that he was a <lb/>
woman, and for an uncrowned woman to sit in the <lb/>
<pb n="232"/>
ducal chair was death! At one and the same mo- <lb/>
ment he and his grim old father swooned and fell to <lb/>
the ground.</p>
<p>The remainder of this thrilling and eventful story <lb/>
will <smcap>not</smcap> be found in this or any other publication, <lb/>
either now or at any future time.</p>
<p>The truth is, I have got my hero (or heroine) <lb/>
into such a particularly close place that I do not see <lb/>
how I am ever going to get him (or her) out of it <lb/>
again, and therefore I will wash my hands of the <lb/>
whole business, and leave that person to get out the <lb/>
best way that offers&#x2014;or else stay there. I thought <lb/>
it was going to be easy enough to straighten out <lb/>
that little difficulty, but it looks different now.</p>

<head><b>AFTER-DINNER SPEECH</b></head>
<q>[<smcap>at a fourth of july gathering, in london, of <lb/>
americans</smcap>]</q>
<p><smcap>Mr. chairman and ladies and gen- <lb/>
tlemen</smcap>: I thank you for the compliment <lb/>
which has just been tendered me, and to show my <lb/>
appreciation of it I will not afflict you with many <lb/>
words. It is pleasant to celebrate in this peaceful <lb/>
way, upon this old mother soil, the anniversary of <lb/>
an experiment which was born of war with this same <lb/>
land so long ago, and wrought out to a successful <lb/>
issue by the devotion of our ancestors. It has <lb/>
taken nearly a hundred years to bring the English <lb/>
and Americans into kindly and mutually appreciative <lb/>
relations, but I believe it has been accomplished at <lb/>
last. It was a great step when the two last mis- <lb/>
understandings were settled by arbitration instead of <lb/>
cannon. It is another great step when England <lb/>
adopts our sewing-machines without claiming the <lb/>
invention&#x2014;as usual. It was another when they <lb/>
imported one of our sleeping cars the other day. <lb/>
And it warmed my heart more than I can tell, <lb/>
yesterday, when I witnessed the spectacle of an <lb/>
<pb n="235"/>
Englishman ordering an American sherry cobbler of <lb/>
his own free will and accord&#x2014;and not only that <lb/>
but with a great brain and a level head reminding <lb/>
the barkeeper not to forget the strawberries. With <lb/>
a common origin, a common language, a common <lb/>
literature, a common religion and&#x2014;common drinks, <lb/>
what is longer needful to the cementing of the two <lb/>
nations together in a permanent bond of brother- <lb/>
hood?</p>
<p>This is an age of progress, and ours is a progres- <lb/>
sive land. A great and glorious land, too&#x2014;a land <lb/>
which has developed a Washington, a Franklin, a <lb/>
Wm. M. Tweed, a Longfellow, a Motley, a Jay <lb/>
Gould, a Samuel C. Pomeroy, a recent Congress <lb/>
which has never had its equal (in some respects), <lb/>
and a United States Army which conquered sixty <lb/>
Indians in eight months by tiring them out&#x2014;which <lb/>
is much better than uncivilized slaughter, God knows. <lb/>
We have a criminal jury system which is superior to <lb/>
any in the world; and its efficiency is only marred <lb/>
by the difficulty of finding twelve men every day <lb/>
who don't know anything and can't read. And I <lb/>
may observe that we have an insanity plea that <lb/>
would have saved Cain. I think I can say, and say <lb/>
with pride, that we have some legislatures that bring <lb/>
higher prices than any in the world.</p>
<p>I refer with effusion to our railway system, which <lb/>
consents to let us live, though it might do the oppo- <lb/>
site, being our owners. It only destroyed three <lb/>
thousand and seventy lives last year by collisions, <lb/>
<pb n="236"/>
and twenty-seven thousand two hundred and sixty <lb/>
by running over heedless and unnecessary people at <lb/>
crossings. The companies seriously regretted the <lb/>
killing of these thirty thousand people, and went so <lb/>
far as to pay for some of them&#x2014;voluntarily, of <lb/>
course, for the meanest of us would not claim that <lb/>
we possess a court treacherous enough to enforce a <lb/>
law against a railway company. But, thank Heaven, <lb/>
the railway companies are generally disposed to do <lb/>
the right and kindly thing without compulsion. I <lb/>
know of an instance which greatly touched me at <lb/>
the time. After an accident the company sent <lb/>
home the remains of a dear distant old relative of <lb/>
mine in a basket, with the remark, "Please state <lb/>
what figure you hold him at&#x2014;and return the <lb/>
basket." Now there couldn't be anything friendlier <lb/>
than that.</p>
<p>But I must not stand here and brag all night. <lb/>
However, you won't mind a body bragging a little <lb/>
about his country on the fourth of July. It is a fair <lb/>
and legitimate time to fly the eagle. I will say only <lb/>
one more word of brag&#x2014;and a hopeful one. It is <lb/>
this. We have a form of government which gives <lb/>
each man a fair chance and no favor. With us no <lb/>
individual is born with a right to look down upon <lb/>
his neighbor and hold him in contempt. Let such <lb/>
of us as are not dukes find our consolation in <lb/>
that. And we may find hope for the future in <lb/>
the fact that as unhappy as is the condition of our <lb/>
political morality to-day, England has risen up out <lb/>
<pb n="237"/>
of a far fouler since the days when Charles I. <lb/>
ennobled courtesans and all political place was a <lb/>
matter of bargain and sale. There is hope for us <lb/>
yet.<ref target="n27">*</ref><note id="n27" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>At least the above is the speech which I was <i>going</i> to make, but <lb/>
our minister, Gen. Schenck, presided, and after the blessing, got up and <lb/>
made a great long inconceivably dull harangue, and wound up by saying <lb/>
that inasmuch as speech-making did not seem to exhilarate the guests <lb/>
much, all further oratory would be dispensed with during the evening, <lb/>
and we could just sit and talk privately to our elbow-neighbors and have <lb/>
a good sociable time. It is known that in consequence of that remark <lb/>
forty-four perfected speeches died in the womb. The depression, the <lb/>
gloom, the solemnity that reigned over the banquet from that time forth <lb/>
will be a lasting memory with many that were there. By that one <lb/>
thoughtless remark Gen. Schenck lost forty-four of the best friends he <lb/>
had in England. More than one said that night, "And this is the sort <lb/>
of person that is sent to represent us in a great sister empire!"</p></note></p>

<head><b>LIONIZING MURDERERS</b></head>
<p><smcap>I had</smcap> heard so much about the celebrated fortune- <lb/>
teller Madame<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>, that I went to see her <lb/>
yesterday. She has a dark complexion naturally, <lb/>
and this effect is heightened by artificial aids which <lb/>
cost her nothing. She wears curls&#x2014;very black <lb/>
ones, and I had an impression that she gave their <lb/>
native attractiveness a lift with rancid butter. She <lb/>
wears a reddish check handkerchief, cast loosely <lb/>
around her neck, and it was plain that her other one <lb/>
is slow getting back from the wash. I presume she <lb/>
takes snuff. At any rate, something resembling it <lb/>
had lodged among the hairs sprouting from her <lb/>
upper lip. I know she likes garlic&#x2014;I knew that as <lb/>
soon as she sighed. She looked at me searchingly <lb/>
for nearly a minute, with her black eyes, and then <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"It is enough. Come!"</p>
<p>She started down a very dark and dismal corridor <lb/>
&#x2014;I stepping close after her. Presently she stopped, <lb/>
and said that, as the way was so crooked and dark, <lb/>
perhaps she had better get a light. But it seemed <lb/>
ungallant to allow a woman to put herself to so <lb/>
much trouble for me, and so I said:</p>
<pb n="239"/>
<p>"It is not worth while, madam. If you will <lb/>
heave another sigh, I think I can follow it."</p>
<p>So we got along all right. Arrived at her official <lb/>
and mysterious den, she asked me to tell her the <lb/>
date of my birth, the exact hour of that occurrence, <lb/>
and the color of my grandmother's hair. I answered <lb/>
as accurately as I could. Then she said:</p>
<p>"Young man, summon your fortitude&#x2014;do not <lb/>
tremble. I am about to reveal the past."</p>
<p>"Information concerning the <i>future</i> would be in a <lb/>
general way, more&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Silence! You have had much trouble, some <lb/>
joy, some good fortune, some bad. Your great <lb/>
grandfather was hanged."</p>
<p>"That is a l&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Silence! Hanged sir. But it was not his fault. <lb/>
He could not help it."</p>
<p>"I am glad you do him justice."</p>
<p>"Ah&#x2014;grieve, rather, that the jury did. He was <lb/>
hanged. His star crosses yours in the fourth divi- <lb/>
sion, fifth sphere. Consequently you will be hanged <lb/>
also."</p>
<p>"In view of this cheerful&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I <i>must</i> have silence. Yours was not, in the <lb/>
beginning, a criminal nature, but circumstances <lb/>
changed it. At the age of nine you stole sugar. <lb/>
At the age of fifteen you stole money. At twenty <lb/>
you stole horses. At twenty-five you committed <lb/>
arson. At thirty, hardened in crime, you became <lb/>
an editor. You are now a public lecturer. Worse <lb/>
<pb n="240"/>
things are in store for you. You will be sent to <lb/>
Congress. Next, to the penitentiary. Finally, hap- <lb/>
piness will come again&#x2014;all will be well&#x2014;you will <lb/>
be hanged."</p>
<p>I was now in tears. It seemed hard enough to <lb/>
go to Congress; but to be hanged&#x2014;this was too <lb/>
sad, too dreadful. The woman seemed surprised at <lb/>
my grief. I told her the thoughts that were in my <lb/>
mind. Then she comforted me.</p>
<p>"Why, man,"<ref target="n28">*</ref><note id="n28" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>In this paragraph the fortune-teller details the exact history of the <lb/>
Pike-Brown assassination case in New Hampshire, from the succoring <lb/>
and saving of the stranger Pike by the Browns, to the subsequent hang- <lb/>
ing and coffining of that treacherous miscreant. She adds nothing, <lb/>
invents nothing, exaggerates nothing (see any New England paper for <lb/>
November, 1869). This Pike-Brown case is selected merely as a type, <lb/>
to illustrate a custom that prevails, not in New Hampshire alone, but in <lb/>
every State in the Union&#x2014;I mean the sentimental custom of visiting, <lb/>
petting, glorifying, and snuffling over murderers like this Pike, from the <lb/>
day they enter the jail under sentence of death until they swing from the <lb/>
gallows. The following extract from the <i>Temple Bar</i> (1866) reveals <lb/>
the fact that this custom is not confined to the United States:&#x2014;"On <lb/>
December 31, 1841, a man named John Johnes, a shoemaker, mur- <lb/>
dered his sweetheart, Mary Hallam, the daughter of a respectable <lb/>
laborer, at Mansfield, in the county of Nottingham. He was executed <lb/>
on March 23, 1842. He was a man of unsteady habits, and gave way <lb/>
to violent fits of passion. The girl declined his addresses, and he said <lb/>
if he did not have her no one else should. After he had inflicted the <lb/>
first wound, which was not immediately fatal, she begged for her life, <lb/>
but seeing him resolved, asked for time to pray. He said that he would <lb/>
pray for both, and completed the crime. The wounds were inflicted by <lb/>
a shoemaker's knife, and her throat was cut barbarously. After this he <lb/>
dropped on his knees some time, and prayed God to have mercy on two <lb/>
unfortunate lovers. He made no attempt to escape, and confessed the <lb/>
crime. After his imprisonment he behaved in a most decorous manner; <lb/>
he won upon the good opinion of the jail chaplain, and he was visited <lb/>
by the Bishop of Lincoln. It does not appear that he expressed any <lb/>
contrition for the crime, but seemed to pass away with triumphant cer- <lb/>
tainty that he was going to rejoin his victim in heaven. <i>He was visited <lb/>
by some pious and benevolent ladies of Nottingham, some of whom <lb/>
declared he was a child of God, if ever there was one. One of the <lb/>
ladies sent him a white camelia to wear at his execution</i>."</p></note> she said, "hold up your head&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="241"/>
<i>you</i> have nothing to grieve about. Listen. You <lb/>
will live in New Hampshire. In your sharp need <lb/>
and distress the Brown family will succor you&#x2014; <lb/>
such of them as Pike the assassin left alive. They <lb/>
will be benefactors to you. When you shall have <lb/>
grown fat upon their bounty, and are grateful and <lb/>
happy, you will desire to make some modest return <lb/>
for these things, and so you will go to the house <lb/>
some night and brain the whole family with an axe. <lb/>
You will rob the dead bodies of your benefactors, <lb/>
and disburse your gains in riotous living among the <lb/>
rowdies and courtesans of Boston. Then you will <lb/>
be arrested, tried, condemned to be hanged, thrown <lb/>
into prison. Now is your happy day. You will be <lb/>
converted&#x2014;you will be converted just as soon as <lb/>
every effort to compass pardon, commutation, or <lb/>
reprieve has failed&#x2014;and then! Why, then, every <lb/>
morning and every afternoon, the best and purest <lb/>
young ladies of the village will assemble in your cell <lb/>
and sing hymns. This will show that assassination <lb/>
is respectable. Then you will write a touching <lb/>
letter, in which you will forgive all those recent <lb/>
Browns. This will excite the public admiration. No <lb/>
public can withstand magnanimity. Next, they will <lb/>
<pb n="242"/>
take you to the scaffold, with great <i>&#x00E9;clat</i>, at the <lb/>
head of an imposing procession composed of clergy- <lb/>
men, officials, citizens generally, and young ladies <lb/>
walking pensively two and two, and bearing bouquets <lb/>
and immortelles. You will mount the scaffold, and <lb/>
while the great concourse stand uncovered in your <lb/>
presence, you will read your sappy little speech <lb/>
which the minister has written for you. And then, <lb/>
in the midst of a grand and impressive silence, they <lb/>
will swing you into per <gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> Paradise, my son. <lb/>
There will not be a dry eye on the ground. You <lb/>
will be a hero! Not a rough there but will envy <lb/>
you. Not a rough there but will resolve to emulate <lb/>
you. And next, a great procession will follow you <lb/>
to the tomb&#x2014;will weep over your remains&#x2014;the <lb/>
young ladies will sing again the hymns made dear <lb/>
by sweet associations connected with the jail, and, <lb/>
as a last tribute of affection, respect, and apprecia- <lb/>
tion of your many sterling qualities, they will walk <lb/>
two and two around your bier, and strew wreaths of <lb/>
flowers on it. And lo! you are canonized. Think <lb/>
of it, son&#x2014;ingrate, assassin, robber of the dead, <lb/>
drunken brawler among thieves and harlots in the <lb/>
slums of Boston one month, and the pet of the <lb/>
pure and innocent daughters of the land the next! <lb/>
A bloody and hateful devil&#x2014;a bewept, bewailed, <lb/>
and sainted martyr&#x2014;all in a month! Fool!&#x2014;so <lb/>
noble a fortune, and yet you sit here grieving!"</p>
<p>"No, madame," I said, "you do me wrong, <lb/>
you do, indeed. I am perfectly satisfied. I did <lb/>
<pb n="243"/>
not know before that my great-grandfather was <lb/>
hanged, but it is of no consequence. He has prob- <lb/>
ably ceased to bother about it by this time&#x2014;and I <lb/>
have not commenced yet. I confess, madame, that <lb/>
I do something in the way of editing and lecturing, <lb/>
but the other crimes you mention have escaped my <lb/>
memory. Yet I must have committed them&#x2014;you <lb/>
would not deceive a stranger. But let the past be <lb/>
as it was, and let the future be as it may&#x2014;these <lb/>
are nothing. I have only cared for one thing. I <lb/>
have always felt that I should be hanged some day, <lb/>
and somehow the thought has annoyed me consider- <lb/>
ably; but if you can only assure me that I shall be <lb/>
hanged in New Hampshire&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Not a shadow of a doubt!"</p>
<p>"Bless you, my benefactress!&#x2014;excuse this em- <lb/>
brace&#x2014;you have removed a great load from my <lb/>
breast. To be hanged in New Hampshire is happi- <lb/>
ness&#x2014;it leaves an honored name behind a man, <lb/>
and introduces him at once into the best New <lb/>
Hampshire society in the other world."</p>
<p>I then took leave of the fortune-teller. But, <lb/>
seriously, is it well to glorify a murderous villain <lb/>
on the scaffold, as Pike was glorified in New Hamp- <lb/>
shire? Is it well to turn the penalty for a bloody <lb/>
crime into a reward? Is it just to do it? Is it safe?</p>

<pb n="244"/>
<head><b>A NEW CRIME</b> <lb/>
<smcap>legislation needed</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>This</smcap> country, during the last thirty or forty <lb/>
years, has produced some of the most remark- <lb/>
able cases of insanity of which there is any mention <lb/>
in history. For instance, there was the Baldwin <lb/>
case, in Ohio, twenty-two years ago. Baldwin, from <lb/>
his boyhood up, had been of a vindictive, malignant, <lb/>
quarrelsome nature. He put a boy's eye out once, <lb/>
and never was heard upon any occasion to utter a <lb/>
regret for it. He did many such things. But at <lb/>
last he did something that was serious. He called <lb/>
at a house just after dark one evening, knocked, and <lb/>
when the occupant came to the door, shot him <lb/>
dead, and then tried to escape, but was captured. <lb/>
Two days before, he had wantonly insulted a help- <lb/>
less cripple, and the man he afterward took swift <lb/>
vengeance upon with an assassin bullet had knocked <lb/>
him down. Such was the Baldwin case. The trial <lb/>
was long and exciting; the community was fearfully <lb/>
wrought up. Men said this spiteful, bad-hearted <lb/>
villain had caused grief enough in his time, and now <lb/>
he should satisfy the law. But they were mistaken; <lb/>
<pb n="245"/>
Baldwin was <i>insane</i> when he did the deed&#x2014;they <lb/>
had not thought of that. By the argument of <lb/>
counsel it was shown that at half-past ten in the <lb/>
morning on the day of the murder, Baldwin became <lb/>
insane, and remained so for eleven hours and a half <lb/>
exactly. This just covered the case comfortably, <lb/>
and he was acquitted. Thus, if an unthinking and <lb/>
excited community had been listened to instead of <lb/>
the arguments of counsel, a poor crazy creature <lb/>
would have been held to a fearful responsibility for <lb/>
a mere freak of madness. Baldwin went clear, and <lb/>
although his relatives and friends were naturally in- <lb/>
censed against the community for their injurious <lb/>
suspicions and remarks, they said let it go for this <lb/>
time, and did not prosecute. The Baldwins were <lb/>
very wealthy. This same Baldwin had momentary <lb/>
fits of insanity twice afterward, and on both occa- <lb/>
sions killed people he had grudges against. And on <lb/>
both these occasions the circumstances of the killing <lb/>
were so aggravated, and the murders so seemingly <lb/>
heartless and treacherous, that if Baldwin had not <lb/>
been insane he would have been hanged without the <lb/>
shadow of a doubt. As it was, it required all his <lb/>
political and family influence to get him clear in one <lb/>
of the cases, and cost him not less than ten thousand <lb/>
dollars to get clear in the other. One of these men <lb/>
he had notoriously been threatening to kill for twelve <lb/>
years. The poor creature happened, by the merest <lb/>
piece of ill fortune, to come along a dark alley at <lb/>
the very moment that Baldwin's insanity came upon <lb/>
<pb n="246"/>
him, and so he was shot in the back with a gun <lb/>
loaded with slugs.</p>
<p>Take the case of Lynch Hackett, of Pennsylvania. <lb/>
Twice, in public, he attacked a German butcher by <lb/>
the name of Bemis Feldner, with a cane, and both <lb/>
times Feldner whipped him with his fists. Hackett <lb/>
was a vain, wealthy, violent gentleman, who held <lb/>
his blood and family in high esteem, and believed <lb/>
that a reverent respect was due to his great riches. <lb/>
He brooded over the shame of his chastisement for <lb/>
two weeks, and then, in a momentary fit of insanity, <lb/>
armed himself to the teeth, rode into town, waited a <lb/>
couple of hours until he saw Feldner coming down <lb/>
the street with his wife on his arm, and then, as the <lb/>
couple passed the doorway in which he had partially <lb/>
concealed himself, he drove a knife into Feldner's <lb/>
neck, killing him instantly. The widow caught the <lb/>
limp form and eased it to the earth. Both were <lb/>
drenched with blood. Hackett jocosely remarked <lb/>
to her that as a professional butcher's recent wife <lb/>
she could appreciate the artistic neatness of the job <lb/>
that left her in condition to marry again, in case she <lb/>
wanted to. This remark, and another which he <lb/>
made to a friend, that his position in society made <lb/>
the killing of an obscure citizen simply an "eccen- <lb/>
tricity" instead of a crime, were shown to be evi- <lb/>
dences of insanity, and so Hackett escaped punish- <lb/>
ment. The jury were hardly inclined to accept these <lb/>
as proofs at first, inasmuch as the prisoner had never <lb/>
been insane before the murder, and under the tran- <lb/>
<pb n="247"/>
quilizing effect of the butchering had immediately <lb/>
regained his right mind; but when the defense came <lb/>
to show that a third cousin of Hackett's wife's step- <lb/>
father was insane, and not only insane, but had a <lb/>
nose the very counterpart of Hackett's, it was plain <lb/>
that insanity was hereditary in the family, and <lb/>
Hackett had come by it by legitimate inheritance. <lb/>
Of course the jury then acquitted him. But it was <lb/>
a merciful providence that Mrs. H.'s people had <lb/>
been afflicted as shown, else Hackett would certainly <lb/>
have been hanged.</p>
<p>However, it is not possible to recount all the mar- <lb/>
velous cases of insanity that have come under the <lb/>
public notice in the last thirty or forty years. There <lb/>
was the Durgin case in New Jersey three years ago. <lb/>
The servant girl, Bridget Durgin, at dead of night, <lb/>
invaded her mistress' bedroom and carved the lady <lb/>
literally to pieces with a knife. Then she dragged <lb/>
the body to the middle of the floor, and beat and <lb/>
banged it with chairs and such things. Next she <lb/>
opened the feather beds, and strewed the contents <lb/>
around, saturated everything with kerosene, and set <lb/>
fire to the general wreck. She now took up the <lb/>
young child of the murdered woman in her blood- <lb/>
smeared hands and walked off, through the snow, <lb/>
with no shoes on, to a neighbor's house a quarter <lb/>
of a mile off, and told a string of wild, incoherent <lb/>
stories about some men coming and setting fire to <lb/>
the house; and then she cried piteously, and with- <lb/>
out seeming to think there was anything suggestive <lb/>
<pb n="248"/>
about the blood upon her hands, her clothing, and <lb/>
the baby, volunteered the remark that she was <lb/>
afraid those men had murdered her mistress! After- <lb/>
ward, by her own confession and other testimony, it <lb/>
was proved that the mistress had always been kind <lb/>
to the girl, consequently there was no revenge in the <lb/>
murder; and it was also shown that the girl took noth- <lb/>
ing away from the burning house, not even her own <lb/>
shoes, and consequently robbery was not the motive. <lb/>
Now, the reader says, "Here comes that same old <lb/>
plea of insanity again." But the reader has deceived <lb/>
himself this time. No such plea was offered in her <lb/>
defense. The judge sentenced her, nobody perse- <lb/>
cuted the governor with petitions for her pardon, <lb/>
and she was promptly hanged.</p>
<p>There was that youth in Pennsylvania, whose <lb/>
curious confession was published some years ago. <lb/>
It was simply a conglomeration of incoherent drivel <lb/>
from beginning to end, and so was his lengthy <lb/>
speech on the scaffold afterward. For a whole year <lb/>
he was haunted with a desire to disfigure a certain <lb/>
young woman, so that no one would marry her. <lb/>
He did not love her himself, and did not want to <lb/>
marry her, but he did not want anybody else to do <lb/>
it. He would not go anywhere with her, and yet <lb/>
was opposed to anybody else's escorting her. Upon <lb/>
one occasion he declined to go to a wedding with <lb/>
her, and when she got other company, lay in wait <lb/>
for the couple by the road, intending to make them <lb/>
go back or kill the escort. After spending sleepless <lb/>
<pb n="249"/>
nights over his ruling desire for a full year, he at <lb/>
last attempted its execution&#x2014;that is, attempted to <lb/>
disfigure the young woman. It was a success. It <lb/>
was permanent. In trying to shoot her cheek (as <lb/>
she sat at the supper table with her parents and <lb/>
brothers and sisters) in such a manner as to mar its <lb/>
comeliness, one of his bullets wandered a little out <lb/>
of the course, and she dropped dead. To the very <lb/>
last moment of his life he bewailed the ill luck that <lb/>
made her move her face just at the critical moment. <lb/>
And so he died, apparently about half persuaded <lb/>
that somehow it was chiefly her own fault that she <lb/>
got killed. This idiot was hanged. The plea of <lb/>
insanity was not offered.</p>
<p>Insanity certainly is on the increase in the world, <lb/>
and crime is dying out. There are no longer any <lb/>
murders&#x2014;none worth mentioning, at any rate. <lb/>
Formerly, if you killed a man, it was possible that <lb/>
you were insane&#x2014;but now, if you, having friends <lb/>
and money, kill a man, it is <i>evidence</i> that you are a <lb/>
lunatic. In these days, too, if a person of good <lb/>
family and high social standing steals anything, they <lb/>
call it <i>kleptomania</i>, and send him to the lunatic <lb/>
asylum. If a person of high standing squanders his <lb/>
fortune in dissipation, and closes his career with <lb/>
strychnine or a bullet, "Temporary Aberration" is <lb/>
what was the trouble with <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>Is not this insanity plea becoming rather common? <lb/>
Is it not so common that the reader confidently ex- <lb/>
pects to see it offered in every criminal case that <lb/>
<pb n="250"/>
comes before the courts? And is it not so cheap, <lb/>
and so common, and often so trivial, that the reader <lb/>
smiles in derision when the newspaper mentions it? <lb/>
And is it not curious to note how very often it wins <lb/>
acquittal for the prisoner? Of late years it does not <lb/>
seem possible for a man to so conduct himself, <lb/>
before killing another man, as not to be manifestly <lb/>
insane. If he talks about the stars, he is insane. If <lb/>
he appears nervous and uneasy an hour before the <lb/>
killing, he is insane. If he weeps over a great grief, <lb/>
his friends shake their heads, and fear that he is <lb/>
"not right." If, an hour after the murder, he <lb/>
seems ill at ease, preoccupied and excited, he is <lb/>
unquestionably insane.</p>
<p>Really, what we want now, is not laws against <lb/>
crime, but a law against <i>insanity</i>. There is where <lb/>
the true evil lies.</p>

<head><b>A CURIOUS DREAM</b><ref target="n29">*</ref><note id="n29" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1870.</p></note> <lb/>
<smcap>containing a moral</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>Night</smcap> before last I had a singular dream. I <lb/>
seemed to be sitting on a doorstep (in no par- <lb/>
ticular city perhaps) ruminating, and the time of <lb/>
night appeared to be about twelve or one o'clock. <lb/>
The weather was balmy and delicious. There was <lb/>
no human sound in the air, not even a footstep. <lb/>
There was no sound of any kind to emphasize the <lb/>
dead stillness, except the occasional hollow barking <lb/>
of a dog in the distance and the fainter answer of a <lb/>
further dog. Presently up the street I heard a bony <lb/>
clack-clacking, and guessed it was the castanets of a <lb/>
serenading party. In a minute more a tall skeleton, <lb/>
hooded, and half-clad in a tattered and mouldy <lb/>
shroud, whose shreds were flapping about the ribby <lb/>
lattice-work of its person swung by me with a stately <lb/>
stride, and disappeared in the gray gloom of the <lb/>
starlight. It had a broken and worm-eaten coffin on <lb/>
its shoulder and a bundle of something in its hand. <lb/>
I knew what the clack-clacking was then; it was <lb/>
this party's joints working together, and his elbows <lb/>
<pb n="252"/>
knocking against his sides as he walked. I may say <lb/>
I was surprised. Before I could collect my thoughts <lb/>
and enter upon any speculations as to what this ap- <lb/>
parition might portend, I heard another one coming <lb/>
&#x2014;for I recognized his clack-clack. He had two- <lb/>
thirds of a coffin on his shoulder, and some foot <lb/>
and head-boards under his arm. I mightily wanted <lb/>
to peer under his hood and speak to him, but when <lb/>
he turned and smiled upon me with his cavernous <lb/>
sockets and his projecting grin as he went by, I <lb/>
thought I would not detain him. He was hardly <lb/>
gone when I heard the clacking again, and another <lb/>
one issued from the shadowy half-light. This one <lb/>
was bending under a heavy gravestone, and dragging <lb/>
a shabby coffin after him by a string. When he got <lb/>
to me he gave me a steady look for a moment or <lb/>
two, and then rounded to and backed up to me, <lb/>
saying:</p>
<p>"Ease this down for a fellow, will you?"</p>
<p>I eased the gravestone down till it rested on the <lb/>
ground, and in doing so noticed that it bore the <lb/>
name of "John Baxter Copmanhurst," with "May, <lb/>
1839," as the date of his death. Deceased sat <lb/>
wearily down by me, and wiped his os frontis with <lb/>
his major maxillary&#x2014;chiefly from former habit I <lb/>
judged, for I could not see that he brought away <lb/>
any perspiration.</p>
<p>"It is too bad, too bad," said he, drawing the <lb/>
remnant of the shroud about him and leaning his <lb/>
jaw pensively on his hand. Then he put his left <lb/>
<pb n="253"/>
foot up on his knee and fell to scratching his ankle <lb/>
bone absently with a rusty nail which he got out of <lb/>
his coffin.</p>
<p>"What is too bad, friend?"</p>
<p>"Oh, everything, everything. I almost wish I <lb/>
never had died."</p>
<p>"You surprise me. Why do you say this? Has <lb/>
anything gone wrong? What is the matter?"</p>
<p>"Matter! Look at this shroud&#x2014;rags. Look <lb/>
at this gravestone, all battered up. Look at that <lb/>
disgraceful old coffin. All a man's property going <lb/>
to ruin and destruction before his eyes, and ask him <lb/>
if anything is wrong? Fire and brimstone!"</p>
<p>"Calm yourself, calm yourself," I said. "It <i>is</i> <lb/>
too bad&#x2014;it is certainly too bad, but then I had not <lb/>
supposed that you would much mind such matters, <lb/>
situated as you are."</p>
<p>"Well, my dear sir, I <i>do</i> mind them. My pride <lb/>
is hurt, and my comfort is impaired&#x2014;destroyed, I <lb/>
might say. I will state my case&#x2014;I will put it to <lb/>
you in such a way that you can comprehend it, if <lb/>
you will let me," said the poor skeleton, tilting the <lb/>
hood of his shroud back, as if he were clearing for <lb/>
action, and thus unconsciously giving himself a <lb/>
jaunty and festive air very much at variance with <lb/>
the grave character of his position in life&#x2014;so to <lb/>
speak&#x2014;and in prominent contrast with his distress- <lb/>
ful mood.</p>
<p>"Proceed," said I.</p>
<p>"I reside in the shameful old graveyard a block <lb/>
<pb n="254"/>
or two above you here, in this street&#x2014;there, now, <lb/>
I just expected that cartilage would let go!&#x2014;third <lb/>
rib from the bottom, friend, hitch the end of it to <lb/>
my spine with a string, if you have got such a thing <lb/>
about you, though a bit of silver wire is a deal <lb/>
pleasanter, and more durable and becoming, if one <lb/>
keeps it polished&#x2014;to think of shredding out and <lb/>
going to pieces in this way, just on account of the <lb/>
indifference and neglect of one's posterity!"&#x2014;and <lb/>
the poor ghost grated his teeth in a way that gave <lb/>
me a wrench and a shiver&#x2014;for the effect is mightily <lb/>
increased by the absence of muffling flesh and <lb/>
cuticle. "I reside in that old graveyard, and have <lb/>
for these thirty years; and I tell you things are <lb/>
changed since I first laid this old tired frame there, <lb/>
and turned over, and stretched out for a long sleep, <lb/>
with a delicious sense upon me of being <i>done</i> with <lb/>
bother, and grief, and anxiety, and doubt, and fear, <lb/>
forever and ever, and listening with comfortable and <lb/>
increasing satisfaction to the sexton's work, from <lb/>
the startling clatter of his first spadeful on my coffin <lb/>
till it dulled away to the faint patting that shaped <lb/>
the roof of my new home&#x2014;delicious! My! I wish <lb/>
you could try it to-night!" and out of my reverie <lb/>
deceased fetched me with a rattling slap with a bony <lb/>
hand.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, thirty years ago I laid me down there, <lb/>
and was happy. For it was out in the country then <lb/>
&#x2014;out in the breezy, flowery, grand old woods, and <lb/>
the lazy winds gossiped with the leaves, and the <lb/>
<pb n="255"/>
squirrels capered over us and around us, and the <lb/>
creeping things visited us, and the birds filled the <lb/>
tranquil solitude with music. Ah, it was worth ten <lb/>
years of a man's life to be dead then! Everything <lb/>
was pleasant. I was in a good neighborhood, for <lb/>
all the dead people that lived near me belonged to <lb/>
the best families in the city. Our posterity appeared <lb/>
to think the world of us. They kept our graves in <lb/>
the very best condition; the fences were always in <lb/>
faultless repair, head-boards were kept painted or <lb/>
whitewashed, and were replaced with new ones as <lb/>
soon as they began to look rusty or decayed; monu- <lb/>
ments were kept upright, railings intact and bright, <lb/>
the rosebushes and shrubbery trimmed, trained, and <lb/>
free from blemish, the walks clean and smooth and <lb/>
graveled. But that day is gone by. Our descend- <lb/>
ants have forgotten us. My grandson lives in a <lb/>
stately house built with money made by these old <lb/>
hands of mine, and I sleep in a neglected grave with <lb/>
invading vermin that gnaw my shroud to build them <lb/>
nests withal! I and friends that lie with me founded <lb/>
and secured the prosperity of this fine city, and the <lb/>
stately bantling of our loves leaves us to rot in a <lb/>
dilapidated cemetery which neighbors curse and <lb/>
strangers scoff at. See the difference between the <lb/>
old time and this&#x2014;for instance: Our graves are all <lb/>
caved in now; our head-boards have rotted away <lb/>
and tumbled down; our railings reel this way and <lb/>
that, with one foot in the air, after a fashion of un- <lb/>
seemly levity; our monuments lean wearily, and our <lb/>
<pb n="256"/>
gravestones bow their heads discouraged; there be <lb/>
no adornments any more&#x2014;no roses, nor shrubs, <lb/>
nor graveled walks, nor anything that is a comfort <lb/>
to the eye; and even the paintless old board fence <lb/>
that did make a show of holding us sacred from com- <lb/>
panionship with beasts and the defilement of heed- <lb/>
less feet, has tottered till it overhangs the street, and <lb/>
only advertises the presence of our dismal resting- <lb/>
place and invites yet more derision to it. And now <lb/>
we cannot hide our poverty and tatters in the <lb/>
friendly woods, for the city has stretched its wither- <lb/>
ing arms abroad and taken us in, and all that re- <lb/>
mains of the cheer of our old home is the cluster of <lb/>
lugubrious forest trees that stand, bored and weary <lb/>
of a city life, with their feet in our coffins, looking <lb/>
into the hazy distance and wishing they were there. <lb/>
I tell you it is disgraceful!</p>
<p>"You begin to comprehend&#x2014;you begin to see <lb/>
how it is. While our descendants are living sumptu- <lb/>
ously on our money, right around us in the city, we <lb/>
have to fight hard to keep skull and bones together. <lb/>
Bless you, there isn't a grave in our cemetery that <lb/>
doesn't leak&#x2014;not one. Every time it rains in the <lb/>
night we have to climb out and roost in the trees&#x2014; <lb/>
and sometimes we are wakened suddenly by the <lb/>
chilly water trickling down the back of our necks. <lb/>
Then I tell you there is a general heaving up of old <lb/>
graves and kicking over of old monuments, and <lb/>
scampering of old skeletons for the trees! Bless <lb/>
me, if you had gone along there some such nights <lb/>
<pb n="257"/>
after twelve you might have seen as many as fifteen <lb/>
of us roosting on one limb, with our joints rattling <lb/>
drearily and the wind wheezing through our ribs! <lb/>
Many a time we have perched there for three or four <lb/>
dreary hours, and then come down, stiff and chilled <lb/>
through and drowsy, and borrowed each other's <lb/>
skulls to bale out our graves with&#x2014;if you will <lb/>
glance up in my mouth now as I tilt my head back, <lb/>
you can see that my head-piece is half full of old <lb/>
dry sediment&#x2014;how top-heavy and stupid it makes <lb/>
me sometimes! Yes, sir, many a time if you had <lb/>
happened to come along just before the dawn you'd <lb/>
have caught us baling out the graves and hanging <lb/>
our shrouds on the fence to dry. Why, I had an <lb/>
elegant shroud stolen from there one morning&#x2014; <lb/>
think a party by the name of Smith took it, that <lb/>
resides in a plebeian graveyard over yonder&#x2014;I <lb/>
think so because the first time I ever saw him he <lb/>
hadn't anything on but a check-shirt, and the last <lb/>
time I saw him, which was at a social gathering in <lb/>
the new cemetery, he was the best dressed corpse in <lb/>
the company&#x2014;and it is a significant fact that he <lb/>
left when he saw me; and presently an old woman <lb/>
from here missed her coffin&#x2014;she generally took it <lb/>
with her when she went anywhere, because she was <lb/>
liable to take cold and bring on the spasmodic rheu- <lb/>
matism that originally killed her if she exposed her- <lb/>
self to the night air much. She was named Hotch- <lb/>
kiss&#x2014;Anna Matilda Hotchkiss&#x2014;you might know <lb/>
her? She has two upper front teeth, is tall, but a <lb/>
<pb n="258"/>
good deal inclined to stoop, one rib on the left side <lb/>
gone, has one shred of rusty hair hanging from the <lb/>
left side of her head, and one little tuft just above <lb/>
and a little forward of her right ear, has her under <lb/>
jaw wired on one side where it had worked loose, <lb/>
small bone of left forearm gone&#x2014;lost in a fight&#x2014; <lb/>
has a kind of swagger in her gait and a 'gallus' way <lb/>
of going with her arms akimbo and her nostrils in <lb/>
the air&#x2014;has been pretty free and easy, and is all <lb/>
damaged and battered up till she looks like a queens- <lb/>
ware crate in ruins&#x2014;maybe you have met her?"</p>
<p>"God forbid!" I involuntarily ejaculated, for <lb/>
somehow I was not looking for that form of ques- <lb/>
tion, and it caught me a little off my guard. But I <lb/>
hastened to make amends for my rudeness, and say, <lb/>
"I simply meant I had not had the honor&#x2014;for I <lb/>
would not deliberately speak discourteously of a <lb/>
friend of yours. You were saying that you were <lb/>
robbed&#x2014;and it was a shame, too&#x2014;but it appears <lb/>
by what is left of the shroud you have on that it was <lb/>
a costly one in its day. How did&#x2014;"</p>
<p>A most ghastly expression began to develop <lb/>
among the decayed features and shriveled integu- <lb/>
ments of my guest's face, and I was beginning to <lb/>
grow uneasy and distressed, when he told me he was <lb/>
only working up a deep, sly smile, with a wink in it, <lb/>
to suggest that about the time he acquired his <lb/>
present garment a ghost in a neighboring cemetery <lb/>
missed one. This reassured me, but I begged him <lb/>
to confine himself to speech thenceforth, because <lb/>
<pb n="259"/>
his facial expression was uncertain. Even with the <lb/>
most elaborate care it was liable to miss fire. <lb/>
Smiling should especially be avoided. What <i>he</i> <lb/>
might honestly consider a shining success was likely <lb/>
to strike me in a very different light. I said I liked <lb/>
to see a skeleton cheerful, even decorously playful, <lb/>
but I did not think smiling was a skeleton's best <lb/>
hold.</p>
<p>"Yes, friend," said the poor skeleton, "the facts <lb/>
are just as I have given them to you. Two of these <lb/>
old graveyards&#x2014;the one that I resided in and one <lb/>
further along&#x2014;have been deliberately neglected by <lb/>
our descendants of to-day until there is no occupy- <lb/>
ing them any longer. Aside from the osteological <lb/>
discomfort of it&#x2014;and that is no light matter this <lb/>
rainy weather&#x2014;the present state of things is ruinous <lb/>
to property. We have got to move or be content to <lb/>
see our effects wasted away and utterly destroyed. <lb/>
Now, you will hardly believe it, but it is true, never- <lb/>
theless, that there isn't a single coffin in good repair <lb/>
among all my acquaintance&#x2014;now that is an abso- <lb/>
lute fact. I do not refer to low people who come in <lb/>
a pine box mounted on an express wagon, but I am <lb/>
talking about your high-toned, silver mounted burial- <lb/>
case, your monumental sort, that travel under black <lb/>
plumes at the head of a procession and have choice <lb/>
of cemetery lots&#x2014;I mean folks like the Jarvises, <lb/>
and the Bledsoes and Burlings, and such. They are <lb/>
all about ruined. The most substantial people in <lb/>
our set, they were. And now look at them&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="260"/>
utterly used up and poverty-stricken. One of the <lb/>
Bledsoes actually traded his monument to a late <lb/>
barkeeper for some fresh shavings to put under his <lb/>
head. I tell you it speaks volumes, for there is <lb/>
nothing a corpse takes so much pride in as his <lb/>
monument. He loves to read the inscription. He <lb/>
comes after awhile to believe what it says himself, <lb/>
and then you may see him sitting on the fence night <lb/>
after night enjoying it. Epitaphs are cheap, and <lb/>
they do a poor chap a world of good after he is <lb/>
dead, especially if he had hard luck while he was <lb/>
alive. I wish they were used more. Now I don't <lb/>
complain, but confidentially I <i>do</i> think it was a little <lb/>
shabby in my descendants to give me nothing but <lb/>
this old slab of a gravestone&#x2014;and all the more that <lb/>
there isn't a compliment on it. It used to have <lb/>
<q><smcap>gone to his just reward'</smcap></q>
on it, and I was proud when I first saw it, but by <lb/>
and by I noticed that whenever an old friend of mine <lb/>
came along he would hook his chin on the railing <lb/>
and pull a long face and read along down till he <lb/>
came to that, and then he would chuckle to himself <lb/>
and walk off, looking satisfied and comfortable. So <lb/>
I scratched it off to get rid of those fools. But a <lb/>
dead man always takes a deal of pride in his monu- <lb/>
ment. Yonder goes half-a-dozen of the Jarvises <lb/>
now, with the family monument along. And Smith- <lb/>
ers and some hired specters went by with his a while <lb/>
ago. Hello, Higgins, good-bye, old friend! That's <lb/>
<pb n="261"/>
Meredith Higgins&#x2014;died in '44&#x2014;belongs to our <lb/>
set in the cemetery&#x2014;fine old family&#x2014;great-grand- <lb/>
mother was an Injun&#x2014;I am on the most familiar <lb/>
terms with him&#x2014;he didn't hear me was the reason <lb/>
he didn't answer me. And I am sorry, too, because <lb/>
I would have liked to introduce you. You would <lb/>
admire him. He is the most disjointed, sway- <lb/>
backed, and generally distorted old skeleton you <lb/>
ever saw, but he is full of fun. When he laughs it <lb/>
sounds like rasping two stones together, and he <lb/>
always starts it off with a cheery screech like raking <lb/>
a nail across a window-pane. Hey, Jones! That <lb/>
is old Columbus Jones&#x2014;shroud cost four hundred <lb/>
dollars&#x2014;entire trousseau, including monument, <lb/>
twenty-seven hundred. This was in the spring of <lb/>
'26. It was enormous style for those days. Dead <lb/>
people came all the way from the Alleghanies to see <lb/>
his things&#x2014;the party that occupied the grave next <lb/>
to mine remembers it well. Now do you see that <lb/>
individual going along with a piece of a head-board <lb/>
under his arm, one leg-bone below his knee gone, <lb/>
and not a thing in the world on? That is Barstow <lb/>
Dalhousie, and next to Columbus Jones he was the <lb/>
most sumptuously outfitted person that ever entered <lb/>
our cemetery. We are all leaving. We cannot <lb/>
tolerate the treatment we are receiving at the hands <lb/>
of our descendants. They open new cemeteries, <lb/>
but they leave us to our ignominy. They mend the <lb/>
streets, but they never mend anything that is about <lb/>
us or belongs to us. Look at that coffin of mine&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="262"/>
yet I tell you in its day it was a piece of furniture <lb/>
that would have attracted attention in any drawing- <lb/>
room in this city. You may have it if you want <lb/>
it&#x2014;I can't afford to repair it. Put a new bottom <lb/>
in her, and part of a new top, and a bit of fresh <lb/>
lining along the left side, and you'll find her about <lb/>
as comfortable as any receptacle of her species you <lb/>
ever tried. No thanks&#x2014;no, don't mention it&#x2014; <lb/>
you have been civil to me, and I would give you all <lb/>
the property I have got before I would seem un- <lb/>
grateful. Now this winding-sheet is a kind of a <lb/>
sweet thing in its way, if you would like to <gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>. <lb/>
No? Well, just as you say, but I wished to be fair <lb/>
and liberal&#x2014;there's nothing mean about <i>me</i>. Good- <lb/>
bye, friend, I must be going. I may have a good <lb/>
way to go to-night&#x2014;don't know. I only know <lb/>
one thing for certain, and that is, that I am on the <lb/>
emigrant trail now, and I'll never sleep in that crazy <lb/>
old cemetery again. I will travel till I find respect- <lb/>
able quarters, if I have to hoof it to New Jersey. <lb/>
All the boys are going. It was decided in public <lb/>
conclave, last night, to emigrate, and by the time <lb/>
the sun rises there won't be a bone left in our old <lb/>
habitations. Such cemeteries may suit my surviving <lb/>
friends, but they do not suit the remains that have <lb/>
the honor to make these remarks. My opinion is <lb/>
the general opinion. If you doubt it, go and see <lb/>
how the departing ghosts upset things before they <lb/>
started. They were almost riotous in their demon- <lb/>
strations of distaste. Hello, here are some of the <lb/>
<pb n="263"/>
Bledsoes, and if you will give me a lift with this <lb/>
tombstone I guess I will join company and jog along <lb/>
with them&#x2014;mighty respectable old family, the <lb/>
Bledsoes, and used to always come out in six-horse <lb/>
hearses, and all that sort of thing fifty years ago <lb/>
when I walked these streets in daylight. Good-bye, <lb/>
friend."</p>
<p>And with his gravestone on his shoulder he joined <lb/>
the grisly procession, dragging his damaged coffin <lb/>
after him, for notwithstanding he pressed it upon <lb/>
me so earnestly, I utterly refused his hospitality. I <lb/>
suppose that for as much as two hours these sad <lb/>
outcasts went clacking by, laden with their dismal <lb/>
effects, and all that time I sat pitying them. One <lb/>
or two of the youngest and least dilapidated among <lb/>
them inquired about midnight trains on the railways, <lb/>
but the rest seemed unacquainted with that mode of <lb/>
travel, and merely asked about common public roads <lb/>
to various towns and cities, some of which are not <lb/>
on the map now, and vanished from it and from the <lb/>
earth as much as thirty years ago, and some few of <lb/>
them never <i>had</i> existed anywhere but on maps, <lb/>
and private ones in real estate agencies at that. And <lb/>
they asked about the condition of the cemeteries in <lb/>
these towns and cities, and about the reputation the <lb/>
citizens bore as to reverence for the dead.</p>
<p>This whole matter interested me deeply, and like- <lb/>
wise compelled my sympathy for these homeless <lb/>
ones. And it all seeming real, and I not knowing <lb/>
it was a dream, I mentioned to one shrouded wan- <lb/>
<pb n="264"/>
derer an idea that had entered my head to publish <lb/>
an account of this curious and very sorrowful <lb/>
exodus, but said also that I could not describe it <lb/>
truthfully, and just as it occurred, without seeming <lb/>
to trifle with a grave subject and exhibit an irrever- <lb/>
ence for the dead that would shock and distress <lb/>
their surviving friends. But this bland and stately <lb/>
remnant of a former citizen leaned him far over my <lb/>
gate and whispered in my ear, and said.</p>
<p>"Do not let that disturb you. The community <lb/>
that can stand such graveyards as those we are emi- <lb/>
grating from can stand anything a body can say <lb/>
about the neglected and forsaken dead that lie in <lb/>
them."</p>
<p>At that very moment a cock crowed, and the <lb/>
weird procession vanished and left not a shred or a <lb/>
bone behind. I awoke, and found myself lying <lb/>
with my head out of the bed and "sagging" down- <lb/>
wards considerably&#x2014;a position favorable to dream- <lb/>
ing dreams with morals in them, maybe, but not <lb/>
poetry.</p>

<smcap>repeated word for word as i heard it</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> was summer time, and twilight. We were sitting <lb/>
on the porch of the farmhouse, on the summit <lb/>
of the hill, and "Aunt Rachel" was sitting respect- <lb/>
fully below our level, on the steps&#x2014;for she was <lb/>
our servant, and colored. She was of mighty frame <lb/>
and stature; she was sixty years old, but her eye <lb/>
was undimmed and her strength unabated. She was <lb/>
a cheerful, hearty soul, and it was no more trouble <lb/>
for her to laugh than it is for a bird to sing. She <lb/>
was under fire now, as usual when the day was done. <lb/>
That is to say, she was being chaffed without mercy, <lb/>
and was enjoying it. She would let off peal after <lb/>
peal of laughter, and then sit with her face in her <lb/>
hands and shake with throes of enjoyment which she <lb/>
could no longer get breath enough to express. At <lb/>
such a moment as this a thought occurred to me, <lb/>
and I said:</p>
<p>"Aunt Rachel, how is it that you've lived sixty <lb/>
years and never had any trouble?"</p>
<p>She stopped quaking. She paused, and there was <lb/>
<pb n="266"/>
a moment of silence. She turned her face over her <lb/>
shoulder toward me, and said, without even a smile <lb/>
in her voice:</p>
<p>"Misto C<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>, is you in 'arnest?"</p>
<p>It surprised me a good deal; and it sobered my <lb/>
manner and my speech, too. I said:</p>
<p>"Why, I thought&#x2014;that is, I meant&#x2014;why, you <lb/>
<i>can't</i> have had any trouble. I've never heard you <lb/>
sigh, and never seen your eye when there wasn't a <lb/>
laugh in it."</p>
<p>She faced fairly around now, and was full of <lb/>
earnestness.</p>
<p>"Has I had any trouble? Misto C<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>, I's <lb/>
gwyne to tell you, den I leave it to you. I was bawn <lb/>
down 'mongst de slaves; I knows all 'bout slavery, <lb/>
'case I ben one of 'em my own se'f. Well, sah, <lb/>
my ole man&#x2014;dat's my husban'&#x2014;he was lovin' <lb/>
an' kind to me, jist as kind as you is to yo' own <lb/>
wife. An' we had chil'en&#x2014;seven chil'en&#x2014;an' <lb/>
we loved dem chil'en jist de same as you loves yo' <lb/>
chil'en. Dey was black, but de Lord can't make no <lb/>
chil'en so black but what dey mother loves 'em an' <lb/>
wouldn't give 'em up, no, not for anything dat's in <lb/>
dis whole world.</p>
<p>"Well, sah, I was raised in ole Fo'ginny, but my <lb/>
mother she was raised in Maryland; an' my <i>souls!</i> <lb/>
she was turrible when she'd git started! My <i>lan'!</i> <lb/>
but she'd make de fur fly! When she'd git into <lb/>
dem tantrums, she always had one word dat she <lb/>
said. She'd straighten herse'f up an' put her fists <lb/>
<pb n="267"/>
in her hips an' say, 'I want you to understan' dat I <lb/>
wa'nt bawn in the mash to be fool' by trash! I's <lb/>
one o' de ole Blue Hen's Chickens, <i>I</i> is!' 'Ca'se, <lb/>
you see, dat's what folks dat's bawn in Maryland <lb/>
calls deyselves, an' dey's proud of it. Well, dat <lb/>
was her word. I don't ever forgit it, beca'se she <lb/>
said it so much, an' beca'se she said it one day <lb/>
when my little Henry tore his wris' awful, and most <lb/>
busted his head, right up at de top of his forehead, <lb/>
an' de niggers didn't fly aroun' fas' enough to 'tend <lb/>
to him. An' when dey talk' back at her, she up <lb/>
an' she says, 'Look-a-heah!' she says, 'I want you <lb/>
niggers to understan' dat I wa'nt bawn in de mash <lb/>
to be fool' by trash! I's one o' de ole Blue Hen's <lb/>
Chickens, <i>I</i> is!' an' den she clar' dat kitchen an' <lb/>
bandage' up de chile herse'f. So I says dat word, <lb/>
too, when I's riled.</p>
<p>"Well, bymeby my ole mistis say she's broke, <lb/>
an' she got to sell all de niggers on de place. <lb/>
An' when I heah dat dey gwyne to sell us all off at <lb/>
oction in Richmon', oh, de good gracious! I know <lb/>
what dat mean!"</p>
<p>Aunt Rachel had gradually risen, while she <lb/>
warmed to her subject, and now she towered above <lb/>
us, black against the stars.</p>
<p>"Dey put chains on us an' put us on a stan' as <lb/>
high as dis po'ch&#x2014;twenty foot high&#x2014;an' all de <lb/>
people stood aroun', crowds an' crowds. An' dey'd <lb/>
come up <foreign lang="ger">dah</foreign> an' look at us all roun', an' squeeze <lb/>
our arm, an' make us git up an' walk, an' den say, <lb/>
<pb n="268"/>
'Dis one too ole,' or 'Dis one lame,' or 'Dis one <lb/>
don't 'mount to much.' An' dey sole my ole man, <lb/>
an' took him away, an' dey begin to sell my chil'en <lb/>
an' take <i>dem</i> away, an' I begin to cry; an' de man <lb/>
say, 'Shet up yo' dam blubberin',' an' hit me on <lb/>
de mouf wid his han'. An' when de las' one was <lb/>
gone but my little Henry, I grab' <i>him</i> clost up to <lb/>
my breas' so, an' I ris up an' says, 'You shan't <lb/>
take him away,' I says; 'I'll kill de man dat tetches <lb/>
him!' I says. But my little Henry whisper an' say, <lb/>
'I gwyne to run away, an' den I work an' buy yo' <lb/>
freedom.' Oh, bless de chile, he always so good! <lb/>
But dey got him&#x2014;dey got him, de men did; but I <lb/>
took and tear de clo'es mos' off of 'em an' beat 'em <lb/>
over de head wid my chain; an' <i>dey</i> give it to <i>me</i>, <lb/>
too, but I didn't mine dat.</p>
<p>"Well, <foreign lang="ger">dah</foreign> was my ole man gone, an' all my <lb/>
chil'en, all my seven chil'en&#x2014;an' six of 'em I <lb/>
hain't set eyes on ag'in to dis day, an' dat's twenty- <lb/>
two year ago las' Easter. De man dat bought me <lb/>
b'long' in Newbern, an' he took me dah. Well, <lb/>
bymeby de years roll on an' de waw come. My <lb/>
marster he was a Confedrit colonel, an' I was his <lb/>
family's cook. So when de Unions took dat town, <lb/>
dey all run away an' lef' me all by myse'f wid de <lb/>
other niggers in dat mons'us big house. So de big <lb/>
Union officers move in dah, an' dey ask me would I <lb/>
cook for <i>dem</i>. 'Lord bless you,' says I, 'dat's <lb/>
what I's <i>for</i>.'</p>
<p>"Dey wa'nt no small-fry officers, mine you, dey <lb/>
<pb n="269"/>
was de biggest dey <i>is;</i> an' de way dey made dem <lb/>
sojers mosey roun'! De Gen'l he tole me to boss <lb/>
dat kitchen; an' he say, 'If anybody come meddlin' <lb/>
wid you, you jist make 'em walk chalk; don't you <lb/>
be afeared,' he say; 'you's 'mong frens now.'</p>
<p>"Well, I thinks to myse'f, if my little Henry <lb/>
ever got a chance to run away, he'd make to de <lb/>
Norf, o' course. So one day I comes in <foreign lang="ger">dah</foreign> whar <lb/>
de big officers was, in de parlor, an' I drops a <lb/>
kurtchy, so, an' I up an' tole 'em 'bout my Henry, <lb/>
dey a-listenin' to my troubles jist de same as if I <lb/>
was white folks; an' I says, 'What I come for is <lb/>
beca'se if he got away and got up Norf whar you <lb/>
gemmen comes from, you might 'a' seen him, <lb/>
maybe, an' could tell me so as I could fine him <lb/>
ag'in; he was very little, an' he had a sk-yar on his <lb/>
lef' wris' an' at de top of his forehead.' Den dey <lb/>
look mournful, an' de Gen'l says, 'How long sence <lb/>
you los' him?' an' I say, 'Thirteen year.' Den de <lb/>
Gen'l say, 'He wouldn't be little no mo' now&#x2014;he's <lb/>
a man!'</p>
<p>"I never thought o' dat befo'! He was only <lb/>
dat little feller to <i>me</i> yit. I never thought 'bout <lb/>
him growin' up an' bein' big. But I see it den. <lb/>
None o' de gemmen had run acrost him, so dey <lb/>
couldn't do nothin' for me. But all dat time, do' <i>I</i> <lb/>
didn't know it, my Henry <i>was</i> run off to de Norf, <lb/>
years an' years, an' he was a barber, too, an' <lb/>
worked for hisse'f. An' bymeby, when de waw <lb/>
come he ups an' he says: 'I's done barberin',' he <lb/>
<pb n="270"/>
says, 'I's gwyne to fine my ole mammy, less'n she's <lb/>
dead.' So he sole out an' went to whar dey was <lb/>
recruitin', an' hired hisse'f out to de colonel for his <lb/>
servant; an' den he went all froo de battles every- <lb/>
whah, huntin' for his ole mammy; yes, indeedy, <lb/>
he'd hire to fust one officer an' den another, tell <lb/>
he'd ransacked de whole Souf; but you see <i>I</i> didn't <lb/>
know nuffin 'bout <i>dis</i>. How was <i>I</i> gwyne to know <lb/>
it?</p>
<p>"Well, one night we had a big sojer ball; de <lb/>
sojers <foreign lang="ger">dah</foreign> at Newbern was always havin' balls an' <lb/>
carryin' on. Dey had 'em in my kitchen, heaps o' <lb/>
times, 'ca'se it was so big. Mine you, I was <i>down</i> <lb/>
on sich doin's; beca'se my place was wid de officers, <lb/>
an' it rasp me to have dem common sojers cavortin' <lb/>

<p>"Well, one night&#x2014;it was a Friday night&#x2014;dey <lb/>

<head><b>THE SIAMESE TWINS</b><ref target="n31">*</ref><note id="n31" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1868.</p></note></head>
<p><smcap>I do</smcap> not wish to write of the personal <i>habits</i> of <lb/>
these strange creatures solely, but also of certain <lb/>
curious details of various kinds concerning them, <lb/>
which, belonging only to their private life, have never <lb/>
crept into print. Knowing the Twins intimately, I <lb/>
feel that I am peculiarly well qualified for the task <lb/>
I have taken upon myself.</p>
<p>The Siamese Twins are naturally tender and affec- <lb/>
tionate in disposition, and have clung to each other <lb/>
with singular fidelity throughout a long and eventful <lb/>
life. Even as children they were inseparable com- <lb/>
panions; and it was noticed that they always seemed <lb/>
to prefer each other's society to that of any other <lb/>
persons. They nearly always played together; and, <lb/>
so accustomed was their mother to this peculiarity, <lb/>
that, whenever both of them chanced to be lost, she <lb/>
usually only hunted for one of them&#x2014;satisfied that <lb/>
when she found that one she would find his brother <lb/>
somewhere in the immediate neighborhood. And <lb/>
yet these creatures were ignorant and unlettered&#x2014; <lb/>
barbarians themselves and the offspring of barba- <lb/>
<pb n="274"/>
rians, who knew not the light of philosophy and <lb/>
science. What a withering rebuke is this to our <lb/>
boasted civilization, with its quarrelings, its wrang- <lb/>
lings, and its separations of brothers!</p>
<p>As men, the Twins have not always lived in per- <lb/>
fect accord; but still there has always been a bond <lb/>
between them which made them unwilling to go <lb/>
away from each other and dwell apart. They have <lb/>
even occupied the same house, as a general thing, <lb/>
and it is believed that they have never failed to even <lb/>
sleep together on any night since they were born. <lb/>
How surely do the habits of a lifetime become <lb/>
second nature to us! The Twins always go to bed <lb/>
at the same time; but Chang usually gets up about <lb/>
an hour before his brother. By an understanding <lb/>
between themselves, Chang does all the indoor work <lb/>
and Eng runs all the errands. This is because Eng <lb/>
likes to go out; Chang's habits are sedentary. <lb/>
However, Chang always goes along. Eng is a <lb/>
Baptist, but Chang is a Roman Catholic; still, to <lb/>
please his brother, Chang consented to be baptized <lb/>
at the same time that Eng was, on condition that it <lb/>
should not "count." During the war they were <lb/>
strong partizans, and both fought gallantly all <lb/>
through the great struggle&#x2014;Eng on the Union <lb/>
side and Chang on the Confederate. They took <lb/>
each other prisoners at Seven Oaks, but the proofs <lb/>
of capture were so evenly balanced in favor of each, <lb/>
that a general army court had to be assembled to <lb/>
determine which one was properly the captor, and <lb/>
<pb n="275"/>
which the captive. The jury was unable to agree <lb/>
for a long time; but the vexed question was finally <lb/>
decided by agreeing to consider them both prisoners, <lb/>
and then exchanging them. At one time Chang <lb/>
was convicted of disobedience of orders, and sen- <lb/>
tenced to ten days in the guardhouse, but Eng, in <lb/>
spite of all arguments, felt obliged to share his im- <lb/>
prisonment, notwithstanding he himself was entirely <lb/>
innocent; and so, to save the blameless brother from <lb/>
suffering, they had to discharge both from custody <lb/>
&#x2014;the just reward of faithfulness.</p>
<p>Upon one occasion the brothers fell out about <lb/>
something, and Chang knocked Eng down, and then <lb/>
tripped and fell on him, whereupon both clinched <lb/>
and began to beat and gouge each other without <lb/>
mercy. The bystanders interfered, and tried to <lb/>
separate them, but they could not do it, and so <lb/>
allowed them to fight it out. In the end both were <lb/>
disabled, and were carried to the hospital on one and <lb/>
the same shutter.</p>
<p>Their ancient habit of going always together had <lb/>
its drawbacks when they reached man's estate, and <lb/>
entered upon the luxury of courting. Both fell in <lb/>
love with the same girl. Each tried to steal clandes- <lb/>
tine interviews with her, but at the critical moment <lb/>
the other would always turn up. By and by Eng <lb/>
saw, with distraction, that Chang had won the girl's <lb/>
affections; and, from that day forth, he had to bear <lb/>
with the agony of being a witness to all their dainty <lb/>
billing and cooing. But with a magnanimity that <lb/>
<pb n="276"/>
did him infinite credit, he succumbed to his fate, <lb/>
and gave countenance and encouragement to a state <lb/>
of things that bade fair to sunder his generous <lb/>
heart-strings. He sat from seven every evening <lb/>
until two in the morning, listening to the fond fool- <lb/>
ishness of the two lovers, and to the concussion of <lb/>
hundreds of squandered kisses&#x2014;for the privilege of <lb/>
sharing only one of which he would have given his <lb/>
right hand. But he sat patiently, and waited, and <lb/>
gaped, and yawned, and stretched, and longed for <lb/>
two o'clock to come. And he took long walks <lb/>
with the lovers on moonlight evenings&#x2014;sometimes <lb/>
traversing ten miles, notwithstanding he was usually <lb/>
suffering from rheumatism. He is an inveterate <lb/>
smoker; but he could not smoke on these occasions, <lb/>
because the young lady was painfully sensitive to <lb/>
the smell of tobacco. Eng cordially wanted them <lb/>
married, and done with it; but although Chang <lb/>
often asked the momentous question, the young <lb/>
lady could not gather sufficient courage to answer it <lb/>
while Eng was by. However, on one occasion, <lb/>
after having walked some sixteen miles, and sat up <lb/>
till nearly daylight, Eng dropped asleep, from sheer <lb/>
exhaustion, and then the question was asked and <lb/>
answered. The lovers were married. All acquainted <lb/>
with the circumstance applauded the noble brother- <lb/>
in-law. His unwavering faithfulness was the theme <lb/>
of every tongue. He had stayed by them all through <lb/>
their long and arduous courtship; and when at last <lb/>
they were married, he lifted his hands above their <lb/>
<pb n="277"/>
heads, and said with impressive unction, "Bless ye, <lb/>
my children, I will never desert ye!" and he kept <lb/>
his word. Fidelity like this is all too rare in this <lb/>
cold world.</p>
<p>By and by Eng fell in love with his sister-in-law's <lb/>
sister, and married her, and since that day they have <lb/>
all lived together, night and day, in an exceeding <lb/>
sociability which is touching and beautiful to behold, <lb/>
and is a scathing rebuke to our boasted civil- <lb/>
ization.</p>
<p>The sympathy existing between these two brothers <lb/>
is so close and so refined that the feelings, the im- <lb/>
pulses, the emotions of the one are instantly experi- <lb/>
enced by the other. When one is sick, the other is <lb/>
sick; when one feels pain, the other feels it; when <lb/>
one is angered, the other's temper takes fire. We <lb/>
have already seen with what happy facility they <lb/>
both fell in love with the same girl. Now Chang is <lb/>
bitterly opposed to all forms of intemperance, on <lb/>
principle; but Eng is the reverse&#x2014;for, while these <lb/>
men's feelings and emotions are so closely wedded, <lb/>
their reasoning faculties are unfettered; their <i>thoughts</i> <lb/>
are free. Chang belongs to the Good Templars, and <lb/>
is a hard working, enthusiastic supporter of all <lb/>
temperance reforms. But, to his bitter distress, <lb/>
every now and then Eng gets drunk, and, of course, <lb/>
that makes Chang drunk too. This unfortunate <lb/>
thing has been a great sorrow to Chang, for it <lb/>
almost destroys his usefulness in his favorite field of <lb/>
effort. As sure as he is to head a great temperance <lb/>
<pb n="278"/>
procession Eng ranges up alongside of him, prompt <lb/>
to the minute, and drunk as a lord; but yet no more <lb/>
dismally and hopelessly drunk than his brother, who <lb/>
has not tasted a drop. And so the two begin to <lb/>
hoot and yell, and throw mud and bricks at the <lb/>
Good Templars; and, of course, they break up the <lb/>
procession. It would be manifestly wrong to punish <lb/>
Chang for what Eng does, and, therefore, the Good <lb/>
Templars accept the untoward situation, and suffer <lb/>
in silence and sorrow. They have officially and <lb/>
deliberately examined into the matter, and find <lb/>
Chang blameless. They have taken the two brothers <lb/>
and filled Chang full of warm water and sugar and <lb/>
Eng full of whisky, and in twenty-five minutes it was <lb/>
not possible to tell which was the drunkest. Both <lb/>
were as drunk as loons&#x2014;and on hot whisky <lb/>
punches, by the smell of their breath. Yet all the <lb/>
while Chang's moral principles were unsullied, his <lb/>
conscience clear; and so all just men were forced to <lb/>
confess that he was not morally, but only physically, <lb/>
drunk. By every right and by every moral evidence <lb/>
the man was strictly sober; and, therefore, it caused <lb/>
his friends all the more anguish to see him shake <lb/>

<head><b>SPEECH AT THE SCOTTISH BANQUET <lb/>
IN LONDON</b><ref target="n32">*</ref><note id="n32" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1872.</p></note></head>
<p><smcap>At</smcap> the anniversary festival of the Scottish Cor- <lb/>
poration of London on Monday evening, in <lb/>
response to the toast of "The Ladies," <smcap>Mark <lb/>
Twain</smcap> replied. The following is his speech as re- <lb/>
ported in the London <i>Observer:</i> <lb/>
<q>"I am proud, indeed, of the distinction of being chosen to respond <lb/>
to this especial toast, to 'The Ladies,' or to women if you please, for <lb/>
that is the preferable term, perhaps; it is certainly the older, and <lb/>
therefore the more entitled to reverence. [Laughter.] I have noticed <lb/>
that the Bible, with that plain, blunt honesty which is such a con- <lb/>
spicuous characteristic of the Scriptures, is always particular to never <lb/>
refer to even the illustrious mother of all mankind herself as a 'lady,' <lb/>
but speaks of her as a woman. [Laughter.] It is odd, but you will find <lb/>
it is so. I am peculiarly proud of this honor, because I think that the <lb/>
toast to women is one which, by right and by every rule of gallantry, <lb/>
should take precedence of all others&#x2014;of the army, of the navy, of even <lb/>
royalty itself&#x2014;perhaps, though the latter is not necessary in this day <lb/>
and in this land, for the reason that, tacitly, you do drink a broad general <lb/>
health to all good women when you drink the health of the Queen of <lb/>
England and the Princess of Wales. [Loud cheers.] I have in mind <lb/>
a poem just now which is familiar to you all, familiar to everybody. <lb/>
And what an inspiration that was (and how instantly the present toast <lb/>
recalls the verses to all our minds) when the most noble, the most <lb/>
gracious, the purest, and sweetest of all poets says:&#x2014;</q>
<pb n="281"/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"'Woman! O woman!<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>er<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/></l>
<l>Wom<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>'</l>
</lg></q>
<q>[Laughter.] However, you remember the lines; and you remember <lb/>
how feelingly, how daintily, how almost imperceptibly the verses raise up <lb/>
before you, feature by feature, the ideal of a true and perfect woman; <lb/>
and how, as you contemplate the finished marvel, your homage grows <lb/>
into worship of the intellect that could create so fair a thing out of mere <lb/>
breath, mere words. And you call to mind now, as I speak, how the <lb/>
poet, with stern fidelity to the history of all humanity, delivers this <lb/>
beautiful child of his heart and his brain over to the trials and sorrows <lb/>
that must come to all, sooner or later, that abide in the earth, and how <lb/>
the pathetic story culminates in that apostrophe&#x2014;so wild, so regretful, <lb/>
so full of mournful retrospection. The lines run thus:&#x2014;</q>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"'Alas!&#x2014;alas!&#x2014;a&#x2014;alas!</l>
<l><gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>Alas! <gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> alas!'</l>
</lg></q>
<q>&#x2014;and so on. [Laughter.] I do not remember the rest; but, taken <lb/>
together, it seems to me that poem is the noblest tribute to woman <lb/>
that human genius has ever brought forth&#x2014;[laughter]&#x2014;and I feel <lb/>
that if I were to talk hours I could not do my great theme completer or <lb/>
more graceful justice than I have now done in simply quoting that poet's <lb/>
matchless words. [Renewed laughter.] The phases of the womanly <lb/>
nature are infinite in their variety. Take any type of woman, and you <lb/>
shall find in it something to respect, something to admire, something to <lb/>
love. And you shall find the whole joining you heart and hand. Who <lb/>
was more patriotic than Joan of Arc? Who was braver? Who has <lb/>
given us a grander instance of self-sacrificing devotion? Ah! you <lb/>
remember, you remember well, what a throb of pain, what a great tidal <lb/>
wave of grief swept over us all when Joan of Arc fell at Waterloo. [Much <lb/>
laughter.] Who does not sorrow for the loss of Sappho, the sweet <lb/>
singer of Israel? [Laughter.] Who among us does not miss the <lb/>
gentle ministrations, the softening influences, the humble piety of <lb/>
Lucretia Borgia? [Laughter.] Who can join in the heartless libel <lb/>
that says woman is extravagant in dress when he can look back and call <lb/>
to mind our simple and lowly mother Eve arrayed in her modification of <lb/>
the Highland costume. [Roars of laughter.] Sir, women have been <lb/>
soldiers, women have been painters, women have been poets. As long <lb/>
as language lives the name of Cleopatra will live. And, not because she <lb/>
<pb n="282"/>
conquered George III&#x2014;[laughter]&#x2014;but because she wrote those <lb/>
divine lines:&#x2014;</q>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"'Let dogs delight to bark and bite,</l>
<l>For God hath made them so.'</l>
</lg></q>
<q>[More laughter.] The story of the world is adorned with the names of <lb/>
illustrious ones of our own sex&#x2014;some of them sons of St. Andrew, too <lb/>
&#x2014;Scott, Bruce, Burns, the warrior Wallace, Ben Nevis&#x2014;[laughter]&#x2014; <lb/>
the gifted Ben Lomond, and the great new Scotchman, Ben Disraeli.<ref target="n33">*</ref><note id="n33" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Mr. Benjamin Disraeli, at that time Prime Minister of England, <lb/>
had just been elected Lord Rector of Glasgow University, and had made <lb/>
a speech which gave rise to a world of discussion.</p></note> <lb/>
[Great laughter.] Out of the great plains of history tower whole <lb/>
mountain ranges of sublime women&#x2014;the Queen of Sheba, Josephine, <lb/>
Semiramis, Sairey Gamp; the list is endless&#x2014;[laughter]&#x2014;but I will <lb/>
not call the mighty roll, the names rise up in your own memories at the <lb/>
mere suggestion, luminous with the glory of deeds that cannot die, <lb/>
hallowed by the loving worship of the good and the true of all epochs <lb/>
and all climes. [Cheers.] Suffice it for our pride and our honor that <lb/>
we in our day have added to it such names as those of Grace Darling <lb/>
and Florence Nightingale. [Cheers.] Woman is all that she should <lb/>
be&#x2014;gentle, patient, long suffering, trustful, unselfish, full of generous <lb/>
impulses. It is her blessed mission to comfort the sorrowing, plead for <lb/>
the erring, encourage the faint of purpose, succor the distressed, uplift <lb/>
the fallen, befriend the friendless&#x2014;in a word, afford the healing of her <lb/>
sympathies and a home in her heart for all the bruised and persecuted <lb/>
children of misfortune that knock at its hospitable door. [Cheers.] <lb/>
And when I say, God bless her, there is none among us who has known <lb/>
the ennobling affection of a wife, or the steadfast devotion of a mother <lb/>
but in his heart will say, Amen! [Loud and prolonged cheering.]</q></p>

<head><b>A GHOST STORY</b></head>
<p><smcap>I took</smcap> a large room, far up Broadway, in a huge <lb/>
old building whose upper stories had been <lb/>
wholly unoccupied for years, until I came. The <lb/>
place had long been given up to dust and cobwebs, <lb/>
to solitude and silence. I seemed groping among <lb/>
the tombs and invading the privacy of the dead, that <lb/>
first night I climbed up to my quarters. For the <lb/>
first time in my life a superstitious dread came over <lb/>
me; and as I turned a dark angle of the stairway <lb/>
and an invisible cobweb swung its slazy woof in my <lb/>
face and clung there, I shuddered as one who had <lb/>
encountered a phantom.</p>
<p>I was glad enough when I reached my room and <lb/>
locked out the mould and the darkness. A cheery <lb/>
fire was burning in the grate, and I sat down before <lb/>
it with a comforting sense of relief. For two hours <lb/>
I sat there, thinking of bygone times; recalling old <lb/>
scenes, and summoning half-forgotten faces out of <lb/>
the mists of the past; listening, in fancy, to voices <lb/>
that long ago grew silent for all time, and to once <lb/>
familiar songs that nobody sings now. And as my <lb/>
reverie softened down to a sadder and sadder pathos, <lb/>
the shrieking of the winds outside softened to a wail, <lb/>
<pb n="284"/>
the angry beating of the rain against the panes <lb/>
diminished to a tranquil patter, and one by one the <lb/>
noises in the street subsided, until the hurrying foot- <lb/>
steps of the last belated straggler died away in the <lb/>
distance and left no sound behind.</p>
<p>The fire had burned low. A sense of loneliness <lb/>
crept over me. I arose and undressed, moving on <lb/>
tiptoe about the room, doing stealthily what I had <lb/>
to do, as if I were environed by sleeping enemies <lb/>
whose slumbers it would be fatal to break. I <lb/>
covered up in bed, and lay listening to the rain and <lb/>
wind and the faint creaking of distant shutters, till <lb/>
they lulled me to sleep.</p>
<p>I slept profoundly, but how long I do not know. <lb/>
All at once I found myself awake, and filled with a <lb/>
shuddering expectancy. All was still. All but my <lb/>
own heart&#x2014;I could hear it beat. Presently the bed- <lb/>
clothes began to slip away slowly toward the foot of <lb/>
the bed, as if some one were pulling them! I could <lb/>
not stir; I could not speak. Still the blankets <lb/>
slipped deliberately away, till my breast was un- <lb/>
covered. Then with a great effort I seized them and <lb/>
drew them over my head. I waited, listened, waited. <lb/>
Once more that steady pull began, and once more I <lb/>
lay torpid a century of dragging seconds till my <lb/>
breast was naked again. At last I roused my ener- <lb/>
gies and snatched the covers back to their place and <lb/>
held them with a strong grip. I waited. By and <lb/>
by I felt a faint tug, and took a fresh grip. The <lb/>
tug strengthened to a steady strain&#x2014;it grew <lb/>
<pb n="285"/>
stronger and stronger. My hold parted, and for <lb/>
the third time the blankets slid away. I groaned. <lb/>
An answering groan came from the foot of the bed! <lb/>
Beaded drops of sweat stood upon my forehead. I <lb/>
was more dead than alive. Presently I heard a <lb/>
heavy footstep in my room&#x2014;the step of an ele- <lb/>
phant, it seemed to me&#x2014;it was not like anything <lb/>
human. But it was moving <i>from</i> me&#x2014;there was <lb/>
relief in that. I heard it approach the door&#x2014;pass <lb/>
out without moving bolt or lock&#x2014;and wander away <lb/>
among the dismal corridors, straining the floors and <lb/>
joists till they creaked again as it passed&#x2014;and then <lb/>
silence reigned once more.</p>
<p>When my excitement had calmed, I said to my- <lb/>
self, "This is a dream&#x2014;simply a hideous dream." <lb/>
And so I lay thinking it over until I convinced <lb/>
myself that it <i>was</i> a dream, and then a comforting <lb/>
laugh relaxed my lips and I was happy again. I <lb/>
got up and struck a light; and when I found that <lb/>
the locks and bolts were just as I had left them, <lb/>
another soothing laugh welled in my heart and rip- <lb/>
pled from my lips. I took my pipe and lit it, and <lb/>
was just sitting down before the fire, when&#x2014;down <lb/>
went the pipe out of my nerveless fingers, the blood <lb/>
forsook my cheeks, and my placid breathing was cut <lb/>
short with a gasp! In the ashes on the hearth, side <lb/>
by side with my own bare footprint, was another, so <lb/>
vast that in comparison mine was but an infant's! <lb/>
Then I had <i>had</i> a visitor, and the elephant tread was <lb/>
explained.</p>
<pb n="286"/>
<p>I put out the light and returned to bed, palsied <lb/>
with fear. I lay a long time, peering into the dark- <lb/>
ness, and listening. Then I heard a grating noise <lb/>
overhead, like the dragging of a heavy body across <lb/>
the floor; then the throwing down of the body, and <lb/>
the shaking of my windows in response to the con- <lb/>
cussion. In distant parts of the building I heard <lb/>
the muffled slamming of doors. I heard, at inter- <lb/>
vals, stealthy footsteps creeping in and out among <lb/>
the corridors, and up and down the stairs. Some- <lb/>
times these noises approached my door, hesitated, <lb/>
and went away again. I heard the clanking of <lb/>
chains faintly, in remote passages, and listened while <lb/>
the clanking grew nearer&#x2014;while it wearily climbed <lb/>
the stairways, marking each move by the loose <lb/>
surplus of chain that fell with an accented rattle upon <lb/>
each succeeding step as the goblin that bore it ad- <lb/>
vanced. I heard muttered sentences; half-uttered <lb/>
screams that seemed smothered violently; and the <lb/>
swish of invisible garments, the rush of invisible <lb/>
wings. Then I became conscious that my chamber <lb/>
was invaded&#x2014;that I was not alone. I heard sighs <lb/>
and breathings about my bed, and mysterious whis- <lb/>
perings. Three little spheres of soft phosphorescent <lb/>
light appeared on the ceiling directly over my head, <lb/>
clung and glowed there a moment, and then dropped <lb/>
&#x2014;two of them upon my face and one upon the <lb/>
pillow. They spattered, liquidly, and felt warm. <lb/>
Intuition told me they had turned to gouts of blood <lb/>
as they fell&#x2014;I needed no light to satisfy myself of <lb/>
<pb n="287"/>
that. Then I saw pallid faces, dimly luminous, and <lb/>
white uplifted hands, floating bodiless in the air&#x2014; <lb/>
floating a moment and then disappearing. The <lb/>
whispering ceased, and the voices and the sounds, <lb/>
and a solemn stillness followed. I waited and <lb/>
listened. I felt that I must have light or die. I <lb/>
was weak with fear. I slowly raised myself toward <lb/>
a sitting posture, and my face came in contact with <lb/>
a clammy hand! All strength went from me ap- <lb/>
parently, and I fell back like a stricken invalid. <lb/>
Then I heard the rustle of a garment&#x2014;it seemed to <lb/>
pass to the door and go out.</p>
<p>When everything was still once more, I crept out <lb/>
of bed, sick and feeble, and lit the gas with a hand <lb/>
that trembled as if it were aged with a hundred <lb/>
years. The light brought some little cheer to my <lb/>
spirits. I sat down and fell into a dreamy contem- <lb/>
plation of that great footprint in the ashes. By and <lb/>
by its outlines began to waver and grow dim. I <lb/>
glanced up and the broad gas flame was slowly wilt- <lb/>
ing away. In the same moment I heard that ele- <lb/>
phantine tread again. I noted its approach, nearer <lb/>
and nearer, along the musty halls, and dimmer and <lb/>
dimmer the light waned. The tread reached my <lb/>
very door and paused&#x2014;the light had dwindled to a <lb/>
sickly blue, and all things about me lay in a spectral <lb/>
twilight. The door did not open, and yet I felt a <lb/>
faint gust of air fan my cheek, and presently was <lb/>
conscious of a huge, cloudy presence before me. I <lb/>
watched it with fascinated eyes. A pale glow stole <lb/>
<pb n="288"/>
over the Thing; gradually its cloudy folds took <lb/>
shape&#x2014;an arm appeared, then legs, then a body, <lb/>
and last a great sad face looked out of the vapor. <lb/>
Stripped of its filmy housings, naked, muscular and <lb/>
comely, the majestic Cardiff Giant loomed above me!</p>
<p>All my misery vanished&#x2014;for a child might know <lb/>
that no harm could come with that benignant <lb/>
countenance. My cheerful spirits returned at once, <lb/>
and in sympathy with them the gas flamed up <lb/>
brightly again. Never a lonely outcast was so glad <lb/>
to welcome company as I was to greet the friendly <lb/>
giant. I said:</p>
<p>"Why, is it nobody but you? Do you know, I <lb/>
have been scared to death for the last two or three <lb/>
hours? I am most honestly glad to see you. I <lb/>
wish I had a chair&#x2014; Here, here, don't try to sit <lb/>
down in that thing!</p>
<p>But it was too late. He was in it before I could <lb/>
stop him, and down he went&#x2014;I never saw a chair <lb/>
shivered so in my life.</p>
<p>"Stop, stop, you'll ruin ev&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Too late again. There was another crash, and <lb/>
another chair was resolved into its original elements.</p>
<p>"Confound it, haven't you got any judgment at <lb/>
all? Do you want to ruin all the furniture on the <lb/>
place? Here, here, you petrified fool&#x2014;"</p>
<p>But it was no use. Before I could arrest him he <lb/>
had sat down on the bed, and it was a melancholy <lb/>
ruin.</p>
<p>"Now what sort of a way is that to do? First <lb/>
<pb n="289"/>
you come lumbering about the place bringing a <lb/>
legion of vagabond goblins along with you to worry <lb/>
me to death, and then when I overlook an indelicacy <lb/>
of costume which would not be tolerated anywhere <lb/>
by cultivated people except in a respectable theater, <lb/>
and not even there if the nudity were of <i>your</i> sex, <lb/>
you repay me by wrecking all the furniture you can <lb/>
find to sit down on. And why will you? You <lb/>
damage yourself as much as you do me. You have <lb/>
broken off the end of your spinal column, and lit- <lb/>
tered up the floor with chips of your hams till the <lb/>
place looks like a marble yard. You ought to be <lb/>
ashamed of yourself&#x2014;you are big enough to know <lb/>
better."</p>
<p>"Well, I will not break any more furniture. But <lb/>
what am I to do? I have not had a chance to sit <lb/>
down for a century." And the tears came into his <lb/>
eyes.</p>
<p>"Poor devil," I said, "I should not have been so <lb/>
harsh with you. And you are an orphan, too, no <lb/>
doubt. But sit down on the floor here&#x2014;nothing <lb/>
else can stand your weight&#x2014;and besides, we cannot <lb/>
be sociable with you away up there above me; I <lb/>
want you down where I can perch on this high <lb/>
counting-house stool and gossip with you face to <lb/>
face."</p>
<p>So he sat down on the floor, and lit a pipe which <lb/>
I gave him, threw one of my red blankets over his <lb/>
shoulders, inverted my sitz-bath on his head, helmet <lb/>
fashion, and made himself picturesque and comfort- <lb/>
<pb n="290"/>
able. Then he crossed his ankles, while I renewed <lb/>
the fire, and exposed the flat, honey-combed bot- <lb/>
toms of his prodigious feet to the grateful warmth.</p>
<p>"What is the matter with the bottom of your feet <lb/>
and the back of your legs, that they are gouged up <lb/>
so?"</p>
<p>"Infernal chillblains&#x2014;I caught them clear up to <lb/>
the back of my head, roosting out there under <lb/>
Newell's farm. But I love the place; I love it as <lb/>
one loves his old home. There is no peace for me <lb/>
like the peace I feel when I am there."</p>
<p>We talked along for half an hour, and then I <lb/>
noticed that he looked tired, and spoke of it.</p>
<p>"Tired?" he said. "Well, I should think so. <lb/>
And now I will tell you all about it, since you have <lb/>
treated me so well. I am the spirit of the Petrified <lb/>
Man that lies across the street there in the Museum. <lb/>
I am the ghost of the Cardiff Giant. I can have no <lb/>
rest, no peace, till they have given that poor body <lb/>
burial again. Now what was the most natural thing <lb/>
for me to do, to make men satisfy this wish? <lb/>
Terrify them into it!&#x2014;haunt the place where the <lb/>
body lay! So I haunted the museum night after <lb/>
night. I even got other spirits to help me. But it <lb/>
did no good, for nobody ever came to the museum <lb/>
at midnight. Then it occurred to me to come over <lb/>
the way and haunt this place a little. I felt that if I <lb/>
ever got a hearing I must succeed, for I had the <lb/>
most efficient company that perdition could furnish. <lb/>
Night after night we have shivered around through <lb/>
<pb n="291"/>
these mildewed halls, dragging chains, groaning, <lb/>
whispering, tramping up and down stairs, till, to tell <lb/>
you the truth, I am almost worn out. But when I <lb/>
saw a light in your room to-night I roused my <lb/>
energies again and went at it with a deal of the old <lb/>
freshness. But I am tired out&#x2014;entirely fagged <lb/>
out. Give me, I beseech you, give me some hope!"</p>
<p>I lit off my perch in a burst of excitement, and <lb/>
exclaimed:</p>
<p>"This transcends everything! everything that <lb/>
ever did occur! Why you poor blundering old <lb/>
fossil, you have had all your trouble for nothing <lb/>
&#x2014;you have been haunting a <i>plaster cast</i> of your- <lb/>
self&#x2014;the real Cardiff Giant is in Albany!<ref target="n34">*</ref><note id="n34" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>A fact. The original fraud was ingeniously and fraudfully <lb/>
duplicated, and exhibited in New York as the "only genuine" Cardiff <lb/>
Giant (to the unspeakable disgust of the owners of the real colossus) <lb/>
at the very same time that the latter was drawing crowds at a museum <lb/>
in Albany.</p></note> Con- <lb/>
found it, don't you know your own remains?"</p>
<p>I never saw such an eloquent look of shame, <lb/>
of pitiable humiliation, overspread a countenance <lb/>
before.</p>
<p>The Petrified Man rose slowly to his feet, and <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Honestly, <i>is</i> that true?"</p>
<p>"As true as I am sitting here."</p>
<p>He took the pipe from his mouth and laid it on <lb/>
the mantel, then stood irresolute a moment (uncon- <lb/>
sciously, from old habit, thrusting his hands where <lb/>
<pb n="292"/>
his pantaloons pockets should have been, and medi- <lb/>
tatively dropping his chin on his breast), and finally <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Well&#x2014;I <i>never</i> felt so absurd before. The <lb/>
Petrified Man has sold everybody else, and now the <lb/>
mean fraud has ended by selling its own ghost! <lb/>
My son, if there is any charity left in your heart for <lb/>
a poor friendless phantom like me, don't let this get <lb/>
out. Think how <i>you</i> would feel if you had made <lb/>
such an ass of yourself."</p>
<p>I heard his stately tramp die away, step by step <lb/>
down the stairs and out into the deserted street, and <lb/>
felt sorry that he was gone, poor fellow&#x2014;and <lb/>
sorrier still that he had carried off my red blanket <lb/>
and my bath tub.</p>

centuries what good would it do? How could it <lb/>
help a poor wretch without name, capital, or <lb/>
friends?"</p>
<p>"Idiot! Coward! Baby! Six months to raise <lb/>
the money in&#x2014;and five will do!"</p>
<p>"Are you insane?"</p>
<p>"Six months&#x2014;an abundance. Leave it to me. <lb/>
I'll raise it."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, John? How on earth can <lb/>
you raise such a monstrous sum for <i>me?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Will</i> you let that be <i>my</i> business, and not <lb/>
meddle? Will you leave the thing in my hands? <lb/>
Will you swear to submit to whatever I do? Will <lb/>
you pledge me to find no fault with my actions?"</p>
<p>"I am dizzy&#x2014;bewildered&#x2014;but I swear."</p>
<p>John took up a hammer and deliberately smashed <lb/>
the nose of America! He made another pass and <lb/>
two of her fingers fell to the floor&#x2014;another, and <lb/>
part of an ear came away&#x2014;another, and a row of <lb/>
toes was mangled and dismembered&#x2014;another, and <lb/>
the left leg, from the knee down, lay a fragmentary <lb/>
ruin!</p>
<p>John put on his hat and departed.</p>
<p>George gazed speechless upon the battered and <lb/>
grotesque nightmare before him for the space of <lb/>
thirty seconds, and then wilted to the floor and went <lb/>
into convulsions.</p>
<pb n="296"/>
<p>John returned presently with a carriage, got the <lb/>
broken-hearted artist and the broken-legged statue <lb/>
aboard, and drove off, whistling low and tranquilly. <lb/>
He left the artist at his lodgings, and drove off <lb/>
and disappeared down the <i>Via Quirinalis</i> with the <lb/>
statue.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<q>[<i>Scene&#x2014;A Roman Caf&#x00E9;</i>.]</q>
<p>One of a group of American gentlemen reads and <lb/>
translates from the weekly edition of <i>Il Slang- <lb/>
whanger di Roma</i> as follows: <lb/>
<q>"<smcap>Wonderful Discovery!</smcap>&#x2014;Some six months ago Signor John <lb/>
Smitthe, an American gentleman now some years a resident of Rome, <lb/>
purchased for a trifle a small piece of ground in the Campagna, just <lb/>
beyond the tomb of the Scipio family, from the owner, a bankrupt relative <lb/>
of the Princess Borghese. Mr. Smitthe afterwards went to the Minister <lb/>
of the Public Records and had the piece of ground transferred to a poor <lb/>
American artist named George Arnold, explaining that he did it as pay- <lb/>
ment and satisfaction for pecuniary damage accidentally done by him <lb/>
long since upon property belonging to Signor Arnold, and further <lb/>
observed that he would make additional satisfaction by improving the <lb/>
ground for Signor A., at his own charge and cost. Four weeks ago, <lb/>
while making some necessary excavations upon the property, Signor <lb/>
Smitthe unearthed the most remarkable ancient statue that has ever been <lb/>
added to the opulent art treasures of Rome. It was an exquisite figure <lb/>
of a woman, and though sadly stained by the soil and the mould of ages, <lb/>
no eye can look unmoved upon its ravishing beauty. The nose, the left <lb/>
leg from the knee down, an ear, and also the toes of the right foot and <lb/>
two fingers of one of the hands, were gone, but otherwise the noble <lb/>
figure was in a remarkable state of preservation. The government at <lb/>
once took military possession of the statue, and appointed a commission <lb/>
of art critics, antiquaries, and cardinal princes of the church to assess its <lb/>
value and determine the remuneration that must go to the owner of the <lb/>
ground in which it was found. The whole affair was kept a profound <lb/>
secret until last night. In the meantime the commission sat with closed <lb/>
doors, and deliberated. Last night they decided unanimously that the <lb/>
statue is a Venus, and the work of some unknown but sublimely gifted <lb/>
artist of the third century before Christ. They consider it the most <lb/>
faultless work of art the world has any knowledge of.</q>
<q>"At midnight they held a final conference and decided that the <lb/>
Venus was worth the enormous sum of <i>ten million francs!</i> In accord- <lb/>
<pb n="299"/>
ance with Roman law and Roman usage, the government being half <lb/>
owner in all works of art found in the Campagna, the State has naught <lb/>
to do but pay five million francs to Mr. Arnold and take permanent <lb/>
possession of the beautiful statue. This morning the Venus will be <lb/>
removed to the Capitol, there to remain, and at noon the commission <lb/>
will wait upon Signor Arnold with His Holiness the Pope's order upon <lb/>
the Treasury for the princely sum of five million francs in gold!"</q></p>
<p><i>Chorus of Voices</i>.&#x2014;"Luck! It's no name for it!"</p>
<p><i>Another Voice</i>.&#x2014;"Gentlemen, I propose that we <lb/>
immediately form an American joint-stock company <lb/>
for the purchase of lands and excavations of statues <lb/>
here, with proper connections in Wall street to bull <lb/>
and bear the stock."</p>
<p><i>All</i>.&#x2014;"Agreed."</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<q>[<i>Scene&#x2014;The Roman Capitol Ten Years Later</i>.]</q>
<p>"Dearest Mary, this is the most celebrated statue <lb/>
in the world. This is the renowed 'Capitoline <lb/>
Venus' you've heard so much about. Here she is <lb/>
with her little blemishes 'restored' (that is, patched) <lb/>
by the most noted Roman artists&#x2014;and the mere <lb/>
fact that they did the humble patching of so noble a <lb/>
creation will make their names illustrious while the <lb/>
world stands. How strange it seems&#x2014;this place! <lb/>
The day before I last stood here, ten happy years <lb/>
ago, I wasn't a rich man&#x2014;bless your soul, I hadn't <lb/>
a cent. And yet I had a good deal to do with <lb/>
making Rome mistress of this grandest work of <lb/>
ancient art the world contains."</p>
<pb n="300"/>
<p>"The worshiped, the illustrious Capitoline Venus <lb/>
&#x2014;and what a sum she is valued at! Ten millions <lb/>
of francs!"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;<i>now</i> she is."</p>
<p>"And oh, Georgy, how divinely beautiful she is!"</p>
<p>"Ah, yes&#x2014;but nothing to what she was before <lb/>
that blessed John Smith broke her leg and battered <lb/>
her nose. Ingenious Smith!&#x2014;gifted Smith&#x2014;noble <lb/>
Smith! Author of all our bliss! Hark! Do you <lb/>
know what that wheeze means? Mary, that cub has <lb/>
got the whooping cough. Will you <i>never</i> learn to <lb/>
take care of the children!"</p>
<div4 type="subsection">
<head>THE END.</head>
<p>The Capitoline Venus is still in the Capitol at <lb/>
Rome, and is still the most charming and most illus- <lb/>
trious work of ancient art the world can boast of. <lb/>
But if ever it shall be your fortune to stand before it <lb/>
and go into the customary ecstasies over it, don't <lb/>
permit this true and secret history of its origin to <lb/>
mar your bliss&#x2014;and when you read about a gigantic <lb/>
Petrified Man being dug up near Syracuse, in the <lb/>
State of New York, or near any other place, keep <lb/>
your own counsel&#x2014;and if the Barnum that buried <lb/>
him there offers to sell to you at an enormous sum, <lb/>
don't you buy. Send him to the Pope!"</p>

<head><b>SPEECH ON ACCIDENT INSURANCE</b> <lb/>
<smcap>delivered in hartford, at a dinner to cornelius <lb/>
walford, of london</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>Gentlemen</smcap>: I am glad, indeed, to assist in <lb/>
welcoming the distinguished guest of this occa- <lb/>
sion to a city whose fame as an insurance center has <lb/>
extended to all lands, and given us the name of <lb/>
being a quadruple band of brothers working sweetly <lb/>
hand in hand&#x2014;the Colt's arms company making <lb/>
the destruction of our race easy and convenient, our <lb/>
life insurance citizens paying for the victims when <lb/>
they pass away, Mr. Batterson perpetuating their <lb/>
memory with his stately monuments, and our fire <lb/>
insurance comrades taking care of their hereafter. <lb/>
I am glad to assist in welcoming our guest&#x2014;first, <lb/>
because he is an Englishman, and I owe a heavy <lb/>
debt of hospitality to certain of his fellow-country- <lb/>
men; and secondly, because he is in sympathy with <lb/>
insurance and has been the means of making many <lb/>
other men cast their sympathies in the same direc- <lb/>
tion.</p>
<p>Certainly there is no nobler field for human effort <lb/>
than the insurance line of business&#x2014;especially acci- <lb/>
<pb n="302"/>
dent insurance. Ever since I have been a director <lb/>
in an accident insurance company I have felt that I <lb/>
am a better man. Life has seemed more precious. <lb/>
Accidents have assumed a kindlier aspect. Distress- <lb/>
ing special providences have lost half their horror. I <lb/>
look upon a cripple now with affectionate interest&#x2014; <lb/>
as an advertisement. I do not seem to care for <lb/>
poetry any more. I do not care for politics&#x2014;even <lb/>
agriculture does not excite me. But to me now <lb/>
there is a charm about a railway collision that is <lb/>
unspeakable.</p>
<p>There is nothing more beneficent than accident <lb/>
insurance. I have seen an entire family lifted out of <lb/>
poverty and into affluence by the simple boon of a <lb/>
broken leg. I have had people come to me on <lb/>
crutches, with tears in their eyes, to bless this bene- <lb/>
ficent institution. In all my experience of life, I <lb/>
have seen nothing so seraphic as the look that comes <lb/>
into a freshly mutilated man's face when he feels in <lb/>
his vest pocket with his remaining hand and finds <lb/>
his accident ticket all right. And I have seen noth- <lb/>
ing so sad as the look that came into another splin- <lb/>
tered customer's face, when he found he couldn't <lb/>
collect on a wooden leg.</p>
<p>I will remark here, by way of advertisement, that <lb/>
that noble charity which we have named the <smcap>Hart- <lb/>
ford Accident Insurance Company</smcap>,<ref target="n35">*</ref><note id="n35" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>The speaker is a director of the company named.</p></note> is an insti- <lb/>
tution which is peculiarly to be depended upon. A <lb/>
man is bound to prosper who gives it his custom. <lb/>
<pb n="303"/>
No man can take out a policy in it and not get crip- <lb/>
pled before the year is out. Now there was one <lb/>
indigent man who had been disappointed so often <lb/>
with other companies that he had grown disheart- <lb/>
ened, his appetite left him, he ceased to smile&#x2014; <lb/>
said life was but a weariness. Three weeks ago I <lb/>
got him to insure with us, and now he is the <lb/>
brightest, happiest spirit in this land&#x2014;has a good <lb/>
steady income and a stylish suit of new bandages <lb/>
every day, and travels around on a shutter.</p>
<p>I will say, in conclusion, that my share of the <lb/>
welcome to our guest is none the less hearty because <lb/>
I talk so much nonsense, and I know that I can say <lb/>
the same for the rest of the speakers.</p>

<head><b>JOHN CHINAMAN IN NEW YORK</b></head>
<p><smcap>As i</smcap> passed along by one of those monster <lb/>
American tea stores in New York, I found a <lb/>
Chinaman sitting before it acting in the capacity of <lb/>
a sign. Everybody that passed by gave him a <lb/>
steady stare as long as their heads would twist over <lb/>
their shoulders without dislocating their necks, and <lb/>
a group had stopped to stare deliberately.</p>
<p>Is it not a shame that we, who prate so much <lb/>
about civilization and humanity, are content to de- <lb/>
grade a fellow-being to such an office as this? Is it <lb/>
not time for reflection when we find ourselves willing <lb/>
to see in such a being matter for frivolous curiosity <lb/>
instead of regret and grave reflection? Here was a <lb/>
poor creature whom hard fortune had exiled from <lb/>
his natural home beyond the seas, and whose <lb/>
troubles ought to have touched these idle strangers <lb/>
that thronged about him; but did it? Apparently <lb/>
not. Men calling themselves the superior race, the <lb/>
race of culture and of gentle blood, scanned his <lb/>
quaint Chinese hat, with peaked roof and ball on <lb/>
top, and his long queue dangling down his back; <lb/>
his short silken blouse, curiously frogged and figured <lb/>
<pb n="305"/>
(and, like the rest of his raiment, rusty, dilapidated, <lb/>
and awkwardly put on); his blue cotton, tight- <lb/>
legged pants, tied close around the ankles; and his <lb/>
clumsy blunt-toed shoes with thick cork soles; and <lb/>
having so scanned him from head to foot, cracked <lb/>
some unseemly joke about his outlandish attire or <lb/>
his melancholy face, and passed on. In my heart I <lb/>
pitied the friendless Mongol. I wondered what was <lb/>
passing behind his sad face, and what distant scene <lb/>
his vacant eye was dreaming of. Were his thoughts <lb/>
with his heart, ten thousand miles away, beyond the <lb/>
billowy wastes of the Pacific? among the rice-fields <lb/>
and the plumy palms of China? under the shadows <lb/>
of remembered mountain-peaks, or in groves of <lb/>
bloomy shrubs and strange forest-trees unknown to <lb/>
climes like ours? And now and then, rippling <lb/>
among his visions and his dreams, did he hear <lb/>
familiar laughter and half-forgotten voices, and did <lb/>
he catch fitful glimpses of the friendly faces of a <lb/>
bygone time? A cruel fate it is, I said, that is be- <lb/>
fallen this bronzed wanderer. In order that the group <lb/>
of idlers might be touched at least by the words of <lb/>
the poor fellow, since the appeal of his pauper dress <lb/>
and his dreary exile was lost upon them, I touched <lb/>
him on the shoulder and said:</p>
<p>"Cheer up&#x2014;don't be down-hearted. It is not <lb/>
America that treats you in this way, it is merely <lb/>
one citizen, whose greed of gain has eaten the <lb/>
humanity out of his heart. America has a broader <lb/>
hospitality for the exiled and oppressed. America <lb/>
<pb n="306"/>
and Americans are always ready to help the unfor- <lb/>
tunate. Money shall be raised&#x2014;you shall go back <lb/>
to China&#x2014;you shall see your friends again. What <lb/>
wages do they pay you here?"</p>
<p>"Divil a cint but four dollars a week and find <lb/>
meself; but it's aisy, barrin the troublesome furrin <lb/>
clothes that's so expinsive."</p>
<p>The exile remains at his post. The New York <lb/>
tea merchants who need picturesque signs are not <lb/>
likely to run out of Chinamen.</p>

<head><b>HOW I EDITED AN AGRICULTURAL <lb/>
PAPER</b><ref target="n36">*</ref><note id="n36" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1870.</p></note></head>
<p><smcap>I did</smcap> not take temporary editorship of an agricul- <lb/>
tural paper without misgivings. Neither would <lb/>
a landsman take command of a ship without mis- <lb/>
givings. But I was in circumstances that made the <lb/>
salary an object. The regular editor of the paper <lb/>
was going off for a holiday, and I accepted the terms <lb/>
he offered, and took his place.</p>
<p>The sensation of being at work again was luxuri- <lb/>
ous, and I wrought all the week with unflagging <lb/>
pleasure. We went to press, and I waited a day <lb/>
with some solicitude to see whether my effort was <lb/>
going to attract any notice. As I left the office, <lb/>
toward sundown, a group of men and boys at the <lb/>
foot of the stairs dispersed with one impulse, and <lb/>
gave me passageway, and I heard one or two of <lb/>
them say: "That's him!" I was naturally pleased <lb/>
by this incident. The next morning I found a <lb/>
similar group at the foot of the stairs, and scatter- <lb/>
ing couples and individuals standing here and there <lb/>
in the street, and over the way, watching me with <lb/>
<pb n="308"/>
interest. The group separated and fell back as I <lb/>
approached, and I heard a man say, "Look at his <lb/>
eye!" I pretended not to observe the notice I was <lb/>
attracting, but secretly I was pleased with it, and <lb/>
was purposing to write an account of it to my aunt. <lb/>
I went up the short flight of stairs, and heard cheery <lb/>
voices and a ringing laugh as I drew near the door, <lb/>
which I opened, and caught a glimpse of two young <lb/>
rural-looking men, whose faces blanched and length- <lb/>
ened when they saw me, and then they both plunged <lb/>
through the window with a great crash. I was sur- <lb/>
prised.</p>
<p>In about half an hour an old gentleman, with a <lb/>
flowing beard and a fine but rather austere face, <lb/>
entered, and sat down at my invitation. He seemed <lb/>
to have something on his mind. He took off his <lb/>
hat and set it on the floor, and got out of it a red <lb/>
silk handkerchief and a copy of our paper.</p>
<p>He put the paper on his lap, and while he polished <lb/>
his spectacles with his handkerchief, he said, "Are <lb/>
you the new editor?"</p>
<p>I said I was.</p>
<p>"Have you ever edited an agricultural paper be- <lb/>
fore?"</p>
<p>"No," I said; "this is my first attempt."</p>
<p>"Very likely. Have you had any experience in <lb/>
agriculture practically?"</p>
<p>"No; I believe I have not."</p>
<p>"Some instinct told me so," said the old gentle- <lb/>
man, putting on his spectacles, and looking over <lb/>
<pb/>
<figure>
<head>I FANCIED HE WAS DISPLEASED</head>
</figure>
<pb/>
<pb n="309"/>
them at me with asperity, while he folded his paper <lb/>
into a convenient shape. "I wish to read you <lb/>
what must have made me have that instinct. It <lb/>
was this editorial. Listen, and see if it was you that <lb/>
wrote it: <lb/>
<q>"Turnips should never be pulled, it injures them. It is much <lb/>
better to send a boy up and let him shake the tree."</q></p>
<p>"Now, what do you think of that?&#x2014;for I really <lb/>
suppose you wrote it?"</p>
<p>"Think of it? Why, I think it is good. I think <lb/>
it is sense. I have no doubt that every year millions <lb/>
and millions of bushels of turnips are spoiled in this <lb/>
township alone by being pulled in a half-ripe condi- <lb/>
tion, when, if they had sent a boy up to shake the <lb/>
tree&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Shake your grandmother! Turnips don't grow <lb/>
on trees!"</p>
<p>"Oh, they don't, don't they? Well, who said <lb/>
they did? The language was intended to be figur- <lb/>
ative, wholly figurative. Anybody that knows any- <lb/>
thing will know that I meant that the boy should <lb/>
shake the vine."</p>
<p>Then this old person got up and tore his paper all <lb/>
into small shreds, and stamped on them, and broke <lb/>
several things with his cane, and said I did not know <lb/>
as much as a cow; and then went out and banged <lb/>
the door after him, and, in short, acted in such a <lb/>
way that I fancied he was displeased about some- <lb/>
thing. But not knowing what the trouble was, I <lb/>
could not be any help to him.</p>
<pb n="310"/>
<p>Pretty soon after this a long cadaverous creature, <lb/>
with lanky locks hanging down to his shoulders, and <lb/>
a week's stubble bristling from the hills and valleys <lb/>
of his face, darted within the door, and halted, <lb/>
motionless, with finger on lip, and head and body <lb/>
bent in listening attitude. No sound was heard. <lb/>
Still he listened. No sound. Then he turned the <lb/>
key in the door, and came elaborately tiptoeing <lb/>
toward me till he was within long reaching distance <lb/>
of me, when he stopped and, after scanning my face <lb/>
with intense interest for a while, drew a folded copy <lb/>
of our paper from his bosom, and said:</p>
<p>"There, you wrote that. Read it to me&#x2014;quick! <lb/>
Relieve me. I suffer."</p>
<p>I read as follows; and as the sentences fell from <lb/>
my lips I could see the relief come, I could see the <lb/>
drawn muscles relax, and the anxiety go out of the <lb/>
face, and rest and peace steal over the features like <lb/>
the merciful moonlight over a desolate landscape: <lb/>
<q>"The guano is a fine bird, but great care is necessary in rearing it. <lb/>
It should not be imported earlier than June or later than September. <lb/>
In the winter it should be kept in a warm place, where it can hatch out <lb/>
its young.</q>
<q>"It is evident that we are to have a backward season for grain. <lb/>
Therefore it will be well for the farmer to begin setting out his corn- <lb/>
stalks and planting his buckwheat cakes in July instead of August.</q>
<q>"Concerning the pumpkin.&#x2014;This berry is a favorite with the natives <lb/>
of the interior of New England, who prefer it to the gooseberry for the <lb/>
making of fruit-cake, and who likewise give it the preference over the <lb/>
raspberry for feeding cows, as being more filling and fully as satisfying. <lb/>
The pumpkin is the only esculent of the orange family that will thrive in <lb/>
the North, except the gourd and one or two varieties of the squash. <lb/>
But the custom of planting it in the front yard with the shrubbery is fast <lb/>
<pb n="311"/>
going out of vogue, for it is now generally conceded that the pumpkin <lb/>
as a shade tree is a failure.</q>
<q>"Now, as the warm weather approaches, and the ganders begin to <lb/>
spawn"&#x2014;</q></p>
<p>The excited listener sprang toward me to shake <lb/>
hands, and said:</p>
<p>"There, there&#x2014;that will do. I know I am all <lb/>
right now, because you have read it just as I did, <lb/>
word for word. But, stranger, when I first read it <lb/>
this morning, I said to myself, I never, never be- <lb/>
lieved it before, notwithstanding my friends kept me <lb/>
under watch so strict, but now I believe I <i>am</i> crazy; <lb/>
and with that I fetched a howl that you might have <lb/>
heard two miles, and started out to kill somebody&#x2014; <lb/>
because, you know, I knew it would come to that <lb/>
sooner or later, and so I might as well begin. I <lb/>
read one of them paragraphs over again, so as to be <lb/>
certain, and then I burned my house down and <lb/>
started. I have crippled several people, and have <lb/>
got one fellow up a tree, where I can get him if I <lb/>
want him. But I thought I would call in here as <lb/>
I passed along and make the thing perfectly certain; <lb/>
and now it <i>is</i> certain, and I tell you it is lucky for <lb/>
the chap that is in the tree. I should have killed <lb/>
him sure, as I went back. Good-bye, sir, good- <lb/>
bye; you have taken a great load off my mind. <lb/>
My reason has stood the strain of one of your agri- <lb/>
cultural articles, and I know that nothing can ever <lb/>
unseat it now. <i>Good</i>-bye, sir."</p>
<p>I felt a little uncomfortable about the cripplings <lb/>
<pb n="312"/>
and arsons this person had been entertaining himself <lb/>
with, for I could not help feeling remotely accessory <lb/>
to them. But these thoughts were quickly banished, <lb/>

myself, Now if you had gone to Egypt as I recom- <lb/>
mended you to, I might have had a chance to get <lb/>
my hand in; but you wouldn't do it, and here you <lb/>
are. I sort of expected you.]</p>
<p>The editor was looking sad and perplexed and <lb/>
dejected.</p>
<p>He surveyed the wreck which that old rioter and <lb/>
these two young farmers had made, and then said <lb/>
"This is a sad business&#x2014;a very sad business. <lb/>
There is the mucilage bottle broken, and six panes <lb/>
of glass, and a spittoon, and two candlesticks. But <lb/>
that is not the worst. The reputation of the paper <lb/>
is injured&#x2014;and permanently, I fear. True, there <lb/>
never was such a call for the paper before, and it <lb/>
never sold such a large edition or soared to such <lb/>
celebrity;&#x2014;but does one want to be famous for <lb/>
lunacy, and prosper upon the infirmities of his <lb/>
mind? My friend, as I am an honest man, the <lb/>
street out here is full of people, and others are <lb/>
roosting on the fences, waiting to get a glimpse of <lb/>
you, because they think you are crazy. And well <lb/>
they might after reading your editorials. They are <lb/>
a disgrace to journalism. Why, what put it into <lb/>
your head that you could edit a paper of this nature? <lb/>
You do not seem to know the first rudiments of <lb/>
agriculture. You speak of a furrow and a harrow <lb/>
<pb n="313"/>
as being the same thing; you talk of the moulting <lb/>
season for cows; and you recommend the domesti- <lb/>
cation of the pole-cat on account of its playfulness <lb/>
and its excellence as a ratter! Your remark that <lb/>
clams will lie quiet if music be played to them was <lb/>
superfluous&#x2014;entirely superfluous. Nothing disturbs <lb/>
clams. Clams <i>always</i> lie quiet. Clams care nothing <lb/>
whatever about music. Ah, heavens and earth, <lb/>
friend! if you had made the acquiring of ignorance <lb/>
the study of your life, you could not have graduated <lb/>
with higher honor than you could to-day. I never <lb/>
saw anything like it. Your observation that the <lb/>
horse-chestnut as an article of commerce is steadily <lb/>
gaining in favor, is simply calculated to destroy this <lb/>
journal. I want you to throw up your situation and <lb/>
go. I want no more holiday&#x2014;I could not enjoy <lb/>
it if I had it. Certainly not with you in my chair. <lb/>
I would always stand in dread of what you might be <lb/>
going to recommend next. It makes me lose all <lb/>
patience every time I think of your discussing <lb/>
oyster-beds under the head of 'Landscape Garden- <lb/>
ing.' I want you to go. Nothing on earth could <lb/>
persuade me to take another holiday. Oh! why <lb/>
didn't you <i>tell</i> me you didn't know anything about <lb/>
agriculture?"</p>
<p>"<i>Tell</i> you, you cornstalk, you cabbage, you son <lb/>
of a cauliflower? It's the first time I ever heard <lb/>
such an unfeeling remark. I tell you I have been <lb/>
in the editorial business going on fourteen years, <lb/>

about good farming and no more. Who review the <lb/>

of their families to build the evening camp-fire with. <lb/>
Who write the temperance appeals, and clamor <lb/>
about the flowing bowl? Folks who will never draw <lb/>
another sober breath till they do it in the grave. <lb/>

Men, as a general thing, who fail in the poetry line, <lb/>
yellow-colored novel line, sensation-drama line, city- <lb/>
editor line, and finally fall back on agriculture as a <lb/>
temporary reprieve from the poorhouse. <i>You</i> try <lb/>
to tell <i>me</i> anything about the newspaper business! <lb/>
Sir, I have been through it from Alpha to Omaha, <lb/>

I have been treated as you have treated me, I am <lb/>

I have fulfilled my contract as far as I was permitted <lb/>

<head><b>THE PETRIFIED MAN</b></head>
<p><smcap>Now</smcap>, to show how really hard it is to foist a <lb/>
moral or a truth upon an unsuspecting public <lb/>
through a burlesque without entirely and absurdly <lb/>
missing one's mark, I will here set down two ex- <lb/>
periences of my own in this thing. In the fall of <lb/>
1862, in Nevada and California, the people got to <lb/>
running wild about extraordinary petrifications and <lb/>
other natural marvels. One could scarcely pick up <lb/>
a paper without finding in it one or two glorified <lb/>
discoveries of this kind. The mania was becoming <lb/>
a little ridiculous. I was a bran-new local editor in <lb/>
Virginia City, and I felt called upon to destroy this <lb/>
growing evil; we all have our benignant fatherly <lb/>
moods at one time or another, I suppose. I chose <lb/>
to kill the petrifaction mania with a delicate, a very <lb/>
delicate satire. But maybe it was altogether too <lb/>
delicate, for nobody ever perceived the satire part <lb/>
of it at all. I put my scheme in the shape of the <lb/>
discovery of a remarkably petrified man.</p>
<p>I had had a temporary falling out with Mr. <gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>, <lb/>
the new coroner and justice of the peace of Hum- <lb/>
boldt, and thought I might as well touch him up a <lb/>
<pb n="317"/>
little at the same time and make him ridiculous, and <lb/>
thus combine pleasure with business. So I told, in <lb/>
patient belief-compelling detail, all about the finding <lb/>
of a petrified man at Gravelly Ford (exactly a hun- <lb/>
dred and twenty miles, over a breakneck mountain <lb/>
trail from where <gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> lived); how all the savants <lb/>
of the immediate neighborhood had been to ex- <lb/>
amine it (it was notorious that there was not a <lb/>
living creature within fifty miles of there, except a <lb/>
few starving Indians, some crippled grasshoppers, <lb/>
and four or five buzzards out of meat and too feeble <lb/>
to get away); how those savants all pronounced the <lb/>
petrified man to have been in a state of complete <lb/>
petrifaction for over ten generations; and then, with <lb/>
a seriousness that I ought to have been ashamed to <lb/>
assume, I stated that as soon as Mr. <gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> heard the <lb/>
news he summoned a jury, mounted his mule, and <lb/>
posted off, with noble reverence for official duty, on <lb/>
that awful five days journey, through alkali, sage- <lb/>
brush, peril of body, and imminent starvation, to <lb/>
<i>hold an inquest</i> on this man that had been dead and <lb/>
turned to everlasting stone for more than three hun- <lb/>
dred years! And then, my hand being "in," so to <lb/>
speak, I went on, with the same unflinching gravity, <lb/>
to state that the jury returned a verdict that deceased <lb/>
came to his death from <i>protracted exposure</i>. This <lb/>
only moved me to higher flights of imagination, and <lb/>
I said that the jury, with that charity so character- <lb/>
istic of pioneers, then dug a grave, and were about <lb/>
to give the petrified man Christian burial, when they <lb/>
<pb n="318"/>
found that for ages a limestone sediment had been <lb/>
trickling down the face of the stone against which <lb/>
he was sitting, and this stuff had run under him and <lb/>
cemented him fast to the "bed-rock"; that the <lb/>
jury (they were all silver miners) canvassed the <lb/>
difficulty a moment, and then got out their powder <lb/>
and fuse, and proceeded to drill a hole under him, <lb/>
in order to <i>blast him from his position</i>, when Mr. <lb/>
<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>, "with that delicacy so characteristic of him, <lb/>
forbade them, observing that it would be little less <lb/>
than sacrilege to do such a thing."</p>
<p>From beginning to end the "Petrified Man" <lb/>
squib was a string of roaring absurdities, albeit they <lb/>
were told with an unfair pretense of truth that even <lb/>
imposed upon me to some extent, and I was in some <lb/>
danger of believing in my own fraud. But I really <lb/>
had no desire to deceive anybody, and no expecta- <lb/>
tion of doing it. I depended on the way the petri- <lb/>
fied man was <i>sitting</i> to explain to the public that he <lb/>
was a swindle. Yet I purposely mixed that up with <lb/>
other things, hoping to make it obscure&#x2014;and I <lb/>
did. I would describe the position of one foot, and <lb/>
then say his right thumb was against the side of his <lb/>
nose; then talk about his other foot, and presently <lb/>
come back and say the fingers of his right hand were <lb/>
spread apart; then talk about the back of his head a <lb/>
little, and return and say the left thumb was hooked <lb/>
into the right little finger; then ramble off about <lb/>
something else, and by and by drift back again and <lb/>
remark that the fingers of the left hand were spread <lb/>
<pb n="319"/>
like those of the right. But I was too ingenious. I <lb/>
mixed it up rather too much; and so all that de- <lb/>
scription of the attitude, as a key to the humbuggery <lb/>
of the article, was entirely lost, for nobody but me <lb/>
ever discovered and comprehended the peculiar and <lb/>
suggestive position of the petrified man's hands.</p>
<p>As a <i>satire</i> on the petrifaction mania, or anything <lb/>
else, my Petrified Man was a disheartening failure; <lb/>
for everybody received him in innocent good faith, <lb/>
and I was stunned to see the creature I had begotten <lb/>
to pull down the wonder-business with, and bring <lb/>
derision upon it, calmly exalted to the grand chief <lb/>
place in the list of the genuine marvels our Nevada <lb/>
had produced. I was so disappointed at the curious <lb/>
miscarriage of my scheme, that at first I was angry, <lb/>
and did not like to think about it; but by and by, <lb/>
when the exchanges began to come in with the <lb/>
Petrified Man copied and guilelessly glorified, I <lb/>
began to feel a soothing secret satisfaction; and as <lb/>
my gentleman's field of travels broadened, and by <lb/>
the exchanges I saw that he steadily and implacably <lb/>
penetrated territory after territory, State after State, <lb/>
and land after land, till he swept the great globe and <lb/>
culminated in sublime and unimpeached legitimacy <lb/>
in the august London <foreign lang="spa"><i>Lancet</i>,</foreign> my cup was full, and <lb/>
I said I was glad I had done it. I think that for <lb/>
about eleven months, as nearly as I can remember, <lb/>
Mr. <gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>'s daily mail-bag continued to be swollen <lb/>
by the addition of half a bushel of newspapers hail- <lb/>
ing from many climes with the Petrified Man in <lb/>
<pb n="320"/>
them, marked around with a prominent belt of ink. <lb/>
I sent them to him. I did it for spite, not for fun. <lb/>
He used to shovel them into his back yard and <lb/>
curse. And every day during all those months the <lb/>
miners, his constituents (for miners never quit joking <lb/>
a person when they get started), would call on him <lb/>
and ask if he could tell them where they could get <lb/>
hold of a paper with the Petrified Man in it. He <lb/>
could have accommodated a continent with them. I <lb/>
hated <gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> in those days, and these things pacified <lb/>
me and pleased me. I could not have gotten more <lb/>
real comfort out of him without killing him.</p>

<pb n="321"/>
<head><b>MY BLOODY MASSACRE</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> other burlesque I have referred to was my <lb/>
fine satire upon the financial expedients of <lb/>
"cooking dividends," a thing which became shame- <lb/>
fully frequent on the Pacific coast for a while. Once <lb/>
more, in my self-complacent simplicity I felt that <lb/>
the time had arrived for me to rise up and be a re- <lb/>
former. I put this reformatory satire in the shape <lb/>
of a fearful "Massacre at Empire City." The San <lb/>
Francisco papers were making a great outcry about <lb/>
the iniquity of the Daney Silver-Mining Company, <lb/>
whose directors had declared a "cooked" or false <lb/>
dividend, for the purpose of increasing the value of <lb/>
their stock, so that they could sell out at a comfort- <lb/>
able figure, and then scramble from under the tum- <lb/>
bling concern. And while abusing the Daney, those <lb/>
papers did not forget to urge the public to get rid <lb/>
of all their silver stocks and invest in sound and safe <lb/>
San Francisco stocks, such as the Spring Valley <lb/>
Water Company, etc. But right at this unfortunate <lb/>
juncture, behold the Spring Valley cooked a dividend <lb/>
too! And so, under the insidious mask of an in- <lb/>
vented "bloody massacre," I stole upon the public <lb/>
unawares with my scathing satire upon the dividend- <lb/>
<pb n="322"/>
cooking system. In about half a column of imagi- <lb/>
nary human carnage I told how a citizen had <lb/>
murdered his wife and nine children, and then <lb/>
committed suicide. And I said slyly, at the bottom, <lb/>
that the sudden madness of which this melancholy <lb/>
massacre was the result, had been brought about <lb/>
by his having allowed himself to be persuaded by <lb/>
the California papers to sell his sound and lucrative <lb/>
Nevada silver stocks, and buy into Spring Valley <lb/>
just in time to get cooked along with that company's <lb/>
fancy dividend, and sink every cent he had in the <lb/>
world.</p>
<p>Ah, it was a deep, deep satire, and most ingeni- <lb/>
ously contrived. But I made the horrible details so <lb/>
carefully and conscientiously interesting that the <lb/>
public devoured <i>them</i> greedily, and wholly over- <lb/>
looked the following distinctly-stated facts, to wit: <lb/>
The murderer was perfectly well known to every <lb/>
creature in the land as a <i>bachelor</i>, and consequently <lb/>
he could not murder his wife and nine children; he <lb/>
murdered them "in his splendid dressed-stone man- <lb/>
sion just in the edge of the great pine forest between <lb/>
Empire City and Dutch Nick's," when even the very <lb/>
pickled oysters that came on our tables knew that <lb/>
there was not a "dressed-stone mansion" in all <lb/>
Nevada Territory; also that, so far from there being <lb/>
a "great pine forest between Empire City and <lb/>
Dutch Nick's," there wasn't a solitary tree within <lb/>
fifteen miles of either place; and, finally, it was <lb/>
patent and notorious that Empire City and Dutch <lb/>
<pb n="323"/>
Nick's were one and the same place, and contained <lb/>
only six houses anyhow, and consequently there <lb/>
could be no forest <i>between</i> them; and on top of all <lb/>
these absurdities I stated that this diabolical mur- <lb/>
derer, after inflicting a wound upon himself that the <lb/>
reader ought to have seen would kill an elephant in <lb/>
the twinkling of an eye, jumped on his horse and <lb/>
rode <i>four miles</i>, waving his wife's reeking scalp in <lb/>
the air, and thus performing entered Carson City <lb/>
with tremendous <i>&#x00E9;clat</i>, and dropped dead in front of <lb/>
the chief saloon, the envy and admiration of all <lb/>
beholders.</p>
<p>Well, in all my life I never saw anything like the <lb/>
sensation that little satire created. It was the talk <lb/>
of the town, it was the talk of the Territory. Most <lb/>
of the citizens dropped gently into it at breakfast, <lb/>
and they never finished their meal. There was <lb/>
something about those minutely faithful details that <lb/>
was a sufficing substitute for food. Few people that <lb/>
were able to read took food that morning. Dan and <lb/>
I (Dan was my reportorial associate) took our seats <lb/>
on either side of our customary table in the "Eagle <lb/>
Restaurant," and, as I unfolded the shred they used <lb/>
to call a napkin in that establishment, I saw at the <lb/>
next table two stalwart innocents with that sort of <lb/>
vegetable dandruff sprinkled about their clothing <lb/>
which was the sign and evidence that they were in <lb/>
from the Truckee with a load of hay. The one <lb/>
facing me had the morning paper folded to a long <lb/>
narrow strip, and I knew, without any telling, that <lb/>
<pb n="324"/>
that strip represented the column that contained my <lb/>
pleasant financial satire. From the way he was ex- <lb/>
citedly mumbling, I saw that the heedless son of a <lb/>
haymow was skipping with all his might, in order to <lb/>
get to the bloody details as quickly as possible; and <lb/>
so he was missing the guideboards I had set up to <lb/>
warn him that the whole thing was a fraud. <lb/>
Presently his eyes spread wide open, just as his <lb/>
jaws swung asunder to take in a potato approaching <lb/>
it on a fork; the potato halted, the face lit up redly, <lb/>
and the whole man was on fire with excitement. <lb/>
Then he broke into a disjointed checking off of the <lb/>
particulars&#x2014;his potato cooling in mid-air meantime, <lb/>
and his mouth making a reach for it occasionally, <lb/>
but always bringing up suddenly against a new and <lb/>
still more direful performance of my hero. At last <lb/>
he looked his stunned and rigid comrade impressively <lb/>
in the face, and said, with an expression of concen- <lb/>
trated awe:</p>
<p>"Jim, he b'iled his baby, and he took the old <lb/>
'oman's skelp. Cuss'd if <i>I</i> want any breakfast!"</p>
<p>And he laid his lingering potato reverently down, <lb/>
and he and his friend departed from the restaurant <lb/>
empty but satisfied.</p>
<p>He <i>never got down</i> to where the satire part of it <lb/>
began. Nobody ever did. They found the thrilling <lb/>
particulars sufficient. To drop in with a poor little <lb/>
moral at the fag-end of such a gorgeous massacre, <lb/>
was to following the expiring sun with a candle, <lb/>
and hope to attract the world's attention to it.</p>
<pb n="325"/>
<p>The idea that anybody could ever take my massa- <lb/>
cre for a genuine occurrence never once suggested <lb/>
itself to me, hedged about as it was by all those tell- <lb/>
tale absurdities and impossibilities concerning the <lb/>
"great pine forest," the "dressed-stone mansion," <lb/>
etc. But I found out then, and never have for- <lb/>
gotten since, that we never <i>read</i> the dull explanatory <lb/>
surroundings of marvelously exciting things when we <lb/>
have no occasion to suppose that some irresponsible <lb/>
scribbler is trying to defraud us; we skip all that, <lb/>
and hasten to revel in the blood-curdling particulars <lb/>
and be happy.</p>

<head><b>THE UNDERTAKER'S CHAT</b></head>
<p>"<smcap>Now</smcap> that corpse," said the undertaker, patting <lb/>
the folded hands of deceased approvingly, <lb/>
"was a brick&#x2014;every way you took him he was a <lb/>
brick. He was so real accommodating, and so <lb/>
modest-like and simple in his last moments. Friends <lb/>
wanted metallic burial-case&#x2014;nothing else would do. <lb/>
<i>I</i> couldn't get it. There warn't going to be time&#x2014; <lb/>
anybody could see that.</p>
<p>"Corpse said never mind, shake him up some <lb/>
kind of a box he could stretch out in comfortable, <lb/>
<i>he</i> warn't particular 'bout the general style of it. <lb/>
Said he went more on room than style, anyway in a <lb/>
last final container.</p>
<p>"Friends wanted a silver doorplate on the coffin, <lb/>
signifying who he was and wher' he was from. <lb/>
Now <i>you</i> know a fellow couldn't roust out such a <lb/>
gaily thing as that in a little country town like this. <lb/>
What did corpse say?</p>
<p>"Corpse said, whitewash his old canoe and dob <lb/>
his address and general destination onto it with a <lb/>
blacking brush and a stencil plate, 'long with a <lb/>
verse from some likely hymn or other, and p'int <lb/>
<pb n="327"/>
him for the tomb, and mark him C. O. D., and just <lb/>
let him flicker. <i>He</i> warn't distressed any more than <lb/>
you be&#x2014;on the contrary just as ca'm and collected <lb/>
as a hearse-horse; said he judged that wher' he was <lb/>
going to a body would find it considerable better to <lb/>
attract attention by a picturesque moral character <lb/>
than a natty burial case with a swell doorplate on it.</p>
<p>"Splendid man, he was. I'd druther do for a <lb/>
corpse like that 'n any I've tackled in seven year. <lb/>
There's some satisfaction in buryin' a man like that. <lb/>
You feel that what you're doing is appreciated. <lb/>
Lord bless you, so's he got planted before he <lb/>
sp'iled, he was perfectly satisfied; said his relations <lb/>
meant well, <i>per</i>fectly well, but all them preparations <lb/>
was bound to delay the thing more or less, and he <lb/>
didn't wish to be kept layin' around. You never <lb/>
see such a clear head as what he had&#x2014;and so ca'm <lb/>
and so cool. Just a hunk of brains&#x2014;that is what <lb/>
<i>he</i> was. Perfectly awful. It was a ripping distance <lb/>
from one end of that man's head to t'other. Often <lb/>
and over again he's had brain fever a-raging in one <lb/>
place, and the rest of the pile didn't know anything <lb/>
about it&#x2014;didn't affect it any more than an Injun <lb/>
insurrection in Arizona affects the Atlantic States.</p>
<p>"Well, the relations they wanted a big funeral, <lb/>
but corpse said he was down on flummery&#x2014;didn't <lb/>
want any procession&#x2014;fill the hearse full of mourn- <lb/>
ers, and get out a stern line and tow <i>him</i> behind. <lb/>
He <i>was</i> the most down on style of any remains I <lb/>
ever struck. A beautiful simple-minded creature&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="328"/>
it was what he was, you can depend on that. He <lb/>
was just set on having things the way he wanted <lb/>
them, and he took a solid comfort in laying his little <lb/>
plans. He had me measure him and take a whole <lb/>
raft of directions; then he had the minister stand up <lb/>
behind a long box with a tablecloth over it, to <lb/>
represent the coffin, and read his funeral sermon, <lb/>
saying 'Angcore, angcore!' at the good places, and <lb/>
making him scratch out every bit of brag about him, <lb/>
and all the hifalutin; and then he made them trot <lb/>
out the choir so's he could help them pick out the <lb/>
tunes for the occasion, and he got them to sing <lb/>
'Pop Goes the Weasel,' because he'd always liked <lb/>
that tune when he was down-hearted, and solemn <lb/>
music made him sad; and when they sung that with <lb/>
tears in their eyes (because they all loved him), and <lb/>
his relations grieving around, he just laid there as <lb/>
happy as a bug, and trying to beat time and show- <lb/>
ing all over how much he enjoyed it; and presently <lb/>
he got worked up and excited, and tried to join in, <lb/>
for, mind you, he was pretty proud of his abilities <lb/>
in the singing line; but the first time he opened his <lb/>
mouth and was just going to spread himself his <lb/>
breath took a walk.</p>
<p>"I never see a man snuffed out so sudden. Ah, <lb/>
it was a great loss&#x2014;a powerful loss to this poor <lb/>
little one-horse town. Well, well, well, I hain't got <lb/>
time to be palavering along here&#x2014;got to nail on the <lb/>
lid and mosey along with him; and if you'll just give <lb/>
me a lift we'll skeet him into the hearse and meander <lb/>
<pb n="329"/>
along. Relations bound to have it so&#x2014;don't pay <lb/>
no attention to dying injunctions, minute a corpse's <lb/>
gone; but, if I had <i>my</i> way, if I didn't respect his <lb/>
last wishes and tow him behind the hearse <i>I</i>'ll be <lb/>
cuss'd. I consider that whatever a corpse wants <lb/>
done for his comfort is little enough matter, and a <lb/>
man hain't got no right to deceive him or take ad- <lb/>
vantage of him; and whatever a corpse trusts me to <lb/>
do I'm a-going to <i>do</i>, you know, even if it's to stuff <lb/>
him and paint him yaller and keep him for a keep- <lb/>

<p>He cracked his whip and went lumbering away <lb/>
with his ancient ruin of a hearse, and I continued <lb/>
my walk with a valuable lesson learned&#x2014;(that a <lb/>
healthy and wholesome cheerfulness is not neces- <lb/>
sarily impossible to <i>any</i> occupation) The lesson is <lb/>
likely to be lasting, for it will take many months to <lb/>

<head><b>CONCERNING CHAMBERMAIDS</b></head>
<p><smcap>Against</smcap> all chambermaids, of whatsoever age <lb/>

dom! Because:</p>
<p>They always put the pillows at the opposite end <lb/>
of the bed from the gas-burner, so that while you <lb/>
read and smoke before sleeping (as is the ancient <lb/>
and honored custom of bachelors), you have to hold <lb/>
your book aloft, in an uncomfortable position, to <lb/>
keep the light from dazzling your eyes.</p>
<p>When they find the pillows removed to the other <lb/>
end of the bed in the morning, they receive not the <lb/>
suggestion in a friendly spirit; but, glorying in their <lb/>
absolute sovereignty, and unpitying your helpless- <lb/>
ness, they make the bed just as it was originally, <lb/>
and gloat in secret over the pang their tyranny will <lb/>
cause you.</p>
<p>Always after that, when they find you have trans- <lb/>
posed the pillows, they undo your work, and thus <lb/>
defy and seek to embitter the life that God has given <lb/>
you.</p>
<p>If they cannot get the light in an inconvenient <lb/>
position any other way, they move the bed.</p>
<pb n="331"/>
<p>If you pull your trunk out six inches from the <lb/>
wall, so that the lid will stay up when you open it, <lb/>
they always shove that trunk back again. They do <lb/>
it on purpose.</p>
<p>If you want the spittoon in a certain spot, where <lb/>
it will be handy, they don't, and so they move it.</p>
<p>They always put your other boots into inaccessible <lb/>
places. They chiefly enjoy depositing them as far <lb/>
under the bed as the wall will permit. It is because <lb/>
this compels you to get down in an undignified atti- <lb/>
tude and make wild sweeps for them in the dark <lb/>
with the bootjack, and swear.</p>
<p>They always put the matchbox in some other <lb/>
place. They hunt up a new place for it every day, <lb/>
and put up a bottle, or other perishable glass thing, <lb/>
where the box stood before. This is to cause you <lb/>
to break that glass thing, groping in the dark, and <lb/>
get yourself into trouble.</p>
<p>They are forever and ever moving the furniture. <lb/>
When you come in in the night you can calculate on <lb/>
finding the bureau where the wardrobe was in the <lb/>
morning. And when you go out in the morning, if <lb/>
you leave the slop-bucket by the door and rocking- <lb/>
chair by the window, when you come in at midnight <lb/>
or thereabout, you will fall over that rocking-chair, <lb/>
and you will proceed toward the window and sit <lb/>
down in that slop-tub This will disgust you. They <lb/>
like that.</p>
<p>No matter where you put anything, they are not <lb/>
going to let it stay there. They will take it and <lb/>
<pb n="332"/>
move it the first chance they get. It is their nature. <lb/>
And, besides, it gives them pleasure to be mean and <lb/>
contrary this way. They would die if they couldn't <lb/>
be villains.</p>
<p>They always save up all the old scraps of printed <lb/>
rubbish you throw on the floor, and stack them up <lb/>
carefully on the table, and start the fire with your <lb/>
valuable manuscripts. If there is any one particular <lb/>
old scrap that you are more down on than any other, <lb/>
and which you are gradually wearing your life out <lb/>
trying to get rid of, you may take all the pains you <lb/>
possibly can in that direction, but it won't be of any <lb/>
use, because they will always fetch that old scrap <lb/>
back and put it in the same old place again every <lb/>
time. It does them good.</p>
<p>And they use up more hair-oil than any six men. <lb/>
If charged with purloining the same, they lie about <lb/>
it. What do they care about a hereafter? Abso- <lb/>
lutely nothing.</p>
<p>If you leave the key in the door for convenience <lb/>
sake, they will carry it down to the office and give it <lb/>
to the clerk. They do this under the vile pretence <lb/>
of trying to protect your property from thieves; <lb/>
but actually they do it because they want to make <lb/>
you tramp back down stairs after it when you come <lb/>
home tired, or put you to the trouble of sending a <lb/>
waiter for it, which waiter will expect you to pay <lb/>
him something. In which case I suppose the de- <lb/>
graded creatures divide.</p>
<p>They keep always trying to make your bed before <lb/>
<pb n="333"/>
you get up, thus destroying your rest and inflicting <lb/>
agony upon you; but after you get up, they don't <lb/>
come any more till next day.</p>
<p>They do all the mean things they can think of, <lb/>
and they do them just out of pure cussedness, and <lb/>
nothing else.</p>
<p>Chambermaids are dead to every human instinct.</p>

<head><b>AURELIA'S UNFORTUNATE YOUNG <lb/>
MAN</b><ref target="n37">*</ref><note id="n37" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1865.</p></note></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> facts in the following case came to me by <lb/>
letter from a young lady who lives in the <lb/>
beautiful city of San Jos&#x00E9;; she is perfectly unknown <lb/>
to me, and simply signs herself "Aurelia Maria," <lb/>
which may possibly be a fictitious name. But no <lb/>
matter, the poor girl is almost heart-broken by the <lb/>
misfortunes she has undergone, and so confused by <lb/>
the conflicting counsels of misguided friends and <lb/>
insidious enemies, that she does not know what <lb/>
course to pursue in order to extricate herself from <lb/>
the web of difficulties in which she seems almost <lb/>
hopelessly involved. In this dilemma she turns to <lb/>
me for help, and supplicates for my guidance and <lb/>
instruction with a moving eloquence that would <lb/>
touch the heart of a statue. Hear her sad story:</p>
<p>She says that when she was sixteen years old she <lb/>
met and loved, with all the devotion of a passionate <lb/>
nature, a young man from New Jersey, named <lb/>
Williamson Breckinridge Caruthers, who was some <lb/>
six years her senior. They were engaged, with the <lb/>
free consent of their friends and relatives, and for a <lb/>
<pb n="335"/>
time it seemed as if their career was destined to be <lb/>
characterized by an immunity from sorrow beyond <lb/>
the usual lot of humanity. But at last the tide of <lb/>
fortune turned; young Caruthers became infected <lb/>
with smallpox of the most virulent type, and when <lb/>
he recovered from his illness his face was pitted like <lb/>
a waffle-mould, and his comeliness gone forever. <lb/>
Aurelia thought to break off the engagement at first, <lb/>
but pity for her unfortunate lover caused her to <lb/>
postpone the marriage-day for a season, and give <lb/>
him another trial.</p>
<p>The very day before the wedding was to have <lb/>
taken place, Breckinridge, while absorbed in watch- <lb/>
ing the flight of a balloon, walked into a well and <lb/>
fractured one of his legs, and it had to be taken off <lb/>
above the knee. Again Aurelia was moved to break <lb/>
the engagement, but again love triumphed, and she <lb/>
set the day forward and gave him another chance to <lb/>
reform.</p>
<p>And again misfortune overtook the unhappy <lb/>
youth. He lost one arm by the premature discharge <lb/>
of a Fourth of July cannon, and within three months <lb/>
he got the other pulled out by a carding-machine. <lb/>
Aurelia's heart was almost crushed by these latter <lb/>
calamities. She could not but be deeply grieved to <lb/>
see her lover passing from her by piecemeal, feeling, <lb/>
as she did, that he could not last forever under this <lb/>
disastrous process of reduction, yet knowing of no <lb/>
way to stop its dreadful career, and in her tearful <lb/>
despair she almost regretted, like brokers who hold <lb/>
<pb n="336"/>
on and lose, that she had not taken him at first, <lb/>
before he had suffered such an alarming deprecia- <lb/>
tion. Still, her brave soul bore her up, and she re- <lb/>
solved to bear with her friend's unnatural disposition <lb/>
yet a little longer.</p>
<p>Again the wedding-day approached, and again <lb/>
disappointment overshadowed it; Caruthers fell ill <lb/>
with the erysipelas, and lost the use of one of his <lb/>
eyes entirely. The friends and relatives of the <lb/>
bride, considering that she had already put up with <lb/>
more than could reasonably be expected of her, <lb/>
now came forward and insisted that the match <lb/>
should be broken off; but after wavering a while, <lb/>
Aurelia, with a generous spirit which did her credit, <lb/>
said she had reflected calmly upon the matter, and <lb/>
could not discover that Breckinridge was to blame.</p>
<p>So she extended the time once more, and he <lb/>
broke his other leg.</p>
<p>It was a sad day for the poor girl when she saw <lb/>
the surgeons reverently bearing away the sack whose <lb/>
uses she had learned by previous experience, and <lb/>
her heart told her the bitter truth that some more of <lb/>
her lover was gone. She felt that the field of her <lb/>
affections was growing more and more circumscribed <lb/>
every day, but once more she frowned down her <lb/>
relatives and renewed her betrothal.</p>
<p>Shortly before the time set for the nuptials <lb/>
another disaster occurred. There was but one man <lb/>
scalped by the Owens River Indians last year. That <lb/>
man was Williamson Breckinridge Caruthers of New <lb/>
<pb n="337"/>
Jersey. He was hurrying home with happiness in <lb/>
his heart, when he lost his hair forever, and in that <lb/>
hour of bitterness he almost cursed the mistaken <lb/>
mercy that had spared his head.</p>
<p>At last Aurelia is in serious perplexity as to what <lb/>
she ought to do. She still loves her Breckinridge, <lb/>
she writes, with truly womanly feeling&#x2014;she still <lb/>
loves what is left of him&#x2014;but her parents are <lb/>
bitterly opposed to the match, because he has no <lb/>
property and is disabled from working, and she has <lb/>
not sufficient means to support both comfortably. <lb/>
"Now, what should she do?" she asks with painful <lb/>
and anxious solicitude.</p>
<p>It is a delicate question; it is one which involves <lb/>
the lifelong happiness of a woman, and that of <lb/>
nearly two-thirds of a man, and I feel that it would <lb/>
be assuming too great a responsibility to do more <lb/>
than make a mere suggestion in the case. How <lb/>
would it do to build to him? If Aurelia can afford <lb/>
the expense, let her furnish her mutilated lover with <lb/>
wooden arms and wooden legs, and a glass eye and <lb/>
a wig, and give him another show; give him ninety <lb/>
days, without grace, and if he does not break his neck <lb/>
in the meantime, marry him and take the chances. <lb/>
It does not seem to me that there is much risk, any- <lb/>
way, Aurelia, because if he sticks to his singular <lb/>
propensity for damaging himself every time he sees <lb/>
a good opportunity, his next experiment is bound <lb/>
to finish him, and then you are safe, married or <lb/>
single. If married, the wooden legs and such other <lb/>
<pb n="338"/>
valuables as he may possess revert to the widow, and <lb/>
you see you sustain no actual loss save the cherished <lb/>
fragment of a noble but most unfortunate husband, <lb/>
who honestly strove to do right, but whose extraor- <lb/>
dinary instincts were against him. Try it, Maria. <lb/>
I have thought the matter over carefully and well, <lb/>
and it is the only chance I see for you. It would <lb/>
have been a happy conceit on the part of Caruthers <lb/>
if he had started with his neck and broken that first; <lb/>
but since he has seen fit to choose a different policy <lb/>
and string himself out as long as possible, I do not <lb/>
think we ought to upbraid him for it if he has en- <lb/>
joyed it. We must do the best we can under the <lb/>
circumstances, and try not to feel exasperated at <lb/>
him.</p>

<head><b>"AFTER" JENKINS</b></head>
<p><smcap>A grand</smcap> affair of a ball&#x2014;the Pioneers'&#x2014;came <lb/>
off at the Occidental some time ago. The fol- <lb/>
lowing notes of the costumes worn by the belles of <lb/>
the occasion may not be uninteresting to the general <lb/>
reader, and Jenkins may get an idea therefrom:</p>
<p>Mrs. W. M. was attired in an elegant <i>p&#x00E2;t&#x00E9; de foie <lb/>
gras</i>, made expressly for her, and was greatly ad- <lb/>
mired. Miss S. had her hair done up. She was <lb/>
the center of attraction for the gentlemen and the <lb/>
envy of all the ladies. Mrs. G. W. was tastefully <lb/>
dressed in a <i>tout ensemble</i>, and was greeted with <lb/>
<pb n="339"/>
deafening applause wherever she went. Mrs. C. N. <lb/>
was superbly arrayed in white kid gloves. Her <lb/>
modest and engaging manner accorded well with the <lb/>
unpretending simplicity of her costume and caused <lb/>
her to be regarded with absorbing interest by every <lb/>
one.</p>
<p>The charming Miss M. M. B. appeared in a thrill- <lb/>
ing waterfall, whose exceeding grace and volume <lb/>
compelled the homage of pioneers and emigrants <lb/>
alike. How beautiful she was!</p>
<p>The queenly Mrs. L. R. was attractively attired in <lb/>
her new and beautiful false teeth, and the <i>bon jour</i> <lb/>
effect they naturally produced was heightened by <lb/>
her enchanting and well-sustained smile.</p>
<p>Miss R. P., with that repugnance to ostentation <lb/>
in dress which is so peculiar to her, was attired in a <lb/>
simple white lace collar, fastened with a neat pearl- <lb/>
button solitaire. The fine contrast between the <lb/>
sparkling vivacity of her natural optic, and the <lb/>
steadfast attentiveness of her placid glass eye, was <lb/>
the subject of general and enthusiastic remark.</p>
<p>Miss C. L. B. had her fine nose elegantly enameled, <lb/>
and the easy grace with which she blew it from time <lb/>
to time marked her as a cultivated and accomplished <lb/>
woman of the world; its exquisitely modulated tone <lb/>
excited the admiration of all who had the happiness <lb/>

<head><b>ABOUT BARBERS</b></head>
<p><smcap>All</smcap> things change except barbers, the ways of <lb/>
barbers, and the surroundings of barbers. <lb/>
These never change. What one experiences in a <lb/>
barber's shop the first time he enters one is what he <lb/>
always experiences in barbers' shops afterward till <lb/>
the end of his days. I got shaved this morning as <lb/>
usual. A man approached the door from Jones <lb/>
street as I approached it from Main&#x2014;a thing that <lb/>
always happens. I hurried up, but it was of no <lb/>
use; he entered the door one little step ahead of <lb/>
me, and I followed in on his heels and saw him take <lb/>
the only vacant chair, the one presided over by the <lb/>
best barber. It always happens so. I sat down, <lb/>
hoping that I might fall heir to the chair belonging <lb/>
to the better of the remaining two barbers, for he <lb/>
had already begun combing his man's hair, while <lb/>
his comrade was not yet quite done rubbing up and <lb/>
oiling his customer's locks. I watched the proba- <lb/>
bilities with strong interest. When I saw that No. 2 <lb/>
was gaining on No. 1 my interest grew to solicitude. <lb/>
When No. 1 stopped a moment to make change on <lb/>
a bath ticket for a new comer, and lost ground in <lb/>
<pb n="341"/>
the race, my solicitude rose to anxiety. When No <lb/>
I caught up again, and both he and his comrade <lb/>
were pulling the towels away and brushing the <lb/>
powder from their customer's cheeks, and it was <lb/>
about an even thing which one would say "Next!" <lb/>
first, my very breath stood still with the suspense. <lb/>
But when at the culminating moment No. 1 stopped <lb/>
to pass a comb a couple of times through his <lb/>
customer's eyebrows, I saw that he had lost the race <lb/>
by a single instant, and I rose indignant and quitted <lb/>
the shop, to keep from falling into the hands of No. <lb/>
2; for I have none of that enviable firmness that <lb/>
enables a man to look calmly into the eyes of a wait- <lb/>
ing barber and tell him he will wait for his fellow- <lb/>
barber's chair.</p>
<p>I stayed out fifteen minutes, and then went back, <lb/>
hoping for better luck. Of course all the chairs <lb/>
were occupied now, and four men sat waiting, silent, <lb/>
unsociable, distraught, and looking bored, as men <lb/>
always do who are waiting their turn in a barber's <lb/>
shop. I sat down in one of the iron-armed compart- <lb/>
ments of an old sofa, and put in the time for a while <lb/>
reading the framed advertisements of all sorts of <lb/>
quack nostrums for dyeing and coloring the hair. <lb/>
Then I read the greasy names on the private bay- <lb/>
rum bottles; read the names and noted the numbers <lb/>
on the private shaving cups in the pigeon-holes; <lb/>
studied the stained and damaged cheap prints on the <lb/>
walls, of battles, early Presidents, and voluptuous <lb/>
recumbent sultanas, and the tiresome and everlasting <lb/>
<pb n="342"/>
young girl putting her grandfather's spectacles on; <lb/>
execrated in my heart the cheerful canary and the <lb/>
distracting parrot that few barbers' shops are with- <lb/>
out. Finally, I searched out the least dilapidated of <lb/>
last year's illustrated papers that littered the foul <lb/>
center-table, and conned their unjustifiable misrepre- <lb/>
sentations of old forgotten events.</p>
<p>At last my turn came. A voice said "Next!" <lb/>
and I surrendered to&#x2014;No. 2, of course. It always <lb/>
happens so. I said meekly that I was in a hurry, <lb/>
and it affected him as strongly as if he had never <lb/>
heard it. He shoved up my head, and put a napkin <lb/>
under it. He plowed his fingers into my collar and <lb/>
fixed a towel there. He explored my hair with his <lb/>
claws and suggested that it needed trimming. I <lb/>
said I did not want it trimmed. He explored again <lb/>
and said it was pretty long for the present style&#x2014; <lb/>
better have a little taken off; it needed it behind <lb/>
especially. I said I had had it cut only a week <lb/>
before. He yearned over it reflectively a moment, <lb/>
and then asked with a disparaging manner, who cut <lb/>
it? I came back at him promptly with a "You <lb/>
did!" I had him there. Then he fell to stirring <lb/>
up his lather and regarding himself in the glass, <lb/>
stopping now and then to get close and examine his <lb/>
chin critically or inspect a pimple. Then he lathered <lb/>
one side of my face thoroughly, and was about to <lb/>
lather the other, when a dog fight attracted his atten- <lb/>
tion, and he ran to the window and stayed and saw <lb/>
it out, losing two shillings on the result in bets with <lb/>
<pb n="343"/>
the other barbers, a thing which gave me great satis- <lb/>
faction. He finished lathering, and then began to <lb/>
rub in the suds with his hand.</p>
<p>He now began to sharpen his razor on an old <lb/>
suspender, and was delayed a good deal on account <lb/>
of a controversy about a cheap masquerade ball he <lb/>
had figured at the night before, in red cambric and <lb/>
bogus ermine, as some kind of a king. He was so <lb/>
gratified with being chaffed about some damsel <lb/>
whom he had smitten with his charms that he used <lb/>
every means to continue the controversy by pretend- <lb/>
ing to be annoyed at the chaffings of his fellows. <lb/>
This matter begot more surveyings of himself in the <lb/>
glass, and he put down his razor and brushed his <lb/>
hair with elaborate care, plastering an inverted arch <lb/>
of it down on his forehead, accomplishing an accu- <lb/>
rate "part" behind, and brushing the two wings <lb/>
forward over his ears with nice exactness. In the <lb/>
meantime the lather was drying on my face, and <lb/>
apparently eating into my vitals.</p>
<p>Now he began to shave, digging his fingers into <lb/>
my countenance to stretch the skin and bundling <lb/>
and tumbling my head this way and that as con- <lb/>
venience in shaving demanded. As long as he was <lb/>
on the tough sides of my face I did not suffer; but <lb/>
when he began to rake, and rip, and tug at my chin, <lb/>
the tears came. He now made a handle of my nose, <lb/>
to assist him in shaving the corners of my upper lip, <lb/>
and it was by this bit of circumstantial evidence that <lb/>
I discovered that a part of his duties in the shop <lb/>
<pb n="344"/>
was to clean the kerosene lamps. I had often won- <lb/>
dered in an indolent way whether the barbers did <lb/>
that, or whether it was the boss.</p>
<p>About this time I was amusing myself trying to <lb/>
guess where he would be most likely to cut me this <lb/>
time, but he got ahead of me, and sliced me on the <lb/>
end of the chin before I had got my mind made up. <lb/>
He immediately sharpened his razor&#x2014;he might <lb/>
have done it before. I do not like a close shave, <lb/>
and would not let him go over me a second time. I <lb/>
tried to get him to put up his razor, dreading that <lb/>
he would make for the side of my chin, my pet <lb/>
tender spot, a place which a razor cannot touch <lb/>
twice without making trouble; but he said he only <lb/>
wanted to just smooth off one little roughness, and <lb/>
in the same moment he slipped his razor along the <lb/>
forbidden ground, and the dreaded pimple-signs of a <lb/>
close shave rose up smarting and answered to the <lb/>
call. Now he soaked his towel in bay rum, and <lb/>
slapped it all over my face nastily; slapped it over <lb/>
as if a human being ever yet washed his face in that <lb/>
way. Then he dried it by slapping with the dry <lb/>
part of the towel, as if a human being ever dried his <lb/>
face in such a fashion; but a barber seldom rubs you <lb/>
like a Christian. Next he poked bay rum into the <lb/>
cut place with his towel, then choked the wound <lb/>
with powered starch, then soaked it with bay rum <lb/>
again, and would have gone on soaking and powder- <lb/>
ing it forevermore, no doubt, if I had not rebelled <lb/>
and begged off. He powdered my whole face now, <lb/>
<pb n="345"/>
straightened me up, and began to plow my hair <lb/>
thoughtfully with his hands. Then he suggested a <lb/>
shampoo, and said my hair needed it badly, very <lb/>
badly. I observed that I shampooed it myself very <lb/>
thoroughly in the bath yesterday. I "had him" <lb/>
again. He next recommended some of "Smith's <lb/>
Hair Glorifier," and offered to sell me a bottle. I <lb/>
declined. He praised the new perfume, "Jones's <lb/>
Delight of the Toilet," and proposed to sell me <lb/>
some of that. I declined again. He tendered me a <lb/>
toothwash atrocity of his own invention, and when I <lb/>
declined offered to trade knives with me.</p>
<p>He returned to business after the miscarriage of <lb/>
this last enterprise, sprinkled me all over, legs and <lb/>
all, greased my hair in defiance of my protest against <lb/>
it, rubbed and scrubbed a good deal of it out by the <lb/>
roots, and combed and brushed the rest, parting it <lb/>
behind, and plastering the eternal inverted arch of <lb/>
hair down on my forehead, and then, while combing <lb/>
my scant eyebrows and defiling them with pomade, <lb/>
strung out an account of the achievements of a six- <lb/>
ounce black and tan terrier of his till I heard the <lb/>
whistles blow for noon, and knew I was five minutes <lb/>
too late for the train. Then he snatched away the <lb/>
towel, brushed it lightly about my face, passed his <lb/>
comb through my eyebrows once more, and gaily <lb/>
sang out "Next!"</p>
<p>This barber fell down and died of apoplexy two <lb/>
hours later. I am waiting over a day for my re- <lb/>
venge&#x2014;I am going to attend his funeral.</p>

<head><b>"PARTY CRIES" IN IRELAND</b></head>
<p><smcap>Belfast</smcap> is a peculiarly religious community. <lb/>
This may be said of the whole of the North of <lb/>
Ireland. About one-half of the people are Protes- <lb/>
tants and the other half Catholics. Each party does <lb/>
all it can to make its own doctrines popular and <lb/>
draw the affections of the irreligious toward them. <lb/>
One hears constantly of the most touching instances <lb/>
of this zeal. A week ago a vast concourse of Cath- <lb/>
olics assembled at Armagh to dedicate a new <lb/>
Cathedral; and when they started home again the <lb/>
roadways were lined with groups of meek and lowly <lb/>
Protestants who stoned them till all the region round <lb/>
about was marked with blood. I thought that only <lb/>
Catholics argued in that way, but it seems to be a <lb/>
mistake.</p>
<p>Every man in the community is a missionary and <lb/>
carries a brick to admonish the erring with. The <lb/>
law has tried to break this up, but not with perfect <lb/>
success. It has decreed that irritating "party cries" <lb/>
shall not be indulged in, and that persons uttering <lb/>
them shall be fined forty shillings and costs. And <lb/>
so, in the police court reports every day, one sees <lb/>
<pb n="347"/>
these fines recorded. Last week a girl twelve years <lb/>
old was fined the usual forty shillings and costs for <lb/>
proclaiming in the public streets that she was "a <lb/>
Protestant." The usual cry is, "To hell with the <lb/>
Pope!" or "To hell with the Protestants!" accord- <lb/>
ing to the utterer's system of salvation.</p>
<p>One of Belfast's local jokes was very good. It <lb/>
referred to the uniform and inevitable fine of forty <lb/>
shillings and costs for uttering a party cry&#x2014;and it <lb/>
is no economical fine for a poor man, either, by the <lb/>
way. They say that a policeman found a drunken <lb/>
man lying on the ground, up a dark alley, entertain- <lb/>
ing himself with shouting, "To <i>hell</i> with!" "To <lb/>
<i>hell</i> with!" The officer smelt a fine&#x2014;informers <lb/>
get half.</p>
<p>"What's that you say?"</p>
<p>"To <i>hell</i> with!"</p>
<p>"To hell with <i>who?</i> To hell with <i>what?"</i></p>
<p>"Ah, bedad ye can finish it yourself&#x2014;it's too <lb/>
expinsive for me!"</p>
<p>I think the seditious disposition, restrained by the <lb/>
economical instinct, is finely put in that.</p>

<p><smcap>I have</smcap> resigned. The Government appears to go <lb/>
on much the same, but there is a spoke out of <lb/>
its wheel, nevertheless. I was clerk of the Senate <lb/>
Committee on Conchology, and I have thrown up <lb/>
the position. I could see the plainest disposition on <lb/>
the part of the other members of the Government to <lb/>
debar me from having any voice in the counsels of <lb/>
the nation, and so I could no longer hold office and <lb/>
retain my self-respect. If I were to detail all the <lb/>
outrages that were heaped upon me during the six <lb/>
days that I was connected with the Government in <lb/>
an official capacity, the narrative would fill a volume. <lb/>
They appointed me clerk of that Committee on <lb/>
Conchology, and then allowed me no amanuensis to <lb/>

to set him right, as it was my duty to do; and I <lb/>
never was thanked for it in a single instance. I <lb/>
went, with the best intentions in the world, to the <lb/>
Secretary of the Navy, and said:</p>
<p>"Sir, I cannot see that Admiral Farragut is doing <lb/>
anything but skirmishing around there in Europe, <lb/>
having a sort of picnic. Now, that may be all very <lb/>
well, but it does not exhibit itself to me in that light. <lb/>
If there is no fighting for him to do, let him come <lb/>
home. There is no use in a man having a whole <lb/>
fleet for a pleasure excursion. It is too expensive. <lb/>
Mind, I do not object to pleasure excursions for <lb/>
the naval officers&#x2014;pleasure excursions that are in <lb/>
reason&#x2014;pleasure excursions that are economical. <lb/>
Now they might go down the Mississippi on a <lb/>
raft&#x2014;"</p>
<p>You ought to have heard him storm! One would <lb/>
have supposed I had committed a crime of some <lb/>
kind. But I didn't mind. I said it was cheap, and <lb/>
full of republican simplicity, and perfectly safe. I <lb/>
said that, for a tranquil pleasure excursion, there <lb/>
was nothing equal to a raft.</p>
<p>Then the Secretary of the Navy asked me who I <lb/>
was; and when I told him I was connected with the <lb/>
Government, he wanted to know in what capacity. <lb/>
I said that, without remarking upon the singularity <lb/>
of such a question, coming, as it did, from a mem- <lb/>
ber of that same Government, I would inform him <lb/>
that I was clerk of the Senate Committee on Con- <lb/>
<pb n="350"/>
chology. Then there was a fine storm! He finished <lb/>
by ordering me to leave the premises, and give my <lb/>
attention strictly to my own business in future. My <lb/>
first impulse was to get him removed. However, <lb/>
that would harm others beside himself, and do me <lb/>
no real good, and so I let him stay.</p>
<p>I went next to the Secretary of War, who was not <lb/>
inclined to see me at all until he learned that I was <lb/>
connected with the Government. If I had not been <lb/>
on important business, I suppose I could not have <lb/>
got in. I asked him for a light (he was smoking at <lb/>
the time), and then I told him I had no fault to find <lb/>
with his defending the parole stipulations of General <lb/>
Lee and his comrades in arms, but that I could not <lb/>
approve of his method of fighting the Indians on the <lb/>
Plains. I said he fought too scattering. He ought <lb/>
to get the Indians more together&#x2014;get them together <lb/>
in some convenient place, where he could have pro- <lb/>
visions enough for both parties, and then have a <lb/>
general massacre. I said there was nothing so con- <lb/>
vincing to an Indian as a general massacre. If he <lb/>
could not approve of the massacre, I said the next <lb/>
surest thing for an Indian was soap and education. <lb/>
Soap and education are not as sudden as a massacre, <lb/>
but they are more deadly in the long run; because a <lb/>
half-massacred Indian may recover, but if you edu- <lb/>
cate him and wash him, it is bound to finish him <lb/>
some time or other. It undermines his constitution; <lb/>
it strikes at the foundation of his being. "Sir," I <lb/>
said, "the time has come when blood-curdling <lb/>
<pb n="351"/>
cruelty has become necessary. Inflict soap and a <lb/>
spelling-book on every Indian that ravages the <lb/>
Plains, and let them die!"</p>
<p>The Secretary of War asked me if I was a member <lb/>
of the Cabinet, and I said I was. He inquired what <lb/>
position I held, and I said I was clerk of the Senate <lb/>
Committee on Conchology. I was then ordered <lb/>
under arrest for contempt of court, and restrained <lb/>
of my liberty for the best part of the day.</p>
<p>I almost resolved to be silent thenceforward, and <lb/>
let the Government get along the best way it could. <lb/>
But duty called, and I obeyed. I called on the <lb/>
Secretary of the Treasury. He said:</p>
<p>"What will <i>you</i> have?"</p>
<p>The question threw me off my guard. I said, <lb/>
"Rum punch."</p>
<p>He said: "If you have got any business here, <lb/>
sir, state it&#x2014;and in as few words as possible."</p>
<p>I then said that I was sorry he had seen fit to <lb/>
change the subject so abruptly, because such con- <lb/>
duct was very offensive to me; but under the cir- <lb/>
cumstances I would overlook the matter and come <lb/>
to the point. I now went into an earnest expostu- <lb/>
lation with him upon the extravagant length of his <lb/>
report. I said it was expensive, unnecessary, and <lb/>
awkwardly constructed; there were no descriptive <lb/>
passages in it, no poetry, no sentiment&#x2014;no heroes, <lb/>
no plot, no pictures&#x2014;not even woodcuts. Nobody <lb/>
would read it, that was a clear case. I urged him <lb/>
not to ruin his reputation by getting out a thing like <lb/>
<pb n="352"/>
that. If he ever hoped to succeed in literature, he <lb/>
must throw more variety into his writings. He <lb/>
must beware of dry detail. I said that the main <lb/>
popularity of the almanac was derived from its <lb/>
poetry and conundrums, and that a few conundrums <lb/>
distributed around through his Treasury report <lb/>
would help the sale of it more than all the internal <lb/>
revenue he could put into it. I said these things in <lb/>
the kindest spirit, and yet the Secretary of the <lb/>
Treasury fell into a violent passion. He even said <lb/>
I was an ass. He abused me in the most vindictive <lb/>
manner, and said that if I came there again meddling <lb/>
with his business, he would throw me out of the <lb/>
window. I said I would take my hat and go, if I <lb/>
could not be treated with the respect due to my <lb/>
office, and I did go. It was just like a new author. <lb/>
They always think they know more than anybody <lb/>
else when they are getting out their first book. <lb/>
Nobody can tell <i>them</i> anything.</p>
<p>During the whole time that I was connected <lb/>
with the Government it seemed as if I could not <lb/>
do anything in an official capacity without getting <lb/>
myself into trouble. And yet I did nothing, at- <lb/>
tempted nothing, but what I conceived to be for <lb/>
the good of my country. The sting of my wrongs <lb/>
may have driven me to unjust and harmful conclu- <lb/>
sions, but it surely seemed to me that the Secretary <lb/>
of State, the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the <lb/>
Treasury, and others of my <i>confr&#x00E8;res</i>, had conspired <lb/>
from the very beginning to drive me from the Ad- <lb/>
<pb n="353"/>
ministration. I never attended but one Cabinet <lb/>
meeting while I was connected with the Govern- <lb/>
ment. That was sufficient for me. The servant at <lb/>
the White House door did not seem disposed to <lb/>
make way for me until I asked if the other members <lb/>
of the Cabinet had arrived. He said they had, and <lb/>
I entered. They were all there; but nobody offered <lb/>
me a seat. They stared at me as if I had been an <lb/>
intruder. The President said:</p>
<p>"Well, sir, who are <i>you?</i>"</p>
<p>I handed him my card, and he read: "The <smcap>Hon. <lb/>
Mark Twain</smcap>, Clerk of the Senate Committee on <lb/>
Conchology." Then he looked at me from head to <lb/>
foot, as if he had never heard of me before. The <lb/>
Secretary of the Treasury said:</p>
<p>"This is the meddlesome ass that came to recom- <lb/>
mend me to put poetry and conundrums in my re- <lb/>
port, as if it were an almanac."</p>
<p>The Secretary of War said: "It is the same <lb/>
visionary that came to me yesterday with a scheme <lb/>
to educate a portion of the Indians to death, and <lb/>
massacre the balance."</p>
<p>The Secretary of the Navy said: "I recognize <lb/>
this youth as the person who has been interfering <lb/>
with my business time and again during the week. <lb/>
He is distressed about Admiral Farragut's using a <lb/>
whole fleet for a pleasure excursion, as he terms it. <lb/>
His proposition about some insane pleasure excur- <lb/>
sion on a raft is too absurd to repeat."</p>
<p>I said: "Gentlemen, I perceive here a disposition <lb/>
<pb n="354"/>
to throw discredit upon every act of my official <lb/>
career; I perceive, also, a disposition to debar me <lb/>
from all voice in the counsels of the nation. No <lb/>
notice whatever was sent to me to-day. It was only <lb/>
by the merest chance that I learned that there was <lb/>
going to be a Cabinet meeting. But let these things <lb/>
pass. All I wish to know is, is this a Cabinet meet- <lb/>
ing or is it not?"</p>
<p>The President said it was.</p>
<p>"Then," I said, "let us proceed to business at <lb/>
once, and not fritter away valuable time in unbe- <lb/>
coming fault-findings with each other's official con- <lb/>
duct."</p>
<p>The Secretary of State now spoke up, in his be- <lb/>
nignant way, and said, "Young man, you are labor- <lb/>
ing under a mistake. The clerks of the Congressional <lb/>
committees are not members of the Cabinet. Neither <lb/>
are the doorkeepers of the Capitol, strange as it may <lb/>
seem. Therefore, much as we could desire your <lb/>
more than human wisdom in our deliberations, we <lb/>
cannot lawfully avail ourselves of it. The counsels <lb/>
of the nation must proceed without you; if disaster <lb/>
follows, as follow full well it may, be it balm to <lb/>
your sorrowing spirit, that by deed and voice you <lb/>
did what in you lay to avert it. You have my <lb/>
blessing. Farewell."</p>
<p>These gentle words soothed my troubled breast, <lb/>
and I went away. But the servants of a nation can <lb/>
know no peace. I had hardly reached my den in <lb/>
the Capitol, and disposed my feet on the table like <lb/>
<pb n="355"/>
a representative, when one of the Senators on the <lb/>
Conchological Committee came in in a passion and <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Where have you been all day?"</p>
<p>I observed that, if that was anybody's affair but <lb/>
my own, I had been to a Cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>"To a Cabinet meeting? I would like to know <lb/>
what business you had at a Cabinet meeting?"</p>
<p>I said I went there to consult&#x2014;allowing for the <lb/>
sake of argument that he was in anywise concerned <lb/>
in the matter. He grew insolent then, and ended <lb/>
by saying he had wanted me for three days past to <lb/>
copy a report on bomb-shells, egg-shells, clam- <lb/>
shells, and I don't know what all, connected with <lb/>
conchology, and nobody had been able to find me.</p>
<p>This was too much. This was the feather that <lb/>
broke the clerical camel's back. I said, "Sir, do <lb/>
you suppose that I am going to <i>work</i> for six dollars <lb/>
a day? If that is the idea, let me recommend the <lb/>
Senate Committee on Conchology to hire somebody <lb/>
else. I am the slave of <i>no</i> faction! Take back <lb/>
your degrading commission. Give me liberty, or <lb/>
give me death!"</p>
<p>From that hour I was no longer connected with <lb/>
the Government. Snubbed by the department, <lb/>
snubbed by the Cabinet, snubbed at last by the <lb/>
chairman of a committee I was endeavoring to <lb/>
adorn, I yielded to persecution, cast far from me <lb/>
the perils and seductions of my great office, and <lb/>
forsook my bleeding country in the hour of her peril.</p>
<pb n="356"/>
<p>But I had done the State some service, and I sent <lb/>
in my bill:</p>

<p>Not an item of this bill has been paid, except that <lb/>
trifle of thirty-six dollars for clerkship salary. The <lb/>
Secretary of the Treasury, pursuing me to the last, <lb/>
drew his pen through all the other items, and simply <lb/>
marked in the margin "Not allowed." So, the <lb/>
dread alternative is embraced at last. Repudiation <lb/>
has begun! The nation is lost.</p>
<p>I am done with official life for the present. Let <lb/>
those clerks who are willing to be imposed on re- <lb/>
main. I know numbers of them in the departments <lb/>
who are never informed when there is to be a <lb/>
Cabinet meeting, whose advice is never asked about <lb/>
war, or finance, or commerce, by the heads of the <lb/>
nation, any more than if they were not connected <lb/>
with the Government, and who actually stay in their <lb/>
<pb n="357"/>
offices day after day and work! They know their <lb/>
importance to the nation, and they unconsciously <lb/>
show it in their bearing, and the way they order <lb/>
their sustenance at the restaurant&#x2014;but they work. <lb/>
I know one who has to paste all sorts of little scraps <lb/>
from the newspaper into a scrapbook&#x2014;sometimes <lb/>
as many as eight or ten scraps a day. He doesn't <lb/>
do it well, but he does it as well as he can. It is <lb/>
very fatiguing. It is exhausting to the intellect. <lb/>
Yet he only gets eighteen hundred dollars a year. <lb/>
With a brain like his, that young man could amass <lb/>
thousands and thousands of dollars in some other <lb/>
pursuit, if he chose to do it. But no&#x2014;his heart is <lb/>
with his country, and he will serve her as long as <lb/>
she has got a scrapbook left. And I know clerks <lb/>
that don't know how to write very well, but such <lb/>
knowledge as they possess they nobly lay at the feet <lb/>
of their country, and toil on and suffer for twenty- <lb/>
five hundred dollars a year. What they write has <lb/>
to be written over again by other clerks sometimes; <lb/>
but when a man has done his best for his country, <lb/>
should his country complain? Then there are clerks <lb/>
that have no clerkships, and are waiting, and waiting, <lb/>
and waiting, for a vacancy&#x2014;waiting patiently for a <lb/>
chance to help their country out&#x2014;and while they <lb/>
are waiting, they only get barely two thousand dol- <lb/>
lars a year for it. It is sad&#x2014;it is very, very sad. <lb/>
When a member of Congress has a friend who is <lb/>
gifted, but has no employment wherein his great <lb/>
powers may be brought to bear, he confers him <lb/>
<pb n="358"/>
upon his country, and gives him a clerkship in a <lb/>
department. And there that man has to slave his <lb/>
life out, fighting documents for the benefit of a <lb/>
nation that never thinks of him, never sympathizes <lb/>
with him&#x2014;and all for two thousand or three thou- <lb/>
sand dollars a year. When I shall have completed <lb/>
my list of all the clerks in the several departments, <lb/>
with my statement of what they have to do, and <lb/>
what they get for it, you will see that there are not <lb/>
half enough clerks, and that what there are do not <lb/>
get half enough pay.</p>

<head><b>HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> following I find in a Sandwich Island paper <lb/>
which some friend has sent me from that <lb/>
tranquil far-off retreat. The coincidence between <lb/>
my own experience and that here set down by the <lb/>
late Mr. Benton is so remarkable that I cannot for- <lb/>
bear publishing and commenting upon the para- <lb/>
graph. The Sandwich Island paper says: <lb/>
<q>"How touching is this tribute of the late Hon. T. H. Benton to his <lb/>
mother's influence:&#x2014;'My mother asked me never to use tobacco; I <lb/>
have never touched it from that time to the present day. She asked me <lb/>
not to gamble, and I have never gambled. I cannot tell who is losing <lb/>
in games that are being played. She admonished me, too, against <lb/>
liquor-drinking, and whatever capacity for endurance I have at present, <lb/>
and whatever usefulness I may have attained through life, I attribute to <lb/>
having complied with her pious and correct wishes. When I was seven <lb/>
years of age she asked me not to drink, and then I made a resolution of <lb/>
total abstinence; and that I have adhered to it through all time I owe <lb/>
to my mother.'"</q></p>
<p>I never saw anything so curious. It is almost an <lb/>
exact epitome of my own moral career&#x2014;after sim- <lb/>
ply substituting a grandmother for a mother. How <lb/>
well I remember my grandmother's asking me not <lb/>
to use tobacco, good old soul! She said, "You're <lb/>
at it again, are you, you whelp? Now don't ever <lb/>
<pb n="360"/>
let me catch you chewing tobacco before breakfast <lb/>
again, or I lay I'll blacksnake you within an inch of <lb/>
your life!" I have never touched it at that hour of <lb/>
the morning from that time to the present day.</p>
<p>She asked me not to gamble. She whispered <lb/>
and said, "Put up those wicked cards this minute! <lb/>
&#x2014;two pair and a jack, you numskull, and the other <lb/>
fellow's got a flush!"</p>
<p>I never have gambled from that day to this&#x2014; <lb/>
never once&#x2014;without a "cold deck" in my pocket. <lb/>
I cannot even tell who is going to lose in games that <lb/>
are being played unless I dealt myself.</p>
<p>When I was two years of age she asked me not <lb/>
to drink, and then I made a resolution of total <lb/>
abstinence. That I have adhered to it and enjoyed <lb/>
the beneficent effects of it through all time, I owe to <lb/>
my grandmother. I have never drunk a drop from <lb/>
that day to this of any kind of water.</p>

<p><smcap>If</smcap> you get into conversation with a stranger in <lb/>
Honolulu, and experience that natural desire to <lb/>
know what sort of ground you are treading on by <lb/>
finding out what manner of man your stranger is, <lb/>
strike out boldly and address him as "Captain." <lb/>
Watch him narrowly, and if you see by his counte- <lb/>
nance that you are on the wrong track, ask him <lb/>
where he preaches. It is a safe bet that he is either <lb/>
a missionary or captain of a whaler. I became per- <lb/>
sonally acquainted with seventy-two captains and <lb/>
ninety-six missionaries. The captains and ministers <lb/>
form one-half of the population; the third fourth is <lb/>
composed of common Kanakas and mercantile <lb/>
foreigners and their families; and the final fourth <lb/>
is made up of high officers of the Hawaiian Govern- <lb/>
ment. And there are just about cats enough for <lb/>
three apiece all around.</p>
<p>A solemn stranger met me in the suburbs one <lb/>

<p>"Good morning, your reverence. Preach in the <lb/>

you come from?"</p>

<p>Here his feelings were too much for him, and he <lb/>

<head><b>FIRST INTERVIEW WITH ARTEMUS <lb/>
WARD</b><ref target="n40">*</ref><note id="n40" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1870.</p></note></head>
<p><smcap>I had</smcap> never seen him before. He brought letters <lb/>
of introduction from mutual friends in San Fran- <lb/>
cisco, and by invitation I breakfasted with him. It <lb/>
was almost religion, there in the silver mines, to <lb/>
precede such a meal with whisky cocktails. Artemus, <lb/>
with the true cosmopolitan instinct, always deferred <lb/>
to the customs of the country he was in, and so he <lb/>
ordered three of those abominations. Hingston was <lb/>
present. I said I would rather not drink a whisky <lb/>
cocktail. I said it would go right to my head, and <lb/>
confuse me so that I would be in a helpless tangle in <lb/>
ten minutes. I did not want to act like a lunatic <lb/>
before strangers. But Artemus gently insisted, and <lb/>
I drank the treasonable mixture under protest, and <lb/>
felt all the time that I was doing a thing I might be <lb/>
sorry for. In a minute or two I began to imagine <lb/>
that my ideas were clouded. I waited in great <lb/>
anxiety for the conversation to open, with a sort of <lb/>
vague hope that my understanding would prove <lb/>
clear, after all, and my misgivings groundless.</p>
<p>Artemus dropped an unimportant remark or two, <lb/>
<pb n="365"/>
and then assumed a look of superhuman earnestness, <lb/>
and made the following astounding speech. He <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Now there is one thing I ought to ask you about <lb/>
before I forget it. You have been here in Silver- <lb/>
land&#x2014;here in Nevada&#x2014;two or three years, and, <lb/>
of course, your position on the daily press has made <lb/>
it necessary for you to go down in the mines and <lb/>
examine them carefully in detail, and therefore you <lb/>
know all about the silver-mining business. Now <lb/>
what I want to get at is&#x2014;is, well, the way the <lb/>
deposits of ore are made, you know. For instance. <lb/>
Now, as I understand it, the vein which contains the <lb/>
silver is sandwiched in between casings of granite, <lb/>
and runs along the ground, and sticks up like a curb- <lb/>
stone. Well, take a vein forty feet thick, for ex- <lb/>
ample, or eighty, for that matter, or even a hundred <lb/>
&#x2014;say you go down on it with a shaft, straight <lb/>
down, you know, or with what you call 'incline,' <lb/>
maybe you go down five hundred feet, or maybe <lb/>
you don't go down but two hundred&#x2014;anyway you <lb/>
go down, and all the time this vein grows narrower, <lb/>
when the casings come nearer or approach each <lb/>
other, you may say&#x2014;that is, when they do ap- <lb/>
proach, which, of course, they do not always do, <lb/>
particularly in cases where the nature of the forma- <lb/>
tion is such that they stand apart wider than they <lb/>
otherwise would, and which geology has failed to <lb/>
account for, although everything in that science goes <lb/>
to prove that, all things being equal, it would if it <lb/>
<pb n="366"/>
did not, or would not certainly if it did, and then, <lb/>
of course, they are. Do not you think it is?"</p>
<p>I said to myself:</p>
<p>"Now I just knew how it would be&#x2014;that whisky <lb/>
cocktail has done the business for me; I don't <lb/>
understand any more than a clam."</p>
<p>And then I said aloud:</p>
<p>"I&#x2014;I&#x2014;that is&#x2014;if you don't mind, would <lb/>
you&#x2014;would you say that over again? I ought&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly, certainly! You see I am very <lb/>
unfamiliar with the subject, and perhaps I don't <lb/>
present my case clearly, but I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"No, no&#x2014;no, no&#x2014;you state it plain enough, <lb/>
but that cocktail has muddled me a little. But I <lb/>
will&#x2014;no, I do understand for that matter; but I <lb/>
would get the hang of it all the better if you went <lb/>
over it again&#x2014;and I'll pay better attention this <lb/>
time."</p>
<p>He said, "Why, what I was after was this."</p>
<p>[Here he became even more fearfully impressive <lb/>
than ever, and emphasized each particular point by <lb/>
checking it off on his finger ends.]</p>
<p>"This vein, or lode, or ledge, or whatever you <lb/>
call it, runs along between two layers of granite, just <lb/>
the same as if it were a sandwich. Very well. Now <lb/>
suppose you go down on that, say a thousand feet, <lb/>
or maybe twelve hundred (it don't really matter) <lb/>
before you drift, and then you start your drifts, <lb/>
some of them across the ledge, and others along the <lb/>
length of it, where the sulphurets&#x2014;I believe they <lb/>
<pb n="367"/>
call them sulphurets, though why they should, con- <lb/>
sidering that, so far as I can see, the main depen- <lb/>
dence of a miner does not so lie, as some suppose, <lb/>
but in which it cannot be successfully maintained, <lb/>
wherein the same should not continue, while part <lb/>
and parcel of the same ore not committed to either <lb/>
in the sense referred to, whereas, under different <lb/>
circumstances, the most inexperienced among us <lb/>
could not detect it if it were, or might overlook it if <lb/>
it did, or scorn the very idea of such a thing, even <lb/>
though it were palpably demonstrated as such. Am <lb/>
I not right?"</p>
<p>I said, sorrowfully: "I feel ashamed of myself, <lb/>
Mr. Ward. I know I ought to understand you per- <lb/>
fectly well, but you see that treacherous whisky <lb/>
cocktail has got into my head, and now I cannot <lb/>
understand even the simplest proposition. I told <lb/>
you how it would be."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't mind it, don't mind it; the fault was <lb/>
my own, no doubt&#x2014;though I did think it clear <lb/>
enough for&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Don't say a word. Clear! Why, you stated <lb/>
it as clear as the sun to anybody but an abject idiot; <lb/>
but it's that confounded cocktail that has played the <lb/>
mischief."</p>
<p>"No; now don't say that. I'll begin it all over <lb/>
again, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Don't now&#x2014;for goodness' sake, don't do any- <lb/>
thing of the kind, because I tell you my head is in <lb/>
such a condition that I don't believe I could under- <lb/>
<pb n="368"/>
stand the most trifling question a man could ask <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>"Now don't you be afraid. I'll put it so plain <lb/>
this time that you can't help but get the hang of it. <lb/>
We will begin at the very beginning." [Leaning <lb/>
far across the table, with determined impressiveness <lb/>
wrought upon his every feature, and fingers prepared <lb/>
to keep tally of each point enumerated; and I, lean- <lb/>
ing forward with painful interest, resolved to compre- <lb/>
hend or perish.] "You know the vein, the ledge, <lb/>
the thing that contains the metal, whereby it consti- <lb/>
tutes the medium between all other forces, whether <lb/>
of present or remote agencies, so brought to bear in <lb/>
favor of the former against the latter, or the latter <lb/>
against the former or all, or both, or compromising <lb/>
the relative differences existing within the radius <lb/>
whence culminate the several degrees of similarity to <lb/>
which&#x2014;"</p>
<p>I said: "Oh, hang my wooden head, it ain't any <lb/>
use!&#x2014;it ain't any use to try&#x2014;I can't understand <lb/>
anything. The plainer you get it the more I can't <lb/>
get the hang of it."</p>
<p>I heard a suspicious noise behind me, and turned <lb/>
in time to see Hingston dodging behind a newspaper, <lb/>
and quaking with a gentle ecstasy of laughter. I <lb/>
looked at Ward again, and he had thrown off his <lb/>
dread solemnity and was laughing also. Then I saw <lb/>
that I had been sold&#x2014;that I had been made a vic- <lb/>
tim of a swindle in the way of a string of plausibly <lb/>
worded sentences that didn't mean anything under <lb/>
<pb n="369"/>
the sun. Artemus Ward was one of the best fellows <lb/>
in the world, and one of the most companionable. <lb/>
It has been said that he was not fluent in conversa- <lb/>
tion, but, with the above experience in my mind, I <lb/>
differ.</p>

<p><smcap>I visited</smcap> St. Louis lately, and on my way West, <lb/>
after changing cars at Terre Haute, Indiana, a <lb/>
mild, benevolent-looking gentleman of about forty- <lb/>
five, or maybe fifty, came in at one of the way- <lb/>
stations and sat down beside me. We talked together <lb/>
pleasantly on various subjects for an hour, perhaps, <lb/>
and I found him exceedingly intelligent and enter- <lb/>
taining. When he learned that I was from Washing- <lb/>
ton, he immediately began to ask questions about <lb/>
various public men, and about Congressional affairs; <lb/>
and I saw very shortly that I was conversing with a <lb/>
man who was perfectly familiar with the ins and <lb/>
outs of political life at the Capital, even to the ways <lb/>
and manners, and customs of procedure of Senators <lb/>
and Representatives in the Chambers of the National <lb/>
Legislature. Presently two men halted near us for <lb/>
a single moment, and one said to the other:</p>
<p>"Harris, if you'll do that for me, I'll never forget <lb/>
you, my boy."</p>
<p>My new comrade's eye lighted pleasantly. The <lb/>
words had touched upon a happy memory, I <lb/>
<pb n="371"/>
thought. Then his face settled into thoughtfulness <lb/>
&#x2014;almost into gloom. He turned to me and said, <lb/>
"Let me tell you a story; let me give you a secret <lb/>
chapter of my life&#x2014;a chapter that has never been <lb/>
referred to by me since its events transpired. Listen <lb/>
patiently, and promise that you will not interrupt <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>I said I would not, and he related the following <lb/>
strange adventure, speaking sometimes with anima- <lb/>
tion, sometimes with melancholy, but always with <lb/>
feeling and earnestness.</p>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>The Stranger's Narrative</smcap>.</head>
<p>'On the 19th of December, 1853, I started from <lb/>
St. Louis on the evening train bound for Chicago. <lb/>
There were only twenty-four passengers, all told. <lb/>
There were no ladies and no children. We were in <lb/>
excellent spirits, and pleasant acquaintanceships were <lb/>
soon formed. The journey bade fair to be a happy <lb/>
one; and no individual in the party, I think, had <lb/>
even the vaguest presentiment of the horrors we <lb/>
were soon to undergo.</p>
<p>"At 11 <smcap>p. m.</smcap> it began to snow hard. Shortly <lb/>
after leaving the small village of Welden, we entered <lb/>
upon that tremendous prairie solitude that stretches <lb/>
its leagues on leagues of houseless dreariness far <lb/>
away toward the Jubilee Settlements. The winds, <lb/>
unobstructed by trees or hills, or even vagrant rocks, <lb/>
whistled fiercely across the level desert, driving the <lb/>
falling snow before it like spray from the crested <lb/>
<pb n="372"/>
waves of a stormy sea. The snow was deepening <lb/>
fast; and we knew, by the diminished speed of the <lb/>
train, that the engine was plowing through it with <lb/>
steadily increasing difficulty. Indeed, it almost came <lb/>
to a dead halt sometimes, in the midst of great drifts <lb/>
that piled themselves like colossal graves across the <lb/>
track. Conversation began to flag. Cheerfulness <lb/>
gave place to grave concern. The possibility of <lb/>
being imprisoned in the snow, on the bleak prairie, <lb/>
fifty miles from any house, presented itself to every <lb/>
mind, and extended its depressing influence over <lb/>
every spirit.</p>
<p>"At two o'clock in the morning I was aroused <lb/>
out of an uneasy slumber by the ceasing of all <lb/>
motion about me. The appalling truth flashed upon <lb/>
me instantly&#x2014;we were captives in a snow-drift! <lb/>
'All hands to the rescue!' Every man sprang to <lb/>
obey. Out into the wild night, the pitchy darkness, <lb/>
the billowy snow, the driving storm, every soul <lb/>
leaped, with the consciousness that a moment lost <lb/>
now might bring destruction to us all. Shovels, <lb/>
hands, boards&#x2014;anything, everything that could dis- <lb/>
place snow, was brought into instant requisition. It <lb/>
was a weird picture, that small company of frantic <lb/>
men fighting the banking snows, half in the blackest <lb/>
shadow and half in the angry light of the loco- <lb/>
motive's reflector.</p>
<p>"One short hour sufficed to prove the utter use- <lb/>
lessness of our efforts. The storm barricaded the <lb/>
track with a dozen drifts while we dug one away. <lb/>
<pb n="373"/>
And worse than this, it was discovered that the last <lb/>
grand charge the engine had made upon the enemy <lb/>
had broken the fore-and-aft shaft of the driving- <lb/>
wheel! With a free track before us we should still <lb/>
have been helpless. We entered the car wearied <lb/>
with labor, and very sorrowful. We gathered about <lb/>
the stoves, and gravely canvassed our situation. <lb/>
We had no provisions whatever&#x2014;in this lay our <lb/>
chief distress. We could not freeze, for there was a <lb/>
good supply of wood in the tender. This was our <lb/>
only comfort. The discussion ended at last in ac- <lb/>
cepting the disheartening decision of the conductor, <lb/>
viz., that it would be death for any man to attempt <lb/>
to travel fifty miles on foot through snow like that. <lb/>
We could not send for help, and even if we could it <lb/>
would not come. We must submit, and await, as <lb/>
patiently as we might, succor or starvation! I think <lb/>
the stoutest heart there felt a momentary chill when <lb/>
those words were uttered.</p>
<p>"Within the hour conversation subsided to a low <lb/>
murmur here and there about the car, caught fitfully <lb/>
between the rising and falling of the blast; the lamps <lb/>
grew dim; and the majority of the castaways settled <lb/>
themselves among the flickering shadows to think&#x2014; <lb/>
to forget the present, if they could&#x2014;to sleep, if <lb/>
they might.</p>
<p>"The eternal night&#x2014;it surely seemed eternal to <lb/>
us&#x2014;wore its lagging hours away at last, and the <lb/>
cold gray dawn broke in the east. As the light <lb/>
grew stronger the passengers began to stir and give <lb/>
<pb n="374"/>
signs of life, one after another, and each in turn <lb/>
pushed his slouched hat up from his forehead, <lb/>
stretched his stiffened limbs, and glanced out at the <lb/>
windows upon the cheerless prospect. It was cheer- <lb/>
less, indeed!&#x2014;not a living thing visible anywhere, <lb/>
not a human habitation; nothing but a vast white <lb/>
desert; uplifted sheets of snow drifting hither and <lb/>
thither before the wind&#x2014;a world of eddying flakes <lb/>
shutting out the firmament above.</p>
<p>"All day we moped about the cars, saying little, <lb/>
thinking much. Another lingering dreary night&#x2014; <lb/>
and hunger.</p>
<p>"Another dawning&#x2014;another day of silence, sad- <lb/>
ness, wasting hunger, hopeless watching for succor <lb/>
that could not come. A night of restless slumber, <lb/>
filled with dreams of feasting&#x2014;wakings distressed <lb/>
with the gnawings of hunger.</p>
<p>"The fourth day came and went&#x2014;and the fifth! <lb/>
Five days of dreadful imprisonment! A savage <lb/>
hunger looked out at every eye. There was in it a <lb/>
sign of awful import&#x2014;the foreshadowing of a some- <lb/>
thing that was vaguely shaping itself in every heart&#x2014; <lb/>
a something which no tongue dared yet to frame <lb/>
into words.</p>
<p>"The sixth day passed&#x2014;the seventh dawned <lb/>
upon as gaunt and haggard and hopeless a company <lb/>
of men as ever stood in the shadow of death. It <lb/>
must out now! That thing which had been growing <lb/>
up in every heart was ready to leap from every lip <lb/>
at last! Nature had been taxed to the utmost&#x2014;she <lb/>
<pb n="375"/>
must yield. <smcap>Richard H. Gaston</smcap> of Minnesota, <lb/>
tall, cadaverous, and pale, rose up. All knew what <lb/>
was coming. All prepared&#x2014;every motion, every <lb/>
semblance of excitement was smothered&#x2014;only a <lb/>
calm, thoughtful seriousness appeared in the eyes <lb/>
that were lately so wild.</p>
<sp><speaker>"'Gentlemen:</speaker><p>It cannot be delayed longer! <lb/>
The time is at hand! We must determine which <lb/>
of us shall die to furnish food for the rest!'</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>"<smcap>Mr. John J. Williams</smcap> of Illinois rose and <lb/>
said:</speaker><p>'Gentlemen&#x2014;I nominate the Rev. James <lb/>
Sawyer of Tennessee.'</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>"<smcap>Mr. Wm. R. Adams</smcap> of Indiana said:</speaker><p>'I nomi- <lb/>
nate Mr. Daniel Slote of New York.'</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>"<smcap>Mr. Charles J. Langdon</smcap>:</speaker><p>'I nominate Mr. <lb/>
Samuel A. Bowen of St. Louis.'</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>"<smcap>Mr. Slote</smcap>:</speaker><p>'Gentlemen&#x2014;I desire to decline <lb/>
in favor of Mr. John A. Van Nostrand, Jun., of <lb/>
New Jersey.'</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>"<smcap>Mr. Gaston</smcap>:</speaker><p>'If there be no objection, the <lb/>
gentleman's desire will be acceded to.'</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>"<smcap>Mr. Van Nostrand</smcap></speaker><p>objecting, the resignation <lb/>
of Mr. Slote was rejected. The resignations of <lb/>
Messrs. Sawyer and Bowen were also offered, and <lb/>
refused upon the same grounds.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>"<smcap>Mr. A. L. Bascom</smcap> of Ohio:</speaker><p>'I move that the <lb/>
nominations now close, and that the House proceed <lb/>
to an election by ballot.'</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>"<smcap>Mr. Sawyer</smcap>:</speaker><p>'Gentlemen&#x2014;I protest earnestly <lb/>
against these proceedings. They are, in every way, <lb/>
<pb n="376"/>
irregular and unbecoming. I must beg to move that <lb/>
they be dropped at once, and that we elect a chair- <lb/>
man of the meeting and proper officers to assist him, <lb/>
and then we can go on with the business before us <lb/>
understandingly.'</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>"<smcap>Mr. Bell</smcap> of Iowa:</speaker><p>'Gentlemen&#x2014;I object. <lb/>
This is no time to stand upon forms and ceremonious <lb/>
observances. For more than seven days we have <lb/>
been without food. Every moment we lose in idle <lb/>
discussion increases our distress. I am satisfied with <lb/>
the nominations that have been made&#x2014;every <lb/>
gentleman present is, I believe&#x2014;and I, for one, <lb/>
do not see why we should not proceed at once to <lb/>
elect one or more of them. I wish to offer a reso- <lb/>
lution&#x2014;'</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>"<smcap>Mr. Gaston</smcap>:</speaker><p>'It would be objected to, and <lb/>
have to lie over one day under the rules, thus bring- <lb/>
ing about the very delay you wish to avoid. The <lb/>
gentleman from New Jersey&#x2014;'</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>"<smcap>Mr. Van Nostrand</smcap>:</speaker><p>'Gentlemen&#x2014;I am a <lb/>
stranger among you; I have not sought the distinc- <lb/>
tion that has been conferred upon me, and I feel a <lb/>
delicacy&#x2014;'</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>"<smcap>Mr. Morgan</smcap> of Alabama (interrupting):</speaker><p>'I <lb/>
move the previous question.'</p>
<p>"The motion was carried, and further debate shut <lb/>
off, of course. The motion to elect officers was <lb/>
passed, and under it Mr. Gaston was chosen chair- <lb/>
man, Mr. Blake, secretary, Messrs. Holcomb, Dyer, <lb/>
and Baldwin, a committee on nominations, and Mr. <lb/>
<pb n="377"/>
R. M. Howland, purveyor, to assist the committee <lb/>
in making selections.</p>
<p>"A recess of half an hour was then taken, and <lb/>
some little caucussing followed. At the sound of <lb/>
the gavel the meeting reassembled, and the com- <lb/>
mittee reported in favor of Messrs. George Ferguson <lb/>
of Kentucky, Lucien Herrman of Louisiana, and W. <lb/>
Messick of Colorado as candidates. The report was <lb/>
accepted.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>"<smcap>Mr. Rogers</smcap> of Missouri:</speaker><p>'Mr. President&#x2014; <lb/>
The report being properly before the House now, I <lb/>
move to amend it by substituting for the name of <lb/>
Mr. Herrman that of Mr. Lucius Harris of St. <lb/>
Louis, who is well and honorably known to us all. <lb/>
I do not wish to be understood as casting the least <lb/>
reflection upon the high character and standing of <lb/>
the gentleman from Louisiana&#x2014;far from it. I re- <lb/>
spect and esteem him as much as any gentleman <lb/>
here present possibly can; but none of us can be <lb/>
blind to the fact that he has lost more flesh during <lb/>
the week that we have lain here than any among <lb/>
us&#x2014;none of us can be blind to the fact that <lb/>
the committee has been derelict in its duty, either <lb/>
through negligence or a graver fault, in thus offer- <lb/>
ing for our suffrages a gentleman who, however <lb/>
pure his own motives may be, has really less nu- <lb/>
triment in him&#x2014;'</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>"<smcap>The Chair</smcap>:</speaker><p>'The gentleman from Missouri <lb/>
will take his seat. The Chair cannot allow the <lb/>
integrity of the committee to be questioned save <lb/>
<pb n="378"/>
by the regular course, under the rules. What <lb/>
action will the House take upon the gentleman's <lb/>
motion?'</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>"<smcap>Mr. Halliday</smcap> of Virginia:</speaker><p>'I move to further <lb/>
amend the report by substituting Mr. Harvey Davis <lb/>
of Oregon for Mr. Messick. It may be urged by <lb/>
gentlemen that the hardships and privations of a <lb/>
frontier life have rendered Mr. Davis tough; but, <lb/>
gentlemen, is this a time to cavil at toughness? Is <lb/>
this a time to be fastidious concerning trifles? Is this <lb/>
a time to dispute about matters of paltry signifi- <lb/>
cance? No, gentlemen, bulk is what we desire&#x2014; <lb/>
substance, weight, bulk&#x2014;these are the supreme <lb/>
requisites now&#x2014;not talent, not genius, not educa- <lb/>
tion. I insist upon my motion.'</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>"<smcap>Mr. Morgan</smcap> (excitedly):</speaker><p>'Mr. Chairman&#x2014;I <lb/>
do most strenuously object to this amendment. The <lb/>
gentleman from Oregon is old, and furthermore is <lb/>
bulky only in bone&#x2014;not in flesh. I ask the gentle- <lb/>
man from Virginia if it is soup we want instead of <lb/>
solid sustenance? if he would delude us with shad- <lb/>
ows? if he would mock our suffering with an Ore- <lb/>
gonian specter? I ask him if he can look upon the <lb/>
anxious faces around him, if he can gaze into our <lb/>
sad eyes, if he can listen to the beating of our ex- <lb/>
pectant hearts, and still thrust this famine-stricken <lb/>
fraud upon us? I ask him if he can think of our <lb/>
desolate state, of our past sorrows, of our dark <lb/>
future, and still unpityingly foist upon us this wreck, <lb/>
this ruin, this tottering swindle, this gnarled and <lb/>
<pb n="379"/>
blighted and sapless vagabond from Oregon's inhos- <lb/>
pitable shores? Never!' [Applause.]</p></sp>
<p>"The amendment was put to vote, after a fiery <lb/>
debate, and lost. Mr. Harris was substituted on the <lb/>
first amendment. The balloting then began. Five <lb/>
ballots were held without a choice. On the sixth, <lb/>
Mr. Harris was elected, all voting for him but him- <lb/>
self. It was then moved that his election should be <lb/>
ratified by acclamation, which was lost, in conse- <lb/>
quence of his again voting against himself.</p>
<p>"<smcap>Mr. Radway</smcap> moved that the House now take <lb/>
up the remaining candidates, and go into an election <lb/>
for breakfast. This was carried.</p>
<p>"On the first ballot there was a tie, half the <lb/>
members favoring one candidate on account of his <lb/>
youth, and half favoring the other on account of his <lb/>
superior size. The President gave the casting vote <lb/>
for the latter, Mr. Messick. This decision created <lb/>
considerable dissatisfaction among the friends of Mr. <lb/>
Ferguson, the defeated candidate, and there was <lb/>
some talk of demanding a new ballot; but in the <lb/>
midst of it, a motion to adjourn was carried, and the <lb/>
meeting broke up at once.</p>
<p>"The preparations for supper diverted the atten- <lb/>
tion of the Ferguson faction from the discussion of <lb/>
their grievance for a long time, and then, when they <lb/>
would have taken it up again, the happy announce- <lb/>
ment that Mr. Harris was ready, drove all thought <lb/>
of it to the winds.</p>
<p>"We improvised tables by propping up the backs <lb/>
<pb n="380"/>
of car-seats, and sat down with hearts full of grati- <lb/>
tude to the finest supper that had blessed our vision <lb/>
for seven torturing days. How changed we were <lb/>
from what we had been a few short hours before! <lb/>
Hopeless, sad-eyed misery, hunger, feverish anxiety, <lb/>
desperation, then&#x2014;thankfulness, serenity, joy too <lb/>
deep for utterance now. That I know was the <lb/>
cheeriest hour of my eventful life. The wind <lb/>
howled, and blew the snow wildly about our prison- <lb/>
house, but they were powerless to distress us any <lb/>
more. I liked Harris. He might have been better <lb/>
done, perhaps, but I am free to say that no man <lb/>
ever agreed with me better than Harris, or afforded <lb/>
me so large a degree of satisfaction. Messick was <lb/>
very well, though rather high-flavored, but for gen- <lb/>
uine nutritiousness and delicacy of fiber, give me <lb/>
Harris. Messick had his good points&#x2014;I will not <lb/>
attempt to deny it, nor do I wish to do it&#x2014;but he <lb/>
was no more fitted for breakfast than a mummy <lb/>
would be, sir&#x2014;not a bit. Lean?&#x2014;why, bless me! <lb/>
&#x2014;and tough? Ah, he was very tough! You could <lb/>
not imagine it&#x2014;you could never imagine anything <lb/>
like it."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to tell me that&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Do not interrupt me, please. After breakfast <lb/>
we elected a man by the name of Walker, from <lb/>
Detroit, for supper. He was very good. I wrote <lb/>
his wife so afterwards. He was worthy of all <lb/>
praise. I shall always remember Walker. He was <lb/>
a little rare, but very good. And then the next <lb/>
<pb n="381"/>
morning we had Morgan of Alabama for breakfast. <lb/>
He was one of the finest men I ever sat down to&#x2014; <lb/>
handsome, educated, refined, spoke several languages <lb/>
fluently&#x2014;a perfect gentleman&#x2014;he was a perfect <lb/>
gentleman, and singularly juicy. For supper we <lb/>
had that Oregon patriarch, and he <i>was</i> a fraud, <lb/>
there is no question about it&#x2014;old, scraggy, tough, <lb/>
nobody can picture the reality. I finally said, gen- <lb/>
tlemen, you can do as you like, but <i>I</i> will wait for <lb/>
another election. And Grimes of Illinois said, <lb/>
'Gentlemen, <i>I</i> will wait also. When you elect a <lb/>
man that has <i>something</i> to recommend him, I shall <lb/>
be glad to join you again.' It soon became evident <lb/>
that there was general dissatisfaction with Davis of <lb/>
Oregon, and so, to preserve the good-will that had <lb/>
prevailed so pleasantly since we had had Harris, an <lb/>
election was called, and the result of it was that <lb/>
Baker of Georgia was chosen. He was splendid! <lb/>
Well, well&#x2014;after that we had Doolittle, and Haw- <lb/>
kins, and McElroy (there was some complaint about <lb/>
McElroy, because he was uncommonly short and <lb/>
thin), and Penrod, and two Smiths, and Bailey <lb/>
(Bailey had a wooden leg, which was clear loss, but <lb/>
he was otherwise good), and an Indian boy, and an <lb/>
organ-grinder, and a gentleman by the name of <lb/>
Buckminster&#x2014;a poor stick of a vagabond that <lb/>
wasn't any good for company and no account for <lb/>
breakfast. We were glad we got him elected before <lb/>
relief came."</p>
<p>"And so the blessed relief <i>did</i> come at last?"</p>
<pb n="382"/>
<p>"Yes, it came one bright, sunny morning, just <lb/>
after election. John Murphy was the choice, and <lb/>
there never was a better, I am willing to testify; but <lb/>
John Murphy came home with us, in the train that <lb/>
came to succor us, and lived to marry the widow <lb/>
Harris&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Relict of&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Relict of our first choice. He married her, and <lb/>
is happy and respected and prosperous yet. Ah, it <lb/>
was like a novel, sir&#x2014;it was like a romance. This <lb/>
is my stopping-place, sir; I must bid you good- <lb/>
bye. Any time that you can make it convenient to <lb/>
tarry a day or two with me, I shall be glad to have <lb/>
you. I like you, sir; I have conceived an affection <lb/>
for you. I could like you as well as I liked Har- <lb/>
ris himself, sir. Good day, sir, and a pleasant <lb/>
journey."</p>
<p>He was gone. I never felt so stunned, so dis- <lb/>
tressed, so bewildered in my life. But in my soul I <lb/>
was glad he was gone. With all his gentleness of <lb/>
manner and his soft voice, I shuddered whenever he <lb/>
turned his hungry eye upon me; and when I heard <lb/>
that I had achieved his perilous affection, and that I <lb/>
stood almost with the late Harris in his esteem, my <lb/>
heart fairly stood still!</p>
<p>I was bewildered beyond description. I did not <lb/>
doubt his word; I could not question a single item <lb/>
in a statement so stamped with the earnestness of <lb/>
truth as his; but its dreadful details overpowered <lb/>
me, and threw my thoughts into hopeless confusion. <lb/>
<pb n="383"/>
I saw the conductor looking at me. I said, "Who <lb/>
is that man?"</p>
<p>"He was a member of Congress once, and a <lb/>
good one. But he got caught in a snowdrift in the <lb/>
cars, and like to have been starved to death. He got <lb/>
so frost-bitten and frozen up generally, and used up <lb/>
for want of something to eat, that he was sick and <lb/>
out of his head two or three months afterward. He <lb/>
is all right now, only he is a monomaniac, and when <lb/>
he gets on that old subject he never stops till he has <lb/>
eat up that whole car-load of people he talks about. <lb/>
He would have finished the crowd by this time, only <lb/>
he had to get out here. He has got their names as <lb/>
pat as A B C. When he gets them all eat up but <lb/>
himself, he always says: 'Then the hour for the <lb/>
usual election for breakfast having arrived, and there <lb/>
being no opposition, I was duly elected, after which, <lb/>
there being no objections offered, I resigned. Thus <lb/>
I am here.'"</p>
<p>I felt inexpressibly relieved to know that I had <lb/>
only been listening to the harmless vagaries of a <lb/>
madman instead of the genuine experiences of a <lb/>
bloodthirsty cannibal.</p>

<q><i>Being the only true and reliable account ever pub- <lb/>
lished; taken from the Roman "Daily Evening <lb/>
Fasces," of the date of that tremendous oc- <lb/>
currence.</i></q>
<p><smcap>Nothing</smcap> in the world affords a newspaper re- <lb/>
porter so much satisfaction as gathering up <lb/>
the details of a bloody and mysterious murder, and <lb/>
writing them up with aggravating circumstantiality. <lb/>
He takes a living delight in this labor of love&#x2014;for <lb/>
such it is to him, especially if he knows that all the <lb/>
other papers have gone to press, and his will be the <lb/>
only one that will contain the dreadful intelligence. <lb/>
A feeling of regret has often come over me that I <lb/>
was not reporting in Rome when C&#x00E6;sar was killed <lb/>
&#x2014;reporting on an evening paper, and the only one <lb/>
in the city, and getting at least twelve hours ahead <lb/>
of the morning-paper boys with this most magnifi- <lb/>
cent "item" that ever fell to the lot of the craft. <lb/>
Other events have happened as startling as this, but <lb/>
<pb n="385"/>
none that possessed so peculiarly all the character- <lb/>
istics of the favorite "item" of the present day, <lb/>
magnified into grandeur and sublimity by the high <lb/>
rank, fame, and social and political standing of the <lb/>
actors in it.</p>
<p>However, as I was not permitted to report C&#x00E6;sar's <lb/>
assassination in the regular way, it has at least <lb/>
afforded me rare satisfaction to translate the follow- <lb/>
ing able account of it from the original Latin of the <lb/>
<i>Roman Daily Evening Fasces</i> of that date&#x2014;second <lb/>
edition.</p>
<q>"Our usually quiet city of Rome was thrown into a state of wild <lb/>
excitement yesterday by the occurrence of one of those bloody affrays <lb/>
which sicken the heart and fill the soul with fear, while they inspire all <lb/>
thinking men with forebodings for the future of a city where human life <lb/>
is held so cheaply, and the gravest laws are so openly set at defiance. <lb/>
As the result of that affray, it is our painful duty, as public journalists, <lb/>
to record the death of one of our most esteemed citizens&#x2014;a man whose <lb/>
name is known wherever this paper circulates, and whose fame it has <lb/>
been our pleasure and our privilege to extend, and also to protect from <lb/>
the tongue of slander and falsehood, to the best of our poor ability. <lb/>
We refer to Mr. J. C&#x00E6;sar, the Emperor-elect.</q>
<q>"The facts of the case, as nearly as our reporter could determine them <lb/>
from the conflicting statements of eye-witnesses, were about as follows:&#x2014; <lb/>
The affair was an election row, of course. Nine-tenths of the ghastly <lb/>
butcheries that disgrace the city now-a-days grow out of the bickerings <lb/>
and jealousies and animosities engendered by these accursed elections. <lb/>
Rome would be the gainer by it if her very constables were elected to <lb/>
serve a century; for in our experience we have never even been able to <lb/>
choose a dog-pelter without celebrating the event with a dozen knock- <lb/>
downs and a general cramming of the station-house with drunken vaga- <lb/>
bonds overnight. It is said that when the immense majority for C&#x00E6;sar <lb/>
at the polls in the market was declared the other day, and the crown <lb/>
was offered to that gentleman, even his amazing unselfishness in refusing <lb/>
it three times was not sufficient to save him from the whispered insults <lb/>
<pb n="386"/>
of such men as Casca, of the Tenth Ward, and other hirelings of the <lb/>
disappointed candidate, hailing mostly from the Eleventh and Thirteenth <lb/>
and other outside districts, who were overheard speaking ironically and <lb/>
contemptuously of Mr. C&#x00E6;sar's conduct upon that occasion.</q>
<q>"We are further informed that there are many among us who think <lb/>
they are justified in believing that the assassination of Julius C&#x00E6;sar was a <lb/>
put-up thing&#x2014;a cut-and-dried arrangement, hatched by Marcus Brutus <lb/>
and a lot of his hired roughs, and carried out only too faithfully accord- <lb/>
ing to the programme. Whether there be good grounds for this sus- <lb/>
picion or not, we leave to the people to judge for themselves, only <lb/>
asking that they will read the following account of the sad occurrence <lb/>
carefully and dispassionately before they render that judgment.</q>
<q>"The Senate was already in session, and C&#x00E6;sar was coming down <lb/>
the street towards the capitol, conversing with some personal friends, <lb/>
and followed, as usual, by a large number of citizens. Just as he was <lb/>
passing in front of Demosthenes and Thucydides' drug-store, he was <lb/>
observing casually to a gentleman, who, our informant thinks, is a <lb/>
fortune-teller, that the Ides of March were come. The reply was, <lb/>
'Yes, they are come, but not gone yet.' At this moment Artemidorus <lb/>
stepped up and passed the time of day, and asked C&#x00E6;sar to read a <lb/>
schedule or a tract or something of the kind, which he had brought for <lb/>
his perusal. Mr. Decius Brutus also said something about an 'humble <lb/>
suit' which <i>he</i> wanted read. Artemidorus begged that attention might <lb/>
be paid to his first, because it was of personal consequence to C&#x00E6;sar. <lb/>
The latter replied that what concerned himself should be read last, or <lb/>
words to that effect. Artemidorus begged and beseeched him to read <lb/>
the paper instantly.<ref target="n43">*</ref><note id="n43" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Mark that: It is hinted by William Shakespeare, who saw the <lb/>
beginning and the end of the unfortunate affray, that this "schedule" <lb/>
was simply a note discovering to C&#x00E6;sar that a plot was brewing to take <lb/>
his life.</p></note> However, C&#x00E6;sar shook him off, and refused to <lb/>
read any petition in the street. He then entered the capitol, and the <lb/>
crowd followed him.</q>
<q>"About this time the following conversation was overheard, and we <lb/>
consider that, taken in connection with the events which succeeded it, <lb/>
it bears an appalling significance: Mr. Papilius Lena remarked to <lb/>
George W. Cassius (commonly known as the 'Nobby Boy of the Third <lb/>
Ward'), a bruiser in the pay of the Opposition, that he hoped his <lb/>
<pb n="387"/>
enterprise to-day might thrive; and when Cassius asked 'What enter- <lb/>
prise?' he only closed his left eye temporarily and said with simulated <lb/>
indifference, 'Fare you well,' and sauntered towards C&#x00E6;sar. Marcus <lb/>
Brutus, who is suspected of being the ringleader of the band that killed <lb/>
C&#x00E6;sar, asked what it was that Lena had said. Cassius told him, and <lb/>
added in a low tone, <i>'I fear our purpose is discovered.'</i></q>
<q>"Brutus told his wretched accomplice to keep an eye on Lena, and <lb/>
a moment after Cassius urged that lean and hungry vagrant, Casca, <lb/>
whose reputation here is none of the best, to be sudden for <i>he feared <lb/>
prevention</i>. He then turned to Brutus, apparently much excited, and <lb/>
asked what should be done, and swore that either he or C&#x00E6;sar <i>should <lb/>
never turn back</i>&#x2014;he would kill himself first. At this time C&#x00E6;sar was <lb/>
talking to some of the back-country members about the approaching fall <lb/>
elections, and paying little attention to what was going on around him. <lb/>
Billy Trebonius got into conversation with the people's friend and <lb/>
C&#x00E6;sar's&#x2014;Mark Antony&#x2014;and under some pretence or other got him <lb/>
away, and Brutus, Decius, Casca, Cinna, Metellus Cimber, and others <lb/>
of the gang of infamous desperadoes that infest Rome at present, closed <lb/>
around the doomed C&#x00E6;sar. Then Metellus Cimber knelt down and <lb/>
begged that his brother might be recalled from banishment, but C&#x00E6;sar <lb/>
rebuked him for his fawning conduct, and refused to grant his petition. <lb/>
Immediately, at Cimber's request, first Brutus and then Cassius begged <lb/>
for the return of the banished Publius; but C&#x00E6;sar still refused. He <lb/>
said he could not be moved; that he was as fixed as the North Star, and <lb/>
proceeded to speak in the most complimentary terms of the firmness of <lb/>
that star and its steady character. Then he said he was like it, and he <lb/>
believed he was the only man in the country that was; therefore, since <lb/>
he was 'constant' that Cimber should be banished, he was also 'con- <lb/>
stant' that he should stay banished, and he'd be hanged if he didn't <lb/>
keep him so!</q>
<q>"Instantly seizing upon this shallow pretext for a fight, Casca sprang <lb/>
at C&#x00E6;sar and struck him with a dirk, C&#x00E6;sar grabbing him by the arm <lb/>
with his right hand, and launching a blow straight from the shoulder <lb/>
with his left, that sent the reptile bleeding to the earth. He then <lb/>
backed up against Pompey's statue, and squared himself to receive his <lb/>
assailants. Cassius and Cimber and Cinna rushed upon him with their <lb/>
daggers drawn, and the former succeeded in inflicting a wound upon his <lb/>
body; but before he could strike again, and before either of the others <lb/>
could strike at all, C&#x00E6;sar stretched the three miscreants at his feet with <lb/>
<pb n="388"/>
as many blows of his powerful fist. By this time the Senate was in an <lb/>
indescribable uproar; the throng of citizens in the lobbies had blockaded <lb/>
the doors in their frantic efforts to escape from the building, the sergeant- <lb/>
at-arms and his assistants were struggling with the assassins, venerable <lb/>
senators had cast aside their encumbering robes, and were leaping over <lb/>
benches and flying down the aisles in wild confusion towards the shelter <lb/>
of the committee-rooms, and a thousand voices were shouting 'Po-lice! <lb/>
Po-lice!' in discordant tones that rose above the frightful din like <lb/>
shrieking winds above the roaring of a tempest. And amid it all, great <lb/>
C&#x00E6;sar stood with his back against the statue, like a lion at bay, and <lb/>
fought his assailants weaponless and hand to hand, with the defiant <lb/>
bearing and the unwavering courage which he had shown before on <lb/>
many a bloody field. Billy Trebonius and Caius Legarius struck him <lb/>
with their daggers and fell, as their brother-conspirators before them had <lb/>
fallen. But at last, when C&#x00E6;sar saw his old friend Brutus step forward <lb/>
armed with a murderous knife, it is said he seemed utterly overpowered <lb/>
with grief and amazement, and dropping his invincible left arm by his <lb/>
side, he hid his face in the folds of his mantle and received the treach- <lb/>
erous blow without an effort to stay the hand that gave it. He only <lb/>
said, '<i>Et tu, Brute?</i>' and fell lifeless on the marble pavement.</q>
<q>"We learn that the coat deceased had on when he was killed was <lb/>
the same one he wore in his tent on the afternoon of the day he over- <lb/>
came the Nervii, and that when it was removed from the corpse it was <lb/>
found to be cut and gashed in no less than seven different places. <lb/>
There was nothing in the pockets. It will be exhibited at the coroner's <lb/>
inquest, and will be damning proof of the fact of the killing. These <lb/>
latter facts may be relied on, as we get them from Mark Antony, whose <lb/>
position enables him to learn every item of news connected with the one <lb/>
subject of absorbing interest of to-day.</q>
<q>"<smcap>Later</smcap>.&#x2014;While the coroner was summoning a jury, Mark Antony <lb/>
and other friends of the late C&#x00E6;sar got hold of the body, and lugged it <lb/>
off to the Forum, and at last accounts Antony and Brutus were making <lb/>
speeches over it and raising such a row among the people that, as we <lb/>
go to press, the chief of police is satisfied there is going to be a riot, <lb/>
and is taking measures accordingly."</q>

<head><b>THE WIDOW'S PROTEST</b></head>
<p><smcap>One</smcap> of the saddest things that ever came under <lb/>
my notice (said the banker's clerk) was there <lb/>
in Corning during the war. Dan Murphy enlisted <lb/>
as a private, and fought very bravely. The boys all <lb/>
liked him, and when a wound by and by weakened <lb/>
him down till carrying a musket was too heavy work <lb/>
for him, they clubbed together and fixed him up as <lb/>
a sutler. He made money then, and sent it always <lb/>
to his wife to bank for him. She was a washer and <lb/>
ironer, and knew enough by hard experience to keep <lb/>
money when she got it. She didn't waste a penny. <lb/>
On the contrary, she began to get miserly as her <lb/>
bank account grew. She grieved to part with a <lb/>
cent, poor creature, for twice in her hardworking <lb/>
life she had known what it was to be hungry, cold, <lb/>
friendless, sick, and without a dollar in the world, <lb/>
and she had a haunting dread of suffering so again. <lb/>
Well, at last Dan died; and the boys, in testimony <lb/>
of their esteem and respect for him, telegraphed to <lb/>
Mrs. Murphy to know if she would like to have him <lb/>
embalmed and sent home; when you know the <lb/>
usual custom was to dump a poor devil like him <lb/>
<pb n="390"/>
into a shallow hole, and <i>then</i> inform his friends <lb/>
what had become of him. Mrs. Murphy jumped to <lb/>
the conclusion that it would only cost two or three <lb/>
dollars to embalm her dead husband, and so she <lb/>
telegraphed "Yes." It was at the "wake" that <lb/>
the bill for embalming arrived and was presented to <lb/>
the widow.</p>
<p>She uttered a wild sad wail that pierced every <lb/>
heart, and said, "Sivinty-foive dollars for stooffin' <lb/>
Dan, blister their sowls! Did thim divils suppose I <lb/>
was goin' to stairt a Museim, that I'd be dalin' in <lb/>
such expinsive curiassities!"</p>

<head><b>THE SCRIPTURAL PANORAMIST</b><ref target="n44">*</ref><note id="n44" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1866.</p></note></head>
<p>"<smcap>There</smcap> was a fellow traveling around in that <lb/>
country," said Mr. Nickerson, "with a <lb/>
moral-religious show&#x2014;a sort of scriptural pano- <lb/>
rama&#x2014;and he hired a wooden-headed old slab to <lb/>
play the piano for him. After the first night's per- <lb/>
formance the showman says:</p>
<p>"'My friend, you seem to know pretty much all <lb/>
the tunes there are, and you worry along first rate. <lb/>
But then, don't you notice that sometimes last night <lb/>
the piece you happened to be playing was a little <lb/>
rough on the proprieties, so to speak&#x2014;didn't seem <lb/>
to jibe with the general gait of the picture that was <lb/>
passing at the time, as it were&#x2014;was a little foreign <lb/>
to the subject, you know&#x2014;as if you didn't either <lb/>
trump or follow suit, you understand?'</p>
<p>"'Well, no,' the fellow said; 'he hadn't noticed, <lb/>
but it might be; he had played along just as it came <lb/>
handy.'</p>
<p>"So they put it up that the simple old dummy <lb/>
was to keep his eye on the panorama after that, and <lb/>
as soon as a stunning picture was reeled out he was <lb/>
<pb n="392"/>
to fit it to a dot with a piece of music that would <lb/>
help the audience to get the idea of the subject, and <lb/>
warm them up like a camp-meeting revival. That <lb/>
sort of thing would corral their sympathies, the <lb/>
showman said.</p>
<p>"There was a big audience that night&#x2014;mostly <lb/>
middle-aged and old people who belong to the <lb/>
church, and took a strong interest in Bible matters, <lb/>
and the balance were pretty much young bucks and <lb/>
heifers&#x2014;they always come out strong on pano- <lb/>
ramas, you know, because it gives them a chance to <lb/>
taste one another's complexions in the dark.</p>
<p>"Well, the showman began to swell himself up <lb/>
for his lecture, and the old mud-dobber tackled the <lb/>
piano and ran his fingers up and down once or twice <lb/>
to see that she was all right, and the fellows behind <lb/>
the curtain commenced to grind out the panorama. <lb/>
The showman balanced his weight on his right foot, <lb/>
and propped his hands over his hips, and flung his <lb/>
eyes over his shoulder at the scenery, and said:</p>
<p>"'Ladies and gentlemen, the painting now before <lb/>
you illustrates the beautiful and touching parable of <lb/>
the Prodigal Son. Observe the happy expression <lb/>
just breaking over the features of the poor, suffering <lb/>
youth&#x2014;so worn and weary with his long march; <lb/>
note also the ecstasy beaming from the uplifted <lb/>
countenance of the aged father, and the joy that <lb/>
sparkles in the eyes of the excited group of youths <lb/>
and maidens, and seems ready to burst into the <lb/>
welcoming chorus from their lips. The lesson, my <lb/>
<pb n="393"/>
friends, is as solemn and instructive as the story is <lb/>
tender and beautiful.'</p>
<p>"The mud-dobber was all ready, and when the <lb/>
second speech was finished, struck up: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"'Oh, we'll all get blind drunk,</l>
<l>When Johnny comes marching home!'</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>"Some of the people giggled, and some groaned <lb/>
a little. The showman couldn't say a word; he <lb/>
looked at the pianist sharp, but he was all lovely <lb/>
and serene&#x2014;<i>he</i> didn't know there was anything out <lb/>
of gear.</p>
<p>"The panorama moved on, and the showman <lb/>
drummed up his grit and started in fresh.</p>
<p>"'Ladies and gentlemen, the fine picture now <lb/>
unfolding itself to your gaze exhibits one of the <lb/>
most notable events in Bible history&#x2014;our Saviour <lb/>
and His disciples upon the Sea of Galilee. How <lb/>
grand, how awe-inspiring are the reflections which <lb/>
the subject invokes! What sublimity of faith is re- <lb/>
vealed to us in this lesson from the sacred writings! <lb/>
The Saviour rebukes the angry waves, and walks <lb/>
securely upon the bosom of the deep!'</p>
<p>"All around the house they were whispering, <lb/>
'Oh, how lovely, how beautiful!' and the orchestra <lb/>
let himself out again: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"'A life on the ocean wave,</l>
<l>And a home on the rolling deep!'</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>"There was a good deal of honest snickering <lb/>
turned on this time, and considerable groaning, and <lb/>
<pb n="394"/>
one or two old deacons got up and went out. The <lb/>
showman grated his teeth, and cursed the piano man <lb/>
to himself; but the fellow sat there like a knot on a <lb/>
log, and seemed to think he was doing first-rate.</p>
<p>"After things got quiet the showman thought he <lb/>
would make one more stagger at it anyway, though <lb/>
his confidence was beginning to get mighty shaky. <lb/>
The supes started the panorama grinding along again, <lb/>
and he says:</p>
<p>"'Ladies and gentlemen, this exquisite painting <lb/>
represents the raising of Lazarus from the dead by <lb/>
our Saviour. The subject has been handled with <lb/>
marvelous skill by the artist, and such touching <lb/>
sweetness and tenderness of expression has he <lb/>
thrown into it that I have known peculiarly sensi- <lb/>
tive persons to be even affected to tears by looking <lb/>
at it. Observe the half-confused, half-inquiring look <lb/>
upon the countenance of the awakened Lazarus. <lb/>
Observe, also, the attitude and expression of the <lb/>
Saviour, who takes him gently by the sleeve of his <lb/>
shroud with one hand, while He points with the <lb/>
other toward the distant city.'</p>
<p>"Before anybody could get off an opinion in the <lb/>
case the innocent old ass at the piano struck up: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"'Come rise up, William Ri-i-ley,</l>
<l>And go along with me!'</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>"Whe-ew! All the solemn old flats got up in a <lb/>
huff to go, and everybody else laughed till the win- <lb/>
dows rattled.</p>
<pb n="395"/>
<p>"The showman went down and grabbed the <lb/>
orchestra and shook him up and says:</p>
<p>"'That lets you out, you know, you chowder- <lb/>
headed old clam. Go to the doorkeeper and get <lb/>
your money, and cut your stick&#x2014;vamose the <lb/>
ranche! Ladies and gentlemen, circumstances over <lb/>
which I have no control compel me prematurely to <lb/>

<head><b>CURING A COLD</b><ref target="n45">*</ref><note id="n45" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1864.</p></note></head>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> is a good thing, perhaps, to write for the amuse- <lb/>
ment of the public, but it is a far higher and <lb/>
nobler thing to write for their instruction, their <lb/>
profit, their actual and tangible benefit. The latter <lb/>
is the sole object of this article. If it prove the <lb/>
means of restoring to health one solitary sufferer <lb/>
among my race, of lighting up once more the fire of <lb/>
hope and joy in his faded eyes, or bringing back to <lb/>
his dead heart again the quick, generous impulses of <lb/>
other days, I shall be amply rewarded for my labor; <lb/>
my soul will be permeated with the sacred delight a <lb/>
Christian feels when he has done a good, unselfish <lb/>
deed.</p>
<p>Having led a pure and blameless life, I am justi- <lb/>
fied in believing that no man who knows me will <lb/>
reject the suggestions I am about to make, out of <lb/>
fear that I am trying to deceive him. Let the public <lb/>
do itself the honor to read my experience in doctor- <lb/>
ing a cold, as herein set forth, and then follow in <lb/>
my footsteps.</p>
<p>When the White House was burned in Virginia <lb/>
<pb n="397"/>
City, I lost my home, my happiness, my constitu- <lb/>
tion, and my trunk. The loss of the two first- <lb/>
named articles was a matter of no great conse- <lb/>
quence, since a home without a mother, or a sister, <lb/>
or a distant young female relative in it, to remind <lb/>
you, by putting your soiled linen out of sight and <lb/>
taking your boots down off the mantel-piece, that <lb/>
there are those who think about you and care for <lb/>
you, is easily obtained. And I cared nothing for <lb/>
the loss of my happiness, because, not being a poet, <lb/>
it could not be possible that melancholy would abide <lb/>
with me long. But to lose a good constitution and <lb/>
a better trunk were serious misfortunes. On the <lb/>
day of the fire my constitution succumbed to a <lb/>
severe cold, caused by undue exertion in getting <lb/>
ready to do something. I suffered to no purpose, <lb/>
too, because the plan I was figuring at for the <lb/>
extinguishing of the fire was so elaborate that I <lb/>
never got it completed until the middle of the fol- <lb/>
lowing week.</p>
<p>The first time I began to sneeze, a friend told me <lb/>
to go and bathe my feet in hot water and go to bed. <lb/>
I did so. Shortly afterwards, another friend advised <lb/>
me to get up and take a cold shower-bath. I did <lb/>
that also. Within the hour, another friend assured <lb/>
me that it was policy to "feed a cold and starve a <lb/>
fever." I had both. So I thought it best to fill <lb/>
myself up for the cold, and then keep dark and let <lb/>
the fever starve a while.</p>
<p>In a case of this kind, I seldom do things by <lb/>
<pb n="398"/>
halves; I ate pretty heartily; I conferred my custom <lb/>
upon a stranger who had just opened his restaurant <lb/>
that morning; he waited near me in respectful <lb/>
silence until I had finished feeding my cold, when <lb/>
he inquired if the people about Virginia City were <lb/>
much afflicted with colds? I told him I thought <lb/>
they were. He then went out and took in his sign.</p>
<p>I started down toward the office, and on the way <lb/>
encountered another bosom friend, who told me that <lb/>
a quart of salt water, taken warm, would come as <lb/>
near curing a cold as anything in the world. I <lb/>
hardly thought I had room for it, but I tried it any- <lb/>
how. The result was surprising. I believed I had <lb/>
thrown up my immortal soul.</p>
<p>Now, as I am giving my experience only for the <lb/>
benefit of those who are troubled with the distemper <lb/>
I am writing about, I feel that they will see the <lb/>
propriety of my cautioning them against following <lb/>
such portions of it as proved inefficient with me, <lb/>
and acting upon this conviction, I warn them against <lb/>
warm salt water. It may be a good enough remedy, <lb/>
but I think it is too severe. If I had another cold <lb/>
in the head, and there were no course left me <lb/>
but to take either an earthquake or a quart of warm <lb/>
salt water, I would take my chances on the earth- <lb/>
quake.</p>
<p>After the storm which had been raging in my <lb/>
stomach had subsided, and no more good Samaritans <lb/>
happening along, I went on borrowing handkerchiefs <lb/>
again and blowing them to atoms, as had been my <lb/>
<pb n="399"/>
custom in the early stages of my cold, until I came <lb/>
across a lady who had just arrived from over the <lb/>
plains, and who said she had lived in a part of the <lb/>
country where doctors were scarce, and had from <lb/>
necessity acquired considerable skill in the treatment <lb/>
of simple "family complaints." I knew she must <lb/>
have had much experience, for she appeared to be a <lb/>
hundred and fifty years old.</p>
<p>She mixed a decoction composed of molasses, <lb/>
aquafortis, turpentine, and various other drugs, and <lb/>
instructed me to take a wine-glass full of it every <lb/>
fifteen minutes. I never took but one dose; that <lb/>
was enough; it robbed me of all moral principle, <lb/>
and awoke every unworthy impulse of my nature. <lb/>
Under its malign influence my brain conceived <lb/>
miracles of meanness, but my hands were too feeble <lb/>
to execute them; at that time, had it not been that <lb/>
my strength had surrendered to a succession of <lb/>
assaults from infallible remedies for my cold, I am <lb/>
satisfied that I would have tried to rob the grave- <lb/>
yard. Like most other people, I often feel mean, <lb/>
and act accordingly; but until I took that medicine <lb/>
I had never revelled in such supernatural depravity, <lb/>
and felt proud of it. At the end of two days I was <lb/>
ready to go to doctoring again. I took a few more <lb/>
unfailing remedies, and finally drove my cold from <lb/>
my head to my lungs.</p>
<p>I got to coughing incessantly, and my voice fell <lb/>
below zero; I conversed in a thundering bass, two <lb/>
octaves below my natural tone; I could only com- <lb/>
<pb n="400"/>
pass my regular nightly repose by coughing myself <lb/>
down to a state of utter exhaustion, and then the <lb/>
moment I began to talk in my sleep, my discordant <lb/>
voice woke me up again.</p>
<p>My case grew more and more serious every day. <lb/>
Plain gin was recommended; I took it. Then gin <lb/>
and molasses; I took that also. Then gin and <lb/>
onions; I added the onions, and took all three. I <lb/>
detected no particular result, however, except that I <lb/>
had acquired a breath like a buzzard's.</p>
<p>I found I had to travel for my health. I went to <lb/>
Lake Bigler with my reportorial comrade, Wilson. <lb/>
It is gratifying to me to reflect that we traveled in <lb/>
considerable style; we went in the Pioneer coach, <lb/>
and my friend took all his baggage with him, con- <lb/>
sisting of two excellent silk handkerchiefs and a <lb/>
daguerreotype of his grandmother. We sailed and <lb/>
hunted and fished and danced all day, and I doc- <lb/>
tored my cough all night. By managing in this <lb/>
way, I made out to improve every hour in the <lb/>
twenty-four. But my disease continued to grow <lb/>
worse.</p>
<p>A sheet-bath was recommended. I had never re- <lb/>
fused a remedy yet, and it seemed poor policy to <lb/>
commence then; therefore I determined to take a <lb/>
sheet-bath, notwithstanding I had no idea what sort <lb/>
of arrangement it was. It was administered at mid- <lb/>
night, and the weather was very frosty. My breast <lb/>
and back were bared, and a sheet (there appeared <lb/>
to be a thousand yards of it) soaked in ice-water, <lb/>
<pb n="401"/>
was wound around me until I resembled a swab for <lb/>
a Columbiad.</p>
<p>It is a cruel expedient. When the chilly rag <lb/>
touches one's warm flesh, it makes him start with <lb/>
sudden violence, and gasp for breath just as men do <lb/>
in the death agony. It froze the marrow in my <lb/>
bones, and stopped the beating of my heart. I <lb/>
thought my time had come.</p>
<p>Young Wilson said the circumstance reminded <lb/>
him of an anecdote about a negro who was being <lb/>
baptized, and who slipped from the parson's grasp, <lb/>
and came near being drowned. He floundered <lb/>
around, though, and finally rose up out of the <lb/>
water considerably strangled, and furiously angry, <lb/>
and started ashore at once, spouting water like a <lb/>
whale, and remarking, with great asperity, that <lb/>
"one o' dese days some gen'l'man's <foreign lang="ger">nigger</foreign> gwyne <lb/>
to get killed wid jis' such dam foolishness as dis!"</p>
<p>Never take a sheet-bath&#x2014;never. Next to meet- <lb/>
ing a lady acquaintance, who, for reasons best <lb/>
known to herself, don't see you when she looks at <lb/>
you, and don't know you when she does see you, it <lb/>
is the most uncomfortable thing in the world.</p>
<p>But, as I was saying, when the sheet-bath failed <lb/>
to cure my cough, a lady friend recommended the <lb/>
application of a mustard plaster to my breast. I <lb/>
believe that would have cured me effectually, if it <lb/>
had not been for young Wilson. When I went to <lb/>
bed, I put my mustard plaster&#x2014;which was a very <lb/>
gorgeous one, eighteen inches square&#x2014;where I <lb/>
<pb n="402"/>
could reach it when I was ready for it. But young <lb/>
Wilson got hungry in the night, and&#x2014;here is food <lb/>
for the imagination.</p>
<p>After sojourning a week at Lake Bigler, I went to <lb/>
Steamboat Springs, and, beside the steam baths, I <lb/>
took a lot of the vilest medicines that were ever <lb/>
concocted. They would have cured me, but I had <lb/>
to go back to Virginia City, where, notwithstanding <lb/>
the variety of new remedies I absorbed every day, I <lb/>
managed to aggravate my disease by carelessness <lb/>
and undue exposure.</p>
<p>I finally concluded to visit San Francisco, and the <lb/>
first day I got there, a lady at the hotel told me to <lb/>
drink a quart of whisky every twenty-four hours, <lb/>
and a friend up town recommended precisely the <lb/>
same course. Each advised me to take a quart; <lb/>
that made half a gallon. I did it, and still live.</p>
<p>Now, with the kindest motives in the world, I <lb/>
offer for the consideration of consumptive patients <lb/>
the variegated course of treatment I have lately gone <lb/>
through. Let them try it; if it don't cure, it can't <lb/>
more than kill them.</p>

<q>["We have received the following advertisement, but, inasmuch as it <lb/>
concerns a matter of deep and general interest, we feel fully justified in <lb/>
inserting it in our reading columns. We are confident that our conduct <lb/>
in this regard needs only explanation, not apology.&#x2014;<smcap>Ed. N. Y. Herald</smcap>.]</q>
<div3 type="section">
<head>ADVERTISEMENT</head>
<p><smcap>This</smcap> is to inform the public that in connection <lb/>
with Mr. Barnum I have leased the comet for <lb/>
a term of years; and I desire also to solicit the <lb/>
public patronage in favor of a beneficial enterprise <lb/>
which we have in view.</p>
<p>We propose to fit up comfortable, and even <lb/>
luxurious, accommodations in the comet for as <lb/>
many persons as will honor us with their patronage, <lb/>
and make an extended excursion among the heavenly <lb/>
bodies. We shall prepare 1,000,000 staterooms in <lb/>
the tail of the comet (with hot and cold water, gas, <lb/>
looking-glass, parachute, umbrella, etc., in each), <lb/>
and shall construct more if we meet with a suffi- <lb/>
ciently generous encouragement. We shall have <lb/>
billiard rooms, card rooms, music rooms, bowling <lb/>
<pb n="404"/>
alleys and many spacious theaters and free libraries; <lb/>
and on the main deck we propose to have a driving <lb/>
park, with upward of 100,000 miles of roadway in <lb/>
it. We shall publish daily newspapers also.</p>
<q><smcap>departure of the comet</smcap>.</q>
<p>The comet will leave New York at 10 <smcap>p. m.</smcap> on <lb/>
the 20th inst., and therefore it will be desirable that <lb/>
the passengers be on board by eight at the latest, to <lb/>
avoid confusion in getting under way. It is not <lb/>
known whether passports will be necessary or not, <lb/>
but it is deemed best that passengers provide them, <lb/>
and so guard against all contingencies. No dogs <lb/>
will be allowed on board. This rule has been made <lb/>
in deference to the existing state of feeling regarding <lb/>
these animals, and will be strictly adhered to. The <lb/>
safety of the passengers will in all ways be jealously <lb/>
looked to. A substantial iron railing will be put up <lb/>
all around the comet, and no one will be allowed to <lb/>
go to the edge and look over unless accompanied by <lb/>
either my partner or myself.</p>
<q><smcap>the postal service</smcap></q>
<p>will be of the completest character. Of course <lb/>
the telegraph, and the telegraph only, will be em- <lb/>
ployed; consequently friends occupying staterooms <lb/>
20,000,000 and even 30,000,000 miles apart, will be <lb/>
able to send a message and receive a reply inside of <lb/>
eleven days. Night messages will be half rate. The <lb/>
whole of this vast postal system will be under the <lb/>
personal superintendence of Mr. Hale of Maine. <lb/>
<pb n="405"/>
Meals served at all hours. Meals served in state- <lb/>
rooms charged extra.</p>
<p>Hostility is not apprehended from any great <lb/>
planet, but we have thought it best to err on the <lb/>
safe side, and therefore have provided a proper <lb/>
number of mortars, siege guns, and boarding pikes. <lb/>
History shows that small, isolated communities, <lb/>
such as the people of remote islands, are prone to <lb/>
be hostile to strangers, and so the same may be the <lb/>
case with <lb/>
<q><smcap>the inhabitants of stars</smcap></q>
of the tenth or twentieth magnitude. We shall in <lb/>
no case wantonly offend the people of any star, but <lb/>
shall treat all alike with urbanity and kindliness, <lb/>
never conducting ourselves toward an asteroid after <lb/>
a fashion which we could not venture to assume <lb/>
toward Jupiter or Saturn. I repeat that we shall not <lb/>
wantonly offend any star; but at the same time we <lb/>
shall promptly resent any injury that may be done <lb/>
us, or any insolence offered us, by parties or <lb/>
governments residing in any star in the firmament. <lb/>
Although averse to the shedding of blood, we shall <lb/>
still hold this course rigidly and fearlessly, not only <lb/>
toward single stars, but toward constellations. We <lb/>
shall hope to leave a good impression of America <lb/>
behind us in every nation we visit, from Venus to <lb/>
Uranus. And, at all events, if we cannot inspire <lb/>
love we shall at least compel respect for our country <lb/>
wherever we go. We shall take with us, free of <lb/>
charge, <lb/>
<pb n="406"/>
<q><smcap>a great force of missionaries,</smcap></q>
and shed the true light upon all the celestial orbs <lb/>
which, physically aglow, are yet morally in dark- <lb/>
ness. Sunday-schools will be established wherever <lb/>
practicable. Compulsory education will also be <lb/>
introduced.</p>
<p>The comet will visit Mars first, and proceed to <lb/>
Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. Parties con- <lb/>
nected with the government of the District of <lb/>
Columbia and with the former city government of <lb/>
New York, who may desire to inspect the rings, will <lb/>
be allowed time and every facility. Every star of <lb/>
prominent magnitude will be visited, and time <lb/>
allowed for excursions to points of interest inland.</p>
<q><smcap>the dog star</smcap></q>
<p>has been stricken from the programme. Much time <lb/>
will be spent in the Great Bear, and, indeed, of <lb/>
every constellation of importance. So, also, with <lb/>
the Sun and Moon and the Milky Way, otherwise <lb/>
the Gulf Stream of the skies. Clothing suitable for <lb/>
wear in the sun should be provided. Our pro- <lb/>
gramme has been so arranged that we shall seldom <lb/>
go more than 100,000,000 of miles at a time without <lb/>
stopping at some star. This will necessarily make <lb/>
the stoppages frequent and preserve the interest of <lb/>
the tourist. Baggage checked through to any point <lb/>
on the route. Parties desiring to make only a part <lb/>
of the proposed tour, and thus save expense, may <lb/>
stop over at any star they choose and wait for the <lb/>
return voyage.</p>
<pb n="407"/>
<p>After visiting all the most celebrated stars and <lb/>
constellations in our system and personally inspect- <lb/>
ing the remotest sparks that even the most powerful <lb/>
telescope can now detect in the firmament, we shall <lb/>
proceed with good heart upon <lb/>
<q><smcap>a stupendous voyage</smcap></q>
of discovery among the countless whirling worlds <lb/>
that make turmoil in the mighty wastes of space that <lb/>
stretch their solemn solitudes, their unimaginable <lb/>
vastness billions upon billions of miles away beyond <lb/>
the farthest verge of telescopic vision, till by com- <lb/>
parison the little sparkling vault we used to gaze at <lb/>
on Earth shall seem like a remembered phosphores- <lb/>
cent flash of spangles which some tropical voyager's <lb/>
prow stirred into life for a single instant, and which <lb/>
ten thousand miles of phosphorescent seas and <lb/>
tedious lapse of time had since diminished to an <lb/>
incident utterly trivial in his recollection. Children <lb/>
occupying seats at the first table will be charged full <lb/>
fare.</p>
<q><smcap>first class fare</smcap></q>
<p>from the Earth to Uranus, including visits to the <lb/>
Sun and Moon and all the principal planets on the <lb/>
route, will be charged at the low rate of &#x0024;2 for every <lb/>
50,000,000 miles of actual travel. A great reduc- <lb/>
tion will be made where parties wish to make the <lb/>
round trip. This comet is new and in thorough <lb/>
repair and is now on her first voyage. She is con- <lb/>
fessedly the fastest on the line. She makes 20,- <lb/>
<pb n="408"/>
000,000 miles a day, with her present facilities; but, <lb/>
with a picked American crew and good weather, we <lb/>
are confident we can get 40,000,000 out of her. <lb/>
Still, we shall never push her to a dangerous speed, <lb/>
and we shall rigidly prohibit racing with other <lb/>
comets. Passengers desiring to diverge at any point <lb/>
or return will be transferred to other comets. We <lb/>
make close connections at all principal points with all <lb/>
reliable lines. Safety can be depended upon. It is <lb/>
not to be denied that the heavens are infested with <lb/>
<q><smcap>old ramshackle comets</smcap></q>
that have not been inspected or overhauled in 10,000 <lb/>
years, and which ought long ago to have been de- <lb/>
stroyed or turned into hail barges, but with these we <lb/>
have no connection whatever. Steerage passengers <lb/>
not allowed abaft the main hatch.</p>
<p>Complimentary round trip tickets have been <lb/>
tendered to General Butler, Mr. Shepherd, Mr. <lb/>
Richardson, and other eminent gentlemen, whose <lb/>
public services have entitled them to the rest and <lb/>
relaxation of a voyage of this kind. Parties desiring <lb/>
to make the round trip will have extra accommoda- <lb/>
tion. The entire voyage will be completed, and the <lb/>
passengers landed in New York again on the 14th <lb/>
of December, 1991. This is, at least, forty years <lb/>
quicker than any other comet can do it in. Nearly <lb/>
all the back pay members contemplate making the <lb/>
round trip with us in case their constituents will <lb/>
allow them a holiday. Every harmless amusement <lb/>
will be allowed on board, but no pools permitted on <lb/>
<pb n="409"/>
the run of the comet&#x2014;no gambling of any kind. <lb/>
All fixed stars will be respected by us, but such stars <lb/>
as seem to need fixing we shall fix. If it makes <lb/>
trouble we shall be sorry, but firm.</p>
<p>Mr. Coggia having leased his comet to us, she <lb/>
will no longer be called by his name but by my <lb/>
partner's. N. B.&#x2014;Passengers by paying double <lb/>
fare will be entitled to a share in all the new stars, <lb/>
suns, moons, comets, meteors, and magazines of <lb/>
thunder and lightning we may discover. Patent <lb/>
medicine people will take notice that <lb/>
<q><smcap>we carry bulletin boards</smcap></q>
and a paint brush along for use in the constellations, <lb/>
and are open to terms. Cremationists are reminded <lb/>
that we are going straight to&#x2014;some hot places&#x2014; <lb/>
and are open to terms. To other parties our enter- <lb/>
prise is a pleasure excursion, but individually we <lb/>
mean business. We shall fly our comet for all it is <lb/>
worth.</p>
<q><smcap>for further particulars,</smcap></q>
<p>or for freight or passage, apply on board, or to <lb/>
my partner, but not to me, since I do not take <lb/>
charge of the comet until she is under weigh. It is <lb/>
necessary, at a time like this, that my mind should <lb/>
not be burdened with small business details.</p>

<head><b>RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR</b><ref target="n47">*</ref><note id="n47" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Written about 1870.</p></note></head>
<p><smcap>A few</smcap> months ago I was nominated for Governor <lb/>
of the great State of New York, to run against <lb/>
Mr. John T. Smith and Mr. Blank J. Blank on an <lb/>
independent ticket. I somehow felt that I had one <lb/>
prominent advantage over these gentlemen, and that <lb/>
was&#x2014;good character. It was easy to see by the <lb/>
newspapers that if ever they had known what it was <lb/>
to bear a good name, that time had gone by. It <lb/>
was plain that in these latter years they had become <lb/>
familiar with all manner of shameful crimes. But <lb/>
at the very moment that I was exalting my advan- <lb/>
tage and joying in it in secret, there was a muddy <lb/>
undercurrent of discomfort "riling" the deeps of <lb/>
my happiness, and that was&#x2014;the having to hear <lb/>
my name bandied about in familiar connection with <lb/>
those of such people. I grew more and more dis- <lb/>
turbed. Finally I wrote my grandmother about it. <lb/>
Her answer came quick and sharp. She said: <lb/>
<q>"You have never done one single thing in all your life to be <lb/>
ashamed of&#x2014;not one. Look at the newspapers&#x2014;look at them and com- <lb/>
prehend what sort of characters Messrs. Smith and Blank are, and then <lb/>
<pb n="411"/>
see if you are willing to lower yourself to their level and enter a public <lb/>
canvass with them."</q></p>
<p>It was my very thought! I did not sleep a single <lb/>
moment that night. But after all I could not recede. <lb/>
I was fully committed, and must go on with the <lb/>
fight. As I was looking listlessly over the papers at <lb/>
breakfast I came across this paragraph, and I may <lb/>
truly say I never was so confounded before.</p>
<q>"<smcap>Perjury</smcap>.&#x2014;Perhaps, now that Mr. Mark Twain is before the peo- <lb/>
ple as a candidate for Governor, he will condescend to explain how he <lb/>
came to be convicted of perjury by thirty-four witnesses in Wakawak, <lb/>
Cochin China, in 1863, the intent of which perjury being to rob a poor <lb/>
native widow and her helpless family of a meagre plantain-patch, their <lb/>
only stay and support in their bereavement and desolation. Mr. Twain <lb/>
owes it to himself, as well as to the great people whose suffrages he <lb/>
asks, to clear this matter up. Will he do it?"</q>
<p>I thought I should burst with amazement! Such <lb/>
a cruel, heartless charge. I never had <i>seen</i> Cochin <lb/>
China! I never had <i>heard</i> of Wakawak! I didn't <lb/>
know a plantain-patch from a kangaroo! I did not <lb/>
know what to do. I was crazed and helpless. I <lb/>
let the day slip away without doing anything at all. <lb/>
The next morning the same paper had this&#x2014;noth- <lb/>
ing more: <lb/>
<q>"<smcap>Significant</smcap>.&#x2014;Mr. Twain, it will be observed, is suggestively <lb/>
silent about the Cochin China perjury."</q></p>
<p>[<i>Mem</i>.&#x2014;During the rest of the campaign this <lb/>
paper never referred to me in any other way than as <lb/>
"the infamous perjurer Twain."]</p>
<p>Next came the <i>Gazette</i>, with this: <lb/>
<q>"<smcap>Wanted to Know</smcap>.&#x2014;Will the new candidate for Governor deign <lb/>
<pb n="412"/>
to explain to certain of his fellow-citizens (who are suffering to vote for <lb/>
him!) the little circumstance of his cabin-mates in Montana losing small <lb/>
valuables from time to time, until at last, these things having been <lb/>
invariably found on Mr. Twain's person or in his 'trunk' (newspaper he <lb/>
rolled his traps in), they felt compelled to give him a friendly admoni- <lb/>
tion for his own good, and so tarred and feathered him, and rode him <lb/>
on a rail, and then advised him to leave a permanent vacuum in <lb/>
the place he usually occupied in the camp. Will he do this?"</q></p>
<p><i>Could</i> anything be more deliberately malicious <lb/>
than that? For I never was in Montana in my life.</p>
<p>[After this, this journal customarily spoke of me <lb/>
as "Twain, the Montana Thief."]</p>
<p>I got to picking up papers apprehensively&#x2014; <lb/>
much as one would lift a desired blanket which he <lb/>
had some idea might have a rattlesnake under it. <lb/>
One day this met my eye: <lb/>
<q>"<smcap>The Lie Nailed</smcap>.&#x2014;By the sworn affidavits of Michael O'Flan- <lb/>
agan, Esq., of the Five Points, and Mr. Snub Rafferty and Mr. Catty <lb/>
Mulligan, of Water Street, it is established that Mr. Mark Twain's vile <lb/>
statement that the lamented grandfather of our noble standard-bearer, <lb/>
Blank J. Blank, was hanged for highway robbery, is a brutal and <lb/>
gratuitous <smcap>lie</smcap>, without a shadow of foundation in fact. It is dishearten- <lb/>
ing to virtuous men to see such shameful means resorted to to achieve <lb/>
political success as the attacking of the dead in their graves, and defiling <lb/>
their honored names with slander. When we think of the anguish this <lb/>
miserable falsehood must cause the innocent relatives and friends of the <lb/>
deceased, we are almost driven to incite an outraged and insulted public <lb/>
to summary and unlawful vengeance upon the traducer. But no! let us <lb/>
leave him to the agony of a lacerated conscience (though if passion <lb/>
should get the better of the public, and in its blind fury they should do <lb/>
the traducer bodily injury, it is but too obvious that no jury could con- <lb/>
vict and no court punish the perpetrators of the deed)."</q></p>
<p>The ingenious closing sentence had the effect of <lb/>
moving me out of bed with dispatch that night, and <lb/>
out at the back door also, while the "outraged and <lb/>
<pb n="413"/>
insulted public" surged in the front way, breaking <lb/>
furniture and windows in their righteous indignation <lb/>
as they came, and taking off such property as they <lb/>
could carry when they went. And yet I can lay <lb/>
my hand upon the Book and say that I never <lb/>
slandered Mr. Blank's grandfather. More: I had <lb/>
never even heard of him or mentioned him up to <lb/>
that day and date.</p>
<p>[I will state, in passing, that the journal above <lb/>
quoted from always referred to me afterward as <lb/>
"Twain, the Body-Snatcher."]</p>
<p>The next newspaper article that attracted my at <lb/>
tention was the following: <lb/>
<q>"<smcap>A Sweet Candidate</smcap>.&#x2014;Mr. Mark Twain, who was to make such <lb/>
a blighting speech at the mass meeting of the Independents last night, <lb/>
didn't come to time! A telegram from his physician stated that he had <lb/>
been knocked down by a runaway team, and his leg broken in two <lb/>
places&#x2014;sufferer lying in great agony, and so forth, and so forth, and a <lb/>
lot more bosh of the same sort. And the Independents tried hard to <lb/>
swallow the wretched subterfuge, and pretend that they did not know <lb/>
what was the <i>real</i> reason of the absence of the abandoned creature whom <lb/>
they denominate their standard-bearer. <i>A certain man was seen to <lb/>
reel into Mr. Twain's hotel last night in a state of beastly intoxica- <lb/>
tion</i>. It is the imperative duty of the Independents to prove that this <lb/>
besotted brute was not Mark Twain himself. We have them at last! <lb/>
This is a case that admits of no shirking. The voice of the people <lb/>
demands in thunder-tones, '<smcap>Who was that man</smcap>?'"</q></p>
<p>It was incredible, absolutely incredible, for a mo- <lb/>
ment, that it was really my name that was coupled <lb/>
with this disgraceful suspicion. Three long years <lb/>
had passed over my head since I had tasted ale, <lb/>
beer, wine, or liquor of any kind.</p>
<pb n="414"/>
<p>[It shows what effect the times were having on <lb/>
me when I say that I saw myself confidently dubbed <lb/>
"Mr. Delirium Tremens Twain" in the next issue <lb/>
of that journal without a pang&#x2014;notwithstanding I <lb/>
knew that with monotonous fidelity the paper would <lb/>
go on calling me so to the very end.]</p>
<p>By this time anonymous letters were getting to be <lb/>
an important part of my mail matter. This form <lb/>
was common: <lb/>
<q>"How about that old woman you kiked of your premisers which <lb/>
was beging.</q>
<q><smcap>Pol Pry</smcap>."</q></p>
<p>And this: <lb/>
<q>"There is things which you have done which is unbeknowens to any- <lb/>
body but me. You better trot out a few dols. to yours truly, or you'll <lb/>
hear through the papers from</q>
<q><smcap>Handy Andy</smcap>."</q></p>
<p>This is about the idea. I could continue them till <lb/>
the reader was surfeited, if desirable.</p>
<p>Shortly the principal Republican journal "con- <lb/>
victed" me of wholesale bribery, and the leading <lb/>
Democratic paper "nailed" an aggravated case of <lb/>
blackmailing to me.</p>
<p>[In this way I acquired two additional names: <lb/>
"Twain the Filthy Corruptionist," and "Twain the <lb/>
Loathsome Embracer."]</p>
<p>By this time there had grown to be such a clamor <lb/>
for an "answer" to all the dreadful charges that <lb/>
were laid to me that the editors and leaders of my <lb/>
party said it would be political ruin for me to re- <lb/>
main silent any longer. As if to make their appeal <lb/>
<pb n="415"/>
the more imperative, the following appeared in one <lb/>
of the papers the very next day: <lb/>
<q>"<smcap>Behold the Man</smcap>!&#x2014;The independent candidate still maintains <lb/>
silence. Because he dare not speak. Every accusation against him has <lb/>
been amply proved, and they have been endorsed and re-endorsed by <lb/>
his own eloquent silence, till at this day he stands forever convicted. <lb/>
Look upon your candidate, Independents! Look upon the Infamous <lb/>
Perjurer! the Montana Thief! the Body-Snatcher! Contemplate your <lb/>
incarnate Delirium Tremens! your Filthy Corruptionist! your Loathsome <lb/>
Embracer! Gaze upon him&#x2014;ponder him well&#x2014;and then say if you can <lb/>
give your honest votes to a creature who has earned this dismal array of <lb/>
titles by his hideous crimes, and dares not open his mouth in denial of <lb/>
any one of them!"</q></p>
<p>There was no possible way of getting out of it, <lb/>
and so, in deep humiliation, I set about preparing to <lb/>
"answer" a mass of baseless charges and mean <lb/>
and wicked falsehoods. But I never finished the <lb/>
task, for the very next morning a paper came out <lb/>
with a new horror, a fresh malignity, and seriously <lb/>
charged me with burning a lunatic asylum with all <lb/>
its inmates, because it obstructed the view from my <lb/>
house. This threw me into a sort of panic. Then <lb/>
came the charge of poisoning my uncle to get his <lb/>
property, with an imperative demand that the grave <lb/>
should be opened. This drove me to the verge of <lb/>
distraction. On top of this I was accused of em- <lb/>
ploying toothless and incompetent old relatives to <lb/>
prepare the food for the foundling hospital when I <lb/>
was warden. I was wavering&#x2014;wavering. And at <lb/>
last, as a due and fitting climax to the shameless <lb/>
persecution that party rancor had inflicted upon me, <lb/>
nine little toddling children, of all shades of color <lb/>
<pb n="416"/>
and degrees of raggedness, were taught to rush on <lb/>
to the platform at a public meeting, and clasp me <lb/>
around the legs and call me <smcap>Pa</smcap>!</p>
<p>I gave it up. I hauled down my colors and sur- <lb/>
rendered. I was not equal to the requirements of a <lb/>
Gubernatorial campaign in the State of New York, <lb/>
and so I sent in my withdrawal from the candidacy, <lb/>
and in bitterness of spirit signed it, "Truly yours, <lb/>
<i>once</i> a decent man, but now</p>
<p><smcap>Mark Twain</smcap>, I.P., M.T., B.S., D.T., F.C., and <lb/>
L.E."</p>

<head><b>A MYSTERIOUS VISIT</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> first notice that was taken of me when I <lb/>
"settled down" recently, was by a gentleman <lb/>
who said he was an assessor, and connected with <lb/>
the U. S. Internal Revenue Department. I said I <lb/>
had never heard of his branch of business before, <lb/>
but I was very glad to see him all the same&#x2014;would <lb/>
he sit down? He sat down. I did not know any- <lb/>
thing particular to say, and yet I felt that people <lb/>
who have arrived at the dignity of keeping house <lb/>
must be conversational, must be easy and sociable <lb/>
in company. So, in default of anything else to <lb/>
say, I asked him if he was opening his shop in our <lb/>
neighborhood.</p>
<p>He said he was. [I did not wish to appear igno- <lb/>
rant, but I <i>had</i> hoped he would mention what he <lb/>
had for sale.]</p>
<p>I ventured to ask him "How was trade?" And <lb/>
he said "So-so."</p>
<p>I then said we would drop in, and if we liked his <lb/>
house as well as any other, we would give him our <lb/>
custom.</p>
<p>He said he thought we would like his establish- <lb/>
<pb n="418"/>
ment well enough to confine ourselves to it&#x2014;said <lb/>
he never saw anybody who would go off and hunt up <lb/>
another man in his line after trading with him once.</p>
<p>That sounded pretty complacent, but barring that <lb/>
natural expression of villainy which we all have, the <lb/>
man looked honest enough.</p>
<p>I do not know how it came about exactly, but <lb/>
gradually we appeared to melt down and run to- <lb/>
gether, conversationally speaking, and then every- <lb/>
thing went along as comfortably as clockwork.</p>
<p>We talked, and talked, and talked&#x2014;at least I <lb/>
did; and we laughed, and laughed, and laughed&#x2014; <lb/>
at least he did. But all the time I had my presence <lb/>
of mind about me&#x2014;I had my native shrewdness <lb/>
turned on "full head," as the engineers say. I <lb/>
was determined to find out all about his business in <lb/>
spite of his obscure answers&#x2014;and I was determined <lb/>
I would have it out of him without his suspecting <lb/>
what I was at. I meant to trap him with a deep, <lb/>
deep ruse. I would tell him all about my own busi- <lb/>
ness, and he would naturally so warm to me during <lb/>
this seductive burst of confidence that he would for- <lb/>
get himself, and tell me all about <i>his</i> affairs before <lb/>
he suspected what I was about. I thought to <lb/>
myself, My son, you little know what an old fox <lb/>
you are dealing with. I said:</p>
<p>"Now you never would guess what I made lectur- <lb/>
ing this winter and last spring?"</p>
<p>"No&#x2014;don't believe I could, to save me. Let <lb/>
me see&#x2014;let me see. About two thousand dollars, <lb/>
<pb n="419"/>
maybe? But no; no, sir, I know you couldn't <lb/>
have made that much. Say seventeen hundred, <lb/>
maybe?"</p>
<p>"Ha! ha! I knew you couldn't. My lecturing <lb/>
receipts for last spring and this winter were fourteen <lb/>
thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars. What do <lb/>
you think of that?"</p>
<p>"Why, it is amazing&#x2014;perfectly amazing. I will <lb/>
make a note of it. And you say even this wasn't <lb/>
all?"</p>
<p>"All! Why bless you, there was my income <lb/>
from the <i>Daily Warwhoop</i> for four months&#x2014;about <lb/>
&#x2014;about&#x2014;well, what should you say to about eight <lb/>
thousand dollars, for instance?"</p>
<p>"Say! Why, I should say I should like to see <lb/>
myself rolling in just such another ocean of afflu- <lb/>
ence. Eight thousand! I'll make a note of it. <lb/>
Why man!&#x2014;and on top of all this I am to under- <lb/>
stand that you had still more income?"</p>
<p>"Ha! ha! ha! Why, you're only in the suburbs <lb/>
of it, so to speak. There's my book, 'The Inno- <lb/>
cents Abroad'&#x2014;price &#x0024;3.50 to &#x0024;5, according to <lb/>
the binding. Listen to me. Look me in the eye. <lb/>
During the last four months and a half, saying noth- <lb/>
ing of sales before that, but just simply during the <lb/>
four months and a half, we've sold ninety-five thou- <lb/>
sand copies of that book. Ninety-five thousand! <lb/>
Think of it. Average four dollars a copy, say. It's <lb/>
nearly four hundred thousand dollars, my son. I <lb/>
get half."</p>
<pb n="420"/>
<p>"The suffering Moses! I'll set <i>that</i> down <lb/>
Fourteen-seven-fifty&#x2014;eight&#x2014;two hundred. Total, <lb/>
say&#x2014;well, upon my word, the grand total is about <lb/>
two hundred and thirteen or fourteen thousand dol- <lb/>
lars! <i>Is</i> that possible?"</p>
<p>"Possible! If there's any mistake it's the other <lb/>
way. Two hundred and fourteen thousand, cash, is <lb/>
my income for this year if <i>I</i> know how to cipher."</p>
<p>Then the gentleman got up to go. It came over <lb/>
me most uncomfortably that maybe I had made my <lb/>
revelations for nothing, besides being flattered into <lb/>
stretching them considerably by the stranger's aston- <lb/>
ished exclamations. But no; at the last moment <lb/>
the gentleman handed me a large envelope, and said <lb/>
it contained his advertisement; and that I would <lb/>
find out all about his business in it; and that he <lb/>
would be happy to have my custom&#x2014;would, in <lb/>
fact, be <i>proud</i> to have the custom of a man of such <lb/>
prodigious income; and that he used to think there <lb/>
were several wealthy men in the city, but when they <lb/>
came to trade with him, he discovered that they <lb/>
barely had enough to live on; and that, in truth, it <lb/>
had been such a weary, weary age since he had seen <lb/>
a rich man face to face, and talked to him, and <lb/>
touched him with his hands, that he could hardly <lb/>
refrain from embracing me&#x2014;in fact, would esteem <lb/>
it a great favor if I would <i>let</i> him embrace me.</p>
<p>This so pleased me that I did not try to resist, <lb/>
but allowed this simple-hearted stranger to throw <lb/>
his arms about me and weep a few tranquilizing <lb/>
<pb n="421"/>
tears down the back of my neck. Then he went his <lb/>
way.</p>
<p>As soon as he was gone I opened his advertise- <lb/>
ment. I studied it attentively for four minutes. I <lb/>
then called up the cook, and said:</p>
<p>"Hold me while I faint! Let Marie turn the <lb/>
griddle-cakes."</p>
<p>By and by, when I came to, I sent down to the <lb/>
rum mill on the corner and hired an artist by the <lb/>
week to sit up nights and curse that stranger, and <lb/>
give me a lift occasionally in the daytime when I <lb/>
came to a hard place.</p>
<p>Ah, what a miscreant he was! His "advertise- <lb/>
ment" was nothing in the world but a wicked tax- <lb/>
return&#x2014;a string of impertinent questions about my <lb/>
private affairs, occupying the best part of four fools- <lb/>
cap pages of fine print&#x2014;questions, I may remark, <lb/>
gotten up with such marvelous ingenuity, that the <lb/>
oldest man in the world couldn't understand what <lb/>
the most of them were driving at&#x2014;questions, too, <lb/>
that were calculated to make a man report about <lb/>
four times his actual income to keep from swearing <lb/>
to a falsehood. I looked for a loophole, but there <lb/>
did not appear to be any. Inquiry No. 1 covered <lb/>
my case as generously and as amply as an umbrella <lb/>
could cover an ant hill: <lb/>
<q>"What were your profits, during the past year, from any trade <lb/>
business, or vocation, wherever carried on?"</q></p>
<p>And that inquiry was backed up by thirteen <lb/>
others of an equally searching nature, the most <lb/>
<pb n="422"/>
modest of which required information as to whether <lb/>
I had committed any burglary or highway robbery, <lb/>
or by any arson or other secret source of emolu- <lb/>
ment had acquired property which was not enumer- <lb/>
ated in my statement of income as set opposite to <lb/>
inquiry No. 1.</p>
<p>It was plain that that stranger had enabled me to <lb/>
make a goose of myself. It was very, very plain; <lb/>
and so I went out and hired another artist. By <lb/>
working on my vanity, the stranger had seduced me <lb/>
into declaring an income of &#x0024;214,000. By law, <lb/>
&#x0024;1,000 of this was exempt from income tax&#x2014;the <lb/>
only relief I could see, and it was only a drop in the <lb/>
ocean. At the legal five per cent., I must pay to <lb/>
the Government the sum of ten thousand six hun- <lb/>
dred and fifty dollars, income tax!</p>
<p>[I may remark, in this place, that I did not do it.]</p>
<p>I am acquainted with a very opulent man, whose <lb/>
house is a palace, whose table is regal, whose out- <lb/>
lays are enormous, yet a man who has no income, <lb/>
as I have often noticed by the revenue returns; and <lb/>
to him I went for advice in my distress. He took <lb/>
my dreadful exhibition of receipts, he put on his <lb/>
glasses, he took his pen, and presto!&#x2014;I was a <lb/>
pauper! It was the neatest thing that ever was. <lb/>
He did it simply by deftly manipulating the bill of <lb/>
"<smcap>Deductions</smcap>." He set down my "State, national, <lb/>
and municipal taxes" at so much; my "losses by <lb/>
shipwreck, fire, etc.," at so much; my "losses on <lb/>
sales of real estate"&#x2014;on "live stock sold"&#x2014;on <lb/>
<pb n="423"/>
"payments for rent of homestead"&#x2014;on "repairs, <lb/>
improvements, interest"&#x2014;on "previously taxed <lb/>
salary as an officer of the United States army, <lb/>
navy, revenue service," and other things. He got <lb/>
astonishing "deductions" out of each and every <lb/>
one of these matters&#x2014;each and every one of them. <lb/>
And when he was done he handed me the paper, <lb/>
and I saw at a glance that during the year my in- <lb/>
come, in the way of profits, had been <i>one thousand <lb/>
two hundred and fifty dollars and forty cents.</i></p>
<p>"Now," said he, "the thousand dollars is ex- <lb/>
empt by law. What you want to do is to go and <lb/>
swear this document in and pay tax on the two hun- <lb/>
dred and fifty dollars."</p>
<p>[While he was making this speech his little boy <lb/>
Willie lifted a two dollar greenback out of his vest <lb/>
pocket and vanished with it, and I would wager <lb/>
anything that if my stranger were to call on that <lb/>
little boy to-morrow he would make a false return <lb/>
of his income.]</p>
<p>"Do you," said I, "do you always work up the <lb/>
'deductions' after this fashion in your own case, <lb/>
sir?"</p>
<p>"Well, I should say so! If it weren't for those <lb/>
eleven saving clauses under the head of 'Deduction' <lb/>
I should be beggared every year to support this <lb/>
hateful and wicked, this extortionate and tyrannical <lb/>
government."</p>
<p>This gentleman stands away up among the very <lb/>
best of the solid men of the city&#x2014;the men of moral <lb/>
<pb n="424"/>
weight, of commercial integrity, of unimpeachable <lb/>
social spotlessness&#x2014;and so I bowed to his example. <lb/>
I went down to the revenue office, and under the <lb/>
accusing eyes of my old visitor I stood up and swore <lb/>
to lie after lie, fraud after fraud, villainy after <lb/>
villainy, till my soul was coated inches and inches <lb/>
thick with perjury, and my self-respect gone forever <lb/>
and ever.</p>
<p>But what of it? It is nothing more than thou- <lb/>
sands of the richest and proudest, and most re- <lb/>
spected, honored, and courted men in America do <lb/>
every year. And so I don't care. I am not <lb/>
ashamed. I shall simply, for the present, talk little, <lb/>
and eschew fire-proof gloves, lest I fall into certain <lb/>
dreadful habits irrevocably.</p>
<p>THE END.</p>
