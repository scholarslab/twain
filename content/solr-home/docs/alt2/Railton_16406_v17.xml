<head><b>TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE</b></head>
<p><smcap>To arrive</smcap> at a just estimate of a renowned man's <lb/> character one must judge it
by the standards of his <lb/> time, not ours. Judged by the standards of one <lb/> century, the
noblest characters of an earlier one lose <lb/> much of their luster; judged by the standards of to-
<lb/> day, there is probably no illustrious man of four or <lb/> five centuries ago whose character
could meet the <lb/> test at all points. But the character of Joan of Arc <lb/> is unique. It can be
measured by the standards of <lb/> all times without misgiving or apprehension as to <lb/> the
result. Judged by any of them, judged by all <lb/> of them, it is still flawless, it is still
ideally perfect; <lb/> it still occupies the loftiest place possible to human <lb/> attainment, a
loftier one than has been reached by <lb/> any other mere mortal.</p>
<p>When we reflect that her century was the brutalest, <lb/> the wickedest, the rottenest in history
since the <lb/> darkest ages, we are lost in wonder at the miracle <lb/> of such a product from such
a soil. The contrast <lb/> between her and her century is the contrast between <lb/>
<pb n="vi"/> day and night. She was truthful when lying was <lb/> the common speech of men; she was
honest when <lb/> honesty was become a lost virtue; she was a keeper <lb/> of promises when the
keeping of a promise was ex- <lb/> pected of no one; she gave her great mind to great <lb/> thoughts
and great purposes when other great minds <lb/> wasted themselves upon pretty fancies or upon poor
<lb/> ambitions; she was modest, and fine, and delicate <lb/> when to be loud and coarse might be
said to be <lb/> universal; she was full of pity when a merciless <lb/> cruelty was the rule; she
was steadfast when stability <lb/> was unknown, and honorable in an age which had <lb/> forgotten
what honor was; she was a rock of con- <lb/> victions in a time when men believed in nothing and
<lb/> scoffed at all things; she was unfailingly true in an <lb/> age that was false to the core;
she maintained her <lb/> personal dignity unimpaired in an age of fawnings <lb/> and servilities;
she was of a dauntless courage when <lb/> hope and courage had perished in the hearts of her <lb/>
nation; she was spotlessly pure in mind and body <lb/> when society in the highest places was foul
in both <lb/> &#x2014;she was all these things in an age when crime was <lb/> the common business of
lords and princes, and when <lb/> the highest personages in Christendom were able to <lb/> astonish
even that infamous era and make it stand <lb/> aghast at the spectacle of their atrocious lives
black <lb/>
<pb n="vii"/> with unimaginable treacheries, butcheries, and <lb/> beastialities.</p>
<p>She was perhaps the only entirely unselfish person <lb/> whose name has a place in profane
history. No <lb/> vestige or suggestion of self-seeking can be found in <lb/> any word or deed of
hers. When she had rescued <lb/> her King from his vagabondage, and set his crown <lb/> upon his
head, she was offered rewards and honors, <lb/> but she refused them all, and would take nothing.
<lb/> All she would take for herself&#x2014;if the King would <lb/> grant it&#x2014;was leave to go
back to her village home, <lb/> and tend her sheep again, and feel her mother's <lb/> arms about
her, and be her housemaid and helper. <lb/> The selfishness of this unspoiled general of victori-
<lb/> ous armies, companion of princes, and idol of an <lb/> applauding and grateful nation, reached
but that far <lb/> and no farther.</p>
<p>The work wrought by Joan of Arc may fairly be <lb/> regarded as ranking any recorded in history,
when <lb/> one considers the conditions under which it was <lb/> undertaken, the obstacles in the
way, and the means <lb/> at her disposal. C&#x00E6;sar carried conquest far, but <lb/> he did it
with the trained and confident veterans of <lb/> Rome, and was a trained soldier himself; and Napo-
<lb/> leon swept away the disciplined armies of Europe, <lb/> but he also was a trained soldier, and
he began his <pb n="viii"/> work with patriot battalions inflamed and inspired by <lb/> the
miracle-working new breath of Liberty breathed <lb/> upon them by the Revolution&#x2014;eager young
ap- <lb/> prentices to the splendid trade of war, not old and <lb/> broken men-at-arms, despairing
survivors of an age- <lb/> long accumulation of monotonous defeats; but Joan <lb/> of Arc, a mere
child in years, ignorant, unlettered, <lb/> a poor village girl unknown and without influence, <lb/>
found a great nation lying in chains, helpless and <lb/> hopeless under an alien domination, its
treasury <lb/> bankrupt, its soldiers disheartened and dispersed, all <lb/> spirit torpid, all
courage dead in the hearts of the <lb/> people through long years of foreign and domestic <lb/>
outrage and oppression, their King cowed, resigned <lb/> to its fate, and preparing to fly the
country; and <lb/> she laid her hand upon this nation, this corpse, and <lb/> it rose and followed
her. She led it from victory <lb/> to victory, she turned back the tide of the Hundred <lb/> Years'
War, she fatally crippled the English power, <lb/> and died with the earned title of
<smcap>Deliverer of <lb/> France</smcap>, which she bears to this day.</p>
<p>And for all reward, the French King, whom she <lb/> had crowned, stood supine and indifferent,
while <lb/> French priests took the noble child, the most inno- <lb/> cent, the most lovely, the
most adorable the ages <lb/> have produced, and burned her alive at the stake.</p>

<head><b>A PECULIARITY OF JOAN OF ARC'S <lb/> HISTORY</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> details of the life of Joan of Arc form a <lb/> biography which is unique
among the world's bio- <lb/> graphies in one respect: <i>It is the only story of a <lb/> human life
which comes to us under oath,</i> the only <lb/> one which comes to us from the witness-stand. The
<lb/> official records of the Great Trial of 1431, and of <lb/> the Process of Rehabilitation of a
quarter of a cen- <lb/> tury later, are still preserved in the National Archives <lb/> of France,
and they furnish with remarkable fullness <lb/> the facts of her life. The history of no other life
of <lb/> that remote time is known with either the certainty <lb/> or the comprehensiveness that
attaches to hers.</p>
<p>The Sieur Louis de Conte is faithful to her official <lb/> history in his Personal Recollections,
and thus far <lb/> his trustworthiness is unimpeachable; but his mass <lb/> of added particulars
must depend for credit upon <lb/> his own word alone.</p>

<div2 type="chapter">
<pb n="xv"/>
<head>THE SIEUR LOUIS DE CONTE <lb/>
<smcap>to his great-great-grand nephews and nieces</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>This</smcap> is the year 1492. I am eighty-two years of <lb/> age. The things I am going
to tell you are things <lb/> which I saw myself as a child and as a youth.</p>
<p>In all the tales and songs and histories of Joan of <lb/> Arc, which you and the rest of the
world read and <lb/> sing and study in the books wrought in the late <lb/> invented art of printing,
mention is made of me, the <lb/> Sieur Louis de Conte&#x2014;I was her page and secre- <lb/> tary. I
was with her from the beginning until the <lb/> end.</p>
<p>I was reared in the same village with her. I <lb/> played with her every day, when we were little
chil- <lb/> dren together, just as you play with your mates. <lb/> Now that we perceive how great
she was, now that <lb/> her name fills the whole world, it seems strange that <lb/> what I am saying
is true; for it is as if a perishable <lb/> paltry candle should speak of the eternal sun riding
<lb/> in the heavens and say, "He was gossip and house- <lb/>
<pb n="xvi"/> mate to me when we were candles together." And <lb/> yet it is true, just as I say. I
was her playmate, <lb/> and I fought at her side in the wars; to this day I <lb/> carry in my mind,
fine and clear, the picture of that <lb/> dear little figure, with breast bent to the flying <lb/>
horse's neck, charging at the head of the armies of <lb/> France, her hair streaming back, her
silver mail <lb/> plowing steadily deeper and deeper into the thick of <lb/> the battle, sometimes
nearly drowned from sight by <lb/> tossing heads of horses, uplifted sword-arms, wind- <lb/> blown
plumes, and intercepting shields. I was with <lb/> her to the end; and when that black day came
<lb/> whose accusing shadow will lie always upon the <lb/> memory of the mitered French slaves of
England <lb/> who were her assassins, and upon France who stood <lb/> idle and essayed no rescue, my
hand was the last <lb/> she touched in life.</p>
<p>As the years and the decades drifted by, and the <lb/> spectacle of the marvelous child's
meteor-flight <lb/> across the war-firmament of France and its extinc- <lb/> tion in the
smoke-clouds of the stake receded deeper <lb/> and deeper into the past and grew ever more <lb/>
strange, and wonderful, and divine, and pathetic, I <lb/> came to comprehend and recognize her at
last for <lb/> what she was&#x2014;the most noble life that was ever <lb/> born into this world save
only One.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER I.</b></head>
<p><smcap>I, the</smcap> Sieur Louis de Conte, was born in Neuf- <lb/> ch&#x00E2;teau, the 6th of
January, 1410; that is to <lb/> say, exactly two years before Joan of Arc was born <lb/> in Domremy.
My family had fled to those distant <lb/> regions from the neighborhood of Paris in the first <lb/>
years of the century. In politics they were Armag- <lb/> nacs&#x2014;patriots; they were for our own
French <lb/> King, crazy and impotent as he was. The Burgun- <lb/> dian party, who were for the
English, had stripped <lb/> them, and done it well. They took everything but <lb/> my father's small
nobility, and when he reached <lb/> Neufch&#x00E2;teau he reached it in poverty and with a <lb/>
broken spirit. But the political atmosphere there <lb/> was the sort he liked, and that was
something. He <lb/> came to a region of comparative quiet; he left <lb/> behind him a region peopled
with furies, madmen, <lb/> devils, where slaughter was a daily pastime and no <lb/> man's life safe
for a moment. In Paris, mobs roared <lb/> through the streets nightly, sacking, burning, killing,
<lb/> unmolested, uninterrupted. The sun rose upon <lb/> wrecked and smoking buildings, and upon
mutilated <lb/> corpses lying here, there, and yonder about the <lb/>
<pb n="20"/> streets, just as they fell, and stripped naked by <lb/> thieves, the unholy gleaners
after the mob. None <lb/> had the courage to gather these dead for burial; <lb/> they were left
there to rot and create plagues.</p>
<p>And plagues they did create. Epidemics swept <lb/> away the people like flies, and the burials
were con- <lb/> ducted secretly and by night; for public funerals <lb/> were not allowed, lest the
revelation of the magni- <lb/> tude of the plague's work unman the people and <lb/> plunge them into
despair. Then came, finally, the <lb/> bitterest winter which had visited France in five <lb/>
hundred years. Famine, pestilence, slaughter, ice, <lb/> snow&#x2014;Paris had all these at once.
The dead lay <lb/> in heaps about the streets, and <i>wolves entered the <lb/> city in daylight and
devoured them.</i></p>
<p>Ah, France had fallen low&#x2014;so low! For more <lb/> than three quarters of a century the
English fangs <lb/> had been bedded in her flesh, and so cowed had her <lb/> armies become by
ceaseless rout and defeat that it <lb/> was said and accepted that the mere sight of an <lb/>
English army was sufficient to put a French one to <lb/> flight.</p>
<p>When I was five years old the prodigious disaster <lb/> of Agincourt fell upon France; and
although the <lb/> English King went home to enjoy his glory, he left <lb/> the country prostrate
and a prey to roving bands of <lb/> Free Companions in the service of the Burgundian <lb/> party,
and one of these bands came raiding through <lb/> Neufch&#x00E2;teau one night, and by the light of
our <lb/> burning roof-thatch I saw all that were dear to me <lb/>
<pb n="21"/> in this world (save an elder brother, your ancestor, <lb/> left behind with the court)
butchered while they <lb/> begged for mercy, and heard the butchers laugh at <lb/> their prayers and
mimic their pleadings. I was <lb/> overlooked, and escaped without hurt. When the <lb/> savages were
gone I crept out and cried the night <lb/> away watching the burning houses; and I was all <lb/>
alone, except for the company of the dead and the <lb/> wounded, for the rest had taken flight and
hidden <lb/> themselves.</p>
<p>I was sent to Domremy, to the priest, whose <lb/> housekeeper became a loving mother to me. The
<lb/> priest, in the course of time, taught me to read and <lb/> write, and he and I were the only
persons in the <lb/> village who possessed this learning.</p>
<p>At the time that the house of this good priest, <lb/> Guillaume Fronte, became my home, I was six
years <lb/> old. We lived close by the village church, and the <lb/> small garden of Joan's parents
was behind the <lb/> church. As to that family, there were Jacques <lb/> d'Arc the father, his wife
Isabel Rom&#x00E9;e; three <lb/> sons&#x2014;Jacques, ten years old, Pierre, eight, and <lb/> Jean,
seven; Joan, four, and her baby sister Cather- <lb/> ine, about a year old. I had these children for
<lb/> playmates from the beginning. I had some other <lb/> playmates besides&#x2014;particularly
four boys: Pierre <lb/> Morel, &#x00C9;tienne Roze, No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson, and Ed- <lb/> mond
Aubrey, whose father was maire at that time; <lb/> also two girls, about Joan's age, who by and by
<lb/> became her favorites; one was named Haumette, <lb/>
<pb n="22"/> the other was called Little Mengette. These girls <lb/> were common peasant children,
like Joan herself. <lb/> When they grew up, both married common laborers. <lb/> Their estate was
lowly enough, you see; yet a time <lb/> came, many years after, when no passing stranger, <lb/>
howsoever great he might be, failed to go and pay <lb/> his reverence to those two humble old women
who <lb/> had been honored in their youth by the friendship <lb/> of Joan of Arc.</p>
<p>These were all good children, just of the ordinary <lb/> peasant type; not bright, of
course&#x2014;you would <lb/> not expect that&#x2014;but good-hearted and companion- <lb/> able,
obedient to their parents and the priest; and <lb/> as they grew up they became properly stocked
with <lb/> narrownesses and prejudices got at second hand <lb/> from their elders, and adopted
without reserve; and <lb/> without examination also&#x2014;which goes without say- <lb/> ing. Their
religion was inherited, their politics the <lb/> same. John Huss and his sort might find fault with
<lb/> the Church, in Domremy it disturbed nobody's <lb/> faith; and when the split came, when I was
four- <lb/> teen, and we had three Popes at once, nobody in <lb/> Domremy was worried about how to
choose among <lb/> them&#x2014;the Pope of Rome was the right one, a <lb/> Pope outside of Rome was
no Pope at all. Every <lb/> human creature in the village was an Armagnac&#x2014;a <lb/>
patriot&#x2014;and if we children hotly hated nothing else <lb/> in the world, we did certainly hate
the English and <lb/> Burgundian name and polity in that way.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="II">
<pb n="23"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER II.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Our</smcap> Domremy was like any other humble little <lb/> hamlet of that remote time and
region. It <lb/> was a maze of crooked, narrow lanes and alleys <lb/> shaded and sheltered by the
overhanging thatch <lb/> roofs of the barn-like houses. The houses were <lb/> dimly lighted by
wooden-shuttered windows&#x2014;that <lb/> is, holes in the walls which served for windows. <lb/>
The floors were of dirt, and there was very little <lb/> furniture. Sheep and cattle grazing was the
main <lb/> industry; all the young folks tended flocks.</p>
<p>The situation was beautiful. From one edge of <lb/> the village a flowery plain extended in a
wide sweep <lb/> to the river&#x2014;the Meuse; from the rear edge of the <lb/> village a grassy
slope rose gradually, and at the top <lb/> was the great oak forest&#x2014;a forest that was deep
<lb/> and gloomy and dense, and full of interest for us <lb/> children, for many murders had been
done in it by <lb/> outlaws in old times, and in still earlier times <lb/> prodigious dragons that
spouted fire and poisonous <lb/> vapors from their nostrils had their homes in there. <lb/> In fact,
one was still living in there in our own time. <lb/> It was as long as a tree, and had a body as big <lb/>
<pb n="24"/> around as a tierce, and scales like overlapping great <lb/> tiles, and deep ruby eyes
as large as a cavalier's hat, <lb/> and an anchor-fluke on its tail as big as I don't <lb/> know
what, but very big, even unusually so for a <lb/> dragon, as everybody said who knew about dragons.
<lb/> It was thought that this dragon was of a brilliant <lb/> blue color, with gold mottlings, but
no one had ever <lb/> seen it, therefore this was not known to be so, it was <lb/> only an opinion.
It was not my opinion; I think <lb/> there is no sense in forming an opinion when there <lb/> is no
evidence to form it on. If you build a person <lb/> without any bones in him he may look fair enough
<lb/> to the eye, but he will be limber and cannot stand <lb/> up; and I consider that
<i>evidence</i> is the bones of an <lb/> opinion. But I will take up this matter more at <lb/> large
at another time, and try to make the justness <lb/> of my position appear. As to that dragon, I
always <lb/> held the belief that its color was gold and without <lb/> blue, for that has always
been the color of dragons. <lb/> That this dragon lay but a little way within the wood <lb/> at one
time is shown by the fact that Pierre Morel <lb/> was in there one day and smelt it, and recognized
it <lb/> by the smell. It gives one a horrid idea of how <lb/> near to us the deadliest danger can
be and we not <lb/> suspect it.</p>
<p>In the earliest times a hundred knights from many <lb/> remote places in the earth would have
gone in there <lb/> one after another, to kill the dragon and get the <lb/> reward, but in our time
that method had gone out, <lb/> and the priest had become the one that abolished <lb/>
<pb n="25"/> dragons. P&#x00E8;re Guillaume Fronte did it in this case. <lb/> He had a procession,
with candles and incense and <lb/> banners, and marched around the edge of the wood <lb/> and
exorcised the dragon, and it was never heard of <lb/> again, although it was the opinion of many
that the <lb/> smell never wholly passed away. Not that any had <lb/> ever smelt the smell again,
for none had; it was <lb/> only an opinion, like that other&#x2014;and lacked bones, <lb/> you see.
I know that the creature was there before <lb/> the exorcism, but whether it was there afterward or
<lb/> not is a thing which I cannot be so positive about.</p>
<p>In a noble open space carpeted with grass on the <lb/> high ground toward Vaucouleurs stood a
most <lb/> majestic beech-tree with wide-reaching arms and a <lb/> grand spread of shade, and by it
a limpid spring of <lb/> cold water; and on summer days the children went <lb/> there&#x2014;oh,
every summer for more than five hun- <lb/> dred years&#x2014;went there and sang and danced around
<lb/> the tree for hours together, refreshing themselves at <lb/> the spring from time to time, and
it was most lovely <lb/> and enjoyable. Also they made wreaths of flowers <lb/> and hung them upon
the tree and about the spring <lb/> to please the fairies that lived there; for they liked <lb/>
that, being idle innocent little creatures, as all fairies <lb/> are, and fond of anything delicate
and pretty like <lb/> wild flowers put together in that way. And in re- <lb/> turn for this
attention the fairies did any friendly <lb/> thing they could for the children, such as keeping
<lb/> the spring always full and clear and cold, and <lb/> driving away serpents and insects that
sting; and so <lb/>
<pb n="26"/> there was never any unkindness between the fairies <lb/> and the children during more
than five hundred <lb/> years&#x2014;tradition said a thousand&#x2014;but only the <lb/> warmest
affection and the most perfect trust and <lb/> confidence; and whenever a child died the fairies
<lb/> mourned just as that child's playmates did, and the <lb/> sign of it was there to see; for
before the dawn on <lb/> the day of the funeral they hung a little immortelle <lb/> over the place
where that child was used to sit under <lb/> the tree. I know this to be true by my own eyes; <lb/>
it is not hearsay. And the reason it was known <lb/> that the fairies did it was this&#x2014;that it
was made all <lb/> of black flowers of a sort not known in France any- <lb/> where.</p>
<p>Now from time immemorial all children reared in <lb/> Domremy were called the Children of the
Tree; and <lb/> they loved that name, for it carried with it a mystic <lb/> privilege not granted to
any others of the children <lb/> of this world. Which was this: whenever one of <lb/> these came to
die, then beyond the vague and form- <lb/> less images drifting through his darkening mind rose
<lb/> soft and rich and fair a vision of the Tree&#x2014;if all <lb/> was well with his soul. That
was what some said. <lb/> Others said the vision came in two ways: once as a <lb/> warning, one or
two years in advance of death, <lb/> when the soul was the captive of sin, and then the <lb/> Tree
appeared in its desolate winter aspect&#x2014;then <lb/> that soul was smitten with an awful fear.
If repent- <lb/> ance came, and purity of life, the vision came again, <lb/> this time summer-clad
and beautiful; but if it were <lb/>
<pb n="27"/> otherwise with that soul the vision was withheld, <lb/> and it passed from life knowing
its doom. Still <lb/> others said that the vision came but once, and then <lb/> only to the sinless
dying forlorn in distant lands and <lb/> pitifully longing for some last dear reminder of their
<lb/> home. And what reminder of it could go to their <lb/> hearts like the picture of the Tree that
was the dar- <lb/> ling of their love and the comrade of their joys and <lb/> comforter of their
small griefs all through the divine <lb/> days of their vanished youth?</p>
<p>Now the several traditions were as I have said, <lb/> some believing one and some another. One of
them <lb/> I knew to be the truth, and that was the last one. I <lb/> do not say anything against
the others; I think they <lb/> were true, but I only <i>know</i> that the last one was; <lb/> and it
is my thought that if one keep to the things <lb/> he knows, and not trouble about the things which
<lb/> he cannot be sure about, he will have the steadier <lb/> mind for it&#x2014;and there is
profit in that. I know <lb/> that when the Children of the Tree die in a far land, <lb/>
then&#x2014;if they be at peace with God&#x2014;they turn <lb/> their longing eyes toward home, and
there, far- <lb/> shining, as through a rift in a cloud that curtains <lb/> heaven, they see the
soft picture of the Fairy Tree, <lb/> clothed in a dream of golden light; and they see the <lb/>
bloomy mead sloping away to the river, and to their <lb/> perishing nostrils is blown faint and
sweet the <lb/> fragrance of the flowers of home. And then the <lb/> vision fades and
passes&#x2014;but <i>they</i> know, <i>they</i> know! <lb/> and by their transfigured faces you know
also, you <lb/>
<pb n="28"/> who stand looking on; yes, you know the message <lb/> that has come, and that it has
come from heaven.</p>
<p>Joan and I believed alike about this matter. But <lb/> Pierre Morel, and Jacques d'Arc, and many
others <lb/> believed that the vision appeared twice&#x2014;to a sinner. <lb/> In fact, they and
many others said they <i>knew</i> it. <lb/> Probably because their fathers had known it and had
<lb/> told them; for one gets most things at second-hand <lb/> in this world.</p>
<p>Now one thing that does make it quite likely that <lb/> there were really two apparitions of the
Tree is this <lb/> fact: From the most ancient times if one saw a vil- <lb/> lager of ours with his
face ash-white and rigid with a <lb/> ghastly fright, it was common for every one to <lb/> whisper
to his neighbor, "Ah, he is in sin, and has <lb/> got his warning." And the neighbor would shudder
<lb/> at the thought and whisper back, "Yes, poor soul, <lb/> he has seen the Tree."</p>
<p>Such evidences as these have their weight; they <lb/> are not to be put aside with a wave of the
hand. A <lb/> thing that is backed by the cumulative experience of <lb/> centuries naturally gets
nearer and nearer to being <lb/> proof all the time; and if this continue and con- <lb/> tinue, it
will some day become authority&#x2014;and <lb/> authority is a bedded rock, and will abide.</p>
<p>In my long life I have seen several cases where <lb/> the Tree appeared announcing a death which
was <lb/> still far away; but in none of these was the person <lb/> in a state of sin. No; the
apparition was in these <lb/> cases only a special grace; in place of deferring the <lb/>
<pb n="29"/> tidings of that soul's redemption till the day of <lb/> death, the apparition brought
them long before, and <lb/> with them peace&#x2014;peace that might no more be <lb/>
disturbed&#x2014;the eternal peace of God. I myself, <lb/> old and broken, wait with serenity; for I
have seen <lb/> the vision of the Tree. I have seen it, and am <lb/> content.</p>
<p>Always, from the remotest times, when the chil- <lb/> dren joined hands and danced around the
Fairy Tree <lb/> they sang a song which was the Tree's song, the <lb/> song of <foreign lang="fre"
><i>L'Arbre F&#x00E9;e de Bourlemont</i>.</foreign> They sang it <lb/> to a quaint sweet
air&#x2014;a solacing sweet air which <lb/> has gone murmuring through my dreaming spirit all <lb/>
my life when I was weary and troubled, resting me <lb/> and carrying me through night and distance
home <lb/> again. No stranger can know or feel what that song <lb/> has been, through the drifting
centuries, to exiled <lb/> Children of the Tree, homeless and heavy of heart <lb/> in countries
foreign to their speech and ways. You <lb/> will think it a simple thing, that song, and poor, <lb/>
perchance; but if you will remember what it was to <lb/> us, and what it brought before our eyes
when it <lb/> floated through our memories, then you will respect <lb/> it. And you will understand
how the water wells <lb/> up in our eyes and makes all things dim, and our <lb/> voices break and we
cannot sing the last lines: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"And when, in exile wand'ring, we</l>
<l>Shall fainting yearn for glimpse of thee,</l>
<l rend="indent">Oh, rise upon our sight!"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>And you will remember that Joan of Arc sang this <lb/>
<pb n="30"/> song with us around the Tree when she was a little <lb/> child, and always loved it.
And that hallows it, <lb/> yes, you will grant that:</p>

<p>The fairies were still there when we were children, <lb/> but we never saw them; because, a
hundred years <lb/> before that, the priest of Domremy had held a <lb/> religious function under the
tree and denounced <lb/> them as being blood kin of the Fiend and barred <lb/> out from redemption;
and then he warned them <lb/> never to show themselves again, nor hang any more <lb/>
<pb n="31"/> immortelles, on pain of perpetual banishment from <lb/> that parish.</p>
<p>All the children pleaded for the fairies, and said <lb/> they were their good friends and dear to
them and <lb/> never did them any harm, but the priest would not <lb/> listen, and said it was sin
and shame to have such <lb/> friends. The children mourned and could not be <lb/> comforted; and
they made an agreement among <lb/> themselves that they would always continue to hang <lb/>
flower-wreaths on the tree as a perpetual sign to the <lb/> fairies that they were still loved and
remembered, <lb/> though lost to sight.</p>
<p>But late one night a great misfortune befell. <lb/> Edmond Aubrey's mother passed by the Tree,
and <lb/> the fairies were stealing a dance, not thinking any- <lb/> body was by; and they were so
busy, and so intoxi- <lb/> cated with the wild happiness of it, and with the <lb/> bumpers of dew
sharpened up with honey which <lb/> they had been drinking, that they noticed nothing; <lb/> so Dame
Aubrey stood there astonished and admir- <lb/> ing, and saw the little fantastic atoms holding
hands, <lb/> as many as three hundred of them, tearing around <lb/> in a great ring half as big as
an ordinary bedroom, <lb/> and leaning away back and spreading their mouths <lb/> with laughter and
song, which she could hear quite <lb/> distinctly, and kicking their legs up as much as three <lb/>
inches from the ground in perfect abandon and <lb/> hilarity&#x2014;oh, the very maddest and
witchingest <lb/> dance the woman ever saw.</p>
<p>But in about a minute or two minutes the poor <lb/>
<pb n="32"/> little ruined creatures discovered her. They burst <lb/> out in one heart-breaking
squeak of grief and terror <lb/> and fled every which way, with their wee hazel-nut <lb/> fists in
their eyes and crying; and so disappeared.</p>
<p>The heartless woman&#x2014;no, the foolish woman; <lb/> she was not heartless, but only
thoughtless&#x2014;went <lb/> straight home and told the neighbors all about it, <lb/> whilst we,
the small friends of the fairies, were asleep <lb/> and not witting the calamity that was come upon
us, <lb/> and all unconscious that we ought to be up and <lb/> trying to stop these fatal tongues.
In the morning <lb/> everybody knew, and the disaster was complete, for <lb/> where everybody knows
a thing the priest knows it, <lb/> of course. We all flocked to P&#x00E8;re Fronte, crying <lb/> and
begging&#x2014;and he had to cry, too, seeing our <lb/> sorrow, for he had a most kind and gentle
nature; <lb/> and he did not want to banish the fairies, and said <lb/> so; but said he had no
choice, for it had been <lb/> decreed that if they ever revealed themselves to man <lb/> again, they
must go. This all happened at the worst <lb/> time possible, for Joan of Arc was ill of a fever and
<lb/> out of her head, and what could we do who had not <lb/> her gifts of reasoning and persuasion?
We flew in <lb/> a swarm to her bed and cried out, "Joan, wake! <lb/> Wake, there is no moment to
lose! Come and <lb/> plead for the fairies&#x2014;come and save them; only <lb/> you can do it."</p>
<p>But her mind was wandering, she did not know <lb/> what we said nor what we meant; so we went
<lb/> away knowing all was lost. Yes, all was lost, forever <lb/>
<pb n="33"/> lost; the faithful friends of the children for five <lb/> hundred years must go, and
never come back any <lb/> more.</p>
<p>It was a bitter day for us, that day that P&#x00E8;re <lb/> Fronte held the function under the
tree and ban- <lb/> ished the fairies. We could not wear mourning that <lb/> any could have noticed,
it would not have been <lb/> allowed; so we had to be content with some poor <lb/> small rag of
black tied upon our garments where it <lb/> made no show; but in our hearts we wore mourning, <lb/>
big and noble and occupying all the room, for our <lb/>
<i>hearts</i> were ours; they could not get at them to <lb/> prevent that.</p>
<p>The great tree&#x2014;<foreign lang="fre"><i>l'Arbre F&#x00E9;e de Bourlemont</i></foreign> was
<lb/> its beautiful name&#x2014;was never afterward quite as <lb/> much to us as it had been before,
but it was always <lb/> dear; is dear to me yet when I go there now, once <lb/> a year in my old
age, to sit under it and bring back <lb/> the lost playmates of my youth and group them <lb/> about
me and look upon their faces through my <lb/> tears and break my heart, oh, my God! No, the <lb/>
place was not quite the same afterward. In one or <lb/> two ways it could not be; for, the fairies'
protection <lb/> being gone, the spring lost much of its freshness and <lb/> coldness, and more than
two-thirds of its volume, <lb/> and the banished serpents and stinging insects re- <lb/> turned, and
multiplied, and became a torment and <lb/> have remained so to this day.</p>
<p>When that wise little child, Joan, got well, we <lb/> realized how much her illness had cost us;
for we <lb/>
<pb n="34"/> found that we had been right in believing she could <lb/> save the fairies. She burst
into a great storm of <lb/> anger, for so little a creature, and went straight to <lb/> P&#x00E8;re
Fronte, and stood up before him where he sat, <lb/> and made reverence and said:</p>
<p>"The fairies were to go if they showed themselves <lb/> to people again, is it not so?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that was it, dear."</p>
<p>"If a man comes prying into a person's room at <lb/> midnight when that person is half naked,
will you <lb/> be so unjust as to say that that person is showing <lb/> himself to that man?"</p>
<p>"Well&#x2014;no." The good priest looked a little <lb/> troubled and uneasy when he said it.</p>
<p>"Is a sin a sin, anyway, even if one did not in- <lb/> tend to commit it?"</p>
<p>P&#x00E8;re Fronte threw up his hands and cried out:</p>
<p>"Oh, my poor little child, I see all my fault," <lb/> and he drew her to his side and put his arm
around <lb/> her and tried to make his peace with her, but her <lb/> temper was up so high that she
could not get it <lb/> down right away, but buried her head against his <lb/> breast and broke out
crying and said:</p>
<p>"Then the fairies committed no sin, for there <lb/> was no intention to commit one, they not
knowing <lb/> that any one was by; and because they were little <lb/> creatures and could not speak
for themselves and <lb/> say the law was against the intention, not against <lb/> the innocent act,
and because they had no friend to <lb/> think that simple thing for them and say it, they <lb/>
<pb n="35"/> have been sent away from their home forever, and <lb/> it was wrong, <i>wrong</i> to do
it!"</p>
<p>The good father hugged her yet closer to his side <lb/> and said:</p>
<p>"Oh, out of the mouths of babes and sucklings <lb/> the heedless and unthinking are condemned;
would <lb/> God I could bring the little creatures back, for your <lb/> sake. And mine, yes, and
mine; for I have been <lb/> unjust. There, there, don't cry&#x2014;nobody could be <lb/> sorrier
than your poor old friend&#x2014;don't cry, dear."</p>
<p>"But I can't stop right away, I've <i>got</i> to. And <lb/> it is no little matter, this thing
that you have done. <lb/> Is being sorry penance enough for such an act?"</p>
<p>P&#x00E8;re Fronte turned away his face, for it would <lb/> have hurt her to see him laugh, and
said:</p>
<p>"Oh, thou remorseless but most just accuser, no, <lb/> it is not. I will put on sackcloth and
ashes; there <lb/> &#x2014;are you satisfied?"</p>
<p>Joan's sobs began to diminish, and she presently <lb/> looked up at the old man through her
tears, and <lb/> said, in her simple way:</p>
<p>"Yes, that will do&#x2014;if it will clear you."</p>
<p>P&#x00E8;re Fronte would have been moved to laugh <lb/> again, perhaps, if he had not remembered
in time <lb/> that he had made a contract, and not a very agree- <lb/> able one. It must be
fulfilled. So he got up and <lb/> went to the fireplace, Joan watching him with deep <lb/> interest,
and took a shovelful of cold ashes, and was <lb/> going to empty them on his old gray head when a
<lb/> better idea came to him, and he said:</p>
<pb n="36"/>
<p>"Would you mind helping me, dear?"</p>
<p>"How, father?"</p>
<p>He got down on his knees and bent his head low, <lb/> and said:</p>
<p>"Take the ashes and put them on my head for <lb/> me."</p>
<p>The matter ended there, of course. The victory <lb/> was with the priest. One can imagine how the
idea <lb/> of such a profanation would strike Joan or any other <lb/> child in the village. She ran
and dropped upon her <lb/> knees by his side and said:</p>
<p>"Oh, it is dreadful. I didn't know that that was <lb/> what one meant by sackcloth and
ashes&#x2014;do please <lb/> get up, father."</p>
<p>"But I can't until I am forgiven. Do you for- <lb/> give me?"</p>
<p>"I? Oh, you have done nothing to me, father; <lb/> it is <i>yourself</i> that must forgive
yourself for wronging <lb/> those poor things. Please get up, father, won't <lb/> you?"</p>
<p>"But I am worse off now than I was before. I <lb/> thought I was earning <i>your</i> forgiveness,
but if it is <lb/> my own, I can't be lenient; it would not become <lb/> me. Now what can I do? Find
me some way out <lb/> of this with your wise little head."</p>
<p>The P&#x00E8;re would not stir, for all Joan's pleadings. <lb/> She was about to cry again; then
she had an idea, <lb/> and seized the shovel and deluged her own head <lb/> with the ashes,
stammering out through her chokings <lb/> and suffocations:</p>
<pb n="37"/>
<p>"There&#x2014;now it is done. Oh, please get up, <lb/> father."</p>
<p>The old man, both touched and amused, gathered <lb/> her to his breast and said:</p>
<p>"Oh, you incomparable child! It's a humble <lb/> martyrdom, and not of a sort presentable in a
pic- <lb/> ture, but the right and true spirit is in it; that I <lb/> testify."</p>
<p>Then he brushed the ashes out of her hair, and <lb/> helped her scour her face and neck and
properly <lb/> tidy herself up. He was in fine spirits now, and <lb/> ready for further argument, so
he took his seat and <lb/> drew Joan to his side again, and said:</p>
<p>"Joan, you were used to make wreaths there at <lb/> the Fairy Tree with the other children; is it
not so?"</p>
<p>That was the way he always started out when he <lb/> was going to corner me up and catch me in
some- <lb/> thing&#x2014;just that gentle, indifferent way that fools a <lb/> person so, and leads
him into the trap, he never <lb/> noticing which way he is traveling until he is in and <lb/> the
door shut on him. He enjoyed that. I knew <lb/> he was going to drop corn along in front of Joan
<lb/> now. Joan answered:</p>
<p>"Yes, father."</p>
<p>"Did you hang them on the tree?"</p>
<p>"No, father."</p>
<p>"Didn't hang them there?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you?"</p>
<p>"I&#x2014;well, I didn't wish to."</p>
<pb n="38"/>
<p>"Didn't wish to?"</p>
<p>"No, father."</p>
<p>"What did you do with them?"</p>
<p>"I hung them in the church."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you want to hang them in the tree?"</p>
<p>"Because it was said that the fairies were of kin <lb/> to the Fiend, and that it was sinful to
show them <lb/> honor."</p>
<p>"Did you believe it was wrong to honor them <lb/> so?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I thought it must be wrong."</p>
<p>"Then if it was wrong to honor them in that <lb/> way, and if they were of kin to the Fiend, they
<lb/> could be dangerous company for you and the other <lb/> children, couldn't they?"</p>
<p>"I suppose so&#x2014;yes, I think so."</p>
<p>He studied a minute, and I judged he was going <lb/> to spring his trap, and he did. He said:</p>
<p>"Then the matter stands like this. They were <lb/> banned creatures, of fearful origin; they
could be <lb/> dangerous company for the children. Now give me <lb/> a rational reason, dear, if you
can think of any, <lb/> why you call it a wrong to drive them into banish- <lb/> ment, and why you
would have saved them from it. <lb/> In a word, what loss have you suffered by it?"</p>
<p>How stupid of him to go and throw his case away <lb/> like that! I could have boxed his ears for
vexation <lb/> if he had been a boy. He was going along all right <lb/> until he ruined everything
by winding up in that <lb/> foolish and fatal way. What had <i>she</i> lost by it! <lb/>
<pb n="39"/> Was he never going to find out what kind of a child <lb/> Joan of Arc was? Was he never
going to learn that <lb/> things which merely concerned her own gain or loss <lb/> she cared nothing
about? Could he never get the <lb/> simple fact into his head that the sure way and the <lb/> only
way to rouse her up and set her on fire was to <lb/> show her where some <i>other</i> person was
going to <lb/> suffer wrong or hurt or loss? Why, he had gone <lb/> and set a trap for
himself&#x2014;that was all he had ac- <lb/> complished.</p>
<p>The minute those words were out of his mouth <lb/> her temper was up, the indignant tears rose in
her <lb/> eyes, and she burst out on him with an energy and <lb/> passion which astonished him, but
didn't astonish <lb/> me, for I knew he had fired a mine when he touched <lb/> off his ill-chosen
climax.</p>
<p>"Oh, father, how can you talk like that? Who <lb/> owns France?"</p>
<p>"God and the King."</p>
<p>"Not Satan?"</p>
<p>"Satan, my child? This is the footstool of the <lb/> Most High&#x2014;Satan owns no handful of
its soil."</p>
<p>"Then who gave those poor creatures their <lb/> home? God. Who protected them in it all those
<lb/> centuries? God. Who allowed them to dance and <lb/> play there all those centuries and found
no fault <lb/> with it? God. Who disapproved of God's ap- <lb/> proval and put a threat upon them? A
man. Who <lb/> caught them again in harmless sports that God <lb/> allowed and a man forbade, and
carried out that <lb/>
<pb n="40"/> threat, and drove the poor things away from the <lb/> home the good God gave them in
His mercy and <lb/> His pity, and sent down His rain and dew and <lb/> sunshine upon it five hundred
years in token of His <lb/> peace? It was <i>their</i> home&#x2014;theirs, by the grace of <lb/> God
and His good heart, and no man had a right to <lb/> rob them of it. And they were the gentlest,
truest <lb/> friends chat children ever had, and did them sweet <lb/> and loving service all these
five long centuries, and <lb/> never any hurt or harm; and the children loved <lb/> them, and now
they mourn for them, and there is <lb/> no healing for their grief. And what had the chil- <lb/>
dren done that they should suffer this cruel stroke? <lb/> The poor fairies <i>could</i> have been
dangerous com- <lb/> pany for the children? Yes, but never had been; <lb/> and <i>could</i> is no
argument. Kinsmen of the Fiend? <lb/> What of it? Kinsmen of the Fiend have <i>rights</i>, and <lb/>
these had; and children have rights, and these had; <lb/> and if I had been here I would have
spoken&#x2014;I <lb/> would have begged for the children and the fiends, <lb/> and stayed your hand
and saved them all. But <lb/> now&#x2014;oh, now, all is lost; everything is lost, and <lb/> there
is no help more!"</p>
<p>Then she finished with a blast at that idea that <lb/> fairy kinsmen of the Fiend ought to be
shunned and <lb/> denied human sympathy and friendship because <lb/> salvation was barred against
them. She said that <lb/> for that very <i>reason</i> people ought to pity them, and <lb/> do every
humane and loving thing they could to <lb/> make them forget the hard fate that had been put <lb/>
<pb n="41"/> upon them by accident of birth and no fault of their <lb/> own. "Poor little
creatures!" she said. "What <lb/> can a person's heart be made of that can pity a <lb/> Christian's
child and yet can't pity a devil's child, <lb/> that a thousand times more <i>needs</i> it!"</p>
<p>She had torn loose from P&#x00E8;re Fronte, and was <lb/> crying, with her knuckles in her eyes,
and stamping <lb/> her small feet in a fury; and now she burst out of <lb/> the place and was gone
before we could gather our <lb/> senses together out of this storm of words and this <lb/> whirlwind
of passion.</p>
<p>The P&#x00E8;re had got upon his feet, toward the last, <lb/> and now he stood there passing his
hand back and <lb/> forth across his forehead like a person who is dazed <lb/> and troubled; then he
turned and wandered toward <lb/> the door of his little work-room, and as he passed <lb/> through it
I heard him murmur sorrowfully:</p>
<p>"Ah, me, poor children, poor fiends, they <i>have</i>
<lb/> rights, and she said true&#x2014;I never thought of that. <lb/> God forgive me, I am to
blame."</p>
<p>When I heard that, I knew I was right in the <lb/> thought that he had set a trap for himself. It
was <lb/> so, and he had walked into it, you see. I seemed <lb/> to feel encouraged, and wondered if
mayhap I might <lb/> get him into one; but upon reflection my heart went <lb/> down, for this was
not my gift.</p>

<p><smcap>Speaking</smcap> of this matter reminds me of many <lb/> incidents, many things that I

to call back a little glimpse of the <lb/> simple and colorless good times we used to have in <lb/>
our village homes in those peaceful days&#x2014;especially <lb/> in the winter. In the summer we
children were out <lb/> on the breezy uplands with the flocks from dawn till <lb/> night, and then
there was noisy frolicking and all <lb/> that; but winter was the cosy time, winter was the <lb/>
snug time. Often we gathered in old Jacques <lb/> d'Arc's big dirt-floored apartment, with a great
fire <lb/> going, and played games, and sang songs, and told <lb/> fortunes, and listened to the old
villagers tell tales <lb/> and histories and lies and one thing and another till <lb/> twelve
o'clock at night.</p>
<p>One winter's night we were gathered there&#x2014;it <lb/> was the winter that for years afterward
they called <lb/> the hard winter&#x2014;and that particular night was a <lb/> sharp one. It blew a
gale outside, and the scream- <lb/> ing of the wind was a stirring sound, and I think I <lb/> may
say it was beautiful, for I think it <i>is</i> great and <lb/>
<pb n="43"/> fine and beautiful to hear the wind rage and storm <lb/> and blow its clarions like
that, when you are inside <lb/> and comfortable. And we were. We had a roar- <lb/> ing fire, and the
pleasant <i>spit-spit</i> of the snow and <lb/> sleet falling in it down the chimney, and the yarn-
<lb/> ing and laughing and singing went on at a noble <lb/> rate till about ten o'clock, and then we
had a supper <lb/> of hot porridge and beans, and meal cakes with <lb/> butter, and appetites to
match.</p>
<p>Little Joan sat on a box apart, and had her bowl <lb/> and bread on another one, and her pets
around her <lb/> helping. She had more than was usual of them or <lb/> economical, because all the
outcast cats came and <lb/> took up with her, and homeless or unlovable animals <lb/> of other kinds
heard about it and came, and these <lb/> spread the matter to the other creatures, and they <lb/>
came also; and as the birds and the other timid <lb/> wild things of the woods were not afraid of
her, but <lb/> always had an idea she was a friend when they came <lb/> across her, and generally
struck up an acquaintance <lb/> with her to get invited to the house, she always had <lb/> samples
of those breeds in stock. She was hospitable <lb/> to them all, for an animal was an animal to her,
and <lb/> dear by mere reason of being an animal, no matter <lb/> about its sort or social station;
and as she would <lb/> allow of no cages, no collars, no fetters, but left the <lb/> creatures free
to come and go as they liked, that <lb/> contented them, and they came; but they didn't go, <lb/> to
any extent, and so they were a marvelous <lb/> nuisance, and made Jacques d'Arc swear a good <lb/>
<pb n="44"/> deal; but his wife said God gave the child the in- <lb/> stinct, and knew what He was
doing when He did <lb/> it, therefore it must have its course; it would be no <lb/> sound prudence
to meddle with His affairs when no <lb/> invitation had been extended. So the pets were left <lb/>
in peace, and here they were, as I have said, rab- <lb/> bits, birds, squirrels, cats, and other
reptiles, all <lb/> around the child, and full of interest in her supper, <lb/> and helping what
they could. There was a very <lb/> small squirrel on her shoulder, sitting up, as those <lb/>
creatures do, and turning a rocky fragment of pre- <lb/> historic chestnut-cake over and over in its
knotty <lb/> hands, and hunting for the less indurated places, <lb/> and giving its elevated bushy
tail a flirt and its <lb/> pointed ears a toss when it found one&#x2014;signifying <lb/>
thankfulness and surprise&#x2014;and then it filed that <lb/> place off with those two slender front
teeth which a <lb/> squirrel carries for that purpose and not for orna- <lb/> ment, for ornamental
they never could be, as any <lb/> will admit that have noticed them.</p>
<p>Everything was going fine and breezy and hilari- <lb/> ous, but then there came an interruption,
for some- <lb/> body hammered on the door. It was one of those <lb/> ragged
road-stragglers&#x2014;the eternal wars kept the <lb/> country full of them. He came in, all over
snow, <lb/> and stamped his feet, and shook, and brushed him- <lb/> self, and shut the door, and
took off his limp ruin <lb/> of a hat, and slapped it once or twice against his leg <lb/> to knock
off its fleece of snow, and then glanced <lb/> around on the company with a pleased look upon <lb/>
<pb n="45"/> his thin face, and a most yearning and famished one <lb/> in his eye when it fell upon
the victuals, and then <lb/> he gave us a humble and conciliatory salutation, and <lb/> said it was
a blessed thing to have a fire like that on <lb/> such a night, and a roof overhead like this, and
that <lb/> rich food to eat, and loving friends to talk with&#x2014; <lb/> ah, yes, this was true,
and God help the homeless, <lb/> and such as must trudge the roads in this weather.</p>
<p>Nobody said anything. The embarrassed poor <lb/> creature stood there and appealed to one face
after <lb/> the other with his eyes, and found no welcome in <lb/> any, the smile on his own face
flickering and fading <lb/> and perishing, meanwhile; then he dropped his <lb/> gaze, the muscles of
his face began to twitch, and <lb/> he put up his hand to cover this womanish sign <lb/> of
weakness.</p>
<p>"Sit down!"</p>
<p>This thunder-blast was from old Jacques d'Arc, <lb/> and Joan was the object of it. The stranger
was <lb/> startled, and took his hand away, and there was <lb/> Joan standing before him offering
him her bowl of <lb/> porridge. The man said:</p>
<p>"God Almighty bless you, my darling!" and <lb/> then the tears came, and ran down his cheeks, but
<lb/> he was afraid to take the bowl.</p>
<p>"Do you hear me? Sit down, I say!"</p>
<p>There could not be a child more easy to persuade <lb/> than Joan, but this was not the way. Her
father <lb/> had not the art; neither could he learn it. Joan <lb/> said:</p>
<pb n="46"/>
<p>"Father, he is hungry; I can see it."</p>
<p>"Let him go work for food, then. We are being <lb/> eaten out of house and home by his like, and
I have <lb/> said I would endure it no more, and will keep my <lb/> word. He has the face of a
rascal anyhow, and a <lb/> villain. Sit <i>down</i>, I tell you!"</p>
<p>"I know not if he is a rascal or no, but he is <lb/> hungry, father, and shall have my
porridge&#x2014;I do <lb/> not need it."</p>
<p>"If you don't obey me I'll&#x2014; Rascals are not <lb/> entitled to help from honest people, and
no bite nor <lb/> sup shall they have in this house. <i>Joan!</i>"</p>
<p>She set her bowl down on the box and came over <lb/> and stood before her scowling father, and
said:</p>
<p>"Father, if you will not let me, then it must be <lb/> as you say; but I would that you would
think&#x2014; <lb/> then you would see that it is not right to punish one <lb/> part of him for what
the other part has done; for it <lb/> is that poor stranger's head that does the evil <lb/> things,
but it is not his head that is hungry, it is <lb/> his stomach, and it has done no harm to anybody,
<lb/> but is without blame, and innocent, not having any <lb/>
<i>way</i> to do a wrong, even if it was minded to it. <lb/> Please let&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"What an idea! It is the most idiotic speech I <lb/> ever heard."</p>
<p>But Aubrey, the maire, broke in, he being fond <lb/> of an argument, and having a pretty gift in
that re- <lb/> gard, as all acknowledged. Rising in his place and <lb/> leaning his knuckles upon
the table and looking <lb/>
<pb n="47"/> about him with easy dignity, after the manner of <lb/> such as be orators, he began,
smooth and persuasive:</p>
<p>"I will differ with you there, gossip, and will <lb/> undertake to show the company"&#x2014;here
he looked <lb/> around upon us and nodded his head in a confident <lb/> way&#x2014;"that there is a
grain of sense in what the <lb/> child has said; for look you, it is of a certainty <lb/> most true
and demonstrable that it is a man's head <lb/> that is master and supreme ruler over his whole <lb/>
body. Is that granted? Will any deny it?" He <lb/> glanced around again; everybody indicated assent.
<lb/> "Very well, then; that being the case, no part of <lb/> the body is responsible for the result
when it carries <lb/> out an order delivered to it by the head; ergo, the <lb/> head is alone
responsible for crimes done by a man's <lb/> hands or feet or stomach&#x2014;do you get the idea?
<lb/> am I right thus far?" Everybody said yes, and said <lb/> it with enthusiasm, and some said,
one to another, <lb/> that the maire was in great form to-night and at his <lb/> very
best&#x2014;which pleased the maire exceedingly and <lb/> made his eyes sparkle with pleasure, for
he over- <lb/> heard these things; so he went on in the same fertile <lb/> and brilliant way. "Now,
then, we will consider <lb/> what the term responsibility means, and how it <lb/> affects the case
in point. Responsibility makes a <lb/> man responsible for only those things for which he <lb/> is
properly responsible"&#x2014;and he waved his spoon <lb/> around in a wide sweep to indicate the
comprehen- <lb/> sive nature of that class of responsibilities which <lb/> render people
responsible, and several exclaimed, <lb/>
<pb n="48"/> admiringly, "He is right!&#x2014;he has put that whole <lb/> tangled thing into a
nutshell&#x2014;it is wonderful!" <lb/> After a little pause to give the interest opportunity <lb/>
to gather and grow, he went on: "Very good. Let <lb/> us suppose the case of a pair of tongs that
falls <lb/> upon a man's foot, causing a cruel hurt. Will you <lb/> claim that the tongs are
punishable for that? The <lb/> question is answered; I see by your faces that you <lb/> would call
such a claim absurd. Now, why is it <lb/> absurd? It is absurd because, there being no <lb/>
reasoning faculty&#x2014;that is to say, no faculty of <lb/> personal command&#x2014;in a pair of
tongs, personal <lb/> responsibility for the acts of the tongs is wholly ab- <lb/> sent from the
tongs; and, therefore, responsibility <lb/> being absent, punishment cannot ensue. Am I <lb/>
right?" A hearty burst of applause was his answer. <lb/> "Now, then, we arrive at a man's stomach.
Con- <lb/> sider how exactly, how marvelously, indeed, its <lb/> situation corresponds to that of a
pair of tongs. <lb/> Listen&#x2014;and take careful note, I beg you. Can a <lb/> man's stomach plan
a murder? No. Can it plan a <lb/> theft? No. Can it plan an incendiary fire? No. <lb/> Now answer
me&#x2014;<i>can a pair of tongs?</i>" (There <lb/> were admiring shouts of "No!" and "The cases
<lb/> are just exact!" and "Don't he do it splendid!") <lb/> "Now, then, friends and neighbors, a
stomach <lb/> which cannot plan a crime cannot be a principal in <lb/> the commission of
it&#x2014;that is plain, as you see. <lb/> The matter is narrowed down by that much; we will <lb/>
narrow it further. Can a stomach, of its own mo- <lb/>
<pb n="49"/> tion, assist at a crime? The answer is no, because <lb/> command is absent, the
reasoning faculty is absent, <lb/> volition is absent&#x2014;as in the case of the tongs. We <lb/>
perceive now, do we not, that the stomach is totally <lb/> irresponsible for crimes committed,
either in whole <lb/> or in part, by it?" He got a rousing cheer for re- <lb/> sponse. "Then what do
we arrive at as our verdict? <lb/> Clearly this: that there is no such thing in this <lb/> world as
a guilty stomach; that in the body of the <lb/> veriest rascal resides a pure and innocent stomach;
<lb/> that, whatever its owner may do, <i>it</i> at least should <lb/> be sacred in our eyes; and
that while God gives us <lb/> minds to think just and charitable and honorable <lb/> thoughts, it
should be, and <i>is</i>, our privilege, as well <lb/> as our duty, not only to feed the hungry
stomach <lb/> that resides in a rascal, having pity for its sorrow <lb/> and its need, but to do it
gladly, gratefully, in <lb/> recognition of its sturdy and loyal maintenance of <lb/> its purity and
innocence in the midst of temptation <lb/> and in company so repugnant to its better feelings. <lb/>
I am done."</p>
<p>Well, you never saw such an effect! They rose <lb/> &#x2014;the whole house rose&#x2014;and
clapped, and cheered, <lb/> and praised him to the skies; and one after another, <lb/> still
clapping and shouting, they crowded forward, <lb/> some with moisture in their eyes, and wrung his
<lb/> hands, and said such glorious things to him that he <lb/> was clear overcome with pride and
happiness, and <lb/> couldn't say a word, for his voice would have <lb/> broken, sure. It was
splendid to see; and every- <lb/>
<pb n="50"/> body said he had never come up to that speech in <lb/> his life before, and never could
do it again. Elo- <lb/> quence <i>is</i> a power, there is no question of that. <lb/> Even old
Jacques d'Arc was carried away, for once <lb/> in his life, and shouted out:</p>
<p>"It's all right, Joan&#x2014;give him the porridge!"</p>
<p>She was embarrassed, and did not seem to know <lb/> what to say, and so didn't say anything. It
was <lb/> because she had given the man the porridge long <lb/> ago, and he had already eaten it all
up. When she <lb/> was asked why she had not waited until a decision <lb/> was arrived at, she said
the man's stomach was very <lb/> hungry, and it would not have been wise to wait, <lb/> since she
could not tell what the decision would be. <lb/> Now that was a good and thoughtful idea for a
child.</p>
<p>The man was not a rascal at all. He was a very <lb/> good fellow, only he was out of luck, and
surely <lb/> that was no crime at that time in France. Now that <lb/> his stomach was proved to be
innocent, it was <lb/> allowed to make itself at home; and as soon as it <lb/> was well filled and
needed nothing more, the man <lb/> unwound his tongue and turned it loose, and it was <lb/> really a
noble one to go. He had been in the wars <lb/> for years, and the things he told and the way he
<lb/> told them fired everybody's patriotism away up <lb/> high, and set all hearts to thumping and
all pulses <lb/> to leaping; then, before anybody rightly knew how <lb/> the change was made, he was
leading us a sublime <lb/> march through the ancient glories of France, and in <lb/> fancy we saw
the titanic forms of the twelve paladins <lb/>
<pb n="51"/> rise out of the mists of the past and face their fate; <lb/> we heard the tread of the
innumerable hosts sweep- <lb/> ing down to shut them in; we saw this human tide <lb/> flow and ebb,
ebb and flow, and waste away before <lb/> that little band of heroes; we saw each detail pass <lb/>
before us of that most stupendous, most disastrous, <lb/> yet most adored and glorious day in French
legend- <lb/> ary history; here and there and yonder, across that <lb/> vast field of the dead and
dying, we saw this and <lb/> that and the other paladin dealing his prodigious <lb/> blows with
weary arm and failing strength, and one <lb/> by one we saw them fall, till only one
remained&#x2014; <lb/> he that was without peer, he whose name gives name <lb/> to the Song of
Songs, the song which no Frenchman <lb/> can hear and keep his feelings down and his pride of <lb/>
country cool; then, grandest and pitifulest scene <lb/> of all, we saw his own pathetic death; and
our still- <lb/> ness, as we sat with parted lips and breathless, hang- <lb/> ing upon this man's
words, gave us a sense of the <lb/> awful stillness that reigned in that field of slaughter <lb/>
when that last surviving soul had passed.</p>
<p>And now, in this solemn hush, the stranger gave <lb/> Joan a pat or two on the head and said:</p>
<p>"Little maid&#x2014;whom God keep!&#x2014;you have <lb/> brought me from death to life this
night; now <lb/> listen: here is your reward," and at that supreme <lb/> time for such a
heart-melting, soul-rousing surprise, <lb/> without another word he lifted up the most noble <lb/>
and pathetic voice that was ever heard, and began <lb/> to pour out the great Song of Roland!</p>
<pb n="52"/>
<p>Think of that, with a French audience all stirred <lb/> up and ready. Oh, where was your spoken
elo- <lb/> quence now! what was it to this! How fine he <lb/> looked, how stately, how inspired, as
he stood there <lb/> with that mighty chant welling from his lips and his <lb/> heart, his whole
body transfigured, and his rags <lb/> along with it.</p>
<p>Everybody rose and stood while he sang, and <lb/> their faces glowed and their eyes burned; and
the <lb/> tears came and flowed down their cheeks, and their <lb/> forms began to sway unconsciously
to the swing of <lb/> the song, and their bosoms to heave and pant; and <lb/> moanings broke out,
and deep ejaculations; and <lb/> when the last verse was reached, and Roland lay <lb/> dying, all
alone, with his face to the field and to his <lb/> slain, lying there in heaps and winrows, and took
off <lb/> and held up his gauntlet to God with his failing <lb/> hand, and breathed his beautiful
prayer with his <lb/> paling lips, all burst out in sobs and wailings. But <lb/> when the final
great note died out and the song was <lb/> done, they all flung themselves in a body at the <lb/>
singer, stark mad with love of him and love of <lb/> France and pride in her great deeds and old
renown, <lb/> and smothered him with their embracings; but Joan <lb/> was there first, hugged close
to his breast, and <lb/> covering his face with idolatrous kisses.</p>
<p>The storm raged on outside, but that was no <lb/> matter; this was the stranger's home now, for
as <lb/> long as he might please.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER IV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>All</smcap> children have nicknames, and we had ours. <lb/> We got one apiece early, and
they stuck to <lb/> us; but Joan was richer in this matter, for, as time <lb/> went on, she earned a
second, and then a third, and <lb/> so on, and we gave them to her. First and last she <lb/> had as
many as half a dozen. Several of these she <lb/> never lost. Peasant girls are bashful naturally;
but <lb/> she surpassed the rule so far, and colored so easily, <lb/> and was so easily embarrassed
in the presence of <lb/> strangers, that we nicknamed her the Bashful. We <lb/> were all patriots,
but she was called <i>the</i> Patriot, be- <lb/> cause our warmest feeling for our country was cold
<lb/> beside hers. Also she was called the Beautiful; and <lb/> this was not merely because of the
extraordinary <lb/> beauty of her face and form, but because of the <lb/> loveliness of her
character. These names she kept, <lb/> and one other&#x2014;the Brave.</p>
<p>We grew along up, in that plodding and peaceful <lb/> region, and got to be good-sized boys and
girls&#x2014; <lb/> big enough, in fact, to begin to know as much about <lb/> the wars raging
perpetually to the west and north of <lb/> us as our elders, and also to feel as stirred up over <lb/>
<pb n="54"/> the occasional news from those red fields as they <lb/> did. I remember certain of
these days very clearly. <lb/> One Tuesday a crowd of us were romping and sing- <lb/> ing around the
Fairy Tree, and hanging garlands on <lb/> it in memory of our lost little fairy friends, when <lb/>
Little Mengette cried out:</p>
<p>"Look! What is that?"</p>
<p>When one exclaims like that, in a way that shows <lb/> astonishment and apprehension, he gets
attention. <lb/> All the panting breasts and flushed faces flocked <lb/> together, and all the eager
eyes were turned in one <lb/> direction&#x2014;down the slope, toward the village.</p>
<p>"It's a black flag."</p>
<p>"A black flag! No&#x2014;is it?"</p>
<p>"You can see for yourself that it is nothing else."</p>
<p>"It <i>is</i> a black flag, sure! Now, has any ever <lb/> seen the like of that before?"</p>
<p>"What can it mean?"</p>
<p>"Mean? It means something dreadful&#x2014;what <lb/> else?"</p>
<p>"That is nothing to the point; anybody knows <lb/> that without the telling. But
<i>what?</i>&#x2014;that is the <lb/> question."</p>
<p>"It is a chance that he that bears it can answer <lb/> as well as any that are here, if you can
contain <lb/> yourself till he come."</p>
<p>"He runs well. Who is it?"</p>
<p>Some named one, some another; but presently <lb/> all saw that it was &#x00C9;tienne Roze, called
the Sun- <lb/> flower, because he had yellow hair and a round <lb/>
<pb n="55"/> pock-marked face. His ancestors had been Ger- <lb/> mans some centuries ago. He came
straining up <lb/> the slope, now and then projecting his flag-stick <lb/> aloft and giving his
black symbol of woe a wave in <lb/> the air, whilst all eyes watched him, all tongues dis- <lb/>
cussed him, and every heart beat faster and faster <lb/> with impatience to know his news. At last
he <lb/> sprang among us, and struck his flag-stick into the <lb/> ground, saying:</p>
<p>"There! Stand there and represent France while <lb/> I get my breath. She needs no other flag
now."</p>
<p>All the giddy chatter stopped. It was as if one <lb/> had announced a death. In that chilly hush
there <lb/> was no sound audible but the panting of the breath- <lb/> blown boy. When he was
presently able to speak, <lb/> he said:</p>
<p>"Black news is come. A treaty has been made <lb/> at Troyes between France and the English and
Bur- <lb/> gundians. By it France is betrayed and delivered <lb/> over, tied hand and foot, to the
enemy. It is the <lb/> work of the Duke of Burgundy and that she-devil, <lb/> the Queen of France.
It marries Henry of England <lb/> to Catharine of France&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Is not this a lie? Marries the daughter of <lb/> France to the Butcher of Agincourt? It is not
to <lb/> be believed. You have not heard aright."</p>
<p>"If you cannot believe that, Jacques d'Arc, then <lb/> you have a difficult task indeed before
you, for <lb/> worse is to come. Any child that is born of that <lb/> marriage&#x2014;if even a
girl&#x2014;is to inherit the thrones <lb/>
<pb n="56"/> of both England and France, and this double owner- <lb/> ship is to remain with its
posterity forever!"</p>
<p>"Now <i>that</i> is certainly a lie, for it runs counter <lb/> to our Salic law, and so is not
legal and cannot have <lb/> effect," said Edmond Aubrey, called the Paladin, <lb/> because of the
armies he was always going to eat up <lb/> some day. He would have said more, but he was <lb/>
drowned out by the clamors of the others, who all <lb/> burst into a fury over this feature of the
treaty, all <lb/> talking at once and nobody hearing anybody, until <lb/> presently Haumette
persuaded them to be still, <lb/> saying:</p>
<p>"It is not fair to break him up so in his tale; <lb/> pray let him go on. You find fault with his
history <lb/> because it seems to be lies. That were reason for <lb/>
satisfaction&#x2014;<i>that</i> kind of lies&#x2014;not discontent. <lb/> Tell the rest,
&#x00C9;tienne."</p>
<p>"There is but this to tell: Our King, Charles <lb/> VI., is to reign until he dies, then Henry V.
of <lb/> England is to be Regent of France until a child of <lb/> his shall be old enough
to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"<i>That</i> man is to reign over us&#x2014;the Butcher? It <lb/> is lies! all lies!" cried the
Paladin. "Besides, look <lb/> you&#x2014;what becomes of our Dauphin? What says <lb/> the treaty
about him?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. It takes away his throne and makes <lb/> him an outcast."</p>
<p>Then everybody shouted at once and said the <lb/> news was a lie; and all began to get cheerful
again, <lb/> saying, "Our King would have to sign the treaty to <lb/>
<pb n="57"/> make it good; and that he would not do, seeing <lb/> how it serves his own son."</p>
<p>But the Sunflower said: "I will ask you this: <lb/> Would the <i>Queen</i> sign a treaty
disinheriting her son?"</p>
<p>"That viper? Certainly. Nobody is talking of <lb/> her. Nobody expects better of her. There is no
<lb/> villainy she will stick at, if it feed her spite; and <lb/> she hates her son. Her signing it
is of no conse- <lb/> quence. The King must sign."</p>
<p>"I will ask you another thing. What is the <lb/> King's condition? Mad, isn't he?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and his people love him all the more for it. <lb/> It brings him near to them by his
sufferings; and <lb/> pitying him makes them love him."</p>
<p>"You say right, Jacques d'Arc. Well, what would <lb/> you of one that is mad? Does he know what
he <lb/> does? No. Does he do what others make him do? <lb/> Yes. Now, then, I tell you he has
signed the treaty."</p>
<p>"Who made him do it?"</p>
<p>"You know, without my telling. The Queen."</p>
<p>Then there was another uproar&#x2014;everybody talk- <lb/> ing at once, and all heaping
execrations upon the <lb/> Queen's head. Finally Jacques d'Arc said:</p>
<p>"But many reports come that are not true. <lb/> Nothing so shameful as this has ever come before,
<lb/> nothing that cuts so deep, nothing that has dragged <lb/> France so low; therefore there is
hope that this tale <lb/> is but another idle rumor. Where did you get it?"</p>
<p>The color went out of his sister Joan's face. She <lb/> dreaded the answer; and her instinct was
right.</p>
<pb n="58"/>
<p>"The cur&#x00E9; of Maxey brought it."</p>
<p>There was a general gasp. We knew him, you <lb/> see, for a trusty man.</p>
<p>"Did he believe it?"</p>
<p>The hearts almost stopped beating. Then came <lb/> the answer:</p>
<p>"He did. And that is not all. He said he <i>knew</i>
<lb/> it to be true."</p>
<p>Some of the girls began to sob; the boys were <lb/> struck silent. The distress in Joan's face
was like <lb/> that which one sees in the face of a dumb animal <lb/> that has received a mortal
hurt. The animal bears <lb/> it, making no complaint; she bore it also, saying <lb/> no word. Her
brother Jacques put his hand on her <lb/> head and caressed her hair to indicate his sympathy, <lb/>
and she gathered the hand to her lips and kissed it <lb/> for thanks, not saying anything. Presently
the re- <lb/> action came, and the boys began to talk. No&#x00EB;l <lb/> Rainguesson said:</p>
<p>"Oh, are we never going to be men! We do <lb/> grow along so slowly, and France never needed
<lb/> soldiers as she needs them now, to wipe out this <lb/> black insult."</p>
<p>"I hate youth!" said Pierre Morel, called the <lb/> Dragon-fly because his eyes stuck out so.
"You've <lb/> always got to wait, and wait, and wait&#x2014;and here <lb/> are the great wars
wasting away for a hundred years, <lb/> and you never get a chance. If I could only be a <lb/>
soldier now!"</p>
<p>"As for me, I'm not going to wait much longer," <lb/>
<pb n="59"/> said the Paladin; "and when I do start you'll hear <lb/> from me, I promise you that.
There are some who, <lb/> in storming a castle, prefer to be in the rear; but as <lb/> for me, give
me the front or none; I will have none <lb/> in front of me but the officers."</p>
<p>Even the girls got the war spirit, and Marie <lb/> Dupont said:</p>
<p>"I would I were a man; I would start this <lb/> minute!" and looked very proud of herself, and
<lb/> glanced about for applause.</p>
<p>"So would I," said C&#x00E9;cile Letellier, sniffing the <lb/> air like a war-horse that smells
the battle; "I war- <lb/> rant you I would not turn back from the field though <lb/> all England
were in front of me."</p>
<p>"Pooh!" said the Paladin; "girls can brag, but <lb/> that's all they are good for. Let a thousand
of <lb/> them come face to face with a handful of soldiers <lb/> once, if you want to see what
running is like. <lb/> Here's little Joan&#x2014;next <i>she'll</i> be threatening to go <lb/> for a
soldier!"</p>
<p>The idea was so funny, and got such a good <lb/> laugh, that the Paladin gave it another trial,
and <lb/> said: "Why, you can just see her!&#x2014;see her <lb/> plunge into battle like any old
veteran. Yes, indeed; <lb/> and not a poor shabby common soldier like us, but <lb/> an
officer&#x2014;an officer, mind you, with armor on, <lb/> and the bars of a steel helmet to blush
behind and <lb/> hide her embarrassment when she finds an army in <lb/> front of her that she hasn't
been introduced to. An <lb/> officer? Why, she'll be a captain! A captain, I <lb/>
<pb n="60"/> tell you, with a hundred men at her back&#x2014;or <lb/> maybe girls. Oh, no
common-soldier business for <lb/> her! And, dear me, when she starts for that other <lb/> army,
you'll think there's a hurricane blowing it <lb/> away!"</p>
<p>Well, he kept it up like that till he made their <lb/> sides ache with laughing; which was quite
natural, <lb/> for certainly it was a very funny idea&#x2014;at that time <lb/> &#x2014;I mean, the
idea of that gentle little creature, that <lb/> wouldn't hurt a fly, and couldn't bear the sight of
<lb/> blood, and was so girlish and shrinking in all ways, <lb/> rushing into battle with a gang of
soldiers at her <lb/> back. Poor thing, she sat there confused and <lb/> ashamed to be so laughed
at; and yet at that very <lb/> minute there was something about to happen which <lb/> would change
the aspect of things, and make those <lb/> young people see that when it comes to laughing, <lb/>
the person that laughs last has the best chance. For <lb/> just then a face which we all knew and
all feared <lb/> projected itself from behind the Fairy Tree, and the <lb/> thought that shot
through us all was, crazy Benoist <lb/> has gotten loose from his cage, and we are as good <lb/> as
dead! This ragged and hairy and horrible <lb/> creature glided out from behind the tree, and raised
<lb/> an axe as he came. We all broke and fled, this way <lb/> and that, the girls screaming and
crying. No, not <lb/> all; all but Joan. She stood up and faced the man, <lb/> and remained so. As
we reached the wood that <lb/> borders the grassy clearing and jumped into its <lb/> shelter, two or
three of us glanced back to see if <lb/>
<pb n="61"/> Benoist was gaining on us, and that is what we saw <lb/> &#x2014;Joan standing, and the
maniac gliding stealthily <lb/> toward her with his axe lifted. The sight was <lb/> sickening. We
stood where we were, trembling and <lb/> not able to move. I did not want to see the murder <lb/>
done, and yet I could not take my eyes away. Now <lb/> I saw Joan step forward to meet the man,
though I <lb/> believed my eyes must be deceiving me. Then I <lb/> saw him stop. He threatened her
with his axe, as <lb/> if to warn her not to come further, but she paid no <lb/> heed, but went
steadily on, until she was right in <lb/> front of him&#x2014;right under his axe. Then she <lb/>
stopped, and seemed to begin to talk with him. It <lb/> made me sick, yes, giddy, and everything
swam <lb/> around me, and I could not see anything for a time <lb/> &#x2014;whether long or brief I
do not know. When this <lb/> passed and I looked again, Joan was walking by the <lb/> man's side
toward the village, holding him by his <lb/> hand. The axe was in her other hand.</p>
<p>One by one the boys and girls crept out, and we <lb/> stood there gazing, open-mouthed, till
those two <lb/> entered the village and were hid from sight. It was <lb/> then that we named her the
Brave.</p>
<p>We left the black flag there to continue its mourn- <lb/> ful office, for we had other matter to
think of now. <lb/> We started for the village on a run, to give warning, <lb/> and get Joan out of
her peril; though for one, after <lb/> seeing what I had seen, it seemed to me that while <lb/> Joan
had the axe the man's chance was not the best <lb/> of the two. When we arrived the danger was past, <lb/>
<pb n="62"/> the madman was in custody. All the people were <lb/> flocking to the little square in
front of the church to <lb/> talk and exclaim and wonder over the event, and it <lb/> even made the
town forget the black news of the <lb/> treaty for two or three hours.</p>
<p>All the women kept hugging and kissing Joan, <lb/> and praising her, and crying, and the men
patted <lb/> her on the head and said they wished she was a <lb/> man, they would send her to the
wars and never <lb/> doubt but that she would strike some blows that <lb/> would be heard of. She
had to tear herself away <lb/> and go and hide, this glory was so trying to her <lb/>
diffidence.</p>
<p>Of course the people began to ask us for the <lb/> particulars. I was so ashamed that I made an
ex- <lb/> cuse to the first comer, and got privately away and <lb/> went back to the Fairy Tree, to
get relief from the <lb/> embarrassment of those questionings. There I found <lb/> Joan, but she was
there to get relief from the embar- <lb/> rassment of glory. One by one the others shirked <lb/> the
inquirers and joined us in our refuge. Then we <lb/> gathered around Joan, and asked her how she had
<lb/> dared to do that thing. She was very modest about <lb/> it, and said:</p>
<p>"You make a great thing of it, but you mistake; <lb/> it was not a great matter. It was not as if
I had <lb/> been a stranger to the man. I know him, and have <lb/> known him long; and he knows me,
and likes me. <lb/> I have fed him through the bars of his cage many <lb/> times; and last December,
when they chopped off <lb/>
<pb n="63"/> two of his fingers to remind him to stop seizing and <lb/> wounding people passing by,
I dressed his hand <lb/> every day till it was well again."</p>
<p>"That is all well enough," said Little Mengette, <lb/> "but he is a madman, dear, and so his
likings and <lb/> his gratitude and friendliness go for nothing when <lb/> his rage is up. You did a
perilous thing."</p>
<p>"Of course you did," said the Sunflower. "Didn't <lb/> he threaten to kill you with the axe?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Didn't he threaten you more than once?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Didn't you feel afraid?"</p>
<p>"No&#x2014;at least not much&#x2014;very little."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you?"</p>
<p>She thought a moment, then said, quite simply:</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>It made everybody laugh. Then the Sunflower <lb/> said it was like a lamb trying to think out how
it had <lb/> come to eat a wolf, but had to give it up.</p>
<p>C&#x00E9;cile Letellier asked, "Why didn't you run when <lb/> we did?"</p>
<p>"Because it was necessary to get him to his cage; <lb/> else he would kill some one. Then he
would come <lb/> to the like harm himself."</p>
<p>It is noticeable that this remark, which implies <lb/> that Joan was entirely forgetful of
herself and her <lb/> own danger, and had thought and wrought for the <lb/> preservation of other
people alone, was not chal- <lb/> lenged, or criticised, or commented upon by any- <lb/>
<pb n="64"/> body there, but was taken by all as matter of course <lb/> and true. It shows how
clearly her character was <lb/> defined, and how well it was known and established.</p>
<p>There was silence for a time, and perhaps we were <lb/> all thinking of the same
thing&#x2014;namely, what a <lb/> poor figure we had cut in that adventure as con- <lb/> trasted
with Joan's performance. I tried to think <lb/> up some good way of explaining why I had run <lb/>
away and left a little girl at the mercy of a maniac <lb/> armed with an axe, but all of the
explanations that <lb/> offered themselves to me seemed so cheap and <lb/> shabby that I gave the
matter up and remained <lb/> still. But others were less wise. No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson <lb/>
fidgeted a while, then broke out with a remark which <lb/> showed what his mind had been running
on:</p>
<p>"The fact is, I was taken by surprise. That is <lb/> the reason. If I had had a moment to think,
I <lb/> would no more have thought of running than I <lb/> would think of running from a baby. For,
after <lb/> all, what is Th&#x00E9;ophile Benoist, that I should seem to <lb/> be afraid of him?
Pooh! the idea of being afraid <lb/> of that poor thing! I only wish he would come <lb/> along
now&#x2014;I'd show you!"</p>
<p>"So do I!" cried Pierre Morel. "If I wouldn't <lb/> make him climb this tree quicker
than&#x2014;well, you'd <lb/> see what I would do! Taking a person by surprise, <lb/> that
way&#x2014;why, I never meant to run; not in <lb/> earnest, I mean. I never thought of running in
<lb/> earnest; I only wanted to have some fun, and when <lb/> I saw Joan standing there, and him
threatening her, <lb/>
<pb n="65"/> it was all I could do to restrain myself from going <lb/> there and just tearing the
livers and lights out of <lb/> him. I <i>wanted</i> to do it bad enough, and if it was <lb/> to do
over again, I <i>would!</i> If ever he comes fool- <lb/> ing around me again, I'll&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, hush!" said the Paladin, breaking in with <lb/> an air of disdain; "the way you people talk,
a <lb/> person would think there's something heroic about <lb/> standing up and facing down that
poor remnant of <lb/> a man. Why, it's nothing! There's small glory <lb/> to be got in facing
<i>him</i> down, I should say. Why, <lb/> I wouldn't want any better fun than to face down a <lb/>
hundred like him. If he was to come along here <lb/> now, I would walk up to him just as I am
now&#x2014;I <lb/> wouldn't care if he had a thousand axes&#x2014;and <lb/> say&#x2014;"</p>
<p>And so he went on and on, telling the brave <lb/> things he would say and the wonders he would
do; <lb/> and the others put in a word from time to time, <lb/> describing over again the gory
marvels they would <lb/> do if ever that madman ventured to cross their path <lb/> again, for next
time they would be ready for him, <lb/> and would soon teach him that if he thought he <lb/> could
surprise them twice because he had surprised <lb/> them once, he would find himself very seriously
<lb/> mistaken, that's all.</p>
<p>And so, in the end, they all got back their self- <lb/> respect; yes, and even added somewhat to
it; <lb/> indeed, when the sitting broke up they had a finer <lb/> opinion of themselves than they
had ever had before.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER V.</b></head>
<p><smcap>They</smcap> were peaceful and pleasant, those young <lb/> and smoothly-flowing days of
ours; that is, <lb/> that was the case as a rule, we being remote from <lb/> the seat of war; but at
intervals roving bands ap- <lb/> proached near enough for us to see the flush in the <lb/> sky at
night which marked where they were burning <lb/> some farmstead or village, and we all knew, or at
<lb/> least felt, that some day they would come yet <lb/> nearer, and we should have our turn. This
dull <lb/> dread lay upon our spirits like a physical weight. It <lb/> was greatly augmented a
couple of years after the <lb/> Treaty of Troyes.</p>
<p>It was truly a dismal year for France. One day <lb/> we had been over to have one of our
occasional <lb/> pitched battles with those hated Burgundian boys of <lb/> the village of Maxey, and
had been whipped, and <lb/> were arriving on our side of the river after dark, <lb/> bruised and
weary, when we heard the bell ringing <lb/> the tocsin. We ran all the way, and when we got <lb/> to
the square we found it crowded with the excited <lb/> villagers, and weirdly lighted by smoking and
flaring <lb/> torches.</p>
<pb n="67"/>
<p>On the steps of the church stood a stranger, a <lb/> Burgundian priest, who was telling the
people news <lb/> which made them weep, and rave, and rage, and <lb/> curse, by turns. He said our
old mad King was <lb/> dead, and that now we and France and the crown <lb/> were the property of an
English baby lying in his <lb/> cradle in London. And he urged us to give that <lb/> child our
allegiance, and be its faithful servants and <lb/> well-wishers; and said we should now have a
strong <lb/> and stable government at last, and that in a little <lb/> time the English armies would
start on their last <lb/> march, and it would be a brief one, for all that it <lb/> would need to do
would be to conquer what odds <lb/> and ends of our country yet remained under that <lb/> rare and
almost forgotten rag, the banner of France.</p>
<p>The people stormed and raged at him, and you <lb/> could see dozens of them stretch their fists
above <lb/> the sea of torch-lighted faces and shake them at <lb/> him; and it was all a wild
picture, and stirring to <lb/> look at; and the priest was a first-rate part of it, <lb/> too, for
he stood there in the strong glare and looked <lb/> down on those angry people in the blandest and
<lb/> most indifferent way, so that while you wanted to <lb/> burn him at the stake, you still
admired the aggra- <lb/> vating coolness of him. And his winding-up was <lb/> the coolest thing of
all. For he told them how, at <lb/> the funeral of our old King, the French King-at- <lb/> Arms had
broken his staff of office over the coffin <lb/> of "Charles VI. and his dynasty," at the same time
<lb/> saying, in a loud voice, "God grant long life to <lb/>
<pb n="68"/> Henry, King of France and England, our sovereign <lb/> lord!" and then he asked them to
join him in a <lb/> hearty Amen to <i>that!</i></p>
<p>The people were white with wrath, and it tied <lb/> their tongues for the moment, and they could
not <lb/> speak. But Joan was standing close by, and she <lb/> looked up in his face, and said in
her sober, earnest <lb/> way:</p>
<p>"I would I might see thy head struck from thy <lb/> body!"&#x2014;then, after a pause, and
crossing herself <lb/> &#x2014;"if it were the will of God."</p>
<p>This is worth remembering, and I will tell you <lb/> why: it is the only harsh speech Joan ever
uttered <lb/> in her life. When I shall have revealed to you the <lb/> storms she went through, and
the wrongs and perse- <lb/> cutions, then you will see that it was wonderful that <lb/> she said but
one bitter thing while she lived.</p>
<p>From the day that that dreary news came we had <lb/> one scare after another, the marauders
coming <lb/> almost to our doors every now and then; so that <lb/> we lived in ever-increasing
apprehension, and yet <lb/> were somehow mercifully spared from actual attack. <lb/> But at last our
turn did really come. This was in <lb/> the spring of '28. The Burgundians swarmed in <lb/> with a
great noise, in the middle of a dark night, <lb/> and we had to jump up and fly for our lives. We
<lb/> took the road to Neufch&#x00E2;teau, and rushed along in <lb/> the wildest disorder, everybody
trying to get ahead, <lb/> and thus the movements of all were impeded; but <lb/> Joan had a cool
head&#x2014;the only cool head there&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="69"/> and she took command and brought order out of <lb/> that chaos. She did her work
quickly and with <lb/> decision and dispatch, and soon turned the panic <lb/> flight into a quite
steady-going march. You will <lb/> grant that for so young a person, and a girl at that, <lb/> this
was a good piece of work.</p>
<p>She was sixteen now, shapely and graceful, and <lb/> of a beauty so extraordinary that I might
allow <lb/> myself any extravagance of language in describing <lb/> it and yet have no fear of going
beyond the truth. <lb/> There was in her face a sweetness and serenity and <lb/> purity that justly
reflected her spiritual nature. She <lb/> was deeply religious, and this is a thing which some-
<lb/> times gives a melancholy cast to a person's counte- <lb/> nance, but it was not so in her
case. Her religion <lb/> made her inwardly content and joyous; and if she <lb/> was troubled at
times, and showed the pain of it in <lb/> her face and bearing, it came of distress for her <lb/>
country; no part of it was chargeable to her <lb/> religion.</p>
<p>A considerable part of our village was destroyed, <lb/> and when it became safe for us to venture
back there <lb/> we realized what other people had been suffering in <lb/> all the various quarters
of France for many years&#x2014; <lb/> yes, decades of years. For the first time we saw <lb/>
wrecked and smoke-blackened homes, and in the <lb/> lanes and alleys carcasses of dumb creatures
that had <lb/> been slaughtered in pure wantonness&#x2014;among them <lb/> calves and lambs that had
been pets of the children; <lb/> and it was pity to see the children lament over them.</p>
<pb n="70"/>
<p>And then, the taxes, the taxes! Everybody <lb/> thought of that. That burden would fall heavy now
<lb/> in the commune's crippled condition, and all faces <lb/> grew long with the thought of it.
Joan said:</p>
<p>"Paying taxes with naught to pay them with is <lb/> what the rest of France has been doing these
many <lb/> years, but we never knew the bitterness of that be- <lb/> fore. We shall know it
now."</p>
<p>And so she went on talking about it and growing <lb/> more and more troubled about it, until one
could <lb/> see that it was filling all her mind.</p>
<p>At last we came upon a dreadful object. It was <lb/> the madman&#x2014;hacked and stabbed to
death in his <lb/> iron cage in the corner of the square. It was a <lb/> bloody and dreadful sight.
Hardly any of us young <lb/> people had ever seen a man before who had lost his <lb/> life by
violence; so this cadaver had an awful fasci- <lb/> nation for us; we could not take our eyes from
it. <lb/> I mean, it had that sort of fascination for all of us <lb/> but one. That one was Joan.
She turned away in <lb/> horror, and could not be persuaded to go near it <lb/> again.
There&#x2014;it is a striking reminder that we are <lb/> but creatures of use and custom; yes, and
it is a <lb/> reminder, too, of how harshly and unfairly fate deals <lb/> with us sometimes. For it
was so ordered that the <lb/> very ones among us who were most fascinated with <lb/> mutilated and
bloody death were to live their lives in <lb/> peace, while that other, who had a native and deep
<lb/> horror of it, must presently go forth and have it as <lb/> a familiar spectacle every day on
the field of battle.</p>
<pb n="71"/>
<p>You may well believe that we had plenty of matter <lb/> for talk now, since the raiding of our
village seemed <lb/> by long odds the greatest event that had really ever <lb/> occurred in the
world; for although these dull peas- <lb/> ants may have <i>thought</i> they recognized the bigness
<lb/> of some of the previous occurrences that had filtered <lb/> from the world's history dimly
into their minds, the <lb/> truth is that they hadn't. One biting little fact, <lb/> visible to
their eyes of flesh and felt in their own <lb/> personal vitals, became at once more prodigious to
<lb/> them than the grandest remote episode in the world's <lb/> history which they had got at
second-hand and by <lb/> hearsay. It amuses me now when I recall how our <lb/> elders talked then.
They fumed and fretted in a <lb/> fine fashion.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes," said old Jacques d'Arc, "things are <lb/> come to a pretty pass, indeed! The King must
be <lb/> informed of this. It is time that he cease from <lb/> idleness and dreaming, and get at his
proper busi- <lb/> ness." He meant our young disinherited King, the <lb/> hunted refugee, Charles
VII.</p>
<p>"You say well," said the maire. "He should <lb/> be informed, and that at once. It is an outrage
that <lb/> such things should be permitted. Why, we are not <lb/> safe in our beds, and he taking
his ease yonder. It <lb/> shall be made known, indeed it shall&#x2014;all France <lb/> shall hear of
it!"</p>
<p>To hear them talk, one would have imagined that <lb/> all the previous ten thousand sackings and
burnings <lb/> in France had been but fables, and this one the <lb/>
<pb n="72"/> only fact. It is always the way; words will answer <lb/> as long as it is only a
person's neighbor who is in <lb/> trouble, but when that person gets into trouble him- <lb/> self,
it is time that the King rise up and <i>do</i> some- <lb/> thing.</p>
<p>The big event filled us young people with talk, <lb/> too. We let it flow in a steady stream
while we <lb/> tended the flocks. We were beginning to feel pretty <lb/> important now, for I was
eighteen and the other <lb/> youths were from one to four years older&#x2014;young <lb/> men, in
fact. One day the Paladin was arrogantly <lb/> criticising the patriot generals of France and
said:</p>
<p>"Look at Dunois, Bastard of Orleans&#x2014;call <i>him</i>
<lb/> a general! Just put me in his place once&#x2014;never <lb/> mind what I would do, it is not
for me to say, I <lb/> have no stomach for talk, my way is to <i>act</i> and let <lb/> others do the
talking&#x2014;but just put me in his place <lb/> once, that's all! And look at
Saintrailles&#x2014;pooh! <lb/> and that blustering La Hire, now what a general <lb/>
<i>that</i> is!"</p>
<p>It shocked everybody to hear these great names <lb/> so flippantly handled, for to us these
renowned <lb/> soldiers were almost gods. In their far-off splendor <lb/> they rose upon our
imaginations dim and huge, <lb/> shadowy and awful, and it was a fearful thing to <lb/> hear them
spoken of as if they were mere men, and <lb/> their acts open to comment and criticism. The <lb/>
color rose in Joan's face, and she said:</p>
<p>"I know not how any can be so hardy as to use <lb/> such words regarding these sublime men, who
are <lb/>
<pb n="73"/> the very pillars of the French State, supporting it <lb/> with their strength and
preserving it at daily cost of <lb/> their blood. As for me, I could count myself <lb/> honored past
all deserving if I might be allowed but <lb/> the privilege of looking upon them once&#x2014;at a
dis- <lb/> tance, I mean, for it would not become one of my <lb/> degree to approach them too
near."</p>
<p>The Paladin was disconcerted for a moment, see- <lb/> ing by the faces around him that Joan had
put into <lb/> words what the others felt, then he pulled his com- <lb/> placency together and fell
to fault-finding again. <lb/> Joan's brother Jean said:</p>
<p>"If you don't like what our generals do, why <lb/> don't you go to the great wars yourself and
better <lb/> their work? You are always talking about going to <lb/> the wars, but you don't
go."</p>
<p>"Look you," said the Paladin, "it is easy to say <lb/> that. Now I will tell you why I remain
chafing here <lb/> in a bloodless tranquillity which my reputation <lb/> teaches you is repulsive to
my nature. I do not go <lb/> because I am not a gentleman. That is the whole <lb/> reason. What can
one private soldier do in a con- <lb/> test like this? Nothing. He is not permitted to <lb/> rise
from the ranks. If I were a gentleman would I <lb/> remain here? Not one moment. I can save France
<lb/> &#x2014;ah, you may laugh, but I know what is in me, I <lb/> know what is hid under this
peasant cap. I can <lb/> save France, and I stand ready to do it, but not <lb/> under these present
conditions. If they want me, <lb/> let them send for me; otherwise, let them take <lb/>
<pb n="74"/> the consequences; I shall not budge but as an <lb/> officer."</p>
<p>"Alas, poor France&#x2014;France is lost!" said <lb/> Pierre d'Arc.</p>
<p>"Since you sniff so at others, why don't you go <lb/> to the wars yourself, Pierre d'Arc?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I haven't been sent for, either. I am no <lb/> more a gentleman than you. Yet I will go; I
<lb/> promise to go. I promise to go as a private under <lb/> your orders&#x2014;when you are sent
for."</p>
<p>They all laughed, and the Dragon-fly said:</p>
<p>"So soon? Then you need to begin to get <lb/> ready; you might be called for in five
years&#x2014;who <lb/> knows? Yes, in my opinion you'll march for the <lb/> wars in five years."</p>
<p>"He will go sooner," said Joan. She said it in <lb/> a low voice and musingly, but several heard
it.</p>
<p>"How do you know that, Joan?" said the <lb/> Dragon-fly, with a surprised look. But Jean d'Arc
<lb/> broke in and said:</p>
<p>"I want to go myself, but as I am rather young <lb/> yet, I also will wait, and march when the
Paladin is <lb/> sent for."</p>
<p>"No," said Joan, "he will go with Pierre."</p>
<p>She said it as one who talks to himself aloud with- <lb/> out knowing it, and none heard it but
me. I glanced <lb/> at her and saw that her knitting-needles were idle in <lb/> her hands, and that
her face had a dreamy and <lb/> absent look in it. There were fleeting movements <lb/> of her lips
as if she might be occasionally saying <lb/>
<pb n="75"/> parts of sentences to herself. But there was no <lb/> sound, for I was the nearest
person to her and I <lb/> heard nothing. But I set my ears open, for those <lb/> two speeches had
affected me uncannily, I being <lb/> superstitious and easily troubled by any little thing <lb/> of
a strange and unusual sort.</p>
<p>No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson said:</p>
<p>"There is one way to let France have a chance <lb/> for her salvation. We've got <i>one</i>
gentleman in the <lb/> commune, at any rate. Why can't the Scholar <lb/> change name and condition
with the Paladin? Then <lb/> he can be an officer. France will send for him then, <lb/> and he will
sweep these English and Burgundian <lb/> armies into the sea like flies."</p>
<p>I was the Scholar. That was my nickname, be- <lb/> cause I could read and write. There was a
chorus <lb/> of approval, and the Sunflower said:</p>
<p>"That is the very thing&#x2014;it settles every diffi- <lb/> culty. The Sieur de Conte will
easily agree to that. <lb/> Yes, he will march at the back of Captain Paladin <lb/> and die early,
covered with common-soldier <lb/> glory."</p>
<p>"He will march with Jean and Pierre, and live till <lb/> these wars are forgotten," Joan
muttered; "and at <lb/> the eleventh hour No&#x00EB;l and the Paladin will join <lb/> these, but not
of their own desire." The voice was <lb/> so low that I was not perfectly sure that these were <lb/>
the words, but they seemed to be. It makes one <lb/> feel creepy to hear such things.</p>
<p>"Come, now," No&#x00EB;l continued, "it's all ar- <lb/>
<pb n="76"/> ranged; there's nothing to do but organize under <lb/> the Paladin's banner and go
forth and rescue France. <lb/> You'll all join?"</p>
<p>All said yes, except Jacques d'Arc, who said:</p>
<p>"I'll ask you to excuse me. It is pleasant to <lb/> talk war, and I am with you there, and I've
always <lb/> thought I should go soldiering about this time, but <lb/> the look of our wrecked
village and that carved-up <lb/> and bloody madman have taught me that I am not <lb/> made for such
work and such sights. I could never <lb/> be at home in that trade. Face swords and the big <lb/>
guns and death? It isn't in me. No, no; count <lb/> me out. And besides, I'm the eldest son, and
<lb/> deputy prop and protector of the family. Since <lb/> you are going to carry Jean and Pierre to
the wars, <lb/> somebody must be left behind to take care of our <lb/> Joan and her sister. I shall
stay at home, and grow <lb/> old in peace and tranquillity."</p>
<p>"He will stay at home, but not grow old," mur- <lb/> mured Joan.</p>
<p>The talk rattled on in the gay and careless fashion <lb/> privileged to youth, and we got the
Paladin to map <lb/> out his campaigns and fight his battles and win his <lb/> victories and
extinguish the English and put our <lb/> King upon his throne and set his crown upon his <lb/> head.
Then we asked him what he was going to <lb/> answer when the King should require him to name <lb/>
his reward. The Paladin had it all arranged in his <lb/> head, and brought it out promptly:</p>
<p>"He shall give me a dukedom, name me premier <lb/>
<pb n="77"/> peer, and make me Hereditary Lord High Constable <lb/> of France."</p>
<p>"And marry you to a princess&#x2014;you're not <lb/> going to leave that out, are you?"</p>
<p>The Paladin colored a trifle, and said, brusquely:</p>
<p>"He may keep his princesses&#x2014;I can marry more <lb/> to my taste."</p>
<p>Meaning Joan, though nobody suspected it at that <lb/> time. If any had, the Paladin would have
been <lb/> finely ridiculed for his vanity. There was no fit <lb/> mate in that village for Joan of
Arc. Every one <lb/> would have said that.</p>
<p>In turn, each person present was required to say <lb/> what reward he would demand of the King if
he <lb/> could change places with the Paladin and do the <lb/> wonders the Paladin was going to do.
The answers <lb/> were given in fun, and each of us tried to outdo his <lb/> predecessors in the
extravagance of the reward he <lb/> would claim; but when it came to Joan's turn, and <lb/> they
rallied her out of her dreams and asked her to <lb/> testify, they had to explain to her what the
question <lb/> was, for her thought had been absent, and she had <lb/> heard none of this latter
part of our talk. She sup- <lb/> posed they wanted a serious answer, and she gave <lb/> it. She sat
considering some moments, then she said:</p>
<p>"If the Dauphin, out of his grace and nobleness, <lb/> should say to me, 'Now that I am rich and
am <lb/> come to my own again, choose and have,' I should <lb/> kneel and ask him to give command
that our village <lb/> should nevermore be taxed."</p>
<pb n="78"/>
<p>It was so simple and out of her heart that it <lb/> touched us and we did not laugh, but fell to
think- <lb/> ing. We did not laugh; but there came a day when <lb/> we remembered that speech with a
mournful pride, <lb/> and were glad that we had not laughed, perceiving <lb/> then how honest her
words had been, and seeing <lb/> how faithfully she made them good when the time <lb/> came, asking
just that boon of the King and refusing <lb/> to take even any least thing for herself.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER VI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>All</smcap> through her childhood and up to the middle <lb/> of her fourteenth year, Joan
had been the <lb/> most light-hearted creature and the merriest in the <lb/> village, with a
hop-skip-and-jump gait and a happy <lb/> and catching laugh; and this disposition, supple- <lb/>
mented by her warm and sympathetic nature and <lb/> frank and winning ways, had made her everybody's
<lb/> pet. She had been a hot patriot all this time, and <lb/> sometimes the war news had sobered
her spirits and <lb/> wrung her heart and made her acquainted with tears, <lb/> but always when
these interruptions had run their <lb/> course her spirits rose and she was her old self <lb/>
again.</p>
<p>But now for a whole year and a half she had been <lb/> mainly grave; not melancholy, but given to
thought, <lb/> abstraction, dreams. She was carrying France upon <lb/> her heart, and she found the
burden not light. I <lb/> knew that this was her trouble, but others attributed <lb/> her
abstraction to religious ecstasy, for she did not <lb/> share her thinkings with the village at
large, yet <lb/> gave me glimpses of them, and so I knew, better <lb/> than the rest, what was
absorbing her interest. <lb/>
<pb n="80"/> Many a time the idea crossed my mind that she had <lb/> a secret&#x2014;a secret which
she was keeping wholly to <lb/> herself, as well from me as from the others. This <lb/> idea had
come to me because several times she had <lb/> cut a sentence in two and changed the subject when
<lb/> apparently she was on the verge of a revelation of <lb/> some sort. I was to find this secret
out, but not <lb/> just yet.</p>
<p>The day after the conversation which I have been <lb/> reporting we were together in the pastures
and fell <lb/> to talking about France, as usual. For her sake I <lb/> had always talked hopefully
before, but that was <lb/> mere lying, for really there was not anything to <lb/> hang a rag of hope
for France upon. Now it was <lb/> such a pain to lie to her, and cost me such shame to <lb/> offer
this treachery to one so snow-pure from lying <lb/> and treachery, and even from suspicion of such
<lb/> basenesses in others, as she was, that I was resolved <lb/> to face about now and begin over
again, and never <lb/> insult her more with deception. I started on the <lb/> new policy by
saying&#x2014;still opening up with a small <lb/> lie, of course, for habit is habit, and not to be
flung <lb/> out of the window by any man, but coaxed down <lb/> stairs a step at a time:</p>
<p>"Joan, I have been thinking the thing all over <lb/> last night, and have concluded that we have
been in <lb/> the wrong all this time; that the case of France is <lb/> desperate; that it has been
desperate ever since <lb/> Agincourt; and that to-day it is more than desper- <lb/> ate, it is
hopeless."</p>
<pb n="81"/>
<p>I did not look her in the face while I was saying <lb/> it; it could not be expected of a person.
To break <lb/> her heart, to crush her hope with a so frankly brutal <lb/> speech as that, without
one charitable soft place in <lb/> it&#x2014;it seemed a shameful thing, and it was. But <lb/> when
it was out, the weight gone, and my conscience <lb/> rising to the surface, I glanced at her face to
see the <lb/> result.</p>
<p>There was none to see. At least none that I was <lb/> expecting. There was a barely perceptible
sugges- <lb/> tion of wonder in her serious eyes, but that was all; <lb/> and she said, in her
simple and placid way:</p>
<p>"The case of France hopeless? Why should you <lb/> think that? Tell me."</p>
<p>It is a most pleasant thing to find that what you <lb/> thought would inflict a hurt upon one
whom you <lb/> honor, has not done it. I was relieved now, and <lb/> could say all my say without
any furtivenesses and <lb/> without embarrassment. So I began:</p>
<p>"Let us put sentiment and patriotic illusions <lb/> aside, and look the facts in the face. What
do they <lb/> say? They speak as plainly as the figures in a <lb/> merchant's account-book. One has
only to add the <lb/> two columns up to see that the French house is <lb/> bankrupt, that one-half
of its property is already in <lb/> the English sheriff's hands and the other half in <lb/>
nobody's&#x2014;except those of irresponsible raiders <lb/> and robbers confessing allegiance to
nobody. Our <lb/> King is shut up with his favorites and fools in in- <lb/> glorious idleness and
poverty in a narrow little patch <lb/>
<pb n="82"/> of the kingdom&#x2014;a sort of back lot, as one may <lb/> say&#x2014;and has no
authority there or anywhere else, <lb/> hasn't a farthing to his name, nor a regiment of <lb/>
soldiers; he is not fighting, he is not intending to <lb/> fight, he means to make no further
resistance; in <lb/> truth, there is but one thing that he is intending to <lb/> do&#x2014;give the
whole thing up, pitch his crown into <lb/> the sewer, and run away to Scotland. There are <lb/> the
facts. Are they correct?"</p>
<p>"Yes, they are correct."</p>
<p>"Then it is as I have said: one needs but to add <lb/> them together in order to realize what
they mean."</p>
<p>She asked, in an ordinary, level tone:</p>
<p>"What&#x2014;that the case of France is hopeless?"</p>
<p>"Necessarily. In face of these facts, doubt of it <lb/> is impossible."</p>
<p>"How can you say that? How can you <i>feel</i> like <lb/> that?"</p>
<p>"How can I? How could I think or feel in any <lb/> other way, in the circumstances? Joan, with
these <lb/> fatal figures before you, have you really any hope <lb/> for France&#x2014;really and
actually?"</p>
<p>"Hope&#x2014;oh, more than that! France will win <lb/> her freedom and keep it. Do not doubt
it."</p>
<p>It seemed to me that her clear intellect must surely <lb/> be clouded to-day. It must be so, or
she would see <lb/> that those figures <i>could</i> mean only the one thing. <lb/> Perhaps if I
marshaled them again she would see. <lb/> So I said:</p>
<p>"Joan, your heart, which worships France, is <lb/>
<pb n="83"/> beguiling your head. You are not perceiving the <lb/> importance of these figures.
Here&#x2014;I want to <lb/> make a picture of them, here on the ground with a <lb/> stick. Now, this
rough outline is France. Through <lb/> its middle, east and west, I draw a river."</p>
<p>"Yes; the Loire."</p>
<p>"Now, then, this whole northern half of the <lb/> country is in the tight grip of the
English."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And this whole southern half is really in <lb/> nobody's hands at all&#x2014;as our King
confesses by <lb/> meditating desertion and flight to a foreign land. <lb/> England has armies here;
opposition is dead; she <lb/> can assume full possession whenever she may <lb/> choose. In very
truth, <i>all</i> France is gone, France <lb/> is already lost, France has ceased to exist. What
<lb/> was France is now but a British province. Is this <lb/> true?"</p>
<p>Her voice was low, and just touched with emo- <lb/> tion, but distinct:</p>
<p>"Yes, it is true."</p>
<p>"Very well. Now add this clinching fact, and <lb/> surely the sum is complete: When have French
sol- <lb/> diers won a victory? Scotch soldiers, under the <lb/> French flag, have won a barren
fight or two a few <lb/> years back, but I am speaking of French ones. <lb/> Since eight thousand
Englishmen nearly annihilated <lb/> sixty thousand Frenchmen a dozen years ago at <lb/> Agincourt,
French courage has been paralyzed. <lb/> And so it is a common saying to-day that if you <lb/>
<pb n="84"/> confront fifty French soldiers with five English <lb/> ones, the French will run."</p>
<p>"It is a pity, but even these things are true."</p>
<p>"Then certainly the day for hoping is <i>past</i>."</p>
<p>I believed the case would be clear to her now. I <lb/> thought it could not fail to be clear to
her, and that <lb/> she would say, herself, that there was no longer any <lb/> ground for hope. But
I was mistaken; and disap- <lb/> pointed also. She said, without any doubt in her tone:</p>
<p>"France will rise again. You shall see."</p>
<p>"Rise?&#x2014;with this burden of English armies on <lb/> her back!"</p>
<p>"She will cast it off; she will trample it under <lb/> foot!" This with spirit.</p>
<p>"Without soldiers to fight with?"</p>
<p>"The drums will summon them. They will <lb/> answer, and they will march."</p>
<p>"March to the rear, as usual?"</p>
<p>"No; to the front&#x2014;ever to the front&#x2014;always <lb/> to the front! You shall see."</p>
<p>"And the pauper King?"</p>
<p>"He will mount his throne&#x2014;he will wear his <lb/> crown."</p>
<p>"Well, of a truth this makes one's head dizzy. <lb/> Why, if I could believe that in thirty years
from <lb/> now the English domination would be broken and <lb/> the French monarch's head find
itself hooped with a <lb/> real crown of sovereignty&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Both will have happened before two years are <lb/> sped."</p>
<pb n="85"/>
<p>"Indeed? and who is going to perform all these <lb/> sublime impossibilities?"</p>
<p>"God."</p>
<p>It was a reverent low note, but it rang clear.</p>
<p>What could have put those strange ideas in her <lb/> head? This question kept running in my mind
<lb/> during two or three days. It was inevitable that I <lb/> should think of madness. What other
way was <lb/> there to account for such things? Grieving and <lb/> brooding over the woes of France
had weakened <lb/> that strong mind, and filled it with fantastic phan- <lb/> toms&#x2014;yes, that
must be it.</p>
<p>But I watched her, and tested her, and it was not <lb/> so. Her eye was clear and sane, her ways
were <lb/> natural, her speech direct and to the point. No, <lb/> there was nothing the matter with
her mind; it was <lb/> still the soundest in the village and the best. She <lb/> went on thinking
for others, planning for others, <lb/> sacrificing herself for others, just as always before. <lb/>
She went on ministering to her sick and to her <lb/> poor, and still stood ready to give the
wayfarer her <lb/> bed and content herself with the floor. There was <lb/> a secret somewhere, but
madness was not the key to <lb/> it. This was plain.</p>
<p>Now the key did presently come into my hands, <lb/> and the way that it happened was this. You
have <lb/> heard all the world talk of this matter which I am <lb/> about to speak of, but you have
not heard an eye- <lb/> witness talk of it before.</p>
<pb n="86"/>
<p>I was coming from over the ridge, one day&#x2014;it <lb/> was the 15th of May, '28&#x2014;and
when I got to the <lb/> edge of the oak forest and was about to step out of <lb/> it upon the turfy
open space in which the haunted <lb/> beech-tree stood, I happened to cast a glance from <lb/>
cover, first&#x2014;then I took a step backward, and <lb/> stood in the shelter and concealment of
the foliage. <lb/> For I had caught sight of Joan, and thought I would <lb/> devise some sort of
playful surprise for her. Think <lb/> of it&#x2014;that trivial conceit was neighbor, with but a
<lb/> scarcely measurable interval of time between, to an <lb/> event destined to endure forever in
histories and <lb/> songs.</p>
<p>The day was overcast, and all that grassy space <lb/> wherein the Tree stood lay in a soft rich
shadow. <lb/> Joan sat on a natural seat formed by gnarled great <lb/> roots of the Tree. Her hands
lay loosely, one re- <lb/> posing in the other, in her lap. Her head was bent <lb/> a little toward
the ground, and her air was that of <lb/> one who is lost in thought, steeped in dreams, and <lb/>
not conscious of herself or of the world. And now <lb/> I saw a most strange thing, for I saw a
<i>white</i>
<lb/> shadow come slowly gliding along the grass toward <lb/> the Tree. It was of grand
proportions&#x2014;a robed <lb/> form, with wings&#x2014;and the whiteness of this shadow <lb/> was
not like any other whiteness that we know of, <lb/> except it be the whiteness of the lightnings,
but <lb/> even the lightnings are not so intense as it was, for <lb/> one can look at them without
hurt, whereas this <lb/> brilliancy was so blinding that it pained my eyes and <lb/>
<pb n="87"/> brought the water into them. I uncovered my head, <lb/> perceiving that I was in the
presence of something <lb/> not of this world. My breath grew faint and diffi- <lb/> cult, because
of the terror and the awe that pos- <lb/> sessed me.</p>
<p>Another strange thing. The wood had been <lb/> silent&#x2014;smitten with that deep stillness
which comes <lb/> when a storm-cloud darkens a forest, and the wild <lb/> creatures lose heart and
are afraid; but now all the <lb/> birds burst forth in song, and the joy, the rapture, <lb/> the
ecstasy of it was beyond belief; and was so <lb/> eloquent and so moving, withal, that it was plain
it <lb/> was an act of worship. With the first note of those <lb/> birds Joan cast herself upon her
knees, and bent her <lb/> head low and crossed her hands upon her breast.</p>
<p><i>She</i> had not seen the shadow yet. Had the song <lb/> of the birds told her it was coming?
It had that <lb/> look to me. Then the like of this must have hap- <lb/> pened before. Yes, there
might be no doubt of <lb/> that.</p>
<p>The shadow approached Joan slowly; the ex- <lb/> tremity of it reached her, flowed over her,
clothed <lb/> her in its awful splendor. In that immortal light <lb/> her face, only humanly
beautiful before, became <lb/> divine; flooded with that transforming glory her <lb/> mean peasant
habit was become like to the raiment <lb/> of the sun-clothed children of God as we see them <lb/>
thronging the terraces of the Throne in our dreams <lb/> and imaginings.</p>
<p>Presently she rose and stood, with her head still <lb/>
<pb n="88"/> bowed a little, and with her arms down and the ends <lb/> of her fingers lightly laced
together in front of her; <lb/> and standing so, all drenched with that wonderful <lb/> light, and
yet apparently not knowing it, she seemed <lb/> to listen&#x2014;but I heard nothing. After a little
she <lb/> raised her head, and looked up as one might look <lb/> up toward the face of a giant, and
then clasped her <lb/> hands and lifted them high, imploringly, and began <lb/> to plead. I heard
some of the words. I heard her say:</p>
<p>"But I am so young! oh, so young to leave my <lb/> mother and my home and go out into the strange
<lb/> world to undertake a thing so great! Ah, how can <lb/> I talk with men, be comrade with
men?&#x2014;soldiers! <lb/> It would give me over to insult, and rude usage, <lb/> and contempt. How
can I go to the great wars, <lb/> and lead armies?&#x2014;I a girl, and ignorant of such <lb/>
things, knowing nothing of arms, nor how to mount <lb/> a horse, nor ride it&#x2026;&#x2026;.
Yet&#x2014;if it is com- <lb/> manded&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Her voice sank a little, and was broken by sobs, <lb/> and I made out no more of her words. Then
I <lb/> came to myself. I reflected that I had been in- <lb/> truding upon a mystery of
God&#x2014;and what might <lb/> my punishment be? I was afraid, and went deeper <lb/> into the wood.
Then I carved a mark in the bark <lb/> of a tree, saying to myself, it may be that I am <lb/>
dreaming and have not seen this vision at all. I will <lb/> come again, when I know that I am awake
and not <lb/> dreaming, and see if this mark is still here; then I <lb/> shall know.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="VII">
<pb n="89"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER VII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>I heard</smcap> my name called. It was Joan's voice. <lb/> It startled me, for how could
she know I was <lb/> there? I said to myself, it is part of the dream; it <lb/> is all
dream&#x2014;voice, vision and all; the fairies have <lb/> done this. So I crossed myself and
pronounced the <lb/> name of God, to break the enchantment. I knew I <lb/> was awake now and free
from the spell, for no spell <lb/> can withstand this exorcism. Then I heard my name <lb/> called
again, and I stepped at once from under <lb/> cover, and there indeed was Joan, but not looking
<lb/> as she had looked in the dream. For she was not <lb/> crying now, but was looking as she had
used to look <lb/> a year and a half before, when her heart was light <lb/> and her spirits high.
Her old-time energy and fire <lb/> were back, and a something like exaltation showed <lb/> itself in
her face and bearing. It was almost as if <lb/> she had been in a trance all that time and had come
<lb/> awake again. Really, it was just as if she had been <lb/> away and lost, and was come back to
us at last; <lb/> and I was so glad that I felt like running to call <lb/> everybody and have them
flock around her and give <lb/> her welcome. I ran to her excited, and said:</p>
<p>"Ah, Joan, I've got such a wonderful thing to <lb/>
<pb n="90"/> tell you about! You would never imagine it. I've <lb/> had a dream, and in the dream I
saw you right here <lb/> where you are standing now, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>But she put up her hand and said:</p>
<p>"It was not a dream."</p>
<p>It gave me a shock, and I began to feel afraid <lb/> again.</p>
<p>"Not a dream?" I said, "how can you know <lb/> about it, Joan?"</p>
<p>"Are you dreaming now?"</p>
<p>"I&#x2014;I suppose not. I think I am not."</p>
<p>"Indeed you are not. I know you are not. <lb/> And you were not dreaming when you cut the mark
<lb/> in the tree."</p>
<p>I felt myself turning cold with fright, for now I <lb/> knew of a certainty that I had not been
dreaming, <lb/> but had really been in the presence of a dread some- <lb/> thing not of this world.
Then I remembered that <lb/> my sinful feet were upon holy ground&#x2014;the ground <lb/> where that
celestial shadow had rested. I moved <lb/> quickly away, smitten to the bones with fear. Joan <lb/>
followed, and said:</p>
<p>"Do not be afraid; indeed there is no need. <lb/> Come with me. We will sit by the spring and I
will <lb/> tell you all my secret."</p>
<p>When she was ready to begin, I checked her and <lb/> said:</p>
<p>"First tell me this. You could not see me in the <lb/> wood; how did you know I cut a mark in the
<lb/> tree?"</p>
<pb n="91"/>
<p>"Wait a little; I will soon come to that; then <lb/> you will see."</p>
<p>"But tell me one thing now; what was that awful <lb/> shadow that I saw?"</p>
<p>"I will tell you, but do not be disturbed; you <lb/> are not in danger. It was the shadow of an
arch- <lb/> angel&#x2014;Michael, the chief and lord of the armies <lb/> of heaven."</p>
<p>I could but cross myself and tremble for having <lb/> polluted that ground with my feet.</p>
<p>"You were not afraid, Joan? Did you see his <lb/> face&#x2014;did you see his form?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I was not afraid, because this was not the <lb/> first time. I was afraid the first
time."</p>
<p>"When was that, Joan?"</p>
<p>"It is nearly three years ago now."</p>
<p>"So long? Have you seen him many times?"</p>
<p>"Yes, many times."</p>
<p>"It is this, then, that has changed you; it was <lb/> this that made you thoughtful and not as
you were <lb/> before. I see it now. Why did you not tell us <lb/> about it?"</p>
<p>"It was not permitted. It is permitted now, and <lb/> soon I shall tell all. But only you, now.
It must <lb/> remain a secret a few days still."</p>
<p>"Has none seen that white shadow before but me?"</p>
<p>"No one. It has fallen upon me before when <lb/> you and others were present, but none could see
it. <lb/> To-day it has been otherwise, and I was told why; <lb/> but it will not be visible again
to any."</p>
<pb n="92"/>
<p>"It was a sign to me, then&#x2014;and a sign with a <lb/> meaning of some kind?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I may not speak of that."</p>
<p>"Strange&#x2014;that that dazzling light could rest <lb/> upon an object before one's eyes and
not be <lb/> visible."</p>
<p>"With it comes speech, also. Several saints <lb/> come, attended by myriads of angels, and they
<lb/> speak to me; I hear their voices, but others do not. <lb/> They are very dear to me&#x2014;my
Voices; that is <lb/> what I call them to myself."</p>
<p>"Joan, what do they tell you?"</p>
<p>"All manner of things&#x2014;about France, I mean."</p>
<p>"What things have they been used to tell you?"</p>
<p>She sighed, and said:</p>
<p>"Disasters&#x2014;only disasters, and misfortunes, and <lb/> humiliations. There was naught else
to foretell."</p>
<p>"They spoke of them to you <i>beforehand?</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes. So that I knew what was going to happen <lb/> before it happened. It made me
grave&#x2014;as you <lb/> saw. It could not be otherwise. But always there <lb/> was a word of hope,
too. More than that: France <lb/> was to be rescued, and made great and free again. <lb/> But how
and by whom&#x2014;that was not told. Not <lb/> until to-day." As she said those last words a sudden
<lb/> deep glow shone in her eyes, which I was to see <lb/> there many times in after-days when the
bugles <lb/> sounded the charge and learn to call it the battle- <lb/> light. Her breast heaved, and
the color rose in her <lb/> face. "But to-day I know. God has chosen the <lb/>
<pb n="93"/> meanest of His creatures for this work; and by His <lb/> command, and in His
protection, and by His <lb/> strength, not mine, I am to lead His armies, and <lb/> win back France,
and set the crown upon the head <lb/> of His servant that is Dauphin and shall be King."</p>
<p>I was amazed, and said:</p>
<p>"You, Joan? You, a child, lead armies?"</p>
<p>"Yes. For one little moment or two the thought <lb/> crushed me; for it is as you say&#x2014;I am
only a <lb/> child; a child and ignorant&#x2014;ignorant of everything <lb/> that pertains to war,
and not fitted for the rough <lb/> life of camps and the companionship of soldiers. <lb/> But those
weak moments passed; they will not come <lb/> again. I am enlisted, I will not turn back, God <lb/>
helping me, till the English grip is loosed from the <lb/> throat of France. My Voices have never
told me <lb/> lies, they have not lied to-day. They say I am to <lb/> go to Robert de Baudricourt,
governor of Vaucou- <lb/> leurs, and he will give me men-at-arms for escort <lb/> and send me to the
King. A year from now a blow <lb/> will be struck which will be the beginning of the <lb/> end, and
the end will follow swiftly."</p>
<p>"Where will it be struck?"</p>
<p>"My Voices have not said; nor what will happen <lb/> this present year, before it is struck. It
is appointed <lb/> me to strike it, that is all I know; and follow it with <lb/> others, sharp and
swift, undoing in ten weeks Eng- <lb/> land's long years of costly labor, and setting the <lb/>
crown upon the Dauphin's head&#x2014;for such is God's <lb/> will; my Voices have said it, and shall
I doubt it? <lb/>
<pb n="94"/> No; it will be as they have said, for they say only <lb/> that which is true."</p>
<p>These were tremendous sayings. They were im- <lb/> possibilities to my reason, but to my heart
they rang <lb/> true; and so, while my reason doubted, my heart <lb/> believed&#x2014;believed, and
held fast to its belief from <lb/> that day. Presently I said:</p>
<p>"Joan, I believe the things which you have said, <lb/> and now I am glad that I am to march with
you to <lb/> the great wars&#x2014;that is, if it is with you I am to <lb/> march when I go."</p>
<p>She looked surprised, and said:</p>
<p>"It is true that you will be with me when I go to <lb/> the wars, but how did you know?"</p>
<p>"I shall march with you, and so also will Jean <lb/> and Pierre, but not Jacques."</p>
<p>"All true&#x2014;it is so ordered, as was revealed to <lb/> me lately, but I did not know until
to-day that the <lb/> marching would be with me, or that I should march <lb/> at all. How did you
know these things?"</p>
<p>I told her when it was that she had said them. <lb/> But she did not remember about it. So then I
knew <lb/> that she had been asleep, or in a trance or an ecstasy <lb/> of some kind, at that time.
She bade me keep these <lb/> and the other revelations to myself for the present, <lb/> and I said I
would, and kept the faith I promised.</p>
<p>None who met Joan that day failed to notice the <lb/> change that had come over her. She moved
and <lb/> spoke with energy and decision; there was a strange <lb/>
<pb n="95"/> new fire in her eye, and also a something wholly <lb/> new and remarkable in her
carriage and in the set of <lb/> her head. This new light in the eye and this new <lb/> bearing were
born of the authority and leadership <lb/> which had this day been vested in her by the decree <lb/>
of God, and they asserted that authority as plainly <lb/> as speech could have done it, yet without
ostenta- <lb/> tion or bravado. This calm consciousness of com- <lb/> mand, and calm unconscious
outward expression of <lb/> it, remained with her thenceforth until her mission <lb/> was
accomplished.</p>
<p>Like the other villagers, she had always accorded <lb/> me the deference due my rank; but now,
without <lb/> word said on either side, she and I changed places; <lb/> she gave orders, not
suggestions. I received them <lb/> with the deference due a superior, and obeyed them <lb/> without
comment. In the evening she said to me:</p>
<p>"I leave before dawn. No one will know it but <lb/> you. I go to speak with the governor of
Vaucou- <lb/> leurs as commanded, who will despise me and treat <lb/> me rudely, and perhaps refuse
my prayer at this <lb/> time. I go first to Burey, to persuade my uncle <lb/> Laxart to go with me,
it not being meet that I go <lb/> alone. I may need you in Vaucouleurs; for if the <lb/> governor
will not receive me I will dictate a letter to <lb/> him, and so must have some one by me who knows
<lb/> the art of how to write and spell the words. You <lb/> will go from here to-morrow in the
afternoon, and <lb/> remain in Vaucouleurs until I need you."</p>
<p>I said I would obey, and she went her way. You <lb/>
<pb n="96"/> see how clear a head she had, and what a just and <lb/> level judgment. She did not
order me to go with <lb/> her; no, she would not subject her good name to <lb/> gossiping remark.
She knew that the governor, <lb/> being a noble, would grant me, another noble, audi- <lb/> ence;
but no, you see, she would not have that, <lb/> either. A poor peasant girl presenting a petition
<lb/> through a young nobleman&#x2014;how would that look? <lb/> She always protected her modesty
from hurt; and <lb/> so, for reward, she carried her good name un- <lb/> smirched to the end. I knew
what I must do now, <lb/> if I would have her approval: go to Vaucouleurs, <lb/> keep out of her
sight, and be ready when <lb/> wanted.</p>
<p>I went the next afternoon, and took an obscure <lb/> lodging; the next day I called at the castle
and paid <lb/> my respects to the governor, who invited me to dine <lb/> with him at noon of the
following day. He was an <lb/> ideal soldier of the time; tall, brawny, gray-headed, <lb/> rough,
full of strange oaths acquired here and there <lb/> and yonder in the wars and treasured as if they
were <lb/> decorations. He had been used to the camp all his <lb/> life, and to his notion war was
God's best gift to <lb/> man. He had his steel cuirass on, and wore boots <lb/> that came above his
knees, and was equipped with a <lb/> huge sword; and when I looked at this martial <lb/> figure, and
heard the marvelous oaths, and guessed <lb/> how little of poetry and sentiment might be looked
<lb/> for in this quarter, I hoped the little peasant girl <lb/> would not get the privilege of
confronting this <lb/>
<pb n="97"/> battery, but would have to content herself with the <lb/> dictated letter.</p>
<p>I came again to the castle the next day at noon, <lb/> and was conducted to the great dining-hall
and <lb/> seated by the side of the governor at a small table <lb/> which was raised a couple of
steps higher than the <lb/> general table. At the small table sat several other <lb/> guests besides
myself, and at the general table sat <lb/> the chief officers of the garrison. At the entrance <lb/>
door stood a guard of halberdiers, in morion and <lb/> breastplate.</p>
<p>As for talk, there was but one topic, of course&#x2014; <lb/> the desperate situation of France.
There was a <lb/> rumor, some one said, that Salisbury was making <lb/> preparations to march
against Orleans. It raised a <lb/> turmoil of excited conversation, and opinions fell <lb/> thick
and fast. Some believed he would march at <lb/> once, others that he could not accomplish the in-
<lb/> vestment before fall, others that the siege would be <lb/> long, and bravely contested; but
upon one thing all <lb/> voices agreed: that Orleans must eventually fall, <lb/> and with it France.
With that, the prolonged dis- <lb/> cussion ended, and there was silence. Every man <lb/> seemed to
sink himself in his own thoughts, and to <lb/> forget where he was. This sudden and profound <lb/>
stillness, where before had been so much animation, <lb/> was impressive and solemn. Now came a
servant <lb/> and whispered something to the governor, who said:</p>
<p>"Would talk with <i>me?</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes, your Excellency."</p>
<pb n="98"/>
<p>"H'm! A strange idea, certainly. Bring them <lb/> in."</p>
<p>It was Joan and her uncle Laxart. At the spec- <lb/> tacle of the great people the courage oozed
out of <lb/> the poor old peasant and he stopped midway and <lb/> would come no further, but
remained there with his <lb/> red nightcap crushed in his hands and bowing <lb/> humbly here, there,
and everywhere, stupefied with <lb/> embarrassment and fear. But Joan came steadily <lb/> forward,
erect and self-possessed, and stood before <lb/> the governor. She recognized me, but in no way
<lb/> indicated it. There was a buzz of admiration, even <lb/> the governor contributing to it, for
I heard him <lb/> mutter, "By God's grace, it is a beautiful creature!" <lb/> He inspected her
critically a moment or two, then <lb/> said:</p>
<p>"Well, what is your errand, my child?"</p>
<p>"My message is to you, Robert de Baudricourt, <lb/> governor of Vaucouleurs, and it is this: that
you <lb/> will send and tell the Dauphin to wait and not give <lb/> battle to his enemies, for God
will presently send <lb/> him help."</p>
<p>This strange speech amazed the company, and <lb/> many murmured, "The poor young thing is de-
<lb/> mented." The governor scowled, and said:</p>
<p>"What nonsense is this? The King&#x2014;or the <lb/> Dauphin, as you call him&#x2014;needs no
message of <lb/>
<i>that</i> sort. He will wait, give yourself no uneasiness <lb/> as to that. What further do you
desire to say to <lb/> me?"</p>
<pb n="99"/>
<p>"This. To beg that you will give me an escort <lb/> of men-at-arms and send me to the
Dauphin."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"That he may make me his general, for it is ap- <lb/> pointed that I shall drive the English out
of France, <lb/> and set the crown upon his head."</p>
<p>"What&#x2014;you? Why, you are but a child!"</p>
<p>"Yet am I appointed to do it, nevertheless."</p>
<p>"Indeed! And when will all this happen?"</p>
<p>"Next year he will be crowned, and after that <lb/> will remain master of France."</p>
<p>There was a great and general burst of laughter, <lb/> and when it had subsided the governor
said:</p>
<p>"Who has sent you with these extravagant mes- <lb/> sages?"</p>
<p>"My Lord."</p>
<p>"What Lord?"</p>
<p>"The King of Heaven."</p>
<p>Many murmured, "Ah, poor thing, poor thing!" <lb/> and others, "Ah, her mind is but a wreck!" The
<lb/> governor hailed Laxart, and said:</p>
<p>"Harkye!&#x2014;take this mad child home and whip <lb/> her soundly. That is the best cure for
her ailment."</p>
<p>As Joan was moving away she turned and said, <lb/> with simplicity:</p>
<p>"You refuse me the soldiers, I know not why, <lb/> for it is my Lord that has commanded you. Yes,
it <lb/> is He that has made the command; therefore must <lb/> I come again, and yet again; then I
shall have the <lb/> men-at-arms."</p>
<pb n="100"/>
<p>There was a great deal of wondering talk, after <lb/> she was gone; and the guards and servants
passed <lb/> the talk to the town, the town passed it to the <lb/> country; Domremy was already
buzzing with it <lb/> when we got back.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="VIII">
<pb n="101"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER VIII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Human</smcap> nature is the same everywhere: it deifies <lb/> success, it has nothing but
scorn for defeat. <lb/> The village considered that Joan had disgraced it <lb/> with her grotesque
performance and its ridiculous <lb/> failure; so all the tongues were busy with the <lb/> matter,
and as bilious and bitter as they were busy; <lb/> insomuch that if the tongues had been teeth she
<lb/> would not have survived her persecutions. Those <lb/> persons who did not scold did what was
worse and <lb/> harder to bear; for they ridiculed her, and mocked <lb/> at her, and ceased neither
day nor night from their <lb/> witticisms and jeerings and laughter. Haumette <lb/> and Little
Mengette and I stood by her, but the <lb/> storm was too strong for her other friends, and they
<lb/> avoided her, being ashamed to be seen with her <lb/> because she was so unpopular, and because
of the <lb/> sting of the taunts that assailed them on her account. <lb/> She shed tears in secret,
but none in public. In <lb/> public she carried herself with serenity, and showed <lb/> no distress,
nor any resentment&#x2014;conduct which <lb/> should have softened the feeling against her, but <lb/>
<pb n="102"/> it did not. Her father was so incensed that he <lb/> could not talk in measured terms
about her wild <lb/> project of going to the wars like a man. He had <lb/> dreamed of her doing such
a thing, some time <lb/> before, and now he remembered that dream with <lb/> apprehension and anger,
and said that rather than <lb/> see her unsex herself and go away with the armies, <lb/> he would
require her brothers to drown her; and <lb/> that if they should refuse, he would do it with his
<lb/> own hands.</p>
<p>But none of these things shook her purpose in the <lb/> least. Her parents kept a strict watch
upon her to <lb/> keep her from leaving the village, but she said her <lb/> time was not yet; that
when the time to go was <lb/> come she should know it, and then the keepers <lb/> would watch in
vain.</p>
<p>The summer wasted along; and when it was <lb/> seen that her purpose continued steadfast, the
<lb/> parents were glad of a chance which finally offered <lb/> itself for bringing her projects to
an end through <lb/> marriage. The Paladin had the effrontery to pre- <lb/> tend that she had
engaged herself to him several <lb/> years before, and now he claimed a ratification of <lb/> the
engagement.</p>
<p>She said his statement was not true, and refused <lb/> to marry him. She was cited to appear
before the <lb/> ecclesiastical court at Toul to answer for her per- <lb/> versity; when she
declined to have counsel, and <lb/> elected to conduct her case herself, her parents and <lb/> all
her ill-wishers rejoiced, and looked upon her as <lb/>
<pb n="103"/> already defeated. And that was natural enough; <lb/> for who would expect that an
ignorant peasant girl <lb/> of sixteen would be otherwise than frightened and <lb/> tongue-tied when
standing for the first time in pres- <lb/> ence of the practiced doctors of the law, and sur- <lb/>
rounded by the cold solemnities of a court? Yet all <lb/> these people were mistaken. They flocked
to Toul <lb/> to see and enjoy this fright and embarrassment and <lb/> defeat, and they had their
trouble for their pains. <lb/> She was modest, tranquil, and quite at her ease. <lb/> She called no
witnesses, saying she would content <lb/> herself with examining the witnesses for the prose- <lb/>
cution. When they had testified, she rose and re- <lb/> viewed their testimony in a few words,
pronounced <lb/> it vague, confused, and of no force, then she placed <lb/> the Paladin again on the
stand and began to search <lb/> him. His previous testimony went rag by rag to <lb/> ruin under her
ingenious hands, until at last he <lb/> stood bare, so to speak, he that had come so richly <lb/>
clothed in fraud and falsehood. His counsel began <lb/> an argument, but the court declined to hear
it, and <lb/> threw out the case, adding a few words of grave <lb/> compliment for Joan, and
referring to her as "this <lb/> marvelous child."</p>
<p>After this victory, with this high praise from so <lb/> imposing a source added, the fickle
village turned <lb/> again, and gave Joan countenance, compliment, and <lb/> peace. Her mother took
her back to her heart, and <lb/> even her father relented and said he was proud of <lb/> her. But
the time hung heavy on her hands, never- <lb/>
<pb n="104"/> theless, for the siege of Orleans was begun, the <lb/> clouds lowered darker and
darker over France, and <lb/> still her Voices said wait, and gave her no direct <lb/> commands. The
winter set in, and wore tediously <lb/> along; but at last there was a change.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="I">
<pb n="107"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER I.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> 5th of January, 1429, Joan came to me with <lb/> her uncle Laxart, and
said:</p>
<p>"The time is come. My Voices are not vague <lb/> now, but clear, and they have told me what to
do. <lb/> In two months I shall be with the Dauphin."</p>
<p>Her spirits were high, and her bearing martial. I <lb/> caught the infection and felt a great
impulse stirring <lb/> in me that was like what one feels when he hears <lb/> the roll of the drums
and the tramp of marching <lb/> men.</p>
<p>"I believe it," I said.</p>
<p>"I also believe it," said Laxart. "If she had <lb/> told me before, that she was commanded of God
to <lb/> rescue France, I should not have believed; I should <lb/> have let her seek the governor by
her own ways and <lb/> held myself clear of meddling in the matter, not <lb/> doubting she was mad.
But I have seen her stand <lb/> before those nobles and mighty men unafraid, and <lb/> say her say;
and she had not been able to do that <lb/> but by the help of God. That I know. Therefore <lb/> with
all humbleness I am at her command, to do <lb/> with me as she will."</p>
<p>"My uncle is very good to me," Joan said. "I <lb/>
<pb n="108"/> sent and asked him to come and persuade my <lb/> mother to let him take me home with
him to tend <lb/> his wife, who is not well. It is arranged, and we <lb/> go at dawn to-morrow. From
his house I shall go <lb/> soon to Vaucouleurs, and wait and strive until my <lb/> prayer is
granted. Who were the two cavaliers who <lb/> sat to your left at the governor's table that
day?"</p>
<p>"One was the Sieur Jean de Novelonpont de <lb/> Metz, the other the Sieur Bertrand de
Poulengy."</p>
<p>"Good metal&#x2014;good metal, both. I marked <lb/> them for men of mine&#x2026;&#x2026; What is
it I see in your <lb/> face? Doubt?"</p>
<p>I was teaching myself to speak the truth to her, <lb/> not trimming it or polishing it; so I
said:</p>
<p>"They considered you out of your head, and <lb/> said so. It is true they pitied you for being in
such <lb/> misfortune, but still they held you to be mad."</p>
<p>This did not seem to trouble her in any way or <lb/> wound her. She only said:</p>
<p>"The wise change their minds when they perceive <lb/> that they have been in error. These will.
They <lb/> will march with me. I shall see them presently. <lb/> &#x2026;&#x2026;You seem to doubt
again? Do you doubt?"</p>
<p>"N-no. Not now. I was remembering that it <lb/> was a year ago, and that they did not belong
there, <lb/> but only chanced to stop a day on their journey."</p>
<p>"They will come again. But as to matters now <lb/> in hand; I came to leave with you some
instructions. <lb/> You will follow me in a few days. Order your <lb/> affairs, for you will be
absent long."</p>
<pb n="109"/>
<p>"Will Jean and Pierre go with me?"</p>
<p>"No; they would refuse now, but presently they <lb/> will come, and with them they will bring my
parents' <lb/> blessing, and likewise their consent that I take up <lb/> my mission. I shall be
stronger, then&#x2014;stronger <lb/> for that; for lack of it I am weak now." She <lb/> paused a
little while, and the tears gathered in her <lb/> eyes; then she went on: "I would say good-bye to
<lb/> Little Mengette. Bring her outside the village at <lb/> dawn; she must go with me a little of
the way&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"And Haumette?"</p>
<p>She broke down and began to cry, saying:</p>
<p>"No, oh, no&#x2014;she is too dear to me, I could not <lb/> bear it, knowing I should never look
upon her face <lb/> again."</p>
<p>Next morning I brought Mengette, and we four <lb/> walked along the road in the cold dawn till
the <lb/> village was far behind; then the two girls said their <lb/> good-byes, clinging about each
other's neck, and <lb/> pouring out their grief in loving words and tears, a <lb/> pitiful sight to
see. And Joan took one long look <lb/> back upon the distant village, and the Fairy Tree, <lb/> and
the oak forest, and the flowery plain, and the <lb/> river, as if she was trying to print these
scenes on <lb/> her memory so that they would abide there always <lb/> and not fade, for she knew
she would not see them <lb/> any more in this life; then she turned, and went <lb/> from us, sobbing
bitterly. It was her birthday and <lb/> mine. She was seventeen years old.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="II">
<pb n="110"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER II.</b></head>
<p><smcap>After</smcap> a few days, Laxart took Joan to Vaucou- <lb/> leurs, and found lodging and
guardianship for <lb/> her with Catherine Royer, a wheelwright's wife, an <lb/> honest and good
woman. Joan went to mass regu- <lb/> larly, she helped do the housework, earning her <lb/> keep in
that way, and if any wished to talk with her <lb/> about her mission&#x2014;and many did&#x2014;she
talked <lb/> freely, making no concealments regarding the matter <lb/> now. I was soon housed near
by, and witnessed <lb/> the effects which followed. At once the tidings <lb/> spread that a young
girl was come who was ap- <lb/> pointed of God to save France. The common peo- <lb/> ple flocked in
crowds to look at her and speak with <lb/> her, and her fair young loveliness won the half of <lb/>
their belief, and her deep earnestness and trans- <lb/> parent sincerity won the other half. The
well-to-do <lb/> remained away and scoffed, but that is their way.</p>
<p>Next, a prophecy of Merlin's, more than eight <lb/> hundred years old, was called to mind, which
said <lb/> that in a far future time France would be lost by a <lb/> woman and restored by a woman.
France was now, <lb/> for the first time, lost&#x2014;and by a woman, Isabel of <lb/>
<pb n="111"/> Bavaria, her base Queen; doubtless this fair and <lb/> pure young girl was
commissioned of Heaven to <lb/> complete the prophecy.</p>
<p>This gave the growing interest a new and power- <lb/> ful impulse; the excitement rose higher and
higher, <lb/> and hope and faith along with it; and so from <lb/> Vaucouleurs wave after wave of
this inspiring en- <lb/> thusiasm flowed out over the land, far and wide, <lb/> invading all the
villages and refreshing and revivify- <lb/> ing the perishing children of France; and from <lb/>
these villages came people who wanted to see for <lb/> themselves, hear for themselves; and they did
see <lb/> and hear, and believe. They filled the town; they <lb/> more than filled it; inns and
lodgings were packed, <lb/> and yet half of the inflow had to go without shelter. <lb/> And still
they came, winter as it was, for when a <lb/> man's soul is starving, what does he care for meat
<lb/> and roof so he can but get that nobler hunger fed? <lb/> Day after day, and still day after
day the great tide <lb/> rose. Domremy was dazed, amazed, stupefied, and <lb/> said to itself, "Was
this world-wonder in our <lb/> familiar midst all these years and we too dull to see <lb/> it?" Jean
and Pierre went out from the village, <lb/> stared at and envied like the great and fortunate of
<lb/> the earth, and their progress to Vaucouleurs was <lb/> like a triumph, all the country-side
flocking to see <lb/> and salute the brothers of one with whom angels <lb/> had spoken face to face,
and into whose hands by <lb/> command of God they had delivered the destinies of <lb/> France.</p>
<pb n="112"/>
<p>The brothers brought the parents' blessing and <lb/> godspeed to Joan, and their promise to bring
it to <lb/> her in person later; and so, with this culminating <lb/> happiness in her heart and the
high hope it inspired, <lb/> she went and confronted the governor again. But <lb/> he was no more
tractable than he had been before. <lb/> He refused to send her to the King. She was dis- <lb/>
appointed, but in no degree discouraged. She said:</p>
<p>"I must still come to you until I get the men-at- <lb/> arms; for so it is commanded, and I may
not dis- <lb/> obey. I must go to the Dauphin, though I go on <lb/> my knees."</p>
<p>I and the two brothers were with Joan daily, to <lb/> see the people that came and hear what they
said; <lb/> and one day, sure enough, the Sieur Jean de Metz <lb/> came. He talked with her in a
petting and playful <lb/> way, as one talks with children, and said:</p>
<p>"What are you doing here, my little maid? Will <lb/> they drive the King out of France, and shall
we all <lb/> turn English?"</p>
<p>She answered him in her tranquil, serious way:</p>
<p>"I am come to bid Robert de Baudricourt take <lb/> or send me to the King, but he does not heed
my <lb/> words."</p>
<p>"Ah, you have an admirable persistence, truly; <lb/> a whole year has not turned you from your
wish. I <lb/> saw you when you came before."</p>
<p>Joan said, as tranquilly as before:</p>
<p>"It is not a wish, it is a purpose. He will grant <lb/> it. I can wait."</p>
<pb n="113"/>
<p>"Ah, perhaps it will not be wise to make too sure <lb/> of <i>that</i>, my child. These governors
are stubborn <lb/> people to deal with. In case he shall not grant your <lb/> prayer&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"He will grant it. He must. It is not matter of <lb/> choice."</p>
<p>The gentleman's playful mood began to disappear <lb/> &#x2014;one could see that, by his face.
Joan's earnest- <lb/> ness was affecting him. It always happened that <lb/> people who began in jest
with her ended by being <lb/> in earnest. They soon began to perceive depths in <lb/> her that they
had not suspected; and then her mani- <lb/> fest sincerity and the rock-like steadfastness of her
<lb/> convictions were forces which cowed levity, and it <lb/> could not maintain its self-respect
in their presence. <lb/> The Sieur de Metz was thoughtful for a moment or <lb/> two, then he began,
quite soberly:</p>
<p>"Is it necessary that you go to the King soon?&#x2014; <lb/> that is, I mean&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Before Mid-Lent, even though I wear away my <lb/> legs to the knees!"</p>
<p>She said it with that sort of repressed fieriness <lb/> that means so much when a person's heart
is in a <lb/> thing. You could see the response in that noble- <lb/> man's face; you could see his
eye light up; there <lb/> was sympathy there. He said, most earnestly:</p>
<p>"God knows I think you should have the men-at- <lb/> arms, and that somewhat would come of it.
What <lb/> is it that you would do? What is your hope and <lb/> purpose?"</p>
<pb n="114"/>
<p>"To rescue France. And it is appointed that I <lb/> shall do it. For no one else in the world,
neither <lb/> kings, nor dukes, nor any other, can recover the <lb/> kingdom of France, and there is
no help but in <lb/> me."</p>
<p>The words had a pleading and pathetic sound, <lb/> and they touched that good nobleman. I saw it
<lb/> plainly. Joan dropped her voice a little, and said: <lb/> "But indeed I would rather spin with
my poor <lb/> mother, for this is not my calling; but I must go <lb/> and do it, for it is my Lord's
will."</p>
<p>"Who is your Lord?"</p>
<p>"He is God."</p>
<p>Then the Sieur de Metz, following the impressive <lb/> old feudal fashion, knelt and laid his
hands within <lb/> Joan's in sign of fealty, and made oath that by <lb/> God's help he himself would
take her to the King.</p>
<p>The next day came the Sieur Bertrand de Pou- <lb/> lengy, and he also pledged his oath and
knightly <lb/> honor to abide with her and follow whithersoever she <lb/> might lead.</p>
<p>This day, too, toward evening, a great rumor <lb/> went flying abroad through the
town&#x2014;namely, that <lb/> the very governor himself was going to visit the <lb/> young girl in
her humble lodgings. So in the morn- <lb/> ing the streets and lanes were packed with people <lb/>
waiting to see if this strange thing would indeed <lb/> happen. And happen it did. The governor rode
<lb/> in state, attended by his guards, and the news of it <lb/> went everywhere, and made a great
sensation, and <lb/>
<pb n="115"/> modified the scoffings of the people of quality and <lb/> raised Joan's credit higher
than ever.</p>
<p>The governor had made up his mind to one <lb/> thing: Joan was either a witch or a saint, and he
<lb/> meant to find out which it was. So he brought a <lb/> priest with him to exorcise the devil
that was in her <lb/> in case there was one there. The priest performed <lb/> his office, but found
no devil. He merely hurt <lb/> Joan's feelings and offended her piety without need, <lb/> for he had
already confessed her before this, and <lb/> should have known, if he knew anything, that devils
<lb/> cannot abide the confessional, but utter cries of <lb/> anguish and the most profane and
furious cursings <lb/> whenever they are confronted with that holy office.</p>
<p>The governor went away troubled and full of <lb/> thought, and not knowing what to do. And while
<lb/> he pondered and studied, several days went by and <lb/> the 14th of February was come. Then
Joan went <lb/> to the castle and said:</p>
<p>"In God's name, Robert de Baudricourt, you are <lb/> too slow about sending me, and have caused
damage <lb/> thereby, for this day the Dauphin's cause has lost a <lb/> battle near Orleans, and
will suffer yet greater injury <lb/> if you do not send me to him soon."</p>
<p>The governor was perplexed by this speech, and <lb/> said:</p>
<p>"To-day, child, <i>to-day?</i> How can you know <lb/> what has happened in that region to-day? It
would <lb/> take eight or ten days for the word to come."</p>
<p>"My Voices have brought the word to me, and it <lb/>
<pb n="116"/> is true. A battle was lost to-day, and you are in <lb/> fault to delay me so."</p>
<p>The governor walked the floor a while, talking <lb/> within himself, but letting a great oath
fall outside <lb/> now and then; and finally he said:</p>
<p>"Harkye! go in peace, and wait. If it shall turn <lb/> out as you say, I will give you the letter
and send <lb/> you to the King, and not otherwise."</p>
<p>Joan said with fervor:</p>
<p>"Now God be thanked, these waiting days are <lb/> almost done. In nine days you will fetch me the
<lb/> letter."</p>
<p>Already the people of Vaucouleurs had given her <lb/> a horse and had armed and equipped her as a
<lb/> soldier. She got no chance to try the horse and <lb/> see if she could ride it, for her great
first duty was <lb/> to abide at her post and lift up the hopes and spirits <lb/> of all who would
come to talk with her, and prepare <lb/> them to help in the rescue and regeneration of the <lb/>
kingdom. This occupied every waking moment she <lb/> had. But it was no matter. There was nothing
<lb/> she could not learn&#x2014;and in the briefest time, too. <lb/> Her horse would find this out
in the first hour. <lb/> Meantime the brothers and I took the horse in turn <lb/> and began to learn
to ride. And we had teaching <lb/> in the use of the sword and other arms also.</p>
<p>On the 20th Joan called her small army together <lb/> &#x2014;the two knights and her two
brothers and me&#x2014; <lb/> for a private council of war. No, it was not a <lb/> council, that is
not the right name, for she did not <lb/>
<pb n="117"/> consult with us, she merely gave us orders. She <lb/> mapped out the course she would
travel toward the <lb/> King, and did it like a person perfectly versed in <lb/> geography; and this
itinerary of daily marches was <lb/> so arranged as to avoid here and there peculiarly <lb/>
dangerous regions by flank movements&#x2014;which <lb/> showed that she knew her political geography
as <lb/> intimately as she knew her physical geography; yet <lb/> she had never had a day's
schooling, of course, and <lb/> was without education. I was astonished, but <lb/> thought her
Voices must have taught her. But <lb/> upon reflection I saw that this was not so. By her <lb/>
references to what this and that and the other person <lb/> had told her, I perceived that she had
been diligently <lb/> questioning those crowds of visiting strangers, and <lb/> that out of them she
had patiently dug all this mass <lb/> of invaluable knowledge. The two knights were <lb/> filled
with wonder at her good sense and sagacity.</p>
<p>She commanded us to make preparations to travel <lb/> by night and sleep by day in concealment,
as almost <lb/> the whole of our long journey would be through the <lb/> enemy's country.</p>
<p>Also, she commanded that we should keep the <lb/> date of our departure a secret, since she meant
to <lb/> get away unobserved. Otherwise we should be sent <lb/> off with a grand demonstration which
would adver- <lb/> tise us to the enemy, and we should be ambushed <lb/> and captured somewhere.
Finally she said:</p>
<p>"Nothing remains, now, but that I confide to you <lb/> the date of our departure, so that you may
make all <lb/>
<pb n="118"/> needful preparation in time, leaving nothing to be <lb/> done in haste and badly at
the last moment. We <lb/> march the 23d, at eleven of the clock at night."</p>
<p>Then we were dismissed. The two knights were <lb/> startled&#x2014;yes, and troubled; and the
Sieur Bertrand <lb/> said:</p>
<p>"Even if the governor shall really furnish the <lb/> letter and the escort, he still may not do
it in time <lb/> to meet the date she has chosen. Then how can <lb/> she venture to name that date?
It is a great risk&#x2014; <lb/> a great risk to select and decide upon the date, in <lb/> this
state of uncertainty."</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>"Since she has named the 23d, we may trust her. <lb/> The Voices have told her, I think. We shall
do <lb/> best to obey."</p>
<p>We did obey. Joan's parents were notified to <lb/> come before the 23d, but prudence forbade that
<lb/> they be told why this limit was named.</p>
<p>All day, the 23d, she glanced up wistfully when- <lb/> ever new bodies of strangers entered the
house, but <lb/> her parents did not appear. Still she was not dis- <lb/> couraged, but hoped on.
But when night fell at <lb/> last, her hopes perished, and the tears came; how- <lb/> ever, she
dashed them away, and said:</p>
<p>"It was to be so, no doubt; no doubt it was so <lb/> ordered; I must bear it, and will."</p>
<p>De Metz tried to comfort her by saying:</p>
<p>"The governor sends no word; it may be that <lb/> they will come to-morrow, and&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="119"/>
<p>He got no further, for she interrupted him, say- <lb/> ing:</p>
<p>"To what good end? We start at eleven to- <lb/> night."</p>
<p>And it was so. At ten the governor came, with <lb/> his guard and torch-bearers, and delivered to
her a <lb/> mounted escort of men-at-arms, with horses and <lb/> equipment for me and for the
brothers, and gave <lb/> Joan a letter to the King. Then he took off his <lb/> sword, and belted it
about her waist with his own <lb/> hands, and said:</p>
<p>"You said true, child. The battle <i>was</i> lost, on <lb/> the day you said. So I have kept my
word. Now <lb/> go&#x2014;come of it what may."</p>
<p>Joan gave him thanks, and he went his way.</p>
<p>The lost battle was the famous disaster that is <lb/> called in history the Battle of the
Herrings.</p>
<p>All the lights in the house were at once put out, <lb/> and a little while after, when the
streets had become <lb/> dark and still, we crept stealthily through them and <lb/> out at the
western gate and rode away under whip <lb/> and spur.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="III">
<pb n="120"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER III.</b></head>
<p><smcap>We</smcap> were twenty-five strong, and well equipped. <lb/> We rode in double file, Joan
and her brothers <lb/> in the center of the column, with Jean de Metz at <lb/> the head of it and
the Sieur Bertrand at its extreme <lb/> rear. The knights were so placed to prevent deser- <lb/>
tions&#x2014;for the present. In two or three hours we <lb/> should be in the enemy's country, and
then none <lb/> would venture to desert. By and by we began to <lb/> hear groans and sobs and
execrations from different <lb/> points along the line, and upon inquiry found that <lb/> six of our
men were peasants who had never ridden <lb/> a horse before, and were finding it very difficult to
<lb/> stay in their saddles, and moreover were now begin- <lb/> ning to suffer considerable bodily
torture. They <lb/> had been seized by the governor at the last moment <lb/> and pressed into the
service to make up the tale, <lb/> and he had placed a veteran alongside of each with <lb/> orders
to help him stick to the saddle, and kill him <lb/> if he tried to desert.</p>
<p>These poor devils had kept quiet as long as they <lb/> could, but their physical miseries were
become so <lb/> sharp by this time that they were obliged to give <lb/> them vent. But we were
within the enemy's country <lb/>
<pb n="121"/> now, so there was no help for them, they must con- <lb/> tinue the march, though Joan
said that if they chose <lb/> to take the risk they might depart. They preferred <lb/> to stay with
us. We modified our pace now, and <lb/> moved cautiously, and the new men were warned to <lb/> keep
their sorrows to themselves and not get the <lb/> command into danger with their curses and lamenta-
<lb/> tions.</p>
<p>Toward dawn we rode deep into a forest, and <lb/> soon all but the sentries were sound asleep in
spite <lb/> of the cold ground and the frosty air.</p>
<p>I woke at noon out of such a solid and stupefying <lb/> sleep that at first my wits were all
astray, and I did <lb/> not know where I was nor what had been happen- <lb/> ing. Then my senses
cleared, and I remembered. <lb/> As I lay there thinking over the strange events of <lb/> the past
month or two the thought came into my <lb/> mind, greatly surprising me, that one of Joan's pro-
<lb/> phecies had failed; for where were No&#x00EB;l and the <lb/> Paladin, who were to join us at
the eleventh hour? <lb/> By this time, you see, I had gotten used to expect- <lb/> ing everything
Joan said to come true. So, being <lb/> disturbed and troubled by these thoughts, I opened <lb/> my
eyes. Well, there stood the Paladin leaning <lb/> against a tree and looking down on me! How often
<lb/> that happens; you think of a person, or speak of a <lb/> person, and there he stands before
you, and you not <lb/> dreaming he is near. It looks as if his <i>being</i> near is <lb/> really the
thing that makes you think of him, and <lb/> not just an accident, as people imagine. Well, be <lb/>
<pb n="122"/> that as it may, there was the Paladin, anyway, look- <lb/> ing down in my face and
waiting for me to wake. I <lb/> was ever so glad to see him, and jumped up and <lb/> shook him by
the hand, and led him a little way <lb/> from the camp&#x2014;he limping like a cripple&#x2014;and
<lb/> told him to sit down, and said:</p>
<p>"Now, where have you dropped down from? <lb/> And how did you happen to light in this place?
<lb/> And what do the soldier-clothes mean? Tell me all <lb/> about it."</p>
<p>He answered:</p>
<p>"I marched with you last night."</p>
<p>"No!" (To myself I said, "The prophecy has <lb/> not all failed&#x2014;half of it has come
true.")</p>
<p>"Yes, I did. I hurried up from Domremy to <lb/> join, and was within a half a minute of being too
<lb/> late. In fact, I was too late, but I begged so hard <lb/> that the governor was touched by my
brave devotion <lb/> to my country's cause&#x2014;those are the words he <lb/> used&#x2014;and so he
yielded, and allowed me to come."</p>
<p>I thought to myself, this is a lie, he is one of <lb/> those six the governor recruited by force
at the last <lb/> moment; I know it, for Joan's prophecy said he <lb/> would join at the eleventh
hour, but not by his own <lb/> desire. Then I said aloud:</p>
<p>"I am glad you came; it is a noble cause, and <lb/> one should not sit at home in times like
these."</p>
<p>"Sit at home! I could no more do it than the <lb/> thunderstone could stay hid in the clouds when
the <lb/> storm calls it."</p>
<pb n="123"/>
<p>"That is the right talk. It sounds like you."</p>
<p>That pleased him.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you know me. Some don't. But <lb/> they will, presently. They will know me well <lb/>
enough before I get done with this war."</p>
<p>"That is what I think. I believe that wherever <lb/> danger confronts you you will make yourself
con- <lb/> spicuous."</p>
<p>He was charmed with this speech, and it swelled <lb/> him up like a bladder. He said:</p>
<p>"If I know myself&#x2014;and I think I do&#x2014;my per- <lb/> formances in this campaign will
give you occasion <lb/> more than once to remember those words."</p>
<p>"I were a fool to doubt it. That I know."</p>
<p>"I shall not be at my best, being but a common <lb/> soldier; still, the country will hear of me.
If I were <lb/> where I belong; if I were in the place of La Hire, <lb/> or Saintrailles, or the
Bastard of Orleans&#x2014;well, I <lb/> say nothing, I am not of the talking kind, like No&#x00EB;l
<lb/> Rainguesson and his sort, I thank God. But it will <lb/> be <i>something</i>, I take
it&#x2014;a novelty in this world, I <lb/> should say&#x2014;to raise the fame of a private soldier
<lb/> above theirs, and extinguish the glory of their names <lb/> with its shadow."</p>
<p>"Why, look here, my friend," I said, "do you <lb/> know that you have hit out a most remarkable
idea <lb/> there? Do you realize the gigantic proportions of <lb/> it? For look you; to be a general
of vast renown, <lb/> what is that? Nothing&#x2014;history is clogged and <lb/> confused with them;
one cannot keep their names <lb/>
<pb n="124"/> in his memory, there are so many. But a common <lb/> soldier of supreme
renown&#x2014;why, he would stand <lb/> alone! He would be the one moon in a firmament <lb/> of
mustard-seed stars; his name would outlast the <lb/> human race! My friend, who gave you that
idea?"</p>
<p>He was ready to burst with happiness, but he <lb/> suppressed betrayal of it as well as he could.
He <lb/> simply waived the compliment aside with his hand <lb/> and said, with complacency:</p>
<p>"It is nothing. I have them often&#x2014;ideas like <lb/> that&#x2014;and even greater ones. I do
not consider <lb/> this one much."</p>
<p>"You astonish me; you do, indeed. So it is <lb/> really your own?"</p>
<p>"Quite. And there is plenty more where it came <lb/> from"&#x2014;tapping his head with his
finger, and taking <lb/> occasion at the same time to cant his morion over <lb/> his right ear,
which gave him a very self-satisfied <lb/> air&#x2014;"I do not need to borrow my ideas, like
No&#x00EB;l <lb/> Rainguesson."</p>
<p>"Speaking of No&#x00EB;l, when did you see him last?"</p>
<p>"Half an hour ago. He is sleeping yonder like <lb/> a corpse. Rode with us last night."</p>
<p>I felt a great upleap in my heart, and said to my- <lb/> self, now I am at rest and glad; I will
never doubt <lb/> her prophecies again. Then I said aloud:</p>
<p>"It gives me joy. It makes me proud of our <lb/> village. There is no keeping our lion-hearts at
<lb/> home in these great times, I see that."</p>
<p>"Lion-heart! Who&#x2014;that baby? Why, he <lb/>
<pb n="125"/> begged like a dog to be let off. Cried, and said <lb/> he wanted to go to his mother.
Him a lion-heart! <lb/> &#x2014;that tumble-bug!"</p>
<p>"Dear me, why I supposed he volunteered, of <lb/> course. Didn't he?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, volunteered the way people do to the <lb/> headsman. Why, when he found I was coming up
<lb/> from Domremy to volunteer, he asked me to let him <lb/> come along in my protection, and see
the crowds <lb/> and the excitement. Well, we arrived and saw the <lb/> torches filing out at the
Castle, and ran there, and <lb/> the governor had him seized, along with four more, <lb/> and he
begged to be let off, and I begged for his <lb/> place, and at last the governor allowed me to join,
<lb/> but wouldn't let No&#x00EB;l off, because he was disgusted <lb/> with him he was such a
cry-baby. Yes, and much <lb/> good <i>he'll</i> do the King's service; he'll eat for six <lb/> and
run for sixteen. I hate a pigmy with half a <lb/> heart and nine stomachs!"</p>
<p>"Why, this is very surprising news to me, and I <lb/> am sorry and disappointed to hear it. I
thought he <lb/> was a very manly fellow."</p>
<p>The Paladin gave me an outraged look, and said:</p>
<p>"I don't see how you can talk like that, I'm sure <lb/> I don't. I don't see how you could have
got such <lb/> a notion. I don't dislike him, and I'm not saying <lb/> these things out of
prejudice, for I don't allow my- <lb/> self to have prejudices against people. I like him, <lb/> and
have always comraded with him from the cradle, <lb/> but he must allow me to speak my mind about <lb/>
<pb n="126"/> his faults, and I am willing he shall speak his <lb/> about mine, if I have any. And,
true enough, <lb/> maybe I have; but I reckon they'll bear inspection <lb/> &#x2014;I have that
idea, anyway. A manly fellow! You <lb/> should have heard him whine and wail and swear, <lb/> last
night, because the saddle hurt him. Why didn't <lb/> the saddle hurt me? Pooh&#x2014;I was as much
at home <lb/> in it as if I had been born there. And yet it was <lb/> the first time I was ever on a
horse. All those old <lb/> soldiers admired my riding; they said they had <lb/> never seen anything
like it. But him&#x2014;why, they <lb/> had to hold him on, all the time."</p>
<p>An odor as of breakfast came stealing through the <lb/> wood; the Paladin unconsciously inflated
his nostrils <lb/> in lustful response, and got up and limped painfully <lb/> away, saying he must
go and look to his horse.</p>
<p>At bottom he was all right and a good-hearted <lb/> giant, without any harm in him, for it is no
harm to <lb/> bark, if one stops there and does not bite, and it is <lb/> no harm to be an ass, if
one is content to bray and <lb/> not kick. If this vast structure of brawn, and <lb/> muscle and
vanity and foolishness seemed to have <lb/> a libelous tongue, what of it? There was no malice <lb/>
behind it; and besides, the defect was not of his <lb/> own creation; it was the work of No&#x00EB;l
Rainguesson, <lb/> who had nurtured it, fostered it, built it up and per- <lb/> fected it, for the
entertainment he got out of it. <lb/> His careless light heart had to have somebody to <lb/> nag and
chaff and make fun of, the Paladin had only <lb/> needed development in order to meet its require- <lb/>
<pb n="127"/> ments, consequently the development was taken in <lb/> hand and diligently attended to
and looked after, <lb/> gnat-and-bull fashion, for years, to the neglect and <lb/> damage of far
more important concerns. The re- <lb/> sult was an unqualified success. No&#x00EB;l prized the <lb/>
society of the Paladin above everybody else's; the <lb/> Paladin preferred anybody's to
No&#x00EB;l's. The big <lb/> fellow was often seen with the little fellow, but it <lb/> was for the
same reason that the bull is often seen <lb/> with the gnat.</p>
<p>With the first opportunity, I had a talk with No&#x00EB;l. <lb/> I welcomed him to our
expedition, and said:</p>
<p>"It was fine and brave of you to volunteer, No&#x00EB;l."</p>
<p>His eye twinkled, and he answered:</p>
<p>"Yes, it was rather fine, I think. Still, the credit <lb/> doesn't all belong to me; I had
help."</p>
<p>"Who helped you?"</p>
<p>"The governor."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"Well, I'll tell you the whole thing. I came up <lb/> from Domremy to see the crowds and the
general <lb/> show, for I hadn't ever had any experience of such <lb/> things, of course, and this
was a great opportunity; <lb/> but I hadn't any mind to volunteer. I overtook the <lb/> Paladin on
the road and let him have my company <lb/> the rest of the way, although he did not want it and
<lb/> said so; and while we were gawking and blinking in <lb/> the glare of the governor's torches
they seized us <lb/> and four more and added us to the escort, and that <lb/> is really how I came
to volunteer. But, after all, I <lb/>
<pb n="128"/> wasn't sorry, remembering how dull life would have <lb/> been in the village without
the Paladin."</p>
<p>"How did he feel about it? Was he satisfied?"</p>
<p>"I think he was glad."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because he said he wasn't. He was taken by <lb/> surprise, you see, and it is not likely that he
could <lb/> tell the truth without preparation. Not that he <lb/> would have prepared, if he had had
the chance, for <lb/> I do not think he would. I am not charging him <lb/> with that. In the same
space of time that he could <lb/> prepare to speak the truth, he could also prepare to <lb/> lie;
besides, his judgment would be cool then, and <lb/> would warn him against fooling with new methods
<lb/> in an emergency. No, I am sure he was glad, be- <lb/> cause he said he wasn't."</p>
<p>"Do you think he was very glad?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know he was. He begged like a slave, <lb/> and bawled for his mother. He said his health
was <lb/> delicate, and he didn't know how to ride a horse, <lb/> and he knew he couldn't outlive
the first march. <lb/> But really he wasn't looking as delicate as he was <lb/> feeling. There was a
cask of wine there, a proper <lb/> lift for four men. The governor's temper got afire, <lb/> and he
delivered an oath at him that knocked up the <lb/> dust where it struck the ground, and told him to
<lb/> shoulder that cask or he would carve him to cutlets <lb/> and send him home in a basket. The
Paladin did it, <lb/> and that secured his promotion to a privacy in the <lb/> escort without any
further debate."</p>
<pb n="129"/>
<p>"Yes, you seem to make it quite plain that he <lb/> was glad to join&#x2014;that is, if your
premises are right <lb/> that you start from. How did he stand the march <lb/> last night?"</p>
<p>"About as I did. If he made the more noise, it <lb/> was the privilege of his bulk. We stayed in
our <lb/> saddles because we had help. We are equally lame <lb/> to-day, and if he likes to sit
down, let him; I prefer <lb/> to stand."</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="IV">
<pb n="130"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER IV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>We</smcap> were called to quarters and subjected to a <lb/> searching inspection by Joan.
Then she <lb/> made a short little talk in which she said that even <lb/> the rude business of war
could be conducted better <lb/> without profanity and other brutalities of speech <lb/> than with
them, and that she should strictly require <lb/> us to remember and apply this admonition. She <lb/>
ordered half an hour's horsemanship-drill for the <lb/> novices then, and appointed one of the
veterans to <lb/> conduct it. It was a ridiculous exhibition, but we <lb/> learned something, and
Joan was satisfied and com- <lb/> plimented us. She did not take any instruction her- <lb/> self or
go through the evolutions and man&#x0153;uvres, but <lb/> merely sat her horse like a martial little
statue and <lb/> looked on. That was sufficient for her, you see. <lb/> She would not miss or forget
a detail of the lesson, <lb/> she would take it all in with her eye and her mind, <lb/> and apply it
afterward with as much certainty and <lb/> confidence as if she had already practiced it.</p>
<p>We now made three night-marches of twelve or <lb/> thirteen leagues each, riding in peace and
undis- <lb/> turbed, being taken for a roving band of Free Com- <lb/>
<pb n="131"/> panions. Country folk were glad to have that sort <lb/> of people go by without
stopping. Still, they were <lb/> very wearing marches, and not comfortable, for the <lb/> bridges
were few and the streams many, and as we <lb/> had to ford them we found the water dismally cold,
<lb/> and afterward had to bed ourselves, still wet, on the <lb/> frosty or snowy ground, and get
warm as we might <lb/> and sleep if we could, for it would not have been <lb/> prudent to build
fires. Our energies languished <lb/> under these hardships and deadly fatigues, but <lb/> Joan's did
not. Her step kept its spring and firm- <lb/> ness and her eye its fire. We could only wonder at
<lb/> this, we could not explain it.</p>
<p>But if we had had hard times before, I know not <lb/> what to call the five nights that now
followed, for <lb/> the marches were as fatiguing, the baths as cold, and <lb/> we were ambuscaded
seven times in addition, and <lb/> lost two novices and three veterans in the resulting <lb/>
fights. The news had leaked out and gone abroad <lb/> that the inspired Virgin of Vaucouleurs was
making <lb/> for the King with an escort, and all the roads were <lb/> being watched now.</p>
<p>These five nights disheartened the command a <lb/> good deal. This was aggravated by a discovery
<lb/> which No&#x00EB;l made, and which he promptly made <lb/> known at headquarters. Some of the
men had been <lb/> trying to understand why Joan continued to be <lb/> alert, vigorous, and
confident while the strongest <lb/> men in the company were fagged with the heavy <lb/> marches and
exposure and were become morose and <lb/>
<pb n="132"/> irritable. There, it shows you how men can have <lb/> eyes and yet not see. All their
lives those men had <lb/> seen their own womenfolks hitched up with a cow <lb/> and dragging the
plow in the fields while the men <lb/> did the driving. They had also seen other evidences <lb/>
that women have far more endurance and patience <lb/> and fortitude than men&#x2014;but what good
had their <lb/> seeing these things been to them? None. It had <lb/> taught them nothing. They were
still surprised to <lb/> see a girl of seventeen bear the fatigues of war better <lb/> than trained
veterans of the army. Moreover, they <lb/> did not reflect that a great soul, with a great pur-
<lb/> pose, can make a weak body strong and keep it so; <lb/> and here was the greatest soul in the
universe; but <lb/> how could they know that, those dumb creatures? <lb/> No, they knew nothing, and
their reasonings were <lb/> of a piece with their ignorance. They argued and <lb/> discussed among
themselves, with No&#x00EB;l listening, <lb/> and arrived at the decision that Joan was a witch,
<lb/> and had her strange pluck and strength from Satan; <lb/> so they made a plan to watch for a
safe opportunity <lb/> and take her life.</p>
<p>To have secret plottings of this sort going on in <lb/> our midst was a very serious business, of
course, <lb/> and the knights asked Joan's permission to hang the <lb/> plotters, but she refused
without hesitancy. She <lb/> said:</p>
<p>"Neither these men nor any others can take my <lb/> life before my mission is accomplished,
therefore <lb/> why should I have their blood upon my hands? I <lb/>
<pb n="133"/> will inform them of this, and also admonish them. <lb/> Call them before me."</p>
<p>When they came she made that statement to them <lb/> in a plain matter-of-fact way, and just as
if the <lb/> thought never entered her mind that any one could <lb/> doubt it after she had given
her word that it was <lb/> true. The men were evidently amazed and im- <lb/> pressed to hear her say
such a thing in such a sure <lb/> and confident way, for prophecies boldly uttered <lb/> never fall
barren on superstitious ears. Yes, this <lb/> speech certainly impressed them, but her closing <lb/>
remark impressed them still more. It was for the <lb/> ringleader, and Joan said it sorrowfully:</p>
<p>"It is a pity that you should plot another's death <lb/> when your own is so close at hand."</p>
<p>That man's horse stumbled and fell on him in the <lb/> first ford which we crossed that night,
and he was <lb/> drowned before we could help him. We had no <lb/> more conspiracies.</p>
<p>This night was harassed with ambuscades, but we <lb/> got through without having any men killed.
One <lb/> more night would carry us over the hostile frontier if <lb/> we had good luck, and we saw
the night close down <lb/> with a good deal of solicitude. Always before, we <lb/> had been more or
less reluctant to start out into the <lb/> gloom and the silence to be frozen in the fords and <lb/>
persecuted by the enemy, but this time we were im- <lb/> patient to get under way and have it over,
although <lb/> there was promise of more and harder fighting than <lb/> any of the previous nights
had furnished. More- <lb/>
<pb n="134"/> over, in front of us about three leagues there was <lb/> a deep stream with a frail
wooden bridge over it, <lb/> and as a cold rain mixed with snow had been falling <lb/> steadily all
day we were anxious to find out whether <lb/> we were in a trap or not. If the swollen stream <lb/>
had washed away the bridge, we might properly <lb/> consider ourselves trapped and cut off from
escape.</p>
<p>As soon as it was dark we filed out from the <lb/> depths of the forest where we had been hidden
and <lb/> began the march. From the time that we had begun <lb/> to encounter ambushes Joan had
ridden at the head <lb/> of the column, and she took this post now. By the <lb/> time we had gone a
league the rain and snow had <lb/> turned to sleet, and under the impulse of the storm- <lb/> wind
it lashed my face like whips, and I envied Joan <lb/> and the knights, who could close their visors
and <lb/> shut up their heads in their helmets as in a box. <lb/> Now, out of the pitchy darkness
and close at hand, <lb/> came the sharp command:</p>
<p>"Halt!"</p>
<p>We obeyed. I made out a dim mass in front of <lb/> us which might be a body of horsemen, but one
<lb/> could not be sure. A man rode up and said to <lb/> Joan in a tone of reproof:</p>
<p>"Well, you have taken your time, truly. And <lb/> what have you found out? Is she still behind
us, <lb/> or in front?"</p>
<p>Joan answered in a level voice:</p>
<p>"She is still behind."</p>
<p>This news softened the stranger's tone. He said:</p>
<pb n="135"/>
<p>"If you know that to be true, you have not lost <lb/> your time, Captain. But are you sure? How
do <lb/> you know?"</p>
<p>"Because I have seen her."</p>
<p>"Seen her! Seen the Virgin herself?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I have been in her camp."</p>
<p>"Is it possible! Captain Raymond, I ask you <lb/> to pardon me for speaking in that tone just
now. <lb/> You have performed a daring and admirable service. <lb/> Where was she camped?"</p>
<p>"In the forest, not more than a league from <lb/> here."</p>
<p>"Good! I was afraid we might be still behind <lb/> her, but now that we know she is behind us,
every- <lb/> thing is safe. She is our game. We will hang her. <lb/> You shall hang her yourself. No
one has so well <lb/> earned the privilege of abolishing this pestilent limb <lb/> of Satan."</p>
<p>"I do not know how to thank you sufficiently. <lb/> If we catch her, I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"If! I will take care of that; give yourself no <lb/> uneasiness. All I want is just a look at
her, to see <lb/> what the imp is like that has been able to make all <lb/> this noise, then you and
the halter may have her. <lb/> How many men has she?"</p>
<p>"I counted but eighteen, but she may have had <lb/> two or three pickets out."</p>
<p>"Is that all? It won't be a mouthful for my <lb/> force. Is it true that she is only a girl?"</p>
<p>"Yes; she is not more than seventeen."</p>
<pb n="136"/>
<p>"It passes belief! Is she robust, or slender?"</p>
<p>"Slender."</p>
<p>The officer pondered a moment or two, then he <lb/> said:</p>
<p>"Was she preparing to break camp?"</p>
<p>"Not when I had my last glimpse of her."</p>
<p>"What was she doing?"</p>
<p>"She was talking quietly with an officer."</p>
<p>"Quietly? Not giving orders?"</p>
<p>"No, talking as quietly as we are now."</p>
<p>"That is good. She is feeling a false security. <lb/> She would have been restless and fussy
else&#x2014;it is <lb/> the way of her sex when danger is about. As she <lb/> was making no
preparation to break camp&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"She certainly was not when I saw her last."</p>
<p>"&#x2014;and was chatting quietly and at her ease, it <lb/> means that this weather is not to her
taste. Night- <lb/> marching in sleet and wind is not for chits of seven- <lb/> teen. No; she will
stay where she is. She has my <lb/> thanks. We will camp, ourselves; here is as good a <lb/> place
as any. Let us get about it."</p>
<p>"If you command it&#x2014;certainly. But she has <lb/> two knights with her. They might force her
to <lb/> march, particularly if the weather should improve."</p>
<p>I was scared, and impatient to be getting out of <lb/> this peril, and it distressed and worried
me to have <lb/> Joan apparently set herself to work to make delay <lb/> and increase the
danger&#x2014;still, I thought she prob- <lb/> ably knew better than I what to do. The officer <lb/>
said:</p>
<pb n="137"/>
<p>"Well, in that case we are here to block the <lb/> way."</p>
<p>"Yes, if they come this way. But if they should <lb/> send out spies, and find out enough to make
them <lb/> want to try for the bridge through the woods? Is <lb/> it best to allow the bridge to
stand?"</p>
<p>It made me shiver to hear her.</p>
<p>The officer considered a while, then said:</p>
<p>"It might be well enough to send a force to <lb/> destroy the bridge. I was intending to occupy
it with <lb/> the whole command, but that is not necessary now."</p>
<p>Joan said, tranquilly:</p>
<p>"With your permission, I will go and destroy it <lb/> myself."</p>
<p>Ah, now I saw her idea, and was glad she had <lb/> had the cleverness to invent it and the
ability to keep <lb/> her head cool and think of it in that tight place. <lb/> The officer
replied:</p>
<p>"You have it, Captain, and my thanks. With <lb/> you to do it, it will be well done; I could send
<lb/> another in your place, but not a better."</p>
<p>They saluted, and we moved forward. I breathed <lb/> freer. A dozen times I had imagined I heard
the <lb/> hoof-beats of the real Captain Raymond's troop <lb/> arriving behind us, and had been
sitting on pins and <lb/> needles all the while that that conversation was <lb/> dragging along. I
breathed freer, but was still not <lb/> comfortable, for Joan had given only the simple <lb/>
command, "Forward!" Consequently we moved <lb/> in a walk. Moved in a dead walk past a dim and <lb/>
<pb n="138"/> lengthening column of enemies at our side. The <lb/> suspense was exhausting, yet it
lasted but a short <lb/> while, for when the enemy's bugles sang the "Dis- <lb/> mount!" Joan gave
the word to trot, and that was <lb/> a great relief to me. She was always at herself, you <lb/> see.
Before the command to dismount had been <lb/> given, somebody might have wanted the countersign
<lb/> somewhere along that line if we came flying by at <lb/> speed, but now we seemed to be on our
way to our <lb/> allotted camping position, so we were allowed to <lb/> pass unchallenged. The
further we went the more <lb/> formidable was the strength revealed by the hostile <lb/> force.
Perhaps it was only a hundred or two, but <lb/> to me it seemed a thousand. When we passed the <lb/>
last of these people I was thankful, and the deeper <lb/> we plowed into the darkness beyond them
the better <lb/> I felt. I came nearer and nearer to feeling good, <lb/> for an hour; then we found
the bridge still stand- <lb/> ing, and I felt entirely good. We crossed it and <lb/> destroyed it,
and then I felt&#x2014;but I cannot describe <lb/> what I felt. One has to feel it himself in order
to <lb/> know what it is like.</p>
<p>We had expected to hear the rush of a pursuing <lb/> force behind us, for we thought that the
real Cap- <lb/> tain Raymond would arrive and suggest that perhaps <lb/> the troop that had been
mistaken for his belonged <lb/> to the Virgin of Vaucouleurs; but he must have <lb/> been delayed
seriously, for when we resumed our <lb/> march beyond the river there were no sounds behind <lb/> us
except those which the storm was furnishing.</p>
<pb n="139"/>
<p>I said that Joan had harvested a good many com- <lb/> pliments intended for Captain Raymond, and
that <lb/> he would find nothing of a crop left but a dry stub- <lb/> ble of reprimands when he got
back, and a com- <lb/> mander just in the humor to superintend the gather- <lb/> ing of it in.</p>
<p>Joan said:</p>
<p>"It will be as you say, no doubt; for the com- <lb/> mander took a troop for granted, in the
night and <lb/> unchallenged, and would have camped without send- <lb/> ing a force to destroy the
bridge if he had been left <lb/> unadvised, and none are so ready to find fault with <lb/> others as
those who do things worthy of blame <lb/> themselves."</p>
<p>The Sieur Bertrand was amused at Joan's na&#x00EF;ve <lb/> way of referring to her advice as if
it had been a <lb/> valuable present to a hostile leader who was saved <lb/> by it from making a
censurable blunder of omission, <lb/> and then he went on to admire how ingeniously she <lb/> had
deceived that man and yet had not told him <lb/> anything that was not the truth. This troubled
<lb/> Joan, and she said:</p>
<p>"I thought he was deceiving himself. I forbore <lb/> to tell him lies, for that would have been
wrong; <lb/> but if my truths deceived him, perhaps that made <lb/> them lies, and I am to blame. I
would God I knew <lb/> if I have done wrong."</p>
<p>She was assured that she had done right, and that <lb/> in the perils and necessities of war
deceptions that <lb/> help one's own cause and hurt the enemy's were <pb n="140"/> always
permissible; but she was not quite satisfied <lb/> with that, and thought that even when a great
cause <lb/> was in danger one ought to have the privilege of <lb/> trying honorable ways first. Jean
said:</p>
<p>"Joan, you told us yourself that you were going <lb/> to Uncle Laxart's to nurse his wife, but
you didn't <lb/> say you were going further, yet you did go on to <lb/> Vaucouleurs. There!"</p>
<p>"I see now," said Joan, sorrowfully, "I told no <lb/> lie, yet I deceived. I had tried all other
ways first, <lb/> but I could not get away, and I <i>had</i> to get away. <lb/> My mission required
it. I did wrong, I think, and <lb/> am to blame."</p>
<p>She was silent a moment, turning the matter over <lb/> in her mind, then she added, with quiet
decision, <lb/> "But the thing itself was right, and I would do it <lb/> again."</p>
<p>It seemed an over-nice distinction, but nobody <lb/> said anything. If we had known her as well
as she <lb/> knew herself, and as her later history revealed her <lb/> to us, we should have
perceived that she had a clear <lb/> meaning there, and that her position was not iden- <lb/> tical
with ours, as we were supposing, but occupied <lb/> a higher plane. She would sacrifice
herself&#x2014;and <lb/> her <i>best</i> self; that is, her truthfulness&#x2014;to save her <lb/>
cause; but only that; she would not buy her <i>life</i> at <lb/> that cost; whereas our war-ethics
permitted the pur- <lb/> chase of our lives, or any mere military advantage, <lb/> small or great,
by deception. Her saying seemed a <lb/> commonplace at that time, the essence of its mean- <lb/>
<pb n="141"/> ing escaping us; but one sees now that it contained <lb/> a principle which lifted it
above that and made it <lb/> great and fine.</p>
<p>Presently the wind died down, the sleet stopped <lb/> falling, and the cold was less severe. The
road was <lb/> become a bog, and the horses labored through it at <lb/> a walk&#x2014;they could do
no better. As the heavy <lb/> time wore on, exhaustion overcame us, and we slept <lb/> in our
saddles. Not even the dangers that threat- <lb/> ened us could keep us awake.</p>
<p>This tenth night seemed longer than any of the <lb/> others, and of course it was the hardest,
because we <lb/> had been accumulating fatigue from the beginning, <lb/> and had more of it on hand
now than at any pre- <lb/> vious time. But we were not molested again. <lb/> When the dull dawn came
at last we saw a river <lb/> before us and we knew it was the Loire; we entered <lb/> the town of
Gien, and knew we were in a friendly <lb/> land, with the hostiles all behind us. That was a <lb/>
glad morning for us.</p>
<p>We were a worn and bedraggled and shabby- <lb/> looking troop; and still, as always, Joan was the
<lb/> freshest of us all, in both body and spirits. We <lb/> had averaged above thirteen leagues a
night, by <lb/> tortuous and wretched roads. It was a remarkable <lb/> march, and shows what men can
do when they have <lb/> a leader with a determined purpose and a resolution <lb/> that never
flags.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="V">
<pb n="142"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER V.</b></head>
<p><smcap>We</smcap> rested and otherwise refreshed ourselves two <lb/> or three hours at Gien, but
by that time the <lb/> news was abroad that the young girl commissioned <lb/> of God to deliver
France was come; wherefore, such <lb/> a press of people flocked to our quarters to get sight <lb/>
of her that it seemed best to seek a quieter place; <lb/> so we pushed on and halted at a small
village called <lb/> Fierbois.</p>
<p>We were now within six leagues of the King, <lb/> who was at the Castle of Chinon. Joan dictated
a <lb/> letter to him at once, and I wrote it. In it she said <lb/> she had come a hundred and fifty
leagues to bring <lb/> him good news, and begged the privilege of deliver- <lb/> ing it in person.
She added that although she had <lb/> never seen him she would know him in any disguise <lb/> and
would point him out.</p>
<p>The two knights rode away at once with the letter. <lb/> The troop slept all the afternoon, and
after supper <lb/> we felt pretty fresh and fine, especially our little <lb/> group of young
Domremians. We had the com- <lb/> fortable tap-room of the village inn to ourselves, <lb/> and for
the first time in ten unspeakably long days <lb/>
<pb n="143"/> were exempt from bodings and terrors and hard- <lb/> ships and fatiguing labors. The
Paladin was sud- <lb/> denly become his ancient self again, and was swag- <lb/> gering up and down,
a very monument of self- <lb/> complacency. No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson said:</p>
<p>"I think it is wonderful, the way he has brought <lb/> us through."</p>
<p>"Who?" asked Jean.</p>
<p>"Why, the Paladin."</p>
<p>The Paladin seemed not to hear.</p>
<p>"What had he to do with it?" asked Pierre <lb/> d'Arc.</p>
<p>"Everything. It was nothing but Joan's confi- <lb/> dence in his discretion that enabled her to
keep up <lb/> her heart. She could depend on us and on herself <lb/> for valor, but discretion is
the winning thing in war, <lb/> after all; discretion is the rarest and loftiest of <lb/> qualities,
and he has got more of it than any other <lb/> man in France&#x2014;more of it, perhaps, than any
<lb/> other sixty men in France."</p>
<p>"Now you are getting ready to make a fool <lb/> of yourself, No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson," said the
Paladin, <lb/> "and you want to coil some of that long tongue of <lb/> yours around your neck and
stick the end of it in <lb/> your ear, then you'll be the less likely to get into <lb/>
trouble."</p>
<p>"I didn't know he had more discretion than <lb/> other people," said Pierre, "for discretion
argues <lb/> brains, and he hasn't any more brains than the rest <lb/> of us, in my opinion."</p>
<pb n="144"/>
<p>"No, you are wrong there. Discretion hasn't <lb/> anything to do with brains; brains are an
obstruc- <lb/> tion to it, for it does not reason, it feels. Perfect <lb/> discretion means absence
of brains. Discretion is a <lb/> quality of the heart&#x2014;solely a quality of the heart; <lb/> it
acts upon us through feeling. We know this be- <lb/> cause if it were an intellectual quality it
would only <lb/> perceive a danger, for instance, where a danger <lb/> exists; whereas&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Hear him twaddle&#x2014;the damned idiot!" mut- <lb/> tered the Paladin.</p>
<p>"&#x2014;whereas, it being purely a quality of the <lb/> heart, and proceeding by feeling, not
reason, its <lb/> reach is correspondingly wider and sublimer, en- <lb/> abling it to perceive and
avoid dangers that haven't <lb/> any existence at all; as, for instance, that night in <lb/> the
fog, when the Paladin took his horse's ears for <lb/> hostile lances and got off and climbed a
tree&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"It's a lie! a lie without shadow of foundation, <lb/> and I call upon you all to beware how you
give <lb/> credence to the malicious inventions of this ram- <lb/> shackle slander-mill that has
been doing its best to <lb/> destroy my character for years, and will grind up <lb/> your own
reputations for you next. I got off to <lb/> tighten my saddle-girth&#x2014;I wish I may die in my
<lb/> tracks if it isn't so&#x2014;and whoever wants to believe <lb/> it can, and whoever don't can
let it alone."</p>
<p>"There, that is the way with him, you see; he <lb/> never can discuss a theme temperately, but
always <lb/> flies off the handle and becomes disagreeable. And <lb/>
<pb n="145"/> you notice his defect of memory. He remembers <lb/> getting off his horse, but forgets
all the rest, even <lb/> the tree. But that is natural; he would remember <lb/> getting off the
horse because he was so used to <lb/> doing it. He always did it when there was an alarm <lb/> and
the clash of arms at the front."</p>
<p>"Why did he choose that time for it?" asked <lb/> Jean.</p>
<p>"I don't know. To tighten up his girth, <i>he</i>
<lb/> thinks, to climb a tree, <i>I</i> think; I saw him climb <lb/> nine trees in a single
night."</p>
<p>"You saw nothing of the kind! A person that <lb/> can lie like that deserves no one's respect. I
ask <lb/> you all to answer me. Do you believe what this <lb/> reptile has said?"</p>
<p>All seemed embarrassed, and only Pierre replied. <lb/> He said, hesitatingly:</p>
<p>"I&#x2014;well, I hardly know what to say. It is a <lb/> delicate situation. It seems offensive
to refuse to <lb/> believe a person when he makes so direct a state- <lb/> ment, and yet I am
obliged to say, rude as it may <lb/> appear, that I am not able to believe the whole of it <lb/>
&#x2014;no, I am not able to believe that you climbed <lb/> nine trees."</p>
<p>"There!" cried the Paladin; "now what do you <lb/> think of yourself, No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson?
How many <lb/> do you believe I climbed, Pierre?"</p>
<p>"Only eight."</p>
<p>The laughter that followed inflamed the Paladin's <lb/> anger to white heat, and he said:</p>
<pb n="146"/>
<p>"I bide my time&#x2014;I bide my time. I will reckon <lb/> with you all, I promise you that!"</p>
<p>"Don't get him started," No&#x00EB;l pleaded; "he is <lb/> a perfect lion when he gets started. I
saw enough <lb/> to teach me that, after the third skirmish. After it <lb/> was over I saw him come
out of the bushes and <lb/> attack a dead man single-handed."</p>
<p>"It is another lie; and I give you fair warning <lb/> that you are going too far. You will see me
attack <lb/> a live one if you are not careful."</p>
<p>"Meaning me, of course. This wounds me more <lb/> than any number of injurious and unkind
speeches <lb/> could do. Ingratitude to one's benefactor&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Benefactor? What do I owe you, I should like <lb/> to know?"</p>
<p>"You owe me your life. I stood between the <lb/> trees and the foe, and kept hundreds and
thousands <lb/> of the enemy at bay when they were thirsting for <lb/> your blood. And I did not do
it to display my <lb/> daring, I did it because I loved you and could not <lb/> live without
you."</p>
<p>"There&#x2014;you have said enough! I will not stay <lb/> here to listen to these infamies. I can
endure your <lb/> lies, but not your love. Keep that corruption for <lb/> somebody with a stronger
stomach than mine. And <lb/> I want to say this, before I go. That you people's <lb/> small
performances might appear the better and win <lb/> you the more glory, I hid my own deeds through
<lb/> all the march. I went always to the front, where <lb/> the fighting was thickest, to be remote
from you, in <lb/>
<pb n="147"/> order that you might not see and be discouraged by <lb/> the things I did to the
enemy. It was my purpose <lb/> to keep this a secret in my own breast, but you <lb/> force me to
reveal it. If you ask for my witnesses, <lb/> yonder they lie, on the road we have come. I found
<lb/> that road mud, I paved it with corpses. I found <lb/> that country sterile, I fertilized it
with blood. Time <lb/> and again I was urged to go to the rear because the <lb/> command could not
proceed on account of my dead. <lb/> And yet you, you miscreant, accuse me of climbing <lb/> trees!
Pah!"</p>
<p>And he strode out, with a lofty air, for the recital <lb/> of his imaginary deeds had already set
him up again <lb/> and made him feel good.</p>
<p>Next day we mounted and faced toward Chinon. <lb/> Orleans was at our back now, and close by,
lying in <lb/> the strangling grip of the English; soon, please <lb/> God, we would face about and
go to their relief. <lb/> From Gien the news had spread to Orleans that the <lb/> peasant Maid of
Vaucouleurs was on her way, <lb/> divinely commissioned to raise the siege. The news <lb/> made a
great excitement and raised a great hope&#x2014; <lb/> the first breath of hope those poor souls had
<lb/> breathed in five months. They sent commissioners <lb/> at once to the King to beg him to
consider this <lb/> matter, and not throw this help lightly away. These <lb/> commissioners were
already at Chinon by this <lb/> time.</p>
<p>When we were half way to Chinon we happened <lb/> upon yet one more squad of enemies. They burst <lb/>
<pb n="148"/> suddenly out of the woods, and in considerable <lb/> force, too; but we were not the
apprentices we were <lb/> ten or twelve days before; no, we were seasoned to <lb/> this kind of
adventure now; our hearts did not jump <lb/> into our throats and our weapons tremble in our <lb/>
hands. We had learned to be always in battle array, <lb/> always alert, and always ready to deal
with any <lb/> emergency that might turn up. We were no more <lb/> dismayed by the sight of those
people than our <lb/> commander was. Before they could form, Joan had <lb/> delivered the order,
"Forward!" and we were down <lb/> upon them with a rush. They stood no chance; <lb/> they turned
tail and scattered, we plowing through <lb/> them as if they had been men of straw. That was <lb/>
our last ambuscade, and it was probably laid for us <lb/> by that treacherous rascal, the King's own
minister <lb/> and favorite, De la Tremouille.</p>
<p>We housed ourselves in an inn, and soon the <lb/> town came flocking to get a glimpse of the
Maid.</p>
<p>Ah, the tedious King and his tedious people! <lb/> Our two good knights came presently, their
patience <lb/> well wearied, and reported. They and we reverently <lb/> stood&#x2014;as becomes
persons who are in the presence <lb/> of kings and the superiors of kings&#x2014;until Joan, <lb/>
troubled by this mark of homage and respect, and <lb/> not content with it nor yet used to it,
although we <lb/> had not permitted ourselves to do otherwise since <lb/> the day she prophesied
that wretched traitor's death <lb/> and he was straightway drowned, thus confirming <lb/> many
previous signs that she was indeed an am- <lb/>
<pb n="149"/> bassador commissioned of God, commanded us to <lb/> sit; then the Sieur de Metz said
to Joan:</p>
<p>"The King has got the letter, but they will not <lb/> let us have speech with him."</p>
<p>"Who is it that forbids?"</p>
<p>"None forbids, but there be three or four that <lb/> are nearest his person&#x2014;schemers and
traitors every <lb/> one&#x2014;that put obstructions in the way, and seek all <lb/> ways, by lies
and pretexts, to make delay. Chiefest <lb/> of these are Georges de la Tremouille and that plot-
<lb/> ting fox, the Archbishop of Rheims. While they <lb/> keep the King idle and in bondage to his
sports and <lb/> follies, they are great and their importance grows; <lb/> whereas if ever he assert
himself and rise and strike <lb/> for crown and country like a man, their reign is <lb/> done. So
they but thrive, they care not if the <lb/> crown go to destruction and the King with it."</p>
<p>"You have spoken with others besides these?"</p>
<p>"Not of the Court, no&#x2014;the Court are the meek <lb/> slaves of those reptiles, and watch
their mouths and <lb/> their actions, acting as they act, thinking as they <lb/> think, saying as
they say: wherefore they are cold <lb/> to us, and turn aside and go another way when we <lb/>
appear. But we have spoken with the commission- <lb/> ers from Orleans. They said with heat: 'It is
a <lb/> marvel that any man in such desperate case as is <lb/> the King can moon around in this
torpid way, and <lb/> see his all go to ruin without lifting a finger to stay <lb/> the disaster.
What a most strange spectacle it is! <lb/> Here he is, shut up in this wee corner of the realm <lb/>
<pb n="150"/> like a rat in a trap; his royal shelter this huge <lb/> gloomy tomb of a castle, with
wormy rags for up- <lb/> holstery and crippled furniture for use, a very house <lb/> of desolation;
in his treasury forty francs, and not a <lb/> farthing more, God be witness! no army, nor any <lb/>
shadow of one; and by contrast with this hungry <lb/> poverty you behold this crownless pauper and
his <lb/> shoals of fools and favorites tricked out in the <lb/> gaudiest silks and velvets you
shall find in any <lb/> Court in Christendom. And look you, he knows <lb/> that when our city
falls&#x2014;as fall it surely will ex- <lb/> cept succor come swiftly&#x2014;<i>France</i> falls;
he knows <lb/> that when that day comes he will be an outlaw and a <lb/> fugitive, and that behind
him the English flag will <lb/> float unchallenged over every acre of his great <lb/> heritage; he
knows these things, he knows that our <lb/> faithful city is fighting all solitary and alone against
<lb/> disease, starvation, and the sword to stay this awful <lb/> calamity, yet he will not strike
one blow to save her, <lb/> he will not hear our prayers, he will not even look <lb/> upon our
faces.' That is what the commissioners <lb/> said, and they are in despair."</p>
<p>Joan said, gently:</p>
<p>"It is pity, but they must not despair. The <lb/> Dauphin will hear them presently. Tell them
so."</p>
<p>She almost always called the King the Dauphin. <lb/> To her mind he was not King yet, not being
<lb/> crowned.</p>
<p>"We will tell them so, and it will content them, <lb/> for they believe you come from God. The
Arch- <lb/>
<pb n="151"/> bishop and his confederate have for backer that <lb/> veteran soldier Raoul de
Gaucourt, Grand Master of <lb/> the Palace, a worthy man, but simply a soldier, with <lb/> no head
for any greater matter. He cannot make <lb/> out to see how a country girl, ignorant of war, can
<lb/> take a sword in her small hand and win victories <lb/> where the trained generals of France
have looked <lb/> for defeats only, for fifty years&#x2014;and always found <lb/> them. And so he
lifts his frosty mustache and <lb/> scoffs."</p>
<p>"When God fights it is but small matter whether <lb/> the hand that bears His sword is big or
little. He <lb/> will perceive this in time. Is there none in that Cas- <lb/> tle of Chinon who
favors us?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the King's mother-in-law, Yolande, Queen <lb/> of Sicily, who is wise and good. She spoke
with <lb/> the Sieur Bertrand."</p>
<p>"She favors us, and she hates those others, the <lb/> King's beguilers," said Bertrand. "She was
full <lb/> of interest, and asked a thousand questions, all of <lb/> which I answered according to
my ability. Then <lb/> she sat thinking over these replies until I thought <lb/> she was lost in a
dream and would wake no more. <lb/> But it was not so. At last she said, slowly, and as <lb/> if she
were talking to herself: 'A child of seven- <lb/> teen&#x2014;a girl&#x2014;country
bred&#x2014;untaught&#x2014;ignorant <lb/> of war, the use of arms, and the conduct of battles <lb/>
&#x2014;modest, gentle, shrinking&#x2014;yet throws away her <lb/> shepherd's crook and clothes
herself in steel, and <lb/> fights her way through a hundred and fifty leagues <pb n="152"/> of
hostile territory, never losing heart or hope, and <lb/> never showing fear, and comes&#x2014;she to
whom a <lb/> king must be a dread and awful presence&#x2014;and will <lb/> stand up before such an
one and say, Be not afraid, <lb/> God has sent me to save you! Ah, whence could <lb/> come a courage
and conviction so sublime as this <lb/>
<i>but</i> from very God Himself!' She was silent again <lb/> awhile, thinking and making up her
mind; then she <lb/> said, 'And whether she comes of God or no, there <lb/> is that in her heart
that raises her above men&#x2014;high <lb/> above all men that breathe in France to-day&#x2014;for
<lb/> in her is that mysterious something that puts heart <lb/> into soldiers, and turns mobs of
cowards into armies <lb/> of fighters that forget what fear is when they are in <lb/> that
presence&#x2014;fighters who go into battle with joy <lb/> in their eyes and songs on their lips,
and sweep <lb/> over the field like a storm&#x2014;that is the spirit that <lb/> can save France,
and that alone, come it whence it <lb/> may! It is in her, I do truly believe, for what else <lb/>
could have borne up that child on that great march, <lb/> and made her despise its dangers and
fatigues? The <lb/> King must see her face to face&#x2014;and shall!' She <lb/> dismissed me with
those good words, and I know her <lb/> promise will be kept. They will delay her all they <lb/>
can&#x2014;those animals&#x2014;but she will not fail in the <lb/> end."</p>
<p>"Would <i>she</i> were King!" said the other knight, <lb/> fervently. "For there is little hope
that the King <lb/> himself can be stirred out of his lethargy. He is <lb/> wholly without hope, and
is only thinking of throw- <lb/>
<pb n="153"/> ing away everything and flying to some foreign <lb/> land. The commissioners say there
is a spell upon <lb/> him that makes him hopeless&#x2014;yes, and that it is <lb/> shut up in a
mystery which they cannot fathom."</p>
<p>"I know the mystery," said Joan, with quiet <lb/> confidence; "I know it, and he knows it, but no
<lb/> other but God. When I see him I will tell him a <lb/> secret that will drive away his trouble,
then he will <lb/> hold up his head again."</p>
<p>I was miserable with curiosity to know what it was <lb/> that she would tell him, but she did not
say, and I <lb/> did not expect she would. She was but a child, it <lb/> is true; but she was not a
chatterer to tell great <lb/> matters and make herself important to little people; <lb/> no, she was
reserved, and kept things to herself, as <lb/> the truly great always do.</p>
<p>The next day Queen Yolande got one victory over <lb/> the King's keepers, for, in spite of their
protesta- <lb/> tions and obstructions, she procured an audience for <lb/> our two knights, and they
made the most they could <lb/> out of their opportunity. They told the King what <lb/> a spotless
and beautiful character Joan was, and <lb/> how great and noble a spirit animated her, and they
<lb/> implored him to trust in her, believe in her, and <lb/> have faith that she was sent to save
France. They <lb/> begged him to consent to see her. He was strongly <lb/> moved to do this, and
promised that he would not <lb/> drop the matter out of his mind, but would consult <lb/> with his
council about it. This began to look en- <lb/> couraging. Two hours later there was a great stir <lb/>
<pb n="154"/> below, and the inn-keeper came flying up to say a <lb/> commission of illustrious
ecclesiastics was come from <lb/> the King&#x2014;from the King his very self, understand! <lb/>
&#x2014;think of this vast honor to his humble little hos- <lb/> telry!&#x2014;and he was so
overcome with the glory of it <lb/> that he could hardly find breath enough in his ex- <lb/> cited
body to put the facts into words. They were <lb/> come from the King to speak with the Maid of <lb/>
Vaucouleurs. Then he flew down stairs, and pres- <lb/> ently appeared again, backing into the room,
and <lb/> bowing to the ground with every step, in front of <lb/> four imposing and austere bishops
and their train of <lb/> servants.</p>
<p>Joan rose, and we all stood. The bishops took <lb/> seats, and for a while no word was said, for
it was <lb/> their prerogative to speak first, and they were so <lb/> astonished to see what a child
it was that was making <lb/> such a noise in the world and degrading personages <lb/> of their
dignity to the base function of ambassadors <lb/> to her in her plebeian tavern, that they could not
<lb/> find any words to say at first. Then presently their <lb/> spokesman told Joan they were aware
that she had a <lb/> message for the King, wherefore she was now com- <lb/> manded to put it into
words, briefly and without <lb/> waste of time or embroideries of speech.</p>
<p>As for me, I could hardly contain my joy&#x2014;our <lb/> message was to reach the King at last!
And there <lb/> was the same joy and pride and exultation in the <lb/> faces of our knights, too,
and in those of Joan's <lb/> brothers. And I knew that they were all praying&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="155"/> as I was&#x2014;that the awe which we felt in the presence <lb/> of these great
dignitaries, and which would have tied <lb/> our tongues and locked our jaws, would not affect <lb/>
her in the like degree, but that she would be enabled <lb/> to word her message well, and with
little stumbling, <lb/> and so make a favorable impression here, where it <lb/> would be so valuable
and so important.</p>
<p>Ah, dear, how little we were expecting what hap- <lb/> pened then! We were aghast to hear her say
what <lb/> she said. She was standing in a reverent attitude, <lb/> with her head down and her hands
clasped in front <lb/> of her; for she was always reverent toward the con- <lb/> secrated servants
of God. When the spokesman had <lb/> finished, she raised her head and set her calm eye <lb/> on
those faces, not any more disturbed by their <lb/> state and grandeur than a princess would have
been, <lb/> and said, with all her ordinary simplicity and <lb/> modesty of voice and manner:</p>
<p>"Ye will forgive me, reverend sirs, but I have no <lb/> message save for the King's ear
alone."</p>
<p>Those surprised men were dumb for a moment, <lb/> and their faces flushed darkly; then the
spokesman <lb/> said:</p>
<p>"Hark ye, do you fling the King's command in <lb/> his face and refuse to deliver this message of
yours <lb/> to his servants appointed to receive it?"</p>
<p>"God has appointed one to receive it, and an- <lb/> other's commandment may not take precedence
of <lb/> that. I pray you let me have speech of his grace <lb/> the Dauphin."</p>
<pb n="156"/>
<p>"Forbear this folly, and come at your message! <lb/> Deliver it, and waste no more time about
it."</p>
<p>"You err indeed, most reverend fathers in God, <lb/> and it is not well. I am not come hither to
talk, <lb/> but to deliver Orleans, and lead the Dauphin to his <lb/> good city of Rheims, and set
the crown upon his <lb/> head."</p>
<p>"Is that the message you send to the King?"</p>
<p>But Joan only said, in the simple fashion which <lb/> was her wont:</p>
<p>"Ye will pardon me for reminding you again&#x2014; <lb/> but I have no message to send to any
one."</p>
<p>The King's messengers rose in deep anger and <lb/> swept out of the place without further words,
we <lb/> and Joan kneeling as they passed.</p>
<p>Our countenances were vacant, our hearts full of <lb/> a sense of disaster. Our precious
opportunity was <lb/> thrown away; we could not understand Joan's con- <lb/> duct, she who had been
so wise until this fatal hour. <lb/> At last the Sieur Bertrand found courage to ask her <lb/> why
she had let this great chance to get her message <lb/> to the King go by.</p>
<p>"Who sent them here?" she asked.</p>
<p>"The King."</p>
<p>"Who moved the King to send them?" She <lb/> waited for an answer; none came, for we began to
<lb/> see what was in her mind&#x2014;so she answered her- <lb/> self: "The Dauphin's council moved
him to it. <lb/> Are they enemies to me and to the Dauphin's weal, <lb/> or are they friends?"</p>
<pb n="157"/>
<p>"Enemies," answered the Sieur Bertrand.</p>
<p>"If one would have a message go sound and un- <lb/> garbled, does one choose traitors and
tricksters to <lb/> send it by?"</p>
<p>I saw that we had been fools, and she wise. They <lb/> saw it too, so none found anything to say.
Then <lb/> she went on:</p>
<p>"They had but small wit that contrived this trap. <lb/> They thought to get my message and seem
to deliver <lb/> it straight, yet deftly twist it from its purpose. You <lb/> know that one part of
my message is but this&#x2014;to <lb/> move the Dauphin by argument and reasonings to <lb/> give me
men-at-arms and send me to the siege. If <lb/> an enemy carried these in the right words, the exact
<lb/> words, and no word missing, yet left out the persua- <lb/> sions of gesture and supplicating
tone and beseech- <lb/> ing looks that inform the words and make them live, <lb/> where were the
value of that argument&#x2014;whom <lb/> could it convince? Be patient, the Dauphin will <lb/> hear
me presently; have no fear."</p>
<p>The Sieur de Metz nodded his head several times, <lb/> and muttered as to himself:</p>
<p>"She was right and wise, and we are but dull <lb/> fools, when all is said."</p>
<p>It was just my thought; I could have said it my- <lb/> self; and indeed it was the thought of all
there <lb/> present. A sort of awe crept over us, to think how <lb/> that untaught girl, taken
suddenly and unprepared, <lb/> was yet able to penetrate the cunning devices of a <lb/> King's
trained advisers and defeat them. Marveling <lb/>
<pb n="158"/> over this, and astonished at it, we fell silent and <lb/> spoke no more. We had come
to know that she <lb/> was great in courage, fortitude, endurance, patience, <lb/> conviction,
fidelity to all duties&#x2014;in all things, in- <lb/> deed, that make a good and trusty soldier and
per- <lb/> fect him for his post; now we were beginning to <lb/> feel that maybe there were
greatnesses in her brain <lb/> that were even greater than these great qualities of <lb/> the heart.
It set us thinking.</p>
<p>What Joan did that day bore fruit the very day <lb/> after. The King was obliged to respect the
spirit of <lb/> a young girl who could hold her own and stand her <lb/> ground like that, and he
asserted himself sufficiently <lb/> to put his respect into an act instead of into polite <lb/> and
empty words. He moved Joan out of that poor <lb/> inn, and housed her, with us her servants, in the
<lb/> Castle of Courdray, personally confiding her to the <lb/> care of Madame de Bellier, wife of
old Raoul de <lb/> Gaucourt, Master of the Palace. Of course, this <lb/> royal attention had an
immediate result; all the <lb/> great lords and ladies of the Court began to flock <lb/> there to
see and listen to the wonderful girl-soldier <lb/> that all the world was talking about, and who had
<lb/> answered the King's mandate with a bland refusal to <lb/> obey. Joan charmed them every one
with her <lb/> sweetness and simplicity and unconscious eloquence, <lb/> and all the best and
capablest among them recog- <lb/> nized that there was an indefinable something about <lb/> her that
testified that she was not made of common <lb/> clay, that she was built on a grander plan than the <lb/>
<pb n="159"/> mass of mankind, and moved on a loftier plane. <lb/> These spread her fame. She always
made friends <lb/> and advocates that way; neither the high nor the <lb/> low could come within the
sound of her voice and the <lb/> sight of her face and go out from her presence in- <lb/>
different.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER VI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Well</smcap>, anything to make delay. The King's <lb/> council advised him against
arriving at a <lb/> decision in our matter too precipitately. <i>He</i> arrive <lb/> at a decision
too precipitately! So they sent a <lb/> committee of priests&#x2014;always priests&#x2014;into Lor-
<lb/> raine to inquire into Joan's character and history&#x2014; <lb/> a matter which would consume
several weeks, of <lb/> course. You see how fastidious they were. It was <lb/> as if people should
come to put out the fire when <lb/> a man's house was burning down, and they waited <lb/> till they
could send into another country to find out <lb/> if he had always kept the Sabbath or not, before
<lb/> letting him try.</p>
<p>So the days poked along; dreary for us young <lb/> people in some ways, but not in all, for we
had one <lb/> great anticipation in front of us; we had never seen <lb/> a king, and now some day we
should have that pro- <lb/> digious spectacle to see and to treasure in our <lb/> memories all our
lives; so we were on the lookout, <lb/> and always eager and watching for the chance. The <lb/>
others were doomed to wait longer than I, as it <lb/> turned out. One day great news came&#x2014;the
Orleans <lb/>
<pb n="161"/> commissioners, with Yolande and our knights, had <lb/> at last turned the council's
position and persuaded <lb/> the King to see Joan.</p>
<p>Joan received the immense news gratefully but <lb/> without losing her head, but with us others
it was <lb/> otherwise; we could not eat or sleep or do any <lb/> rational thing for the excitement
and the glory of it. <lb/> During two days our pair of noble knights were in <lb/> distress and
trepidation on Joan's account, for the <lb/> audience was to be at night, and they were afraid <lb/>
that Joan would be so paralyzed by the glare of <lb/> light from the long files of torches, the
solemn <lb/> pomps and ceremonies, the great concourse of re- <lb/> nowned personages, the brilliant
costumes, and the <lb/> other splendors of the Court, that she, a simple <lb/> country maid, and all
unused to such things, would <lb/> be overcome by these terrors and make a piteous <lb/>
failure.</p>
<p>No doubt I could have comforted them, but I was <lb/> not free to speak. Would Joan be disturbed
by this <lb/> cheap spectacle, this tinsel show, with its small King <lb/> and his butterfly
dukelets?&#x2014;she who had spoken <lb/> face to face with the princes of heaven, the familiars
<lb/> of God, and seen their retinue of angels stretching <lb/> back into the remoteness of the sky,
myriads upon <lb/> myriads, like a measureless fan of light, a glory like <lb/> the glory of the sun
streaming from each of those <lb/> innumerable heads, the massed radiance filling the <lb/> deeps of
space with a blinding splendor? I thought <lb/> not.</p>
<pb n="162"/>
<p>Queen Yolande wanted Joan to make the best <lb/> possible impression upon the King and the Court,
<lb/> so she was strenuous to have her clothed in the <lb/> richest stuffs, wrought upon the
princeliest pattern, <lb/> and set off with jewels; but in that she had to be <lb/> disappointed, of
course, Joan not being persuadable <lb/> to it, but begging to be simply and sincerely dressed,
<lb/> as became a servant of God, and one sent upon a <lb/> mission of a serious sort and grave
political import. <lb/> So then the gracious Queen imagined and contrived <lb/> that simple and
witching costume which I have de- <lb/> scribed to you so many times, and which I cannot <lb/> think
of even now in my dull age without being <lb/> moved just as rhythmical and exquisite music moves
<lb/> one; for <i>that</i> was music, that dress&#x2014;that is what it <lb/> was&#x2014;music that
one saw with the eyes and felt in <lb/> the heart. Yes, she was a poem, she was a dream, <lb/> she
was a spirit when she was clothed in that.</p>
<p>She kept that raiment always, and wore it several <lb/> times upon occasions of state, and it is
preserved to <lb/> this day in the Treasury of Orleans, with two of her <lb/> swords, and her
banner, and other things now sacred <lb/> because they had belonged to her.</p>
<p>At the appointed time the Count of Vend&#x00F4;me, a <lb/> great lord of the court, came richly
clothed, with <lb/> his train of servants and assistants, to conduct Joan <lb/> to the King, and the
two knights and I went with <lb/> her, being entitled to this privilege by reason of our <lb/>
official positions near her person.</p>
<p>When we entered the great audience hall, there it <lb/>
<pb n="163"/> all was, just as I have already painted it. Here were <lb/> ranks of guards in shining
armor and with polished <lb/> halberds; two sides of the hall were like flower- <lb/> gardens for
variety of color and the magnificence of <lb/> the costumes; light streamed upon these masses of
<lb/> color from two hundred and fifty flambeaux. There <lb/> was a wide free space down the middle
of the hall, <lb/> and at the end of it was a throne royally canopied, <lb/> and upon it sat a
crowned and sceptred figure nobly <lb/> clothed and blazing with jewels.</p>
<p>It is true that Joan had been hindered and put off <lb/> a good while, but now that she was
admitted to an <lb/> audience at last, she was received with honors <lb/> granted to only the
greatest personages. At the <lb/> entrance door stood four heralds in a row, in splen- <lb/> did
tabards, with long slender silver trumpets at <lb/> their mouths, with square silken banners
depending <lb/> from them embroidered with the arms of France. <lb/> As Joan and the Count passed
by, these trumpets <lb/> gave forth in unison one long rich note, and as we <lb/> moved down the
hall under the pictured and gilded <lb/> vaulting, this was repeated at every fifty feet of our
<lb/> progress&#x2014;six times in all. It made our good <lb/> knights proud and happy, and they
held themselves <lb/> erect, and stiffened their stride, and looked fine and <lb/> soldierly. They
were not expecting this beautiful <lb/> and honorable tribute to our little country maid.</p>
<p>Joan walked two yards behind the Count, we <lb/> three walked two yards behind Joan. Our solemn
<lb/> march ended when we were as yet some eight or ten <lb/>
<pb n="164"/> steps from the throne. The Count made a deep <lb/> obeisance, pronounced Joan's name,
then bowed <lb/> again and moved to his place among a group of <lb/> officials near the throne. I
was devouring the <lb/> crowned personage with all my eyes, and my heart <lb/> almost stood still
with awe.</p>
<p>The eyes of all others were fixed upon Joan in a <lb/> gaze of wonder which was half worship, and
which <lb/> seemed to say, "How sweet&#x2014;how lovely&#x2014;how <lb/> divine!" All lips were
parted and motionless, which <lb/> was a sure sign that those people, who seldom for- <lb/> get
themselves, had forgotten themselves now, and <lb/> were not conscious of anything but the one
object <lb/> they were gazing upon. They had the look of <lb/> people who are under the enchantment
of a vision.</p>
<p>Then they presently began to come to life again, <lb/> rousing themselves out of the spell and
shaking it <lb/> off as one drives away little by little a clinging <lb/> drowsiness or
intoxication. Now they fixed their <lb/> attention upon Joan with a strong new interest of <lb/>
another sort; they were full of curiosity to see what <lb/> she would do&#x2014;they having a secret
and particular <lb/> reason for this curiosity. So they watched. This <lb/> is what they saw:</p>
<p>She made no obeisance, nor even any slight in- <lb/> clination of her head, but stood looking
toward the <lb/> throne in silence. That was all there was to see at <lb/> present.</p>
<p>I glanced up at De Metz, and was shocked at the <lb/> paleness of his face. I whispered and
said:</p>
<pb/>
<figure>
<head>JOAN DISCOVERS THE DISGUISED KING</head>
</figure>
<pb/>
<pb n="165"/>
<p>"What is it man, what is it?"</p>
<p>His answering whisper was so weak I could hardly <lb/> catch it:</p>
<p>"They have taken advantage of the hint in her <lb/> letter to play a trick upon her! She will
err, and <lb/> they will laugh at her. That is not the King that <lb/> sits there."</p>
<p>Then I glanced at Joan. She was still gazing <lb/> steadfastly toward the throne, and I had the
curious <lb/> fancy that even her shoulders and the back of her <lb/> head expressed bewilderment.
Now she turned her <lb/> head slowly, and her eye wandered along the lines <lb/> of standing
courtiers till it fell upon a young man <lb/> who was very quietly dressed; then her face lighted
<lb/> joyously, and she ran and threw herself at his feet, <lb/> and clasped his knees, exclaiming
in that soft melo- <lb/> dious voice which was her birthright and was now <lb/> charged with deep
and tender feeling:</p>
<p>"God of his grace give you long life, O dear and <lb/> gentle Dauphin!"</p>
<p>In his astonishment and exultation De Metz cried <lb/> out:</p>
<p>"By the shadow of God, it is an amazing thing!" <lb/> Then he mashed all the bones of my hand in
his grate- <lb/> ful grip, and added, with a proud shake of his mane, <lb/> "<i>Now</i>, what have
these painted infidels to say!"</p>
<p>Meantime the young person in the plain clothes <lb/> was saying to Joan:</p>
<p>"Ah, you mistake, my child, I am not the King. <lb/> There he is," and he pointed to the
throne.</p>
<pb n="166"/>
<p>The knight's face clouded, and he muttered in <lb/> grief and indignation:</p>
<p>"Ah, it is a shame to use her so. But for this lie <lb/> she had gone through safe. I will go and
proclaim <lb/> to all the house what&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Stay where you are!" whispered I and the <lb/> Sieur Bertrand in a breath, and made him stop in
<lb/> his place.</p>
<p>Joan did not stir from her knees, but still lifted <lb/> her happy face toward the King, and
said:</p>
<p>"No, gracious liege, you are he, and none <lb/> other."</p>
<p>De Metz's troubles vanished away, and he said:</p>
<p>"Verily, she was not guessing, she <i>knew</i>. Now, <lb/> how could she know? It is a miracle. I
am con- <lb/> tent, and will meddle no more, for I perceive that <lb/> she is equal to her
occasions, having that in her <lb/> head that cannot profitably be helped by the vacancy <lb/> that
is in mine."</p>
<p>This interruption of his lost me a remark or <lb/> two of the other talk; however, I caught the
King's <lb/> next question:</p>
<p>"But tell me who you are, and what would <lb/> you?"</p>
<p>"I am called Joan the Maid, and am sent to say <lb/> that the King of Heaven wills that you be
crowned <lb/> and consecrated in your good city of Rheims, and <lb/> be thereafter Lieutenant of the
Lord of Heaven, <lb/> who is King of France. And He willeth also that <lb/> you set me at my
appointed work and give me men- <lb/>
<pb n="167"/> at-arms." After a slight pause she added, her eye <lb/> lighting at the sound of her
words, "For then will I <lb/> raise the siege of Orleans and break the English <lb/> power!"</p>
<p>The young monarch's amused face sobered a little <lb/> when this martial speech fell upon that
sick air like <lb/> a breath blown from embattled camps and fields of <lb/> war, and his trifling
smile presently faded wholly <lb/> away and disappeared. He was grave now, and <lb/> thoughtful.
After a little he waved his hand lightly, <lb/> and all the people fell away and left those two by
<lb/> themselves in a vacant space. The knights and I <lb/> moved to the opposite side of the hall
and stood <lb/> there. We saw Joan rise at a sign, then she and the <lb/> King talked privately
together.</p>
<p>All that host had been consumed with curiosity to <lb/> see what Joan would do. Well, they had
seen, and <lb/> now they were full of astonishment to see that she <lb/> had really performed that
strange miracle according <lb/> to the promise in her letter; and they were fully as <lb/> much
astonished to find that she was not overcome <lb/> by the pomps and splendors about her, but was
<lb/> even more tranquil and at her ease in holding speech <lb/> with a monarch than ever they
themselves had been, <lb/> with all their practice and experience.</p>
<p>As for our two knights, they were inflated beyond <lb/> measure with pride in Joan, but nearly
dumb, as to <lb/> speech, they not being able to think out any way to <lb/> account for her managing
to carry herself through <lb/> this imposing ordeal without ever a mistake or an <lb/>
<pb n="168"/> awkwardness of any kind to mar the grace and <lb/> credit of her great
performance.</p>
<p>The talk between Joan and the King was long and <lb/> earnest, and held in low voices. We could
not <lb/> hear, but we had our eyes and could note effects; <lb/> and presently we and all the house
noted one effect <lb/> which was memorable and striking, and has been set <lb/> down in memoirs and
histories and in testimony at <lb/> the Process of Rehabilitation by some who witnessed <lb/> it;
for all knew it was big with meaning, though <lb/> none knew what that meaning was at that time, of
<lb/> course. For suddenly we saw the King shake off <lb/> his indolent attitude and straighten up
like a man, <lb/> and at the same time look immeasurably astonished. <lb/> It was as if Joan had
told him something almost too <lb/> wonderful for belief, and yet of a most uplifting and <lb/>
welcome nature.</p>
<p>It was long before we found out the secret of <lb/> this conversation, but we know it now, and
all the <lb/> world knows it. That part of the talk was like this <lb/> &#x2014;as one may read in
all histories. The perplexed <lb/> King asked Joan for a sign. He wanted to believe <lb/> in her and
her mission, and that her Voices were <lb/> supernatural and endowed with knowledge hidden <lb/>
from mortals, but how could he do this unless these <lb/> Voices could prove their claim in some
absolutely <lb/> unassailable way? It was then that Joan said:</p>
<p>"I will give you a sign, and you shall no more <lb/> doubt. There is a secret trouble in your
heart <lb/> which you speak of to none&#x2014;a doubt which wastes <lb/>
<pb n="169"/> away your courage, and makes you dream of throw- <lb/> ing all away and fleeing from
your realm. Within <lb/> this little while you have been praying, in your own <lb/> breast, that God
of his grace would resolve that <lb/> doubt, even if the doing of it must show you that <lb/> no
kingly right is lodged in you."</p>
<p>It was that that amazed the King, for it was as <lb/> she had said: his prayer was the secret of
his own <lb/> breast, and none but God could know about it. So <lb/> he said:</p>
<p>"The sign is sufficient. I know now that these <lb/> Voices are of God. They have said true in
this <lb/> matter; if they have said more, tell it me&#x2014;I will <lb/> believe."</p>
<p>"They have resolved that doubt, and I bring their <lb/> very words, which are these: Thou art
lawful heir to <lb/> the King thy father, and true heir of France. God <lb/> has spoken it. Now lift
up thy head, and doubt no <lb/> more, but give me men-at-arms and let me get about <lb/> my
work."</p>
<p>Telling him he was of lawful birth was what <lb/> straightened him up and made a man of him for a
<lb/> moment, removing his doubts upon that head and <lb/> convincing him of his royal right; and if
any could <lb/> have hanged his hindering and pestiferous council <lb/> and set him free, he would
have answered Joan's <lb/> prayer and set her in the field. But no, those <lb/> creatures were only
checked, not checkmated; they <lb/> could invent some more delays.</p>
<p>We had been made proud by the honors which <lb/>
<pb n="170"/> had so distinguished Joan's entrance into that place <lb/> &#x2014;honors restricted
to personages of very high rank <lb/> and worth&#x2014;but that pride was as nothing com- <lb/>
pared with the pride we had in the honor done her <lb/> upon leaving it. For whereas those first
honors <lb/> were shown only to the great, these last, up to this <lb/> time, had been shown only to
the royal. The King <lb/> himself led Joan by the hand down the great hall to <lb/> the door, the
glittering multitude standing and <lb/> making reverence as they passed, and the silver <lb/>
trumpets sounding those rich notes of theirs. Then <lb/> he dismissed her with gracious words,
bending low <lb/> over her hand and kissing it. Always&#x2014;from all <lb/> companies, high or
low&#x2014;she went forth richer in <lb/> honor and esteem than when she came.</p>
<p>And the King did another handsome thing by <lb/> Joan, for he sent us back to Courdray Castle
torch- <lb/> lighted and in state, under escort of his own troop&#x2014; <lb/> his guard of
honor&#x2014;the only soldiers he had; and <lb/> finely equipped and bedizened they were, too, <lb/>
though they hadn't seen the color of their wages <lb/> since they were children, as a body might
say. The <lb/> wonders which Joan had been performing before the <lb/> King had been carried all
around by this time, so <lb/> the road was so packed with people who wanted to <lb/> get a sight of
her that we could hardly dig through; <lb/> and as for talking together, we couldn't, all attempts
<lb/> at talk being drowned in the storm of shoutings and <lb/> huzzas that broke out all along as
we passed, and <lb/> kept abreast of us like a wave the whole way.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER VII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>We</smcap> were doomed to suffer tedious waits and de- <lb/> lays, and we settled
ourselves down to our fate <lb/> and bore it with a dreary patience, counting the <lb/> slow hours
and the dull days and hoping for a turn <lb/> when God should please to send it. The Paladin <lb/>
was the only exception&#x2014;that is to say, he was the <lb/> only one who was happy and had no
heavy times. <lb/> This was partly owing to the satisfaction he got out <lb/> of his clothes. He
bought them when he first ar- <lb/> rived. He bought them at second hand&#x2014;a Spanish <lb/>
cavalier's complete suit, wide-brimmed hat with flow- <lb/> ing plumes, lace collar and cuffs, faded
velvet doublet <lb/> and trunks, short cloak hung from the shoulder, <lb/> funnel-topped buskins,
long rapier, and all that&#x2014;a <lb/> graceful and picturesque costume, and the Paladin's <lb/>
great frame was the right place to hang it for effect. <lb/> He wore it when off duty; and when he
swaggered <lb/> by with one hand resting on the hilt of his rapier, <lb/> and twirling his new
mustache with the other, every- <lb/> body stopped to look and admire; and well they <lb/> might,
for he was a fine and stately contrast to the <lb/> small French gentleman of the day squeezed into
the <lb/> trivial French costume of the time.</p>
<pb n="172"/>
<p>He was king bee of the little village that snuggled <lb/> under the shelter of the frowning
towers and bastions <lb/> of Courdray Castle, and acknowledged lord of the <lb/> tap-room of the
inn. When he opened his mouth <lb/> there, he got a hearing. Those simple artisans and <lb/>
peasants listened with deep and wondering interest; <lb/> for he was a traveler and had seen the
world&#x2014;all <lb/> of it that lay between Chinon and Domremy, at any <lb/> rate&#x2014;and that
was a wide stretch more of it than <lb/> they might ever hope to see; and he had been in <lb/>
battle, and knew how to paint its shock and strug- <lb/> gle, its perils and surprises, with an art
that was all <lb/> his own. He was cock of that walk, hero of that <lb/> hostelry; he drew custom as
honey draws flies; so <lb/> he was the pet of the inn-keeper, and of his wife and <lb/> daughter,
and they were his obliged and willing <lb/> servants.</p>
<p>Most people who have the narrative gift&#x2014;that <lb/> great and rare endowment&#x2014;have
with it the defect <lb/> of telling their choice things over the same way every <lb/> time, and this
injures them and causes them to sound <lb/> stale and wearisome after several repetitions; but it
<lb/> was not so with the Paladin, whose art was of a finer <lb/> sort; it was more stirring and
interesting to hear him <lb/> tell about a battle the tenth time than it was the first <lb/> time,
because he did not tell it twice the same way, <lb/> but always made a new battle of it and a better
one, <lb/> with more casualties on the enemy's side each time, <lb/> and more general wreck and
disaster all around, and <lb/> more widows and orphans and suffering in the neigh- <lb/>
<pb n="173"/> borhood where it happened. He could not tell his <lb/> battles apart himself, except
by their names; and by <lb/> the time he had told one of them ten times he had to <lb/> lay it aside
and start a new one in its place, because <lb/> it had grown so that there wasn't room enough in
<lb/> France for it any more, but was lapping over the <lb/> edges. But up to that point the
audience would not <lb/> allow him to substitute a new battle, knowing that <lb/> the old ones were
the best, and sure to improve as <lb/> long as France could hold them; and so, instead of <lb/>
saying to him as they would have said to another, <lb/> "Give us something fresh, we are fatigued
with that <lb/> old thing," they would say, with one voice and with <lb/> a strong interest, "Tell
about the surprise at <lb/> Beaulieu again&#x2014;tell it three or four times!" That <lb/> is a
compliment which few narrative experts have <lb/> heard in their lifetime.</p>
<p>At first when the Paladin heard us tell about the <lb/> glories of the Royal Audience he was
broken-hearted <lb/> because he was not taken with us to it; next, his <lb/> talk was full of what
he would have done if he had <lb/> been there; and within two days he was telling what <lb/> he
<i>did</i> do when he <i>was</i> there. His mill was fairly <lb/> started, now, and could be trusted
to take care of its <lb/> affair. Within three nights afterwards all his battles <lb/> were taking a
rest, for already his worshipers in the <lb/> tap-room were so infatuated with the great tale of the
<lb/> Royal Audience that they would have nothing else, <lb/> and so besotted with it were they that
they would <lb/> have cried if they could not have gotten it.</p>
<pb n="174"/>
<p>No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson hid himself and heard it, and <lb/> came and told me, and after that we
went together <lb/> to listen, bribing the inn hostess to let us have her <lb/> little private
parlor, where we could stand at the <lb/> wickets in the door and see and hear.</p>
<p>The tap-room was large, yet had a snug and cosy <lb/> look, with its inviting little tables and
chairs scattered <lb/> irregularly over its red brick floor, and its great fire <lb/> flaming and
crackling in the wide chimney. It was a <lb/> comfortable place to be in on such chilly and blus-
<lb/> tering March nights as these, and a goodly company <lb/> had taken shelter there, and were
sipping their wine <lb/> in contentment and gossiping one with another in a <lb/> neighborly way
while they waited for the historian. <lb/> The host, the hostess, and their pretty daughter <lb/>
were flying here and there and yonder among the <lb/> tables and doing their best to keep up with
the <lb/> orders. The room was about forty feet square, and <lb/> a space or aisle down the center
of it had been kept <lb/> vacant and reserved for the Paladin's needs. At the <lb/> end of it was a
platform ten or twelve feet wide, with <lb/> a big chair and a small table on it, and three steps
<lb/> leading up to it.</p>
<p>Among the wine-sippers were many familiar faces: <lb/> the cobbler, the farrier, the blacksmith,
the wheel- <lb/> wright, the armorer, the maltster, the weaver, the <lb/> baker, the miller's man
with his dusty coat, and so <lb/> on; and conspicuous and important, as a matter of <lb/> course,
was the barber-surgeon, for he is that in all <lb/> villages. As he has to pull everybody's teeth
and <lb/>
<pb n="175"/> purge and bleed all the grown people once a month <lb/> to keep their health sound, he
knows everybody, and <lb/> by constant contact with all sorts of folk becomes <lb/> a master of
etiquette and manners and a conversa- <lb/> tionalist of large facility. There were plenty of car-
<lb/> riers, drovers, and their sort, and journeymen <lb/> artisans.</p>
<p>When the Paladin presently came sauntering indo- <lb/> lently in, he was received with a cheer,
and the bar- <lb/> ber bustled forward and greeted him with several low <lb/> and most graceful and
courtly bows, also taking his <lb/> hand and touching his lips to it. Then he called in <lb/> a loud
voice for a stoup of wine for the Paladin, and <lb/> when the host's daughter brought it up on to
the <lb/> platform and dropped her curtesy and departed, the <lb/> barber called after her, and told
her to add the wine <lb/> to his score. This won him ejaculations of approval, <lb/> which pleased
him very much and made his little rat- <lb/> eyes shine; and such applause is right and proper,
<lb/> for when we do a liberal and gallant thing it is but <lb/> natural that we should wish to see
notice taken of it.</p>
<p>The barber called upon the people to rise and <lb/> drink the Paladin's health, and they did it
with <lb/> alacrity and affectionate heartiness, clashing their <lb/> metal flagons together with a
simultaneous crash, and <lb/> heightening the effect with a resounding cheer. It <lb/> was a fine
thing to see how that young swashbuckler <lb/> had made himself so popular in a strange land in so
<lb/> little a while, and without other helps to his advance- <lb/> ment than just his tongue and
the talent to use it <lb/>
<pb n="176"/> given him by God&#x2014;a talent which was but one <lb/> talent in the beginning, but
was now become ten <lb/> through husbandry and the increment and usufruct <lb/> that do naturally
follow that and reward it as by a <lb/> law.</p>
<p>The people sat down and began to hammer on the <lb/> tables with their flagons and call for "the
King's <lb/> Audience!&#x2014;the King's Audience!&#x2014;the King's <lb/> Audience!" The Paladin
stood there in one of his <lb/> best attitudes, with his plumed great hat tipped over <lb/> to the
left, the folds of his short cloak drooping from <lb/> his shoulder, and the one hand resting upon
the hilt <lb/> of his rapier and the other lifting his beaker. As <lb/> the noise died down he made
a stately sort of a bow, <lb/> which he had picked up somewhere, then fetched his <lb/> beaker with
a sweep to his lips and tilted his head <lb/> back and drained it to the bottom. The barber <lb/>
jumped for it and set it upon the Paladin's table. <lb/> Then the Paladin began to walk up and down
his <lb/> platform with a great deal of dignity and quite at his <lb/> ease; and as he walked he
talked, and every little <lb/> while stopped and stood facing his house and so <lb/> standing
continued his talk.</p>
<p>We went three nights in succession. It was plain <lb/> that there was a charm about the
performance that <lb/> was apart from the mere interest which attaches to <lb/> lying. It was
presently discoverable that this charm <lb/> lay in the Paladin's sincerity. He was not lying <lb/>
consciously; he believed what he was saying. To <lb/> him, his initial statements were facts, and
whenever <lb/>
<pb n="177"/> he enlarged a statement, the enlargement became a <lb/> fact too. He put his heart
into his extravagant nar- <lb/> rative, just as a poet puts his heart into a heroic fic- <lb/> tion,
and his earnestness disarmed criticism&#x2014;dis- <lb/> armed it as far as he himself was
concerned. Nobody <lb/> believed his narrative, but all believed that he be- <lb/> lieved it.</p>
<p>He made his enlargements without flourish, with- <lb/> out emphasis, and so casually that often
one failed <lb/> to notice that a change had been made. He spoke <lb/> of the governor of
Vaucouleurs, the first night, <lb/> simply as the governor of Vaucouleurs; he spoke of <lb/> him the
second night as his uncle the governor of <lb/> Vaucouleurs; the third night he was his father. He
<lb/> did not seem to know that he was making these ex- <lb/> traordinary changes; they dropped from
his lips in <lb/> a quite natural and effortless way. By his first <lb/> night's account the
governor merely attached him to <lb/> the Maid's military escort in a general and unofficial <lb/>
way; the second night his uncle the governor sent <lb/> him with the Maid as lieutenant of her rear
guard; <lb/> the third night his father the governor put the whole <lb/> command, Maid and all, in
his especial charge. The <lb/> first night the governor spoke of him as a youth <lb/> without name
or ancestry, but "destined to achieve <lb/> both"; the second night his uncle the governor <lb/>
spoke of him as the latest and worthiest lineal de- <lb/> scendant of the chiefest and noblest of
the Twelve <lb/> Paladins of Charlemagne; the third night he spoke <lb/> of him as the lineal
descendant of the whole dozen. <lb/>
<pb n="178"/> In three nights he promoted the Count of Vend&#x00F4;me <lb/> from a fresh
acquaintance to schoolmate, and then <lb/> brother-in-law.</p>
<p>At the King's Audience everything grew, in the <lb/> same way. First the four silver trumpets
were <lb/> twelve, then thirty-five, finally ninety-six; and by <lb/> that time he had thrown in so
many drums and cym- <lb/> bals that he had to lengthen the hall from five hun- <lb/> dred feet to
nine hundred to accommodate them. <lb/> Under his hand the people present multiplied in <lb/> the
same large way.</p>
<p>The first two nights he contented himself with <lb/> merely describing and exaggerating the chief
dra- <lb/> matic incident of the Audience, but the third night <lb/> he added illustration to
description. He throned the <lb/> barber in his own high chair to represent the sham <lb/> King;
then he told how the Court watched the Maid <lb/> with intense interest and suppressed merriment,
ex- <lb/> pecting to see her fooled by the deception and get <lb/> herself swept permanently out of
credit by the storm <lb/> of scornful laughter which would follow. He <lb/> worked this scene up
till he got his house in a burn- <lb/> ing fever of excitement and anticipation, then came <lb/> his
climax. Turning to the barber, he said:</p>
<p>"But mark you what she did. She gazed stead- <lb/> fastly upon that sham's villain face as I now
gaze <lb/> upon yours&#x2014;this being her noble and simple atti- <lb/> tude, just as I stand
now&#x2014;then turned she&#x2014;thus <lb/> &#x2014;to me, and stretching her arm
out&#x2014;so&#x2014;and <lb/> pointing with her finger, she said, in that firm, calm <lb/>
<pb n="179"/> tone which she was used to use in directing the con- <lb/> duct of a battle, 'Pluck me
this false knave from the <lb/> throne!' I, striding forward as I do now, took him <lb/> by the
collar and lifted him out and held him aloft <lb/> &#x2014;thus&#x2014;as if he had been but a
child." (The <lb/> house rose, shouting, stamping, and banging with <lb/> their flagons, and went
fairly mad over this mag- <lb/> nificent exhibition of strength&#x2014;and there was not <lb/> the
shadow of a laugh anywhere, though the specta- <lb/> cle of the limp but proud barber hanging there
in the <lb/> air like a puppy held by the scruff of its neck was a <lb/> thing that had nothing of
solemnity about it.) <lb/> "Then I set him down upon his feet&#x2014;thus&#x2014;being <lb/> minded
to get him by a better hold and heave him <lb/> out of the window, but she bid me forbear, so by
<lb/> that error he escaped with his life.</p>
<p>"Then she turned her about and viewed the throng <lb/> with those eyes of hers, which are the
clear-shining <lb/> windows whence her immortal wisdom looketh out <lb/> upon the world, resolving
its falsities and coming <lb/> at the kernel of truth that is hid within them, and <lb/> presently
they fell upon a young man modestly <lb/> clothed, and him she proclaimed for what he truly <lb/>
was, saying, 'I am thy servant&#x2014;thou art the King!' <lb/> Then all were astonished, and a
great shout went <lb/> up, the whole six thousand joining in it, so that the <lb/> walls rocked with
the volume and the tumult of it."</p>
<p>He made a fine and picturesque thing of the <lb/> march-out from the Audience, augmenting the
glories <lb/> of it to the last limit of the impossibilities; then he <lb/>
<pb n="180"/> took from his finger and held up a brass nut from a <lb/> bolt-head which the
head-ostler at the castle had <lb/> given him that morning, and made his conclusion <lb/>
&#x2014;thus:</p>
<p>"Then the King dismissed the Maid most gra- <lb/> ciously&#x2014;as indeed was her
desert&#x2014;and, turning to <lb/> me, said, 'Take this signet-ring, son of the Paladins, <lb/> and
command me with it in your day of need; and <lb/> look you,' said he, touching my temple, 'preserve
<lb/> this brain, France has use for it; and look well to <lb/> its casket also, for I foresee that
it will be hooped <lb/> with a ducal coronet one day.' I took the ring, <lb/> and knelt and kissed
his hand, saying, 'Sire, where <lb/> glory calls, there will I be found; where danger and <lb/>
death are thickest, that is my native air; when <lb/> France and the throne need help&#x2014;well, I
say noth- <lb/> ing, for I am not of the talking sort&#x2014;let my deeds <lb/> speak for me, it is
all I ask.'</p>
<p>"So ended that most fortunate and memorable <lb/> episode, so big with future weal for the crown
and <lb/> the nation, and unto God be the thanks! Rise! <lb/> Fill your flagons! Now&#x2014;to
France and the King <lb/> &#x2014;drink!"</p>
<p>They emptied them to the bottom, then burst into <lb/> cheers and huzzas, and kept it up as much
as two <lb/> minutes, the Paladin standing at stately ease the <lb/> while and smiling benignantly
from his platform.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="VIII">
<pb n="181"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER VIII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>When</smcap> Joan told the King what that deep secret <lb/> was that was torturing his
heart, his doubts <lb/> were cleared away; he believed she was sent of God, <lb/> and if he had been
let alone he would have set her <lb/> upon her great mission at once. But he was not let <lb/>
alone. Tremouille and the holy fox of Rheims <lb/> knew their man. All they needed to say was this
<lb/> &#x2014;and they said it:</p>
<p>"Your Highness says her Voices have revealed to <lb/> you, by her mouth, a secret known only to
yourself <lb/> and God. How can you know that her Voices are <lb/> not of Satan, and she his
mouthpiece?&#x2014;for does <lb/> not Satan know the secrets of men and use his <lb/> knowledge for
the destruction of their souls? It is <lb/> a dangerous business, and your Highness will do <lb/>
well not to proceed in it without probing the matter <lb/> to the bottom."</p>
<p>That was enough. It shriveled up the King's <lb/> little soul like a raisin, with terrors and
apprehen- <lb/> sions, and straightway he privately appointed a com- <lb/> mission of bishops to
visit and question Joan daily <lb/> until they should find out whether her supernatural <lb/> helps
hailed from heaven or from hell.</p>
<pb n="182"/>
<p>The King's relative, the Duke of Alen&#x00E7;on, three <lb/> years prisoner of war to the
English, was in these <lb/> days released from captivity through promise of a <lb/> great ransom;
and the name and fame of the Maid <lb/> having reached him&#x2014;for the same filled all mouths
<lb/> now, and penetrated to all parts&#x2014;he came to <lb/> Chinon to see with his own eyes what
manner of <lb/> creature she might be. The King sent for Joan and <lb/> introduced her to the Duke.
She said, in her simple <lb/> fashion:</p>
<p>"You are welcome; the more of the blood of <lb/> France that is joined to this cause, the better
for the <lb/> cause and it."</p>
<p>Then the two talked together, and there was just <lb/> the usual result: when they parted, the
Duke was <lb/> her friend and advocate.</p>
<p>Joan attended the King's mass the next day, and <lb/> afterward dined with the King and the Duke.
The <lb/> King was learning to prize her company and value <lb/> her conversation; and that might
well be, for, like <lb/> other kings, he was used to getting nothing out of <lb/> people's talk but
guarded phrases, colorless and non- <lb/> committal, or carefully tinted to tally with the color
<lb/> of what he said himself; and so this kind of conver- <lb/> sation only vexes and bores, and is
wearisome; but <lb/> Joan's talk was fresh and free, sincere and honest, <lb/> and unmarred by
timorous self-watching and con- <lb/> straint. She said the very thing that was in her <lb/> mind,
and said it in a plain, straightforward way. <lb/> One can believe that to the King this must have
been <lb/>
<pb n="183"/> like fresh cold water from the mountains to parched <lb/> lips used to the water of
the sun-baked puddles of <lb/> the plain.</p>
<p>After dinner Joan so charmed the Duke with her <lb/> horsemanship and lance-practice in the
meadows by <lb/> the Castle of Chinon, whither the King also had <lb/> come to look on, that he made
her a present of a <lb/> great black war-steed.</p>
<p>Every day the commission of bishops came and <lb/> questioned Joan about her Voices and her
mission, <lb/> and then went to the King with their report. These <lb/> pryings accomplished but
little. She told as much <lb/> as she considered advisable, and kept the rest to <lb/> herself. Both
threats and trickeries were wasted <lb/> upon her. She did not care for the threats, and the <lb/>
traps caught nothing. She was perfectly frank and <lb/> childlike about these things. She knew the
bishops <lb/> were sent by the King, that their questions were the <lb/> King's questions, and that
by all law and custom a <lb/> King's questions <i>must</i> be answered; yet she told the <lb/> King
in her na&#x00EF;ve way at his own table one day that <lb/> she answered only such of those
questions as suited <lb/> her.</p>
<p>The bishops finally concluded that they couldn't <lb/> tell whether Joan was sent by God or not.
They <lb/> were cautious, you see. There were two powerful <lb/> parties at Court; therefore to make
a decision either <lb/> way would infallibly embroil them with one of those <lb/> parties; so it
seemed to them wisest to roost on the <lb/> fence and shift the burden to other shoulders. And <lb/>
<pb n="184"/> that is what they did. They made final report that <lb/> Joan's case was beyond their
powers, and recom- <lb/> mended that it be put into the hands of the learned <lb/> and illustrious
doctors of the University of Poitiers. <lb/> Then they retired from the field, leaving behind <lb/>
them this little item of testimony, wrung from them <lb/> by Joan's wise reticence: they said she
was a <lb/> "gentle and simple little shepherdess, very candid, <lb/>
<i>but not given to talking</i>."</p>
<p>It was quite true&#x2014;in their case. But if they <lb/> could have looked back and seen her
with us in the <lb/> happy pastures of Domremy, they would have per- <lb/> ceived that she had a
tongue that could go fast <lb/> enough when no harm could come of her words.</p>
<p>So we traveled to Poitiers, to endure there three <lb/> weeks of tedious delay while this poor
child was <lb/> being daily questioned and badgered before a great <lb/> bench of&#x2014;what?
Military experts?&#x2014;since what <lb/> she had come to apply for was an army and the <lb/>
privilege of leading it to battle against the enemies of <lb/> France. Oh no; it was a great bench
of priests and <lb/> monks&#x2014;profoundly learned and astute casuists&#x2014; <lb/> renowned
professors of theology! Instead of setting <lb/> a military commission to find out if this valorous
<lb/> little soldier could win victories, they set a company <lb/> of holy hair-splitters and
phrase-mongers to work to <lb/> find out if the soldier was sound in her piety and had <lb/> no
doctrinal leaks. The rats were devouring the <lb/> house, but instead of examining the cat's teeth
and <lb/> claws, they only concerned themselves to find out if <lb/>
<pb n="185"/> it was a holy cat. If it was a pious cat, a moral cat, <lb/> all right, never mind
about the other capacities, they <lb/> were of no consequence.</p>
<p>Joan was as sweetly self-possessed and tranquil be- <lb/> fore this grim tribunal, with its robed
celebrities, its <lb/> solemn state and imposing ceremonials, as if she <lb/> were but a spectator
and not herself on trial. She <lb/> sat there, solitary on her bench, untroubled, and <lb/>
disconcerted the science of the sages with her sublime <lb/> ignorance&#x2014;an ignorance which was
a fortress; arts, <lb/> wiles, the learning drawn from books, and all like <lb/> missiles rebounded
from its unconscious masonry and <lb/> fell to the ground harmless; they could not dislodge <lb/>
the garrison which was within&#x2014;Joan's serene great <lb/> heart and spirit, the guards and
keepers of her <lb/> mission.</p>
<p>She answered all questions frankly, and she told <lb/> all the story of her visions and of her
experiences <lb/> with the angels and what they said to her; and the <lb/> manner of the telling was
so unaffected, and so <lb/> earnest and sincere, and made it all seem so lifelike <lb/> and real,
that even that hard practical court forgot <lb/> itself and sat motionless and mute, listening with
a <lb/> charmed and wondering interest to the end. And if <lb/> you would have other testimony than
mine, look in <lb/> the histories and you will find where an eye-witness, <lb/> giving sworn
testimony in the Rehabilitation process, <lb/> says that she told that tale "with a noble dignity
and <lb/> simplicity," and as to its effect, says in substance <lb/> what I have said. Seventeen,
she was&#x2014;seventeen, <lb/>
<pb n="186"/> and all alone on her bench by herself; yet was not <lb/> afraid, but faced that great
company of erudite <lb/> doctors of law and theology, and by the help of no <lb/> art learned in the
schools, but using only the en- <lb/> chantments which were hers by nature, of youth, <lb/>
sincerity, a voice soft and musical, and an eloquence <lb/> whose source was the heart, not the
head, she laid <lb/> that spell upon them. Now was not that a beautiful <lb/> thing to see? If I
could, I would put it before you <lb/> just as I saw it; then I know what you would say.</p>
<p>As I have told you, she could not read. One day <lb/> they harried and pestered her with
arguments, <lb/> reasonings, objections, and other windy and wordy <lb/> trivialities, gathered out
of the works of this and that <lb/> and the other great theological authority, until at <lb/> last
her patience vanished, and she turned upon them <lb/> sharply and said:</p>
<p>"I don't know A from B; but I know this: that <lb/> I am come by command of the Lord of Heaven to
<lb/> deliver Orleans from the English power and crown <lb/> the King at Rheims, and the matters ye
are puttering <lb/> over are of no consequence!"</p>
<p>Necessarily those were trying days for her, and <lb/> wearing for everybody that took part; but
her share <lb/> was the hardest, for she had no holidays, but must <lb/> be always on hand and stay
the long hours through, <lb/> whereas this, that, and the other inquisitor could <lb/> absent
himself and rest up from his fatigues when he <lb/> got worn out. And yet she showed no wear, no
<lb/> weariness, and but seldom let fly her temper. As <lb/>
<pb n="187"/> a rule she put her day through calm, alert, patient, <lb/> fencing with those veteran
masters of scholarly <lb/> sword-play and coming out always without a scratch.</p>
<p>One day a Dominican sprung upon her a question <lb/> which made everybody cock up his ears with
interest; <lb/> as for me, I trembled, and said to myself she is <lb/> caught this time, poor Joan,
for there is no way of <lb/> answering this. The sly Dominican began in this <lb/> way&#x2014;in a
sort of indolent fashion, as if the thing <lb/> he was about was a matter of no moment:</p>
<p>"You assert that God has willed to deliver France <lb/> from this English bondage?"</p>
<p>"Yes, He has willed it."</p>
<p>"You wish for men-at arms, so that you may go <lb/> to the relief of Orleans, I believe?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;and the sooner the better."</p>
<p>"God is all-powerful, and able to do whatsoever <lb/> thing He wills to do, is it not so?"</p>
<p>"Most surely. None doubts it."</p>
<p>The Dominican lifted his head suddenly, and <lb/> sprung that question I have spoken of, with
exulta- <lb/> tion:</p>
<p>"Then answer me this. If He has willed to de- <lb/> liver France, and is able to do whatsoever He
wills, <lb/> where is the need for men-at-arms?"</p>
<p>There was a fine stir and commotion when he said <lb/> that, and a sudden thrusting forward of
heads and <lb/> putting up of hands to ears to catch the answer; and <lb/> the Dominican wagged his
head with satisfaction, <lb/> and looked about him collecting his applause, for it <lb/>
<pb n="188"/> shone in every face. But Joan was not disturbed. <lb/> There was no note of disquiet
in her voice when she <lb/> answered:</p>
<p>"He helps who help themselves. The sons of <lb/> France will fight the battles, but <i>He</i>
will give the <lb/> victory!"</p>
<p>You could see a light of admiration sweep the <lb/> house from face to face like a ray from the
sun. <lb/> Even the Dominican himself looked pleased, to see <lb/> his master-stroke so neatly
parried, and I heard a <lb/> venerable bishop mutter, in the phrasing common to <lb/> priest and
people in that robust time, "By God, the <lb/> child has said true. He willed that Goliath should
<lb/> be slain, and He sent a child like this to do it!"</p>
<p>Another day, when the inquisition had dragged <lb/> along until everybody looked drowsy and tired
but <lb/> Joan, Brother S&#x00E9;guin, professor of theology in the <lb/> University of Poitiers,
who was a sour and sarcastic <lb/> man, fell to plying Joan with all sorts of nagging <lb/>
questions in his bastard Limousin French&#x2014;for he <lb/> was from Limoges. Finally he said:</p>
<p>"How is it that you could understand those <lb/> angels? What language did they speak?"</p>
<p>"French."</p>
<p>"In-deed! How pleasant to know that our <lb/> language is so honored! Good French?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;perfect."</p>
<p>"Perfect, eh? Well, certainly <i>you</i> ought to know. <lb/> It was even better than your own,
eh?"</p>
<p>"As to that, I&#x2014;I believe I cannot say," said <lb/>
<pb n="189"/> she, and was going on, but stopped. Then she <lb/> added, almost as if she were saying
it to herself, <lb/> "Still, it was an improvement on yours!"</p>
<p>I knew there was a chuckle back of her eyes, for <lb/> all their innocence. Everybody shouted.
Brother <lb/> S&#x00E9;guin was nettled, and asked brusquely:</p>
<p>"Do you believe in God?"</p>
<p>Joan answered with an irritating nonchalance:</p>
<p>"Oh, well, yes&#x2014;better than you, it is likely."</p>
<p>Brother S&#x00E9;guin lost his patience, and heaped sar- <lb/> casm after sarcasm upon her, and
finally burst out in <lb/> angry earnest, exclaiming:</p>
<p>"Very well, I can tell you this, you whose belief <lb/> in God is so great: God has not willed
that any <lb/> shall believe in you without a sign. Where is your <lb/> sign?&#x2014;show it!"</p>
<p>This roused Joan, and she was on her feet in a <lb/> moment, and flung out her retort with
spirit:</p>
<p>"I have not come to Poitiers to show signs and do <lb/> miracles. Send me to Orleans and you
shall have <lb/> signs enough. Give me men-at-arms&#x2014;few or <lb/> many&#x2014;and let me
go!"</p>
<p>The fire was leaping from her eyes&#x2014;ah, the <lb/> heroic little figure! can't you see her?
There was <lb/> a great burst of acclamations, and she sat down <lb/> blushing, for it was not in
her delicate nature to like <lb/> being conspicuous.</p>
<p>This speech and that episode about the French <lb/> language scored two points against Brother
S&#x00E9;guin, <lb/> while he scored nothing against Joan; yet, sour man <lb/>
<pb n="190"/> as he was, he was a manly man, and honest, as you <lb/> can see by the histories; for
at the Rehabilitation he <lb/> could have hidden those unlucky incidents if he had <lb/> chosen, but
he didn't do it, but spoke them right <lb/> out in his evidence.</p>
<p>On one of the later days of that three-weeks ses- <lb/> sion the gowned scholars and professors
made one <lb/> grand assault all along the line, fairly overwhelming <lb/> Joan with objections and
arguments culled from the <lb/> writings of every ancient and illustrious authority of <lb/> the
Roman Church. She was well-nigh smothered; <lb/> but at last she shook herself free and struck back,
<lb/> crying out:</p>
<p>"Listen! The Book of God is worth more than <lb/> all these ye cite, and I stand upon <i>it</i>.
And I tell ye <lb/> there are things in that Book that not one among ye <lb/> can read, with all
your learning!"</p>
<p>From the first she was the guest, by invitation, of <lb/> the dame De Rabateau, wife of a
councilor of the <lb/> Parliament of Poitiers; and to that house the great <lb/> ladies of the city
came nightly to see Joan and talk <lb/> with her; and not these only, but the old lawyers, <lb/>
councilors, and scholars of the Parliament and the <lb/> University. And these grave men, accustomed
to <lb/> weigh every strange and questionable thing, and <lb/> cautiously consider it, and turn it
about this way and <lb/> that and still doubt it, came night after night, and <lb/> night after
night, falling ever deeper and deeper <lb/> under the influence of that mysterious something, <lb/>
that spell, that elusive and unwordable fascination, <lb/>
<pb n="191"/> which was the supremest endowment of Joan of Arc, <lb/> that winning and persuasive
and convincing something <lb/> which high and low alike recognized and felt, but <lb/> which neither
high nor low could explain or de- <lb/> scribe; and one by one they all surrendered, saying, <lb/>
"This child is sent of God."</p>
<p>All day long Joan, in the great court and subject <lb/> to its rigid rules of procedure, was at a
disadvantage; <lb/> her judges had things their own way; but at night <lb/> she held court herself,
and matters were reversed, <lb/> she presiding, with her tongue free and her same <lb/> judges there
before her. There could be but one <lb/> result: all the objections and hindrances they could <lb/>
build around her with their hard labors of the day <lb/> she would charm away at night. In the end,
she <lb/> carried her judges with her in a mass, and got her <lb/> great verdict without a
dissenting voice.</p>
<p>The court was a sight to see when the president of <lb/> it read it from his throne, for all the
great people of <lb/> the town were there who could get admission and <lb/> find room. First there
were some solemn cere- <lb/> monies, proper and usual at such times; then, when <lb/> there was
silence again, the reading followed, pene- <lb/> trating the deep hush so that every word was heard
<lb/> in even the remotest parts of the house:</p>
<p>"It is found, and is hereby declared, that Joan of <lb/> Arc, called the Maid, is a good
Christian and good <lb/> Catholic; that there is nothing in her person or her <lb/> words contrary
to the faith; and that the King may <lb/> and ought to accept the succor she offers; for to <lb/>
<pb n="192"/> repel it would be to offend the Holy Spirit, and <lb/> render him unworthy of the aid
of God."</p>
<p>The court rose, and then the storm of plaudits <lb/> burst forth unrebuked, dying down and
bursting <lb/> forth again and again, and I lost sight of Joan, for <lb/> she was swallowed up in a
great tide of people who <lb/> rushed to congratulate her and pour out benedictions <lb/> upon her
and upon the cause of France, now <lb/> solemnly and irrevocably delivered into her little <lb/>
hands.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="IX">
<pb n="193"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER IX.</b></head>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> was indeed a great day, and a stirring thing to <lb/> see.</p>
<p>She had won! It was a mistake of Tremouille and <lb/> her other ill-wishers to let her hold court
those <lb/> nights.</p>
<p>The commission of priests sent to Lorraine osten- <lb/> sibly to inquire into Joan's
character&#x2014;in fact to <lb/> weary her with delays and wear out her purpose and <lb/> make her
give it up&#x2014;arrived back and reported her <lb/> character perfect. Our affairs were in full
career <lb/> now, you see.</p>
<p>The verdict made a prodigious stir. Dead France <lb/> woke suddenly to life, wherever the great
news <lb/> traveled. Whereas before, the spiritless and cowed <lb/> people hung their heads and
slunk away if one men- <lb/> tioned war to them, now they came clamoring to be <lb/> enlisted under
the banner of the Maid of Vaucouleurs, <lb/> and the roaring of war songs and the thundering of
<lb/> the drums filled all the air. I remembered now what <lb/> she had said, that time there in our
village when I <lb/> proved by facts and statistics that France's case was <lb/> hopeless, and
nothing could ever rouse the people <lb/> from their lethargy:</p>
<pb n="194"/>
<p>"They will hear the drums&#x2014;and they will answer, <lb/> they will march!"</p>
<p>It has been said that misfortunes never come one <lb/> at a time, but in a body. In our case it
was the <lb/> same with good luck. Having got a start, it came <lb/> flooding in, tide after tide.
Our next wave of it was <lb/> of this sort. There had been grave doubts among <lb/> the priests as
to whether the Church ought to permit <lb/> a female soldier to dress like a man. But now came <lb/>
a verdict on that head. Two of the greatest scholars <lb/> and theologians of the time&#x2014;one of
whom had been <lb/> Chancellor of the University of Paris&#x2014;rendered it. <lb/> They decided
that since Joan "must do the work of <lb/> a man and a soldier, it is just and legitimate that her
<lb/> apparel should conform to the situation."</p>
<p>It was a great point gained, the Church's authority <lb/> to dress as a man. Oh, yes, wave on
wave the good <lb/> luck came sweeping in. Never mind about the <lb/> smaller waves, let us come to
the largest one of all, <lb/> the wave that swept us small fry quite off our feet <lb/> and almost
drowned us with joy. The day of the <lb/> great verdict, couriers had been despatched to the <lb/>
King with it, and the next morning bright and early <lb/> the clear notes of a bugle came floating
to us on the <lb/> crisp air, and we pricked up our ears and began to <lb/> count them.
One&#x2014;two&#x2014;three; pause; one&#x2014; <lb/> two; pause; one&#x2014;two&#x2014;three,
again&#x2014;and out we <lb/> skipped and went flying; for that formula was <lb/> used only when the
King's herald-at-arms would <lb/> deliver a proclamation to the people. As we hurried <lb/>
<pb n="195"/> along, people came racing out of every street and <lb/> house and alley, men, women,
and children, all <lb/> flushed, excited, and throwing lacking articles of <lb/> clothing on as they
ran; still those clear notes pealed <lb/> out, and still the rush of people increased till the whole
<lb/> town was abroad and streaming along the principal <lb/> street. At last we reached the square,
which was <lb/> now packed with citizens, and there, high on the <lb/> pedestal of the great cross,
we saw the herald in his <lb/> brilliant costume, with his servitors about him. The <lb/> next
moment he began his delivery in the powerful <lb/> voice proper to his office:</p>
<p>"Know all men, and take heed therefore, that the <lb/> most high, the most illustrious Charles,
by the grace <lb/> of God King of France, hath been pleased to confer <lb/> upon his well-beloved
servant Joan of Arc, called the <lb/> Maid, the title, emoluments, authorities, and dignity <lb/> of
General-in-Chief of the Armies of France&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Here a thousand caps flew into the air, and the <lb/> multitude burst into a hurricane of cheers
that raged <lb/> and raged till it seemed as if it would never come to <lb/> an end; but at last it
did; then the herald went on <lb/> and finished:</p>
<p>&#x2014;"and hath appointed to be her lieutenant and <lb/> chief of staff a prince of his royal
house, his grace <lb/> the Duke of Alen&#x00E7;on!"</p>
<p>That was the end, and the hurricane began again, <lb/> and was split up into innumerable strips
by the <lb/> blowers of it and wafted through all the lanes and <lb/> streets of the town.</p>
<pb n="196"/>
<p>General of the Armies of France, with a prince of <lb/> the blood for subordinate! Yesterday she
was noth- <lb/> ing&#x2014;to-day she was this. Yesterday she was not <lb/> even a sergeant, not
even a corporal, not even a <lb/> private&#x2014;to-day, with one step, she was at the top. <lb/>
Yesterday she was less than nobody to the newest <lb/> recruit&#x2014;to-day her command was law to
La Hire, <lb/> Saintrailles, the Bastard of Orleans, and all those <lb/> others, veterans of old
renown, illustrious masters of <lb/> the trade of war. These were the thoughts I was <lb/> thinking;
I was trying to realize this strange and <lb/> wonderful thing that had happened, you see.</p>
<p>My mind went traveling back, and presently lighted <lb/> upon a picture&#x2014;a picture which
was still so new <lb/> and fresh in my memory that it seemed a matter of <lb/> only
yesterday&#x2014;and indeed its date was no further <lb/> back than the first days of January. This
is what it <lb/> was. A peasant girl in a far-off village, her seven- <lb/> teenth year not yet
quite completed, and herself and <lb/> her village as unknown as if they had been on the <lb/> other
side of the globe. She had picked up a friend- <lb/> less wanderer somewhere and brought it
home&#x2014;a <lb/> small gray kitten in a forlorn and starving condition <lb/> &#x2014;and had fed
it and comforted it and got its con- <lb/> fidence and made it believe in her, and now it was <lb/>
curled up in her lap asleep, and she was knitting a <lb/> coarse stocking and
thinking&#x2014;dreaming&#x2014;about <lb/> what, one may never know. And now&#x2014;the kitten
<lb/> had hardly had time to become a cat, and yet already <lb/> the girl is General of the Armies
of France, with a <lb/>
<pb n="197"/> prince of the blood to give orders to, and out of her <lb/> village obscurity her name
has climbed up like the <lb/> sun and is visible from all corners of the land! It <lb/> made me
dizzy to think of these things, they were <lb/> so out of the common order, and seemed so impos-
<lb/> sible.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="X">
<pb n="198"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER X.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Joan's</smcap> first official act was to dictate a letter to <lb/> the English commanders
at Orleans, summon- <lb/> ing them to deliver up all strongholds in their pos- <lb/> session and
depart out of France. She must have <lb/> been thinking it all out before and arranging it in <lb/>
her mind, it flowed from her lips so smoothly, and <lb/> framed itself into such vivacious and
forcible lan- <lb/> guage. Still, it might not have been so; she always <lb/> had a quick mind and a
capable tongue, and her <lb/> faculties were constantly developing in these latter <lb/> weeks. This
letter was to be forwarded presently <lb/> from Blois. Men, provisions, and money were <lb/>
offering in plenty now, and Joan appointed Blois as <lb/> a recruiting station and depot of
supplies, and <lb/> ordered up La Hire from the front to take charge.</p>
<p>The Great Bastard&#x2014;him of the ducal house, and <lb/> governor of Orleans&#x2014;had been
clamoring for weeks <lb/> for Joan to be sent to him, and now came another <lb/> messenger, old
D'Aulon, a veteran officer, a trusty <lb/> man and fine and honest. The King kept him, and <lb/>
gave him to Joan to be chief of her household, and <lb/> commanded her to appoint the rest of her
people <lb/>
<pb n="199"/> herself, making their number and dignity accord <lb/> with the greatness of her
office; and at the same <lb/> time he gave order that they should be properly <lb/> equipped with
arms, clothing, and horses.</p>
<p>Meantime the King was having a complete suit <lb/> of armor made for her at Tours. It was of the
<lb/> finest steel, heavily plated with silver, richly orna- <lb/> mented with engraved designs, and
polished like a <lb/> mirror.</p>
<p>Joan's Voices had told her that there was an <lb/> ancient sword hidden somewhere behind the
altar of <lb/> St. Catherine's at Fierbois, and she sent De Metz to <lb/> get it. The priests knew
of no such sword, but a <lb/> search was made, and sure enough it was found in <lb/> that place,
buried a little way under the ground. It <lb/> had no sheath and was very rusty, but the priests
<lb/> polished it up and sent it to Tours, whither we were <lb/> now to come. They also had a sheath
of crimson <lb/> velvet made for it, and the people of Tours equipped <lb/> it with another one,
made of cloth of gold. But <lb/> Joan meant to carry this sword always in battle; so <lb/> she laid
the showy sheaths away and got one made <lb/> of leather. It was generally believed that this sword
<lb/> had belonged to Charlemagne, but that was only a <lb/> matter of opinion. I wanted to sharpen
that old <lb/> blade, but she said it was not necessary, as she <lb/> should never kill anybody, and
should carry it only <lb/> as a symbol of authority.</p>
<p>At Tours she designed her Standard, and a Scotch <lb/> painter named James Power made it. It was
of the <lb/>
<pb n="200"/> most delicate white <foreign lang="fre"><i>boucassin</i></foreign>, with fringes of
silk. <lb/> For device it bore the image of God the Father <lb/> throned in the clouds and holding
the world in His <lb/> hand; two angels knelt at His feet, presenting lilies; <lb/> inscription,
<smcap>Jesus, Maria</smcap>; on the reverse the crown <lb/> of France supported by two angels.</p>
<p>She also caused a smaller standard or pennon to <lb/> be made, whereon was represented an angel
offering <lb/> a lily to the Holy Virgin.</p>
<p>Everything was humming there at Tours. Every <lb/> now and then one heard the bray and crash of
mili- <lb/> tary music, every little while one heard the measured <lb/> tramp of marching
men&#x2014;squads of recruits leaving <lb/> for Blois; songs and shoutings and huzzas filled the
<lb/> air night and day, the town was full of strangers, <lb/> the streets and inns were thronged,
the bustle of <lb/> preparation was everywhere, and everybody carried <lb/> a glad and cheerful
face. Around Joan's head- <lb/> quarters a crowd of people was always massed, <lb/> hoping for a
glimpse of the new General, and when <lb/> they got it, they went wild; but they seldom got it,
<lb/> for she was busy planning her campaign, receiving <lb/> reports, giving orders, dispatching
couriers, and <lb/> giving what odd moments she could spare to the <lb/> companies of great folk
waiting in the drawing- <lb/> rooms. As for us boys, we hardly saw her at all, <lb/> she was so
occupied.</p>
<p>We were in a mixed state of mind&#x2014;sometimes <lb/> hopeful, sometimes not; mostly not. She
had not <lb/>
<pb n="201"/> appointed her household yet&#x2014;that was our trouble. <lb/> We knew she was being
overrun with applications <lb/> for places in it, and that these applications were <lb/> backed by
great names and weighty influence, <lb/> whereas we had nothing of the sort to recommend <lb/> us.
She could fill her humblest places with titled <lb/> folk&#x2014;folk whose relationships would be a
bulwark <lb/> for her and a valuable support at all times. In these <lb/> circumstances would policy
allow her to consider <lb/> us? We were not as cheerful as the rest of the <lb/> town, but were
inclined to be depressed and worried. <lb/> Sometimes we discussed our slim chances and gave <lb/>
them as good an appearance as we could. But the <lb/> very mention of the subject was anguish to the
<lb/> Paladin; for whereas we had some little hope, he <lb/> had none at all. As a rule, No&#x00EB;l
Rainguesson was <lb/> quite willing to let the dismal matter alone; but not <lb/> when the Paladin
was present. Once we were talk- <lb/> ing the thing over, when No&#x00EB;l said:</p>
<p>"Cheer up, Paladin; I had a dream last night, <lb/> and you were the only one among us that got
an <lb/> appointment. It wasn't a high one, but it was an <lb/> appointment, anyway&#x2014;some kind
of a lackey or <lb/> body-servant, or something of that kind."</p>
<p>The Paladin roused up and looked almost cheer- <lb/> ful; for he was a believer in dreams, and in
any- <lb/> thing and everything of a superstitious sort, in fact. <lb/> He said, with a rising
hopefulness:</p>
<p>"I wish it might come true. Do you think it will <lb/> come true?"</p>
<pb n="202"/>
<p>"Certainly; I might almost say I know it will, <lb/> for my dreams hardly ever fail."</p>
<p>"No&#x00EB;l, I could hug you if that dream could come <lb/> true, I could, indeed! To be servant
to the first <lb/> General of France and have all the world hear of it, <lb/> and the news go back
to the village and make those <lb/> gawks stare that always said I wouldn't ever amount <lb/> to
anything&#x2014;wouldn't it be great! Do you think <lb/> it <i>will</i> come true, No&#x00EB;l?
Don't you believe it will?"</p>
<p>"I do. There's my hand on it."</p>
<p>"No&#x00EB;l, if it comes true I'll never forget you&#x2014; <lb/> shake again! I should be
dressed in a noble livery, <lb/> and the news would go to the village, and those <lb/> animals would
say, '<i>Him</i>, lackey to the General-in- <lb/> Chief, with the eyes of the whole world on him,
<lb/> admiring&#x2014;well, he has shot up into the sky now, <lb/> hasn't he!'"</p>
<p>He began to walk the floor and pile castles in <lb/> the air so fast and so high that we could
hardly <lb/> keep up with him. Then all of a sudden all the joy <lb/> went out of his face and
misery took its place, and <lb/> he said:</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, it is all a mistake, it will never come <lb/> true. I forgot about that foolish
business at Toul. <lb/> I have kept out of her sight as much as I could, all <lb/> these weeks,
hoping she would forget that and for- <lb/> give it&#x2014;but I know she never will. She can't, of
<lb/> course. And, after all, I wasn't to blame. I did <lb/> say she promised to marry me, but they
put me up <lb/> to it and persuaded me, I swear they did!" The <lb/>
<pb n="203"/> vast creature was almost crying. Then he pulled <lb/> himself together and said,
remorsefully, "It was the <lb/> only lie I've ever told, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>He was drowned out with a chorus of groans and <lb/> outraged exclamations; and before he could
begin <lb/> again, one of D'Aulon's liveried servants appeared <lb/> and said we were required at
headquarters. We <lb/> rose, and No&#x00EB;l said:</p>
<p>"There&#x2014;what did I tell you? I have a presenti- <lb/> ment&#x2014;the spirit of prophecy is
upon me. She is <lb/> going to appoint him, and we are to go there and do <lb/> him homage. Come
along!"</p>
<p>But the Paladin was afraid to go, so we left him.</p>
<p>When we presently stood in the presence, in front <lb/> of a crowd of glittering officers of the
army, Joan <lb/> greeted us with a winning smile, and said she ap- <lb/> pointed all of us to places
in her household, for she <lb/> wanted her old friends by her. It was a beautiful <lb/> surprise to
have ourselves honored like this when <lb/> she could have had people of birth and consequence <lb/>
instead, but we couldn't find our tongues to say so, <lb/> she was become so great and so high above
us now. <lb/> One at a time we stepped forward and each received <lb/> his warrant from the hand of
our chief, D'Aulon. <lb/> All of us had honorable places; the two knights <lb/> stood highest; then
Joan's two brothers; I was first <lb/> page and secretary, a young gentleman named <lb/> Raimond was
second page; No&#x00EB;l was her messen- <lb/> ger; she had two heralds, and also a chaplain and
<lb/> almoner, whose name was Jean Pasquerel. She had <lb/>
<pb n="204"/> previously appointed a ma&#x00EE;tre d'h&#x00F4;tel and a number <lb/> of domestics.
Now she looked around and said:</p>
<p>"But where is the Paladin?"</p>
<p>The Sieur Bertrand said:</p>
<p>"He thought he was not sent for, your Excel- <lb/> lency."</p>
<p>"Now that is not well. Let him be called."</p>
<p>"The Paladin entered humbly enough. He ven- <lb/> tured no farther than just within the door. He
<lb/> stopped there, looking embarrassed and afraid. <lb/> Then Joan spoke pleasantly, and said:</p>
<p>"I watched you on the road. You began badly, <lb/> but improved. Of old you were a fantastic
talker, <lb/> but there is a man in you, and I will bring it out." <lb/> It was fine to see the
Paladin's face light up when <lb/> she said that. "Will you follow where I lead?"</p>
<p>"Into the fire!" he said; and I said to myself, <lb/> "By the ring of that, I think she has
turned this <lb/> braggart into a hero. It is another of her miracles, <lb/> I make no doubt of
it."</p>
<p>"I believe you," said Joan. "Here&#x2014;take my <lb/> banner. You will ride with me in every
field, and <lb/> when France is saved, you will give it me back."</p>
<p>He took the banner, which is now the most precious <lb/> of the memorials that remain of Joan of
Arc, and <lb/> his voice was unsteady with emotion when he said:</p>
<p>"If I ever disgrace this trust, my comrades here <lb/> will know how to do a friend's office upon
my body, <lb/> and this charge I lay upon them, as knowing they <lb/> will not fail me."</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Noel</smcap> and I went back together&#x2014;silent at first, <lb/> and impressed. Finally
No&#x00EB;l came up out of <lb/> his thinkings and said:</p>
<p>"The first shall be last and the last first&#x2014;there's <lb/> authority for this surprise. But
at the same time <lb/>
<i>wasn't</i> it a lofty hoist for our big bull!"</p>
<p>"It truly was; I am not over being stunned yet. <lb/> It was the greatest place in her gift."</p>
<p>"Yes, it was. There are many generals, and she <lb/> can create more; but there is only one
Standard- <lb/> Bearer."</p>
<p>"True. It is the most conspicuous place in the <lb/> army, after her own."</p>
<p>"And the most coveted and honorable. Sons of <lb/> two dukes tried to get it, as we know. And of
all <lb/> people in the world, this majestic windmill carries it <lb/> off. Well, isn't it a
gigantic promotion, when you <lb/> come to look at it!"</p>
<p>"There's no doubt about it. It's a kind of <lb/> copy of Joan's own in miniature."</p>
<p>"I don't know how to account for it&#x2014;do you?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;without any trouble at all&#x2014;that is, I <lb/> think I do."</p>
<pb n="206"/>
<p>No&#x00EB;l was surprised at that, and glanced up <lb/> quickly, as if to see if I was in
earnest. He <lb/> said:</p>
<p>"I thought you couldn't be in earnest, but I <lb/> see you are. If you can make me understand
this <lb/> puzzle, do it. Tell me what the explanation is."</p>
<p>"I believe I can. You have noticed that our <lb/> chief knight says a good many wise things and
has a <lb/> thoughtful head on his shoulders. One day, riding <lb/> along, we were talking about
Joan's great talents, <lb/> and he said, 'But, greatest of all her gifts, she has <lb/> the seeing
eye.' I said, like an unthinking fool, <lb/> 'The seeing eye?&#x2014;I shouldn't count that for much
<lb/> &#x2014;I suppose we all have it.' 'No,' he said; 'very <lb/> few have it.' Then he explained,
and made his <lb/> meaning clear. He said the common eye sees only <lb/> the outside of things, and
judges by that, but the <lb/> seeing eye pierces through and reads the heart and <lb/> the soul,
finding there capacities which the outside <lb/> didn't indicate or promise, and which the other
kind <lb/> of eye couldn't detect. He said the mightiest <lb/> military genius must fail and come to
nothing if it <lb/> have not the seeing eye&#x2014;that is to say, if it cannot <lb/> read men and
select its subordinates with an infallible <lb/> judgment. It sees as by intuition that this man is
<lb/> good for strategy, that one for dash and dare-devil <lb/> assault, the other for patient
bull-dog persistence, <lb/> and it appoints each to his right place and wins, <lb/> while the
commander without the seeing eye would <lb/> give to each the other's place and lose. He was right <lb/>
<pb n="207"/> about Joan, and I saw it. When she was a child <lb/> and the tramp came one night, her
father and all of <lb/> us took him for a rascal, but she saw the honest <lb/> man through the rags.
When I dined with the <lb/> governor of Vaucouleurs so long ago, I saw nothing <lb/> in our two
knights, though I sat with them and <lb/> talked with them two hours; Joan was there five <lb/>
minutes, and neither spoke with them nor heard <lb/> them speak, yet she marked them for men of
worth <lb/> and fidelity, and they have confirmed her judgment. <lb/> Whom has she sent for to take
charge of this <lb/> thundering rabble of new recruits at Blois, made up <lb/> of old disbanded
Armagnac raiders, unspeakable <lb/> hellions, every one? Why, she has sent for Satan <lb/>
himself&#x2014;that is to say, La Hire&#x2014;that military <lb/> hurricane, that godless
swashbuckler, that lurid con- <lb/> flagration of blasphemy, that Vesuvius of profanity, <lb/>
forever in eruption. Does he know how to deal <lb/> with that mob of roaring devils? Better than any
<lb/> man that lives; for he is the head devil of this world <lb/> his own self, he is the match of
the whole of them <lb/> combined, and probably the father of most of them. <lb/> She places him in
temporary command until she can <lb/> get to Blois herself&#x2014;and then! Why, then she <lb/> will
certainly take them in hand personally, or I <lb/> don't know her as well as I ought to, after all
these <lb/> years of intimacy. That will be a sight to see&#x2014; <lb/> that fair spirit in her
white armor, delivering her <lb/> will to that muck-heap, that rag-pile, that abandoned <lb/> refuse
of perdition."</p>
<pb n="208"/>
<p>"La Hire!" cried No&#x00EB;l, "our hero of all these <lb/> years&#x2014;I do want to see that
man!"</p>
<p>"I too. His name stirs me just as it did when I <lb/> was a little boy."</p>
<p>"I want to hear him swear."</p>
<p>"Of course. I would rather hear him swear than <lb/> another man pray. He is the frankest man
there is, <lb/> and the na&#x00EF;vest. Once when he was rebuked for <lb/> pillaging on his raids,
he said it was nothing. Said <lb/> he, 'If God the Father were a soldier, He would <lb/> rob.' I
judge he is the right man to take temporary <lb/> charge there at Blois. Joan has cast the seeing
eye <lb/> upon him, you see."</p>
<p>"Which brings us back to where we started. I <lb/> have an honest affection for the Paladin, and
not <lb/> merely because he is a good fellow, but because he <lb/> is my child&#x2014;I made him
what he is, the windiest <lb/> blusterer and most catholic liar in the kingdom. I'm <lb/> glad of
his luck, but I hadn't the seeing eye. I <lb/> shouldn't have chosen him for the most danger- <lb/>
ous post in the army, I should have placed him <lb/> in the rear to kill the wounded and violate the
<lb/> dead."</p>
<p>"Well, we shall see. Joan probably knows what <lb/> is in him better than we do. And I'll give
you <lb/> another idea. When a person in Joan of Arc's <lb/> position tells a man he is brave, he
<i>believes</i> it; and <lb/>
<i>believing</i> it is enough; in fact, to believe yourself <lb/> brave is to <i>be</i> brave; it is
the one only essential <lb/> thing."</p>
<pb n="209"/>
<p>"Now you've hit it!" cried No&#x00EB;l. "She's got <lb/> the creating mouth as well as the seeing
eye! Ah, <lb/> yes, that is the thing. France was cowed and a <lb/> coward; Joan of Arc has spoken,
and France is <lb/> marching, with her head up!"</p>
<p>I was summoned now to write a letter from Joan's <lb/> dictation. During the next day and night
our sev- <lb/> eral uniforms were made by the tailors, and our new <lb/> armor provided. We were
beautiful to look upon <lb/> now, whether clothed for peace or war. Clothed <lb/> for peace, in
costly stuffs and rich colors, the Paladin <lb/> was a tower dyed with the glories of the sunset;
<lb/> plumed and sashed and iron-clad for war, he was a <lb/> still statelier thing to look at.</p>
<p>Orders had been issued for the march toward <lb/> Blois. It was a clear, sharp, beautiful
morning. <lb/> As our showy great company trotted out in column, <lb/> riding two and two, Joan and
the Duke of Alen&#x00E7;on <lb/> in the lead, D'Aulon and the big standard-bearer <lb/> next, and so
on, we made a handsome spectacle, as <lb/> you may well imagine; and as we plowed through <lb/> the
cheering crowds, with Joan bowing her plumed <lb/> head to left and right and the sun glinting from
her <lb/> silver mail, the spectators realized that the curtain <lb/> was rolling up before their
eyes upon the first act of <lb/> a prodigious drama, and their rising hopes were ex- <lb/> pressed
in an enthusiasm that increased with each <lb/> moment, until at last one seemed to even physically
<lb/> feel the concussion of the huzzas as well as hear <lb/> them. Far down the street we heard the
softened <lb/>
<pb n="210"/> strains of wind-blown music, and saw a cloud of <lb/> lancers moving, the sun glowing
with a subdued <lb/> light upon the massed armor, but striking bright <lb/> upon the soaring
lance-heads&#x2014;a vaguely luminous <lb/> nebula, so to speak, with a constellation twinkling
<lb/> above it&#x2014;and that was our guard of honor. It <lb/> joined us, the procession was
complete, the first <lb/> war-march of Joan of Arc was begun, the curtain <lb/> was up.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XII">
<pb n="211"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>We</smcap> were at Blois three days. Oh, that camp, it <lb/> is one of the treasures of my
memory! <lb/> Order? There was no more order among those <lb/> brigands than there is among the
wolves and the <lb/> hyenas. They went roaring and drinking about, <lb/> whooping, shouting,
swearing, and entertaining <lb/> themselves with all manner of rude and riotous <lb/> horse-play;
and the place was full of loud and lewd <lb/> women, and they were no whit behind the men for <lb/>
romps and noise and fantastics.</p>
<p>It was in the midst of this wild mob that No&#x00EB;l and <lb/> I had our first glimpse of La
Hire. He answered to <lb/> our dearest dreams. He was of great size and of <lb/> martial bearing, he
was cased in mail from head to <lb/> heel, with a bushel of swishing plumes on his <lb/> helmet, and
at his side the vast sword of the time.</p>
<p>He was on his way to pay his respects in state to <lb/> Joan, and as he passed through the camp
he was <lb/> restoring order, and proclaiming that the Maid was <lb/> come, and he would have no
such spectacle as this <lb/> exposed to the head of the army. His way of <lb/> creating order was
his own, not borrowed. He did <lb/> it with his great fists. As he moved along swearing <lb/>
<pb n="212"/> and admonishing, he let drive this way, that way, <lb/> and the other, and wherever
his blow landed, a man <lb/> went down.</p>
<p>"Damn you!" he said, "staggering and cursing <lb/> around like this, and the Commander-in-Chief
in the <lb/> camp! Straighten up!" and he laid the man flat. <lb/> What his idea of straightening up
was, was his own <lb/> secret.</p>
<p>We followed the veteran to headquarters, listen- <lb/> ing, observing, admiring&#x2014;yes,
devouring, you may <lb/> say, the pet hero of the boys of France from our <lb/> cradles up to that
happy day, and their idol and <lb/> ours. I called to mind how Joan had once rebuked <lb/> the
Paladin, there in the pastures of Domremy, for <lb/> uttering lightly those mighty names, La Hire
and <lb/> the Bastard of Orleans, and how she said that if she <lb/> could but be permitted to stand
afar off and let her <lb/> eyes rest once upon those great men, she would <lb/> hold it a privilege.
They were to her and the other <lb/> girls just what they were to the boys. Well, here <lb/> was one
of them at last&#x2014;and what was his errand? <lb/> It was hard to realize it, and yet it was
true; he <lb/> was coming to uncover his head before her and take <lb/> her orders.</p>
<p>While he was quieting a considerable group of his <lb/> brigands in his soothing way, near
headquarters, we <lb/> stepped on ahead and got a glimpse of Joan's <lb/> military family, the great
chiefs of the army, for <lb/> they had all arrived now. There they were, six <lb/> officers of wide
renown, handsome men in beautiful <lb/>
<pb n="213"/> armor, but the Lord High Admiral of France was <lb/> the handsomest of them all and
had the most gallant <lb/> bearing.</p>
<p>When La Hire entered, one could see the surprise <lb/> in his face at Joan's beauty and extreme
youth, and <lb/> one could see, too, by Joan's glad smile, that it <lb/> made her happy to get sight
of this hero of her <lb/> childhood at last. La Hire bowed low, with his <lb/> helmet in his
gauntleted hand, and made a bluff but <lb/> handsome little speech with hardly an oath in it, and
<lb/> one could see that those two took to each other on <lb/> the spot.</p>
<p>The visit of ceremony was soon over, and the <lb/> others went away; but La Hire stayed, and he
and <lb/> Joan sat there, and he sipped her wine, and they <lb/> talked and laughed together like
old friends. And <lb/> presently she gave him some instructions, in his <lb/> quality as master of
the camp, which made his <lb/> breath stand still. For, to begin with, she said that <lb/> all those
loose women must pack out of the place at <lb/> once, she wouldn't allow one of them to remain.
<lb/> Next, the rough carousing must stop, drinking must <lb/> be brought within proper and strictly
defined limits, <lb/> and discipline must take the place of disorder. <lb/> And finally she climaxed
the list of surprises with <lb/> this&#x2014;which nearly lifted him out of his armor:</p>
<p>"Every man who joins my standard must confess <lb/> before the priest and absolve himself from
sin; and <lb/> all accepted recruits must be present at divine service <lb/> twice a day."</p>
<pb n="214"/>
<p>La Hire could not say a word for a good part of <lb/> a minute, then he said, in deep
dejection:</p>
<p>"Oh, sweet child, they were littered in hell, these <lb/> poor darlings of mine! Attend mass?
Why, dear <lb/> heart, they'll see us both damned first!"</p>
<p>And he went on, pouring out a most pathetic <lb/> stream of arguments and blasphemy, which broke
<lb/> Joan all up, and made her laugh as she had not <lb/> laughed since she played in the Domremy
pastures. <lb/> It was good to hear.</p>
<p>But she stuck to her point; so the soldier yielded, <lb/> and said all right, if such were the
orders he must <lb/> obey, and would do the best that was in him; then <lb/> he refreshed himself
with a lurid explosion of oaths, <lb/> and said that if any man in the camp refused to <lb/>
renounce sin and lead a pious life, he would knock <lb/> his head off. That started Joan off again;
she was <lb/> really having a good time, you see. But she would <lb/> not consent to that form of
conversions. She said <lb/> they must be voluntary.</p>
<p>La Hire said that that was all right, he wasn't <lb/> going to kill the voluntary ones, but only
the others.</p>
<p>No matter, none of them must be killed&#x2014;Joan <lb/> couldn't have it. She said that to give
a man a <lb/> chance to volunteer, on pain of death if he didn't, <lb/> left him more or less
trammeled, and she wanted <lb/> him to be entirely free.</p>
<p>So the soldier sighed and said he would advertise <lb/> the mass, but said he doubted if there
was a man in <lb/> camp that was any more likely to go to it than <lb/>
<pb n="215"/> he was himself. Then there was another surprise <lb/> for him, for Joan said:</p>
<p>"But, dear man, <i>you</i> are going!"</p>
<p>"I? Impossible! Oh, this is lunacy!"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, it isn't. You are going to the service <lb/> &#x2014;twice a day."</p>
<p>"Oh, am I dreaming? Am I drunk&#x2014;or is my <lb/> hearing playing me false? Why, I would
rather go <lb/> to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Never mind where. In the morning you are <lb/> going to begin, and after that it will come easy.
<lb/> Now <i>don't</i> look down-hearted like that. Soon you <lb/> won't mind it."</p>
<p>La Hire tried to cheer up, but he was not able to <lb/> do it. He sighed like a zephyr, and
presently said:</p>
<p>"Well, I'll do it for you, but before I would do <lb/> it for another, I swear I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"But don't swear. Break it off."</p>
<p>"Break it off? It is impossible. I beg you to&#x2014; <lb/> to&#x2014; Why&#x2014;oh, my General,
it is my native <lb/> speech!"</p>
<p>He begged so hard for grace for his impediment, <lb/> that Joan left him one fragment of it; she
said he <lb/> might swear by his b&#x00E2;ton, the symbol of his general- <lb/> ship.</p>
<p>He promised that he would swear only by his <lb/> b&#x00E2;ton when in her presence, and would
try to modify <lb/> himself elsewhere, but doubted if he could manage <lb/> it, now that it was so
old and stubborn a habit, and <lb/> such a solace and support to his declining years.</p>
<pb n="216"/>
<p>That tough old lion went away from there a good <lb/> deal tamed and civilized&#x2014;not to say
softened and <lb/> sweetened, for perhaps those expressions would <lb/> hardly fit him. No&#x00EB;l
and I believed that when he <lb/> was away from Joan's influence his old aversions <lb/> would come
up so strong in him that he could not <lb/> master them, and so wouldn't go to mass. But we <lb/>
got up early in the morning to see.</p>
<p>Well, he really went. It was hardly believable, <lb/> but there he was, striding along, holding
himself <lb/> grimly to his duty, and looking as pious as he could, <lb/> but growling and cursing
like a fiend. It was an- <lb/> other instance of the same old thing; whoever <lb/> listened to the
voice and looked into the eyes of <lb/> Joan of Arc fell under a spell, and was not his own <lb/>
man any more.</p>
<p>Satan was converted, you see. Well, the rest fol- <lb/> lowed. Joan rode up and down that camp,
and <lb/> wherever that fair young form appeared in its shining <lb/> armor, with that sweet face to
grace the vision and <lb/> perfect it, the rude host seemed to think they saw <lb/> the god of war
in person, descended out of the <lb/> clouds; and first they wondered, then they wor- <lb/> shiped.
After that, she could do with them what <lb/> she would.</p>
<p>In three days it was a clean camp and orderly, <lb/> and those barbarians were herding to divine
service <lb/> twice a day like good children. The women were <lb/> gone. La Hire was stunned by
these marvels; he <lb/> could not understand them. He went outside the <lb/>
<pb n="217"/> camp when he wanted to swear. He was that sort <lb/> of a man&#x2014;sinful by nature
and habit, but full of <lb/> superstitious respect for holy places.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of the reformed army for Joan, <lb/> its devotion to her, and the hot desire she
had <lb/> aroused in it to be led against the enemy, exceeded <lb/> any manifestations of this sort
which La Hire had <lb/> ever seen before in his long career. His admiration <lb/> of it all, and his
wonder over the mystery and <lb/> miracle of it, were beyond his power to put into <lb/> words. He
had held this army cheap before, but <lb/> his pride and confidence in it knew no limits now. <lb/>
He said:</p>
<p>"Two or three days ago it was afraid of a hen- <lb/> roost; one could storm the gates of hell
with it <lb/> now."</p>
<p>Joan and he were inseparable, and a quaint and <lb/> pleasant contrast they made. He was so big,
she <lb/> so little; he was so gray and so far along in his <lb/> pilgrimage of life, she so
youthful; his face was so <lb/> bronzed and scarred, hers so fair and pink, so <lb/> fresh and
smooth; she was so gracious, and he so <lb/> stern; she was so pure, so innocent, he such a <lb/>
cyclop&#x00E6;dia of sin. In her eye was stored all <lb/> charity and compassion, in his lightnings;
when her <lb/> glance fell upon you it seemed to bring benediction <lb/> and the peace of God, but
with his it was different, <lb/> generally.</p>
<p>They rode through the camp a dozen times a day, <lb/> visiting every corner of it, observing,
inspecting, <lb/>
<pb n="218"/> perfecting; and wherever they appeared the enthu- <lb/> siasm broke forth. They rode
side by side, he a <lb/> great figure of brawn and muscle, she a little master- <lb/> work of
roundness and grace; he a fortress of rusty <lb/> iron, she a shining statuette of silver; and when
the <lb/> reformed raiders and bandits caught sight of them <lb/> they spoke out, with affection and
welcome in their <lb/> voices, and said:</p>
<p>"There they come&#x2014;Satan and the Page of <lb/> Christ!"</p>
<p>All the three days that we were in Blois, Joan <lb/> worked earnestly and tirelessly to bring La
Hire to <lb/> God&#x2014;to rescue him from the bondage of sin&#x2014;to <lb/> breathe into his
stormy heart the serenity and peace <lb/> of religion. She urged, she begged, she implored <lb/> him
to pray. He stood out, the three days of our <lb/> stay, begging almost piteously to be let
off&#x2014;to be <lb/> let off from just that one thing, that impossible <lb/> thing; he would do
anything else&#x2014;anything&#x2014; <lb/> command, and he would obey&#x2014;he would go <lb/>
through the fire for her if she said the word&#x2014;but <lb/> spare him this, only this, for he
couldn't pray, had <lb/> never prayed, he was ignorant of how to frame a <lb/> prayer, he had no
words to put it in.</p>
<p>And yet&#x2014;can any believe it?&#x2014;she carried even <lb/> that point, she won that
incredible victory. She <lb/> made La Hire pray. It shows, I think, that nothing <lb/> was
impossible to Joan of Arc. Yes, he stood there <lb/> before her and put up his mailed hands and made
a <lb/> prayer. And it was not borrowed, but was his very <lb/>
<pb n="219"/> own; he had none to help him frame it, he made it <lb/> out of his own
head&#x2014;saying:</p>
<p>"Fair Sir God, I pray you to do by La Hire as <lb/> he would do by you if you were La Hire and he
<lb/> were God."<ref target="n1">*</ref><note id="n1" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"
>*</seg><p>This prayer has been stolen many times and by many nations in the <lb/> past four hundred
and sixty years, but it originated with La Hire, and <lb/> the fact is of official record in the
National Archives of France. We <lb/> have the authority of Michelet for
this.&#x2014;<smcap>Translator</smcap>.</p></note></p>
<p>Then he put on his helmet and marched out of <lb/> Joan's tent as satisfied with himself as any
one might <lb/> be who had arranged a perplexed and difficult <lb/> business to the content and
admiration of all the <lb/> parties concerned in the matter.</p>
<p>If I had known that he had been praying, I could <lb/> have understood why he was feeling so
superior, <lb/> but of course I could not know that.</p>
<p>I was coming to the tent at that moment, and saw <lb/> him come out, and saw him march away in
that <lb/> large fashion, and indeed it was fine and beautiful <lb/> to see. But when I got to the
tent door I stopped <lb/> and stepped back, grieved and shocked, for I <lb/> heard Joan crying, as I
mistakenly thought&#x2014;crying <lb/> as if she could not contain nor endure the anguish <lb/> of
her soul, crying as if she would die. But it <lb/> was not so, she was laughing&#x2014;laughing at
La <lb/> Hire's prayer.</p>
<p>It was not until six-and-thirty years afterwards <lb/> that I found that out, and then&#x2014;oh,
then I only <lb/> cried when that picture of young care-free mirth <lb/>
<pb n="220"/> rose before me out of the blur and mists of that <lb/> long-vanished time; for there
had come a day be- <lb/> tween, when God's good gift of laughter had gone <lb/> out from me to come
again no more in this life.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XIII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>We</smcap> marched out in great strength and splendor, <lb/> and took the road toward
Orleans. The <lb/> initial part of Joan's great dream was realizing itself <lb/> at last. It was the
first time that any of us young- <lb/> sters had ever seen an army, and it was a most <lb/> stately
and imposing spectacle to us. It was in- <lb/> deed an inspiring sight, that interminable column,
<lb/> stretching away into the fading distances, and curv- <lb/> ing itself in and out of the
crookedness of the road <lb/> like a mighty serpent. Joan rode at the head of it <lb/> with her
personal staff; then came a body of priests <lb/> singing the <i>Veni Creator</i>, the banner of the
Cross <lb/> rising out of their midst; after these the glinting <lb/> forest of spears. The several
divisions were com- <lb/> manded by the great Armagnac generals, La Hire, <lb/> the Marshal de
Boussac, the Sire de Retz, Florent <lb/> d'Illiers, and Poton de Saintrailles.</p>
<p>Each in his degree was tough, and there were <lb/> three degrees&#x2014;tough, tougher,
toughest&#x2014;and La <lb/> Hire was the last by a shade, but only a shade. <lb/> They were just
illustrious official brigands, the whole <lb/> party; and by long habits of lawlessness they had <lb/>
<pb n="222"/> lost all acquaintanceship with obedience, if they had <lb/> ever had any.</p>
<p>The King's strict orders to them had been, <lb/> "Obey the General-in-Chief in everything;
attempt <lb/> nothing without her knowledge, do nothing without <lb/> her command."</p>
<p>But what was the good of saying that? These <lb/> independent birds knew no law. They seldom
<lb/> obeyed the King; they never obeyed him when it <lb/> didn't suit them to do it. Would they
obey the <lb/> Maid? In the first place they wouldn't know <i>how</i>
<lb/> to obey her or anybody else, and in the second <lb/> place it was of course not possible for
them to take <lb/> her military character seriously&#x2014;that country girl of <lb/> seventeen who
had been trained for the complex <lb/> and terrible business of war&#x2014;how? By tending <lb/>
sheep.</p>
<p>They had no idea of obeying her except in cases <lb/> where their veteran military knowledge and
experi- <lb/> ence showed them that the thing she required was <lb/> sound and right when gauged by
the regular military <lb/> standards. Were they to blame for this attitude? <lb/> I should think
not. Old war-worn captains are <lb/> hard-headed, practical men. They do not easily <lb/> believe in
the ability of ignorant children to plan <lb/> campaigns and command armies. No general that <lb/>
ever lived could have taken Joan seriously (militarily) <lb/> before she raised the siege of Orleans
and followed <lb/> it with the great campaign of the Loire.</p>
<p>Did they consider Joan valueless? Far from it. <pb n="223"/> They valued her as the fruitful
earth values the <lb/> sun&#x2014;they fully believed she could produce the <lb/> crop, but that it
was in their line of business, not <lb/> hers, to take it off. They had a deep and supersti- <lb/>
tious reverence for her as being endowed with a <lb/> mysterious supernatural something that was
able to <lb/> do a mighty thing which they were powerless to <lb/> do&#x2014;blow the breath of life
and valor into the dead <lb/> corpses of cowed armies and turn them into heroes.</p>
<p>To their minds they were everything <i>with</i> her, <lb/> but nothing without her. She could
inspire the <lb/> soldiers and fit them for battle&#x2014;but fight the battle <lb/> herself? Oh,
nonsense&#x2014;that was their function. <lb/> They, the generals, would fight the battles, Joan
<lb/> would give the victory. That was their idea&#x2014;an <lb/> unconscious paraphrase of Joan's
reply to the <lb/> Dominican.</p>
<p>So they began by playing a deception upon her. <lb/> She had a clear idea of how she meant to
proceed. <lb/> It was her purpose to march boldly upon Orleans <lb/> by the north bank of the Loire.
She gave that <lb/> order to her generals. They said to themselves, <lb/> "The idea is
insane&#x2014;it is blunder No. 1; it is <lb/> what might have been expected of this child who is
<lb/> ignorant of war." They privately sent the word to <lb/> the Bastard of Orleans. He also
recognized the <lb/> insanity of it&#x2014;at least he thought he did&#x2014;and <lb/> privately
advised the generals to get around the <lb/> order in some way.</p>
<p>They did it by deceiving Joan. She trusted those <lb/>
<pb n="224"/> people, she was not expecting this sort of treat- <lb/> ment, and was not on the
lookout for it. It was a <lb/> lesson to her; she saw to it that the game was not <lb/> played a
second time.</p>
<p>Why was Joan's idea insane, from the generals' <lb/> point of view, but not from hers? Because
her <lb/> plan was to raise the siege immediately, by fighting, <lb/> while theirs was to besiege
the besiegers and starve <lb/> them out by closing their communications&#x2014;a plan <lb/> which
would require months in the consummation.</p>
<p>The English had built a fence of strong fortresses <lb/> called bastilles around
Orleans&#x2014;fortresses which <lb/> closed all the gates of the city but one. To the <lb/> French
generals the idea of trying to fight their way <lb/> past those fortresses and lead the army into
Orleans <lb/> was preposterous; they believed that the result <lb/> would be the army's destruction.
One may not <lb/> doubt that their opinion was militarily sound&#x2014;no, <lb/>
<i>would</i> have been, but for one circumstance which <lb/> they overlooked. That was this: the
English soldiers <lb/> were in a demoralized condition of superstitious <lb/> terror; they had
become satisfied that the Maid was <lb/> in league with Satan. By reason of this a good deal <lb/>
of their courage had oozed out and vanished. On <lb/> the other hand, the Maid's soldiers were full
of <lb/> courage, enthusiasm, and zeal.</p>
<p>Joan could have marched by the English forts. <lb/> However, it was not to be. She had been
cheated <lb/> out of her first chance to strike a heavy blow for her <lb/> country.</p>
<pb n="225"/>
<p>In camp that night she slept in her armor on the <lb/> ground. It was a cold night, and she was
nearly as <lb/> stiff as her armor itself when we resumed the march <lb/> in the morning, for iron
is not good material for a <lb/> blanket. However, her joy in being now so far on <lb/> her way to
the theater of her mission was fire enough <lb/> to warm her, and it soon did it.</p>
<p>Her enthusiasm and impatience rose higher and <lb/> higher with every mile of progress; but at
last we <lb/> reached Olivet, and down it went, and indignation <lb/> took its place. For she saw
the trick that had been <lb/> played upon her&#x2014;the river lay between us and <lb/> Orleans.</p>
<p>She was for attacking one of the three bastilles <lb/> that were on our side of the river and
forcing access <lb/> to the bridge which it guarded (a project which, if <lb/> successful, would
raise the siege instantly), but the <lb/> long-ingrained fear of the English came upon her <lb/>
generals and they implored her not to make the <lb/> attempt. The soldiers wanted to attack, but had
to <lb/> suffer disappointment. So we moved on and came <lb/> to a halt at a point opposite
Ch&#x00E9;cy, six miles above <lb/> Orleans.</p>
<p>Dunois, Bastard of Orleans, with a body of knights <lb/> and citizens, came up from the city to
welcome <lb/> Joan. Joan was still burning with resentment over <lb/> the trick that had been put
upon her, and was not <lb/> in the mood for soft speeches, even to revered mili- <lb/> tary idols of
her childhood. She said:</p>
<p>"Are you the Bastard of Orleans?"</p>
<pb n="226"/>
<p>"Yes, I am he, and am right glad of your <lb/> coming."</p>
<p>"And did you advise that I be brought by this <lb/> side of the river instead of straight to
Talbot and <lb/> the English?"</p>
<p>Her high manner abashed him, and he was not <lb/> able to answer with anything like a confident
prompt- <lb/> ness, but with many hesitations and partial excuses <lb/> he managed to get out the
confession that for what <lb/> he and the council had regarded as imperative mili- <lb/> tary
reasons they had so advised.</p>
<p>"In God's name," said Joan, "my Lord's coun- <lb/> sel is safer and wiser than yours. You thought
to <lb/> deceive me, but you have deceived yourselves, for I <lb/> bring you the best help that ever
knight or city had; <lb/> for it is God's help, not sent for love of me, but by <lb/> God's
pleasure. At the prayer of St. Louis and St. <lb/> Charlemagne He has had pity on Orleans, and will
<lb/> not suffer the enemy to have both the Duke of <lb/> Orleans and his city. The provisions to
save the <lb/> starving people are here, the boats are below the <lb/> city, the wind is contrary,
they cannot come up <lb/> hither. Now then tell me, in God's name, you <lb/> who are so wise, what
that council of yours was <lb/> thinking about, to invent this foolish difficulty."</p>
<p>Dunois and the rest fumbled around the matter a <lb/> moment, then gave in and conceded that a
blunder <lb/> had been made.</p>
<p>"Yes, a blunder has been made," said Joan, <lb/> "and except God take your proper work upon <lb/>
<pb n="227"/> Himself and change the wind and correct your <lb/> blunder for you, there is none else
that can devise a <lb/> remedy."</p>
<p>Some of those people began to perceive that with <lb/> all her technical ignorance she had
practical good <lb/> sense, and that with all her native sweetness and <lb/> charm she was not the
right kind of a person to <lb/> play with.</p>
<p>Presently God did take the blunder in hand, and <lb/> by His grace the wind did change. So the
fleet of <lb/> boats came up and went away loaded with provisions <lb/> and cattle, and conveyed
that welcome succor to the <lb/> hungry city, managing the matter successfully under <lb/>
protection of a sortie from the walls against the <lb/> bastille of St. Loup. Then Joan began on the
Bas- <lb/> tard again:</p>
<p>"You see here the army?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"It is here on this side by advice of your <lb/> council?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Now, in God's name, can that wise council ex- <lb/> plain why it is better to have it here than
it would <lb/> be to have it in the bottom of the sea?"</p>
<p>Dunois made some wandering attempts to explain <lb/> the inexplicable and excuse the inexcusable,
but <lb/> Joan cut him short and said:</p>
<p>"Answer me this, good sir&#x2014;has the army any <lb/> value on this side of the river?"</p>
<p>The Bastard confessed that it hadn't&#x2014;that is, in <lb/>
<pb n="228"/> view of the plan of campaign which she had devised <lb/> and decreed.</p>
<p>"And yet, knowing this, you had the hardihood <lb/> to disobey my orders. Since the army's place
is on <lb/> the other side, will you explain to me how it is to <lb/> get there?"</p>
<p>The whole size of the needless muddle was ap- <lb/> parent. Evasions were of no use; therefore
Dunois <lb/> admitted that there was no way to correct the blun- <lb/> der but to send the army all
the way back to Blois, <lb/> and let it begin over again and come up on the other <lb/> side this
time, according to Joan's original plan.</p>
<p>Any other girl, after winning such a triumph as <lb/> this over a veteran soldier of old renown,
might have <lb/> exulted a little and been excusable for it, but Joan <lb/> showed no disposition of
this sort. She dropped a <lb/> word or two of grief over the precious time that <lb/> must be lost,
then began at once to issue commands <lb/> for the march back. She sorrowed to see her army <lb/>
go; for she said its heart was great and its enthu- <lb/> siasm high, and that with it at her back
she did not <lb/> fear to face all the might of England.</p>
<p>All arrangements having been completed for the <lb/> return of the main body of the army, she
took the <lb/> Bastard and La Hire and a thousand men and went <lb/> down to Orleans, where all the
town was in a fever <lb/> of impatience to have sight of her face. It was <lb/> eight in the evening
when she and the troops rode <lb/> in at the Burgundy gate, with the Paladin preceding <lb/> her
with her standard. She was riding a white <lb/>
<pb n="229"/> horse, and she carried in her hand the sacred sword <lb/> of Fierbois. You should have
seen Orleans then. <lb/> What a picture it was! Such black seas of people, <lb/> such a starry
firmament of torches, such roaring <lb/> whirlwinds of welcome, such booming of bells and <lb/>
thundering of cannon! It was as if the world was <lb/> come to an end. Everywhere in the glare of
the <lb/> torches one saw rank upon rank of upturned white <lb/> faces, the mouths wide open,
shouting, and the <lb/> unchecked tears running down; Joan forged her <lb/> slow way through the
solid masses, her mailed form <lb/> projecting above the pavement of heads like a silver <lb/>
statue. The people about her struggled along, <lb/> gazing up at her through their tears with the
rapt <lb/> look of men and women who believe they are seeing <lb/> one who is divine; and always her
feet were being <lb/> kissed by grateful folk, and such as failed of that <lb/> privilege touched
her horse and then kissed their <lb/> fingers.</p>
<p>Nothing that Joan did escaped notice; everything <lb/> she did was commented upon and applauded.
You <lb/> could hear the remarks going all the time.</p>
<p>"There&#x2014;she's smiling&#x2014;see!"</p>
<p>"Now she's taking her little plumed cap off to <lb/> somebody&#x2014;ah, it's fine and
graceful!"</p>
<p>"She's patting that woman on the head with her <lb/> gauntlet."</p>
<p>"Oh, she was born on a horse&#x2014;see her turn in <lb/> her saddle, and kiss the hilt of her
sword to the <lb/> ladies in the window that threw the flowers down."</p>
<pb n="230"/>
<p>"Now there's a poor woman lifting up a child&#x2014; <lb/> she's kissed it&#x2014;oh, she's
divine!"</p>
<p>"What a dainty little figure it is, and what a <lb/> lovely face&#x2014;and such color and
animation!"</p>
<p>Joan's slender long banner streaming backward <lb/> had an accident&#x2014;the fringe caught fire
from a <lb/> torch. She leaned forward and crushed the flame <lb/> in her hand.</p>
<p>"She's not afraid of fire nor anything!" they <lb/> shouted, and delivered a storm of admiring
applause <lb/> that made everything quake.</p>
<p>She rode to the cathedral and gave thanks to <lb/> God, and the people crammed the place and
added <lb/> their devotions to hers; then she took up her march <lb/> again and picked her slow way
through the crowds <lb/> and the wilderness of torches to the house of Jacques <lb/> Boucher,
treasurer of the Duke of Orleans, where <lb/> she was to be the guest of his wife as long as she
<lb/> stayed in the city, and have his young daughter for <lb/> comrade and room-mate. The delirium
of the peo- <lb/> ple went on the rest of the night, and with it the <lb/> clamor of the joy-bells
and the welcoming cannon.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc had stepped upon her stage at last, <lb/> and was ready to begin.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XIV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>She</smcap> was ready, but must sit down and wait until <lb/> there was an army to work
with.</p>
<p>Next morning, Saturday, April 30, 1429, she set <lb/> about inquiring after the messenger who
carried her <lb/> proclamation to the English from Blois&#x2014;the one <lb/> which she had dictated
at Poitiers. Here is a copy <lb/> of it. It is a remarkable document, for several <lb/> reasons: for
its matter-of-fact directness, for its <lb/> high spirit and forcible diction, and for its
na&#x00EF;ve <lb/> confidence in her ability to achieve the prodigious <lb/> task which she had laid
upon herself, or which had <lb/> been laid upon her&#x2014;which you please. All through <lb/> it
you seem to see the pomps of war and hear the <lb/> rumbling of the drums. In it Joan's warrior soul
is <lb/> revealed, and for the moment the soft little shep- <lb/> herdess has disappeared from your
view. This un- <lb/> taught country damsel, unused to dictating anything <lb/> at all to anybody,
much less documents of state to <lb/> kings and generals, poured out this procession of <lb/>
vigorous sentences as fluently as if this sort of work <lb/> had been her trade from childhood:</p>
<pb n="232"/>
<q><p rend="center">"JESUS MARIA</p>
<p>"King of England, and you Duke of Bedford who call yourself <lb/> Regent of France; William de la
Pole, Earl of Suffolk; and you Thomas <lb/> Lord Scales, who style yourselves lieutenants of the
said Bedford&#x2014;do <lb/> right to the King of Heaven. Render to the Maid who is sent by God
<lb/> the keys of all the good towns you have taken and violated in France. <lb/> She is sent hither
by God to restore the blood royal. She is very ready <lb/> to make peace if you will do her right by
giving up France and paying <lb/> for what you have held. And you archers, companions of war, noble
<lb/> and otherwise, who are before the good city of Orleans, begone into your <lb/> own land in
God's name, or expect news from the Maid who will shortly <lb/> go to see you to your very great
hurt. King of England, if you do not <lb/> so, I am chief of war, and wherever I shall find your
people in France I <lb/> will drive them out, willing or not willing; and if they do not obey I
<lb/> will slay them all, but if they obey, I will have them to mercy. I am <lb/> come hither by
God, the King of Heaven, body for body, to put you out <lb/> of France, in spite of those who would
work treason and mischief <lb/> against the kingdom. Think not you shall ever hold the kingdom from
<lb/> the King of Heaven, the Son of the blessed Mary; King Charles shall <lb/> hold it, for God
wills it so, and has revealed it to him by the Maid. If <lb/> you believe not the news sent by God
through the Maid, wherever we <lb/> shall meet you we will strike boldly and make such a noise as
has not <lb/> been in France these thousand years. Be sure that God can send more <lb/> strength to
the Maid than you can bring to any assault against her and <lb/> her good men-at-arms; and then we
shall see who has the better right, <lb/> the King of Heaven, or you. Duke of Bedford, the Maid
prays you not <lb/> to bring about your own destruction. If you do her right, you may yet <lb/> go
in her company where the French shall do the finest deed that has <lb/> been done in Christendom,
and if you do not, you shall be reminded <lb/> shortly of your great wrongs."</p></q>
<p>In that closing sentence she invites them to go on <lb/> crusade with her to rescue the Holy
Sepulchre. No <lb/> answer had been returned to this proclamation, and <lb/> the messenger himself
had not come back.</p>
<p>So now she sent her two heralds with a new letter <lb/> warning the English to raise the siege
and requiring <lb/>
<pb n="233"/> them to restore that missing messenger. The heralds <lb/> came back without him. All
they brought was <lb/> notice from the English to Joan that they would <lb/> presently catch her and
burn her if she did not clear <lb/> out now while she had a chance, and "go back to <lb/> her proper
trade of minding cows."</p>
<p>She held her peace, only saying it was a pity that <lb/> the English would persist in inviting
present disaster <lb/> and eventual destruction when she was "doing all <lb/> she could to get them
out of the country with their <lb/> lives still in their bodies."</p>
<p>Presently she thought of an arrangement that <lb/> might be acceptable, and said to the heralds,
"Go <lb/> back and say to Lord Talbot this, from me: 'Come <lb/> out of your bastilles with your
host, and I will come <lb/> with mine; if I beat you, go in peace out of France; <lb/> if you beat
me, burn me, according to your desire.'"</p>
<p>I did not hear this, but Dunois did, and spoke of <lb/> it. The challenge was refused.</p>
<p>Sunday morning her Voices or some instinct gave <lb/> her a warning, and she sent Dunois to Blois
to take <lb/> command of the army and hurry it to Orleans. It <lb/> was a wise move, for he found
Regnault de Chartres <lb/> and some more of the King's pet rascals there trying <lb/> their best to
disperse the army, and crippling all <lb/> the efforts of Joan's generals to head it for Orleans.
<lb/> They were a fine lot, those miscreants. They turned <lb/> their attention to Dunois now, but
he had balked <lb/> Joan once, with unpleasant results to himself, and <lb/> was not minded to
meddle in that way again. He <lb/> soon had the army moving.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XV">
<pb n="234"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>We</smcap> of the personal staff were in fairy-land now, <lb/> during the few days that we
waited for the re- <lb/> turn of the army. We went into society. To our <lb/> two knights this was
not a novelty, but to us young <lb/> villagers it was a new and wonderful life. Any posi- <lb/> tion
of any sort near the person of the Maid of <lb/> Vaucouleurs conferred high distinction upon the
<lb/> holder and caused his society to be courted; and so <lb/> the D'Arc brothers, and No&#x00EB;l,
and the Paladin, <lb/> humble peasants at home, were gentlemen here, <lb/> personages of weight and
influence. It was fine to <lb/> see how soon their country diffidences and awkward- <lb/> nesses
melted away under this pleasant sun of defer- <lb/> ence and disappeared, and how lightly and easily
<lb/> they took to their new atmosphere. The Paladin <lb/> was as happy as it was possible for any
one in this <lb/> earth to be. His tongue went all the time, and daily <lb/> he got new delight out
of hearing himself talk. He <lb/> began to enlarge his ancestry and spread it out all <lb/> around,
and ennoble it right and left, and it was not <lb/> long until it consisted almost entirely of
dukes. He <lb/> worked up his old battles and tricked them out with <lb/>
<pb n="235"/> fresh splendors; also with new terrors, for he added <lb/> artillery now. We had seen
cannon for the first <lb/> time at Blois&#x2014;a few pieces&#x2014;here there was plenty <lb/> of
it, and now and then we had the impressive spec- <lb/> tacle of a huge English bastille hidden from
sight in <lb/> a mountain of smoke from its own guns, with lances <lb/> of red flame darting through
it; and this grand <lb/> picture, along with the quaking thunders pounding <lb/> away in the heart
of it, inflamed the Paladin's imagi- <lb/> nation and enabled him to dress out those ambuscade-
<lb/> skirmishes of ours with a sublimity which made it <lb/> impossible for any to recognize them
at all except <lb/> people who had not been there.</p>
<p>You may suspect that there was a special inspira- <lb/> tion for these great efforts of the
Paladin's, and <lb/> there was. It was the daughter of the house, <lb/> Catherine Boucher, who was
eighteen, and gentle <lb/> and lovely in her ways, and very beautiful. I think <lb/> she might have
been as beautiful as Joan herself, if <lb/> she had had Joan's eyes. But that could never be. <lb/>
There was never but that one pair, there will never <lb/> be another. Joan's eyes were deep and rich
and <lb/> wonderful beyond anything merely earthly. They <lb/> spoke all the languages&#x2014;they
had no need of <lb/> words. They produced all effects&#x2014;and just by a <lb/> glance, just a
single glance; a glance that could con- <lb/> vict a liar of his lie and make him confess it; that
<lb/> could bring down a proud man's pride and make <lb/> him humble; that could put courage into a
coward <lb/> and strike dead the courage of the bravest; that <lb/>
<pb n="236"/> could appease resentments and real hatreds; that <lb/> could speak peace to storms of
passion and be <lb/> obeyed; that could make the doubter believe and <lb/> the hopeless hope again;
that could purify the im- <lb/> pure mind; that could persuade&#x2014;ah, there it is&#x2014; <lb/>
<i>persuasion!</i> that is the word; what or who is it that <lb/> it couldn't persuade? The maniac
of Domremy&#x2014; <lb/> the fairy-banishing priest&#x2014;the reverend tribunal of <lb/>
Toul&#x2014;the doubting and superstitious Laxart&#x2014;the <lb/> obstinate veteran of
Vaucouleurs&#x2014;the characterless <lb/> heir of France&#x2014;the sages and scholars of the Par-
<lb/> liament and University of Poitiers&#x2014;the darling of <lb/> Satan, La Hire&#x2014;the
masterless Bastard of Orleans, <lb/> accustomed to acknowledge no way as right and <lb/> rational
but his own&#x2014;these were the trophies of <lb/> that great gift that made her the wonder and
mys- <lb/> tery that she was.</p>
<p>We mingled companionably with the great folk <lb/> who flocked to the big house to make Joan's
ac- <lb/> quaintance, and they made much of us and we lived <lb/> in the clouds, so to speak. But
what we preferred <lb/> even to this happiness was the quieter occasions, <lb/> when the formal
guests were gone and the family <lb/> and a few dozen of its familiar friends were gathered <lb/>
together for a social good time. It was then that <lb/> we did our best, we five youngsters, with
such fasci- <lb/> nations as we had, and the chief object of them was <lb/> Catherine. None of us
had ever been in love before, <lb/> and now we had the misfortune to all fall in love <lb/> with the
same person at the same time&#x2014;which was <lb/>
<pb n="237"/> the first moment we saw her. She was a merry <lb/> heart, and full of life, and I
still remember tenderly <lb/> those few evenings that I was permitted to have my <lb/> share of her
dear society and of comradeship with <lb/> that little company of charming people.</p>
<p>The Paladin made us all jealous the first night, for <lb/> when he got fairly started on those
battles of his he <lb/> had everything to himself, and there was no use in <lb/> anybody else's
trying to get any attention. Those <lb/> people had been living in the midst of real war for <lb/>
seven months; and to hear this windy giant lay out <lb/> his imaginary campaigns and fairly swim in
blood <lb/> and spatter it all around, entertained them to the <lb/> verge of the grave. Catherine
was like to die, for <lb/> pure enjoyment. She didn't laugh loud&#x2014;we, of <lb/> course, wished
she would&#x2014;but kept in the shelter <lb/> of a fan, and shook until there was danger that she
<lb/> would unhitch her ribs from her spine. Then when <lb/> the Paladin had got done with a battle
and we began <lb/> to feel thankful and hope for a change, she would <lb/> speak up in a way that
was so sweet and persuasive <lb/> that it rankled in me, and ask him about some detail <lb/> or
other in the early part of his battle which she said <lb/> had greatly interested her, and would he
be so good <lb/> as to describe that part again and with a little more <lb/>
particularity?&#x2014;which of course precipitated the <lb/> whole battle on us again, with a
hundred lies added <lb/> that had been overlooked before.</p>
<p>I do not know how to make you realize the pain <lb/> I suffered. I had never been jealous before,
and it <lb/>
<pb n="238"/> seemed intolerable that this creature should have <lb/> this good fortune which he was
so ill entitled to, and <lb/> I have to sit and see myself neglected when I was so <lb/> longing for
the least little attention out of the thou- <lb/> sand that this beloved girl was lavishing upon
him. <lb/> I was near her, and tried two or three times to get <lb/> started on some of the things
that <i>I</i> had done in <lb/> those battles&#x2014;and I felt ashamed of myself, too, <lb/> for
stooping to such a business&#x2014;but she cared for <lb/> nothing but his battles, and could not be
got to <lb/> listen; and presently when one of my attempts caused <lb/> her to lose some precious
rag or other of his men- <lb/> dacities and she asked him to repeat, thus bringing <lb/> on a new
engagement, of course, and increasing the <lb/> havoc and carnage tenfold, I felt so humiliated by
<lb/> this pitiful miscarriage of mine that I gave up and <lb/> tried no more.</p>
<p>The others were as outraged by the Paladin's <lb/> selfish conduct as I was&#x2014;and by his
grand luck, <lb/> too, of course&#x2014;perhaps, indeed, that was the main <lb/> hurt. We talked our
trouble over together, which <lb/> was but natural, for rivals become brothers when a <lb/> common
affliction assails them and a common enemy <lb/> bears off the victory.</p>
<p>Each of us could do things that would please and <lb/> get notice if it were not for this person,
who occu- <lb/> pied all the time and gave others no chance. I had <lb/> made a poem, taking a whole
night to it&#x2014;a poem <lb/> in which I most happily and delicately celebrated <lb/> that sweet
girl's charms, without mentioning her <lb/>
<pb n="239"/> name, but any one could see who was meant; for <lb/> the bare title&#x2014;"The Rose
of Orleans"&#x2014;would <lb/> reveal that, as it seemed to me. It pictured this pure <lb/> and
dainty white rose as growing up out of the rude <lb/> soil of war and looking abroad out of its
tender eyes <lb/> upon the horrid machinery of death, and then&#x2014; <lb/> note this
conceit&#x2014;it blushes for the sinful nature of <lb/> man, and <i>turns red</i> in a single
night. Becomes a <lb/> red rose, you see&#x2014;a rose that was white before. <lb/> The idea was my
own, and quite new. Then it <lb/> sent its sweet perfume out over the embattled city, <lb/> and when
the beleaguering forces smelt it they <i>laid <lb/> down their arms and wept</i>. This was also my
own <lb/> idea, and new. That closed that part of the poem; <lb/> then I put her into the similitude
of the firmament&#x2014; <lb/> not the whole of it, but only part. That is to say, <lb/> she was the
moon, and all the constellations were <lb/> following her about, their hearts in flames for love
<lb/> of her, but she would not halt, she would not listen, <lb/> for 'twas thought she loved
another. 'Twas thought <lb/> she loved a poor unworthy suppliant who was upon <lb/> the earth,
facing danger, death, and possible mutila- <lb/> tion in the bloody field, waging relentless war
against <lb/> a heartless foe to save her from an all too early <lb/> grave, and her city from
destruction. And when <lb/> the sad pursuing constellations came to know and <lb/> realize the
bitter sorrow that was come upon them&#x2014; <lb/> note this idea&#x2014;their hearts broke and
their tears <lb/> gushed forth, filling the vault of heaven with a fiery <lb/> splendor, for those
tears were <i>falling stars</i>. It was <lb/>
<pb n="240"/> a rash idea, but beautiful; beautiful and pathetic; <lb/> wonderfully pathetic, the
way I had it, with the <lb/> rhyme and all to help. At the end of each verse <lb/> there was a
two-line refrain pitying the poor earthly <lb/> lover separated so far, and perhaps forever, from
<lb/> her he loved so well, and growing always paler and <lb/> weaker and thinner in his agony as he
neared the <lb/> cruel grave&#x2014;the most touching thing&#x2014;even the <lb/> boys themselves
could hardly keep back their tears, <lb/> the way No&#x00EB;l said those lines. There were eight
<lb/> four-line stanzas in the first end of the poem&#x2014;the <lb/> end about the rose, the
horticultural end, as you <lb/> may say, if that is not too large a name for such a <lb/> little
poem&#x2014;and eight in the astronomical end&#x2014; <lb/> sixteen stanzas altogether, and I could
have made it <lb/> a hundred and fifty if I had wanted to, I was so <lb/> inspired and so all
swelled up with beautiful thoughts <lb/> and fancies; but that would have been too many to <lb/>
sing or recite before a company that way, whereas <lb/> sixteen was just right, and could be done
over again <lb/> if desired.</p>
<p>The boys were amazed that I could make such a <lb/> poem as that out of my own head, and so was
I, of <lb/> course, it being as much a surprise to me as it could <lb/> be to anybody, for I did not
know that it was in <lb/> me. If any had asked me a single day before if it <lb/> was in me, I
should have told them frankly no, it <lb/> was not.</p>
<p>That is the way with us; we may go on half of <lb/> our life not knowing such a thing is in us,
when in <lb/>
<pb n="241"/> reality it was there all the time, and all we needed <lb/> was something to turn up
that would call for it. <lb/> Indeed, it was always so with our family. My <lb/> grandfather had a
cancer, and they never knew what <lb/> was the matter with him till he died, and he didn't <lb/>
himself. It is wonderful how gifts and diseases can <lb/> be concealed that way. All that was
necessary in <lb/> my case was for this lovely and inspiring girl to <lb/> cross my path, and out
came the poem, and no <lb/> more trouble to me to word it and rhyme it and <lb/> perfect it than it
is to stone a dog. No, I should <lb/> have said it was not in me; but it was.</p>
<p>The boys couldn't say enough about it, they were <lb/> so charmed and astonished. The thing that
pleased <lb/> them the most was the way it would do the Paladin's <lb/> business for him. They
forgot everything in their <lb/> anxiety to get him shelved and silenced. No&#x00EB;l <lb/>
Rainguesson was clear beside himself with admiration <lb/> of the poem, and wished <i>he</i> could
do such a thing, <lb/> but it was out of his line and he couldn't, of course. <lb/> He had it by
heart in half an hour, and there was <lb/> never anything so pathetic and beautiful as the way <lb/>
he recited it. For that was just his gift&#x2014;that and <lb/> mimicry. He could recite anything
better than any- <lb/> body in the world, and he could take off La Hire to <lb/> the very
life&#x2014;or anybody else, for that matter. <lb/> Now I never could recite worth a farthing; and
<lb/> when I tried with this poem the boys wouldn't let <lb/> me finish; they would have nobody but
No&#x00EB;l. So <lb/> then, as I wanted the poem to make the best possi- <lb/>
<pb n="242"/> ble impression on Catherine and the company, I told <lb/> No&#x00EB;l he might do the
reciting. Never was anybody <lb/> so delighted. He could hardly believe that I was in <lb/> earnest,
but I was. I said that to have them know <lb/> that I was the author of it would be enough for me.
<lb/> The boys were full of exultation, and No&#x00EB;l said if <lb/> he could just get one chance
at those people it <lb/> would be all he would ask; he would make them <lb/> realize that there was
something higher and finer <lb/> than war-lies to be had here.</p>
<p>But how to get the opportunity&#x2014;that was the <lb/> difficulty. We invented several schemes
that prom- <lb/> ised fairly, and at last we hit upon one that was <lb/> sure. That was, to let the
Paladin get a good start <lb/> in a manufactured battle, and then send in a false <lb/> call for
him, and as soon as he was out of the room, <lb/> have No&#x00EB;l take his place and finish the
battle him- <lb/> self in the Paladin's own style, imitated to a shade. <lb/> That would get great
applause, and win the house's <lb/> favor and put it in the right mood to hear the poem. <lb/> The
two triumphs together would finish the Standard- <lb/> Bearer&#x2014;modify him, anyway, to a
certainty, and <lb/> give the rest of us a chance for the future.</p>
<p>So the next night I kept out of the way until the <lb/> Paladin had got his start and was
sweeping down <lb/> upon the enemy like a whirlwind at the head of his <lb/> corps, then I stepped
within the door in my official <lb/> uniform and announced that a messenger from Gen- <lb/> eral La
Hire's quarters desired speech with the <lb/> Standard-Bearer. He left the room, and No&#x00EB;l
took <lb/>
<pb n="243"/> his place and said that the interruption was to be <lb/> deplored, but that
fortunately he was personally ac- <lb/> quainted with the details of the battle himself, and if
<lb/> permitted would be glad to state them to the com- <lb/> pany. Then without waiting for the
permission he <lb/> turned himself into the Paladin&#x2014;a dwarfed Paladin, <lb/> of
course&#x2014;with manner, tones, gestures, attitudes, <lb/> everything exact, and went right on
with the battle, <lb/> and it would be impossible to imagine a more per- <lb/> fectly and minutely
ridiculous imitation than he <lb/> furnished to those shrieking people. They went <lb/> into spasms,
convulsions, frenzies of laughter, and <lb/> the tears flowed down their cheeks in rivulets. The
<lb/> more they laughed, the more inspired No&#x00EB;l grew with <lb/> his theme and the greater the
marvels he worked, till <lb/> really the laughter was not properly laughing any <lb/> more, but
screaming. Blessedest feature of all, <lb/> Catherine Boucher was dying with ecstasies, and <lb/>
presently there was little left of her but gasps and <lb/> suffocations. Victory? It was a perfect
Agincourt.</p>
<p>The Paladin was gone only a couple of minutes; <lb/> he found out at once that a trick had been
played <lb/> on him, so he came back. When he approached <lb/> the door he heard No&#x00EB;l ranting
in there and recog- <lb/> nized the state of the case; so he remained near the <lb/> door but out of
sight, and heard the performance <lb/> through to the end. The applause No&#x00EB;l got when <lb/>
he finished was wonderful; and they kept it up and <lb/> kept it up, clapping their hands like mad,
and <lb/> shouting to him to do it over again.</p>
<pb n="244"/>
<p>But No&#x00EB;l was clever. He knew the very best <lb/> background for a poem of deep and refined
senti- <lb/> ment and pathetic melancholy was one where great <lb/> and satisfying merriment has
prepared the spirit for <lb/> the powerful contrast.</p>
<p>So he paused until all was quiet, then his face <lb/> grew grave and assumed an impressive
aspect, and <lb/> at once all faces sobered in sympathy and took on a <lb/> look of wondering and
expectant interest. Now he <lb/> began in a low but distinct voice the opening verses <lb/> of The
Rose. As he breathed the rhythmic meas- <lb/> ures forth, and one gracious line after another fell
<lb/> upon those enchanted ears in that deep hush, one <lb/> could catch, on every hand,
half-audible ejaculations <lb/> of "How lovely&#x2014;how beautiful&#x2014;how exquisite."</p>
<p>By this time the Paladin, who had gone away for <lb/> a moment with the opening of the poem, was
back <lb/> again, and had stepped within the door. He stood <lb/> there now, resting his great frame
against the wall <lb/> and gazing toward the reciter like one entranced. <lb/> When No&#x00EB;l got
to the second part, and that heart- <lb/> breaking refrain began to melt and move all listeners,
<lb/> the Paladin began to wipe away tears with the back <lb/> of first one hand and then the other.
The next <lb/> time the refrain was repeated he got to snuffling, <lb/> and sort of half sobbing,
and went to wiping his <lb/> eyes with the sleeves of his doublet. He was so <lb/> conspicuous that
he embarrassed No&#x00EB;l a little, and <lb/> also had an ill effect upon the audience. With the
<lb/> next repetition he broke quite down and began to <lb/>
<pb n="245"/> cry like a calf, which ruined all the effect and started <lb/> many in the audience to
laughing. Then he went <lb/> on from bad to worse, until I never saw such a <lb/> spectacle; for he
fetched out a towel from under his <lb/> doublet and began to swab his eyes with it and let <lb/> go
the most infernal bellowings mixed up with sob- <lb/> bings and groanings and retchings and barkings
<lb/> and coughings and snortings and screamings and <lb/> howlings&#x2014;and he twisted himself
about on his <lb/> heels and squirmed this way and that, still pouring <lb/> out that brutal clamor
and flourishing his towel in <lb/> the air and swabbing again and wringing it out. <lb/> Hear? You
couldn't hear yourself think. No&#x00EB;l <lb/> was wholly drowned out and silenced, and those <lb/>
people were laughing the very lungs out of them- <lb/> selves. It was the most degrading sight that
ever <lb/> was. Now I heard the clankety-clank that plate- <lb/> armor makes when the man that is in
it is running, <lb/> and then alongside my head there burst out the most <lb/> inhuman explosion of
laughter that ever rent the <lb/> drum of a person's ear, and I looked, and it was La <lb/> Hire;
and he stood there with his gauntlets on his <lb/> hips and his head tilted back and his jaws spread
to <lb/> that degree to let out his hurricanes and his thunders <lb/> that it amounted to indecent
exposure, for you could <lb/> see everything that was in him. Only one thing <lb/> more and worse
could happen, and it happened: at <lb/> the other door I saw the flurry and bustle and bow- <lb/>
ings and scrapings of officials and flunkeys which <lb/> means that some great personage is
coming&#x2014;then <lb/>
<pb n="246"/> Joan of Arc stepped in, and the house rose! Yes, <lb/> and tried to shut its
indecorous mouth and make <lb/> itself grave and proper; but when it saw the Maid <lb/> herself go
to laughing, it thanked God for this mercy <lb/> and the earthquake followed.</p>
<p>Such things make life a bitterness, and I do not <lb/> wish to dwell upon them. The effect of the
poem <lb/> was spoiled.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XVI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>This</smcap> episode disagreed with me and I was not <lb/> able to leave my bed the next
day. The <lb/> others were in the same condition. But for this, <lb/> one or another of us might
have had the good luck <lb/> that fell to the Paladin's share that day; but it is <lb/> observable
that God in His compassion sends the <lb/> good luck to such as are ill equipped with gifts, as
<lb/> compensation for their defect, but requires such as <lb/> are more fortunately endowed to get
by labor and <lb/> talent what those others get by chance. It was <lb/> No&#x00EB;l who said this,
and it seemed to me to be well <lb/> and justly thought.</p>
<p>The Paladin, going about the town all the day in <lb/> order to be followed and admired and
overhear the <lb/> people say in an awed voice, "Ssh!&#x2014;look, it is <lb/> the Standard-Bearer
of Joan of Arc!" had speech <lb/> with all sorts and conditions of folk, and he learned <lb/> from
some boatmen that there was a stir of some <lb/> kind going on in the bastilles on the other side of
<lb/> the river; and in the evening, seeking further, he <lb/> found a deserter from the fortress
called the <lb/> "Augustins," who said that the English were going <lb/>
<pb n="248"/> to send men over to strengthen the garrisons on our <lb/> side during the darkness of
the night, and were <lb/> exulting greatly, for they meant to spring upon <lb/> Dunois and the army
when it was passing the bas- <lb/> tilles and destroy it; a thing quite easy to do, since <lb/> the
"Witch" would not be there, and without her <lb/> presence the army would do like the French armies
<lb/> of these many years past&#x2014;drop their weapons and <lb/> run when they saw an English
face.</p>
<p>It was ten at night when the Paladin brought this <lb/> news and asked leave to speak to Joan,
and I was <lb/> up and on duty then. It was a bitter stroke to me <lb/> to see what a chance I had
lost. Joan made search- <lb/> ing inquiries, and satisfied herself that the word was <lb/> true,
then she made this annoying remark:</p>
<p>"You have done well, and you have my thanks. <lb/> It may be that you have prevented a disaster.
Your <lb/> name and service shall receive official mention."</p>
<p>Then he bowed low, and when he rose he was <lb/> eleven feet high. As he swelled out past me he
<lb/> covertly pulled down the corner of his eye with his <lb/> finger and muttered part of that
defiled refrain, "Oh, <lb/> tears, ah, tears, oh, sad sweet tears!&#x2014;name in Gen- <lb/> eral
Orders&#x2014;personal mention to the King, you <lb/> see!"</p>
<p>I wished Joan could have seen his conduct, but she <lb/> was busy thinking what she would do.
Then she <lb/> had me fetch the knight Jean de Metz, and in a <lb/> minute he was off for La Hire's
quarters with orders <lb/> for him and the Lord de Villars and Florent d'Iliers <lb/>
<pb n="249"/> to report to her at five o'clock next morning with <lb/> five hundred picked men well
mounted. The his- <lb/> tories say half-past four, but it is not true, I heard <lb/> the order
given.</p>
<p>We were on our way at five to the minute, and <lb/> encountered the head of the arriving column
between <lb/> six and seven, a couple of leagues from the city. <lb/> Dunois was pleased, for the
army had begun to get <lb/> restive and show uneasiness now that it was getting <lb/> so near to the
dreaded bastilles. But that all disap- <lb/> peared now, as the word ran down the line, with a <lb/>
huzza that swept along the length of it like a wave, <lb/> that the Maid was come. Dunois asked her
to halt <lb/> and let the column pass in review, so that the men <lb/> could be sure that the report
of her presence was <lb/> not a ruse to revive their courage. So she took <lb/> position at the side
of the road with her staff, and <lb/> the battalions swung by with a martial stride, huz- <lb/>
zaing. Joan was armed, except her head. She <lb/> was wearing the cunning little velvet cap with the
<lb/> mass of curved white ostrich plumes tumbling over <lb/> its edges which the city of Orleans
had given her the <lb/> night she arrived&#x2014;the one that is in the picture <lb/> that hangs in
the H&#x00F4;tel de Ville at Rouen. She <lb/> was looking about fifteen. The sight of soldiers <lb/>
always set her blood to leaping, and lit the fires in <lb/> her eyes and brought the warm rich color
to her <lb/> cheeks; it was then that you saw that she was too <lb/> beautiful to be of the earth,
or at any rate that <lb/> there was a subtle something somewhere about her <lb/>
<pb n="250"/> beauty that differed it from the human types of your <lb/> experience and exalted it
above them.</p>
<p>In the train of wains laden with supplies a man <lb/> lay on top of the goods. He was stretched
out on <lb/> his back, and his hands were tied together with <lb/> ropes, and also his ankles. Joan
signed to the <lb/> officer in charge of that division of the train to come <lb/> to her, and he
rode up and saluted.</p>
<p>"What is he that is bound there?" she asked.</p>
<p>"A prisoner, General."</p>
<p>"What is his offense?"</p>
<p>"He is a deserter."</p>
<p>"What is to be done with him?"</p>
<p>"He will be hanged, but it was not convenient on <lb/> the march, and there was no hurry."</p>
<p>"Tell me about him."</p>
<p>"He is a good soldier, but he asked leave to go <lb/> and see his wife who was dying, he said,
but it could <lb/> not be granted; so he went without leave. Mean- <lb/> while the march began, and
he only overtook us <lb/> yesterday evening."</p>
<p>"Overtook you? Did he come of his own will?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it was of his own will."</p>
<p>"<i>He</i> a deserter! Name of God! Bring him to <lb/> me."</p>
<p>The officer rode forward and loosed the man's <lb/> feet and brought him back with his hands
still tied. <lb/> What a figure he was&#x2014;a good seven feet high, and <lb/> built for business!
He had a strong face; he had <lb/> an unkempt shock of black hair which showed up in <lb/>
<pb n="251"/> a striking way when the officer removed his morion <lb/> for him; for weapon he had a
big axe in his broad <lb/> leathern belt. Standing by Joan's horse, he made <lb/> Joan look littler
than ever, for his head was about <lb/> on a level with her own. His face was profoundly <lb/>
melancholy; all interest in life seemed to be dead in <lb/> the man. Joan said:</p>
<p>"Hold up your hands."</p>
<p>The man's head was down. He lifted it when he <lb/> heard that soft friendly voice, and there was
a wistful <lb/> something in his face which made one think that <lb/> there had been music in it for
him and that he would <lb/> like to hear it again. When he raised his hands <lb/> Joan laid her
sword to his bonds, but the officer <lb/> said with apprehension:</p>
<p>"Ah, madam&#x2014;my General!"</p>
<p>"What is it?" she said.</p>
<p>"He is under sentence!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know. I am responsible for him;" and <lb/> she cut the bonds. They had lacerated his
wrists, <lb/> and they were bleeding. "Ah, pitiful!" she said; <lb/> "blood&#x2014;I do not like
it;" and she shrank from <lb/> the sight. But only for a moment. "Give me <lb/> something, somebody,
to bandage his wrists with."</p>
<p>The officer said:</p>
<p>"Ah, my General! it is not fitting. Let me bring <lb/> another to do it."</p>
<p>"Another? De par le Dieu! You would seek far <lb/> to find one that can do it better than I, for
I learned <lb/> it long ago among both men and beasts. And I <lb/>
<pb n="252"/> can tie better than those that did this; if I had tied <lb/> him the ropes had not cut
his flesh."</p>
<p>The man looked on silent, while he was being <lb/> bandaged, stealing a furtive glance at Joan's
face <lb/> occasionally, such as an animal might that is receiv- <lb/> ing a kindness from an
unexpected quarter and is <lb/> gropingly trying to reconcile the act with its source. <lb/> All the
staff had forgotten the huzzaing army drift- <lb/> ing by in its rolling clouds of dust, to crane
their <lb/> necks and watch the bandaging as if it was the most <lb/> interesting and absorbing
novelty that ever was. I <lb/> have often seen people do like that&#x2014;get entirely <lb/> lost in
the simplest trifle, when it is something that <lb/> is out of their line. Now there in Poitiers,
once, I <lb/> saw two bishops and a dozen of those grave and <lb/> famous scholars grouped together
watching a man <lb/> paint a sign on a shop; they didn't breathe, they <lb/> were as good as dead;
and when it began to sprinkle <lb/> they didn't know it at first; then they noticed it, <lb/> and
each man hove a deep sigh, and glanced up <lb/> with a surprised look as wondering to see the others
<lb/> there, and how he came to be there himself&#x2014;but <lb/> that is the way with people, as I
have said. There <lb/> is no way of accounting for people. You have to <lb/> take them as they
are.</p>
<p>"There," said Joan at last, pleased with her suc- <lb/> cess; "another could have done it no
better&#x2014;not <lb/> as well, I think. Tell me&#x2014;what is it you did? <lb/> Tell me all."</p>
<p>The giant said:</p>
<pb/>
<figure>
<head>JOAN AND THE "DWARF"</head>
</figure>
<pb/>
<pb n="253"/>
<p>"It was this way, my angel. My mother died, <lb/> then my three little children, one after the
other, all <lb/> in two years. It was the famine; others fared so&#x2014; <lb/> it was God's will. I
saw them die; I had that grace; <lb/> and I buried them. Then when my poor wife's <lb/> fate was
come, I begged for leave to go to her&#x2014; <lb/> she who was so dear to me&#x2014;she who was all
I had; <lb/> I begged on my knees. But they would not let me. <lb/> Could I let her die, friendless
and alone? Could I <lb/> let her die believing I would not come? Would <lb/> she let <i>me</i> die
and <i>she</i> not come&#x2014;with her feet free <lb/> to do it if she would, and no cost upon it
but only <lb/> her life? Ah, she would come&#x2014;she would come <lb/> through the fire! So I went.
I saw her. She <lb/> died in my arms. I buried her. Then the army <lb/> was gone. I had trouble to
overtake it, but my <lb/> legs are long and there are many hours in a day; I <lb/> overtook it last
night."</p>
<p>Joan said, musingly, and as if she were thinking <lb/> aloud:</p>
<p>"It sounds true. If true, it were no great harm <lb/> to suspend the law this one time&#x2014;any
would say <lb/> that. It may not be true, but if it <i>is</i> true&#x2014;" She <lb/> turned
suddenly to the man and said, "I would see <lb/> your eyes&#x2014;look up!" The eyes of the two met,
<lb/> and Joan said to the officer, "The man is pardoned. <lb/> Give you good-day; you may go." Then
she said <lb/> to the man, "Did you know it was death to come <lb/> back to the army?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, "I knew it."</p>
<pb n="254"/>
<p>"Then why did you do it?"</p>
<p>The man said, quite simply:</p>
<p>"<i>Because</i> it was death. She was all I had. <lb/> There was nothing left to love."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, there was&#x2014;France! The children of <lb/> France have always their
mother&#x2014;<i>they</i> cannot be <lb/> left with nothing to love. You shall live&#x2014;and you
<lb/> shall serve France&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I will serve <i>you!</i>"</p>
<p>"&#x2014;you shall fight for France&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I will fight for <i>you!</i>"</p>
<p>"You shall be France's soldier&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I will be <i>your</i> soldier!"</p>
<p>"&#x2014;you shall give all your heart to France&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I will give all my heart to <i>you</i>&#x2014;and all my <lb/> soul, if I have one&#x2014;and
all my strength, which is <lb/> great&#x2014;for I was dead and am alive again; I had <lb/> nothing
to live for, but now I have! You are <lb/> France for me. You are my France, and I will <lb/> have
no other."</p>
<p>Joan smiled, and was touched and pleased at the <lb/> man's grave enthusiasm&#x2014;solemn
enthusiasm, one <lb/> may call it, for the manner of it was deeper than <lb/> mere
gravity&#x2014;and she said:</p>
<p>"Well, it shall be as you will. What are you <lb/> called?"</p>
<p>The man answered with unsmiling simplicity:</p>
<p>"They call me the Dwarf, but I think it is more <lb/> in jest than otherwise."</p>
<p>It made Joan laugh, and she said:</p>
<pb n="255"/>
<p>"It has something of that look truly! What is <lb/> the office of that vast axe?"</p>
<p>The soldier replied with the same gravity&#x2014;which <lb/> must have been born to him, it sat
upon him so <lb/> naturally:</p>
<p>"It is to persuade persons to respect France."</p>
<p>Joan laughed again, and said:</p>
<p>"Have you given many lessons?"</p>
<p>"Ah, indeed yes&#x2014;many."</p>
<p>"The pupils behaved to suit you afterward?"</p>
<p>"Yes; it made them quiet&#x2014;quite pleasant and <lb/> quiet."</p>
<p>"I should think it would happen so. Would you <lb/> like to be my man-at-arms?&#x2014;orderly,
sentinel, or <lb/> something like that?"</p>
<p>"If I may!"</p>
<p>"Then you shall. You shall have proper armor, <lb/> and shall go on teaching your art. Take one
of <lb/> those led horses there, and follow the staff when we <lb/> move."</p>
<p>That is how we came by the Dwarf; and a good <lb/> fellow he was. Joan picked him out on sight,
but it <lb/> wasn't a mistake; no one could be faithfuller than <lb/> he was, and he was a devil and
the son of a devil <lb/> when he turned himself loose with his axe. He was <lb/> so big that he made
the Paladin look like an ordinary <lb/> man. He liked to like people, therefore people <lb/> liked
him. He liked us boys from the start; and <lb/> he liked the knights, and liked pretty much every-
<lb/> body he came across; but he thought more of a <lb/>
<pb n="256"/> paring of Joan's finger-nail than he did of all the <lb/> rest of the world put
together.</p>
<p>Yes, that is where we got him&#x2014;stretched on the <lb/> wain, going to his death, poor chap,
and nobody to <lb/> say a good word for him. He was a good find. <lb/> Why, the knights treated him
almost like an equal&#x2014; <lb/> it is the honest truth; that is the sort of a man he <lb/> was.
They called him the Bastille sometimes, and <lb/> sometimes they called him Hellfire, which was on
<lb/> account of his warm and sumptuous style in battle, <lb/> and you know they wouldn't have given
him pet <lb/> names if they hadn't had a good deal of affection <lb/> for him.</p>
<p>To the Dwarf, Joan was France, the spirit of <lb/> France made flesh&#x2014;he never got away
from that <lb/> idea that he had started with; and God knows it was <lb/> the true one. That was a
humble eye to see so great <lb/> a truth where some others failed. To me that seems <lb/> quite
remarkable. And yet, after all, it was, in a <lb/> way, just what nations do. When they love a great
<lb/> and noble thing, they embody it&#x2014;they want it so <lb/> that they can see it with their
eyes; like Liberty, for <lb/> instance. They are not content with the cloudy <lb/> abstract idea,
they make a beautiful statue of it, and <lb/> then their beloved idea is substantial and they can
<lb/> look at it and worship it. And so it is as I say; to <lb/> the Dwarf, Joan was our country
embodied, our <lb/> country made visible flesh cast in a gracious form. <lb/> When she stood before
others, they saw Joan of <lb/> Arc, but he saw France.</p>
<pb n="257"/>
<p>Sometimes he would speak of her by that name. <lb/> It shows you how the idea was imbedded in his
<lb/> mind, and how real it was to him. The world has <lb/> called our kings by it, but I know of
none of them <lb/> who has had so good a right as she to that sublime <lb/> title.</p>
<p>When the march past was finished, Joan returned <lb/> to the front and rode at the head of the
column. <lb/> When we began to file past those grim bastilles and <lb/> could glimpse the men
within, standing to their guns <lb/> and ready to empty death into our ranks, such a <lb/> faintness
came over me and such a sickness that all <lb/> things seemed to turn dim and swim before my eyes;
<lb/> and the other boys looked droopy, too, I thought&#x2014; <lb/> including the Paladin, although
I do not know this <lb/> for certain, because he was ahead of me and I had to <lb/> keep my eyes out
toward the bastille side, because I <lb/> could wince better when I saw what to wince at.</p>
<p>But Joan was at home&#x2014;in Paradise, I might say. <lb/> She sat up straight, and I could see
that she was <lb/> feeling different from me. The awfulest thing was <lb/> the silence; there wasn't
a sound but the screaking <lb/> of the saddles, the measured tramplings, and the <lb/> sneezing of
the horses, afflicted by the smothering <lb/> dust-clouds which they kicked up. I wanted to <lb/>
sneeze myself, but it seemed to me that I would <lb/> rather go unsneezed, or suffer even a bitterer
<lb/> torture, if there is one, than attract attention to <lb/> myself.</p>
<p>I was not of a rank to make suggestions, or I <lb/>
<pb n="258"/> would have suggested that if we went faster we <lb/> should get by sooner. It seemed
to me that it was <lb/> an ill-judged time to be taking a walk. Just as we <lb/> were drifting in
that suffocating stillness past a great <lb/> cannon that stood just within a raised portcullis,
<lb/> with nothing between me and it but the moat, a <lb/> most uncommon jackass in there split the
world with <lb/> his bray, and I fell out of the saddle. Sir Bertrand <lb/> grabbed me as I went,
which was well, for if I had <lb/> gone to the ground in my armor I could not have <lb/> gotten up
again by myself. The English warders <lb/> on the battlements laughed a coarse laugh, forget- <lb/>
ting that every one must begin, and that there had <lb/> been a time when they themselves would have
fared <lb/> no better when shot by a jackass.</p>
<p>The English never uttered a challenge nor fired a <lb/> shot. It was said afterward that when
their men <lb/> saw the Maid riding at the front and saw how lovely <lb/> she was, their eager
courage cooled down in many <lb/> cases and vanished in the rest, they feeling certain <lb/> that
that creature was not mortal, but the very child <lb/> of Satan, and so the officers were prudent
and did <lb/> not try to make them fight. It was said also that <lb/> some of the officers were
affected by the same super- <lb/> stitious fears. Well, in any case, they never offered <lb/> to
molest us, and we poked by all the grisly fort- <lb/> resses in peace. During the march I caught up
on <lb/> my devotions, which were in arrears; so it was not <lb/> all loss and no profit for me
after all.</p>
<p>It was on this march that the histories say Dunois <lb/>
<pb n="259"/> told Joan that the English were expecting reinforce- <lb/> ments under the command of
Sir John Fastolfe, and <lb/> that she turned upon him and said:</p>
<p>"Bastard, Bastard, in God's name I warn you to <lb/> let me know of his coming as soon as you
hear of <lb/> it; for if he passes without my knowledge you shall <lb/> lose your head!"</p>
<p>It may be so; I don't deny it; but I didn't hear <lb/> it. If she really said it I think she only
meant she <lb/> would take off his official head&#x2014;degrade him from <lb/> his command. It was
not like her to threaten a <lb/> comrade's life. She did have her doubts of her <lb/> generals, and
was entitled to them, for she was all <lb/> for storm and assault, and they were for holding <lb/>
still and tiring the English out. Since they did not <lb/> believe in her way and were experienced
old soldiers, <lb/> it would be natural for them to prefer their own and <lb/> try to get around
carrying hers out.</p>
<p>But I did hear something that the histories didn't <lb/> mention and don't know about. I heard
Joan say <lb/> that now that the garrisons on the other side had <lb/> been weakened to strengthen
those on our side, the <lb/> most effective point of operations had shifted to the <lb/> south
shore; so she meant to go over there and <lb/> storm the forts which held the bridge end, and that
<lb/> would open up communication with our own domin- <lb/> ions and raise the siege. The generals
began to balk, <lb/> privately, right away, but they only baffled and de- <lb/> layed her, and that
for only four days.</p>
<p>All Orleans met the army at the gate and huz- <lb/>
<pb n="260"/> zaed it through the bannered streets to its various <lb/> quarters, but nobody had to
rock it to sleep; it <lb/> slumped down dog-tired, for Dunois had rushed it <lb/> without mercy, and
for the next twenty-four hours <lb/> it would be quiet, all but the snoring.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XVII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>When</smcap> we got home, breakfast for us minor fry <lb/> was waiting in our mess-room
and the family <lb/> honored us by coming in to eat it with us. The <lb/> nice old treasurer, and in
fact all three were flatter- <lb/> ingly eager to hear about our adventures. Nobody <lb/> asked the
Paladin to begin, but he did begin, be- <lb/> cause now that his specially ordained and peculiar
<lb/> military rank set him above everybody on the per- <lb/> sonal staff but old D'Aulon, who
didn't eat with us, <lb/> he didn't care a farthing for the knights' nobility <lb/> nor mine, but
took precedence in the talk whenever <lb/> it suited him, which was all the time, because he was
<lb/> born that way. He said:</p>
<p>"God be thanked, we found the army in admi- <lb/> rable condition. I think I have never seen a
finer <lb/> body of animals."</p>
<p>"Animals!" said Miss Catherine.</p>
<p>"I will explain to you what he means," said <lb/> No&#x00EB;l. "He&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I will trouble you not to trouble yourself to ex- <lb/> plain anything for me," said the
Paladin, loftily. <lb/> "I have reason to think&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"That is his way," said No&#x00EB;l; "always when he <lb/>
<pb n="262"/> thinks he has reason to think, he thinks he does <lb/> think, but this is an error. He
didn't see the army. <lb/> I noticed him, and he didn't see it. He was <lb/> troubled by his old
complaint."</p>
<p>"What is his old complaint?" Catherine asked.</p>
<p>"Prudence," I said, seeing my chance to help.</p>
<p>But it was not a fortunate remark, for the Paladin <lb/> said:</p>
<p>"It probably isn't your turn to criticise people's <lb/> prudence&#x2014;you who fall out of the
saddle when a <lb/> donkey brays."</p>
<p>They all laughed, and I was ashamed of myself <lb/> for my hasty smartness. I said:</p>
<p>"It isn't quite fair for you to say I fell out on <lb/> account of the donkey's braying. It was
emotion, <lb/> just ordinary emotion."</p>
<p>"Very well, if you want to call it that, I am not <lb/> objecting. What would you call it, Sir
Bertrand?"</p>
<p>"Well, it&#x2014;well, whatever it was, it was excusa- <lb/> ble, I think. All of you have
learned how to be- <lb/> have in hot hand-to-hand engagements, and you <lb/> don't need to be
ashamed of your record in that <lb/> matter; but to walk along in front of death, with <lb/> one's
hands idle, and no noise, no music, and noth- <lb/> ing going on, is a very trying situation. If I
were <lb/> you, De Conte, I would name the emotion; it's <lb/> nothing to be ashamed of."</p>
<p>It was as straight and sensible a speech as ever I <lb/> heard, and I was grateful for the
opening it gave <lb/> me; so I came out and said:</p>
<pb n="263"/>
<p>"It was fear&#x2014;and thank you for the honest <lb/> idea, too."</p>
<p>"It was the cleanest and best way out," said the <lb/> old treasurer; "you've done well, my
lad."</p>
<p>That made me comfortable, and when Miss Cath- <lb/> erine said, "It's what I think, too," I was
grateful <lb/> to myself for getting into that scrape.</p>
<p>Sir Jean de Metz said:</p>
<p>"We were all in a body together when the <lb/> donkey brayed, and it was dismally still at the
time. <lb/> I don't see how any young campaigner could escape <lb/> some little touch of that
emotion."</p>
<p>He looked about him with a pleasant expression <lb/> of inquiry on his good face, and as each
pair of <lb/> eyes in turn met his the head they were in nodded a <lb/> confession. Even the Paladin
delivered his nod. <lb/> That surprised everybody, and saved the Standard- <lb/> Bearer's credit. It
was clever of him; nobody be- <lb/> lieved he could tell the truth that way without <lb/> practice,
or would tell that particular sort of a truth <lb/> either with or without practice. I suppose he
<lb/> judged it would favorably impress the family. <lb/> Then the old treasurer said:</p>
<p>"Passing the forts in that trying way required <lb/> the same sort of nerve that a person must
have when <lb/> ghosts are about him in the dark, I should think. <lb/> What does the
Standard-Bearer think?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't quite know about that, sir. I've <lb/> often thought I would like to see a ghost
if I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Would you?" exclaimed the young lady. <pb n="264"/> "We've got one! Would you try that one? Will
<lb/> you?"</p>
<p>She was so eager and pretty that the Paladin said <lb/> straight out that he would; and then as
none of the <lb/> rest had bravery enough to expose the fear that was <lb/> in him, one volunteered
after the other with a <lb/> prompt mouth and a sick heart till all were shipped <lb/> for the
voyage; then the girl clapped her hands in <lb/> glee, and the parents were gratified, too, saying
that <lb/> the ghosts of their house had been a dread and a <lb/> misery to them and their forebears
for generations, <lb/> and nobody had ever been found yet who was will- <lb/> ing to confront them
and find out what their trouble <lb/> was, so that the family could heal it and content the <lb/>
poor specters and beguile them to tranquillity and <lb/> peace.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XVIII">
<pb n="265"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XVIII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>>About</smcap> noon I was chatting with Madame Boucher; <lb/> nothing was going on, all
was quiet, when Cathe- <lb/> rine Boucher suddenly entered in great excitement, <lb/> and said:</p>
<p>"Fly, sir, fly! The Maid was dozing in her chair <lb/> in my room, when she sprang up and cried
out, <lb/> 'French blood is flowing!&#x2014;my arms, give me my <lb/> arms!' Her giant was on guard
at the door, and he <lb/> brought D'Aulon, who began to arm her, and I and <lb/> the giant have been
warning the staff. Fly!&#x2014;and <lb/> stay by her; and if there really is a battle, keep her
<lb/> out of it&#x2014;don't let her risk herself&#x2014;there is no <lb/> need&#x2014;if the men
know she is near and looking on, <lb/> it is all that is necessary. Keep her out of the fight <lb/>
&#x2014;don't fail of this!"</p>
<p>I started on a run, saying, sarcastically&#x2014;for I <lb/> was always fond of sarcasm, and it
was said that I <lb/> had a most neat gift that way:</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, nothing easier than that&#x2014;I'll attend <lb/> to it!"</p>
<p>At the furthest end of the house I met Joan, <lb/> fully armed, hurrying toward the door, and she
said:</p>
<pb n="266"/>
<p>"Ah, French blood is being spilt, and you did not <lb/> tell me."</p>
<p>"Indeed I did not know it," I said; "there are <lb/> no sounds of war; everything is quiet, your
<lb/> Excellency."</p>
<p>"You will hear war-sounds enough in a moment," <lb/> she said, and was gone.</p>
<p>It was true. Before one could count five there <lb/> broke upon the stillness the swelling rush
and tramp <lb/> of an approaching multitude of men and horses, with <lb/> hoarse cries of command;
and then out of the <lb/> distance came the muffled deep <i>boom!&#x2014;boom-boom! <lb/>
&#x2014;boom!</i> of cannon, and straightway that rushing <lb/> multitude was roaring by the house
like a hurricane.</p>
<p>Our knights and all our staff came flying, armed, <lb/> but with no horses ready, and we burst
out after <lb/> Joan in a body, the Paladin in the lead with the <lb/> banner. The surging crowd was
made up half of <lb/> citizens and half of soldiers, and had no recognized <lb/> leader. When Joan
was seen a huzza went up, and <lb/> she shouted:</p>
<p>"A horse&#x2014;a horse!"</p>
<p>A dozen saddles were at her disposal in a moment. <lb/> She mounted, a hundred people
shouting:</p>
<p>"Way, there&#x2014;way for the <smcap>Maid of Orleans</smcap>!" <lb/> The first time that that
immortal name was ever <lb/> uttered&#x2014;and I, praise God, was there to hear it! <lb/> The mass
divided itself like the waters of the Red <lb/> Sea, and down this lane Joan went skimming like a
<lb/> bird, crying, "Forward, French hearts&#x2014;follow <lb/>
<pb n="267"/> me!" and we came winging in her wake on the rest <lb/> of the borrowed horses, the
holy standard streaming <lb/> above us, and the lane closing together in our rear.</p>
<p>This was a different thing from the ghastly march <lb/> past the dismal bastilles. No, we felt
fine, now, and <lb/> all awhirl with enthusiasm. The explanation of this <lb/> sudden uprising was
this. The city and the little <lb/> garrison, so long hopeless and afraid, had gone wild <lb/> over
Joan's coming, and could no longer restrain <lb/> their desire to get at the enemy; so, without
orders <lb/> from anybody, a few hundred soldiers and citizens <lb/> had plunged out at the Burgundy
gate on a sudden <lb/> impulse and made a charge on one of Lord Talbot's <lb/> most formidable
fortresses&#x2014;St. Loup&#x2014;and were <lb/> getting the worst of it. The news of this had swept
<lb/> through the city and started this new crowd that we <lb/> were with.</p>
<p>As we poured out at the gate we met a force bring- <lb/> ing in the wounded from the front. The
sight <lb/> moved Joan, and she said:</p>
<p>"Ah, French blood; it makes my hair rise to see <lb/> it!"</p>
<p>We were soon on the field, soon in the midst of <lb/> the turmoil. Joan was seeing her first real
battle, <lb/> and so were we.</p>
<p>It was a battle in the open field; for the garrison <lb/> of St. Loup had sallied confidently out
to meet the <lb/> attack, being used to victories when "witches" were <lb/> not around. The sally
had been re-enforced by <lb/> troops from the "Paris" bastille, and when we ap- <lb/>
<pb n="268"/> proached the French were getting whipped and were <lb/> falling back. But when Joan
came charging through <lb/> the disorder with her banner displayed, crying "For- <lb/> ward,
men&#x2014;follow me!" there was a change; the <lb/> French turned about and surged forward like a
solid <lb/> wave of the sea, and swept the English before them, <lb/> hacking and slashing, and
being hacked and slashed, <lb/> in a way that was terrible to see.</p>
<p>In the field the Dwarf had no assignment; that is <lb/> to say, he was not under orders to occupy
any par- <lb/> ticular place, therefore he chose his place for him- <lb/> self, and went ahead of
Joan and made a road for <lb/> her. It was horrible to see the iron helmets fly into <lb/> fragments
under his dreadful axe. He called it <lb/> cracking nuts, and it looked like that. He made a <lb/>
good road, and paved it well with flesh and iron. <lb/> Joan and the rest of us followed it so
briskly that we <lb/> outspeeded our forces and had the English behind <lb/> us as well as before.
The knights commanded us to <lb/> face outwards around Joan, which we did, and then <lb/> there was
work done that was fine to see. One was <lb/> obliged to respect the Paladin, now. Being right <lb/>
under Joan's exalting and transforming eye, he for- <lb/> got his native prudence, he forgot his
diffidence in <lb/> the presence of danger, he forgot what fear was, and <lb/> he never laid about
him in his imaginary battles in a <lb/> more tremendous way than he did in this real one; <lb/> and
wherever he struck there was an enemy the <lb/> less.</p>
<p>We were in that close place only a few minutes; <lb/>
<pb n="269"/> then our forces to the rear broke through with a <lb/> great shout and joined us, and
then the English <lb/> fought a retreating fight, but in a fine and gallant <lb/> way, and we drove
them to their fortress foot by <lb/> foot, they facing us all the time, and their reserves <lb/> on
the walls raining showers of arrows, cross-bow <lb/> bolts, and stone cannon-balls upon us.</p>
<p>The bulk of the enemy got safely within the works <lb/> and left us outside with piles of French
and English <lb/> dead and wounded for company&#x2014;a sickening sight, <lb/> an awful sight to us
youngsters, for our little ambush <lb/> fights in February had been in the night, and the <lb/>
blood and the mutilations and the dead faces were <lb/> mercifully dim, whereas we saw these things
now for <lb/> the first time in all their naked ghastliness.</p>
<p>Now arrived Dunois from the city, and plunged <lb/> through the battle on his foam-flecked horse
and gal- <lb/> loped up to Joan, saluting, and uttering handsome <lb/> compliments as he came. He
waved his hand <lb/> toward the distant walls of the city, where a multi- <lb/> tude of flags were
flaunting gayly in the wind, and <lb/> said the populace were up there observing her for- <lb/>
tunate performance and rejoicing over it, and added <lb/> that she and the forces would have a great
reception <lb/> now.</p>
<p>"<i>Now?</i> Hardly now, Bastard. Not yet!"</p>
<p>"Why not yet? Is there more to be done?"</p>
<p>"More, Bastard? We have but begun! We will <lb/> take this fortress."</p>
<p>"Ah, you can't be serious! We can't take this <lb/>
<pb n="270"/> place; let me urge you not to make the attempt; it <lb/> is too desperate. Let me
order the forces back."</p>
<p>Joan's heart was overflowing with the joys and en- <lb/> thusiasms of war, and it made her
impatient to hear <lb/> such talk. She cried out:</p>
<p>"Bastard, Bastard, will ye play <i>always</i> with these <lb/> English? Now verily I tell you we
will not budge <lb/> until this place is ours. We will carry it by storm. <lb/> Sound the
charge!"</p>
<p>"Ah, my General&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Waste no more time, man&#x2014;let the bugles <lb/> sound the assault!" and we saw that strange
deep <lb/> light in her eye which we named the battle-light, and <lb/> learned to know so well in
later fields.</p>
<p>The martial notes pealed out, the troops answered <lb/> with a yell, and down they came against
that formid- <lb/> able work, whose outlines were lost in its own can- <lb/> non smoke, and whose
sides were spouting flame and <lb/> thunder.</p>
<p>We suffered repulse after repulse, but Joan was <lb/> here and there and everywhere encouraging
the men, <lb/> and she kept them to their work. During three <lb/> hours the tide ebbed and flowed,
flowed and ebbed; <lb/> but at last La Hire, who was now come, made a final <lb/> and resistless
charge, and the bastille St. Loup was <lb/> ours. We gutted it, taking all its stores and artil-
<lb/> lery, and then destroyed it.</p>
<p>When all our host was shouting itself hoarse with <lb/> rejoicings, and there went up a cry for
the General, <lb/> for they wanted to praise her and glorify her and do <lb/>
<pb n="271"/> her homage for her victory, we had trouble to find <lb/> her; and when we did find
her, she was off by her- <lb/> self, sitting among a ruck of corpses, with her face <lb/> in her
hands, crying&#x2014;for she was a young girl, you <lb/> know, and her hero-heart was a young girl's
heart <lb/> too, with the pity and the tenderness that are natural <lb/> to it. She was thinking of
the mothers of those <lb/> dead friends and enemies.</p>
<p>Among the prisoners were a number of priests, <lb/> and Joan took these under her protection and
saved <lb/> their lives. It was urged that they were most prob- <lb/> ably combatants in disguise,
but she said:</p>
<p>"As to that, how can any tell? They wear the <lb/> livery of God, and if even one of these wears
it <lb/> rightfully, surely it were better that all the guilty <lb/> should escape than that we have
upon our hands the <lb/> blood of that innocent man. I will lodge them <lb/> where I lodge, and feed
them, and send them away <lb/> in safety."</p>
<p>We marched back to the city with our crop of <lb/> cannon and prisoners on view and our banners
dis- <lb/> played. Here was the first substantial bit of war- <lb/> work the imprisoned people had
seen in the seven <lb/> months that the siege had endured, the first chance <lb/> they had had to
rejoice over a French exploit. You <lb/> may guess that they made good use of it. They <lb/> and the
bells went mad. Joan was their darling <lb/> now, and the press of people struggling and shoul-
<lb/> dering each other to get a glimpse of her was so <lb/> great that we could hardly push our way
through the <lb/>
<pb n="272"/> streets at all. Her new name had gone all about, <lb/> and was on everybody's lips.
The Holy Maid of <lb/> Vaucouleurs was a forgotten title; the city had <lb/> claimed her for its
own, and she was the <smcap>Maid of <lb/> Orleans</smcap> now. It is a happiness to me to remem-
<lb/> ber that I heard that name the first time it was ever <lb/> uttered. Between that first
utterance and the last <lb/> time it will be uttered on this earth&#x2014;ah, think how <lb/> many
mouldering ages will lie in that gap!</p>
<p>The Boucher family welcomed her back as if she <lb/> had been a child of the house, and saved
from death <lb/> against all hope or probability. They chided her <lb/> for going into the battle
and exposing herself to <lb/> danger during all those hours. They could not <lb/> realize that she
had meant to carry her warriorship <lb/> so far, and asked her if it had really been her pur- <lb/>
pose to go right into the turmoil of the fight, or <lb/> hadn't she got swept into it by accident
and the rush <lb/> of the troops? They begged her to be more careful <lb/> another time. It was good
advice, maybe, but it fell <lb/> upon pretty unfruitful soil.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XIX.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Being</smcap> worn out with the long fight, we all slept <lb/> the rest of the afternoon
away and two or three <lb/> hours into the night. Then we got up refreshed, <lb/> and had supper. As
for me, I could have been <lb/> willing to let the matter of the ghost drop; and the <lb/> others
were of a like mind, no doubt, for they talked <lb/> diligently of the battle and said nothing of
that other <lb/> thing. And indeed it was fine and stirring to hear <lb/> the Paladin rehearse his
deeds and see him pile his <lb/> dead, fifteen here, eighteen there, and thirty-five <lb/> yonder;
but this only postponed the trouble; it <lb/> could not do more. He could not go on forever; <lb/>
when he had carried the bastille by assault and eaten <lb/> up the garrison there was nothing for it
but to stop, <lb/> unless Catherine Boucher would give him a new start <lb/> and have it all done
over again&#x2014;as we hoped she <lb/> would, this time&#x2014;but she was otherwise minded. <lb/>
As soon as there was a good opening and a fair <lb/> chance, she brought up her unwelcome subject,
and <lb/> we faced it the best we could.</p>
<p>We followed her and her parents to the haunted <lb/> room at eleven o'clock, with candles, and
also with <lb/>
<pb n="274"/> torches to place in the sockets on the walls. It was <lb/> a big house, with very
thick walls, and this room <lb/> was in a remote part of it which had been left unoc- <lb/> cupied
for nobody knew how many years, because <lb/> of its evil repute.</p>
<p>This was a large room, like a salon, and had a big <lb/> table in it of enduring oak and well
preserved; but <lb/> the chairs were worm-eaten and the tapestry on the <lb/> walls was rotten and
discolored by age. The dusty <lb/> cobwebs under the ceiling had the look of not having <lb/> had
any business for a century.</p>
<p>Catherine said:</p>
<p>"Tradition says that these ghosts have never been <lb/> seen&#x2014;they have merely been heard.
It is plain <lb/> that this room was once larger than it is now, and <lb/> that the wall at this end
was built in some bygone <lb/> time to make and fence off a narrow room there. <lb/> There is no
communication anywhere with that nar- <lb/> row room, and if it exists&#x2014;and of that there is
no <lb/> reasonable doubt&#x2014;it has no light and no air, but is <lb/> an absolute dungeon. Wait
where you are, and take <lb/> note of what happens."</p>
<p>That was all. Then she and her parents left us. <lb/> When their footfalls had died out in the
distance <lb/> down the empty stone corridors an uncanny silence <lb/> and solemnity ensued which
was dismaler to me <lb/> than the mute march past the bastilles. We sat <lb/> looking vacantly at
each other, and it was easy to <lb/> see that no one there was comfortable. The longer <lb/> we sat
so, the more deadly still that stillness got to <lb/>
<pb n="275"/> be; and when the wind began to moan around the <lb/> house presently, it made me sick
and miserable, and <lb/> I wished I had been brave enough to be a coward this <lb/> time, for indeed
it is no proper shame to be afraid <lb/> of ghosts, seeing how helpless the living are in their
<lb/> hands. And then these ghosts were invisible, which <lb/> made the matter the worse, as it
seemed to me. <lb/> They might be in the room with us at that moment <lb/> &#x2014;we could not
know. I felt airy touches on my <lb/> shoulders and my hair, and I shrank from them and <lb/>
cringed, and was not ashamed to show this fear, for <lb/> I saw the others doing the like, and knew
that they <lb/> were feeling those faint contacts too. As this went <lb/> on&#x2014;oh, eternities
it seemed, the time dragged so <lb/> drearily&#x2014;all those faces became as wax, and I <lb/>
seemed sitting with a congress of the dead.</p>
<p>At last, faint and far and weird and slow, came a <lb/>
"boom!&#x2014;boom!&#x2014;boom!"&#x2014;a distant bell tolling <lb/> midnight. When the last stroke
died, that depress- <lb/> ing stillness followed again, and as before I was <lb/> staring at those
waxen faces and feeling those airy <lb/> touches on my hair and my shoulders once more.</p>
<p>One minute&#x2014;two minutes&#x2014;three minutes of <lb/> this, then we heard a long deep
groan, and everybody <lb/> sprang up and stood, with his legs quaking. It <lb/> came from that
little dungeon. There was a pause, <lb/> then we heard muffled sobbings, mixed with pitiful <lb/>
ejaculations. Then there was a second voice, low <lb/> and not distinct, and the one seemed trying
to com- <lb/> fort the other; and so the two voices went on, with <lb/>
<pb n="276"/> moanings, and soft sobbings, and, ah, the tones were <lb/> so full of compassion and
sorrow and despair! In- <lb/> deed, it made one's heart sore to hear it.</p>
<p>But those sounds were so real and so human and <lb/> so moving that the idea of ghosts passed
straight out <lb/> of our minds, and Sir Jean de Metz spoke out and <lb/> said:</p>
<p>"Come! we will smash that wall and set those <lb/> poor captives free. Here, with your axe!"</p>
<p>The Dwarf jumped forward, swinging his great <lb/> axe with both hands, and others sprang for the
<lb/> torches and brought them. Bang!&#x2014;whang!&#x2014; <lb/> slam!&#x2014;smash went the
ancient bricks, and there <lb/> was a hole an ox could pass through. We plunged <lb/> within and
held up the torches.</p>
<p>Nothing there but vacancy! On the floor lay a <lb/> rusty sword and a rotten fan.</p>
<p>Now you know all that I know. Take the pathetic <lb/> relics, and weave about them the romance of
the <lb/> dungeon's long-vanished inmates as best you can.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XX.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> next day Joan wanted to go against the <lb/> enemy again, but it was the feast
of the <lb/> Ascension, and the holy council of bandit generals <lb/> were too pious to be willing
to profane it with blood- <lb/> shed. But privately they profaned it with plottings, <lb/> a sort of
industry just in their line. They decided <lb/> to do the only thing proper to do now in the new
cir- <lb/> cumstances of the case&#x2014;feign an attack on the most <lb/> important bastille on the
Orleans side, and then, if <lb/> the English weakened the far more important fort- <lb/> resses on
the other side of the river to come to its <lb/> help, cross in force and capture those works. This
<lb/> would give them the bridge and free communication <lb/> with the Sologne, which was French
territory. They <lb/> decided to keep this latter part of the programme <lb/> secret from Joan.</p>
<p>Joan intruded and took them by surprise. She <lb/> asked them what they were about and what they
had <lb/> resolved upon. They said they had resolved to <lb/> attack the most important of the
English bastilles on <lb/> the Orleans side next morning&#x2014;and there the <lb/> spokesman
stopped. Joan said:</p>
<pb n="278"/>
<p>"Well, go on."</p>
<p>"There is nothing more. That is all."</p>
<p>"Am I to believe this? That is to say, am I to <lb/> believe that you have lost your wits?" She
turned <lb/> to Dunois, and said, "Bastard, you have sense, <lb/> answer me this: if this attack is
made and the bas- <lb/> tille taken, how much better off would we be than <lb/> we are now?"</p>
<p>The Bastard hesitated, and then began some <lb/> rambling talk not quite germane to the question.
<lb/> Joan interrupted him and said:</p>
<p>"That will do, good Bastard, you have answered. <lb/> Since the Bastard is not able to mention
any advan- <lb/> tage to be gained by taking that bastille and stop- <lb/> ping there, it is not
likely that any of you could <lb/> better the matter. You waste much time here in <lb/> inventing
plans that lead to nothing, and making de- <lb/> lays that are a damage. Are you concealing some-
<lb/> thing from me? Bastard, this council has a general <lb/> plan, I take it; without going into
details, what is <lb/> it?"</p>
<p>"It is the same it was in the beginning, seven <lb/> months ago&#x2014;to get provisions in for a
long siege, <lb/> and then sit down and tire the English out."</p>
<p>"In the name of God! As if seven months was <lb/> not enough, you want to provide for a year of
it. <lb/> Now ye shall drop these pusillanimous dreams&#x2014; <lb/> the English shall go in three
days!"</p>
<p>Several exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Ah, General, General, be prudent!"</p>
<pb n="279"/>
<p>"Be prudent and starve? Do ye call that war? <lb/> I tell you this, if you do not already know
it: The <lb/> new circumstances have changed the face of matters. <lb/> The true point of attack has
shifted; it is on the <lb/> other side of the river now. One must take the <lb/> fortifications that
command the bridge. The Eng- <lb/> lish know that if we are not fools and cowards we <lb/> will try
to do that. They are grateful for your <lb/> piety in wasting this day. They will re-enforce the
<lb/> bridge forts from this side to-night, knowing what <lb/> ought to happen to-morrow. You have
but lost a <lb/> day and made our task harder, for we <i>will</i> cross <lb/> and take the bridge
forts. Bastard, tell me the <lb/> truth&#x2014;does not this council know that there is no <lb/>
other course for us than the one I am speaking of?"</p>
<p>Dunois conceded that the council did know it <lb/> to be the most desirable, but considered it
imprac- <lb/> ticable; and he excused the council as well as he <lb/> could by saying that inasmuch
as nothing was really <lb/> and rationally to be hoped for but a long continu- <lb/> ance of the
siege and wearying out of the English, <lb/> they were naturally a little afraid of Joan's impetu-
<lb/> ous notions. He said:</p>
<p>"You see, we are sure that the waiting game is <lb/> the best, whereas you would carry everything
by <lb/> storm."</p>
<p>"That I would!&#x2014;and moreover that I will! <lb/> You have my orders&#x2014;here and now. We
will <lb/> move upon the forts of the south bank to-morrow <lb/> at dawn."</p>
<pb n="280"/>
<p>"And carry them by storm?"</p>
<p>"Yes, carry them by storm!"</p>
<p>La Hire came clanking in, and heard the last <lb/> remark. He cried out:</p>
<p>"By <i>my baton</i>, that is the music I love to hear! <lb/> Yes, that is the right tune and the
beautiful words, <lb/> my General&#x2014;we will carry them by storm!"</p>
<p>He saluted in his large way and came up and <lb/> shook Joan by the hand.</p>
<p>Some member of the council was heard to say:</p>
<p>"It follows, then, that we must begin with the <lb/> bastille St. John, and that will give the
English time <lb/> to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Joan turned and said:</p>
<p>"Give yourselves no uneasiness about the bastille <lb/> St. John. The English will know enough to
retire <lb/> from it and fall back on the bridge bastilles when <lb/> they see us coming." She
added, with a touch of <lb/> sarcasm, "Even a war-council would know enough <lb/> to do that
itself."</p>
<p>Then she took her leave. La Hire made this <lb/> general remark to the council:</p>
<p>"She is a child, and that is all ye seem to see. <lb/> Keep to that superstition if you must, but
you per- <lb/> ceive that this child understands this complex game <lb/> of war as well as any of
you; and if you want my <lb/> opinion without the trouble of asking for it, here <lb/> you have it
without ruffles or embroidery&#x2014;by <lb/> God, I think she can teach the best of you how to <lb/>
<i>play</i> it!"</p>
<pb n="281"/>
<p>Joan had spoken truly; the sagacious English <lb/> saw that the policy of the French had
undergone a <lb/> revolution; that the policy of paltering and dawd- <lb/> ling was ended; that in
place of taking blows, blows <lb/> were to be struck now; therefore they made ready <lb/> for the
new state of things by transferring heavy re- <lb/> enforcements to the bastilles of the south bank
from <lb/> those of the north.</p>
<p>The city learned the great news that once more in <lb/> French history, after all these
humiliating years, <lb/> France was going to take the offensive; that France, <lb/> so used to
retreating, was going to advance; that <lb/> France, so long accustomed to skulking, was going <lb/>
to face about and strike. The joy of the people <lb/> passed all bounds. The city walls were black
with <lb/> them to see the army march out in the morning in <lb/> that strange new
position&#x2014;its front, not its tail, <lb/> toward an English camp. You shall imagine for <lb/>
yourselves what the excitement was like and how it <lb/> expressed itself, when Joan rode out at the
head of <lb/> the host with her banner floating above her.</p>
<p>We crossed the river in strong force, and a tedi- <lb/> ous long job it was, for the boats were
small and <lb/> not numerous. Our landing on the island of St. <lb/> Aignan was not disputed. We
threw a bridge of a <lb/> few boats across the narrow channel thence to the <lb/> south shore and
took up our march in good order <lb/> and unmolested; for although there was a fortress <lb/>
there&#x2014;St. John&#x2014;the English vacated and de- <lb/> stroyed it and fell back on the
bridge forts below <lb/>
<pb n="282"/> as soon as our first boats were seen to leave the <lb/> Orleans shore; which was what
Joan had said would <lb/> happen, when she was disputing with the council.</p>
<p>We moved down the shore and Joan planted her <lb/> standard before the bastille of the Augustins,
the <lb/> first of the formidable works that protected the end <lb/> of the bridge. The trumpets
sounded the assault, <lb/> and two charges followed in handsome style; but <lb/> we were too weak,
as yet, for our main body was <lb/> still lagging behind. Before we could gather for <lb/> a third
assault the garrison of St. Priv&#x00E9; were seen <lb/> coming up to re-enforce the big bastille.
They came <lb/> on a run, and the Augustins sallied out, and both <lb/> forces came against us with
a rush, and sent our <lb/> small army flying in a panic, and followed us, slash- <lb/> ing and
slaying, and shouting jeers and insults at us.</p>
<p>Joan was doing her best to rally the men, but <lb/> their wits were gone, their hearts were
dominated for <lb/> the moment by the old-time dread of the English. <lb/> Joan's temper flamed up,
and she halted and com- <lb/> manded the trumpets to sound the advance. Then <lb/> she wheeled about
and cried out:</p>
<p>"If there is but a dozen of you that are not <lb/> cowards, it is enough&#x2014;follow me!"</p>
<p>Away she went, and after her a few dozen who <lb/> had heard her words and been inspired by them.
<lb/> The pursuing force was astonished to see her sweep- <lb/> ing down upon them with this handful
of men, and <lb/> it was their turn now to experience a grisly fright&#x2014; <lb/> surely this
<i>is</i> a witch, this is a child of Satan! <pb n="283"/> That was their thought&#x2014;and without
stopping to <lb/> analyze the matter they turned and fled in a <lb/> panic.</p>
<p>Our flying squadrons heard the bugle and turned <lb/> to look; and when they saw the Maid's
banner <lb/> speeding in the other direction and the enemy <lb/> scrambling ahead of it in disorder,
their courage <lb/> returned and they came scouring after us.</p>
<p>La Hire heard it and hurried his force forward <lb/> and caught up with us just as we were
planting our <lb/> banner again before the ramparts of the Augustins. <lb/> We were strong enough
now. We had a long and <lb/> tough piece of work before us, but we carried it <lb/> through before
night, Joan keeping us hard at it, <lb/> and she and La Hire saying we were able to take <lb/> that
big bastille, and <i>must</i>. The English fought <lb/> like&#x2014;well, they fought like the
English; when that <lb/> is said, there is no more to say. We made assault <lb/> after assault,
through the smoke and flame and the <lb/> deafening cannon-blasts, and at last as the sun was <lb/>
sinking we carried the place with a rush, and planted <lb/> our standard on its walls.</p>
<p>The Augustins was ours. The Tourelles must be <lb/> ours, too, if we would free the bridge and
raise the <lb/> siege. We had achieved one great undertaking, <lb/> Joan was determined to
accomplish the other. We <lb/> must lie on our arms where we were, hold fast to <lb/> what we had
got, and be ready for business in the <lb/> morning. So Joan was not minded to let the men <lb/> be
demoralized by pillage and riot and carousings; <lb/>
<pb n="284"/> she had the Augustins burned, with all its stores in <lb/> it, excepting the artillery
and ammunition.</p>
<p>Everybody was tired out with this long day's hard <lb/> work, and of course this was the case
with Joan; <lb/> still, she wanted to stay with the army before the <lb/> Tourelles, to be ready for
the assault in the morn- <lb/> ing. The chiefs argued with her, and at last per- <lb/> suaded her to
go home and prepare for the great <lb/> work by taking proper rest, and also by having a <lb/> leech
look to a wound which she had received in <lb/> her foot. So we crossed with them and went home.</p>
<p>Just as usual, we found the town in a fury of joy, <lb/> all the bells clanging, everybody
shouting, and <lb/> several people drunk. We never went out or came <lb/> in without furnishing good
and sufficient reasons for <lb/> one of these pleasant tempests, and so the tempest <lb/> was always
on hand. There had been a blank ab- <lb/> sence of reasons for this sort of upheavals for the <lb/>
past seven months, therefore the people took to the <lb/> upheavals with all the more relish on that
account.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XXI">
<pb n="285"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XXI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>To</smcap> get away from the usual crowd of visitors and <lb/> have a rest, Joan went with
Catherine straight <lb/> to the apartment which the two occupied together, <lb/> and there they took
their supper and there the <lb/> wound was dressed. But then, instead of going to <lb/> bed, Joan,
weary as she was, sent the Dwarf for me, <lb/> in spite of Catherine's protests and persuasions.
<lb/> She said she had something on her mind, and must <lb/> send a courier to Domremy with a letter
for our old <lb/> P&#x00E8;re Fronte to read to her mother. I came, and <lb/> she began to dictate.
After some loving words and <lb/> greetings to her mother and the family, came this:</p>
<p>"But the thing which moves me to write now, is <lb/> to say that when you presently hear that I
am <lb/> wounded, you shall give yourself no concern about <lb/> it, and refuse faith to any that
shall try to make you <lb/> believe it is serious."</p>
<p>She was going on, when Catherine spoke up and <lb/> said:</p>
<p>"Ah, but it will fright her so to read these words. <lb/> Strike them out, Joan, strike them out,
and wait <lb/> only one day&#x2014;two days at most&#x2014;then write and <lb/>
<pb n="286"/> say your foot <i>was</i> wounded but is well again&#x2014;for <lb/> it will surely be
well then, or very near it. Don't <lb/> distress her, Joan; do as I say."</p>
<p>A laugh like the laugh of the old days, the im- <lb/> pulsive free laugh of an untroubled spirit,
a laugh <lb/> like a chime of bells, was Joan's answer; then she <lb/> said:</p>
<p>"My foot? Why should I write about such a <lb/> scratch as that? I was not thinking of it, dear
<lb/> heart."</p>
<p>"Child, have you another wound and a worse, <lb/> and have not spoken of it? What have you been
<lb/> dreaming about, that you&#x2014;"</p>
<p>She had jumped up, full of vague fears, to have <lb/> the leech called back at once, but Joan
laid her hand <lb/> upon her arm and made her sit down again, saying:</p>
<p>"There, now, be tranquil, there is no other <lb/> wound, as yet; I am writing about one which I
<lb/> shall get when we storm that bastille to-morrow."</p>
<p>Catherine had the look of one who is trying to <lb/> understand a puzzling proposition but cannot
quite <lb/> do it. She said, in a distraught fashion:</p>
<p>"A wound which you are <i>going</i> to get? But&#x2014; <lb/> but why grieve your mother when
it&#x2014;when it may <lb/> not happen?"</p>
<p>"<i>May</i> not? Why, it <i>will</i>."</p>
<p>The puzzle was a puzzle still. Catherine said in <lb/> that same abstracted way as before:</p>
<p>"<i>Will</i>. It is a strong word. I cannot seem to <lb/> &#x2014;my mind is not able to take
hold of this. Oh, <lb/>
<pb n="287"/> Joan, such a presentiment is a dreadful thing&#x2014;it <lb/> takes one's peace and
courage all away. Cast it <lb/> from you!&#x2014;drive it out! It will make your whole <lb/> night
miserable, and to no good; for we will <lb/> hope&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"But it isn't a presentiment&#x2014;it is a fact. And <lb/> it will not make me miserable. It is
uncertainties <lb/> that do that, but this is not an uncertainty."</p>
<p>"Joan, do you <i>know</i> it is going to happen?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know it. My Voices told me."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Catherine, resignedly, "if <i>they</i> told <lb/> you&#x2014; But are you sure it was
they?&#x2014;quite <lb/> sure?"</p>
<p>"Yes, quite. It will happen&#x2014;there is no <lb/> doubt."</p>
<p>"It is dreadful! Since when have you known <lb/> it?"</p>
<p>"Since&#x2014;I think it is several weeks." Joan <lb/> turned to me. "Louis, you will remember.
How <lb/> long is it?"</p>
<p>"Your Excellency spoke of it first to the King, <lb/> in Chinon," I answered; "that was as much
as <lb/> seven weeks ago. You spoke of it again the 20th <lb/> of April, and also the 22d, two weeks
ago, as I see <lb/> by my record here."</p>
<p>These marvels disturbed Catherine profoundly, <lb/> but I had long ceased to be surprised at
them. One <lb/> can get used to anything in this world. Catherine <lb/> said:</p>
<p>"And it is to happen to-morrow?&#x2014;always to- <lb/>
<pb n="288"/> morrow? Is it the same date always? There has <lb/> been no mistake, and no
confusion?"</p>
<p>"No," Joan said, "the 7th of May is the date&#x2014; <lb/> there is no other."</p>
<p>"Then you shall not go a step out of this house <lb/> till that awful day is gone by! You will
not dream <lb/> of it, Joan, <i>will</i> you?&#x2014;promise that you will stay <lb/> with us."</p>
<p>But Joan was not persuaded. She said:</p>
<p>"It would not help the matter, dear good friend. <lb/> The wound is to come, and come to-morrow.
If <lb/> I do not seek it, it will seek me. My duty calls me <lb/> to that place to-morrow; I should
have to go if my <lb/> death were waiting for me there; shall I stay away <lb/> for only a wound?
Oh, no, we must try to do <lb/> better than that."</p>
<p>"Then you are determined to go?"</p>
<p>"Of a certainty, yes. There is only one thing <lb/> that I can do for France&#x2014;hearten her
soldiers for <lb/> battle and victory." She thought a moment, then <lb/> added, "However, one should
not be unreasonable, <lb/> and I would do much to please you, who are so <lb/> good to me. Do you
love France?"</p>
<p>I wondered what she might be contriving now, <lb/> but I saw no clew. Catherine said,
reproachfully:</p>
<p>"Ah, what have I done to deserve this ques- <lb/> tion?"</p>
<p>"Then you do love France. I had not doubted <lb/> it, dear. Do not be hurt, but answer
me&#x2014;have <lb/> you ever told a lie?"</p>
<pb n="289"/>
<p>"In my life I have not willfully told a lie&#x2014;fibs, <lb/> but no lies."</p>
<p>"That is sufficient. You love France and do not <lb/> tell lies; therefore I will trust you. I
will go or I <lb/> will stay, as you shall decide."</p>
<p>"Oh, I thank you from my heart, Joan! How <lb/> good and dear it is of you to do this for me! Oh,
<lb/> you shall stay, and not go!"</p>
<p>In her delight she flung her arms about Joan's <lb/> neck and squandered endearments upon her the
least <lb/> of which would have made me rich, but, as it was, <lb/> they only made me realize how
poor I was&#x2014;how <lb/> miserably poor in what I would most have prized in <lb/> this world.
Joan said:</p>
<p>"Then you will send word to my headquarters <lb/> that I am not going?"</p>
<p>"Oh, gladly. Leave that to me."</p>
<p>"It is good of you. And how will you word it? <lb/> &#x2014;for it must have proper official
form. Shall I <lb/> word it for you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, do&#x2014;for you know about these solemn <lb/> procedures and stately proprieties, and I
have had <lb/> no experience."</p>
<p>"Then word it like this: 'The chief of staff is <lb/> commanded to make known to the King's
forces in <lb/> garrison and in the field, that the General-in-Chief <lb/> of the Armies of France
will not face the English <lb/> on the morrow, she being afraid she may get hurt. <lb/> Signed,
<smcap>Joan of Arc</smcap>, by the hand of <smcap>Catherine <lb/> Boucher</smcap>, who loves
France.'"</p>
<pb n="290"/>
<p>There was a pause&#x2014;a silence of the sort that <lb/> tortures one into stealing a glance to
see how the <lb/> situation looks, and I did that. There was a loving <lb/> smile on Joan's face,
but the color was mounting in <lb/> crimson waves into Catherine's, and her lips were <lb/>
quivering and the tears gathering; then she said:</p>
<p>"Oh, I am so ashamed of myself!&#x2014;and you are <lb/> so noble and brave and wise, and I am so
paltry&#x2014; <lb/> so paltry and such a fool!" and she broke down <lb/> and began to cry, and I
did so want to take her in <lb/> my arms and comfort her, but Joan did it, and of <lb/> course I
said nothing. Joan did it well, and most <lb/> sweetly and tenderly, but I could have done it as
<lb/> well, though I knew it would be foolish and out of <lb/> place to suggest such a thing, and
might make an <lb/> awkwardness, too, and be embarrassing to us all, so <lb/> I did not offer, and I
hope I did right and for the <lb/> best, though I could not know, and was many times <lb/> tortured
with doubts afterward as having perhaps let <lb/> a chance pass which might have changed all my life
<lb/> and made it happier and more beautiful than, alas, <lb/> it turned out to be. For this reason
I grieve yet, <lb/> when I think of that scene, and do not like to call it <lb/> up out of the deeps
of my memory because of the <lb/> pangs it brings.</p>
<p>Well, well, a good and wholesome thing is a little <lb/> harmless fun in this world; it tones a
body up and <lb/> keeps him human and prevents him from souring. <lb/> To set that little trap for
Catherine was as good and <lb/> effective a way as any to show her what a grotesque <lb/>
<pb n="291"/> thing she was asking of Joan. It <i>was</i> a funny idea <lb/> now, wasn't it, when
you look at it all around? <lb/> Even Catherine dried up her tears and laughed when <lb/> she
thought of the English getting hold of the <lb/> French Commander-in-Chief's reason for staying
<lb/> out of a battle. She granted that they could have <lb/> a good time over a thing like
that.</p>
<p>We got to work on the letter again, and of course <lb/> did not have to strike out the passage
about the <lb/> wound. Joan was in fine spirits; but when she got <lb/> to sending messages to this,
that, and the other <lb/> playmate and friend, it brought our village and the <lb/> Fairy Tree and
the flowery plain and the browsing <lb/> sheep and all the peaceful beauty of our old humble <lb/>
home-place back, and the familiar names began to <lb/> tremble on her lips; and when she got to
Haumette <lb/> and Little Mengette it was no use, her voice broke <lb/> and she couldn't go on. She
waited a moment, <lb/> then said:</p>
<p>"Give them my love&#x2014;my warm love&#x2014;my deep <lb/> love&#x2014;oh, out of my heart of
hearts! I shall never <lb/> see our home any more."</p>
<p>Now came Pasquerel, Joan's confessor, and intro- <lb/> duced a gallant knight, the Sire de Rais,
who had <lb/> been sent with a message. He said he was in- <lb/> structed to say that the council
had decided that <lb/> enough had been done for the present; that it <lb/> would be safest and best
to be content with what <lb/> God had already done; that the city was now well <lb/> victualed and
able to stand a long siege; that the <pb n="292"/> wise course must necessarily be to withdraw the
<lb/> troops from the other side of the river and resume <lb/> the defensive&#x2014;therefore they
had decided accord- <lb/> ingly.</p>
<p>"The incurable cowards!" exclaimed Joan. "So <lb/> it was to get me away from my men that they
pre- <lb/> tended so much solicitude about my fatigue. Take <lb/> this message back, not to the
council&#x2014;I have no <lb/> speeches for those disguised ladies'maids&#x2014;but to <lb/> the
Bastard and La Hire, who are men. Tell them <lb/> the army is to remain where it is, and I hold them
<lb/> responsible if this command miscarries. And say <lb/> the offensive will be resumed in the
morning. You <lb/> may go, good sir."</p>
<p>Then she said to her priest:</p>
<p>"Rise early, and be by me all the day. There <lb/> will be much work on my hands, and I shall be
hurt <lb/> between my neck and my shoulder."</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>We</smcap> were up at dawn, and after mass we started. <lb/> In the hall we met the master
of the house, <lb/> who was grieved, good man, to see Joan going <lb/> breakfastless to such a day's
work, and begged her <lb/> to wait and eat, but she couldn't afford the time&#x2014; <lb/> that is
to say, she couldn't afford the patience, she <lb/> being in such a blaze of anxiety to get at that
last <lb/> remaining bastille which stood between her and the <lb/> completion of the first great
step in the rescue and <lb/> redemption of France. Boucher put in another plea:</p>
<p>"But think&#x2014;we poor beleaguered citizens who <lb/> have hardly known the flavor of fish for
these many <lb/> months, have spoil of that sort again, and we owe it <lb/> to you. There's a noble
shad for breakfast; wait&#x2014; <lb/> be persuaded."</p>
<p>Joan said:</p>
<p>"Oh, there's going to be fish in plenty; when <lb/> this day's work is done the whole river-front
will be <lb/> yours to do as you please with."</p>
<p>"Ah, your Excellency will do well, <i>that</i> I know; <lb/> but we don't require quite that
much, even of you; <lb/> you shall have a month for it in place of a day. <lb/> Now be
beguiled&#x2014;wait and eat. There's a saying <lb/>
<pb n="294"/> that he that would cross a river twice in the same <lb/> day in a boat, will do well
to eat fish for luck, lest <lb/> he have an accident."</p>
<p>"That doesn't fit my case, for to-day I cross but <lb/> once in a boat."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't say that. Aren't you coming back <lb/> to us?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but not in a boat."</p>
<p>"How, then?"</p>
<p>"By the bridge."</p>
<p>"Listen to that&#x2014;by the bridge! Now stop this <lb/> jesting, dear General, and do as I
would have you. <lb/> It's a noble fish."</p>
<p>"Be good, then, and save me some for supper; <lb/> and I will bring one of those Englishmen with
me <lb/> and he shall have his share."</p>
<p>"Ah, well, have your way if you must. But he <lb/> that fasts must attempt but little and stop
early. <lb/> When shall you be back?"</p>
<p>"When I've raised the siege of Orleans. <smcap>For- <lb/> ward</smcap>!"</p>
<p>We were off. The streets were full of citizens <lb/> and of groups and squads of soldiers, but
the spec- <lb/> tacle was melancholy. There was not a smile any- <lb/> where, but only universal
gloom. It was as if some <lb/> vast calamity had smitten all hope and cheer dead. <lb/> We were not
used to this, and were astonished. <lb/> But when they saw the Maid, there was an imme- <lb/> diate
stir, and the eager question flew from mouth <lb/> to mouth:</p>
<pb n="295"/>
<p>"Where is she going? Whither is she bound?"</p>
<p>Joan heard it, and called out:</p>
<p>"Whither would ye suppose? I am going to take <lb/> the Tourelles."</p>
<p>It would not be possible for any to describe how <lb/> those few words turned that mourning into
joy&#x2014; <lb/> into exaltation&#x2014;into frenzy; and how a storm of <lb/> huzzas burst out and
swept down the streets in <lb/> every direction and woke those corpse-like multi- <lb/> tudes to
vivid life and action and turmoil in a mo- <lb/> ment. The soldiers broke from the crowd and came
<lb/> flocking to our standard, and many of the citizens <lb/> ran and got pikes and halberds and
joined us. As <lb/> we moved on, our numbers increased steadily, and <lb/> the hurrahing
continued&#x2014;yes, we moved through a <lb/> solid cloud of noise, as you may say, and all the
<lb/> windows on both sides contributed to it, for they <lb/> were filled with excited people.</p>
<p>You see, the council had closed the Burgundy <lb/> gate and placed a strong force there, under
that <lb/> stout soldier Raoul de Gaucourt, Bailly of Orleans, <lb/> with orders to prevent Joan
from getting out and <lb/> resuming the attack on the Tourelles, and this <lb/> shameful thing had
plunged the city into sorrow and <lb/> despair. But that feeling was gone now. They <lb/> believed
the Maid was a match for the council, and <lb/> they were right.</p>
<p>When we reached the gate, Joan told Gaucourt to <lb/> open it and let her pass.</p>
<p>He said it would be impossible to do this, for his <lb/>
<pb n="296"/> orders were from the council and were strict. Joan <lb/> said:</p>
<p>"There is no authority above mine but the <lb/> King's. If you have an order from the King, pro-
<lb/> duce it."</p>
<p>"I cannot claim to have an order from him, <lb/> General."</p>
<p>"Then make way, or take the consequences!"</p>
<p>He began to argue the case, for he was like the <lb/> rest of the tribe, always ready to fight
with words, <lb/> not acts; but in the midst of his gabble Joan inter- <lb/> rupted with the terse
order:</p>
<p>"Charge!"</p>
<p>We came with a rush, and brief work we made of <lb/> that small job. It was good to see the
Bailly's sur- <lb/> prise. He was not used to this unsentimental <lb/> promptness. He said afterward
that he was cut off <lb/> in the midst of what he was saying&#x2014;in the midst <lb/> of an
argument by which he could have proved that <lb/> he could not let Joan pass&#x2014;an argument
which <lb/> Joan could not have answered.</p>
<p>"Still, it appears she did answer it," said the <lb/> person he was talking to.</p>
<p>We swung through the gate in great style, with a <lb/> vast accession of noise, the most of which
was <lb/> laughter, and soon our van was over the river and <lb/> moving down against the
Tourelles.</p>
<p>First we must take a supporting work called a <lb/> boulevard, and which was otherwise nameless,
be- <lb/> fore we could assault the great bastille. Its rear <lb/>
<pb n="297"/> communicated with the bastille by a drawbridge, <lb/> under which ran a swift and deep
strip of the Loire. <lb/> The boulevard was strong, and Dunois doubted our <lb/> ability to take it,
but Joan had no such doubt. She <lb/> pounded it with artillery all the forenoon, then <lb/> about
noon she ordered an assault and led it her- <lb/> self. We poured into the fosse through the smoke
<lb/> and a tempest of missiles, and Joan, shouting en- <lb/> couragements to her men, started to
climb a scaling- <lb/> ladder, when that misfortune happened which we <lb/> knew was to
happen&#x2014;the iron bolt from an arbalest <lb/> struck between her neck and her shoulder, and
tore <lb/> its way down through her armor. When she felt <lb/> the sharp pain and saw her blood
gushing over her <lb/> breast, she was frightened, poor girl, and as she <lb/> sank to the ground
she began to cry bitterly.</p>
<p>The English sent up a glad shout and came surg- <lb/> ing down in strong force to take her, and
then for <lb/> a few minutes the might of both adversaries was <lb/> concentrated upon that spot.
Over her and about <lb/> her, English and French fought with desperation&#x2014; <lb/> for she stood
for France, indeed she <i>was</i> France to <lb/> both sides&#x2014;whichever won her won France,
<i>and <lb/> could keep it forever</i>. Right there in that small spot, <lb/> and in ten minutes by
the clock, the fate of France, <lb/> for all time, was to be decided, and <i>was</i> decided.</p>
<p>If the English had captured Joan then, Charles <lb/> VII. would have flown the country, the
Treaty of <lb/> Troyes would have held good, and France, already <lb/> English property, would have
become, without fur- <lb/>
<pb n="298"/> ther dispute, an English province, to so remain until <lb/> the Judgment Day. A
nationality and a kingdom <lb/> were at stake there, and no more time to decide it <lb/> in than it
takes to hard-boil an egg. It was the <lb/> most momentous ten minutes that the clock has <lb/> ever
ticked in France, or ever will. Whenever you <lb/> read in histories about hours or days or weeks in
<lb/> which the fate of one or another nation hung in the <lb/> balance, do not you fail to
remember, nor your <lb/> French hearts to beat the quicker for the remem- <lb/> brance, the ten
minutes that France, called other- <lb/> wise Joan of Arc, lay bleeding in the fosse that day, <lb/>
with two nations struggling over her for her pos- <lb/> session.</p>
<p>And you will not forget the Dwarf. For he stood <lb/> over her, and did the work of any six of
the others. <lb/> He swung his axe with both hands; whenever it <lb/> came down, he said those two
words, "For <lb/> France!" and a splintered helmet flew like egg- <lb/> shells, and the skull that
carried it had learned its <lb/> manners and would offend the French no more. He <lb/> piled a
bulwark of iron-clad dead in front of him <lb/> and fought from behind it; and at last when the
<lb/> victory was ours we closed about him, shielding <lb/> him, and he ran up a ladder with Joan as
easily as <lb/> another man would carry a child, and bore her out <lb/> of the battle, a great crowd
following and anxious, <lb/> for she was drenched with blood to her feet, half of <lb/> it her own
and the other half English, for bodies <lb/> had fallen across her as she lay and had poured their <lb/>
<pb n="299"/> red life-streams over her. One couldn't see the <lb/> white armor now, with that awful
dressing over it.</p>
<p>The iron bolt was still in the wound&#x2014;some say <lb/> it projected out behind the shoulder.
It may be&#x2014; <lb/> I did not wish to see, and did not try to. It was <lb/> pulled out, and the
pain made Joan cry again, poor <lb/> thing. Some say she pulled it out herself because <lb/> others
refused, saying they could not bear to hurt <lb/> her. As to this I do not know; I only know it was
<lb/> pulled out, and that the wound was treated with oil <lb/> and properly dressed.</p>
<p>Joan lay on the grass, weak and suffering, hour <lb/> after hour, but still insisting that the
fight go on. <lb/> Which it did, but not to much purpose, for it was <lb/> only under her eye that
men were heroes and not <lb/> afraid. They were like the Paladin; I think he was <lb/> afraid of his
shadow&#x2014;I mean in the afternoon, <lb/> when it was very big and long; but when he was <lb/>
under Joan's eye and the inspiration of her great <lb/> spirit, what was he afraid of? Nothing in
this <lb/> world&#x2014;and that is just the truth.</p>
<p>Toward night Dunois gave it up. Joan heard the <lb/> bugles.</p>
<p>"What!" she cried. "Sounding the retreat!"</p>
<p>Her wound was forgotten in a moment. She <lb/> countermanded the order, and sent another, to the
<lb/> officer in command of a battery, to stand ready to <lb/> fire five shots in quick succession.
This was a sig- <lb/> nal to a force on the Orleans side of the river under <lb/> La Hire, who was
not, as some of the histories say <lb/>
<pb n="300"/> with <i>us</i>. It was to be given whenever Joan should <lb/> feel sure the boulevard
was about to fall into her <lb/> hands&#x2014;then that force must make a counter-attack <lb/> on
the Tourelles by way of the bridge.</p>
<p>Joan mounted her horse now, with her staff about <lb/> her, and when our people saw us coming
they raised <lb/> a great shout, and were at once eager for another <lb/> assault on the boulevard.
Joan rode straight to the <lb/> fosse where she had received her wound, and stand- <lb/> ing there
in the rain of bolts and arrows, she ordered <lb/> the Paladin to let her long standard blow free,
and <lb/> to note when its fringes should touch the fortress. <lb/> Presently he said:</p>
<p>"It touches."</p>
<p>"Now, then," said Joan to the waiting battalions, <lb/> "the place is yours&#x2014;enter in!
Bugles, sound the <lb/> assault! Now, then&#x2014;all together&#x2014;<i>go!</i>"</p>
<p>And go it was. You never saw anything like it. <lb/> We swarmed up the ladders and over the
battle- <lb/> ments like a wave&#x2014;and the place was our prop- <lb/> erty. Why, one might live a
thousand years and <lb/> never see so gorgeous a thing as that again. There, <lb/> hand to hand, we
fought like wild beasts, for there <lb/> was no give-up to those English&#x2014;there was no way
<lb/> to convince one of those people but to kill him, and <lb/> even then he doubted. At least so
it was thought, <lb/> in those days, and maintained by many.</p>
<p>We were busy and never heard the five cannon- <lb/> shots fired, but they <i>were</i> fired a
moment after Joan <lb/> had ordered the assault; and so, while we were <lb/>
<pb n="301"/> hammering and being hammered in the smaller fort- <lb/> ress, the reserve on the
Orleans side poured across <lb/> the bridge and attacked the Tourelles from that side. <lb/> A
fire-boat was brought down and moored under <lb/> the drawbridge which connected the Tourelles with
<lb/> our boulevard; wherefore, when at last we drove <lb/> our English ahead of us and they tried
to cross that <lb/> drawbridge and join their friends in the Tourelles, <lb/> the burning timbers
gave way under them and <lb/> emptied them in a mass into the river in their heavy <lb/>
armor&#x2014;and a pitiful sight it was to see brave men <lb/> die such a death as that.</p>
<p>"Ah, God pity them!" said Joan, and wept to <lb/> see that sorrowful spectacle. She said those
gentle <lb/> words and wept those compassionate tears although <lb/> one of those perishing men had
grossly insulted her <lb/> with a coarse name three days before, when she had <lb/> sent him a
message asking him to surrender. That <lb/> was their leader, Sir William Glasdale, a most valor-
<lb/> ous knight. He was clothed all in steel; so he <lb/> plunged under the water like a lance, and
of course <lb/> came up no more.</p>
<p>We soon patched a sort of bridge together and <lb/> threw ourselves against the last stronghold
of the <lb/> English power that barred Orleans from friends and <lb/> supplies. Before the sun was
quite down, Joan's <lb/> forever memorable day's work was finished, her <lb/> banner floated from
the fortress of the Tourelles, <lb/> her promise was fulfilled, she had raised the siege of <lb/>
Orleans!</p>
<pb n="302"/>
<p>The seven months' beleaguerment was ended, the <lb/> thing which the first generals of France had
called <lb/> impossible was accomplished; in spite of all that <lb/> the King's ministers and
war-councils could do to <lb/> prevent it, this little country maid of seventeen had <lb/> carried
her immortal task through, and had done it <lb/> in four days!</p>
<p>Good news travels fast, sometimes, as well as bad. <lb/> By the time we were ready to start
homeward by <lb/> the bridge the whole city of Orleans was one red <lb/> flame of bonfires, and the
heavens blushed with <lb/> satisfaction to see it; and the booming and bellow- <lb/> ing of cannon
and the banging of bells surpassed by <lb/> great odds anything that even Orleans had attempted
<lb/> before in the way of noise.</p>
<p>When we arrived&#x2014;well, there is no describing <lb/> that. Why, those acres of people that
we plowed <lb/> through shed tears enough to raise the river; there <lb/> was not a face in the
glare of those fires that hadn't <lb/> tears streaming down it; and if Joan's feet had not <lb/>
been protected by iron they would have kissed them <lb/> off of her. "Welcome! welcome to the Maid
of <lb/> Orleans!" That was the cry; I heard it a hundred <lb/> thousand times. "Welcome to
<i>our</i> Maid!" some <lb/> of them worded it.</p>
<p>No other girl in all history has ever reached such <lb/> a summit of glory as Joan of Arc reached
that day. <lb/> And do you think it turned her head, and that she <lb/> sat up to enjoy that
delicious music of homage and <lb/> applause? No; another girl would have done that, <lb/>
<pb n="303"/> but not this one. That was the greatest heart and <lb/> the simplest that ever beat.
She went straight to <lb/> bed and to sleep, like any tired child; and when the <lb/> people found
she was wounded and would rest, they <lb/> shut off all passage and traffic in that region and <lb/>
stood guard themselves the whole night through, to <lb/> see that her slumbers were not disturbed.
They <lb/> said, "She has given us peace, she shall have peace <lb/> herself."</p>
<p>All knew that that region would be empty of <lb/> English next day, and all said that neither the
<lb/> present citizens nor their posterity would ever cease <lb/> to hold that day sacred to the
memory of Joan of <lb/> Arc. That word has been true for more than sixty <lb/> years; it will
continue so always. Orleans will <lb/> never forget the 8th of May, nor ever fail to cele- <lb/>
brate it. It is Joan of Arc's day&#x2014;and holy.<ref target="n2">*</ref><note id="n2" place="foot"

<div2 type="chapter" n="XXIII">
<pb n="304"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XXIII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>In</smcap> the earliest dawn of the morning, Talbot and <lb/> his English forces evacuated
their bastilles and <lb/> marched away, not stopping to burn, destroy, or <lb/> carry off anything,
but leaving their fortresses just <lb/> as they were, provisioned, armed, and equipped for <lb/> a
long siege. It was difficult for the people to be- <lb/> lieve that this great thing had really
happened; that <lb/> they were actually free once more, and might go <lb/> and come through any gate
they pleased, with none <lb/> to molest or forbid; that the terrible Talbot, that <lb/> scourge of
the French, that man whose mere name <lb/> had been able to annul the effectiveness of French <lb/>
armies, was gone, vanquished, retreating&#x2014;driven <lb/> away by a girl.</p>
<p>The city emptied itself. Out of every gate the <lb/> crowds poured. They swarmed about the
English <lb/> bastilles like an invasion of ants, but noisier than <lb/> those creatures, and
carried off the artillery and <lb/> stores, then turned all those dozen fortresses into <lb/>
monster bonfires, imitation volcanoes whose lofty <lb/> columns of thick smoke seemed supporting the
arch <lb/> of the sky.</p>
<pb n="305"/>
<p>The delight of the children took another form. <lb/> To some of the younger ones seven months was
a <lb/> sort of lifetime. They had forgotten what grass <lb/> was like, and the velvety green
meadows seemed <lb/> paradise to their surprised and happy eyes after the <lb/> long habit of seeing
nothing but dirty lanes and <lb/> streets. It was a wonder to them&#x2014;those spacious <lb/>
reaches of open country to run and dance and <lb/> tumble and frolic in, after their dull and
joyless <lb/> captivity; so they scampered far and wide over the <lb/> fair regions on both sides of
the river, and came <lb/> back at eventide weary, but laden with flowers and <lb/> flushed with new
health drawn from the fresh <lb/> country air and the vigorous exercise.</p>
<p>After the burnings, the grown folk followed Joan <lb/> from church to church and put in the day
in thanks- <lb/> givings for the city's deliverance, and at night they <lb/> f&#x00EA;ted her and
her generals and illuminated the town, <lb/> and high and low gave themselves up to festivities
<lb/> and rejoicings. By the time the populace were <lb/> fairly in bed, toward dawn, we were in the
saddle <lb/> and away toward Tours to report to the King.</p>
<p>That was a march which would have turned any <lb/> one's head but Joan's. We moved between emo-
<lb/> tional ranks of grateful country people all the way. <lb/> They crowded about Joan to touch
her feet, her <lb/> horse, her armor, and they even knelt in the road <lb/> and kissed her horse's
hoof-prints.</p>
<p>The land was full of her praises. The most illus- <lb/> trious chiefs of the church wrote to the
King ex- <lb/>
<pb n="306"/> tolling the Maid, comparing her to the saints and <lb/> heroes of the Bible, and
warning him not to let <lb/> "unbelief, ingratitude, or other injustice" hinder <lb/> or impair the
divine help sent through her. One <lb/> might think there was a touch of prophecy in that, <lb/> and
we will let it go at that; but to my mind it had <lb/> its inspiration in those great men's accurate
knowl- <lb/> edge of the King's trivial and treacherous character.</p>
<p>The King had come to Tours to meet Joan. At <lb/> the present day this poor thing is called
Charles the <lb/> Victorious, on account of victories which other peo- <lb/> ple won for him, but in
our time we had a private <lb/> name for him which described him better, and was <lb/> sanctified to
him by personal deserving&#x2014;Charles <lb/> the Base. When we entered the presence he sat <lb/>
throned, with his tinseled snobs and dandies around <lb/> him. He looked like a forked carrot, so
tightly did <lb/> his clothing fit him from his waist down; he wore <lb/> shoes with a rope-like
pliant toe a foot long that <lb/> had to be hitched up to the knee to keep it out of <lb/> the way;
he had on a crimson velvet cape that came <lb/> no lower than his elbows; on his head he had a tall
<lb/> felt thing like a thimble, with a feather in its jeweled <lb/> band that stuck up like a pen
from an inkhorn, and <lb/> from under that thimble his bush of stiff hair stuck <lb/> down to his
shoulders, curving outwards at the <lb/> bottom, so that the cap and the hair together made <lb/>
the head like a shuttlecock. All the materials of his <lb/> dress were rich, and all the colors
brilliant. In his <lb/> lap he cuddled a miniature greyhound that snarled, <lb/>
<pb n="307"/> lifting its lip and showing its white teeth whenever <lb/> any slight movement
disturbed it. The King's <lb/> dandies were dressed in about the same fashion as <lb/> himself, and
when I remembered that Joan had <lb/> called the war-council of Orleans "disguised ladies' <lb/>
maids," it reminded me of people who squander all <lb/> their money on a trifle and then haven't
anything to <lb/> invest when they come across a better chance; that <lb/> name ought to have been
saved for these creatures.</p>
<p>Joan fell on her knees before the majesty of <lb/> France, and the other frivolous animal in his
lap&#x2014; <lb/> a sight which it pained me to see. What had that <lb/> man done for his country or
for anybody in it, that <lb/> she or any other person should kneel to him? But <lb/> she&#x2014;she
had just done the only great deed that <lb/> had been done for France in fifty years, and had <lb/>
consecrated it with the libation of her blood. The <lb/> positions should have been reversed.</p>
<p>However, to be fair, one must grant that Charles <lb/> acquitted himself very well for the most
part, on <lb/> that occasion&#x2014;very much better than he was in the <lb/> habit of doing. He
passed his pup to a courtier, <lb/> and took off his cap to Joan as if she had been a <lb/> queen.
Then he stepped from his throne and raised <lb/> her, and showed quite a spirited and manly joy and
<lb/> gratitude in welcoming her and thanking her for <lb/> her extraordinary achievement in his
service. My <lb/> prejudices are of a later date than that. If he had <lb/> continued as he was at
that moment, I should not <lb/> have acquired them.</p>
<pb n="308"/>
<p>He acted handsomely. He said:</p>
<p>"You shall not kneel to me, my matchless Gen- <lb/> eral; you have wrought royally, and royal
courtesies <lb/> are your due." Noticing that she was pale, he said, <lb/> "But you must not stand;
you have lost blood for <lb/> France, and your wound is yet green&#x2014;come." He <lb/> led her to
a seat and sat down by her. "Now, then, <lb/> speak out frankly, as to one who owes you much <lb/>
and freely confesses it before all this courtly assem- <lb/> blage. What shall be your reward? Name
it."</p>
<p>I was ashamed of him. And yet that was not <lb/> fair, for how could he be expected to know this
<lb/> marvelous child in these few weeks, when we who <lb/> thought we had known her all her life
were daily <lb/> seeing the clouds uncover some new altitudes of her <lb/> character whose existence
was not suspected by us <lb/> before? But we are all that way: when <i>we</i> know a <lb/> thing we
have only scorn for other people who <lb/> don't happen to know it. And I was ashamed of <lb/> these
courtiers, too, for the way they licked their <lb/> chops, so to speak, as envying Joan her great
<lb/> chance, they not knowing her any better than the <lb/> King did. A blush began to rise in
Joan's cheeks <lb/> at the thought that she was working for her country <lb/> for pay, and she
dropped her head and tried to hide <lb/> her face, as girls always do when they find them- <lb/>
selves blushing; no one knows why they do, but <lb/> they do, and the more they blush the more they
fail <lb/> to get reconciled to it, and the more they can't bear <lb/> to have people look at them
when they are doing it. <lb/>
<pb n="309"/> The King made it a great deal worse by calling <lb/> attention to it, which is the
unkindest thing a person <lb/> can do when a girl is blushing; sometimes, when <lb/> there is a big
crowd of strangers, it is even likely to <lb/> make her cry if she is as young as Joan was. God
<lb/> knows the reason for this, it is hidden from men. <lb/> As for me, I would as soon blush as
sneeze; in <lb/> fact, I would rather. However, these meditations <lb/> are not of consequence: I
will go on with what I <lb/> was saying. The King rallied her for blushing, and <lb/> this brought
up the rest of the blood and turned her <lb/> face to fire. Then he was sorry, seeing what he <lb/>
had done, and tried to make her comfortable by <lb/> saying the blush was exceedingly becoming to
her <lb/> and not to mind it&#x2014;which caused even the dog to <lb/> notice it now, so of course
the red in Joan's face <lb/> turned to purple, and the tears overflowed and ran <lb/> down&#x2014;I
could have told anybody that that would <lb/> happen. The King was distressed, and saw that the
<lb/> best thing to do would be to get away from this <lb/> subject, so he began to say the finest
kind of things <lb/> about Joan's capture of the Tourelles, and presently <lb/> when she was more
composed he mentioned the re- <lb/> ward again and pressed her to name it. Everybody <lb/> listened
with anxious interest to hear what her claim <lb/> was going to be, but when her answer came their
<lb/> faces showed that the thing she asked for was not <lb/> what they had been expecting.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear and gracious Dauphin, I have but one <lb/> desire&#x2014;only one. If&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="310"/>
<p>"Do not be afraid, my child&#x2014;name it."</p>
<p>"That you will not delay a day. My army is <lb/> strong and valiant, and eager to finish its
work&#x2014; <lb/> march with me to Rheims and receive your crown."</p>
<p>You could see the indolent King shrink, in his <lb/> butterfly clothes.</p>
<p>"To Rheims&#x2014;oh, impossible, my General! <i>We</i>
<lb/> march through the heart of England's power?"</p>
<p>Could those be French faces there? Not one of <lb/> them lighted in response to the girl's brave
propo- <lb/> sition, but all promptly showed satisfaction in the <lb/> King's objection. Leave this
silken idleness for the <lb/> rude contact of war? None of these butterflies de- <lb/> sired that.
They passed their jeweled comfit-boxes <lb/> one to another and whispered their content in the <lb/>
head butterfly's practical prudence. Joan pleaded <lb/> with the King, saying:</p>
<p>"Ah, I pray you do not throw away this perfect <lb/> opportunity. Everything is
favorable&#x2014;everything. <lb/> It is as if the circumstances were specially made for <lb/> it.
The spirits of our army are exalted with vic- <lb/> tory, those of the English forces depressed by
de- <lb/> feat. Delay will change this. Seeing us hesitate <lb/> to follow up our advantage, our men
will wonder, <lb/> doubt, lose confidence, and the English will wonder, <lb/> gather courage, and be
bold again. Now is the <lb/> time&#x2014;prithee let us march!"</p>
<p>The King shook his head, and La Tremouille, <lb/> being asked for an opinion, eagerly furnished
it:</p>
<p>"Sire, all prudence is against it. Think of the <lb/>
<pb n="311"/> English strongholds along the Loire; think of those <lb/> that lie between us and
Rheims!"</p>
<p>He was going on, but Joan cut him short, and <lb/> said, turning to him:</p>
<p>"If we wait, they will all be strengthened, re- <lb/> enforced. Will that advantage us?"</p>
<p>"Why&#x2014;no."</p>
<p>"Then what is your suggestion?&#x2014;what is it that <lb/> you would propose to do?"</p>
<p>"My judgment is to wait."</p>
<p>"Wait for what?"</p>
<p>The minister was obliged to hesitate, for he knew <lb/> of no explanation that would sound well.
More- <lb/> over, he was not used to being catechised in this <lb/> fashion, with the eyes of a
crowd of people on him, <lb/> so he was irritated, and said:</p>
<p>"Matters of state are not proper matters for <lb/> public discussion."</p>
<p>Joan said placidly:</p>
<p>"I have to beg your pardon. My trespass came <lb/> of ignorance. I did not know that matters con-
<lb/> nected with your department of the government <lb/> were matters of state."</p>
<p>The minister lifted his brows in amused surprise, <lb/> and said, with a touch of sarcasm:</p>
<p>"I am the King's chief minister, and yet you had <lb/> the impression that matters connected with
my <lb/> department are not matters of state? Pray how is <lb/> that?"</p>
<p>Joan replied, indifferently:</p>
<pb n="312"/>
<p>"Because there is no state."</p>
<p>"No state!"</p>
<p>"No, sir, there is no state, and no use for a <lb/> minister. France is shrunk to a couple of
acres of <lb/> ground; a sheriff's constable could take care of it; <lb/> its affairs are not
matters of state. The term is too <lb/> large."</p>
<p>The King did not blush, but burst into a hearty, <lb/> careless laugh, and the court laughed too,
but pru- <lb/> dently turned its head and did it silently. La <lb/> Tremouille was angry, and opened
his mouth to <lb/> speak, but the King put up his hand, and said:</p>
<p>"There&#x2014;I take her under the royal protection. <lb/> She has spoken the truth, the ungilded
truth&#x2014; <lb/> how seldom I hear it! With all this tinsel on me <lb/> and all this tinsel about
me, I am but a sheriff after <lb/> all&#x2014;a poor shabby two-acre sheriff&#x2014;and you are
<lb/> but a constable," and he laughed his cordial laugh <lb/> again. "Joan, my frank, honest
General, <i>will</i> you <lb/> name your reward? I would ennoble you. You <lb/> shall quarter the
crown and the lilies of France for <lb/> blazon, and with them your victorious sword to <lb/> defend
them&#x2014;speak the word."</p>
<p>It made an eager buzz of surprise and envy in the <lb/> assemblage, but Joan shook her head and
said:</p>
<p>"Ah, I cannot, dear and noble Dauphin. To be <lb/> allowed to work for France, to spend one's
self for <lb/> France, is itself so supreme a reward that nothing <lb/> can add to
it&#x2014;nothing. Give me the one reward I <lb/> ask, the dearest of all rewards, the highest in
your <lb/>
<pb n="313"/> gift&#x2014;march with me to Rheims and receive your <lb/> crown. I will beg it on my
knees."</p>
<p>But the King put his hand on her arm, and there <lb/> was a really brave awakening in his voice
and a <lb/> manly fire in his eye when he said:</p>
<p>"No; sit. You have conquered me&#x2014;it shall be <lb/> as you&#x2014;"</p>
<p>But a warning sign from his minister halted him, <lb/> and he added, to the relief of the
Court:</p>
<p>"Well, well, we will think of it, we will think it <lb/> over and see. Does that content you,
impulsive <lb/> little soldier?"</p>
<p>The first part of the speech sent a glow of delight <lb/> to Joan's face, but the end of it
quenched it and she <lb/> looked sad, and the tears gathered in her eyes. <lb/> After a moment she
spoke out with what seemed a <lb/> sort of terrified impulse, and said:</p>
<p>"Oh, use me; I beseech you, use me&#x2014;there is <lb/> but little time!"</p>
<p>"But little time?"</p>
<p>"Only a year&#x2014;I shall last only a year."</p>
<p>"Why, child, there are fifty good years in that <lb/> compact little body yet."</p>
<p>"Oh, you err, indeed you do. In one little <lb/> year the end will come. Ah, the time is so
short, <lb/> so short; the moments are flying, and so much to <lb/> be done. Oh, use me, and
quickly&#x2014;it is life or <lb/> death for France."</p>
<p>Even those insects were sobered by her impas- <lb/> sioned words. The King looked very
grave&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="314"/> grave, and strongly impressed. His eyes lit sud- <lb/> denly with an eloquent fire,
and he rose and drew <lb/> his sword and raised it aloft; then he brought it <lb/> slowly down upon
Joan's shoulder and said:</p>
<p>"Ah, thou art so simple, so true, so great, so <lb/> noble&#x2014;and by this accolade I join
thee to the <lb/> nobility of France, thy fitting place! And for thy <lb/> sake I do hereby ennoble
all thy family and all <lb/> thy kin; and all their descendants born in wedlock, <lb/> not only in
the male but also in the female line. <lb/> And more!&#x2014;more! To distinguish thy house and
<lb/> honor it above all others, we add a privilege never <lb/> accorded to any before in the
history of these <lb/> dominions: the females of thy line shall have and <lb/> hold the right to
ennoble their husbands when these <lb/> shall be of inferior degree." [Astonishment and <lb/> envy
flared up in every countenance when the words <lb/> were uttered which conferred this extraordinary
<lb/> grace. The King paused and looked around upon <lb/> these signs with quite evident
satisfaction.] "Rise, <lb/> Joan of Arc, now and henceforth surnamed <i>Du <lb/> Lis</i>, in
grateful acknowledgment of the good blow <lb/> which you have struck for the lilies of France; and
<lb/> they, and the royal crown, and your own victorious <lb/> sword, fit and fair company for each
other, shall be <lb/> grouped in your escutcheon and be and remain the <lb/> symbol of your high
nobility forever."</p>
<p>As my Lady Du Lis rose, the gilded children of <lb/> privilege pressed forward to welcome her to
their <lb/> sacred ranks and call her by her new name; but she <lb/>
<pb n="315"/> was troubled, and said these honors were not meet <lb/> for one of her lowly birth and
station, and by their <lb/> kind grace she would remain simple Joan of Arc, <lb/> nothing
more&#x2014;and so be called.</p>
<p>Nothing more! As if there <i>could</i> be anything <lb/> more, anything higher, anything greater.
My Lady <lb/> Du Lis&#x2014;why, it was tinsel, petty, perishable. But <lb/> &#x2014;<smcap>Joan of
Arc</smcap>! The mere sound of it sets one's <lb/> pulses leaping.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XXIV">
<pb n="316"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XXIV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> was vexatious to see what a to-do the whole <lb/> town, and next the whole
country, made over <lb/> the news. Joan of Arc ennobled by the King! <lb/> People went dizzy with
wonder and delight over it. <lb/> You cannot imagine how she was gaped at, stared <lb/> at, envied.
Why, one would have supposed that <lb/> some great and fortunate thing had happened to <lb/> her.
But <i>we</i> did not think any great things of it. <lb/> To our minds no mere human hand could add
a <lb/> glory to Joan of Arc. To us she was the sun soar- <lb/> ing in the heavens, and her new
nobility a candle <lb/> atop of it; to us it was swallowed up and lost in her <lb/> own light. And
she was as indifferent to it and as <lb/> unconscious of it as the other sun would have been.</p>
<p>But it was different with her brothers. They were <lb/> proud and happy in their new dignity,
which was <lb/> quite natural. And Joan was glad it had been con- <lb/> ferred, when she saw how
pleased they were. It <lb/> was a clever thought in the King to outflank her <lb/> scruples by
marching on them under shelter of her <lb/> love for her family and her kin.</p>
<p>Jean and Pierre sported their coat-of-arms right <lb/> away; and their society was courted by
everybody, <lb/>
<pb n="317"/> the nobles and commons alike. The Standard- <lb/> Bearer said, with some touch of
bitterness, that he <lb/> could see that they just felt good to be alive, they <lb/> were so soaked
with the comfort of their glory; and <lb/> didn't like to sleep at all, because when they were <lb/>
asleep they didn't know they were noble, and so <lb/> sleep was a clean loss of time. And then he
said:</p>
<p>"They can't take precedence of me in military <lb/> functions and state ceremonies, but when it
comes <lb/> to civil ones and society affairs I judge they'll cuddle <lb/> coolly in behind you and
the knights, and No&#x00EB;l and <lb/> I will have to walk behind <i>them</i>&#x2014;hey?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "I think you are right."</p>
<p>"I was just afraid of it&#x2014;just afraid of it," said <lb/> the Standard-Bearer, with a sigh.
"Afraid of it? <lb/> I'm talking like a fool; of course I <i>knew</i> it. Yes, I <lb/> was talking
like a fool."</p>
<p>No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson said, musingly:</p>
<p>"Yes, I noticed something natural about the tone <lb/> of it."</p>
<p>We others laughed.</p>
<p>"Oh, you did, did you? You think you are very <lb/> clever, don't you? I'll take and wring your
neck <lb/> for you one of these days, No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson."</p>
<p>The Sieur de Metz said:</p>
<p>"Paladin, your fears haven't reached the top <lb/> notch. They are away below the grand
possibilities. <lb/> Didn't it occur to you that in civil and society func- <lb/> tions they will
take precedence of <i>all</i> the rest of the <lb/> personal staff&#x2014;every individual of
us?"</p>
<pb n="318"/>
<p>"Oh, come!"</p>
<p>"You'll find it's so. Look at their escutcheon. <lb/> Its chiefest feature is the lilies of
France. It's <lb/> royal, man, royal&#x2014;do you understand the size of <lb/> that? The lilies are
there by authority of the King <lb/> &#x2014;do you understand the size of <i>that?</i> Though <lb/>
not in detail and in entirety, they do nevertheless <lb/> substantially <i>quarter the arms of
France</i> in their <lb/> coat. Imagine it! consider it! measure the magni- <lb/> tude of it!
<i>We</i> walk in front of those boys? Bless <lb/> you, we've done that for the last time. In my
<lb/> opinion there isn't a lay lord in this whole region <lb/> that can walk in front of them,
except the Duke <lb/> d'Alen&#x00E7;on, prince of the blood."</p>
<p>You could have knocked the Paladin down with a <lb/> feather. He seemed to actually turn pale. He
<lb/> worked his lips a moment without getting anything <lb/> out; then it came:</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> didn't know that, nor the half of it; how <lb/>
<i>could</i> I? I've been an idiot. I see it now&#x2014;I've <lb/> been an idiot. I met them this
morning, and sung <lb/> out <i>hello</i> to them just as I would to anybody. <i>I</i>
<lb/> didn't mean to be ill-mannered, but I didn't know <lb/> the half of this that you've been
telling. I've been <lb/> an ass. Yes, that is all there is to it&#x2014;I've been <lb/> an ass."</p>
<p>No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson said, in a kind of weary way:</p>
<p>"Yes, that is likely enough; but I don't see why <lb/> you should seem surprised at it."</p>
<p>"You don't don't you? Well, <i>why</i> don't you?"</p>
<pb n="319"/>
<p>"Because I don't see any novelty about it. With <lb/> some people it is a condition which is
present all the <lb/> time. Now you take a condition which is present <lb/> all the time, and the
results of that condition will be <lb/> uniform; this uniformity of result will in time be- <lb/>
come monotonous; monotonousness, by the law of <lb/> its being, is fatiguing. If you had manifested <lb/>
<i>fatigue</i> upon noticing that you had been an ass, <lb/> that would have been logical, that
would have been <lb/> rational; whereas it seems to me that to manifest <lb/> surprise was to be
<i>again</i> an ass, because the condi- <lb/> tion of intellect that can enable a person to be sur-
<lb/> prised and stirred by inert monotonousness is a&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Now that is enough, No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson; stop <lb/> where you are, before you get yourself
into trouble. <lb/> And don't bother me any more for some days or a <lb/> week an it please you, for
I cannot abide your <lb/> clack."</p>
<p>"Come, I like that! <i>I</i> didn't want to talk. I <lb/> tried to get out of talking. If you
didn't want to <lb/> hear my clack, what did you keep intruding your <lb/> conversation on me
for?"</p>
<p>"I? I never dreamed of such a thing."</p>
<p>"Well, you did it, anyway. And I have a right <lb/> to feel hurt, and I do feel hurt, to have you
treat <lb/> me so. It seems to me that when a person goads, <lb/> and crowds, and in a manner forces
another person <lb/> to talk, it is neither very fair nor very good- <lb/> mannered to call what he
says <i>clack</i>."</p>
<p>"Oh, snuffle&#x2014;do! and break your heart, you <lb/>
<pb n="320"/> poor thing. Somebody fetch this sick doll a sugar- <lb/> rag. Look you, Sir Jean de
Metz, do you feel <lb/> absolutely certain about that thing?"</p>
<p>"What thing?"</p>
<p>"Why that Jean and Pierre are going to take <lb/> precedence of all the lay noblesse hereabouts
except <lb/> the Duke d'Alen&#x00E7;on?"</p>
<p>"I think there is not a doubt of it."</p>
<p>The Standard-Bearer was deep in thoughts and <lb/> dreams a few moments, then the silk-and-velvet
ex- <lb/> panse of his vast breast rose and fell with a sigh, <lb/> and he said:</p>
<p>"Dear, dear, what a lift it is! It just shows <lb/> what luck can do. Well, I don't care. I
shouldn't <lb/> care to be a painted accident&#x2014;I shouldn't value it. <lb/> I am prouder to
have climbed up to where I am just <lb/> by sheer natural merit than I would be to ride the <lb/>
very sun in the zenith and have to reflect that I was <lb/> nothing but a poor little accident, and
got shot up <lb/> there out of somebody else's catapult. To me, <lb/> merit is everything&#x2014;in
fact, the only thing. All <lb/> else is dross."</p>
<p>Just then the bugles blew the assembly, and that <lb/> cut our talk short.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XXV">
<pb n="321"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XXV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> days began to waste away&#x2014;and nothing <lb/> decided, nothing done. The
army was full of <lb/> zeal, but it was also hungry. It got no pay, the <lb/> treasury was getting
empty, it was becoming impos- <lb/> sible to feed it; under pressure of privation it began <lb/> to
fall apart and disperse&#x2014;which pleased the trifling <lb/> court exceedingly. Joan's distress
was pitiful to <lb/> see. She was obliged to stand helpless while her <lb/> victorious army
dissolved away until hardly the <lb/> skeleton of it was left.</p>
<p>At last one day she went to the Castle of Loches, <lb/> where the King was idling. She found him
consult- <lb/> ing with three of his councilors, Robert le Ma&#x00E7;on, <lb/> a former Chancellor
of France, Christophe d'Har- <lb/> court, and Gerard Machet. The Bastard of Orleans <lb/> was
present also, and it is through him that we <lb/> know what happened. Joan threw herself at the
<lb/> King's feet and embraced his knees, saying:</p>
<p>"Noble Dauphin, prithee hold no more of these <lb/> long and numerous councils, but come, and
come <lb/> quickly, to Rheims and receive your crown."</p>
<p>Christophe d'Harcourt asked:</p>
<pb n="322"/>
<p>"Is it your Voices that command you to say that <lb/> to the King?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and urgently."</p>
<p>"Then will you not tell us in the King's presence <lb/> in what way the Voices communicate with
you?"</p>
<p>It was another sly attempt to trap Joan into indis- <lb/> creet admissions and dangerous
pretensions. But <lb/> nothing came of it. Joan's answer was simple and <lb/> straightforward, and
the smooth Bishop was not able <lb/> to find any fault with it. She said that when she <lb/> met
with people who doubted the truth of her <lb/> mission she went aside and prayed, complaining of
<lb/> the distrust of these, and then the comforting Voices <lb/> were heard at her ear saying, soft
and low, "Go <lb/> forward, Daughter of God, and I will help thee." <lb/> Then she added, "When I
hear that, the joy in my <lb/> heart, oh, it is insupportable!"</p>
<p>The Bastard said that when she said these words <lb/> her face lit up as with a flame, and she
was like one <lb/> in an ecstasy.</p>
<p>Joan pleaded, persuaded, reasoned; gaining <lb/> ground little by little, but opposed step by
step by <lb/> the council. She begged, she implored, leave to <lb/> march. When they could answer
nothing further, <lb/> they granted that perhaps it had been a mistake to <lb/> let the army waste
away, but how could we help it <lb/> now? how could we march without an army?</p>
<p>"Raise one!" said Joan.</p>
<p>"But it will take six weeks."</p>
<p>"No matter&#x2014;begin! let us begin!"</p>
<pb n="323"/>
<p>"It is too late. Without doubt the Duke of <lb/> Bedford has been gathering troops to push to the
<lb/> succor of his strongholds on the Loire."</p>
<p>"Yes, while we have been disbanding ours&#x2014;and <lb/> pity 'tis. But we must throw away no
more time; <lb/> we must bestir ourselves."</p>
<p>The King objected that he could not venture <lb/> toward Rheims with those strong places on the
Loire <lb/> in his path. But Joan said:</p>
<p>"We will break them up. Then you can march."</p>
<p>With <i>that</i> plan the King was willing to venture <lb/> assent. He could sit around out of
danger while <lb/> the road was being cleared.</p>
<p>Joan came back in great spirits. Straightway <lb/> everything was stirring. Proclamations were
issued <lb/> calling for men, a recruiting camp was established at <lb/> Selles in Berry, and the
commons and the nobles <lb/> began to flock to it with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>A deal of the month of May had been wasted; <lb/> and yet by the 6th of June Joan had swept
together <lb/> a new army and was ready to march. She had <lb/> eight thousand men. Think of that.
Think of <lb/> gathering together such a body as that in that little <lb/> region. And these were
veteran soldiers, too. In <lb/> fact, most of the men in France were soldiers, when <lb/> you came
to that; for the wars had lasted genera- <lb/> tions now. Yes, most Frenchmen were soldiers; <lb/>
and admirable runners, too, both by practice and <lb/> inheritance; they had done next to nothing
but run <lb/> for near a century. But that was not their fault. <lb/>
<pb n="324"/> They had had no fair and proper leadership&#x2014;at <lb/> least leaders with a fair
and proper chance. Away <lb/> back, King and Court got the habit of being treacher- <lb/> ous to the
leaders; then the leaders easily got the <lb/> habit of disobeying the King and going their own
<lb/> way, each for himself and nobody for the lot. <lb/> Nobody could win victories that way.
Hence, run- <lb/> ning became the habit of the French troops, and no <lb/> wonder. Yet all that
those troops needed in order <lb/> to be good fighters was a leader who would attend <lb/> strictly
to business&#x2014;a leader with <i>all</i> authority in <lb/> his hands in place of a tenth of it
along with nine <lb/> other generals equipped with an equal tenth apiece. <lb/> They had a leader
rightly clothed with authority <lb/> now, and with a head and heart bent on war of the <lb/> most
intensely business-like and earnest sort&#x2014;and <lb/> there would be <i>results</i>. No doubt of
that. They <lb/> had Joan of Arc; and under that leadership their <lb/> legs would lose the art and
mystery of running.</p>
<p>Yes, Joan was in great spirits. She was here and <lb/> there and everywhere, all over the camp,
by day <lb/> and by night, pushing things. And wherever she <lb/> came charging down the lines,
reviewing the troops, <lb/> it was good to hear them break out and cheer. And <lb/> nobody could
help cheering, she was such a vision <lb/> of young bloom and beauty and grace, and such an <lb/>
incarnation of pluck and life and go! She was <lb/> growing more and more ideally beautiful every
day, <lb/> as was plain to be seen&#x2014;and these were days of <lb/> development; for she was well
past seventeen now <lb/>
<pb n="325"/> &#x2014;in fact, she was getting close upon seventeen and <lb/> a half&#x2014;indeed,
just a little woman, as you may say.</p>
<p>The two young Counts de Laval arrived one day <lb/> &#x2014;fine young fellows allied to the
greatest and most <lb/> illustrious houses of France; and they could not rest <lb/> till they had
seen Joan of Arc. So the King sent <lb/> for them and presented them to her, and you may <lb/>
believe she filled the bill of their expectations. <lb/> When they heard that rich voice of hers
they must <lb/> have thought it was a flute; and when they saw her <lb/> deep eyes and her face, and
the soul that looked <lb/> out of that face, you could see that the sight of her <lb/> stirred them
like a poem, like lofty eloquence, like <lb/> martial music. One of them wrote home to his <lb/>
people, and in his letter he said, "It seemed some- <lb/> thing divine to see her and hear her." Ah,
yes, <lb/> and it was a true word. Truer word was never <lb/> spoken.</p>
<p>He saw her when she was ready to begin her <lb/> march and open the campaign, and this is what he
<lb/> said about it:</p>
<p>"She was clothed all in white armor save her <lb/> head, and in her hand she carried a little
battle-axe; <lb/> and when she was ready to mount her great black <lb/> horse he reared and plunged
and would not let her. <lb/> Then she said, 'Lead him to the cross.' This cross <lb/> was in front
of the church close by. So they led <lb/> him there. Then she mounted, and he never <lb/> budged,
any more than if he had been tied. Then <lb/> she turned toward the door of the church and said, <lb/>
<pb n="326"/> in her soft womanly voice, 'You, priests and people <lb/> of the Church, make
processions and pray to God <lb/> for us!' Then she spurred away, under her standard, <lb/> with her
little axe in her hand, crying 'Forward&#x2014; <lb/> march!' One of her brothers, who came eight
days <lb/> ago, departed with her; and he also was clad all in <lb/> white armor."</p>
<p>I was there, and I saw it, too; saw it all, just as <lb/> he pictures it. And I see it
yet&#x2014;the little battle- <lb/> axe, the dainty plumed cap, the white armor&#x2014;all <lb/> in
the soft June afternoon; I see it just as if it were <lb/> yesterday. And I rode with the
staff&#x2014;the personal <lb/> staff&#x2014;the staff of Joan of Arc.</p>
<p>That young count was dying to go, too, but the <lb/> King held him back for the present. But Joan
had <lb/> made him a promise. In his letter he said:</p>
<p>"She told me that when the King starts for <lb/> Rheims I shall go with him. But God grant I may
<lb/> not have to wait till then, but may have a part in <lb/> the battles!"</p>
<p>She made him that promise when she was taking <lb/> leave of my lady the Duchess
d'Alen&#x00E7;on. The <lb/> duchess was exacting a promise, so it seemed a <lb/> proper time for
others to do the like. The duchess <lb/> was troubled for her husband, for she foresaw des- <lb/>
perate fighting; and she held Joan to her breast, <lb/> and stroked her hair lovingly, and said:</p>
<p>"You must watch over him, dear, and take care <lb/> of him, and send him back to me safe. I
require it <lb/> of you; I will not let you go till you promise."</p>
<pb n="327"/>
<p>Joan said:</p>
<p>"I give you the promise with all my heart; and <lb/> it is not just words, it <i>is</i> a
promise; you shall have <lb/> him back without a hurt. Do you believe? And <lb/> are you satisfied
with me now?"</p>
<p>The duchess could not speak, but she kissed Joan <lb/> on the forehead; and so they parted.</p>
<p>We left on the 6th and stopped over at Romoran- <lb/> tin; then on the 9th Joan entered Orleans
in state, <lb/> under triumphal arches, with the welcoming cannon <lb/> thundering and seas of
welcoming flags fluttering in <lb/> the breeze. The Grand Staff rode with her, clothed <lb/> in
shining splendors of costume and decorations: <lb/> the Duke d'Alen&#x00E7;on; the Bastard of
Orleans; the <lb/> Sire de Boussac, Marshal of France; the Lord de <lb/> Graville, Master of the
Crossbowmen; the Sire de <lb/> Culan, Admiral of France; Ambroise de Lor&#x00E9;; <lb/>
&#x00C9;tienne de Vignoles, called La Hire; Gautier de <lb/> Brusac, and other illustrious
captains.</p>
<p>It was grand times; the usual shoutings and <lb/> packed multitudes, the usual crush to get sight
of <lb/> Joan; but at last we crowded through to our old <lb/> lodgings, and I saw old Boucher and
the wife and <lb/> that dear Catherine gather Joan to their hearts and <lb/> smother her with
kisses&#x2014;and my heart ached so! <lb/> for I could have kissed Catherine better than any- <lb/>
body, and more and longer; yet was not thought of <lb/> for that office, and I so famished for it.
Ah, she <lb/> was so beautiful, and oh, so sweet! I had loved <lb/> her the first day I ever saw
her, and from that day <lb/>
<pb n="328"/> forth she was sacred to me. I have carried her <lb/> image in my heart for sixty-three
years&#x2014;all lonely <lb/> there, yes, solitary, for it never has had company&#x2014; <lb/> and I
am grown so old, so old; but it, oh, it is as <lb/> fresh and young and merry and mischievous and
<lb/> lovely and sweet and pure and witching and divine <lb/> as it was when it crept in there,
bringing benediction <lb/> and peace to its habitation so long ago, so long ago <lb/> &#x2014;for it
has not aged a day!</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXVI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>This</smcap> time, as before, the King's last command to <lb/> the generals was this:
"<i>See to it that you do <lb/> nothing without the sanction of the Maid</i>." And <lb/> this time
the command was obeyed; and would con- <lb/> tinue to be obeyed all through the coming great <lb/>
days of the Loire campaign.</p>
<p>That was a change! That was new! It broke <lb/> the traditions. It shows you what sort of a
reputa- <lb/> tion as a commander-in-chief the child had made for <lb/> herself in ten days in the
field. It was a conquer- <lb/> ing of men's doubts and suspicions and a capturing <lb/> and
solidifying of men's belief and confidence such <lb/> as the grayest veteran on the Grand Staff had
not <lb/> been able to achieve in thirty years. Don't you <lb/> remember that when at sixteen Joan
conducted her <lb/> own case in a grim court of law and won it, the old <lb/> judge spoke of her as
"this marvelous child"? It <lb/> was the right name, you see.</p>
<p>These veterans were not going to branch out and <lb/> do things without the sanction of the
Maid&#x2014;that is <lb/> true; and it was a great gain. But at the same time <lb/> there were some
among them who still trembled at <lb/> her new and dashing war-tactics and earnestly desired <lb/>
<pb n="330"/> to modify them. And so, during the 10th, while <lb/> Joan was slaving away at her
plans and issuing order <lb/> after order with tireless industry, the old-time con- <lb/> sultations
and arguings and speechifyings were going <lb/> on among certain of the generals.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of that day they came in a body <lb/> to hold one of these councils of war; and
while <lb/> they waited for Joan to join them they discussed the <lb/> situation. Now this
discussion is not set down in <lb/> the histories; but I was there, and I will speak of it, <lb/> as
knowing you will trust me, I not being given to <lb/> beguiling you with lies.</p>
<p>Gautier de Brusac was spokesman for the timid <lb/> ones; Joan's side was resolutely upheld by
D'Alen- <lb/> &#x00E7;on, the Bastard, La Hire, the Admiral of France, <lb/> the Marshal de Boussac,
and all the other really im- <lb/> portant chiefs.</p>
<p>De Brusac argued that the situation was very <lb/> grave; that Jargeau, the first point of
attack, was <lb/> formidably strong; its imposing walls bristling with <lb/> artillery; with 7,000
picked English veterans behind <lb/> them, and at their head the great Earl of Suffolk <lb/> and his
two redoubtable brothers, the De la Poles. <lb/> It seemed to him that the proposal of Joan of Arc
<lb/> to try to take such a place by storm was a most <lb/> rash and over-daring idea, and she ought
to be per- <lb/> suaded to relinquish it in favor of the soberer and <lb/> safer procedure of
investment by regular siege. It <lb/> seemed to him that this fiery and furious new fashion <lb/> of
hurling masses of men against impregnable walls <lb/>
<pb n="331"/> of stone, in defiance of the established laws and <lb/> usages of war, was&#x2014;</p>
<p>But he got no further. La Hire gave his plumed <lb/> helm an impatient toss and burst out
with:</p>
<p>"By God, she knows her trade, and none can <lb/> teach it her!"</p>
<p>And before he could get out anything more, <lb/> D'Alen&#x00E7;on was on his feet, and the
Bastard of <lb/> Orleans, and half a dozen others, all thundering at <lb/> once, and pouring out
their indignant displeasure <lb/> upon any and all that might hold, secretly or pub- <lb/> licly,
distrust of the wisdom of the Commander-in- <lb/> Chief. And when they had said their say, La Hire
<lb/> took a chance again, and said:</p>
<p>"There are some that never know how to change, <lb/> Circumstances may change, but those people
are <lb/> never able to see that <i>they</i> have got to change too, <lb/> to meet those
circumstances. All that they know is <lb/> the one beaten track that their fathers and grand- <lb/>
fathers have followed and that they themselves have <lb/> followed in their turn. If an earthquake
come and <lb/> rip the land to chaos, and that beaten track now <lb/> lead over precipices and into
morasses, those people <lb/>
<i>can't</i> learn that they must strike out a new road&#x2014; <lb/> no; they will march stupidly
along and follow the <lb/> old one to death and perdition. Men, there's a new <lb/> state of things;
and a surpassing military genius has <lb/> perceived it with her clear eye. And a new road is <lb/>
required, and that same clear eye has noted where it <lb/> must go, and has marked it out for us.
The man <lb/>
<pb n="332"/> does not live, never has lived, never <i>will</i> live, that <lb/> can improve upon
it! The old state of things was <lb/> defeat, defeat, defeat&#x2014;and by consequence we had <lb/>
troops with no dash, no heart, no hope. Would <lb/> you assault stone walls with such?
No&#x2014;there was <lb/> but one way with that kind: sit down before a place <lb/> and wait,
wait&#x2014;starve it out, if you could. The <lb/> new case is the very opposite; it is this: men
all on <lb/> fire with pluck and dash and vim and fury and <lb/> energy&#x2014;a restrained
conflagration! What would <lb/> you do with it? Hold it down and let it smoulder <lb/> and perish
and go out? What would Joan of Arc <lb/> do with it? Turn it <i>loose</i>, by the Lord God of <lb/>
heaven and earth, and let it swallow up the foe in <lb/> the whirlwind of its fires! Nothing shows
the <lb/> splendor and wisdom of her military genius like her <lb/> instant comprehension of the
size of the change <lb/> which has come about, and her instant perception <lb/> of the right and
only right way to take advantage of <lb/> it. With her is no sitting down and starving out; <lb/> no
dilly-dallying and fooling around; no lazying, <lb/> loafing, and going to sleep; no, it is storm!
storm! <lb/> storm! and still storm! storm! storm! and forever <lb/> storm! storm! storm! hunt the
enemy to his hole, <lb/> then turn her French hurricanes loose and carry him <lb/> by storm! And
that is <i>my</i> sort! Jargeau? What <lb/> of Jargeau, with its battlements and towers, its de-
<lb/> vastating artillery, its seven thousand picked veter- <lb/> ans? Joan of Arc is to the fore,
and by the splendor <lb/> of God its fate is sealed!"</p>
<pb n="333"/>
<p>Oh, he carried them. There was not another <lb/> word said about persuading Joan to change her
<lb/> tactics. They sat talking comfortably enough after <lb/> that.</p>
<p>By and by Joan entered, and they rose and saluted <lb/> with their swords, and she asked what
their pleasure <lb/> might be. La Hire said:</p>
<p>"It is settled, my General. The matter con- <lb/> cerned Jargeau. There were some who thought we
<lb/> could not take the place."</p>
<p>Joan laughed her pleasant laugh; her merry, care- <lb/> free laugh; the laugh that rippled so
buoyantly <lb/> from her lips and made old people feel young again <lb/> to hear it; and she said to
the company:</p>
<p>"Have no fears&#x2014;indeed, there is no need nor <lb/> any occasion for them. We will strike
the English <lb/> boldly by assault, and you will see." Then a far- <lb/> away look came into her
eyes, and I think that a <lb/> picture of her home drifted across the vision of her <lb/> mind; for
she said very gently, and as one who <lb/> muses, "But that I know God guides us and will <lb/> give
us success, I had liefer keep sheep than endure <lb/> these perils."</p>
<p>We had a homelike farewell supper that evening <lb/> &#x2014;just the personal staff and the
family. Joan had <lb/> to miss it; for the city had given a banquet in her <lb/> honor, and she had
gone there in state with the <lb/> Grand Staff, through a riot of joy-bells and a spark- <lb/> ling
Milky Way of illuminations.</p>
<p>After supper some lively young folk whom we <lb/>
<pb n="334"/> knew came in, and we presently forgot that we were <lb/> soldiers, and only remembered
that we were boys <lb/> and girls and full of animal spirits and long-pent <lb/> fun; and so there
was dancing, and games, and <lb/> romps, and screams of laughter&#x2014;just as extrava- <lb/> gant
and innocent and noisy a good time as ever I <lb/> had in my life. Dear, dear, how long ago it
was!&#x2014; <lb/> and I was young then. And outside, all the while, <lb/> was the measured tramp of
marching battalions, be- <lb/> lated odds and ends of the French power gathering <lb/> for the
morrow's tragedy on the grim stage of war. <lb/> Yes, in those days we had those contrasts side by
<lb/> side. And as I passed along to bed there was <lb/> another one: the big Dwarf, in brave new
armor, <lb/> sat sentry at Joan's door&#x2014;the stern Spirit of War <lb/> made flesh, as it
were&#x2014;and on his ample shoulder <lb/> was curled a kitten asleep.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XXVII">
<pb n="335"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XXVII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>We</smcap> made a gallant show next day when we filed <lb/> out through the frowning gates
of Orleans, <lb/> with banners flying and Joan and the Grand Staff in <lb/> the van of the long
column. Those two young De <lb/> Lavals were come now, and were joined to the <lb/> Grand Staff.
Which was well; war being their <lb/> proper trade, for they were grandsons of that illus- <lb/>
trious fighter Bertrand du Guesclin, Constable of <lb/> France in earlier days. Louis de Bourbon,
the <lb/> Marshal de Rais, and the Vidame de Chartres were <lb/> added also. We had a right to feel
a little uneasy, <lb/> for we knew that a force of five thousand men was <lb/> on its way under Sir
John Fastolfe to re-enforce <lb/> Jargeau, but I think we were not uneasy, neverthe- <lb/> less. In
truth, that force was not yet in our <lb/> neighborhood. Sir John was loitering; for some <lb/>
reason or other he was not hurrying. He was <lb/> losing precious time&#x2014;four days at
&#x00C8;tampes, and <lb/> four more at Janville.</p>
<p>We reached Jargeau and began business at once. <lb/> Joan sent forward a heavy force which hurled
itself <lb/> against the outworks in handsome style, and gained <lb/>
<pb n="336"/> a footing and fought hard to keep it; but it pres- <lb/> ently began to fall back
before a sortie from the <lb/> city. Seeing this, Joan raised her battle-cry and <lb/> led a new
assault herself under a furious artillery <lb/> fire. The Paladin was struck down at her side <lb/>
wounded, but she snatched her standard from his <lb/> failing hand and plunged on through the ruck
of <lb/> flying missiles, cheering her men with encouraging <lb/> cries; and then for a good time
one had turmoil, and <lb/> clash of steel, and collision and confusion of strug- <lb/> gling
multitudes, and the hoarse bellowing of the <lb/> guns; and then the hiding of it all under a
rolling <lb/> firmament of smoke&#x2014;a firmament through which <lb/> veiled vacancies appeared
for a moment now and <lb/> then, giving fitful dim glimpses of the wild tragedy <lb/> enacting
beyond; and always at these times one <lb/> caught sight of that slight figure in white mail which
<lb/> was the center and soul of our hope and trust, and <lb/> whenever we saw that, with its back
to us and its <lb/> face to the fight, we knew that all was well. At <lb/> last a great shout went
up&#x2014;a joyous roar of shout- <lb/> ings, in fact&#x2014;and that was sign sufficient that the
<lb/> faubourgs were ours.</p>
<p>Yes, they were ours; the enemy had been driven <lb/> back within the walls. On the ground which
Joan <lb/> had won we camped; for night was coming on.</p>
<p>Joan sent a summons to the English, promising <lb/> that if they surrendered she would allow them
to go <lb/> in peace and take their horses with them. Nobody <lb/> knew that she could take that
strong place, but she <lb/>
<pb n="337"/> knew it&#x2014;knew it well; yet she offered that grace&#x2014; <lb/> offered it in a
time when such a thing was unknown <lb/> in war; in a time when it was custom and usage to <lb/>
massacre the garrison and the inhabitants of cap- <lb/> tured cities without pity or
compunction&#x2014;yes, <lb/> even to the harmless women and children some- <lb/> times. There are
neighbors all about you who well <lb/> remember the unspeakable atrocities which Charles <lb/> the
Bold inflicted upon the men and women and <lb/> children of Dinant when he took that place some
<lb/> years ago: It was a unique and kindly grace which <lb/> Joan offered that garrison; but that
was her way, <lb/> that was her loving and merciful nature&#x2014;she always <lb/> did her best to
save her enemy's life and his soldierly <lb/> pride when she had the mastery of him.</p>
<p>The English asked fifteen days' armistice to con- <lb/> sider the proposal in. And Fastolfe
coming with <lb/> five thousand men! Joan said no. But she offered <lb/> another grace: they might
take both their horses and <lb/> their side-arms&#x2014;but they must go within the hour.</p>
<p>Well, those bronzed English veterans were pretty <lb/> hard-headed folk. They declined again.
Then Joan <lb/> gave command that her army be made ready to <lb/> move to the assault at nine in the
morning. Con- <lb/> sidering the deal of marching and fighting which the <lb/> men had done that
day, D'Alen&#x00E7;on thought the <lb/> hour rather early; but Joan said it was best so, and <lb/>
so must be obeyed. Then she burst out with one <lb/> of those enthusiasms which were always burning
in <lb/> her when battle was imminent, and said:</p>
<pb n="338"/>
<p>"Work! work! and God will work with us!"</p>
<p>Yes, one might say that her motto was "Work! <lb/> stick to it; keep on working!" for in war she
never <lb/> knew what indolence was. And whoever will take <lb/> that motto and live by it will be
likely to succeed. <lb/> There's many a way to win in this world, but none <lb/> of them is worth
much without good hard work <lb/> back of it.</p>
<p>I think we should have lost our big Standard- <lb/> Bearer that day, if our bigger Dwarf had not
been <lb/> at hand to bring him out of the m&#x00EA;l&#x00E9;e when he was <lb/> wounded. He was
unconscious, and would have <lb/> been trampled to death by our own horse, if the <lb/> Dwarf had
not promptly rescued him and haled him <lb/> to the rear and safety. He recovered, and was <lb/>
himself again after two or three hours; and then he <lb/> was happy and proud, and made the most of
his <lb/> wound, and went swaggering around in his bandages <lb/> showing off like an innocent big
child&#x2014;which was <lb/> just what he was. He was prouder of being wounded <lb/> than a really
modest person would be of being killed. <lb/> But there was no harm in his vanity, and nobody <lb/>
minded it. He said he was hit by a stone from a <lb/> catapult&#x2014;a stone the size of a man's
head. But <lb/> the stone grew, of course. Before he got through <lb/> with it he was claiming that
the enemy had flung a <lb/> building at him.</p>
<p>"Let him alone," said No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson. <lb/> "Don't interrupt his processes. To-morrow it
will <lb/> be a cathedral."</p>
<pb n="339"/>
<p>He said that privately. And, sure enough, to- <lb/> morrow it <i>was</i> a cathedral. I never saw
anybody <lb/> with such an abandoned imagination.</p>
<p>Joan was abroad at the crack of dawn, galloping <lb/> here and there and yonder, examining the
situation <lb/> minutely, and choosing what she considered the <lb/> most effective positions for
her artillery; and with <lb/> such accurate judgment did she place her guns that <lb/> her
Lieutenant-General's admiration of it still sur- <lb/> vived in his memory when his testimony was
taken <lb/> at the Rehabilitation, a quarter of a century later.</p>
<p>In this testimony the Duke d'Alen&#x00E7;on said that at <lb/> Jargeau that morning of the 12th
of June she made <lb/> her dispositions not like a novice, but "with the <lb/> sure and clear
judgment of a trained general of <lb/> twenty or thirty years' experience."</p>
<p>The veteran captains of the armies of France said <lb/> she was great in war in all ways, but
greatest of all <lb/> in her genius for posting and handling artillery.</p>
<p>Who taught the shepherd girl to do these marvels <lb/> &#x2014;she who could not read, and had
had no oppor- <lb/> tunity to study the complex arts of war? I do not <lb/> know any way to solve
such a baffling riddle as that, <lb/> there being no precedent for it, nothing in history <lb/> to
compare it with and examine it by. For in his- <lb/> tory there is no great general, however gifted,
who <lb/> arrived at success otherwise than through able teach- <lb/> ing and hard study and some
experience. It is a <lb/> riddle which will never be guessed. <i>I</i> think these <lb/>
<pb n="340"/> vast powers and capacities were born in her, and that <lb/> she applied them by an
intuition which could not <lb/> err.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock all movement ceased, and with it <lb/> all sounds, all noise. A mute expectancy
reigned. <lb/> The stillness was something awful&#x2014;because it meant <lb/> so much. There was no
air stirring. The flags on <lb/> the towers and ramparts hung straight down like tas- <lb/> sels.
Wherever one saw a person, that person had <lb/> stopped what he was doing, and was in a waiting
<lb/> attitude, a listening attitude. We were on a com- <lb/> manding spot, clustered around Joan.
Not far from <lb/> us, on every hand, were the lanes and humble dwell- <lb/> ings of these outlying
suburbs. Many people were <lb/> visible&#x2014;all were listening, not one was moving. A <lb/> man
had placed a nail; he was about to fasten <lb/> something with it to the doorpost of his
shop&#x2014; <lb/> but he had stopped. There was his hand reaching <lb/> up holding the nail; and
there was his other hand <lb/> in the act of striking with the hammer; but he had <lb/> forgotten
everything&#x2014;his head was turned aside <lb/> listening. Even children unconsciously stopped in
<lb/> their play; I saw a little boy with his hoop-stick <lb/> pointed slanting toward the ground in
the act of <lb/> steering the hoop around the corner; and so he had <lb/> stopped and was
listening&#x2014;the hoop was rolling <lb/> away, doing its own steering. I saw a young girl <lb/>
prettily framed in an open window, a watering-pot <lb/> in her hand and window-boxes of red flowers
under <lb/> its spout&#x2014;but the water had ceased to flow; the <lb/>
<pb n="341"/> girl was listening. Everywhere were these impres- <lb/> sive petrified forms; and
everywhere was suspended <lb/> movement and that awful stillness.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc raised her sword in the air. At the <lb/> signal, the silence was torn to rags;
cannon after <lb/> cannon vomited flames and smoke and delivered its <lb/> quaking thunders; and we
saw answering tongues of <lb/> fire dart from the towers and walls of the city, ac- <lb/>
companiedby answering deep thunders, and in a <lb/> minute the walls and the towers disappeared, and
in <lb/> their place stood vast banks and pyramids of snowy <lb/> smoke, motionless in the dead air.
The startled <lb/> girl dropped her watering-pot and clasped her hands <lb/> together, and at that
moment a stone cannon-ball <lb/> crashed through her fair body.</p>
<p>The great artillery duel went on, each side ham- <lb/> mering away with all its might; and it was
splendid <lb/> for smoke and noise, and most exalting to one's <lb/> spirits. The poor little town
around about us <lb/> suffered cruelly. The cannon-balls tore through its <lb/> slight buildings,
wrecking them as if they had been <lb/> built of cards; and every moment or two one would <lb/> see
a huge rock come curving through the upper air <lb/> above the smoke clouds and go plunging down
<lb/> through the roofs. Fire broke out, and columns of <lb/> flame and smoke rose toward the
sky.</p>
<p>Presently the artillery concussions changed the <lb/> weather. The sky became overcast, and a
strong <lb/> wind rose and blew away the smoke that hid the <lb/> English fortresses.</p>
<pb n="342"/>
<p>Then the spectacle was fine; turreted gray walls <lb/> and towers, and streaming bright flags,
and jets of <lb/> red fire and gushes of white smoke in long rows, all <lb/> standing out with sharp
vividness against the deep <lb/> leaden background of the sky; and then the whiz- <lb/> zing
missiles began to knock up the dirt all around <lb/> us, and I felt no more interest in the scenery.
<lb/> There was one English gun that was getting our <lb/> position down finer and finer all the
time. Presently <lb/> Joan pointed to it and said:</p>
<p>"Fair duke, step out of your tracks, or that <lb/> machine will kill you."</p>
<p>The Duke d'Alen&#x00E7;on did as he was bid; but <lb/> Monsieur du Lude rashly took his place,
and that <lb/> cannon tore his head off in a moment.</p>
<p>Joan was watching all along for the right time to <lb/> order the assault. At last, about nine
o'clock, she <lb/> cried out:</p>
<p>"Now&#x2014;to the assault!" and the buglers blew <lb/> the charge.</p>
<p>Instantly we saw the body of men that had been <lb/> appointed to this service move forward
toward a <lb/> point where the concentrated fire of our guns had <lb/> crumbled the upper half of a
broad stretch of wall <lb/> to ruins; we saw this force descend into the ditch <lb/> and begin to
plant the scaling-ladders. We were <lb/> soon with them. The Lieutenant-General thought <lb/> the
assault premature. But Joan said:</p>
<p>"Ah, gentle duke, are you afraid? Do you not <lb/> know that I have promised to send you home
safe?"</p>
<pb n="343"/>
<p>It was warm work in the ditches. The walls were <lb/> crowded with men, and they poured
avalanches of <lb/> stones down upon us. There was one gigantic <lb/> Englishman who did us more
hurt than any dozen <lb/> of his brethren. He always dominated the places <lb/> easiest of assault,
and flung down exceedingly <lb/> troublesome big stones which smashed men and <lb/> ladders
both&#x2014;then he would near burst himself <lb/> with laughing over what he had done. But the
<lb/> duke settled accounts with him. He went and found <lb/> the famous cannoneer, Jean le Lorrain,
and said:</p>
<p>"Train your gun&#x2014;kill me this demon."</p>
<p>He did it with the first shot. He hit the English- <lb/> man fair in the breast and knocked him
backwards <lb/> into the city.</p>
<p>The enemy's resistance was so effective and so <lb/> stubborn that our people began to show signs
of <lb/> doubt and dismay. Seeing this, Joan raised her <lb/> inspiring battle-cry and descended
into the fosse <lb/> herself, the Dwarf helping her and the Paladin stick- <lb/> ing bravely at her
side with the standard. She <lb/> started up a scaling-ladder, but a great stone flung <lb/> from
above came crashing down upon her helmet <lb/> and stretched her, wounded and stunned, upon the
<lb/> ground. But only for a moment. The Dwarf stood <lb/> her upon her feet, and straightway she
started up <lb/> the ladder again, crying:</p>
<p>"To the assault, friends, to the assault&#x2014;the <lb/> English are ours! It is the appointed
hour!"</p>
<p>There was a grand rush, and a fierce roar of war- <lb/>
<pb n="344"/> cries, and we swarmed over the ramparts like ants. <lb/> The garrison fled, we
pursued; Jargeau was ours!</p>
<p>The Earl of Suffolk was hemmed in and sur- <lb/> rounded, and the Duke d'Alen&#x00E7;on and the
Bastard <lb/> of Orleans demanded that he surrender himself. <lb/> But he was a proud nobleman and
came of a proud <lb/> race. He refused to yield his sword to subordi- <lb/> nates, saying:</p>
<p>"I will die rather. I will surrender to the Maid <lb/> of Orleans alone, and to no other."</p>
<p>And so he did; and was courteously and honor- <lb/> ably used by her.</p>
<p>His two brothers retreated, fighting step by step, <lb/> toward the bridge, we pressing their
despairing <lb/> forces and cutting them down by scores. Arrived <lb/> on the bridge, the slaughter
still continued. Alex- <lb/> ander de la Pole was pushed overboard or fell over, <lb/> and was
drowned. Eleven hundred men had fallen; <lb/> John de la Pole decided to give up the struggle. <lb/>
But he was nearly as proud and particular as his <lb/> brother of Suffolk as to whom he would
surrender <lb/> to. The French officer nearest at hand was Guil- <lb/> laume Renault, who was
pressing him closely. Sir <lb/> John said to him:</p>
<p>"Are you a gentleman?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And a knight?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Then Sir John knighted him himself there on the <lb/> bridge, giving him the accolade with
English cool- <lb/>
<pb n="345"/> ness and tranquillity in the midst of that storm of <lb/> slaughter and mutilation;
and then bowing with <lb/> high courtesy took the sword by the blade and laid <lb/> the hilt of it
in the man's hand in token of sur- <lb/> render. Ah, yes, a proud tribe, those De la Poles.</p>
<p>It was a grand day, a memorable day, a most <lb/> splendid victory. We had a crowd of prisoners,
but <lb/> Joan would not allow them to be hurt. We took <lb/> them with us and marched into Orleans
next day <lb/> through the usual tempest of welcome and joy.</p>
<p>And this time there was a new tribute to our <lb/> leader. From everywhere in the packed streets
the <lb/> new recruits squeezed their way to her side to touch <lb/> the sword of Joan of Arc and
draw from it some- <lb/> what of that mysterious quality which made it <lb/> invincible.</p>
